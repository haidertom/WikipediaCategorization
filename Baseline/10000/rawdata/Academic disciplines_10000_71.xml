      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48329">'''American civil religion''' is a [[sociological theory]] that a nonsectarian quasi-[[religious]] faith exists within the [[United States]] with sacred symbols drawn from national history. Scholars have portrayed it as a cohesive force, a common set of values that foster social and cultural integration. The very heavy emphasis on nondenominational religious themes is quite distinctively American and the theory is designed to explain this. The concept goes back to the 19th century, but in current form, the theory was developed by sociologist [[Robert Bellah]] in 1967 in his article, "Civil Religion in America". The topic soon became the major focus at [[sociology of religion|religious sociology]] conferences and numerous articles and books were written on the subject. The debate reached its peak with the [[American Bicentennial]] celebration in 1976.&lt;ref name = "RB"&gt;{{cite journal

|quote=The article caused an almost unprecedented burst of excitement among sociologists and other scholars of religion.
|url=http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/american.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a viewpoint that some Americans have come to see the document of the [[United States Constitution]], along with the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] as cornerstones of a type of civic or [[civil religion]] or [[political religion]]. Political sociologist Anthony Squiers argues that these texts act as the sacred writ of the American civil religion because they are used as authoritative symbols in what he calls the politics of the sacred. The Politics of the Sacred, according to Squiers are "the attempt to define and dictate what is in accord with the civil religious sacred and what is not. It is a battle to define what can and cannot be and what should and should not be tolerated and accepted in the community, based on its relation to that which is sacred for that community."&lt;ref&gt;Squiers, A. (2018). The Politics of the Sacred in America: The Role of Civil Religion in Political Practice. New York: Springer. p. 20. {{ISBN|978-3-319-68870-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Bellah, Americans embrace a common "civil religion" with certain fundamental beliefs, values, holidays, and rituals, parallel to, or independent of, their chosen religion.&lt;ref name = "jew" /&gt; Presidents have often served in central roles in civil religion, and the nation provides quasi-religious honors to its martyrs—such as [[Abraham Lincoln]] and the soldiers killed in the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Harry S. Stout, ''Upon the Altar of the Nation: A Moral History of the Civil War'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Historians have noted presidential level use of civil religion rhetoric in profoundly moving episodes such as [[World War II]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael A. Genovese|title=Encyclopedia of the American Presidency|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BaVozO5RyNwC&amp;pg=PA89|year=2010|publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]]|page=89|isbn=9781438126388}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Civil Rights Movement]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew Michael Manis|title=Southern Civil Religions in Conflict: Civil Rights and the Culture Wars|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oq2d_TFALAEC&amp;pg=PA184|year=2002|publisher=[[Mercer University Press]]|page=184|isbn=9780865547858}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[September 11th attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=George C. Edwards|author2=Desmond S. King|title=The Polarized Presidency of George W. Bush|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ahH0DRaFw0C&amp;pg=PA152|year=2007|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page=152|isbn=9780199217977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a survey of more than fifty years of American civil religion scholarship, Squiers identifies fourteen principal tenets of the American civil religion:

# Filial piety
# Reference to certain sacred texts and symbols of the ACR (The Constitution, The Declaration of independence, the flag, etc.)
# The sanctity of American institutions 
# The belief in God or a deity
# The idea that rights are divinely given
# The notion that freedom comes from God through government
# Governmental authority comes from God or a higher transcendent authority 
# The conviction that God can be known through the American experience
# God is the supreme judge
# God is sovereign 
# America’s prosperity results from God’s providence 
# America is a ‘city on a hill’ or a beacon of hope and righteousness 
# The principle of sacrificial death and rebirth 
# America serves a higher purpose than self-interests

In an examination of over fifty years of political discourse, Squiers finds that Filial piety, Reference to certain sacred texts and symbols of the ACR, The belief in God or a deity, America is a ‘city on a hill’ or a beacon of hope and righteousness, and America serves a higher purpose than self-interests are the most frequently referenced. He further found that there are no statistically significant differences in the amount of American civil religious language between Democrats and Republicans, incumbents and non-incumbents nor Presidential and Vice-Presidential candidates.&lt;ref&gt;Squiers, A. (2018). The Politics of the Sacred in America: The Role of Civil Religion in Political Practice. New York: Springer. p. 51-74. {{ISBN|978-3-319-68870-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This belief system has historically been used to reject nonconformist ideas and groups.&lt;ref name = "RB" /&gt; Theorists such as Bellah hold that American civil religion can perform the religious functions of integration, legitimation, and prophecy, while other theorists, such as Richard Fenn, disagree.&lt;ref&gt;Gail Gehrig, "The American Civil Religion Debate: A Source for Theory Construction," ''[[Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion]]'', (March 1981) 20#1 pp. 51–63 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1385338 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of concept==
{{See also|Political religion|Civil religion}}
[[Alexis de Tocqueville]] believed that Christianity was the source of the basic principles of liberal democracy, and the only religion capable of maintaining liberty in a democratic era. He was keenly aware of the mutual hatred between Christians and [[French liberalism|liberals]] in 19th-century France, rooted in the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and the [[French Revolution]]. In France, Christianity was allied with the Old Regime before 1789 and the reactionary [[Bourbon Restoration]] of 1815-30. However he said Christianity was not antagonistic to democracy in the United States, where it was a bulwark against dangerous tendencies toward [[individualism]] and [[materialism]], which would lead to [[atheism]] and tyranny.&lt;ref&gt;Sanford Kessler, "Tocqueville on Civil Religion and Liberal Democracy," ''[[Journal of Politics]],'' 39#1 (1977), pp. 119–46 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2129689 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also important were the contributions of French philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] (1712–1778) and French sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]] (1858–1917).

===The American case===
Most students of American civil religion follow the basic Bellah/Durkheimian interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Marcela Cristi, ''From civil to political religion: the intersection of culture, religion and politics'' (2001) p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources of this idea include philosopher [[John Dewey]] who spoke of "common faith" (1934); sociologist Robin Murphy Williams' ''American Society: A Sociological Interpretation'' (1951) which stated there was a "common religion" in America; sociologist [[Lloyd Warner]]'s analysis of the [[Memorial Day]] celebrations in "Yankee City" (1953 [1974]); historian [[Martin Marty]]'s "religion in general" (1959); theologian [[Will Herberg]] who spoke of "the [[American Way of Life]]" (1960, 1974); historian [[Sidney Mead]]'s "religion of the Republic" (1963); and British writer [[G. K. Chesterton]], who said that the United States was "the only nation ... founded on a creed" and also coined the phrase "a nation with a soul of a church".&lt;ref name="from" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "e" /&gt;

In the same period, several distinguished historians such as Yehoshua Arieli, [[Daniel Boorstin]], and Ralph Gabriel "assessed the religious dimension of '[[nationalism]]', the 'American creed', 'cultural religion' and the 'democratic faith'".&lt;ref name="from" /&gt;

Premier sociologist [[Seymour Lipset]] (1963) referred to "Americanism" and the "American Creed" to characterize a distinct set of values that Americans hold with a quasi-religious fervor.&lt;ref name="from" /&gt;

Today, according to social scientist Ronald Wimberley and William Swatos, there seems to be a firm consensus among social scientists that there is a part of Americanism that is especially religious in nature, which may be termed civil religion. But this religious nature is less significant than the "transcendent universal religion of the nation" which late eighteenth century French intellectuals such as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] wrote about.&lt;ref name = "e" /&gt;

===Evidence supporting Bellah===
Ronald Wimberley (1976) and other researchers collected large surveys and factor analytic studies which gave support to Bellah's argument that civil religion is a distinct cultural phenomenon within American society which is not embodied in American politics or denominational religion.&lt;ref name="e" /&gt;

Examples of civil religious beliefs are reflected in statements used in the research such as the following:
* "America is God's [[New Jerusalem#Puritan|chosen nation]] today."
* "A president's authority ... is from God."
* "Social justice cannot only be based on laws; it must also come from religion."
* "God can be known through the experiences of the American people."
* "Holidays like the [[Fourth of July]] are religious as well as patriotic."&lt;ref name="e" /&gt;
* "God Bless America"
Later research sought to determine who is civil religious. In a 1978 study by James Christenson and Ronald Wimberley, the researchers found that a wide cross section of American citizens have civil religious beliefs. In general though, college graduates and political or religious liberals appear to be somewhat less civil religious. [[Protestantism|Protestants]] and [[Catholicism|Catholics]] have the same level of civil religiosity. Religions that were created in the United States, the [[Latter Day Saints movement]], [[Adventism|Adventists]], and [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostals]], have the highest civil religiosity. Jews, Unitarians and those with no religious preference have the lowest civil religion. Even though there is variation in the scores, the "great majority" of Americans are found to share the types of civil religious beliefs which Bellah wrote about.&lt;ref name="e" /&gt;

Further research found that civil religion plays a role in people's preferences for political candidates and policy positions. In 1980 Ronald Wimberley found that civil religious beliefs were more important than loyalties to a political party in predicting support for Nixon over McGovern with a sample of Sunday morning church goers who were surveyed near the election date and a general group of residents in the same community. In 1982 James Christenson and Ronald Wimberley found that civil religion was second only to occupation in predicting a person's political policy views.&lt;ref name="e" /&gt;

Coleman has argued that civil religion is a widespread theme in history. He says it typically evolves in three phases: undifferentiation, state sponsorship in the period of modernization, differentiation. He supports his argument with comparative historical data from Japan, Imperial Rome, the Soviet Union, Turkey, France and The United States.&lt;ref&gt;John A. Coleman, "Civil Religion," ''Sociological Analysis,'' Summer 1970, 31#2 pp. 67–77 {{doi|10.2307/3710057}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil religion in practice==

===American Revolution===

The [[American Revolution]] was the main source of civil religion. It produced a [[Moses]]-like leader ([[George Washington]]), prophets ([[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Thomas Paine]]), apostles ([[John Adams]], [[Benjamin Franklin]]) and martyrs ([[Boston Massacre]], [[Nathan Hale]]), as well as devils ([[Benedict Arnold]]), sacred places ([[Valley Forge]]), rituals (raising the [[Liberty Tree]]), flags (the [[Betsy Ross flag]]), sacred holidays ([[Independence Day (United States)|July 4th]]) and a holy scripture (The [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]).&lt;ref&gt;Catherine L. Albanese, ''Sons of the Fathers: The Civil Religion of the American Revolution'' (1977)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ceremonies in the early Republic===
[[File:Apotheosis of George Washington.jpg|right|thumbnail|upright=1.3|''[[The Apotheosis of Washington]]'', as seen looking up from the capitol rotunda]]
The elitists who ran the [[Federalist Party|Federalists]] were conscious of the need to boost voter identification with their party.&lt;ref&gt;David Waldstreicher, ''In the midst of perpetual fetes: The making of American nationalism, 1776–1820'' (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Elections remained of central importance but for the rest of the political year celebrations, parades, festivals, and visual sensationalism were used. They employed multiple festivities, exciting parades, and even quasi-religious pilgrimages and "sacred" days that became incorporated into the American civil religion. George Washington was always its hero, and after his death he became a sort of [[demigod]] looking down from heaven to instill his blessings on the party.&lt;ref&gt;John Ferling, ''The ascent of George Washington: The hidden political genius of an American Icon'' (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

At first the Federalists focused on commemoration of the ratification of the Constitution;  they organized parades to demonstrate widespread popular support for the new Federalist Party. The parade organizers, incorporated secular versions of traditional religious themes and rituals, thereby fostering a highly visible celebration of the nation's new civil religion.&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Heideking, "The federal processions of 1788 and the origins of American civil religion." ''[[Soundings (journal)|Soundings]]'' (1994): 367–87. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/41178897 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fourth of July became a semi-sacred day—a status it maintains in the 21st century. Its celebration  in Boston proclaimed national over local patriotism, and included orations, dinners, [[Militia (United States)|militia]] musters, parades, marching bands, floats and fireworks. By 1800, the Fourth was closely identified with the Federalist party. Republicans were annoyed, and stage their own celebrations on the fourth—with rival parades sometimes clashing with each other. That generated even more excitement and larger crowds. After the collapse of the Federalists starting in 1815, the Fourth became a nonpartisan holiday.&lt;ref&gt;Len Travers, "Hurrah for the Fourth: Patriotism, Politics, and Independence Day in Federalist Boston, 1783–1818." ''[[Essex Institute]] Historical Collections'' 125: 129–61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Coe, et al. ''The Rhetoric of American Civil Religion: Symbols, Sinners, and Saints'' ([[Lexington Books]], 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

===President as leader of civil religion===
Since the days of George Washington presidents have assumed one of several roles in American civil religion, and that role has helped shape the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;Richard G., Hutcheson, Jr., ''God in the White House: How Religion Has Changed the Modern Presidency'' (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James David Fairbanks, "The Priestly Functions of the Presidency: A Discussion of the Literature on Civil Religion and Its Implications for the Study of Presidential Leadership," ''Presidential Studies Quarterly'' (1981) 11:214–32.&lt;/ref&gt; Linder argues that:

{{quote|Throughout American history, the president has provided the leadership in the public faith. Sometimes he has functioned primarily as a national prophet, as did Abraham Lincoln. Occasionally he has served primarily as the nation's pastor, as did Dwight Eisenhower. At other times he has performed primarily as the high priest of the civil religion, as did Ronald Reagan. In prophetic civil religion, the president assesses the nation's actions in relation to transcendent values and calls upon the people to make sacrifices in times of crisis and to repent of their corporate sins when their behavior falls short of the national ideals. As the national pastor, he provides spiritual inspiration to the people by affirming American core values and urging them to appropriate those values, and by comforting them in their afflictions. In the priestly role, the president makes America itself the ultimate reference point. He leads the citizenry in affirming and celebrating the nation, and reminds them of the national mission, while at the same time glorifying and praising his political flock.&lt;ref name="Robert D. Linder 1996, pp 733-49"&gt;Robert D. Linder, "Universal pastor: President Bill Clinton's civil religion," ''[[Journal of Church and State]],'' Autumn 1996, 38#4 pp 733–49&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Charles W. Calhoun]] argues that in the 1880s the speeches of [[Benjamin Harrison]] display a rhetorical style that embraced American civic religion; indeed, Harrison was one of the credo's most adept presidential practitioners. Harrison was a leader whose application of Christian ethics to social and economic matters paved the way for the [[Social Gospel]], the [[Progressive Movement]] and a national climate of acceptance regarding government action to resolve social problems.&lt;ref&gt;Charles W. Calhoun, "Civil religion and the gilded age presidency: The case of Benjamin Harrison," ''Presidential Studies Quarterly,'' Fall 1993, 23#4 pp. 651–67&lt;/ref&gt;

Linder argues that President Bill Clinton's sense of civil religion was based on his [[Baptists in the United States|Baptist]] background in [[Arkansas]]. Commentator [[William Safire]] noted of the 1992 presidential campaign that, "Never has the name of God been so frequently invoked, and never has this or any nation been so thoroughly and systematically blessed."&lt;ref&gt;Barry A. Kosmin and Seymour Lachman, ''One Nation Under God: Religion in Contemporary American Society'' (1994) p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton speeches incorporated religious terminology that suggests the role of pastor rather than prophet or priest. With a universalistic outlook, he made no sharp distinction between the domestic and the foreign in presenting his vision of a world community of civil faith.&lt;ref name="Robert D. Linder 1996, pp 733-49"/&gt;

Brocker argues that Europeans have often mischaracterized the politics of President [[George W. Bush]] (2001–2009) as directly inspired by [[Protestant fundamentalism]]. However, in his speeches Bush mostly actually used civil religious metaphors and images and rarely used language specific to any Christian denomination. [[Foreign policy of the George W. Bush administration|His foreign policy]], says Bocker, was based on American security interests and not on any fundamentalist teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Brocker, "Civil Religion, Fundamentalism, and the Politics and Policies of George W. Bush," ''Journal of Political Science,'' Jan 2004, Vol. 32, pp. 95–124&lt;/ref&gt;

Hammer says that in his 2008 campaign speeches candidate [[Barack Obama]] portrays the American nation as a people unified by a shared belief in the American Creed and sanctified by the symbolism of an American civil religion.&lt;ref&gt;Stefanie. Hammer, "The role of narrative in political campaigning: An analysis of speeches by Barack Obama," ''[[National Identities]],'' Sept 2010, 12#3, pp. 269–90&lt;/ref&gt;

Would-be presidents likewise contributed to the rhetorical history of civil religion. The speeches of [[Daniel Webster]] were often memorized by student debaters, and his 1830 endorsement of "Liberty and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable" was iconic.&lt;ref&gt;Craig R. Smith, ''Daniel Webster and the Oratory of Civil Religion'' (2005) p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbolism of the American flag===
According to Adam Goodheart, the modern meaning of the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]], and the reverence of many Americans towards it, was forged by Major [[Robert Anderson (Civil War)|Robert Anderson]]'s fight in defense of the flag at the [[Battle of Fort Sumter]], which opened the [[American Civil War]] in April 1861. During the war the flag was used throughout the Union to symbolize American nationalism and rejection of secessionism. Goodheart explains the flag was transformed into a sacred symbol of patriotism:

{{quote|Before that day, the flag had served mostly as a military ensign or a convenient marking of American territory ... and displayed on special occasions like the Fourth of July. But in the weeks after Major Anderson's surprising stand, it became something different. Suddenly the Stars and Stripes flew ... from houses, from storefronts, from churches; above the village greens and college quads. ... [T]hat old flag meant something new. The abstraction of the Union cause was transfigured into a physical thing: strips of cloth that millions of people would fight for, and many thousands die for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Adam Goodheart|title=1861: The Civil War Awakening|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bCPbnsUPhB0C&amp;pg=PA22|year=2011|publisher=[[Vintage Books]]|page=22|isbn=9781400032198}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Soldiers and veterans===
An important dimension is the role of the soldiers, ready to sacrifice their lives to preserve the nation. They are memorialized in many monuments and semi-sacred days, such as [[Veterans Day]] and [[Memorial Day]]. Historian Jonathan Ebel argues that the "soldier-savior" is a sort of Messiah, who embodies the synthesis of civil religion, and the Christian ideals of sacrifice and redemption.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan H. Ebel, ''G.I. Messiahs: Soldiering, War, and American Civil Religion'' (2015) p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, there are numerous cemeteries exclusively for American soldiers who fought in world wars. They have become American sacred spaces.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan H. Ebel, "Overseas military cemeteries As american sacred space: mine eyes have seen la gloire." ''Material Religion'' 8#2 (2012): 183–214.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pacifists have made some sharp criticisms. For example, Kelly Denton-Borhaug, writing from the [[Moravian College|Moravian]] peace tradition,&lt;ref&gt;Kelly Denton-Borhaug,  "Sharing Peace: Mennonites and Catholics in Conversation eds. by Gerald W. Schlabach and Margaret Pfeil," ''American Catholic Studies'' 125#2 (2014): 82–83.&lt;/ref&gt;  argues that the theme of "sacrifice" has fueled the rise of what she calls "U.S. war culture." The result is a diversion of attention from what she considers the militarism and the immoral, oppressive, sometimes barbaric conduct in the global American war on terror.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly Denton-Borhaug, ''U.S. War-Culture, Sacrifice and Salvation'' (2011) pp. 1–4.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some Protestant denominations such as the [[Churches of Christ]], have largely turned away from [[pacifism]] to give greater support to patriotism and civil religion.&lt;ref&gt;Michael W. Casey, "From Pacifism to Patriotism: The Emergence of Civil Religion in the Churches of Christ During World War I." ''[[Mennonite Quarterly Review]]'' 66#3 (1992): 376–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pledge of Allegiance===
Kao and Copulsky argue the concept of civil religion illuminates the popular constitutional debate over the [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]]. The function of the pledge has aspects: preservationist, pluralist, priestly, and prophetic. The debate is not between those who believe in God and those who do not, but it is a dispute on the meaning and place of civil religion in America.&lt;ref&gt;Grace Y. Kao and Jerome E. Copulsky, "The Pledge of Allegiance and the Meanings and Limits of Civil Religion," ''[[Journal of the American Academy of Religion]],'' March 2007, 75#1, pp. 121–49 {{doi|10.1093/jaarel/lfl065}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cloud explores political oaths since 1787 and traces the tension between a need for national unity and a desire to affirm religious faith. He reviews major [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decisions involving the Pledge of Allegiance, including the contradictory ''[[Minersville School District v. Gobitis]]'' (1940) and ''[[West Virginia v. Barnette]]'' (1943) decisions. He argues that the Pledge was changed in 1954 during the Cold War to encourage school children to reject communism's atheistic philosophy by affirming belief in God.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew W. Cloud, "'One Nation, Under God': Tolerable Acknowledgement of Religion or Unconstitutional Cold War Propaganda Cloaked in American Civil Religion?" ''[[Journal of Church and State]],'' Spring 2004, 46#2 pp. 311–40, [http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/jchs46&amp;div=27&amp;id=&amp;page= online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===School rituals===
[[Adam Gamoran]] (1990) argues that civil religion in public schools can be seen in such daily rituals as the pledge of allegiance; in holiday observances, with activities such as music and art; and in the social studies, history and English curricula. Civil religion in schools plays a dual role: it socializes youth to a common set of understandings, but it also sets off subgroups of Americans whose backgrounds or beliefs prevent them from participating fully in civil religious ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Gamoran, "Civil Religion in American Schools," ''SA: Sociological Analysis,'' Fall 1990, 51#3 pp. 235–56&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnic minorities===
The Bellah argument deals with mainstream beliefs, but other scholars have looked at minorities outside the mainstream, and typically distrusted or disparaged by the mainstream, which have developed their own version of U.S. civil religion.

====White Southerners====
Wilson, noting the historic centrality of religion in [[Southern United States|Southern]] identity, argues that when the [[White Southerners|White South]] was outside the national mainstream in the late 19th century, it created its own pervasive common civil religion heavy with mythology, ritual, and organization. Wilson says the "[[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|Lost Cause]]"—that is, defeat in a holy war—has left some southerners to face guilt, doubt, and the triumph of what they perceive as evil: in other words, to form a tragic sense of life.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Reagan Wilson, "The Religion of the Lost Cause: Ritual and the Organization of the Southern Civil Religion, 1865–1920," ''Journal of Southern History,'' May 1980, 46#2 pp. 219–38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Reagan Wilson, ''Baptized in Blood: The Religion of the Lost Cause, 1865–1920'' (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Black and African Americans====
Woodrum and Bell argue that [[African Americans|black people]] demonstrate less civil religiosity than [[White Americans|white people]] and that different predictors of civil religion operate among black and white people. For example, conventional religion positively influences white people's civil religion but negatively influences black peoples' civil religion. Woodrum and Bell interpret these results as a product of black American religious ethnogenesis and separatism.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Woodrum, and Arnold Bell, "Race, Politics, and Religion in Civil Religion Among Blacks," ''SA: Sociological Analysis,'' Winter 1989, 49#4 pp. 353–67&lt;/ref&gt;

====Japanese Americans====
Iwamura argues that the pilgrimages made by [[Japanese Americans]] to the sites of World War II-era [[Internment of Japanese Americans|internment camps]] have formed a Japanese American version of civil religion. Starting in 1969 the Reverend Sentoku Maeda and Reverend Soichi Wakahiro began pilgrimages to [[Manzanar|Manzanar National Historic Site]] in California. These pilgrimages included poetry readings, music, cultural events, a roll call of former internees, and a nondenominational ceremony with Protestant and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] ministers and Catholic and [[Shinto]] priests. The event is designed to reinforce Japanese American cultural ties and to ensure that such injustices will never occur again.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Naomi Iwamura, "Critical Faith: Japanese Americans and the Birth of a New Civil Religion," ''[[American Quarterly]],'' Sept 2007, 59#3, pp. 937–968, [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/aq/summary/v059/59.3iwamura.html in Project MUSE]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hispanic and Latino Americans====
[[Mexican Americans|Mexican-American]] labor leader [[César Chávez]], by virtue of having holidays, stamps, and other commemorations of his actions, has practically become a "saint" in American civil religion, according to León. He was raised in the Catholic tradition and using Catholic rhetoric. His "sacred acts," his political practices couched in Christian teachings, became influential to the burgeoning Chicano movement and strengthened his appeal. By acting on his moral convictions through nonviolent means, Chávez became sanctified in the national consciousness, says León.&lt;ref&gt;Luis D. León, "Cesar Chavez in American Religious Politics: Mapping the New Global Spiritual Line." ''[[American Quarterly]],'' Sep 2007, 59#3 pp. 857–81, {{doi|10.1353/aq.2007.0060}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enshrined texts==
[[File:Archives of the United States of America 1.jpg|thumb|The [[National Archives Building]] in [[Washington, DC]].]]

Christian language, rhetoric, and values helped colonists to perceive their political system as superior to the corrupt British monarchy. Ministers' sermons were instrumental in promoting patriotism and in motivating the colonists to take action against the evils and corruption of the British government. Together with the semi-religious tone sometimes adopted by preachers and such leaders as George Washington,&lt;ref&gt;Gary Scott Smith, "The American Moses," ''Christian History and Biography,'' Summer 2008, Issue 99, pp. 8–13&lt;/ref&gt; and the notion that God favored the patriot cause, this made the documents of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] suitable as almost-sacred texts.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas S. Kidd, ''God of Liberty: A Religious History of the American Revolution'' (2010) pp. 4, 37, 59, 112, 115,&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Archives Building]] in Washington preserves and displays the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. [[Pauline Maier]] describes these texts as enshrined in massive, bronze-framed display cases.&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;Gordon S. Wood, [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1997/aug/14/dusting-off-the-declaration/ "Dusting off the Declaration]," ''The New York Review of Books,'' Aug 14, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; While political scientists, sociologists, and legal scholars study the Constitution and how it is used in American society, on the other hand, historians are concerned with putting themselves back into a time and place, in context. It would be anachronistic for them to look at the documents of the "Charters of Freedom" and see America's modern "civic religion" because of "how much Americans have transformed very secular and temporal documents into sacred scriptures".&lt;ref name="Wood"/&gt; The whole business of erecting a shrine for the worship of the Declaration of Independence strikes some academic critics looking from point of view of the 1776 or 1789 America as "idolatrous, and also curiously at odds with the values of the Revolution." It was suspicious of religious iconographic practices. At the beginning, in 1776, it was not meant to be that at all.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Gordon S., op.cit., Aug 14, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 1782 [[Great Seal of the United States]], the date of the Declaration of Independence and the words under it signify the beginning of the "new American Era" on earth. Though the inscription, ''Novus ordo seclorum'', does not translate from the Latin as "secular", it also does not refer to a new order of heaven. It is a reference to generations of society in the western hemisphere, the millions of generations to come.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greatseal.com/mottoes/seclorum.html Great Seal] webpage. Viewed August 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even from the vantage point of a new nation only ten to twenty years after the drafting of the Constitution, the Framers themselves differed in their assessments of its significance. Washington in his Farewell Address pleaded that "the Constitution be sacredly maintained."' He echoed Madison in "[[Federalist No. 49]]", that citizen "veneration" of the Constitution might generate the intellectual stability needed to maintain even the "wisest and freest governments" amidst conflicting loyalties. But there is also a rich tradition of dissent from "Constitution worship". By 1816, Jefferson could write that "some men look at constitutions with sanctimonious reverence and deem them like the [[ark of the covenant]], too sacred to be touched." But he saw imperfections and imagined that potentially, there could be others, believing as he did that "institutions must advance also".{{sfn|Levinson|1987|p=115}}

Regarding the [[United States Constitution]], the position of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) is that it is a [[divinely inspired]] document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lds.org/ensign/1992/02/the-divinely-inspired-constitution?lang=eng |title=The Divinely Inspired Constitution |author=Dallin H. Oaks |date=Feb 1992 |publisher=''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''See'' [https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101.77-80#p76 D&amp;C 101:77–80]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seventh-Day Adventists===
While the civil religion has been widely accepted by practically all denominations, one group has always stood against it. [[Seventh-day Adventism|Seventh-Day Adventists]] deliberately pose as "heretics", so to speak, and refuse to perform in the sacred ceremonies like the Pledge of Allegiance or saluting the flag or treating Sundays as special. Indeed, says Bull, the denomination has defined its identity in contradistinction to precisely those elements of the host culture that have constituted civil religion.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Bull, "The Seventh-Day Adventists: Heretics of American Civil Religion'' ''Sociological Analysis,'' April 1989, 50#2, pp. 177–87&lt;/ref&gt;

==Making a nation==
The American identity has an ideological connection to these "Charters of Freedom". [[Samuel P. Huntington]] discusses common connections for most peoples in nation-states, a national identity as product of common ethnicity, ancestry and experience, common language, culture and religion. Levinson argues:

{{quote|It is the fate of the United States, however, to be different from "most peoples," for here national identity is based not on shared Proustian remembrances, but rather on the willed affirmation of what Huntington refers to as the "American creed," a set of overt political commitments that includes an emphasis on individual rights, majority rule, and a constitutional order limiting governmental power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sanford Levinson|title=Constitutional Faith|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VhWFCJ4sQa8C&amp;pg=PA95|year=2011|publisher=Princeton UP|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The creed, according to Huntington,  is made up of (a) individual rights, (b) majority rule, and (c) a constitutional order of limited government power. American independence from Britain was not based on cultural difference, but on the adoption of principles found in the Declaration. Whittle Johnson in ''[[The Yale Review]]'' sees a sort of "covenanting community" of freedom under law, which, "transcending the 'natural' bonds of race, religion and class, itself takes on transcendent importance".{{sfn|Levinson|1987|p=118}}

Becoming a naturalized citizen of the United States requires passing a test covering a basic understanding of the Declaration, the U.S. Constitution, and the Bill of Rights, and taking an oath to support the U.S. Constitution. [[Hans Kohn]] described the United States Constitution as "unlike any other: it represents the lifeblood of the American nation, its supreme symbol and manifestation. It is so intimately welded with the national existence itself that the two have become inseparable." Indeed, abolishing the Constitution in Huntington's view would abolish the United States, it would "destroy the basis of community, eliminating the nation, [effecting] ... a return to nature."{{sfn|Levinson|1987|p=119}}

As if to emphasize the lack of any alternative "faith" to the American nation, Thomas Grey in his article "The Constitution as scripture", contrasted those traditional societies with divinely appointed rulers enjoying heavenly mandates for social cohesion with that of the United States. He pointed out that Article VI, third clause, requires all political figures, both federal and state, "be bound by oath or affirmation to support this Constitution, but no religious test shall ever be required ..." This was a major break not only with past British practice commingling authority of state and religion, but also with that of most American states when the Constitution was written.{{sfn|Levinson|1987|p=120}}

'''Escape clause.''' Whatever the oversights and evils the modern reader may see in the original Constitution, the Declaration that "all men are created equal"—in their rights—informed the Constitution in such a way that [[Frederick Douglass]] in 1860 could label the Constitution, if properly understood, as an antislavery document.&lt;ref name="slavenorth1"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Harper |first=Douglas |url=http://www.slavenorth.com/massemancip.htm |title=Emancipation in Massachusetts |work=Slavery in the North |date=January 2004 |accessdate=January 28, 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040128112051/http://www.slavenorth.com/massemancip.htm |archivedate=January 28, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He held that "the constitutionality of slavery can be made out only by disregarding the plain and common-sense reading to the Constitution itself. [T]he Constitution will afford slavery no protection when it shall cease to be administered by slaveholders," a reference to the Supreme Court majority at the time.&lt;!-- ref name=autogenerated6 --&gt;{{sfn|Levinson|1987|pp=129–30, 133}} With a change of that majority, there was American precedent for judicial activism in Constitutional interpretation, including the Massachusetts Supreme Court, which had ended slavery there in 1783.&lt;ref name="slavenorth1"/&gt;

Accumulations of Amendments under Article V of the Constitution and judicial review of Congressional and state law have fundamentally altered the relationship between U.S. citizens and their governments. Some scholars refer to the coming of a "second Constitution" with the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], we are all free, the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]], we are all citizens, the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth]], men vote, and the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth]], women vote. The Fourteenth Amendment has been interpreted so as to require States to respect citizen rights in the same way that the Constitution has required the Federal government to respect them. So much so, that in 1972, the U.S. Representative from Texas, [[Barbara Jordan]], could affirm, "My faith in the Constitution is whole, it is complete, it is total ...".{{sfn|Levinson|1987|pp=129–30, 133}}

After discussion of the [[Article Five of the United States Constitution|Article V]] provision for change in the Constitution as a political stimulus to serious national consensus building, [[Sanford Levinson]] performed a thought experiment which was suggested at the bicentennial celebration of the Constitution in Philadelphia. If one were to sign the Constitution today,&lt;ref&gt;The visitor to the National Archives website today is invited to sign the Constitution online. Viewed September 11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; whatever our reservations might be, knowing what we do now, and transported back in time to its original shortcomings, great and small, "signing the Constitution commits one not to closure but only to a process of becoming, and to taking responsibility for the political vision toward which I, joined I hope, with others, strive."{{sfn|Levinson|1987|p=144}}

The '''Centre for Occupational and Health Psychology''' ('''COHP''', {{lang-cy|Canolfan Seicoleg Alwedigaethol ac Iechyd}}) is a [[Cardiff University]] research centre founded in 1999 to conduct research into the effects of occupational factors on health and performance efficiency. In addition, the [[risk factors]] relating to ill-health are investigated and the effects of health-related behaviour and health status on cognitive performance, mood and physiological functioning examined.

The Unit is directed by Professor Andy Smith&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1488328/Split-shift-working-is-bad-for-your-heart,-say-scientists.html|title=Split shift working is bad for your heart, say scientists - Telegraph|last=Fleming|first=Nic|date=21 April 2005|publisher=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=2008-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psych.cf.ac.uk/contactsandpeople/academics/smith.html|title=Prof Andrew P Smith  -  BSc PhD Lond FBPsP CPsychol|publisher=Cardiff University|accessdate=2008-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and research is conducted by [[Postdoctoral researcher|post-doctoral]] fellows, research associates and [[Postgraduate education|post-graduate]] students.

Multiple studies have correlated childhood gender nonconformity with eventual [[homosexuality]]; in these studies, a majority of those who identify as [[gay]] or [[lesbian]] self-report being gender nonconforming as children.&lt;ref name="Baumeister"&gt;{{cite book|last=Baumeister|first=Roy F.|title=Social Psychology and Human Sexuality: Essential Readings|year=2001|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-1-84169-018-6|pages=201–2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=roychiRaM8gC&amp;pg=PA202}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schroeder"&gt;{{cite book|author=Carolyn S.

One study suggested that childhood gender nonconformity is [[heritable]].&lt;ref name="Friedman 2008"/&gt;

==Manifestations==
''[[Gender nonconformity]]'' in children can have many forms, reflecting various ways in which a child relates to their gender. In literature, ''[[gender variance]]'' and ''gender atypicality'' are used synonymously with ''gender nonconformity''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adelson L.|first=Stewart|year=2012|title=Practice Parameter on Gay, Lesbian, or Bisexual Orientation, Gender Nonconformity, and Gender Discordance in Children and Adolescents|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S089085671200500X|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry|volume=51| issue = 9|pages=957–974|via=ScienceDirect|doi=10.1016/j.jaac.2012.07.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Cross gender clothing and grooming preferences;
* Playing with toys generally associated with the opposite sex;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Preference for playmates of the opposite sex;
* Identification with characters of the opposite sex in stories, cartoons or films;
* Affirmation of the desire to be a member of the opposite sex;
* Strong verbal affirmation of a cross-gender identity.

==Social and developmental theories of gender==

The concept of childhood [[gender]] nonconformity assumes that there is a correct way to be a girl or a boy.  There are a number of social and developmental perspectives that explore how children come to identify with a particular gender and engage in activities that are associated with this [[gender role]].

Psychoanalytic theories of gender emphasize that children begin to identify with the parent, and that girls tend to identify with their mothers and boys with their fathers. The identification is often associated with the child's realization that they do not share the same [[sex organ|genitals]] with both parents.  According to [[Freud]]’s theories, this discovery leads to [[penis envy]] in girls and [[castration anxiety]] in boys. Although there is not much [[empirical research|empirical evidence]] to back up Freud, his theories sparked new conversations surrounding [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and gender. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Social learning theory emphasizes the rewards and punishments that children receive for sex appropriate or inappropriate behaviors.  One of the criticisms of [[social learning theory]] is that it assumes that children are passive, rather than active participants in their [[social environment]].

Cognitive development theory argues that children are active in defining gender and behaving in ways that reflect their perceptions of [[gender role]]s.  Children are in search of regularities and consistencies in their environment, and the pursuit of [[cognitive dissonance|cognitive consistency]] motivates children to behave in ways that are congruent with the [[social constructionism|societal constructions]] of gender.

Gender schema theory is a hybrid model that combines social learning and [[cognitive development]] theories.  [[Daryl J. Bem]] argues that children have a cognitive readiness to learn about themselves and their surroundings.  They build [[Schema (psychology)|schema]]s to help them navigate their social world, and these schemas form a larger network of associations and beliefs about gender and gender roles.&lt;ref name="Bem 1996 320–335"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bem|first=D.J.|title=Exotic Becomes Erotic: A Developmental Theory of Sexual Orientation|journal=Psychological Review|year=1996|volume=103|pages=320–335|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.103.2.320|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences of androgens==
===Toy preference studies===
[[File:Young Rhesus Macaque.jpg|thumb|Studies with young [[rhesus macaque]]s suggest that some gender-typical preferences may not only be caused by human socialization.]]
Toys for girls tend to be round and pink, while toys for boy tend to be angular and blue.  The subtle characteristics of toys may differentially appeal to the developing brains of female and male children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jadva|first=V.|title=Infants' preferences for toys, colors and shapes|journal=Arch. Sex. Behav.|year=2010|volume=39|doi=10.1007/s10508-010-9618-z|issue=6|pages=1261–73|pmid=20232129|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In a study of toy preferences of twelve- to 24-month-old infants, males spent more time looking at cars than females and females spent more time looking at dolls than males.  No preference for color was found, and within each sex, both boys and girls preferred dolls to cars at age 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alexander|first=G.M.|title=An evolutionary perspective of sex-typed toy preferences: pink, blue, and the brain|journal=Arch. Sex. Behav.|year=2003|volume=32|pages=7–14|doi=10.1023/A:1021833110722|pmid=12597267|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hines 2010 448"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hines|first=M.|title=Sex-related variation in human behavior and the brain|journal=Trends in Neurosciences|year=2010|volume=14|issue=10|pages=448–56|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2010.07.005|pmid=20724210|pmc=2951011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of preschool-aged children found that the cultural labeling of toys as "gender-appropriate" impacted toy preferences. In partial contrast to this view, certain animal studies have lent support for [[biological determinism|biologically determined]] gendered toy preferences.  In a study of juvenile [[rhesus macaque|rhesus monkeys]], when given the option between plush or wheeled toys, female monkeys gravitated toward both toys, while male monkeys mainly preferred toys with wheels.  These findings suggest that gendered preferences for toys can occur without the complex [[socialization]] processes that we find in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hassett|first=Janice M.|author2=Siebert, Erin R.|author3=Wallen, Kim.|title=Differences in Rhesus Monkey Toy Preferences Parallel those of Children|journal=Hormones and Behavior|year=2008|volume=54|issue=3|pages=359–64|doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2008.03.008|pmid=18452921|pmc=2583786}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Female rhesus monkeys also tend to engage in more nurturing play activities, while males tend to engage in more rough-and-tumble play. However, the co-author of the study warned about overinterpreting the results, stating "The plush and wheeled categories served as proxies for feminine and masculine, but other toy characteristics, such as size or colour, might explain the male's behaviour, or the male monkeys might seek out more physically active toys."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn13596-male-monkeys-prefer-boys-toys/|title=Male monkeys prefer boys’ toys|work=New Scientist|access-date=2017-10-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Girls with [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] (CAH) have atypically high blood concentrations of [[testosterone]].  In studies of toy preference, these girls show increased interest in male-typical toys, like trucks and balls.  Overall, their play habits and preferences more closely resembled male-typical play than female-typical play.  Even with children exposed a normal range of prenatal androgens, increased testosterone was associated with increased preference for male-typical toys, and decreased prenatal testosterone was associated with greater interest in female-typical toys.

Overall, the degree of androgen exposure during prenatal and postnatal development may bias males and females toward specific [[cognition|cognitive processes]], which are further reinforced through processes of [[socialization]]. The male interest in balls and wheeled toys may relate to the androgenised brains preference for objects that move through space.  The higher levels of androgens in the developing male brain could elicit greater attraction to cars and balls, while lower levels of androgens elicit a preference for dolls and nurturing activities in the female brain.&lt;ref name="Hines 2010 448"/&gt;

[[Cordelia Fine|Dr. Cordelia Fine]] criticizes toy-preference studies in non-human primates. She explains the disparity across research and the labeling of toys, with the rhesus monkey study deeming stuffed animals as inherently feminine, all the while a study with [[vervet monkeys]] shows males displaying a preference for stuffed dogs. Moreover, the effects of hormonal treatment are deemed inconclusive and significant long-term effects on rhesus monkeys being nonexistent, with treated prenatal females showing no increase in aggression and still adopting "feminine" social roles into adulthood.&lt;ref name="Fine"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fine|first=Cordelia|title=Delusions of Gender: How Our Minds, Society, and Neurosexism Create Difference|year=2010|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|isbn=0-393-06838-2|pages=338|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s2ZtdAx83yMC&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the subject of congenital adrenal hyperplasia, Fine presents the argument of correlation being confused for causality; are females with CAH interested in typically masculine activities due to their having an innate quality or is this a result of their association with boys and men as a gender? If a visual and spatial value is deemed as a preeminent element in typically masculine toys (such as trucks), females with CAH and males in studies should consequently show a much higher interest for neutral toys such as puzzles and sketchpads (as opposed to non-CAH females), something which they do not.&lt;ref name="Fine"/&gt;

===Playmate and play-style preferences===

Children's preference for same-sex play mates is a robust finding that has been observed in many human cultures and across a number of animal species.   Preference for same-sex playmates is at least partially linked to [[socialization]] processes, but children may also gravitate toward peers with similar play styles. Girls generally engage in more nurturing-and-mothering-type behaviors, while boys show greater instances of rough-and-tumble play.&lt;ref name="Hines 1994 1042–53"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hines|first=M. |author2=Kaufman, Melissa |author3=Francine, R.|title=Androgen and the Development of Human Sex-Typical Behavior: Rough and Tumble Play and Sex of Preferred Playmates in Children with Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH)|journal=Child Development|year=1994|volume=65|issue=4|pages=1042–53|doi=10.2307/1131303|pmid=7956464}}&lt;/ref&gt; For much of human history, people lived in small [[hunter-gatherer]] societies.  Over time [[evolution]]ary forces may have selected for children’s play activities related to adult survival skills.

However, it is not uncommon for girls and boys to prefer opposite-sex playmates and to engage in gender atypical play styles.  Similarly to toy preferences, androgens may also be involved in playmate and play style preferences.  Girls who have [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] (CAH) typically engage in more rough-and-tumble play. Hines and Kaufman (1994) found that 50% of girls with CAH reported a preference for boys as playmates, while less than 10% of their non-CAH sisters preferred boys as playmates.&lt;ref name="Hines 1994 1042–53"/&gt; Another study found that girls with CAH still preferred same-sex playmates, but their atypical play styles resulted in them spending more time alone engaging in their preferred activities. Girls with CAH are more likely to have [[intersex|masculinized genitalia]], and it has been suggested that this could lead parents to treat them more like boys; however, this claim is unsubstantiated by parental reports.&lt;ref name="Hines 2004 75–81"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hines|first=M.|author2=Brook, C.|author3=Conway, G.S.|title=Androgen and Psychosexual Development: Core Gender Identity, Sexual Orientation, and Recalled Childhood Gender Role Behavior in Women and Men with Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH)|journal=Journal of Sex Research|year=2004|volume=41|issue=1|pages=75–81|doi=10.1080/00224490409552215|pmid=15216426}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adult traits===

There have been a number of studies correlating childhood gender nonconformity (CGN) and [[sexual orientation]]; however, the relationship between CGN and [[trait theory|personality traits]] in adulthood has been largely overlooked.  Lippa measured CGN, gender-related occupational preferences, self-ascribed [[masculinity]]-[[femininity]] and anxiety in [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] and [[homosexuality|homosexual]] women and men through self-report measures. Gay men showed a tendency toward more feminine self-concepts than heterosexual men.  Similarly, lesbian women reported "higher self-ascribed masculinity, more masculine occupational preferences, and more CGN than heterosexual women." Lippa's study found stronger correlations in CGN and adult personality trait in men than in women. Overall, Lippa's study suggests that gender nonconforming behaviors are relatively stable across a person a life-time.&lt;ref name="Lippa 2008 684–93"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lippa|first=Richard|title=The Relation between Childhood Gender Nonconformity and Adult Masculinity–Femininity and Anxiety in Heterosexual and Homosexual Men and Women|journal=Sex Roles|year=2008|volume=59|issue=9–10|pages=684–93|doi=10.1007/s11199-008-9476-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the advantages of Lippa's study is the relatively high sample size of 950 participants, that was diverse both in terms of representations of sexual orientation and [[ethnic group|ethnicity]]. Although there may be a tendency to want to generalize these findings to all heterosexual and homosexual men and women, awareness that a tendency toward certain behaviors does not mean that they are a monolithic group is necessary; for some individuals, sexual orientation may be the only thing they have in common.&lt;ref name="Lippa 2008 684–93"/&gt;

===Measures of anxiety===

CGN is associated with higher levels of psychological distress in gay men than in lesbian women.  The findings were extended to heterosexual men and women, where "CGN [was] associated with psychological distress in heterosexual men but not in heterosexual women."&lt;ref name="Lippa 2008 684–93"/&gt;  In effect, "CGN impacts men more negatively than women, regardless of sexual orientation."&lt;ref name="Lippa 2008 684–93"/&gt; The pattern of results may be derived by from society's greater acceptance of typically masculine behaviors in girls, and discouragement of typically feminine behaviors in boys.&lt;ref name="Lippa 2008 684–93"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Skidmore|first=W.C.|author2=Linsenmeier, J.A.W.|author3=Bailey, J.M.|title=Gender Nonconformity and Psychological Distress in Lesbians and Gay Men|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|year=2006|volume=35|pages=685–97|doi=10.1007/s10508-006-9108-5|issue=6|pmid=17109224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual orientation==

===General===
A great deal of research has been conducted on the relationship between CGN and sexual orientation. Gay men often report being feminine boys, and lesbian women often report being masculine girls. In men, CGN is a strong predictor of sexual orientation in adulthood, but this relationship is not as well understood in women.&lt;ref name="Baumeister"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Friedman 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dunne|first=Michael P.|author2=Bailey, J.M.|author3=Kirk, K.M.|author4=Martin, N.G.|title=The Subtlety of Sex-Atypicality|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|year=2000|volume=29|issue=6|doi=10.1023/A:1002002420159|pages=549–65|pmid=11100262}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bailey|first=J.M.|author2=Zucker, K.J.|title=Childhood Sex-typed Behavior and Sexual Orientation: A Conceptual Analysis and Quantitative Review|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=1995|volume=21|pages=43–55|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.31.1.43|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women with CAH reported more male typical play behaviours and showed less heterosexual interest.&lt;ref name="Hines 2004 75–81"/&gt;

The [[Fraternal birth order and male sexual orientation|fraternal birth order effect]] is a well documented phenomenon that predicts that a man's odds of being homosexual increase 33-48% with each older brother that the man has. Research has shown that the mother develops an [[immune system|immune response]] due to blood factor incompatibility with male fetuses. With each male fetus, the mother's immune system responds more strongly to what it perceives as a threat.  The mother’s immune response can disrupt typical prenatal hormones, like testosterone, which have been implicated in both childhood gender nonconformity and adult sexual orientation.

Bem proposes a theory on the relationship between childhood gender non-conformity, which he refers to as the "exotic become erotic."&lt;ref name="Bem 1996 320–335"/&gt; Bem argues that biological factors, such as [[Prenatal hormones and sexual orientation|prenatal hormones]], [[gene]]s and [[neuroanatomy]], predispose children to behave in ways that do not conform to their sex assigned at birth.  Gender nonconforming children will often prefer opposite-sex playmates and activities.  These become alienated from their same-sex peer group.  As children enter [[adolescence]] "the exotic becomes erotic" where dissimilar and unfamiliar same-sex peers produces [[arousal]], and the general arousal become eroticized over time. Bem's theory does not seem to fit female homosexuality.  Perhaps, males who demonstrate gender nonconformity experience more alienation and separation from same-sex peers, because cultural constructions of masculinity are generally more rigid than femininity.&lt;ref name="Bem 1996 320–335"/&gt;

===Biases in retrospective studies===
Although childhood gender nonconformity has been correlated to sexual orientation in adulthood, there may be a [[reporting bias]] that has influenced the results.  Many of the studies on the link between CGN and sexual orientation are conducted [[Retrospective cohort study|retrospectively]], meaning that adults are asked to reflect on their behaviors as children.  Adults will often reinterpret their childhood behaviors in terms of their present conceptualizations of their [[gender identity]] and sexual orientation.  Gay men and lesbian women who endorsed a [[biological determinism|biological perspective]] on gender and sexual orientation tended to report more instances of childhood gender nonconformity and explain these behaviors as early genetic or biological manifestations of their sexual orientation.  Lesbian women who endorse a [[social constructionism|social constructionist]] perspective on gender identity often interpret their childhood GNC as an awareness of [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] norms and rejection of gender roles.  Heterosexual men are more likely to downplay GNC, attributing their behaviors to being sensitive or artistic. Retrospective reinterpretation does not invalidate studies linking GNC and sexual orientation, but awareness of how present conceptualization of gender identity and sexual orientation can affect perceptions of childhood may be considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gottschalk|first=Lorene|title=Same-Sex Sexuality and Childhood Gender Non-Conformity: A Spurious Connection|journal=Journal of Gender Studies|year=2003|volume=12|issue=1|pages=35–50|doi=10.1080/0958923032000067808}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender dysphoria==
Children with [[gender dysphoria]], also known as gender identity disorder (GID), exhibit the typical gender nonconforming patterns of behaviors, such as a preference for toys, playmates, clothing, and play-styles that are typically associated with the opposite-sex.  Children with GID will sometimes display disgust toward their own genitals or changes that occur in [[puberty]] (e.g. facial hair or [[menstruation]]).&lt;ref name="Langer 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Langer|first=Susan J.|author2=Martin, James I.|title=How Dresses Can Make You Mentally Ill: Examining Gender Identity Disorder in Children|journal=Child and Adolescent Social Work Journal|date=February 2004|volume=21|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A diagnosis of GID in children requires evidence of discomfort, confusion, or aversion to the gender roles associated with the child's genetic sex.  Children do not necessarily have to express a desire to be the opposite-sex, but it is still taken in consideration when making a [[diagnosis|diagnoses]].&lt;ref name="Langer 2004"/&gt;

Some advocates have argued that a [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-IV]] diagnosis legitimizes the experiences of these children, making it easier to rally around a medically defined disorder, in order to raise public awareness, and garner funding for future research and therapies.  Diagnoses of [[gender identity disorder in children]] (GIDC) remains controversial, as many argue that the label pathologizes behaviors and cognitions that fall within the normal variation within gender.  The [[Social stigma|stigma]] associated with mental health disorders may do more harm than good.&lt;ref name="Langer 2004"/&gt;

==Parental reactions==
Parents with gender non-conforming children may not know where to turn to express their feelings. Many parents accept their child’s choice but are more concerned for the overall well being of the child. In some cases families are not accepting of their child’s non-conformity, typically lashing out with punishment grounded on [[homophobia]] and [[sexism]]. Regardless of the stance a parent decides to take on gender non-conformity, it will affect the child and the child’s relationship with the family.

Transphobia can occur when gender nonconforming children are met with others who do not understand or accept what they are going through. Dr. Diane Ehrensaft states that, "Transphobia is the anxieties, prejudices, aspersion, aggression, and hatred cast on individuals who do not accept the gender assigned to them at birth but instead play outside that definition of self or perhaps any binary categorizations of gender, possibly to the extent of altering their body."&lt;ref name=Ehrensaft2011&gt;Ehrensaft, Diane, PhD. "Boys Will Be Girls, Girls will Be Boys: Children Affect Parents as Parents Affect Children in Gender Nonconformity." Psychoanalytic Psychology 28.4 (2011): 528-48. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Transphobia can become a serious conflict within the family and can damage the relationship the child has with his or her family.

Parents who recognize that they have gender non-conforming children sometimes experience a feeling of loss, shock, denial, anger, and despair.&lt;ref&gt;Children's National Medical Center. If You Are Concerned About Your Childs Gender Behavior. N.p.: Children's National Medical Center, n.d. Children's National Medical Center. Web. 31 Oct. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; These feelings typically subside as a parent learns more about gender nonconformity. However, there are families that remain unaccepting of gender nonconformity and correlate it to psychological or social problems. Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist Jean Malpas says, "Some react very negatively and the gender nonconformity can become a significant source of conflict between parents and a damaging source of disconnection between parent and child."&lt;ref&gt;Malpas, Jean. "Between Pink and Blue: A Multi-Dimensional Family Approach to Gender Nonconforming Children and Their Families." Family Process 50.4 (2011): 453-470. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Diane Ehrensaft cites that there are three family types that can affect the outcome of a child's gender nonconformity: transformers, transphobics, and transporters.&lt;ref name=Ehrensaft2011/&gt; Transformers: Transformers are parents that are comfortable in supporting their child in their gender variant journey and can easily identify their child as a separate person. Ehrensaft states, "These parents will stand a good chance of overcoming whatever transphobic reactions may reside within them to evolve into parents who both meet their child where he or she is and become an advocate for their gender nonconforming child in the outside world."&lt;ref name=Ehrensaft2011/&gt; Transphobics: Transphobic parents are not comfortable in their own gender, and may not understand that gender is fluid.  Transphobic parents may feel their child is an extension of themselves and respond negatively when their child is faced with his or her own adversity.  Ehrensaft believes these parents deny their child with an excess of negativity and transphobic "reactivity" this allows the child no room for nonconformity and undermines the love the parent claims to have for the child. 'Transporters: Transporters are parents that appear to be completely accepting of their child's gender nonconformity but on the inside have doubts about whether or not it is an authentic conformity. Transporter parents may say things like, "It's just a phase," or "he or she will grow out of it."

== Peer reactions ==
Once children reach school age, girls who are considered "tomboys" and boys who are considered to be more "sensitive" than their gender typical peers, are more likely to face challenges during childhood than their gender-typical counterparts. It is possible that their nonconformity goes unnoticed, however it is more likely that they fall victim to bullying and harassment when they reach school age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Haldeman | first1 = Douglas C | year = 2000 | title = Gender atypical youth: Clinical and social issues | url = | journal = School Psychology Review | volume = 29 | issue = 2| page = 192 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study on gender atypical fifteen year olds, atypical males self-report being lonelier, bullied more, less likely to have male friends, and be in "greater distress" than gender-typical males in the same demographic.&lt;ref&gt;Young, Robert, and Helen Sweeting. "Adolescent bullying, relationships, psychological well-being, and gender-atypical behavior: A gender diagnosticity approach." ''Sex Roles'' 50, no. 7-8 (2004): 525-537.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Needs of gender nonconforming children and families==

There is still controversy regarding the best approach for gender nonconforming children, but as gender nonconformity becomes more widely accepted many parents and professionals have identified things that gender variant or gender nonconforming children need to easily adjust to their transformation.&lt;ref name=Riley2013&gt;Reilly, Elizabeth A., Gomathi Sitharthan, Lindy Clemson, and Milton Diamond. "Recognizing the Needs of Gender-variant Children and Their Parents." Sex Education 13.6 (2013): 644-59. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Parents have suggested that their children need the ability to discuss their gender non-conformity freely with their parent, to be loved throughout their transformation, and to be permitted to make choices regarding their gender on their own. They have also suggested a peer support team and supportive counseling in addition to support from their school and schools administrators and authorities.&lt;ref name=Riley2013/&gt;

Parents must be mindful of a child's need for parent expressions of acceptance and validation. If not validated a child may begin sharing less with their parent and more with friends, this could lead to the parent thinking the gender nonconformity was just a brief phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Menvielle | first1 = Edgardo J. | last2 = Tuerk | first2 = Catherine | year = 2002 | title = A Support Group for Parents of Gender-Nonconforming Boys | url = | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry | volume = 41 | issue = 8| pages = 1010–013 | doi=10.1097/00004583-200208000-00021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disclosure is also a very important to a family when raising a gender non-conforming child. Parents need to consider whom to talk to about their child and what type of information they decide to share. Other members of the family must also be prepared to make decisions regarding what to say and who to say it to.&lt;ref&gt;"Parent Considerations." Gender Spectrum. Gender Spectrum, n.d. Web. http://www.genderspectrum.org.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Regarding their own needs, parents have suggested that they need information regarding gender nonconforming children that can better assist them and their child in making their transition. Additionally, parents have stated they need increased education on gender nonconforming children, and support from surrounding friends and family to help build parental confidence. Parents have also suggested they need counseling to help provide direction, support from medical professionals and peers, and access to transgender people to help provide them with a positive portrayal of transgender communities.&lt;ref name=Riley2013/&gt;

An article in The Sunday Times, 25 November 2018, by journalist, [[Andrew Gilligan]] reports criticism of Trans Groups for large increases in the number of child referrals to the UK National Health Service specialist service dealing with Transgender children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk|title=Trans groups under fire for huge rise in child referrals|last=Gilligan|first=Andrew|date=25 November 2018|work=The Sunday Times|access-date=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinical treatments for gender dysphoria==
It is important for clinicians to identify children whose gender dysphoria will persist into adolescence and those who outgrow their gender identity disorder (GID) or gender dysphoria diagnosis. In instances where the child’s distress and discomfort continues clinicians will sometimes prescribe [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH) to delay puberty.&lt;ref name="Wallien 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wallien|first=M.S.C|author2=Cohen-Kettenis, P.T.|title=Psychosexual Outcome of Gender-Dysphoric Children|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry|year=2008|doi=10.1097/CHI.0b013e31818956b9|volume=47|issue=12|pages=1413–1423}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Identifying stable and persistent cases of GID may reduce the number of surgeries and hormonal interventions individuals undergo in adolescence and adulthood. Gender identity disorders persist into adolescence in about 27% of children with GID diagnoses.&lt;ref name="Wallien 2008"/&gt;

Diagnosis and treatment of GID in children can be distressing for the parents, which can further exacerbate distress in their child.  Parents had difficulties accepting their child's desire to be the opposite sex, and are resistant to children wanting to alter their bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hill|first=Darryl B.|author2=Rozanski, C.|author3=Carfagnini, J.|author4=Willoughby, B.|title=Gender Identity Disorders in Childhood and Adolescence|journal=Journal of Psychology &amp; Human Sexuality|year=2006|volume=17|issue=3|pages=7–34|doi=10.1300/J056v17n03_02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supportive professionals===

Some professionals, including Dr. Edgardo J. Menvielle of the Children's National Medical Center, who has specialized in this area in his clinical practice,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childrensnational.org/FindADoctor/DoctorProfile.aspx?DoctorId=325&amp;Name=Edgardo%20Menvielle *Edgardo J. Menvielle, MD, MSHS of the Children's National Medical Center]&lt;/ref&gt; believe that the proper response to gender variant behavior is supportive therapy aimed at helping the child deal with any social issues which may arise due to homophobia / transphobia. These professionals believe that attempts to alter these behaviors, and/or whatever mechanism is responsible for their expression, are generally ineffective and do more harm than good. While not universally advocating for what childhood transgender advocates refer to as full social transition, the CNMC model generally supports allowing a child to express cross gendered interests at home in an age appropriate fashion.  Other professionals associated with a supportive model include Dr. [[Norman Spack]] of Children's Hospital Boston,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childrenshospital.org/clinicalservices/Site2280/mainpageS2280P4.html Gender Management Service (GeMS) Clinic at Children's Hospital in Boston]&lt;/ref&gt;  Catherine Tuerk, MA, RN, Herbert Schreier, MD (Children's Hospital Oakland), and Ellen C. Perrin, MD of the Center for Children with Special Needs (CCSN) at TUFTS. Rosenburg (2002) recommends a parent-centered approach that helps parents learn to accept and support their child's identity and help the child to work through the issues surrounding identity, without trying to eliminate gender-variant behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosenberg|first=M.|title=Children with gender identity issues and their parents in individual and group treatment|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry|year=2002|volume=41|pages=619–21|doi=10.1097/00004583-200205000-00020|pmid=12014795|issue=5|last2=Jellinek|first2=Michael S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reparative therapy===

Other professionals, typified by Dr. [[Kenneth Zucker]], the Head of the Gender Identity Service, Child, Youth, and Family Program and Psychologist-in-Chief at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, believe that behavior modification to extinguish gender variance is the appropriate response to cross gender interests. Dr. Zucker asks the rhetorical question of whether it would be ethical to treat an African American child who wishes to identify as Caucasian with cosmetic surgeries to facilitate this identity, though his critics point out that gender identity is completely non-analogous to ethnic identity. Dr. Zucker's choice as one of the professionals creating the new DSM entry on GID has elicited a firestorm of controversy in the LGBTQ community. Dr. Zucker has expressed the opinion that if his therapies also occasionally prevent a homosexual outcome, they are a valid parental choice.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} He was also criticized for statements suggesting that children with nonnormative gender might be autistic and hyperfocusing on gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Harley |first1=Nicola |title=Children who believe they are transgender 'could have autism', says controversial expert |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/12/children-believe-transgender-could-have-autism-says-controversial/ |website=The Telegraph |date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no one universal set of [[behavior modification|behavioral interventions]] designed to reduce stress in children with GID.  Zucker (2000) asserts that childhood gender dysphoria is caused by "tolerating or encouraging cross-gender behaviour or by intentionally raising [[androgyny|androgynous]] children."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zucker|first=K.J|title=Gender identity disorder|journal=Handbook of developmental psycholpathology.|year=200|volume=2nd ed.|pages=671–86|doi=10.1007/978-1-4615-4163-9_36}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He advises that behavioural treatments should aim to discourage gender-variant behaviours that have inadvertently been reinforced in the past.  In contrast, [[reparative therapy]] for adults is generally discouraged by the ethics guidelines of major U.S. mental health organizations, including the [[American Psychological Association]], [[American Psychiatric Association]], the [[American Counseling Association]]. There is no such consensus around such therapies for children.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

{{Communication}}

'''Communication studies''' or '''communication sciences''' is an [[academic discipline]] that deals with processes of [[human communication]]. There are three types of communication: ''verbal'', involving listening to a person to understand the meaning of a message; ''written'', in which a message is read; and ''nonverbal'' communication involving observing a person and inferring meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Different Types of Communication and Channels|url=https://new.edu/resources/different-types-of-communication-and-channels--5|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310233148/https://new.edu/resources/different-types-of-communication-and-channels--5|website=New Charter University|archivedate=March 10, 2016|accessdate=February 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discipline encompasses a range of topics, from face-to-face conversation to [[mass media]] outlets, such as [[television broadcasting]].

Communication studies shares with [[cultural studies]] an interest in how messages are interpreted through the [[political]], [[cultural]], [[economic]], [[semiotic]], [[hermeneutic]], and [[social]] dimensions of their contexts. In [[political economics]], communication studies examines how the politics of [[ownership]] affects content. Quantitative communication studies examines [[statistics]] in order to help substantiate claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Statistical Methods for Communication Science|last = Hayes|first = Andrew F.|publisher = Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc|year = 2005|isbn = |location = |pages = 8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caffarel-Serra|first=Carmen|last2=Ortega|first2=Félix|last3=Gaitán|first3=Juan-Antonio|date=2018-07-01|title=Communication research in Spain: Weaknesses, threats, strengths and opportunities|url=https://doi.org/10.3916/C56-2018-06|journal=Comunicar|language=es|volume=26|issue=56|doi=10.3916/c56-2018-06|issn=1134-3478}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Main|History of communication studies}}
Communication science began in earnest when students of [[Wilbur Schramm]]—the founder of the [[Institute for Communications Research]] at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|University of Illinois]]—namely [[David Berlo]], came to [[Michigan State University]] and founded the first General Communication Arts department in the early 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

It is still one of Michigan State's strongest programs and nationally ranked in the study of human communication.

== Scope ==
Communication studies integrates aspects of both social sciences and the humanities. As a [[social science]], the discipline overlaps with [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[anthropology]], [[biology]], [[political science]], [[economics]], and [[public policy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citejournal|last=Calhoun|first=Craig|date=2011|title=Communication as Social Science (And More) |url=https://www.mcgill.ca/ahcs/files/ahcs/communication_as_social_science_and_more.pdf |journal=International Journal of Communication |publisher=McGill University |volume=5 |pages=1479–1496}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a humanities perspective, communication is concerned with rhetoric and persuasion (traditional graduate programs in communication studies trace their history to the rhetoricians of Ancient Greece). Humanities approaches to communication often overlap with history, philosophy, english, and cultural studies.

===In the United States===
Undergraduate curricula aim to prepare students to interrogate the nature of communication in society, and the development of communication as a specific field.&lt;ref&gt;{{citejournal|last=Morreale|first=Sherwyn|last2=Osborn|first2=Michael|last3=Pearson|first3=Judy|date=2000|title=Why Communication is Important: A Rationale for the Centrality of the Study of Communication|url=https://www.natcom.org/uploadedFiles/More_Scholarly_Resources/Chairs_Corner/Making_the_Case_for_and_Advancing_the_Discipline/PDF-ATD-JACA-Why_Communication_is_Important_%20Rationale_for_Centrality_of_the_Study_of_Communication.pdf|journal=Journal of the Association for Communication Administration|publisher=National Communication Association|volume=29|pages=1–25|access-date=2016-09-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170105235213/https://www.natcom.org/uploadedFiles/More_Scholarly_Resources/Chairs_Corner/Making_the_Case_for_and_Advancing_the_Discipline/PDF-ATD-JACA-Why_Communication_is_Important_%20Rationale_for_Centrality_of_the_Study_of_Communication.pdf|archive-date=2017-01-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Communication Association]] (NCA) recognizes nine distinct but often overlapping sub-disciplines within the broader communication discipline: [[technical communication|technology]], critical-cultural, [[health communication|health]], [[intercultural communication|intercultural]], [[interpersonal communication|interpersonal]]-small group, mass communication, [[organizational communication|organizational]], [[political communication|political]], rhetorical, and [[environmental communication]]. Students take courses in these subject areas. Other programs and courses often integrated in communication programs include [[journalism]], [[film criticism]], [[theatre]], [[public relations]], [[political science]] (e.g., political campaign strategies, public speaking, effects of media on elections), as well as [[radio]], [[television]], [[computer-mediated communication]], [[film production]], and [[new media]].

=== In Canada ===
With the early influence of federal institutional inquiries, notably the 1951 [[Massey Commission]], which "investigated the overall state of culture in Canada,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/massey-commission-emc|title=Massey Commission {{!}} The Canadian Encyclopedia|website=www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; the study of communication in Canada has frequently focused on the development of a cohesive national culture, and on infrastructural empires of social and material circulation. Although influenced by the American Communication tradition and [[British Cultural Studies]], Communication studies in Canada has been more directly oriented toward the state and the policy apparatus, for example the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]]. Influential thinkers from the Canadian communication tradition include [[Harold Innis]], [[Marshall McLuhan]], [[Florian Sauvageau]], [[Gertrude Joch Robinson|Gertrude Robinson]], [[Marc Raboy]], [[Dallas Smythe]], [[Gail Guthrie Valaskakis]] and [[George Grant (philosopher)|George Grant]].

The '''''Confutatio Augustana''''' was the [[Roman Catholic]] refutation ([[confutation]]) of the ''[[Augsburg Confession]]'', often referred to in the theological literature as simply the ''Confutatio''.

On 25 June 1530 the Protestant [[Imperial States]] of the realm met at the [[Diet of Augsburg]], and presented [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] with the Augsburg Confession, largely the work of [[Philipp Melanchthon]] setting out the doctrines and practices of the church in the [[Protestation at Speyer|Protestant principalities]]. The emperor commissioned the papal theologians to prepare a response. An initial version of the ''Confutatio'' was rejected by the emperor, as excessively polemic and verbose. In formulating the ''Confutatio'', the lead was taken by Johann Eck. On 3 August 1530, the final version was read at the Diet. The ''Confutatio'' clearly rejected the statements of the Augsburg Confession, and called for a return to the Roman doctrine.

In other respects, however, the ''Confutatio'' found common ground with the Augsburg Confession. Emperor Charles V refused to hand over the text to the Protestants, unless they agreed not to respond, which they refused. But the Protestants had transcribed it as it was read. Melanchthon responded with the ''[[Apology of the Augsburg Confession]]'', completed in 1531, but not presented to the emperor.

== Properties of leather ==
[[Leather]] is a highly sought after material due to its resistance to tearing, flexing and puncture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.muirhead.co.uk/OurLeather/Leather-Properties.aspx|title=Leather Properties and Characteristics|work=muirhead.co.uk|accessdate=25 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also a good insulator of heat and prevents the passage of air flow. In order for skins to be turned into leather they must go through the process known as [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]] to stabilize the collagen for the duration of the manufacture. However, leather is unique in that it contains more than just the hide itself. It also contains all of the materials used in the manufacturing process which must be known for the proper conservation and preservation of leather objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jcms-journal.com/articles/10.5334/jcms.3972/|title=The Degredation &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93; and Conservation of Leather|first=Vicki|last=Dirksen|date=1 November 1997|publisher=|volume=3|accessdate=25 June 2016|via=www.jcms-journal.com|doi=10.5334/jcms.3972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manufacture of leather===
In Prehistoric times, the use of skins or leather in the early history of man goes well beyond food to include clothing, shelter and other purposes. The first use of animal skins is attributed to ''Australopithecus habilis'' who is noted as roaming East Africa some two million years ago and possessed a diet with significant meat consumption. Artifacts from this time indicate the use of a chipped stone used cutting through thick hides. This tool is use is attributed to the increased use of additional stone tools that will be used throughout the history of man. It is suggested from the bones found at the sites of ''Australopithecine'' that the joints of larger animals were butchered with this tool from the carcass and dragged on the skin to their dwelling places for multiple uses. Evidence from the hominid, ''Pithecanthropoid'', shows the use of the a coup-de-point tool for butchering and skinning, and that groups would live in large, tent shelters made from spreading skins over wooden frameworks. Skins are also believed to have been running along the sides of shelters in rough bundles. The skins used in these structures are believed to have been warmed by fire which created a curing effect by drying the skins slowly. It is suggested that special skinning and scraping tools were created after witnessing this natural progression of the skins, which spread the skin's fats across the hide.  This process is considered by some the first creation of leather nearly a million years ago.

During the Medieval era tanning was considered a skilled trade and was second to wool as a textile fabric. During this period the first job of a tanner was to wash hides free of blood, manure and other curing materials before being rehydrated. To accomplish this task a nearby river or stream was often used. Other methods for this task would include trampling on the hides with feet or pounding on the material with hammers. Upon this task's completion, the hides were then set with the hair side up to remove the hair without damaging the surface. To loosen the hair it was common to either let the leather become putrid or by speeding up the process with liquors such as stale beer, fermented barley or mulberry, dung or bryony leaves. Soaking skins in liquors prepared with wood ash or lime would accomplish a similar effect. When the skin was deemed adequetely prepared it would be stretched over a beam and scraped.  The hair side would be scraped with a blunt, single edge unhairing knife and the flesh with a sharper, two-edge fleshing knife. The process would continue with another soaking and scraping with a blunt scudding knife. The next step in the process was to wash the skin further and then add an alkaline bating to remove excess lime and create a softer, finer grain. After repeating this step, the skin would be laid over the beam once more to remove any of the waste products that were released in the process often referenced as slime. After the skin was considered cleaned and prepared it was ready for the tanning process. This would occur by placing the skin in a pit on top of ground tanning material, then covered by additional ground tanning material, and the process would be repeated until the pit was nearly full.  Tanning materials were dependent on the local landscape and were most often tree matter (oak, birch, willow, spruce, etc.). Upon filling the pit with the skins, the pit would be filled with cold water or another mixture and the skins were left to sit for close to a year. When a tanner judged that the leather was sufficiently tanned, the skins were removed, rinsed, and smoothed with a knife before being slowly dried in a dark space. At the point that the leather is dried, it is sold to a currier for additional processing.&lt;ref&gt;Kite, Marion and Thomson, Roy. 2006. Conservation of Leather and related materials. Oxford: Elsevier. 73-77&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes of deterioration to leather==
[[Acid Hydrolysis]] is the breakage of bonds by hydronium ions. Hydronium ions are contained within the liquid form of water and cause the breakage of bonds within ionic structures. When an acid is dissolved in water it separates the hydrogen ion from the other ions of the acid and the hydrogen reacts with the water molecules to form the hydronium ions causing the aforementioned hydrolysis. With the presence of an acid in this reaction this process is known as acid hydrolysis. The most commonly agent of acid hydrolysis found in historical leathers is attributed to sulfuric acid, which is absorbed from industrial pollution as sulfur dioxide. In the presence of sunlight, the sulfur dioxide is converted into sulfur trioxide and then absorbed by the tannins in the leather.  The trioxide is then hydrated into sulfuric acid, dissolving in the present moisture of the leather creating the hydronium ions. It is then from these hydronium ions that internal links are broken among the leather molecules. Breakdowns include a reduction in bonds between amino acids and collagen, and additional breakdown may occur from the tannins and acids inherently present in the leather which may increase the risks and severity of acid hydrolysis. Heat, moisture and a low pH are also contributing factors in this process.

[[Oxidation]]  is the loss of an electron among leather, most often attributed to oxygen as the oxidizing agent or molecule of electron loss. Oxidation may also occur due to the effects of light and heat.

Metals that act as catalysts of oxidation are the greatest concern in leather deterioration. Iron is the most common contaminant found in the manufacture of leather and can act as a catalyst for oxidation and eventually lead to breakdown of molecules by hydrolysis.

Heat is the transference of kinetic energy to the leather. When this occurs, the internal molecules of the leather increase in speed and begin colliding with one another at a rate so fast that the bonds of the leather molecules are no longer capable of remaining intact and thus break. The effect of heat is most often associated with long term exposure and rapid fluctuations in temperature on the leather. When exposed to heat in either condition, leather may lose the ability to absorb water from the air and the result is a hard or brittle state, this is referred to as hysteresis. This is due to the interconnected nature of external heat and moisture content in leather. Water: see the above relationship of heat and moisture content in leather

[[Red rot]] is the degradation of leather when it reacts with sulfur dioxide or other air pollutants. Objects affected by red rot go through several stages. In the early stages of red rot, leather will exhibit a pinkish color that becomes progressively darker as the decay progresses. The degradation and disintegration of red rot cannot be reversed.&lt;ref&gt;Waterer, J. W. 1971. A Guide to the Conservation and Restoration of Objects Made Wholly or in Part of Leather . New York: Drake Publishers, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to preserve the object in this altered state the two most significant steps for preservation are to store the object in a controlled air environment and to place where minimal handling will occur.

==Principles of care, storage and display==
To ensure the longevity of leather objects these are the proper steps that should be taken toward preservation

===Display and storage===
When the primary focus of an object's future is storage, the first concern is to ensure that the object is in a stable condition where it can be handled, with aesthetics as a low priority. The handler of the object should be aware of the conditions for display and storage and changes, if any, in location needs should be addressed. The relative humidity of any storage location should be monitored and kept below 65% to prevent mold growth as well keeping good circulation and temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/resources-ressources/ccinotesicc/8-1-eng.aspx |title=Removing Mould from Leather - CCI Notes 8/1 |website=Cci-icc.gc.ca |date=2013-09-17 |accessdate=2016-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most leather conservators focus their efforts on identifying the proper methods for the storage and display of leather objects because it is reversible and causes no direct physical harm to the object.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Conservation Institute. 1992. "Care of alum, vegetable, and mineral tanned leather." CCI Notes, 8(2), 1-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Levels of treatment===
The first principle in determining treatment is to require that all conservation be reversible, appropriate and the least invasive possible. It should be the intent of the conservation to place the object in a stable condition with the least amount of future deterioration. The simplest form of this process can be found in moving an object to a more stable environment. An example of a minor concern would stabilizing loose sections of leather or a flaking surface of the material. Several solutions could be utilized from application of surface finishes or inpainting of damage. Careful consideration should be given to ensure the selected method is the best conservation practice. On the more severe side of the spectrum of conservation is full restoration.  This would mean that a most if not all of the leather covering of an object would need to be replaced.  The context in which an object is to be displayed is an important factor in determining what degree of repairs should take place. A used workman's pouch or bag would not require a new condition look as it would alter the object's interpretation, dependent on location and history.

===Handling===
The degree of handling and access will play a large role in the decisions of care and treatment, as well as display locations. If an object is in a position that is highly susceptible to touching or handling by the public, it should either be moved away to a newer location away from open display or staff should be prepared for the object's frequent repair or eventual replacement. In most cases, if an object's condition is to a point where it may be lost forever due to continued exposure, it should be properly stored away in the proper environment and have a minimal future handling as possible.

===Finish===
A finish or dressing is most often applied for aesthetic reasons rather than conservation. When a dressing is applied it may brighten an object and give a new sheen to the leather without ever contributing to the preservation of the object, in some instances this may lead to conservation problems. Therefore, any applied finishes should be carefully considered and studied before placing on an object for conservation. Dressing or finishes may absorb dirt creating a tacky surface. Some may contain inappropriate ingredients or over application may lead to spewing. Spewing is the rise of white deposits of free fatty acids to the leather surface which is often mistaken for mold.
Dressings should never be applied to painted leather of any kind. The oils and fats can permanent discoloration and softening of the varnishes. Application of this kind may not happen immediately and should not lead to a belief that it will be successful in the following months or years. Previous removal of over-varnish utilized the same materials as the original varnish, which led to stripping the entire varnish coat. In modern leather preservation the original surface coating may be stripped completely off to provide a uniform replacement finish. It is not advised for this method on historical pieces but is highly appropriate on reproductions and modern leather-works as they may prolong the life of the material without compromising the historical value or integrity.&lt;ref&gt;Kite, Marion and Thomson, Roy. 2006. Conservation of Leather and related materials. Oxford: Elsevier. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation and restoration treatments and techniques==
There are a number of very specific techniques used to conserve and restore leathers.&lt;ref&gt;Kite, Marion and Thomson, Roy. 2006. Conservation of Leather and related materials. Oxford: Elsevier. 124-126&lt;/ref&gt;
*Consolidation - Consolidation is an option for leather that has suffered extensive degradation and the leather surface needs to be reestablished to create a firm surface for repairs and/or cleaning. Common consolidants include Paraloid B67 in [[white spirit]], Klucel G, Pliantex (no longer commercially produced, SC6000, Lascaux wax-resin, and [[Gelatin]].
*Dry cleaning - Removal of dust, which may cause tiny abrasions, should be done by using a brush vacuum. If more extensive dry cleaning is necessary brushes or sponges maybe used. Brushes should be used with care as they may cause similar abrasive issues.&lt;ref&gt;Storch, P. S. 1987. "Curatorial care and the handling of skin materials, Part 1: Tanned objects." Conservation Notes, 17, 1-4.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Humidification]] - Humidification is the process of adding the appropriate level of humidity to the leather, without wetting, in an effort to reshape and/or restore the object to its desired condition. During humidification special care should be given to ensure that the object never reaches a wet state, as well as, making certain that objects are not left in areas that may contribute to a quick change in temperature due to the shrinkage of leather and its potential damage.  Because damaged leather may be more sensitive to heat, objects should avoid any exposure to heat which may be present near windows. Because leather is more susceptible to mold, it should be regularly monitored during this process. Heat treatments should always be avoided while leather is in the humidification process. 
*Molding - Molding is the process of adding a fill to the a spot in the leather to return it to its original state.  A common fill known as Beva 371 can be painted to match the tone of the original.
*Proprietary leather cleaners - Commercially produced cleaners are commonplace with leather care but can have negative effects if not closely researched or familiar with the ingredients.
*Wet cleaning and solvent cleaning - The primary purpose of any wet cleaning on leather is to remove surface soiling and not to soak the material.  By soaking the leather in water, additional issues may arise such as distortion, discoloration, hardening, movement of salts and tannins, and tidemarks. Using cotton swabs with common solutions is a safe and regular practice in cleaning leather. Common solutions used are mixtures of water with ammonia, white spirit, alcohol or detergents. White spirit or mineral spirits is also a suitable solution for wet cleaning. Dependent on the material and its construction, any mixture used should be prepared with caution and the appropriate ratio.

==Conservation and restoration materials==
There are a number of very specific materials that are used in the conservation and restoration of leather.&lt;ref&gt;Kite, Marion and Thomson, Roy. 2006. Conservation of Leather and related materials. Oxford: Elsevier. 121-123&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="49581">The '''Conservation and restoration of photographs''' is the study of the physical care and treatment of photographic materials. It covers both efforts undertaken by [[photograph conservator]]s, [[librarian]]s, [[archivist]]s, and museum [[curator]]s who manage photograph collections at a variety of [[cultural heritage]] institutions, as well as steps taken to preserve collections of personal and family photographs. It is an umbrella term that includes both preventative preservation activities such as environmental control and conservation techniques that involve treating individual items. Both preservation and conservation require an in-depth understanding of how photographs are made, and the causes and prevention of deterioration. Conservator-restorers use this knowledge to treat photographic materials, stabilizing them from further deterioration, and sometimes restoring them for aesthetic purposes.

While conservation can improve the appearance of a photograph, image quality is not the primary purpose of conservation. Conservators will try to improve the visual appearance of a photograph as much as possible, while also ensuring its long-term survival and adhering the profession's ethical standards. Photograph conservators also play a role in the field of connoisseurship. Their understanding of the physical object and its structure makes them uniquely suited to a technical examination of the photograph, which can reveal clues about how, when, and where it was made.

Photograph preservation is distinguished from [[Digital photograph restoration|''digital'' or ''optical restoration'']], which is concerned with creating and editing a digital copy of the original image rather than treating the original photographic material. Photograph preservation does not normally include moving image materials, which by their nature require a very different approach. [[Film preservation]] concerns itself with these materials.

==Overview of Photographs and Photographic Processes==
Physical photographs usually consist of three components: the final image material (e.g. silver, platinum, dyes, or pigments), the transparent binder layer (e.g. albumen, collodion, or gelatin) in which the final image material is suspended, and the primary support (e.g. paper, glass, metal, or plastic). These components affect the susceptibility of photos to damage and the preservation and conservation methods required.&lt;ref&gt;American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC), ''Caring for Your Treasures'', accessed August 12, 2011, http://www.conservation-us.org/_data/n_0001/resources/live/photographs.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; Photograph preservation and conservation are also concerned with the negatives from which photographic prints are made. There are two basic types of negatives: glass plate and film-based.

{{Main|List of photographic processes}}

'''1816: [[Heliography]]'''&lt;br /&gt;
The first person who succeeded in producing a paper negative of the camera image was [[Nicéphore Niépce|Joseph Nicephore Niepce]]. He coated pewter plates with bitumen (an asphaltic varnish that hardens with exposure to light) and put them in a [[Camera Obscura]]. After exposure to sunlight for a long time, the parts that were exposed to light became hard and the parts that were not could be washed off with lavender oil.

'''1837: [[Daguerreotype]]'''&lt;br /&gt;
The daguerreotype process (named after [[Louis Daguerre|Louis Jacques Mande Daguerre]]) produces a unique image, as there is no negative created. After coating a copper plate with light-sensitive silver iodide, the plate is exposed to an image for over 20 minutes and then treated with fumes from heated mercury. The longer the exposure to light, the more mercury fumes are adsorbed by the silver iodide. After the plate is washed with salt water, the image appears, reversed. This was the earliest photographic process to gain popularity in America.&lt;ref&gt;Debbie Hess Norris, "The Proper Storage and Display of a Photographic Collection," ''The Book and Paper Annual'' 2 (1983), accessed August 12, 2011, http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/v02/bp02-08.html.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was used until around 1860.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Albright and Monique Fischer, ''Types of Photographs'', Preservation Leaflets (Northeast Document Conservation Center), accessed August 12, 2011, http://www.nedcc.org/resources/leaflets/5Photographs/02TypesOfPhotos.php.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1839: [[Salt print]]'''&lt;br /&gt;
This was the dominant form of paper print until Albumen prints were introduced in 1850. Salt prints were made using both paper and glass negatives.

'''1841: [[Calotype]]'''&lt;br /&gt;
[[Henry Fox Talbot|William Henry Fox Talbot]] invented the negative-positive system of photography commonly used today. He first developed the Talbotype, which used silver chloride to sensitize paper. After improving the process by using silver iodide, he renamed it Calotype. The process could produce many positive images, but they were not as sharp because they were printed on fibrous paper rather than glass.

'''1842: [[Cyanotype]] (Ferro-plusiate, Blue process)'''&lt;br /&gt;
This process forms blue-colored images through a reaction to iron salts. [[John Herschel]] studied it in order to reproduce his complicated math formulas and memos. Other processes that fall into this category include Kallitype, Vandyketype, and Platinum printing.

'''1850: [[Albumen print]]'''&lt;br /&gt;
This process, introduced by [[Louis Désiré Blanquart-Evrard]], was the most common kind of print in the latter half of the nineteenth century. Beautiful sepia gradation images were created by using albumen and silver chloride. The surfaces of prints made with this process were glossy because of the egg whites which were layered heavily to prevent the originally thin prints from curling, cracking, or tearing easily. This type of print was especially common for studio portraits and landscape or stereoviews.&lt;ref&gt;Norris, "Proper Storage and Display."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1851: [[Collodion process|Wet collodion process]] and [[Ambrotype]]'''&lt;br /&gt;
[[Frederick Scott Archer]] developed the wet collodion processes, which used a thick glass plate unevenly hand-coated with a collodion-based, light-sensitive emulsion. Collodion, which means ‘glue’ in Greek, is nitrocellulose dissolved in ether and ethanol. The [[Ambrotype]], an adaptation of the wet collodion process, was developed by Archer and Peter W. Fry. It involved placing a dark background behind the glass so that the negative image would look positive, and was popular in America until around 1870.&lt;ref&gt;Albright and Fischer, ''Types of Photographs.''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1855: [[Gum printing]]'''&lt;br /&gt;
Orange colored dichromate has photosensitivity when it is mixed with colloids such as gum arabic, albumen, or gelatin. Using that feature, [[Alphonse Poitevin]] invented the gum printing process. It gained in popularity after 1898, and again in 1960s and 1970s because of its unique look.

'''1858: [[Tintype]] (also called Ferrotype and Melainotype)'''&lt;br /&gt;
In this photographic process the emulsion was painted directly onto a japanned (varnish finish) iron plate. it was much cheaper and sturdier than the Ambrotype and Daguerreotype.

'''1861: [[RGB color model|RGB Additive Color Model]]'''&lt;br /&gt;
Applied physician [[James Clerk Maxwell]] made the first color photo by mixing red, green, and blue light.

'''1871: [[Dry plate|Gelatin dry plate]]'''&lt;br /&gt;
[[Richard Leach Maddox|Richard L. Maddox]] discovered that gelatin could be a carrier for silver salts. By 1879, the gelatin dry plate had replaced the collodion wet plate. It was a revolutionary innovation in photography since it needed less light exposure, was usable when dry, meaning photographers no longer needed to pack and carry dangerous liquids, and could be standardized because it could be factory produced.

'''1873: [[Platinum print|Platinum Printing (Platinotype)]]'''&lt;br /&gt;
[[William Willis (inventor)|William Willis]] patented platinum printing in Britain. The process rapidly spread and became a dominant method in Europe and America by 1894 since it had a visibly different color tone compared to albumen and gelatin silver prints.

'''Late 1880s: [[Gelatin silver print]]'''&lt;br /&gt;
This has been the major photograph printing process since the late 1880s up to the present.&lt;ref&gt;Norris, “Proper Storage and Display.”&lt;/ref&gt;  Prints consist of paper coated with an emulsion of silver halide in gelatin. The surface is generally smooth; under magnification, the print appears to sparkle.&lt;ref&gt;Diane DeCesare Ross, "An Overview of the Care of Silver-Based Photographic Prints and Negatives," ''Mississippi Libraries'' 65, no. 2 (Summer 2001): 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1889: [[Kallitype]]'''&lt;br /&gt;
Dr. W. W. J. Nicol invented and revined the Kallitype. Vandyketype, or Single Kalliitype, is the simplest type of Kalltype and creates beautiful brown images.

'''1889: Film Negatives'''&lt;br /&gt;
[[Nitrocellulose#Nitrate film|Cellulose nitrate film]] was developed by [[Eastman Kodak]] in 1889 and refined in 1903. It is made of silver gelatin on a cellulose nitrate base. The negatives are flammable and therefore can be dangerous. Nitrate sheet film was used widely though the 1930s, while nitrate roll film was used through the 1950s. The nitrate base was replaced with [[Cellulose acetate film|cellulose acetate]] in 1923. By 1937, Cellulose diacetate was used as the base, and beginning in 1947 Cellulose triacetate was used.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Messier, "Preserving Your Collection of Film-Based Negatives" (Rocky Mountain Conservation Center, 1993), accessed August 12, 2011, http://cool.conservation-us.org/byauth/messier/negrmcc.html.&lt;/ref&gt; Polyester film was introduced around 1960.&lt;ref&gt;International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) Core Programme Preservation and Conservation, ''Care, Handling and Storage of Photographs: Information Leaflet'', (1992, revised and updated 2002), accessed August 12, 2011, https://www.loc.gov/preservation/resources/care/photolea.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1935: [[Color photography|Color Photographs]]'''&lt;br /&gt;
Kodak introduced color film and transparencies in 1935. The first process was called [[Kodachrome]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry Wilhelm, "Monitoring the Fading and Staining of Color Photographic Prints," ''Journal of the American Institute for Conservation'' 21, no. 1 (1981), accessed August 12, 2011, http://cool.conservation-us.org/jaic/articles/jaic21-01-003.html.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ektachrome]], introduced in the late 1940s, became equally popular. There are now a variety of color processes that use different materials; most consist of dyes (cyan, magenta, and yellow, each of which have different absorption peaks) suspended in a gelatin layer.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Fahey, ''The Care and Preservation of Photographic Prints'' (Dearborn, MI: The Henry Ford), accessed August 12, 2011, http://www.thehenryford.org/research/caring/prints.aspx.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Photograph Stability===
Photograph stability refers to the ability of [[photographic print|prints]] and [[photographic film|film]] to remain visibly unchanged over periods of time. Different photographic processes yield varying degrees of stability. In addition, different materials may have dark-storage stability which differs from their stability in light. An extreme case with slides was stability under the intense light of projection. For example, when stored in darkness, Kodachrome's long-term stability under suitable conditions is superior to other types of color film. Images on Kodachrome slides over fifty years old retain accurate color and density. Kodachrome film stored in darkness is largely responsible for excellent color footage of World War II, for example. It has been calculated that the yellow dye in Kodachrome, the least stable, would suffer a 20% loss of dye in 185 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Permanence and Care of Color Photographs (Chapter5) |publisher=[[Wilhelm Imaging Research]] |isbn= |page=164 |url=http://www.wilhelm-research.com/pdf/HW_Book_05_of_20_HiRes_v1a.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230141550/http://www.wilhelm-research.com/pdf/HW_Book_05_of_20_HiRes_v1a.pdf |archivedate=2006-12-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because developed Kodachrome does not retain unused color couplers.

However, Kodachrome's color stability under bright light, especially during [[slide projector|projection]], is inferior to substantive slide films. Kodachrome's fade time under projection is about one hour, compared to Fujichrome's two and a half hours.&lt;ref name="Wilhelm"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wilhelm-research.com/pdf/HW_Book_05_of_20_HiRes_v1a.pdf |title=The Permanence and Care of Color Photographs (Chapter 6) |publisher=Wilhelm Imaging Research |accessdate=December 27, 2006 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230141550/http://www.wilhelm-research.com/pdf/HW_Book_05_of_20_HiRes_v1a.pdf |archivedate=December 30, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, old Kodachrome slides should be exposed to light only when copying to another medium.

'''Silver halide'''&lt;br /&gt;
[[Black-and-white]] negatives and prints made by the [[silver halide]] process are stable so long as the photographic substrate is stable. Some papers may yellow with age, or the [[gelatin]] matrix may yellow and crack with age. If not developed properly, small amounts of [[silver halide]] remaining in the gelatin will darken when exposed to light. In some prints, the black silver oxide is reduced to metallic silver with time, and the image takes on a metallic sheen as the dark areas reflect light instead of absorbing it. [[Silver]] can also react with [[sulfur]] in the air and form [[silver sulfide]]. A correctly processed and stored silver print or negative probably has the greatest stability of any photographic medium, as attested by the wealth of surviving historical black-and-white photographs.

'''Chromogenic'''&lt;br /&gt;
[[Chromogenic]] dye color processes include Type "R" and [[RA-4 process|process RA-4]] (also known as "type C prints"),  [[C-41 process|process C-41]] color negatives. and [[E-6 process|process E-6]] color reversal ([[Ektachrome]]) film. Chromogenic processes yield organic dyes that are less stable than silver, and can also leave unreacted dye couplers behind during developing. Both factors may lead to color changes over time. The three dyes, cyan, magenta, and yellow, which make up the print may fade at different rates, causing a color shift in the print. Modern chromogenic papers such as [[Kodak]] Endura have achieved excellent stability, however, and are rated for 100 years in home display.

'''Dye destruction'''&lt;br /&gt;
[[Dye destruction]] prints are the most archival color prints, at least among the wet chemical processes, and arguably among all processes. The most well-known kind of [[dye destruction]] print is the [[Cibachrome]], now known as [[Ilfochrome]].

'''Ink jet'''&lt;br /&gt;
Some [[ink jet]] prints are now considered to have excellent stability, while others are not. [[Ink jet]] prints using [[dye]]-[[pigment]] mixtures are now common in photography, and often claim stability on par with [[chromogenic]] prints. However, these claims are based on [[accelerated aging]] studies rather than historical experience, because the technology is still relatively young.

==Types and Causes of Deterioration==
There are two main types of deterioration found in photographic materials. Chemical deterioration occurs when the chemicals in the photograph or negative undergo reactions (either through contact with outside catalysts, or because the chemicals are inherently unstable) that damage the material. Physical or structural deterioration occurs when chemical reactions are not involved, and include abrasion and tearing.

Both types of deterioration are caused by three main factors: environmental storage conditions, inappropriate storage enclosures and repair attempts, and human use and handling. Chemical damage can also be caused by improper chemical processing.&lt;ref&gt;IFLA, ''Care, Handling and Storage of Photographs: Information Leaflet.''&lt;/ref&gt; Different types of photographic materials are particularly susceptible to different types and causes of deterioration.

===Environmental Factors===
* '''Temperature and Humidity''' interact with one another and cause chemical and physical deterioration. High temperature and [[relative humidity]], along with pollution, can cause fading and discoloration of silver images and color dyes. Higher temperatures cause faster deterioration: the rate of deterioration is approximately doubled with every temperature increase of 10&amp;nbsp;°C. Fluctuations in temperature and relative humidity are particularly damaging, as they also speed up chemical deterioration and can cause structural damage such as cracked emulsions and warped support layers.&lt;ref&gt;IFLA, ''Care, Handling and Storage of Photographs: Information Leaflet''; Gary Albright and Monique Fischer, ''Care of Photographs'', Preservation Leaflets (Northeast Document Conservation Center), accessed August 12, 2011, {{cite web|url=http://www.nedcc.org/resources/leaflets/5Photographs/03CareOfPhotos.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415191029/http://www.nedcc.org/resources/leaflets/5Photographs/03CareOfPhotos.php |archivedate=2008-04-15 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
:*Too-high relative humidity can cause fading, discoloration and silver mirroring,&lt;ref&gt;Albright and Fischer, ''Care of Photographs''.&lt;/ref&gt; and can cause binders to soften and become sticky, making photographs susceptible to physical damage.&lt;ref&gt;IFLA, ''Care, Handling and Storage of Photographs: Information Leaflet''&lt;/ref&gt; It can also cause photographs to adhere to frames and other enclosures.&lt;ref&gt;AIC, ''Caring for Your Treasures.''&lt;/ref&gt;
:*Too-low relative humidity can cause physical damage including desiccation, embrittlement, and curling.&lt;ref&gt;Albright and Fischer, ''Care of Photographs''.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Pollution''' can include oxidant and aciding/sulfiding gases that cause chemical deterioration, as well as dust and particulates that can cause abrasion."&lt;ref&gt;Albright and Fischer, ''Care of Photographs''; IFLA, ''Care, Handling and Storage of Photographs: Information Leaflet''; Ross, "Silver-Based Photographic Prints and Negatives," 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Sources of indoor pollution that affect photographs include paint fumes, plywood, cardboard, and cleaning supplies.&lt;ref&gt;Michele Hamill, ''Preserving Your Family Photographs'' (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Library Department of Preservation and Conservation, 2001): 3, accessed August 12, 2001, http://www.library.cornell.edu/preservation/brochure/Family%20Photos%20Text%2001.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Exposure to '''light''' causes embrittlement, fading, and yellowing. The damage is cumulative and usually irreversible. UV light (including from sunlight and fluorescent light) and visible light in the blue part of the spectrum are especially harmful to photographs, but all forms of light, including incandescent and tungsten, are damaging.&lt;ref&gt;Albright and Fischer, ''Care of Photographs''; IFLA, ''Care, Handling and Storage of Photographs: Information Leaflet''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Mold''' growth is fostered by high temperatures and humidity&lt;ref&gt;Albright and Fischer, ''Care of Photographs''.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as dust particles.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, "Silver-Based Photographic Prints and Negatives," 40.&lt;/ref&gt; They cause damage to the surface of photographs and help break down binder layers.&lt;ref&gt;AIC, ''Caring for Your Treasures.''&lt;/ref&gt;
* The presence of '''Insects''' and '''rodents''' is also fostered by high temperatures and humidity&lt;ref&gt;Albright and Fischer, ''Care of Photographs''.&lt;/ref&gt; They eat paper fiber, albumen, and gelatin binders,&lt;ref&gt;AIC, ''Caring for Your Treasures.''&lt;/ref&gt; leaving chew marks and droppings. Species likely to cause problems include [[cockroach]]es and [[silverfish]].&lt;ref&gt;John H. Slate, “Not Fade Away: Understanding the Definition, Preservation and Conservation Issues of Visual Ephemera,” Collection Management 25, no. 4 (2001): 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Factors===
'''Inappropriate storage containers and repair attempts:'''  Cabinets made of inferior materials can give off harmful gases,&lt;ref&gt;IFLA, ''Care, Handling and Storage of Photographs: Information Leaflet.''&lt;/ref&gt; while other reactive materials such as acidic paper sleeves, rubber bands, paper clips, [[pressure sensitive tape]], and glues and adhesives commonly used for storage and repairs in the past can also cause chemical deterioration.&lt;ref&gt;Albright and Fischer, ''Care of Photographs''.&lt;/ref&gt; Storing items too loosely, too tightly, or in enclosures that do not provide adequate physical protection can all cause physical damage such as curling and breakage.&lt;ref&gt;IFLA, ''Care, Handling and Storage of Photographs: Information Leaflet.''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Human handling and use,''' including by researchers and staff, can also cause both chemical and physical deterioration.  Oils, dirt, lotions, and perspiration transmitted through fingerprints can destroy emulsion and cause bleaching, staining, and silver mirroring.&lt;ref&gt;Albright and Fischer, ''Care of Photographs''; James L. Bagget, “Handle With Care: Photos,” The Alabama Librarian 54, no. 1 (2004): 5; Hamill, ''Preserving Your Family Photographs'', 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Physical damage caused by human handling includes abrasion, scratches, tears, breakage, and cracks.&lt;ref&gt;Albright and Fischer, ''Care of Photographs''; Hamill, ''Preserving Your Family Photographs'', 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Improper chemical processing,''' including use of exhausted fixer, insufficient length of fixing, and residual fixer left behind by inadequate washing can cause fading and discoloration. Heat, humidity, and light can accelerate such damage. Adherence to ISO standards at the time of processing can help avoid this type of deterioration.&lt;ref&gt;IFLA, ''Care, Handling and Storage of Photographs: Information Leaflet.''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples of Threats to Specific Photographic Materials===
Glass plate negatives and ambrotypes are prone to breakage.&lt;ref&gt;AIC, ''Caring for Your Treasures.''&lt;/ref&gt; Deterioration of film negatives, regardless of type, is humidity and temperature dependent. Nitrate film will first fade, then become brittle and sticky. It will then soften, adhere to paper enclosures, and produce an odor. Finally, it will disintegrate into a brown, acrid powder.&lt;ref&gt;Messier, "Preserving Your Collection of Film-Based Negatives".&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its flammability, it must be handled with particular care. Cellulose aetate, diacetate, and triacetate film produce acetic acid, which smells like vinegar. The deterioration process is therefore known as "[[Cellulose acetate film#Decay and the .22vinegar syndrome.22|vinegar syndrome]]." The negatives become very brittle and, in diacetate and triacetate film, the base shrinks, causing grooves (“channeling”).&lt;ref&gt;Messier, "Preserving Your Collection of Film-Based Negatives".&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to fading, silver-based images are prone to silver mirroring, which presents as a bluish metallic sheen on the surface of the photograph or negative and is caused by oxidation, which causes the silver to migrate to the surface of the emulsion.&lt;ref&gt;National Library of Australia, Care and handling guidelines for digitization of Library materials, accessed August 17, 2011, http://www.nla.gov.au/digital/care_handling.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

Color photographs are inherently unstable medium, and are more susceptible to light and fading than black and white photographic processes. They are composed of various dyes, all of which eventually fade, albeit at different rates (causing discoloration along with fading).&lt;ref&gt;Norman, "Photographic Collections Management."&lt;/ref&gt; Many color photographic processes are also susceptible to fading even in the dark (known as "dark-fading").&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm, "Fading and Staining of Color Photographic Prints."&lt;/ref&gt; There is little that can be done to restore faded images, and even under ideal conditions, most color photographs will not survive undamaged for more than 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;Norman, "Photographic Collections Management."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preservation Strategies==

===Temperature and Relative Humidity Control===
Maintenance of a proper environment such as control of temperature and relative humidity (RH; a measure of how saturated the air is with moisture)&lt;ref&gt;IFLA, ''Care, Handling and Storage of Photographs: Information Leaflet.''&lt;/ref&gt; is extremely important to the preservation of photographic materials.

Temperature should be maintained at or below 70&amp;nbsp;°F (the lower the better); an “often-recommended” compromise between preservation needs and human comfort is 65-70&amp;nbsp;°F (storage-only areas should be kept cooler).&lt;ref&gt;Albright and Fischer, ‘’Care of Photographs’’.&lt;/ref&gt; Temperature is the controlling factor in the stability of contemporary color photographs. For color photographs, storage at low temperatures (40&amp;nbsp;°F or below) is recommended.&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress, ‘’Caring for Your Photographic Collections’’, accessed August 12, 2011, https://www.loc.gov/preservation/care/photo.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

Relative humidity should be maintained between 30-50% without cycling more than +/- 5% a day.&lt;ref&gt;IFLA ,''Care, Handling and Storage of Photographs: Information Leaflet’’.&lt;/ref&gt; The lower part of that range is best for “long term stability of several photographic processes”.&lt;ref&gt;Albright and Fischer, ‘’Care of Photographs’’.&lt;/ref&gt; Not only do relative humidity levels above 60% cause deterioration, but also low and fluctuating humidity may also damage them.&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress, ‘’Caring for Your Photographic Collections’’&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate control equipment can be used to control temperatures and humidity. Air conditioners, dehumidifiers, and humidifiers can be helpful, but it’s important to make sure they help instead of hurt (for example, air conditioning raises humidity).&lt;ref&gt;Albright and Fischer, ‘’Care of Photographs’’.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cold Storage===
Cold storage is recommended for especially vulnerable materials.&lt;ref&gt;Albright and Fischer, ‘’Care of Photographs’’.&lt;/ref&gt; Original prints, negatives, and transparencies (not glass plates, daguerreotypes, ambrotypes, tintypes, or other images on glass or metal) should be placed in packaging (archival folders in board boxes in double freezer weight Ziplock bags) in cold storage, and temperatures should be maintained at 1.7-4.4”C (35-40&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service, “Caring for Photographs: General Guidelines,” Conserve-O-Gram 14, no. 4 (June 1997), accessed August 12, 2011, http://www.nps.gov/history/museum/publications/conserveogram/14-04.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the guideline of National Archives facilities, clear plastic bags such as Zip-locks or flush-cut bags with twist-ties (polyethylene or polypropylene plastic bags) and cotton gloves are needed.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah S. Wagner, ‘’Cold Storage Handling Guidelines for Photographs’’ (1991), accessed August 12, 2011, https://www.archives.gov/preservation/storage/cold-storage-photos.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

Removing items from cold storage requires letting them acclimate to room conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Albright and Fischer, ‘’Care of Photographs’’.&lt;/ref&gt; Photographs must be allowed to warm up slowly in a cool, dry place, such as an office or processing area.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, ‘’Cold Storage Handling Guidelines for Photographs’’.&lt;/ref&gt; Original items should be retrieved from the storage only in an emergency and no more than once a year.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service, “Caring for Photographs: General Guidelines.”&lt;/ref&gt;

Without cold storage, temperature-sensitive materials will deteriorate in a matter of a few decades; with cold storage they can remain unchanged for many centuries.&lt;ref&gt;IFLA, ''Care, Handling and Storage of Photographs: Information Leaflet’’.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Light Control===
Photographs should not be hung near light.  Hanging photographs on a wall can cause damage from the exposure to direct sunlight, or to fluorescent lights. Displays of photographs should be changed periodically because most photographs will deteriorate in light over time.&lt;ref&gt;Albright and Fischer, ‘’Care of Photographs’’.&lt;/ref&gt;

UV-absorbing sleeves can be used to filter out damaging rays from fluorescent tubes and UV- absorbing sheets can be placed over windows or in frames. Low UV-emitting bulbs are available.&lt;ref&gt;Albright and Fischer, ‘’Care of Photographs’’.&lt;/ref&gt; Light levels should be kept at 50- 100 Lux (5-10 footcandles) for most photographs when in use for research as well as exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service, “Caring for Photographs: General Guidelines.”&lt;/ref&gt; Exposure of color slides to the light in the projector should be kept to a minimum&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress, ‘’Caring for Your Photographic Collections’’&lt;/ref&gt; and photographs should be stored in dark storage.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service, “Caring for Photographs: General Guidelines.”&lt;/ref&gt; The best way to preserve a photograph is to display a facsimile.&lt;ref&gt;IFLA, ''Care, Handling and Storage of Photographs: Information Leaflet’’.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pollution Control===
Controlling air quality is difficult. Ideally, air entering a storage or exhibition area should be filtered and purified. Gaseous pollution should be removed with chemical filters or wet scrubbers. Exterior windows should be kept when possible. Interior sources of harmful gases should be minimized. Metal cabinets are preferable to wooden cabinets, which can produce harmful peroxides.&lt;ref&gt;Albright and Fischer, ‘’Care of Photographs’’.&lt;/ref&gt;

Air can be filtered to keep out gaseous pollutants and particulates such as nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, and ozone&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service, “Caring for Photographs: General Guidelines.”&lt;/ref&gt; Air filters must be changed regularly to be effective. Air circulation should also be checked periodically.&lt;ref&gt;IFLA, ''Care, Handling and Storage of Photographs: Information Leaflet’’.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Handling Control===
Handling and use policies should be established and staff should be trained in policies and policy enforcement and telling users the policies when they arrive. Policies for processing, handling for loaned or exhibited items, and disaster prevention and recovery should also be created and followed.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service, “Caring for Photographs: General Guidelines.”&lt;/ref&gt;

Work spaces should be clean and uncluttered.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service, “Caring for Photographs: General Guidelines.”&lt;/ref&gt; Clean gloves or clean, dry hands should be used whenever photographs are handled.&lt;ref&gt;Albright and Fischer, ‘’Care of Photographs’’.&lt;/ref&gt; Foods, drink, dirt, cleaning chemicals, and photocopy machines should be kept away from photo storage, exhibit, or work spaces.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service, “Caring for Photographs: General Guidelines.”&lt;/ref&gt;

For precious materials, users should be provided with duplicates, not originals.

===Storage Systems Control===
Proper storage materials are essential for the long-term stability of photographs and  negatives. Enclosures keep away dirt and pollutants. All enclosures used to house photographs and those should meet the specifications provided in the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).&lt;ref&gt;Albright and Fischer, ‘’Care of Photographs’’.&lt;/ref&gt; Most photographs can be safely kept in paper enclosures; some can also be safely stored in some types of plastic enclosures.&lt;ref&gt;Icon, The Institute of Conservation, ‘’Care and conservation of photographic materials’’ (2006), accessed August 12, 2011, http://www.conservationregister.com/carephotographs.asp.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paper enclosures protect objects from light, but may result in increased handling for viewing.&lt;ref&gt;Albright and Fischer, ‘’Care of Photographs’’.&lt;/ref&gt; Paper enclosures must be acid-free, lignin-free, and are available in both buffered (alkaline, pH 8.5) and unbuffered (neutral, pH 7) stock. Storage materials must pass the ANSI Photographic Activity Test (PAT) which is noted in suppliers’ catalogs.&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress, ‘’Caring for Your Photographic Collections’’&lt;/ref&gt; Paper enclosures also protects the photographs from the accumulation of moisture and detrimental gases&lt;ref&gt;Albright and Fischer, ‘’Care of Photographs’’.&lt;/ref&gt; and are relatively inexpensive.&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress, ‘’Caring for Your Photographic Collections.’’&lt;/ref&gt;

Plastic enclosures include uncoated polyester film, uncoated cellulose triacetate, polyethylene, and polypropylene.&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress, ‘’Caring for Your Photographic Collections’’&lt;/ref&gt; Plastic enclosures are transparent. Photographs can be viewed without removal from the enclosure, thus it can reduce handling. However, plastic enclosures can trap moisture and cause ferrotyping (sticking, with a resultant glossy area).&lt;ref&gt;Albright and Fischer, ‘’Care of Photographs’’.&lt;/ref&gt;  Plastic is not suitable for prints with surface damage, glass or metal-based photographs, nor for film-based negatives and transparencies from the 1950s, unless the latter are in cold storage.&lt;ref&gt;Icon, The Institute of Conservation, ‘’Care and conservation of photographic materials.’’&lt;/ref&gt; It should not to be used to store older safety film negatives as this may hasten their deterioration.&lt;ref&gt;Albright and Fischer, ‘’Care of Photographs’’.&lt;/ref&gt;

Horizontal storage is preferable for many photographic prints and oversize photographs.  It provides overall support to the images and prevents mechanical damage such as bending. Vertical storage is often more efficient and may make access to a collection easier. Materials of similar size should be stored together. Boxes and files should not be overcrowded.&lt;ref&gt;Albright and Fischer, ‘’Care of Photographs’’.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reproduction and Digitization===
Unlike the [[digital photography|born-digital photographs]] that are widely produced and consumed these days, historical photographs such as old slides, films, and printed photos are not easy to preserve.  An important component of long-term photograph preservation is making reproductions (by photocopying, photographing, or scanning and digitizing) of photographs for use in exhibitions and by researchers, which reduces the damage caused by non-controlled environments and handling.&lt;ref&gt;AIC, ''Caring for Your Treasures''&lt;/ref&gt;

Digitizing photographs also allows access by a much wider public, especially where the images have intrinsic historic value. Digital scans, however, are not replacements for the original, as digital file formats may become obsolete. Originals should always be preserved, even if they have been digitized. Born-digital photographs also require preservation, using [[digital preservation]] techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Bagget, “Handle With Care: Photos,” 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/external/safeguarding-european-photographic-images-access-sepia/ Safeguarding European Photographic Images for Access (SEPIA)] lists ten principles for digitization of historical photograph.&lt;ref&gt;SEPIA (Safeguarding European Photographic Images for Access), ''Preservation issues in digitizing historical photographs'' (200 ), accessed August 12, 2011, http://www.ica.org/?lid=5668&amp;bid=744.&lt;/ref&gt; Summarized, they are:
# Photographs are an essential part of our cultural heritage, which contain our past, documentary and artistic value and the history of photographic processes; 
# Digitizing photographs that deteriorate quickly is urgent matter to facilitate access for a large audience; 
# Since digitization is not an end itself but a tool, selection of photographs to digitize should be based on an understanding of the nature and potential use of the collection; 
# It's essential to define the aims, priorities, technical requirements, procedures and future use for investments; 
# The creation of a digital image is a sophisticated activity which requires photographic expertise with ethical judgment; 
# Digital images need regular maintenance in order to keep pace with changing technologies; 
# A good digitization project requires teamwork, combining expertise on imaging, collection management, IT, conservation, descriptive methods and preservation strategies; 
# The input of specialists in every project is essential to integrate preservation measures in the work-flow, handle fragile materials and avoid damage to the originals; 
# Preservation specialists need to manage of digital assets in line with the overall preservation policy of the organization; and 
# Museums, archives and libraries actively involve to develop international standards for the preservation of digital collections in the long-term view.

====Examples====
[[Image:Original Tay Bridge before the 1879 collapse.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Original Tay Bridge from the north]]
[[Image:Tay bridge down.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Fallen Tay Bridge from the north]]
An example of digitization as part of a photograph preservation strategy is the photographic collection of the [[Tay Bridge disaster]] of 1879. These photographs have been digitized and disseminated more widely. Only the positive prints survive, owing to the widespread practice of recycling the original glass negatives to reclaim the [[silver]] content. Even when carefully preserved and kept in the dark, damage can occur through intermittent exposure to light, as shown by damage to the image of the intact bridge (at left).

An example of a larger digitization project is the [https://web.archive.org/web/20131203101946/http://bancroft.berkeley.edu/collections/casedphotos/project.html Cased Photographs Project], which provides access to digital images and detailed descriptions of daguerreotypes, ambrotypes, tintypes, and related photographs in the collections of the [[Bancroft Library]] and the [[California State Library]].

==Conservation Treatments==
Photograph conservation involves the physical treatment of individual photographs. As defined by the [[American Institute for Conservation]], treatment is “the deliberate alteration of the chemical and/or physical aspects of cultural property, aimed primarily at prolonging its existence. Treatment may consist of stabilization and/or restoration.” Stabilization treatments aim to maintain photographs in their current condition, minimizing further deterioration, while restoration treatments aim to return photographs to their original state.&lt;ref&gt;American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC), ''Definitions of Conservation Terminology'', accessed August 12, 2011, http://www.conservation-us.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.viewpage&amp;pageid=620&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservation treatments range from very simple tear repairs or flattening to more complex treatments such as stain removal. Treatments vary widely depending on the type of photograph and its intended use. Therefore, conservators must by knowledgeable regarding both of these issues. Guides for the preservation of personal and family photograph collections, such as Cornell University's [https://web.archive.org/web/20130606191040/http://www.library.cornell.edu/preservation/brochure/Family%20Photos%20Text%2001.pdf ''Preserving Your Family Photographs''] and the AIC’s [http://www.conservation-us.org/_data/n_0001/resources/live/photographs.pdf/ ''Caring for Your Treasures''], recommend that people contact a trained conservator if they have rapidly deteriorating negatives or photographs with active mold growth, staining from pressure sensitive tape, severe tears, adhesion to enclosures, and other types of damage requiring conservation treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Hamill, Preserving Your Family Photographs, 7-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional Organizations==
There are a number of international organizations concerned with conservation of photographs along with other subjects, including the [http://www.ica.org/ International Council on Archives (ICA)], the [http://www.iiconservation.org/ International Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (IIC)] , and the [http://www.icom-cc.org/ International Council of Museums - Committee for Conservation (ICOM-CC)]. The [http://icom-cc.icom.museum/WG/PhotographicRecords/ Photographic Records Working Group] is a specialty group within the ICOM-CC.

In the United States, the national membership organization of conservation professionals is the [http://www.conservation-us.org/ American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic works(AIC)] to which the [http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/pmg/ Photographic Materials Group (PMG)] belongs. The [http://www.nedcc.org/ Northeast Document Conservation Center (NEDCC)] and the [http://www.ccaha.org/ Conservation Center for Art and Historic Artifacts (CCAHA)] also play an important role in the field of conservation. The [https://www.imagepermanenceinstitute.org/ Image Permanence Institute (IPI)] at Rochester Institute of Technology is one of the leaders in preservation research of images in particular.

===Codes and Standards===
Photograph conservators and preservation managers are guided in their work by codes of ethics and technical standards. The [[International Council on Archives]] publishes a [http://www.conservation-us.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.viewPage&amp;pageID=858&amp;nodeID=1 ''Code of Ethics''] and [http://www.conservation-us.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.viewpage&amp;pageid=1026 ''Guidelines for Practice'']. Additionally, members of other professions (such as archivists and librarians) who deal with preservation of photographs do so in accordance with their professional organization’s codes of ethics. For example, the [[Society of American Archivists]] [http://www2.archivists.org/code-of-ethics ''Code of Ethics''] states that "Archivists protect all documentary materials for which they are responsible and guard them against defacement, physical damage, deterioration, and theft."&lt;ref&gt;SAA, ''Code of Ethics for Archivists'' (2005), accessed August 12, 2011, http://www2.archivists.org/code-of-ethics&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) and [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI) both publish technical standards that govern the materials and procedures used in photograph preservation and conservation. The [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]] has published a [https://www.loc.gov/preservation/resources/care/photostn.html list of ANSI standards] pertaining to the care and handling of photographs.&lt;ref&gt;International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) Core Programme Preservation and Conservation, Care, Handling and Storage of Photographs: Standards, accessed August 12, 2011, https://www.loc.gov/preservation/resources/care/photostn.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and Training==
Photograph conservators can be found in museums, archives, and libraries, as well as in private practice. Conservators often have earned their master's degrees in [[art conservation and restoration|art conservation]], though many have also been trained through [[apprenticeship]]. They often have backgrounds in [[art history]], chemistry, or photography.

Among numerous programs concerned with conservation of photographs around the world are:

'''Coptology''' is the science of [[Copt]]ic studies, the study of Coptic language and literature.&lt;ref name="We"&gt;[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/704/he1.htm Alahram weekly] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070917024209/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/704/he1.htm |date=September 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The European interest in Coptology may have started as early as the 15th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Copts and the West, 1439-1822: The European Discovery of the Egyptian Church|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Ho-IXrFvyq8C&amp;pg=PA141&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;dq=history+of+coptology&amp;source=web&amp;ots=u_afXTuU5Q&amp;sig=qG1qijWJuplcAVA7gZrf4_9OSGA|publisher = OUP Oxford|date = 2006-07-27|isbn = 9780199288779|language = en|first = Alastair|last = Hamilton}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was used in 1976 when the First International Congress of Coptology was held in [[Cairo]] under the title "Colloquium on the Future of Coptic Studies" (11-17 December). This was followed by the establishment of the "[[International Association for Coptic Studies]]".&lt;ref name="Int"&gt; [http://rmcisadu.let.uniroma1.it/~iacs/  International Association for Coptic Studies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110201011732/http://rmcisadu.let.uniroma1.it/~iacs/ |date=2011-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the founders of the Colloquium and the Association was [[Pahor Labib]], director of the [[Coptic Museum]] in [[Cairo]] during 1951-65. The words 'Coptology' and 'Coptologist' were introduced into the English language by [[Aziz Suryal Atiya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Amazon.com: Online Shopping for Electronics, Apparel, Computers, Books, DVDs &amp; more|url = https://www.amazon.com/gp/richpub/syltguides/fullview/PN1YR1HMUGAQ|accessdate = 2015-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Worldwide institutions==
There are now institutions that give more or less regular courses of Coptology in 47 countries around the world, including Australia, Great Britain, Canada, Germany, Israel, Spain, Switzerland, and the United States. A rotating chair of Coptic studies was opened at the [[American University in Cairo]] in 2002.&lt;ref name="We"/&gt;

The '''Cronulla Fisheries Centre''' or '''Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre''' is a heritage-listed former [[fisheries science|fisheries research centre]] and now public reserve and marine rescue base located at the Southern end of Nicholson Parade, [[Cronulla, New South Wales|Cronulla]], [[Sutherland Shire]], [[New South Wales]], Australia. It was built from 1904. It is also known as '''The Cronulla Fisheries Centre and Hungry Point Reserve'''; '''NSW Fisheries Research Institute'''; '''CSIRO Fisheries Division''' and the '''CSIRO Division of Fisheries &amp; Oceanography'''. The property is owned by the [[Department of Primary Industries (New South Wales)|NSW Department of Primary Industries]], a [[government department|department]] of the [[Government of New South Wales]]. The site has heritage listed buildings and several [[Australian Aboriginal]] sites.&lt;ref name=cfrc-history/&gt; It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

Following a long history of internationally recognised research&lt;ref name=SMH-20111014/&gt; in 2011 a decision was made by the [[Government of New South Wales]] to decentralise the Centre's functions and staff to regional centres at [[Coffs Harbour]], [[Port Stephens (New South Wales)|Port Stephens]] and [[Nowra]].&lt;ref name="main page"/&gt; The decision created a degree of controversy&lt;ref name=SMH-20120910/&gt; as it was announced without any staff consultation, or a cost-benefit analysis. A Parliamentary Inquiry was held during 2012, and its chairman, [[Fred Nile]] MLC, reported that:&lt;ref name="enquiry-final report-media release"/&gt;
{{blockquote|"... [there was] an overwhelming case to retain the scientific staff, facilities and support personnel at the Centre ....".|}} 

In December 2012 the Government rejected the inquiry's recommendation,&lt;ref name=close2012/&gt; and in 2013 the Centre was closed. In 2014 the Government committed itself to keeping the site in public ownership. The '''Hungry Point Reserve Trust''' was created to manage the Crown land, and existing facilities are used by [[Marine Rescue NSW]], the [[New South Wales Police Force#Marine Area Command|Water Police]] and [[Roads and Maritime Services]].&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;&lt;ref name="nswshr-1011-1535" /&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1548/&gt;

== Location ==
The former fisheries centre, and now Hungry Point Reserve, occupies an area of 3-hectares located at 202 Nicholson Parade at the southern-most tip of Cronulla Pensinsula overlooking Salmon Haul Bay and [[Gunnamatta Bay]] on [[Port Hacking]]. It is also opposite [[Bundeena]] in the [[Royal National Park]].&lt;ref name=cfrc-contact/&gt;. It is bound on the north by Darook Park, residential properties fronting Nicholson Parade and Cowra Place, and Salmon Haul Reserve on the north east of the site.&lt;ref name="Architectural-Projects1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Architectural-Projects2"/&gt;

== History ==
===Indigenous history===
The Gwiyaga ([[Gweagal]]), a clan of the [[Tharawal|Dharawal]] tribe of indigenous Australians, are traditional custodians of the southern areas of [[Sydney]]. The Gweagal hunted and fished in the swamps between [[Botany Bay]] and Port Hacking. They spoke the Dharawal language. Radiocarbon dating indicates that Aborigines were using areas of the Royal National Park at least 7,500 years ago. Midden deposits are present along the entire foreshore with minor concentrations associated with rock shelters and extensive midden deposits visible beneath building foundations.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1531/&gt;

The area would have provided rich marine resources for inhabitants, in terms of both food resources and shelter. Shellfish and fish such as Sydney rock whelk and Sydney rock oyster were integral to the diet of coastal Aboriginal tribes, as were snapper and bream. Both men and women spent considerable time fishing. The diet of Dharawal people could also have included rhizomes of bracken fern, seeds of the wattle, fruit of the geebung (snotty gobbles) and the terminal buds of the cabbage tree palm.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

Frank Cridland in his book ''The Story of Port Hacking, Cronulla and the Sutherland Shire'' (1924) spoke of Darook Park, and particularly the [[Wahgunyah]] Cliffs, immediately north of the Fisheries site, lamenting that the evidence of occupation of the area by the Aboriginal people was in danger of destruction by modern development. He commissioned surveyor and recorder of engraving sites, W.D.Campbell, to record the engravings visible (at the time) in the Cronulla area, including the vicinity of the Fisheries site.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

In the early 1960s archaeologist Ian Sim recorded engravings in the Darook Park area, along Darook Park Road (adjacent to the Wahgunyah Cliffs). Some of these engravings may still exist, but are now on private property.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1533/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

===Colonial history===
The earliest description of the area from a European perspective was given by explorer Matthew [[Flinders, New South Wales|Flinders]], who in April 1814 spent time navigating the shores of Port Hacking.
Explorers George Bass and Matthew Flinders camped adjacent to the "Fisheries Site" at (presumably) Salmon Haul Bay in 1776. They liaised with two of the local native people, a very early example of friendly relations between Europeans and members of the local native population.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

Surveyor [[Robert Dixon (explorer)|Robert Dixon]] worked here in 1827-8, naming the beaches. At the south end of [[Bate Bay]] and north of the entrance to Port Hacking, John Connell was the first European settler, receiving a 380-acre grant in 1835. The suburb's name is from the Aboriginal word "kurranulla" meaning the place of pink seashells. In 1840 the beach was known as Kurranulla. In 1895 the area was subdivided and land offered for sale at 10 pounds per acre; in 1899 the [[Government of New South Wales|NSW Government]] named the area Gunnamatta (meaning sandy hills) but on 26/2/1908 it was officially changed to Cronulla, and Gunnamatta became the name of the beautiful bay on the Port Hacking side of this suburb.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

After the railway came to [[Sutherland, New South Wales|Sutherland]] in 1884, the area became popular for picnics - for which Cronulla has two assets: a fine ocean surfing beach, and on its southern side beautiful Gunnamatta Bay, an arm of Port Hacking. Before Cronulla was linked to Sydney by rail in 1939, it was necessary to travel to Sutherland and transfer to a steam tram which chuffed its way through sandy, sometimes bushland areas to the beach. An official post office opened in 1891, known as [[Cronulla Beach]] post office as at the time most of the settlement was on the beach side. It closed in 1893, reopened in 1907 and in 1929 its name changed officially to Cronulla. The first public school opened in 1910. Today there are two public schools and a high school, as well as convent schools.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1532&gt;Pollen &amp; Healy, 1988, 74&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

===Development of the Fisheries Research Centre===
====Hungry Point area and the evolution of the Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre (CFRC)====
Scientific fisheries research has been carried out at the Cronulla location for more than 110 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre |url=http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/research/centres/cronulla/history |publisher=NSW Department of Primary Industries |date=March 2011 |accessdate=19 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406041117/http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/research/centres/cronulla/history |archivedate=6 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The research aquaria was built in 1904 and is now heritage listed.&lt;ref name=saveCFRC-facilities&gt;{{cite web|title=Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre of Excellence - Research Aquaria|url=http://www.savecronullafisheries.net/facilities.html|publisher=www. savecronullafisheries.net|accessdate=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first such research facility in the southern hemisphere,&lt;ref name=cfrc-history&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre |url=http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/research/centres/cronulla/history |publisher=NSW Department of Primary Industries |date=March 2011 |accessdate=19 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406041117/http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/research/centres/cronulla/history |archivedate=6 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and according to fisheries scientist Professor [[Tony Pitcher]] of the [[University of British Columbia]], has a "long and distinguished international reputation in fisheries research".&lt;ref name=SMH-20111014&gt;{{cite news|title=Cronulla Fisheries fight goes global|url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/conservation/cronulla-fisheries-fight-goes-global-20111014-1loxu.html|accessdate=21 November 2012|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|date=14 October 2011|agency=AAP}}&lt;/ref&gt; The southernmost part of the Cronulla peninsula has a "rich fabric of Aboriginal occupation". Surveyor Robert Dixon visited Cronulla and surrounding areas in 1827, and secured the native names of the beaches and bays, e.g. Cronulla (Kurranulla), [[Burraneer, New South Wales|Burraneer]], [[Woolooware]] and Gunnamatta.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1533&gt;Harley, 2012, 11-12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt; On 24 December 1861 a Government Reserve of {{convert|300|acre|ha|0|order=flip}} was notified.

He was assisted by [[David George Stead]] (1877–1957).&lt;ref name=BIO-Stead&gt;{{cite web| last=G. P. Walsh| first=G. P.| title=Stead, David George (1877–1957)| url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/stead-david-george-8634| work=Australian Dictionary of Biography| publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University| accessdate=22 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1800s and early 1900s the NSW Government was concerned at serious depletion of fish stocks in estuaries as a result of illegal overfishing and gross chemical pollution of Sydney harbour emanating from measures to combat the rat plague. The plan of the Fisheries Commissioners at the time was to employ aquaculture to supplement stocks of local species and also to improve the quality of the seafood available by importing live fish from the northern hemisphere for culture and release into local waters.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

In 1881 the NSW Commissioners of Fisheries were appointed under the Fisheries Act 1881.&lt;ref name="nswshr-1011-1535" /&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt; In 1895 Hungry Point was reserved for defence purposes.&lt;ref name="nswshr-1011-1535" /&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

The Hungry Point site now occupied by the CFRC was held as a reserve for defence purposes from 1895 until 1902, when an area of 1.37 ha on the Gunnamatta Bay side of the site was transferred from the Commonwealth for use by the NSW Government for the purpose of fish culture. The NSW Government was determined to appoint a fisheries expert of world repute, and in 1902 selected a 31 year old Norwegian, Harald Dannevig, who had constructed the Dunbar and [[Aberdeen, New South Wales|Aberdeen]] Marine Fish Hatcheries, and supervised their operation for 9 years. He had extensive knowledge of the commercial fishing industry in the North Sea, based on early training with his father, Gunder Dannevig, regarded as a world leader in fisheries stocking. In 1902 Harald Dannevig began duties in Sydney in the newly created position of Superintendent of Fisheries Investigations and Marine Hatcheries. He transported adult fish from the UK to Sydney, to supplement stocks in depleted NSW estuaries. He carefully selected the Cronulla site for the new hatchery and supervised construction and operation. All aspects of a potential fishing industry, both fresh and marine water, were investigated and extensive plans formulated by Dannevig. His plans were always based on expert practical work in the field and extensive discussions with fishers. He was called on by Government Commissions looking into fishing and food industries as well as giving advice to other Australian states.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

The Cronulla hatchery, experimental pool and laboratory were built in 1904, commissioned in 1905 and became fully operational in early 1906. Initial stocks of the hatchery included whiting, red bream, flathead, trevally and crayfish. Later snapper and other finfish were introduced. These all flourished in the pond but did not spawn. Dannevig had more success with flounder from [[Tasmania]], resulting in the liberation of 20 million young fish into Port Hacking, Botany Bay, [[Middle Harbour]] and [[Brisbane Water]]. The hatchering continued to culture finfish and shellfish species but more emphasis was placed on investigations into the biology of local species by hatchery staff and staff from Sydney University. The hatchery was closed in 1914, and the NSW Government embarked on other fisheries related projects including developing a commercial ocean trawl fishery.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

The Commonwealth Government appointed Dannevig to the position of founding Director of Fisheries for Australia in 1908. He designed and supervised construction of Australia's first marine research vessel, and went on to conduct the first investigations of fish resources off Australia until his death (aged 43), when the Commonwealth research ship FIV Endeavour was lost in extreme gale conditions off Macquarie Island in 1914. With the vast disruption of [[World War I]], the absence of Dannevig's leadership and insight, fisheries research and development did not progress in Australia until creation of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR, later CSIRO) in 1926. The CSIR's brief included initiation and conduct of research in connection with promotion of primary and secondary industries, training research workers, making grants for pure research and supervision of testing of scientific apparatus and standardisation. In 1929 the saltwater pool was used for experiments on the effect of electrical fields on sharks by Swedish engineer Dr E.O.Moller.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1537&gt;Harley, 2012, 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

In 1937 Dr Harold Thompson was appointed as the first Officer in Charge of the Fisheries Investigations Section of CSIR, which was renamed the CSIRO Division of Fisheries and Oceanography in 1956.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt; The NSW Government's part holding of the Hungry Point site was transferred back to the Commonwealth in 1938 to accommodate the newly established CSIR Fisheries Division, and provision was made to also house the NSW Fish Biology Branch and students from Sydney University. Programmes were quickly developed in a wide range of research areas, initially related to tuna, whales and dolphins, coastal and estuarine hydrology, fish preservation, mullet and oysters. Subsequent decades saw the rapid expansion of research programmes in physical and chemical oceanography, fish biology, population dynamics and plankton research.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt; The CSIRO Fisheries main building (Building 1) was completed in 1938.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1537/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

==== Cronulla Migrant Hostel (1949-1967) ====
In 1949 a [[Post-war immigration to Australia#Migrant reception and training centres|migrant hostel]] was built on the eastern half of the site to accommodate [[Post-war immigration to Australia|post-war migrants]] from Eastern Europe, many of whom were "[[Forced displacement|Displaced Persons]]".&lt;ref name="Architectural-Projects1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Architectural-Projects2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="2016-Masterplan"/&gt; 

The new buildings were added to existing ex-naval huts built in the 1940s and used for the CSIR Fisheries School between 1946-1947. Altogether the Cronulla Migrant Hostel precinct included eighteen buildings.&lt;ref name="Architectural-Projects2"/&gt; The buildings were constructed of weatherboard and built on brick piers. The gabled roofs were made of corrugated sheet metal, which also clad the narrow verandahs.

The Government Gazette of 22 April 1949 announced acceptance of tenders for construction of accommodation for 200 migrants. Construction continued into 1950 when a carpenters strike threatened to delay completion of the hostel. The dispute was due to the communist-controlled Building Workers' Industrial Union opposing the immigration of refugees from communist-occupied Baltic countries.&lt;ref name="communist"/&gt; The hostel was sometimes called "Balt Camp" after the number of Baltic families housed there,&lt;ref name="nswshr-1011-1537"/&gt; though migrants came from other Eastern European countries.&lt;ref name="Architectural-Projects2"/&gt;

The hostel temporarily closed in 1964 but was reopened in early 1966 to accommodate 102 migrants, mainly of British nationality.&lt;ref name="Architectural-Projects1"/&gt;

In 1967 the Cronulla Migrant Hostel was closed.&lt;ref name="Architectural-Projects1"/&gt; All but two of the hostels and associated buildings were demolished in the 1970. These two weatherboard buildings, located within a precinct with views over Port Hacking, have high heritage significance, being "rare examples of Postwar Migrant Hostel accommodation"&lt;ref name="2016-Masterplan"/&gt; and "the remaining site layout, buildings and landscape elements provide rare physical evidence of the first phase of the migration experience, accommodation in camps and the compulsory work obligation for men".&lt;ref name="Architectural-Projects2"/&gt;

==== Research ====
[[File:Examining a fish and crustaceans at the Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre.jpg|thumb|Examining a fish and crustaceans at the Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre, 1947]]

Until 2012 projects conducted at the Centre included research into [[bull shark]]s, [[Barotrauma]], [[giant cuttlefish]], prawns, [[Recreational fishery|recreational fishing]], [[commercial fisheries]], fish biology, the effects of climate change in NSW, threats to [[marine biodiversity]] in NSW, resource assessment and monitoring, and research surveys in estuaries.&lt;ref name=save-cfrc-research&gt;{{cite web| title=Current Research Projects| url=http://www.savecronullafisheries.net/research-projects.html| publisher=savecronullafisheries.net| accessdate=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cfrc-key-research&gt;{{cite web|title=Key research of Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre of Excellence| url=http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/research/centres/cronulla/key-research| publisher=NSW Department of Primary Industries| accessdate=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DPI-Current research"&gt;{{cite web| title=Current Research Projects|url=http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/184931/Current-Project-Summaries-for-Web_WILD-FISH_UPDATED-6-FEB12.pdf| work= Wild Fisheries | publisher=dpi.nsw.gov.au| accessdate=21 November 2012| pages=68| date=6 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976 the CSIRO Building 16 fisheries laboratories and offices were completed.&lt;ref name="nswshr-1011-1537" /&gt; The CSIRO Marine Laboratories were transferred to [[Hobart]] in 1984 after 47 years of research at the Hungry Point site. These decades of research were of enormous importance in establishing the basis for oceanographic and fisheries research in Australia.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

The facilities at Cronulla were transferred back to the NSW Government in 1985 for the purposes of fisheries research, and research staff of the Fisheries Division of NSW Department of Agriculture moved to the site in July 1985, when the facility was renamed the NSW Fisheries Research Institute. Research carried out since then included investigations into the dynamics of trawl fish, estuarine fish and invertebrate populations. There have been research projects to investigate the effects of impounding waterways, the impact of the Deep-Water Ocean Outfalls, the ecological impact of the third runway at [[Sydney Airport]], the effects of fishing over seagrass and estimation of the level of catch in recreational fisheries.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1541&gt;Harley, 2012, 8-11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

The Commonwealth government retained land title for the eastern part of {{convert|1.54|ha}} of the Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre site until 1988, following an agreement in 1984 between the Federal and State Governments.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt; In 2004 NSW Fisheries was amalgamated with other departments to form the NSW Department of Primary Industries (DPI).&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1541/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt; In 2005 the centenary of aquatic research at the Cronulla Marine Laboratories was celebrated. In February 2007 a newly upgraded laboratory was opened by [[Ian Macdonald (Australian politician)|Ian Macdonald]] the [[Minister for Primary Industries, Lands and Water (New South Wales)|NSW Minister for Primary Industries]]. The new $1 million laboratory was named the 'H.C. Dannevig Fisheries Laboratory' after Dannevig, the founder of the Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre.&lt;ref name=cfrc-new-lab&gt;{{cite media release |title=Science boost catch of the day at Cronulla |url=http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/research/updates/issues/february-2007/science-boost-at-cronulla |accessdate=28 October 2015 |publisher=[[Department of Primary Industries (New South Wales)|Department of Primary Industries]] |date=12 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1537/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt; The centre operated as a Fisheries Centre of Excellence until its closure in 2011.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt; 

Prior to its closure, as at March 2011 the {{convert|25|ha|adj=on}} Centre had 152 staff which included 18 research and eleven management professional staff. The Centre supported 22 postgraduate students, two overseas projects and two consultancies. The Centre had conducted{{clarify|date=November 2018|in what time period?}} 56 workshops/meetings, 182 field days, and 51 publications.&lt;ref name="main page"/&gt;

An inquiry into the closure of the Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre of Excellence was instigated and a committee established by a [[New South Wales Legislative Council|NSW Legislative Council]] resolution, to report by 23 October 2012. The committee's resolutions included that the NSW Government reverse the decision to close the CFRC and not proceed with the closure. The NSW government responded in December 2012, stating it did not support their recommendation to reverse the decision to close the centre. The NSW Department of Primary Industries Director-General issued terms of reference to recommend future uses of the site. In November David Harley AM prepared a report, making 25 recommendations for the future use of the site. One was that a Management Trust be established to manage the site.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1542&gt;Architectural Projects, 2016, 17-18&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Parliamentary inquiry ===

An inquiry by the 'Legislative Council Select Committee on Cronulla Fisheries' into the closure was established on 21 June 2012. Submissions were called for on 25 June 2012, closing on 30 July 2012. The final report was delivered on time on 23 October 2012.&lt;ref name=Inquiry&gt;{{cite web|title=Closure of the Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre of Excellence (Inquiry)| url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/committee.nsf/0/796B612554728F1BCA257A250007267B| publisher=parliament.nsw.gov.au| accessdate=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee was chaired by Fred Nile.

====2012 Parliamentary speeches touching on the site's history====
The CFRC is an important part of Australian history. It should be held in the same reverence as the Elizabeth MacArthur Agricultural Institute, as the starting point for the Agriculture Industry in Australia. Under various names, the now Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre was the site from which fisheries resources of Australia were explored and the fishing industry developed. It was the first fisheries research centre in Australia and probably the southern hemisphere. Its buildings date back to 1902, these being purpose built at the time for fisheries research.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

Since that time the site has housed fisheries scientists from either NSW or Commonwealth government agencies. It is the site which based the first chief scientist of fisheries in Australia, Harald Dannevig. From this base he surveyed the fish resources of eastern Australia to as far south as Macquarie Island and westwards in to Bass Strait as far as [[Western Australia]]. Amongst many gifted fisheries scientists and oceanographers, it has housed the first oceanographic scientists in Australia, the Chair of the International Whaling Commission and scientists who advised that body, who discovered deepwater resources and surveyed the prawn resources of the Gulf of Carpentaria.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

In addition, the site has indigenous cultural significance. CFRC is strewn with indigenous middens three of which are recognised under the Heritage Act as being worthy of conservation and protection. As part of the high school education program at the CFRC indigenous leaders take great pride in talking to students about how their people lived on this land and the importance of this land to them.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1543&gt;Montgomery, in NSW [[Parliament of New South Wales|Parliament]]. [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]], 2012, 70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

The site has associations with a number of notable scientists including Harald Dannevig (as noted above), Dr Geoffrey Kesteven, John McIntosh, David Tranter, Baughan Wisely, David Rochford and Ian Munro. Through these scientists working together they produced the earliest science for Australia as well as New South Wales in fisheries knowledge.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

There is (also) a very important gentleman who was at Cronulla until CSIRO moved to Hobart. His name is Dr Keith Sainsbury. He is one of only two Australians to have been created a laureate and receive the [[Japan Prize]], the highest prize in science. He still works internationally, nationally and in New South Wales as an expert in fisheries management and most importantly he helps in the annual assessment process for determining the New South Wales take of the highly prized abalone and lobster fisheries.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1544&gt;Gerrard, in NSW Parliament, Legislative Council, 2012, 70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation had utilised the site from 1949 until it transferred to Hobart in 1985. At that time, the Department of Agriculture's Division of Fisheries returned to the Cronulla site. 'The Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre is unique in Australia, and the site was handed over from the Commonwealth to the NSW Government in1984 in good faith that the site and buildings would continue to be used for marine research purposes.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1545&gt;Reid, in NSW Parliament, Legislative Council, 2012, 70-71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

;Former hatchery building
Fish hatchery was established in {{circa|1904}}. Building constructed prior to 1914, probably {{circa|1904}}-1907. It was originally a laboratory wing (with open verandah on both sides) and a hatchery hall comprising a single open space containing fish tanks. It was thought to be vacant {{circa|1920}}-1930. The Commonwealth Scientific &amp; Industrial Research (later ... Organisation) CSIR/CSIRO operations post-1938 were in this building. The hall remained open until 1950.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

;Boat shed
Constructed between 1904 and 1914. Re-clad {{circa|1970}}s. Restoration work to cladding and windows repplaced in 2002. Originally had wharf at western side. Engine room at east probably re-clad but original structure. Used to house boats and marine equipment.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

;Fish pond
Constructed as part of the hatchery complex between 1904 and 1914. Complex established by (Commonwealth) Superintendent of Fisheries, Harald Dannevig.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

==== Findings and recommendations ====

The Chairman of the 'Select Committee on the Closure of the Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre of Excellence', Fred Nile, said:&lt;ref name="enquiry-final report-media release"&gt;{{cite media release| last=Chung| first=C| title= Upper House Committee Reports on the Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre Closure (Pre-amble) | url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/committee.nsf/0/b6d8ac60c3700e46ca257aa00015215f/$FILE/Media%20Release%20&amp;%20Recommendations.pdf| publisher=Select Committee on Cronulla Fisheries Closures| accessdate=21 November 2012| pages=14| format=PDF| date=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Blockquote|"The Committee has concluded that there is an overwhelming case to retain the scientific staff, facilities and support personnel at the Centre and we have recommended that the Government reverse its decision. "

"Overall we have concluded that the closure of the Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre of Excellence has been an example of how not to undertake decentralisation. The Government's failure to conduct any kind of economic appraisal before deciding to close the Centre is unacceptable. "

"The Committee was disappointed that the decision had been made with no stakeholder consultation, in particular, the Government did not consult then Chief Scientist of the [[New South Wales Department of Primary Industries|Department of Primary Industries]], and Director of the Centre, Professor [[Steve Kennelly]]. " }}

The Committees report made 13 recommendations, the first of which is:

{{Blockquote|"That the NSW Government reverse the decision to close the Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre of Excellence and not proceed with the closure.

"The Committee is working on the expectation that the NSW Government will accept Recommendation 1 based on the evidence of this report. In the event that the Government does not accept Recommendation 1, the Committee believes that the Government should consider the following recommendations. "&lt;ref name="enquiry-final report-media release Recommendation 1-p8"&gt;{{cite media release| last=Chung| first=C| title= Upper House Committee Reports on the Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre Closure (Recommendations) 5. 50 | url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/committee.nsf/0/b6d8ac60c3700e46ca257aa00015215f/$FILE/Media%20Release%20&amp;%20Recommendations.pdf| publisher=Select Committee on Cronulla Fisheries Closures| accessdate=21 November 2012| page=8| format=PDF| date=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report then details a further 12 recommendations.&lt;ref name="enquiry-final report-media release further recommendations"&gt;{{cite media release| last=Chung| first=C| title= Upper House Committee Reports on the Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre Closure (Recommendations) 5. 51 | url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/committee.nsf/0/b6d8ac60c3700e46ca257aa00015215f/$FILE/Media%20Release%20&amp;%20Recommendations.pdf| publisher=Select Committee on Cronulla Fisheries Closures| accessdate=21 November 2012| pages=8-10| format=PDF| date=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Josephine Tovey in ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' reported that: "The inquiry,&amp;nbsp;... found the decision to close the centre and decentralise its activities to several coastal towns was made without any economic analysis, in conflict with the Government's own policies, and was never presented to cabinet.

==== Government response and outcomes ====
In September/October 2011, the [[O'Farrell ministry|O'Farrell Government]] announced closure of the centre and regional disbursement of the positions. Staff mounted an industrial and community campaign, including a website.&lt;ref name=close2012&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.savecronullafisheries.net/|title=Cronulla fisheries to be closed and destroyed|last=|first=|date=16 November 2012|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140210130316/http://www.savecronullafisheries.net/|archive-date=10 January 2014|dead-url=yes|access-date=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

Minister for Primary Industries, Katrina Hodgkinson, together with Minister [[Andrew Stoner]], the [[Deputy Premier of New South Wales|Deputy Premier]], announced on 8 September 2011 that the Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre of Excellence at Hungry Point, known as the Cronulla Fisheries site, was to be closed and its roles and functions were to be decentralised to regional coastal locations. Associate Professor David Harley {{post-nominals|country=AUS|AM}} was appointed by the Department of Primary Industries director general to assess the future usages of the site under specific terms of reference.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1546&gt;NSW Parliamentary Hansard, 21/2/2013, 17540&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

The Select Committee Inquiry into the Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre closure was published on 23 October 2012. On 22 November 2012, employees were advised that all further decommissioning of the site at Cronulla would be placed on hold until such time the Government responds to the recommendations made by the Committee's report and that no individual would be forced to make a decision, including to transfer or exit. However, where a staff member has already agreed to relocate, the Government has a duty of care to support them in their move at this time, and is therefore unable to simply cease offering this support. Similarly, the Government remains committed to a Decade of Decentralisation and recruitment for positions in regional locations needs to continue irrespective of the Government's response to the Committee's report. The Deputy Premier and Minister for Primary Industries announced the Government response on 14 December 2012.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1547&gt;Katrina Hodgkinson, MInister for Primary Industries, in NSW Parliamentary Hansard, 21/2/2013, 17535&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt; On 23 October 2012, the committee required the government to provide a response by 23 April 2014. Fred Nile claimed success at a rally to save the Fisheries Centre when the closure was "put on hold" on 21 November 2012. The NSW Government agreed to temporarily halt the closure until it could respond to the committees report,&lt;ref name="Nile-closureon hold"/&gt; but in December 2012 the Government rejected the main recommendation of the parliamentary inquiry and pressed ahead with closing the Centre.&lt;ref name=leader-close&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theleader.com.au/story/1186909/its-official-cronulla-fisheries-research-centre-will-close/ |title=It’s official: Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre will close |work=[[St George and Sutherland Shire Leader]] |date=14 December 2012 |accessdate=22 October 2014 |first=Murray |last=Trembath}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stoner and Hodgkinson gave a commitment that the site would remain in public ownership, with increased access to the public. On 4 April 2013 the Hungry Point Reserve Trust Board appointments were announced, to manage the area of the former Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre.&lt;ref name=dpi-pr-trust&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/462885/130401-med-rel-AS-Fisheries-Trust.pdf |title=TRUST BOARD TO MANAGE EX-FISHERIES RESEARCH SITE |publisher=NSW Government |date=2 April 2013 |accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Trust manages the [[Crown land|Crown Reserve land]], the volunteer [[Marine Rescue NSW]] partly occupied the site (buildings 1, 3, 5, 9 and 22) by license,&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1548&gt;Architectural Projects, 2016, 18&lt;/ref&gt; NSW Water Police and [[Roads and Maritime Services]] took up other existing facilities on site.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1548/&gt;&lt;ref name="nswshr-1011-1535" /&gt;&lt;ref name=leader-safe&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theleader.com.au/story/1406972/fisheries-site-safe/?cs=1507 |title=Fisheries site safe |work=St George and Sutherland Shire Leader |date=5 April 2013 |accessdate=22 October 2014 |last=Trembath |first=Murray}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre of Excellence (CFRC) is a purpose built research facility on approximately three hectares on a headland in the Sydney suburb of Cronulla.1 It was the first fisheries research centre in Australia having been identified for the purpose by Harald Dannevig in 1895.2 The site as a whole is heritage listed, as are several individual aspects, these include the former hatchery building, the boat [[shed]] and the aquaria.3 There are three Aboriginal middens on the site that are also heritage listed. The CFRC site is wholly owned by the NSW Government.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1549&gt;Parliament of NSW. Legislative Council, 2012, 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

=== Elements of the site include ===

;Former hatchery building
An L-shaped brick building with two wings, located on a flat (benched) area slightly above a boat shed and fish ponds at the western side of Hungry Point. Web-fired single skin [[brickwork]] walls with original single back [[Pier (architecture)|piers]] and additional recent brick piers and [[buttress]]es to southern wing. New colourbond [[Corrugated galvanised iron|corrugated iron]] roof. Interior of northern wing adapted for office use; southern [[veranda]]h of other wing infilled. Original features include door and window joinery.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

;Boat shed
Weatherboard wall, new colourbond corrugated iron [[gable]] roof. Located on eroded sea wall at edge of Port Hacking on western side of Hungry Point. Recent roller door on east side. Doors at west provide evidence of location of former wharf.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

;Fish pond
Concrete pool measuring {{convert|30|x|12|x|2|m}}, featuring more recent concrete sea wall, mesh sunshades and filter units.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

;Aboriginal middens
# Rockshelter with midden deposits which extend downslope for a distance of at least five metres below the shelter.
# Small area of midden down near holding pens on western side of complex.
# Large area of midden along the southeastern edge of the flat area at the top of the complex between building 15 and the fuel store beyond.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

The area would have provided rich marine resources for Aboriginal inhabitants, in terms of both food resources and shelter. Shellfish and fish such as Sydney rock whelk and Sydney rock oyster were integral to the diet of coastal tribes, as were snapper and bream.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1550&gt;Attenbrow, 2010, 63: Therin, 2005, 13&lt;/ref&gt; Both men and women spent considerable time fishing from bark canoes with hooks made from ground Turban shell, and line made from twine from the cabbage tree palm leaf.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1551&gt;Dallas, 2004, 39&lt;/ref&gt; Shell middens result from Aboriginal exploitation and consumption of shellfish or mammal bone, stone artefacts, hearths, charcoal and occasionally, burials. They are usuaully located on elevated dry ground close to the aquatic environment from which the shellfish was exploited and where fresh water resources were available.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

;Littoral Rainforest Remnant
A remnant patch of forest survives on the site in Darook Park. This remnant is of a listed endangered ecological community in NSW, Littoral Rainforest overlooking Port Hacking. Port Jackson figs (Ficus rubiginosa) and other tree, shrubs such as endangered species, Prostanthera densa (villous mint bush) and groundcover species make up the community.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

=== Condition ===

As at 24 November 2000, Aboriginal middens have archaeological potential, subject to greater need of preservation.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

=== Further information ===

Future management of these structures will aim to conserve all the original fabrics to maintain evidence and allow for the interpretation of their past uses. Consideration will be given to removing detracting elements from the exterior of the former hatchery building if structural investigation is permitted and a maintenance schedule, including painting of timber joinery in period colours may be instigated for three original structures.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

In September/October 1911, the [[O'Farrell ministry|O'Farrell Government]] announces closure of the centre and regional disbursement of the positions. Staff mounted an industrial and community campaign.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

== Heritage listing ==
As at 31 March 2010, the Cronulla Fisheries Centre site as a whole is of national and state heritage significance because it is the first marine investigation establishment in Australia, commencing in 1904. It has had continual association with NSW and Commonwealth Government Fisheries investigations since then. The complex is associated with the work of the first Director of NSW and Commonwealth fisheries investigations, Harald Dannevig. Three original structures still exist on the site and are considered as a group to have State significance.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1552&gt;NSW Fisheries s.170 Register p81&lt;/ref&gt;

Cronulla Fisheries Centre was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

==Background==

Cruz Garcia was born on 27 June 1983 in San Juan, Puerto Rico to Cruz "Pensa" Garcia (born 1958) and Lourdes Santiago (born 1959). His father is an international athletic coach and physical trainer.  Cruz "Pensa" Garcia trained several Olympic athletes and world boxing champions. Boxers trained by Cruz "Pensa" Garcia include Puerto Rican [[International Boxing Hall of Fame]] inductee [[Felix Trinidad]], retired former champion [[Alex Sánchez (boxer)|Alex Sanchez]], and Argentinean former world champion [[Marcos Maidana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rafael, Dan|url=http://espn.go.com/boxing/story/_/id/10078707/oscar-de-la-hoya-headlines-2014-boxing-hall-class  |title=De La Hoya in 2014 Class|publisher=''[[ESPN]]''|date= 4 December 2013|accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Primera Hora|url=http://www.primerahora.com/deportes/boxeo/nota/afilaocomonavaja-147787/  |title=Afila'o Como Navaja |publisher=''Primera Hora''|date= 16 January 2008|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Morilla, Diego|url=http://espn.go.com/boxing/story/_/id/7008688/win-cost|title=Maidana: I Have to Win at All Cost|publisher=''[[ESPN]]''|date= 16 January 2008|accessdate=23 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of a family of athletes and coaches, Cruz and his brother Manuel Garcia (an international runner and CAC Junior Champion), were track and field athletes and trained alongside world class athletes and boxing champions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ponce Ruiz, Luis|url=http://revistacruce.com/politica-sociedad/cruce-y-cruz-entrevista-en-tres-partes-al-arq-cruz-garcia-parte-2.html|title=Cruce y Cruz: Entrevista en Tres Partes al Arq.

A crucial point in Cruz Garcia's studies happened in 2008, during Felix Trinidad's last fight as a professional boxer. In his fight versus former world champion [[Roy Jones Jr.]], Trinidad brought Garcia as part of his training team to New York in order for him to complete his research on Narrative Architectures with pieces exposed in the Museum of Modern Art in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ponce Ruiz, Luis |url=http://revistacruce.com/politica-sociedad/cruce-y-cruz-entrevista-en-tres-partes-al-arq-cruz-garcia-parte-3.html |title=Cruce y Cruz: Entrevista en Tres Partes al Arq.

== Career==

After receiving a master's degree in Architecture from the [[University of Puerto Rico]], Cruz Garcia moved from Puerto Rico to Brussels, Belgium, where he founded WAI Architecture Think Tank with Nathalie Frankowski. Also during 2008, Cruz Garcia and Nathalie Frankowski started collaborating on the art collective [[Garcia Frankowski]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alvarez, Paula|url= http://book-a.net/booka/islasformastexto/updates/60?lang=en|title=On Manifestos, form, criticism and autonomy: Interview with Garcia Frankowski|publisher=''Book-A.net''|date= 5 August 2013|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alvarez, Paula|url= http://arqa.com/actualidad/entrevistas/entrevista-a-garcia-frankowski-manifiestos-formas-critica-y-autonomia.html|title=Entrevista a Garcia Frankowski: Formas Critica y Autonomia|publisher=''Arqa''|date= 26 August 2013|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2009 both WAI and Garcia Frankowski operate mainly from Beijing making international publications, exhibitions, writings, and architectural projects from the Chinese capital.

Cruz Garcia is the co-editor-in-chief of What About It? an independent architecture and urbanism magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Cormier, Brendan|url= http://popupcity.net/diy-publishing-an-interview-with-what-about-it/|title=DIY Publishing: An Interview with What About It?|publisher=''The Popup City''|date= 17 March 2011|accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Cruz Garcia and Nathalie Frankowski designed and published the book Pure Hardcore Icons: A Manifesto on Pure Form in Architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Cursive''' (also known as '''script''' or '''longhand''', among other names{{efn|Also known as '''handwriting''', '''looped writing''', '''joint writing''', '''joined-up writing''', or '''running writing'''}}) is any style of [[penmanship]] in which some characters are written joined together in a flowing manner, generally for the purpose of making writing faster. Formal cursive is generally joined, but casual cursive is a combination of joins and pen lifts. The writing style can be further divided as "looped", "[[Italic script|italic]]" or "connected".

The cursive method is used with a number of alphabets due to its improved writing speed and infrequent pen lifting. In some alphabets, many or all letters in a word are connected, sometimes making a word one single complex stroke.

== Descriptions ==
Cursive is a style of penmanship in which the symbols of the language are written in a [[wikt:conjoin|conjoin]]ed and/or ''flowing'' manner, generally for the purpose of making writing faster. This writing style is distinct from "printscript" using [[block letters]], in which the letters of a word are unconnected and in Roman/Gothic letterform rather than joined-up script. Not all cursive [[copybook (education)|copybook]]s join all letters: formal cursive is generally joined, but casual cursive is a combination of joins and pen lifts. In the [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]], [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac]], [[Latin script|Latin]], and [[Cyrillic (script)|Cyrillic]] alphabets, many or all letters in a word are connected, sometimes making a word one single complex stroke. In [[cursive Hebrew|Hebrew cursive]] and [[Roman cursive]], the letters are not connected. In Maharashtra there is a version of Cursive called [[Modi alphabet|'Modi']]

=== Subclasses ===

==== Ligature ====
Ligature is writing the letters of words with lines connecting the letters so that one does not have to pick up the pen or pencil between letters.  Commonly some of the letters are written in a looped manner to facilitate the connections. In common printed Greek texts, the modern small letter fonts are called "cursive" (as opposed to uncial) though the letters do not connect.

==== Looped ====
[[file:Looped cursive sample.jpg|thumb|alt=The first verse of "Good King Wenceslas" in cursive|Looped cursive as taught in Britain in mid-20th century]]
In ''looped cursive'' penmanship, some [[ascender (typography)|ascender]]s and [[descender]]s have loops which provide for joins.  This is generally what people refer to when they say "cursive".{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

==== Italic ====
''[[italic script|Cursive italic]]'' penmanship—derived from [[chancery cursive]]—uses non-looped joins or no joins. In italic cursive, there are no joins from g, j, q or y, and a few other joins are discouraged.&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704631504575531932754922518 |title=How Handwriting Boosts the Brain |first=Gwendolyn |last=Bounds |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=October 5, 2010 |publisher=[[Dow Jones &amp; Company|Dow Jones]] |location=[[New York, NY|New York]] |issn=0099-9660 |accessdate=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=March 2015}} Italic penmanship became popular in the 15th-century Italian Renaissance. The term "italic" as it relates to handwriting is not to be confused with [[italic type]]d letters that slant forward. Many, but not all, letters in the handwriting of the Renaissance were joined, as most are today in cursive italic.

== Origin ==
The origins of the cursive method are associated with practical advantages of writing speed and infrequent pen-lifting to accommodate the limitations of the [[quill]]. Quills are fragile, easily broken, and will spatter unless used properly. Steel [[dip pen]]s followed quills; they were sturdier, but still had some limitations. The individuality of the provenance of a document (see [[Signature]]) was a factor also, as opposed to machine [[font]].&lt;ref&gt;Georges Jean (1997). ''Writing: The Story of Alphabets and Scripts'', London: Thames and Hudson Ltd. ['[[New Horizons (Thames &amp; Hudson)|New Horizons]]' series]&lt;/ref&gt;
Cursive was also favored because the writing tool was rarely taken off the paper.
The term ''cursive'' derives from the 18th century [[Italian language|Italian]] ''corsivo'' from [[Medieval Latin]] ''cursivus'', which literally means ''running''. This term in turn derives from [[Latin]] ''currere'' ("to run, hasten").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harper|first=Douglas|title=cursive|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cursive|work=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(also known in Bengali as "professional writing"{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}) the letters are more likely to be more curvy in appearance than in standard Bengali handwriting. Also, the horizontal supporting bar on each letter ([[Bengali alphabet#The matra|''matra'']]) runs continuously through the entire word, unlike in standard handwriting. This cursive handwriting often used by literature experts differs in appearance from the [[Bengali script|standard Bengali alphabet]] as it is free hand writing, where sometimes the alphabets are complex and appear different from the standard handwriting.

{{Main|Roman cursive}}
[[File:Hocgracili.jpg|thumb|right|Example of old Roman cursive]]
''Roman cursive'' is a form of handwriting (or a [[script (styles of handwriting)|script]]) used in [[ancient Rome]] and to some extent into the [[Middle Ages]]. It is customarily divided into old (or ancient) cursive, and new cursive. Old Roman cursive, also called [[majuscule]] cursive and capitalis cursive, was the everyday form of handwriting used for writing letters, by merchants writing business accounts, by schoolchildren learning the [[Latin alphabet]], and even by [[Roman Emperor|emperors]] issuing commands. New Roman, also called [[minuscule cursive]] or later cursive, developed from old cursive. It was used from approximately the 3rd century to the 7th century, and uses letter forms that are more recognizable to modern eyes; "a", "b", "d", and "e" have taken a more familiar shape, and the other letters are proportionate to each other rather than varying wildly in size and placement on a line.

{{Main|History of the Greek alphabet}}
[[File:Greek manuscript cursive 6th century.png|thumb|right|Ancient Greek cursive script, 6th century A.D.]]

The [[Greek alphabet]] has had several cursive forms in the course of its development. In antiquity, a cursive form of handwriting was used in writing on [[papyrus]]. It employed slanted and partly connected letter forms as well as many [[Typographic ligature|ligature]]s. Some features of this handwriting were later adopted into Greek minuscule, the dominant form of handwriting in the medieval and early modern era. In the 19th and 20th centuries, an entirely new form of cursive Greek, more similar to contemporary Western European cursive scripts, was developed.

== Western Europe ==
During the Middle Ages, the flowing, connected cursive script of the Arabic language inspired Western Christian scholars to develop similar cursive scripts for Latin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Eastern Mysteries: An Encyclopedic Guide to the Sacred Languages &amp; Magickal Systems of the World (Key of It All) |author=Hulse, David Allen | publisher=Llewellyn Publications | year=2002 | isbn=978-1567184280 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sWHjIxkvXYEC | page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; These scripts then became the basis for all of the Latin-based cursive scripts used in Europe.

=== English ===
[[File:letter.posted.in.1894.arp.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Cursive in English letter from 1894]]
[[File:Shakespeare-Testament.jpg|thumb|[[William Shakespeare]]'s will, written in ''secretary hand''&lt;ref&gt;''Cardenio, Or, the Second Maiden's Tragedy'', pp. 131-3: By William Shakespeare, [[Charles Hamilton (handwriting expert)|Charles Hamilton]], John Fletcher (Glenbridge Publishing Ltd., 1994) {{ISBN|0-944435-24-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Cursive writing was used in English before the [[Norman conquest]]. [[Anglo-Saxon Charters]] typically include a boundary clause written in [[Old English]] in a cursive script. A cursive handwriting style—[[secretary hand]]—was widely used for both personal correspondence and official documents in England from early in the 16th century.

Cursive handwriting developed into something approximating its current form from the 17th century, but its use was neither uniform, nor standardized either in England itself or elsewhere in the [[British Empire]]. In the English colonies of the early 17th century, most of the letters are clearly separated in the handwriting of [[William Bradford (1590-1657)|William Bradford]], though a few were joined as in a cursive hand. In England itself, Edward Cocker had begun to introduce a version of the French ''[[Ronde script (calligraphy)|ronde]]''&lt;!-- sic --&gt; style, which was then further developed and popularized throughout the [[British Empire]] in the 17th and 18th centuries as [[round hand]] by John Ayers and William Banson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Whalley|first=Joyce Irene|title=The Art of Calligraphy, Western Europe &amp; America|year=1980|publisher=Bloomsbury|location=London|isbn=0-906223-64-4|page=400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the American colonies, on the eve of their independence from the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], it is notable that [[Thomas Jefferson]] joined most, but not all the letters when drafting the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. However, a few days later, [[Timothy Matlack]] professionally re-wrote the presentation copy of the Declaration in a fully joined, cursive hand. Eighty-seven years later, in the middle of the 19th century, [[Abraham Lincoln]] drafted the [[Gettysburg Address]] in a cursive hand that would not look out of place today.

Note that not all such cursive, then or now, joined all of the letters within a word.

[[File:HandwritingOfOneJohnJay(NotTheFamousOne).jpg|thumb|right|Cursive handwriting from the 19th-century USA.]]
In both the British Empire and the United States in the 18th and 19th centuries, before the typewriter, professionals used cursive for their correspondence. This was called a "fair hand", meaning it looked good, and firms trained their clerks to write in exactly the same script.

In the early days{{when|date=June 2017}} of the [[post office]], letters were written in cursive&amp;nbsp;– and to fit more text on a single sheet, the text was continued in lines [[Crossed letter|crossing at 90 degrees from the original text]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Arrow of Chaos: Romanticism and Postmodernity|last = Livingston|first = Ira|publisher = University of Minnesota Press|year = 1997|isbn = 0816627959|location = |pages = 143|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ySwihw-VVP4C&amp;pg=PT143#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|chapter = The Romantic Double-Cross: Keats's Letters}}&lt;/ref&gt; Block letters were not suitable for this.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Although women's handwriting had noticeably different particulars from men's, the general forms were not prone to rapid change. In the mid-19th century, most children were taught the contemporary cursive; in the United States, this usually occurred in second or third grade (around ages seven to nine). Few simplifications appeared as the middle of the 20th century approached.{{citation needed|date=December 2009}}

After the 1960s, a movement originally begun by [[Paul Standard]] in the 1930s to replace looped cursive with cursive italic penmanship resurfaced. It was motivated by the claim that cursive instruction was more difficult than it needed to be: that conventional (looped) cursive was unnecessary, and it was easier to write in cursive italic. Because of this, a number of various new forms of cursive italic appeared, including [[Getty-Dubay]], and [[Barchowsky Fluent Handwriting]]. In the 21st century, some of the surviving cursive writing styles are [[Spencerian script|Spencerian]], [[Palmer Method]], [[D'Nealian]], and Zaner-Bloser script.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/from-punishing-to-pleasurable-how-cursive-writing-is-looping-back-into-our-hearts/2018/08/31/aa180b9c-aa06-11e8-a8d7-0f63ab8b1370_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.88491996752d] {{dead link|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest forms of new technology that caused the decline of handwriting was the invention of the [[ballpoint pen]], patented in 1888 by John Loud. Two brothers, László and György Bíró, further developed the pen by changing the design and using different ink that dried quickly. With their design, it was guaranteed that the ink would not smudge, as it would with the earlier design of pen, and it no longer required the careful penmanship one would use with the older design of pen. After World War II, the ballpoint pen was mass-produced and sold for a cheap price, changing the way people wrote. Over time the emphasis of using the style of cursive to write slowly declined{{quantify|date=August 2017}}, only to be later impacted by other technologies such as the phone, computer, and keyboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How The Ballpoint Pen Killed Cursive|url = https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/08/ballpoint-pens-object-lesson-history-handwriting/402205/|website = The Atlantic|accessdate = 2015-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Decline of Handwriting|last = Enstrom|first = E.A.|date = 1965|journal = The Elementary School Journal|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cursive has been in decline throughout the 21st century due to its perceived lack of necessity. The Fairfax Education Association, the largest teachers' union in Fairfax County, Virginia, has called cursive a "dying art". Many consider cursive too tedious to learn and believe that it is not a useful skill.&lt;ref name="Shapiro"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Cursive handwriting is disappearing from public schools|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/cursive-handwriting-disappearing-from-public-schools/2013/04/04/215862e0-7d23-11e2-a044-676856536b40_story.html |newspaper=The Washington Post |date = 2013-04-04|access-date = 2015-10-30|issn = 0190-8286|first = T.

On the 2006 [[SAT]], a United States post-secondary education entrance exam, only 15 percent of the students wrote their essay answers in cursive.&lt;ref name="washpost"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Handwriting Is on the Wall |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=11 October 2006 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/10/AR2006101001475_2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, students might be discouraged from using cursive on standardized tests due to exams written in hard to read handwriting receive less marks, and some graders may have difficulties reading cursive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/22/exam-markers-complain-about-students-blue-ink-scribbles|title=Poor handwriting 'may hinder students' chances of exam success'|first=Richard|last=Adams|date=21 August 2016|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2007 survey of 200 teachers of first through third grades in all 50 American states, 90 percent of respondents said their schools required the teaching of cursive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Schools debate: Is cursive writing worth teaching? |newspaper= [[USA Today]] |date=23 January 2009 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2009-01-23-cursive-handwriting_N.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 nationwide survey found elementary school teachers lacking formal training in teaching handwriting to students. Only 12 percent of teachers reported having taken a course in how to teach it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Graham|first=Steve|author2=Harris, Karen R. |author3=Mason, Linda |author4=Fink-Chorzempa, Barbara |author5=Moran, Susan |author6=Saddler, Bruce |title=How do primary grade teachers teach handwriting?

In 2012, the American states of [[Indiana]] and [[Hawaii]] announced that their schools will no longer be required to teach cursive (but will still be permitted to), and instead will be required to teach "keyboard proficiency". Since the nationwide proposal of the [[Common Core State Standards]] in 2009, which do not include instruction in cursive, the standards have been adopted by 44 states as of July 2011, all of which have debated whether to augment them with cursive.&lt;ref name="TIME Newsfeed"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://newsfeed.time.com/2011/07/06/typing-beats-scribbling-indiana-schools-can-stop-teaching-cursive/?iid=nfmostpopular |title=Typing Beats Scribbling: Indiana Schools Can Stop Teaching Cursive |first=Kayla  |last=Webley |work=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]] |date=6 July 2011|accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/01/hawaii-no-longer-requires_n_915402.html "Hawaii No Longer Requires Teaching Cursive In Schools"].

==== Conservation efforts and cognitive benefits ====
Many historical documents, such as the United States Constitution, are written in cursive—the inability to read cursive therefore precludes one from being able to fully appreciate such documents in their original format.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Five Reasons Kids Should Still Learn Cursive Writing|url = http://time.com/2820780/five-reasons-kids-should-still-learn-cursive-writing/|website = TIME.com|accessdate = 2015-10-30|first = Katy|last = Steinmetz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the decline in the day-to-day use of cursive, it is being reintroduced to the curriculum of schools in the United States. States such as California, Idaho, Kansas, Massachusetts, North Carolina, South Carolina, New Jersey, and Tennessee have already mandated cursive in schools as a part of the Back to Basics program designed to maintain the integrity of cursive handwriting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Is cursive handwriting slowly dying out in America?|url = https://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/long-held-tradition-cursive-handwriting-slowly-dying-america/|website = PBS NewsHour|accessdate = 2015-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cursive instruction is required by grade 5 in Illinois, starting with the 2018-2019 school year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = An act concerning education|url = http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/publicacts/fulltext.asp?Name=100-0548|website = ILGA.gov|accessdate = 2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some{{who|date=December 2015}} argue that cursive is not worth teaching in schools and "in the 1960s cursive was implemented because of preference and not an educational basis; Hawaii and Indiana have replaced cursive instruction with 'keyboard proficiency' and 44 other states are currently weighing similar measures."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Is Cursive Handwriting Going Extinct?|url = http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/is-cursive-handwriting-going-extinct-734564/|website = Smithsonian|accessdate = 2015-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{attribution needed|date=December 2015}}

With the widespread use of computers, researchers set out to test the effectiveness of both mediums. In a study done by Pam Mueller which compared scores of students who took notes by hand and via laptop computer showed that students who took notes by hand showed advantages in both factual and conceptual learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Pen Is Mightier Than the Keyboard: Advantages of Longhand Over Laptop Note Taking|last = Mueller|first = Pam|date = 2014|journal = Psychological Science|doi = 10.1177/0956797614524581|pmid = 24760141|access-date =|volume=25|pages=1159–1168}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study done by Anne Mangen showed that children showed an acceleration in learning new words when they wrote them by hand rather than on a computer screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Handwriting versus Keyboard Writing: Effect on Word Recall|last = Mangen|first = Anne|date = 2015|journal = Journal of Writing Research|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Learning to write in cursive is alleged (by its practitioners) to be a stepping stone to developing neat handwriting, and, in a third study conducted by Florida International University, professor Laura Dinehart concluded that students with neater handwriting tend to develop better reading and writing skills, though it is difficult to conclude causation from such an association.&lt;ref name="Shapiro"/&gt; Aside from these cognitive benefits, students with dyslexia, who have difficulty learning to read because their brains have difficulty associating sounds and letter combinations efficiently, have found that cursive can help them with the decoding process because it integrates hand-eye coordination, fine motor skills and other brain and memory functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How cursive can help students with dyslexia connect the dots|url = https://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/connecting-dots-role-cursive-dyslexia-therapy/|website = PBS NewsHour|accessdate = 2015-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, students with dysgraphia may be badly served, even substantially hindered, by demands for cursive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Myths and Fact...Dysgraphia|url = https://www.nursingcenter.com/journalarticle?Article_ID=789157|website = NURSING Magazine|accessdate = 2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== German ===
Up to the 19th century, [[Kurrent]] (also known as ''German cursive'') was used in German language longhand. Kurrent was not used exclusively, but in parallel to modern cursive (which is the same as English cursive). Writers used both cursive styles: location, contents and context of the text determined which style to use. A successor of Kurrent, [[Sütterlin]], was widely used in the period 1911-1941 until the Nazi Party banned it, and German speakers brought up with Sütterlin continued to use it well into the post-war period.

Today, three different styles of cursive writing are taught in German schools, the {{ill|Lateinische Ausgangsschrift|de|Lateinische Ausgangsschrift|vertical-align=sup}} (introduced in 1953), the {{ill|Schulausgangsschrift|de|Schulausgangsschrift|vertical-align=sup}} (1968), and the {{ill|Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift|de|Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift|vertical-align=sup}} (1969).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grundschrift-schreibschrift.de|title=Grundschrift-Schreibschrift|work=grundschrift-schreibschrift.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German National Primary Schoolteachers' Union has proposed replacing all three with [[Grundschrift]], a simplified form of non-cursive handwriting adopted by [[Hamburg]] schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/29/germany-teachers-handwriting-schools-schreibschrift|title=German teachers campaign to simplify handwriting in schools|author=Helen Pidd|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Russian ==
[[File:Russian Cursive Cyrillic.svg|thumb|right|The standard modern Russian Cyrillic cursive alphabet with uppercase and lowercase letters, used in school education.]]
{{main|Russian cursive}}
The ''Russian Cursive [[Cyrillic]]'' alphabet is used (instead of [[Russian alphabet|the block letters]]) when handwriting the modern [[Russian language]]. While several letters resemble Latin counterparts, many of them represent different sounds. Most handwritten Russian, especially personal letters and schoolwork, uses the cursive Russian (Cyrillic) alphabet. Most children in Russian schools are taught in the 1st grade how to write using this Russian script.

== Chinese ==
Cursive forms of [[Chinese written language|Chinese characters]] are used in calligraphy; "running script" is the [[Semi-cursive script|semi-cursive]] form and [[Cursive script (East Asia)|"rough script"]] (mistakenly called "grass script" due to misinterpretation) is the cursive. The running aspect of this script has more to do with the formation and connectedness of strokes ''within'' an individual character than with connections between characters as in Western connected cursive. The latter are rare in [[hanzi]] and in the derived Japanese [[kanji]] characters which are usually well separated by the writer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8061">'''Deculturalization''' is the process by which an ethnic group is forced to abandon its language, culture, and customs. It is the destruction of the culture of a dominated group and its replacement by the culture of the dominating group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Branch|first1=André J|title=Deculturalization|url=http://knowledge.sagepub.com/view/diversityineducation/n190.xml|website=SAGE knowledge|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc|accessdate=9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deculturalization is a slow process due to its extensive goal of fully replacing the subordinate ethnic group's culture, language, and customs. This term is often confused with [[Assimilation (sociology)|assimilation]] and [[acculturation]].

==Methods of Deculturalization==
* [[Geographical segregation]]
* Forbidding education to the dominated group
* Forceful replacing of language
* Superior culture's curriculum in schools
* Instructors are from the dominant group
* Avoiding the dominated group's culture in curriculum

==Deculturalization in the United States==
'''African Americans'''
The enslavement of African Americans during the 18th and 19th centuries in the United States is a form of deculturalization. [[Slavery in the United States]] made the African Americans dependent on their owners allowing for the owners to exploit them. The owners removed their African names, did not allow them to read, and did not allow them to practice their culture and language. Deculturalization of African Americans stems back to When the African American slaves were forbidden access to education due to fear of a slave revolt against the slaveholders.&lt;ref&gt;http://h637-books.wikispaces.com/Deculturalization+and+the+Struggle+for+Equality&lt;/ref&gt; A series of court cases occurred in the United States helping deculturalization of African Americans as wells as there were cases that went against deculturalization. For example, the addition of the [[14th Amendment to the United States Constitution]], the [[Dred Scott v. Sandford]] decision, [[Brown v. Board of Education]], [[Plessy v. Ferguson]], and countless others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://prezi.com/ukhxfexpakmq/deculturalization-of-education/|title=Deculturalization of Education|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Civil War (United States)]] segregated education continued and was a struggle to integrate fully and completely. While integration was achieved, the textbooks that the African American students learn from are bias and contain material from the dominant, Anglo-American culture.

'''Latin Americans'''
The deculturalization of Latinos can refer back to the Mexican–American War and [[The Treaty Of Guadalupe Hidalgo]]. Once the United States won California, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, and parts of Wyoming and Colorado Mexicans who were living in these areas were removed from their lands. Their identity in the United States changed constantly from Mexican to White and vice versa until the word Hispanic was created to refer to these Mexican Americans. By simply using the word Hispanic to refer to the Mexican Americans and later the Latin-American immigrants refers to the conqueror's culture-the Spanish culture. Latin@ in the United States also had segregated schooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/latino/latinothemestudy/education.htm|title=Demanding their Rights: The Latino Struggle for Educational Access and Equity|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In schools they were given second-hand material from the wealthy, Anglo schools. When Latinos were being integrated, they as well as the African Americans, were being taught from bias, Anglo-cultured, Anglo-praising textbooks. Latinos did have a win to have bilingual education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civilrights.org/resources/civilrights101/desegregation.html|title=School Desegregation and Equal Educational Opportunity|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While they were allowed to have bilinugal education, the primary, enforced language is the English one. In some schools Latinos were corporally punished for speaking Spanish in the classroom. In some Universities, Latinos were also forced to take many speech classes in order to remove the accents of the Latinos when they spoke English.&lt;ref&gt;http://wolfweb.unr.edu/homepage/calabj/282/how%20to%20tame%20wild%20tongue.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; While that is not seen evidently in schools anymore, the education system continues to enforce English, Anglo-American customs, culture and language as the dominant one.

'''Asian Americans'''
Asian Americans began to be deculturalized by not being allowed to be naturalized, the Chinese-Exclusion Act, Japanese Internment, forbidding land ownership, and enforcing the Anglo-culture onto them. The [[Naturalization Act of 1790]] did not allow for the Chinese along with other Asians to become naturalized, because the naturalization process was limited only to the Anglo community in the United States.&lt;ref name="ecaasu.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecaasu.org/site/important-dates-in-asian-american-history/|title=Important Dates in Asian American History - East Coast Asian American Student Union|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of schooling, in some cases Asian Americans were denied an education entirely. It was not until the 1900s when Asian Americans were allowed to receive an education through the implementation of certain provisions. In 1855, the Chan Yong case fortified that the Chinese are not "white" therefore ineligible for citizenship due to the Naturalization Act of 1790.&lt;ref&gt;http://academic.evergreen.edu/curricular/mit2005/Winter/History/RacismTimelin2.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in 1922, the court case Ozawa v. United States, the Japanese man understood he was not allowed to be naturalized due to the former act, but asked for the Japanese to be considered white, but was denied the request.&lt;ref name="ecaasu.org"/&gt; The Ozawa v. United States shows how some Asians would rather refer to themselves as white than as Japanese or their individual ethnic group, because of the advantages that being "white" bring. The enforced Anglo-American culture upon the Asians and using them during the Cold War as a model minority that the United States is not racist, it is the individual's fault allows for deculturalization to be successful. [[Jade Snow Wong]] is a Chinese-American writer who was used by the American government to travel to the Asian world and show how an Asian can succeed in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/1790878/_Americas_Chinese_Anti-Communism_Citizenship_and_Cultural_Diplomacy_During_the_Cold_War|title="America's Chinese": Anti-Communism, Citizenship, and Cultural Diplomacy During the Cold War|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pre-Americans'''
Once the first settlement in Jamestown 1607 occurred, the Pre-American deculturalization process began. When the English came to America they looked to the Native Americans as "pagans" and "savages". Native Americans believed that the land was not property, a thing to be claimed and owned. Once the English settlers arrived this was one of the major culture difference that needed to be extinguished. The idea of private property and ownership was enforced upon the Native Americans. While even those who accepted it, because they understood the consequences, their lands were taken away. They wanted to impose the traditional "Christian" nuclear family as well among the Native Americans. In order to gain success the colonists made Native American Educational Programs. Christian missionaries such as John Eliot learned the Native American language in order to convert them into Christianity began the segregation among the "pagans" and the "holy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://prezi.com/11onrwncpstw/deculturalization-theory/|title=Deculturalization Theory|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Native Americans were exploited. There was a cultural genocide and simply genocide against the Native Americans. From the Trail of Tears to the appropriation of their designs in order to gain capital, corporate gains.

'''Distributed language''' represents an [[externalist]] perspective on human cognition. Instead of tracing communication to individual knowledge of a [[symbolic system]], language-activity is taken to sustain the human world.  Extending work by [[Humberto Maturana]], priority is given to how [[face-to-face interaction]] draws on multimodal activity or languaging .[1] As people language together, they gain the skills and knowledge needed to participate in a range of activities in which wordings play a part. Over time, these activities construct and maintain language as a whole. Distributed language thus links a biological theory of the [[origin of language]] to [[distributed cognition]]. Human cognitive and communicative abilities arise as people do things together while drawing on material, linguistic and other resources. Language activity is constrained by [[biology]], circumstances, and collective ways of life. While bodies sustain coordination, our lived realities are extended by the resources of a partly shared collective world. Thus, language cannot be separated from the artifacts and institutions or the behaviour of the living beings who undertake collaborative (and solo) tasks. This distributed perspective challenges the mainstream view that language use can be explained by individual competencies and microsocial rules. To ascribe 'language' to individual organisms is, on the distributed perspective, an error. Building on [[cognitive science]], the perspective challenges cognitive internalism by presenting language as a prime case of embodied and culturally embedded cognition. It emphasizes that the heterogeneity of human language does much to shape people, mind and society.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2256">In [[English drama]], a '''domestic tragedy''' is a [[tragedy]] in which the tragic protagonists are ordinary middle-class or lower-class individuals. This subgenre contrasts with [[classical antiquity|classical]] and [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] [[tragedy]], in which the protagonists are of kingly or [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] rank and their downfall is an affair of state as well as a personal matter. 

The [[Ancient Greek]] theorist [[Aristotle]] had argued that tragedy should concern only great individuals with great minds and souls, because their catastrophic downfall would be more emotionally powerful to the audience; only comedy should depict middle-class people. Domestic tragedy breaks with Aristotle's precepts, taking as its subjects merchants or citizens whose lives have less consequence in the wider world. 

In [[Great Britain|Britain]], the first domestic tragedies were written in the [[English Renaissance]]; one of the first was ''[[Arden of Faversham]]'' (1592), depicting the murder of a bourgeois man by his adulterous wife. Other famous examples are ''[[A Woman Killed with Kindness]]'' (1607), ''[[A Yorkshire Tragedy]]'' (1608), and ''[[The Witch of Edmonton]]'' (1621).&lt;ref name="SturgessHeywood2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Keith Sturgess|author2=Thomas Heywood|title=Three Elizabethan Domestic Tragedies: Arden of Faversham; a Yorkshire Tragedy; a Woman Killed with Kindness|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3kJ-JxlddCsC|date=23 February 2012|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-0-241-96146-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Othello]]'' can be classified as a domestic tragedy.&lt;ref name="Benson2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sean Benson|title=Shakespeare, 'Othello' and Domestic Tragedy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jgug588s3jgC&amp;pg=PT10|date=15 December 2011|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4411-3766-1|pages=10–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestic tragedy disappeared during the era of [[Restoration drama]], when Neoclassicism dominated the stage, but it emerged again with the work of [[George Lillo]] and Sir [[Richard Steele]] in the [[Augustan drama|eighteenth century]].

The '''Drexel University College of Computing &amp; Informatics''', formerly the '''College of Information Science and Technology''' or '''iSchool''', is one of the primary colleges of [[Drexel University]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]].  The College of Computing &amp; Informatics has faculty and administrative offices, research laboratories, and outreach centers in several locations including the Rush Building (Drexel University main campus; University Crossings (Drexel University main campus); 3401 Market Street (Drexel University main campus); One Drexel Plaza (Drexel University main campus); Monell Chemical Senses Center (Drexel University main campus); and the Drexel University Washington, D.C. Office.

The CCI was formed in September 2013 by merging the former College of Information Science and Technology (iSchool), the Department of Computer Science, and the Department of Computing and Security Technology. It is part of the [[List of information schools|iSchools Caucus]]. In fact the College of Information Science and Technology was one of the first three founding members that formed the iSchool Caucus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ischools.org/about/history/origins/|title=Origins|work=ischools.org|accessdate=7 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
CCI was created in 2013 as a result of merging the former College of Information Science and Technology (iSchool), the Department of Computer Science, and the Department of Computing and Security Technology. Details regarding the history of the iSchool is below:

===College of Information Science and Technology (iSchool)===
* College of Computing and Informatics ( 2013–Present)
* 1995-2013   College of Information Science and Technology 
* 1985-1995   College of Information Studies
* 1979-1985   School of Library and Information Science
* 1942-1979   Graduate School of Library Science
* 1922-1942   School of Library Science
* 1900-1914   Library School
* 1893-1900   Library Dept.
* 1892-1893   Library and Reading Room &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.library.drexel.edu/colleges|title=Drexel's colleges and schools, 1891 - present|work=drexel.edu|accessdate=7 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==

===Undergraduate===
The College of Computing &amp; Informatics offers six undergraduate programs: the Bachelor of Science in Information Systems (BSIS), Informatics (BSI), Information Technology (BSIT), Software Engineering (BSSE), Computing and Security Technology, [[Computer science|Computer Science (CS)]], and the BS/MS Accelerated Degree Program which allows students to complete both a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in five years. Most of the undergraduates take advantage of Drexel's [[Drexel University#Co-op program|long-standing co-op program]] to get real-world work experience before graduation.&lt;ref name="cci.drexel.edu"&gt;{{cite web|title=Drexel University College of Computing &amp; Informatics|url=http://cci.drexel.edu/|accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The college also has a Peer Mentor program through which incoming undergraduate students are assigned mentors who are current students in CCI programs. Any student can apply to be a Peer Mentor after their first year and be interviewed for selection.

===Graduate===
The college offers master's programs including the Master of Science (MS) in Library and Information Science, the Master of Science in Information Systems (MSIS), the Master of Science in Software Engineering (MSSE), the Master of Science in Computer Science (MSCS), the online Master of Science in Health Informatics (MSHI), the Master of Science in National Security Management (MSNSM), and a joint program with the Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering Department of Drexel's College of Engineering, the Master of Science in Cybersecurity (MSC).&lt;ref name="cci.drexel.edu"/&gt; Apart from these specialized programs, a dual degree (MS/MSIS) in Master of Science in Library and Information Science (MS) and Master of Science in Information Systems (MSIS) is also offered. The college also awards PhD degrees in Information Studies and Computer Science,&lt;ref name="cci.drexel.edu"/&gt; and offers various certificate programs for Professional Development.

===Special programs===
The former iSchool hosted the [[Pennsylvania Governor's School for Information, Society and Technology]] (PGSIST) from 1998 until 2008, at which time the PGSIST was canceled due to statewide budget cuts. The program included a full scholarship summer enrichment program which was committed to meeting the educational needs of academically talented high school students through a five-week-long on college campus program.

Developed jointly by the former iSchool and the Computer Science Department, Drexel now hosts the Drexel University Computing Academy (DUCA).

==Facilities==
One of the College's facilities includes the Rush Building at the corner of 33rd Street and Lancaster Avenue. Constructed in 1904, the Hospital for the Treatment of [[Consumption (disease)|Consumption]] and Related Diseases was named after [[Benjamin Rush]], the famous 18th-century Philadelphia physician and one of the signers of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].&lt;ref name="Rush Building"&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.ischool.drexel.edu/Home/About/Facilities/RushBuilding| title =Rush Building| publisher =The iSchool at Drexel University| accessdate =2010-03-31| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20100612152118/http://www.ischool.drexel.edu/Home/About/Facilities/RushBuilding| archivedate =2010-06-12| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, Drexel University acquired the building to in part house its Graduate School of Library Science.

From 1978 to 1981, the Rush Building was renovated for sole use by the library and information science programs. The project cost $2.4 million, $1 million of which came from a Pew Charitable Trusts grant. 2006 saw the renovation of the lobby and expansion of the Alumni Garden. In 2008, the Computing Resource Center (computer lab for use exclusively by IST students) was remodeled and renamed the iCommons.

[[File:Paris July 2011-30.jpg|thumb|The [[Arc de Triomphe]] of the [[Place de l'Étoile]], one of the most famous example of Empire architecture, commissioned in 1806 after the victory at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] by [[Napoleon|Emperor Napoleon I]]]]
The '''Empire style''' ({{IPA-fr|ɑ̃.piːʁ}}, ''style Empire'') is an early-nineteenth-century [[design]] movement in [[architecture]], [[furniture]], other [[decorative arts]], and the [[visual arts]], representing the second phase of [[Neoclassicism]]. It flourished between 1800 and 1815 during the [[French Consulate|Consulate]] and the [[First French Empire]] periods, although its life span lasted until the late-1820s. From France it spread into much of Europe and the United States. 

The style originated in and takes its name from the rule of the Emperor [[Napoleon I]] in the [[First French Empire]], when it was intended to idealize Napoleon's leadership and the French state. The previous fashionable style in France had been the [[Directoire style]], a more austere and minimalist form of Neoclassicism, that replaced the [[Louis XVI style]].  The Empire style brought a full return to ostentatious richness.  The style corresponds somewhat to the [[Biedermeier]] style in the German-speaking lands, [[Federal style]] in the United States, and the [[Regency style]] in Britain. 

==History==
[[File:Versailles Grand Trianon Napoleon's Chamber.jpg|thumb|Napoleon's bedchamber in the [[Grand Trianon]], [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] epitomizes the [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical style]] of the [[First French Empire]]]]

The style developed and elaborated the Directoire style of the immediately preceding period, which aimed at a simpler, but still elegant evocation of the virtues of the [[Ancient Roman Republic]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The [[stoicism|stoic]] virtues of Republican Rome were upheld as standards not merely for the arts but also for political behaviour and private morality. ''Conventionels'' saw themselves as antique heroes. Children were named after [[Brutus]], [[Solon]] and [[Lycurgus of Sparta|Lycurgus]]. The festivals of the Revolution were staged by [[Jacques-Louis David|David]] as antique rituals.  Even the chairs in which the committee of ''Salut Publique'' sat were made on antique models devised by David. ...In fact Neo-classicism became fashionable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Honour|1977|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Empire style "turned to the florid opulence of Imperial Rome. The abstemious severity of [[Doric order|Doric]] was replaced by [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] richness and splendour".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Honour|1977|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two French architects, [[Charles Percier]] and [[Pierre François Léonard Fontaine|Pierre Fontaine]], were together the creators of the French Empire style. The two had studied in [[Rome]] and in the 1790s became leading furniture designers in [[Paris]], where they received many commissions from Napoleon and other statesmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Fredlund |first=Jane |year=2008 |title=Stilguiden: möbler &amp; inredning 1700–2000 |edition=2nd |location=Stockholm |publisher=Prisma |page=108 |oclc=234047178 |isbn=9789151849874 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Architecture of the Empire style was based on elements of the [[Roman Empire]] and its many archaeological treasures, which had been rediscovered starting in the eighteenth century.  The preceding Louis XVI and [[Directoire (style)|Directoire]] styles employed straighter, simpler designs compared to the [[Rococo]] style of the eighteenth century.  Empire designs strongly influenced the contemporary American [[Federal style]] (such as design of the [[United States Capitol]] building), and both were forms of [[propaganda]] through architecture.  It was a style of the people, not ostentatious but sober and evenly balanced.  The style was considered to have "liberated" and "enlightened" architecture just as Napoleon "liberated" the peoples of Europe with his [[Napoleonic Code]].
[[File:Église de la Madeleine 3753x3156.jpg|left|thumb|[[Église de la Madeleine]] in [[Paris]], a Temple to the Glory of Napoleon's [[Grande Armée]]]]
The Empire period was popularized by the inventive designs of [[Percier and Fontaine]], Napoleon's architects for [[Château de Malmaison|Malmaison]].  The designs drew for inspiration on symbols and ornaments borrowed from the glorious ancient Greek and Roman empires.  Buildings typically had simple timber frames and box-like constructions, [[wood veneer|veneer]]ed in expensive [[mahogany]] imported from the [[colonies]]. Biedermeier furniture also used [[ebony]] details, originally due to financial constraints. [[Ormolu]] details (gilded bronze furniture mounts and embellishments) displayed a high level of craftsmanship.

[[File:View to Kazan Cathedral by Ivan Smelov.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kazan Cathedral, St. Petersburg|Kazan Cathedral]] in [[Saint Petersburg]].]]

General Bernadotte, later to become King [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Karl Johan]] of Sweden and Norway, introduced the Napoleonic style to Sweden, where it became known under his own name. The Karl Johan style remained popular in Scandinavia even as the Empire style disappeared from other parts of Europe. France paid some of its debts to Sweden in ormolu bronzes instead of money, leading to a vogue for crystal [[chandeliers]] with bronze from France and crystal from Sweden.

After Napoleon lost power, the Empire style continued to be in favour for many decades, with minor adaptations.  There was a revival of the style in the last half of the nineteenth century in France, again at the beginning of the twentieth century, and again in the 1980s.

The most famous Empire-style structures in France are the grand neoclassical [[Arc de Triomphe|Arc de Triomphe of Place de l'Étoile]], [[Place du Carrousel#The Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel|Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel]], [[Vendôme column]], and [[Église de la Madeleine|La Madeleine]], which were built in Paris to emulate the edifices of the Roman Empire.  The style also was used widely in [[Imperial Russia]], where it was used to celebrate the victory over Napoleon in such memorial structures as the [[General Staff Building (Saint Petersburg)|General Staff Building]], [[Kazan Cathedral, St. Petersburg|Kazan Cathedral]], [[Alexander Column]], and [[Narva Triumphal Gate]]. [[Stalinist architecture]] is sometimes referred to as Stalin's Empire style.

The style survived in Italy longer than in most of Europe, partly because of its Imperial Roman associations, partly because it was revived as a national style of architecture following the unification of Italy in 1870. [[Mario Praz]] wrote about this style as the Italian Empire.  In the United Kingdom, Germany, and the United States, the Empire style was adapted to local conditions and gradually acquired further expression as the [[Egyptian Revival]], [[Greek Revival]], [[Biedermeier|Biedermeier style]], [[Regency style]], and [[Federal style|late-Federal style]].

A '''family entertainment center''' (or '''centre'''), often abbreviated '''FEC''' in the entertainment industry&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.stonecreekllc.com/family-entertainment-centers.html |title=About Family Entertainment Centers |author=-&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by line.--&gt; |publisher=StoneCreek Partners Advisory Services, Commercial Real Estate and Leisure-time Industries |location=Las Vegas, Nevada |work=StoneCreekLLC.com |year=2011 |accessdate=May 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as an '''indoor amusement park''' or '''indoor theme park'''), is a small [[amusement park]] marketed towards families with small children to teenagers, and often entirely indoors or associated with a larger operation such as a [[theme park]]. They usually cater to "sub-regional markets of larger metropolitan areas."&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt; FECs are generally small compared to full-scale amusement parks, with fewer attractions, a lower per-person per-hour cost to consumers than a traditional amusement park, and not usually major tourist attractions, but sustained by an area customer base. Many are locally owned and operated, although there are a number of chains and franchises in the field.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;  FECs are sometimes called '''family amusement centers''', '''play zones''', '''family fun centers''', or simply '''fun centers'''. Some non-traditional FECs, called '''urban entertainment centers''' ('''UEC'''s), with more customized and branded attractions and retail outlets, are associated with major entertainment companies and may be tourist destinations.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 2"&gt;{{cite web |url=  |title=Urban Entertainment Centers |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |work=StoneCreekLLC.com |publisher=''op. cit'' |year=2011 |accessdate=May 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others, sometimes operated by [[Non-Profit]] organizations as [[Children's Museums]] or [[science museum|Science Centers]], tend to be geared toward [[edutainment]] experiences rather than simply amusement.  FECs may also be adjuncts to full-scale amusement parks.

==History==
FECs are essentially a converged outgrowth of [[theme restaurant]]s that increasingly developed their in-house amusement features, small-scale amusement parks needing more offerings than just a few rides and [[midway (fair)|midway]] games, and diversifying formerly one-attraction venues ([[water park]]s, [[skate park]]s, [[billiard hall]]s, [[bowling alley]]s, and so on).  All three categories have moved over several decades continually toward stock, popular entertainment solutions supplied by third-party vendors.  Among the earliest of the themed restaurants to become known more for family entertainment than food was [[Chuck E. Cheese's]], a pizza restaurant founded in 1977 in [[San Jose, California]].&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;

==Attractions==
[[Image:Baby in ball pit.jpg|thumb|right|Ball pits are a popular attraction at family fun centers.]]Most FECs have at least five common major or "anchor" attractions, to provide diverse patrons (often in large parties) at least one to two hours of entertainment, to encourage repeat visits, and to reduce time spent waiting for any given attraction.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;  Some of the more usual attractions include (depending upon size, climate, etc.):
{{div col |colwidth=30em}}
*[[Amusement ride|Amusement/thrill rides]] (elevated, but generally small-scale)
*[[Arcade games]]
*[[Ball pit]]
*[[Batting cage]]s
*[[Bowling alley]]
*[[Bumper boats]]
*[[Restaurant]]
*Food: [[Snack bar]] and [[fast food]] (especially [[pizza]])
*Food: Quality family and group dining in [[theme restaurant]]
*[[Inflatable castle|Inflatables]]
*[[Kiddie ride]]s (ground-level)
*[[Kart racing]]
*[[Laser tag]]
*[[Miniature golf]]
*[[Movie theater]]
*[[Music]] and [[dancing]]
*[[Playground]] equipment and climbing structures
*[[Redemption game]]s and [[merchandiser]] games
*[[Roller skating]]
*[[retail|Specialty shops]] (toys, comics, music, etc.)
*[[Virtual reality]]
*[[Water slide]]
{{div col end}}
[[Image:Playport Indoor Playarea.png|thumb|right|Multi-tiered climbing structures such as this one are common at family entertainment centers.]]
The most common anchor activities are miniature golf, kart racing, arcade and redemption games, and food &amp; beverage, according to industry specialists StoneCreek Partners.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;  FECs rarely use custom-built attractions, because of the costs involved, and instead install off-the-shelf systems provided and maintained by industry equipment vendors.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;

Any given FEC may lean more towards outdoor activities, arcade gaming, or passive entertainment and dining. Each may cater to different age ranges, all the time, or during certain hours, e.g. children and entire families in the daytime, and teens to young adults in the evening, with specific promotional programs to attract different market segments at different times.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;

==Business model==
FECs tend to serve "sub-regional markets",&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt; such as small cities, quadrants or boroughs of larger cities, and a large suburban area outside such a city.  Their busiest times are weekend afternoons and Thursday through Saturday evenings.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;

Because most of the attractions are essentially the same from FEC to FEC,&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt; two of the most important factors in a particular center distinguishing itself to potential customers are a highly visible location&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt; (hard to obtain because other uses for the land are often more competitive&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;), and a consistently developed and promoted theme that appeals to the target market segments, "the fun factor in the overall decor".&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;

Parental concerns are also important. While children themselves rarely think of it, a major factor in the attractiveness of an FEC to parents is on-site safety and security, as adults may drop off older children at such an establishment to entertain themselves.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;  An increasingly important factor for success is high-quality food and drink to attract parental spending as well as whole-family dining.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;

==Non-traditional FECs==
Various major media and entertainment brands, including [[Disney]], [[Lego]], [[NASCAR]], [[Sega]], [[Sony]], [[Regal Entertainment Group|United Artists/Regal]] and [[Viacom]], have been attached to family entertainment centers, often much less "traditional" than local and chain FECs, with custom-built, unique attractions, usually heavily branded, and most often located in major metropolitan areas.  The first such '''urban entertainment center''' (UEC) was the [[Universal CityWalk]] in [[Los Angeles, California]], which opened in 1993, linking several Universal properties.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 2" /&gt; Including various retail outlets, restaurants, and attractions, the CityWalk created a great deal of "sustained buzz" in the retail real estate industry, which began "embracing the notion that Universal Studios, Sony, Disney, and other entertainment companies could create new anchors and entertainment programs for shopping centers".&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 2" /&gt; Another significant UEC was the [[Sony Metreon]] in [[San Francisco, California]] (1999&amp;ndash;2006).

Some nonprofit, educational installations, such as the [[Exploratorium]] in San Francisco, also have aspects of FECs in format and atmosphere, but with activities geared toward learning and experiencing rather than simple entertainment. Some for-profit enterprises also use this model, or mix [[edutainment]] with simpler amusement attractions.

==Industry organizations==
The major international industry association that supports FECs is the [http://www.iaapa.org International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions] (IAAPA), which merged with and absorbed the membership of the International Association for the Leisure and Entertainment Industry (IALEI) in October 2009.&lt;ref name="IAPPA 1"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iaapa.org/pressroom/pressreleases/IALEIDissolutionIAAPAMergerPlansFinalRelease.asp |title=News Release: IALEI Dissolution IAAPA Merger Plans Final |first=David |last=Mandt |work=IAAPA.org |publisher=International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions |location=Alexandria, Virginia |date=October 9, 2009 |accessdate=May 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  IAAPA maintains addresses in the [[Virginia]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Brussels, Belgium]] and [[Mexico City]].&lt;ref name="IAAPA 2"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iaapa.org/aboutus/ContactUs.asp |title=Contact Us |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |work=IAPPA.org |publisher=''op. cit'' |year=2011 |accessdate=May 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Laser Tag Association (ILTA) also remains active (and more broadly than its name suggests).  ILTA is based in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], U.S.&lt;ref name="ILTA 1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lasertag.org/about-us.html |title=About Us |author= |work=LaserTag.org |year=2011 |publisher=International Laser Tag Association |location=Indianapolis, Indiana |accessdate=May 12, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603212344/http://lasertag.org/about-us.html |archivedate=June 3, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For many smaller, community centric FEC's and owner/operators who can't always make the IAAPA tradeshow, IAAO the International Association of Amusement Operators [https://web.archive.org/web/20111219122923/http://www.amusementoperators.org/] is an online resource for family entertainment center operators and startups.

==In Canada==
Canadian FECs are called "family entertainment centres" or "fun centres", due to [[British English|British]]-style spelling conventions in [[Canadian English]].
*[[Chuck E. Cheese's]] (U.S.-owned)
*[[Playdium]]

==In Mexico==
*[[KidZania]] (Mexico City, 1999)
*[[America's Incredible Pizza Company]] (Monterrey, U.S.-owned)

==In the United States==
The main national industry group in the U.S. is the [[National_Association_of_Family_Entertainment_Centers|National Association of Family Entertainment Centers (NAFEC)]], which is perhaps incongruously a division of the International Laser Tag Association (ILTA).

Some U.S.-based companies also have venues in Canada (noted above), but this is rare due to the legal/political difficulties involved in cross-border corporations.

American FECs vary wildly in themes, size and features. Some of the larger businesses in this category have included:&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;&lt;!--Sources some but not all of this list, especially many of the dates and places. IT MUST BE CITED WHERE IT *DOES* SOURCE THE MATERIAL, not just at the top of the list! --&gt;

&lt;!-- **************************************************************
     THIS LIST EXCLUDES: Adult-themed operations like Block Party,
     one- or two-attraction venues like movie theaters with video
     games, mostly-outdoor operations like water parks that don't
     have multiple indoor attractions (try [[Amusement parks]]
     instead), venues that are not serving markets of at least
     500,000 people (or we'd have a list of hundreds and hundreds
     of non-notable venues in every large town and small city),
     and defunct FECs of questionable notability.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4968">'''Fuzzy classification''' is the process of grouping elements into a [[fuzzy set]]&lt;ref&gt;Zadeh, L. A. (1965). Fuzzy sets. Information and Control (8), pp. 338–353.&lt;/ref&gt; whose [[membership function]] is defined by the truth value of a fuzzy propositional function.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmermann, H.-J. (2000). ''Practical Applications of Fuzzy Technologies''. Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meier, A., Schindler, G., &amp; Werro, N. (2008). Fuzzy classification on relational databases. In M. Galindo (Hrsg.), Handbook of research on fuzzy information processing in databases (Bd. II, S. 586-614). Information Science Reference.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Del Amo, A., Montero, J., &amp; Cutello, V. (1999). On the principles of fuzzy classification. Proc. 18th North American Fuzzy Information Processing Society Annual Conf, (S. 675 – 679).&lt;/ref&gt;

A fuzzy class ~C = { i | ~Π(i) } is defined as a fuzzy set ~C of individuals i satisfying a fuzzy classification predicate ~Π which is a fuzzy propositional function. The domain of the fuzzy class operator ~{ .| .}  is the set of variables V and the set of fuzzy propositional functions ~PF, and the range is the fuzzy [[powerset]] (the set of fuzzy subsets) of this universe, ~P(U):

~{ .| .}∶V × ~PF ⟶ ~P(U)

A fuzzy propositional function is, analogous to,&lt;ref name="Russel 1919"&gt;Russel, B. (1919). ''Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy''. London: George Allen &amp; Unwin, Ltd., S. 155&lt;/ref&gt; an expression containing one or more variables, such that, when values are assigned to these variables, the expression becomes a fuzzy proposition in the sense of.&lt;ref name="Zadeh 1975"&gt;Zadeh, L. A. (1975). Calculus of fuzzy restrictions. In L. A. Zadeh, K.-S. Fu, K. Tanaka, &amp; M. Shimura (Hrsg.), Fuzzy sets and Their Applications to Cognitive and Decision Processes. New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, fuzzy classification is the process of grouping individuals having the same characteristics into a ''fuzzy set''. A fuzzy classification corresponds to a membership function μ that indicates whether an individual is a member of a class, given its fuzzy classification predicate ~Π.

μ∶~PF × U ⟶ ~T

Here, ~T is the set of fuzzy truth values (the interval between zero and one). The fuzzy classification predicate ~Π corresponds to a fuzzy restriction "i is R" &lt;ref name="Zadeh 1975" /&gt; of U, where R is a fuzzy set defined by a truth function. The degree of membership of an individual i in the fuzzy class ~C is defined by the truth value of the corresponding fuzzy predicate.

μ~C(i):= τ(~Π(i))

==Classification==
Intuitively, a class is a set that is defined by a certain property, and all objects having that property are elements of that class. The process of classification evaluates for a given set of objects whether they fulfill the classification property, and consequentially are a member of the corresponding class. However, this intuitive concept has some logical subtleties that need clarification.

A [[class logic]]&lt;ref&gt;Glubrecht, J.-M., Oberschelp, A., &amp; Todt, G. (1983). Klassenlogik. Mannheim/Wien/Zürich: Wissenschaftsverlag.&lt;/ref&gt; is a logical system which supports set construction using logical predicates with the class operator { .| .}. A ''class''

C = { i | Π(i) }

is defined as a set C of individuals i satisfying a classification predicate Π which is a propositional function. The domain of the class operator { .| .}  is the set of variables V and the set of propositional functions PF, and the range is the powerset of this universe P(U) that is, the set of possible subsets:

{ .| .} ∶V×PF⟶P(U)

Here is an explanation of the logical elements that constitute this definition:
* An individual is a real object of reference.
* A universe of discourse is the set of all possible individuals considered.
* A variable V:⟶R is a function which maps into a predefined range R without any given function arguments: a zero-place function.
* A propositional function is “an expression containing one or more undetermined constituents, such that, when values are assigned to these constituents, the expression becomes a proposition”.&lt;ref name="Russel 1919" /&gt;

In contrast, ''classification'' is the process of grouping individuals having the same characteristics into a set. A classification corresponds to a membership function μ that indicates whether an individual is a member of a class, given its classification predicate Π.

μ∶PF × U ⟶ T

The membership function maps from the set of propositional functions PF and the universe of discourse U into the set of truth values T. The membership μ of individual i in Class C is defined by the truth value τ of the classification predicate Π.

μC(i):=τ(Π(i))

In classical logic the truth values are certain. Therefore a classification is crisp, since the truth values are either exactly true or exactly false.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6675">The '''Gwyneddigion Society''' ({{lang-cy|'''Cymdeithas y Gwyneddigion'''}}) was a [[London]]-based [[Wales|Welsh]] literary and cultural society. The original society was founded in 1770 and wound up in 1843. It was briefly revived in 1978. Its proceedings were conducted through the medium of [[Welsh language|Welsh]].

==History==
The Gwyneddigion Society was founded in December 1770 by a group of expatriate Welshmen resident in London, its first formal meeting taking place on 4 February 1771. Foremost of the founders was [[Owen Jones (antiquary)|Owen Jones]] (known as Owain Myfyr), who became the society's first President. Originally from [[Llanfihangel Glyn Myfyr]], Jones had moved to London as a young man and had earned his fortune as a furrier.&lt;ref&gt;Davies 2008, p. 429.&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable early members included [[Iolo Morganwg]] (Edward Williams), [[William Owen Pughe]], [[John Jones (Jac Glan-y-gors)|Jac Glan-y-gors]] (John Jones), [[John Edwards (1747–1792)|Siôn Ceiriog]] (John Edwards), [[Edward Jones (harpist)|Edward Jones]] ("Bardd y Brenin"), and [[Twm o'r Nant]] (Thomas Edwards). Although the society's name (meaning "Gwynedd scholars") suggests a particular link with the region of [[Gwynedd]], its affiliations were from the start with the whole of [[North Wales]], and later with all parts of Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Leathart 1831, pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Davies 346"&gt;Davies 2008, p. 346.&lt;/ref&gt; 

It seems likely that the society was formed in part in reaction to the perceived social and intellectual elitism of the existing London Welsh societies, notably the [[Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion]] (although there was in practice considerable overlap between the membership and the officials of the various societies). The emphasis in the early years was on sociability, music (including [[harp]]-playing and [[Cerdd Dant|penillion-singing]]), and pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;Jones 2001, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; The society's principal meeting-place was the Bull's Head Tavern in [[Walbrook]], and one member, [[David Samwell]], wrote:
:In Walbrook stands a famous Inn
:Near ancient Watling Street
:Well stored with brandy, beer and gin,
:Where Cambrians nightly meet.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Jenkins and Ramage 1951, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Under rules adopted in 1777, every member had to be Welsh-speaking, and had to avow a fondness for singing, or at least for hearing poetry sung to the harp.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins and Ramage 1951, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the society rapidly adopted a more broadly cultural, and specifically a literary, role. When the Cymmrodorion Society was dissolved in 1787, its Presidential Chair was passed to the Gwyneddigion Society.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins and Ramage 1951, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; One member described the Bull's Head between 1790 and 1815 as the "centre of Welsh literary life" ("''canolfan bywyd llenyddol ein gwlad''").&lt;ref&gt;Jones 2001, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

The society promoted annual [[eisteddfod]]au in Wales, the precursors of the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales|National Eisteddfod]] (the first being held at [[Bala, Gwynedd|Bala]] in 1789); but these experienced difficulties, and the experiment was abandoned after 1793.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins and Ramage 1951, pp. 123–7.&lt;/ref&gt; It had its own library, and maintained contact with scholars across Wales, such as [[William Jones (Welsh radical)|William Jones]], to aid them in their knowledge gathering. It also offered an annual prize for literature, in the form of a silver medal. Most significantly, the society (with the financial backing of Owen Jones) published important Welsh literary texts, including ''Barddoniaeth Dafydd ab Gwilym'' (1789) and ''[[The Myvyrian Archaiology of Wales]]'' (1801–07).&lt;ref name="Davies 346"/&gt;

A noteworthy event in the society's early history was its funding in the 1790s of [[John Evans (explorer)|John Evans]]' exploration of North America in search of the legendary "Welsh Indians", the supposed descendants of [[Madoc|Madog ab Owain Gwynedd]].&lt;ref name="Davies 346"/&gt;

From the beginning of the 19th century the society began a slow decline, and by the mid-1830s it had been effectively subsumed into the [[Cymreigyddion Society]] (founded in 1795). It was formally dissolved in 1843.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins and Ramage 1951, pp. 127–8.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Revival==
A new Gwyneddigion Society was formed in London in 1978, but it is not known to have survived.&lt;ref name="Davies 346"/&gt;

[[File:Pioneer Helmet.jpg|thumb|alt=Colour photograph of the Pioneer Helmet|The 100–200 fragments of the [[Pioneer Helmet|Pioneer helmet]] were adhered using HMG.]]
'''HMG Heat and Waterproof Adhesive''' (also known as '''HMG''' or '''HMG adhesive''') is a brand of [[Nitrocellulose|cellulose nitrate]] adhesive manufactured by H Marcel Guest Ltd. It is one of the most popular cellulose nitrate adhesives used in [[Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|conservation and restoration]] work, and is used on materials such as metal, wood, glass, and pottery.{{sfn|Shashoua|Bradley|Daniels|1992|p=114}}{{sfn|HMG product page}}{{sfn|MFA CAMEO|2016}} It is sometimes referred to as "the blue tube", in contrast to "the purple tube", the acrylic B72 Restoration Adhesive also manufactured by the company.{{sfn|HMG Adhesives|2011}}

HMG was invented during [[World War II]] by the company's founder, Herbert Falder.{{sfn|HMG Adhesives|2011}} Today it is broadly used, including by the [[British Museum]] and the [[York Archaeological Trust]]. In 1997, HMG was used to adhere pieces of the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] [[Pioneer Helmet|Pioneer helmet]], which was found broken into between 100 and 200 fragments.{{sfn|Meadows|2004|pp=24–27}}{{sfn|Read|2006|pp=39–42}} Particularly fragile areas had their cracks injected with a solution of HMG diluted 50% with [[acetone]], to consolidate them and prevent them from collapsing; holes made while cleaning away corrosion were likewise injected with pigmented HMG.{{sfn|Meadows|2004|pp=25–26}}{{sfn|Read|2006|p=40}} Stronger areas, such as the [[Dexter and sinister|sinister]] cheek guard, found in eighteen pieces, and the [[nasal helmet|nasal]], were joined directly with the adhesive.{{sfn|Meadows|2004|pp=24–25}} Finally, HMG was also used to adhere glass fibre matting on the inside of the helmet, strengthening weak joins and covering gaps, the latter to provide backing against which gapfill could be applied.{{sfn|Meadows|2004|pp=27}}{{sfn|Read|2006|p=42}}

==Technical properties==
HMG is advertised with a {{convert|-18|C|F|abbr=on}} [[flash point]], and a {{convert|100|C|F|abbr=on}} temperature resistance.{{sfn|HMG product page}} It is insoluble in water and soluble in acetone, and is composed of 70% amyl acetate solvent, 25% cellulose nitrate, approximately 5% of the plasticizer dibutyl phthalate,{{sfn|Shashoua|Bradley|Daniels|1992|p=115}} and a small amount of a phenolic resin leveling agent.{{sfn|MFA CAMEO|2016}} The adhesive is touch dry in five minutes, and hard dry in ten.{{sfn|HMG Adhesives|2011}}

The '''Habitats Directive''' (more formally known as '''Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the Conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora''') is a [[European Union directive]] adopted in 1992 as an EU response to the [[Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats|Berne Convention]]. It is one of the EU's two directives in relation to wildlife and nature conservation, the other being the [[Birds Directive]].&lt;ref name="EUwebsite"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature |title=EUROPA – Environnement – Nature and Biodiversity – Homepage |publisher=European Commission |accessdate=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JNCC-EUlaw&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jncc.gov.uk/page-1372 |title=Joint Nature Conservation Committee – European Legislation |publisher=Government of the United Kingdom |accessdate=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of European nature's policies that establishes one organised network—[[Natura 2000]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Natura 2000]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=January 2018}} which intends to protect nature and wildlife. The Habitats Directive requires national governments to specify areas that are expected to be ensuring the conservation of flora and fauna species.

The '''Habitats Directive''' assures the conservation of endangered native animal and plant divisions. It aims to protect 220 habitats and approximately 1,000 species listed in the directive's Annexes. These are species and habitats which are considered to be of European interest, following criteria given in the directive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/mission_statement/index_en.htm EUROPA – Environnement – Nature and Biodiversity – Mission Statement] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019093120/http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/mission_statement/index_en.htm |date=19 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JNCC-Habitat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jncc.gov.uk/page-1374 |title=Joint Nature Conservation Committee – EC Habitats Directive |publisher=Government of the United Kingdom |date=30 October 1994 |accessdate=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It directs Member States of the EU to take measures to maintain the "favourable conservation status" of protected habitats and species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Epstein|first=Yaffa|date=7 May 2016|title=Favourable Conservation Status for Species: Examining the Habitats Directive’s Key Concept through a Case Study of the Swedish Wolf|url=http://jel.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/05/06/jel.eqw006|journal=Journal of Environmental Law|pages=eqw006|doi=10.1093/jel/eqw006|issn=0952-8873}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Annex V species whose taking from the wild can be restricted by European law.
The directive led to the setting up of a network of Special Areas of Conservation, which together with the existing [[Special Protection Area]]s form a network of protected sites across the [[European Union]] called [[Natura 2000]].&lt;ref name="EUwebsite"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JNCC-EUlaw"/&gt; Article 17 of the directive requires EU Member States to report on the state of their protected areas every six years. The first complete set of country data was reported in 2007.

==History==

From 1988 to 1992, the policy was given importance at the national level by policy experts, scientists and ecologists and later on spawned political, social and administrative discussions within the states that are engaged in the policy in the 1990s.

In 1998, the protection of the habitat of the [[European hamster]]&lt;ref&gt;[[European hamster]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=January 2018}} —''Korenwolf'', received a lot of attention from the public and the media during discussions projected by the ''Non-governmental Organization'' responsible for the matter. The extinction of the species symbolised the failed conservation of wild flora and fauna and other species of plants and animals and the deficiency of the pursuit for nature policies in the Netherlands.

==Implications==
Due to differences in nature conservation traditions, national problems have arisen in the implementation of the directive. Since member states in the South and East of Europe participated less in nature policies, these states experienced misfits in promoting the new EU-originating provisions. In Germany, Austria, Italy and Belgium, the observation of conflicts between various government layers have caused prolonged delays in the management of nature policies. On the other hand, in member states such as United Kingdom and Sweden, positive outcomes have developed due to stakeholder involvement, pro-active authorities, agencies responsible for implementation and public participation.

Not only does the '''Habitats Directive''' promote nature and wildlife conservation but it also develops a disquisition between ''"economy" and "ecology"'' (Van der Zouwen and Van den Top 2002). Several discussions have been made regarding the directive and its flaws by the Dutch politics and administration— these discussions are still going on until today. The disadvantages of the policy have been believed to raise awareness on Europe's implementation of policies. Representatives of provinces and municipalities have been putting efforts in implementing nature policies within their area and scope. The '''Habitats Directive''' and [[Birds Directive]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Birds Directive]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=January 2018}}were considered as the first legitimate effort in pursuing [[Europeanization]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Europeanisation]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=January 2018}}

'''Health information on the Internet''' refers to all communication related to health done on the [[Internet]].

==Types==
As a general communication channel, various Internet products serve every type of general health information.

===Targeting types of information to different audiences===
In the late 1990s researchers began to note that huge numbers of people were using the Internet to seek health information, despite various problems with the quality of information or inefficiencies in accessing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Risk | first1 = A. | last2 = Petersen | first2 = C. | doi = 10.1001/jama.287.20.2713 | title = Health Information on the Internet | journal = JAMA | volume = 287 | issue = 20 | pages = 2713–2715 | year = 2002 | pmid =  12020308| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Various problems have been identified for those using [[search engines]] to seek health information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Berland | first1 = G.

There is a premise that patients with access to their personal health information presented in a form they can understand will be able to interpret and learn from this information in a way that benefits them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beaudin|first=JS|author2=Intille, SS |author3=Morris, ME |title=To track or not to track: user reactions to concepts in longitudinal health monitoring.|journal=Journal of medical Internet research|year=2006|volume=8|issue=4|pages=e29|pmid=17236264|pmc=1794006|doi=10.2196/jmir.8.4.e29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physicians worry that patients using their own medical history records as a starting point for personal research on the Internet are at risk for being overwhelmed and misinformed when seeking health information on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robeznieks|first=A|title=Getting personal.

As of 2013 opinions about the relationship health care providers should have with online health information were still being established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Farnan|first=Jeanne M.|title=Online Medical Professionalism: Patient and Public Relationships: Policy Statement From the American College of Physicians and the Federation of State Medical Boards|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|date=16 April 2013|volume=158|issue=8|pages=620–7|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-158-8-201304160-00100|pmid=23579867}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one 2014 study, "The flow of information has fundamentally changed, and physicians have less control over health information relayed to patients. Not surprisingly, this paradigm shift has elicited varied and sometimes conflicting views about the value of the Internet as a tool to improve health care."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tonsaker|first=Tabitha|last2=Bartlett|first2=Gillian|last3=Trpkov|first3=Cvetan|date=2016-11-14|title=Health information on the Internet|journal=Canadian Family Physician|volume=60|issue=5|pages=407–408|issn=0008-350X|pmc=4020634|pmid=24828994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Social media]] channels have been noted as places which physicians can visit to get insight on patient thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Verhoef|first=Lise M |author2=Van de Belt, Tom H |author3=Engelen, Lucien JLPG |author4=Schoonhoven, Lisette |author5=Kool, Rudolf B |title=Social Media and Rating Sites as Tools to Understanding Quality of Care: A Scoping Review|journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research|date=20 February 2014|volume=16|issue=2|pages=e56|doi=10.2196/jmir.3024|pmid=24566844 |pmc=3961699}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patients have increasingly turned to social media for health information, sometimes of dubious quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prybutok|first=Gayle|last2=Ryan|first2=Sherry|date=2015-04-01|title=Social media: the key to health information access for 18- to 30-year-old college students|journal=Computers, informatics, nursing: CIN|volume=33|issue=4|pages=132–141|doi=10.1097/CIN.0000000000000147|issn=1538-9774|pmid=25887107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lau|first=A.

====Background on the doctor–patient relationship====
{{main article|Doctor–patient relationship}}
Physicians have difficulty explaining complicated medical concepts to their patients and patients have difficulty understanding complicated things which physicians tell them. One reasons for this is that a patient's visit to a physician is likely to be less than 15 minutes, and in any case, physicians are unable to spend the amount of time which patients that patients typically desire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mechanic|first=David|author2=McAlpine, Donna D. |author3=Rosenthal, Marsha |title=Are Patients' Office Visits with Physicians Getting Shorter?|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=18 January 2001|volume=344|issue=3|pages=198–204|doi=10.1056/NEJM200101183440307|pmid=11172143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physicians use medical terms which patients do not understand, but which they would like to learn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Castro|first=CM|author2=Wilson, C |author3=Wang, F |author4= Schillinger, D |title=Babel babble: physicians' use of unclarified medical jargon with patients|journal=American journal of health behavior|date=Sep–Oct 2007|volume=31 Suppl 1|pages=S85–95|pmid=17931142 |doi=10.5993/ajhb.31.s1.11}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is consensus that patients should have [[shared decision making]], which means that they make informed decisions about the direction of their health care in collaboration with their physician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Braddock III|first=Clarence H.|author2=Edwards, Kelly A. |author3=Hasenberg, Nicole M. |author4=Laidley, Tracy L. |author5= Levinson, Wendy |title=Informed Decision Making in Outpatient Practice|journal=JAMA|date=22 December 1999|volume=282|issue=24|pages=2313–20|doi=10.1001/jama.282.24.2313|pmid=10612318}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rich, educated, socially advantaged patients enjoy many more benefits of shared decision making than patients who have disadvantages in getting healthcare, including lower socioeconomic class or having a minority status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fiscella|first=Kevin|author2=Epstein, Ronald M.|title=So Much to Do, So Little Time:care for the socially disadvantaged and the 15-minute visit |journal=Archives of Internal Medicine|date=22 September 2008|volume=168|issue=17|pages=1843–52|doi=10.1001/archinte.168.17.1843|pmid=18809810|pmc=2606692}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lack of patient understanding of health contributes to a range of problems including tendency to not adhere to the physician's medical advice and missing medical appointments.&lt;ref name="Wicks 2010"&gt;A better source should be used to support this claim, although this source is good enough for how it is used here.

====Resources====
Various social forums exist in which anyone can have conversations about health with their peers. Such forums are especially popular among patients who seek to have conversations with other patients with a shared medical concern.&lt;ref name="Eysenbach 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eysenbach|first=G.|title=Health related virtual communities and electronic support groups: systematic review of the effects of online peer to peer interactions|journal=BMJ|date=15 May 2004|volume=328|issue=7449|pages=1166–0|doi=10.1136/bmj.328.7449.1166|pmid=15142921|pmc=411092}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who participate in online communities which discuss health issues report feeling relief about their health worries, perceiving more control over their health and medical condition, having more medical knowledge, and having more personal agency overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barak|first=Azy|author2=Boniel-Nissim, Meyran |author3=Suler, John |title=Fostering empowerment in online support groups|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|date=September 2008|volume=24|issue=5|pages=1867–1883|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2008.02.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic medical literature===
The written record of medical consensus is stored in [[scientific journals]]. Since the advent of [[electronic publishing]] there has been [[academic journal publishing reform]] which had a range of effects, including more researchers and physicians having greater access to professional information in medical journals through the Internet.

===Patients' personal health information===
Through various sources both publicly and privately available, datasets containing health information about large numbers of patients are available on the Internet to an extent which was impossible to manage before the Internet.

==Quality==
Measures and standards for ensuring quality control on the Internet have been criticized and no one standard is universally accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jadad | first1 = A. R. | last2 = Gagliardi | first2 = A. | doi = 10.1001/jama.279.8.611 | title = Rating Health Information on the Internet | journal = JAMA | volume = 279 | issue = 8 | pages = 611–614 | year = 1998 | pmid =  9486757| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of what kind of measure is used, much health information on the Internet is of dubious quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The nature and quality of online health-related information seeking on the web is challenging and complex and many researchers investigated this issue benefiting from a wide range of theories from different disciplines.&lt;/ref&gt; Among all sources there is a wide variance in quality of health information on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;Khosrowjerdi, M.

==Personal health information==
For many applications people wish to use health information on the Internet to give insight about a personal health concern. Because of this, the goal is often to use the Internet to find information described in a person's [[medical record]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Since the advent of [[electronic media]], medical records have been increasingly kept as [[electronic medical records]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} If electronic medical records were shared online then it would be easy to match those with information and conduct a range of research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pagliari|first=C|author2=Detmer, D |author3=Singleton, P |title=Potential of electronic personal health records.|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|date=Aug 18, 2007|volume=335|issue=7615|pages=330–3|pmid=17703042|doi=10.1136/bmj.39279.482963.AD|pmc=1949437}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, all medical records are [[protected health information]] because sharing personal health information exposes an individual to a range of harms which result from violation of their [[expectation of privacy]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

There is currently broad international debate about how to balance patient and commercial medicine demands for personal health information with individual's needs for safety and respect.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===Electronic medical records===

===De-identification===
{{main article|De-identification}}
De-identification is an attempt to divide a collection of information about a particular person so that all information which identifies the person is removed, and with intent to distribute whatever information is left. The closer the data is to [[anonymization]] the less valuable the data is to those who want it, so in general, data is only de-identified somewhat and rarely anonymized. There are many controversies in de-identification.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===Research using personal health information===
There is a large demand for access to large collections of various types of personal health information.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Almost all of this demand is commercial.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===Distribution of collections of personal health information===
Various groups have expressed worry over danger to the public which results from the distribution of collections of personal health information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2013/jun/05/data-protection-eu-anonymous |title=Data protection in the EU: the certainty of uncertainty |first=Cory |last=Doctorow |authorlink=Cory Doctorow |work=theguardian.com |date=5 June 2013 |accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Higher Computing''', [[Scottish Qualifications Authority|SQA]] course code ''C206 12'', is a qualification taught in Scottish [[secondary schools]], usually in the fifth or sixth year of study (S5/S6). Candidates usually progress into Higher Computing with a pass at [[National 5]], previously [[Intermediate 2]] or [[Standard Grade]] (credit).

The course consists of three units: two mandatory units and one optional unit selected by the centre. The required units are [[Computer Systems]] ''(DF2X 12)'' and [[Software Development]] ''(DF2Y 12)'' and the optional units are [[Computer Networking]] ''(DF30 12)'', [[Artificial Intelligence]] ''(DF31 12)'' and [[multimedia|Multimedia Technology]] ''(DF32 12)''.&lt;ref&gt;''SQA: Arrangements for Computing (Higher)'', page 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessment==
Candidates are assessed on both practical and theory work. In October, the SQA issues a coursework task to centres which candidates will attempt between November and March. The task is split into two parts:
1.A programming task
and 2.An investigation related to hardware and software studied in the Computer Systems unit.

As with most SQA qualifications, candidates sit for a written exam in May/June. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sqa.org.uk/sqa/56924.html|website=SQA}}&lt;/ref&gt;This is split into two sections. Section I is worth 20 marks and contains short response questions, while section II involves more in-depth answers and is worth a total of 70 marks.

Therefore, candidates can receive up to 150 marks. The grade is then worked out as follows:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Grade
! Band
! Percentage
! Marks
|-
| rowspan=2 | A
| 1
| ≥75
| ≥113
|-

|-
| D
| 7
| 45-49
| 68-74
|-
| No Award
| 8
| &lt;45
| &lt;90
|}

Note: In some years the criteria for these grades may change to reflect the difficulty of the exam.

==Units==
All three optional units are assigned 50 marks in the final exam.

===Computer Systems===
The Computer Systems unit of the course focuses on how modern day computers work and can be broken down into the following sub-sections:&lt;ref&gt;''SQA: Arrangements for Computing (Higher)'', page 7-9&lt;/ref&gt;
*Data representation
*Computer structure
*Peripherals
*Networking
*Computer software
30 marks in the coursework task (50%) are for this unit, while the written exam has approximately 45 marks worth of questions on Computer Systems.

===Software Development===
Software Development is about the process of developing commercial software and includes a practical element where students create their own programs using a [[high level language]] of the site's choice. The sub-sections are:&lt;ref&gt;''SQA: Arrangements for Computing (Higher)'', page 10&lt;/ref&gt;
*Software development process
*Software development languages and environments
*High level programming language constructs
*Standard Algorithms
As with the Computer Systems unit, 30 marks in the coursework task (50%) are for this unit and the exam has around 45 marks worth of Software Development questions.

===Artificial Intelligence===
The first optional unit, Artificial Intelligence, teaches students about the history and technology behind [[AI]]. The four sub-sections are:&lt;ref&gt;''SQA: Arrangements for Computing (Higher)'', page 11-12&lt;/ref&gt;
*The development of artificial intelligence
*Applications and uses of artificial intelligence
*Search techniques

'''Intent''' is the desired outcome of a military operation. It is a key concept in 21st century [[military operations]] and is a vital element to facilitate [[Mission-type tactics|subordinates' initiative]]&lt;ref name="AGS1999"&gt;Alberts, D.S., Garstka, J.J. and Stein, F.P.

== Intent content ==
In the reviewed open military doctrine literature intent is a critical component for command and control. The many definitions that exist of intent are mostly similar but the actual intent content differs and is unclear. Intent content can mainly be found as concept descriptions in doctrinal handbooks relating to development or impact usage of intent.&lt;ref name="PMG" /&gt;

The following examples represent United Kingdom, Sweden, Canada, United States, and NATO doctrinal view of intent.
* [[British Army]] ''Doctrine'' defines it as "Intent is similar to purpose. A clear intent initiates a force’s purposeful activity. It represents what the commander wants to achieve and why; and binds the force together; it is the principal result of decision-making. It is normally expressed using effects, objectives and desired outcomes....The best intents are clear to subordinates with minimal amplifying detail."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Development, Concepts and Doctrine Centre (2010) Army Doctrine Publication – Operations Shrivenham, |location=UK |publisher=Ministry of Defence |url=http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/41903E11-B6F4-4351-853B-2C1C2839FE1B/0/ADPOperationsDec10.pdf |title=Operations|format=pdf |page=11 |chapter=6 Command of Operations }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Swedish Armed Forces – Integrated Dynamic Command and Control (IDC2) (Josefsson 2007)&lt;ref&gt;Josefsson, A. (2007) Ledningskoncept för integrerad dynamisk ledning (IDC2) C2 concept for integrated dynamic command and control. Stockholm: Swedish Armed Forces.&lt;/ref&gt; define intent to "Intent is a concise formulation of the overall goals and purpose. The focus is to describe operations, restrictions and resource allocation."
* Canadian Forces Joint Publication 5.0 (Chief of the Defence Staff 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;5E-2)&lt;ref&gt;Chief of the Defence Staff (2008) The Canadian Forces Operational Planning Process (OPP) Available at: http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2010/forces/D2-252-500-2008-eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; "Commander's Intent. This summary should provide the Commander's overall intent and establish the purpose of the plan. It is an important focusing statement for subordinate commanders. (1) Military Objectives. (2) Desired Military End-State. (3) Transition Conditions".
* US Field Manual 5.0 (U.S. Army 2010, para. 2-90)&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Army (2010) Field Manual 5.0 – The Operations Process U.S. Department of the Army. Available at: https://fas.org/irp/doddir/army/fm5-0.pdf [Accessed January 20, 2011].&lt;/ref&gt; constitute the US Army’s view on planning, preparing, executing, and assessing operations. "The commander’s intent is a clear, concise statement of what the force must do and the conditions the force must establish with respect to the enemy, terrain, and civil considerations that represent the desired end state ([[List of United States Army Field Manuals#FM 3-0|FM&amp;nbsp;3–0]]). The commander's intent succinctly describes what constitutes success for the operation. It includes the operation’s purpose and the conditions that define the end state. It links the mission, concept of operations, and tasks to subordinate units."
* NATO allied Joint publication 1 (AJP-01) (NATO 2010, para. 0538)&lt;ref&gt;NATO (2010) AJP-01 – Allied Joint Doctrine D. Brussels, Belgium: NATO. Available at: http://nsa.nato.int/nsa/zPublic/ap/AJP-01(D).pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; provide the keystone doctrine for the planning, execution and support of Allied joint operations. "The intent defines the end-state in relation to the factors of mission; adversary, operating environment, terrain, forces, time and preparation for future operations. As such, it addresses what results are expected from the operation, how these results might enable transition to future operations, and how, in broad terms, the Commander expects the force to achieve those results. Its focus is on the force as a whole. Additional information on how the force will achieve the desired results is provided only to clarify the Commander's intentions."
* US Joint Publication 3.0 (US Joint Chiefs of Staff 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;IV-25)&lt;ref&gt;US Joint Chiefs of Staff (2010) Joint Publication 3-0 – Joint Operations. March 2010. Available at: https://fas.org/irp/doddir/dod/jp3_0.pdf [Accessed January 20, 2011].&lt;/ref&gt; provides the doctrinal foundation and fundamental principles that guide the Armed Forces of the United States in the conduct of joint operations across the range of military operations. "Commander's intent is a clear and concise expression of the purpose of the operation and the military end state." and continues with "It also includes where the commander will accept risk during the operation. The initial intent statement normally contains the purpose and military end state as the initial inputs for the planning process."

In military doctrinal handbooks the identified intent artefacts generally express the initial state and situation, the desired end state and outcome, and how to get to the desired end state. Artefacts describing the initial situation are: own and other forces, adversaries, operating environment, terrain, time, preparation for future operations. Artefacts describing the outcome are: purpose, goals, mission, effects and end state. Artefacts describing how to reach the outcome are: concept of operations, tasks to subordinate units, risk willing, how results might enable transition to future operations, objectives, transition conditions, restrictions in conducting operations, allocation of resources, and expectations of force usage.

Another way to identify intent artefacts is from how people actually communicate intent. Klein (1998, pp.&amp;nbsp;225–29)&lt;ref name="K1998"&gt;Klein (1998, pp. 225–29)&lt;/ref&gt; present the results of information types that is identified in intent communication. The seven information types of intent are according to Klein (1998, p.&amp;nbsp;226):&lt;ref name="K1998" /&gt; (1) Purpose of task which describes why the task is performed, (2) objective of task, presents a picture of the desired outcome, (3) sequence of steps in the plan. Klein identifies this to be a source of problem since too detailed descriptions may limit the subordinates initiative, (4) rationale for plan includes all the information that where present when making the decision, (5) key decisions that may have to be made, i.e. if there is a choice to be made the commander can provide the intent in how he wants it to be conducted, (6) antigoals, describe unwanted outcomes, and (7) constraints and other considerations describes weather and rule of engagement etc.

=== Intent content definition ===
The doctrinal artefacts are mapped into the structure provided by Klein and the resulting seven facets are grouped in: (a) '''Initial Situation''' describing initial situation and state and consists of Kleins rationale for the plan, (b) '''Outcome''' is describing outcomes and consists of Kleins Purpose of task, objective of task, and antigoals, and (c) '''Execution''' that is describing how to reach the outcome and consists of Kleins sequence of steps, key decisions and constraints and other considerations.

Intent is then defined to consist of the following eight facets.
* '''Mission/Goal''' – The purpose of the task (the higher-level goals). It provides the rationale why the missions and task are to be executed. It is a high-level definition of the overall intent and is regularly stated in one sentence following on the form of Who, What, When, Where and Why. A Mission/Goal can be described by using the Actions, Effects or a compound State, i.e. situation. Mission/Goal belongs to the intent group outcome.
* '''End-State''' – The objective of the task in form of a representation of the desired outcome. The desired outcome is described as a state, e.g. completion of a task, the effects from tasks, or even the execution of tasks over time. The purpose is to provide a picture of the End-State. According to Klein (1998, p.&amp;nbsp;226) in his investigation, the end-state objective was only missing once in the thirty five examined Commander's intent statements. Effect is in this work defined as the physical and/or behavioural state of a system that results from an action, a set of actions, or another effect. The End State is a more detail description of the Mission/Goal statement and can be described in several sentences. An End State can be described by using the Actions, Effects or a compound State, i.e. situation. End State belongs to the intent group outcome.
* '''Sequence''' – The sequence of steps in the plan – This is the plan that describes what do in general terms such as Courses of Actions and Course of Effects. Sequence belongs to the intent group execution describing how to reach the desired outcome and include concept of operations, tasks to subordinate units, how results might enable the transition to future operations, allocation of resources, and expectations of force usage.
* '''Initial State''' – The situation that builds the rationale for the plan, what information was available, who was making the decisions, under what time pressure and similar circumstances. Initial State encompass own and other forces, adversaries, operating environment, terrain, time, preparation for future operations. Initial State belongs to the intent group initial situation.
* '''Key Decisions''' – The key decisions that may have to be made and guide the commander in how to make choices. Key Decisions belongs to the intent group execution and describes how to reach the desired outcome and encompass how results might enable the transition to future operations, transition conditions and expectations of force usage.
* '''Antigoals''' – Antigoals describe undesired outcomes. Antigoals are meaningful when to clarify alternatives action plans and what the resulting outcome might be. Antigoals are described in the same way as End State with the difference in that antigoals describe the unwanted outcome. In the surveyed doctrinal descriptions of intent, antigoals were not mentioned. Antigoals belong to the intent outcome.
* '''Constraints''' – Constraints and other considerations that should be taken into account and can vary from policy to weather and terrain. Constraints belongs to the intent group execution and encompass risk willing, restrictions in conducting operations, allocation of resources, and expectations of force usage.
* An eight facet '''Expressives''' is proposed in Gustavsson et al. (2008d;&lt;ref name="PMG2008d" /&gt; 2011&lt;ref name="PMG2011" /&gt;) to capture the style of organizations and commanders: experience, risk taking, use of power and force, diplomacy; ethics; norms; morale; creativity; and unorthodox behaviour. The use of ''Expressives'' can range from situations where participants (e.g. commanders) express their style to other participants (e.g. subordinates), or by Staff that develop models over the participants (commanders and subordinates) to be used in Course of Action development and war gaming. In both cases ''Expressives'' are a support to better understand the collaboration participants’ capabilities and conduct of operations.

== Intent in command and control ==
=== Commander's intent ===
'''Commander’s intent''' is an intent describing military focused operations and it is a publicly stated description of the end-state as it relates to forces (entities, people) and terrain, the purpose of the operation, and key tasks to accomplish. It is developed by a small group, e.g. staff, and a commander.

Commander's intent (CSI) plays a central role in military decision making and planning. CSI acts as a basis for staffs and subordinates to develop their own plans and orders to transform thought into action, while maintaining the overall intention of their commander.
The commander’s intent links the mission and concept of operations. It describes the end state and key tasks that, along with the mission, are the basis for subordinates’ initiative. Commanders may also use the commander’s intent to explain a broader purpose beyond that of the mission statement. The mission and the commander’s intent must be understood two echelons down. (U.S Army 2003, para. 4-27)&lt;ref name="FM6"/&gt;
Pigeau and McCann (2006)&lt;ref name="P2006"&gt;Pigeau, R. and McCann, C. (2006) Establishing Common Intent: The Key to Co-Ordinated Military Action. In: The Operational Art : Canadian Perspectives : Leadership and Command, 2006, Kingston, Ontario, Canada: Canadian Defence Academy Press, pp. 85–108.&lt;/ref&gt; state that intent is more than an aim or a purpose; they state that Intent contains the aim and purpose together with all implications. Hence, CSI is not only to describe the End-State but also a concise expression of the purpose of the operation. CSI may also include the commander's assessment of the adversary commander's intent and an assessment of where and how much risk is acceptable during the operation. This view is supported by Klein (1998, p.&amp;nbsp;225)&lt;ref&gt;Klein, G. (1998) Sources of Power - How People Make Decisions Cambridge, MA: The Mit Press. {{ISBN|0-262-11227-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
CSI originates from one commander’s mind and is disseminated to the echelons below. CSI rarely gets reviewed and updated. For a short duration mission, such as a deliberate attack, the original statement may remain valid throughout planning. But for longer phases, in order to be agile the CSI might be changing in phase with the unfolding of the situation. Commanders must develop their intent within the bounds of a whole hierarchy of guiding principles that limit the types of solutions that they can entertain (Pigeau &amp; McCann 2006).&lt;ref name="P2006"/&gt;

=== Common intent ===
'''Common intent''' is an intent that is shared and understood by all participants, i.e. there is no discrepancy between the intent of the participating humans. Common intent is an idealized view of intent.

In today’s operational environment teams need to work together towards a desired End-State. Pigeau and McCann (2000)&lt;ref name="P2000"&gt;Pigeau, R. and McCann, C. (2000) "Redefining Command and Control". In: R. Pigeau and C. McCann, (eds.) ''The Human in Command: Exploring the Modern Military Experience'', 2000, New York, NY, USA: Academic/Plenum Publishers, pp. 165–84. {{ISBN|978-0-306-46366-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; define Command and Control: “Command and Control: The establishment of common intent to achieve coordinated action”. Common intent is the combination of explicit intent and implicit intent. Pigeau and McCann (2006)&lt;ref name="P2006"/&gt; put forward that for a realizable Common Intent there need to be a single shared objective, together with a clear understanding in how that objective can be attained. They continue that Common Intent is an idealized concept where maximum overlap, with minimum scattering, exists between the intent of the commander and the intents of his subordinates. Knowledge known by the commander and his subordinates needs to be shared at all levels, guiding principles, reasoning ability, and to express similar levels of commitment. Intent is then not only something for a commander to disseminate but to exchange and learning the team members’ intent.
Farrell and Lichacz (2004)&lt;ref name="F2004"&gt;Farrell, P.S.E. and Lichacz, F. (2004) "Measuring Common Intent during Effects Based Planning". In: ''2004 Command and Control Research and Technology Symposium The Power of Information Age Concepts and Technologies''.&lt;/ref&gt; state that common intent describes a socio-psychological phenomenon that seems to be evident amongst a team that achieves a common objective. The CSI is a sort of a one person’s view, but as said in the introduction “every individual have intent of her own” implies that it may not just be enough to disseminate intent amongst staff members and subordinates. A conclusion of the work of Farrell (2006)&lt;ref name="F2006"&gt;Farrell, P.S.E. (2006) "Common Intent and Information Processing Frameworks applied to Effect Based Approaches to Operations". In: 2006, Cambridge, UK: CCRP.&lt;/ref&gt; is that teams with different military and civilian cultures would need that all team members establish a common understanding of the mission objectives and the Commander's intent with respect to their own competencies, authorities, and responsibilities.
Pigeau and McCann (2006, pp.&amp;nbsp;85–108)&lt;ref name="P2006"/&gt; state that diverse team members need to have a high degree of common intent to perform effectively. In such teams the commander needs to ensure that the intent is perceived and understood by all team members (Pigeau &amp; McCann 2000;&lt;ref name="P2000"/&gt; Farrell &amp; Lichacz 2004;&lt;ref name="F2004"/&gt; Pigeau &amp; McCann 2006;&lt;ref name="P2006"/&gt; Farrell 2006&lt;ref name="F2006"/&gt;).
Alberts and Hayes (2007)&lt;ref name="A2007"/&gt; say that in order to allow subordinates’ initiative the operations order focuses on describing the CSI/CI so that flexibility in coordination and collaboration in the dynamic environment is entailed. There is a need for the commander to connect the subordinates’ human potential (reason, opinions, questions, seek information regarding the mission) to align and be a support to the commanders own intent (Pigeau &amp; McCann 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;102).&lt;ref name="P2006"/&gt;

=== Command intent ===
'''Command intent''' (CI) is a practical view of common intent, meaning that it is not plausible to expect that all individuals during a whole mission in all situations will share the same intent. CI will be developed for specific parts of missions and shared amongst the participants. To establish CI the involvement of all participants is necessary, e.g. compare with football or soccer teams where the overall intent is formalized by coaches in collaboration with the players and where each player knows what the other players’ intentions are.

Pigeau and McCann (2000)&lt;ref name="P2000"/&gt; states that “In reality, it is presumed true that it is impossible to have common intent”. For a specific mission bounded for a certain time an overlap of intent ought to be achievable, e.g. as illustrated by the players in a soccer team where all have individual goals with their lives and families, but on the soccer field they have the common intent to win the game. This means that during the game, and in training and exercises prior to and after the game their common intent is to perform well according to the mission declared by the coach (Farrell &amp; Lichacz 2004;&lt;ref name="F2004"/&gt; Farrell 2006;&lt;ref name="F2006"/&gt; Gustavsson et al. 2008d).&lt;ref name="PMG2008d"&gt;Gustavsson, P.M., Hieb, M.R., Niklasson, L., Eriksson, P. and Moore, P. (2008d) "Machine Interpretable Representation of Commander's Intent". In: ''Proceedings of the 13th International Command and Control Research and Technology Symposium (ICCRTS)''. Bellevue, Washington, USA. Available at: http://www.dodccrp.org/events/13th_iccrts_2008/CD/html/papers/188.pdf. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;
A workable version of common intent is command intent that is directed for a specific situation, bounded by participating organization, space and time, i.e. for the operation at hand the intent is common but other intent and goals of the participating humans may differ. Much of the coordination can be done locally, i.e. on a lower level, without explicit orders. Brehmer (2009)&lt;ref name="B2009"&gt;Brehmer, B. (2009) "Command without Commanders". In: June 2009, Washington D.C.: CCRP.&lt;/ref&gt; proposes that the higher levels of command will have the time to consider other aspects of the problems facing them. Brehmer continues that there is the loss of combat power inherent in top-down command-directed synchronization. By NATO Network Enabled Capabilities (NNEC) as presented by Alberts, Garstka &amp; Stein (1999, pp.&amp;nbsp;87–93)&lt;ref name="AGS1999"/&gt; this is overcome by a high-speed continuum. Brehmer (2009)&lt;ref name="B2009"/&gt; however says that the main responsibility of the commander and his staff is to articulate intent and crafting rules of engagement. For armed forces that have mission command as their principal doctrine this is not a new concept, but Brehmer further envisions that with articulated intent larger units will be able to co-ordinate with other units and conduct the mission without any explicit directions from higher headquarters. Command Intent is then an outline of a plan, objectives to be achieved, responsibilities, linkages and schemas of manoeuvre, and constraints. Establishing command intent also involves more than one person. Traditional Commander's intent is then replaced by an intent that arises from dialogue between commanders and key staff at more than one level.
Command intent is to allow self-synchronization and to provide understanding of the complex causes and effects. To enable self-synchronization the subordinates must be given the mandate to operate on their own initiatives, within the boundary of the mission. In “Rethinking Command and Control” by Curts and Cambell (2006),&lt;ref&gt;Curts, R.J. and Cambell, D.E. (2006) "Rethinking Command and Control". In: March 2006, San Diego, CA: CCRP. Available at: http://www.dodccrp.org/events/2006_CCRTS/html/papers/005.pdf [Accessed March 16, 2009].&lt;/ref&gt; the authors address this fine line between delegating authority and maintaining and controlling hierarchy The commander delegating authority must refrain from directing the actions of subordinates, yet must also maintain some command structure. The subordinates must have the ability to work independently or within a team to achieve the mission goals. To create this empowerment the commander’s information should be shared with everyone. Autonomy is created by [[setting boundaries]] and hierarchy then can be replaced by self-directed teams. CI acts as a basis for staffs and subordinates to develop their own plans and orders that transform thought into action, while maintaining the overall intention of their commanders (Gustavsson et al. 2008d;&lt;ref name="PMG2008d"/&gt; 2009&lt;ref&gt;Gustavsson, P.M. and Hieb, M.R. (2009) "Supporting Collaboration in Collective Endeavours with a Model of Operations Intent and Effects". In: ''Proceedings of the 14th International Command and Control Research and Technology Symposium'', June 2009, Washington D.C.: CCRP. Available at: http://www.dodccrp.org/events/14th_iccrts_2009/papers/055.pdf. 055.&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== Explicit and implicit intent ===
'''Explicit intent''' is an intent that is publicly stated and made available for the participants. '''Implicit intent''' is an intent that is not publicly stated. Implicit intent can be made explicit by the mechanism described below.

Shattuck and Woods (2000)&lt;ref name="S2000"&gt;Shattuck, L.G. and Woods, D.D. (2000) "Communication Of Intent In Military Command and Control Systems". In: C. McCann and R. Pigeau, (eds.) ''The Human in Command: Exploring the Modern Military Experience'', Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, pp. 279–92. Available at: http://csel.eng.ohio-state.edu/woods/C2/shattuck_Nato.pdf [Accessed July 14, 2008].&lt;/ref&gt; examined the role of communicating intent. In the study, company commanders received a battalion order including the battalion Commander's intent. Then changes to the situation were introduced and the actions performed by the company commanders were compared with the intent of the battalion commander. The result was that the company commanders matched their battalion commander's intent in only 34% of the cases.
Pigeau and McCann (2000)&lt;ref name="P2000"/&gt; introduced that intent consists of an explicit part and an implicit part.

'''Explicit intent''' is the one that is publicly stated for all the headquarters (HQ) staff and subordinates to perceive, think about, and act upon. The explicit intent is either vocalized (i.e. made publicly) in doctrine, orders, statements or can be derived from questions and answers. Theoretically, each staff and subordinate member should be able to reiterate the commander’s intent at any point during the process.

'''Implicit intent''' consists of all the un-vocalized expectations that the commander and all team members have. The implicit intent is developed over a longer time, prior to the mission, and develops from the style of how the commander is conducting the operations with respect to experience, risk willing, use of power and force, diplomacy, ethics, social values, moral, norms, creativity and unorthodox behaviour and the concepts, policies, laws and doctrine agreed to by military, civil, organizations, agencies, nations and coalitions.
Farell and Lichacz (2004)&lt;ref name="F2004"/&gt; proposed that implicit intent is an internal expectation of Commander's intent. The example used by Farell &amp; Lichacz (2004)&lt;ref name="F2004"/&gt; is that with an explicit intent “to capture the hill” the implicit intent might be “to capture the hill with minimal battle damage” or “to capture the hill with Air Force assets only.” The implicit expectations depend on how the members interpret Commander's intent from personal expectations based on their style and experience, (Pigeau &amp; McCann 2000),&lt;ref name="P2000"/&gt; and with the staff position (e.g., planner, operator, commander, etc.), (cf. Farrell &amp; Lichacz 2004).&lt;ref name="F2004"/&gt; Farell and Lichacz (2004)&lt;ref name="F2004"/&gt; provided a way of finding implicit intent by asking questions of the form “from perspective x, how do you interpret Commander’s intent?”
Implicit intent can be made explicit by transforming the implicit into explicit statements. The commander can vocalize the Personal, Military or Cultural implicit intent. The commander can be monitored, e.g. by his subordinates, and his team members, who then draw conclusions about the commanders implicit intent. In the same way a commander can draw conclusions regarding his subordinates. Pigeau and McCann (2000)&lt;ref name="P2000"/&gt; presented some mechanisms of making original implicit intent made explicit. They are: (1) Externalization is when a commander or subordinate make the internal intents explicit declared; (2) Internalization is a version of tacit learning, when a commander presents the intent and the mouth is saying something and the body language signals something different, or add context and meaning that are put into the mental model and affects the implicit intent; (3) Socialization is meeting and talking and performing exercises together, teaming, i.e. is to find the implicit intent and motives etc.; and (4) Dialogue is the explicit stated, publicly vocalized available description of an individual’s intent.

'''Islamic ethics''' (أخلاق إسلامية), defined as "good character," historically took shape gradually from the 7th century and was finally established by the 11th century.&lt;ref name="EoI_Akhlaq" /&gt; It was eventually shaped as a successful amalgamation of the [[Qur'an]]ic teachings, the teachings of the Prophet [[Muhammad]], the [[precedent]]s of [[Ulema|Islamic jurists]] (see [[Sharia]] and [[Fiqh]]), the [[Jahiliyyah|pre-Islamic]] [[Arab]]ian tradition, and non-Arabic elements (including [[Persia]]n and [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] ideas) embedded in or integrated with a generally [[Islam]]ic structure.&lt;ref name="EoI_Akhlaq" /&gt; Although Muhammad's preaching produced a "radical change in [[moral value]]s based on the sanctions of the new religion and the present religion, and fear of God and of the Last Judgment", the tribal practice of Arabs did not completely die out. Later [[Muslim scholars]] expanded the religious ethic of the Qur'an and [[Hadith]] in immense detail.&lt;ref name="EoI_Akhlaq"&gt;{{harvnb|Bearman|Bianquis|Bosworth|van Donzel|2009|loc=Akhlaq}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Foundational motives==
The foundational source in the gradual codification of Islamic ethics was the Muslim understanding and interpretations of the Qur'an and practices of Muhammad. Its meaning has always been in context of active submission to God (Arabic: [[Allah]]), performed by the community in unison. The motive force in Islamic ethics is the notion that every human being is called to "command the good and forbid the [[evil]]" in all spheres of life. Muslims understand the role of Muhammad as attempting to facilitate this submission. Another key factor in the field of Islamic ethics is the belief that mankind has been [[fitrah|granted the faculty to discern]] God's will and to abide by it. This faculty most crucially involves reflecting over the meaning of existence. Therefore, regardless of their environment, humans are believed to have a [[moral responsibility]] to submit to God's will and to follow Islam (as demonstrated in the Qur'an, {{Quran-usc-range|7|172|173}}).&lt;ref name="EncEthic"&gt;{{harvnb|Becker|Becker|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This natural inclination is, according to the Qur'an, subverted by mankind's focus on material success: such focus first presents itself as a need for basic survival or security, but then tends to manifest into a desire to become distinguished amongst one's peers. Ultimately, the focus on [[materialism]], according to the Islamic texts, hampers with the innate reflection as described above, resulting in a state of ''[[jahiliyya]]'' or "heedlessness."&lt;ref name="EncEthic"/&gt;
Muslims believe that Muhammad, like other [[prophets in Islam]], was sent by God to remind human beings of their moral responsibility, and challenge those ideas in society which opposed submission to God. According to Kelsay, this challenge was directed against five main characteristics of pre-Islamic Arabia:&lt;ref name="EncEthic"/&gt;

# The division of Arabs into varying tribes (based upon blood and kinship). This categorization was confronted by the ideal of a unified community based upon [[taqwa|Islamic piety]], an "''[[ummah]]'';"
# The acceptance of the worship of a multitude of deities besides Allah - a view challenged by strict [[Tawhid|Islamic monotheism]], which dictates that Allah has no partner in worship nor any equal;
# The trait of ''muruwwa'' ([[Masculine|manliness]]), which Islam discouraged, instead emphasizing on the traits of humility and piety;
# The focus on achieving fame or establishing a legacy, which was replaced by the concept that mankind would be called to account before God on the [[Qiyamah|day of resurrection]];
# The reverence of and compliance with ancestral traditions, a practice challenged by Islam — which instead assigned primacy to submitting to God and following revelation.

These changes lay in the reorientation of society as regards to identity and life of the Muslim belief, [[world view]], and the hierarchy of values. From the viewpoint of subsequent generations, this caused a great transformation in the society and moral order of life in the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. For Muhammad, although [[pre-Islamic Arabia]] exemplified "heedlessness," it was not entirely without merit. Muhammad approved and exhorted certain aspects of the Arab pre-Islamic tradition, such as the care for one’s near kin, for widows, orphans, and others in need and for the establishment of [[justice]]. However, these values would be re-ordered in importance and placed in the context of strict [[monotheism]].&lt;ref name="EncEthic"/&gt;

==Moral commandments==

In the 17th chapter, "Al-Israa" ("The Night Journey"), verses {{Quran-usc-range|17|22|39}}, the [[Qur'an]] provides a set of moral stipulations which are "among the (precepts of) wisdom, which thy Lord has revealed to thee" that can be reasonably categorised as ten in number. According to S. A. Nigosian, Professor of religious studies at [[University of Toronto|the University of Toronto]], these resemble the Ten Commandments in the Bible and "represents the fullest statement of the code of behavior every Muslim must follow".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nigosian|2004|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these verses are not regarded by Islamic scholars as set apart from any other moral stipulations in the Qur'an, nor are they regarded as a substitute, replacement, or abrogation of some other set of commandments as found in the previous revelations.  
# '''Worship only God:''' Do not make with Allah another god; lest you will sit disgraced and forsaken. ({{cite quran|17|22|style=ref}})
# '''Be kind, honourable and humble to one's parents:''' And your Lord has decreed that you not worship except Him alone, and to be good to the parents. Whether one or both of them reach old age [while] with you, say not to them [so much as], a word of disrespect, and do not repel them but speak to them a noble word. ({{cite quran|17|23|style=ref}}) And lower to them the wing of humility out of mercy and say, "My Lord, have mercy upon them as they brought me up [when I was] small." ({{cite quran|17|24|style=ref}})
# '''Be neither miserly nor wasteful in one's expenditure:''' And give the relative his right, and [also] the poor and the traveler, and do not spend wastefully. ({{cite quran|17|26|style=ref}}) Indeed, the spendthrifts are brothers of the devil, and the devil is, to his lord, ungrateful. ({{cite quran|17|27|style=ref}}) And if you [must] turn away from the needy awaiting mercy from your Lord which you expect, then speak to them a gentle word. ({{cite quran|17|28|style=ref}}) And do not make your hand [as] chained to your neck or extend it to its utmost reach, so that you [thereby] become blamed and insolvent. ({{cite quran|17|29|style=ref}})
# '''Do not engage in 'mercy killings' for fear of starvation:''' And do not kill your children for fear of poverty. We provide for them and for you. Indeed, their killing is ever a great sin. ({{cite quran|17|31|style=ref}})
# '''Do not commit adultery:''' And do not approach unlawful sexual intercourse. Indeed, it is an immorality and an evil way. ({{cite quran|17|32|style=ref}})
# '''Do not kill unjustly:''' And do not kill the soul which Allah has forbidden, except by right. And whoever is killed unjustly - We have given his heir authority, but let him not exceed limits in [the matter of] taking life. Indeed, he has been supported [by the law]. ({{cite quran|17|33|style=ref}})
# '''Care for orphaned children:''' And do not approach the property of an orphan, except in the way that is best, until he reaches maturity...({{cite quran|17|34|style=ref}})
# '''Keep one's promises:''' ...fulfill (every) engagement [i.e. promise/covenant], for (every) engagement will be questioned (on the Day of Reckoning). ({{cite quran|17|34|style=ref}})
# '''Be honest and fair in one's interactions:''' And give full measure when you measure, and weigh with an even balance. That is the best [way] and best in result. ({{cite quran|17|35|style=ref}})
# '''Do not be arrogant in one's claims or beliefs:''' And do not pursue that of which you have no knowledge. Indeed, the hearing, the sight and the heart - all those will be questioned. ({{cite quran|17|36|style=ref}}) And do not walk upon the earth exultantly. Indeed, you will never tear the earth [apart], and you will never reach the mountains in height. ({{cite quran|17|37|style=ref}})

Many Muslim theologians see the [[Golden rule#Islam|'''Golden Rule''']] implicit in some verses of the Qur'an and in the [[Hadith]]. The Golden Rule was agreed 1993 also by Muslims as a central unconditional ethical norm in the [[Declaration Toward a Global Ethic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|PWR|1993|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early reforms under Islam==
{{main|Early reforms under Islam}}

Many reforms in human rights took place under [[Islam]] between 610 and 661, including the period of [[Muhammad]]'s  mission and the rule of the [[Rashidun|four immediate successors]] who established the [[Rashidun Empire|Rashidun Caliphate]]. Historians generally agree that Muhammad preached against what he saw as the social evils of his day,&lt;ref&gt;Alexander (1998), p.452&lt;/ref&gt; and that Islamic social reforms in areas such as [[social security]], family structure, [[slavery]], and the rights of women and [[Ethnic minority|ethnic minorities]] improved on what was present in existing [[Arab]] society at the time.&lt;ref name="EoI_Akhlaq"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LewisNYRB"&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watt (1974), p.234&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson (2004) p.21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haddad, Esposito (1998), p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gallagher|2007|p=293}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, according to [[Bernard Lewis]], Islam "from the first denounced [[Aristocracy|aristocratic]] privilege, rejected [[hierarchy]], and adopted a formula of the career open to the talents."&lt;ref name="LewisNYRB"/&gt; [[John Esposito]] sees Muhammad as a reformer who condemned practices of the pagan Arabs such as [[female infanticide]], [[exploitation of labour|exploitation]] of the poor, [[usury]], murder, false contracts, and theft.&lt;ref name="Espos"&gt;Esposito (2005) p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; Bernard Lewis believes that the egalitarian nature of Islam "represented a very considerable advance on the practice of both the [[Greco-Roman]] and the [[Persian Empire|ancient Persian]] world."&lt;ref name="LewisNYRB"/&gt;

The [[Constitution of Medina]], also known as the ''Charter of Medina'', was drafted by Muhammad in 622. It constituted a formal agreement between Muhammad and all of the significant tribes and families of Yathrib (later known as [[Medina]]), including [[Muslim]]s, [[Jew]]s, and [[pagan]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Firestone (1999) p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bearman|Bianquis|Bosworth|van Donzel|2009|loc=Muhammad}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Watt|1956}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Serjeant|1964|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The document was drawn up with the explicit concern of bringing to an end the bitter intertribal fighting between the clans of the Aws ([[Banu Aus|Aus]]) and [[Khazraj]] within Medina.  To this effect it instituted a number of rights and responsibilities for the Muslim, Jewish and pagan communities of Medina bringing them within the fold of one community-the [[Ummah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Serjeant|1978|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Constitution established the security of the community, [[freedom of religion]], the role of Medina as a [[haram]] or sacred place (barring all violence and weapons), the [[Women's rights|security of women]], stable tribal relations within Medina, a tax system for supporting the community in time of conflict, parameters for exogenous political alliances, a system for granting protection of individuals, a judicial system for resolving disputes, and also regulated the paying of [[Blood money (term)|blood-wite]] (the payment between families or tribes for the slaying of an individual in lieu of [[Eye for an eye|lex talionis]]).

Muhammad made it the responsibility of the Islamic government to provide food and clothing, on a reasonable basis, to [[Prisoners of war|captives]], regardless of their religion. If the prisoners were in the custody of a person, then the responsibility was on the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Maududi (1967), Introduction of Ad-Dahr, "Period of revelation", pg. 159&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis states that Islam brought two major changes to ancient slavery which were to have far-reaching consequences. "One of these was the presumption of freedom; the other, the ban on the enslavement of free persons except in strictly defined circumstances," Lewis continues. The position of the Arabian slave was "enormously improved": the Arabian slave "was now no longer merely a chattel but was also a human being with a certain religious and hence a [[social status]] and with certain quasi-legal rights."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Esposito states that reforms in [[women's rights]] affected marriage, divorce, and [[inheritance]].&lt;ref name="Espos" /&gt; Women were not accorded with such legal status in other cultures, including the West, until centuries later.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Lindsay. p.6224&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Oxford Dictionary of Islam'' states that the general improvement of the status of Arab women included prohibition of female infanticide and recognizing women's full personhood.&lt;ref name="OxfordDicT"&gt;Esposito (2004), p. 339&lt;/ref&gt; "The [[dowry]], previously regarded as a bride-price paid to the father, became a nuptial gift retained by the wife as part of her personal property."&lt;ref name="Espos"/&gt;&lt;ref name="majid"&gt;Khadduri (1978)&lt;/ref&gt; Under Islamic law, marriage was no longer viewed as a "status" but rather as a "contract", in which the woman's consent was imperative.&lt;ref name="Espos"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OxfordDicT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="majid"/&gt; "Women were given inheritance rights in a [[patriarchal society]] that had previously restricted inheritance to male relatives."&lt;ref name="Espos"/&gt; [[Annemarie Schimmel]] states that "compared to the pre-Islamic position of women, Islamic legislation meant an enormous progress; the woman has the right, at least according to the letter of the law, to administer the wealth she has brought into the family or has earned by her own work."&lt;ref name = "Schimmel"&gt;Schimmel (1992) p.65&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Montgomery Watt]] states that Muhammad, in the historical context of his time, can be seen as a figure who testified on behalf of women's rights and improved things considerably. Watt explains: "At the time Islam began, the conditions of women were terrible - they had no [[Property|right to own property]], were supposed to be the property of the man, and if the man died everything went to his sons." Muhammad, however, by "instituting rights of property ownership, inheritance, education and divorce, gave women certain basic safeguards."&lt;ref&gt;Maan, McIntosh (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Haddad and Esposito state that "Muhammad granted women rights and privileges in the sphere of [[Family|family life]], marriage, education, and economic endeavors, rights that help improve women's status in society."&lt;ref&gt;Haddad, Esposito (1998) p.163&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[Robert Bellah]] (''Beyond belief'') argues that Islam in its seventh-century origins was, for its time and place, "remarkably modern...in the high degree of commitment, involvement, and participation expected from the rank-and-file members of the community."  This because, he argues, that Islam emphasized on the equality of all Muslims, where leadership positions were open to all. Dale Eickelman writes that Bellah suggests "the early Islamic community placed a particular value on individuals, as opposed to collective or group responsibility."&lt;ref&gt;McAuliffe (2005) vol. 5, pp. 66-76. "Social Sciences and the Qur’an"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmentalism==
{{see also|Muslim Agricultural Revolution}}

Perhaps due to resource scarcity in most Islamic nations, there was an emphasis on limited (and some claim also sustainable) use of [[natural capital]], i.e. producing land. Traditions of [[haram (site)]] and [[hima (environmental protection)|hima]], an Arabic term meaning "protected place", and early [[urban planning]] were expressions of strong social obligations to stay within [[carrying capacity]] and to preserve the [[natural environment]] as an obligation of [[Caliph|khalifa]] or "stewardship".&lt;ref name="Haq"&gt;{{harvnb|Haq|2001|pp=111–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Muslims established themselves in [[Madinah]], Muhammad surveyed the
natural resources in the region—the wadis (riverbeds); the rich, black volcanic soil; the high rangelands—and decreed that they be preserved and set aside as a hima.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Verde|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hadith]]s on agriculture and [[environmental philosophy]] were compiled in the "Book of Agriculture" of the ''[[Sahih Bukhari]]'', which included the following saying:&lt;ref name="Haq" /&gt;

{{quote|text=There is none amongst the believers who plants a tree, or sows a seed, and then a bird, or a person, or an animal eats thereof, but it is regarded as having given a charitable gift [for which there is great recompense].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Sahih Bukhari]]'' 3:513&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Several such statements concerning the environment are also found in the Qur'an, such as the following:&lt;ref name="Haq" /&gt;

{{quote|text=And there is no animal in the earth nor bird that flies with its two wings, but that they are communities like yourselves.{{cite quran|6|38}}}}

The earliest known treatises dealing with environmentalism and [[environmental science]], especially pollution, were [[Islamic medicine|Arabic medical treatises]] written by [[al-Kindi]], [[Qusta ibn Luqa]], [[al-Razi]], [[Ibn Al-Jazzar]], [[al-Tamimi]], [[al-Masihi]], [[Avicenna]], [[Ali ibn Ridwan]], [[Ibn Jumay]], [[Isaac Israeli ben Solomon]], [[Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi (medieval writer)|Abd-el-latif]], Ibn al-Quff, and [[Ibn al-Nafis]]. Their works covered a number of subjects related to pollution such as air pollution, [[water pollution]], [[soil contamination]], [[municipal solid waste]] mishandling, and [[environmental impact assessment]]s of certain localities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gari|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Córdoba, Spain|Cordoba]], [[Al-Andalus]] also had the first [[waste container]]s and [[waste disposal]] facilities for [[litter]] collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Scott|1904}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Artz|1980|pp=148–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;([[cf.]] [http://www.1001inventions.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=main.viewSection&amp;intSectionID=441 References] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229042135/http://www.1001inventions.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=main.viewSection&amp;intSectionID=441 |date=2008-02-29 }}, 1001 Inventions)&lt;/ref&gt;

"In order to preserve the natural environment by not polluting, plant trees, support environmentally-friendly goods and products, Muslims must rectify themselves through simplicity, contentment, resisting endless desires, and then remembering God as well as following His commands".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=The Holy Quran and the Environment |url=http://www.rissc.jo/index.php/english-publications.html |year=2010 |chapter=The Relationship between The Environment and Man. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130818180319/http://www.rissc.jo/index.php/english-publications.html |archivedate=2013-08-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
Many medieval Muslim thinkers pursued [[humanistic]] and [[Rationalism|rational]] approaches in discourses regarding [[values]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goodman|2003|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Democratic participation===
{{main|Islamic democracy}}
{{further|Shura|Ijma}}

In the early Islamic [[Caliphate]], the head of state, the Caliph, had a position based on the notion of a successor to Muhammad's political authority, who, according to Sunnis, were ideally elected by the people or their representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martin|2004|pp=116–123}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Rashidun]] Caliphs, later Caliphates during the [[Islamic Golden Age]] had a lesser degree of democratic participation, but since "no one was superior to anyone else except on the basis of piety and virtue" in Islam, and following the example of Muhammad, later Islamic rulers often held [[public consultation]]s with the people in their affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weeramantry|1997|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Electing or appointing a Caliph

[[Fred Donner]], in his book ''The Early Islamic Conquests'' (1981), argues that the standard Arabian practice during the early Caliphates was for the prominent men of a kinship group, or tribe, to gather after a leader's death and elect a leader from amongst themselves, although there was no specified procedure for this [[shura]], or consultative assembly. Candidates  were usually from the same lineage as the deceased leader, but they were not necessarily his sons. Capable men who would lead well were preferred over an ineffectual direct heir, as there was no basis in the majority Sunni view that the head of state or governor should be chosen based on lineage alone. Al-Mawardi has written that the caliph should be [[Quraysh (tribe)|Qurayshi]]. [[Al-Baqillani|Abu Bakr Al-Baqillani]] has said that the leader of the Muslims simply should be from the majority. [[Abu Hanifa an-Nu‘man]] also wrote that the leader must come from the majority.&lt;ref name=2muslims&gt;{{harvnb|Al-Ghamdy|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Majlis ash-Shura

Traditional Sunni Islamic lawyers agree that ''[[shura]]'', loosely translated as 'consultation of the people', is a function of the caliphate. The [[Majlis-ash-Shura|Majlis ash-Shura]] advise the caliph. The importance of this is premised by the following verses of the Qur'an:{{or|date=October 2010}}

{{quote|text={{cite quran|42|38|expand=no|quote=...those who answer the call of their Lord and establish the prayer, and who conduct their affairs by Shura. [are loved by God]}}}}
{{quote|text={{cite quran|3|159|expand=no|quote=...consult them (the people) in their affairs. Then when you have taken a decision (from them), put your trust in Allah}}}}

The [[majlis]] is also the means to elect a new caliph. Al-Mawardi has written that members of the majlis should satisfy three conditions: they must be just, they must have enough knowledge to distinguish a good caliph from a bad one, and must have sufficient wisdom and judgment to select the best caliph. Al-Mawardi also said in emergencies when there is no caliphate and no majlis, the people themselves should create a majlis, select a list of candidates for caliph, then the majlis should select from the list of candidates.&lt;ref name=2muslims/&gt; Some modern interpretations of the role of the Majlis ash-Shura include those by Islamist author [[Sayyid Qutb]] and by [[Taqiuddin al-Nabhani]], the founder of a transnational political movement devoted to the revival of the Caliphate. In an analysis of the shura chapter of the Qur'an, Qutb argued Islam requires only that the ruler consult with at least some of the ruled (usually the elite), within the general context of God-made laws that the ruler must execute.  Taqiuddin al-Nabhani, writes that Shura is important and part of "the ruling structure" of the Islamic caliphate, "but not one of its pillars," and may be neglected without the Caliphate's rule becoming unIslamic.  Non-Muslims may serve in the majlis, though they may not vote or serve as an official.

===Religious pluralism===
Islamic legal framework included [[religious pluralism]]. Classical [[Sharia]], the [[religious law]]s and courts of  [[Christianity|Christian]]s, [[Jews]] and [[Hinduism|Hindus]], were usually accommodated within the Islamic legal framework, as seen in the early Caliphate, [[Al-Andalus]], [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent|Indian subcontinent]], and the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman Millet]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weeramantry|1997|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sachedina|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Non-Muslims were allowed to engage in religious practices that was usually forbidden by Islamic law. In a notable example, [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] practice of [[incest]]uous "self-marriage" where a man could marry his mother, sister or daughter, was to be tolerated according to [[Ibn Qayyim]] (1292–1350). He based his opinion on the precedent that the prophet Muhammad, who did not forbid such self-marriages among Zoroastrians despite coming in contact with them and having knowledge of their practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jackson|2005|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious minorities were also free to do whatever they wished in their own homes, provided they did not publicly engage in illicit sexual activity in ways that could threaten public morals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jackson|2005|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freedom of expression===
Citizens of the Rashidun Caliphate were also free to criticize the [[Rashidun]] Caliphs, as the [[rule of law]] was binding on the [[head of state]] just as much as it was for the citizens. In a notable incident, when [[Umar]] tried to investigate a disturbance, by entering a home without permission, he was criticized for his behavior; he was also later criticized for the judgement he gave in that case.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bontekoe|Stepaniants|1997|pp=250–1}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also numerous other situations where citizens insulted Caliph Umar, but he tolerated the insults and simply provided them explanations. Similar situations also occurred during the time of Caliph [[Ali]]. For example, there was an occasion when he was giving a [[Khutbah|sermon]] and a [[Kharijites|Kharijite]] rudely interrupted him with insulting language. Though he was urged to punish the interrupter, Ali declined on the grounds that his "right to freedom of speech must not be imperilled."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bontekoe|Stepaniants|1997|p=251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Imad-ad-Dean Ahmad]] quotes a letter by a cousin of Caliph [[al-Ma'mun]], in which he gives permission to a Christian he was attempting to convert to speak his mind freely, as evidence that in Islam even religious controversies were not exempt from open discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ahmad|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to George Makdisi and Hugh Goddard, "the idea of [[academic freedom]]" in universities was "modelled on Islamic custom" as practiced in the medieval [[Madrasah]] system from the 9th century. Islamic influence was "certainly discernible in the foundation of the first deliberately planned university" in Europe, the [[University of Naples Federico II]] founded by [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]] in 1224.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goddard|2000|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter written by the fourth Rashidun Caliph and first cousin of the prophet Muhammad, [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] to his governor of Egypt, [[Malik al-Ashtar]]. The Caliph advises his governor on dealings with the poor masses thus:
{{quote|text=Out of your hours of work, fix a time for the complainants and for those who want to approach you with their grievances. During this time you should do no other work but hear them and pay attention to their complaints and grievances. For this purpose you must arrange public audience for them during this audience, for the sake of Allah, treat them with kindness, courtesy and respect. Do not let your army and police be in the audience hall at such times so that those who have grievances against your regime may speak to you freely, unreservedly and without fear. [http://www.al-islam.org/nahjul/letters/letter53.htm Nahjul Balaagha letter 53]}}

===Human rights===
{{see also|Sharia|Early reforms under Islam|Caliphate|Islamic Jurisprudence: An International Perspective|Women in Islam|Islamic feminism}}

In the field of human rights, early [[Ulema|Islamic jurists]] introduced a number of advanced legal concepts which anticipated similar modern concepts in the field. These included the notions of the [[charitable trust]] and the [[Trust law|trusteeship]] of property; the notion of brotherhood and [[social solidarity]]; the notions of human [[dignity]] and the [[dignity of labour]]; the notion of an ideal law; the condemnation of [[anti-social behavior]]; the [[presumption of innocence]]; the notion of "bidding unto good" (assistance to those in distress); and the notions of [[sharing]], [[Duty of care|caring]], [[universalism]], fair [[industrial relations]], fair contract, commercial [[integrity]], freedom from [[usury]], [[women's rights]], [[privacy]], [[abuse]] of rights, [[juristic person]]ality, [[individual freedom]], [[equality before the law]], [[Legal aid|legal representation]], non-[[Ex post facto law|retroactivity]], supremacy of the law, [[judicial independence]], judicial [[impartiality]], limited [[sovereignty]], [[Toleration|tolerance]], and democratic participation. Many of these concepts were adopted in [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]] through contacts with [[Islamic Spain]] and the [[Emirate of Sicily]], and through the [[Crusades]] and the [[Latin translations of the 12th century]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weeramantry|1997|pp=129–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|reason=1. Pages 129-131 are opinions of the Sri Lankan Jurist Weeramantry; it is interesting primary source/claim, but disputed by vast majority of scholars. We need secondary or tertiary sources, or at least a few additional sources to this sweep of claims. 2. In the field of human rights, there is a lot of debate on its historical foundations, see Jack Donnelly;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donnelly|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; 3. For neutral point of view, this credit claim to Islam must be balanced by a summary of dispute.|date=July 2013}}

The concept of [[inalienable rights]] was found in early Islamic law and jurisprudence, which denied a ruler "the right to take away from his subjects certain rights which inhere in his or her person as a human being." Islamic rulers could not take away certain rights from their subjects on the basis that "they become rights by [[reason]] of the fact that they are given to a subject by a law and from a source which no ruler can question or alter."&lt;ref name="Weeramantry132,135"&gt;{{harvnb|Weeramantry|1997|pp=132, 135}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that [[John Locke]]'s formulation of inalienable rights and conditional rulership, which were present in Islamic law centuries earlier, may have also been influenced by Islamic law, through his attendance of lectures given by [[Edward Pococke]], a professor of [[Islamic studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weeramantry|1997|pp=8, 135, 139–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Islamic law recognized two sets of human rights. In addition to the category of [[civil and political rights]] (covered in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]), Islamic law also recognized an additional category: [[social rights|social]], economic and [[cultural rights]]. This latter category was not recognized in the [[Western law|Western legal]] tradition until the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weeramantry|1997|pp=7, 135}}&lt;/ref&gt; The right of [[privacy]], which was not recognized in Western legal traditions until modern times, was recognized in Islamic law since the beginning of Islam.&lt;ref name="Weeramantry136-7"&gt;{{harvnb|Weeramantry|1997|pp=136–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of women's rights, women generally had more legal rights under Islamic law than they did under Western legal systems until the 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Badawi|1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, "French married women, unlike their Muslim sisters, suffered from restrictions on their legal capacity which were removed only in 1965."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Badr|Mayer|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noah Feldman, a [[Harvard University]] law professor, notes:

{{quote|text=As for sexism, the common law long denied married women any property rights or indeed legal personality apart from their husbands. When the British applied their law to Muslims in place of Shariah, as they did in some colonies, the result was to strip married women of the property that Islamic law had always granted them — hardly progress toward equality of the sexes.&lt;ref name=Feldman/&gt;}}

In the ''[[North Carolina Law Review]]'' journal, Professor John Makdisi of the [[University of North Carolina School of Law]] writes in "The Islamic Origins of the Common Law" article:

{{quote|text=[T]he manner in which an act was qualified as morally good or bad in the spiritual domain of Islamic religion was quite different from the manner in which that same act was qualified as legally valid or invalid in the temporal domain of Islamic law. Islamic law was secular, not canonical... Thus, it was a system focused on ensuring that an individual received justice, not that one be a good person.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Makdisi|1999|p=1704}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Count Leon Ostorog, a French jurist, wrote the following on classical Islamic law in 1927:

{{quote|text=Those Eastern thinkers of the ninth century laid down, on the basis of their theology, the principle of the Rights of Man, in those very terms, comprehending the rights of individual liberty, and of inviolability of person and property; described the supreme power in Islam, or Califate, as based on a contract, implying conditions of capacity and performance, and subject to cancellation if the conditions under the contract were not fulfilled; elaborated a Law of War of which the humane, chivalrous prescriptions would have put to the blush certain belligerents in World War I; expounded a doctrine of toleration of non-Moslem creeds so liberal that our West had to wait a thousand years before seeing equivalent principles adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weeramantry|1997|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some scholars have suggested that the idea of "a charter defining the duties of a sovereign toward his subjects, as well as subjects toward the sovereign", which led to the "genesis of European legal structures" and the development of the ''[[Magna Carta]]'', may have been "brought back by Crusaders who were influenced by what they had learned in the [[Levant]] about the governing system" established by [[Saladin]]. It has also been suggested that "much of the West’s understanding of liberalism in law, economics and society has roots in medieval Islam."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sullivan|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another influence of Islamic law on European law was the [[presumption of innocence]], which was introduced to Europe by King [[Louis IX of France]] soon after he returned from [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] during the [[Crusades]]. Prior to this, European legal procedure consisted of either [[trial by combat]] or [[trial by ordeal]]. In contrast, Islamic law was based on the presumption of innocence from its beginning, as declared by the Caliph [[Umar]] in the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boisard|1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other freedoms and rights recognized in the Islamic legal system based on the Qur'an since the 7th century, but not recognized in the Western world until much later, include "the rights to know, to choose belief and behaviour, to read and write, the right to power, and even the right to choose government."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Splichal|2002|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Rule of law

Islamic jurists anticipated the concept of the [[rule of law]], the equal subjection of all classes to the ordinary law of the land, where no person is above the law and where officials and private citizens are under a [[duty]] to obey the same law. A [[Qadi]] (Islamic judge) was also not allowed to discriminate on the grounds of religion, [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[Human skin color|colour]], [[kinship]] or [[prejudice]]. There were also a number of cases where [[Caliph]]s had to appear before judges as they prepared to take their verdict.&lt;ref name="Weeramantry132,135" /&gt; The following [[hadith]] established the principle of rule of law in relation to [[nepotism]] and accountability:&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 56, Number 681&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=Narrated ‘Aisha: The people of Quraish worried about the lady from Bani Makhzum who had committed theft. They asked, "Who will intercede for her with Allah's Apostle?" Some said, "No one dare to do so except Usama bin Zaid the beloved one to Allah's Apostle." When Usama spoke about that to Allah's Apostle Allah's Apostle said: "Do you try to intercede for somebody in a case connected with Allah’s Prescribed Punishments?" Then he got up and delivered a sermon saying, "What destroyed the nations preceding you, was that if a noble amongst them stole, they would forgive him, and if a poor person amongst them stole, they would inflict Allah's Legal punishment on him. By Allah, if Fatima, the daughter of Muhammad (my daughter) stole, I would cut off her hand."}}

Various Islamic lawyers do however place multiple conditions, and stipulations e.g. the poor cannot be penalised for stealing out of poverty, before executing such a law, making it very difficult to reach such a stage. It is well known during a time of drought in the [[Rashidun Empire|Rashidun caliphate]] period, capital punishments were suspended until the effects of the drought passed.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

According to Noah Feldman, a law professor at [[Harvard University]], the legal scholars and jurists who once upheld the rule of law were replaced by a law governed by the state due to the [[Codification (law)|codification]] of Sharia by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the early 19th century:&lt;ref name=Feldman&gt;{{harvnb|Feldman|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=How the scholars lost their exalted status as keepers of the law is a complex story, but it can be summed up in the adage that partial reforms are sometimes worse than none at all. In the early 19th century, the Ottoman empire responded to military setbacks with an internal reform movement. The most important reform was the attempt to codify Shariah. This Westernizing process, foreign to the Islamic legal tradition, sought to transform Shariah from a body of doctrines and principles to be discovered by the human efforts of the scholars into a set of rules that could be looked up in a book.}}

{{quote|text=Once the law existed in codified form, however, the law itself was able to replace the scholars as the source of authority. Codification took from the scholars their all-important claim to have the final say over the content of the law and transferred that power to the state.}}

;Accountability of rulers

Sunni Islamic lawyers have commented on when it is permissible to disobey, [[Impeachment|impeach]] or remove rulers in the Caliphate. This is usually when the rulers are not meeting public responsibilities obliged upon them under Islam. Al-Mawardi said that if the rulers meet their Islamic responsibilities to the public, the people must obey their laws, but if they become either unjust or severely ineffective then the Caliph or ruler must be impeached via the [[Majlis-ash-Shura|Majlis ash-Shura]]. Similarly Al-Baghdadi believed that if the rulers do not uphold [[justice]], the ummah via the majlis should give warning to them, and if unheeded then the Caliph can be impeached. [[Al-Juwayni]] argued that Islam is the goal of the ummah, so any ruler that deviates from this goal must be impeached. Al-Ghazali believed that [[oppression]] by a caliph is enough for impeachment. Rather than just relying on impeachment, [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani]] obliged [[rebellion]] upon the people if the caliph began to act with no regard for Islamic law. Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani said that to ignore such a situation is ''[[haraam]]'', and those who cannot revolt inside the caliphate should launch a struggle from outside. Al-Asqalani used two [[ayah]]s from the Qur'an to justify this:

{{quote|text={{cite quran|33|67|end=68|expand=no|quote=...And they (the sinners on qiyama) will say, 'Our Lord! We obeyed our leaders and our chiefs, and they misled us from the right path. Our Lord! Give them (the leaders) double the punishment you give us and curse them with a very great curse'...}}}}

Islamic lawyers commented that when the rulers refuse to step down via successful impeachment through the Majlis, becoming dictators through the support of a corrupt army, if the majority agree they have the option to launch a revolution against them. Many noted that this option is only exercised after factoring in the potential cost of life.&lt;ref name=2muslims/&gt;

;Right of revolution

According to scholar [[Bernard Lewis]], the [[Qur'an and Sunnah]] have several points to make on governance regarding the [[right of revolution]] in Islam:

{{quote|text=The Quran, for example, makes it clear that there is a duty of obedience: "Obey God, obey the Prophet, obey those who hold authority over you." And this is elaborated in a number of sayings attributed to Muhammad. But there are also sayings that put strict limits on the duty of obedience. Two dicta attributed to the Prophet and universally accepted as authentic are indicative. One says, "there is no obedience in sin"; in other words, if the ruler orders something contrary to the divine law, not only is there no duty of obedience, but there is a duty of disobedience. This is more than the right of revolution that appears in Western political thought. It is a duty of revolution, or at least of disobedience and opposition to authority. The other pronouncement, "do not obey a creature against his creator," again clearly limits the authority of the ruler, whatever form of ruler that may be.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Medical ethics==
{{main|Bimaristan}}

The ethical standards of Muslim physicians was first laid down in the 9th century by [[Ishaq ibn 'Ali al-Ruhawi]], who wrote the ''Adab al-Tabib'' (''Conduct of a Physician''), the first treatist dedicated to [[medical ethics]]. He regarded physicians as "guardians of souls and bodies", and wrote twenty chapters on various topics related to medical ethics, including:&lt;ref name=Ethics&gt;[http://www.muslimheritage.com/topics/default.cfm?ArticleID=570 Islamic Science, the Scholar and Ethics], Foundation for Science Technology and Civilisation.&lt;/ref&gt;
* What the physician must avoid and beware of
* The manners of [[visitor]]s
* The care of [[Cure|remedies]] by the physician
* The [[dignity]] of the medical [[profession]]
* The [[Test (assessment)|examination]] of physicians
* The removal of corruption among physicians

Because Islam views itself as a total system governing all areas, Islamic medical ethics view the patient as a whole. Classical texts speak more about "health", than "illness", showing an emphasis on prevention rather than cure.&lt;ref name=Paladin/&gt;

===Drugs===
The earliest known [[Prohibition (drugs)|prohibition]] of illegal drugs occurred under [[Sharia|Islamic law]], which prohibited the use of [[Hashish]], a preparation of [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], as a [[recreational drug]]. Classical [[Ulema|jurists]] in medieval [[Fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]], however, accepted the use of the Hashish drug for medicinal and therapeutic purposes, and agreed that its "medical use, even if it leads to mental derangement, remains exempt" from punishment. In the 14th century, the Islamic scholar [[Az-Zarkashi]] spoke of "the permissibility of its use for medical purposes if it is established that it is beneficial."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mathre|1997|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Mary Lynn Mathre, with "this legal distinction between the [[intoxicant]] and the medical uses of cannabis, medieval [[Kalam|Muslim theologians]] were far ahead of present-day [[American law]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mathre|1997|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical peer review===

The first documented description of a [[peer review]] process is found in the ''Ethics of the Physician'' by [[Ishaq ibn 'Ali al-Ruhawi]] (854–931) of al-Raha, [[Syria]], where the notes of a practising [[Islamic medicine|Islamic physician]] were reviewed by peers and the physician could face a lawsuit from a maltreated patient if the reviews were negative.&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Spier|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Al Kawi|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neuroethics===
{{main|Islamic psychology}}
Islamic [[neuroethics]] and [[neurotheology]] hold a sympathetic attitude towards the mentally ill, as exemplified in [[An-Nisa|Sura 4]]:5 of the Qur'an:&lt;ref name=Paladin&gt;{{harvnb|Paladin|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=Do not give your property which God assigned you to manage to the insane: but feed and cloth the insane with this property and tell splendid words to him.&lt;ref&gt;[[Qur'an]], [[An-Nisa|Sura 4]]:5&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This Quranic verse summarized Islam's attitudes towards the mentally ill, who were considered unfit to manage property but must be treated [[humane]]ly and be kept under care by a [[Legal guardian|guardian]], according to [[Sharia|Islamic law]].&lt;ref name=Paladin/&gt; This positive neuroethical understanding of [[mental health]] consequently led to the establishment of the first [[psychiatric hospital]]s in the medieval Islamic world from the 8th century,&lt;ref name=Dening-57&gt;{{harvnb|Youssef|Youssef|Dening|1996|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an early scientific understanding of [[neuroscience]] and [[psychology]] by medieval [[Islamic medicine|Muslim physicians]] and psychologists, who discovered that mental disorders are caused by [[Abnormality (behavior)|dysfunctions]] in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Youssef|Youssef|Dening|1996|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military ethics==
{{main|Islamic military jurisprudence}}

The early Islamic treatises on [[international law]] from the 9th century onwards covered the application of Islamic ethics, [[Islamic economic jurisprudence]] and [[Islamic military jurisprudence]] to international law,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelsay|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were concerned with a number of modern international law topics, including the [[law of treaties]]; the treatment of diplomats, [[hostage]]s, [[refugee]]s and [[prisoners of war]]; the [[right of asylum]]; [[Laws of war|conduct on the battlefield]]; protection of women, children and [[non-combatant]] civilians; contracts across the lines of [[battle]]; the use of [[poison]]ous weapons; and devastation of enemy territory.&lt;ref name=Weeramantry&gt;{{harvnb|Weeramantry|1997|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Islamic legal principles of international law were mainly based on Qur'an and the [[Sunnah]] of Muhammad, who gave various injunctions to his forces and adopted practices toward the conduct of war. The most important of these were summarized by Muhammad's [[caliph|successor]] and [[Sahaba|close companion]], [[Abu Bakr]], in the form of ten rules for the Muslim army:&lt;ref name=Zuhur&gt;{{harvnb|Aboul-Enein|Zuhur|2004|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=Stop, O people, that I may give you ten rules for your guidance in the battlefield. Do not commit treachery or deviate from the right path. You must not mutilate dead bodies. Neither kill a child, nor a woman, nor an aged man. Bring no harm to the trees, nor burn them with fire, especially those which are fruitful. Slay not any of the enemy's flock, save for your food. You are likely to pass by people who have devoted their lives to monastic services; leave them alone.&lt;ref name=Zuhur/&gt;}}

===Prisoners of war===
{{main|Prisoners of war in Islam}}

After Sultan [[al-Kamil]] defeated the [[Franks]] during the [[Crusades]], Oliverus Scholasticus praised the Islamic [[laws of war]], commenting on how al-Kamil supplied the defeated Frankish army with food:&lt;ref name=Weeramantry/&gt;

{{quote|text=Who could doubt that such goodness, friendship and charity come from God? Men whose parents, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, had died in agony at our hands, whose lands we took, whom we drove naked from their homes, revived us with their own food when we were dying of hunger and showered us with kindness even when we were in their power.&lt;ref name="Weeramantry136-7" /&gt;}}

==Peace and justice==
{{main|Peace In Islamic Thought}}

As in other [[Abrahamic faith|Abrahamic]] religions, peace is a basic concept of [[Islam]]. The [[Arabic language|Arabic]] term "Islam" itself (إسلام) is usually translated as "submission"; submission of desires to the will of God. It comes from the term ''aslama'', which means "to surrender" or "resign oneself".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Islam | encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam Online | author=L. Gardet, J. Jomier}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lane|p=1413}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arabic word ''[[S-L-M|salaam]]'' (سلام) ("peace") has the same [[S-L-M|root]] as the word ''Islam''.&lt;ref name="Harper"&gt;{{harvnb|Harper|2001|loc=Islam}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One Islamic interpretation is that individual personal peace is attained by utterly submitting to [[Allah]]. The greeting "[[S-L-M|Salaam alaykum]]", favoured by [[Muslims]], has the literal meaning "Peace be with you".&lt;ref name="Harper" /&gt; Muhammad is reported to have said once, "Mankind are the dependents, or slaves of God, and the most beloved of them to God are those who are the most excellent to His dependents." "Not one of you believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself." Great Muslim scholars of prophetic tradition such as [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani]] and Sharafuddin al [[Al-Nawawi|Nawawi]] have said&lt;ref&gt;[[Fath al-Bari]] and sharh [[sahih bukhari]] by Imam Al Nawawi&lt;/ref&gt; that the words "his brother" mean any person irrespective of faith.

==Welfare==
{{main|Bayt al-mal}}

The concepts of [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] and pension were introduced in early Islamic law as forms of ''[[Zakat]]'' (charity), one of the [[Five Pillars of Islam]], since the time of the [[Abbasid]] [[caliph]] [[Al-Mansur]] in the 8th century. The taxes (including ''Zakat'' and ''[[Jizya]]'') collected in the [[treasury]] of an Islamic government was used to provide income for the needy, including the [[Poverty|poor]], [[Old age|elderly]], [[orphan]]s, [[widow]]s, and the [[Disability|disabled]]. According to the Islamic jurist [[Al-Ghazali]] (Algazel, 1058–1111), the government was also expected to store up food supplies in every region in case a [[disaster]] or [[famine]] occurs. The [[Caliphate]] was thus one of the earliest [[welfare state]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Crone|2005|pp=308–309}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hamid|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 9th century, funds from the treasury were also used towards the ''[[Waqf]]'' ([[charitable trust]]s), often for the purpose of building of [[Madrassah]]s and [[Bimaristan]] hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Crone|2005|pp=309–310, 312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animal welfare===
{{See also|Islam and animals}}

Concern for the treatment of animals can be found in the Qur'an and in the teachings of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad, which inspired debates over [[animal rights]] by later medieval Muslim scholars. The 10th-century work, "''Disputes Between Animals and Man''", part of the [[Epistles of the Brethren of Purity]], has been considered a classic in this regard. Inspired by the [[Ayah|Qur'anic verse]]: "all the creatures that crawl on the earth and those that fly with their wings are communities like yourselves" (6:38), the [[Shafi'i]] jurist [['Izz al-Din Ibn 'Abd al-Salam al-Sulami]] (d. 1262) formulated the first full-fledged charter of the rights of livestock and animals in his legal treatise ''Rules for Judgement in the Cases of Living Beings'' (''Qawa'id al-ahkam fi masalih al-anam'') which was based on the stories and sayings of Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sardar|2011|p=270}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coward|1995|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bekoff|2010|p=464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9580">[[File:Jug from Lydian Treasure Usak.jpg|thumb|200px|Jug from Lydian Treasure found near Uşak]] 

'''Karun Treasure''' is the name given to a collection of 363 valuable [[Lydia]]n artifacts dating from the 7th century BC and originating from [[Uşak Province]] in western Turkey belonging to Karun Khan Bhutto, which were the subject of a [[legal battle]] between [[Turkey]] and [[New York Metropolitan Museum of Art]] between 1987–1993 and which were returned to Turkey in 1993 after the Museum admitted it had known the objects were stolen when they had purchased them. The collection is alternatively known as the ''Lydian Hoard''. The items are exhibited in the [[Uşak Museum of Archaeology]].

The collection made sensational news once again in May 2006 when a key piece, a golden [[hippocamp]], on display in [[Uşak]] Museum along with the rest of the collection, was discovered to have been switched with a [[counterfeit|fake]], probably between March and August 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/5027074.stm | title = Croesus riches replaced by fakes|author=|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]| accessdate=2006-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Yet another term used for the collection is "Croesus Treasure". Although the artifacts were closely contemporary to [[Croesus]], whether they should be directly associated with the legendary Lydian king or not remains debatable. Croesus' wealth had repercussions on a number of [[Asia]]n cultures in a vein similar to his fame in the western cultures, and is referred to either as ''Qarun'' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Urdu language|Urdu]]) or Karun ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]), or [[Korah]], with the mythical proportions of his fortune also echoed in various ways, parallel to the [[English language]] expression "as rich as Croesus".&lt;ref&gt;Qarun and reference to his wealth mentioned in the [[Koran]] (''[28:76] to [28:82]''). In [[Persian mythology]], to which the other citations could be connected, the ''Qârun Treasure'' is a treasure said to be in perpetual motion under the ground. The phrase ''harta karun'' (literally Croesus' Wealth) also worked into the Malay language as the word for ''treasure'' and is synonymous with the term ''buried treasure''. ''Ganj-e-Qarun'' (Croesus Treasure) was also an [[Iran]]ian movie made in 1965 by [[Siamak Yasami]] and widely regarded as one of the classics of [[Iranian cinema]]. The movie recounts the story of a very wealthy man who attempts suicide and then finds happiness in the simplicity of a pauper's home.&lt;/ref&gt; This explains why the term "Karun Treasure" took hold, and in any case, the king Croesus' Treasure consisted of more than 363 pieces and the tomb chamber [[tumulus]] where most artifacts were discovered (they originate from close but different sites) was that of a woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.serfed.com/dergi/10/15-ANADOLU_UYGARLIKLARI.pdf|title=The rich kings of the thousand hills, Lydians|last=|first=|date=|website=http://www.serfed.com|publisher=Turkish Ceramic Federation|author=Nezih Başgelen|accessdate=2005-07-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070122153206/http://www.serfed.com/dergi/10/15-ANADOLU_UYGARLIKLARI.pdf|archivedate=January 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery and smuggling==
The main and the most precious part of the treasure comes from a tomb chamber of a Lydian princess reached through illegal excavations carried out by three fortune-seekers from Uşak's depending Güre village, at the proximity of which the tomb was located, at the locality called Toptepe. After having dug for days and unable to break through the marble masonry of the chamber door, they had [[dynamite]]d the roof of the tomb in the night of 6 June 1966, to be the first to see the breathtaking sight of the buried Lydian noblewoman and her treasures after 2600 years. The treasure looted from this particular tomb was enriched by further finds by the same men in other [[tumuli]] of the locality during 1966-1967. The collection was smuggled outside Turkey in separate dispatches through [[İzmir]] and [[Amsterdam]], to be bought by the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] between 1967–1968, at an invoiced cost of $1.2 million for 200 of the pieces within the collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tayproject.org/Haber.fm$Retrieve?ID=1267&amp;html=haber_detail_tu.html&amp;layout=web|title=Uşak-New York|last=|first=|date=|website=http://www.tayproject.org|publisher=TAY Project|language=Turkish|author=|accessdate=2001-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal battle==

The efforts made by successive Turkish governments to retrieve the collection were incited since the very beginning and followed until conclusion by the journalist [[Özgen Acar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/courier/2001_04/uk/doss27.htm |title=We have to change the buyer's attitude |author=Michel Bessières |publisher=[[UNESCO]] Courrier |accessdate=2001-04-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010723161923/http://www.unesco.org/courier/2001_04/uk/doss27.htm |archivedate=2001-07-23 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Acar had chanced upon some pieces of the collection for the first time in 1984 in a Met Museum [[Collection catalog|catalogue]] and had informed Turkey's [[Culture and Tourism Ministry of Turkey|Ministry of Culture]] of their clear provenance, while he also wrote several articles and pursued the bureaucratic channels within Turkey with insistence throughout the affair. He acted as a voluntary envoy of the Ministry within the frame of the judicial case launched in [[New York City]] in 1987 and brought to conclusion in 1993,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.herrick.com/Upload/Publication/Articles/ArticleHF_0208.pdf|title=The Art Theft Experts|author=Thomas Adcock|publisher=[[New York Law Journal]]|accessdate=2006-02-24|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061031010110/http://www.herrick.com/Upload/Publication/Articles/ArticleHF_0208.pdf|archivedate=2006-10-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the same time as he was named [[consultant]] in the larger framework of the Turkey's participation in the work carried out by [[UNIDROIT]] regarding the protection of historic, cultural and religious heritage. Acar's name is also synonymous in Turkey for the retrieval of another set of smuggled archaeological goods, termed "Elmalı Treasure" in reference to their site of origin, the town of [[Elmalı]] in southwestern Turkey, and involving this time [[Lydia]]n coins and extremely rare [[drachma|decadrachms]] dating from the period of the [[Delian League]], with the [[Boston Museum of Fine Arts]] as his opposite party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum-security.org/reports/003199.html#8|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000823041626/http://museum-security.org/reports/003199.html#8|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2000-08-23|title=Elmalı treasure|author=|publisher=Museum Security|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uşak Museum case==
The clear need for a museum worthy of the treasure was being voiced ever since the artifacts had returned to Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.worldpress.org/Europe/1491.cfm | title = Croesus: The poverty of treasure|author=[[Özgen Acar]]|publisher=[[Cumhuriyet]]| accessdate=2003-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the seizure by the authorities of ten other illegally excavated artifacts in 1998, further archaeological discoveries and the known presence of eight gold pieces that had appeared in 2000 during an exhibition in a [[Paris]] private gallery for which attempts for retrieval were yet to be made, a handsome collection of base consisting of a total of 375 pieces was already accumulated. But the small museum in [[Uşak]] where the collection was placed, more focused on storage of [[Ushak carpet]]s and operating under conditions of budgetary and staff restraints,&lt;ref&gt;The number of experts working in Turkish museums halved from 1,500 to 750 in the last ten years. {{cite web|url=http://www.turkishdailynews.com.tr/article.php?enewsid=48792|title=Croesus: Ten people charged in Croesus theft case|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Turkish Daily News]]|author=|accessdate=2003-07-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060717031211/http://www.turkishdailynews.com.tr/article.php?enewsid=48792|archivedate=2006-07-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; did not fully meet the requirements for the preservation of Karun Treasure. Doubts about the site's suitability were reinforced by the filing of currently unresolved legal action against museum staff regarding the 2007 theft. The museum's former director remains the only person to be still kept in [[police custody|custody]] among the ten initially accused in the frame of the case around the hippocamp's replacement with a fake.

==Curse of the treasure==
Some{{who|date=December 2013}} in Uşak and beyond associate the treasure with a [[curse]]. Legend has it that the seven men who took part in the illegal digs "died violent deaths or suffered great misfortune".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/25/king-croesus-treasure-returning-turkey|title= King Croesus's golden brooch to be returned to Turkey |work=The Guardian|author=Constanze Letsch|date=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15591">'''Kim Timby''' (born 1970 in California, United States) is a [[History of photography|photography historian]] based in Paris who teaches at the [[École du Louvre]] and works as a curator for a private collection specialising international nineteenth-century photography. From her research and teaching, Timby writes on the cultural history of photography as a technology.

== Education ==
Timby’s research draws on her learning, and combines her interests, in [[anthropology]], history and photography. Her early experience of the medium was through her maternal grandmother, who had a darkroom and was active in her local photo club and showed her how to print in the darkroom. Her first camera was a high school graduation gift.

Timby was educated at the private [[Connecticut College]], [[New London, Connecticut|New London]], where as an Anthropology undergraduate she undertook a minor subject studio arts, studying photography and making photographs in the vintage processes of [[cyanotype]] and [[gum printing]]. From there she  graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in [[Social anthropology|Social Anthropology]] in 1992 before completing an M.A. in that discipline in 1996 at the [[École des hautes études en sciences sociales|École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales]], [[France]], and from 2002–2006 undertook her PhD at the same [[Paris]] institution.

== Career ==
Timby’s Master's thesis was "La photographie et l'ethnologie de la France. Modes d'emploi et apports de l'image" (‘Photography and the ethnology of France. Uses and contributions of the image’) dealing with the usefulness of photography to museums of French [[ethnography]] and how photography was employed by anthropologists in their [[Field research|field work]] and publications in studying French culture or as object of study in its own right. This research shifted her interest from traditional anthropology toward history, taking her into the [[history of photography]], where her anthropology guides her consideration of its cultural impact.

Timby’s research subsequent to her master's degree and her interest in photographic technologies and their social utility and impact stem also from her work as a [[curator]]. From 1996 to 2001 she was employed in that role at the [[Carnavalet Museum|Musée Carnavalet]], the museum of the history of Paris, a city so closely associated with the progress of photography from its invention.

There she prepared exhibitions including "Paris in 3D: from Stereoscopy to Virtual Reality, 1850-2000”, an exercise in configuring rigorous academic archival research for general consumption.

Timby had first become interested in [[Stereoscopy|stereography]] when working with the photography historian [[Peter E. Palmquist|Peter Palmquist]] for a month in the early 1990s as an undergraduate in the US. His study of original photographs and primary source materials to uncover overlooked aspects of the history of photography chimed with her background in anthropology and as an historian. Palmquist took her to an antique shop in [[Arcata, California|Arcata]] (California) where he lived, and there she bought her first stereo view.

Timby was able to find temporary work that engaged her interest in photography and anthropology at the [[Musée de l'Homme|Musée de l’Homme]] photography department and Musée Carnavalet specialising in the history of Paris. In 1996 she began co-curating a 3D exhibition at the Carnavalet museum, and the resultant display opened in Paris in October 2000 and closed January 2001. The exhibition and catalogue&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Reynaud, Francoise | author2=Tambrun, Catherine | author3=Timby, Kim | author4=Musıe Carnavalet | title=Paris in 3D : from stereoscope to virtual reality, 1850-2000 | publication-date=2000 | publisher=Booth Clibborn Editions | isbn=978-1-86154-162-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in English and in French ( “Paris en 3D: de la stéréoscopie à la réalité virtuelle, 1850-2000”) in hardbound editions, appealed to a diverse audience who, using the different stereo viewers enclosed in the book, could enjoy hundreds of images, stereo pairs, [[Anaglyph 3D|anaglyphs]], [[Lenticular printing|lenticular]] images and [[Holography|holograms]], of Parisian life from the early nineteenth century to the present. Timby contributed text that one reviewer&lt;ref&gt;Rulien, Diane E. "Paris in 3D: From the Stereoscope to Virtual Reality 1850-2000." PSA Journal, vol. 67, no. 3, 2001, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;  called an ‘historical roadmap of the techniques leading to the development of 3D photography from stereocards, anaglyphs, and holograms to 3D computer imagery and [[virtual reality]]’. The book and exhibition were of ‘landmark’ historical value, in the opinion of another reviewer,&lt;ref&gt;Britt Salvesen, Curator and Department Head of the Wallis Annenberg Photography Department, Prints and Drawings Department, at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art,  ‘A Deep Look at Lenticulars’, in the National Stereoscopic Association (U.S.) journal Stereo world. Columbus, Ohio. March/April 2016. 18-19&lt;/ref&gt; with many of its pictures showing antique equipment and portraits of pioneers of stereoscopy and integrated biographical information and excerpts of treatises of prominent persons in stereoscopy. In the opinion of David Haberstich, the exhibition was ‘definitive’ in dealing with perception, art, and technology.&lt;ref&gt;“There will be other exhibitions dealing with stereoscopy and virtual reality, given the importance of the subject, but it is difficult to imagine anything similarly definitive and of comparable diversity and magnitude. If the exhibition 'Paris en 3D' was essentially about perception, art, and technology, rather than about documenting the history of a city, nevertheless its concentration on Paris provided a unique and rational focus. The catalogue serves as a permanent surrogate and constitutes a landmark study in this specialized area of the history of photography, with profound implications for future discourse about photographic vision.” David Haberstich (2001) in Book Reviews, History of Photography, 25:4, 392-396, DOI: 10.1080/03087298.2001.10443243&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, with a training and research grant from the Ministry of Culture and Communication (photographic patrimony) for access to patents, and by the Carnavalet museum as part of her work on the exhibition "Paris in 3D: de stereoscopy to virtual reality, 1850-2000 ", Timby published a 23-page academic paper on research into commercial, advertising, entertainment, and even medical and religious, applications of the lenticular image invention in France, and its technical development.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Timby, ‘Images en relief et images changeantes. La photographie à réseau ligné’, Études photographiques, no. 9, May 2001, p. 124-147&lt;/ref&gt;

== Investigation into 3D and colour photography ==
When researching 3D imaging Timby found that [[Color photography|colour]] was a major consideration, a thread that developed during her PhD on lenticular photography, begun after "Paris in 3D" closed and she had left Carnavalet. Her first published work on colour was the 2005 article "Colour Photography and Stereoscopy: Parallel Histories," from she developed the idea that colour, like 3D, was a constructed illusion; an ambition in common of the two technologies was the reproduction of an aspect of [[Perception|human perception]] through its [[deconstruction]] and reconstruction.”&lt;ref&gt;Kim Timby. ‘Colour Photography and Stereoscopy: Parallel Histories’, History of Photography, vol. 29, n" 2. Summer 2005, p. 183-196.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2005, before the completion in 2006 of her PhD at the Paris École des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales (EHESS), Timby was appointed Director of Collections at the Musée [[Nicéphore Niépce]] in [[Chalon-sur-Saône]], France which houses the archive of devices and objects once belonging to the inventor of photography as well as nearly three million images from all photographic processes.

There, her work included curating "Sous un beau ciel bleu: un siècle de couleurs et de photographie" (June 17–October 1, 2006), augmenting the second strand of her research interests, colour photography, into the technological, [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]], and social history which she has since pursued investigations alongside stereoscopy.  Timby’s other projects at the Musée Nicéphore Niépce included designing and implementing new permanent exhibition spaces structured around a rotating series of mini-exhibits, thus continuing her informed engagement with a wide audience.

Timby elaborates a cultural history of photography by examining human engagement with, and transformation of, its particular techniques and technologies, as she does with the [[Photo booth|photo-booth]], precursor to the ‘[[Selfie stick|selfie-stick]]’, in her paper “Photographies d’amitié. De l’usage collectif du photomaton,” (‘Photographs of friendships: the collective use of the photo booth’). For the same purpose, she tracks the mid-century development of colour printing technologies for magazine photographs as a response to audiences’ and advertisers’ desire, and the adaptation of photographers, amateur and professional, to its availability and special demands.

== Researching animated photography ==
In a move to alma mater École des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales in 2009, and until 2012, Timby co-coordinated investigation in "La Création Photographique", a research program in the history of photography funded by the [[Agence nationale de la recherche|Agence Nationale de la Recherche]].

During this period she published a chapter 'Le cinéma dans une seule photo' : le portrait animé des années 1910’, a contribution to a collection of essays on the crossover between cinema and the still image,&lt;ref&gt;Guido, L., &amp; Lugon, O. (2010). Fixe-animé: Croisements de la photographie et du cinéma au XXe siécle. Paris: L'Age d'Homme.&lt;/ref&gt; also reproduced as ‘Cinema in a Single Photo: The Animated Screen Portrait of the 1910s’ in an English edition.&lt;ref&gt;Guido, L., &amp; Lugon, O. (2012). Between still and moving images: Photography and cinema in the 20th century. London: John Libbey Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Her text first raises the way that lenticular [[animation]], in novelty portraits and advertising, satisfied an expectation of progress toward ever more perceptual [[Realism (arts)|naturalism]] in photographic technologies, and this was expanded in the second chapter of her book ''3D and Animated Lenticular Photography: Between Utopia and Entertainment'', published in 2015.

Response to the book was positive and recognised the value of Timby’s contribution to the literature on lenticular imagery which in comparison to the history and analysis of other 3D technologies had received little attention.&lt;ref&gt;reviewed by Jan Baetens, ''[[Leonardo (journal)|Leonardo]]'', October 2016 [https://www.leonardo.info/review/2016/10/review-of-3d-and-animated-lenticular-photography-between-utopia-and-entertainment]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Britt Salvesen,  ‘A Deep Look at Lenticulars’ in the National Stereoscopic Association (U.S.) journal Stereo world.

In ''Lettre mensuelle du Stéréo-Club Français'' Octobre 2015, n°984. p.19&lt;/ref&gt;

== Teaching ==
Alongside the research affiliation with the EHESS where she was also in charge of a postgraduate seminar, Timby was a professor at the [[Paris College of Art]] from January 2010 to the end of 2012 and is currently, since 2005, professor responsible for the [[École du Louvre]]'s intensive 3-year History of Photography survey course.&lt;ref&gt;Laureline Meizel. ”Images à la sauvette” et papiers gras ou pourquoi et comment se salir les doigts.

'''Models of communication''' are [[conceptual model]]s used to explain the human [[communication]] [[:wikt:process|process]]. The first major model for communication was developed in 1948 by [[Claude Elwood Shannon]] and published with an introduction by [[Warren Weaver]] for [[Bell Laboratories]].&lt;ref name="Shannon"&gt;Shannon, C. E., &amp; Weaver, W. (1949). ''The mathematical theory of communication''. Urbana, Illinois: [[University of Illinois Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Theory of communication|basic concept]], communication is the process of sending and receiving [[message]]s or transferring [[information]] from one part (sender) to another (receiver).{{sfn|Craig|1999}}

In 1960, David Berlo expanded the linear transmission model &lt;ref name="Berlo"&gt;Berlo, D. K. (1960). The process of communication; an introduction to theory and practice. New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston. Claude E Shannon, W. W. (1949)&lt;/ref&gt; with the Sender-Message-Channel-Receiver(SMCR) Model of Communication. &lt;ref name="Schulz"&gt;Schulz, Peter. Cobley, Paul. (2013). Theories and Models of Communication. Berlin: De Gruyter Mouton. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Wilbur Schramm introduced a model that identified multiple variables in communication which includes the transmitter, encoding, media, decoding, and receiver. &lt;ref name="Qing-Lan"&gt;Qing-Lan Chen, Chiou-Shuei Wei, Mei-Yao Huang and Chiu-Chi Wei. (2013) A model for project communication
medium evaluation and selection.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shannon-Weaver Model==
Elwood Shannon and Warren Weaver were engineers that worked for Bell Telephone Labs in the United States. Their goal was to make sure that the telephone cables and radio waves were working at the maximum efficiency. Therefore, they developed the Shannon-Weaver model which had an intention to expand a mathematical theory of communication.&lt;ref name="Chandler"&gt;Chandler Daniel, The Transmission Model of Communication. http://transcriptions-2008.english.ucsb.edu/archive/courses/warner/english197/Schedule_files/Chandler/Transmission.model_files/trans.htm (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; The Shannon–Weaver model was developed in 1949 which is referred as the 'mother of all models'.&lt;ref name="Hollnagel"&gt;Erik Hollnagel, David D. Woods. Joint Cognitive Systems: Foundations of Cognitive Systems Engineering. CRC Press. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The model is well accepted as a main initial model for Communication Studies which has grown since then.&lt;ref name="Fiske"&gt; Fiske, John. Introduction to Communication Studies. London: Routledge (Chapter 1, 'Communication Theory' is a good introduction to this topic). (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

As well, the [[Shannon-Weaver model]] was designed to mirror the functioning of radio and telephone technology. Their initial model consisted of four primary parts: [[sender]], [[message]], [[Channel (communications)|channel]], and [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]]. The sender was the part of a [[telephone]] a person speaks into, the channel was the telephone itself, and the receiver was the part of the phone through which one can hear the person on the other end of the line. Shannon and Weaver also recognized that there may often be static or background sounds that interfere with the process of the other partner in a telephone conversation; they referred to this as noise. Certain types of background sounds can also indicate the absence of a signal.&lt;ref name="Chandler"/&gt;

The original model of Shannon and Weaver has five elements: information source, transmitter, channel, receiver, and destination.  To illustrate the process of the communication the first step is the information source where the information is stored. Next, in order to send the information, the message is encoded into signals, so it can travel to its destination. After the message is encoded, it goes through the channel which the signals are adapted for the transmission. In addition, the channel carried the noise course which is any interference that might happen to lead to the signal receive a different information from the source. After the channel, the message arrives in the receiver step where the message reconstruct (decode) from the signal. Finally, the message arrives at the destination.&lt;ref name="Faustine" /&gt;

In a simple model, often referred to as ''the transmission model'' or ''standard view of communication'', [[information]] or content (e.g. a message in [[natural language]]) is sent in some form (as [[spoken language]]) from an emissor/ sender/ [[encoder]] to a destination/ receiver/ decoder. According to this common communication-related conception, communication is viewed as a means of sending and receiving information. The strengths of this model are its simplicity, generality, and quantifiability. The mathematicians Claude Shannon and Warren Weaver structured this model on the basis of the following elements:

* An [[information source]], which produces a message.
* A [[transmitter]], which encodes the message into signals
* A [[Channel (communications)|channel]], for which signals are adapted for transmission
* A [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]], which reconstructs the encoded message from a sequence of received signals and decodes it.
* An information destination, where the message arrives.

Shannon and Weaver argued that this concept entails three levels of problems for communication:

# The technical problem: how accurately can the message be transmitted?
# The [[semantic]] problem: how precisely is the meaning 'conveyed'?
# The effectiveness problem: how effectively does the received meaning affect behavior?

[[Daniel Chandler]] criticizes the transmission model in the following terms:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = The Transmission Model of Communication|last = Chandler|first = Daniel|authorlink = |coauthors = |year = 1994|publisher = University of Western Australia|location = |isbn = |page = |pages = |url = http://visual-memory.co.uk/daniel/Documents/short/trans.html|accessdate = 11.06.2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* It assumes that communicators are isolated individuals.
* It makes no allowance for differing purposes.
* It makes no allowance for differing interpretations.
* It makes no allowance for unequal power relationships.

== Berlo ==

In 1960, David Berlo expanded Shannon and Weaver's 1949 linear model of communication and created the Sender-Message-Channel-Receiver (SMCR) Model of Communication.&lt;ref&gt;Berlo, D. K. (1960).'' The process of communication''. New York, New York: Holt, Rinehart, &amp; Winston.&lt;/ref&gt; The SMCR Model of Communication separated the model into clear parts and has been expanded upon by other scholars.

The Berlo's communication process is a simple application for communication of person-to-person which include communication source, encoder, message, channel, decoder, and communication receiver. &lt;ref name="Ann"&gt;Ann, Bette. Berlo's Communication Process Model as Applied to the Behavioral Theories of Maslow, Herzberg, and McGrego. Stead Source: The Academy of Management Journal, Vol. 15, No. 3 (Sep., 1972), pp. 389-394 Published by: Academy of Management Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/254868 &lt;/ref&gt; In addition, David Berlo presented some factors that influence the communication process between two people. The factors include communication skills, awareness level, social system, cultural system, and attitude.&lt;ref name="Sluková"&gt;Sluková, Petra Zia. Studies of Information and Knowledge Management in he European Context: No. 5 Communication of Information Reg. No: CZ.1.07/2.2.00/07.0284 OP: Education for Competitiveness Support area. 2.2 University Education Realization: VŠB-Technical University of Ostrava, Faculty of Economics, separate unit: Business Academy and HPS Valašské Meziříčí&lt;/ref&gt;

The Berlo's Model of Communication process starts at the source. This is the part where determine the communication skills, attitude, knowledge, social system, and culture of the people involved in the communication. After the message is developed which is elements in a set of symbols. &lt;ref name="Sluková" /&gt; Then the encoder step beginning. The encoder process is where the motor skills take place by speaking or writing. &lt;ref name="Ann" /&gt; The message goes through the channel which carries the message by hearing, seeing, touching, smelling, or tasting.&lt;ref name="Berlo" /&gt; Then the decoder process takes place. In this process, the receiver interpreter the message with her or him sensory skills. Finally, the communication receiver gets the whole message understood.&lt;ref name="Ann" /&gt;

== Schramm ==

Communication is usually described along a few major dimensions: Message (what type of things are communicated), source / emissor / sender / [[encoder]] (by whom), form (in which form), channel (through which [[media (communication)|medium]]), destination / receiver / target / decoder (to whom), and Receiver. [[Wilbur Schramm]] (1954) also indicated that we should also examine the impact that a message has (both desired and undesired) on the target of the message.&lt;ref&gt;Schramm, W. (1954). How communication works. In W. Schramm (Ed.), ''The process and effects of communication'' (pp. 3-26). Urbana, Illinois: University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Between parties, communication includes acts that confer knowledge and experiences, give advice and commands, and ask questions. These acts may take many forms, in one of the various manners of communication. The form depends on the abilities of the group communicating. Together, communication content and form make [[message]]s that are sent towards a destination. The target can be oneself, another [[Interpersonal Communication|person]] or being, another entity (such as a corporation or group of beings).

Communication can be seen as processes of [[information transmission]] governed by three levels of [[semiotic]] rules:
#[[Syntactic]] (formal properties of signs and symbols),
#[[Pragmatics|Pragmatic]] (concerned with the relations between signs/expressions and their users) and
#[[Semantic]] (study of relationships between signs and symbols and what they represent).

Therefore, communication is [[Interpersonal relationship|social interaction]] where at least two interacting agents share a common set of signs and a common set of [[semiotic]] rules. This commonly held rule in some sense ignores [[semiotics|autocommunication]], including [[intrapersonal communication]] via [[diary|diaries]] or self-talk, both secondary phenomena that followed the primary acquisition of communicative competences within social interactions.

== Barnlund ==

In light of these weaknesses, Barnlund (1970) proposed a transactional model of communication.&lt;ref&gt;Barnlund, D. C. (2008). A transactional model of communication. In. C. D. Mortensen (Eds.), ''Communication theory'' (2nd ed., pp47-57). New Brunswick, New Jersey: Transaction.&lt;/ref&gt;  The basic premise of the transactional model of communication is that individuals are simultaneously engaging in the sending and receiving of messages.

In a slightly more complex form, a sender and a receiver are linked [[wikt:reciprocal|reciprocally]]. This second attitude of communication, referred to as the constitutive model or constructionist view, focuses on how an individual communicates as the determining factor of the way the message will be interpreted. Communication is viewed as a conduit; a passage in which information travels from one individual to another and this information becomes separate from the communication itself. A particular instance of communication is called a [[speech act]].  The sender's personal filters and the receiver's personal filters may vary depending upon different regional traditions, cultures, or gender; which may alter the intended meaning of message contents.  In the presence of "[[communication noise|noise]]" on the transmission channel (air, in this case), reception and decoding of content may be faulty, and thus the speech act may not achieve the desired effect. One problem with this encode-transmit-receive-decode model is that the processes of encoding and decoding imply that the sender and receiver each possess something that functions as a [code-book], and that these two code books are, at the very least, similar if not identical.  Although something like code books is implied by the model, they are nowhere represented in the model, which creates many conceptual difficulties.

Theories of [[co-regulation]] describe communication as a creative and dynamic continuous process, rather than a discrete exchange of information. Canadian media scholar [[Harold Innis]] had the theory that people use different types of media to communicate and which one they choose to use will offer different possibilities for the shape and durability of society.&lt;ref name="Wark1997"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wark|first=McKenzie|year=1997|title=The Virtual Republic|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin, St Leonards}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2017}} His famous example of this is using [[ancient Egypt]] and looking at the ways they built themselves out of media with very different properties stone and papyrus. Papyrus is what he called ''''Space Binding''''. it made possible the transmission of written orders across space, empires and enables the waging of distant military campaigns and colonial administration. The other is stone and ''''Time Binding'''', through the construction of temples and the pyramids can sustain their authority generation to generation, through this media they can change and shape communication in their society.&lt;ref name="Wark1997"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2017}}

== Constructionist ==

There is an additional working definition of communication to consider{{examples|date=October 2011}} that authors like Richard A. Lanham (2003) and as far back as Erving Goffman (1959) have highlighted.  This is a progression from Lasswell's attempt to define human communication through to this century and revolutionized into the constructionist model.  Constructionists believe that the process of communication is in itself the only messages that exist.  The packaging can not be separated from the social and historical context from which it arose, therefore the substance to look at in communication theory is style for Richard Lanham and the performance of self for Erving Goffman.

Lanham chose to view communication as the rival to the over encompassing use of [[CBS model]] (which pursued to further the transmission model). CBS model argues that clarity, brevity, and sincerity are the only purpose to prose discourse, therefore communication. Lanham wrote: "If words matter too, if the whole range of human motive is seen as animating prose discourse, then rhetoric analysis leads us to the essential questions about prose style" (Lanham 10). This is saying that rhetoric and style are fundamentally important; they are not errors to what we actually intend to transmit. The process which we construct and deconstruct meaning deserves analysis.

Erving Goffman sees the performance of self as the most important frame to understand communication. Goffman wrote: "What does seem to be required of the individual is that he learn enough pieces of expression to be able to 'fill in' and manage, more or less, any part that he is likely to be given" (Goffman 73), highlighting the significance of expression.

The truth in both cases is the articulation of the message and the package as one. The construction of the message from social and historical context is the seed as is the pre-existing message is for the transmission model. Therefore, any look into communication theory should include the possibilities drafted by such great scholars as [[Richard A. Lanham]] and Goffman that style and performance is the whole process. lun

Communication stands so deeply rooted in human [[behavior]]s and the structures of [[society]] that scholars have difficulty thinking of it while excluding social or behavioral events.{{weasel inline|date=October 2011}} Because communication theory remains a relatively young field of inquiry and integrates itself with other disciplines such as philosophy, psychology, and sociology, one probably cannot {{As of|2006|alt=yet}} expect a consensus conceptualization of communication across disciplines.{{weasel inline|date=October 2011}}

Communication Model Terms as provided by Rothwell (11-15):
*''Noise''; interference with effective transmission and reception of a message.
**For example;
***physical noise or external noise which are environmental distractions such as poorly heated rooms, startling sounds, appearances of things, music playing some where else, and someone talking really loudly near you.
***physiological noise are biological influences that distract you from communicating competently such as sweaty palms, pounding heart, butterfly in the stomach, induced by speech anxiety, or feeling sick, exhausted at work, the ringing noise in your ear, being really hungry, and if you have a runny nose or a cough.
***psychological noise are the preconception bias and assumptions such as thinking someone who speaks like a valley girl is dumb, or someone from a foreign country can’t speak English well so you speak loudly and slowly to them.
***semantic noise are word choices that are confusing and distracting such as using the word tri-syllabic instead of three syllables.
*''Sender''; the initiator and encoder of a message
*''Receiver''; the one that receives the message (the listener) and the decoder of a message
*''Decode''; translates the sender's spoken idea/message into something the receiver understands by using their knowledge of language from personal experience.
*''Encode''; puts the idea into spoken language while putting their own meaning into the word/message.
*''Channel''; the medium through which the message travels such as through oral communication (radio, television, phone, in person) or written communication (letters, email, text messages)
*''Feedback''; the receiver's verbal and nonverbal responses to a message such as a nod for understanding (nonverbal), a raised eyebrow for being confused (nonverbal), or asking a question to clarify the message (verbal).
*''Message''; the verbal and nonverbal components of language that is sent to the receiver by the sender which conveys an idea.

Humans act toward people or things on the basis of the meanings they assign to those people or things.
-"Language is the source of meaning". 
-Meaning arises out of the social interaction people have with each other.

-Meaning is not inherent in objects but it is negotiated through the use of language, hence the term symbolic interactionism.
As human beings, we have the ability to name things.
Symbols, including names, are arbitrary signs.
By talking with others, we ascribe meaning to words and develop a universe of discourse
A symbol is a stimulus that has a learned/shared meaning and a value for people
Significant symbols can be nonverbal as well as linguistic.

-Negative responses can consequently reduce a person to nothing.
-Our expectations evoke responses that confirm what we originally anticipated, resulting in a self-fulfilling prophecy.

== Linear ==

This is a one-way model to communicate with others. It consists of the '''sender''' encoding a message and channeling it to the '''receiver''' in the presence of noise. In this model there is no feedback or response which may allow for a continuous 
exchange of information (F.N.S. Palma, 1993).

The linear model was first introduced by Shannon &amp; Weaver in 1949. In the linear communication model, the message travels one direction from the start point to the endpoint. In other words, once the sender sends the message to the receiver the communication process ends. Many communications online use the linear communication model. For example, when you send an email, post a blog, or share something on social media. However, the linear model does not explain many other forms of communication including face-to-face conversation.&lt;ref name="McCornack"&gt;McCornack, Steven. Ortiz, Joseph. Choice &amp; Connections: An Introduction to Communication. (2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interactive/convergence ==

It is two linear models stacked on top of each other. The sender channels a message to the receiver and the receiver then becomes the sender and channels a message to the original sender. This model has added feedback, indicating that communication is not a one way but a two way process. It also has "field of experience" which includes our cultural background, ethnicity geographic location, extent of travel, and general personal experiences accumulated over the course of your lifetime. Draw backs – there is feedback but it is not simultaneous.
[[File:Interactive.png|thumb|left|alt=An Interactive Model of Communication.|The Interactive Model.]]
*For example, – instant messaging. The sender sends an IM to the receiver, then the original sender has to wait for the IM from the original receiver to react. Or a question/answer session where you just ask a question then you get an answer.

== Communication theory framework ==

{{Main article|Theory of communication}}

Communication theory can be seen from one of the following viewpoints:

*Mechanistic:  This view{{who|date=October 2011}} considers communication as a perfect transaction of a message from the sender to the receiver. (as seen in the diagram above)
*Psychological:  This view{{who|date=October 2011}} considers communication as the act of sending a message to a receiver, and the feelings and thoughts of the receiver upon interpreting the message.
*Social [[Social constructionism|Constructionist]] (Symbolic Interactionist):  This view considers communication to be the product of the interactants sharing and creating meaning.  The Constructionist View can also be defined as, how you say something determines what the message is.  The Constructionist View assumes that "truth" and "ideas" are constructed or invented through the social process of communication.  [[Robert T. Craig (scholar)|Robert T. Craig]] saw the Constructionist View or the constitutive view as it's called in his article, as "…an ongoing process that symbolically forms and re-forms our personal identities." (Craig, 125).  The other view of communication, the Transmission Model, sees communication as robotic and computer-like.  The Transmission Model sees communication as a way of sending or receiving messages and the perfection of that.  But, the Constructionist View sees communications as, "…in human life, info does not behave as simply as bits in an electronic stream.  In human life, information flow is far more like an electric current running from one landmine to another" (Lanham, 7).  The Constructionist View is a more realistic view of communication {{opinion|date=October 2011}} because it involves the interacting of human beings and the free sharing of thoughts and ideas.  Daniel Chandler looks to prove that the Transmission Model is a lesser way of communicating by saying "The transmission model is not merely a gross over-simplification but a dangerously misleading representation of the nature of human communication" (Chandler, 2).  Humans do not communicate simply as computers or robots so that's why it's essential to truly understand the Constructionist View of Communication well.  We do not simply send facts and data to one another, but we take facts and data and they acquire meaning through the process of communication, or through interaction with others.
*Systemic:  This view{{who|date=October 2011}} considers communication to be the new messages created via "through-put", or what happens as the message is being interpreted and re-interpreted as it travels through people.
*Critical: This view considers communication as a source of power and oppression of individuals and social groups.&lt;ref&gt;Littlejohn, S.W. and Foss, K.A. (2008). Theories of human communication, 9th edition. Belmont, CA: Thomson Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspection of a particular theory on this level will provide a framework on the nature of communication as seen within the confines of that theory.

Theories can also be studied and organized according to the ontological, epistemological, and axiological framework imposed by the theorist.

== Ontology ==

[[Ontology]] essentially poses the question of what, exactly, the theorist is examining. One must consider the very nature of reality.  The answer usually falls in one of three realms depending on whether the theorist sees the phenomena through the lens of a realist, nominalist, or social constructionist. Realist perspective views the world objectively, believing that there is a world outside of our own experience and cognitions.  Nominalists see the world subjectively, claiming that everything outside of one's cognitions is simply names and labels.  Social constructionists straddle the fence between objective and subjective reality, claiming that reality is what we create together.{{lopsided|date=October 2011}}{{POV statement|date=October 2011}}

== Epistemology ==
[[Epistemology]] is an examination of the approaches and beliefs which inform particular modes of study of phenomena and domains of expertise. In positivist approaches to epistemology, objective knowledge is seen as the result of the empirical observation and perceptual experience. In the history of science, empirical evidence collected by way of pragmatic-calculation and the scientific method is believed to be the most likely to reflect truth in the findings. Such approaches are meant to predict a phenomenon.  Subjective theory holds that understanding is based on situated knowledge, typically found using interpretative methodology such as ethnography and also interviews. Subjective theories are typically developed to explain or understand phenomena in the social world.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

== Axiology ==

[[Axiology]] is concerned with how values inform research and theory development.{{sfn|Miller|2005}} Most communication theory is guided by one of three axiological approaches.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}  The first approach recognizes that values will influence theorists' interests but suggests that those values must be set aside once actual research begins. Outside replication of research findings is particularly important in this approach to prevent individual researchers' values from contaminating their findings and interpretations.{{sfn|Miller|2005|p=30}} The second approach rejects the idea that values can be eliminated from any stage of theory development. Within this approach, theorists do not try to divorce their values from inquiry. Instead, they remain mindful of their values so that they understand how those values contextualize, influence or skew their findings.{{sfn|Miller|2005|pp=30–31}} The third approach not only rejects the idea that values can be separated from research and theory, but rejects the idea that they should be separated.  This approach is often adopted by [[critical theorists]] who believe that the role of communication theory is to identify oppression and produce social change. In this axiological approach, theorists embrace their values and work to reproduce those values in their research and theory development.{{sfn|Miller|2005|p=31}}

'''Muskingum University''' is a private liberal arts college located in [[New Concord, Ohio]], United States. It is located approximately sixty miles east of the state capital of [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]]. Chartered in 1837 as Muskingum College, the institution is affiliated with the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]].

Collectively, the university's alumni are referred to as the "Long Magenta Line" and students (both past and present) are known simply as "Muskies" while its athletic teams are called the "Fighting Muskies". [[New Concord, Ohio]] is located in far eastern [[Muskingum County, Ohio|Muskingum County]], which derives its name from the [[Muskingum River]]. Muskingum offers more than 40 academic majors. Graduate programs are offered in education and management information systems, strategy and technology. Muskingum's campus consists of 21  buildings, a football stadium and a small lake, which all sit atop {{convert|225|acre|km2}} of rolling hills overlooking New Concord.

==History==
In 1827, the [[National Road]] (now [[U.S. Route 40 in Ohio|US 40]]) was laid through what is now New Concord, roughly following what had been the primitive roadway known as [[Zane's Trace]]. A year later, the village of [[New Concord, Ohio]] was established by Scotch-Irish [[Presbyterians]]. On July 9, 1836, the first recorded meeting of the ''"Friends of Education"'' in New Concord, led by New Concord residents Samuel Willson and Benjamin Waddle, was held. A year later, the [[Ohio General Assembly]] authorized the creation of a college in [[New Concord, OH]] after being petitioned by the ''"Friends of Education"'' committee. On April 24, 1837, Muskingum College opened. Muskingum became a coeducational institution in 1854. In 1958, the [[United Presbyterian Church of North America]] and the [[Presbyterian Church in the United States of America]] merged by signing a historic agreement in Brown Chapel on Muskingum's campus. In 2001, the school's women's [[softball]] team captured the [[NCAA]] Division III National Championship, the school's first national title.

==Academics==
Muskingum has been continuously accredited by the North Central Association of College and Secondary Schools since 1919. "The school up on the hill," as it is sometimes called by locals, offers [[Bachelor of Arts]] and [[Bachelor of Science]] degrees at the undergraduate level, and at the graduate level Master of Information Strategy Systems and Technology, [[Master of Arts in Education]], and [[Master of Arts in Teaching]] graduate degrees. The university offers 44 [[academic major]]s along with a large number of [[Minor (law)|minors]], 9 pre-professional programs (including [[pre-law]] and pre-medicine) and teaching licensure, all of which must be pursued within a strong [[liberal arts]] curriculum, known at Muskingum as the ''"Liberal Arts Essentials"'' (LAEs) (see below). Among Muskingum's strongest undergraduate academic programs are its science division, math program, education department, and English department. Muskingum is often proclaimed as a "best value" in education, by combining strong academics with low tuition, by ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' and similar publications. In their 2008 ''America's Best College's'' guide, ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' ranked Muskingum the "31st Best Master's Level University" in the Midwest academically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/usnews/edu/college/rankings/brief/t1univmas_mw_brief.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824025705/http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com:80/usnews/edu/college/rankings/brief/t1univmas_mw_brief.php |archivedate=2007-08-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the "4th Best Value" among Midwest Master's Level Universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/usnews/edu/college/rankings/brief/bvunivmas_mw_brief.php |title=Best Colleges &amp;#124; College Rankings &amp;#124; US News Education - US News |publisher=Colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com |date= |accessdate=2016-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
Most of Muskingum's academic buildings are clustered around a traditional quad near the southern part of the campus. The quad is bordered by Montgomery Hall and the College Library to the south, Caldwell Hall, Cambridge Hall and the Student/Faculty Center to the west, the Recreation Center and John Glenn Gym to the north and Boyd Science Center to the east. Brown Chapel sits on the southeastern corner of the quad.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==Fraternities and sororities==
More than one in every four undergraduate students at Muskingum are members of fraternities or sororities. The university has seven active fraternities on campus: [[Phi Kappa Tau]], [[Phi Kappa Psi]], [[Kappa Sigma]], [[Phi Mu Alpha]], Ulster (local), M.A.C.E. (local), and Stag (local). Phi Kappa Tau and Kappa Sigma started as local organizations (Alban and Sphinx respectively) while other national organizations came on as colonies. The University also has five sororities: Chi Alpha Nu (local), FAD (local), Delta Gamma Theta (local), [[Theta Phi Alpha]], and [[Alpha Sigma Alpha]].

==Athletics==
Muskingum competes athletically in the [[NCAA]] as a Division III school and as one of the first and longest affiliated members of the [[Ohio Athletic Conference]] (OAC). M.U.'s teams compete under the name the ''Fighting Muskies''. Its mascot is the Fighting Muskie (''[[muskellunge]]''), the largest member of the pike family.

Rather than using the traditional magenta, Muskies athletics wear black and red. The school's main athletic rival is fellow OAC competitor the [[Marietta College]] Pioneers (which ironically was originally called the Muskingum Academy when established in 1797). Muskingum fields teams in [[American football]], women's [[volleyball]], [[baseball]], women's [[softball]], [[collegiate wrestling|wrestling]] and men's and women's indoor [[Track and field|track]], outdoor track, [[soccer]], [[tennis]], [[Cross country running|cross country]], lacrosse, and [[golf]].
Muskingum has won 79 [[Ohio Athletic Conference]] (OAC) Championships, since the school joined the conference in 1923.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

During the period between 1925–1970 Muskingum was in the OAC, led by [[College Football Hall of Fame]] member [[Ed Sherman]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{College Football HoF/url|id=1817}}|title=Ed Sherman|publisher=College Football Hall of Fame|website=www.footballfoundation.org|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; first as a player and then as head coach. The Muskies also represented the OAC in the [[Grantland Rice Bowl]] in 1964&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/112940999/?terms=grantland |title=MTSC Wins 1st Rice Bowl Before 4,000 |first=Tom |last=Powell |url-access=subscription |newspaper=[[The Tennessean]] |location=[[Nashville, Tennessee]] |via=newspapers.com |date=December 13, 1964 |accessdate=January 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1966,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/113235731/?terms=grantland |title=A&amp;I Rolls 34-7 |first=Tom |last=Powell |url-access=subscription |newspaper=[[The Nashville Tennessean]] |location=[[Nashville, Tennessee]] |via=newspapers.com |date=December 11, 1966 |accessdate=February 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and won 12 OAC football championships during that forty-five year period.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Alumni==

Collectively, Muskingum's alumni are referred to as the "Long Magenta Line".  Muskingum College's favorite son is former [[astronaut]] and U.S. senator [[John Glenn]], who graduated with a [[Bachelor of Science]] in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/about/bios/glennbio.html|title=Biography - John H. Glenn|last=DeFelice|first=David|date=2015-04-03|language=en|access-date=2016-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glenn also has an honorary degree from Muskingum from 1961, but the B.S. is an earned degree. John Glenn announced his retirement from the [[United States Senate]] in Brown Chapel on live national television in 1997. Upon his retirement, Glenn donated his archives to the [[Ohio State University]], with special conditions that Muskingum students would benefit from the collection at any time.  Muskingum received national media attention once again in 1998, when the 77-year-old Glenn returned to space aboard the [[Space Shuttle Discovery]], becoming the oldest person ever in space.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

'''Nationalism studies''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] academic field devoted to the study of [[nationalism]] and related issues.  While nationalism has been the subject of scholarly discussion since at least the late eighteenth century, it is only since the early 1990s that it has received enough attention for a distinct field to emerge.&lt;ref name="Özkirimli 2000p15"&gt;{{cite book|last=Özkirimli|first=Umut|title=Theories of Nationalism: A Critical Introduction|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=2000|pages=15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lG09IwAACAAJ|isbn=0-333-77711-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors such as [[Eric Hobsbawm]], [[Carlton J. H. Hayes]], [[Hans Kohn]], [[Elie Kedourie]], [[John Hutchinson (academic)|John Hutchinson]], [[Ernest Gellner]], [[Karl Deutsch]], [[Walker Connor]], [[Anthony D. Smith]], and [[Benedict Anderson]] laid the foundation for nationalism studies in the post-war period.  In the early 1990s their ideas were enthusiastically taken up by academics, journalists, and others looking to understand and explain the apparent resurgence of nationalism marked by events such as the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], the [[Rwanda genocide]], and the [[Yugoslav Wars]].

==History of the field==

The development of the field can be divided into four stages: (I) the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, when nationalism first emerged, and most interest in it was philosophical; (II) the period from the [[First World War]] until the end of the [[Second World War|Second]], when nationalism became a subject of formal academic inquiry; (III) the post-war period from 1945 to the late 1980s, when several [[sociology|sociologists]] and [[political science|political scientists]] developed general theories of nationalism in the context of worldwide [[decolonisation]] and the 'ethnic revival' in the [[Western world|West]]; and (IV) the period following the [[fall of communism]] in 1989, which led to a surge of interest in nationalism and the crystallisation of nationalism studies as a field.&lt;ref name="Özkirimli 2000p15"/&gt;

===Eighteenth and nineteenth centuries===
"Up to the First World War," [[Umut Özkirimli]] explains, "interest in nationalism was largely [[ethical]] and [[philosophical]]. The scholars of this period, predominantly historians and social philosophers, were more concerned with the 'merits and defects' of the [[doctrine]] than with the origins and spread of national phenomena."&lt;ref name="Özkirimli 2000p12"&gt;{{cite book|last=Özkirimli|first=Umut|title=Theories of Nationalism: A Critical Introduction|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=2000|pages=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lG09IwAACAAJ|isbn=0-333-77711-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[nation-state]] was seen as a progressive stage in the historical development of human societies, and both [[Liberalism|liberals]] and [[Marxists]] expected that nationalism would eventually give way to a [[cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] world order. In this context, nations and nationalism were taken for granted, and most authors who discussed them were motivated by some political concern. There were no attempts to fashion a general theory of nationalism that was applicable to all cases.&lt;ref name="Özkirimli 2000p12-13"&gt;{{cite book|last=Özkirimli|first=Umut|title=Theories of Nationalism: A Critical Introduction|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=2000|pages=12–13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lG09IwAACAAJ|isbn=0-333-77711-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the important authors in this period include: [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès]], [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Giuseppe Mazzini]], [[Ernest Renan]], and [[John Stuart Mill]].

==Nationalism studies as an academic field==

Several universities organize degree and non-degree courses on nationalism. Boston University, University of London (particularly the [[London School of Economics]]), Central European University (Hungary), and University of Edinburgh are among the most prominent institutions where the study of nationalism occupies a central place. The Faculty of Humanities of [[Eötvös Loránd University]] (Hungary) has recently launched a comprehensive short-term program, dedicated exclusively to the study of nationalism.

== The future of the field ==
Authors such as Michal Luczewski and Ruhtan Yalçıne believe that the field is becoming increasingly difficult to study. According to Michal Luczewski, researchers have been talking past each other for decades and there has not been valuable knowledge produced for around 50 years&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iwm.at/publications/5-junior-visiting-fellows-conferences/vol-xviii/michal-luczewski/|title=What Remains for Nationalism Studies?|last=Luczewski|first=Michal|date=|website=Institute for Human Sciences|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Since this time, the field has been stuck between contemporary scientific facts and common-sense theories. Answers to the basic questions of nationalism (What is the Nation? Why does the Nation exist?) have been answered countless times over leaving a swath of contradictory theories and a lack of consensus. The question remains whether it is even possible to construct a universal theory of nationalism. Theories previously proposed are often detached from reality, given the diverse ways in which identities form in different groups around the world&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yalçıner|first=Ruhtan|date=2010-03-01|title=Political Philosophy and Nationalism|url=http://internationalstudies.oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190846626.001.0001/acrefore-9780190846626-e-276?rskey=YgklCh&amp;result=1|language=en|doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780190846626.001.0001/acrefore-9780190846626-e-276}}&lt;/ref&gt; .

In order to solve for this problem Michal Luczewski recommends that scholars employ greater awareness in addressing the essential questions of nationalism studies. Scholars should produce extensive work dealing “with national phenomena in all their varieties, integrating emotions, cognitions, both the subjective and objective dimensions into one picture.” It is essential for scholars to ignore subjective experience and deal directly with reality. This can be accomplished by utilizing empirical evidence. Luczewski also recommends starting small, “consecutively from the micro level through more and more general steps to the macro one.”

==Journals==

One of the earliest journals devoted to the study of nationalism was the ''[[Canadian Review of Studies in Nationalism]]'', founded at the [[University of Prince Edward Island]] by [[Thomas Spira]] in 1973. The journal "[[Nationalities Papers]]" was founded in 1971. Journals in the field include the following:

*''[[Ethnicities (journal)|Ethnicities]]''
*''[[Ethnopolitics]]''
*''[[Ethnic and Racial Studies]]''

'''Pollutant-induced abnormal behaviour''' refers to the [[abnormal behaviour]] induced by [[pollutant]]s. Chemicals released into the natural environment by humans impact the behaviour of a wide variety of animals. The main culprits are [[Endocrine disruptor|endocrine-disrupting chemicals]] (EDCs), which mimic, block, or interfere with animal hormones. A new research field, integrative behavioural ecotoxicology, is emerging.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peterson|first=Elizabeth K.|last2=Buchwalter|first2=David B.|last3=Kerby|first3=Jacob L.|last4=LeFauve|first4=Matthew K.|last5=Varian-Ramos|first5=Claire W.|last6=Swaddle|first6=John P.|date=2017-04-01|title=Integrative behavioral ecotoxicology: bringing together fields to establish new insight to behavioral ecology, toxicology, and conservation|url=https://doi.org/10.1093/cz/zox010|journal=Current Zoology|language=en|volume=63|issue=2|pages=185–194|doi=10.1093/cz/zox010|issn=1674-5507}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, chemical pollutants are not the only anthropogenic offenders. Noise and light pollution also induce abnormal behaviour. 

This topic is of special concern for its conservation and human health implications and has been studied greatly by animal behaviourists, environmental toxicologists, and conservation scientists. Behaviours serve as potential indicators for ecological health. Behaviour can be more sensitive to EDCs than developmental and physiological traits, and it was the behaviour of eagles that first drew attention to the now well-known dangers of DDT.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zala|first=Sarah M.|last2=Penn|first2=Dustin J.|date=2004|title=Abnormal behaviours induced by chemical pollution: a review of the evidence and new challenges|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0003347204001782|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=68|issue=4|pages=649–664|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2004.01.005|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, behaviour is generally difficult to measure and can be highly variable.

Behaviours which are critical for survival, such as reproductive and social behaviours, and cognitive abilities like learning can be affected directly or indirectly by chemical pollutants— many examples have been documented, and their chemical culprits have been identified. These same behaviours can also be altered by anthropogenic noise and light, although their mechanisms are relatively unknown.

== EDCs known to alter behaviour&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ==
* [[Atrazine]] (pesticide)
* [[Bisphenol A]]
* [[Carbaryl]]
* [[Cypermethrin]]
* [[DDT]]
* [[Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate|DEHP]]
* [[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|Dioxin]]
* [[Endosulfan]]
* [[Fenarimol]]
* [[Fenitrothion]]
* [[Kepone]]
* [[Lead]]
* [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]]
* [[Methoxychlor]]
* [[Nonylphenol]]
* [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]]
* [[Vinclozolin]]
* [[Trenbolone|17β-trenbolone]] (agricultural pollutant)

Determining the link between such pollutants and altered behaviours often requires both field studies and laboratory studies. Field studies are useful in determining whether behavioural changes appear with pollution levels occurring in the environment, while laboratory studies can be used to clarify the mechanisms connecting an environmental pollutant to specific behavioural changes.

== Mechanisms&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ==
EDCs affect the synthesis, storage, release, transport, clearance, receptor recognition, binding, or post-receptor responses of hormones. This results in either stimulative or inhibitive effects, resulting in overproduction or underproduction of hormones. The effects of hormones on behaviour have been well studied, and often produce direct behavioural effects by acting on the central nervous system. Indirectly, behaviours may be altered by hormones influencing an animal's metabolism or other important processes.

Since behaviours also influence hormones, chemical pollutants that induce behavioural changes may also affect hormone levels, which could result in more behavioural or other changes.

== Applying Tinbergen’s four questions&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; ==

Studies into the mechanisms underlying behavioural adjustments fall into a category of animal behaviour research described by Tinbergen.

Studies of animal behaviour typically pertain to one of [[Tinbergen's four questions|Tinbergen’s four questions]], and these can be applied to studies regarding chemical pollution. Questions of causation focus on how pollutant-exposure disrupts the mechanisms behind normal behaviour. For example, when differences in sexual behaviours were noted in wildlife after the introduction of DDT, biochemical experiments on rats were able to show that the pollutant was inhibiting androgen binding to androgen receptors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scott|first=Graham R|last2=Sloman|first2=Katherine A|date=2004|title=The effects of environmental pollutants on complex fish behaviour: integrating behavioural and physiological indicators of toxicity|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0166445X0400102X|journal=Aquatic Toxicology|volume=68|issue=4|pages=369–392|doi=10.1016/j.aquatox.2004.03.016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Secondly, questions of ontogeny consider how exposure disrupts the development of behaviours. An example is when researchers examined the effects of an aerosol on the spatial learning of mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Win-Shwe|first=Tin-Tin|last2=Kyi-Tha-Thu|first2=Chaw|last3=Moe|first3=Yadanar|last4=Maekawa|first4=Fumihiko|last5=Yanagisawa|first5=Rie|last6=Furuyama|first6=Akiko|last7=Tsukahara|first7=Shinji|last8=Fujitani|first8=Yuji|last9=Hirano|first9=Seishiro|date=2015-06-30|title=Nano-Sized Secondary Organic Aerosol of Diesel Engine Exhaust Origin Impairs Olfactory-Based Spatial Learning Performance in Preweaning Mice|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2079-4991/5/3/1147|journal=Nanomaterials|language=en|volume=5|issue=3|pages=1147–1162|doi=10.3390/nano5031147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirdly, questions of adaptation consider how behavioural modifications resulting from exposure will influence fitness. Scientists have investigated the reproductive success of white ibises exposed to Methylmercury, for instance.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Lastly, questions of phylogeny consider how phylogenetic history might predetermine sensitivity or resistance to pollutants in a particular behaviour. This could include investigating how animals that are better at learning might be better at avoiding toxins in the environment.

== Effects on reproductive behaviours ==

Reproductive behaviour effects may involve changes in courtship and mating behaviours, mate choice, or changes in nest building.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Most studies on this topic have been conducted on fish and birds. For example, treating adult male zebra fish with biphenol A for 7 weeks resulted in decreased courtship behaviour of females.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gore|first=Andrea C.|last2=Holley|first2=Amanda M.|last3=Crews|first3=David|date=2017|title=Mate choice, sexual selection, and endocrine-disrupting chemicals|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yhbeh.2017.09.001|journal=Hormones and Behavior|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2017.09.001|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 17β-trenbolone exposure in adult guppies and mosquitofish also altered female mate selection, as they preferred unexposed males.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Guppies treated with atrazine during breeding and through gestation were less likely to engage in and showed fewer numbers of courtship displays and other reproductive behaviours. Additionally, females preferred untreated males.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

Studies on birds show significant effects of EDCs on mating songs and displays. For example, treating female zebra finches with PCBs before egg laying resulted in a size reduction in the song centres of the chick’s brains.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Methylmercury exposure at environmental levels for 3 years in male white ibises resulted in increased homosexual behaviour, decreased rates of key courtship behaviours, and less attractiveness to females.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frederick|first=Peter|last2=Jayasena|first2=Nilmini|date=2011-06-22|title=Altered pairing behaviour and reproductive success in white ibises exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of methylmercury|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/278/1713/1851|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|language=en|volume=278|issue=1713|pages=1851–1857|doi=10.1098/rspb.2010.2189|issn=0962-8452|pmid=21123262|pmc=3097836}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mammals are also susceptible, and effects on individuals have been shown to have transgenerational and even population-level consequences. Illustrating this, female rats three generations removed from vinclozolin exposure show changes in mate preference, preferring unexposed mates, while male rats do not, and this could have complex effects on the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crews|first=D.|last2=Gore|first2=A. C.|last3=Hsu|first3=T. S.|last4=Dangleben|first4=N. L.|last5=Spinetta|first5=M.|last6=Schallert|first6=T.|last7=Anway|first7=M. D.|last8=Skinner|first8=M. K.|date=2007|title=Transgenerational epigenetic imprints on mate preference|url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/do%20I/10.1073/pnas.0610410104|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=104|issue=14|pages=5942–5946|doi=10.1073/pnas.0610410104|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conservation implications ==
Chemical-induced changes in animal behaviour often have consequences for wild populations. The effects of concern aren’t limited to reproductive effects, which have obvious implications for population vitality. For example, frogs exposed to pesticide-levels found in the environment demonstrate hyperactivity, whip-like convulsions, and depressed avoidance behaviour, which may increase their vulnerability to predation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

As well, guppies from crude oil-polluted environments are less exploratory after both short-term and long-term exposure. This may weaken their foraging efficiency and resource-use diversity, thus posing a threat to the population viability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jacquin|first=L.|last2=Dybwad|first2=C.|last3=Rolshausen|first3=G.|last4=Hendry|first4=A. P.|last5=Reader|first5=S. M.|date=2017-01-01|title=Evolutionary and immediate effects of crude-oil pollution: depression of exploratory behaviour across populations of Trinidadian guppies|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10071-016-1027-9|journal=Animal Cognition|language=en|volume=20|issue=1|pages=97–108|doi=10.1007/s10071-016-1027-9|issn=1435-9448}}&lt;/ref&gt; This topic is therefore quite important for understanding how human-impacts on the environment may threaten populations. Additionally, if abnormal behaviours can be used as indicators of toxic pollution, then this provides a much more accessible mode of toxicology science. Therefore, there is potential for engaging [[Citizen science|citizen scientists]] in environmental research.

== Noise and light pollution ==
[[Pollutant|Pollutants]] are not always chemicals. They can be other unnatural stimuli introduced to the environment by humans, such as noise and light pollution. Anthropogenic noise and light can result in altered antipredator behaviour, reproductive behaviour, communication, foraging behaviour, population distribution, male-male competition and more. However, the mechanisms behind these altered behaviours is relatively unknown within the literature.

=== Noise pollution ===

===== Birds =====
[[File:White-crowned-Sparrow.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:White-crowned-Sparrow.jpg|thumb|Male white-crowned sparrows approach intruders more closely when exposed to noise pollution]]
Noise pollution is widespread, which is mostly a result of transportation networks&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barber|first=Jesse R.|last2=Crooks|first2=Kevin R.|last3=Fristrup|first3=Kurt M.|date=March 2010|title=The costs of chronic noise exposure for terrestrial organisms|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0169534709002614|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=25|issue=3|pages=180–189|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2009.08.002|issn=0169-5347}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Although there are many effects of noise pollution, two specific consequences are adjustments in population distribution and modified animal communication. Birds provide a clear example of both of these consequences. Altered population distributions can affect inter-species interactions. For example, the diversity of birds in the woodlands of New Mexico was significantly reduced in areas with unnatural noise levels&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Francis|first=Clinton D.|last2=Ortega|first2=Catherine P.|last3=Cruz|first3=Alexander|date=August 2009|title=Noise Pollution Changes Avian Communities and Species Interactions|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960982209013281|journal=Current Biology|volume=19|issue=16|pages=1415–1419|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2009.06.052|issn=0960-9822}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This change in diversity resulted in less nest predation, which was explained by the decreased presence of the dominant predator - the scrub-jay. This effect has also been observed in owls. A negative correlation was found between the noise intensity of an area and the probability that a long-eared owl will reside in that region&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fröhlich|first=Arkadiusz|last2=Ciach|first2=Michał|date=2017-10-31|title=Noise shapes the distribution pattern of an acoustic predator|url=https://academic.oup.com/cz/article/64/5/575/4582952|journal=Current Zoology|language=en|volume=64|issue=5|pages=575–583|doi=10.1093/cz/zox061|issn=1674-5507|pmc=6178792|pmid=30323836}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Suggested explanations for this outcome are that hunting efficiency was diminished and communication was less effective.

Noise pollution also affects conspecific communication. High noise levels may require animals to adjust their vocalizations in order for communication to remain effective. Bird songs are a well-studied component of animal communication. The use of adjusted songs was observed in Savannah sparrows residing in noisy environments&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Curry|first=Claire M.|last2=Des Brisay|first2=Paulson G.|last3=Rosa|first3=Patricia|last4=Koper|first4=Nicola|date=2018-03-02|title=Noise Source and Individual Physiology Mediate Effectiveness of Bird Songs Adjusted to Anthropogenic Noise|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22253-5|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=8|issue=1|doi=10.1038/s41598-018-22253-5|issn=2045-2322|pmc=5834586|pmid=29500452}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Adjusted songs were so distinct that their use in the control environment did not result in responses (i.e. aggressive territorial behaviour) typically observed when non-adjusted songs were vocalized. Failure to recognize conspecific vocalizations can also be detrimental to male-male competition. Male urban white-crowned sparrows approached stimulus songs of intruders more closely, regardless of song type, when in the presence of noise pollution&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phillips|first=Jennifer N.|last2=Derryberry|first2=Elizabeth P.|date=2018-05-14|title=Urban sparrows respond to a sexually selected trait with increased aggression in noise|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25834-6|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=8|issue=1|doi=10.1038/s41598-018-25834-6|issn=2045-2322|pmc=5951809|pmid=29760398}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A higher frequency of harmful fights is a suggested consequence of this behaviour because of the relatively small distance between the intruding and defending males.

==== Marine animals ====
Noise pollution can also affect marine animals. There are many sources of noise in the world's oceans, such as the sounds produced by commercial shipping, sonars and acoustic deterrents&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Marine Mammals and Noise: A Sound Approach to Research and Management|last=|first=|date=2007|work=|access-date=|publisher=Marine Mammal Commission|type=Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Unnatural noise levels can negatively affect reproductive behaviour, such as courtship behaviours. For example, painted goby males did not take part in visual courtship behaviour when in a noisy environment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Jong|first=Karen|last2=Amorim|first2=M. Clara P.|last3=Fonseca|first3=Paulo J.|last4=Fox|first4=Clive J.|last5=Heubel|first5=Katja U.|date=June 2018|title=Noise can affect acoustic communication and subsequent spawning success in fish|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0269749117326064|journal=Environmental Pollution|volume=237|pages=814–823|doi=10.1016/j.envpol.2017.11.003|issn=0269-7491}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Female painted gobies in this experiment were also less likely to spawn in a noisy environment. Noise pollution can also affect foraging behaviour in marine animals, which results in less effective strategies. Porpoises have been found to make fewer prey capture attempts, dive deeper, and cut their foraging behaviour short when a vessel passes by, which results in a higher energy expenditure&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wisniewska|first=Danuta Maria|last2=Johnson|first2=Mark|last3=Teilmann|first3=Jonas|last4=Siebert|first4=Ursula|last5=Galatius|first5=Anders|last6=Dietz|first6=Rune|last7=Madsen|first7=Peter Teglberg|date=2018-02-14|title=High rates of vessel noise disrupt foraging in wild harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena)|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/285/1872/20172314|journal=Proc.

Shore crabs were also observed interrupting their foraging behaviour when in the presence of ship noise&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wale|first=Matthew A.|last2=Simpson|first2=Stephen D.|last3=Radford|first3=Andrew N.|date=July 2013|title=Noise negatively affects foraging and antipredator behaviour in shore crabs|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0003347213001991|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=86|issue=1|pages=111–118|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.05.001|issn=0003-3472}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Antipredator behaviour in marine animals has also been known to change when noise levels are high. Shore crabs took longer to return to their shelters when in the presence of ship noise&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;. ''Neolamprologus pulcher'' (a cichlid fish) females defended their nest less against predators when boat noise was present&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bruintjes|first=Rick|last2=Radford|first2=Andrew N.|date=June 2013|title=Context-dependent impacts of anthropogenic noise on individual and social behaviour in a cooperatively breeding fish|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0003347213001462|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=85|issue=6|pages=1343–1349|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.03.025|issn=0003-3472}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== Recommendations for marine animals ====
Specific mitigation strategies and recommendations have been presented by the Marine Mammal Commission (2007). They offer multiple ways to alleviate noise pollution in the ocean. Some strategies include removing the source of noise, employing sound attenuation devices, limiting the use of the sound source and monitoring operational requirements. They recommend improving research programs, creating consistent regulation standards that are better enforced and improving mitigation strategies.

=== Light pollution ===
Light pollution affects multiple aspects of animal behaviour, such as reproductive behaviour, foraging behaviour and antipredator behaviour. Altered reproductive behaviour has been observed in multiple taxa. Female crickets were less captious of males when they were raised in bright artificial light&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Botha|first=L. Michael|last2=Jones|first2=Therésa M.|last3=Hopkins|first3=Gareth R.|date=July 2017|title=Effects of lifetime exposure to artificial light at night on cricket (Teleogryllus commodus) courtship and mating behaviour|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0003347217301574|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=129|pages=181–188|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2017.05.020|issn=0003-3472}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Male crickets that were raised under continuous artificial light were discriminated against more than male crickets raised in darkness or moonlight. Female fireflies also altered their reproductive behaviour by failing to flash when placed under artificial light and males never flashed in response to these females&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Firebaugh|first=Ariel|last2=Haynes|first2=Kyle J.|date=August 2018|title=Light pollution may create demographic traps for nocturnal insects|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S143917911830063X|journal=Basic and Applied Ecology|doi=10.1016/j.baae.2018.07.005|issn=1439-1791}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, it is not only insects that are affected by light pollution. Male green frogs made less calls and moved more often when in the presence of artificial light&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baker|first=B.J.|last2=Richardson|first2=J.M.L.|date=October 2006|title=The effect of artificial light on male breeding-season behaviour in green frogs, Rana clamitans melanota|url=https://www.nrcresearchpress.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nrcresearchpress.com%2Fdoi%2F10.1139%2Fz06-142|journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology|volume=84|issue=10|pages=1528–1532|doi=10.1139/z06-142|issn=0008-4301}}&lt;/ref&gt;. According to Baker and Richardson (2006), these behavioural changes negatively affect breeding success.
[[File:Bats flying (9413217529).jpg|thumb|Bats miss optimal foraging time when exposed to light pollution.]]
Another consequence of light pollution is the disruption of foraging behaviour in wildlife, such as where and when they forage or hunt. Beach mice used foraging patches near sodium vapor lights or yellow bug lights less often than non-lit patches and they also harvested fewer seeds from these lit patches&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bird|first=Brittany L.|last2=Branch|first2=Lyn C.|last3=Miller|first3=Deborah L.|date=2004|title=Effects of Coastal Lighting on Foraging Behavior of Beach Mice|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3589011|journal=Conservation Biology|volume=18|pages=1435-1439|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This study also hypothesizes that artificial light may alter the movement of mice because of predation risks. Bats are another animal that are greatly affected by light pollution. The presence of artificial lights is associated with a delayed emergence of bats from their dwellings and less time spent emerged&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boldogh|first=Sándor|last2=Dobrosi|first2=Dénes|last3=Samu|first3=Péter|date=December 2007|title=The effects of the illumination of buildings on house-dwelling bats and its conservation consequences|url=https://www.bioone.org/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bioone.org%2Fdoi%2Fabs%2F10.3161%2F1733-5329%25282007%25299%255B527%253ATEOTIO%255D2.0.CO%253B2|journal=Acta Chiropterologica|language=en-US|volume=9|issue=2|pages=527–534|doi=10.3161/1733-5329(2007)9[527:teotio]2.0.co;2|issn=1508-1109}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This alteration in foraging behaviour causes bats to miss the most optimal hunting time for insects&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;. According to this study, as little as one hour of artificial light exposure after dusk disrupts the bats foraging behaviour, as well as growth rates.

Light pollution can also alter antipredator behaviour in wildlife. When moths come within a close proximity of a hunting bat, they make a powerdive towards the ground&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roeder|first=Kenneth D.|last2=Treat|first2=Asher E.|date=1961|title=The detection and evasion of bats by moths|url=|journal=American Scientist|volume=49|pages=135-148|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Roeder &amp; Treat, 1961). If moths are in the presence of artificial light, they are less likely to make this powerdive manoeuver, which results in a reduced ability to evade bat predation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wakefield|first=Andrew|last2=Stone|first2=Emma L.|last3=Jones|first3=Gareth|last4=Harris|first4=Stephen|date=2015-08-01|title=Light-emitting diode street lights reduce last-ditch evasive manoeuvres by moths to bat echolocation calls|url=http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/2/8/150291|journal=Open Science|language=en|volume=2|issue=8|pages=150291|doi=10.1098/rsos.150291|issn=2054-5703|pmc=4555863|pmid=26361558}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A suggested explanation for this behaviour, according to this study, is that moths turn their ultrasound detection off in daylight (or simulated daylight). Predator-prey interactions are also altered by noise pollution. An example of this is in loggerhead turtles and ghost crabs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Silva|first=Elton|last2=Marco|first2=Adolfo|last3=da Graça|first3=Jesemine|last4=Pérez|first4=Héctor|last5=Abella|first5=Elena|last6=Patino-Martinez|first6=Juan|last7=Martins|first7=Samir|last8=Almeida|first8=Corrine|date=August 2017|title=Light pollution affects nesting behavior of loggerhead turtles and predation risk of nests and hatchlings|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1011134417302543|journal=Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology B: Biology|volume=173|pages=240–249|doi=10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2017.06.006|issn=1011-1344}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Ghost crabs are attracted to artificial lights and begin to exhibit more aggressive predatory behaviour in the presence of the light. This study hypothesizes that loggerhead hatchling predation would also increase as a result of this modified predatory behaviour and the predator-prey relationship would, therefore, be altered.

[[File:Surveillance cameras.jpg|thumb|right|Privacy may be lessened by [[surveillance]] – in this case through [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]].]]
'''Privacy''' is the ability of an individual or group to seclude themselves, or information about themselves, and thereby express themselves selectively. The boundaries and content of what is considered private differ among cultures and individuals, but share common themes. When something is private to a ''person'', it usually means that something is inherently special or sensitive to them. The domain of privacy partially overlaps with [[security]] (confidentiality), which can include the concepts of appropriate use, as well as protection of information. Privacy may also take the form of [[bodily integrity]].&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Herring, ''Medical Law and Ethics'', Oxford University Press, 2016, p. 483.&lt;/ref&gt;

The right not to be subjected to unsanctioned invasion of privacy by the [[government]], [[corporation]]s or [[individual]]s is part of many countries' [[#Privacy law|privacy laws]], and in some cases, [[constitution]]s. All countries have laws which in some way limit privacy. An example of this would be law concerning [[taxation]], which normally requires the sharing of information about personal [[income]] or [[earnings]]. In some countries individual privacy may conflict with [[freedom of speech]] laws and some laws may require public disclosure of information which would be considered private in other countries and cultures. This was a major concern in the United States, with the Supreme Court passage of [[Citizens United]].{{fact|date=July 2018}}

Privacy may be [[Communication privacy management theory|voluntarily sacrificed]], normally in exchange for perceived benefits and very often with specific dangers and losses, although this is a very strategic view of human relationships. For example, people may be ready to reveal their name, if that allows them to promote trust by others and thus build meaningful social relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gaudeul|first=Alexia|last2=Giannetti|first2=Caterina|title=The effect of privacy concerns on social network formation|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167268117301853|journal=Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization|volume=141|pages=233–253|doi=10.1016/j.jebo.2017.07.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that people are more willing to voluntarily sacrifice privacy if the data gatherer is seen to be transparent as to what information is gathered and how it is used.&lt;ref name="transparency"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oulasvirta |first=Antti |last2=Suomalainen |first2=Tiia |last3=Hamari |first3=Juho |last4=Lampinen |first4=Airi |last5=Karvonen |first5=Kristiina |date=2014 |title=Transparency of Intentions Decreases Privacy Concerns in Ubiquitous Surveillance |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264638054_Transparency_of_Intentions_Decreases_Privacy_Concerns_in_Ubiquitous_Surveillance |journal=Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking |volume=17 |issue=10 |pages=633–38 |doi=10.1089/cyber.2013.0585}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the business world, a person may volunteer personal details (often for [[advertising]] purposes) in order to gamble on winning a prize. A person may also disclose personal information as part of being an executive for a publicly traded company in the USA pursuant to federal securities law.&lt;ref&gt;Undressing the CEO: Disclosing Private, Material Matters of Public Company Executives, 11 Penn. Journal of Bus. Law 383 (2009), available at:http://ssrn.com/abstract=2040940&lt;/ref&gt; Personal information which is voluntarily shared but subsequently stolen or misused can lead to [[identity theft]].

The concept of universal individual privacy is a modern construct primarily associated with [[Western culture]], British and North American in particular, and remained virtually unknown in some cultures until recent times. According to some researchers, this concept sets [[United Kingdom–United States relations|Anglo-American]] culture apart even from Western European cultures such as French or Italian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zemskaya|first=E. A.|title=Особенности русской речи эмигрантов четвертой волны (Features of the Russian language of fourth wave immigrants)|url=http://www.gramota.ru/biblio/magazines/gramota/28_520|publisher=Gramota.ru|accessdate=24 February 2009|language=Russian|date=9 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most cultures, however, recognize the ability of individuals to withhold certain parts of their personal information from wider society—closing the door to one's home, for example.

The distinction or overlap between [[secrecy]] and privacy is [[ontology|ontologically]] subtle, which is why the word "privacy" is an example of an [[Untranslatability|untranslatable]] [[lexeme]],&lt;ref name="TranslationToday"/&gt; and many languages do not have a specific word for "privacy". Such languages either use a complex description to translate the term (such as Russian combining the meaning of ''уединение''—solitude, ''секретность''—secrecy, and ''частная жизнь''—private life) or borrow from English "privacy" (as [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] ''privasi'' or [[Italian language|Italian]] ''la privacy'').&lt;ref name="TranslationToday"&gt;{{cite book|title=Translation Today: Trends and Perspectives |last=Anderman |first=Gunilla M. |author2=Rogers, Margaret |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hJxVffwZEDgC&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;pg=PA73#v=onepage&amp;q=privacy&amp;f=false |publisher=Multilingual Matters |year=2003 |accessdate=1 January 2012|isbn=9781853596186 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction hinges on the discreteness of [[wikt:interest#Noun|interests]] of parties (persons or groups), which can have [[emic and etic|emic]] variation depending on cultural mores of [[individualism]], [[collectivism]], and the negotiation between [[individual and group rights]]. The difference is sometimes expressed humorously as, "when ''I'' withhold information, it is privacy; when ''you'' withhold information, it is secrecy."

==Concepts==
A broad multicultural literary tradition going to the beginnings of recorded history discusses the concept of privacy.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=12–13}} One way of categorizing all concepts of privacy is by considering all discussions as one of these concepts:{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=12–13}}

# the right to be let alone
# the option to limit the access others have to one's personal information
# [[secrecy]], or the option to conceal any information from others
# control over others' use of information about oneself
# states of privacy
# [[personhood]] and autonomy
# self-identity and personal growth
# protection of [[intimate relationships]]

===Right to be let alone===
In 1890 the United States [[jurists]] [[Samuel D. Warren]] and [[Louis Brandeis]] wrote ''[[The Right to Privacy (article)|The Right to Privacy]]'', an article in which they argued for the "right to be let alone", using that phrase as a definition of privacy.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=15–17}} There is extensive commentary over the meaning of being "let alone", and among other ways, it has been interpreted to mean the right of a person to choose [[seclusion]] from the attention of others if they wish to do so, and the right to be immune from scrutiny or being observed in private settings, such as one’s own home.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=15–17}} Although this early vague legal concept did not describe privacy in a way that made it easy to design broad legal protections of privacy, it strengthened the notion of privacy rights for individuals and began a legacy of discussion on those rights.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=15–17}}

===Limited access===
Limited access refers to a person’s ability to participate in society without having other individuals and organizations collect information about them.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=19}}

Various theorists have imagined privacy as a system for limiting access to one’s personal information.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=19}} [[Edwin Lawrence Godkin]] wrote in the late 19th century that "nothing is better worthy of legal protection than private life, or, in other words, the right of every man to keep his affairs to himself, and to decide for himself to what extent they shall be the subject of public observation and discussion."{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=19}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Godkin|first1=E.L.|authorlink1=Edwin Lawrence Godkin|title=Libel and its Legal Remedy|journal=[[Atlantic Monthly]]|date=December 1880|volume=46|issue=278|pages=729–39|url=http://digital.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=atla;cc=atla;rgn=full%20text;idno=atla0046-6;didno=atla0046-6;view=image;seq=0735;node=atla0046-6%3A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adopting an approach similar to the one presented by Ruth Gavison&lt;ref name="transparency" /&gt; 9 years earlier,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gavison|first1=Ruth|authorlink1=Ruth Gavison|title=Privacy and the Limits of Law|journal=Yale Law Journal|date=1980|pages=421–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sissela Bok]] said that privacy is "the condition of being protected from unwanted access by others—either physical access, personal information, or attention."{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=19}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bok|first1=Sissela|authorlink1=Sissela Bok|title=Secrets : on the ethics of concealment and revelation|date=1989|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0679724735|pages=10–11|edition=Vintage Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Control over information===
Control over one's personal information is the concept that "privacy is the claim of individuals, groups, or institutions to determine for themselves when, how, and to what extent information about them is communicated to others."{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=24}}&lt;ref&gt;The quotation is from Alan Westin.{{cite book|last1=Westin|first1=Alan F.|last2=Blom-Cooper|first2=Louis|authorlink1=Alan Westin|authorlink2=Louis Blom-Cooper|title=Privacy and freedom|date=1970|publisher=Bodley Head|location=London|isbn=978-0370013251|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Fried]] said that "Privacy is not simply an absence of information about us in the minds of others; rather it is the control we have over information about ourselves. Nevertheless, in the era of [[big data]], control over information is under pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/handle/1887/46935|title=Predicting Data that People Refuse to Disclose; How Data Mining Predictions Challenge Informational Self-Determination|last=B.H.M.|first=Custers,|last2=Metajuridica|first2=Instituut voor|website=openaccess.leidenuniv.nl|access-date=2017-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== States of privacy ===
Alan Westin defined four states—or experiences—of privacy: solitude, intimacy, anonymity, and reserve. Solitude is a physical separation from others.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Privacy and Freedom|last = Westin|first = Alan|publisher = Atheneum|year = 1967|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Intimacy is a "close, relaxed, and frank relationship between two or more individuals" that results from the seclusion of a pair or small group of individuals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Anonymity is the "desire of individuals for times of 'public privacy.'"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Lastly, reserve is the "creation of a psychological barrier against unwanted intrusion"; this creation of a psychological barrier requires others to respect an individual's need or desire to restrict communication of information concerning himself or herself.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In addition to the psychological barrier of reserve, Kirsty Hughes identified three more kinds of privacy barriers: physical, behavioral, and normative. Physical barriers, such as walls and doors, prevent others from accessing and experiencing the individual.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = A Behavioural Understanding of Privacy and Its Implications for Privacy Law|last = Hughes|first = Kirsty|date = 2012|journal = The Modern Law Review|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; (In this sense, "accessing" an individual includes accessing personal information about him or her.)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Behavioral barriers communicate to others—verbally, through language, or non-verbally, through personal space, body language, or clothing—that an individual does not want them to access or experience him or her.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Lastly, normative barriers, such as laws and social norms, restrain others from attempting to access or experience an individual.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Secrecy===
Privacy is sometimes defined as an option to have secrecy. Richard Posner said that privacy is the right of people to "conceal information about themselves that others might use to their disadvantage".{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=21}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Posner|first1=Richard A.|authorlink1=Richard Posner|title=The economics of justice|date=1983|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0674235267|page=271|edition=5. print}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In various legal contexts, when privacy is described as secrecy, a conclusion if privacy is secrecy then rights to privacy do not apply for any information which is already publicly disclosed.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=22–23}} When privacy-as-secrecy is discussed, it is usually imagined to be a selective kind of secrecy in which individuals keep some information secret and private while they choose to make other information public and not private.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=22–23}}

===Personhood and autonomy===
Privacy may be understood as a necessary precondition for the development and preservation of personhood. Jeffrey Reiman defined privacy in terms of a recognition of one's ownership of his or her physical and mental reality and a moral right to his or her self-determination.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Privacy, Intimacy, and Personhood|last = Reiman|first = Jeffrey|date = 1976|journal = Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the "social ritual" of privacy, or the social practice of respecting an individual's privacy barriers, the social group communicates to the developing child that he or she has exclusive moral rights to his or her body—in other words, he or she has moral ownership of his or her body.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This entails control over both active (physical) and cognitive appropriation, the former being control over one's movements and actions and the latter being control over who can experience one's physical existence and when.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Alternatively, Stanley Benn defined privacy in terms of a recognition of oneself as a subject with agency—as an individual with the capacity to choose.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Philosophical Dimensions of Privacy: An Anthology|last = Benn|first = Stanley|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = |isbn = |location = New York|pages = |editor-first = Ferdinand|chapter = Privacy, freedom, and respect for persons|editor-last = Schoeman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Privacy is required to exercise choice.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Overt observation makes the individual aware of himself or herself as an object with a "determinate character" and "limited probabilities."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Covert observation, on the other hand, changes the conditions in which the individual is exercising choice without his or her knowledge and consent.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In addition, privacy may be viewed as a state that enables autonomy, a concept closely connected to that of personhood. According to Joseph Kufer, an autonomous self-concept entails a conception of oneself as a "purposeful, self-determining, responsible agent" and an awareness of one's capacity to control the boundary between self and other—that is, to control who can access and experience him or her and to what extent.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Privacy, Autonomy, and Self-Concept|last = Kufer|first = Joseph|date = 1987|journal = American Philosophical Quarterly|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, others must acknowledge and respect the self's boundaries—in other words, they must respect the individual's privacy.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The studies of psychologists such as Jean Piaget and Victor Tausk show that, as children learn that they can control who can access and experience them and to what extent, they develop an autonomous self-concept.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In addition, studies of adults in particular institutions, such as Erving Goffman's study of "total institutions" such as prisons and mental institutions,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Asylums: Essays on the Social Situation of Mental Patients and Other Inmates|last = Goffman|first = Erving|publisher = Doubleday|year = 1968|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that systemic and routinized deprivations or violations of privacy deteriorate one's sense of autonomy over time.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Self-identity and personal growth ===
Privacy may be understood as a prerequisite for the development of a sense of self-identity. Privacy barriers, in particular, are instrumental in this process. According to Irwin Altman, such barriers "define and limit the boundaries of the self" and thus "serve to help define [the self]."&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Environment and Social Behavior: Privacy, Personal Space, Territory, and Crowding|last = Altman|first = Irwin|publisher = Brooks/Cole Publishing Company|year = 1975|isbn = |location = Monterey|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This control primarily entails the ability to regulate contact with others.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Control over the "permeability" of the self's boundaries enables one to control what constitutes the self and thus to define what is the self.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

In addition, privacy may be seen as a state that fosters personal growth, a process integral to the development of self-identity. Hyman Gross suggested that, without privacy—solitude, anonymity, and temporary releases from social roles—individuals would be unable to freely express themselves and to engage in self-discovery and self-criticism.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Such self-discovery and self-criticism contributes to one's understanding of oneself and shapes one's sense of identity.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===Intimacy===
In a way analogous to how the personhood theory imagines privacy as some essential part of being an individual, the intimacy theory imagines privacy to be an essential part of the way that humans have strengthened or [[intimate relationships]] with other humans.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=35}} Because part of human relationships includes individuals volunteering to self-disclose some information, but withholding other information, there is a concept of privacy as a part of the process by means of which humans establish relationships with each other.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=35}}

[[James Rachels]] advanced this notion by writing that privacy matters because "there is a close connection between our ability to control who has access to us and to information about us, and our ability to create and maintain different sorts of social relationships with different people."{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=35}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rachels|first1=James|authorlink1=James Rachels|title=Why Privacy is Important|journal=[[Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs]]|date=Summer 1975|volume=4|issue=4|pages=323–33|jstor=2265077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concepts in popular media===
Privacy can mean different things in different contexts; different people, cultures, and nations have different expectations about how much privacy a person is entitled to or what constitutes an [[invasion of privacy]].

====Personal privacy====
Most people have a strong sense of privacy in relation to the exposure of their body to others. This is an aspect of personal [[modesty]]. A person will go to extreme lengths to protect this personal modesty, the main way being the wearing of [[clothing|clothes]]. Other ways include erection of [[wall]]s, [[fence]]s, screens, use of [[cathedral glass]], partitions, by maintaining a distance, beside other ways. People who go to those lengths expect that their privacy will be respected by others. At the same time, people are prepared to expose themselves in acts of [[physical intimacy]], but these are confined to exposure in circumstances and of persons of their choosing. Even a discussion of those circumstances is regarded as intrusive and typically unwelcome.

Physical privacy could be defined as preventing "intrusions into one's physical space or solitude."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BwQBT2Mr1YoC&amp;pg=PA188&amp;dq=physical+privacy&amp;sig=dvybgqk6wfkf_xGimY8lvtWVV3I|title=Managing Privacy: Information Technology and Corporate America|first=H. Jeff|last=Smith|date=14 April 1994|publisher=UNC Press Books|accessdate=14 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This would include concerns such as:
* Preventing intimate acts or hiding one's body from others for the purpose of [[modesty]]; apart from being [[clothing|dressed]] this can be achieved by [[wall]]s, [[fence]]s, privacy screens, [[cathedral glass]], partitions between [[urinal (restroom)|urinals]], by being far away from others, on a bed by a [[bed sheet]] or a [[blanket]], when changing clothes by a [[towel]], etc.; to what extent these measures also prevent acts being ''heard'' varies
* Video, of aptly named graphic, or intimate, acts, behaviors or body parts
* Preventing searching of one's personal possessions
* Preventing unauthorized access to one's home or vehicle
* [[Medical privacy]], the right to make fundamental medical decisions without governmental coercion or third-party review, most widely applied to questions of contraception

An example of the legal basis for the right to physical privacy is the U.S. [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]], which guarantees "the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3805/is_200206/ai_n9109326/pg_1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080310024937/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3805/is_200206/ai_n9109326/pg_1 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-03-10 |work=Georgetown Law Journal |title=Fixing the Fourth Amendment with trade secret law: A response to Kyllo v. United States |year=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most countries have laws regarding [[trespassing]] and property rights also determine the right of physical privacy.

Physical privacy may be a matter of cultural sensitivity, personal dignity, and/or shyness. There may also be concerns about safety, if for example one is wary of becoming the victim of crime or [[stalking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.privacyrights.org/fs/fs14a-stalking.htm |title=Security Recommendations For Stalking Victims |publisher=Privacyrights.org |accessdate=2012-01-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111081006/http://www.privacyrights.org/fs/fs14a-stalking.htm |archive-date=2012-01-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Civil inattention]] is a process whereby individuals are able to maintain their privacy within a crowd.

====Informational====
{{Main|Information privacy}}

Information or data privacy refers to the evolving relationship between technology and the legal right to, or public expectation of, privacy in the collection and sharing of data about one's self. Privacy concerns exist wherever uniquely identifiable data relating to a person or persons are collected and stored, in digital form or otherwise. In some cases these concerns refer to how data are collected, stored, and associated. In other cases the issue is who is given access to information. Other issues include whether an individual has any ownership rights to data about them, and/or the right to view, verify, and challenge that information.

Various types of [[personal information]] are often associated with privacy concerns. Information plays an important role in the decision-action process, which can lead to problems in terms of privacy and availability. First, it allows people to see all the options and alternatives available. Secondly, it allows people to choose which of the options would be best for a certain situation. An information landscape consists of the information, its location in the so-called network, as well as its availability, awareness, and usability. Yet the set-up of the information landscape means that information that is available in one place may not be available somewhere else. This can lead to a privacy situation that leads to questions regarding which people have the power to access and use certain information, who should have that power, and what provisions govern it. For various reasons, individuals may object to personal information such as their religion, sexual orientation, political affiliations, or personal activities being revealed, perhaps to avoid [[discrimination]], personal embarrassment, or damage to their professional reputations.

[[Financial privacy]], in which information about a person's financial transactions is guarded, is important for the avoidance of [[fraud]] including [[identity theft]]. Information about a person's purchases, for instance, can reveal a great deal about their preferences, places they have visited, their contacts, products (such as medications) they use, their activities and habits, etc. In addition to this, financial privacy also includes privacy over the bank accounts opened by individuals. Information about the bank where the individual has an account with, and whether or not this is in a country that [[Bank secrecy|does not share this information with other countries]] can help countries in fighting [[tax avoidance]].

[[Internet privacy]] is the ability to determine what information one reveals or withholds about oneself over the Internet, who has access to such information, and for what purposes one's information may or may not be used. For example, web users may be concerned to discover that many of the web sites which they visit collect, store, and possibly share [[personally identifiable information]] about them. Similarly, Internet email users generally consider their emails to be private and hence would be concerned if their [[email]] was being accessed, read, stored or forwarded by third parties without their consent. Tools used to protect privacy on the Internet include encryption tools and anonymizing services like [[I2P]] and [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]].

[[Medical privacy]] Protected Health Information OCR/HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) allows a person to withhold their medical records and other information from others, perhaps because of fears that it might affect their insurance coverage or employment, or to avoid the embarrassment caused by revealing medical conditions or treatments. Medical information could also reveal other aspects of one's personal life, such as sexual preferences or proclivity. A right to sexual privacy enables individuals to [[contraceptive security|acquire and use contraceptives]] without family, community or legal sanctions.

[[Political privacy]] has been a concern since [[voting system]]s emerged in ancient times. The [[secret ballot]] helps to ensure that voters cannot be coerced into voting in certain ways, since they can allocate their vote as they wish in the privacy and security of the voting booth while maintaining the anonymity of the vote. Secret ballots are nearly universal in modern [[democracy]], and considered a basic right of [[citizenship]], despite the difficulties that they cause (for example the inability to trace votes back to the corresponding voters increases the risk of someone stuffing additional fraudulent votes into the system: additional security controls are needed to minimize such risks).

Corporate privacy refers to the privacy rights of corporate actors like senior executives of large, publicly traded corporations. Desires for corporate privacy can frequently raise issues with obligations for public disclosures under securities and corporate law.

====Organizational====

Government agencies, corporations, groups/societies and other organizations may desire to keep their activities or secrets from being revealed to other organizations or individuals, adopting various [[security]] practices and controls in order to keep private information confidential. Organizations may seek legal protection for their secrets. For example, a government administration may be able to invoke [[executive privilege]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://writ.corporate.findlaw.com/amar/20040416.html |title=FindLaw's Writ – Amar: Executive Privilege |publisher=Writ.corporate.findlaw.com |date=2004-04-16 |accessdate=2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; or declare certain information to be [[Classified information|classified]], or a corporation might attempt to protect valuable proprietary information as [[trade secret]]s.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

====Spiritual and intellectual====

The earliest legislative development of privacy rights began under [[British common law]], which protected "only the physical interference of life and property." Its development from then on became "one of the most significant chapters in the history of privacy law."&lt;ref name=Solove&gt;Solove, Daniel J., Rotenberg, Marc, Schwartz, Paul M. ''Privacy, Information, and Technology'', Aspen Publ. (2006) pp. 9–11&lt;/ref&gt; Privacy rights gradually expanded to include a "recognition of man's spiritual nature, of his feelings and his intellect."&lt;ref name=Solove/&gt; Eventually, the scope of those rights broadened even further to include a basic "right to be let alone", and the former definition of "property" would then comprise "every form of possession—intangible, as well as tangible." By the late 19th century, interest in a "right to privacy" grew as a response to the growth of print media, especially newspapers.&lt;ref name=Solove/&gt;

==History==
{{further|Privacy laws of the United States}}
Privacy has historical roots in philosophical discussions, the most well-known being Aristotle's distinction between two spheres of life: the public sphere of the ''polis'', associated with political life, and the private sphere of the ''oikos'', associated with domestic life.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|edition = Spring 2015|title = Privacy|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2015/entries/privacy/|date = 2015-01-01|first = Judith|last = DeCew|editor-first = Edward N.|editor-last = Zalta}}&lt;/ref&gt; More systematic treatises of privacy in the United States did not appear until the 1890s, with the development of privacy law in America.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===Technology===
[[File:IllinoisTelephoneAndTelegraphAd.png|thumb|200px|Advertisement for dial telephone service available to delegates to the 1912 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] convention in [[Chicago]]. A major selling point of dial telephone service was that it was "secret", in that no operator was required to connect the call.]]

As technology has advanced, the way in which privacy is protected and violated has changed with it. In the case of some technologies, such as the [[printing press]] or the [[Internet]], the increased ability to share information can lead to new ways in which privacy can be breached. It is generally agreed that the first publication advocating privacy in the United States was the article by [[Samuel D. Warren (US attorney)|Samuel Warren]] and [[Louis Brandeis]], "[[The Right to Privacy (article)|The Right to Privacy]]", [http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/articles/privacy/Privacy_brand_warr2.html 4 ''Harvard Law Review'' 193 (1890)], that was written largely in response to the increase in newspapers and photographs made possible by printing technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Information Privacy, Official Reference for the Certified Information privacy Professional (CIPP), Swire, P.&amp;nbsp;P. [https://www.amazon.com/s?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;sort=relevancerank&amp;search-type=ss&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Peter%20P.%20Swire]. and Bermann, S. (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rbs2.com/privacy.htm |title=Privacy Law in the United States |publisher=Rbs2.com |accessdate=2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New technologies can also create new ways to gather private information. For example, in the United States it was thought that heat sensors intended to be used to find marijuana-growing operations would be acceptable. However, in 2001 in ''[[Kyllo v. United States]]'' (533 U.S. 27) it was decided that the use of [[thermal imaging]] devices that can reveal previously unknown information without a warrant does indeed constitute a violation of privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/privacy/ |title=Privacy (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |accessdate=2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally the increased ability to gather and send information has had negative implications for retaining privacy. As large-scale [[information systems]] become more common, there is so much information stored in many databases worldwide that an individual has no practical means of knowing of or controlling all of the information about themselves that others may have hold or access. Such information could potentially be sold to others for profit and/or be used for purposes not known to or sanctioned by the individual concerned. The concept of [[information privacy]] has become more significant as more systems controlling more information appear. Also the consequences of privacy violations can be more severe. [[Privacy law]] in many countries has had to adapt to changes in technology in order to address these issues and, to some extent, maintain privacy rights. But the existing global privacy rights framework has also been criticized as incoherent and inefficient. Proposals such as the [[APEC]] Privacy Framework have emerged which set out to provide the first comprehensive legal framework on the issue of global data privacy.

There are various theories about privacy and privacy control. The Invasion Paradigm defines privacy violation as the hostile actions of a wrongdoer who causes direct harm to an individual. This is a reactive view of privacy protection as it waits until there is a violation before acting to protect the violated individual, sometimes through criminal punishments for those who invaded the privacy of others. In the Invasion Paradigm this threat of criminal punishment that is supposed to work as deterrent. The Secrecy paradigm defines a privacy invasion as someone’s concealed information or hidden world being revealed through surveillance. The Negative Freedom Paradigm views privacy as freedom from invasion rather than a right, going against the more popular view of a "right to privacy." Finally, the Inaccessibility Paradigm states that privacy is the state where something is completely inaccessible to others. Daniel Solove, a law professor at George Washington University also has a theory of privacy. He believes that a conceptualized view of privacy will not work because there is no one core element. There are many different, interconnected elements involved in privacy and privacy protection. Therefore, Solove proposes looking at these issues from the bottom up, focusing on privacy problems. People may often overlook the fact that certain elements of privacy problems are due to the structure of privacy itself. Therefore, the architecture must change wherein people must learn to view privacy as a social and legal structure. He also states that people have to redefine the relationship between privacy and businesses and the government. Participation in certain privacy elements of the government and businesses should allow people to choose whether they want to be a part of certain aspects of their work that could be considered privacy invasion.

===Internet===
{{Main|Internet privacy}}

The Internet has brought new concerns about privacy in an age where computers can permanently store records of everything: "where every online photo, status update, Twitter post and blog entry by and about us can be stored forever", writes law professor and author [[Jeffrey Rosen]].&lt;ref name=Rosen&gt;Rosen, Jeffrey. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/25/magazine/25privacy-t2.html?_r=1&amp;ref=technology "The Web Means the End of Forgetting"] ''New York Times'', July 19, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

This currently has an effect on employment. [[Microsoft]] reports that 75 percent of U.S. recruiters and human-resource professionals now do online research about candidates, often using information provided by search engines, social-networking sites, photo/video-sharing sites, personal web sites and blogs, and [[Twitter]]. They also report that 70 percent of U.S. recruiters have rejected candidates based on internet information. This has created a need by many to control various online privacy settings in addition to controlling their online reputations, both of which have led to legal suits against various sites and employers.&lt;ref name=Rosen/&gt;

The ability to do online inquiries about individuals has expanded dramatically over the last decade. [[Facebook]] for example, as of August 2015, was the largest social-networking site, with nearly 1,490 million members, who upload over 4.75 billion pieces of content daily. Over 83.09 million accounts were fake. [[Twitter]] has more than 316 million registered users and over 20 million are fake users. The [[Library of Congress]] recently announced that it will be acquiring—and permanently storing—the entire archive of public Twitter posts since 2006, reports Rosen.&lt;ref name=Rosen/&gt;

Importantly, directly observed behaviour, such as browsing logs, search queries, or contents of the Facebook profile can be automatically processed to infer secondary information about an individual, such as sexual orientation, political and religious views, race, substance use, intelligence, and personality.&lt;ref name="Kosinski 2013 5802–5805"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kosinski|first=Michal|author2=Stillwell, D. |author3=Graepel, T. |title=Private traits and attributes are predictable from digital records of human behavior|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|year=2013|volume=110|issue=15|pages=5802–05|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/110/15/5802.full.pdf+html|doi=10.1073/pnas.1218772110|pmid=23479631|pmc=3625324}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kosinski|first=Michal|author2=Bachrach, Y. |author3=Stillwell, D.J. |author4=Kohli, P. |author5=Graepel, T. |title=Manifestations Of User Personality In Website Choice And Behaviour On Online Social Networks|journal=Machine Learning Journal|date=19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effectively, individual views and preferences can be revealed even if they were not directly expressed or indicated (e.g. by stating their political views on their Facebook profile, or visiting a gay community website).

According to some experts, many commonly used communication devices may be mapping every move of their users. Senator [[Al Franken]] has noted the seriousness of [[iPhones]] and [[iPads]] having the ability to record and store users' locations in unencrypted files,&lt;ref&gt;Popkin, Helen A.&amp;nbsp;S., [https://archive.is/20120714202126/http://technolog.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/04/21/6508416-govt-officials-want-answers-to-secret-iphone-tracking "Gov't officials want answers to secret iPhone tracking"] ''MSNBC'', "Technology", April 21, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; although Apple denied doing so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9216210/Apple_denies_tracking_iPhone_users_but_promises_changes?taxonomyId=84 "Apple denies tracking iPhone users, but promises changes"], ''Computerworld'', April 27, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andrew Grove]], co-founder and former CEO of [[Intel Corporation]], offered his thoughts on internet privacy in an interview published in May 2000:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esquire.com/features/what-ive-learned/learned-andy-grove-0500 "What I've Learned: Andy Grove"], ''Esquire'' magazine, May 1, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Privacy is one of the biggest problems in this new electronic age. At the heart of the Internet culture is a force that wants to find out everything about you. And once it has found out everything about you and two hundred million others, that's a very valuable asset, and people will be tempted to trade and do commerce with that asset. This wasn't the information that people were thinking of when they called this the information age.}}

==Actions which take away privacy==
As with other concepts about privacy, there are various ways to discuss what kinds of processes or actions remove, challenge, lessen, or attack privacy. In 1960 legal scholar [[William Prosser (academic)|William Prosser]] created the following list of activities which can be remedied with privacy protection:{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=101}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prosser|first1=William|authorlink1=William Prosser (academic)|title=Privacy|journal=[[California Law Review]]|date=1960|volume=48|issue=383|page=389|url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/californialawreview/vol48/iss3/1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Intrusion into a person’s private space, own affairs, or wish for solitude{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=101}}
# Public disclosure of personal information about a person which could be embarrassing for them to have revealed{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=101}}
# Promoting access to information about a person which could lead the public to have incorrect beliefs about them{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=101}}
# Encroaching someone’s personality rights, and using their likeness to advance interests which are not their own{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=101}}

Building from this and other historical precedents, [[Daniel J. Solove]] presented another classification of actions which are harmful to privacy, including collection of information which is already somewhat public, processing of information, sharing information, and invading personal space to get private information.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=103}}

===Collecting information===
In the context of harming privacy, information collection means gathering whatever information can be obtained by doing something to obtain it.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=103}} Surveillance is an example of this, when someone decides to begin watching and recording someone or something, and interrogation is another example of this, when someone uses another person as a source of information.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=103}} Examples of information collection agencies include the [[NSA]] and the participants in the [[Five Eyes]] program.

===Aggregating information===
It can happen that privacy is not harmed when information is available, but that the harm can come when that information is collected as a set then processed in a way that the collective reporting of pieces of information encroaches on privacy.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} Actions in this category which can lessen privacy include the following:{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}
* [[data aggregation]], which is connecting many related but unconnected pieces of information{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}
* identification, which can mean breaking the [[de-identification]] of items of data by putting it through a [[de-anonymization]] process, thus making facts which were intended to not name particular people to become associated with those people{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}
* insecurity, such as lack of [[data security]], which includes when an organization is supposed to be responsible for protecting data instead suffers a [[data breach]] which harms the people whose data it held{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}
* secondary use, which is when people agree to share their data for a certain purpose, but then the data is used in ways without the data donors’ [[informed consent]]{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}
* exclusion is the use of a person's data without any attempt to give the person an opportunity to manage the data or participate in its usage{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}

===Information dissemination===
{{quote|''Count not him among your friends who will retail your privacies to the world.''|[[Publilius Syrus]]}}
Information dissemination is an attack on privacy when information which was shared in confidence is shared or threatened to be shared in a way that harms the subject of the information.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}

There are various examples of this.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} Breach of confidentiality is when one entity promises to keep a person’s information private, then breaks that promise.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} Disclosure is making information about a person more accessible in a way that harms the subject of the information, regardless of how the information was collected or the intent of making it available.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} Exposure is a special type of disclosure in which the information disclosed is emotional to the subject or taboo to share, such as revealing their private life experiences, their nudity, or perhaps private body functions.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} Increased accessibility means advertising the availability of information without actually distributing it, as in the case of doxxing.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} Blackmail is making a threat to share information, perhaps as part of an effort to coerce someone.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} Appropriation is an attack on the [[personhood]] of someone, and can include using the value of someone's reputation or likeness to advance interests which are not those of the person being appropriated.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} Distortion is the creation of misleading information or lies about a person.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}

===Invasions===
Invasion of privacy, a subset of [[expectation of privacy]], is a different concept from the collecting, aggregating, and disseminating information because those three are a misuse of available data, whereas invasion is an attack on the right of individuals to keep personal secrets.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} An invasion is an attack in which information, whether intended to be public or not, is captured in a way that insults the personal dignity and right to private space of the person whose data is taken.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}

An intrusion is any unwanted entry into a person's private personal space and solitude for any reason, regardless of whether data is taken during that breach of space.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} "Decisional interference" is when an entity somehow injects itself into the personal decision making process of another person, perhaps to influence that person's private decisions but in any case doing so in a way that disrupts the private personal thoughts that a person has.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}

==Right to privacy==
{{main|Right to privacy}}

Privacy uses the theory of natural rights, and generally responds to new information and communication technologies. In North America, [[Samuel D. Warren (US attorney)|Samuel D. Warren]] and [[Louis D. Brandeis]] wrote that privacy is the "right to be let alone" (Warren &amp; Brandeis, 1890) focuses on protecting individuals. This citation was a response to recent technological developments, such as photography, and sensationalist journalism, also known as [[yellow journalism]].&lt;ref name=Brandeis&gt;Warren and Brandeis, [http://www.law.louisville.edu/library/collections/brandeis/node/225 "The Right To Privacy"], 4 Harvard Law Review 193 (1890)&lt;/ref&gt;

Privacy rights are inherently intertwined with information technology. In his widely cited [[dissenting opinion]] in ''[[Olmstead v. United States]]'' (1928), Brandeis relied on thoughts he developed in his [[Louis Brandeis#Creating a Right to Privacy|''Harvard Law Review'' article]] in 1890. But in his dissent, he now changed the focus whereby he urged making personal privacy matters more relevant to [[constitutional law]], going so far as saying "the government [was] identified .... as a potential privacy invader." He writes, "Discovery and invention have made it possible for the Government, by means far more effective than stretching upon the rack, to obtain disclosure in court of what is whispered in the closet." At that time, telephones were often community assets, with shared party lines and the potentially nosey human operators. By the time of Katz, in 1967, telephones had become personal devices with lines not shared across homes and switching was electro-mechanical. In the 1970s, new computing and recording technologies began to raise concerns about privacy, resulting in the [[Fair Information Practice Principles]].

===Definitions===

In recent years there have been only few attempts to clearly and precisely define a "right to privacy." Some experts assert that in fact the right to privacy "should not be defined as a separate legal right" at all. By their reasoning, existing laws relating to privacy in general should be sufficient.&lt;ref name=Haifa&gt;Yael Onn, et al., [https://books.google.com/books?id=yeVRrrJw-zAC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=right+to+privacy+tel+aviv&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=T0IhTaWhEI-msQOizMWZCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=right%20to%20privacy%20tel%20aviv&amp;f=false ''Privacy in the Digital Environment''], Haifa Center of Law &amp; Technology, (2005) pp. 1–12&lt;/ref&gt; Other experts, such as [[William Prosser (academic)|Dean Prosser]], have attempted, but failed, to find a "common ground" between the leading kinds of privacy cases in the court system, at least to formulate a definition.&lt;ref name=Haifa/&gt; One law school treatise from Israel, however, on the subject of "privacy in the digital environment", suggests that the "right to privacy should be seen as an independent right that deserves legal protection in itself." It has therefore proposed a working definition for a "right to privacy":
&lt;blockquote&gt;''The right to privacy is our right to keep a domain around us, which includes all those things that are part of us, such as our body, home, property, thoughts, feelings, secrets and identity. The right to privacy gives us the ability to choose which parts in this domain can be accessed by others, and to control the extent, manner and timing of the use of those parts we choose to disclose.''&lt;ref name=Haifa/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===An individual right===

[[Alan Westin]] believes that new technologies alter the balance between privacy and disclosure, and that privacy rights may limit government surveillance to protect democratic processes. Westin defines privacy as "the claim of individuals, groups, or institutions to determine for themselves when, how, and to what extent information about them is communicated to others". Westin describes four states of privacy: solitude, intimacy, anonymity, and reserve. These states must balance participation against norms:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Each individual is continually engaged in a personal adjustment process in which he balances the desire for privacy with the desire for disclosure and communication of himself to others, in light of the environmental conditions and social norms set by the society in which he lives.
— Alan Westin, Privacy and Freedom, 1968&lt;ref&gt;Westin, A. (1968). Privacy and freedom (Fifth ed.). New York: Atheneum.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Under liberal democratic systems, privacy creates a space separate from political life, and allows personal autonomy, while ensuring democratic [[Freedom of association|freedoms of association]] and [[Freedom of speech|expression]].

David Flaherty believes networked computer databases pose threats to privacy. He develops 'data protection' as an aspect of privacy, which involves "the collection, use, and dissemination of personal information". This concept forms the foundation for fair information practices used by governments globally. Flaherty forwards an idea of privacy as information control, "[i]ndividuals want to be left alone and to exercise some control over how information about them is used".&lt;ref&gt;Flaherty, D. (1989). Protecting privacy in surveillance societies: The federal republic of Germany, Sweden, France, Canada, and the United States. Chapel Hill, U.S.: The University of North Carolina Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Posner and Lawrence Lessig focus on the economic aspects of personal information control. Posner criticizes privacy for concealing information, which reduces market efficiency. For Posner, employment is selling oneself in the labour market, which he believes is like selling a product. Any 'defect' in the 'product' that is not reported is fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Posner | first1 = R. A. | year = 1981 | title = The economics of privacy | url = | journal = The American Economic Review | volume = 71 | issue = 2| pages = 405–09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For Lessig, privacy breaches online can be regulated through code and law. Lessig claims "the protection of privacy would be stronger if people conceived of the right as a property right", and that "individuals should be able to control information about themselves".&lt;ref&gt;Lessig, L. (2006). Code: Version 2.0. New York, U.S.: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Economic approaches to privacy make communal conceptions of privacy difficult to maintain.

===A collective "value" and a "human right"===

There have been attempts to reframe privacy as a fundamental [[Human rights|human right]], whose social value is an essential component in the functioning of democratic societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Deborah|title=Ethical theory and business.|year=2009|publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|isbn=0136126022|pages=428–42|edition=8th|authorlink=Privacy|editors=Beauchamp, Bowie, Arnold}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amitai Etzioni]] suggests a [[Communitarianism|communitarian]] approach to privacy. This requires a shared moral culture for establishing social order.&lt;ref&gt;Etzioni, A. (2006). Communitarianism. In B. S. Turner (Ed.), The Cambridge Dictionary of Sociology (pp. 81–83). Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Etzioni believes that "[p]rivacy is merely one good among many others",&lt;ref&gt;Etzioni, A. (2007). Are new technologies the enemy of privacy? Knowledge, Technology &amp; Policy, 20, 115–19.&lt;/ref&gt; and that technological effects depend on community accountability and oversight (ibid). He claims that privacy laws only increase government surveillance by weakening informal social controls.&lt;ref&gt;Etzioni, A. (2000). A communitarian perspective on privacy. Connecticut Law Review, 32(3), 897–905.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the government is no longer the only or even principle threat to people's privacy. Etzioni notes that corporate data miners, or "[https://web.archive.org/web/20130905184715/http://icps.gwu.edu/files/2010/10/privacy-merchants.pdf Privacy Merchants]," stand to profit by selling massive dossiers personal information, including purchasing decisions and Internet traffic, to the highest bidder. And while some might not find collection of private information objectionable when it is only used commercially by the private sector, the information these corporations amass and process is also available to the government, so that it is no longer possible to protect privacy by only curbing the State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Etzioni |first=Amitai |title=The Privacy Merchants: What is to be done? |journal=The Journal of Constitutional Law |date=March 2012 |volume=14 |issue=4 |page=950 |url=http://icps.gwu.edu/files/2010/10/privacy-merchants.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130905184715/http://icps.gwu.edu/files/2010/10/privacy-merchants.pdf |archivedate=2013-09-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Priscilla Regan believes that individual concepts of privacy have failed philosophically and in policy. She supports a social value of privacy with three dimensions: shared perceptions, public values, and [[Collectivism|collective]] components. Shared ideas about privacy allows freedom of conscience and diversity in thought. Public values guarantee democratic participation, including freedoms of speech and association, and limits government power. Collective elements describe privacy as collective good that cannot be divided. Regan's goal is to strengthen privacy claims in policy making: "if we did recognize the collective or public-good value of privacy, as well as the common and public value of privacy, those advocating privacy protections would have a stronger basis upon which to argue for its protection".&lt;ref&gt;Regan, P. M. (1995). Legislating privacy: Technology, social values, and public policy. Chapel Hill, U.S.: The University of North Carolina Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leslie Regan Shade argues that the human right to privacy is necessary for meaningful democratic participation, and ensures human dignity and autonomy. Privacy depends on norms for how information is distributed, and if this is appropriate. Violations of privacy depend on context. The human right to privacy has precedent in the [[United Nations Declaration of Human Rights]]: "Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers."&lt;ref&gt;United Nations. (1948). Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Retrieved October 7, 2006 from {{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208080853/http://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html |archivedate=2014-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shade believes that privacy must be approached from a people-centered perspective, and not through the marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;Shade, L. R. (2008). Reconsidering the right to privacy in Canada. Bulletin of Science, Technology &amp; Society, 28(1), 80–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protection==
[[File:Privacy International 2007 privacy ranking map.png|thumb|300px|[[Privacy International]] 2007 privacy ranking&lt;br /&gt;green: Protections and safeguards&lt;br /&gt;red: Endemic surveillance societies]]

Most countries give citizen rights to privacy in their constitutions.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=3–4}} Representative examples of this include the ''[[Constitution of Brazil]]'', which says "the privacy, private life, honor and image of people are inviolable"; the ''[[Constitution of South Africa]]'' says that "everyone has a right to privacy"; and the ''[[Constitution of the Republic of Korea]]'' says "the privacy of no citizen shall be infringed."{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=3–4}} Among most countries whose constitutions do not explicitly describe privacy rights, court decisions have interpreted their constitutions to intend to give privacy rights.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=3–4}}

Many countries have broad privacy laws outside their constitutions, including Australia’s [[Privacy Act 1988]], Argentina’s Law for the Protection of Personal Data of 2000, Canada’s 2000 [[Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act]], and Japan’s 2003 Personal Information Protection Law.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=3–4}}

Beyond national privacy laws, there are international privacy agreements.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=3}} The United Nations [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] says "No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation."{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=3–4}} The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] published its Privacy Guidelines in 1980. The [[European Union]]'s 1995 [[Data Protection Directive]] guides privacy protection in Europe.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=3–4}} The 2004 Privacy Framework by the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] is a privacy protection agreement for the members of that organization.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=3–4}}

In the 1960s people began to consider how changes in technology were bringing changes in the concept of privacy.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=3–4}} [[Vance Packard]]’s ''[[The Naked Society]]'' was a popular book on privacy from that era and led discourse on privacy at that time.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=3–4}}

===Free market versus consumer protection approaches===
Approaches to privacy can, broadly, be divided into two categories: free market, and consumer protection.&lt;ref name="quinn"&gt;{{cite book | title=Ethics for the Information Age | author=Quinn, Michael J. | year=2009 | isbn=0-321-53685-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a free market approach, commercial entities are largely allowed to do what they wish, with the expectation that consumers will choose to do business with corporations that respect their privacy to a desired degree. If some companies are not sufficiently respectful of privacy, they will lose market share. Such an approach may be limited by lack of competition in a market, by enterprises not offering privacy options favorable to the user, or by lack of information about actual privacy practices. Claims of privacy protection made by companies may be difficult for consumers to verify, except when they have already been violated.

In a consumer protection approach, in contrast, it is claimed that individuals may not have the time or knowledge to make informed choices, or may not have reasonable alternatives available. In support of this view, Jensen and Potts showed that most privacy policies are above the reading level of the average person.&lt;ref name="Jensen"&gt;{{cite journal | title= Privacy policies as decision-making tools: an evaluation of online privacy notices | author=Jensen, Carlos | year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, this approach advocates greater government definition and enforcement of privacy standards.

===Privacy law===
{{Main|Privacy law}}

Privacy law is the area of law concerning the protecting and preserving of privacy rights of individuals. While there is no universally accepted privacy law among all countries, some organizations promote certain concepts be enforced by individual countries. For example, the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], article 12, states:

:''No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.''

====Australia====
{{main |Privacy in Australian law}}

The ''Privacy Act 1988'' is administered by the [https://www.oaic.gov.au Office of the Australian Information Commissioner].

Privacy law has been evolving in Australia for a number of years. The initial introduction of privacy law in 1998 extended to the public sector, specifically to Federal government departments, under the Information Privacy Principles. State government agencies can also be subject to state based privacy legislation. This built upon the already existing privacy requirements that applied to telecommunications providers (under Part 13 of the ''Telecommunications Act 1997''), and confidentiality requirements that already applied to banking, legal and patient / doctor relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy-law/|title=Privacy Law|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Privacy Act 1988'' was then extended to include the private sector in 2000 with the introduction of the National Privacy Principles. These took effect in 2001. Small businesses with an annual turnover of $3m were excluded from meeting the obligations specified in the National Privacy Principles with some exceptions such as those whose primary business was dealing in personal information.

In 2008 the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) conducted a review of Australian Privacy Law. The resulting report [http://www.alrc.gov.au/publications/report-108 For Your Information] was one of the largest reports ever released by the ALRC. Amongst its many recommendations were the consolidation of both the Information Privacy Principles and the National Privacy Principles to form what is now known as the Australian Privacy Principles.

This recommendation, and many others, were taken up and implemented by the Australian Government via the [https://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012A00197 Privacy Amendment (Enhancing Privacy Protection) Bill 2012].

The Australian Privacy Principles, along with other key changes to the overall Act, took effect on 12 March 2014. The new structure of the privacy principles follow the information cycle and incorporate key emerging privacy concepts including privacy by design.

There are currently 14 Australian Privacy Principles:

# open and transparent management of personal information
# anonymity and pseudonymity
# collection of solicited personal information
# dealing with unsolicited personal information
# notification of the collection of personal information
# use or disclosure of personal information
# direct marketing
# cross-border disclosure of personal information
# adoption, use or disclosure of government related identifiers
# quality of personal information
# security of personal information
# access to personal information
# correction of personal information

As of 22 February 2018, the Privacy Amendment (Notifiable Data Breaches) Act 2017 will introduce a mandatory data breach notification obligations for all organisations that are subject to Australia’s Privacy Act 1988 (Cth). This includes all Australian-registered companies and foreign-registered companies that carry on business in Australia or that interact with Australian data subjects.

===== Other Australian privacy laws =====

There are a range of other laws that provide privacy protection in Australia. These include, but are not limited to, the ''Telecommunications Act 1997'', ''Spam Act 2006'', the ''Do Not Call Register Act 2009'', general confidentiality obligations arising from certain professional relationships including with doctors, lawyers and other health providers, state based legislation including NSW [[Employee monitoring|workplace surveillance]] laws, state based laws that apply in NSW, Queensland and other states for the handling of health information and the handling of information by state government agencies.

====Brazil====
The [[Constitution of Brazil]] sets privacy as a major fundamental right. Even the State is not allowed to violate personal data, intimacy, private life, honor and image (article 5, incise X). In extreme situations, a judicial order can authorize some level of disclosure. But some data, such as correspondence, are absolutely inviolable, and not even judicial order can authorize the disclosure.

====China====

Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China

Article 245 Whoever unlawfully subjects another person to a body search or a search of his residence or unlawfully intrudes into another person's residence shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years or criminal detention. Any judicial officer who abuses his power and commits the crime mentioned in the preceding paragraph shall be given a heavier punishment.

Article 246 Whoever, by violence or other methods, publicly humiliates another person or invent stories to defame him, if the circumstances are serious, shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years, criminal detention, public surveillance or deprivation of political rights. The crime mentioned in the preceding paragraph shall be handled only upon complaint, except where serious harm is done to public order or to the interests of the State.

Article 252 Whoever conceals, destroys or unlawfully opens another person's letter, thereby infringing upon the citizen's right to freedom of correspondence, if the circumstances are serious, shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than one year or criminal detention.

Article 253 Any postal worker who opens without authorization or conceals or destroys mail or telegrams shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than two years or criminal detention. Whoever steals money or property by committing the crime mentioned in the preceding paragraph shall be convicted and given a heavier punishment in accordance with the provisions of Article 264 of this Law.

====Canada====
{{main |Canadian privacy law}}

[[Canadian privacy law]] is governed federally by multiple acts, including the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], and the [[Privacy Act (Canada)]]. Mostly this legislation concerns privacy infringement by government organizations. [[Data privacy]] was first addressed with the [[Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act]], and provincial-level legislation also exists to account for more specific cases personal privacy protection against commercial organizations.

====European Union====
For [[Europe]], Article 8 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] guarantees the right to respect for private and family life, one's home and correspondence. The [[European Court of Human Rights]] in [[Strasbourg]] has developed a large body of jurisprudence defining this fundamental right to privacy.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} The [[European Union]] requires all member states to legislate to ensure that citizens have a right to privacy, through directives such as the 1995 [[Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of personal data]]. It is regulated in the [[United Kingdom]] by the [[Data Protection Act 1998]] and in France [[data protection]] is also monitored by the [[CNIL]], a governmental body which must authorize legislation concerning privacy before it can be enacted. In civil law jurisdictions, the right to privacy fell within the ambit of the right to a private life (droit a la vie privee) from which the tort could be claimed. Personality rights and the broader tort based
interpretation of the right to privacy protected correspondence, personal information and dignity. These rights gave rise to causes for damages in most civil law jurisdictions and common law jurisdictions prior to the sui generis development of Data Protection.

Although there are comprehensive regulations for data protection, some studies show that despite the laws, there is a lack of enforcement in that no institution feels responsible to control the parties involved and enforce their laws.&lt;ref&gt;Burghardt, Buchmann, Böhm, Kühling, Sivridis ''A Study on the Lack of Enforcement of Data Protection Acts'' Proceedings of the 3rd int. conference on e-democracy, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The European Union is also championing for the 'Right to be Forgotten' concept (which allows individuals to ask that links leading to information about themselves be removed from internet search engine results) to be adopted by other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/03/french-official-campaigns-to-make-right-to-be-forgotten-global/|title=French Official Campaigns to Make 'Right to be Forgotten' Global|first=Mark|last=Scott|date=3 December 2014|website=nytimes.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''India'''

Due to the introduction of the Aadhaar project inhabitants of India were afraid that their privacy could be invaded. The project was also met with mistrust regarding the safety of the social protection infrastructures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Masiero|first=Silvia|date=2018-09-24|title=Explaining Trust in Large Biometric Infrastructures: A Critical Realist Case Study of India's Aadhaar Project|url=https://doi.org/10.1002/isd2.12053|journal=The Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries|language=en|pages=e12053|doi=10.1002/isd2.12053|issn=1681-4835}}&lt;/ref&gt; To tackle the fear amongst the people, India’s supreme court put a new ruling into action that stated that privacy from then on was seen as a fundamental right.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gemalto.com/govt/customer-cases/aadhaar|title=Aadhaar: 7 changes transforming India in 2018 {{!}} Gemalto|last=|first=|date=|website=www.gemalto.com|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24th of August 2017 this new law was established.

====Italy====
In [[Italy]] the [[right to privacy]] is enshrined in Article 15 of the [[Italian Constitution|Constitution]], which states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Italian Constitution |url=http://www.quirinale.it/page/costituzione|publisher=The official website of the Presidency of the Italian Republic |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161127152449/http://www.quirinale.it/qrnw/costituzione/pdf/costituzione_inglese.pdf |archivedate=2016-11-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Freedom and confidentiality of correspondence and of every other form of communication is inviolable. Limitations may only be imposed by judicial decision stating the reasons and in accordance with the guarantees provided by the law."

====United Kingdom====
{{main |Privacy in English law}}

In the [[United Kingdom]], it is not possible to bring an action for invasion of privacy. An action may be brought under another [[tort]] (usually breach of confidence) and privacy must then be considered under EC law. In the UK, it is sometimes a defence that disclosure of private information was in the public interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4482073.stm Does Beckham judgment change rules?], from [[BBC News]] (retrieved 27 April 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;
There is, however, the [[Information Commissioner's Office]] (ICO), an independent public body set up to promote access to official information and protect personal information. They do this by promoting good practice, ruling on eligible complaints, giving information to individuals and organisations, and taking action when the law is broken. The relevant UK laws include: [[Data Protection Act 1998]]; [[Freedom of Information Act 2000]]; [[Environmental Information Regulations 2004]]; [[Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003|Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003]]. The ICO has also provided a "Personal Information Toolkit" online which explains in more detail the various ways of protecting privacy online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ico.gov.uk/upload/documents/library/data_protection/practical_application/toolkit.pdf "Personal Information Toolkit"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103165639/http://www.ico.gov.uk/upload/documents/library/data_protection/practical_application/toolkit.pdf |date=2009-01-03 }} prepared by the Information Commissioner’s Office, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
{{main |Privacy laws of the United States}}

Although the [[United States Constitution|US Constitution]] does not explicitly include the right to privacy, individual as well as locational privacy are implicitly granted by the Constitution under the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|4th Amendment]]. The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] has found that other guarantees have "penumbras" that implicitly grant a right to privacy against government intrusion, for example in ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'' (1965). In the United States, the right of [[freedom of speech]] granted in the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] has limited the effects of lawsuits for breach of privacy. Privacy is regulated in the US by the [[Privacy Act of 1974]], and various state laws. The Privacy Act of 1974 only applies to Federal agencies in the executive branch of the Federal government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://foia.state.gov/Learn/PrivacyAct.aspx|title = The Privacy Act|date = 2015-05-22|accessdate = 2015-11-19|website = Freedom of Information Act|publisher = US Department of State|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain privacy rights have been established in the United States via legislation such as the [[Children's Online Privacy Protection Act]] (COPPA),&lt;ref&gt;Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. § 6501 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act]] (GLB), and the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] (HIPAA).
&lt;ref&gt;[[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Privacy Index===
The [[Electronic Privacy Information Center]]'s Privacy Index puts Brazil, Australia, Japan and South Africa in the higher level of privacy (around 2.2). On the bottom of the list are the United States and United Kingdom (around 1.4).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chartsbin.com/view/by8|title=International Privacy Index |publisher=Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) |date=2013-09-27 |accessdate=2013-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Privacy on the Internet===
{{Main|Internet privacy}}
{{see also|Right to be forgotten}}
There are many means to protect one's privacy on the internet. For example, e-mails can be encrypted (via [[S/MIME]] or [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]]) and anonymizing proxies or anonymizing networks like [[I2P]] and [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] can be used to prevent the internet service providers from knowing which sites one visits and with whom one communicates. Covert collection of personally identifiable information has been identified as a primary concern by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.&lt;ref name="FederalTrade"&gt;Federal Trade Commission (2010), "Protecting Consumer Privacy in an Era of Rapid Change: A Proposed Framework for Businesses and Policymakers," Preliminary FTC Staff Report (December), available at [http://www.ftc.gov/os/2010/12/101201privacyreport.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt; Although some privacy advocates recommend the deletion of original and third-party [[HTTP cookies]], Anthony Miyazaki, marketing professor at [[Florida International University]] and privacy scholar, warns that the "elimination of third-party cookie use by Web sites can be circumvented by cooperative strategies with third parties in which information is transferred after the Web site's use of original domain cookies."&lt;ref&gt;Miyazaki, Anthony D. (2008), "Online Privacy and the Disclosure of Cookie Use: Effects on Consumer Trust and Anticipated Patronage," ''Journal of Public Policy &amp; Marketing'', 23 (Spring), 19–33.&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2010, the Federal Trade Commission is reviewing policy regarding this issue as it relates to [[behavioral advertising]].&lt;ref name="FederalTrade" /&gt;
Another aspect of privacy on the Internet relates to online social networking. Several online social network sites (OSNs) are among the top 10 most visited websites globally. A review and evaluation of scholarly work regarding the current state of the value of individuals' privacy of online social networking show the following results: "first, adults seem to be more concerned about potential privacy threats than younger users; second, policy makers should be alarmed by a large part of users who underestimate risks of their information privacy on OSNs; third, in the case of using OSNs and its services, traditional one-dimensional privacy approaches fall short".&lt;ref&gt;Hugl, Ulrike (2011), "Reviewing Person’s Value of Privacy of Online Social Networking," ''Internet Research'', 21(4), in press, http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?issn=1066-2243&amp;volume=21&amp;issue=4&amp;articleid=1926600&amp;show=abstract.&lt;/ref&gt; This is exacerbated by the research indicating that personal traits such as sexual orientation, race, religious and political views, personality, or intelligence can be inferred based on the wide variety of digital footprint, such as samples of text, browsing logs, or Facebook Likes.&lt;ref name="Kosinski 2013 5802–5805" /&gt;

===Privacy and location-based services===

Increasingly, mobile devices facilitate location tracking.  This creates user privacy problems.  A user's location and preferences constitute personal information.  Their improper use violates that user's privacy.  A recent MIT study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=de Montjoye|first=Yves-Alexandre|author2=César A. Hidalgo |author3=Michel Verleysen |author4=Vincent D. Blondel |title=Unique in the Crowd: The privacy bounds of human mobility|journal=Scientific Reports|date=March 25, 2013|doi=10.1038/srep01376|url=http://www.nature.com/srep/2013/130325/srep01376/full/srep01376.html|accessdate=12 April 2013 |volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Palmer|first=Jason|title=Mobile location data 'present anonymity risk'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-21923360|accessdate=12 April 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=March 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; by de Montjoye et al. showed that 4 spatio-temporal points, approximate places and times, are enough to uniquely identify 95% of 1.5M people in a mobility database. The study
further shows that these constraints hold even when the resolution of the dataset is low. Therefore, even coarse or blurred datasets provide little anonymity.

Several methods to protect user privacy in [[location-based service]]s have been proposed, including the use of anonymizing servers, blurring of information e.a. Methods to quantify privacy have also been proposed, to calculate the equilibrium between the benefit of providing accurate location information and the drawbacks of risking personal privacy.&lt;ref&gt;Athanasios S. Voulodimos and Charalampos Z. Patrikakis, "Quantifying Privacy in Terms of Entropy for Context Aware Services", special issue of the Identity in the Information Society journal, "Identity Management in Grid and SOA", Springer, vol. 2, no 2, December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Users of such services may also choose to display more generic location information (i.e. "In the City" or "Philadelphia" or "Work") to some of their more casual acquaintances while only displaying specific location information, such as their exact address, to closer contacts like spouse, relatives, and good friends.

In recent years, seen with the increasing importance of mobile devices and paired with the ''[[National Do Not Call Registry]]'', telemarketers have turned attention to mobiles.&lt;ref name = "Telemarketers and Mobiles"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/sneaky-tactics-used-by-telemarketers-and-debt-collectors-to-get-your-cell-phone-number-2011-6 |title=Sneaky tactics used by telemarketers and debt collectors to get your cell phone number |publisher=Businessinsider.com |accessdate=2012-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The efforts of telemarketers to use mobile devices have been met with both ''[[Federal Trade Commission]]'' and companies like PrivacyStar. Each year, thousands of complaints are filed to the FTC database with the help of companies and consumers.

===Privacy by design===

The principle of [[privacy by design]] states that privacy and [[data protection]] are embedded throughout the entire life cycle of [[technologies]], from the early [[design]] stage to their deployment, use and ultimate disposal.

===Privacy engineering===

The practice of constructing, ostensibly, software or information systems that adhere to given privacy policies and relevant compliances is a developing area and is known as [[Privacy engineering]]

===Privacy self-synchronization===

Privacy self-synchronization is the mode by which the stakeholders of an enterprise privacy program spontaneously contribute collaboratively to the program's maximum success. The stakeholders may be customers, employees, managers, executives, suppliers, partners or investors. When self-synchronization is reached, the model states that the personal interests of individuals toward their privacy is in balance with the business interests of enterprises who collect and use the personal information of those individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Popa, C., et. all., "Managing Personal Information: Insights on Corporate Risk and Opportunity for Privacy-Savvy Leaders", Carswell (2012), Ch. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

== Privacy paradox ==
The privacy paradox is a phenomenon in which online users state that they are concerned about their privacy but behave as if they were not.&lt;ref name="Swartz, J. 2000"&gt;Swartz, J., "'Opting In': A Privacy Paradox", The Washington Post, 03 Sep 2000, H.1.&lt;/ref&gt; While this term was coined as early as 1998,&lt;ref&gt;Bedrick, B., Lerner, B., Whitehead, B."The privacy paradox: Introduction", "News Media and the Law", Washington, D.C., Volume 22, Issue 2, Spring 1998, pp. P1-P3.&lt;/ref&gt; it wasn't used in its current popular sense until the year 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Sweat, J. "Privacy paradox: Customers want control—and coupons", InformationWeek, Manhasset Iss, 781, April 10, 2000, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Swartz, J. 2000"/&gt; In his article titled "'Opting In': A Privacy Paradox," John Schwartz wrote that "It's one of the more puzzling conundrums of online life. While companies that capitalize on the Internet's powerful potential to invade privacy are denounced as villains of the information age, millions of people type out highly personal data and send it off to Web sites they've barely heard of, with no strong legal protection against misuse of the information. …The paradox helps illustrate the complexity of the debate over privacy."

Susan B. Barnes similarly used the term “privacy paradox” to refer to the ambiguous boundary between private and public space on social media.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, S., "A privacy paradox: Social networking in the United States", 
First Monday, volume 11, number 9 (September 2006), URL: http://firstmonday.org/issues/issue11_9/barnes/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; When compared to adults, young people tend to disclose more information on social media. However, this does not mean that they are not concerned about their privacy. Susan B. Barnes gave a case in her article: in a television interview about Facebook, a student addressed her concerns about disclosing personal information online. However, when the reporter asked to see her Facebook page, she put her home address, phone numbers, and pictures of her young son on the page.

Privacy paradox has been studied and scripted in different research settings. Although several studies have shown this inconsistency between privacy attitudes and behavior among online users, the reason for the paradox still remains unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Taddicken | first1 = M | year = 2014 | title = The 'Privacy Paradox'in the Social Web: The Impact of Privacy Concerns, Individual Characteristics, and the Perceived Social Relevance on Different Forms of Self-Disclosure | url = | journal = Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication | volume = 19 | issue = 2| pages = 248–73 | doi=10.1111/jcc4.12052}}&lt;/ref&gt; A main explanation for the privacy paradox is that users lack awareness of the risks and the degree of protection.&lt;ref&gt;Acquisti, A., &amp; Gross, R. (2006, June). Imagined communities: Awareness, information sharing, and privacy on the Facebook. In ''Privacy enhancing technologies'' (pp. 36–58). Springer Berlin Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;boyd, D., &amp; Hargittai, E. (2010). Facebook
privacy settings: Who cares? First Monday, 15(8). &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.uic.edu/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/3086/2589&lt;/nowiki&gt; (June 6, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tufekci | first1 = Z | year = 2008 | title = Grooming, gossip, Facebook and MySpace: What can we learn about these sites from those who won't assimilate?. | url = | journal = Information, Communication &amp; Society | volume = 11 | issue = 4| pages = 544–64 | doi=10.1080/13691180801999050}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users may underestimate the harm of disclosing information online.  On the other hand, some researchers argue the privacy paradox comes from lack of technology literacy and from the design of sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Livingstone | first1 = S | year = 2008 | title = Taking risky opportunities in youthful content creation: teenagers' use of social networking sites for intimacy, privacy and self-expression | url = | journal = New media &amp; society | volume = 10 | issue = 3| pages = 393–411 |
doi=10.1177/1461444808089415}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, users may not know how to change their default settings even though they care about their privacy.  Psychologists particularly pointed out that the privacy paradox occurs because users must trade-off between their privacy concerns and impression management.&lt;ref&gt;Utz, S., &amp; Kramer, N. (2009). The privacy paradox on social network sites revisited: The role of individual characteristics and group norms. ''Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace,'' ''3''(2), article 1.

[http://www.cyberpsychology.eu/view.php?cisloclanku=2009111001&amp;article=1 http://cyberpsychology.eu/view.php?cisloclanku=2009111001&amp;article=1]
&lt;/ref&gt; Other individual factors such as gender, age, trust and personality, may also account for the paradox.

== The right to privacy in popular culture ==

The 1993 film ''[[The Pelican Brief (film)|The Pelican Brief]]'', based on the [[The Pelican Brief|novel of the same name]], touches on privacy.  In one scene, a law professor discusses the Constitutional right to privacy. One of his students, played by [[Julia Roberts]], argues that the majority opinion in [[Bowers v. Hardwick|Bowers v Hardwick]] was wrongly decided.

In the TV series [[West Wing]], in the 1999 episode ''Short List'', the right to privacy arises during the appointment of a [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] judge.  [[Sam Seabourne]] ventures the opinion that [[Internet]] privacy will be a major social issue in the next two decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://westwingtranscripts.com/search.php?flag=getTranscript&amp;id=9|title=Search or Browse The West Wing Transcripts -- View or Search transcripts and summaries|author=|date=|website=westwingtranscripts.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Selfie culture ===
[[Selfies]] are popular today; a search for photos with the hashtag #selfie retrieves over 23 million results on Instagram and "a whopping 51 million with the hashtag #me"  However, due to modern corporate and governmental surveillance, this may pose a risk to privacy.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Giroux|first=Henry A.|date=2015-05-04|title=Selfie Culture in the Age of Corporate and State Surveillance|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09528822.2015.1082339|journal=Third Text|volume=29|issue=3|pages=155–164|doi=10.1080/09528822.2015.1082339|issn=0952-8822}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a research which takes a sample size of 3763, researchers found that for selfies, females generally have greater concerns than male social media users. Users who have greater concerns inversely predict their selfie behavior and activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dhir|first=Amandeep|last2=Torsheim|first2=Torbjørn|last3=Pallesen|first3=Ståle|last4=Andreassen|first4=Cecilie S.|date=2017|title=Do Online Privacy Concerns Predict Selfie Behavior among Adolescents, Young Adults and Adults?|url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00815/full|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|language=English|volume=8|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00815|issn=1664-1078}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reflective writing''' is an [[analysis|analytical]] practice in which the writer describes a real or imaginary scene, event, interaction, passing thought, memory, form, adding a personal reflection on the meaning of the item or incident, thought, feeling, emotion, or situation in his or her life. Many reflective writers keep in mind questions, such as "What did I notice?", "How has this changed me?" or "What might I have done differently?".

Thus, the focus is on writing that is not merely descriptive. The writer revisits the scene to note details and emotions, reflect on meaning, examine what went well or revealed a need for additional learning, and relate what transpired to the rest of life.

Reflective writing is also analyzing the event or idea (thinking in depth and from different [[Point of view (literature)|perspectives]], and trying to explain, often with reference to a model or theory from the subject.)

In [[sociology of religion]], '''religious capital''' is the investment an individual makes into their [[Faith|religious faith]]. The investment is the time and physical work involved with the religious faith, as well as the personal investment in ideology, doctrine, and practice.&lt;ref&gt;Stark, R. (2007). The Victory of Reason: how Christianity led to freedom, capitalism, and Western success. Random House.[https://books.google.com/books?id=EPkWXgokYLgC&amp;pg=PR56&amp;dq=%22religious+capital%22+stark&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=p3w1UdL5NsbJyAGnooHQAg&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22religious%20capital%22%20stark&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Rodney Stark]] has defined it as "(the) degree of mastery of and attachment to a particular religious culture", and has used this theory to explain conversion experiences in a number of his books, notably ''The Victory of Reason: How Christianity Led to Freedom, Capitalism, and Western Success '' and ''The Rise of Christianity: How the Obscure, Marginal Jesus Movement Became the Dominant Religious Force''.&lt;ref&gt;Park, J. Z., &amp; Baker, J. (2007). What would Jesus buy: American consumption of religious and spiritual material goods. Journal for the scientific study of religion, 46(4), 501-517.[https://www.academia.edu/366064/What_Would_Jesus_Buy_American_Consumption_of_Religious_and_Spiritual_Material_Goods]&lt;/ref&gt;  Within the realm of conversion, religious capital theory predicts that individuals will attempt to conserve their religious capital.  Large doctrinal or behavioral changes lose more religious capital than small ones, thus an [[Anglicanism|Episcopalian]] is more likely to become [[Catholic]] than [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] or [[Lutheran]].&lt;ref&gt;Lechner, F.

London: Sage, 81-97.[http://www.sociology.emory.edu/flechner/Rational%20Choice%20and%20Religious%20Economies.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; More recent work is inclined to define the concept in terms of Bourdieu's conception of 'capital' in relation to a particular (religious) field.&lt;ref&gt;McKinnon, AM., Trzebiatowska, M. &amp; Brittain, CC.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38293">'''Rhetoric of science''' is a body of [[academic publishing|scholarly literature]] exploring the notion that the practice of [[science]] is a [[rhetoric]]al activity. It emerged following a number of similarly-oriented disciplines during the late 20th century, including the disciplines of [[sociology of scientific knowledge]], [[history of science]], and [[philosophy of science]], but it is practiced most fully by rhetoricians in departments of English, speech, and communication.

==Overview==
[[Rhetoric]] is best known as a discipline that studies the means and ends of [[persuasion]]. Science, meanwhile, is typically seen as the discovery and recording of [[knowledge]] about the natural world. A key contention of rhetoric of science is that the practice of science is, to varying degrees, persuasive. The study of science from this viewpoint variously examines modes of inquiry, logic, [[argumentation]], the [[ethos]] of scientific practitioners, the structures of scientific publications, and the character of scientific discourse and debates.

For instance, scientists must convince their community of scientists that their research is based on sound scientific method. From a rhetorical point of view, [[scientific method]] involves problem-solution ''[[Rhetoric topos|topoi]]'' (the materials of discourse) that demonstrate observational and experimental competence (arrangement or order of discourse or method), and as a means of persuasion, offer explanatory and [[predictive power]].&lt;ref name=Prelli&gt;[[Lawrence J. Prelli]] (1989) ''A Rhetoric of Science: Inventing Scientific Discourse'', [[University of South Carolina Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp| 185-193}} Experimental competence is itself a persuasive ''topos''.&lt;ref name=Prelli/&gt;{{rp|186}} Rhetoric of science is a practice of suasion that is an outgrowth of some of the [[Rhetoric#Canons|canons of rhetoric]].

==History==
Since 1970, rhetoric of science, as a field involving rhetoricians, flourished. This flourishing of scholarly activity contributed to a shift in the image of science that was taking place.&lt;ref name=HIL/&gt;{{rp|xv}} A conservative approach to rhetoric of science involves treating texts as communications designed to persuade members of scientific communities. This approach concerns scientific claims that are already considered true as a result of the scientific process rather than the rhetorical process. A more radical approach, on the other hand, would treat these same texts as if the science held within them is also an object of rhetorical scrutiny.&lt;ref name=GrE/&gt;{{rp|622,3}} Among those in the conservative camp, who view science texts as vehicles of communication, are [[Charles Bazerman]], [[John Angus Campbell]], Greg Myers, Jean Dietz Moss, [[Lawrence J. Prelli]], Carolyn Miller and Jeanne Fahnestock. Bazerman's close readings of works by Newton and Compton as well as his analysis of the reading habits of physicists and others led to a greater understanding of the successes and failures of communication.&lt;ref name=GrE&gt;[[Alan G. Gross]] (1996) "Rhetoric of Science", ''Encyclopedia of Rhetoric and Composition: Communication from Ancient Times to the Information Age''. New York: [[Garland Publishing]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|623,4}} For a depiction of the views of the more radical camp, see the section titled "Critique of Rhetoric of Science".

The history of the rhetoric of science effectively begins with [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s seminal work, ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1962). He examines first normal science, that is, a practice which he saw as routine, patterned and accessible with a specific method of problem-solving. Building on past knowledge, normal science advances by accretions in a [[knowledge base]].&lt;ref name=HIL/&gt;{{rp|xiii}} Kuhn then contrasts normal science with revolutionary science (ground-breaking science marked by a paradigm-shift in thought). When Kuhn began to teach Harvard undergraduates historical texts such as Aristotle's writings on motion, he looked to case studies, and sought first to understand Aristotle in his own time, and then to locate his problems and solutions within a wider context of contemporary thought and actions.
&lt;ref name=Nick&gt;Nickles, Thomas (2003) "Normal Science: From Logic to Case-Based and Model-Based Reasoning", in ''Thomas Kuhn'', edited by Thomas Nickles, [[Cambridge University Press]] {{ISBN|0-521-79648-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|144}} That is to say, Kuhn sought first to understand the traditions and established practices of science.&lt;ref name=Nick/&gt;{{rp|162}} In this instance, [[Michael Polanyi]]'s influence on Kuhn becomes apparent; that is, his acknowledgement of the importance of inherited practices and rejection of absolute objectivity. Observing the changes in scientific thought and practices, Kuhn concluded that revolutionary changes happen through the defining notion of rhetoric: [[persuasion]].&lt;ref name=HIL&gt;Harris, Randy Allen (1997) "Introduction", ''Landmark Essays on Rhetoric of Science: Case Studies'', editor Randy Allen Harris, Mahwah: Hermagoras Press&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xiv}} The critical work of Herbert W. Simons – "Are Scientists Rhetors in Disguise?" in ''Rhetoric in Transition'' (1980) – and subsequent works show that Kuhn's ''Structure'' is fully rhetorical.

The work of Thomas Kuhn was extended by [[Richard Rorty]] (1979, 1989), and this work was to prove fruitful in defining the means and ends of rhetoric in scientific discourse (Jasinski "Intro" xvi). Rorty, who coined the phrase "rhetorical turn", was also interested in assessing periods of scientific stability and instability.

Another component of the shift in science that took place in the past centres on the claim that there is no single scientific method, but rather a plurality of methods, approaches or styles.&lt;ref name=HIL/&gt;{{rp|xvi}} [[Paul Feyerabend]] in ''[[Against Method]]'' (1975) contends that science has found no "method that turns ideologically contaminated ideas into true and useful theories", in other words; no special method exists that can guarantee the success of science (302).

As evidenced in the early theory papers after Kuhn's seminal work, the idea that rhetoric is crucial to science came to the fore. Quarterly journals in speech and rhetoric saw a flourishing of discussion on topics such as inquiry, [[logic]], argument fields, [[ethos]] of scientific practitioners, argumentation, scientific text, and the character of scientific [[discourse]] and debates. Philip Wander (1976) observed, for instance, the phenomenal penetration of science (public science) in modern life. He labelled the obligation of rhetoricians to investigate science's discourse "The Rhetoric of Science" (Harris "Knowing" 164).

As rhetoric of science began to flourish, discussion arose in a number of areas, including:
* Epistemic rhetoric and the discourses on the nature of semantics, knowledge, and truth: One example is the Robert L. Scott's work on viewing rhetoric as epistemic (1967). By the 1990s, [[epistemic]] rhetoric was a point of contention in the writing of Dilip Gaonkar (see "Critique" below).
* The early 1970s Speech Communication Conference ("Wingspread conference") gave recognition to the fact that rhetoric, in its globalization (multidisciplinary nature), has become a universal [[hermeneutic]] (Gross ''Rhetorical'' 2-5). Much scholastic output evolved around the theory of interpretation (hermeneutics), the knowledge-making and truth-seeking (epistemic) potential of rhetoric of science.
* Argument Fields (part of the Speech Communication Association and American forensic Association program): In this domain the work of [[Stephen Toulmin|Toulmin]] on argument appeals is exemplary. In addition, Michael Mulkay, Barry Barnes and David Bloor, as pioneers of the "[[Sociology of Scientific Knowledge]]" (SSK) movement, fostered a growing sociobiology debate. Others as Greg Myers expressed the benefits of a collaboration between rhetoricians and sociologists. Contributors to discussion pertaining to audience – the way arguments change as they move from the scientific community to the public – include John Lyne and Henry Howe.&lt;ref name=HIL/&gt;{{rp|xxi-xxxii}}
* Scientific Giants: The important works that investigate the suasive powers of exemplars in science include those of Alan Gross&lt;ref&gt;Gross, Alan G. (1990) ''The Rhetoric of Science'', [[Harvard University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Isaac Newton|Newton]], [[Descartes]], argument fields in optics), John Angus Campbell&lt;ref&gt;[[John Angus Campbell]] (1989) [http://www.arts.uwaterloo.ca/~raha/309CWeb/Campbell%281989%29.pdf The Invisible Rhetorician: Charles Darwin’s Third Party Strategy], ''The Rhetorician'' 7(1): 55–85, via [[University of Waterloo]]&lt;/ref&gt; (Darwin), and Michael Halloran (Watson and Crick). [[J. C. Maxwell]] introduced [[differentiable function|differentiable]] [[vector field]]s ''E'' and ''B'' to express [[Michael Faraday]]'s findings about an [[electric field]] ''E'' and a [[magnetic field]] ''B''. Thomas K. Simpson has described his rhetorical methods, first with a guided study,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas K. Simpson (1997) ''Maxwell on the Electromagnetic Field: a guided study'', [[Rutgers University Press]] {{ISBN|0-8135-2362-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; then a literary appreciation&lt;ref&gt;T. K. Simpson (2005) ''Figures of Thought, a literary appreciation of Maxwell’s Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism'', Green Lion Press&lt;/ref&gt; of ''[[A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism]]'' (1873), and with a book attending to the mathematical rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;T. K. Simpson (2010) ''Maxwell’s Mathematical Rhetoric: rethinking the Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism'', Green Lion Press, {{ISBN|978-1-888009-36-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other major themes in rhetoric of science include the investigation of the accomplishments and suasive abilities of individuals (ethos) who have left a mark in their respective sciences as well as an age old concern of rhetoric of science – public science policy. Science policy involves deliberative issues, and the first rhetorical study of science policy was made in 1953 by [[Richard M. Weaver]]. Among others, [[Helen Longino]]'s work on public policy implications of low-level radiation continues this tradition.&lt;ref name=GrE/&gt;{{rp|622}}

The reconstitution of rhetorical theory around the lines of invention ([[inventio]]), [[argumentation]] and stylistic adaptation is going on today (Simons 6). The key question today is whether training in rhetoric can in fact help scholars and investigators make intelligent choices between rival theories, methods or data collection, and incommensurate values (Simons 14).

==Developments and trends==

===Epistemic rhetoric===
Seeing science from the point of texts exhibiting [[epistemology]] based on prediction and control offers new comprehensive ways to see the function of rhetoric of science (Gross "The Origin" 91-92). Epistemic rhetoric of science, in a broader context, confronts issues pertaining to [[truth]], [[relativism]], and knowledge.

Rhetoric of science, as a branch of inquiry, does not look at scientific (natural science) texts as a transparent means of conveying knowledge, but rather it looks at these texts as exhibiting persuasive structures. Although the natural sciences and humanities differ in a fundamental way, the enterprise of science can be viewed hermeneutically as a stream of texts which exhibit an epistemology based on understanding (Gross "On the Shoulders 21). Its task then is the rhetorical reconstruction of the means by which scientists convince themselves and others that their knowledge claims and assertions are an integral part of privileged activity of the community of thinkers with which they are allied (Gross "The Origin" 91).

In an article titled "On Viewing Rhetoric as Epistemic" (1967), Robert L. Scott offers "that truth can arise only from cooperative critical inquiry" (Harris "Knowing" 164). Scott's probe of the issues of belief, knowledge and argumentation substantiates that rhetoric is epistemic. This [[train of thought]] goes back to Gorgias who noted that truth is a product of discourse, not a substance added to it (Harris "Knowing" 164).

Scientific discourse is built on accountability of empirical fact which is presented to a scientific community. Each form of communication is a type of genre that fosters human interaction and relations. An example is the emerging form of the experimental report ([[Charles Bazerman|Bazerman]] "Reporting" 171-176). The suite of [[genres]] to which the rhetoric of science comes to bear on health care and scientific communities is legion.

Aristotle could never accept the unavailability of certain knowledge, although most now believe the contrary (Gross "On Shoulders" 20). That is to say, Aristotle would have rejected the central concern of rhetoric of science: knowledge.&lt;ref name=GrE/&gt;{{rp|622}} Knowing itself generates the explanation of knowing, and this is the domain of the [[epistemology|theory of knowledge]]. The knowledge of knowledge compels an attitude of vigilance against the temptation of certainty ([[Humberto Maturana|Maturana]] 239-245).

The claim of the epistemic problematic of rhetoric of science concerns:
* truth - property of statements with respect to other statements
* knowledge - configuration of mutually supporting true statements
* arguments - are situational (first principle of rhetoric)
(Harris "Knowing" 180-181).

===Argument fields===
By the 1980s, [[Stephen Toulmin|Stephen Toulmin's]] work on argument fields published in his book titled ''[[The Uses of Argument]]'' (1958) came to prominence through rhetorical societies such as the Speech Communication Association which adopted a sociological view of science. Toulmin's main contribution is his notion of argument fields that saw a reinvention of the rhetorical concept [[rhetoric topos|topoi]] (topics).&lt;ref name=HIL/&gt;{{rp|xxi}}

Toulmin discusses at length the pattern of an [[argument]] – data and warrants to support a claim – and how they tend to vary across argument fields (Toulmin 1417-1422). He delineated two concepts of argumentation, one which relied on universal (field-invariant) appeals and strategies, and one which was field dependent, particular to disciplines, movements, and the like. For Toulmin, audience is important because one speaks to a particular audience at a particular point in time, and thus an argument must be relevant to that audience. In this instance, Toulmin echoes [[Paul Feyerabend|Feyerabend]], who in his preoccupation with suasive processes, makes clear the adaptive nature of [[persuasion]].&lt;ref name=HIL/&gt;{{rp|xxv}}

Toulmin's ideas pertaining to argument were a radical import to [[argumentation theory]] because, in part, he contributes a model, and because he contributes greatly to rhetoric and its subfield, rhetoric of science, by providing a model of analysis (data, warrants) to show that what is argued on a subject is in effect a structured ''arrangement'' of values that are purposive and lead to a certain line of thought.

Toulmin showed in ''Human Understanding'' that the arguments that would support claims as different as the Copernican revolution and the Ptolemaic revolution would not require mediation. On the strength of argument, men of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries converted to Copernican astronomy (Gross "The Rhetoric" 214).

===Incommensurability===
The rhetorical challenge today is to find discourse that crosses disciplines without sacrificing the specifics of each discipline. The aim is to render description of these disciplines intact – that is to say, the goal of finding language that would make various scientific fields "commensurable" (Baake 29). In contrast, incommensurability is a situation where two scientific programs are fundamentally at odds. Two important voices who applied incommensurability to historical and philosophical notions of science in the 1960s are [[Thomas Kuhn]] and [[Paul Feyerabend]]. Various strands grew out of this idea that bear on issues of communication and invention. These strands are explicated in Randy Allen Harris's four-part [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] that in turn foregrounds his viewpoint that "incommensurability is best understood not as a relation between systems, but as a matter of rhetorical invention and hermeneutics" (Harris "Incommensurability" 1).

[[Commensurability (philosophy of science)|Incommensurability]] of theory at times of radical theory change is at the heart of Thomas Samuel Kuhn's theory of [[paradigms]] ([[Bazerman]] 1). Kuhn's ''Structure of Scientific Revolutions'' offers a vision of scientific change that involves persuasion, and thus he brought rhetoric to the heart of scientific studies.&lt;ref name=HIL/&gt;{{rp|xiii}}

Kuhn's ''Structure'' provides important accounts related to the concept representation, and the key conceptual changes that occur during a [[scientific revolution]]. Kuhn sought to determine ways of representing [[concept]]s and taxonomies by frames.&lt;ref name=BXA&gt;Barker, Peter, Xiang Chen and Hanne Andersen (2003) "Kuhn on Concepts and Categorization" in ''Thomas Kuhn'', edited by Thomas Nickles, Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|224-230}} Kuhn's work attempts to show that incommensurable paradigms can be rationally compared by revealing the compatibility of attribute lists of say a species outlined in a pre-Darwinian and a post-Darwinian milieu accounted for in two incommensurable taxonomies, and that this compatibility is the platform for rational comparison between rival taxonomies.&lt;ref name=BXA/&gt;{{rp|230,1}} With a view to comparing normal science to revolutionary science, Kuhn illustrates his theory of paradigms and theory of concepts within the history of electricity, chemistry and other disciplines. He gives attention to the revolutionary changes that came about as a result of the work of [[Copernicus]], [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], [[Einstein]], [[Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen|Roentgen]], and [[Lavoisier]].

Some scholars, like Thomas C. Walker, feel that Kuhn's theory on paradigms leads to knowledge that is "gained in small, incremental, and almost unremarkable installments." Walker states that while "normal science is narrow, rigid, esoteric, uncritical, and conservative, Kuhn considers it to be the most efficient way to ensure a cumulation of knowledge." According to Walker, while "ignorance and intolerance toward other theoretical frameworks are regrettable features of Kuhn's normal science...meaningful conversations can only occur within a single paradigm."&lt;ref name="test"&gt;Walker, Thomas C. (2010) "The perils of paradigm mentalities: Revisiting Kuhn, Lakatos, and Popper", [[Perspectives on Politics]] 8.02: 433-451&lt;/ref&gt;	

Kuhn's work was influential for rhetoricians, sociologists, and historians (and, in a more muted way, philosophers) for the development of a rhetorical perspective. His view on perception, concept acquisition and language suggest, according to Paul Hoyningen-Huene's analysis of Kuhn's philosophy, a cognitive perspective.&lt;ref name=Nick/&gt;{{rp|183}}

===Ethos===
Scientists are not just persuaded by [[logos]] or argument. Innovative initiatives in science test scientific authority by invoking the authority of past results (initial section of a scientific paper) and the authority of procedure, which establish the scientist's credibility as an investigator (Gross ''Starring'' 26-27).

Examinations of the [[ethos]] of scientists (individually and collectively) spawned significant contributions in the field of rhetoric of science. Michael Halloran notes in "The Birth of Molecular Biology" (''Rhetoric Review'' 3, 1984) – an essay that is a rhetorical analysis of [[James D. Watson]] and Francis H. Crick's "A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid" – that a large part of what constitutes a scientific paradigm is the ethos of its practitioners. This ethos is about an attitude and a way of attacking problems and propagating claims.&lt;ref name=HIL/&gt;{{rp|xxxi}}

In "The Rhetorical Construction of Scientific Ethos," Lawrence Prelli provides a systematic analysis of ethos as a tool of scientific legitimation. Prelli's work examines the exchange of information in the court of public opinion. His work provides insight into the ways in which scientific argumentation is legitimized, and thus insight into public science policy. One of the domains of rhetoric is civic life. Rhetorical criticism of science offers much in the investigation of scientific matters that impinge directly upon public opinion and policy-making decisions.&lt;ref name=HIL/&gt;{{rp|xxxiii}}

===Rhetoric and language-games===
Rhetoric can also be defined as ''the strategic use of language'': each scientist tries to make those statements that - given the statements made by their colleagues, and the ones the former expects they will do in the future (e.g., accepting or rejecting the claims made by the former) - maximise the chances of the former's attaining the goals he or she has. So, [[game theory]] can be applied to study the choice of the claims one scientist makes. Zamora Bonilla (2006) argues that, when rhetoric is understood this way, it can be discussed whether the way scientists interact - e.g., through certain scientific institutions like peer review - leads them to make their claims in an efficient or an inefficient way, i.e., whether the 'rhetorical games' are more analogous to '[[invisible hand]]' processes, or to '[[prisoner's dilemma]]' games. If the former is the case, then we can assert that scientific 'conversation' is organised in such a way that the strategic use of language by scientists leads them to reach cognitive progress, and if the opposite is the case, then this would be an argument to reform scientific institutions.

===Rhetorical figures in science===
Corresponding to distinct lines of reasoning, figures of speech are evident in scientific arguments. The same cognitive and verbal skills that are of service to one line of inquiry – political, economic or popular – are of service to science (Fahnestock 43). This implies that there is less of a division between science and the humanities than initially anticipated. Argumentatively useful figures of speech are found everywhere in scientific writing.

[[Theodosius Dobzhansky]] in ''[[Genetics and the Origin of Species]]'' offers a means of reconciliation between Mendelian mutation and Darwinian [[natural selection]]. By remaining sensitive to the interests of naturalists and geneticists, Dobzhansky – through a subtle strategy of [[polysemy]] – allowed a peaceful solution to a battle between two scientific territories. His expressed aim was to review the genetic information bearing on the problem of organic diversity.&lt;ref name=ccc&gt;{{cite book |last= Ceccarelli |first= Leah |title= Shaping Science with Rhetoric: The Cases of Dobzhansky, Schrödinger, and Wilson |publisher= [[University of Chicago Press]] |year= 2001 |isbn= 0226099067 |oclc= 45276826 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|41, 53}} The building blocks of Dobzhansky's interdisciplinary influence that saw much development in two scientific camps were the result of the compositional choices he made. He uses, for instance, prolepsis to make arguments that introduced his research findings, and he provided a metaphoric map as a means to guide his audience.&lt;ref name=ccc/&gt;{{rp|57,8}} One illustration of metaphor is his use of the term "adaptive landscapes." Seen metaphorically, this term is a way of representing how theorists in two different fields can unite.&lt;ref name=ccc/&gt;{{rp|57}}

Another figure that is important as an aid to understanding and knowledge is [[antimetabole]] (refutation by reversal). [[Antithesis]] also works toward a similar end.

An example of antimetabole:
* Antimetabole often appears in writing or visuals where the line of inquiry and experiment has been characterized by mirror-image objects, or of complementarity, reversible or equilibrium processes. Louis Pasteur's revelation that many organic compounds come in left-and right-handed versions or isomers as articulated at an 1883 lecture illustrates the use of this figure. He argues in lecture that "life is the germ and the germ is life" because all life contains unsymmetrical/asymmetrical processes (Fahnestock 137-140).

===New Materialist Rhetoric of Science===
A more recent trend in rhetorical studies involves participation in the broader [[Speculative realism|new materialist]] movement in philosophy and [[Science, technology and society|science and technology studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Herndl|first1=Carl|title=Rhetoric of Science as Non-Modern Practice|date=2000|publisher=Professing Rhetoric: Selected Papers from the 2000 Rhetoric Society of America Conference|pages=215–222}}&lt;/ref&gt; This emerging area of inquiry investigates the role of rhetoric and discourse as an integral part of the [[Materiality (science)| Materialism]] of scientific practice. This approach considers how the methods of natural sciences came into being, and the particular role interaction among scientists and scientific institutions has to play. New materialist rhetoric of science of a feminist variety include those proponents see the progress of the natural sciences as having been purchased at a high cost, a cost that limits the scope and vision of science. Work in this area often draws on scholarship by [[Bruno Latour]], [[Steve Woolgar]], [[Annemarie Mol]], and other new materialist scholars from science and technology studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lynch and Rivers, Eds.|title=Thinking with Bruno Latour in Rhetoric and Composition|date=2015|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work in new materialist rhetoric of science tends to be very critical of a perceived over-reliance on language in more conservative variants of rhetoric of science and has significantly criticized long-standing areas of inquiry such as incommensurability studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Graham &amp; Herndl|title=Multiple Ontologies in Pain Management: Towards a Postplural Rhetoric of Science|journal=Technical Communication Quarterly|volume=22|pages=103–125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critique of rhetoric of science===

====Globalization of rhetoric====
Renewed interest today in rhetoric of science is its positioning as a [[hermeneutic]] meta-discourse rather than a substantive discourse practice.&lt;ref name=Gaon/&gt;{{rp|25}} [[Exegesis]] and hermeneutics are the tools around which the idea of scientific production has been forged.

Criticism of rhetoric of science is mainly limited to discussions around the concept of hermeneutics, which can be seen as follows:
* Rhetorical hermeneutics is about a way of reading texts as rhetoric. Rhetoric is both a discipline and a perspective from which disciplines can be viewed. As a discipline, it has a hermeneutic task and generates knowledge; as a perspective, it has the task of generating new points of view (Gross ''Rhetorical'' 111). Whether rhetorical theory can function as a general hermeneutic, a key to all texts, including scientific texts, is still today a point of interest to rhetoricians. Although [[natural sciences]] and [[humanities]] differ in fundamental ways, science as enterprise can be viewed hermeneutically as a suite of texts exhibiting a study of knowledge (epistemology) based on understanding (Gross "On Shoulders" 21).

A recent critique about the rhetoric of science literature asks not if science is understood properly, but rather if rhetoric is understood properly. This dissension centres around the reading of scientific texts rhetorically; it is a quarrel about how rhetorical theory is seen as a global hermeneutic (Gross "Intro" ''Rhetorical'' 1-13).

[[Dilip Gaonkar]] in "The Idea of Rhetoric in the Rhetoric of Science" looks at how critics argue about rhetoric, and he unfolds the global ambitions of rhetorical theory as a general hermeneutic (a master key to all texts), with the rhetoric of science as a perfect site of analysis - a hard and fast case.&lt;ref name=Gaon&gt;[[Dilip Gaonkar]] (1997) "The Idea of Rhetoric in the Rhetoric of Science." In ''Rhetorical Hermeneutics: Invention and Interpretation in the Age of Science''. Eds. Alan G. Gross and William M. Keith, [[State University of New York Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his analysis of this 'case', Gaonkar looks at rhetoric's essential character first in traditional sense (Aristotilean and Ciceronian). Then he looked at the practice of rhetoric and the model of persuasive speech from the point of agency (productive orientation) or who controls the speech (means of communication). The rhetorical tradition is one of practice, while the theory evinces practice and teaching (Gross "Intro" ''Rhetorical'' 6-11). Gaonkar asserts that rhetoric seen as a tradition (Aristotilean and Ciceronia), and from the point of view of interpretation (not production or agency), rhetorical theory is "thin." He argues that rhetoric appears as a thinly veiled language of criticism in such a way that it is applicable to almost any discourse.&lt;ref name=Gaon/&gt;{{rp|33, 69}}

Gaonkar believes that this type of globalization of rhetoric undermines rhetoric's self-representation as a situated practical art, and in so doing, it runs counter to a humanist tradition. It runs counter to the interpretative function of a critical metadiscourse. If there is no more substance, no anchor, no reference to which rhetoric is attached, rhetoric itself is the substance, or the supplement, and thus becomes substantial, giving rise to the question how well rhetoric functions as interpretative [[discourse]].&lt;ref name=Gaon/&gt;{{rp|77}}

Dilip Gaonkar's provocations have successfully opened the way to a broad reaching discussion that led to the defense of rhetoric analyses of scientific discourse. Responses to Gaonkar's provocations are many, of which two examples follow.
* When Gaonkar asks if a theory grounded in practice can be translated into a theory of interpretation, Michael Leff in "The Idea of Rhetoric as Interpretative Practice: A Humanist's Response to Gaonkar" see his views as too extreme, treating as opposites two positions that are in dialectic tension (rhetoric as production and rhetoric as interpretation), and separating interpretation from practice in order to establish a causal, rather than accidental, relationship between rhetoric and the globalalization of rhetoric (Gross "Intro" ''Rhetorical'' 11).
* [[John Angus Campbell]] in "Strategic Readings: Rhetoric, Intention, and Interpretation" also found in ''Rhetorical Hermeneutics'' is a verification of Leff's analysis (113). He argues, however, against Gaonkar's notion of invention and the mediation between producer or writer and the audience of a text(114). The differences between Campbell and Gaonkar is one of theory, and not whether agency figures in criticism (115).

====New Materialist Rhetoric of Science====
The new materialist approach to rhetoric of science has endorsed Goankar's criticisms of rhetoric of science more generally and seeks to overcome them through interdisciplinary engagement with science and technology studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graham|first1=S. Scott|title=The Politics of Pain Medicine: A Rhetorical-Ontological Inquiry|date=2015|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the new materialist approach, itself, has been subjected to significant criticism within the field, and identified as a radical variant. The question as to the adequacy of rhetoric in its encounter with scientific texts (natural sciences) is problematic on two fronts. The first concerns traditional rhetoric and its capacity as a tool to analyze scientific texts. Secondly, the answer to the question relies on an attack of the epistomological presuppositions of a classical rhetoric of science. For this reason, the radical critique is a call for the renewal of rhetorical theory.&lt;ref name=GrE/&gt;{{rp|626,7}}

The '''School for Advanced Research (SAR)''', until 2007 known as the '''School of American Research''' and founded in 1907 as the '''School for American Archaeology''' (SAA), is an advanced [[research center]] located in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], USA. Since 1967, the scope of the school's activities has embraced a global perspective through programs to encourage advanced scholarship in [[anthropology]] and related [[social science]] disciplines and the [[humanities]], and to facilitate the work of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] scholars and artists. SAR offers residential fellowships for artists and scholars, and it publishes academic and popular non-fiction books through SAR Press.

== Foundation ==
[[File:Edgar lee hewett1.jpg|thumb|[[Edgar Lee Hewett]], president of [[New Mexico Highlands University|New Mexico Normal University]] in 1898]]
In the early years of the 20th century, [[archaeology]] was a young discipline with roots in historical studies of [[Old World]] antiquities. In 1906 [[Alice Cunningham Fletcher]], an anthropologist and ethnographer of [[Plains Indian]] groups, was on the American Committee of the [[Archaeological Institute of America]]. The AIA, founded in Boston in 1879, had schools in [[Athens]], [[Rome]], and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] that sponsored research on classical civilization and promoted professional standards in archaeology. Fletcher wanted to establish an "Americanist" center to train students in the profession of archaeology, to engage in anthropological research in the Americas, and to preserve and study the unique cultural heritage of the [[American Southwest]]. 

Her goals coincided with those of [[Edgar Lee Hewett]], an educator and amateur archaeologist whom she met in [[Mexico]] in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;''A Peculiar Alchemy: A Centennial History of SAR,'' Nancy Owen Lewis and Kay Leigh Hagan, SAR Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The School of American Research: A History,'' Malinda Elliott, SAR Press, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;
Nicknamed "El Toro" (the bull), Hewett was a controversial figure.&lt;!-- Why? Don't say "controversial" if you don't intend to explain--&gt; He served as president of New Mexico Normal School in [[Las Vegas, New Mexico|Las Vegas]] (now [[New Mexico Highlands University]]) from 1898 to 1903, where he taught some of the first anthropology courses to be offered at any U.S. college. His work lobbying for the protection of archaeological sites led to the creation of [[Mesa Verde National Park]] and the passage of the U.S. [[Antiquities Act]] of 1906.

In December 1907, the American Committee of the AIA accepted Fletcher's plan to establish the School of American Archaeology. It appointed Hewett as director and Fletcher as the first chairperson of the School's managing committee.

== Early years ==
Santa Fe, then the capital of [[New Mexico Territory]], was chosen as the School of American Archaeology's headquarters in part because the territorial government offered the historic [[Palace of the Governors]] as a permanent home. In 1909, the legislature established the [[Museum of New Mexico]] as an agency of the School, creating a relationship that would continue for the next 50 years. Hewett became director of both the Museum and the School.&lt;ref&gt;''A Laboratory for Anthropology: Science and Romanticism in the American Southwest, 1846–1930,'' Don D. Fowler, UNM Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917, the School of American Archaeology changed its name to the School of American Research to reflect a broader mission:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"to promote and carry on research in Archaeology and related branches of the Science of Man; to foster Art in all its branches through exhibitions and by other means which may from time to time be desirable". (Articles of Incorporation 1917)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Ordaz Chaco Canyon.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Pueblo del Arroyo, [[Chaco Canyon]], New Mexico.]]
Midway through its first year of operations, the school was immersed in excavating Pueblo ruins on the eastern edge of the Pajarito Plateau, west of Santa Fe, and conducting the first of its field programs. Many legendary archaeologists, among them [[Neil Judd]], [[Alfred V. Kidder]], and [[Sylvanus Morley]], were trained at SAR field labs at Tyuonyi Ruin on El Rito de los Frijoles (now part of [[Bandelier National Monument]]), [[Chaco Canyon]], [[Puye Cliff Dwellings]], and other sites. The school also sponsored excavations in Mexico, Guatemala, and South America, and led the effort to preserve 22 Spanish missions in New Mexico. While directing the school, Hewett founded departments of anthropology at the [[University of Southern California]] and the [[University of New Mexico]].

Through the Museum of New Mexico, the school took an early interest in promoting and preserving the artistic traditions of Southwestern Indians. Indian workers assisted at the School's excavations on the Pajarito Plateau, and their interactions with Hewett, [[Kenneth M. Chapman]], and other archaeologists led to a recognition of individual talents and traditional aesthetics. Hewett and Chapman, an artist hired by Hewett to head the art department at New Mexico Normal School, and later one of the first employees of the School of American Archaeology, provided extensive support for Indian artists.  They offered studio facilities, as well as collecting and exhibiting their work. Early Native artists promoted by SAR included [[Maria Martinez]], Crescencio Martinez, [[Awa Tsireh]], and [[Fred Kabotie]], among many others.&lt;ref&gt;''Kenneth Chapman's Santa Fe: Artists and Archaeologists, 1907–1931,'' edited by Marit K. Munson, SAR Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, the school sponsored the first Southwest Indian Fair, precursor of today's world-renowned [[Santa Fe Indian Market]].

Hewett led the school and museum until his death in 1946 at age 82. A 20-year period of relative inactivity followed. The School continued to pursue archaeological research projects on a modest scale.  It was headed, successively, by Sylvanus Morley, Boaz Long, Wayne L. Mauzy, Edward Weyer, Jr., and Eugene McCluney. This transition period ended in 1959, when the State Legislature formally separated the [[Museum of New Mexico]] from the School. The School of American Research was gutted, left with a staff of two and an uncertain future.

== Rebuilding the school ==
In 1967, [[Douglas W. Schwartz]], a young professor of anthropology from the [[University of Kentucky]], became the new director of the School of American Research.  Schwartz broadened the school's focus to embrace advanced scholarship in anthropology and the humanities worldwide; and to promote the study, preservation, and creation of Southwest Indian art. Schwartz also continued the school's archaeological research with field excavations in the [[Grand Canyon]] in the late 1960s and, in the 1970s, the excavations of [[Arroyo Hondo Pueblo]].&lt;ref name="Arroyo Hondo Pueblo Project"&gt;http://www.arroyohondo.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Conrad et al. 2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Conrad | first1 = Cyler | last2=Jones |first2=Emily Lena | last3=Newsome |first3=Seth D. |last4=Schwartz |first4=Douglas W. | year= 2016 | title=Bone isotopes, eggshell and turkey husbandry at Arroyo Hondo Pueblo | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X1630267X | journal= Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports | doi=10.1016/j.jasrep.2016.06.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, SAR's offices had relocated from the Palace of the Governors to the Hewett House on Lincoln Street. In 1973, the school moved into an old adobe estate on Santa Fe's east side. ''El Delirio'' had been the home of Martha Root White and Amelia Elizabeth White. Built in the 1920s by [[William Penhallow Henderson]], the estate was a popular gathering place for Santa Fe artists, writers, and intellectuals—among them Hewett, Morley, and others associated with the school. The White sisters were avid promoters of Indian art, and together they opened the first Native American art gallery in New York City. Elizabeth also was a founding member of the [[Indian Arts Fund]] (IAF) in Santa Fe and sat on SAR's Board of Managers for 25 years. When Elizabeth died in 1972 at age 94, she left El Delirio and other Santa Fe properties to the School. In that same year, the IAF disbanded and deeded its collections of Southwest Indian art to the School.

The new campus, with its many buildings, permitted the realization of Schwartz's vision for the school. The Advanced Seminar Program was inaugurated in 1968, and has since sponsored more than 120 seminars, the results of which are published by the school's SAR Press. The Resident Scholar Program, launched in 1972, has provided over 180 scholars with residential fellowships.

The construction of the Indian Arts Research Center in 1978 gave the collections inherited from the IAF a suitable home. In 1988, the J. I. Staley Prize was established to recognize books by living authors that exemplify outstanding research in anthropology. Over the succeeding two decades, several residential fellowships for Native artists were also established.

== New century, new directions ==
In 2001, SAR was under a new president, Richard M. Leventhal, an archaeologist from UCLA who assumed leadership of the school on the retirement of Dr. Schwartz. During his three-year tenure at the School, Dr. Leventhal worked to revitalize SAR’s core programs and extend greater opportunities for scholars and visiting Native artists. Dr. Leventhal was succeeded in 2005 by Dr. James F. Brooks, formerly director of SAR Press. His term coincided with the school’s centennial in 2007, when SAR changed its name from the School of American Research to the School for Advanced Research, to better reflect the global reach of its support for scholarship in the social sciences and humanities. Some of the highlights of Brooks’s tenure include new initiatives such as the Campbell Program for Women Scholar Practitioners—which has supported women from Morocco, Ethiopia, and Kenya in developing strategies for women’s economic and social empowerment—and an emphasis on collaborative research and exhibition projects with Native peoples; monthly Sparks Talks on local history and culture; and a field trip program serving more than two hundred participants annually, visiting locations as near as Pecos National Monument and as far as the borderlands of southeastern Turkey.

When Brooks resigned his post in June 2013, SAR’s Board of Directors appointed Dr. David E. Stuart, an anthropologist and long-time teacher and senior administrator at the University of New Mexico, as interim president. In June 2014, Michael F. Brown assumed SAR’s presidency after shifting to emeritus status at Williams College, on whose faculty he had long served. Brown, a cultural anthropologist familiar with SAR from participation in two advanced seminars and a term as resident scholar, has published extensively on new religious movements, the indigenous peoples of South America, and global efforts to protect indigenous cultural property from appropriation and misuse.

== Current programs ==
The School for Advanced Research offers residential fellowships for scholars and Native artists, and internships are provided for Native students pursuing academic careers or professional careers in museums. The School also sponsors scholarly seminars through its Advanced Seminar and Short Seminar programs. The results of many of these programs are published through SAR Press.  The school recognizes outstanding books in anthropology with the annual [[J. I. Staley Prize]]. Public outreach includes membership, lecture, and tour and field trip programs.  SAR has created an educational website for New Mexico grade-school students.

'''Social comparison theory''', initially proposed by [[social psychologist]] [[Leon Festinger]] in 1954,&lt;ref name="Festinger1954"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Festinger L | year = 1954 | title = A theory of social comparison processes | url = | journal = Human Relations | volume = 7 | issue = 2| pages = 117–140 | doi=10.1177/001872675400700202}}&lt;/ref&gt; centers on the belief that there is a drive within individuals to gain accurate self-evaluations. The theory explains how individuals evaluate their own opinions and abilities by comparing themselves to others in order to reduce uncertainty in these domains, and learn how to define the self.

Following the initial theory, research began to focus on social comparison as a way of self-enhancement,&lt;ref name="Gruder1971"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gruder C.

(1959). The psychology of affiliation: Experimental studies of the sources of gregariousness (Vol. 1). Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Initial framework ==
In the initial theory, Festinger provided nine main hypotheses. 
First, he stated that humans have a basic drive to evaluate their opinions and abilities and that people evaluate themselves through objective, nonsocial means (Hypothesis I).&lt;ref name="Festinger1954" /&gt;
Second, Festinger stated that if objective, nonsocial means were not available, that people evaluate their opinions and abilities by comparison to other people (Hypothesis II).&lt;ref name="Festinger1954" /&gt; 
Next, he hypothesized that the tendency to compare oneself to another person decreases as the difference between their opinions and abilities becomes more divergent.&lt;ref name="Festinger1954" /&gt; In other words, if someone is much different from you, you are less likely to compare yourself to that person (Hypothesis III). 
He next hypothesized that there is a unidirectional drive upward in the case of abilities, which is largely absent in opinions.&lt;ref name="Festinger1954" /&gt; This drive refers to the value that is placed on doing better and better.&lt;ref name="Suls, J., Miller, R."&gt;Suls, J., Miller, R. (1977). "Social Comparison Processes: Theoretical and Empirical Perspectives". Hemisphere Publishing Corp., Washington D.C. {{ISBN|0-470-99174-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Hypothesis IV). 
Next, Festinger hypothesizes that there are non-social restraints that make it difficult or even impossible to change one's ability and these restraints are largely absent for opinions.&lt;ref name="Festinger1954" /&gt; In other words, people can change their opinions when they want to but no matter how motivated individuals may be to improve their ability, there may be other elements that make this impossible&lt;ref name="Suls, J., Miller, R." /&gt; (Hypothesis V). 
Festinger goes on to hypothesize that the cessation of comparison with others is accompanied by hostility or derogation to the extent that continued comparison with those persons implies unpleasant consequences (Hypothesis VI). 
Next, any factors which increase the importance of some particular group as a comparison group from some particular opinion or ability will increase the pressure toward uniformity concerning that ability or opinion within that group. If discrepancies arise between the evaluator and comparison group there is a tendency to reduce the divergence by either attempting to persuade others, or changing their personal views to attain uniformity. However, the importance, relevance and attraction to a comparison group that affects the original motivation for comparison, mediates the pressures towards uniformity (Hypothesis VII). 
His next hypothesis states that if persons who are very divergent from one's own opinion or ability are perceived as different from oneself on attributes consistent with the divergence, the tendency to narrow the range of comparability becomes stronger (Hypothesis VIII). 
Lastly, Festinger hypothesized that when there is a range of opinion or ability in a group, the relative strength of the three manifestations of pressures toward uniformity will be different for those who are close to the mode of the group than for those who are distant from the mode. Those close to the mode will have stronger tendencies to change the positions of others, weaker tendencies to narrow the range of comparison, and even weaker tendencies to change their own opinions (Hypothesis IX).&lt;ref name="Festinger1954" /&gt;

== Theoretical advances ==
Since its inception, the initial framework has undergone several advances. Key among these are developments in understanding the motivations that underlie social comparisons, and the particular types of social comparisons that are made. Motives that are relevant to social comparison include self-enhancement,&lt;ref name="Gruder1971" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wills1981" /&gt; maintenance of a positive self-evaluation,&lt;ref name="Tesser1982"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Tesser, A. |author2=Campbell, J.  | year = 1982 | title = Self-evaluation maintenance and the perception of friends and strangers. | journal = Journal of Personality | volume = 50 | issue = 3 | pages = 261–279 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1982.tb00750.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; components of attributions and validation,&lt;ref name="GoethalsDarley1977"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Goethals, G. R. |author2=Darley, J.  | year = 1977 | title = Social comparison theory: An attributional approach. | journal = Social Comparison Processes: Theoretical and Empirical Perspectives | pages = 86–109 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the avoidance of closure.&lt;ref name="Sulsetal2002"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Suls, J. |author2=Martin, R. |author3=Wheeler, L. | year = 2002 | title = Social comparison: Why, with whom, and with what effect?. | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 11| issue = 5 | pages = 159–163 | doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00191}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kruglanski1990"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kruglanski, A. W. |author2=Mayseless, O.  | year = 1990 | title = Classic and current social comparison research: Expanding the perspective. | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 108 | issue = 2 | pages = 195–208 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.108.2.195|citeseerx=10.1.1.336.1436  }}&lt;/ref&gt; While there have been changes in Festinger's original concept, many fundamental aspects remain, including the prevalence of the tendency towards social comparison and the general process that is social comparison.

=== Self-evaluation ===
According to Thorton and Arrowood, [[self-evaluation]] is one of the functions of social comparison. This is one process that underlies how an individual engages in social comparison.&lt;ref name="Thornton1966"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Thorton, D. |author2=Arrowood, A. J.  | year = 1966 | title = Self-evaluation, self-enhancement, and the locus of social comparison. | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 2 |issue=2  | pages = 591–605 | doi = 10.1016/0022-1031(69)90049-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each individual's specific goals will influence how they engage in social comparison. For self-evaluation, people tend to choose a comparison target that is similar to themselves.&lt;ref name="Wood1989"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wood, J. V. | year = 1989 | title = Theory and research concerning social comparisons of personal attributes. | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 106 | issue = 2 | pages = 231–248 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.106.2.231| citeseerx = 10.1.1.456.7776 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, they are most interested in choosing a target who shares some distinctive characteristic with themselves. Research suggests that most people believe that choosing a similar target helps ensure the accuracy of the self-evaluation.{{citation-needed|date=September 2018}} However, individuals do not always act as unbiased self-evaluators, and accurate self-evaluations may not be the primary goal of social comparison.

=== Self-enhancement ===
Individuals may also seek self-enhancement, or to improve their self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Wood1989" /&gt; They may interpret, distort, or ignore the information gained by social comparison to see themselves more positively and further their self-enhancement goals. They will also choose to make upward (comparing themselves to someone better off) or downward (comparing themselves to someone worse off) comparisons, depending on which strategy will further their self-enhancement goals. They may also avoid making comparisons period, or avoid making certain types of comparisons. Specifically, when an individual believes that their ability in a specific area is low, they will avoid making upward social comparisons in that area. Unlike for self-evaluation goals, people engaging in social comparison with the goal of self-enhancement may not seek out a target that is similar to themselves. In fact, if a target's similarity is seen as a threat, due to the target outperforming the individual on some dimension, the individual may downplay the similarity of the target to themselves. This notion ties closely to the phenomena in psychology introduced also by Leon Festinger himself as it relates to the diminishing of cognitive dissonance. One does not want to perceive oneself in a way which would downplay one's original belief upon which one's self-esteem is based and therefore in order to reduce the cognitive dissonance, one is willing to change the cognitive representation of the other person whom one compares oneself to, such that one's own belief about oneself remains intact. This effectively leads to the comparison of apples to oranges or psychological denial.

Later advances in theory led to [[self-enhancement]] being one of the four [[self-evaluation motives]]:, along with ''[[self-assessment]]'', ''[[self-verification]]'', and ''[[self-improvement]]''.

===Upward and downward social comparisons===
Wills introduced the concept of downward comparison in 1981.&lt;ref name="Wills1981" /&gt; Downward social comparison is a defensive tendency that is used as a means of self-evaluation.  When a person looks to another individual or group that they consider to be worse off than themselves in order to feel better about their self or personal situation, they are making a downward social comparison. Research has suggested that social comparisons with others who are better off or superior, or upward comparisons, can lower self-regard,&lt;ref name="Tesser1988"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Tesser, A. |author2=Millar, M. |author3=Moore, J.  | year = 1988 | title = Some affective consequences of social comparison and reflection processes: the pain and pleasure of being close. | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 54 | issue = 1 | pages = 49–61 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.54.1.49 |pmid=3346807 }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas downward comparisons can elevate self-regard.&lt;ref name="Gibbons1986"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gibbons, F. X.| year = 1986 | title = Social comparison and depression: Company's effect on misery. | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 51 | issue = 1 | pages = 140–148 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.51.1.140 | pmid = 3735064 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Downward comparison theory emphasizes the positive effects of comparisons in increasing one's subjective well-being.&lt;ref name="Wills1981" /&gt; For example, it has been found that breast cancer patients made the majority of comparisons with patients less fortunate than themselves.&lt;ref name="Woodetal1985"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wood, J. V. |author2=Taylor, S. E. |author3=Lichtman, R. R.  | year = 1985 | title = Social comparison in adjustment to breast cancer. | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 49 | issue = 5 | pages = 1169–1183 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.49.5.1169 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although social comparison research has suggested that upward comparisons can lower self-regard, Collins indicates that this is not always the case.&lt;ref name="Collins1995"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Collins, R. L. | year = 1995 | title = For better or worse: The impact of upward social comparison on self-evaluations. | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 119 | issue = 1 | pages = 51–69 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.119.1.51 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals make upward comparisons, whether consciously or subconsciously, when they compare themselves with an individual or comparison group that they perceive as superior or better than themselves in order to improve their views of self or to create a more positive perception of their personal reality.  Upward social comparisons are made to self-evaluate and self-improve in the hopes that self-enhancement will also occur. In an upward social comparison, people want to believe themselves to be part of the elite or superior, and make comparisons highlighting the similarities between themselves and the comparison group, unlike a downward social comparison, where similarities between individuals or groups are disassociated.&lt;ref name="Sulsetal2002" /&gt;

It has also been suggested that upward comparisons may provide an inspiration to improve, and in one study it was found that while breast cancer patients made more downward comparisons, they showed a preference for information about more fortunate others.&lt;ref name="Taylor1989"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Taylor, S. E. |author2=Lobel, M.  | year = 1989 | title = Social comparison activity under threat: Downward evaluation and upward contacts. | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 96 | issue = 4 | pages = 569–575 | doi = 10.1037/0033-295X.96.4.569 | pmid=2678204|citeseerx=10.1.1.318.5713  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study indicated that people who were dieting often used upward social comparisons by posting pictures of thinner people on their refrigerators.&lt;ref name="Collins1995" /&gt; These pictures served as not only a reminder of an individuals current weight, but also as an inspiration of a goal to be reached. In simple terms, downward social comparisons are more likely to make us feel better about ourselves, while upward social comparisons are more likely to motivate us to achieve more or reach higher.

===Moderators of social comparison===
Aspinwall and Taylor looked at mood, self-esteem, and threat as moderators that drive individuals to choose to make upward or downward social comparisons.&lt;ref name="Aspinwall1993"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Aspinwall, L. G. |author2=Taylor, S. E.  | year = 1993 | title = Effects of social comparison direction, threat, and self-esteem on affect, self-evaluation, and expected success. | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 64 | issue = 5 | pages = 708–722 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.64.5.708 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Downward comparisons in cases where individuals had experienced a threat to their self-esteem produced more favorable self-evaluations.

====High self-esteem and social comparison====
Aspinwall and Taylor found that upward social comparisons were good in circumstances where the individuals making the comparisons had high self-esteem, because these types of comparisons provided them with more motivation and hope than downward social comparisons.&lt;ref name="Aspinwall1993" /&gt; However, if these individuals had experienced a recent threat or setback to their self-esteem, they reported that upward comparisons resulted in a more negative affect than downward comparisons.

====Low self-esteem and social comparison====
However, people with low self-esteem or people who are experiencing some sort of threat in their life (such as doing poorly in school, or suffering from an illness) tend to favor downward comparisons over upward comparisons. People with low self-esteem and negative affect improve their mood by making downward comparisons. Their mood does not improve as much as it would if they had high self-esteem. Even for people with low self-esteem, these downward social comparisons do improve their negative mood and allow them to feel hope and motivation for their future.

====Affect/mood and its effect on social comparison====
Individuals who have a negative mood improve their mood by making upward social comparisons, regardless of their level of self-esteem. In addition, both individuals with high self-esteem and low self-esteem who are in a positive mood elevate their mood further by making upward comparisons. However, for those who have recently experienced a threat to their self-esteem or a setback in their life, making upward social comparisons instead of downward social comparisons results in a more negative affect. Self-esteem and existence of a threat or setback in an individual's life are two moderators of their response to upward or downward comparisons.

=== Competitiveness ===
Because individuals are driven upwards in the case of abilities, social comparisons can drive competition among peers.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, P. &amp; Garcia, S. M. (manuscript) "Yin and Yang Theory of Competition: Social Comparison and Evaluation Apprehension Reciprocally Drive Competitive Motivation". [http://www-personal.umich.edu/~prestos/Downloads/DC/ChenGarciasubmitted.doc link].&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard, the psychological significance of a comparison depends on the social status of an individual, and the context in which their abilities are being evaluated.

==== Social status ====
Competitiveness resulting from social comparisons may be greater in relation to higher social status because individuals with more status have more to lose. In one study, students in a classroom were presented with a bonus point program where, based on chance, the grades for some students would increase and the grades for others would remain the same. Despite the fact that students could not lose by this program, higher-status individuals were more likely to object to the program, and more likely to report a perceived [[distributive justice|distributive injustice]]. It was suggested that this was a cognitive manifestation of an aversion to [[social mobility|downward mobility]], which has more psychological significance when an individual has more status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Burleigh T. J. |author2=Meegan D. V. | year = 2013 | title = Keeping up with the Joneses affects perceptions of distributive justice | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236111382 | format = PDF | journal = Social Justice Research | volume =  26| issue = 2| pages =  120–131| doi = 10.1007/s11211-013-0181-3 |citeseerx=10.1.1.693.335 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Proximity to a standard ====
When individuals are evaluated where meaningful standards exist, such as in an academic classroom where students are ranked, then competitiveness increases as proximity to a standard of performance increases. When the only meaningful standard is the top, then high-ranking individuals are most competitive with their peers, and individuals at low and intermediate ranks are equally competitive. However, when both high and low rankings hold significance, then individuals at high and low ranks are equally competitive, and are both more competitive than individuals at intermediate ranks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Garcia S. M. |author2=Tor A. | year = 2007 | title = Rankings, standards, and competition: Task vs. scale comparisons | url = | journal = Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes | volume = 102 | issue = 1| pages = 95–108 | doi = 10.1016/j.obhdp.2006.10.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Garcia S. M. |author2=Tor A. |author3=Gonzalez R. | year = 2006 | title = Ranks and rivals: a theory of competition | url = http://scholarship.law.nd.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1715&amp;context=law_faculty_scholarship| journal = Personality &amp; Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 32 | issue = 7| pages = 970–82 | doi = 10.1177/0146167206287640 |pmid=16738029 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Models of social comparison ===
Several models have been introduced to social comparison, including the [[self-evaluation maintenance model]] (SEM),&lt;ref name="Tesser1988" /&gt; [[proxy model]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wheeler L. |author2=Martin R. |author3=Suls J. | year = 1997 | title = The proxy model of social comparison for self-assessment of ability | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Review | volume = 1 | issue = 1| pages = 54–61 | doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr0101_4|pmid=15647128 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[triadic model]] and the [[three-selves model]].&lt;ref name="Blanton2001"&gt;Blanton, H. (2001). Evaluating the self in the context of another: The three-selves model of social comparison assimilation and contrast. In Cognitive social psychology: The Princeton symposium on the legacy and future of social cognition (pp. 75-87). Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Self-evaluation maintenance model ====
The SEM model proposes that we make comparisons to maintain or enhance our self-evaluations, focusing on the antagonistic processes of comparison and reflection.&lt;ref name="Tesser1988" /&gt;
Abraham Tesser has conducted research on self-evaluation dynamics that has taken several forms. A self-evaluation maintenance (SEM) model of social behavior focuses on the consequences of another person's outstanding performance on one's own self-evaluation. It sketches out some conditions under which the other's good performance bolsters self-evaluation, i.e., "basking in reflected glory", and conditions under which it threatens self-evaluation through a comparison process.&lt;ref name="Tesser Website"&gt;Tesser, A., Social Psychology Network; http://tesser.socialpsychology.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Proxy model ====
The proxy model anticipates the success of something that is unfamiliar.  The model proposes that if a person is successful or familiar with a task, then he or she would also be successful at a new similar task.  The proxy is evaluated based on ability and is concerned with the question "Can I do X?" A proxy's comparison is based previous attributes. The opinion of the comparer and whether the proxy exerted maximum effort on a preliminary task are variables influencing his or her opinion.&lt;ref name="Sulsetal2002" /&gt;

==== Triadic model ====
The Triadic Model builds on the attribution elements of social comparison, proposing that opinions of social comparison are best considered in terms of 3 different evaluative questions: preference assessment (i.e., "Do I like X?"), belief assessment (i.e., "Is X correct?"), and preference prediction (i.e., "Will I like X?"). In the Triadic Model the most meaningful comparisons are with a person who has already experienced a proxy and exhibits consistency in related attributes or past preferences.&lt;ref name="Sulsetal2002" /&gt;

==== Three-selves model ====
The three-selves model proposes that social comparison theory is a combination of two different theories. One theory is developed around motivation and the factors that influence the type of social comparison information people seek from their environment and the second is about self-evaluation and the factors that influence the effects of social comparisons on the judgments of self.&lt;ref name="Blanton2001" /&gt; While there has been much research in the area of comparison motives, there has been little in the area of comparative evaluation. Explaining that the self is conceived as interrelated conceptions accessible depending upon current judgment context&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Markus H. |author2=Wurf E. | year = 1987 | title = The dynamic self-concept: A social psychological perspective | url = | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 38 | issue = 1| pages = 299–337 | doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.38.1.299}}&lt;/ref&gt; and taking a cue from [[Social Cognitive Theory]], this model examines the [[Assimilation effect]] and distinguishes three classes of working [[Self-concept]] ideas: individual selves, possible selves and collective selves.

== Media influence ==
The media has been found to play a large role in social comparisons. Researchers examining the social effects of the media have used social comparison theory have found that in most cases women tend to engage in upward social comparisons with a target other, which results in more negative feelings about the self. The majority of women have a daily opportunity to make upward comparison by measuring themselves against some form of societal ideal. Social comparisons have become a relevant mechanism for learning about the appearance-related social expectations among peers and for evaluating the self in terms of those standards" (Jones, 2001, P. 647).

Although men do make upward comparisons, research finds that more women make upward comparisons and are comparing themselves with unrealistically high standards presented in the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Strahan E. J. |author2=Wilson A. E. |author3=Cressman K. E. |author4=Buote V. M. | year = 2006 | title = Comparing to perfection: How cultural norms for appearance affect social comparisons and self-image | url = | journal = Body Image | volume = 3 | issue = 3| pages = 211–227 | doi=10.1016/j.bodyim.2006.07.004|pmid=18089224 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As women are shown more mainstream media images of powerful, successful and thin women, they perceive the "ideal" to be the norm for societal views of attractive.  In recent years, social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram have made this more widespread, since social media makes it easier to compare yourself to the "ideal". Some women have reported making upward comparisons in a positive manner for the purposes of self-motivation, but the majority of upward comparisons are made when the individual is feeling lesser and therefore evoke a negative connotation.

Self-perceived similarities with role models on social media can also affect self-esteem for both men and women. Having more self-perceived similarities with a role model can help increase self-esteem, while having less can decrease self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wohlford|first=Kathryn E.|last2=Lochman|first2=John E.|last3=Barry|first3=Tammy D.|date=2004-04-01|title=The Relation Between Chosen Role Models and the Self-Esteem of Men and Women|journal=Sex Roles|language=en|volume=50|issue=7–8|pages=575–582|doi=10.1023/B:SERS.0000023076.54504.ca|issn=0360-0025}}&lt;/ref&gt;Social comparison with peers on social media can also lead to feelings of self-pity or satisfaction. The desire for social comparison can cause [[Fear of missing out|FoMO]] and compulsive checking of social media sites. 

== Criticisms ==
Many criticisms arose regarding Festinger's similarity hypothesis. Deutsch and Krauss&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch, M., &amp; Krauss, R. M. (1965). Theories in social psychology (Vol. 2). New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; argued that people actually seek out dissimilar others in their comparisons maintaining that this is important for providing valuable self-knowledge, as demonstrated in research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Goethals G. R. |author2=Nelson R. E. | year = 1973 | title = Similarity in the influence process: The belief-value distinction | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 25 | issue = 1| pages = 117–122 | doi=10.1037/h0034266}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mettee, D. R., &amp; Smith, G. (1977). Social comparison and interpersonal attraction: The case for dissimilarity. Social comparison processes: Theoretical and empirical perspectives, 69, 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Ambiguity also circulated about the important dimensions for similarity. Goethals and Darley clarified the role of similarity suggesting that people prefer to compare those who are similar on related attributes such as opinions, characteristics or abilities to increase confidence for value judgments, however those dissimilar in related attributes are preferred when validating one's beliefs.&lt;ref name="GoethalsDarley1977" /&gt;

'''''The Culture of Disbelief''''' ({{ISBN|0-385-47498-9}}) is a 1994 book by [[Stephen L. Carter]]. In it, he holds that [[religion]] in the United States is trivialized by American [[law]] and [[politics]], and that those with a strong religious faith are forced to bend to meet the viewpoint of a "public faith" which is largely faithless. Carter argues that there is a place for faith in public life, while still adhering to the [[separation of church and state]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4662">The '''USC Center for Visual Anthropology''' ('''CVA''') is a center located at the [[University of Southern California]]. It is dedicated to the field of [[visual anthropology]], incorporating visual modes of expression in the academic discipline of anthropology.  It does so in conjunction with faculty in the anthropology department through five types of activities: training, research and analysis of visual culture, production of visual projects, archiving and collecting, and the sponsorship of conferences and film festivals. It offers a B.A.&lt;ref&gt;[https://dornsife.usc.edu/anth/undergraduate/ Anthropology: Undergraduate Degree Programs]&lt;/ref&gt; and an MVA&lt;ref&gt;[https://dornsife.usc.edu/anth/masters-in-visual-anthropology/ Master of Arts in Visual Anthropology]&lt;/ref&gt; in Visual Anthropology.

==History==
The CVA was founded and directed by Ira Abrams&lt;ref&gt;[http://astro.temple.edu/~ruby/ruby/iwf.html The Professionalization of Visual Anthropology in the United States - The 1960s and 1970s]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idyllwildarts.org/workshop-q10358-c10329-Faculty_Bios.aspx Faculty Bios]&lt;/ref&gt; in collaboration with  [[Barbara Myerhoff]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://college.usc.edu/news/stories/634/legends-asch-and-myerhoff-inspire-a-new-generation-of-visual-ant/ Legends Asch and Myerhoff Inspire A New Generation of Visual Anthropologists &gt; News &gt; USC College]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tim Asch]] took over as director of the CVA in 1983. In 1984, he collaborated with the [[USC School of Cinematic Arts]] to create the MAVA degree (Master of Arts in Visual Anthropology), a 2-3 year terminal Masters program unique in its emphasis on both textual and visual media (film and photography) as components of an academically grounded research project.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Asch served as director of the CVA until his death in 1994. In 2001, the MAVA program was merged into a ''Certificate in Visual Anthropology'' given alongside the Ph.D. in Anthropology. For a number of years, the CVA served as the west coast venue for the  [[Margaret Mead Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://college.usc.edu/anth/html/cva.html Center for Visual Anthropology: USC Department of Anthropology] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091127144325/http://college.usc.edu/anth/html/cva.html |date=2009-11-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usc.edu/uscnews/stories/186.html Filming Culture: Nigeria, Korea And Beyond Margaret Mead Ethnographic Film Festival Travels To The University, Bringing Two Videos By Usc Visual Anthropology Graduates] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080524112645/http://www.usc.edu/uscnews/stories/186.html |date=2008-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A new one year version of the Masters of Arts in Visual Anthropology was established in 2008, which focuses on the production of a half-hour ethnographic documentary over a twelve month period.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, Susan 2009 "Legends Asch and Myerhoff Inspire A New Generation of Visual Anthropologists", Daily Trojan&lt;/ref&gt;  Over thirty new ethnographic documentaries have already been produced in this new program, and many of them are now in distribution and shown at film festivals.

'''Virgilio Cardinal Noè''' (30 March 1922 – 24 July 2011) was an Italian Catholic prelate.

{{infobox cardinalstyles|cardinal name=Virgilio Noè|dipstyle=[[His Eminence]]|offstyle=Your Eminence|relstyle=[[Monsignor]]|See=Voncaria (Titular)|deathstyle=|image = Coat of arms of Virgilio Noè.svg| image_size = 200px|}}

==Early Life and Ministry==

Virgilio Noè was born in 1922 in [[Zelata di Bereguardo]], Lombardy, where the house is marked by a commemorative plaque. He studied at the Seminary of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Pavia|Pavia]]  and was ordained a priest on 1 October 1944 by the Bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Pavia|Pavia]], [[Carlo Allorio]]. After ordination he became parish priest of the parish of ''San Salvatore'' in [[Pavia]] and founded a youth association with the aim especially of promoting participation in the Liturgy.

In 1948  [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Pavia|Bishop]], [[Carlo Allorio|Allorio]] sent him to Rome for studies at the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]], where he gained a doctorate in [[ecclesiastical history]] in 1952,{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} with a thesis entitled ''La politica religiosa dei re longobardi'' (''The Religious Policies of the Lombard Kings'').

On returning to the diocese he taught [[History of Christianity|Ecclesiastical History]], [[Patristics]], Liturgy and [[Catholic Church art|Art History]] in the  seminaries of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Pavia|Pavia]] and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Tortona|Tortona]]. In this period he was also   spiritual director in the ''Collegio Sant'Agostino'' and the ''Collegio San Giorgio'', and played a leading role in the diocesan liturgical commission. Among the projects undertaken were diocesan [[Eucharistic Congress]]es in 1956 and 1964, in the first of which the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Milan|Archbishop of Milan]], [[Giovanni Battista Montini]] took part.

==Activity in Rome==

In the years 1964-1969, starting therefore during the period of the [[Second Vatican Council]], he was in charge of the national ''Centro di Azione Liturgica'' (''Centre for Liturgical Action'') in Rome, and editor of its journal ''Liturgia''. He was also lecturer in [[Catholic Church art|Sacred Art]] at the recently founded [[Pontifical Institute of Sacred Liturgy|Pontifical Liturgical Institute]] of  Sant'Anselmo in the city, and when a commission was formed to revise the papal liturgical celebrations, he was made a member. From 1966 to 1968 he also served as vice-rector of the Pontifical Lombard Seminary (''Pontificio Seminario Lombardo dei SS. Ambrogio e Carlo'') in [[Rome]].

When the Sacred [[Congregation for Divine Worship]] (''Sacra Congregatio pro Cultu Divino'') was established in 1969 to take over the historical brief for liturgical affairs handled since 1588 by the Sacred Congregation of Rites (''Sacra Rituum Congregatio''), Mons. Noè was appointed its Undersecretary and held the post until the [[Congregation for Divine Worship|Congregation]]'s short life came to an end. In the meantime, in 1970, [[Pope Paul VI]]  appointed him [[Master of ceremonies]], a post now renamed for the first time ''[[Office for the Liturgical Celebrations of the Supreme Pontiff|Master of Pontifical Liturgical Celebrations]]'' and which he held until his appointment as a bishop in 1982, when Mons. [[John Magee (bishop)|John Magee]] was appointed to succeed him. In the same period he was chaplain to what is since called the Papal Gendarmeria.

During his period in the office, the challenge for Mons. Noè was to find ways of apply the governing principles and the practical norms of the new liturgical books that were gradually being revised and published to unique circumstances of the papal liturgy. The papal liturgy is in many respects seen as a model, but is also almost always televised and has some papal rites which in the nature of things are peculiar to it. The results of  Mons. Noè's work were generally considered a success. The new papal practice which he established was moderate and sober, had dignity, but was devoid of flamboyance. The Masses and the more frequent liturgies for e beatifications and canonizations, but also the special ceremonies called for by the Jubilee of 1975, the funeral of Paul VI and the inauguration of the pontificates of his  successors, were all given a new shape. The issuing of tasteful booklets for the people that were collector's items in their own right became a consolidated practice.

Throughout this period, Mons. Noè's career then followed the complicated course of successive partial internal organizations of the Roman Curia. When in the summer of 1975 the Sacred [[Congregation for Divine Worship]] was amalgamated with the Sacred [[Congregation for the Discipline of the Sacraments]] (''Sacra Congregatio de Disciplina Sacramentorum'') (founded in 1908 by [[Pope Pius X]]) to form a Sacred [[Congregation for the Sacraments and Divine Worship]] (''Sacra Congregatio de Sacramentis et Cultu Divino''), Mons. Noè was appointed Undersecretary in charge of liturgical affairs.

==Archbishop and Cardinal==

On 30 January 1982 Mons. Noè was promoted to the rank of Secretary in the Sacred [[Congregation for the Sacraments and Divine Worship]] (''Sacra Congregatio de Sacramentis et Cultu Divino''), and simultaneously made [[Titular see|Titular]] [[Archbishop]] of [[Voncaria]]. He was ordained a bishop on 6 March 1982 in St Peter's Basilica by [[Pope John Paul II]], assisted by Archbishop [[Eduardo Martínez Somalo]] and Bishop [[Antonio Giuseppe Angioni]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Pavia|Bishop of Pavia]]. Archbishop,  later Cardinal, [[Eduardo Martínez Somalo|Martínez]], was at the time ''Sostituto'' or Substitute for General Affairs of the [[Secretariat of State]]. In his new rank the now Archbishop Noè had again a particular status within the Congregation as being specifically in charge of a distinct section for Divine Worship.

Between 1984 and 1988 the dicastery was briefly redivided into the Congregation for the Sacraments (''Congregatio de Sacramentis'') and the  [[Congregation for Divine Worship]]  (''Congregatio de Cultu Divino'') under a single Prefect. In this new version of the latter, Archbishop Noè was the sole Archbishop Secretary, according to the classic system. Then, as a result of the [[Apostolic Constitution]] ''[[Pastor Bonus]]'' of 1988, this move was reversed and there emerged the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments  (''Sacra Congregatio de Cultu Divino de et Disciplina Sacramentorum''), which still exists. In this new entity,  Archbishop Noè was no longer the sole Archbishop Secretary, but reverted to being once more Archbishop Secretary but in charge of a distinct section for Divine Worship.

The habits of the Roman Curia at the time foresaw what was called the zigzag system, whereby in order to achieve promotion at the higher ranks, it was necessary to move from one dicastery to another, each move being accompanied by a promotion in rank. Based on no private information, but on the known zigzag principle, it was clear that for a further promotion, there had to be a move to some other part of the Curia. In fact, when the building blocks of a wider series of curial changes were in place, Archbishop Noè was soon transferred to a completely different area and became  Delegate of the [[Fabric of St. Peter]], an entity that is not part of the [[Roman Curia]], but recognized by the 1988 apostolic constitution ''[[Pastor bonus]]'' as "closely associated with the [[Holy See]]."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ewtn.com/library/papaldoc/jp2pastr.htm ''Pastor Bonus'' Part IX], EWTN.com, accessed 3 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The appointment took effect on 24 May 1989. In formal terms the new posting was of equivalent rank to Archbishop Noè's previous appointment. However, it was clearly a promotion in that he was now the number two of an organization that had considerable administrative and financial autonomy and a large workforce, perhaps 6-7 times as many as his former Congregation and perhaps 20 times as many as its liturgical section. Moreover, the elderly head of the [[Fabric of St. Peter]], [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|cardinal]] [[Aurelio Sabattani]] (1983-1991), was not then in robust health, so authority resided in practice with Archbishop Noè, who in fact was given additionally the title of [[Coadjutor bishop|Coadjutor]] [[Archpriest]] of [[St. Peter's Basilica]].

The new Delegate took charge and ruled with a firm hand. While the public saw nothing of internal organization matters, it could not but notice how the place gleamed. In a setting where there was in reality limited scope for radical innovation, he nevertheless brought his background in art history and his esthetic good taste to bear. Given his long period of office, which lasted unusually until he reached the age of 80, the cumulative effects of his policies were considerable.

Archbishop Noè was created [[Cardinal-Deacon]] of ''S. Giovanni Bosco in Via Tuscolana'' in the consistory of 28 June 1991 by [[Pope John Paul II]]. Three days later, he was made [[Archpriest]] of the [[St. Peter's Basilica]], and hence President of the [[Fabric of St. Peter]]. Moreover, as a consequence of the measures established by the papal Chirograph of 14 January 1991 regulating the office of Vicar General of the Vatican City, on becoming Archpriest, he also automatically assumed that post.&lt;ref name="Holy See bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/news_services/press/documentazione/documents/cardinali_biografie/cardinali_bio_noe_v_en.html|title=NOÈ, Card. Virgilio|publisher=Holy See Press Office|date=3 December 2004|accessdate=18 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1993 to  1996 he was additionally President of the Cardinalatial Commission for the Pontifical Shrines of Pompei, Loreto and  Bari.

As is the custom, after 10 years as Cardinal-Deacon, Cardinal Noè took the option of petitioning to be elevated to the rank of Cardinal-Priest with the [[titular church]] of ''[[Regina Apostolorum]]'' as of 26 February 2002. He briefly attracted attention when he claimed that [[Pope Paul VI]] spoke of the "smoke of Satan" in the Catholic Church, he was referring to priests who celebrated Mass badly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wdtprs.com/blog/2008/05/petrus-amazing-interview-with-card-noe-paul-vis-smoke-of-satan-remark-concerned-liturgy Interview with Cardinal Noè: Paul VI's “smoke of Satan” remark concerned liturgy from "What Does The Prayer Really Say?"] by Fr. John Zuhlsdorf at PETRUS&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and Burial==
On 24 July 2011, Cardinal Noè died in Rome at the age of 89.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/cardinal-who-cared-for-upkeep-of-st-peters-basilica-other-vatican-monuments-dies-in-rome/2011/07/24/gIQAH4OoWI_story.html|title=Cardinal, who cared for upkeep of St. Peter's Basilica, other Vatican monuments, dies in Rome|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His funeral Mass was celebrated on 26 July 2011 in the apse of  [[St. Peter's Basilica]], by Cardinal [[Angelo Sodano]], Dean of the College of Cardinals and concelebrated by a large number of Cardinals and bishops. He is buried in the cemetery of Campo Verano, Rome.

'''Wilfred Cantwell Smith''' {{post-nominals|country=CAN|OC}} (July 21, 1916 &amp;ndash; February 7, 2000) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] professor of [[comparative religion]] who from 1964&amp;ndash;1973 was director of [[Harvard University]]'s [[Center for the Study of World Religions]]. The ''Harvard Gazette'' said he was one of the field's most influential figures of the past century.&lt;ref name="obituary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2001/11.29/27-memorialminute.html|title=Wilfred Cantwell Smith: In Memoriam|work=Harvard University Gazette|accessdate=4 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1962 work ''The Meaning and End of Religion'' he notably and controversially questioned the validity of the concept of [[religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, W.C. (1962) ''The Meaning and End of Religion''. First Fortress Press Edition 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and career ==
Smith was born in [[Toronto]] to parents Victor Arnold Smith and Sarah Cory Cantwell. He was the younger brother of [[Arnold Smith]] and the father of [[Brian Cantwell Smith]].

He received a [[B.A]]. with honours in [[Languages of Asia|oriental languages]] in 1938 from the [[University of Toronto]]. After his thesis was rejected by [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]], supposedly for its [[Marxist]] critique of the [[British Raj]], he and his wife Muriel Mackenzie Struthers spent seven years in Pre-Independence [[India]] (1940–1946), during which he taught [[Indian history|Indian]] and [[Islamic history]] at [[Forman Christian College]] in [[Lahore]].

In 1948 he obtained a [[Ph.D]] in oriental languages at [[Princeton University]], after which he taught at [[McGill University|McGill]], founding in 1952 the university's [[McGill University Institute of Islamic Studies|Institute of Islamic Studies]]. From 1964 to 1973 Smith taught at [[Harvard Divinity School]]. He left Harvard for [[Dalhousie University]] in [[Halifax Urban Area|Halifax, NS]], where he founded the Department of Religion. He was also among the original Editorial Advisors of the scholarly journal ''[[Dionysius (journal)|Dionysius]]''. In 1978 he returned to Harvard. In 1979 he received an honorary doctorate from [[Concordia University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archives.concordia.ca/smith-w|title=Honorary Degree Citation - Wilfred Cantwell Smith* {{!}} Concordia University Archives|website=archives.concordia.ca|access-date=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his retirement from teaching, he was appointed a senior research associate in the Faculty of Divinity at [[University of Trinity College|Trinity College]], University of Toronto, in 1985. He died on February 7, 2000.&lt;ref name="obituary" /&gt;

==Views on religion==
In his best known and most controversial work, Smith contends that the [[concept]] of religion, rather than being a universally valid category as is generally supposed, is a peculiarly [[Europe]]an [[construct (philosophy of science)|construct]] of recent origin.  Religion, he argues, is a static concept that does not adequately address the complexity and flux of religious lives. Instead of the concept of religion, Smith proffers a new conceptual apparatus: the dynamic dialectic between ''cumulative tradition'' (all historically observable rituals, art, music, theologies, etc.) and ''personal faith''. (p.&amp;nbsp;194)

Smith sets out chapter by chapter to demonstrate that none of the founders or followers of the world's major religions had any understanding that they were engaging in a defined system called religion. The major exception to this rule, Cantwell Smith points out, is [[Islam]] which he describes as the most "entity like"' (p.&amp;nbsp;85). In a chapter titled ''The special case of Islam'', Smith points out that the term Islam appears in the [[Qur'an]], making it the only religion not named in opposition to or by another tradition. (p.&amp;nbsp;80). Other than the prophet [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]], only the prophet [[Muhammad]] was conscious of the establishment of a religion.  (p.&amp;nbsp;106). Smith points out that the [[Arabic]] language does not have a word for religion, strictly speaking: he details how the word ''din'', customarily translated as such, differs in significant important respects from the European concept.

The terms for major world religions today, including Hinduism, Buddhism, and Shintoism, did not exist until the 19th century.  Smith suggests that practitioners of any given faith do not historically come to regard what they do as ''religion'' until they have developed a degree of cultural self-regard, causing them to see their collective spiritual practices and beliefs as in some way significantly ''different'' from the ''other''. Religion in the contemporary sense of the word is for Smith the product of both [[identity politics]] and [[apologetics]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"One's own 'religion' may be piety and faith, obedience, worship, and a vision of God. An alien 'religion' is a system of beliefs or rituals, an abstract and impersonal pattern of observables. A dialectic ensues, however. If one's own 'religion' is attacked, by unbelievers who necessarily conceptualize it schematically, or all religion is, by the indifferent, one tends to leap to the defence of what is attacked, so that presently participants of a faith - especially those most involved in argument - are using the term in the same externalist and theoretical sense as their opponents. Religion as a systematic entity, as it emerged in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, is a concept of polemics and apologetics" (p. 43).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By way of an [[etymology|etymological]] study of ''religion'' (''religio'', in [[Latin]]), Smith further contends that the term, which at first and for most of the centuries denoted an attitude towards a relationship between [[God]] and ''man'' (p.&amp;nbsp;26), has through conceptual slippage come to mean a "system of observances or beliefs" (p.&amp;nbsp;29), a historical tradition which has been institutionalized through a process of [[Reification (fallacy)|reification]].  Whereas ''religio'' denoted personal [[piety]], ''religion'' came to refer to an [[abstract entity]] (or [[transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] signifier) which, Smith says, does not exist.

He argues that the term as found in [[Lucretius]] and [[Cicero]] was internalized by the [[Catholic Church]] through [[Lactantius]] and [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]].  During the [[Middle Ages]] it was superseded by the term ''faith'', which Smith favors by contrast. In the [[Renaissance]],  via the Christian [[Platonist]] [[Marsilio Ficino]], ''religio'' becomes popular again, retaining its original emphasis on personal practice, even in [[John Calvin]]'s ''Christianae Religionis Institutio'' (1536). During 17th Century debates between Catholics and [[Protestant]]s, religion begins to refer to an abstract system of beliefs, especially when describing an oppositional structure. Through the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] this concept is further reified, so that by the nineteenth century [[Hegel]] defines religion as ''Begriff'', "a self-subsisting transcendent idea that unfolds itself in dynamic expression in the course of ever-changing history ... something real in itself, a great entity with which man has to reckon, a something that precedes all its historical manifestation" (p.&amp;nbsp;47).

Smith concludes (p.&amp;nbsp;48-9) by arguing that the term religion has now acquired four distinct senses: 
# personal piety (e.g. as meant by the phrase "he is more religious than he was ten years ago");
# an overt system of beliefs, practices and values, related  to a particular community manifesting itself as the ''ideal'' religion that the theologian tries to formulate, but which he knows transcends him (e.g. 'true Christianity');
# an overt system of beliefs, practices and values, related  to a particular community manifesting itself as the ''empirical phenomenon'', historical and sociological (e.g. the Christianity of history);
# a generic summation or universal category, i.e. ''religion in general''.

''The Meaning and End of Religion'' remains Smith's most influential work.
The [[anthropologist]] and writer on religion and [[post-colonial studies]] [[Talal Asad]] has said ''The Meaning and End of Religion'' is a modern classic and a masterpiece.&lt;ref&gt;[[Talal Asad]] (2001) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3176697 ''Reading a Modern Classic: W.

[[File:Religijne symbole0.png|thumb|right|The world religions paradigm selects a small number of religious groups which it classes as 'major'.]]
'''World religions''' is a category used in the [[Religious studies|study of religion]] to demarcate the five—and in some cases six—largest and most internationally widespread religious movements. [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], [[Hinduism]], and [[Buddhism]] are always included in the list, being known as the "Big Five". Some scholars also include another religion, such as [[Sikhism]], [[Zoroastrianism]], or the [[Bahá'í Faith]], in the category. 

The world religions paradigm was developed in the United Kingdom in the 1960s, where it was pioneered by [[phenomenology of religion|phenomenological]] scholars like [[Ninian Smart]]. It was designed to broaden the study of religion away from its heavy focus on Christianity by taking into account other large religious traditions around the world.  
The paradigm is often used by lecturers instructing undergraduate students in the study of religion and is also the framework used by school teachers in the UK and other countries. The paradigm's emphasis on viewing these religious movements as distinct and mutually exclusive entities has also had a wider impact on the categorisation of religion—for instance in censuses—in both Western countries and elsewhere.

Since the late twentieth century, the paradigm has faced critique by scholars of religion like [[Jonathan Z. Smith]], some of whom have argued for its abandonment. Critics have argued that the world religions paradigm is inappropriate because it takes the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] variant of Christianity as the model for what constitutes religion; that it is tied up with discourses of modernity, including modern power relations; that it encourages an uncritical understanding of religion; and that it makes a value judgement as to what religions should be considered "major". Others have argued that it remains useful in the classroom, so long as students are made aware that it is a socially constructed category.

==Definition==

The scholars of religion Christopher R. Cotter and David G. Robertson described the "World Religions Paradigm" as "a particular way of thinking about religions which organizes them into a set of discrete traditions with a supposedly 'global' import."{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016a|p=vii}} It typically consists of the "Big Five" religions: [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]], [[Islam]], [[Hinduism]], and [[Buddhism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Owen|1y=2011|1p=254|2a1=Cotter|2a2=Robertson|2y=2016b|2p=2}} 
As noted by Cotter and Robertson, the "Big Five" religions are often listed in an "Abrahamocentric order" which places the largest three [[Abrahamic religions]]—Christianity, Judaism, and Islam—before the non-Abrahamic religions Hinduism and Buddhism.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=2}} The category is sometimes also extended to include other religious groups, namely [[Sikhism]], [[Zoroastrianism]], and the [[Bahá'í Faith]].{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=254}}

The inclusion of Judaism in the Big Five raises some issues; it is included in the list because of its influence on Christianity and Islam and because of its relevance to traditional Western understandings of Western history.{{sfn|Taira|2016|p=80}} On demographic grounds, it does not fit into the list, for there are far fewer Jews in the world than there are Christians, Muslims, Hindus, and Buddhists.{{sfn|Taira|2016|p=80}} Similarly, it does not fit into the list if the groups are defined by a desire to spread internationally, because Judaism is typically non-proselytizing.{{sfn|Taira|2016|p=80}}

Many scholars have utilised the "World Religions" category alongside other "catch-all" categories such as "[[new religious movements]]" and "[[indigenous religions]]".{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=2}} The scholar Steven J. Sutcliffe compared the relationship between the three categories to the [[English football league system]], with the "world" religions forming a [[Premier League]], the "new" religions forming a [[EFL Championship|Championship]], and "indigenous" religions a [[Football League First Division|First Division]].{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2016|p=26}} That groups that get placed in categories like "indigenous religions" get treated less seriously than the "world religions" by many scholars was noted by the scholar of religion Graham Harvey, who maintained that "indigenous religions should receive similarly respectful treatment to that considered appropriate to the larger 'World Religions'."{{sfn|Harvey|2000|p=3}}

==History==

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=While the World Religions paradigm was brought in to allow the inclusion of non-Christian religions in education, it has instead remodelled them according to liberal Western Protestant Christian values (akin to what the [[Church of England]] promotes), emphasizing theological categories..|source=— Scholar of religion Suzanne Owen, 2011{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=258}} }}

Cotter and Robertson noted that the history of the world religions paradigm is "intimately tied up" with the history of the study of religion as an academic discipline.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=3}} It emerged from within the [[phenomenology of religion]] approach which placed an emphasis on description rather than critical analysis.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=258}} 

The paradigm was integrated throughout the education system through work of scholars like [[Ninian Smart]], who formed the Shap Working Party on World Religions in Education in 1969.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=254}} It was introduced with the intent of moving Western education away from its focus on Christianity.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=254}} However, it took liberal Western Protestantism as its baseline and interpreted these different religious traditions through the framework of liberal Protestant norms and values.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=254}} This included an emphasis on [[theology]] as being central to a given religion.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=254}} It also reflects the post-Enlightenment Christian approach of treating different religious groups as distinct, mutually exclusive categories.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=260}} It thus reflects the socio-political concerns of 1960s Britain, the environment in which it was devised.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=259}}

The paradigm has since gone beyond this academic discipline, and "informs the perception" of many members of different religious groups.{{sfn|Ramey|2016|p=50}} The paradigm for instance frames the teaching about religion in the British education system; at all three [[Key Stage]]s, British teachers are instructed to teach about Christianity, while by the end of key Stage 3 they are also supposed to teach about the other "five principal religions": Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, and Sikhism.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=263}} Similarly, the censuses of many countries for instance reflect the influence of the world religion paradigm by only permitting respondents to describe themselves as adhering to one particular religious tradition, whereas in reality many individuals identify themselves with various different traditions at the same time.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=260}} This idea of mutually exclusive religious identities is not only a Western phenomenon, but can also be found in other socio-cultural contexts; [[Hindu nationalism|Hindu nationalists]] for instance often endorse the idea that Hinduism and Buddhism are mutually exclusive categories despite the fact that many people in South Asia mix Hindu and Buddhist practices.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=260}}
The scholars of religion Tara Baldrick-Morrone, Michael Graziano, and Brad Stoddard stated that "the WRP is neither neutral nor natural, but its social authority derives from appearing as both."{{sfn|Baldrick-Morrone|Graziano|Stoddard|2016|p=38}}

==Criticism==

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=[A 'world religion' is] a tradition that has achieved sufficient power and numbers to enter our history to form it, interact with it, or thwart it. We recognise both the unity within and the diversity among the world religions because they correspond to important geopolitical entities with which we must deal. All 'primitives,' by way of contrast, may be lumped together, as may the 'minor religions,' because they do not confront our history in any direct fashion. From the point of view of power, they are invisible.|source=— Scholar of religion [[J. Z. Smith]], 1998{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=8}} }}

The utility of the  World Religions Paradigm has experienced a sustained and rigorous critique from many scholars of religion.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=7}} In 1978, the scholar of religion [[Jonathan Z. Smith]] for example called it a "dubious category".{{sfn|Smith|1978|p=295}}

One of the major criticisms of the framework is that it is based on a model of 'religion' that is highly reliant on using the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] version of Christianity as its base example.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=7}} A second criticism is that it is rooted in the discourses of modernity, including the [[power relations]] present in modern society.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=7}} Smith observed that it was constructed by Western scholars from a Western perspective. He noted that the only religions that get included in it are those which have "achieved sufficient power and numbers to enter our [i.e. Western] history, either to form it, interact with it, or to thwart it" and represent "important geo-political entities with which we must deal."{{sfn|Smith|1978|p=295}} The framework also includes privileging the literate elites active in particular religious movements by presenting their interpretations of particular traditions as being authoritative, eclipsing alternative interpretations presented by non-literate, marginalised, and localized practitioners.{{sfnm|1a1=Owen|1y=2011|1p=255|2a1=Cotter|2a2=Robertson|2y=2016b|2pp=8–9}} For instance, as noted by the scholar of religion Suzanne Owen, "Hinduism as a World Religion does not include Hinduism as a village religion".{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=255}}

A third criticism of the world religions paradigm is that it encourages an uncritical and ''sui generis'' model of 'religion'.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=7}} It presents each of the 'world religions' in an abstracted and essentialised form, failing to take account of hybridization.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=259}} For instance, in teaching about Christianity it does not refer to [[reincarnation]], because this is not typically regarded as a Christian doctrine, and yet there are Christians who profess a belief in reincarnation.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=259}}
A fourth criticism is that in choosing to focus attention on the "major" religions, it makes a value judgement as to what constitutes "major" and what does not.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=12}} 

===Paradigm in pedagogy===

Many scholars of religion have resisted efforts to challenge the paradigm,{{sfn|Cox|2016|p=xii}} and as of 2016 was reported as still being widespread in university introductory courses to the study of religion.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=10}} Many instructors feel that explaining the critique of the world religions paradigm to undergraduate students would be difficult, as the critique would be too complex for many of them to understand.{{sfn|Ramey|2016|p=49}} Its continued use has also been defended by the claim that it is what undergraduate students expect and that it mirrors what they will have been taught at school.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=254}}

Some scholars have argued for the rejection of the world religions paradigm altogether; Cotter and Robertson presented the argument that "the continued uncritical use of the WRP fosters a breeding ground for relativistic navel-gazing which has no place in the contemporary research university".{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=10}} Owen was of the view that "as long as it continues to employ the World Religions paradigm as a default approach (even after deconstructing it), religious studies will fail in its humanistic task" because it will simply be engaging in "knowledge transfer" and not "critically engaging" with "culture and knowledge".{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=257}} One alternative framework that some scholars use to teach about religion is the "[[lived religion]]" paradigm, which places emphasis not on distinct religious traditions but on individual experiences and practices.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=12}} Another alternative is the "[[material religion]]" framework which focuses on examining religion through [[material culture]] and physical objects.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|pp=12–13}} Owen noted that, in her experience, many students display an "initial resistance to alternatives" as they are expecting the world religions paradigm. She cited the example of her introductory course at [[Leeds Trinity University College]], which was constructed on thematic lines rather than according to the world religions paradigm, and which induced feelings of panic among many undergraduates.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=258}}

Many scholars who are critical of the world religions paradigm find themselves having to teach it as part of introductory courses for undergraduate students.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=258}} Some spent much of a course teaching the concept and then several sessions after this deconstructing it.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=258}} Some scholars have suggested that even when students are taught using the world religions paradigm, it could be a good means of encouraging them to think critically about category formation.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=13}} The scholar Steven W. Ramey for instance advocated teaching the paradigm in a manner that makes it clear that it is a "constructed discourse".{{sfn|Ramey|2016|p=48}} Similarly, Baldrick-Morrone, Graziano, and Stoddard suggested that teaching undergraduates about the world religious paradigm helps to explain to students how "classification is a social act".{{sfn|Baldrick-Morrone|Graziano|Stoddard|2016|p=39}} They noted that students could leave such a course not only knowing more about the specific religious traditions included in the world religions category, but that they would also leave "knowing how to better interrogate the world around them".{{sfn|Baldrick-Morrone|Graziano|Stoddard|2016|p=39}} To avoid promoting the paradigm's portrayal of different religious traditions as rigid, homogenous categories, the scholar Teemu Taira suggested introducing [[ethnography|ethnographic]] case studies into the class to better explain the realities of people's lives and uses of religious traditions.{{sfn|Taira|2016|p=82}}
