&lt;ref name=5DBIM-R-04&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/4D/ |title=Introduction to 4D Research by Martin Fischer |publisher=stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then with cost-related information.&lt;ref name=5DBIM-R-02/&gt;

'''5D =  3D + SCHEDULE + COST'''&lt;ref&gt;THIS IS A BASIC DEFINITION&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of 5D models enables the various participants (from architects, designers, contractors to owners) of a construction project to visualize the progress of construction activities and its related costs over time.&lt;ref name=5DBIM-R-03/&gt;&lt;ref name=5DBIM-R-05/&gt; This BIM-centric project management technique has potential to improve management and delivery of projects of any size or complexity.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, Fred. "[http://www.theb1m.com/video/what-is-5d-bim What is 5D BIM?]". www.TheB1M.com. The B1M Limited. Retrieved 8 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, McKinsey, a consultancy, identified 5D BIM technology as one of five big ideas poised to disrupt construction.It defined 5D BIM as "a five-dimensional representation of the physical and functional characteristics of any project. It considers a project’s cost and schedule in addition to the standard spatial design parameters in 3-D." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/industries/capital-projects-and-infrastructure/our-insights/imagining-constructions-digital-future|title=Imagining construction’s digital future|website=McKinsey &amp; Company|language=en|access-date=2017-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Usage ==

In Germany and Europe at large, 5D BIM technology is prevalent among large general contractors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2034">The terms '''Acidophobe'''/'''Acidophobia'''/'''Acidophoby'''/'''Acidophobic''' refer to intolerace to [[acidic]] environments. The term is variously applied to [[plants]], [[bacteria]], [[protozoa]], [[animal]]s, [[chemical compound]]s, etc. The antonymous term is "[[acidophile]]". Cf. "[[alkaliphile]]". 

Plants are known to be well-defined with respect to their pH tolerance, and only a small number of species thrive well under a broad range of acidity. Therefore the categorization acidophile/acidophobe is well-defined. Sometimes a complementary classification is used ('''calcicole'''/'''calcifuge''', with calcicoles being "[[Agricultural lime|lime]]-loving" plants). In gardening, [[soil pH]] is a measure of [[acidity]] or [[alkalinity]] of [[soil]], with pH=7 indicating the neutral soil. Therefore acydophobes would prefer pH above 7. Acid intolerance of plants may be mitigated by [[Agricultural lime|lime]] addition and by calcium and nitrogen fertilizers.

Acidophobic species are used as a natural instrument of monitoring the degree of acidifying contamination of soil and [[watercourse]]s. For example, when monitoring vegetation, a decrease of acidophobic species would be indicative of [[acid rain]] increase in the area. A similar approach is used with aquatic species.

==Acidophobes==
*[[Whiteworm]]s (''[[Enchytraeus albidus]]''), a popular live food for [[aquarist]]s, are acidophobes.
*Acidophobic compounds are the ones which are unstable in acidic media.
*Acidophobic crops: [[alfalfa]], [[clover]]

'''Acoustocerebrography (ACG)''' is a [[medical test]] used to [[medical diagnosis|diagnose]] changes and [[disease|problems]] in the [[brain]] and the [[central nervous system]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Miroslaw_Wrobel2/publication/286218812_Computer_Aided_Multispectral_Ultrasound_Diagnostics_Brain_Health_Monitoring_System_based_on_Acoustocerebrography/links/5666d42508ae4931cd629ac8.pdf?inViewer=0&amp;pdfJsDownload=0&amp;origin=publication_detail Computer Aided Multispectral Ultrasound Diagnostics Brain Health Monitoring System based on Acoustocerebrography], Bogdan et al. (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; It allows for the noninvasive examination of the brain's [[cell (biology)|cellular]] and [[molecule|molecular]] structure. It can also be applied as a means to diagnose and monitor [[intracranial pressure]], for example as incorporated into continuous brain [[monitoring (medicine)|monitoring]] devices. ACG uses molecular [[acoustics]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.springer.com/de/book/9783642491412 Molekularakustik - Eine Einführung in die Zusammenhänge zwischen Ultraschall und Molekülstruktur in Flüssigkeiten und Gasen], Werner Schaaffs (1963)&lt;/ref&gt; in audible and [[ultrasound]] frequency ranges, to monitor changes. It may use [[microphone]]s, [[accelerometer]]s, and multifrequency [[ultrasonic transducer]]s. It does not use any [[radiation]] and is completely free of any side effects. ACG also facilitates [[blood flow]] analysis as well as the detection of obstructions in cerebral blood flow (from cerebral [[embolism]]) or bleeding (from [[cerebral hemorrhage]]).

==Passive and active acoustocerebrography==
===Passive acoustocerebrography===
All brain tissue is influenced by blood circulating in the brain's vascular system. With each heartbeat, blood circulates in the skull, following a recurring pattern according to the oscillation produced. This oscillation's effect, in turn, depends on the brain's size, form, structure and its vascular system. Thus, every heartbeat stimulates minuscule motion in the brain tissue as well as [[cerebrospinal fluid]] and therefore produces minimal changes in intracranial pressure. These changes can be monitored and measured in the skull.
Today, mostly passive sensors like accelerometers are used to identify these signals correctly.&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12028-015-0118-9 Cranial Accelerometry Can Detect Cerebral Vasospasm Caused by Subarachnoid Hemorrhage], Smith et al. (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes highly sensitive microphones are utilized.
&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3070164 Recording and processing aneurysmal vibration signals in dogs], Sun et al. (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://stroke.ahajournals.org/content/21/8/1215.long Acoustic recordings from experimental saccular aneurysms in dogs], Sekhar et al. (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=4122509&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D4122509 Detection and Analysis of Cranial Bruit], Kosugi et al. (1987)&lt;/ref&gt;

With a digital signal, it becomes possible to study the patterns of the blood flow moving inside the skull. These patterns form unique signatures that can be analyzed with specially designed algorithms, identifying them either as an inconspicuous, “normal” pattern or as a pattern showing an “abnormal” behavior.

===Active acoustocerebrography===
In active ACG applications, a multi-frequency ultrasonic signal is used to detect and classify adverse changes at the cellular or molecular level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0208521615000753 On ultrasound classification of stroke risk factors from randomly chosen respondents using non-invasive multispectral ultrasonic brain measurements and adaptive profiles], Wrobel et al. (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition to all of the advantages that passive ACG provides, with active ACG it is possible to conduct a [[Spectrum#Spectrogram|spectral analysis]] of the acoustic signals received. These spectrum analyses not only display changes in the brain's vascular system, but also those in its cellular and molecular structures.
One common application of active ACG is the [[Transcranial Doppler]] test. More recently, its color version (TCCD) has been deployed. These ultrasonic procedures measure blood flow velocity within the brain's blood vessels. They are used to diagnose [[embolisms]], [[stenosis|stenoses]] and vascular constrictions, for example, in the aftermath of a [[subarachnoid hemorrhage]].

==Fields of application==
In contrast with applications that provide only momentary images, such as [[MRI]] and [[CT scan|CT]], the results of ACG procedures can be obtained continuously, thus facilitating effortless and non-invasive real-time monitoring. This can be especially helpful during the acute phase directly after a stroke or a traumatic brain injury. The measured data is mathematically processed continuously and displayed on a monitoring device. The computer-aided analysis of the signals enables the physician/nursing staff to precisely interpret the results immediately after device setup. Furthermore, ACG allows for preventive detection of pathological changes in brain tissue.

'''Agnostic theism''', '''agnostotheism''' or '''agnostitheism''' is the [[philosophical]] view that encompasses both [[theism]] and [[agnosticism]]. An agnostic theist believes in the existence of a god or gods, but regards the basis of this proposition as ''unknown or inherently unknowable''. The agnostic theist may also or alternatively be agnostic regarding the properties of the god or gods that they believe in.

==Views of agnostic theism==
[[File:Classical definition of Kno.svg|thumb|right|Agnostic theism is belief but without knowledge, as shown in purple and blue (see [[Epistemology]]).]]
There are numerous [[belief]]s that can be included in agnostic theism, such as [[fideism]], the doctrine that knowledge depends on faith or revelation; not all agnostic theists are fideists. Since agnosticism is in the philosophical rather than religious sense a position on knowledge and does not forbid belief in a deity, it is compatible with most theistic positions.

The classical [[Epistemology|philosophical understanding of knowledge]] is that [[knowledge]] is [[justified true belief]]. The founder of [[logotherapy]], [[Viktor Frankl]], may have well exemplified this definition. Seidner expands upon this example and stresses Frankl's characterization of ''unconscious''.&lt;ref&gt;Seidner, Stanley S. (June 10, 2009) [https://docs.google.com/gview?a=v&amp;q=cache:FrKYAo88ckkJ:www.materdei.ie/media/conferences/a-secular-age-parallel-sessions-timetable.pdf+%22Stan+Seidner%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us "A Trojan Horse: Logotherapeutic Transcendence and its Secular Implications for Theology"]{{dead link|date=June 2012}}. ''Mater Dei Institute''.&lt;/ref&gt; Agnostic theism could be interpreted as an admission that it is not possible to justify one's belief in a god sufficiently for it to be considered known. This may be because they consider [[faith]] a requirement of their religion, or because of the influence of plausible-seeming scientific or philosophical criticism.

[[Christian agnosticism|Christian Agnostics]] practice a distinct form of agnosticism that applies only to the ''properties'' of God. They hold that it is difficult or impossible to be sure of anything beyond the basic tenets of the [[Christian faith]]. They believe that God exists, that [[Jesus]] has a special relationship with him and is in some way divine, and that God should be worshipped. This belief system has deep roots in Judaism and the early days of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Weatherhead |first=Leslie |title=The Christian Agnostic |date=1972 |publisher=[[Abingdon Press]] |isbn=978-0-687-06977-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:South Asia in 400 CE.tif|thumb|Map of south Asia in ''circa'' 400 CE showing principal kingdoms and city states]]

==Objectives==
The project is focussing on the history and culture of early medieval India, specifically the period of the [[Gupta]] dynasty (''circa'' 320-510 CE). Although characterised as a ‘golden age’ in modern scholarship — and marked by developments that shaped South Asia for more than a thousand years — research on this pivotal moment is fragmented and compartmentalised. The purpose of the project is to move beyond these limitations and to recover a more compelling picture of this influential period and its impact on India and her neighbours. The project achieves this aim through the development of online research tools, a series of workshops, and publications.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.soas.ac.uk/south-asia-institute/events/asia-beyond-boundaries/ (Retrieved June 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research Aims==
The project is interdisciplinary in design and aims to: 
* Investigate the constitution of the Gupta kingdom and its relationship with surrounding states
* Chart the polities that flourished concurrently in central and southeast Asia
* Define and analyse specific appropriations inspired by Indian examples and map how Sanskrit, Prakrit and Pali, the media of political and religious discourse, came to be used across Asia beside regional languages such as [[Pyu]], [[Kannada]] and [[Khotanese language|Khotanese]]
* Scrutinize how temples and monasteries emerged as autonomous socio-economic institutions with stable endowments, thereby possessing the resources needed to become long-standing trans-regional nodes of learning, ritual practice

==Research Themes and Open Sources==
Concerns about prevailing 'silos of knowledge' emerged primarily in management studies in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;For example: Lessard, Donald R., and Srilata Zaheer. "Breaking the Silos: Distributed Knowledge and Strategic Responses to Volatile Exchange Rates." ''Strategic Management Journal'' 17, no. 7 (1996): 513-33. https://www.jstor.org/stable/2486730.&lt;/ref&gt; This analysis has had little impact beyond the commercial sector, however, especially in cultural and historical research where modern nation states, regional languages, and established disciplinary protocols have reinforced the [[status quo]]. In moving beyond these constraints, three research themes have been developed to cross the disciplines and regions covered by the project. The project design involves making all core data and analysis freely available online.

{{Paleontology}}
'''Biostratigraphy''' is the branch of [[stratigraphy]] which focuses on correlating and assigning relative ages of rock [[Stratum|strata]] by using the [[fossil]] assemblages contained within them. Usually the aim is correlation, demonstrating that a particular [[Horizon (geology)|horizon]] in one geological section represents the same period of time as another horizon at some other section. The fossils are useful because [[sediment]]s of the same age can look completely different because of local variations in the [[Sedimentary depositional environment|sedimentary environment]]. For example, one section might have been made up of [[clay]]s and [[marl]]s while another has more [[chalk]]y [[limestone]]s, but if the fossil species recorded are similar, the two sediments are likely to have been laid down at the same time.

Biostratigraphy originated in the early 19th century, where geologists recognised that the correlation of fossil assemblages between rocks of similar type but different age decreased as the difference in age increased.  The method was well-established before [[Charles Darwin]] explained the mechanism behind it—[[evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Gluyas, J. &amp; Swarbrick, R. (2004) Petroleum Geoscience. Publ. Blackwell Publishing. pp. 80-82&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Archeocyathids.JPG|thumb|The first reef builder is a worldwide index fossil for the Lower Cambrian]]
[[Ammonite]]s, [[graptolite]]s, [[archeocyathid]]s, and [[trilobite]]s are [[index fossil]]s that are widely used in biostratigraphy. [[micropaleontology|Microfossils]] such as [[acritarchs]], [[chitinozoa]]ns, [[conodont]]s, [[dinoflagellate]] cysts,  [[ostracods]], [[pollen]], [[spores]] and [[foraminifera]]ns are also frequently used. Different fossils work well for sediments of different ages; trilobites, for example, are particularly useful for sediments of [[Cambrian]] age. To work well, the fossils used must be widespread geographically, so that they can occur in many different places. They must also be short lived as a species, so that the period of time during which they could be incorporated in the sediment is relatively narrow. The longer lived the species, the poorer the stratigraphic precision, so fossils that evolve rapidly, such as ammonites, are favoured over forms that evolve much more slowly, like [[nautiloid]]s.  Often biostratigraphic correlations are based on a fauna, not an individual species, as this allows greater precision. Further, if only one species is present in a sample, it can mean that (1) the strata were formed in the known fossil range of that organism; (2) that the fossil range of the organism was incompletely known, and the strata extend the known fossil range.  For instance, the presence of the trace fossil ''[[Treptichnus pedum]]'' was used to define the base of the Cambrian period, but it has since been found in older strata.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Fossil assemblages were traditionally used to designate the duration of periods. Since a large change in fauna was required to make early stratigraphers create a new period, most of the periods we recognise today are terminated by a major extinction event or faunal turnover.

== Fossils as a basis for stratigraphic subdivision ==

===Concept of stage===
{{further|Faunal stage}}
A stage is a major subdivision of strata, each systematically following the other each bearing a unique assemblage of fossils. Therefore, stages can be defined as a group of strata containing the same major fossil assemblages. French [[palaeontologist]] [[Alcide d'Orbigny]] is credited for the invention of this concept. He named stages after geographic localities with particularly good sections of rock strata that bear the characteristic fossils on which the stages are based.

===Concept of zone===
{{further|Chronozone}}
In 1856 German palaeontologist [[Albert Oppel]] introduced the concept of zone (also known as biozones or Oppel zone). A zone includes strata characterised by the overlapping range of fossils. They represent the time between the appearance of species chosen at the base of the zone and the appearance of other species chosen at the base of the next succeeding zone. Oppel's zones are named after a particular distinctive fossil species, called an index fossil. Index fossils are one of the species from the assemblage of species that characterise the zone. 

The zone is the fundamental biostratigraphic unit. Its thickness range from a few to hundreds of metres, and its extant range from local to worldwide. Biostratigraphic units are divided into six principal kinds of biozones:
*''Taxon range biozone'' represent the known stratigraphic and geographic range of occurrence of a single taxon.
*''Concurrent range biozone'' include the concurrent, coincident, or overlapping part of the range of two specified taxa.
*''Interval biozone'' include the strata between two specific biostratigraphic surfaces. It can be based on lowest or highest occurrences.
*''Lineage biozone'' are strata containing species representing a specific segment of an evolutionary lineage.
*''Assemblage biozones'' are strata that contain a unique association of three or more taxa.
*''Abundance biozone'' are strata in which the abundance of a particular taxon or group of taxa is significantly greater than in the adjacent part of the section.

====Index fossils====
[[Image:DiplograptusCaneySprings.jpg|thumb|''Amplexograptus'', a [[graptolite]] index fossil, from the [[Ordovician]] near Caney Springs, [[Tennessee]].]]
To be useful in stratigraphic correlation index fossils should be:
*Independent of their environment
*Geographically widespread (provincialism/isolation of species should be avoided as much as possible)
*Rapidly evolving

*Easy to preserve (Easier in low-energy, non-oxidized environment)
*Easy to identify
====Faunal succession====
Fossil organisms succeed one           
another in a definite and determinable order and  
therefore any time period can be recognized by its 
fossil content.

[[File:Bomb Damage in London, England, April 1945 CH15118.jpg|thumb|Bomb damage to the [[City of London]] in 1945]]
A '''bombsite''' is the wreckage that remains after a bomb has destroyed a building or other structure.

==World War II bombsites==
After [[World War II]] many [[Europe]]an cities remained severely damaged from bombing. [[London]] and other British cities which had suffered the [[The Blitz|Blitz]] were pock-marked with bombsites, vacant lots covered in the rubble of destroyed buildings. Many postwar children in urban areas shared a common memory of playing their games and riding their bicycles across these desolate environments.&lt;ref&gt;

In London, [[Liverpool]], [[Bristol]], etc., across the channel in [[Berlin]] and other places these sites were constant reminders of the death and destruction of the war. This was a contributory factor to the European [[Social psychology|psycho-sociological]] outlook of the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;

==In literature and media==
The rubble of [[Vienna|Viennese]] bombsites and the remnants of the city's battered infrastructure serve as a backdrop to much of the action in the movie ''[[The Third Man (film)|The Third Man]]'', written by [[Graham Greene]], an author who would return to this bombsite motif again in his 1954 short story "[[The Destructors]]".

[[Physics]] deals with the combination of matter and energy. It also deals with a wide variety of systems, about which theories have been developed that are used by physicists. In general, theories are experimentally tested numerous times before they are accepted as correct as a description of Nature (within a certain domain of validity). For instance, the theory of [[classical mechanics]] accurately describes the motion of objects, provided they are much larger than [[atom]]s and moving at much less than the [[speed of light]]. These theories continue to be areas of active research: for instance, a remarkable aspect of classical mechanics known as [[chaos theory|chaos]] was discovered in the 20th century, three centuries after the original formulation of classical mechanics by [[Isaac Newton]] (1642–1727). These "central theories" are important tools for research in more specialized topics, and any physicist, regardless of his or her specialization, is expected to be literate in them.

==Classical mechanics==
{{main|Classical mechanics|Mechanics}}&lt;!-- where is this text to go? Jan2018: String Theory=This is a theory which combines the theory of general relativity and the quantum mechanics. This theory can predict any particle, small or large. Currently, it is under developmental phase and a lot has to be done.--&gt;

Classical mechanics is a model of the [[physics]] of [[force]]s acting upon bodies; includes sub-fields to describe the behaviors of [[solids]], [[gases]], and [[fluids]]. It is often referred to as "Newtonian mechanics" after [[Isaac Newton]] and his [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]]. It also includes the classical approach as given by [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] and [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrange]] methods. It deals with the motion of particles and general system of particles.

There are many branches of classical mechanics, such as: [[statics]], [[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]], [[kinematics]], [[continuum mechanics]] (which includes [[fluid mechanics]]), [[statistical mechanics]], etc.
*Mechanics: A branch of physics in which we study about the object and properties of an object in form of motion under the action of force.

==Thermodynamics and statistical mechanics==
{{main|Thermodynamics|Statistical mechanics}}

The first chapter of ''[[The Feynman Lectures on Physics]]'' is about the [[Atomic theory#Modern atomic theory|existence of atoms]], which Feynman considered to be the most compact statement of physics, from which science could easily result even if all other knowledge was lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Richard Phillips |last1=Feynman|authorlink1=Richard Feynman|first2= Robert Benjamin |last2=Leighton|authorlink2=Robert B. Leighton|first3=Matthew Linzee |last3=Sands |authorlink3=Matthew Sands|year= 1963|title=The Feynman Lectures on Physics| isbn= 978-0-201-02116-5 |page=1|title-link=The Feynman Lectures on Physics}}. Feynman begins with the [[atomic theory|atomic hypothesis]], as his most compact statement of all scientific knowledge: "If, in some cataclysm, all of scientific knowledge were to be destroyed, and only one sentence passed on to the next generations ..., what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words? I believe it is ... that ''all things are made up of atoms – little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another. ...''" vol. '''I''' p. I–2&lt;/ref&gt; By modeling matter as collections of hard spheres, it is possible to describe the [[kinetic theory of gases]], upon which classical thermodynamics is based.

Thermodynamics studies the effects of changes in [[temperature]], [[pressure]], and [[volume]] on [[physical system]]s on the [[macroscopic]] scale, and the transfer of energy as [[heat]].&lt;ref name="Perot"&gt;{{cite book |author=Perot, Pierre |title=A to Z of Thermodynamics |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-19-856552-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Clark, John O.E. |title=The Essential Dictionary of Science |publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble Books |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-7607-4616-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, thermodynamics developed out of the desire to increase the [[thermodynamic efficiency|efficiency]] of early [[steam engine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clausius |first=Rudolf |title=On the Motive Power of Heat, and on the Laws which can be deduced from it for the Theory of Heat |work=Poggendorff's ''Annalee dere Physic'' | chapter=LXXIX | publisher=Dover Reprint |year=1850 |isbn=978-0-486-59065-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The starting point for most thermodynamic considerations is the [[laws of thermodynamics]], which postulate that [[energy]] can be exchanged between physical systems as heat or [[Mechanical work|work]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Van Ness, H.C. |title=Understanding Thermodynamics |publisher=Dover Publications, Inc. |year=1969 |isbn=978-0-486-63277-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also postulate the existence of a quantity named [[entropy]], which can be defined for any system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dugdale, J. S. |title=Entropy and its Physical Meaning |publisher=Taylor and Francis |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-7484-0569-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In thermodynamics, interactions between large ensembles of objects are studied and categorized. Central to this are the concepts of [[System (thermodynamics)|system]] and [[Surroundings (thermodynamics)|surroundings]]. A system is composed of particles, whose average motions define its properties, which in turn are related to one another through [[Equation of state|equations of state]]. Properties can be combined to express [[internal energy]] and [[thermodynamic potential]]s, which are useful for determining conditions for [[Dynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]] and [[spontaneous process]]es.

==Relativity==
{{main|Special relativity|General relativity}}
The special theory of relativity enjoys a relationship with electromagnetism and mechanics; that is, the [[principle of relativity]] and the [[principle of stationary action]] in mechanics can be used to derive [[Maxwell's equations]],&lt;ref&gt;Landau and Lifshitz (1951, 1962), ''The Classical Theory of Fields'', Library of Congress Card Number 62-9181, Chapters 1–4 (3rd edition is {{ISBN|0-08-016019-0}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Corson and Lorrain, ''Electromagnetic Fields and Waves'' {{ISBN|0-7167-1823-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''vice versa''.

The theory of special relativity was proposed in 1905 by [[Albert Einstein]] in his article "[[Annus Mirabilis papers#Special relativity|On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies]]". The title of the article refers to the fact that special relativity resolves an inconsistency between [[Maxwell's equations]] and classical mechanics. The theory is based on [[postulates of special relativity|two postulates]]: (1) that the mathematical forms of the [[Physical law|laws of physics]] are invariant in all [[inertial frame of reference|inertial systems]]; and (2) that the [[speed of light]] in a [[vacuum]] is constant and independent of the source or observer. Reconciling the two postulates requires a unification of [[space]] and [[time in physics|time]] into the frame-dependent concept of [[spacetime]].

General relativity is the [[geometrical]] theory of [[gravitation]] published by Albert Einstein in 1915/16.&lt;ref name=Ein1915&gt;{{cite journal |last=Einstein |first=Albert |authorlink=Albert Einstein |date=November 25, 1915 |title=Die Feldgleichungen der Gravitation |journal=Sitzungsberichte der Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin |pages=844–847 |url=http://nausikaa2.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/toc/toc.x.cgi?dir=6E3MAXK4&amp;step=thumb |accessdate=2006-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ein1916&gt;{{cite journal|last=Einstein |first=Albert |title=The Foundation of the General Theory of Relativity |journal=Annalen der Physik |volume= 354|issue= 7|pages= 769-822|year=1916 |url=http://www.alberteinstein.info/gallery/gtext3.html |doi=10.1002/andp.19163540702 |format=PDF |id= |accessdate=2006-09-03 |bibcode=1916AnP...354..769E |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060829045130/http://www.alberteinstein.info/gallery/gtext3.html |archivedate=2006-08-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It unifies special relativity, [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]], and the insight that gravitation can be described by the [[curvature]] of space and time. In general relativity, the curvature of spacetime is produced by the [[energy]] of matter and radiation.

==Quantum mechanics==
{{main|Quantum mechanics}}
[[File:HAtomOrbitals.png|thumb|right|225px|The first few [[hydrogen atom]] [[Electron configuration|electron orbital]]s shown as cross-sections with color-coded [[probability amplitude|probability density]]]]
[[File:SchrodingerEquation.svg|thumb|right|225px|[[Schrödinger equation]] of [[quantum mechanics]]]]
[[Quantum mechanics]] is the branch of physics treating [[atom]]ic and [[subatomic particle|subatomic]] systems and their interaction with [[radiation]]. It is based on the observation that all forms of energy are released in discrete units or bundles called "[[quantum|quanta]]". Remarkably, quantum theory typically permits only [[probability|probable]] or [[statistics|statistical]] calculation of the observed features of subatomic particles, understood in terms of [[wave function]]s. The [[Schrödinger equation]] plays the role in quantum mechanics that [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's laws]] and [[conservation of energy]] serve in classical mechanics—i.e., it predicts the future behavior of a [[dynamical system|dynamic system]]—and is a [[wave equation]] that is used to solve for wavefunctions.

For example, the light, or electromagnetic radiation emitted or absorbed by an atom has only certain [[frequencies]] (or [[wavelength]]s), as can be seen from the [[Emission spectrum|line spectrum]] associated with the chemical element represented by that atom. The quantum theory shows that those frequencies correspond to definite energies of the light quanta, or [[photon]]s, and result from the fact that the [[electron]]s of the atom can have only certain allowed energy values, or levels; when an electron changes from one allowed level to another, a quantum of energy is emitted or absorbed whose frequency is directly proportional to the energy difference between the two levels. The [[photoelectric effect]] further confirmed the quantization of light.

In 1924, [[Louis de Broglie]] proposed that not only do light waves sometimes exhibit particle-like properties, but particles may also exhibit wave-like properties. Two different formulations of quantum mechanics were presented following de Broglie's suggestion. The [[wave|wave mechanics]] of [[Erwin Schrödinger]] (1926) involves the use of a mathematical entity, the wave function, which is related to the probability of finding a particle at a given point in space. The [[matrix mechanics]] of [[Werner Heisenberg]] (1925) makes no mention of wave functions or similar concepts but was shown to be mathematically equivalent to Schrödinger's theory. A particularly important discovery of the quantum theory is the [[uncertainty principle]], enunciated by Heisenberg in 1927, which places an absolute theoretical limit on the accuracy of certain measurements; as a result, the assumption by earlier scientists that the physical state of a system could be measured exactly and used to predict future states had to be abandoned. Quantum mechanics was combined with the theory of relativity in the formulation of [[Paul Dirac]]. Other developments include [[quantum statistics]], [[quantum electrodynamics]], concerned with interactions between charged particles and electromagnetic fields; and its generalization, [[quantum field theory]].

Also known as theory of everything, this theory combines the theory of general relativity and quantum mechanics to make a single theory. This theory can predict about properties of both small and big objects. This theory is currently under developmental stage.

A '''business college''' is a school that provides education above the high school level but could not be compared to that of a traditional [[university]] or [[college]].  Unlike universities and even [[Junior college|junior]] and [[community college]]s, business colleges typically train the student for a specific [[vocational]] aspect, usually [[clerk|clerical]] tasks such as [[typing]], [[stenography]] or simple [[bookkeeping]].

The goal of a business college is not to provide a thorough education, as is the model of modern universities in the [[Liberal Arts|liberal arts]] fields, but rather to provide training for a very specific task.  Traditionally, credits earned at a business college do not transfer to other colleges or universities and students cannot earn a [[bachelor's degree]], though an [[associate degree]] may be offered.

In recent decades the number of these institutions has been declining as business colleges have been finding more competition coming from community colleges, which provide both vocational as well as liberal arts classes and are often able to offer the classes at a lower rate of tuition, as they are usually nonprofit and subsidized by one or more levels of government.  Business colleges should not be confused with [[business school]]s which typically offer a [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) program after a student has completed a bachelor's degree.

In the US, business colleges are sometimes also called [[proprietary colleges]], especially when they grant [[associate degree]]s or higher.

==Discovery==
Long-distance electrical conductance in sediment was first observed in 2010 as a spatial separation of sulfide oxidation and oxygen reduction in marine sediment that was interrupted and re-established at a rate faster than could be explained by chemical diffusion.&lt;ref name="Nielsen2010" /&gt; It was later found that this electrical conductance could be observed across a non-conductive layer of glass microspheres, where the only possible conductive structures were filamentous bacteria belonging to the family [[Desulfobulbaceae]].&lt;ref name="Pfeffer2012" /&gt; The conductivity of single, live filaments was later demonstrated by observing the oxidation state of [[cytochromes]] using [[Raman microscopy]].&lt;ref name="Bjerg2018"&gt;Bjerg JT, Boschker HTS, Larsen S, Berry D, Schmid M, Millo D, et al.

==Morphology==
Cable bacteria filaments are 0.4—1.7&amp;nbsp;µm in diameter and up to 15&amp;nbsp;mm long.&lt;ref name="Schauer2014"&gt;Schauer R, Risgaard-Petersen N, Kjeldsen KU, Tataru Bjerg JJ, B Jørgensen B, Schramm A, et al.

==Taxonomy==
Two candidate genera of cable bacteria have been described: ''Electrothrix'' containing four candidate species, found in marine or brackish sediments, and ''Electronema'' containing two candidate species, found in freshwater sediments.&lt;ref name="Trojan2016"&gt;Trojan D, Schreiber L, Bjerg JT, Bøggild A, Yang T, Kjeldsen KU, et al. (2016). A taxonomic framework for cable bacteria and proposal of the candidate genera Electrothrix and Electronema. Syst Appl Microbiol 39: 297–306. {{doi|10.1016/j.syapm.2016.05.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; These genera are classified within the family [[Desulfobulbaceae]]. Cable bacteria are defined by their function rather than their phylogeny, and it is possible that further cable bacteria taxa will be discovered.

==Ecological significance==
Cable bacteria strongly influence the geochemical properties of the surrounding environment. Their activity promotes the oxidation of [[iron]] at the surface of the sediment, and the resulting iron oxides bind phosphorus-containing compounds&lt;ref name="Sulu-Gambari2016"&gt;Sulu-Gambari F, Seitaj D, Meysman FJR, Schauer R, Polerecky L, Slomp CP. (2016). Cable Bacteria Control Iron-Phosphorus Dynamics in Sediments of a Coastal Hypoxic Basin. Environ Sci Technol 50: 1227–1233. {{doi|10.1021/acs.est.5b04369}}&lt;/ref&gt; and hydrogen sulfide,&lt;ref name="Seitaj2015"&gt;Seitaj D, Schauer R, Sulu-Gambari F, Hidalgo-Martinez S, Malkin SY, Burdorf LDW, et al. (2015). Cable bacteria generate a firewall against euxinia in seasonally hypoxic basins. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 112: 13278–13283. {{doi|10.1073/pnas.1510152112}}&lt;/ref&gt; limiting the amount of [[phosphorus]] and [[hydrogen sulfide]] in the water. Phosphorus can cause [[eutrophication]], and [[hydrogen sulfide]] can be toxic to marine life, meaning that cable bacteria play an important role in maintaining marine ecosystems in coastal areas.

==Practical applications==
Cable bacteria have been found associated with benthic [[microbial fuel cells]], devices that convert chemical energy on the ocean floor to electrical energy.&lt;ref name="Reimers2017"&gt;Reimers CE, Li C, Graw MF, Schrader PS, Wolf M. (2017). The Identification of Cable Bacteria Attached to the Anode of a Benthic Microbial Fuel Cell: Evidence of Long Distance Extracellular Electron Transport to Electrodes. Front Microbio 8: 563. {{doi|10.1101/pdb.prot5366}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the future, cable bacteria may play a role in increasing the efficiency of [[microbial fuel cells]]. Cable bacteria have also been found associated with a bioelectrochemical system for degrading contaminating hydrocarbons in marine sediment &lt;ref name="Matturo2017"&gt;Matturro B, Cruz Viggi C, Aulenta F, Rossetti S.

Front Microbio 8: 952. {{doi|10.3389/fmicb.2017.00952}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus may play a role in future [[oil spill]] cleanup technologies.

==Extent==

In [[semiotics]], the '''commutation test''' is used to analyze a signifying system. The test identifies signifiers as well as their signifieds, [[value (Semiotics)|value]] and significance.

==The commutation test==
This test is a metalingual subjective system for analysing textual or other material. It has evolved from a limited method for investigating the structure of individual signs (per [[Roman Jakobson]]). Its primary uses are to: 
*identify distinctive signifiers,
*define their significance, and
*divide material into paradigmatic classes and identify the codes to which the signifiers belong ([[Roland Barthes]]).
The initial assumption is that the communication to be analysed represents both a cognitive use of the sign system and a statement that refers to the values of the addresser. The purpose of the test is therefore to illuminate the addresser's intention in using the code in this particular way. It works through a process of substitution, assessing the extent to which a change in the signifier leads to a change in the signified. The first step, therefore, is to exclude one signifier from the material to be analysed. This is a test of redundancy: to identify what meaning is lost (if any) by omitting that sign. It will be relatively unusual to find that one sign is completely superfluous, but more common to find that the contribution of the one sign to the whole meaning is relatively weak. The weakness or strength of its contribution can be calibrated more exactly by placing alternate (synonymous and antonymous) signs in the context. This will enable the analyst to make a judgment on the distinctiveness of the particular signifier chosen by the author/artist and of its value to the meaning, i.e. as more or less necessary for maintaining the meaning and/or rule structure in different occurrences. By changing the collocation between two of the existing signifiers, and so changing their original relationship, the relative significance of each signifier can be considered. Further, by also placing the original sign into different contexts, it can be seen whether the sign becomes more or less distinctive.

==The process==
The nature of the process will be determined by the form of the media to be analysed. In textual or pictorial media where individuals are the theme of the content, this might involve a substitution of words that are synonymous, or of imagery parallel in classes representing age, gender, ethnicity, religion, ability, etc. to assess the extent to which overall meaning is affected. In visual media generally, substituting different [[mise en scène]]s or backgrounds may change the significance of objects or people in the foreground. Colour selections may affect the perceived attractiveness of the scene or of individuals whose clothing is changed. The presence or absence of branded or generic goods, of stylish or outmoded clothing, etc. may help to suggest the contribution of the original signifier.

According to Daniel Chandler, the commutation test may involve any of four basic transformations which, to a greater or lesser extent, involve modification of the syntagm:
*Paradigmatic transformations
**[[:wikt:substitution|substitution]];
**[[:wikt:transpose|transposition]]
*Syntagmatic transformations
**[[addition]];
**[[wikt:deletion|deletion]].

==An example==
Take the phrase:
:the man hit the boy.
Now substitute "boy" with "baby", "girl", "child", "pansy", "thief". Each of these alternatives affects the implication of the phrase. A "man" rather than a father or parent randomly striking a baby or girl might be considered sexist and a crime. If the boy was a thief, this would explain but not excuse the man's behaviour as retaliation or revenge. If the boy is a pansy which has [[pejorative]] connotations of cowardice or homosexuality, the man may be intolerant or overly judgemental but the victim is also presented in a less sympathetic way. The use of child not differentiated by gender is a more common usage in the context of paedophilia. When the signifiers of boy and man are transposed, the relative inequality in strength is also reversed and the interpretation shifts to more playful and less threatening images. Hence, the subjective view may be that the phrase as originally conceived was the most neutral of the possible formulations given the original form. 

If we now contextualise the image in a school, seminary, prison, training gym or home environment different sets of meanings emerge depending on the presence or absence of other signifiers demonstrating the relationship between the protagonists, the time the image was created (a Victorian image of corporal punishment in a school would have a different significance from a more recent image of judicial caning in Britain, Canada or Singapore), the nature of the activity (e.g. a boxing training session or a game of tennis in which the blow is struck accidentally, etc.), the presence or absence of other people, etc.. The values are therefore added or subtracted according to the presence or absence of other signifiers.

==Discussion==
The first stage of development in semiotics related to the spoken and/or written form of [[language]]. Later, it was expanded to cover all [[sign (semiotics)|sign]] systems that have an [[information]]al content. As [[Umberto Eco]] says, "A sign is everything which can be taken as significantly substituting for something else." (1976)

Semiotics studies the relationship between the form of the sign (the ''signifier'') and the [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]] expressed (the ''signified''), and thereby attempts to reveal the process of communicating [[understanding]]. In each case, a message is to be sent by an addresser to an addressee. For this to occur, the addresser and addressee must use a common [[code (semiotics)|code]], Hence, language evolves dynamically. The [[community]] will identify a [[lexical (semiotics)|lexical]] thing that needs to be referred to in their language. By common agreement, a sign (sometimes called a ''signal'') will be selected. Of the many possible shades of meanings that it can be used to convey, one or more will be selected and ''encoded'', i.e. the chosen meaning(s) will be [[denotation (semiotics)|denoted]] or associated with the sign within the broader framework of [[syntactic]] and [[semantic]] systems available within the community. When the [[audience]] is exposed to the sign, the expectation is that they will be able to decode the meaning. As [[Roman Jakobson]] adds, there will also be an [[emotion]]al element or [[value (Semiotics)|value]] which represents the addresser's [[attitude (psychology)|attitude]] towards the ''thing''. This will either become a [[connotation (Semiotics)|connotative]] meaning attached directly to the sign itself, or it will be communicated by the context in which the sign is used by the addresser. 

In [[lexicography]], the fact that a  [[neologism]] is used marks its acceptance into the language. This will not be a difficult process so long as each sign has a limited and immediately useful meaning. The problem arises when several possible meanings or shades of meaning become associated with the sign. This is a shift from denotational to connotational meanings. Rules of interpretation are required to resolve uncertainty. Within the community, such rules are, for the most part, experiential and applied without conscious control. Members of a [[community]] have a shared [[memory]] of language [[pattern]]s and [[norm (philosophy)|norm]]s which, for the most part, are stable over long periods of time. [[Individual]]s are therefore able to build up a [[cognitive]] framework which identifies the possible meanings from any grouping of signs and selects one considered the most appropriate from the context. This [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]] system is continuously tested through the audience's responses. If the responses are satisfying, intuition prevails. If the responses are obviously inappropriate, the audience will consciously review the thought process and decide whether to modify the framework. Semiotics has developed a more precise methodology for this interpretive process, seeking to expose the unstated habitual practices for interpreting signifiers.

'''Darwinian anthropology''' describes an approach to [[anthropology|anthropological]] analysis which employs various theories from [[Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] [[evolutionary biology]]. Whilst there are a number of areas of research that can come under this broad description (Marks, 2004)&lt;ref name="M2004" /&gt; some specific research projects have been closely associated with the label. A prominent example is the project that developed in the mid 1970s with the goal of applying [[sociobiology|sociobiological]] perspectives to explain patterns of human social relationships, particularly [[kinship]] patterns across human cultures.

This kinship-focused Darwinian anthropology was a significant intellectual forebear of [[evolutionary psychology]], and both draw on biological theories of the evolution of social behavior (in particular [[inclusive fitness]] theory) upon which the field of [[sociobiology]] was founded.

==Overview==

In 1974 the biologist [[Richard D. Alexander]] published an article ''The Evolution of Social Behavior'' which drew upon [[W.D.Hamilton]]'s work on [[inclusive fitness]] and [[kin selection]] and noted that:

{{quote|Although ten years have passed since Hamilton's landmark papers, apparently only a single social scientist (Campbell, 31) has made a distinct effort to incorporate  kin  selection  into theories  of human  altruism... But so have the biologists,  for one reason or another,  failed to consider the enormous literature on  topics  like  kinship  systems  and reciprocity in human behavior. (Alexander 1974, 326)&lt;ref name="A1974" /&gt;}}

Amongst other suggestions, Alexander suggested that certain patterns of social cooperation documented by ethnographers, in particular the [[avunculate]] ('mother's brother') relationship, could be explained in reference to individuals pursuing a strategy of individual inclusive fitness maximization under conditions of low certainty-of-paternity. This hypothesis was subsequently taken up and elaborated in a series of studies by other Darwinian anthropologists:

{{quote|The hypothesis follows that matrilineal inheritance is a cultural trait that evolved in response to low probability of paternity. [...] The  paternity  hypothesis  was  rescued  and  made  explicit  in  the  context  of  modern evolutionary theory by Alexander in 1974. Over the next 10 years this provided the impetus  leading  to  numerous  theoretical  refinements  and  scholarly  and  empirical investigations  (Flinn  1981;  Gaulin  &amp;  Schlegel  1980;  Greene  1978;  Hartung  1981b; Kurland 1979).(Hartung 1985,661-663) &lt;ref name="H1985" /&gt;}}

Ultimately these analyses were considered unsuccessful, and were specifically criticized by other sociobiologists on a number of grounds. One problem was said to be that interpreting [[inclusive fitness]] theory to imply that individuals have evolved the characteristic of pursuing strategies to maximize their own 'inclusive fitness' is erroneous; the theory should instead be interpreted to describe selection pressures on genes:

{{quote|Alexander’s argument... erred through looking at things from the point of view of an ''individual''... I believe this kind of error is all too easy to make when we use the technical term ‘fitness’ [of individuals]. This is why I have avoided using the term in this book. There  is really only one entity  whose point of view  matters in evolution, and that entity is the selfish gene.(Dawkins 1989 (1976), 137 emphasis in original)  &lt;ref name="D1989" /&gt;}}

A related problem was that, in assuming that individuals simply operate as inclusive fitness maximizing agents, any investigation of the proximate psychological mechanisms that mediate social behaviors was ignored. Symons made this observation in his 1989 ''Critique of Darwinian Anthropology'':

{{quote|DA’s  central  hypothesis  is  that  “evolved  behavioral  tendencies”  cause  human “behavior  to  assume  the  form  that  maximizes  inclusive  fitness”(Irons  1979b,  33). Turke  and  Betzig  (1985)  state  this  hypothesis  as  a  formal  prediction:  “Modern Darwinian theory predicts that human behavior will be adaptive, that is, designed to promote  maximum  reproductive  success  through  available  descendant  and nondescendant relatives.”(p 79)… [T]he key terms in [this] quotation are used in DA to  bypass  the  question  of  phenotypic  design  in  characterizations  of  adaptation.(Symons 1989, 131-132) &lt;ref name="S1989" /&gt;}}

Symons, along with Tooby and Cosmides, were amongst the founders of the emerging school of [[evolutionary psychology]], whose aim has been to focus more on these hypothesized proximate psychological mechanisms.

==Theoretical background==

Darwinian anthropology was critiqued by Symonds for its agnosticism as to the psychological mechanisms governing how social behavior is actually expressed in the human species, and its reliance on interpreting [[inclusive fitness]] theory to simply imply that ''humans have evolved to be inclusive fitness maximizers''. This section will review some of the relevant background discussion in inclusive fitness theory to clarify why this position was considered untenable.

===Evolutionary  versus proximate explanations===
{{see also|Tinbergen's four questions}}

Inclusive Fitness theory has often been interpreted to mean that ''social behavior per se is a goal of evolution'', and also that  genes (or individual organisms) are selected to find ways of actively distinguishing the identity of close genetic relatives ‘in order to’ engage in social behaviors with them.

{{quote|[M]any misunderstandings persist.  In many cases, they result from conflating “coefficient of relatedness” and “proportion of  shared genes,” which is a short step from the intuitively appealing—but incorrect—interpretation that “animals tend to be altruistic toward those with whom they share a lot of genes.” These misunderstandings don’t just crop up occasionally; they are repeated  in many writings, including undergraduate psychology textbooks—most of them in the field of social psychology, within sections describing evolutionary approaches to altruism. (Park 2007, p860)&lt;ref name="P2007"&gt;Park, J.H. (2007) ''Persistent Misunderstandings of Inclusive Fitness and Kin Selection: Their Ubiquitous Appearance in Social Psychology Textbooks''. Evolutionary Psychology 5(4): 860-873.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The apparent rationale for this common mis-interpretation is that organisms  ''would'' thereby benefit  the  “Inclusive  Fitness  of  the  individuals  (and  genes) involved”.  This approach  overlooks the point that evolution is not a [[Teleology#Teleology_and_science|teleological]] process, but  a  passive, consequential  and  undirected biological process, where environmental variations and drift effects are present alongside random gene mutations and natural selection.

Inclusive fitness theory takes the form of an [[Proximate and ultimate causation|ultimate explanation]], specifically a criterion (br&gt;c), for the evolution of social behaviors, not a [[Proximate and ultimate causation|proximate mechanism]] governing the expression of social behaviors. What forms of social behavior might meet this criterion are cannot be ''a priori'' specified by the theory, nor can it shed light on whether the life history of a species provides opportunities for social interactions to occur. Thus, strictly speaking, the interpretation that organisms ‘have evolved to’ direct social behavior towards genetic relatives is not implied by the theory (see also [[inclusive fitness]]).

Investigating how inclusive fitness theory might apply to the potential emergence of social traits in any  given  species  must begin  with  an  analysis  of  the evolutionarily  typical [[ecological niche]], demographics, and patterns of interaction of that species. Where significant interaction between individuals is not present in the [[life history theory|life history]] of a species, the theory is necessarily null regarding social behaviors between individuals. As Silk (2001) put it;

{{quote|The role of kinship in the daily lives of animals depends on the demographic composition of the groups in which they live. Kin selection will  only  be  an  important  force  in  the  evolution  of  social  behavior  if animals  find  themselves  in  situations  where  they  have  an  opportunity  to  fulfill  the predictions of  Hamilton’s  rule.  At  a  minimum,  kin  must  be  available. The  number, availability,  and  degree  of  relatedness  among  kin  will  depend  on  how  groups  are constructed in nature.” (Silk 2001, 77)&lt;ref name="S2001" /&gt;}}

Consideration  must thus be given to whether the ecological niche leads to the clustering of individuals in groups or whether individuals are typically solitary. [[Socioecology]] research, for example, suggests that fundamental influences on demographic patterns are the distribution/fecundity of primary food sources as well as patterns of predation. When considering social behavior traits of a given species, consideration of these influences is in a sense, logically prior to analyses of inclusive fitness pressures on the species.

===Selection pressure on genes or strategy of individuals===

Darwinian anthropology, following R. D. Alexander, used the notion of the ''inclusive fitness of individuals'' rather than ''the inclusive fitness of genes''. Dawkins (above) pointed to this as an error. The source of the confusion can be traced to discussions in Hamilton's early papers on inclusive fitness. In his 1963 paper Hamilton refers, unambiguously, to selection pressures on genes;

{{quote|[T]he  ultimate  criterion  which  determines  whether  G  [a  gene]  will  spread  is  not whether the behaviour is to the benefit of the behaver but whether it is to the benefit of the gene G; and this will be the case if the average net result of the behaviour is to add  to  the  gene  pool  a  handful  of  genes  containing  G  in  higher  concentration  than does the gene pool itself.” (1996 [1963], 7)&lt;ref name="H1963" /&gt;}}

However, in his paper published in 1964, actually written before the 1963 paper (Hamilton 1996), Hamilton had included a subsidiary discussion on what the genetic theory might imply for how we look at the fitness of individuals:

{{quote|Actually,  in  the  preceding  mathematical  account  we  were  not  concerned  with  the inclusive fitness of individuals as described here but rather with certain averages of them which we call the inclusive fitness of types. But the idea of the inclusive fitness of an individual is nevertheless a useful one. Just as in the sense of classical selection we may consider whether a given character expressed in an individual is adaptive in the sense of being in the interest of his personal fitness or not, so in the present sense of selection we may consider whether the character or trait of behaviour is or is not adaptive in the sense if being in the interest of his inclusive fitness.” (Hamilton 1996 [1964], 38)&lt;ref name="H1964" /&gt;}}

It is clear here that the formal treatment is of the selection pressures on types (genes or traits), whilst the notion of individual inclusive fitness may serve as a guide to the adaptiveness of the trait; just as consideration of effects of a trait on an individual's fitness can be instructive when considering classical selection on traits. At the same time, it is understandable that Alexander took the inclusive fitness of individuals as a heuristic device.

===Context-based or discrimination-based expression mechanisms===

In his 1964 paper, Hamilton 'hazards' “the  following  unrigorous  statement  of  the  main  principle  that  has emerged from the model”;

{{quote|The  Social  behaviour  of  a  species  evolves  in  such  a  way  that  in  each  distinct behaviour-evoking situation the individual will seem to value his neighbours’ fitness against  his  own  according  to  the  coefficients  of  relationship  appropriate  to  that situation.”(1964 [1996], 49)&lt;ref name="H1964" /&gt;}}

He uses the terms 'hazards', 'unrigorous', and 'will seem' deliberately, since his formal analysis makes clear that the model specifies the evolutionary selection pressure, rather than specifying what mechanisms govern the proximate expression of social behaviors. He also clearly points to social behaviors being evoked in distinct situations, and that individuals may encounter potential social recipients of different degree of relationship in different situations. If one ignores the cautious qualifying words however, the passage might readily be interpreted to imply that individuals are indeed expected to make an active assessment of the degree of relatedness of others they interact with in different situations. Later in the paper, Hamilton again discusses the issue of whether the performance (or expression) of social behaviors might be conditional on; (a) discriminating factors which correlate with close relationship with the recipient, or (b) actually discriminating which individuals 'really are' in close relationship with the recipient:

{{quote|The  selective  advantage  which  makes  behaviour  conditional  in  the  right  sense  on the  discrimination  of  factors  which  correlate  with  the  relationship  of  the  individual concerned  is  therefore  obvious.  It  may  be,  for  instance,  that  in  respect  of  a  certain social  action  performed  towards  neighbours  indiscriminately,  an  individual  is  only just breaking even in terms of inclusive fitness. If he could learn to recognise those of  his  neighbours  who  really  were  close  relatives  and  could  devote  his  beneficial actions to them alone an advantage to inclusive fitness would at once appear. Thus a mutation causing such discriminatory behaviour itself benefits inclusive  fitness and would be selected. In fact, the individual may not need to perform any discrimination so sophisticated as we  suggest here; a difference in the generosity of his behaviour according to whether the situations evoking it were encountered near to, or far from, his own home might occasion an advantage of a similar kind.” (1996 [1964], 51)&lt;ref name="H1964" /&gt;}}

For certain social behaviors, Hamilton suggests there may be selection pressure for more discerning discrimination of genetic relatedness, were the mutation to occur. But 'in fact' the same net result of accurately targeting social behaviors towards genetic relatives could be achieved via a simpler mechanism of being expressed in proximity to the actor's 'home'. Hamilton is thus agnostic as to whether evolved social behaviors might be expressed via straightforward proximate mechanisms such as location-based cues, or whether more specific discriminatory powers might govern their expression. He does suggest that the distinct social contexts within which various social behaviors are expressed are factors to consider. Other theorists have discussed these questions of whether proximity, context or more discriminatory expression may govern behaviors:

{{quote|Animals cannot, of course, be expected to know, in a cognitive sense, who their relatives are, and in practice the behaviour that is favoured by natural selection will be equivalent to a rough rule of thumb such as ‘share food with anything that moves in the nest in which you are sitting.’ If families happen to go around in groups, this fact provides a useful rule of thumb for kin selection: ‘care for any individual you often see’.” (Dawkins 1979, 187)&lt;ref name="D1979" /&gt;}}

{{quote|If, for example, animals behave with an equal degree of altruism to all their “neighbours”… and if ''on average'' animals are related to their neighbours, then I would regard this as an example of kin selection. It is not a necessary feature of kin selection that an animal should distinguish different degrees of relationship among its neighbours, and behave with greater  altruism to the more closely related…”(Maynard Smith 1976, 282 emphasis in original)&lt;ref name="MS1976" /&gt;}}

Dawkins believes social behaviors will in practice be governed by context-based expression. Maynard Smith is, like Hamilton, agnostic, but reiterates the point that context-based cues might well govern their expression and that actively distinguishing relatives is not necessarily expected for the expression of those social traits whose evolution is governed by inclusive fitness criteria. In sum, inclusive fitness theory does imply that; ''the evolutionary emergence'' of social behavior can occur where there is statistical association of genes between social actors and recipients; but that ''the expression'' of such evolved social behaviors is not necessarily governed by actual genetic relatedness between participants. The evolutionary criterion and the proximate mechanism must thus not be confused: the first does require genetic association (of the form br&gt;c), the second does not.

Darwinian anthropology's central premise that human behavior ''has evolved to maximize the inclusive fitness of individuals'' is thus not a logical derivative of the theory. Also, the notion that ''humans will discriminate social behaviors towards genetic relatives'' is again not entailed by the theory.

==Reception by anthropologists==

Before the questions raised within anthropology about the study of ‘kinship’ by Schneider &lt;ref name="S1984" /&gt; and others from the 1960s onwards, anthropology itself had paid very little attention to the  notion that social bonds were anything other than connected to consanguinal (or genetic) relatedness (or its local cultural conceptions).  The social bonding associated  with  provision  of and sharing of food was one important exception, particularly in the work of Richards,&lt;ref name="R1932" /&gt; but this was largely ignored by descriptions of ‘kinship’ till more recently.  Although questioning the means by which ‘kinship bonds’ form, few of these early accounts questioned the fundamental role of ‘procreative ties’ in social bonding (Schneider, 1984). From the 1950s onwards, reports on kinship patterns in the New Guinea Highlands added some momentum to what had until then been only occasional fleeting suggestions that living together (co-residence) might underlie social bonding, and eventually contributed to the general shift away from a genealogical approach. For example, on the basis of his observations, Barnes suggested:

{{quote|[C]learly, genealogical connexion of some sort is one criterion for membership of many social groups. But it may not be the only criterion; birth, or residence, or a parent’s former residence, or utilization of garden land, or participation in exchange and feasting activities or in house-building or raiding, may be other relevant criteria for group membership.”(Barnes 1962,6)&lt;ref name="B1962" /&gt;}}

Similarly, Langness' ethnography of the ''Bena Bena'' also emphasized a break with the genealogical perspective:

{{quote|''The sheer fact of residence in a Bena Bena group can and does determine kinship.''  People do not necessarily reside where they do because they are kinsmen: rather they become  kinsmen because they reside there.”  (Langness 1964, 172 emphasis in original)&lt;ref name="L1964" /&gt;}}

By 1972, Schneider&lt;ref name="S1968" /&gt;&lt;ref name="S1972" /&gt; had raised deep problems with the notion that human social bonds and 'kinship' was a natural category built upon genealogical ties (for more information, see [[kinship]]), and especially in the wake of his 1984 critique&lt;ref name="S1984" /&gt; this has become broadly accepted by most, if not all, anthropologists.&lt;ref name="C2000" /&gt;

The darwinian anthropology (and other sociobiological) perspectives, arising in the early 1970s, had not unreasonably assumed that the genealogical conceptions of human kinship, in place since Morgan's early work&lt;ref name="M1870" /&gt; in the 1870s, were still valid as a universal feature of humans. But they emerged at precisely the time that anthropology, being particularly sensitive about its own apparent 'ethnocentric' generalizations about kinship (from cultural particulars to human universals) was seeking to distance itself from these conceptions. The vehemence of Sahlins' rebuttal of sociobiology's genetic relatedness perspective in his 1976 ''The use and abuse of Biology'', which underlined the non-genealogical nature of human kinship, can be understood as part of this 'distancing' trend.

==Alternative approaches==

The lack of success of darwinian anthropology created space for alternative approaches to analyzing human social behaviors from a biological perspective. Alexander's initial point (above) that the inclusive fitness framework had been scarcely applied to human kinship and social patterns has remained largely valid. But the move away from genealogical kinship in anthropology has continued to be a major barrier to any potential resolution. This section reviews a range of approaches to synthesizing ideas from  evolutionary biology to observations and data about human social behaviour across contemporary human populations. Whilst some of these approaches include the inclusive fitness approach, others may seek to demonstrate fit to other theories from evolutionary biology, or to demonstrate that certain proximate mechanisms of social behaviour are both compatible with the inclusive fitness approach, and also with the broad variety of ethnographic data on human kinship patterns.

==Criticism==

Theories in evolutionary biology relevant to understanding social behavior may not be limited to frameworks such as inclusive fitness theory. The theory of [[reciprocal altruism]] may have equal or greater explanatory power for some forms of human social behavior, and perhaps kinship patterns. Other approaches may maintain that human behavior is less amenable to biological analysis due to the prominent influence of social learning and cultural transmission in the human species, and instead advance ideas based on the role of e.g. culture, historical contingencies or economic/environmental conditions. All or any of these may or may not contribute valuable insights to our understanding of social behavior and social patterns in humans.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4652">'''Delbard''' is a [[plant nursery]] in [[France]] known for breeding disease resistant [[apple]] and various [[rose]]s.&lt;ref name =tent&gt;[http://nztentation.com/about.php Tentation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Good&gt;[http://www.goodfruit.com/breeder-focuses-on-resistance/ Good Fruits]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Rosa 'Dioressence' Delbard-Chabert 1984 RPO.jpg|thumb|'Dioressence', a rose cultivar developed by 'Delbard' in 1984.]]
Delbard Nursery was founded by and named after George Delbard, who was breeding fruit trees more than seventy years ago, at his family farm in the area of [[Malicorne, Allier]] in central France. Later on, he added roses, [[dahlia]]s, and other flowers to his breeding work. This business is continued and expanded by his grandson Arnaud Delbard, who is working close with the [[Institut national de la recherche agronomique]] which is a French governmental organization, as well as with other international collaboration for global [[selective breeding]].&lt;ref name=Good/&gt;
[[File:Rosa Folle courtisane - Delbard 1988 Francia.JPG|thumb|'Folle courtisane' a cream rose cultivar developed by 'Delbar' in 1988.]]

==Apple breeding==

Delbard was first in France to create a breeding program for disease resistant [[apple cultivars]],&lt;ref name=Good/&gt; located near [[Commentry]], France, it is called "Delbard Pepinieres International".&lt;ref name =world/&gt;

This is done internationally by screening selections and mutations of seedlings and variations of the domesticated apple, some of which have adapted to resist certain [[apple diseases]]. Another approach is to find the resistant genes in certain [[species]] of [[crab apple]] which is the ancestor of the domesticated apple, and to introduce those desired traits through [[backcrossing]].&lt;ref name=Good/&gt;

Altogether, the apples still needs to taste good as well, so this involves years of experiments, tasting and testing to provide a good apple for the consumer, which should be disease resistant and of good flavor, texture and looks.&lt;ref name=Good/&gt;

Jean-Paul Reynoird, Delbard’s research director says, that only about twenty selections out of 2,000 hybrids initiated, will make it till the end. Delbard has a separate program for [[pear]] breeding, aiming to combat [[fireblight]].&lt;ref name=Good/&gt;
[[File:Malus Delbard Jubilée 4497.jpg|thumb|[[Delbard Jubilee]] is an [[apple cultivars|apple cultivar]] developed by Delbard.]]
One of the very special apple cultivars developed by Delbard is the [[Tentation apple]] also called Dellblush&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyshs.org/pdf/fq/2005-Volume-13/Vol-13-No-1/Recent-Advances-in-Apple-Breeding,-Genetics-and-New-Cultivars.pdf Recent advances in Apple Breeding]&lt;/ref&gt; which is limited for cultivation to [[New Zealand]],&lt;ref name =tent/&gt; [[Delbard Jubilee]] and [[Delbarestivale]] which has excellent taste in Southern [[Indiana, USA]] for
a mid season apple.&lt;ref name =world&gt;[http://evercrispapple.com/_PDF/_Newsletters/2002newsletter.pdf Apple Breeding Worldwide]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tissue culture==

Tissue culture started at Delbard in the early '80s when they began to use fragments of stems and green tissue of certified virus-free mother stock to grow plant material [[in vitro]]. The [[cloning|clonal]] modern approach, is still under the classification of [[vegetative propagation]], hence reproducing [[true to type]]. This is used for fruits as well as for flower and roses. In the fruit tree department which itself is producing 300,000 trees annually, two thirds are sold at the retail garden centers directly to the private customers, usually in [[bonsai]] containers or pots, and one third is sold for commercial growers. Plants sold for private user needs, which are carefully raised to perfection and already ready to fruit, are usually marked with a "W".&lt;ref name=Good/&gt;

==Regenesis==
Delbard is utilizing to barn new technology called "[[regeneration (biology)|regenesis]]" which involves the use of [[irradiation]] to force [[mutation]]s from tissue culture material in vitro. Then they regenerate a bud from the irradiated cells. This is done with hope to change only a few undesirable characteristics of a plant and preserve its overall combination of traits.&lt;ref name=Good/&gt;

As of today this business is producing nursery stock material for commercial growers, as well as for forty retail garden centers. The nursery area covers six hundred hectares or about 1,500 acres, of sheltered [[greenhouse]]s and open field plantations.&lt;ref name=Good/&gt;

}}'''Denise Scott Brown''' (née '''Lakofski'''; born October 3, 1931) is an American [[architect]], planner, writer, educator, and principal of the firm Venturi, Scott Brown and Associates in [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lumiere.lib.vt.edu/iawa_db/view_all.php3?person_pk=343&amp;table=bio&amp;|title=View all information for Denise Scott Brown|work=vt.edu|accessdate=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott Brown and her husband and partner, [[Robert Venturi]], are regarded as among the most influential architects of the twentieth century, both through their architecture and planning, and theoretical writing and teaching.

==Education and teaching==

Born to Jewish parents Simon and Phyllis (Hepker) Lakofski, Denise Lakofski had the vision from the time she was five years old that she would be an architect. Pursuing this goal, she spent her summers working with architects, and from 1948 to 1952, studied in [[South Africa]] at the [[University of the Witwatersrand]]. She briefly entered [[liberal politics]], but was frustrated by the lack of acceptance of women in the field. Lakofski traveled to [[London]] in 1952, working for the [[Modernist architecture|modernist]] architect [[Frederick Gibberd]]. She continued her education there, winning admission to the [[Architectural Association School of Architecture]] to learn “useful skills in the building of a just South Africa,” within an intellectually rich environment which embraced women. She was joined there by Robert Scott Brown, whom she had met at Witwatersrand in 1954, and graduated with a degree in architecture in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brownlee|first1=David B.|last2=De Long|first2=David G.|last3=Whitaker|first3=Kathryn|title=Out of the Ordinary|date=2001|publisher=Philadelphia Museum of Art|location=Philadelphia, PA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Denise Lakofski and Robert Scott Brown were married on July 21, 1955. The couple spent the next three years working and traveling throughout Europe, and in 1958, they moved to [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], to study at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s planning department. In 1959, Robert died in a car accident. Denise Scott Brown completed her master's degree in city planning in 1960 and, upon graduation, became a faculty member at the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2005/06.09/15-radmedal.html|title=Harvard Gazette: Architect to receive Radcliffe Medal|author=Harvard News Office|work=harvard.edu|accessdate=25 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303215447/http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2005/06.09/15-radmedal.html|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While teaching, she completed a master's degree in architecture.  At a 1960 faculty meeting, she argued against demolishing the university's library (now the [[Furness Library|Fisher Fine Arts Library]]), designed by [[Philadelphia]] architect [[Frank Furness]]. At the meeting, she met [[Robert Venturi]], a young architect and fellow professor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/lessons-from-las-vegas/|title=Lessons from Las Vegas - 99% Invisible|work=99% Invisible|access-date=2018-04-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two became collaborators and taught courses together from 1962 to 1964. Scott Brown left the University of Pennsylvania in 1965. Becoming known as a scholar in [[urban planning]], she taught at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and was then named co-chair of the Urban Design Program at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]]. During her years in the Southwest, Scott Brown became interested in the newer cities of [[Los Angeles]] and [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]. She invited Venturi to visit her classes at [[UCLA]], and in 1966 asked him to visit [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] with her. The two were married in [[Santa Monica, California]], on July 23, 1967. Scott Brown moved back to [[Philadelphia]] in 1967 to join Robert Venturi's firm, Venturi and Rauch, and became principal in charge of planning in 1969.  Denise Scott Brown later taught at [[Yale University]], and in 2003 was a visiting lecturer with Venturi at [[Harvard University]]'s [[Graduate School of Design]].

==Architecture and planning==
[[File:Denise Scott Brown 1978 © Lynn Gilbert.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Denise Scott Brown in 1978, photographed by [[Lynn Gilbert]]]]
In 1972, with Venturi and [[Steven Izenour]], Scott Brown wrote ''[[Learning from Las Vegas|Learning From Las Vegas: the Forgotten Symbolism of Architectural Form]]''. The book published studies of the [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] Strip, undertaken with students in an architectural research studio course which Scott Brown taught with Venturi in 1970 at [[Yale]]'s School of Architecture and Planning. The book joined Venturi's previous ''Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture'' ([[Museum of Modern Art]], 1966) as a rebuke to orthodox modernism and elite architectural tastes, and a pointed acceptance of American sprawl and vernacular architecture.  The book coined the terms "Duck" and "Decorated Shed" as applied to opposing architectural styles. Scott Brown has remained a prolific writer on architecture and urban planning.

Scott Brown and Venturi strove for understanding the city in terms of social, economic and cultural perspectives, viewing it as a set of complex systems upon planning. As part of their design process, the Venturi, Scott Brown &amp; Associates firm studies the trends of an area, marking future expansions or congestions. These studies influence plans and design makeup. Such an approach was used for their Berlin Tomorrow Competition, putting the population movement and daily pattern in consideration. Similarly, the [[Bryn Mawr College]] plan took into consideration the landmark of the early campus and the usages of campus space prior to planning.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=von Moos|first1=Stanislaus|title=Venturi Scott Brown &amp; Associates Buildings and Projects, 1986-1998|date=1999|publisher=The Monacelli Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Scott Brown holds a systematic approach to planning in what is coined as “FFF studios.” In it, form, forces and function determine and help define the urban environment.&lt;ref name="Out of the Ordinary"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brownlee|first1=David B.|last2=De Long|first2=David G.|last3=Hiesinger|first3=Kathryn B.|title=Out of the Ordinary|date=2001|publisher=Department of Publishing|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Venturi, Scott Brown &amp; Associates firm studied both the expansion of Dartmouth College campus along with the wilderness surrounding the perimeter of the area.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

The fusion of Eastern and Western ideas in the [[Nikko Hotels|Nikko hotel chain]] are evident by merging the Western notion of comfort (62 Stanislaus Von Moos) with historical [[kimono]] patterns with their hidden order. The architecture applies a post-Las Vegas modern feel while projecting the traditional Japanese shopping street. Guest rooms are typically made with Western taste, with fabrics, wallpaper, and carpet exclusively from the Venturi, Scott Brown &amp; Associates firm that reflect the scenery outside. In contrast, the exterior “street” complex reflects Japanese urban and traditional life.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

With the firm, renamed Venturi, Rauch and Scott Brown in 1980, and finally Venturi, Scott Brown and Associates in 1989, Scott Brown has led major civic planning projects and studies, and more recently has directed many university campus planning projects. By the beginning of the 1980s, Venturi and Brown had made huge success with their ideas and concepts. Critics characterized them as the most influential and visionary architects of the time and continued their path with a clear approach, with their radical theories of design.&lt;ref name="Out of the Ordinary"/&gt; She has also served as principal-in-charge with [[Robert Venturi]] on the firm's larger architectural projects, including the [[Sainsbury Wing]] of [[London National Gallery|London's National Gallery]], the capitol building in [[Toulouse]] and the Nikko Hotel and Spa Resort in [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vsba.com/whoweare/index_team.html|title=VSBA Homepage|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Women In Design, a student organization spearheaded by Caroline Amory James and Arielle Assouline-Lichten&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/#/news/caroline-james-and-arielle-assouline-lichten-honored-by-bwaf.html|title=Harvard Graduate School of Design  - Homepage|work=harvard.edu|accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]] started a petition for Scott Brown to receive joint recognition with her partner [[Robert Venturi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/18/arts/design/bid-for-pritzker-prize-to-acknowledge-denise-scott-brown.html?ref=design| work= The New York Times |title = Partner Without the Prize| accessdate= April 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When awarded the [[Jane Drew Prize]] in 2017 Scott Brown referred to the Pritzer controversy and subsequent petition saying "I was very touched by the Pritzker petition – and that is my prize in the end. 20,000 people wrote from all over the world and every one of them called me Denise."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/denise-scott-brown-recognised-with-2017-jane-drew-prize/10017080.article|title = Denise Scott Brown recognised with 2017 Jane Drew Prize| accessdate= February 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Room at the top ===
In 1989, Scott Brown published her famous essay, "Room at the top? Sexism and the Star System in Architecture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic753413.files/14_Outsiders%20in%20the%20Profession/Brown_Sexism.pdf |format=PDf|title=Room at the top? Sexism and the Star System in Architecture|website=www.isites.harvard.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Scott Brown wrote the essay in 1975, she decided not to publish it at the time, out of fear for damaging her career. The essay describes her struggle to be recognized as an equal partner of the firm, in an architecture world that was predominantly male. She has since been an advocate for Women in Architecture and has spoken out about discrimination within the profession on several accounts.

[[File:Mechanical door closer.jpg|thumb|right|Modern manual door closer]]
A '''door closer''' is a [[mechanical device]] that closes a [[door]], in general after someone opens it, or after it was automatically opened. 

==Types==
[[File:PERKO-POWER controlled concealed jamb-mounted door closer.jpg|thumb|A concealed jamb-mounted door closer]]

There are four styles of interior door-closer:

* Surface-mounted
* Concealed in frame
* Concealed in floor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.constructionwitness.com/Published-Articles/Doors-Door-Closers-Door-Hardware/Concealed-Door-Closers.aspx |title=Concealed Door Closers |author=Michael Panish |work=Michael Panish: Construction Expert Witness and Consultant |accessdate=January 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Concealed in door

Surface-mounted door closers come in four variations: slide-track arm, regular arm surface mounted, parallel arm surface mounted, and top jamb mounted. Overhead door closers are typically surface mounted, some manufacturers offer concealed models too. Such closers mount inside a pocket in the door frame or are mounted in the floor directly under the pivot point and are completely concealed.

Another type of door closer, a surface mounted one, is attached to the door frame behind the door (where the hinges are) next to the middle hinge. The "arm" rests against the door, and a spring that is bent by the user opening the door closes the door by retracting to its proper shape.

There is also the storm door and screen door variation of the door closer: As the name implies, these piston shaped closers are used on storm, security, and screen doors which give the home an extra line of defense against weather, intruders, and insects.  Whereas interior closers typically use hydraulics, storm door closers are more typically pneumatic, using air and springs to close the door.  Storm Door closers generally have a small metal washer on the rod that is used to lock the closer in the open position when moving stuff in or out, but more recent models such as the Touch 'n Hold door closer have a button to actuate the hold open feature to make this process easier.

Finally, there is the concealed, jamb-mounted door closer, which fits in morticed recesses in the door and door frame and is totally concealed when the door is closed. These are available in controlled and uncontrolled versions, selected according to the application for which they are intended.

===Manual===
[[File:BKS-Türschließer.jpg|thumb|right|Old type of manual door closer (made by BKS)]]
A manual door closer stores the energy used in the opening of the door in a compression or torsion spring and releases it to close the door. Some closers allow for adjustment of the strength of the spring, making it easier or more difficult to push the door open. To limit the speed at which the door closes, most door closers use hydraulic (oil-filled) dampers, although spring mechanisms may also be used for damping. Some closers incorporate a back-check facility which prevents the door from being opened too fast; this is useful for, for example, external doors where there is a danger of wind catching and blowing it open, something which could otherwise cause damage to the doorset and/or objects and/or people near it. The speed at which the door closer closes the door may be adjustable by up to three adjustment valves. These valves often adjust the sweep speed and the latch speed of the door and some closers are optioned with a delayed action valve. The latch speed is the speed that the door travels in the last third to 10 degrees as it closes and is often set fast so that the door can properly latch closed. The sweep speed is the speed which the door travels at along the first two thirds of its travel and is often set slower than the latch speed. For openings where a much longer close time is desired, one may opt for a delayed action closer. The delayed action valve slows the sweep speed dramatically for roughly the first half of the sweep range. Door closers which provide this two or three-stage action and close doors at a determined rate are called 'controlled' door closers.

===Automatic===

An automatic door closer (more often called a "door opener") opens the door itself, typically under the control of a [[push button]], [[motion detector]] or other device, and then closes it as well, typically employing a motion or [[proximity detector]] to determine when it is safe to close the door.

==Control of closing force and speed==
Closers often feature dampers that offer control over the closing force and speed. Such dampers are usually hydraulic or pneumatic [[dashpot]]s.

==Usage==
===Fire safety===

Door closers are most commonly installed on [[fire door]]s, which need to be closed in case of fire, to help prevent the spread of fire and smoke. In most countries, their performance will be governed by national standards.

===Maintaining room temperatures===

Door closers also play a role in maintaining average cooling temperatures, since colder air does not vent out for longer periods if the door remains closed for longer periods on average.

'''Earth Overshoot Day''' ('''EOD'''), previously known as '''Ecological Debt Day''' ('''EDD'''), is the calculated illustrative calendar date on which humanity’s [[resource consumption]] for the year exceeds [[Earth]]’s capacity to regenerate those resources that year. Earth Overshoot Day is calculated by dividing the world [[biocapacity]] (the amount of [[natural resource]]s generated by Earth that year), by the world [[ecological footprint]] (humanity's [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] of Earth’s natural resources for that year), and multiplying by 365, the number of days in one [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian common calendar]] year:

:&lt;math&gt;( \text{World Biocapacity} / \text{World Ecological Footprint} ) \times 365&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;\,= \text{Earth Overshoot Day}&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Earth_Overshoot_Day_graph.svg|thumb|250px|Progression of the dates of Earth Overshoot Day with equivalent number of Earths]]

When viewed through an [[economy|economic]] perspective, EOD represents the day in which humanity enters an ecological [[deficit spending]]. In [[ecology]] the term Earth Overshoot Day illustrates the level by which human population [[overshoot (population)|overshoots]] its environment. In 2018, Earth Overshoot Day is on August 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.overshootday.org/newsroom/past-earth-overshoot-days/|title=Past Earth Overshoot Days|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earth Overshoot Day is calculated by [[Global Footprint Network]] and is a campaign supported by dozens of other nonprofit organizations.&lt;ref name="EOD"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.overshootday.org/about-earth-overshoot-day/ |title=About Earth Overshoot Day |publisher=Global Footprint Network |accessdate=July 15, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Information about Global Footprint Network's calculations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.footprintnetwork.org/resources/data/ |title=Ecological Footprint: data and accounting methodology}}&lt;/ref&gt; and national Ecological Footprints&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://data.footprintnetwork.org|title= Biocapacity and Ecological Footprint: open data platform }}&lt;/ref&gt; are available online.

==Background==
[[File:Human welfare and ecological footprint sustainability.jpg|thumb|400px|right|The correlation between the development of a country using [[Human Development Index|HDI]] and its natural resource consumption&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.footprintnetwork.org/our-work/sustainable-development/  |title=Sustainable Development: Sustainable development is successful only when it improves citizens' well-being without degrading the environment. |publisher=Global Footprint Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Andrew Simms]] of UK [[think tank]] [[New Economics Foundation]] originally developed the concept of Earth Overshoot Day. [[Global Footprint Network]], a partner organization of New Economics Foundation, launches a campaign every year for Earth Overshoot Day to raise awareness of Earth’s limited resources. Global Footprint Network measures humanity’s demand for and supply of natural resources and ecological services. Global Footprint Network estimates that in less than eight months, we demand more [[renewable resource]]s and [[Carbon sequestration|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sequestration]] than what the planet can provide for an entire year.&lt;ref name=EOD /&gt;
 
Throughout most of history, humanity has used nature’s resources to build cities and roads, to provide food and create products, and to [[CO2 emissions|release carbon dioxide]] at a rate that was well within Earth’s budget. But by the early 1970s, that critical threshold had been crossed: Human consumption began outstripping what the planet could reproduce. According to [[Global Footprint Network]]’s calculations, our demand for renewable ecological resources and the services they provide is now equivalent to that of more than 1.5 Earths. The data shows us on track to require the resources of two planets well before mid-2000-century.

Advocates for Earth Overshoot Day note that the costs of [[Resource depletion|ecological overspending]] are becoming more evident over time. [[Climate change]] — a result of [[greenhouse gases]] being emitted faster than they can be absorbed by forests and oceans — is the most obvious result and widespread effects. Other cited effects include: [[deforestation|shrinking forests]], [[species loss]], fisheries collapse, higher commodity prices and [[civil unrest]].&lt;ref name="EOD" /&gt;

==Criticism==

The [[Breakthrough Institute]] regards the idea of Earth Overshoot Day and how many Earths we consume as "a nice publicity stunt".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pearce|first1=Fred|title=Admit it: we can't measure our ecological footprint|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22029445-000-admit-it-we-cant-measure-our-ecological-footprint/|website=New Scientist|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[United Nations]] data, forests and fisheries are, as a whole, regenerating faster than they are depleted (but admitting that "the surplus might be more a reflection of poor UN fisheries data than healthy fisheries"), while cropland and pasture use is equal to what is available.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Hence, Earth Overshoot Day does a poor job at measuring water and land mismanagement (e.g., [[soil erosion]]) and only highlights the excess of carbon dioxide that humanity releases above what the ecosystem can absorb. In other words, the additional equivalent number of Earths that humanity requires is equivalent to land area that, if filled with carbon sinks like forests, would balance carbon dioxide emissions.

Global Footprint Network points out that the ecological footprint makes apparent the gap between human demand and regeneration. Essentially, the sum of all demands competing for the planet's regeneration are now exceeding what the planet renews. While the accounting can be improved, and more details added, in its current applications to countries, the accounts typically underestimate human demand as not all aspects are measured (there are gaps in UN data). They also overestimate biocapacity because it is ambiguous to determine how much of current yields is enabled by reduced future yield (for instance as in the case of overuse of groundwater, or erosion). Therefore current accounts underplay the overall ecological deficit or overshoot at the global level. This is discussed in more detail in two chapters of the Routledge Handbook of Sustainability Indicators (Wackernagel et al. 2018 a and b).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wackernagel et al|first1=Mathis| title=Handbook of Sustainability Indicators -- Chapter 16 - Ecological Footprint: Principles &amp; Chapter 33 - Ecological Footprint: Criticisms and applications |url=https://www.routledgehandbooks.com|website=Routledge 2018|accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Therefore, ecological footprint accounts are metrics that merely define minimal conditions for sustainability. They do not cover all material aspects of sustainability, just a basic, minimal condition for living within the regenerative capacity of the planet’s ecosystems.

In response to the Breakthrough Institute Report, Mathis Wackernagel, founder and president of the Global Footprint Network, also points out that depletion of crop land, for instance, could be included in the Ecological Footprint accounts informing Earth Overshoot Day. But such improvements would "require data sets that do not exist within the UN data set". And such improvements would show an even larger global overshoot. Similarly, the apparent fishery surplus "might be more a reflection of poor UN fisheries data than healthy fisheries".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Endosymbiosis.PNG|thumb|200px|A representation of the [[endosymbiotic theory]]]]

An '''endosymbiont''' or '''endobiont'''&lt;ref name="KingDom"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Margulis |first1=Lynn |author1link=Lynn Margulis |last2=Chapman |first2=Michael J. |title=Kingdoms &amp; domains an illustrated guide to the phyla of life on Earth |date=2009 |publisher=Academic Press/Elsevier |location=Amsterdam |isbn=978-0-08-092014-6 |page=493 |edition=4th |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=9IWaqAOGyt4C&amp;pg=PA493 |accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is any [[organism]] that lives within the body or cells of another organism in a [[mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] (formerly called symbiotic) relationship with the host body or cell, often but not always [[mutualism (biology)|to mutual benefit]].
The term '''endosymbiosis''' is from the [[Greek language|Greek]]: ἔνδον ''endon'' "within", σύν ''syn'' "together" and βίωσις ''biosis'' "living"). Examples are [[nitrogen-fixing]] [[bacteria]] (called [[rhizobia]]), which live in [[root nodule]]s on [[legume]] roots, single-cell [[algae]] inside reef-building [[coral]]s, and bacterial endosymbionts that provide essential nutrients to about 10–15% of insects.

Many instances of endosymbiosis are obligate; that is, either the endosymbiont or the host cannot survive without the other, such as the [[Siboglinidae|gutless marine worms]] of the [[genus]] ''[[Riftia]]'', which get nutrition from their endosymbiotic bacteria. The most common examples of obligate endosymbioses are [[mitochondria]] and [[chloroplast]]s. Some human parasites, e.g. ''[[Wuchereria bancrofti]]'' and ''[[Mansonella perstans]]'', thrive in their intermediate insect hosts because of an obligate endosymbiosis with ''[[Wolbachia]] spp.'' They can both be eliminated from said hosts by treatments that target this bacterium. However, not all endosymbioses are obligate and some endosymbioses can be [[symbiosis|harmful]] to either of the organisms involved.

Two major types of [[organelle]] in [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic cells]], [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] and [[plastid]]s such as [[chloroplast]]s, originated by [[symbiogenesis]] as bacterial endosymbionts.

===In marine invertebrates===

Extracellular endosymbionts are also represented in all four extant classes of [[Echinodermata]] ([[Crinoidea]], [[Ophiuroidea]], [[Echinoidea]], and [[Holothuroidea]]). Little is known of the nature of the association (mode of infection, transmission, metabolic requirements, etc.) but [[phylogenetic]] analysis indicates that these symbionts belong to the alpha group of the class [[Proteobacteria]], relating them to ''Rhizobium'' and ''Thiobacillus''. Other studies indicate that these [[subcuticular bacteria]] may be both abundant within their hosts and widely distributed among the Echinoderms in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Burnett WJ, McKenzie JD |title=Subcuticular bacteria from the brittle star ''Ophiactis balli'' (Echinodermata: Ophiuroidea) represent a new lineage of extracellular marine symbionts in the alpha subdivision of the class Proteobacteria |journal=Appl.

Some marine [[oligochaeta]] (e.g., ''[[Olavius]]'' and ''[[Inanidrillus]]'') have obligate extracellular endosymbionts that fill the entire body of their host. These marine worms are nutritionally dependent on their symbiotic [[chemoautotroph]]ic bacteria lacking any digestive or excretory system (no gut, mouth, or [[nephridia]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dubilier, N.; Mülders, C.; Ferdelman, T. |title=Endosymbiotic sulphate-reducing and sulphide-oxidizing bacteria in an oligochaete worm |journal=Nature |volume=411 |issue=6835 |pages=298–302 |date=May 2001 |pmid=11357130 |doi=10.1038/35077067 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In protists===

''[[Mixotricha paradoxa]]'' is a protozoan that lacks mitochondria. However, spherical bacteria live inside the cell and serve the function of the mitochondria. ''Mixotricha'' also has three other species of symbionts that live on the surface of the cell.

''[[Paramecium bursaria]]'', a species of [[ciliate]], has a mutualistic symbiotic relationship with green alga called Zoochlorella. The algae live inside the cell, in the cytoplasm.

''[[Paulinella|Paulinella chromatophora]]'' is a freshwater [[amoeboid]] which has recently (evolutionarily speaking) taken on a [[cyanobacterium]] as an endosymbiont.

=== In insects ===

Scientists classify insect endosymbionts in two broad categories, 'Primary' and 'Secondary'. Primary endosymbionts (sometimes referred to as P-endosymbionts) have been associated with their [[insect]] hosts for many millions of years (from 10 to several hundred million years in some cases). They form obligate associations (see below), and display cospeciation with their insect hosts. Secondary endosymbionts exhibit a more recently developed association, are sometimes horizontally transferred between hosts, live in the [[hemolymph]] of the insects (not specialized bacteriocytes, see below), and are not obligate.&lt;ref&gt;P. Baumann, N. A. Moran and L. Baumann, Bacteriocyte-associated endosymbionts of insects in M. Dworkin, ed., ''The prokaryotes'', Springer, New York, 2000. http://link.springer.de/link/service/books/10125/&lt;/ref&gt;

Among primary endosymbionts of insects, the best-studied are the pea [[aphid]] (''[[Acyrthosiphon pisum]]'') and its endosymbiont ''[[Buchnera (proteobacteria)|Buchnera]] sp.'' APS,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Douglas |first=A E |title=Nutritional interactions in insect-microbial symbioses: Aphids and their symbiotic bacteria Buchnera |journal=Annual Review of Entomology |volume=43 |pages=17–38 |year=1998 |issn=0066-4170 |pmid=15012383 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ento.43.1.17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Douglas AE |title=Nutritional interactions in insect-microbial symbioses: Aphids and Their Symbiotic Bacteria ''Buchnera'' |journal=Annual Review of Entomology |volume=43 |pages=17–37 |date=January 1998 |pmid=15012383 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ento.43.1.17 |url=http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.ento.43.1.17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shigenobu S, Watanabe H, Hattori M, Sakaki Y, Ishikawa H |title=Genome sequence of the endocellular bacterial symbiont of aphids Buchnera sp. APS |journal=Nature |volume=407 |issue=6800 |pages=81–6 |date=September 2000 |pmid=10993077 |doi=10.1038/35024074 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[tsetse fly]] ''Glossina morsitans morsitans'' and its endosymbiont ''[[Wigglesworthia glossinidia brevipalpis]]'' and the endosymbiotic [[protists]] in lower [[termite]]s. As with endosymbiosis in other insects, the symbiosis is obligate in that neither the bacteria nor the insect is viable without the other. Scientists have been unable to cultivate the bacteria in lab conditions outside of the insect. With special nutritionally-enhanced diets, the insects can survive, but are unhealthy, and at best survive only a few generations.

In some insect groups, these endosymbionts live in specialized insect cells called [[bacteriocyte]]s (also called ''mycetocytes''), and are maternally-transmitted, i.e. the mother transmits her endosymbionts to her offspring. In some cases, the bacteria are transmitted in the [[Egg (biology)|egg]], as in ''Buchnera''; in others like ''Wigglesworthia'', they are transmitted via milk to the developing insect embryo. In termites, the endosymbionts reside within the hindguts and are transmitted through [[trophallaxis]] among colony members.

The primary endosymbionts are thought to help the host either by providing nutrients that the host cannot obtain itself or by metabolizing insect waste products into safer forms. For example, the putative primary role of ''Buchnera'' is to synthesize [[essential amino acid]]s that the aphid cannot acquire from its natural diet of plant sap. Likewise, the primary role of ''Wigglesworthia'', it is presumed, is to synthesize [[vitamin]]s that the tsetse fly does not get from the [[blood]] that it eats. In lower termites, the endosymbiotic protists play a major role in the digestion of lignocellulosic materials that constitute a bulk of the termites' diet.

Bacteria benefit from the reduced exposure to [[predator]]s and competition from other bacterial species, the ample supply of nutrients and relative environmental stability inside the host.

Genome sequencing reveals that obligate bacterial endosymbionts of insects have among the smallest of known bacterial genomes and have [[genome reduction|lost many genes]] that are commonly found in closely related bacteria. Several theories have been put forth to explain the loss of genes. It is presumed that some of these genes are not needed in the environment of the host insect cell. A complementary theory suggests that the relatively small numbers of bacteria inside each insect decrease the efficiency of natural selection in 'purging' deleterious mutations and small mutations from the population, resulting in a loss of genes over many millions of years. Research in which a parallel [[phylogeny]] of bacteria and insects was inferred supports the belief that the primary endosymbionts are transferred only vertically (i.e., from the mother), and not horizontally (i.e., by escaping the host and entering a new host).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wernegreen JJ |title=Primer – Endosymbiosis: Lessons in Conflict Resolution |journal=PLoS Biol |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=e68 |year=2004 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020068 |url=http://www.plosbiology.org/plosonline/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020068 |pmid=15024418 |pmc=368163 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040414043954/http://www.plosbiology.org/plosonline/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.0020068 |archivedate=14 April 2004 |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wernegreen JJ |title=Genome evolution in bacterial endosymbionts of insects |journal=Nat.

Attacking obligate bacterial endosymbionts may present a way to control their insect hosts, many of which pests or carriers of human disease. For example, aphids are crop pests and the tsetse fly carries the organism ''[[Trypanosoma brucei]]'' that causes African [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Aksoy S, Maudlin I, Dale C, Robinson AS, O'Neill SL |title=Prospects for control of African trypanosomiasis by tsetse vector manipulation |journal=Trends Parasitol. |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=29–35 |date=January 2001 |pmid=11137738 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1471-4922(00)01850-X |doi=10.1016/S1471-4922(00)01850-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other motivations for their study is to understand symbiosis, and to understand how bacteria with severely depleted genomes are able to survive, thus improving our knowledge of [[genetics]] and [[molecular biology]].

Less is known about secondary endosymbionts. The pea aphid (''[[Acyrthosiphon pisum]]'') is known to contain at least three secondary endosymbionts, ''[[Hamiltonella defensa]]'', ''[[Regiella insecticola]]'', and ''[[Serratia symbiotica]]''. ''H. defensa'' aids in defending the insect from parasitoids. ''[[Sodalis glossinidius]]'' is a secondary endosymbiont of tsetse flies that lives inter- and intracellularly in various host tissues, including the midgut and hemolymph. Phylogenetic studies have not indicated a correlation between evolution of ''[[Sodalis]]'' and tsetse.&lt;ref&gt;Aksoy, S., Pourhosseini, A. &amp; Chow, A. 1995.

== Dinoflagellate endosymbionts ==

[[Dinoflagellate]] endosymbionts of the genus ''Symbiodinium'', commonly known as [[zooxanthella]]e, are found in [[corals]], [[mollusk]]s (esp. [[giant clam]]s, the ''Tridacna''), [[sea sponge|sponges]], and [[foraminifera]]. These endosymbionts drive the formation of [[coral reefs]] by capturing sunlight and providing their hosts with energy for [[carbonate]] deposition.&lt;ref name=Baker2003&gt;{{cite journal |author=Baker AC |title=FLEXIBILITY AND SPECIFICITY IN CORAL-ALGAL SYMBIOSIS: Diversity, Ecology, and Biogeography of Symbiodinium |journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics |volume=34 |pages=661–89 |date=November 2003 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.34.011802.132417 |url=http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146%2Fannurev.ecolsys.34.011802.132417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously thought to be a single species, molecular [[phylogenetic]] evidence over the past couple decades has shown there to be great diversity in ''Symbiodinium''. In some cases, there is specificity between host and ''Symbiodinium'' [[clade]]. More often, however, there is an ecological distribution of ''Symbiodinium'', the symbionts switching between hosts with apparent ease. When reefs become environmentally stressed, this distribution of symbionts is related to the observed pattern of [[coral bleaching]] and recovery. Thus, the distribution of ''Symbiodinium'' on coral reefs and its role in coral bleaching presents one of the most complex and interesting current problems in reef [[ecology]].&lt;ref name=Baker2003/&gt;

== Symbiogenesis and organelles ==
{{Main|Symbiogenesis}}

Symbiogenesis explains the origins of [[eukaryote]]s, whose cells contain two major kinds of [[organelle]], [[mitochondria]] and [[chloroplast]]s. The theory proposes that these organelles evolved from certain types of bacteria that eukaryotic cells engulfed through [[cytosis|endophagocytosis]]. These cells and the bacteria trapped inside them entered an endosymbiotic relationship, meaning that the bacteria lived within the eukaryotic cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sagan, Lynn |authorlink=Lynn Margulis |year=1967 |title=On the origin of mitosing cells |journal=[[J Theor Biol]] |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=255–274 |pmid=11541392 |doi=10.1016/0022-5193(67)90079-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33202">In [[ecology]], '''extinction debt''' is the future [[extinction]] of [[species]] due to events in the past. The phrases '''dead clade walking''' and '''survival without recovery''' express the same idea.&lt;ref name=Jablonski2001/&gt;

Extinction debt occurs because of time delays between impacts on a species, such as destruction of [[habitat]], and the species' ultimate disappearance. For instance, long-lived [[trees]] may survive for many years even after reproduction of new trees has become impossible, and thus they may be committed to extinction.  Technically, extinction debt generally refers to the ''number of species'' in an area likely to become extinct, rather than the prospects of any one species, but [[colloquially]] it refers to any occurrence of delayed extinction.

Extinction debt may be local or global, but most examples are local as these are easier to observe and model. It is most likely to be found in long-lived species and species with very specific habitat requirements (specialists).&lt;ref name=Kuussaari2009/&gt; Extinction debt has important implications for conservation, as it implies that species may become extinct due to past habitat destruction, even if continued impacts cease, and that current reserves may not be sufficient to maintain the species that occupy them. Interventions such as habitat restoration may reverse extinction debt.

''Immigration credit'' is the corollary to extinction debt. It refers to the number of species likely to immigrate to an area after an event such as the [[Ecosystem restoration|restoration of an ecosystem]].&lt;ref name=Jackson2010&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jackson | first1 = S.

==Terminology==
The term ''extinction debt'' was first used in 1994 in a paper by [[David Tilman]], [[Robert May, Baron May of Oxford|Robert May]], [[Clarence Lehman]] and [[Martin Nowak]],&lt;ref name=Tilman1994&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Tilman | first1 = D. | last2 = May | first2 = R.

Extinction debt is also known by the terms ''dead clade walking'' and ''survival without recovery''&lt;ref name=Jablonski2001/&gt; when referring to the species affected. The phrase "dead clade walking" was coined by [[David Jablonski]] as early as 2001&lt;ref name=Jablonski2001&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jablonski |first1=David |title=Lessons from the past: Evolutionary impacts of mass extinctions |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |date=2001 |volume=98 |issue=10 |pages=5393–5398 |doi=10.1073/pnas.101092598 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/98/10/5393.full/ |pmid=11344284 |pmc=33224}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a reference to ''[[Dead Man Walking (film)|Dead Man Walking]]'',&lt;ref name="Jablonski2002"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jablonski | first1 = D | year = 2002 | title = Survival without recovery after mass extinctions | url = http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/99/12/8139 | journal = [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|PNAS]] | volume = 99 | issue = 12| pages = 8139–8144 | doi=10.1073/pnas.102163299 | pmid=12060760 | pmc=123034}}&lt;/ref&gt; a film whose title is based on American [[prison slang]] for a condemned prisoner's last walk to the execution chamber. "Dead clade walking" has since appeared in other scientists' writings about the aftermaths of mass extinctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Popular phrases like ‘Lazarus taxon’, ‘Elvis taxon’, and ‘dead clade walking’ were first coined for gastropods ...": {{cite journal |date=September 2005 |title=Recovery of gastropods in the Early Triassic |author=Nützel, A. |journal=Comptes Rendus Palevol |volume=4 |pages=501–515 |doi=10.1016/j.crpv.2005.02.007 |issue=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In discussions of [[Conservation biology#Threats to biodiversity|threats to biodiversity]], extinction debt is analogous to the "[[climate commitment]]" in [[climate change]], which states that [[inertia]] will cause the earth to continue to warm for centuries even if no more [[greenhouse gasses]] are emitted. Similarly, the [[Holocene extinction|current extinction]] may continue long after [[Human impacts on the environment|human impacts]] on species halt.

== Causes ==
Jablonski recognized at least four patterns in the fossil record following mass extinctions:&lt;ref name=Jablonski2001/&gt;
;(1) survival without recovery: also called “''dead clade walking''” – a group dwindling to extinction or relegation to precarious, minor ecological niches
;(2) continuity with setbacks: patterns disturbed by the extinction event but soon continuing on the previous trajectory
;(3) unbroken continuity: large-scale patterns continuing with little disruption
;(4) unbridled diversification: an increase in diversity and species richness, as in the mammals following the [[end-Cretaceous extinction event]]

Extinction debt is caused by many of the same drivers as [[extinction]]. The most well-known drivers of extinction debt are [[habitat fragmentation]] and [[habitat destruction]].&lt;ref name=Kuussaari2009&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kuussaari | first1 = M. | last2 = Bommarco | first2 = R. | last3 = Heikkinen | first3 = R.

Under [[:wikt:equilibrium|equilibrium]] conditions, species may become extinct in one [[Landscape ecology#Patch and mosaic|habitat patch]], yet continues to survive because it can [[Biological dispersal|disperse]] to other patches. However, as other patches have been destroyed or rendered inaccessible due to fragmentation, this "insurance" effect is reduced and the species may ultimately become extinct.

[[Pollution]] may also cause extinction debt by reducing a species' [[birth rate]] or increasing its [[death rate]] so that its population slowly declines.&lt;ref name=Loehle1996 /&gt; Extinction debts may be caused by [[invasive species]]&lt;ref name=Sax2008&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sax | first1 = D.

Extinction debt may also occur due to the loss of [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualist]] species. In New Zealand, the local extinction of several species of pollinating birds in 1870 has caused a long-term reduction in the reproduction of the shrub species ''[[Rhabdothamnus solandri]]'', which requires these birds to produce seeds. However, as the plant is slow-growing and long-lived, its populations persist.&lt;ref name=Anderson2010&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Anderson | first1 = S.

Jablonski found that the extinction rate of marine [[invertebrate]]s was significantly higher in the [[Geologic timescale|stage]] (major subdivision of an [[Geologic timescale|epoch]] &amp;ndash; typically 2&amp;ndash;10&amp;nbsp;million years' duration) following a mass extinction than in the stages preceding the mass extinction. His analysis focused on marine [[Mollusca|mollusc]]s since they constitute the most abundant group of fossils and are therefore the least likely to produce [[sampling error]]s. Jablonski suggested that two possible explanations deserved further study:
* Post-extinction physical environments differed from pre-extinction environments in ways which were disadvantageous to the "dead clades walking".
* [[Ecosystem]]s that developed after recoveries from mass extinctions may have been less favorable for the "dead clades walking".&lt;ref name="Jablonski2002" /&gt;

== Time scale ==
The time to "payoff" of extinction debt can be very long. Islands that lost habitat at the end of the last [[ice age]] 10,000&amp;nbsp;years ago still appear to be losing species as a result.&lt;ref name=Diamond1972 /&gt; It has been shown that some [[bryozoa]]ns, a type of microscopic marine organism, became extinct due to the [[volcano|volcanic]] rise of the [[Isthmus of Panama]]. This event cut off the flow of nutrients from the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the [[Caribbean]] 3–4.5&amp;nbsp;million years ago. While bryozoan populations dropped severely at this time, extinction of these species took another 1–2&amp;nbsp;million years.&lt;ref name=Jackson2009&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = O'Dea | first1 = A. | last2 = Jackson | first2 = J. | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2009.0844 | title = Environmental change drove macroevolution in cupuladriid bryozoans | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 276 | issue = 1673 | pages = 3629–34 | year = 2009 | pmid =  19640882| pmc = 2817302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extinction debts incurred due to human actions have shorter timescales. Local extinction of birds from rainforest fragmentation occurs over years or decades,&lt;ref name=Gonzalez2000 /&gt; while plants in fragmented grasslands show debts lasting 50–100&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name=Lindborg2004/&gt; Tree species in fragmented temperate forests have debts lasting 200 years or more.&lt;ref name=Vellend2006 /&gt;

== Theoretical development ==
===Origins in metapopulation models===
Tilman et al. demonstrated that extinction debt could occur using a mathematical [[ecosystem model]]  of species [[metapopulations]]. [[Metapopulations]] are multiple populations of a species that live in separate [[Landscape ecology#Patch and mosaic|habitat patches]] or islands but interact via immigration between the patches.  In this model, species persist via a balance between random local extinctions in patches and [[Colonisation (biology)|colonization]] of new patches.  Tilman ''et al.'' used this model to predict that species would persist long after they no longer had sufficient habitat to support them. When used to estimate extinction debts of tropical tree species, the model predicted debts lasting 50–400&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name=Tilman1994 /&gt;

One of the assumptions underlying the original extinction debt model was a trade-off between species' [[Competition (biology)|competitive]] ability and colonization ability. That is, a species that competes well against other species, and is more likely to become dominant in an area, is less likely to colonize new habitats due to evolutionary trade-offs. One of the implications of this assumption is that better competitors, which may even be more common than other species, are more likely to become extinct than rarer, less competitive, better dispersing species.  This has been one of the more controversial components of the model, as there is little evidence for this trade-off in many ecosystems, and in many empirical studies dominant competitors were least likely species to become extinct.&lt;ref name=McCarthy1997&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = McCarthy | first1 = M. A. | last2 = Lindenmayer | first2 = D.

E. | title = Do Imperfect Trade-Offs Affect the Extinction Debt Phenomenon? | journal = [[Ecology (journal)|Ecology]] | volume = 78 | issue = 5 | pages = 1597–1601| year = 1997 | doi = 10.1890/0012-9658(1997)078[1597:DITOAT]2.0.CO;2 | issn = 0012-9658}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development in other models===
Further theoretical work has shown that extinction debt can occur under many different circumstances, driven by different mechanisms and under different model assumptions. The original model predicted extinction debt as a result of habitat destruction in a system of small, isolated habitats such as islands. Later models showed that extinction debt could occur in systems where habitat destruction occurs in small areas within a large area of habitat, as in [[slash-and-burn]] agriculture in forests, and could also occur due to decreased growth of species from pollutants.&lt;ref name=Loehle1996&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Loehle | first1 = C. | last2 = Li | first2 = B. L. | title = Habitat Destruction and the Extinction Debt Revisited | doi = 10.2307/2269483 | journal = Ecological Applications | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 784–789 | year = 1996 | pmid =  | pmc = | jstor = 2269483 | url = https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc667129/ | format = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; Predicted patterns of extinction debt differ between models, though. For instance, habitat destruction resembling slash-and-burn agriculture is thought to affect rare species rather than poor colonizers. Models that incorporate [[Stochastic process|stochasticity]], or random fluctuation in populations, show extinction debt occurring over different time scales than classic models.&lt;ref name=Etienne2002&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Etienne | first1 = R. | last2 = Nagelkerke | first2 = C. | title = Non-equilibria in Small Metapopulations: Comparing the Deterministic Levins Model with its Stochastic Counterpart | doi = 10.1006/jtbi.2002.3135 | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 219 | issue = 4 | pages = 463–78 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12425979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most recently, extinction debts have been estimated through the use models derived from [[Unified neutral theory of biodiversity|neutral theory]]. Neutral theory has very different assumptions than the metapopulation models described above. It predicts that the abundance and distribution of species can be predicted entirely through random processes, without considering the traits of individual species. As extinction debt arises in models under such different assumptions, it is robust to different kinds of models. Models derived from neutral theory have successfully predicted extinction times for a number of bird species, but perform poorly at both very small and very large spatial scales.&lt;ref name=Halley2011&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Halley | first1 = J. M. | last2 = Iwasa | first2 = Y. | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1011217108 | title = Neutral theory as a predictor of avifaunal extinctions after habitat loss | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 108 | issue = 6 | pages = 2316–21 | year = 2011 | pmid =  21262797| pmc = 3038702|bibcode = 2011PNAS..108.2316H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mathematical model]]s have also shown that extinction debt will last longer if it occurs in response to large habitat impacts (as the system will move farther from equilibrium), and if species are long-lived. Also, species just below their [[extinction threshold]], that is, just below the population level or habitat occupancy levels required sustain their population, will have long-term extinction debts. Finally, extinction debts are predicted to last longer in landscapes with a few large patches of habitat, rather than many small ones.&lt;ref name=Hanski2002 /&gt;

== Detection ==
Extinction debt is difficult to detect and measure. Processes that drive extinction debt are inherently slow and highly variable (noisy), and it is difficult to locate or count the very small populations of near-extinct species. Because of these issues, most measures of extinction debt have a great deal of uncertainty.&lt;ref name=Kuussaari2009/&gt;

===Experimental evidence===
Due to the logistical and ethical difficulties of inciting extinction debt, there are few studies of extinction debt in controlled experiments. However, experiments [[Microcosm: Model / experimental ecosystem|microcosms]] of [[insects]] living on moss habitats demonstrated that extinction debt occurs after habitat destruction. In these experiments, it took 6–12&amp;nbsp;months for species to die out following the destruction of habitat.&lt;ref name=Gonzalez2000&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gonzalez | first1 = A. | doi = 10.1046/j.1461-0248.2000.00171.x | title = Community relaxation in fragmented landscapes: the relation between species richness, area and age | journal = Ecology Letters | volume = 3 | issue = 5 | pages = 441–448 | year = 2000 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Observational methods===
====Long-term observation====
Extinction debts that reach equilibrium in relatively short time scales (years to decades) can be observed via measuring the change in species numbers in the time following an impact on habitat. For instance, in the [[Amazon rainforest]], researchers have measured the rate at which bird species disappear after forest is cut down.&lt;ref name=Stouffer2009&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Stouffer | first1 = P.

====Comparing the past and present====
Most studies of extinction debt compare species numbers with habitat patterns from the past and habitat patterns in the present. If the present populations of species are more closely related to past habitat patterns than present, extinction debt is a likely explanation. The magnitude of extinction debt (i.e., number of species likely to become extinct) can not be estimated by this method.&lt;ref name=Kuussaari2009 /&gt;

If one has information on species populations from the past in addition to the present, the magnitude of extinction debt can be estimated. One can use the relationship between species and habitat from the past to predict the number of species expected in the present. The difference between this estimate and the actual number of species is the extinction debt.&lt;ref name=Kuussaari2009 /&gt;

This method requires the assumption that in the past species and their habitat were in equilibrium, which is often unknown.   Also, a common relationship used to equate habitat and species number is the [[species-area curve]], but as the species-area curve arises from very different mechanisms than those in [[metapopulation]] based models, extinction debts measured in this way may not conform with metapopulation models' predictions.&lt;ref name=Loehle1996 /&gt; The relationship between habitat and species number can also be represented by much more complex models that simulate the behavior of many species independently.&lt;ref name=Vellend2006&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Vellend | first1 = M. | last2 = Verheyen | first2 = K. | last3 = Jacquemyn | first3 = H. | last4 = Kolb | first4 = A. | last5 = Van Calster | first5 = H. | last6 = Peterken | first6 = G. | last7 = Hermy | first7 = M. | doi = 10.1890/05-1182 | title = Extinction Debt of Forest Plants Persists for More Than a Century Following Habitat Fragmentation | journal = Ecology | volume = 87 | issue = 3 | pages = 542–8 | year = 2006 | pmid =  
16602283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Comparing impacted and pristine habitats====
If data on past species numbers or habitat are not available, species debt can also be estimated by comparing two different habitats: one which is mostly intact, and another which has had areas cleared and is smaller and more fragmented.  One can then measure the relationship of species with the condition of habitat in the intact habitat, and, assuming this represents equilibrium, use it to predict the number of species in the cleared habitat.  If this prediction is lower than the actual number of species in the cleared habitat, then the difference represents extinction debt.&lt;ref name=Kuussaari2009 /&gt;  This method requires many of the same assumptions as methods comparing the past and present.

=== Examples ===

==== Grasslands ====
Studies of European grasslands show evidence of extinction debt through both comparisons with the past and between present-day systems with different levels of human impacts. The species diversity of [[grasslands]] in [[Sweden]] appears to be a remnant of more connected landscapes present 50 to 100&amp;nbsp;years ago.&lt;ref name=Lindborg2004&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lindborg | first1 = R. | last2 = Eriksson | first2 = O. | doi = 10.1890/04-0367 | title = Historical Landscape Connectivity Affects Present Plant Species Diversity | journal = Ecology | volume = 85 | issue = 7 | pages = 1840 | year = 2004 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Alvar|alvar grasslands]] in [[Estonia]] that have lost area since the 1930s, 17–70% of species are estimated to be committed to extinction.&lt;ref name=Helm2006&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Helm | first1 = A. | last2 = Hanski | first2 = I. | last3 = Partel | first3 = M. | title = Slow response of plant species richness to habitat loss and fragmentation | doi = 10.1111/j.1461-0248.2005.00841.x | journal = Ecology Letters | volume = 0 | issue = 1 | pages = 72–7 | year = 2005 | pmid =  16958870| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, studies of similar grasslands in [[Belgium]], where similar impacts have occurred, show no evidence of extinction debt.&lt;ref name=Adriaens2006&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Adriaens | first1 = D. | last2 = Honnay | first2 = O. | last3 = Hermy | first3 = M. | title = No evidence of a plant extinction debt in highly fragmented calcareous grasslands in Belgium | doi = 10.1016/j.biocon.2006.06.006 | journal = Biological Conservation | volume = 133 | issue = 2 | pages = 212 | year = 2006 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This may be due to differences in the scale of measurement or the level of specialization of grass species.&lt;ref name=Cousins2010&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.biocon.2010.11.009 | last1 = Cousins | first1 = S.

==== Forests ====
Forests in [[Vlaams-Brabant]], Belgium, show evidence of extinction debt remaining from [[deforestation]] that occurred between 1775 and 1900. Detailed modeling of species behavior, based on similar forests in [[England]] that did not experience deforestation, showed that long-lived and slow-growing species were more common than equilibrium models would predict, indicating that their presence was due to lingering extinction debt.&lt;ref name=Vellend2006/&gt;

In Sweden, some species of [[lichens]] show an extinction debt in fragments of ancient forest. However, species of lichens that are habitat [[Generalist and specialist species|generalists, rather than specialists]], do not.&lt;ref name=Berglund2005&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Berglund | first1 = H. | last2 = Jonsson | first2 = B.

==== Insects ====
Extinction debt has been found among species of [[butterflies]] living in the grasslands on [[Saaremaa]] and [[Muhu]] – islands off the western coast of Estonia. Butterfly species distributions on these islands are better explained by the habitat in the past than current habitats.&lt;ref name=Sang2010&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sang | first1 = A. | last2 = Teder | first2 = T. | last3 = Helm | first3 = A. | last4 = Pärtel | first4 = M. | title = Indirect evidence for an extinction debt of grassland butterflies half century after habitat loss | doi = 10.1016/j.biocon.2010.03.015 | journal = Biological Conservation | volume = 143 | issue = 6 | pages = 1405 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the islands of the [[Azores]] [[Archipelago]], more than 95% of native forests have been destroyed in the past 600&amp;nbsp;years. As a result, more than half of [[arthropods]] on these islands are believed to be committed to extinction, with many islands likely to lose more than 90% of species.&lt;ref name=Kostas2010&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Triantis | first1 = K.

==== Vertebrates ====
80–90% of extinction from past [[deforestation of the Amazon rainforest|deforestation in the Amazon]] has yet to occur, based on modeling based on species-area relationships. Local extinctions of approximately 6&amp;nbsp;species are expected in each 2500&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; region by 2050 due to past deforestation.&lt;ref name=Wearn2012&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wearn | first1 = O.

The extinction rate slowed, however, as forest regrew in the spaces in between habitat fragments.&lt;ref name="Stouffer2009"/&gt;

Countries in [[Africa]] are estimated to have, on average, a local extinction debt of 30% for forest-dwelling [[primates]].  That is, they are expected to have 30% of their forest primate species to become extinct in the future due to loss of forest [[habitat]]. The time scale for these extinctions has not been estimated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cowlishaw | first1 = G. | doi = 10.1046/j.1523-1739.1999.98433.x | title = Predicting the Pattern of Decline of African Primate Diversity: an Extinction Debt from Historical Deforestation | journal = [[Conservation Biology (journal)|Conservation Biology]] | volume = 13 | issue = 5 | pages = 1183–1193 | year = 1999 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on historical species-area relationships, [[Hungary]] currently has approximately nine more species of [[Bird of prey|raptors]] than are thought to be able to be supported by current nature reserves.&lt;ref name=Baldi2006&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Baldi | first1 = A. | last2 = Voros | first2 = J. | doi = 10.1016/j.baae.2005.09.005 | title = Extinction debt of Hungarian reserves: A historical perspective | journal = Basic and Applied Ecology | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = 289 | year = 2006 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications to conservation==
The existence of extinction debt in many different ecosystems has important implications for [[conservation biology|conservation]].   It implies that in the absence of further habitat destruction or other environmental impacts, many species are still likely to become extinct. Protection of existing [[habitats]] may not be sufficient to protect species from extinction.&lt;ref name=Baldi2006/&gt; However, the long time scales of extinction debt may allow for habitat [[restoration ecology|restoration]] in order to prevent extinction,&lt;ref name=Kuussaari2009 /&gt; as occurred in the slowing of extinction in Amazon forest birds above.&lt;ref name=Stouffer2009 /&gt; In another example, it has been found that [[grizzly bears]] in very small reserves in the [[Rocky Mountains]] are likely to become extinct, but this finding allows the modification of reserve networks to better support their populations.&lt;ref name=Carroll2004&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Carroll | first1 = C. | last2 = Noss | first2 = R. F. | last3 = Paquet | first3 = P. C. | last4 = Schumaker | first4 = N.

The extinction debt concept may require revision of the value of land for species conservation, as the number of species currently present in a habitat may not be a good measure of the habitat's ability to support species (see [[carrying capacity]]) in the future.&lt;ref name=Berglund2005 /&gt; As extinction debt may last longest near extinction thresholds, it may be hardest to detect the threat of extinction for species that conservation could benefit the most.&lt;ref name=Hanski2002&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hanski | first1 = I. | last2 = Ovaskainen | first2 = O. | doi = 10.1046/j.1523-1739.2002.00342.x | title = Extinction Debt at Extinction Threshold | journal = Conservation Biology | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 666 | year = 2002 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic analyses have shown that including extinction in management decision-making process changes decision outcomes, as the decision to destroy habitat changes conservation value in the future as well as the present. It is estimated that in [[Costa Rica]], ongoing extinction debt may cost between $88 million and $467 million.&lt;ref name=Leroux2009&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Leroux | first1 = A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2796">In [[radio engineering]], a '''frequency offset''' is an intentional slight [[frequency shift (disambiguation)|shift]] of broadcast [[radio frequency]] (RF), to reduce [[RF interference|interference]] with other transmitters.

== Interference ==
The most important problem encountered in broadcasting via terrestrial transmitters is the interference from other broadcasters. In principle, each broadcaster has a different radio frequency (planned by the public authority) in a common reception area to avoid interference from each other. However still there are two problems: spurious radiation of adjacent channels and fringe reception. 

[[TV and FM DX|Fringe reception]] is unintended reception under certain weather conditions.  The exceptionally long-range reception means that the receiver may be tuned to more than one transmitter (transmitting at same frequency) at the same time.  These transmitters may transmit programs of different broadcasters as well as the programs of the same broadcaster. In analogue transmission, even the transmitters transmitting the very same program interfere each other because of phase differences of the incoming [[Signal (electronics)|signal]], but in [[Digital data|digital]] transmission the transmitters transmitting the same program in the same channel may reinforce each other.

== The shift in RF ==

In order to reduce the interference from the fringe area transmitters transmitting in the same channels, a method named frequency offset is often used. By this method, a slightly shifted RF is assigned for a transmitter which may be interfered by other transmitters.  

In TV transmission, the shifted RF is calculated by the formula;

:&lt;math&gt;f_{os} = f_{ch} + \frac{f_L\cdot p}{12}&lt;/math&gt;
where,  
:&lt;math&gt;f_{os} &lt;/math&gt; is the offset RF,
:&lt;math&gt; f_{ch}&lt;/math&gt; is the standard channel frequency, 
:&lt;math&gt;p &lt;/math&gt; is an integer such that &lt;math&gt;-12&lt;p&lt;12&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f_L &lt;/math&gt; is the line frequency. ( '''15625 Hz.''' for [[625-line]] systems, '''15750 Hz.''' for [[CCIR System M|System M]] and System J and '''20475 Hz.''' for [[Analog high-definition television system|system E]])

'''Precision offset''' is the same as frequency offset, except that in this case, the offset frequency is produced by a [[cesium]] controlled oscillator.

== Example ==

'''8p''' offset of channel '''9''' in system B can be found readily

The standard visual [[carrier frequency]] is '''203.25''' MHz The line frequency is '''15 625''' Hz.

:&lt;math&gt;f_{os} = 203 250 000 + \frac{15626\cdot 8}{12} \approx 203260417&lt;/math&gt;

'''8n''' offset of the same channel is likewise 

:&lt;math&gt;f_{os} = 203 250 000 - \frac{15626\cdot 8}{12} \approx 203239583&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5385">The '''G-less cassette''' transcription assay is a method used in [[molecular biology]] to determine [[Promoter (genetics)|promoter]] strength ''in vitro''. The technique involves quantification of an mRNA product with the use of a plasmid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Reverse Transcriptase-Coupled Quantitative Real Time PCR Analysis of Cell-Free Transcription on the Chromatin-Assembled p21 Promoter |date=2014-11-12 |pmc=3160311 | pmid=21886803 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0023617 |volume=6 |journal=PLOS ONE |pages=e23617 | last1 = Park | first1 = JH | last2 = Magan | first2 = N}}&lt;/ref&gt; The G-less cassette is part of a pre-constructed vector, usually containing a [[multiple cloning site]] (MCS) upstream of the cassette. For this reason, promoters of interest can be inserted directly into the MCS to ultimately measure the accuracy and efficiency of a promoter in recruiting transcription machinery.

[[File:Glesscassetteassay.png|thumb|'''A promoter is cloned into the &lt;br /&gt;G-less cassette plasmid.'''&lt;br /&gt;
'''(a)''' A pre-made plasmid with a 365-nt G-less sense strand is subjected to promoter insertion. '''(b)''' The promoter is cloned into the multiple cloning site (MCS) immediately upstream of the transcription start site. A polymerase is used transcribe the G-less cassette. Once the cassette has been transcribed and first guanosine triphosphate in the sense strand beyond the cassette is detected, transcription is prematurely terminated. A radiolabeled 365-nt transcript is released. The transcripts produced in a G-less cassette assay may be subjected to gel electrophoresis to confirm their length and autoradiography to determine relative promoter strength.]]

==Method==
The G-less cassette is a [[reporter gene]] that encodes a transcript lacking [[guanine]] nucleotides in the [[Sense (molecular biology)|sense]] strand of the DNA (hence "'''G'''-less").&lt;ref name="Baniahmad2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Aria Baniahmad|title=Thyroid Hormone Receptors: Methods and Protocols|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DDuqWMe_6xEC&amp;pg=PA211|year=2002|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-59259-174-9|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; A plasmid containing such a gene  is located downstream of a MCS. After the promoter is inserted into the MCS, [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] proceeds with the addition of radiolabeled UTP, CTP, and ATP (as well as non-radiolabeled/cold nucleotides) and continues until the end of the G-less cassette is reached and guanine residues are once again apparent in the sense strand of the DNA. The absence of GTP ''in vitro'' results in transcription being prematurely terminated at the first guanine residue in the sense strand following the cassette. [[Gel electrophoresis]] is performed on the transcription products and the amount of radioactivity is quantified by [[autoradiograph]]y or [[Phosphorimager|phosphorimaging]] to determine the strength of the promoter of interest.

==Application==
The G-less cassette technique is used to determine promoter strength beyond basal levels of transcription (i.e. in the presence of [[transcription activators]] or [[transcription factor]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Poly(A) signal-dependent degradation of unprocessed nascent transcripts accompanies poly(A) signal-dependent transcriptional pausing in vitro |date=2014-11-12 |pmc=2802029 | pmid=19926725 |doi=10.1261/rna.1622010 |volume=16 |journal=RNA |pages=197–210 | last1 = Kazerouninia | first1 = A | last2 = Ngo | first2 = B | last3 = Martinson | first3 = HG}}&lt;/ref&gt;). For example, to measure the effects of a [[TATA box]] [[consensus sequence]] modification in ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' in the presence of [[TFIID]], G-less cassettes were implemented to measure the relative strength of each promoter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Minimal components of the RNA polymerase II transcription apparatus determine the consensus TATA box |date=2014-11-12 |pmc=2396422 | pmid=18385157 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkn130 |volume=36 |journal=Nucleic Acids Res |pages=2906–16 | last1 = Bjornsdottir | first1 = G | last2 = Myers | first2 = LC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==
The G-less assay can be performed on a circular plasmid to measure levels of transcription. A circular plasmid provides a more efficient template in many systems when compared to other assays such as runoff transcription, in which a cleaved end is required. This method generates radiolabeled transcripts very efficiently because it bypasses the unnecessary process of performing other indirect mRNA product measurements. The promoter is inserted into a circular plasmid containing the G-less cassette, which will generate a transcript of a certain length that omits random and nonspecific transcription throughout the plasmid. Most crude systems, such as HeLa nuclear extracts, are used because they contain low amounts of contaminating GTP that lead to background transcription and may occasionally cause random transcription to read through the G-less cassette.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= G-less cassette in vitro transcription using HeLa cell nuclear extracts|date=2014-11-12 |pmid=20194456 | doi=10.1101/pdb.prot5387 |volume=2010 |journal=Cold Spring Harb Protoc |pages=pdb.prot5387 | last1 = Carey | first1 = MF | last2 = Peterson | first2 = CL | last3 = Smale | first3 = ST}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''{{lang|de|Gesellschaft der Freunde alter Musikinstrumente}}''' ('''GEFAM''') (''Society of friends of old [[musical instruments]]'') was founded in 1951 in [[Zurich]], Switzerland, by a number of music lovers and collectors of historical musical instruments. It is still the only society in the German speaking part of Europe (Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Lichtenstein) that is concerned mainly with old musical instruments. Thanks to its base in Switzerland it has a multicultural and multilanguage profile, visual in its international list of members. Today there are around 200 members (individuals and institutions), mainly in Europe, but also on other parts of the globe. The spectrum includes specialised museums and collections of old musical instruments, researchers and instrument makers as well as private collectors and enthusiasts.

The society is a forum in which public and private collections of musical instruments are visited and aspects of conservation&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nzz.ch/feuilleton/musik-und-artenschutz-im-clinch-1.18435496&lt;/ref&gt; are discussed, whereby the history of the musical instruments is given special consideration. Occasionally extra-European instruments are regarded as well. In addition to these aspects the society also contributes to discussions between [[museum]] "[[Expert|specialists]]"&lt;!-- what is being quoted here? --&gt;{{cn|date=August 2015}}, [[Musical instrument|instrument makers]], [[universities]] and [[Music school|conservatories]] on the one hand and [[Private collection|private collectors]] and others interested in old musical instruments on the other.

==Publications==

The society publishes the biannual bulletin ''[[Glareana]]'' ([http://www.gefam.ch/en/glareana_en/ eJournal])&lt;ref&gt;Imogen Fellinger, et al. "Periodicals." Grove Music Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 12 Aug. 2015. &lt;http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/21338pg41&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; with society news and articles on subjects pertaining to instruments. It has also published several [[monograph]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gefam.ch/en/publications/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2406">'''Independent reading''' is a term used in educational settings, where students are involved in choosing and reading material (fiction books, non-fiction, magazine, other media) for their independent consumption and enjoyment. Students that read independently have an emphasized creative choice in what they want to read and choose to learn.  Usually, '''Independent Reading''' takes place alongside the ongoing curriculum in the classroom or [[homeschool]].  Independent Reading can be tied to assessment and evaluation or remain as an activity in itself. 

==More Names for Independent Reading==
*SSR: Sustained Silent Reading
*DEAR: Drop Everything And Read
*Voluntary Reading 
&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.educationworld.com/a_curr/curr038.shtml] &lt;/ref&gt;

==Some of the Aims of Independent Reading==

'''Students will'''
*Read more willingly and more often.
*Become more interested in the printed word in general, including their own writing.
*Become more receptive to enrichment activities related to their reading.
*Discover that they can think and write in a meaningful way about their reading.
*Learn that literature can enrich their lives.
*Expand their vocabulary.
*Receive higher test scores.

==How to include Independent Reading into a Routine==

'''Teachers can'''
*Allot time each to independent, where the student will choose a book and read for that amount of time.
*Set a number of pages that students have to read by the end of a specific timeframe.
*Have a book report due where the student chooses and reads a book of their choice and explains it to the class.
'''Parents can:'''
*Set a certain amount of time that their child has to read.
*Have their children read them books of their choice.

The '''Indian Institute of Astrophysics''' (IIA), with its headquarters in [[Bangalore]] ([[Karnataka]] state), is a premier National Research Institute of [[India]]. IIA conducts research primarily in the areas of [[astronomy]], [[astrophysics]] and related subjects. It is widely recognised as a leading research center for Astrophysics in India.

The institute has a network of laboratories and observatories in India, including [[Kodaikanal]] (the [[Kodaikanal Solar Observatory]]), [[Kavalur]] (the [[Vainu Bappu Observatory]]), [[Gauribidanur]], [[Hanle (village)|Hanle]] (the [[Indian Astronomical Observatory]]) and [[Hosakote]].

IIA contributed to [[Astrosat]], India's first dedicated multi-wavelength space observatory. The Astrosat project is a collaborative effort of many different research institutions from India. 

==Areas of research==
Researchers at IIA work on a diverse set of topics related to Astronomy and Astrophysics. However, the research can be broadly classified under the following areas:
* Sun &amp; Solar system
* [[Stellar Astronomy]]
* [[Galactic Astronomy]]
* [[Extragalactic Astronomy]] &amp; [[Cosmology]]
* Theoretical Astrophysics &amp; Physics
* Techniques &amp; Instrumentation
* Space Astronomy

==History==
The origin of Indian studies in astronomy can be traced to a private observatory established by [[William Petrie]] (died: 1816), an officer of the [[British East India Company|East India Company]]. He set up that private observatory in his residence located in [[Egmore]], Chennai (formerly [[Madras]]), India. The main aim of the observatory, according to Petrie, was 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"to provide navigational assistance to the company ships and help determine the longitudes by observing the eclipses of Moon and satellites of Jupiter".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1790, this private observatory was taken over by the East India Company, with [[Michael Topping]] (1747–96) as an astronomer. In 1792, the observatory was expanded and shifted to a complex in [[Nungambakkam]] area of Chennai. This was the first modern observatory outside [[Europe]].

Presently, the Indian Institute of Astrophysics functions under the control of the Department of Science and Technology, [[Government of India]].


==Academics ==
The Institute awards three types of degrees.

* Ph.D.:
* Integrated M.Sc./Ph.D.
* Integrated M.Tech.-Ph.D.

'''Indian calligraphy''' is the [[Culture of India|Indian]] tradition of [[calligraphy]], or artistic writing. The art form has served multiple purposes since its inception in the second century BCE, including the duplication of religious texts and as a form of basic communication.

== History ==
===Early calligraphy (2nd century BCE-6th century CE)===
Beginning in the 2nd century AD, Indic language was transferred using [[Birch bark manuscript|birch bark]] as a writing surface. Locally, the birch bark was called Bhojpatra in [[India]] - patra meaning leaf/bark/sheet in [[Sanskrit]]. Palm leaves were used as a substitute to paper, even after paper was available for Indic manuscripts. The leaves were commonly used because they were a good surface for pen writing, which created the delicate and decorative handwriting that is known as calligraphy today. Both sides of these leaves were used and they were stacked on top of each other. People then created holes on the leaves and held them together by string, thus creating the early Indian manuscripts, common in Southeast Asia at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indic Calligraphy|last=Anderson|first=D.M.|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages (6th century-16th century)===
Indian calligraphy took off starting around 500 AD when Indian traders, colonists, military adventurers, [[Bhikku|Buddhist monks]] and missionaries brought the [[Indic script]] to Central Asia from [[South East Asia]]. Different concepts and ideas were being created throughout the late 400s to late 1400s, in a 1000-year span. The [[Gilgit]] scripts are the earliest notable form of calligraphy in India that date back to the 5th and 6th centuries. The earliest painted covers of manuscripts were created between the 7th and 9th centuries, and the earliest illustrated manuscript in South Asia was not formed until around the 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sacred Calligraphy of the East|last=Stevens|first=John|publisher=|year=1995|isbn=0877734585|location=Boston, Massachusetts|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Qutb Minar Minaret Delhi India.jpg|160px|thumb|Inscriptions in the [[Kufic]] style of [[calligraphy]] form regular bands throughout the [[Qutb Minar]], [[Delhi]], built 1192 CE]]

The languages of South East Asia were influenced by Indic language and culture. The languages that were created came in the form of the basic internal structure, the arrangement and construction of syllabic units, manner of representation of characters, and the direction of writing (left to right). Before this left to right reading, the technique of [[Palm-leaf manuscript|Pothi]] was utilized, which is the format of a book that is written vertically. This was useful for the illustrations made in these early manuscripts. [[Persian people|Persian]] influence in Indian calligraphy gave rise to a unique and influential blend in Indian calligraphy, although a number of different calligraphic traditions existed in India already, and Indic scripts were fundamentally different from scripts used in Arabic and Persian traditions. The notable achievements of the [[Mughal era|Mughals]] included some of their fine manuscripts, which were usually autobiographies and chronicles of the noble class. They were initially written in flowing [[Persian language|Persian]] script, which was one of the main forms of communication during this time, and which showed a multi-directionality and mutuality of influence on Indic calligraphers.

From the 16th century onwards [[Sikhism]] played a key role in the history of Indian calligraphy. Sikhs have traditionally handwritten their holy book, the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], and furnished it with illumination. [[Sikh]] calligrapher [[Pratap Singh Giani]] (1855–1920) is known for one of the first definitive translations of Sikh scriptures into [[English language|English]].[[Image:Asokan brahmi pillar edict.jpg|thumb|right|184x184px|A fragment of [[Pillars of Ashoka|Ashoka's 6th pillar edict]].]]

=== Modern Period (16th century-today) ===
There was a bigger goal to this style of language than just to communicate with one another. There was no one true form of [[communication]] before this was created, and calligraphy helped to guide community members to connect in more than one aspect of life, that was not just language. A rich heritage of calligraphy was embraced as this was a time before [[printing]] technology was accessible to Indian counties. This brought people closer together as they began to communicate in the same ways. While it may be used as an art form today, it was essential for communication before the 16th century.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

== Features of Indian calligraphy ==
[[Religious text]]s are the most frequent vehicle for calligraphy in India. [[Monastic]] Buddhist communities had members trained in calligraphy and shared responsibility for duplicating sacred scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indian Epigraphy: A Guide to the Study of Inscriptions in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and the Other Indo-Aryan Languages|last=Salomon|first=Richard|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0195099843|location=Oxford, New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jainism|Jaina]] traders incorporated illustrated manuscripts celebrating Jaina saints. These manuscripts were produced using inexpensive material, like palm leave and birch, with fine calligraphy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indian Art|last=Mitter|first=Partha|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001|isbn=|location=Oxford, New York|pages=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''institute of technology''' (also: '''university of technology''', '''polytechnic university''', '''technikon''' and '''technical university''') is a type of [[university]] which specializes in [[engineering]], [[technology]], [[applied science]] and sometimes [[natural science]]s.  

The English term '''polytechnic''' appeared in the early 19th century, from the French ''[[École Polytechnique]]'', an engineering school founded in 1794 in [[Paris]]. The [[French language|French]] term comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''πολύ'' (''polú'' or ''polý'') meaning "many" and ''τεχνικός'' (''tekhnikós'') meaning "arts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=polytechnic&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|work=etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Institutes of technology versus polytechnics==
The institutes of technology and polytechnics have been in existence since at least the 18th century, but became popular after [[World War II]] with the expansion of engineering and applied science education, associated with the new needs created by [[industrialization]]. The world's first institution of technology, the Berg-Schola (today its legal successor is the [[University of Miskolc]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.uni-miskolc.hu/uni/univ/booklet/MandU.html | title = Misckolc and the University | date = | publisher = Miskolci Egyetem (University of Miskolci) | access-date = 29 October 2017}}{{failed verification|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;), was founded by the Court Chamber of Vienna in [[Selmecbánya]], [[Kingdom of Hungary]] (now [[Banská Štiavnica]], [[Slovakia]]), in 1735 in order to train specialists of precious metal and copper mining according to the requirements of the industrial revolution in Hungary. The oldest German Institute of Technology is the [[Braunschweig University of Technology]], founded in 1745 as "Collegium Carolinum". Another exception is the ''[[École Polytechnique]]'', which has educated [[France|French]] ''élites'' since its foundation in 1794. In some cases, polytechnics or institutes of technology are engineering schools or technical colleges.

In several countries, like Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Turkey, institutes of technology and polytechnics are institutions of [[higher education]] and have been accredited to award academic degrees and doctorates. Famous examples are the [[Istanbul Technical University]], [[ETH Zurich]], [[İYTE]], [[Delft University of Technology]] and [[RWTH Aachen]], all considered universities.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

In countries like Iran, Finland, Malaysia, Portugal, Singapore or the United Kingdom, there is often a significant and confused distinction between polytechnics and universities. In the UK a binary system of higher education emerged consisting of universities (research orientation) and polytechnics (engineering and applied science and professional practice orientation).  Polytechnics offered university equivalent degrees mainly in [[Science, technology, engineering and mathematics|STEM]] subjects from [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor's]], [[master's]] and [[PhD]] that were validated and governed at the national level by the independent UK [[Council for National Academic Awards]]. In 1992 UK polytechnics were designated as universities which meant they could award their own degrees. The CNAA was disbanded. The UK's first polytechnic, the Royal Polytechnic Institution (now the [[University of Westminster]]), was founded in 1838 in Regent Street, London. In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] the term "institute of technology" is the more favored synonym of a "[[regional technical college]]" though the latter is the legally correct term; however, [[Dublin Institute of Technology]] is a university in all but name as it can confer degrees in accordance with law, [[Cork Institute of Technology]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.hetac.ie/docs/Cork%20IT-DA%20Evaluation%20Group%20Report.pdf | title = Report of the Delegated Authority Evaluation Group on the Cork Institute of Technology | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912200434/http://www.hetac.ie/docs/Cork%20IT-DA%20Evaluation%20Group%20Report.pdf | archive-date=September 12, 2008 | format = PDF | date = June 2005 | author = Evaluation Group for the Delegation of Authority to Make Awards | publisher = Higher Education and Training Awards Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other Institutes of Technology have delegated authority from HETAC to make awards to and including master's degree level — Level 9 of the Republic of Ireland's National Framework for Qualifications (NFQ) — for all areas of study and Doctorate level in a number of others.

In a number of countries, although being today generally considered similar institutions of higher learning across many countries, polytechnics and institutes of technology used to have a quite different statute among each other, its teaching competences and organizational history.  In many cases "polytechnic" were elite technological universities concentrating on applied science and engineering and may also be a former designation for a vocational institution, before it has been granted the exclusive right to award academic degrees and can be truly called an "institute of technology". A number of polytechnics providing higher education is simply a result of a formal upgrading from their original and historical role as intermediate technical education schools. In some situations, former polytechnics or other non-university institutions have emerged solely through an administrative change of statutes, which often included a name change with the introduction of new designations like "institute of technology", "polytechnic university", "[[university of applied sciences]]", or "university of technology" for marketing purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

This is mostly the case in those countries, where the education system is not controlled by the state and any institution can grant degrees.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Evidence have also shown a decline in the general quality of teaching and graduate's preparation for the workplace, due to the fast-paced conversion of that technical institutions to more advanced higher level institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.qualityresearchinternational.com/ese/relatedpubs/Producing%20new%20workers.pdf | title = Producing New Workers: quality, equality and employability in higher education | journal = Quality in Higher Education | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | date = 2001 | first = Louise | last = Morley | access-date = 15 June 2006 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060112084034/http://www.qualityresearchinternational.com/ese/relatedpubs/Producing%20new%20workers.pdf |archive-date=January 12, 2006 | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url = http://www.aair.org.au/jir/1998papers/bruwer.pdf | title = First destination graduate employment as key performance indicator: outcomes assessment perspectives | first = Johan | last = Bruwer | publisher = Unit for Institutional Planning and Research, Cape Technikon, South Africa | date = November 1998 | access-date = 15 June 2006 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821140056/http://www.aair.org.au/jir/1998papers/bruwer.pdf |archive-date=August 21, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mentz, Kotze and Van der Merwe argue that all the tools are in place to promote the debate on the place of technology in higher education in general and in universities of technology specifically and they posit several questions for the debate.&lt;ref name=Mentz-et-al&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mentz | first1 = J. | last2 = Kotzé | first2 = P. | last3 = Van der Merwe | first3 = A. | title = Searching for the Technology in University of Technology | journal = South African Computer Journal | volume = 42 | date = December 2008 | pages = 29–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the so-called ''[[Latin American docta]]'' the main higher institution advocates to the study of technology is the [[National Technological University]] which has brand ramifications through all the country geographic space in the way of ''Regional Faculties''. The [[Buenos Aires Institute of Technology]] (ITBA) is other important recognized institute of technology with renowned and prestige in the country.

;1970s–1990s
During the 1970s to early 1990s, the term was used to describe state owned and funded technical schools that offered both [[vocational education|vocational]] and higher education. They were part of the [[College of advanced education|College of Advanced Education]] system. In the 1990s most of these merged with existing universities, or formed new ones of their own. These new universities often took the title University of Technology, for marketing rather than legal purposes. AVCC report The most prominent such university in each state founded the [[Australian Technology Network]] a few years later.

;1990s–today
Since the mid-1990s, the term has been applied to some technically minded [[technical and further education]] (TAFE) institutes. A recent example is the [[Melbourne Polytechnic]]  rebranding and repositioning in 2014 from Northern Melbourne Institute of TAFE.&lt;ref&gt;Kylie Adoranti, Herald Sun, 3 October 2014 ''[http://www.heraldsun.com.au/leader/news/northern-melbourne-institute-of-tafe-to-be-rebranded-as-melbourne-polytechnic/story-fnglekhp-1227078125350 Northern Melbourne Institute of TAFE to be rebranded as Melbourne Polytechnic]'', Retrieved 2 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; These primarily offer [[vocational education]], although some like Melbourne Polytechnic are expanding into higher education offering vocationally oriented applied bachelor degrees. This usage of the term is most prevalent historically in NSW and the ACT. The new terminology is apt given that this category of institution are becoming very much like the institutes of the 1970s–1990s period.

In Tasmania in 2009 the old college system and TAFE Tasmania have started a 3-year restructure to become the Tasmanian Polytechnic www.polytechnic.tas.edu.au, Tasmanian Skills Institute www.skillsinstitute.tas.edu.au and Tasmanian Academy www.academy.tas.edu.au

In the higher education sector, there are seven designated Universities of Technology in Australia (though, note, not all use the phrase "university of technology", such as the Universities of Canberra and South Australia, which used to be Colleges of Advanced Education before transitioning into fully-fledged universities with the ability - most important of all - to confer doctorates):
* [[Curtin University]], [[Western Australia]]
* [[Queensland University of Technology]], [[Queensland]]
* [[RMIT University|Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]
* [[Swinburne University of Technology]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]
* [[University of Canberra]], [[Australian Capital Territory]]
* [[University of South Australia]], [[South Australia]]
* [[University of Technology, Sydney]], [[New South Wales]]

;Fachhochschulen
'''[[Fachhochschule]]''' is a German type of tertiary education institution and adopted later in Austria and Switzerland. They do not focus exclusively on technology, but may also offer courses in social science, medicine, business and design. They grant bachelor's degrees and master's degrees and focus more on teaching than research and more on specific professions than on science.

In 2010, there were 20 Fachhochschulen in Austria&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mokka Medienagentur GmbH |url=http://www.bmwf.gv.at/startseite/hochschulen/fachhochschulen/ |title=Bundesministerium für Wissenschaft und Forschung: Fachhochschulen |publisher=Bmwf.gv.at |date= |accessdate=2014-01-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140119223842/http://www.bmwf.gv.at/startseite/hochschulen/fachhochschulen/ |archivedate=January 19, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belgium and the Netherlands===
''Hogeschool'' is used in [[Belgium]] and in the [[Netherlands]]. The hogeschool has many similarities to the ''Fachhochschule'' in the German language areas and to the ''ammattikorkeakoulu'' in Finland.

''Hogeschool'' institutions in the [[Flemish Community]] of Belgium (such as the [[Erasmus Hogeschool Brussel]]) are currently undergoing a process of academization. They form associations with a university and integrate research into the curriculum, which will allow them to deliver academic master's degrees. &lt;!-- Don't the Walloon universities do the same?--&gt;

In the Netherlands, four former institutes of technology have become universities over the past decades. These are the current three Technical Universities (at [[Delft University of Technology|Delft]], [[Eindhoven University of Technology|Eindhoven]] and [[Universiteit Twente|Enschede]]), plus the former agricultural institute in [[Wageningen University|Wageningen]]. A list of all ''hogescholen'' in the Netherlands, including some which might be called polytechnics, can be found [[List of universities in the Netherlands#Vocational universities|here]].

===Canada===
In Canada, there are affiliate schools, colleges, institutes of technology/polytechnic institutes and universities that offer instruction in a variety of programs that can lead to engineering and applied science degrees, apprenticeship and trade programs, certificates and diplomas. Affiliate schools are polytechnic divisions belonging to a national university and offer select technical and engineering programs. Colleges, institutes of technology/polytechnic institutes and universities tend to be independent institutions.

Credentials are typically conferred at the undergraduate level; however, university-affiliated schools like the École de technologie supérieure and the École Polytechnique de Montréal (both of which are located in Quebec), also offer graduate and postgraduate programs, in accordance with provincial higher education guidelines. Canadian higher education institutions, at all levels, undertake directed and applied research with financing allocated through public funding, private equity, or industry sources.

Some of Canada's most esteemed colleges and polytechnic institutions also partake in collaborative institute-industry projects, leading to technology commercialization, made possible through the scope of [[Polytechnics Canada]], a national alliance of eleven leading research-intensive colleges and institutes of technology.

===Finland===
;Universities of technology
Universities of technology are categorised as universities, are allowed to grant B.Sc. (Tech.), [[Diplomi-insinööri|M.Sc. (Tech.)]], Lic.Sc. (Tech.), Ph.D. and D.Sc. (Tech.) degrees and roughly correspond to Instituts de technologie of French-speaking areas and Technische Universität of Germany in prestige. In addition to universities of technology, some universities, e.g. University of Oulu and Åbo Akademi University, are allowed to grant the B.Sc. (tech.), M.Sc. (tech.) and D.Sc. (Tech.) degrees.

Universities of technology are academically similar to other (non-polytechnic) universities. Prior to Bologna process, M.Sc. (Tech.) required 180 credits, whereas M.Sc. from a normal university required 160 credits. The credits between universities of technology and normal universities are comparable.

Some Finnish universities of technology are:
*[[Aalto University]], formed from [[Helsinki University of Technology]] and other universities
*[[Lappeenranta University of Technology]]
*[[Tampere University of Technology]]

;Polytechnics
Polytechnic schools are distinct from academic universities in Finland. ''[[Ammattikorkeakoulu]]'' is the common term in [[Finland]], as is the Swedish alternative "''yrkeshögskola''" – their focus is on studies leading to a degree (for instance ''insinööri'', engineer; in international use, Bachelor of Engineering) in kind different from but in level comparable to an academic bachelor's degree awarded by a university. Since 2006 the polytechnics have offered studies leading to master's degrees (Master of Engineering).  After January 1, 2006, some Finnish ammattikorkeakoulus switched the English term "polytechnic" to the term "university of applied sciences" in the English translations of their legal names. The ammattikorkeakoulu has many similarities to the ''hogeschool'' in Belgium and in the Netherlands and to the ''Fachhochschule'' in the German language areas.

Some recognized Finnish polytechnics are:
*[[Helsinki Metropolia University of Applied Sciences]]
*[[Lapland University of Applied Sciences]]
*[[Tampere University of Applied Sciences]]
*[[Turku University of Applied Sciences]]

A complete list may be found in [[List of polytechnics in Finland]].

===France and Francophone regions===

;Instituts de technologie (grandes écoles)
[[Collegiate university|Collegiate universities]] grouping several engineering schools or multi-site clusters of French [[grandes écoles]] provide sciences and technology curricula as autonomous higher education engineering institutes. They include:
* [[Arts et Métiers ParisTech]]
* [[Centrale Graduate School]]
* [[Grenoble Institute of Technology]]
* [[Institut national des sciences appliquées]]
* [[Institut Supérieur de l'Aéronautique et de l'Espace]]
* [[Paris Institute of Technology]]
* [[ESTIA Institute of Technology]]
They provide science and technology master's degrees and doctoral degrees.

;'Universités technologiques / instituts universitaires de technologie'' / polytechs
French education system also includes three universities of technology:
*''[[Université de technologie de Belfort-Montbéliard]]''
*[[University of Technology of Compiègne]]
*[[University of Technology of Troyes]]

In addition, France's education system includes many institutes of technology, embedded within most French universities. They are referred-to as ''institut universitaire de technologie'' (IUT). Instituts universitaires de technologie provide undergraduate technology curricula. 'Polytech institutes', embedded as a part of eleven French universities provide both undergraduate and graduate engineering curricula.

In the French-speaking part of Switzerland exists also the term ''haute école specialisée'' for a type of institution called ''Fachhochschule'' in the German-speaking part of the country. (see below).

;Écoles polytechniques
Higher education systems, that are influenced by the French education system set at the end of the 18th century, use a terminology derived by reference to the French ''[[École polytechnique]]''. Such terms include ''Écoles Polytechniques'' (Algeria, Belgium, Canada, France, Switzerland, Tunisia), Escola Politécnica (Brasil, Spain), Polytechnicum (Eastern Europe).

In [[French language]], higher education refers to ''écoles polytechniques'', providing science and engineering curricula:
* [[École polytechnique]] or '''X''' (near [[Paris]])
* École polytechnique de Bruxelles
* [[École polytechnique de Montréal]]
* [[École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne]]
*[[National Polytechnic Institute of Lorraine]]
*[[National Polytechnic Institute of Toulouse]]

===Germany===
;Fachhochschule{{Main|Fachhochschule}}

''Fachhochschulen'' were first founded in the early 1970s. They do not focus exclusively on technology, but may also offer courses in social science, medicine, business and design. They grant bachelor's degrees and master's degrees and focus more on teaching than research and more on specific professions than on science.

In 2009/10, there existed about 200 ''Fachhochschulen'' in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.destatis.de/jetspeed/portal/cms/Sites/destatis/Internet/DE/Content/Statistiken/BildungForschungKultur/Hochschulen/AktuellZusatz,templateId=renderPrint.psml#Fussnote1|title=Startseite&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;Statistisches Bundesamt (Destatis)|work=destatis.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; See the [[:de:Liste der Fachhochschulen in Deutschland|German Wikipedia]] for a list.

;Technische Universität
''[[Technische Universität]]'' (abbreviation: ''TU'') is the common term for universities of technology or technical university. These institutions can grant habilitation and doctoral degrees and focus on research.

The nine largest and most renowned ''Technische Universitäten'' in Germany have formed [[TU9|TU9 German Institutes of Technology]] as community of interests. Technische Universitäten normally have faculties or departements of natural sciences and often of economics but can also have units of cultural and social sciences and arts. RWTH Aachen, TU Dresden and TU München also have a faculty of medicine associated with [[Teaching hospital|university hospitals]] ([[Klinikum Aachen]], [[University Hospital Dresden]], [[Rechts der Isar Hospital]]).

There are 17 universities of technology in Germany with about 290,000 students enrolled. The four states of [[Bremen (state)|Bremen]], [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]], [[Saxony-Anhalt]] and [[Schleswig-Holstein]] are not operating a ''Technische Universität''. [[Saxony]] and [[Lower Saxony]] have the highest counts of ''TUs'', while in Saxony three out of four universities are universities of technology.

===Ireland===
{{see |Institutes of technology in Ireland}}
An "Institute of Technology" was formerly referred to as Regional Technical College (RTCs) system. The abbreviation '''IT''' is now widely used to refer to an Institute of Technology. These institutions offer sub-degree, degree and post-graduate level studies. Unlike the Irish university system an Institute of Technology also offers sub-degree programmes such as 2-year [[Higher Certificate]] programme in various academic fields of study. Some institutions have "delegated authority" that allows them to make awards in their own name, after authorisation by the [[Higher Education &amp; Training Awards Council]].

[[Dublin Institute of Technology]] developed separately from the Regional Technical College system and after several decades of association with the [[University of Dublin, Trinity College]] it acquired the authority to confer its own degrees before becoming a member of the T.U. Dublin.

The IOTI, is the representative body for the various Institutes of Technology in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ioti.ie/ Institutes of Technology Ireland&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[higher education in Italy|higher education]], ''Politecnico'' refers to a technical university awarding degrees in engineering. Historically there were two ''Politecnici'', one in each of the two largest industrial cities of the [[norther Italy|north]]:
* [[Politecnico di Torino]], established 1859;
* [[Politecnico di Milano]], established 1863.
A third ''Politecnico'' was added in the south in 1990:
* [[Politecnico di Bari]], established 1990.
However, many other universities have a faculty of engineering.

In 2003, the [[Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (Italy)|Ministry of Education, Universities and Research]] and the [[Ministry of Economy and Finance (Italy)|Ministry of Economy and Finance]] jointly established the [[Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia]] (Italian Institute of Technology), headquartered in [[Genoa]] with 10 laboratories around Italy, which however focuses on research, not entirely in the fields of engineering and does not offer undergraduate degrees.

;Technical University
There are 4 technical universities in Malaysia and all are belongs to [[Malaysian Technical University Network]]: 
*[[Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia]]
*[[Universiti Malaysia Perlis]]
*[[Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka]]
*[[Universiti Malaysia Pahang]]

===Mauritius===
The only technical university in [[Mauritius]] is the [[University of Technology, Mauritius]] with its main campus situated in La Tour Koenig, Pointe aux Sables. It has a specialized mission with a technology focus. It applies traditional and beyond traditional approaches to teaching, training, research and consultancy. The university has been founded with the aim to play a key role in the economic and social development of Mauritius through the development of programmes of direct relevance to the country’s needs, for example in areas like technology, sustainable development science and public sector policy and management.

===New Zealand===
{{See also|Public sector organisations in New Zealand#Polytechnics and institutes of technology|Education in New Zealand}}

[[New Zealand]] polytechnics are established under the Education Act 1989 as amended and are typically considered state-owned tertiary institutions along with [[university|universities]], colleges of education and [[wananga|wānanga]]; there is today often much crossover in courses and qualifications offered between all these types of [[Tertiary Education Institution]]s. Some have officially taken the title 'institute of technology' which is a term recognized in government strategies equal to that of the term 'polytechnic'.  One has opted for the name '[[Universal College of Learning]]' (UCOL) and another '[[Unitec New Zealand]]'. These are legal names but not recognized terms like 'polytechnic' or 'institute of technology'.  Many if not all now grant at least bachelor-level degrees. Some colleges of education or institutes of technology are privately owned, however, the qualification levels vary widely.

Since the 1990s, there has been consolidation in New Zealand's state-owned tertiary education system. In the polytechnic sector: Wellington Polytechnic amalgamated with [[Massey University]]. The Central Institute of Technology explored a merger with the [[Waikato Institute of Technology]], which was abandoned, but later, after financial concerns, controversially amalgamated with Hutt Valley Polytechnic, which in turn became [[Wellington Institute of Technology]]. Some smaller polytechnics in the [[North Island]], such as Waiarapa Polytechnic, amalgamated with [[Universal College of Learning|UCOL]]. (The only other amalgamations have been in the colleges of education.)

The [[Auckland University of Technology]] is the only polytechnic to have been elevated to [[university]] status; while [[Unitec New Zealand|Unitec]] has had repeated attempts blocked by government policy and consequent decisions; Unitec has not been able to convince the courts to overturn these decisions.

===Nigeria===
{{See also|List of polytechnics in Nigeria}}
Virtually every state in [[Nigeria]] has a polytechnic university operated by either the federal or state government. In [[Rivers State]] for example, there are two state-owned polytechnic universities; [[Kenule Beeson Saro-Wiwa Polytechnic]], [[Bori City]] and the [[Rivers State College of Arts and Science]], [[Port Harcourt]]. The former was established on 13 May 1988 while the latter–though founded in 1984–was approved by the [[National Board for Technical Education|NBTE]] in 2006. The first private polytechnic university in the state is the [[Eastern Polytechnic, Port Harcourt|Eastern Polytechnic]], established in 2008.

===Pakistan===

The polytechnic institutes in [[Pakistan]] offer [[diploma]] spanning three years in different engineering branches. This diploma is known as [[Diploma of Associate Engineering]] (DAE). Students are admitted to the diploma program based on their results in the 10th grade standardized exams. The main purpose of the diploma offered in polytechnic institutes is to train people in various trades.

These institutes are located throughout Pakistan and have been in service since early 1950s.

After successfully completion of diploma at a polytechnic, students can get employment or enroll either in [[Bachelor of Technology]] (B.Tech) or [[Bachelor of Engineering]] (BE) degree programs.

===Poland===
'''Politechnika''' (translated as a "technical university" or "university of technology") is the designation of a technical university in Poland. Here are some of the larger Polytechnics in Poland:
*[[Politechnika Śląska]]
*[[Politechnika Wrocławska]]
*[[Politechnika Warszawska]]
*[[Poznań University of Technology|Politechnika Poznańska]]
*[[Politechnika Krakowska]]

*[[West Pomeranian University of Technology|Zachodniopomorski Uniwersytet Technologiczny]]

===Portugal===
{{Main|Polytechnic (Portugal)}}
The designation "Institute of Technology" is not applied at all, being meaningless in [[Portugal]]. However, there are a number of non-university [[list of higher education institutions in Portugal|higher educational institutions]] which are called [[Polytechnic (Portugal)|polytechnic institutes]] since the 1970s. Some of these institutions existed since the 19th century with different designations (industrial and commercial institutes, agricultural managers, elementary teachers and nurses schools, etc.). In theory, the polytechnics higher education system is aimed to provide a more practical training and be profession-oriented, while the university higher education system is aimed to have a stronger theoretical basis and be highly research-oriented. The polytechnics are also oriented to provide shorter length studies aimed to respond to local needs. The Portuguese polytechnics can then be compared to the US [[community colleges]].

Since the implementation of [[Bologna Process]] in Portugal in 2007, the polytechnics offer the 1st cycle (licentiate degree) and 2nd cycle (master's degree) of higher studies. Until 1998, the polytechnics only awarded bachelor ({{lang-pt|bacharelato}}) degrees (three-year short-cycle degrees) and were not authorized to award higher degrees. They however granted post-bachelor diplomas in specialized higher studies (DESE, ''diploma de estudos superiores especializados''), that could be obtained after the conclusion of a two-year second cycle of studies and were academical equivalent to the university's [[licentiate degree]]s (''licenciatura''). After 1998, they started to be allowed to confer their own licentiate degrees, which replaced the DESE diplomas.

The Polytechnics in Singapore do not offer bachelors, masters or PhD degrees. However, the Polytechnics in Singapore offers three-year diploma courses in fields such as information technology, engineering subjects and other vocational fields, like psychology and nursing. The Polytechnic diploma certification in Singapore is equivalent to a [[junior college]] in the UK or a [[community college]] in the United States. There are 5 polytechnics in Singapore. They are namely: [[Singapore Polytechnic]], [[Ngee Ann Polytechnic]], [[Temasek Polytechnic]], [[Nanyang Polytechnic]] and [[Republic Polytechnic]].

A Polytechnic diploma in Singapore is known to be parallel and sometimes equivalent to the first years at a bachelor's degree-granting institution, thus, Polytechnic graduates in Singapore have the privilege of being granted transfer credits or module exemptions when they apply to local and overseas universities, depending on the university's policies on transfer credits.

The only university in Singapore with the term "institute of technology", most notably the [[Singapore Institute of Technology]] were developed in 2009 as an option for Polytechnic Diploma graduates who desire to pursue a bachelor's degree. Other technological university in Singapore includes the [[Nanyang Technological University]] (1981) and the [[Singapore University of Technology and Design]] (2009).

has completed a process of transforming its "higher education landscape". Historically a division has existed in South Africa between Universities and Technikons (polytechnics) as well between institutions servicing particular racial and language groupings. In 1993 Technikons were afforded the power to award [[Bachelor of Technology#South Africa|certain technology degrees]].
Beginning in 2004 former Technikons have either been merged with traditional Universities to form Comprehensive Universities or have become Universities of Technology, however the Universities of Technology have not to date acquired all of the traditional rights and privileges of a University (such as the ability to confer a wide range of degrees).&lt;ref&gt;Mentz, J., Kotzé, P., Van der Merwe, A.

Most of Thailand's institutes of technology were developed from [[technical college]]s, in the past could not grant bachelor's degrees; today, however, they are [[university]] level institutions, some of which can grant degrees to the [[doctorate|doctoral]] level. Examples are [[Pathumwan Institute of Technology]] (developed from Pathumwan Technical School), [[King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang]] (Nondhaburi Telecommunications Training Centre) and [[King Mongkut's Institute of Technology North Bangkok]] (Thai-German Technical School).

There are two former institutes of technology, which already changed their name to "University of Technology": [[Rajamangala University of Technology]] (formerly Institute of Technology and Vocational Education) and [[King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi]] (Thonburi Technology Institute).

Institutes of technology with different origins are [[Asian Institute of Technology]], which developed from [[SEATO]] Graduate School of Engineering and [[Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology]], an engineering school of [[Thammasat University]]. [[Suranaree University of Technology]] is the only government-owned technological university in Thailand that was established (1989) as such; while [[Mahanakorn University of Technology]] is the most well known private technological institute.

In [[Turkey]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]], the oldest technical university is [[Istanbul Technical University]]. Its graduates contributed to a wide variety of activities in scientific research and development. In 1950s, 2 technical universities were opened in [[Ankara]] and [[Trabzon]]. In recent years, Yildiz University is reorganized as [[Yildiz Technical University]] and 2 institutes of technology were founded in [[İzmit|Kocaeli]] and [[Izmir]]. In 2010, another technical university named [[Bursa Technical University]] was founded in Bursa. Moreover, a sixth technical university is about to be opened in Konya named [[Konya Technical University]].

===United Kingdom===
'''Polytechnics'''{{Main|Polytechnic (United Kingdom)}}

Polytechnics were [[tertiary education]] teaching institutions in [[England]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]]. The comparable institutions in [[Scotland]] were collectively referred to as [[Central Institution]]s.

From 1965 to 1992, UK polytechnics operated under the [[Binary Divide|binary system]] of education along with universities.  Polytechnics offered diplomas and degrees (bachelor's, master's, PhD) validated at the national level by the [[Council for National Academic Awards]] (CNAA). They particularly excelled in engineering and applied science degree courses and other [[science, technology, engineering and mathematics|STEM]] subjects similar to technological universities in the USA and continental Europe.  Polytechnics were associated with innovations including [[women’s studies]], the academic study of [[communication studies|communications]] and [[media studies|media]], [[sandwich degree]]s and the rise of management and [[business studies]]. 

Britain's first polytechnic, the [[Royal Polytechnic Institution]] later known as the [[Polytechnic of Central London]] (now the [[University of Westminster]]) was established in 1838 at Regent Street in London and its goal was to educate and popularize engineering and scientific knowledge and inventions in Victorian Britain "at little expense."  The London Polytechnic led a mass movement to create numerous polytechnic institutes across the UK in the late 19th century.  Most polytechnic institutes were established at the centre of major metropolitan cities and their focus was on engineering, applied science and technology education.

The designation "institute of technology" was occasionally used by polytechnics (Bolton), [[Central Institution]]s (Dundee, Robert Gordon's) and postgraduate universities, (Cranfield and Wessex), most of which later adopted the designation university and there were two "institutes of science and technology": [[UMIST]] and UWIST, part of the [[University of Wales]]. [[Loughborough University]] was called Loughborough University of Technology from 1966 to 1996, the only institution in the UK to have had such a designation.

Polytechnics were granted university status under the [[Further and Higher Education Act 1992]].  This meant that polytechnics could confer degrees without the oversight of the national CNAA organization.  These institutions are sometimes referred to as [[New universities (United Kingdom)#Post-1992 universities that trace their roots to former polytechnics|post-1992 universities]].

'''Technical colleges'''

In 1956, some colleges of technology received the designation [[college of advanced technology (United Kingdom)|college of advanced technology]]. They became universities in 1966 meaning they could award their own degrees. 

Institutions called "technical institutes" or "technical schools" that were formed in the early 20th century provided further education between high school and university or polytechnic.  Most technical institutes have been merged into regional colleges and some have been designated university colleges if they are associated with a local university.

In 2016 the UK government announced plans to establish new "institutes of technology" in England as part of its reforms to post-16 skills provision "to provide technical education in STEM subjects at levels 3, 4 and 5. Each IoT is likely to build on infrastructure that already exists but will have its own independent identity, governance arrangements which directly involve employers and national branding".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/536068/56259_Cm_9280_print.pdf |title=Data |website=www.gov.uk |format=PDF}} &lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{Main|Institute of Technology (United States)}}
[[Image:Teamsolvingpuzzle.jpg|thumb|Students from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]]]
Polytechnic institutes in the USA are technological universities, many dating back to the mid-19th century.  A handful of American universities include the phrases "Institute of Technology", "Polytechnic Institute", "Polytechnic University", or similar phrasing in their names; these are generally [[research]]-intensive universities with a focus on engineering, science and technology. The earliest of these institutions include: [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] (RPI, 1824), [[Rochester Institute of Technology]] (RIT, 1829), [[New York University Tandon School of Engineering|Brooklyn Collegiate and Polytechnic Institute]] (1854), [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]  (MIT, 1861), [[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]] (1865), [[Stevens Institute of Technology]] (1870), [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University]] (VPI or VT, 1872), [[New Jersey Institute of Technology]] (1881), [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] (1885), [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech, 1891), [[Drexel University|Drexel Institute of Art, Science and Industry]] (1891) and [[Carnegie Institute of Technology]] (1900). Conversely, schools dubbed "technical colleges" or "technical institutes" generally provide post-secondary training in technical and mechanical fields, focusing on training vocational skills primarily at a [[community college]] level, parallel and sometimes equivalent to the first two years at a bachelor's degree-granting institution.

===Venezuela===
Institutes of technology in Venezuela were developed in the 1950s as an option for post-secondary education in technical and scientific courses, after the ''polytechnic'' French concepts.  At that time, technical education was considered essential for the development of a sound [[middle class]] economy.

Nowadays, most of the ''Institutos de Tecnología'' are privately run businesses, with varying degrees of quality.

Most of these institutes award diplomas after three or three and a half years of education. The institute of technology implementation (IUT, from ''Instituto universitario de tecnologia'' in Spanish) began with the creation of the first IUT at Caracas, the capital city of Venezuela, called IUT. Dr. Federico Rivero Palacio adopted the French "Institut Universitaire de Technologie"s system, using French personnel and study system based on three-year periods, with research and engineering facilities at the same level as the main national universities to obtain French equivalent degrees. This IUT is the first and only one in Venezuela having French equivalent degrees accepted, implementing this system and observing the high-level degrees some other IUTs were created in 
Venezuela, regardless of this the term IUT was not used appropriately resulting in some institutions with mediocre quality and no equivalent degree in France. Later, some private institutions sprang up using IUT in their names, but they are not regulated by the original French system and award lower quality degrees.

[[File:Speakers.JPG|thumb|right|280px|[[MTX Audio]] loudspeaker enclosures (with rear panel reflex port tubes) which can mount 15 inch [[woofer]]s, mid-range drivers and horn and/or compression tweeters. In this photo, only one driver is mounted.]]
[[File:Electrodynamic-loudspeaker.png|thumb|right|180px|A cabinet with loudspeakers mounted in the holes. Number 1 is a mid-range driver. Number 2 is a high-range driver. Number 3 indicates two low-frequency [[woofer]]s. Below the bottom woofer is a [[bass reflex]] port.]]
A '''loudspeaker enclosure''' or '''loudspeaker cabinet''' is an enclosure (often box-shaped) in which [[speaker driver]]s (e.g., [[loudspeaker]]s and [[tweeter]]s) and associated electronic hardware, such as [[Audio crossover|crossover circuits]] and, in some cases, [[power amplifiers]], are mounted. Enclosures may range in design from simple, homemade [[DIY]] rectangular particleboard boxes to very complex, expensive computer-designed [[hi-fi]] cabinets that incorporate composite materials, internal baffles, horns, [[Bass reflex|bass reflex ports]] and acoustic insulation. Loudspeaker enclosures range in size from small [[Bookshelf speaker|"bookshelf" speaker]] cabinets with 4" woofers and small [[tweeter]]s designed for listening to music with a [[hi-fi]] system in a private home to huge, heavy [[subwoofer]] enclosures with multiple 18" or even 21" speakers in huge enclosures which are designed for use in stadium concert [[sound reinforcement system]]s for [[rock music]] concerts.

The primary role of the enclosure is to prevent sound waves generated by the rearward-facing surface of the [[Diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]] of an open speaker driver interacting with sound waves generated at the front of the speaker driver.  Because the forward- and rearward-generated sounds are out of phase with each other, any interaction between the two in the listening space creates a distortion of the original signal as it was intended to be reproduced. As such, a loudspeaker cannot be used without installing it in a cabinet of some type, or mounting it into a wall or ceiling. Additionally, because the sound waves would travel different paths through the listening space, the sound waves in an unmounted speaker would arrive at the listener's position at slightly different times, introducing [[Echo (phenomenon)|echo]] and [[reverberation]] effects not part of the original sound.

The enclosure also plays a role in managing vibration induced by the driver frame and moving airmass within the enclosure, as well as heat generated by driver voice coils and amplifiers (especially where woofers and subwoofers are concerned).  Sometimes considered part of the enclosure, the base, may include specially designed "feet" to decouple the speaker from the floor. Enclosures designed for use in [[PA system]]s, [[sound reinforcement system]]s and for use by electric musical instrument players (e.g., [[bass amplifier|bass amp cabinets]] have a number of features to make them easier to transport, such as carrying handles on the top or sides, metal or plastic corner protectors, and metal grilles to protect the speakers). Speaker enclosures designed for use in a home or [[recording studio]] typically do not have handles or corner protectors, although they do still usually have a cloth or mesh cover to protect the woofer and tweeter. These [[Speaker grille|speaker grilles]] are a metallic or cloth mesh that are used to protect the speaker by forming a protective cover over the speaker's cone while allowing sound to pass through undistorted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.metlx.com/perforated/speaker-grilles/|title=Speaker Grille Manufacturing|work=Metalex|access-date=2017-08-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaker enclosures are used in homes in stereo systems, [[home cinema]] systems, [[television]]s, [[boom box]]es and many other audio appliances. Small speaker enclosures are used in [[car stereo]] systems. Speaker cabinets are key components of a number of commercial applications, including [[sound reinforcement system]]s, [[movie theatre]] sound systems and [[recording studio]]s. Electric musical instruments invented in the 20th century, such as the [[electric guitar]], [[electric bass]] and [[synthesizer]], among others, are amplified using [[instrument amplifier]]s and speaker cabinets (e.g., [[guitar amplifier]] speaker cabinets).

== History ==

Early on, radio loudspeakers consisted of [[Horn loudspeaker|horns]], often sold separately from the radio itself, (typically a small wood box containing the radio's electronic circuits&lt;ref&gt;Illustrations [http://www.radioblvd.com/20sRadio.html] Retrieved November 26, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;), so they were not usually housed in an enclosure.&lt;ref&gt;Illustrations [http://www.sparkmuseum.com/HORNS.HTM], Retrieved November 26, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  When paper cone loudspeaker drivers were introduced in the mid 1920s, radio cabinets began to be made larger to enclose both the electronics and the loudspeaker.&lt;ref&gt;Illustrations [http://www.radiolaguy.com/Showcase/Console/Gallery-Console.htm] Retrieved November 26, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  These cabinets were made largely for the sake of appearance, with the loudspeaker simply mounted behind a round hole in the cabinet.  It was observed that the enclosure had a strong effect on the bass response of the speaker. Since the rear of the loudspeaker radiates sound out of phase from the front, there can be constructive and destructive interference for loudspeakers without enclosures, and below frequencies related to the baffle dimensions in open-baffled loudspeakers (described in Background section, below). This results in a loss of bass and [[comb filter]]ing (i.e. response peaks and dips in power regardless of the signal meant to be reproduced).
[[File:Lansing Iconic multicell horn speaker 1937.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A Lansing Iconic multicell horn loudspeaker from 1937.]]
Before the 1950s many manufacturers did not fully enclose their loudspeaker cabinets; the back of the cabinet was typically left open. This was done for several reasons, not least because electronics (at that time tube equipment) could be placed inside and cooled by convection in the open enclosure. 
 
Most of the enclosure types discussed in this article were invented either to wall off the out of phase sound from one side of the driver, or to modify it so that it could be used to enhance the sound produced from the other side.  However, a few designs have ventured in a different direction, attempting to incorporate the natural acoustic properties of the cabinet material rather than deaden it, and shape the cabinet so that the rear can remain open and still provide good bass response with limited comb filtering.&lt;ref&gt;Auditorium 23 [http://www.toneimports.com/auditorium23/abouta23.html], Retrieved November 26, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
[[File:Medium density fiberboard.jpg|thumb|right|210px|[[Medium density fiberboard]] is a common material out of which loudspeaker enclosures are built.]]
In some respects, the ideal mounting for a low-frequency loudspeaker driver would be a rigid flat panel of infinite size with infinite space behind it. This would entirely prevent the rear sound waves from interfering (i.e., [[comb filter]] cancellations) with the sound waves from the front. An "open baffle" loudspeaker is an approximation of this, since the [[transducer|driver]] is mounted on a panel, with dimensions comparable to the lowest [[wavelength]] to be reproduced. In either case, the driver would need a relatively stiff suspension to provide the restoring force which might have been provided at low frequencies by a smaller sealed or ported enclosure, so few drivers are suitable for this kind of mounting.

The forward- and rearward-generated sounds of a speaker driver appear out of phase from each other because they are generated through opposite motion of the diaphragm and because they travel different paths before converging at the listener's position. A speaker driver mounted on a finite baffle will display a physical phenomenon known as [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] which can result in a perceivable frequency-dependent sound attenuation.  This phenomenon is particularly noticeable at low frequencies where the wavelengths are large enough that interference will affect the entire listening area.

Since infinite baffles are impractical and finite baffles tend to suffer poor response as wavelengths approach the dimensions of the baffle (i.e. at lower frequencies), most loudspeaker cabinets use some sort of structure (usually a box) to contain the out of phase sound energy. The box is typically made of wood, wood composite, or more recently plastic, for reasons of ease of construction and appearance. Stone, concrete, plaster, and even building structures have also been used.

Enclosures can have a significant effect beyond what was intended, with panel [[resonance]]s, [[diffraction]] from cabinet edges and [[standing wave]] energy from internal reflection/reinforcement modes being among the possible problems. Bothersome resonances can be reduced by increasing enclosure mass or rigidity, by increasing the damping of enclosure walls or wall/surface treatment combinations, by adding stiff cross bracing, or by adding internal absorption. [[Wharfedale (company)|Wharfedale]], in some designs, reduced panel resonance by using two wooden cabinets (one inside the other) with the space between filled with [[sand]]. Home experimenters have even designed speakers built from [[concrete]], [[granite]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diyaudioprojects.com/Speakers/Seas-Granite-Speakers/ |title=DIY Granite Speaker Project |publisher=Diyaudioprojects.com |date= |accessdate=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other exotic materials for similar reasons.

Many diffraction problems, above the lower frequencies, can be alleviated by the shape of the enclosure, such as by avoiding sharp corners on the front of the enclosure. Research experiments from the 1930s by Dr. [[Harry F. Olson]] showed that curved loudspeaker baffles reduce some response deviations due to sound wave diffraction. It was discovered later that careful placement of a speaker on a sharp-edged baffle can reduce diffraction-caused response problems. Sometimes the differences in phase response at frequencies shared by different drivers can be addressed by adjusting the vertical location of the smaller drivers (usually backwards), or by leaning or 'stepping' the front baffle, so that the wavefront from all drivers is [[Coherence (physics)|coherent]] at and around the crossover frequencies in the speaker's normal sound field. The acoustic center of the driver dictates the amount of rearward offset needed to "time-align" the drivers.

== Types==
[[File:LS3 5A without grilles (clip).jpg|thumb|right|160px|A small LS3/5A "bookshelf speaker" with its protective cover removed.]]
Enclosures used for [[woofer]]s and [[subwoofer]]s can be adequately modeled in the low-frequency region (approximately 100&amp;ndash;200&amp;nbsp;Hz and below) using [[acoustics]] and the [[lumped component]] models. Electrical filter theory has been used with considerable success for some enclosure types. For the purposes of this type of analysis, each enclosure must be classified according to a specific topology. The designer must balance low bass extension, linear frequency response, efficiency, distortion, loudness and enclosure size, while simultaneously addressing issues higher in the audible frequency range such as diffraction from enclosure edges, the baffle step effect when wavelengths approach enclosure dimensions, crossovers, and driver blending.

=== Sealed (or closed) enclosures ===
[[File:Stuffed box.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A box stuffed with [[fiberglass]] [[soundproofing|insulation]] to increase the perceived volume of the box]]
[[Image:Geschlossenes Lautsprechergehäuse (enclosure).png|thumb|100px|Sealed enclosure]]
The loudspeaker driver's moving mass and [[Stiffness|compliance]] (slackness or reciprocal stiffness of the suspension) determines the driver's [[resonance|resonant frequency]] (''F&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''). In combination with the [[damping]] properties of the system (both mechanical and electrical) all these factors affect the low-frequency response of sealed-box systems. Output falls below the system's resonant frequency (''F&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''), defined as the frequency of peak impedance. In a closed-box, the air inside the box acts as a spring, returning the cone to the 'zero' position in the absence of a signal. A significant increase in the effective volume of a sealed-box loudspeaker can be achieved by a filling of fibrous material, typically fiberglass, bonded acetate fiber (BAF) or long-fiber wool. The effective volume increase can be as much as 40% and is due primarily to a reduction in the speed of sound propagation through the filler material as compared to air.&lt;ref&gt;L. Beranek, Acoustics, 2nd Ed. 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; The enclosure or driver must have a small leak so internal and external pressures can equalise over time, to compensate for [[barometric pressure]] or altitude; the porous nature of paper cones, or an imperfectly sealed enclosure, is normally sufficient to provide this slow pressure equalisation.

==== Infinite baffle ====
A variation on the 'open baffle' approach is to mount the loudspeaker driver in a very large sealed enclosure, providing minimal 'air spring' restoring force to the cone. This minimizes the change in the driver's resonant frequency caused by the enclosure. Some infinite baffle 'enclosures' have used an adjoining room, basement, or a closet or attic. This is often the case with exotic [[rotary woofer]] installations, as they are intended to go to frequencies lower than 20 Hertz and displace large volumes of air. "Infinite baffle" or simply "IB" is also used as a generic term for sealed enclosures of ''any'' size, the name being used because of the ability of a sealed enclosure to prevent any interaction between the forward and rear radiation of a driver at low frequencies.

In conceptual terms an infinite baffle is a flat baffle that extends out to infinity – the so-called "endless plate". A genuine infinite baffle cannot be constructed but a very large baffle such as the wall of a room can be considered to be a practical equivalent. A genuine infinite-baffle loudspeaker has an infinite volume (a half-space) on each side of the baffle and has no baffle step. However the term "infinite-baffle loudspeaker" can fairly be applied to any loudspeaker that behaves (or closely approximates) in all respects as if the drive unit is mounted in a genuine infinite baffle. The term is often and erroneously used of sealed enclosures which cannot exhibit infinite-baffle behavior unless their internal volume is much greater than the Vas [[Thiele/Small]] of the drive unit AND the front baffle dimensions are ideally several wavelengths of the lowest output frequency. It is important to distinguish between genuine infinite-baffle topology and so-called infinite-baffle or IB "enclosures" which may not meet genuine infinite-baffle criteria. The distinction becomes important when interpreting textbook usage of the term.&lt;ref&gt;Acoustics, Leo Beranek, 1954 Ed (P118, 1996 print)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;e.g. The Art of Sound Reproduction, John Watkinson, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Acoustic suspension ====

[[Acoustic suspension]] or air suspension is a variation of the closed-box enclosure, using a box size that exploits the almost linear air spring resulting in 30-40 Hz from a box of only one to two cubic feet or so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanspeakers.com/whatis/AS.htm|title=What is Acoustic Suspension?|last=Powell|first=Huw|website=HUMAN Speakers|access-date=2017-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "spring" suspension that restores the cone to a neutral position is a combination of an exceptionally compliant (soft) woofer suspension, and the air inside the enclosure. At frequencies below system resonance, the air pressure caused by the cone motion is the dominant force. Developed by [[Edgar Villchur]] in 1954, this technique was used in the very successful [[Acoustic Research]] line of "bookshelf" speakers in the 1960s-70s.  The acoustic suspension principle takes advantage of this relatively linear spring. The enhanced suspension linearity of this type of system is an advantage. For a specific driver, an optimal acoustic suspension cabinet will be smaller than a bass reflex, but the bass reflex cabinet will have a lower -3 dB point. The voltage sensitivity above the tuning frequency remains a function of the driver, and not of the cabinet design.{{clear}}

==== Isobaric loading ====
{{further|Isobaric speakers}}
[[File:Linn Isobarik DMS loudspeaker enclosure.png|thumb|right|180px|Isobaric loudspeaker in a cone-to-magnet (in-phase) arrangement. The image above shows a sealed enclosure; vented enclosures may also use the isobaric scheme.]]
The isobaric [[loudspeaker]] configuration was first introduced by [[Harry F. Olson]] in the early 1950s, and refers to systems in which two or more identical [[woofers]] (bass drivers) operate simultaneously, with a common body of enclosed air adjoining one side of each diaphragm.  In practical applications, they are most often used to improve low-end [[frequency response]] without increasing cabinet size, though at the expense of cost and weight. Two identical, loudspeakers are coupled to work together as one unit: they are mounted one behind the other in a casing to define a chamber of air in between. The volume of this "isobaric" chamber is usually chosen to be fairly small for reasons of convenience. The two drivers operating in tandem exhibit exactly the same behavior as one loudspeaker in twice the cabinet.

=== Ported (or reflex) enclosures ===
{{anchor|Ported enclosure}}

==== Bass-reflex ====
{{main|Bass reflex}}
[[Image:Bassreflex-Gehäuse (enclosure).png|right|thumb|100px|Bass reflex enclosure]]
[[File:RCA2ways.jpg|left|thumb|160px|RCA [[shelf stereo]] bass reflex multi-way speakers]]
Also known as vented (or ported) systems, these enclosures have a vent or hole cut into the cabinet and a port tube affixed to the hole, to improve low-frequency output, increase efficiency, or reduce the size of an enclosure. Bass reflex designs are used in home stereo speakers (including both low- to mid-priced speaker cabinets and expensive [[hi-fi]] cabinets), [[bass amplifier]] speaker cabinets, [[keyboard amplifier]] cabinets, [[subwoofer]] cabinets and [[PA system]] speaker cabinets. Vented or ported cabinets use [[reflex port|cabinet opening]]s or transform and transmit low-frequency energy from the rear of the speaker to the listener. They deliberately and successfully exploit [[Helmholtz resonance]]. As with sealed enclosures, they may be empty, lined, filled or (rarely) stuffed with damping materials. Port tuning frequency is a function of cross-section and length. This enclosure type is very common, and provides more sound pressure level near the tuning frequency than a sealed enclosure of the same volume, though it actually has less low frequency extension since the "rolloff" is steeper (24db/oct vs. 12db/oct for a sealed enclosure). [[Malcolm Hill (audio engineer)|Malcolm Hill]] pioneered the use of these designs in a live event context in the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hifisoundconnection.com/Hill-Speaker-Systems-Design-Philosophy |title=Hill heritage and design philosophy |publisher=Hifisoundconnection.com |date= |accessdate=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vented system design using computer modeling has been practiced since about 1985, when researchers [[Thiele/Small|Thiele and Small]] first systematically applied electrical filter theory to the acoustic behavior of loudspeakers in enclosures. While ported loudspeakers had been produced for many years before computer modeling, achieving optimum performance was challenging, as it is a complex sum of the properties of the specific driver, the enclosure and port, because of imperfect understanding of the assorted interactions. These enclosures are sensitive to small variations in driver characteristics and require special quality control concern for uniform performance across a production run. Bass ports are widely used in [[subwoofer]]s for [[PA system]]s and [[sound reinforcement system]]s, in [[bass amp]] speaker cabinets and in [[keyboard amp]] speaker cabinets.

==== Passive radiator ====
[[Image:Passive radiator enclosure.svg|thumb|right|100px|Passive radiator enclosure]]
{{main|Passive radiator (speaker)}}
A [[Passive radiator (speaker)|passive radiator]] speaker uses a second "passive" driver, or drone, to produce similar low-frequency extension, or efficiency increase, or enclosure size reduction, similar to ported enclosures. The passive driver is not wired to an amplifier; instead, it moves in response to changing enclosure pressures. In theory, such designs are variations of the bass reflex type, but with the advantage of avoiding a relatively small port or tube through which air moves, sometimes noisily. Tuning adjustments for a passive radiator are usually accomplished more quickly than with a bass reflex design since such corrections can be as simple as mass adjustments to the drone. The disadvantages are that a passive radiator requires precision construction quite like a driver, thus increasing costs, and has excursion limitations.

==== Compound or band-pass ====
[[Image:Bandpass enclosure.gif|thumb|left|120px|Compound or 4th order band-pass enclosure]]
A 4th order electrical bandpass filter can be simulated by a vented box in which the contribution from the rear face of the driver cone is trapped in a sealed box, and the radiation from the front surface of the cone is into a ported chamber. This modifies the resonance of the driver. In its simplest form a compound enclosure has two chambers. The dividing wall between the chambers holds the driver; typically only one chamber is ported.

If the enclosure on each side of the woofer has a port in it then the enclosure yields a 6th order band-pass response. These are considerably harder to design and tend to be very sensitive to driver characteristics. As in other reflex enclosures, the ports may generally be replaced by passive radiators if desired.
An eighth order bandpass box is another variation which also has a narrow frequency range. They are often used to achieve [[sound pressure level]]s in which case a bass tone of a specific frequency would be used versus anything musical. They are complicated to build and must be done quite precisely in order to perform nearly as intended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=volt |url=http://www.the12volt.com/caraudio/boxes6.asp#2 |title=Subwoofer Enclosures, Sixth and Eighth Order/Bass Reflex and Bandpass |publisher=The12volt.com |date= |accessdate=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Aperiodic enclosures ====

This design falls between acoustic suspension and bass reflex enclosures. It can be thought of as either a leaky sealed box or a ported box with large amounts of port damping. By setting up a port, and then blocking it precisely with sufficiently tightly packed fiber filling, it's possible to adjust the damping in the port as desired. The result is control of the resonance behavior of the system which improves low-frequency reproduction, according to some designers. [[Dynaco]] was a primary producer of these enclosures for many years, using designs developed by a Scandinavian driver maker. The design remains uncommon among commercial designs currently available. A reason for this may be that adding damping material is a needlessly inefficient method of increasing damping; the same alignment can be achieved by simply choosing a loudspeaker driver with the appropriate [[Thiele/Small|parameters]] and precisely tuning the enclosure and port for the desired response.

A similar technique has been used in aftermarket [[car audio]]; it is called "aperiodic membrane" (AP). A resistive mat is placed in front of or directly behind the loudspeaker driver (usually mounted on the rear deck of the car in order to use the trunk as an enclosure). The loudspeaker driver is sealed to the mat so that all acoustic output in one direction must pass through the mat. This increases mechanical damping, and the resulting decrease in the impedance magnitude at [[resonance]] is generally the desired effect, though there is no perceived or objective benefit to this. Again, this technique reduces efficiency and the same result can be achieved through selection of a driver with a lower [[Q factor]], or even via electronic [[Equalization (audio)|equalization]]. This is reinforced by the purveyors of AP membranes; they are often sold with an electronic processor which, via equalization, restores the bass output lost through the mechanical damping. The effect of the equalization is opposite to that of the AP membrane, resulting in a loss of damping and an effective response similar to that of the loudspeaker without the aperiodic membrane and electronic processor.

=== Dipole enclosures ===
[[Image:Dipole speaker.gif|thumb|200px|Dipole speakers and their radiation pattern]]

{{main|Dipole speaker}}
A dipole enclosure in its simplest form is a driver located on a flat baffle panel, similar to older open back cabinet designs. The baffle's edges are sometimes folded back to reduce its apparent size, creating a sort of open-backed box. A rectangular cross-section is more common than curved ones since it is easier to fabricate in a folded form than a circular one. The baffle dimensions are typically chosen to obtain a particular low-frequency response, with larger dimensions giving a lower frequency before the front and rear waves interfere with each other. A dipole enclosure has a "figure-of-eight" radiation pattern, which means that there is a reduction in sound pressure, or loudness, at the sides as compared to the front and rear. This is useful if it can be used to prevent the sound from being as loud in some places as in others.
{{clear}}

=== Horn enclosures ===
[[Image:Horn speaker.GIF|frame|right|300px|Horn loudspeaker schematic]]
{{main|Horn loudspeaker}}
A horn loudspeaker is a speaker system using a [[horn (acoustic)|horn]] to match the driver cone to the air. The horn structure itself does not amplify, but rather improves the coupling between the speaker driver and the air. Properly designed horns have the effect of making the speaker cone transfer more of the electrical energy in the voice coil into the air; in effect the driver appears to have higher efficiency. Horns can help control dispersion at higher frequencies which is useful in some applications such as sound reinforcement. The mathematical theory of horn coupling is well developed and understood, though implementation is sometimes difficult. Properly designed horns for high frequencies are small (above say 3&amp;nbsp;kHz or so, a few centimetres or inches), those for mid-range frequencies (perhaps 300&amp;nbsp;Hz to 2&amp;nbsp;kHz) much larger, perhaps 30 to 60&amp;nbsp;cm (1 or 2 feet), and for low frequencies (under 300&amp;nbsp;Hz) very large, a few metres (dozens of feet). In the 1950s, a few high fidelity enthusiasts actually built full sized horns whose structures were built into a house wall or basement. With the coming of stereo (two speakers) and surround sound (four or more), plain horns became even more impractical. Various speaker manufacturers have produced folded low-frequency horns which are much smaller (e.g., Altec Lansing, JBL, Klipsch, Lowther, Tannoy) and actually fit in practical rooms. These are necessarily compromises, and because they are physically complex, they are expensive.

==== Multiple entry horn ====
[[Image:Multiple entry horn.png|thumb|right|130px|Multiple entry horn]]
The multiple entry horn (also known as a ''coentrant horn'', ''unity horn'' or ''synergy horn'') is a manifold speaker design; it uses several different drivers mounted on the horn at stepped distances from the horn's apex, where the high frequency driver is placed. Depending on implementation, this design offers an improvement in transient response as each of the drivers is aligned in phase and time and exits the same horn mouth. A more uniform radiation pattern throughout the frequency range is also possible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danleysoundlabs.com/pdf/Danley%20SH-50%20-%20Pat%20Brown%20-%20Live%20Sound%20May-2006.pdf ''Loudspeaker Profile: Danley Sound Labs SH-50''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916070847/http://www.danleysoundlabs.com/pdf/Danley%20SH-50%20-%20Pat%20Brown%20-%20Live%20Sound%20May-2006.pdf |date=2008-09-16 }} Live Sound International. May 2006, Volume 15, Number 5. TechTopic. Pat Brown.&lt;/ref&gt; A uniform pattern allows smooth arraying of multiple enclosures.&lt;ref name=danley&gt;Danley Sound Labs. [http://www.danleysoundlabs.com/pdf/danley_tapped.pdf A White Paper on Danley Sound Labs Tapped Horn and Synergy Horn Technologies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206042009/http://danleysoundlabs.com/pdf/danley_tapped.pdf |date=2009-02-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tapped horn ====
Both sides of a long-excursion high-power driver in a tapped horn enclosure are ported into the horn itself, with one path length long and the other short. These two paths combine in phase at the horn's mouth within the frequency range of interest. This design is especially effective at subwoofer frequencies and offers reductions in enclosure size along with more output.&lt;ref name=danley/&gt;

=== Transmission line ===
{{main|Transmission line loudspeaker}}
[[Image:TransmissionLineSpeaker.png|thumb|right|100px|Transmission line enclosure]]
A perfect [[Transmission line loudspeaker|transmission line enclosure]] has an infinitely long line, stuffed with absorbent material such that all the rear radiation of the driver is fully absorbed, down to the lowest frequencies. Theoretically, the vent at the far end could be closed or open with no difference in performance. The density of and material used for the stuffing is critical, as too much stuffing will cause reflections due to back-pressure,{{dubious|date=July 2018}} whilst insufficient stuffing will allow sound to pass through to the vent. Stuffing often is of different materials and densities, changing as one gets further from the back of the driver's diaphragm.

Consequent to the above, practical Transmission Line loudspeakers are not true Transmission Lines, as there is generally output from the vent at the lowest frequencies. They can be thought of as a waveguide in which the structure shifts the phase of the driver's rear output by at least 90°{{dubious|date=July 2018}}, thereby reinforcing the frequencies near the driver's [[Thiele/Small|F&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;]]. Transmission lines tend to be larger than ported enclosures of approximately comparable performance, due to the size and length of the guide required (typically 1/4 the longest wavelength of interest).

The design is often described as non-resonant, and some designs are sufficiently stuffed with absorbent material that there is indeed not much output from the line's port. But it is the inherent resonance (typically at 1/4 wavelength) that can enhance the bass response in this type of enclosure, albeit with less absorbent stuffing. Among the first examples of this enclosure design approach were the projects published in ''[[Wireless World]]'' by Bailey in the early 1970s, and the commercial designs of the now defunct [http://www.imf-electronics.com IMF Electronics] which received critical acclaim at about the same time.

A variation on the transmission line enclosure uses a tapered tube, with the terminus (opening/port) having a smaller area than the throat. The tapering tube can be coiled for lower frequency driver enclosures to reduce the dimensions of the speaker system, resulting in a seashell like appearance. [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] uses similar patented technology on their Wave and Acoustic Waveguide music systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bose.com/controller?event=VIEW_STATIC_PAGE_EVENT&amp;url=/learning/waveguide.jsp|title=Bose - Better Sound Through Research|author=|date=|website=www.bose.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerical simulations by George L. Augspurger and Martin J. King have helped refine the theory and practical design of these systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=12064 ''Loudspeakers on Damped Pipes'']. AES E-Library: Augspurger, George L. JAES Volume 48, Issue 5, pp. 424-436. May 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quarter-wave.com/index.html ''Quarter Wavelength Loudspeaker Design''] by Martin J. King. July 17, 2002 (last revised February 25, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Quarter wave enclosure ===
A quarter wave resonator is a transmission line tuned to form a standing quarter wave at a frequency somewhat below the driver's frequency FS. When properly designed, a port that is of much smaller diameter than the main pipe located at the end of the pipe then produces the driver's backward radiation in phase with the speaker driver itself; greatly adding to the bass output. Such designs tend to be less dominant in certain bass frequencies than the more common bass reflex designs and followers of such designs claim an advantage in clarity of the bass with a better congruency of the fundamental frequencies to the overtones.&lt;ref name="kvart-bolge.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kvart-bolge.com/#!concept/c1w4l|title=Kvart &amp;amp; Bølge - Audiophile Quarter-Wave Full-Range Speakers -|author=|date=|website=Kvart &amp;amp; Bølge - Audiophile Quarter-Wave Full-Range Speakers -}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some loudspeaker designers like Martin J. King and Bjørn Johannessen consider the term "quarter wave enclosure" as a more fitting term for most transmission lines and since acoustically, quarter wavelengths produce standing waves inside the enclosure that are used to produce the bass response emanating from the port. These designs can be considered a mass-loaded transmission line design or a bass reflex design, as well as a quarter wave enclosure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quarter-wave.com |title=Quarter Wavelength Loudspeaker Design |publisher=Quarter-wave.com |date= |accessdate=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quarter wave resonators have seen a revival as commercial applications with the onset of [[neodymium]] drivers that enable this design to produce relatively low bass extensions within a relatively small speaker enclosure.&lt;ref name="kvart-bolge.com"/&gt;

=== Tapered quarter-wave pipe ===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Voigt pipe]] --&gt;
The ''tapered quarter-wave pipe'' (TQWP) is an example of a combination of transmission line and horn effects. It is highly regarded by some speaker designers. The concept is that the sound emitted from the rear of the loudspeaker driver is progressively reflected and absorbed along the length of the tapering tube, almost completely preventing internally reflected sound being retransmitted through the cone of the loudspeaker. The lower part of the pipe acts as a horn while the top can be visualised as an extended compression chamber. The entire pipe can also be seen as a tapered transmission line in inverted form. (A traditional tapered transmission line, confusingly also sometimes referred to as a TQWP, has a smaller mouth area than throat area.) Its relatively low adoption in commercial speakers can mostly be attributed to the large resulting dimensions of the speaker produced and the expense of manufacturing a rigid tapering tube. The TQWP is also known as a [[Voigt pipe]] and was introduced in 1934 by Paul G. A. H. Voigt, Lowther's original driver designer.

'''NABERS''', the '''National Australian Built Environment Rating System''', is an initiative by the government of Australia to measure and compare the [[Environmentally friendly|environmental performance]] of [[Global warming in Australia|Australian]] buildings and tenancies. There are NABERS rating tools for [http://www.nabers.gov.au/public/WebPages/ContentStandard.aspx?module=21&amp;template=2&amp;id=210&amp;include=Dashboard.htm commercial office buildings] to measure [[Greenhouse gas|greenhouse gas emissions]], [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], [[water efficiency]], [[Waste|waste efficiency]] and [[Building science|indoor environment quality]]. There are also energy/greenhouse and water rating tools for [http://www.nabers.gov.au/public/WebPages/ContentStandard.aspx?module=22&amp;template=2&amp;id=211&amp;include=Dashboard.htm hotels], [http://www.nabers.gov.au/public/WebPages/ContentStandard.aspx?module=23&amp;template=2&amp;id=212&amp;include=Dashboard.htm shopping centres] and [http://www.nabers.gov.au/public/WebPages/ContentStandard.aspx?module=27&amp;template=2&amp;id=216&amp;include=Dashboard.htm data centres].

== Accredited Assessors ==
A key feature of the initiative is the use of independent 'Accredited Assessors' to conduct ratings. Assessors are required to attend training, pass an exam and complete two supervised assessments before they receive full accreditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is an Accredited Assessor?|url = http://www.nabers.gov.au/public/WebPages/ContentStandard.aspx?module=30&amp;template=3&amp;include=AccreditAssessor.htm&amp;side=AssessorTertiary.htm|website = www.nabers.gov.au|accessdate = 2016-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there are no formal pre-requisites to attend the training, most Assessors have experience in the building services, property or energy management industries. Building owners and tenants can use the online 'self-assessment' tool, however they cannot promote these results. Only ratings that have been certified by the NABERS National Administrator can be promoted using the NABERS [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/trademark trademark].

== Calculating a rating ==
The vision statement of NABERS is 'To support a more [[sustainable]] [[built environment]] through a relevant, reliable and practical measure of [[building performance]]'.

=== Offices ===
The NABERS tools attempt to provide an [[Accuracy and precision|accurate]] [[measurement]] of how [[Efficiency|efficiently]] building owners and tenants are providing their services ''without penalising them for factors that are beyond their control''. 

For example if the primary service that an [[Office|office building]] owner provides is [[Safety|safe]], [[Light|lit]] and [[comfortable]] office space the NABERS Energy for offices tool would consider how much space is being used, how much energy is being used to supply services to the space, and then statistically adjusts for factors like the climate - which will influence [[Energy conservation|how much energy is used for heating and cooling]].

==== Energy====
To obtain a NABERS Energy for offices rating, consumption data for the building (such as electricity and gas bills) is collected by Accredited Assessors along with data about a number of other aspects of the building such as its size, hours of occupation, climate location and density of occupation. Data requirements are set out in a document called [http://www.nabers.gov.au/public/WebPages/DocumentHandler.ashx?docType=2&amp;id=44&amp;attId=0 'The NABERS Energy and Water for Offices Rules for Collecting and Using Data v.3.0']. This data is then input into the NABERS rating calculator&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Rating calculator – NABERS|url = http://www.nabers.gov.au/public/WebPages/RatingCalculator.aspx?module=40|website = www.nabers.gov.au|accessdate = 2016-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; which statistically adjusts for these factors so that the building can have its consumption fairly [[Benchmarking|benchmarked]] against its peers. The result of this calculation is a star rating on a six star scale, where zero is very poor performance and six is market leading.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nabers.gov.au/public/WebPages/DocumentHandler.ashx?docType=2&amp;id=44&amp;attId=0|title = NABERS Energy and Water for offices - Rules for collecting and using data|date = February 2013|accessdate = 2016-01-09|website = www.nabers.gov.au|publisher = NABERS|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Water ====
The procedure for an office water rating is similar to conducting an office energy rating. The main differences are that it is water rather than energy bills that are used, and some data such as the hours of operation are not required. Unlike office energy ratings, which can either be for the base building, tenancies or whole building, office water ratings are only available for whole buildings.

=== Data centres ===

==== Energy ====
Like NABERS for offices, NABERS Energy for [[Data center|data centres]] has three distinct rating types to reflect the different interests and responsibilities from data centres owners, operators and tenants - Infrastructure (co-location owner), Whole Facility (data centre owner) and IT Equipment (data centre tenant) ratings. The tool is designed to rate the majority of data centres in Australia, provide a direct comparison with other rateable data centres, and allow an individual data centre to measure and compare performance over time.

The NABERS Data Centre IT Equipment Rating is designed for organisations that control and manage their own [[IT]] equipment ([[Server (computing)|servers]], [[Computer Storage|storage]] and [[networking devices]]). The IT Equipment rating measures feastures that are closely related to the primary functions of a data centre ([[Computer performance|processing]], [[Computer data storage|storage]] and [[Computer network|networking]]) and that all data centres provide, regardless of how they provide them. NABERS uses two IT equipment metrics:
* [[Processing power|Processing capacity]]: number of server cores × clock speed in gigahertz (GHz) and
* [[Computer data storage|Storage capacity]] (total unformatted storage capacity in [[terabytes]]).
The NABERS performance benchmark model predicts the industry median [[greenhouse gas]] emissions for a given amount of data centre processing and storage capacity. This means that if a data centre consumes more energy than the benchmark model predicts, the site is less energy efficient than the industry median (set at 3 stars), while if it consumes less energy it is more efficient than the median. 
To obtain a NABERS Energy for data centres IT Equipment rating, [[Energy in Australia|energy consumption]] data for the IT equipment over a 28- to 40-day period is collected by Accredited Assessors along with data about the total unformatted storage capacity and total processing capacity as above.

The Infrastructure Rating measures the [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] in delivering support services to the IT equipment, using the widely accepted industry [[Power usage effectiveness|Power Usage Effectiveness]] (PUE) ratio that is converted into kilogram of emissions with some modification for climate and shared cooling services. To obtain an infrastructure rating, 12 months of energy consumption data for IT equipment and infrastructure services is collected by Accredited Assessors along with the climate location of the data centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nabers.gov.au/public/WebPages/DocumentHandler.ashx?docType=3&amp;id=85&amp;attId=0|title = NABERS Energy for data centres - Rules for collecting and using data|date = |accessdate = 2016-01-09|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Whole Facility rating measures the energy efficiency of the whole data centre by assessing the processing and storage capacity and the industry median energy efficiency for infrastructure services compared with the overall energy consumption of the data centre. It is a combination of both the IT Equipment and Infrastructure rating benchmarks To obtain a NABERS Energy for data centres Whole Facility rating, 12 months of energy consumption data for the data centre is collected by Accredited Assessors along with the processing and storage capacity and climate location of the data centre.

==Comparison to other building rating systems==
There are a number of building environmental certification systems across the world, such as [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]], [[Green Star (Australia)|Green Star]], [[BREEAM|BRE Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM)]] and [[Display Energy Certificate|Display Energy Certificates (DECs)]]. The key features of NABERS as a system are that it is based on performance rather than design, assessments are carried out by third party 'Accredited Assessors', it is based on third party verifiable data (such as utility bills), ratings undergo government quality assurance checks and it distinguishes between the environmental impact of a building's shared services and its tenancies. While other rating systems across the world share some of these features, none share all of them.

== Program Success ==
NABERS Energy for offices is considered by many to have been successful, as over 82% of the Australian national office market has now been rated with either a base building or whole building rating. Factors behind the success of the tool are largely attributed to its ability to differentiate between the base building and tenants energy end uses and strong government support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.buildingrating.org/graphic/australias-nabers-energy-rating-label|title = Australia's NABERS Energy Rating Label|date = 2014-05-01|accessdate = 2016-01-09|website = Building Rating|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Far fewer tenancy energy ratings have been conducted however and there has also been far less uptake of the other tools.

== Use in Australian Energy Programs &amp; Policy ==
While NABERS Energy is a voluntary rating scheme for buildings, its success has been at least partly driven by its extensive use in energy initiatives by government and industry throughout Australia.  Some programs include:

* '''[http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/resources/government/140567NSWGREP.pdf The NSW Government Resource Efficiency Policy (GREP)]:''' The most recent iteration of a series of NSW government procurement policies that set out NABERS targets in government leasing criteria. In the GREP, government tenants require a building to have a 4.5 star NABERS rating. It also states a 4.5 star energy rating as a minimum criteria for government data centres. Similar policies are in place other states and territories, as well as the Australian government (the 'Energy Efficiency in Government Operations' policy).

The '''Nadal formula''', also called '''Nadal's formula''', is an equation in [[railway]] design that relates the downward force exerted by a [[train]]'s wheels upon the rail, with the lateral force of the wheel's flange against the face of the rail. This relationship is significant in railway design, as a [[Derailment#Slow speed derailments|wheel-climb derailment]] may occur if the lateral and vertical forces are not properly considered.&lt;ref name=APTA&gt;[http://www.aptastandards.com/portals/0/press_pdfs/Mechanical/SS-M-015-06%20Wheel%20Flange%20Angle.pdf APTA SS-M-015-06 Standard for wheel flange angle for passenger equipment]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nadal formula is represented by:
&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{L}{V}\right){{=}}\left(\frac{\tan(\delta)-\mu}{1+\mu*\tan(\delta)}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

In this equation, L and V refer to the lateral and vertical forces acting upon the rail and wheel, δ is the angle made when the wheel flange is in contact with the rail face, and μ is the coefficient of friction between the wheel and the rail.&lt;ref name=APTA /&gt;

Typically, the [[axle load]] for a railway vehicle should be such that the lateral forces of the wheel against the rail should not exceed 50% of the vertical down-force of the vehicle on the rail.&lt;ref name=DOT&gt;[http://www.fra.dot.gov/downloads/Counsel/nprm/tssnprm.pdf Federal Register, July 3, 1997]&lt;/ref&gt; Put another way, there should be twice as much downward force holding the wheel to the rail, as there is lateral force which will tend to cause the wheel to climb in turns. This ratio is accomplished by matching the [[Wheelset (rail transport)|wheelset]] with the appropriate [[rail profile]] to achieve the L/V ratio desired. If the L/V ratio gets too high, the wheel flange will be pressing against the rail face, and during a turn this will cause the wheel to climb the face of the rail, potentially derailing the railcar.

==Wagner Formula==

The Nadal formula assumes the wheel remains perpendicular to the rail&amp;mdash;it does not take into account [[hunting oscillation]] of the wheelset, or the movement of the wheel flange contact point against the rail.&lt;ref name="Dukkipati"&gt;{{cite book | last=Dukkipati | first=Rao | title=Vehicle Dynamics | publisher=Narosa Publishing House | year=2000 | isbn=978-81-7319-265-4 | pages=227–228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variation of the Nadal formula, which does take these factors into consideration, is the Wagner formula. As the wheelset yaws relative to the rail, the vertical force V is no longer completely vertical, but is now acting at an angle to the vertical, β. When this angle is factored into the Nadal formula, the result is the Wagner formula:&lt;ref name="Dukkipati" /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{L}{V}\right){{=}}\left(\frac{\tan(\delta)-\mu*\cos\beta}{(1+\mu*\tan(\delta))*\cos\beta)}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

When the vertical force is truly vertical (that is, β=0 and therefore cos(β)=1), the Wagner formula equals the Nadal formula.

In [[romance languages]], '''''nomen à clef''''' or '''''nomen à clé''''' ({{IPA-fr|nomen‿a kle|}}, French for "name with a key"), is a [[name]] describing a real person, behind a façade of [[fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VxFomoeKT74C&amp;pg=PA131&amp;dq=film+%C3%A0+clef&amp;lr=&amp;ei=mFMTS4H2FpCuzQSZ3737DA#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false "The films in my life" By François Truffaut, Da Capo Press, 1994, ISBN 0-306-80599-5, ISBN 978-0-306-80599-8, pg 131]&lt;/ref&gt; "Key" in this context means a table one can use to swap out the names.  
It is the nomenclature complement of the [[roman à clef]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9853">'''Optimal virulence''' is a concept relating to the [[ecology]] of hosts and [[parasite]]s. One definition of [[virulence]] is the host's parasite-induced loss of [[fitness (biology)|fitness]]. The parasite's fitness is determined by its success in transmitting offsprings to other hosts. At one time, the consensus was that over time, virulence moderated and parasitic relationships evolved toward symbiosis. This view has been challenged. A [[pathogen]] that is too restrained will lose out in competition to a more aggressive strain that diverts more host resources to its own reproduction.  However, the host, being the parasite's resource and habitat in a way, suffers from this higher [[virulence]]. This might induce faster host death, and act against the parasite's fitness by reducing probability to encounter another host (killing the host too fast to allow for transmission). Thus, there is a natural force providing pressure on the parasite to "self-limit" virulence. 
The idea is, then, that there exists an equilibrium point of virulence, where parasite's fitness is highest. Any movement on the virulence axis, towards higher or lower virulence, will result in lower fitness for the parasite, and thus will be selected against.

==Mode of transmission==

According to [[evolutionary medicine]], virulence increases with [[horizontal transmission]] (between non-relatives) and decreases with [[vertical transmission]] (from parent to child).[https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/286159]

[[Paul W. Ewald]]  has explored the relationship between virulence and mode of transmission. He came to the conclusion that virulence tends to remain especially high in waterborne and vector-borne infections, such as [[cholera]] and [[Dengue]]. Cholera is spread through sewage and Dengue through [[mosquito]]s. In the case of respiratory infections, the pathogen depends on an ambulatory host to survive. It must spare the host long enough to find a new host. Water- or vector-borne transmission circumvents the need for a mobile host.   Ewald is convinced that the crowding of [[trench warfare]] provided an easy route to transmission that explains the virulence of the [[Spanish flu|1918 influenza pandemic]]. In crowded conditions the time to find a new host is minimal.

Other [[epidemiologist]]s have expanded on the idea of a tradeoff between costs and benefits of virulence. One factor is the time or distance between potential hosts. Airplane travel, crowded [[factory farms]] and [[urbanization]] have all been suggested as possible sources of virulence. Another factor is the presence of multiple infections in a single host leading to increased competition among pathogens. In this scenario, the host can survive only as long as it resists the most virulent strains. The advantage of a low virulence strategy becomes moot.   Multiple infections can also result in gene swapping among pathogens, increasing the likelihood of lethal combinations.

==Evolutionary hypotheses==
There are three main hypotheses about why a pathogen evolves as it does. These three models help to explain the [[life history theory|life history strategies]] of parasites, including reproduction, migration within the host, virulence, etc.  The three hypotheses are the '''Trade-Off Hypothesis''', the '''Short-Sighted Evolution Hypothesis''', and the '''Coincidental Evolution Hypothesis'''. All of these offer [[ultimate causes|ultimate]] explanations for virulence in pathogens.

===Trade-off hypothesis===
At one time, some biologists argued that pathogens would tend to evolve toward ever decreasing virulence because the death of the host (or even serious disability) is ultimately harmful to the pathogen living inside. For example, if the host dies, the pathogen population inside may die out entirely. Therefore, it was believed that less virulent pathogens that allowed the host to move around and interact with other hosts should have greater success reproducing and dispersing.

But this is not necessarily the case. Pathogen strains that kill the host can increase in frequency as long as the pathogen can transmit itself to a new host, whether before or after the host dies. The evolution of virulence in pathogens is a balance between the costs and benefits of virulence to the pathogen.  For example, Mackinnon and Read (2004)&lt;ref name ="Mackinnon and Read 2004"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; studied the malaria parasite using a rodent and chicken model respectively and found that there was trade-off between transmission success and virulence as defined by host mortality.

===Short-sighted evolution hypothesis===
Short-sighted evolution suggests that the traits that increase reproduction rate and transmission to a new host will rise to high frequency within the pathogen population. These traits include the ability to reproduce sooner, reproduce faster, reproduce in higher numbers, live longer, survive against antibodies, or survive in parts of the body the pathogen does not normally infiltrate. These traits typically arise due to mutations, which occur more frequently in pathogen populations than in host populations, due to the pathogens' rapid generation time and immense numbers. After only a few generations, the mutations that enhance rapid reproduction or dispersal will increase in frequency. The same mutations that enhance the reproduction and dispersal of the pathogen also enhance its virulence in the host, causing much harm (disease and death). If the pathogen's virulence kills the host and interferes with its own transmission to a new host, virulence will be selected against. But as long as transmission continues despite the virulence, virulent pathogens will have the advantage. So, for example, virulence often increases within families, where transmission from one host to the next is likely, no matter how sick the host. Similarly, in crowded conditions such as refugee camps, virulence tends to increase over time since new hosts cannot escape the likelihood of infection.

===Coincidental evolution hypothesis===
Some forms of pathogenic virulence did not co-evolve with the host. For example, [[tetanus]] is caused by the soil bacterium ''[[Clostridium tetani]]''. After ''C. tetani'' bacteria enter a human wound, the bacteria may grow and divide rapidly, even though the human body is not their normal habitat.  While dividing, ''C. tetani'' produce a neurotoxin that is lethal to humans. But it is selection in the bacterium's normal life cycle in the soil that leads it to produce this toxin, not any evolution with a human host. The bacterium finds itself inside a human instead of in the soil by mere [[wikt:happenstance|happenstance]]. We can say that the neurotoxin is not directed at the human host.

More generally, the virulence of many pathogens in humans may not be a target of selection itself, but rather an accidental by-product of selection that operates on other traits, as is the case with [[antagonistic pleiotropy]]

==Expansion into new environments==
A potential for virulence exists whenever a pathogen invades a new environment, host or tissue.  The new host is likely to be poorly adapted to the intruder, either because it has not built up an immunological defense or because of a fortuitous vulnerability.  In times of change, natural selection favors mutations that exploit the new host more effectively than the founder strain, providing an opportunity for virulence to erupt.

==Host susceptibility== 
Host susceptibility contributes to virulence.  Once transmission occurs, the pathogen must establish an infection to continue. The more competent the host immune system, the less chance there is for the parasite to survive. It may require multiple transmission events to find a suitably vulnerable host. During this time, the invader is dependent upon the survival of its current host. For this reason virulence thrives in a community with prevalent [[immune]] dysfunction and poor nutrition. Virulence weakens in a healthy population and as hosts acquire resistance. Good [[hygiene]], [[nutrition]] and [[sanitation]] are all effective strategies against virulence.

'''''Orator''''' was written by [[Marcus Tullius Cicero]] in the latter part of the year 46 B.C.&lt;ref&gt;Tempest, Kathryn. "Prologue." In Cicero: politics and persuasion in ancient Rome. London: Continuum, 2011. 1-7.&lt;/ref&gt; It is his last work on [[rhetoric]], three years before his death.&lt;ref name="Hendrickson"&gt;Cicero, Marcus Tullius, and George L. Hendrickson. Brutus Orator / Cicero. With an English transl. by H.M. Hubbell.. Rev. and repr. ed. London: Heinemann [u.a.], 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; Describing rhetoric, Cicero addresses previous comments on the five canons of rhetoric: [[Inventio]], [[Dispositio]], [[Elocutio]], [[Memoria]], and [[Pronuntiatio]]. In this text, Cicero attempts to describe the perfect orator, in response to [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Marcus Junius Brutus]]’ request. ''Orator'' is the continuation of a debate between [[Brutus]] and [[Cicero]], which originated in his text ''[[Brutus (Cicero)|Brutus]]'', written earlier in the same year. 

The oldest partial text of ''Orator'' was recovered in the monastery of [[Mont Saint-Michel]] and now is located in the library at [[Avranches]].&lt;ref&gt;Hendrickson, G. L. . "Cicero's Correspondence with Brutus and Calvus on Oratorical 	Style ." ''The American Journal of Philology'' 47, no. 3 (1926): 237-238.&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty-seven existing manuscripts have been discovered from this text. Another complete text was discovered in 1421, near [[Milan]] in the town of [[Lodi, Lombardy|Lodi]]. These two texts vary considerably between the two manuscripts and modern translators rely on both. 

In 46. B.C, when Cicero wrote ''Orator'', many young Roman men revolted against the stylistic paradigms put forward by Cicero, and from most Roman traditions in general.&lt;ref name="Hendrickson" /&gt; Cicero writes in a defensive posture to this hostile audience.

==Context and summary==
In ''Orator'', Cicero depicts several models for speakers. Cicero states to the Romans the importance of searching and discovering their own sense of [[rhetoric]]. “I am sure, the magnificence of [[Plato]] did not deter [[Aristotle]] from writing, nor did [[Aristotle]] with all his marvelous breadth of knowledge put an end to the studies of others” &lt;ref name= "Cicero"&gt;Cicero, Marcus Tullius, and B White. Cicero's Brutus, or history of famous orators: 	also, his Orator, or accomplished speaker. Now first translated into English, by E. Jones. London: Printed for B. White, 1776.&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero encouraged the [[plebeians]] through his writing, “Moreover, not only were outstanding men not deterred from undertaking [[Liberal arts education|liberal]] pursuits, but even craftsmen did not give up their arts because they were unable to equal the beauty of the picture of Ialysus . . . .”&lt;ref name= "Cicero" /&gt; Cicero proposes that rhetoric cannot be confined to one specific group but rather outlines a guide that will lead to the creation of successful orators across Roman society.&lt;ref name="Hendrickson" /&gt;

In ''Orator'', Cicero also addressed the accusation lodged by his fellow senators, including [[Brutus]], that he was an “[[Atticism|Atticist]].” Cicero addresses this claim by saying that he is too independent and bold to be associated with [[Atticism]], producing his own unique style. Cicero claims the perfect orator creates his own “[[elocutio]],” or diction and style, rather than following this movement.&lt;ref name="Hendrickson" /&gt;
	Cicero states that all five canons are equally important. Throughout the text, Cicero advises his Roman audience on how to form proper oratory by formal guidelines but also how to specialize in individually in their own sense of oratory. ''Orator'' is written with ideas ranging from the construction of arguments to rhetorical performance. In relation to other Ciceronian works on rhetoric, Orator receives less treatment with scarce research compared to other rhetorical works.

==Goals of the Orator==
The three aims of the orator, according to Cicero, are "''docere, delectare, et movere''."  That is: to prove your thesis to the audience, to delight the audience, and to emotionally move the audience.&lt;ref name="clark"&gt;{{cite web|last=Clark|first=Donald|title=Rhetoric and Poetry in the Renaissance|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/10140/10140-h/10140-h.htm|publisher=Distributed Proofreaders|accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emotional vividness of poetic language becomes part of the rhetorical tools in service of persuading the audience to your point of view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cicero|first=Marcus Tullius|title=Orator|url=http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cicero/orator.shtml#69|accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It promotes the use of such measures for more effective poverty eradication efforts at the global, national and local levels.

==About==

OPHI aims to build and advance a more systematic methodological and economic framework for reducing multidimensional poverty, grounded in people’s experiences and values. OPHI works towards this by:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ophi.org.uk/about/ |title=Oxford Poverty &amp; Human Development Initiative |accessdate=2013-05-21 |quote=OPHI aims to build and advance a more systematic methodological and economic framework for reducing multidimensional poverty, grounded in people’s experiences and values. OPHI works towards this by. |publisher=Oxford Poverty &amp; Human Development Initiative }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Broadening poverty measurement.''' OPHI develops and implements multi-dimensional measures of poverty, wellbeing and inequality. These measures go beyond traditional one-dimensional approaches to incorporate dimensions such as health, education, living standards, quality of work and more innovative dimensions.
* '''Improving data on poverty.''' OPHI has developed tools to measure five missing dimensions of poverty data that poor people value but which have been largely overlooked in international studies of poverty to date: Quality of Work, Empowerment, Physical Safety, The Ability to go About Without Shame and Psychological Wellbeing.
* '''Building capacity.''' OPHI runs academic courses and technical training programmes on multidimensional poverty and human development, and collaborates with universities, development agencies, governments and other research institutions and policy makers using our work.
* '''Impacting policy.''' OPHI’s methodologies have been adopted by policy makers, including national governments and the United Nations Development Programme Human Development Report.

OPHI’s work is grounded in [[Amartya Sen]]’s capability approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ophi.org.uk/about/ |title=Oxford Poverty &amp; Human Development Initiative |accessdate=2013-05-21 |quote=OPHI’s work is grounded in Amartya Sen’s capability approach. |publisher=Oxford Poverty &amp; Human Development Initiative }}&lt;/ref&gt; OPHI works to implement this approach by creating real tools that inform policies to reduce poverty.
OPHI’s team members are involved in a wide range of activities and collaborations around the world, including survey design and testing, quantitative and qualitative data collection, training and mentoring, and advising policy makers.

==Missing Dimensions of Poverty==

Money alone is an incomplete measure of ‘poverty’. Human development is more about giving people the opportunities to live lives they value, and enable them to achieve their own destiny. This goes beyond material resources – as people value many other aspects of life – and also focuses on what people are able to be and to do.
OPHI has identified five ‘Missing Dimensions’ of poverty that deprived people cite as important in their experiences of poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ophi.org.uk/research/missing-dimensions/ |title=Oxford Poverty &amp; Human Development Initiative |accessdate=2013-05-21 |quote=OPHI has identified five ‘Missing Dimensions’ of poverty that deprived people cite as important in their experiences of poverty. |publisher=Oxford Poverty &amp; Human Development Initiative }}&lt;/ref&gt; To call attention to these ‘missing dimensions’, and to use them as a guide to policy, better data are needed.

'''Objective'''

OPHI promotes collection and analysis of data on five ‘missing dimensions’ of poverty:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ophi.org.uk/research/missing-dimensions/ |title=Oxford Poverty &amp; Human Development Initiative |accessdate=2013-05-21 |quote=OPHI promotes collection and analysis of data on five ‘missing dimensions’ of poverty |publisher=Oxford Poverty &amp; Human Development Initiative }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [http://www.ophi.org.uk/research/missing-dimensions/psychological-wellbeing Psychological wellbeing]

To date, these dimensions have been largely overlooked in large-scale quantitative work on poverty and human development. OPHI has designed five short, 8-10 minute questionnaire modules that can be integrated into national household surveys to obtain these data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ophi.org.uk/research/missing-dimensions/ |title=Oxford Poverty &amp; Human Development Initiative |accessdate=2013-05-21 |quote= OPHI has designed [http://www.ophi.org.uk/research/missing-dimensions/survey-modules/ five short, 8-10 minute questionnaire modules] that can be integrated into national household surveys to obtain these data.|publisher=Oxford Poverty &amp; Human Development Initiative }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Criteria'''

The following criteria were used to identify suitable indicators for inclusion in individual or household surveys.

* The indicators need to be internationally comparable.
* They should assess both the instrumental and the intrinsic aspects of each dimension.
* They must enable identification of changes in the missing dimensions over time.
* They should draw on previous experience of particular indicators; notably we tried to use indicators that had been previously fielded and found to be ‘adequate’ measures for research purposes.

'''Progress to date'''

OPHI has ongoing collaboration with teams around the world to test and improve the modules and to produce new data and qualitative and quantitative analyses on the missing dimensions. Currently, OPHI and partners are fielding a nationally representative survey in Chad, and the first nationally representative dataset and analyses were conducted in Chile. Projects have also be conducted in Philippines, Nigeria and Sri Lanka, plus a first smaller project in Chad. You can read about OPHI's projects on the Missing Dimensions [http://www.ophi.org.uk/research/missing-dimensions/projects/ here].

==Multidimensional Poverty==
{{Development economics sidebar}}
Most countries of the world define poverty by income. Yet poor people themselves define their poverty much more broadly, to include lack of education, health, housing, empowerment, humiliation, employment, personal security and more. No one indicator, such as income, is uniquely able to capture the multiple aspects that contribute to poverty.
Multidimensional poverty encompasses a range of deprivations that a household may suffer. The number of indicators and specific indicators used depend on the purpose of the measure. Common purposes include national poverty measures that reflect changes over time, targeting of services or conditional cash transfers and monitoring and evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Multidimensional Poverty|url=http://www.ophi.org.uk/research/multidimensional-poverty/|publisher=Oxford Poverty &amp; Human Development Initiative (OPHI)|accessdate=21 May 2013|quote=Common purposes include national poverty measures that reflect changes over time, targeting of services or conditional cash transfers and monitoring and evaluation.}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a glance, multidimensional measures present an integrated view of the situation. We can also examine poverty by population group, or study the composition of deprivation for different groups. Multidimensional metrics are rigorous, easy to use, flexible, and adaptable to different contexts. OPHI has developed a methodology for measuring multidimensional poverty known as the [http://www.ophi.org.uk/research/multidimensional-poverty/alkire-foster-method/ Alkire Foster (AF) method]. OPHI researchers apply the AF method and related multidimensional measures  [http://www.mppn.org/ to a range of different countries and contexts]. Their analyses span a number of different topics, such as changes in multidimensional poverty over time, comparisons in rural and urban poverty, and inequality among the poor. For more information on OPHI’s research, see their [http://www.ophi.org.uk/resources/ophi-working-papers/ working paper series] and [http://www.ophi.org.uk/resources/briefing-documents/ research briefs].

==Alkire Foster Method==

[[Sabina Alkire]] and [[James Foster (economist)|James Foster]] created a new method for measuring multidimensional poverty. It includes identifying ‘who is poor’ by considering the range of deprivations they suffer, and aggregating that information to reflect societal poverty in a way that is robust and decomposable.

Contemporary methods of measuring poverty and wellbeing commonly generate a statistic for the percentage of the population who are poor, a head count (H). The Alkire Foster Method generates a headcount and also a unique class of poverty measures (Mα):

'''M0:''' An ‘adjusted head count’. This reflects both the incidence (the percentage of the population who are poor) and intensity of poverty (the number of deprivations suffered by each household, A). It is calculated by multiplying the proportion of people who are poor by the percentage of dimensions in which they are deprived (M0 = H x A).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alkire Foster Method|url=http://www.ophi.org.uk/research/multidimensional-poverty/alkire-foster-method/|publisher=Oxford Poverty &amp; Human Development Initiative (OPHI)|accessdate=21 May 2013|quote=M0 An ‘adjusted head count’. This reflects both the incidence (the percentage of the population who are poor) and intensity of poverty (the number of deprivations suffered by each household, A). It is calculated by multiplying the proportion of people who are poor by the percentage of dimensions in which they are deprived (M0 = H x A).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''M1:''' This measure reflects the incidence, intensity and depth of poverty.

Cardinal data are required to calculate M1 and M2.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alkire Foster Method is unique in that it can distinguish between, for example, a group of poor people who suffer only one deprivation on average and a group of poor people who suffer three deprivations on average at the same time.

This flexible approach can be employed in a variety of situations by choosing different dimensions (e.g. education), indicators (e.g. how many years of education a person has) and cutoffs (e.g. a person with fewer than five years of education is considered deprived).

'''Common Uses of the Alkire Foster Method'''

* Poverty measures. The Alkire Foster method can be used to create national, regional or international measures of poverty or wellbeing by incorporating dimensions and indicators that are tailored to the specific context.
* Targeting of services or conditional cash transfers. The Alkire Foster method can be used to target people who meet multiple criteria.
* Monitoring and evaluation. The Alkire Foster method can be used to monitor the effectiveness of programmes over time.

'''Why the Alkire Foster Method is Useful'''

The Alkire Foster method is a single societal poverty measure, but it can be broken down and analysed in a powerful way to inform policy. It can be used to:

* '''Break down by population group'''. the measure can be broken down (decomposed) by geographic area, ethnicity, or other groups, to show the composition of poverty within and among the groups.
* '''Break down by dimension/indicator'''. the measure can be broken down (decomposed) after identification to show which deprivations are driving poverty among and within groups.
* '''Compare across time'''. the measure can be used to monitor changes in poverty and the composition of poverty over time using time series or panel data. The Alkire Foster method reflects other dimensions directly and changes immediately as these change. This makes it an effective monitoring tool because improvements in the dimensions measured, such as health and education, are reflected quickly.
* '''Target''' the poorest groups and beneficiaries of conditional cash transfers, district interventions or public programmes. The targeting tool can be broken down to show the indicators in which they are most deprived.
* '''Complement''' other metrics. The Alkire Foster Method can complement other measures, such as income poverty.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4778">The '''Plummer model''' or '''Plummer sphere''' is a density law that was first used by [[Henry Crozier Keating Plummer|H. C. Plummer]] to fit observations of [[globular cluster]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Plummer, H. C. (1911), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1911MNRAS..71..460P On the problem of distribution in globular star clusters], ''[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc.]]'' '''71''', 460&lt;/ref&gt; It is now often used as [[toy model]] in [[N-body simulation]]s of stellar systems.

== Description of the model ==
[[Image:Plummer rho.png|thumb|right|220px|The density law of a Plummer model]]

The Plummer 3-dimensional density profile is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\rho_P(r) = \bigg(\frac{3M}{4\pi a^3}\bigg)\bigg(1+\frac{r^2}{a^2}\bigg)^{-\frac{5}{2}}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''M'' is the total mass of the cluster, and ''a'' is the '''Plummer radius''', a scale parameter which sets the size of the cluster core. The corresponding potential is

:&lt;math&gt; \Phi_P(r) = -\frac{G M}{\sqrt{r^2+a^2}}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''G'' is [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s [[gravitational constant]]. The velocity dispersion is

:&lt;math&gt; \sigma_P^2(r) = \frac{G M}{6\sqrt{r^2+a^2}}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The distribution function is 

:&lt;math&gt; f(\vec{x},\vec{v}) = \frac{24\sqrt{2}}{7\pi^3} \frac{N a^2}{G^5 M^5} (-E(\vec{x},\vec{v}))^{7/2}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

if &lt;math&gt;E&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; f(\vec{x},\vec{v}) = 0&lt;/math&gt; otherwise, where &lt;math&gt;E(\vec{x},\vec{v})=\frac12 v^2 + \Phi_P(r)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[specific energy]].

== Properties ==

The mass enclosed within radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is given by 
:&lt;math&gt;M(&lt;r) = 4\pi\int_0^r r^2 \rho_P(r) dr = M{r^3\over\left(r^2+a^2\right)^{3/2}}&lt;/math&gt;.

Many other properties of the Plummer model are described in [[Herwig Dejonghe]]'s comprehensive paper.&lt;ref&gt;Dejonghe, H. (1987), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1987MNRAS.224...13D A completely analytical family of anisotropic Plummer models]. ''[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc.]]'' '''224''', 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Core radius &lt;math&gt;r_c&lt;/math&gt;, where the surface density drops to half its central value, is at &lt;math&gt;r_c =a\sqrt{\sqrt{2}-1}\approx0.64a&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Half-mass radius]] is &lt;math&gt;r_h \approx 1.3 a&lt;/math&gt;

[[Virial Theorem#Galaxies and cosmology (virial mass and radius)|Virial radius]] is &lt;math&gt;r_V = \frac{16}{3 \pi} a \approx 1.7 a&lt;/math&gt;

The radial turning points of an orbit characterized by [[specific energy]] &lt;math&gt;E=\frac{1}{2} v^2 + \Phi(r)&lt;/math&gt; and [[specific relative angular momentum|specific angular momentum]] &lt;math&gt;L=|\vec{r}\times\vec{v}|&lt;/math&gt; are given by the positive roots of the [[cubic function|cubic equation]]

:&lt;math&gt;R^3 + \frac{GM}{E}R^2 - \left(\frac{L^2}{2E} + a^2 \right) R - \frac{GMa^2}{E} = 0  &lt;/math&gt;.

where &lt;math&gt;R=\sqrt{r^2+a^2}&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;r=\sqrt{R^2-a^2}&lt;/math&gt;. This equation has three real roots for &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, two positive and one negative given that &lt;math&gt;L&lt;L_c(E)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;L_c(E)&lt;/math&gt; is the specific angular momentum for a circular orbit for the same energy. Here &lt;math&gt;L_c&lt;/math&gt; can be calculated from single real root of the [[Cubic function #The discriminant|discriminant of the cubic equation]] which is itself another [[cubic function|cubic equation]]

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{E}\, \underline{L}_c^3 + \left(6 \underline{E}^2 \underline{a}^2 + \frac{1}{2}\right)\underline{L}_c^2 + \left(12 \underline{E}^3 \underline{a}^4 + 20 \underline{E} \underline{a}^2 \right) \underline{L}_c + \left(8 \underline{E}^4 \underline{a}^6 - 16 \underline{E}^2 \underline{a}^4 + 8 \underline{a}^2\right) = 0  &lt;/math&gt;

where underlined parameters are dimensionless in Henon units defined as &lt;math&gt;\underline{E}=Er_V/(GM)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\underline{L}_c = L_c / \sqrt{G\, M\, r_V}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\underline{a} = a / r_V = 3\pi/16&lt;/math&gt;.

== Applications ==
The Plummer model comes closest to representing the observed density profiles of [[star clusters]]{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}, although the rapid falloff of the density at large radii (&lt;math&gt;\rho\rightarrow r^{-5}&lt;/math&gt;) is not a good description of these systems.

The behavior of the density near the center does not match observations of elliptical galaxies, which typically exhibit a diverging central density.

The ease with which the Plummer sphere can be realized as a [[Monte Carlo method|Monte-Carlo model]] has made it a favorite choice of [[N-body simulation|N-body experimenters]], in spite of the model's lack of realism.&lt;ref&gt;Aarseth, S. J., Henon, M. and Wielen, R. (1974), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1974A%26A....37..183A A comparison of numerical methods for the study of star cluster dynamics.] ''[[Astronomy and Astrophysics]]'' '''37''' 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10417">[[File:Amore e Psiche,Canova (1757-1822), Retro.JPG|thumb|right|Rear view of the [[Louvre]]'s prime version of [[Antonio Canova]]'s ''[[Psyche Revived by Cupid's Kiss]]'', 1793]]
In the [[art world]], if an artwork exists in several versions, the one known or believed to be the earliest is called the '''prime version'''.&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen (2001), 21&lt;/ref&gt;   Many artworks produced in media such as [[painting]] or carved [[sculpture]] which create unique objects are in fact repeated by their artists, often several times.  It is regarded as a matter of some importance both by [[art historian]]s and the art market to establish which version has "priority", that is to say was the original work.  The presumption usually is that the prime version is the finest, and perhaps the most carefully done, though some later versions can be argued to improve on the originals.  

In many periods the later "repetitions" were often produced by the workshop of the master, with varying degrees of supervision and direct attention from him.  This was especially the case with official portraits of monarchs and politicians, which in the Early Modern period were often ordered in large numbers of versions from the court artist as [[diplomatic gift]]s.  Sometimes "reduced versions" that are considerably smaller than the prime one are made. 

==Contexts==
[[File:Pope Julius II.jpg|thumb|left|The London version of ''[[Portrait of Pope Julius II (Raphael)|Portrait of Pope Julius II]]'' by [[Raphael]], 1511–12, recognized since 1970 as the prime version]]

In the case of official portraits the later creation of replica versions was likely to have been anticipated from the start, as in other types of art such as [[printmaking]], but in other types of painting, especially [[history painting]], the normal presumption, in the past as today, was that each work was a unique creation.  This was a matter of some importance to the owner, and there was evidently in some periods a general understanding that a work should not be replicated or copied without the permission of the owner of the prime version, which needed to be asked for carefully and was not always given.  In many periods "replicas were the direct product of collecting, as collectors have always preferred recognizable masterpieces to what is offbeat".&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen (2001), 21&lt;/ref&gt;  

This was true of 17th century Rome, where artists such as [[Orazio Gentileschi]] and [[Bernardo Strozzi]] routinely made replicas, and others such as [[Guercino]] and [[Guido Reni]] sometimes did,&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen (2001), 20-27&lt;/ref&gt; as of Victorian London, where artists such as [[William Powell Frith]] often painted one or more replica versions of their successes.  In Frith's case the replicas were painted many years after his first versions, when his newer work was achieving less success.  The French painter {{Interlanguage link multi|Charles Landelle|fr}} recorded no fewer than 32 versions of his ''Femme Fellah'', an [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] hit at the [[Paris Salon]] of 1866.&lt;ref&gt;Harding, 9&lt;/ref&gt;  Pieces of sculpture made by [[casting]] processes that allow the original model to be reproduced several times are rather different; though the first in an edition (today often kept by the artist) has some added prestige, it is expected that a number of versions will be made.

[[File:Aeneas' Flight from Troy by Federico Barocci.jpg|thumb|''Aeneas' Flight from Troy by [[Federico Barocci]]'', image of the replica version in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/47.100.1023|title=Agostino Carracci after Federico Barocci: Aeneas and His Family Fleeing Troy (47.100.1023) - Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History - The Metropolitan Museum of Art|publisher=|accessdate=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
An example of a work now only known from a replica (in the [[Galleria Borghese]] in Rome) and studies is ''[[Aeneas]] and his Family Fleeing Troy'', the only secular [[history painting]] by [[Federico Barocci]]. The prime version was given in 1586 by [[Francesco Maria II della Rovere, Duke of Urbino|Francesco Maria II]], the last [[Duke of Urbino]], to [[Rudolph II, Holy Roman Emperor]] in Prague, and was later looted by the Swedes. It was taken to Rome by Queen [[Christina of Sweden]], passed to the [[Orleans collection]] in Paris, and finally sold at auction in London for 14 guineas in 1800 (the price probably reflecting the poor condition some sources mention), since when its whereabouts are unknown.  The Rome version was painted in 1598, presumably for Cardinal [[Scipio Borghese]].&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Nicholas, ''Federico Barocci'', 2000, Vilo (109)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judging the prime version==
In some cases it is evident which version of a work is prime, especially if there is a full [[provenance]] including a contract or other documentation of the original commission; a contract for a copy will normally make that clear.  Otherwise experts will look both at the overall quality of the work, and also technical elements such as detailed [[underdrawing]] and [[pentimenti]] (changes of mind) that indicate that the artist was finalizing his idea of the work as he proceeded. [[Infrared]] and [[X-ray]] photography are among the scientific techniques that may help in discovering these technical issues.&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen (1986), 436-438, and 432, provide examples of such discussions, relating to various paintings by Caravaggio&lt;/ref&gt;  Close comparison with the evolving style of other works by the artist and the comparison, ideally physically side by side, between two rival versions will often lead to a clear conclusion,&lt;ref&gt;Millar&lt;/ref&gt; but sometimes arguments between experts may take decades to reach a conclusion, as with other issues of attribution.  

One of the most dramatic reassessments in recent decades, of a very important work, came  in 1970 when a new assessment of a version of the ''[[Portrait of Pope Julius II (Raphael)|Portrait of Pope Julius II]]'' by [[Raphael]] drew on a combination of new scientific research and archival knowledge, as x-rays revealed an inventory number from 1693, as well as a background that Raphael had repainted.  The version in the [[Uffizi Gallery]] in [[Florence]], previously considered prime, was replaced by the version in the [[National Gallery, London]], previously considered a replica.&lt;ref&gt;Dunkerton and Roy, 757-759, which reports further testing modifying the earlier conclusions of Gould, 208-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

{{Sociology}}
'''Public sociology''' is a subfield of the wider [[Sociology|sociological discipline]] that emphasizes expanding the disciplinary boundaries of sociology in order to engage with non-academic audiences. It is perhaps best understood as a ''style'' of sociology rather than a particular [[Scientific method|method]], [[theory]], or set of [[politics|political]] values. Since the twenty-first century, the term has been widely associated with [[University of California, Berkeley]] sociologist [[Michael Burawoy]], who delivered an impassioned call for a disciplinary embrace of public sociology in his 2004 [[American Sociological Association]] (ASA) presidential address.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In his address, Burawoy contrasts public sociology with what he terms "professional sociology", a form of sociology that is concerned primarily with addressing other academic sociologists.

Burawoy and other advocates of public sociology encourage the discipline to engage with issues that are of significant public and political concern. These include debates over public policy, political [[activism]], the purposes of [[social movements]], and the institutions of [[civil society]]. If public sociology is considered to be a "movement" within the discipline, it is one that aims to revitalize the discipline of sociology by leveraging its [[empirical]] methods and theoretical insights to contribute to debates not just about ''what is'' or ''what has been'' in society, but about what society ''might yet be''. Thus, many versions of public sociology have had an undeniably [[Norm (sociology)|normative]]&lt;ref&gt;Hanemaayer, A., &amp; Schneider, C.J. (eds) (2014).

==History==
The term "public sociology" was first introduced by [[Herbert Gans]] in his 1988 ASA presidential address, "Sociology in America: The Discipline and the Public".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gans|first=Herbert J.|date=1989-01-01|title=Sociology in America: The Discipline and the Public American Sociological Association, 1988 Presidential Address|jstor=2095658|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=54|issue=1|pages=1|doi=10.2307/2095658}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Gans, primary examples of public sociologists included [[David Riesman]], author of ''The Lonely Crowd'' (one of the best-selling books of sociology ever to be written), and [[Robert Bellah]], the lead author of another best-selling work, ''Habits of the Heart''. In 2000 (four years before Burawoy's ASA address), sociologist [[Ben Agger]] wrote the book ''Public Sociology: From Social Facts to Literary Acts,'' which called for a sociology that addressed major public issues.

However, the [[Northwestern University]] race scholar [[Aldon Morris]] argues in his book ''The Scholar Denied: W. E. B. Du Bois and the Birth of Modern Sociology'' (2015) that [[W. E. B. Du Bois|W. E .B. Du Bois]] was practicing public sociology long before the term was incorporated into the mainstream disciplinary vocabulary, and that [[scientific racism]] prevented Du Bois' contributions from being recognized by the discipline for nearly a century.

Morris argues that Du Bois built the first actual scientific department of sociology during his tenure at [[Atlanta University]], a historically black college, predating the "scientific revolution" of the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago school]] (who are often credited with turning sociology into a rigorous, empirical social science).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Scholar Denied: W. E. B. Du Bois and the Birth of Modern Sociology|last=Morris|first=Aldon|publisher=University of California Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://userpages.umbc.edu/~lutters/pubs/1996_SWLNote96-1_Lutters,Ackerman.pdf|title=An Introduction to the Chicago School of Sociology|last=Lutters|first=Wayne G.|last2=Ackerman|first2=Mark S.|date=1996|website=|publisher=University of Maryland, Baltimore County|access-date=April 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; To Du Bois, robust empirical sociological research was necessary in order to emancipate American blacks from the tyrannies and oppressions built into the racist fabric of American society. Through thorough [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]] research, Du Bois sought to dismantle and delegitimize [[Social Darwinism|social Darwinist]], biological, and cultural deficiency explanations for racial inequality, which were ''not'' grounded in empirical evidence, but relied on grand [[Deductive reasoning|deductive]] narratives that had no basis in scientific analysis.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Du Bois and his colleagues made use of the scientific method and robust empirical inquiry with the dual goal of turning sociology into a ''real'' social science committed to empirical investigation, and using their findings to liberate, empower, and emancipate American blacks from the violence of racist oppression.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Thus, long before Gans or Burawoy began emphasizing the virtues of public sociology, Du Bois had been serving a marginalized public through his scholarly research, failing to receive credit where credit was due.

Debates over public sociology have rekindled questions concerning the extra-academic ''purpose'' of [[sociology]]. Public sociology raises questions about what sociology is and what its goals ought to (or even could) be. Such debates (over science and political advocacy, scholarship and public commitment) have a long history in American sociology and in American social science more generally. Historian Mark C. Smith, for instance, has investigated earlier debates over the purpose of social science in his book ''Social Science in the Crucible: The American Debate over Objectivity and Purpose,1918-1941'' (1994), while Stephen P. Turner and Jonathan H. Turner argue in their book, ''The Impossible Science: An Institutional Analysis of American Sociology'' (1990), that sociology's search for purpose, through dependence on external publics, has limited the discipline's potential.

==Today==
While there is no one definition of public sociology, the term has come to be widely associated with Burawoy's particular perspective of sociology.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; An excerpt from Burawoy's 2004 ASA presidential address provides a succinct summary of his understanding of the term: &lt;blockquote&gt;"As mirror and conscience of society, sociology must define, promote and inform public debate about deepening [[Social class|class]] and racial inequalities, new gender regimes, [[environmental degradation]], [[market fundamentalism]], state and non-state violence. I believe that the world needs public sociology - a sociology that transcends the academy - more than ever. Our potential publics are multiple, ranging from [[Mass media|media]] audiences to policy makers, from silenced minorities to social movements. They are local, global, and national. As public sociology stimulates debate in all these contexts, it inspires and revitalizes our discipline. In return, theory and research give legitimacy, direction, and substance to public sociology. Teaching is equally central to public sociology: students are our first public for they carry sociology into all walks of life. Finally, the critical imagination, exposing the gap between what is and what could be, infuses values into public sociology to remind us that the world could be different."&lt;ref&gt;Burawoy, M. 2004 American Sociological Association Presidential address: For public sociology. ''American Sociological Review'', 2005, Vol. 70, Issue 1, 4-28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Elsewhere, Burawoy has articulated a vision of public sociology that is consonant with the pursuit of [[democratic socialism]]. In ''Critical Sociology'', Burawoy writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;"We might say that critical engagement with real [[utopias]] is today an integral part of the project of sociological socialism. It is a vision of socialism that places human society, or social humanity at its organizing center, a vision that was central to [[Karl Marx|Marx]] but that was too often lost before it was again picked up by Gramsci and Polanyi. If public sociology is to have a progressive impact it will have to hold itself continuously accountable to some such vision of democratic socialism."&lt;ref&gt;Burawoy, Michael: "The Critical Turn to Public Sociology", ''Critical Sociology'', Summer 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;As [[Mark D. Jacobs]] and [[Amy Best]] write, "The mission of public sociology, in Michael Burawoy’s formulation, is to strengthen the institutions of civil society against the encroachments of both state and market."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asanet.org/footnotes/mayjun08/mason.html|title=Footnotes--May/June 2008 Issue--George Mason Introduces New PhD Program in Public Sociology|website=www.asanet.org|access-date=2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Burawoy maintains that, since the last half of the twentieth century and into the twenty first, the political stance of sociology has drifted more [[Left-wing politics|leftward]], while the all encompassing influence of [[neoliberalism]] has dragged the rest of world more [[Right-wing politics|rightward]]. In the aftermath of [[Reaganomics]], the state and market have begun to work in collusion to propagate the ideals of market fundamentalism, replacing the state's role in redistributing resources and providing social welfare services, to one of creating economic opportunities for enterprise. In his view, this will have devastating consequences for civil society, the very subject of sociology itself, unless the discipline embraces his call to unashamedly engage with the world's diverse (and at-risk) publics to achieve some greater good, thus resisting the perverse allure of neoliberalism. One example of this can be seen in the vast increase in adjunct professors in universities and the impact that has had on the inability of professors to publish articles that would give them credence in the eyes of not only publics but also within the discipline itself.

Even in the face of such adversity, many sociologists remain optimistic about the potential latent within sociology to develop an alternative paradigm to the market fundamentalism at the heart of Burawoy's critique. The sociological discipline is dynamic and ever changing, and has a long history of incorporating new theoretical and empirical insights into its analyses, often with the goal of empowering marginalized publics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Little|first1=Daniel|title=Understanding Society|journal=Sociology as a Social Science Discipline|date=November 9, 2007|pages=1|url=http://understandingsociety.blogspot.ca/2007/11/sociology-as-social-science-discipline.html|accessdate=November 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the sociology of work has evolved from processes of adaptation to the study of domination and [[Labour movement|labor movements]]; the concepts of [[Social stratification|stratification theory]] have shifted from the study of mobility within a hierarchy of occupational prestige, to the examination of changing structures of social and economic inequality along the axes of class, race and gender; the sociology of race has moved from theories of [[Assimilation (sociology)|assimilation]], to those of [[political economy]], to the study of [[Racial formation theory|racial formations]]; and social theory has allowed, and introduced, more radical interpretations of canonical figures such as [[Max Weber]], [[Émile Durkheim|Emile Durkheim]], and [[Karl Marx]],{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} and has incorporated "[[Subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern]]" subfields, such as [[feminism]] and [[ethnic studies]], which have had a significant impact on the discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Public Sociology: Fifteen Eminent Sociologists Debate Politics and the Profession in the Twenty-first Century|last=Glenn|first=Evelyn Nakano|publisher=University of California Press|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=213–230|chapter=Whose Public Sociology?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologists have not been alone in debating the public role of social science. Similar debates have occurred recently in the disciplines of [[economics]], [[political science]], [[anthropology]], [[geography]] and [[history]], and various sub-disciplines, including [[political ecology]]. In an effort to move these various disciplines "toward a more public social science", [[Craig Calhoun]], the President of the [[Social Science Research Council]], has encouraged sociologists and other social scientists to "ask better social science questions about what encourages [[scientific]] innovation, what makes [[knowledge]] useful, and how to pursue both these agendas, with attention to both immediate needs and long-term capacities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssrc.org/programs/calhoun/ ssrc.org] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130416003140/http://www.ssrc.org/programs/calhoun/ |date=2013-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Calhoun has also entered the debate about public sociology, critically evaluating the project of public sociology while acknowledging its specific "promise", and arguing that "how sociology matters in the public sphere is vital to the future of the field".&lt;ref&gt;Calhoun, C. 2004 [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-4446.2005.00065.x/full "The promise of public sociology"]. ''The British Journal of Sociology'', 2005, Vol. 56, Issue 3, 355-363.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future==
Following the 2004 annual meeting of the [[American Sociological Association]] (ASA), at which Michael Burawoy's vision of public sociology was introduced during his presidential address,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burawoy|first=Michael|date=2005|title=For Public Sociology|url=http://burawoy.berkeley.edu/Public%20Sociology,%20Live/Burawoy.pdf|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=70|pages=4–28|doi=10.1177/000312240507000102|pmid=|access-date=April 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; there has been continued interest in the topic.

Building on the conversation sparked by Burawoy in 2004, the 2007 ASA meeting in New York City contained many facets of public sociology. Many of the presentations engaged directly with the public sociology debate, such as: "Constituting a Practical Public Sociology: Reflections on Participatory Research at the Citizenship Project"&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, Paul. [http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p185050_index.html "Constituting a Practical Public Sociology: Reflections on Participatory Research at the Citizenship Project"] Paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Sociological Association, TBA, New York, New York City, Aug 11, 2007. 2011-06-09&lt;/ref&gt; by Paul Johnston; "A New Public Sociology of Punishment"&lt;ref&gt;Schoenfeld, Heather. [http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p184842_index.html "1. A New Public Sociology of Punishment"] Paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Sociological Association (ASA), TBA, New York, New York City, Aug 11, 2007. 2011-06-09&lt;/ref&gt; by Heather Schoenfeld; "What Do Activists Want? Public Sociology for Feminist Scholars of Reproduction"&lt;ref&gt;Bessett, Danielle. and Morton, Christine. [http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p184413_index.html "What Do Activists Want?

[http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/1/8/3/9/0/p183902_index.html "Developing a public sociology: from lay knowledge to civic intelligence in health impact assessment"] Paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Sociological Association, TBA, New York, New York City, Aug 11, 2007. 2011-06-09&lt;/ref&gt; by Eva Elliott and Gareth Williams.

Lambros Fatsis' doctoral thesis on public sociology, [http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/51588/ "Making Sociology Public: A Critical Analysis of an Old Idea and a Recent Debate"], can also be recommended as a critical review of the contemporary disciplinary debate about public sociology, incorporating such developments as "e-public sociology" into the scholarly discussion. E-public sociology is a form of public sociology that involves publishing sociological materials in online accessible spaces and subsequent interaction with publics in these spaces.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, C.J. (2014). Social Media and e-Public Sociology. In Ariane Hanemaayer and [[Christopher J. Schneider]], editors, The Public Sociology Debate: Ethics and Engagement, University of British Columbia Press: 205-224.&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate over public sociology is having far reaching consequences for how many sociology departments teach and ''do'' sociology, with several reorienting their programs to encompass elements of public sociology. For example, the sociology department at the [[University of Minnesota]] has begun advocating for sociology to claim a larger role in public life, providing "useful, accurate, and scientifically rigorous information to policy makers and community leaders".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asanet.org/footnotes/nov04/fn14.html "The Engaged Department: Public Sociology in the Twin Cities"] by Ronald Aminzade, University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, Footnotes nov. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the Department of Sociology and Anthropology at [[George Mason University]] began offering a doctoral degree in sociology in the fall of 2008, grounding its two specializations in Institutions and Inequalities and the Sociology of Globalization within a context of public sociological praxis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asanet.org/footnotes/mayjun08/mason.html|title=Footnotes--May/June 2008 Issue--George Mason Introduces New PhD Program in Public Sociology|website=www.asanet.org|access-date=2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], too, most institutions that provide undergraduate sociology degrees now advertise the public or "applied" nature of the curriculum (or various key modules that form part of the curriculum). Some examples here would include: [[Birmingham City University]]; [[Queen Margaret University|Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh]]; [[Nottingham Trent University]]; the [[University of Exeter]]; [[Cardiff University]]; and [[Bishop Grosseteste University]]'s newly established [https://web.archive.org/web/20160113173152/http://www.bishopg.ac.uk/study/courses/Pages/sociology.aspx BA Sociology program].

Indeed, with so many programs incorporating the ideals of public sociology into their curriculums, this will have significant consequences for how future sociologists are trained to ''do'' sociology.

==Criticism==
A significant number of those who practice sociology either as public intellectuals or as academic professionals do not subscribe to the specific version of "public sociology" defended by Michael Burawoy or to any version of "public sociology" at all. And in the wake of Burawoy's 2004 Presidency of the American Sociological Association, which put the theme of public sociology in the limelight, the project of public sociology has been vigorously debated on the web, in conversations among sociologists, and in a variety of academic journals.

Specifically, Burawoy's vision of public sociology has been critiqued both by "[[Critical theory|critical]]" sociologists and by representatives of academic sociology. These various discussions of public sociology have been included in forums devoted to the subject in [[academic journal]]s such as ''Social Problems'', ''Social Forces'', ''Critical Sociology'', and the ''[[British Journal of Sociology]]'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20051125044631/http://sociology.berkeley.edu/faculty/BURAWOY/workingpapers.htm].

Public sociology faces fierce criticism on the grounds of both of its logic and its goals.  Its critics claim that it is based on a [[false premise]] of consensus in the sociological community, arguing that "it greatly overestimates the uniformity of the moral and political agenda of sociologists".&lt;ref name="nielsen"&gt;Francois Nielsen. 2004. "The Vacant 'We': Remarks on Public Sociology."  Social Forces, Vol. 82, No. 4 (Jun., 2004), pp. 1619-1627&lt;/ref&gt;  They question the possibility and the desirability of such moral agreement, pointing out that "almost every social issue involves moral dilemmas, not moral clarity. What is or is not 'just' is almost never unambiguous".&lt;ref name="tittle"/&gt;  Others argue that public sociology is based on an uncritical and overly idealistic perception of the public sphere.&lt;ref name="brady"&gt;Brady, David. 2004. "Why Public Sociology May Fail."  ''Social Forces'', Vol. 82, No. 4 (Jun., 2004), pp. 1629-1638&lt;/ref&gt; Thibodeaux&lt;ref&gt;Thibodeaux, Jarrett. 2016. Production as Social Change: Policy Sociology as a Public Good. Sociological Spectrum. 36 (3). P. 183-190. DOI: https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02732173.2015.1102666&lt;/ref&gt; argues that public sociology relies on a dialectical, unilineal evolutionary view of social change. If a public sociologist assumes a multi-lineal interpretation of social change, public sociology will fail to affect social change for three reasons: (1) there's no objective criteria for the assessment of different goals (2) the rejection of one goal does not necessarily lead to an adherence to some other particular goal and (3) criticizing a goal maintains its relevance at the expense of possible alternatives.

Even stronger critiques come from academics who believe that the program of public sociology will unduly politicize the discipline and thus endanger the legitimacy sociology has in the public dialogue.&lt;ref name="tittle"&gt;Tittle, Charles. 2004. [http://cooley.ad.wsu.edu/schwartj/pdf/PublicSoc.pdf "The Arrogance of Public Sociology"]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. ''Social Forces'', June 2004, 82(4).&lt;/ref&gt;  These critics argue that the project of building a reliable body of knowledge about society is fundamentally incompatible with the goals of public sociology: "To the extent that we orient our work around moral principles, we are less likely to attend to theoretical issues. The greater the extent to which we favor particular outcomes, the less able are we to design our work to actually access such outcomes. And the more ideologically oriented our objectives, the less the chance that we can recognize or assimilate contrary evidence. In other words, rather than good professional sociology being mutually interactive with public sociology, I believe that public sociology gets in the way of good professional sociology."&lt;ref name="tittle"/&gt;

One outspoken critic of public sociology was sociologist [[Mathieu Deflem]] of the [[University of South Carolina]], who wrote various papers against public sociology and argued that public sociology:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"is neither public nor sociology. Public sociology is not a plea to make sociology more relevant to the many publics in society nor to connect sociology democratically to political activity. Of course sociologists should be public intellectuals. But they should be and can only be public intellectuals as practitioners of the science they practice, not as activists left or right. Yet public sociology instead is a quest to subsume sociology under politics, a politics of a specific kind, not in order to foster sociological activism but to narrow down the sociological discipline to activist sociology."&lt;ref&gt;[http://deflem.blogspot.com/2004/08/letter-to-editor-proper-role-of.html Deflem, Mathieu. 2004. "The Proper Role of Sociology in the World at Large" (letter to the editor), ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'', October 1.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In opposition to public sociology, Deflem used to maintain the website, [http://www.savesociology.org/ SaveSociology.org].

==Applied sociology==

"Applied sociology" and "sociological practice" (also referred to as [[policy sociology]]) has come to refer to [[Intervention (counseling)|intervention]] using sociological knowledge in an applied setting. Applied sociologists work in a wide variety of settings including universities, government, and private practice, using sociological methods to help communities solve everyday problems, such as improving community policing and crime prevention, evaluating and improving drug courts, assessing the needs of [[inner city]] neighborhoods, developing the capacity of an educational system, or promoting the development of housing and related resources for aging populations.&lt;ref&gt;Straus, Roger A, ''Preface'' in Price, Jammie, Straus, Roger and Breese, Jeffrey, editors, ''In Doing Sociology. Case Studies in Sociological Practice'', [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]] (2009), {{ISBN|978-0-7391-3395-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociological practice is different from pure academic sociology in which sociologists work in an academic setting such as a university with a teaching and pure research orientation. Although there are some common origins, sociological practice is entirely distinct from [[social work]].&lt;ref&gt;Straus, Roger A, ''Using Sociology: An Introduction From The Applied and Clinical Perspectives'' Third Edition. Rowman &amp; Littlefield (2002), {{ISBN|0-7425-1662-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; An increasing number of universities are attempting to gear curricula toward practical sociology in this way. Clinical sociology courses give students the skills to be able to work effectively with clients, teach basic [[counseling]] skills, give knowledge that is useful for careers such as victims assisting and drug rehabilitation, and teach the student how to integrate sociological knowledge with other fields they may go into such as marriage and family therapy, and clinical social work.

As defined by the Applied Social Sciences Forum (ASSF), applied Social Science (ASS) seeks to highlight the processes of social and political transformation taking place in a particular society. It is characterized by the operational aspect of the knowledge it produces. Unlike pure academic knowledge, applied social sciences try to steer the debate towards scientific priorities of social and political reform and accompanying social transformations. From this point of view, the applied social sciences can be seen as complementary knowledge that enrich both the action and the academic sciences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assforum.org The Applied Social Science Forum website - assforum.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

The objectives of ASS are to deepen reflection on practical issues related to their objective, to support the major decision making in society and enable researchers to support their knowledge and enrich the range of possible solutions.&lt;ref&gt;Abdelwahab Ben Hafaiedh: The Applied Social Science today - Tunisian Association of Sociology - Tunis 2001 p 23&lt;/ref&gt;

The "action research" is the framework of choice for applied social sciences. Action research can be defined here as a process that involves further intervention by the researcher beyond the return of a single diagnostic assay type, or inventory.

The researcher may, in this way, have several hats within the same search:
* A role of developer issues, logical actions and issues of different actors,
* An expert who accompanies the action from his methodology and science role
* A facilitator role pilot working groups and aims, as and when the progress of its work, its analyzes to confront the realities of stakeholders power feed, 
* A mediator who brings out back and speak different stakeholders of an action system
* A role of facilitator who can help build collective courses of action relevant while remaining outside issues discussed.

The methodological tools of the SSA are:
* Qualitative approaches (different types of interviews and / or collective)
* Quantitative methods using questionnaires and / or literature searches, data processing statistics
* The analysis of practices
* Action research
* Participatory methods

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3635">The '''SAT Subject Test in Physics''', '''Physics SAT II''', or simply the '''Physics SAT''', is a one-hour [[multiple choice]] [[Standardized test|test]] on [[physics]] administered by [[The College Board]] in the United States. A high school student generally chooses to take the test to fulfill [[college]] entrance requirements for the schools at which the student is planning to apply. Until 1994, the [[SAT Subject Tests]] were known as '''Achievement Tests'''; until January 2005, they were known as '''SAT IIs'''; they are still well known by this name.

The material tested on the Physics SAT is supposed to be equivalent to that taught in a junior- or senior-level high school physics class. It requires critical thinking and test-taking strategies, at which high school freshmen or sophomores may be inexperienced. The Physics SAT tests more than what normal state requirements are; therefore, many students prepare for the Physics SAT using a [[prep book|preparatory book]] or by taking an [[AP course]] in [[Physics]].

==Format==

The SAT Subject Test in Physics has 75 questions and consists of two parts: Part A and Part B.

'''Part A:''' 
*  First 12 or 13 questions
*  4 groups of two to four questions each
*  The questions within any one group all relate to a single situation.
*  Five possible answer choices are given before the question.
*  An answer choice can be used once, more than once, or not at all in each group.

'''Part B:'''
*  Last 62 or 63 questions
*  Each question has five possible answer choice with one correct answer.
*  Some questions may be in groups of two or three.

==Scoring==

The test has 75 multiple choice questions that are to be answered in one hour. All questions have five answer choices. Students receive 1 point for every correct answer, lose ¼ of a point for each incorrect answer, and receive 0 points for questions left blank. This score is then converted to a scaled score of 200–800. The mean score for the 2006–07 test administrations was 643 with a [[standard deviation]] of 107. Sample percentile ranks for the 2008&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://professionals.collegeboard.com/profdownload/sat_subject_tests_percentile_ranks_2008.pdf SAT Subject Tests Percentile Ranks]&lt;/ref&gt; administrations are available from the College Board.

==Preparation==
The College Board's recommended preparation is a one-year college preparatory course in physics, a one-year course in [[algebra]] and [[trigonometry]], and experience in the laboratory.

==Resources==
Students taking the SAT Subject Test in Physics are prohibited from using any resources during the test, including textbooks, notes, or formula sheets. Although there are mathematics questions including trigonometry, the use of a calculator is not allowed. All scratch work must be done directly in the test booklet.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1856">A '''squib''' is a brief satirical or witty piece of writing or speech, like a [[parody|lampoon]], or a short, sometimes humorous piece in a newspaper or magazine, used as a filler. It can be  intended to ignite thinking and discourse by others on topics of theoretical importance—e.g., see [[MIT Press]]'s journal, ''[[Linguistic Inquiry]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=4&amp;tid=6|title=The MIT Press|website=MIT Press|accessdate=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is often less substantial than this and just humorous (see [[The Daily Squib]]).

One of the most famous squibs in English literature is ''The Candidate'' by [[Thomas Gray]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Toynbee, Paget|editorlink=Paget Toynbee|chapter=The Candidate|title=The correspondence of Gray, Walpole, West and Ashton (1734–1771)|volume=vol. 2|year=1915|pages=226–228|publisher=Oxford University Press|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QF0EAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA226}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Squib}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[linguistics]], squibs may outline anomalous data but not suggest a solution. This usage in the field was popularized by [[John R. Ross|John R. “Haj” Ross]] in the 1960s. A squib may also develop a minor theoretical argument. A particularly interesting variety of squibs are the so-called snippets, which are "the ideal footnote: a side remark that taken on its own is not worth lengthy development but that needs to be said".&lt;ref name="ledonline.it"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ledonline.it/snippets/|title=Led on Line - Snippets|website=www.ledonline.it|accessdate=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The online journal Snippets is dedicated to this type of squib.&lt;ref name="ledonline.it"/&gt;

'''Statistical physics''' is a branch of [[physics]] that uses methods of [[probability theory]] and [[statistics]], and particularly the [[Mathematics|mathematical]] tools for dealing with large populations and approximations, in solving physical problems. It can describe a wide variety of fields with an inherently [[stochastic]] nature. Its applications include many problems in the fields of physics, [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[neurology]], and even some social sciences, such as [[sociology]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raducha|first=Tomasz|last2=Gubiec|first2=Tomasz|date=2017-04|title=Coevolving complex networks in the model of social interactions|journal=Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications|volume=471|pages=427–435|doi=10.1016/j.physa.2016.12.079|issn=0378-4371|arxiv=1606.03130}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[linguistics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raducha|first=Tomasz|last2=Gubiec|first2=Tomasz|date=2018-04-27|title=Predicting language diversity with complex networks|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=13|issue=4|pages=e0196593|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0196593|issn=1932-6203|pmc=5922521|pmid=29702699}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Its main purpose is to clarify the properties of matter in aggregate, in terms of physical laws governing atomic motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Introduction to Statistical Physics |last = Huang |first = Kerson |publisher= CRC Press| isbn = 978-1-4200-7902-9 |page=15 |edition = 2nd|date = 2009-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, [[statistical mechanics]] develops the [[Phenomenology (particle physics)|phenomenological]] results of [[thermodynamics]] from a probabilistic examination of the underlying microscopic systems. Historically, one of the first topics in physics where statistical methods were applied was the field of [[mechanics]], which is concerned with the motion of particles or objects when subjected to a force.

==Statistical mechanics==
{{Statistical mechanics}}
{{main|Statistical mechanics}}
[[Statistical mechanics]] provides a framework for relating the microscopic properties of individual atoms and molecules to the macroscopic or bulk properties of materials that can be observed in everyday life, therefore explaining [[thermodynamics]] as a natural result of statistics, [[classical mechanics]], and [[quantum mechanics]] at the microscopic level.  Because of this history, the statistical physics is often considered synonymous with statistical mechanics or [[statistical thermodynamics]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;This article presents a broader sense of the definition of statistical physics.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most important equations in statistical mechanics (analogous to &lt;math&gt;F=ma&lt;/math&gt; in [[Newton's laws of motion|Newtonian mechanics]], or the [[Schroedinger equation|Schrödinger equation]] in quantum mechanics) is the definition of the [[Partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]] &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;, which is essentially a weighted sum of all possible states &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; available to a system.

: &lt;math&gt;Z = \sum_q \mathrm{e}^{-\frac{E(q)}{k_BT}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k_B&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]], &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is [[temperature]] and  &lt;math&gt;E(q)&lt;/math&gt; is [[energy]] of state  &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;. Furthermore, the probability of a given state, &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;, occurring is given by

: &lt;math&gt;P(q) = \frac{ {\mathrm{e}^{-\frac{E(q)}{k_BT}}}}{Z}&lt;/math&gt;

Here we see that very-high-energy states have little probability of occurring, a result that is consistent with intuition.

A statistical approach can work well in classical systems when the number of [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] (and so the number of variables) is so large that exact solution is not possible, or not really useful. Statistical mechanics can also describe work in [[non-linear dynamics]], [[chaos theory]], [[thermal physics]], [[fluid dynamics]] (particularly at high [[Knudsen number]]s), or [[plasma physics]].

Although some problems in statistical physics can be solved analytically using approximations and expansions, most current research utilizes the large processing power of modern computers to simulate or approximate solutions. A common approach to statistical problems is to use a [[Monte Carlo simulation]] to yield insight into the dynamics of a [[complex system]].

===Quantum statistical mechanics===
[[Quantum statistical mechanics]] is [[statistical mechanics]] applied to [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical systems]]. In quantum mechanics a [[statistical ensemble (mathematical physics)|statistical ensemble]] (probability distribution over possible [[quantum state]]s) is described by a [[density matrix|density operator]] ''S'', which is a non-negative, [[self-adjoint]], [[trace-class]] operator of trace 1 on the [[Hilbert space]] ''H'' describing the quantum system.  This can be shown under various [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics|mathematical formalisms for quantum mechanics]].  One such formalism is provided by [[quantum logic]].

==Scientists and universities==
A significant contribution (at different times) in development of statistical physics was given by [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], [[James Clerk Maxwell]], [[Ludwig Boltzmann]], [[J. Willard Gibbs]], [[Marian Smoluchowski]], [[Albert Einstein]], [[Enrico Fermi]], [[Richard Feynman]], [[L. Landau]], [[Vladimir Fock]], [[Werner Heisenberg]], [[Nikolay Bogolyubov]], Benjamin Widom, [[Lars Onsager]], Benjamin and Jeremy Chubb (also inventors of the titanium sublimation pump), and others. Statistical physics is studied in the nuclear center at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]]. Also, Pentagon has organized a large department for the study of [[turbulence]] at the [[Princeton University|University of Princeton]]. Work in this area is also being conducted by [[Saclay]] (Paris), [[Max Planck Society|Max Planck Institute]], [[AMOLF|Netherlands Institute for Atomic and Molecular Physics]] and other research centers.

==Achievements==
Statistical physics allowed us to explain and quantitatively describe [[superconductivity]], [[superfluidity]], [[turbulence]], collective phenomena in [[solid]]s and [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], and the structural features of [[liquid]]. It underlies the modern [[astrophysics]]. It is statistical physics that helped us to create such intensively developing study of [[liquid crystals]] and to construct a theory of [[phase transition]] and [[critical phenomena]]. Many experimental studies of matter are entirely based on the statistical description of a system. These include the scattering of cold [[neutron]]s, [[X-ray]], [[Visible radiation|visible light]], and more.
Statistical physics plays a major role in Physics of Solid State Physics, Materials Science, Nuclear Physics, Astrophysics, Chemistry, Biology and Medicine (e.g. study of the spread of infectious diseases), Information Theory and Technique but also in those areas of technology owing to their development in the evolution of Modern Physics. It still has important applications in theoretical sciences such as Sociology and Linguistics and is useful for researchers in higher education, corporate governance and industry.

'''''The Soldier and the State: The Theory and Politics of Civil-Military Relations''''' is a 1957 book written by [[political scientist]] [[Samuel P. Huntington]]. In the book, Huntington advances the theory of objective [[civilian control of the military|civilian control]], according to which the optimal means of asserting control over the [[armed forces]] is to professionalize them. This is in contrast to subjective control, which involves placing legal and institutional restrictions on the military's autonomy.  [[Edward M. Coffman]] has written that "[a]nyone seriously interested in American military history has to come to terms with Samuel P. Huntington's ''The Soldier and the State."&lt;ref name=coffman&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Long Shadow of The Soldier and the State|author=Edward M. Coffman|pages=69–82|journal=The Journal of Military History|volume=55|number=1|date=January 1991|jstor=1986129|doi=10.2307/1986129}}{{paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outline Summary==
{{Original research|date=May 2009}}

===Part I: “Military Institutions and the State: Theoretical and Historical Perspectives”===

In the first chapter titled "Officership as a Profession", Huntington immediately states his thesis of the book. The purpose is to describe how the "modern officer corps is a professional body and the modern officer a professional man."&lt;ref&gt;Huntington, S. (1981). The Soldier and the State: The Theory and Politics of Civil-Military Relations. New York, NY: Belknap Press. Page 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, "Officership as a Profession", Huntington defines qualities of a [[profession]] and argues that the officer corps conforms to this definition. The qualities of a profession are (1) Expertise, (2) Responsibility, and (3) Corporateness.&lt;ref&gt;Huntington, S. (1981). The Soldier and the State: The Theory and Politics of Civil-Military Relations. New York, NY: Belknap Press. Page 8-10. &lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the [[Officer (armed forces)|officer corps]] display specialized knowledge in the management of violence, maintains a monopoly on education and advancement in their field, and have an overarching responsibility to the society they serve and thus do not 'compete' in the open market. The military profession requires comprehensive study and training, and thus expertise, of an intellectual set of skills: organizing of forces, planning of activities, and executing and directing activities.&lt;ref&gt;Huntington, S. (1981). The Soldier and the State: The Theory and Politics of Civil-Military Relations. New York, NY: Belknap Press. Page 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The military expertise, the management of violence, includes the science of war and combat as well as organizational and administrative skills. The specializations of the military profession expands far and wide since there are engineers, pilots, mechanics, ordinance experts, and more. Huntington argues this 'professional ethic'  differentiates 'officers' from amateur groups engaged in violence (reservists, mercenaries, technical specialists, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Huntington, Samuel. The Soldier and the State: The Theory and Politics of Civil-Military Relations. New York: Belknap Press, 1957. pg 11&lt;/ref&gt; Huntington stresses that 'professionalism' entails a mutually binding relationship between society and its 'professionals.' The military profession requires that military officers fulfill its duties to its country by compliance with political officials running the state and government. It is the responsibility of the military to provide the public good of common defense since it acts as an agent to the principal government and citizenry. However, each step up in the hierarchy within the military profession demands more responsibility and skill because they are authorized to make more strategic decisions. In the case of the officer corps, officers are entrusted with evaluating the security of the state and providing expert advice to its leaders, and society in turn must afford a measure of deference to their professional expertise and institutions. (Huntington highlights the fact that the [[President of the United States|President]] cannot usurp the [[Military organization|military hierarchy]] and appoint a [[lieutenant]] to serve on the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]]).&lt;ref&gt;Huntington, Samuel. The Soldier and the State: The Theory and Politics of Civil-Military Relations. New York: Belknap Press, 1957. pg 14-15&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally Huntington argues the officership displays a decidedly 'corporate character' as the officers  tend to:  live apart from general society, delineate hierarchy by specific uniforms and insignia, and maintain a strict separation (within the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]) from lay people who merely 'administer violence' ([[Reservist|reservists]]).&lt;ref&gt;Huntington, Samuel. The Soldier and the State: The Theory and Politics of Civil-Military Relations. New York: Belknap Press, 1957. pg 16&lt;/ref&gt; Corporateness refers to the distinct and unique features specific to a profession that which separate it from other professions. Entrance to the profession is restricted with high standards and fulfillment, military academia, and ranks.

Chapter two outlines the “rise of the military profession in Western society.” He describes that the officer corps consisted of mercenaries from the breakdown of feudalism until their replacement by aristocratic officers after the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–1648) and why neither the mercenaries nor aristocrats were professionals under his definition. Finally in the 19th century the idea of the aristocratic military genius was replaced by the [[Prussianism|Prussian]] reliance upon “average men succeeding by superior education, organization and experience.”  &lt;ref&gt;pg. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter three discusses the military mind and military professional ethic. He notes misconceptions regarding the military mind and seeks "to elaborate the professional military ethic with respect to (1) basic values and perspectives, (2) national military policy, (3) the relation of the military to the state." &lt;ref&gt;pg. 62&lt;/ref&gt;  He summarizes the ethic as "conservative realism....It exalts obedience as the highest virtue of military men. The military ethic is thus pessimistic, collectivist, historically inclined, power-oriented, nationalistic, militaristic, pacifist, and instrumentalist in its view of the military profession." &lt;ref&gt;pg. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter four is a discussion of civil-military relations in theory. He defines subjective civilian control (where military professionalism is reduced due to co-opting of the military by civilian political groups) and objective civilian control - where military professional thrives as it is far removed from politics. He describes the effect of four ideologies (liberalism, [[fascism]], [[Marxism]], conservatism) on military professionalism and civilian control.

Chapter five analyzes the military professional in the German and Japanese societies where it became dominant as [[militarism]]. He states that, "no country has had a wider variety of experiences in civil-military relations than modern Germany", with its officer corps achieving unmatched "high standards of professionalism" and then being "completely prostituted" under [[Nazism]].&lt;ref name="pg. 98"&gt;pg. 98&lt;/ref&gt;  He details the varying situations of the [[German Empire|imperial]], World War I, [[Weimar Republic|republican]], and Nazi periods. In contrast,  "Japanese civil-military relations remained in a single relatively stable pattern from 1868 to 1945" where the "military played a persistently active role in the politics of their country." &lt;ref name="pg. 98"/&gt;  He argues that "in both countries the disruption of the civil-military balance reflected more basic constitutional disorders" and "that disruption helped undermine the nation's security: distorting the perspective and judgment of soldiers and statesmen." &lt;ref&gt;pg. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part II: “Military Power in America: The Historical Experience: 1789-1940”===

Chapter six describes the military in the traditional liberal American political context in four sections: liberalism and the Constitution as historical constants of American civil-military relations, the prevalence of liberalism in the U.S., the liberal approach to military affairs, and the military hero in liberal politics. He details how "the American liberal approach to military affairs was hostile, static and dominant; the conservative approach of the Federalists and the South sympathetic, constructive and thwarted." &lt;ref&gt;pg. 147&lt;/ref&gt; The elements of American liberalism which influenced international relations "were (1) its indifference to international affairs, (2) its application of domestic solutions to international affairs, and (3) its search for objectivity in international affairs." &lt;ref&gt;pg. 149&lt;/ref&gt; He also states that "the United States, by virtue of its noninvolvement in the balance of power was able to pursue foreign policy objectives defined in terms of universal ideals rather than in terms of national interests." &lt;ref&gt;151&lt;/ref&gt; He discusses the "hostile image of the military profession" and "liberal military policy". He argues that the non-professional military hero was traditionally welcomed in liberal America while the professional military hero was generally not successful politically.

Chapter seven explains the structure of civil-military relations provided by the conservative U.S. constitution and civil control of the military.

Chapter eight outlines the American military tradition up to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].

Chapter nine is “The Creation of the American Military Profession”. It outlines the contributions of key individuals and institutions and describes the origins of the American military mind.

Chapter ten covers the period 1890 to 1920, including “Neo-Hamiltonism”, [[Alfred Mahan]] and [[Leonard Wood]].

Chapter eleven covers interwar civil-military relations and the military ethic of the period.

===Part III: “The Crisis of American Civil-Military Relations 1940-1955”===

Chapter twelve covers World War II.

Chapter thirteen outlines civil-military relations in the first decade after World War II.

Chapter fourteen is “The Political Roles of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff|Joint Chiefs]].”

Chapter fifteen describes the impact of the separation of powers on civil-military relations during the [[Cold War]].

Chapter sixteen analyzes the Cold War structure of the Defense Department in the context of civil-military relations.

Chapter seventeen discusses the challenges faced by the heightened ongoing defense needs of the Cold War versus the tradition of American liberalism and the move “Towards a New Equilibrium” between the two.

The '''trace''' in [[semiotics]]{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} is a concept developed by [[Jacques Derrida]] in [[Writing and Difference]] to denote the history that a [[Sign (semiotics)|sign]] carries with it as the result of its use through time.{{page needed|date=March 2011}} Words like "black", for example, carry the trace of all their previous uses with them, making them sensitive, loaded words when used in any context. The trace then reveals the possibility for alternative interpretation of concepts, regardless of how carefully articulated they may be, whenever they are expressed in language.

'''Undergrowth''' usually refers to the vegetation in the lower part of a [[forest]], which can obstruct passage through the forest. The height of undergrowth is usually considered to be 0.3 – 3 m (1 – 9&amp;nbsp;ft.). Undergrowth can also refer to all vegetation in a forest which is not in the [[canopy (biology)|canopy]].{{cn|date=August 2017}}

[[File:Vasculum face sup.jpg|thumb|Vasculum]]
A '''vasculum''' or a '''botanical box''' is a stiff container used by [[botanist]]s to keep field [[Sample (material)|sample]]s viable for transportation. The main purpose of the vasculum is to transport plants without crushing them and by maintaining a cool, humid [[Environment (systems)|environment]].

==Construction==
Vascula are cylinders typically made from [[Tinning|tinned]] and sometimes lacquered iron, though wooden examples are known. The box was carried horizontally on a strap so that plant [[Laboratory specimen|specimen]]s lie flat and lined with moistened cloth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://garance.voyageuse.free.fr/botanique/dep_bota3.htm |title=L'herbier, un outil pour le botaniste |trans-title=The herbarium, a tool for the botanist |language=French |publisher=La Garance voyageuse |quote=with image }}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, British and American vascula were somewhat flat and [[suitcase|valise]]-like with a single room, while continental examples were more cylindrical and often longer, sometimes with two separate compartments.&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baker|first1=H. G.|title=Origin of the Vasculum|journal=Proceedings of the Botanical Society of the British Isles|date=1958|volume=3|pages=41–43|url=http://www.watsonia.org.uk/html/proceedings_3.html#p41.pdf|accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Access to the interior is through one (sometimes two) large lids in the side, allowing plants to be put in and taken out without bending or distorting them unnecessarily. This is particularly important with [[wildflowers]], which are often fragile.

Some early 20th century specimen are made from sheet aluminium rather than tin, but otherwise follow the 19th century pattern. The exterior is usually left rough, or lacquered green.

==History==
The roots of the vasculum is lost in time, but may have evolved from the 17th century tin candle-box of similar construction. [[Linnaeus]] called it a ''vasculum dilletanum'', from [[Latin]] ''vasculum'' - small container and ''dilletanum'', referring to [[Johann Jacob Dillenius|J.J. Dillenius]], Linnaeus' friend and colleague at [[University of Oxford Botanic Garden|Oxford Botanic Garden]]. With rise of botany as a scientific field the mid 18th century, the vasculum became an indispensable part of the botanist's equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allen|first1=D.E.|title=Some further Light on the History of the Vasculum|journal=Proceedings of the Botanical Society of the British Isles|date=1965|volume=6|pages=105–109|url=http://www.watsonia.org.uk/html/proceedings_6.html#p105.pdf|accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with the screw-down plant press, the vasculum was popularized in Britain by naturalist [[William Withering]] around 1770.&lt;ref name=Mygatt&gt;{{cite journal|last1=J.E.|first1=Mygatt|title=A Case for Collecting|journal=Iowa Native Plant Society Newsletter|date=2001|volume=7|page=3|url=http://www.msb.unm.edu/herbarium/documents/vasculum.pdf|accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shortened term "vasculum" appear to have become the common name applied to them around 1830.&lt;ref name=Baker/&gt; Being a hallmark of field botany, the vascula were in common use until [[World War II]] . With post-war emphasis on [[systematics]] rather than [[alpha taxonomy]] and new species often collected in far-away places, field botany and the vascula with it went into decline.

Aluminium vascula are still made and in use, though [[Zipper storage bag|zipper bags]] and clear plastic folders are today cheaper and more common in use.&lt;ref name=Mygatt/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7633">{{IC|date=April 2015}}The {{nihongo|'''Yukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics'''|基礎物理学研究所|kiso butsurigaku kenkyūsho}} is a research institute in the field of [[theoretical physics]], attached to [[Kyoto University]] in [[Japan]]. It was inaugurated in 1952.
While the center is often referred to as "YITP", this can be confusing as YITP also stands for the [[C. N. Yang Institute for Theoretical Physics]] at [[Stony Brook University]] in [[the United States]].

==Early history==
In 1949, [[Japan]]ese [[theoretical physicist]] [[Hideki Yukawa]] was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]. He became the first Japanese citizen to receive the [[Nobel Prize]]. To commemorate this historic event, the president of [[Kyoto University]] immediately proposed to create a memorial hall on campus for Yukawa. In 1950, the Science Council of Japan unanimously resolved a request to the central government to allocate a special funding for the promotion of research in theoretical physics. Enthusiastic discussions among Japanese physicists followed in support for the idea of creating a new institution, similar to the [[Niels Bohr Institute]] in [[Copenhagen]] or the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]].

Yukawa Hall was inaugurated in 1952 and in 1953, it became the Research Institute for Fundamental Physics (RIFP). Hideki Yukawa was appointed as the first director of the institute. He led the institute until his retirement in 1970.

==Research Institute for Fundamental Physics (1953-1990)==
Research Institute for Fundamental Physics was a new type of national research center for [[theoretical physics]] with its facilities open for research collaborations by the community of theoretical physicists in [[Japan]]. The institute adopted a new system for its operation. Although it formally belongs to [[Kyoto University]], its basic policy has been decided by the representatives of physicists elected from all over the country with institute's own academic staff. One of the unique roles played by the institute was to provide a forum for physicists on problems at the forefront of research in theoretical physics. Many physicists participated in the organization of topical workshops and international conferences at RIFP and stayed to work in collaboration with others. These traditions are still carried by the Yukawa Institute.

The institute started with four academic staff including Yukawa. The institute grew gradually; it had 13 academic positions in 1961. The research activity extended over areas of theoretical physics. Those areas were [[condensed matter theory]], [[field theory (physics)|field theory]], nuclear theory, [[particle physics|particle theory]], [[statistical mechanics]], and nuclear and relativistic [[astrophysics]]. In 1980 it added two more academic positions for new research areas: non-equilibrium statistical physics and non-linear physics. During this period, one visiting professor position was created to invite distinguished foreign physicists.

==Unification with the RITP in Hiroshima (1990)==
The new English name, the Yukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics, was adopted after the unification of two institutions: the Research Institute for Theoretical Physics (RITP) of [[Hiroshima University]] and Research Institute for Fundamental Physics (RIFP).

RITP of Hiroshima University was founded in 1944 by Yoshitaka Mimura for the research of mathematical foundations of theoretical physics. On August 6, 1945, it lost two faculty members and a supporting staff, together with all its facilities, by the blast of the [[atomic bomb]] exploded over Hiroshima.

RITP was re-established in 1948 in Takehara, a quiet suburban town of Hiroshima near the water, and stayed there until it was dissolved by the unification in 1990.

A major expansion of the institute took place in 1990 when Research Institute for Fundamental Physics (RIFP) was joined by all academic staff members of the Research Institute for Theoretical Physics (RITP) of Hiroshima University. At the time of the unification, RITP had ten academic staffs and its research area had expanded to include [[cosmology]], [[general relativity]], [[field theory (physics)|field theory]], and [[particle physics|particle theory]].

==Present YITP==
By the expansion of 1990, the size of the institute almost doubled in terms of the number of its own academic staffs. Unfortunately Yukawa Hall had no extra office or library space to accommodate the new members of the institute and the library assets from RITP. Temporary settings for new offices and library was arranged in the Uji campus of Kyoto University which is located about 20&amp;nbsp;km south of Yukawa Hall. Thus, Yukawa Institute became distributed over two distantly located buildings, Yukawa Hall on the Kitashirakawa campus and the Uji Research Center on the Uji campus.

In 1995, the completion of the new building of the Yukawa Institute, constructed next to Yukawa Hall, ended this inconvenient situation of having two geographically separated facilities of the institute. The Uji Research Center was closed at this time. The new building now houses the offices of all 22 academic staffs as well as those for visitors, postdoctoral fellows, students and supporting staffs in addition to the new large library and computing facilities. Yukawa Hall is still used for research conferences and workshops organized by the Yukawa Institute besides use for its administrative offices, including Director's, and for the editorial office of the ''[[Progress of Theoretical Physics]]'', a journal of theoretical physics founded by Yukawa in 1946.

==Activity of YITP==
YITP has been playing a major role in leading the research in theoretical physics and also providing research and collaborative facilities in Japan.

Every year, YITP host a number of workshops on various topics in fundamental physics, and accommodate domestic visitors from various institutions as well as those from foreign countries.

The activity of YITP covers a wide range of fields in contemporary theoretical physics: [[string theory]], [[quantum field theory]], [[gravity]], [[cosmology]], [[particle physics]], [[astrophysics]], [[nuclear physics]], [[statistical physics]], [[condensed matter physics]] and [[biophysics]]. YITP also encourage activities in creating a new interdisciplinary field of research at the forefront of modern theoretical physics.

The '''Załuski Library''' ({{lang-pl|Biblioteka Załuskich}}, {{lang-la|Bibliotheca Zalusciana}}) was built in [[Warsaw]] in 1747–1795 by [[Józef Andrzej Załuski]] and his brother, [[Andrzej Stanisław Załuski]], both [[Roman Catholic]] bishops. The library was the first Polish public library, the largest library in Poland, and one of the earliest public libraries in Europe.&lt;ref name="utoronto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fyifrance"/&gt;

After the [[Kościuszko Uprising]] (1794), Russian troops, acting on orders from Czarina [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]], seized the library's holdings and transported them to her personal collection at [[Saint Petersburg]], where a year later it formed the cornerstone of the newly founded [[Imperial Public Library]].&lt;ref name="fyifrance"/&gt;

In the 1920s the government of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] returned some of the former Załuski Library holdings to the recently established [[Second Polish Republic]] thanks to the [[Peace of Riga|Treaty of Riga]]. These holdings were deliberately destroyed by [[Nazi Germany|German]] troops during the [[planned destruction of Warsaw]] in October 1944, following the collapse of the [[Warsaw Uprising]].&lt;ref name="fyifrance"/&gt;&lt;ref name="knuth"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Vogel Załuski Library.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Załuski Library under construction, by [[Zygmunt Vogel|Vogel]]]]
[[File:DPK1 DSC0038.JPG|thumb|left|250px|"House of the Kings" today (''ul. Daniłowiczowska 14'', corner of ''ul. Hipoteczna 2'', [[Warsaw]])]]
The Załuski brothers' greatest passion was [[book]]s. [[Józef Andrzej Załuski]] and his brother [[Andrzej Stanisław Załuski]] acquired the collections of earlier Polish bibliophiles such as [[Jakub Zadzik]], [[Krzysztof Opaliński]], Tomasz Ujejski, [[Janusz Wiśniowiecki]], [[Jerzy Mniszech]] and [[Jan III Sobieski]] (the latter, from his granddaughter, [[Maria Karolina Sobieska]]).

From the 1730s the brothers planned the creation of a [[library]], and in 1747 they founded the Załuski Library (''Biblioteka Załuskich''). Located in the 17th-century Daniłowicz Palace in [[Warsaw]] (built for [[Mikołaj Daniłowicz]] of Żurów),&lt;ref name="fyifrance" /&gt;&lt;ref name="danilowiczowska"/&gt; the library building had two stories (the large reading room was on the second floor) and was topped with a small tower containing an astronomical [[observatory]].&lt;ref name="fyifrance" /&gt; The building's reconstruction in [[rococo]] style was accomplished in 1745 by [[Francesco Antonio Melana]] and his brother.&lt;ref name="50 lat Biblioteki Narodowej, Warszawa, 1928-1978 (50 years of the National Library, Warsaw, 1928-1978)"/&gt;

The Załuski Library was considered the first Polish [[public library]]&lt;ref name="Bygone Warsaw"/&gt; and one of the largest libraries in the contemporary world.&lt;ref name="fyifrance" /&gt; In all of Europe there were only two or three libraries that could boast such holdings.&lt;ref name="welcometo"/&gt; The library initially held some 200,000 items, which grew to some 400,000 printed items, [[map]]s and [[manuscript]]s&lt;ref name="fyifrance" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lancour"/&gt; by the end of the 1780s. It also accumulated a collection of art, scientific instruments, and plant and animal specimens.

This library, open on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 7:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. to 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., asked patrons to be quiet and to say a prayer in the intention of the Załuski brothers.&lt;ref name="welcometo" /&gt; It was prohibited to take the books outside the library, as the book theft was a growing problem, to an extent that the bishop patrons decided to ask the [[pope]] for help.&lt;ref name="welcometo" /&gt; Responding to their request, in 1752 pope [[Benedict XIV]] issued a [[papal bull]] that threatened to [[excommunication]] individuals taking the books from this library; even that did not eliminate the problem completely.&lt;ref name="welcometo" /&gt;
[[File:Exlibris Zaluski.jpg|thumb|150px|Załuski Library ''[[Bookplate|exlibris]]'']] 
After the brothers' deaths, the newly formed [[Commission for National Education]] took charge of the library, renaming it the Załuski Brothers' Library of the Republic.

Twenty years later in 1794, in the aftermath of the [[second Partition of Poland]] and [[Kościuszko Uprising]], Russian troops, on orders from Russian Czarina [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]], emptied&lt;ref name="fyifrance" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eduskrypt"/&gt; the library and dispatched the whole collection to [[Saint Petersburg]], where the books formed the mass of the [[Imperial Public Library]] on its formation, a year later.&lt;ref name="fyifrance" /&gt;&lt;ref name="A Splendor of Letters: The Permanence of Books in an Impermanent World"/&gt; Parts of the collections were damaged or destroyed as they were mishandled while being removed from the library and transported to Russia, and many were stolen.&lt;ref name="fyifrance" /&gt;&lt;ref name="welcometo" /&gt; According to the historian [[Joachim Lelewel]], the Zaluskis' books, "could be bought at [[Grodno]] by the basket".&lt;ref name="fyifrance" /&gt;

The collection was later dispersed among several Russian libraries. Some parts of the Zaluski collection came back to Poland on two separate dates in the nineteenth century: 1842 and 1863.&lt;ref name="fyifrance" /&gt; In the 1920s, in the aftermath of the [[Polish-Soviet War]] and the [[Treaty of Riga]]&lt;ref name="Lancour" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Holocaust and the Book: Destruction and Preservation."/&gt; the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|RSFSR]]'s government returned around 50,000 items from the collection to Poland,&lt;ref name="fyifrance" /&gt; yet [[Nazi Germany|German]] soldiers deliberately destroyed these items during the Planned destruction of Warsaw in October 1944, after collapse of the Warsaw Uprising.&lt;ref name="fyifrance" /&gt;&lt;ref name="knuth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="welcometo" /&gt; Only 1800 manuscripts and 30,000 printed materials from the original library survived the war.

In 1821 the library's original home was altered into a [[Kamienica (architecture)|tenement house]].&lt;ref name="danilowiczowska" /&gt; During the building's reconstruction, the [[Bust (sculpture)|busts]] of [[List of Polish monarchs|Polish monarchs]] that had originally adorned the library's interiors, and which had been hidden during the [[Partitions of Poland]], were discovered and placed on the building's facade; hence the building came to be called the "House of the Kings" (''Dom pod Królami'').&lt;ref name="danilowiczowska" /&gt;

The building was destroyed by the Germans during [[World War II]].  After the war, it was rebuilt under the [[Polish People's Republic]].&lt;ref name="danilowiczowska" /&gt;

Today's [[Polish National Library]] (''Biblioteka Narodowa''), founded in 1928,&lt;ref name="fyifrance" /&gt; considers itself the descendant of the Załuski Library.
