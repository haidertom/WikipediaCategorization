'''''Against Method: Outline of an Anarchist Theory of Knowledge''''' is a 1975 book about the philosophy of science by [[Paul Feyerabend]], in which the author argues that science is an anarchic enterprise, not a nomic (customary) one.&lt;ref&gt;Feyerabend, Paul. Against Method. 4th ed., New York, NY: Verso Books, 2010, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of this work, the term anarchy refers to [[epistemological anarchism|epistemological anarchy]].

== Content ==
Feyerabend divides his argument into an abstract critique followed by a number of historical case studies.&lt;ref name="feyer7"&gt;Feyerabend, ''Against Method'', 4th ed., p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The abstract critique is a [[reductio ad absurdum]] of methodological monism (the belief that only a single methodology can produce [[scientific progress]]).&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, Elisabeth. "Feyerabend, Mill, and Pluralism", ''Philosophy of Science'' 64, p. S397.&lt;/ref&gt; Feyerabend goes on to identify four features of methodological monism: the principle of [[Falsifiability|falsification]],&lt;ref&gt;Feyerabend, ''Against Method'', 4th ed., p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; a demand for increased empirical content,&lt;ref&gt;Feyerabend, ''Against Method'', 4th ed., p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; the forbidding of [[ad hoc]] hypotheses&lt;ref&gt;Feyerabend, ''Against Method'', 4th ed., p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[consistency]] condition.&lt;ref&gt;Feyerabend, ''Against Method'', 4th ed., p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; He then demonstrates that these features imply that science could not progress, hence an absurdity for proponents of the [[scientific method]].

The historical case studies also act as a [[reductio ad absurdum|reductio]].&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, "Feyerabend, Mill, and Pluralism", p. S397.&lt;/ref&gt; Feyerabend takes the premise that [[Galileo|Galileo's]] advancing of a [[heliocentric]] cosmology was an example of scientific progress. He then demonstrates that Galileo did not adhere to the conditions of methodological monism. Feyerabend also argues that, if Galileo had adhered to the conditions of methodological monism, then he could not have advanced a heliocentric cosmology. This implies that scientific progress would have been impaired by methodological monism. Again, an absurdity for proponents of the scientific method.&lt;ref&gt;Feyerabend, ''Against Method'', 4th ed., p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

Feyerabend summarises his [[reductio ad absurdum|reductios]] with the phrase "anything goes". This is his sarcastic imitation of "the terrified reaction of a rationalist who takes a closer look at history".&lt;ref&gt;Feyerabend, ''Against Method'', 3rd ed., p. vii&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scholarly reception ==

Some have seen the publication of ''Against Method'' as leading to Feyerabend's isolation from the community of philosophers of science, who objected to his view that there is no such thing as the scientific method.&lt;ref&gt;Preston, John, ''Feyerabend: Philosophy, Science and Society'', p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

== Editions and translations ==
The first edition of ''Against Method'' went through several reprintings until the revised (second) edition came out in 1988. A further revision produced a third edition in 1993. The most recent edition, the fourth, was published by [[Verso Books]], in 2010, with a new introduction by [[Ian Hacking]].

A French translation by Baudouin Jurdant and Agnes Schlumberger was published by [[Éditions du Seuil]] in 1979, as ''Contre la méthode : esquisse d'une théorie anarchiste de la connaissance''. {{ISBN|2-02-005370-5}}

The German translation by [[Hermann Vetter]] was abridged and reworked by Feyerabend, whose native language was German. It was published by [[Suhrkamp Verlag]] in 1983 as ''Wider den Methodenzwang. Skizzen einer anarchistischen Erkenntnistheorie''. This translation went into a paperback edition in 1986, as part of the ''suhrkamp taschenbuch wissenschaft'' series, and has been reprinted several times.

A Dutch translation by Hein Kray was published by Boom in 1977, with the title ''In strijd met de methode''. In 2008 a new translation by Marjolijn Stoltenkamp was published, as ''Tegen de methode''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35139">'''Agricultural pollution''' refers to [[biotic material|biotic]] and [[abiotic]] byproducts of [[agriculture|farming]] practices that result in [[pollution|contamination or degradation]] of the environment and surrounding ecosystems, and/or cause injury to humans and their economic interests. The pollution may come from a variety of sources, ranging from [[point source pollution|point source water pollution]] (from a single discharge point) to more diffuse, landscape-level causes, also known as [[non-point source pollution]]. Management practices play a crucial role in the amount and impact of these pollutants. Management techniques range from animal management and housing to the spread of [[pesticide]]s and [[fertilizer]]s in global agricultural practices.

==Abiotic sources==
===Pesticides===
[[File:Cropduster spraying pesticides.jpg|thumb|alt=Cropduster spraying pesticides.|[[Aerial application]] of [[pesticide]].]]
[[Pesticides]] and [[herbicides]] are applied to agricultural land to control pests that disrupt crop production. [[Soil contamination]] can occur when pesticides persist and accumulate in soils, which can alter [[Microbial metabolism|microbial processes]], increase plant uptake of the chemical, and also cause [[toxicity]] to soil organisms. The extent to which the pesticides and herbicides persist depends on the compound’s unique chemistry, which affects [[sorption]] dynamics and resulting fate and transport in the soil environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/opp00001/science/efed_databasesdescription.htm |title=Environmental Databases: Ecotoxicity Database |website=Pesticides: Science and Policy |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C. |date=2006-06-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140704074226/http://www.epa.gov/opp00001/science/efed_databasesdescription.htm |archive-date=2014-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pesticides can also accumulate in animals that eat contaminated pests and soil organisms. In addition, pesticides can be more harmful to beneficial insects, such as pollinators, and to natural enemies of pests (i.e. insects that prey on or parasitize pests) than they are to the target pests themselves.&lt;ref name="Gullan"&gt;Gullan, P.J. and Cranston, P.S. (2010) The Insects: An Outline of Entomology, 4th Edition. Blackwell Publishing UK: 584 pp.{{page needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pesticide leaching====
Pesticide leaching occurs when pesticides mix with water and move through the soil, ultimately [[Groundwater pollution|contaminating groundwater]]. The amount of leaching is correlated with particular soil and pesticide characteristics and the degree of rainfall and irrigation. Leaching is most likely to happen if using a water-soluble pesticide, when the soil tends to be sandy in texture; if excessive watering occurs just after pesticide application; if the adsorption ability of the pesticide to the soil is low. Leaching may not only originate from treated fields, but also from pesticide mixing areas, pesticide application machinery washing sites, or disposal areas.&lt;ref name="agf"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.agf.gov.bc.ca/pesticides/c_2.htm |title=Environmental Fate of Pesticides |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=Pesticide Wise |publisher=British Columbia Ministry of Agriculture |location=Victoria, BC |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151225091304/http://www.agf.gov.bc.ca/pesticides/c_2.htm |archive-date=2015-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fertilizers===
Only a fraction of the [[nitrogen]]-based fertilizers is converted to produce and other plant matter. The remainder accumulates in the soil or lost as [[surface runoff|runoff]]. High application rates of nitrogen-containing fertilizers combined with the high water-solubility of [[nitrate]] leads to increased runoff into surface water as well as leaching into groundwater, thereby causing [[groundwater pollution]]. The excessive use of nitrogen-containing fertilizers (be they synthetic or natural) is particularly damaging, as much of the nitrogen that is not taken up by plants is transformed into nitrate which is easily leached. Nitrate levels above 10&amp;nbsp;mg/L (10 ppm) in groundwater can cause "[[blue baby syndrome]]" (acquired methemoglobinemia). The nutrients, especially nitrates, in fertilizers can cause problems for natural habitats and for human health if they are washed off soil into watercourses or leached through soil into groundwater.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Moreover, the abuse of fertilizers caused air pollution in the form of ammonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tsigaridis|first1=Kostas|last2=Miller|first2=Ron|title=A Major Source of Air Pollution: Farms|url=http://www.earth.columbia.edu/articles/view/3281|website=Earth Institute Columbia University|accessdate=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Cadmium
The concentration of [[cadmium]] in [[phosphorus]]-containing fertilizers varies considerably and can be problematic. For example, mono-ammonium phosphate fertilizer may have a cadmium content of as low as 0.14&amp;nbsp;mg/kg or as high as 50.9&amp;nbsp;mg/kg. This is because the [[phosphate rock]] used in their manufacture can contain as much as 188&amp;nbsp;mg/kg cadmium (examples are deposits on Nauru and the Christmas islands). Continuous use of high-cadmium fertilizer can contaminate soil and plants. Limits to the cadmium content of phosphate fertilizers has been considered by the [[European Commission]]. Producers of phosphorus-containing fertilizers now select phosphate rock based on the cadmium content.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

;Fluoride
Phosphate rocks contain high levels of [[fluoride]]. Consequently, the widespread use of phosphate fertilizers has increased soil fluoride concentrations. It has been found that food contamination from fertilizer is of little concern as plants accumulate little fluoride from the soil; of greater concern is the possibility of fluoride toxicity to livestock that ingest contaminated soils. Also of possible concern are the effects of fluoride on soil microorganisms.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

;Radioactive elements
The radioactive content of the fertilizers varies considerably and depends both on their concentrations in the parent mineral and on the fertilizer production process. [[Uranium-238]] concentrations range can range from 7 to 100 pCi/g in phosphate rock and from 1 to 67 pCi/g in phosphate fertilizers. Where high annual rates of phosphorus fertilizer are used, this can result in uranium-238 concentrations in soils and drainage waters that are several times greater than are normally present. However, the impact of these increases on the risk to human health from radinuclide contamination of foods is very small (less than 0.05 mSv/y).{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

;Other metals
[[Steel industry]] wastes, which are recycled into fertilizers for their high levels of [[zinc]] (essential to plant growth), can include the following toxic metals: [[lead]], [[arsenic]], cadmium, [[chromium]], and [[nickel]]. The most common toxic elements in this type of fertilizer are [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], lead, and arsenic. These potentially harmful impurities can be removed; however, this significantly increases cost. Highly pure fertilizers are widely available and perhaps best known as the highly water-soluble fertilizers containing blue dyes used around households, such as [[Miracle-Gro]]. These highly water-soluble fertilizers are used in the plant nursery business and are available in larger packages at significantly less cost than retail quantities. There are also some inexpensive retail granular garden fertilizers made with high purity ingredients.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

====Leaching, runoff, and eutrophication====
[[File:Potomac river eutro.jpg|thumb|alt=The bright green water in the Potomac River estuary is result of a dense bloom of cyanobacteria.|[[Eutrophication]] of the [[Potomac River]].]]
The [[nitrogen]] (N) and [[phosphorus]] (P) applied to agricultural land (via synthetic fertilizers, composts, manures, biosolids, etc.) can provide valuable plant nutrients. However, if not managed correctly, excess N and P can have negative environmental consequences. Excess N supplied by both synthetic fertilizers (as highly soluble nitrate) and organic sources such as [[manure]]s (whose organic N is mineralized to nitrate by soil microorganisms) can lead to groundwater contamination of nitrate. Nitrate-contaminated drinking water can cause [[blue baby syndrome]]. Together with excess P from these same fertilizer sources, [[eutrophication]] can occur downstream due to excess nutrient supply, leading to [[anoxic waters|anoxic]] areas called dead zones.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

====Organic contaminants====
[[Manures]] and [[biosolids]] contain many nutrients consumed by animals and humans in the form of food. The practice of returning such waste products to agricultural land presents an opportunity to recycle soil nutrients. The challenge is that manures and biosolids contain not only nutrients such as carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus, but they may also contain contaminants, including pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). There is a wide variety and vast quantity of PPCPs consumed by both humans and animals, and each has unique chemistry in terrestrial and aquatic environments. As such, not all have been assessed for their effects on soil, water, and air quality. The [[US Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has surveyed sewage sludge from wastewater treatment plants across the US to assess levels of various PPCPs present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/biosolids/sewage-sludge-surveys |title=Sewage Sludge Surveys |publisher=EPA |website=Biosolids |date=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heavy metals===
The major inputs of [[heavy metals]] (e.g. lead, cadmium, arsenic, mercury) into agricultural systems are fertilizers, organic wastes such as manures, and industrial byproduct wastes. Some farming techniques, such as irrigation, can lead to accumulation of [[selenium]] (Se) that occurs naturally in the soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ganje |first1=T. J. |chapter=Selenium |year=1966 |editor1-last=Chapman |editor1-first=H. D. |title=Diagnostic Criteria for Plants and Soils |pages=394–404 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can result in downstream water reservoirs containing concentrations of selenium that are toxic to wildlife, livestock, and humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0147-6513(03)00064-2 |pmid=15041249 |title=Review of 15 years of research on ecotoxicology and remediation of land contaminated by agricultural drainage sediment rich in selenium |journal=Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety |volume=57 |issue=3 |pages=257–69 |year=2004 |last1=Wu |first1=Lin }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This process is known as the “Kesterson Effect,” eponymously named after the [[Kesterson Reservoir]] in the [[San Joaquin Valley]] (California, USA), which was declared a toxic waste dump in 1987.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

===Land management===
====Tillage and nitrous oxide emissions====
Natural soil biogeochemical processes result in the emission of various greenhouse gases, including nitrous oxide. Agricultural management practices can affect emission levels. For example, tillage levels have also been shown to affect [[nitrous oxide]] emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2134/jeq1998.00472425002700030029x |title=Nitrous Oxide Emission in Three Years as Affected by Tillage, Corn-Soybean-Alfalfa Rotations, and Nitrogen Fertilization |journal=Journal of Environment Quality |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=698–703 |year=1998 |last1=MacKenzie |first1=A. F |last2=Fan |first2=M. X |last3=Cadrin |first3=F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Soil erosion - geograph.org.uk - 1135515.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Soil erosion|Soil erosion: soil has washed from a ploughed field through this gate and into a watercourse beyond.]]

====Soil erosion and sedimentation====
Agriculture contributes greatly to [[soil erosion]] and [[sediment]] deposition through intensive management or inefficient land cover.&lt;ref&gt;Committee on Long-Range Soil and Water Conservation, National Research Council. 1993. Soil and Water Quality: An Agenda for Agriculture. National Academy Press: Washington, D.C.{{page needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that agricultural land degradation is leading to an irreversible decline in fertility on about 6 million ha of fertile land each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dudal |first1=R. |year=1981 |chapter=An evaluation of conservation needs |pages=3–12 |title=Soil Conservation, Problems and Prospects |editor1-first=R. P. C. |editor1-last=Morgan |location=Chichester, U.K. |publisher=Wiley }}&lt;/ref&gt; The accumulation of [[sediment]]s (i.e. sedimentation) in [[Surface runoff|runoff]] water affects water quality in various ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Matt |last1=Hangsleben |first2=David |last2=Suh |date=November 30, 2006 |title=Sediment Pollution |url=http://www3.abe.iastate.edu/tsm424/TSM424TermProj2006/HangslebenSuhFinalPaper.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915085504/http://www3.abe.iastate.edu/tsm424/TSM424TermProj2006/HangslebenSuhFinalPaper.pdf |archivedate=September 15, 2012 }}{{self-published inline|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sedimentation can decrease the transport capacity of ditches, streams, rivers, and navigation channels. It can also limit the amount of light penetrating the water, which affects aquatic biota. The resulting turbidity from sedimentation can interfere with feeding habits of fishes, affecting population dynamics. Sedimentation also affects the transport and accumulation of pollutants, including phosphorus and various pesticides.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

==Biotic sources==
===Greenhouse gases from fecal waste===
The United Nations [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) predicted that 18% of anthropogenic greenhouse gases come directly or indirectly from the world’s livestock. This report also suggested that the emissions from livestock were greater than that of the transportation sector. While livestock do currently play a role in producing greenhouse gas emissions, the estimates have been argued to be a misrepresentation. While the FAO used a life cycle assessment of animal agriculture (i.e. all aspects including emissions from growing crops for feed, transportation to slaughter, etc.), they did not apply the same assessment for the transportation sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1016/S0065-2113(09)03001-6 |chapter=Clearing the Air: Livestock's Contribution to Climate Change |volume=103 |pages=1–40 |title=Advances in Agronomy |year=2009 |last1=Pitesky |first1=Maurice E |last2=Stackhouse |first2=Kimberly R |last3=Mitloehner |first3=Frank M |isbn=978-0-12-374819-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A PNAS model showed that even if animals were completely removed from U.S. agriculture and diets, U.S. GHG emissions would be decreased by 2.6% only (or 28% of agricultural GHG emissions). This is because of the need replace animal manures by fertilizers and to replace also other animal coproducts, and because livestock now use human-inedible food and fiber processing byproducts. Moreover, people would suffer from a greater number of deficiencies in essential nutrients although they would get a greater excess of energy, possibly leading to greater obesity.&lt;ref name=pnas&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/114/48/E10301.full|title=Nutritional and greenhouse gas impacts of removing animals from US agriculture|date=Nov 13, 2017|volume=114|issue=48|doi=10.1073/pnas.1707322114|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biopesticides===
[[Biopesticides]] are pesticides derived from natural materials (animals, plants, microorganisms, certain minerals).&lt;ref name="Pedigoand"&gt;L. P. Pedigo, and M. Rice. 2009. Entomology and Pest Management, 6th Edition. Prentice Hall: 816 pp.{{page needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an alternative to traditional pesticides, biopesticides can reduce overall agricultural pollution because they are safe to handle, usually do not strongly affect beneficial invertebrates or vertebrates, and have a short residual time.&lt;ref name="Pedigoand" /&gt; Some concerns exist that biopesticides may have negative impacts on populations of nontarget species, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10123-003-0144-x |pmid=12955583 |title=Development, registration and commercialization of microbial pesticides for plant protection |journal=International Microbiology |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=245–52 |year=2003 |last1=Montesinos |first1=Emilio }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, biopesticides are regulated by EPA. Because biopesticides are less harmful and have fewer environmental effects than other pesticides, the agency does not require as much data to register their use. Many biopesticides are permitted under the [[National Organic Program]], [[United States Department of Agriculture]], standards for organic crop production.&lt;ref name="Pedigoand" /&gt;

===Introduced species===
====Invasive species====
{{main|Invasive species}}
[[File:Yellow star thistle.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Yellow Star Thistle.|''[[Centaurea solstitialis]]'', an aggressively invasive weed, was probably introduced to North America in contaminated fodder seed. Agricultural practices such as tilling and livestock grazing aided in its rapid spread. It is toxic to horses, prevents native plants from growing (decreasing biodiversity and degrading natural ecosystems), and is a physical barrier to the migration of indigenous animals.]]
The increasing [[globalization]] of agriculture has resulted in the accidental transport of pests, weeds, and diseases to novel ranges. If they establish, they become an invasive species that can impact populations of native species&lt;ref name="Mooney"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.091093398 |pmid=11344292 |pmc=33232 |title=The evolutionary impact of invasive species |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=98 |issue=10 |pages=5446–51 |year=2001 |last1=Mooney |first1=H. A |last2=Cleland |first2=E. E |bibcode=2001PNAS...98.5446M }}&lt;/ref&gt; and threaten agricultural production.&lt;ref name="Gullan" /&gt; For example, the transport of [[bumble bee]]s reared in Europe and shipped to the United States and/or Canada for use as commercial [[pollinator]]s has led to the introduction of an Old World parasite to the New World.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/135295/0 |title=Bombus franklini (Franklin's Bumble Bee) |publisher=Iucnredlist.org |date=2008-01-01 |accessdate=2013-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This introduction may play a role in recent native bumble bee declines in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thorp |first1=R.W. |first2=M.D. |last2=Shepherd |year=2005 |chapter=Profile: Subgenus Bombus Lateille 1802 (Apidae: Apinae: Bombini) |editor1-first=M.D. |editor1-last=Shepherd |editor2-first=D.M. |editor2-last=Vaughan |editor3-first=S.H. |editor3-last=Black |title=Red list of pollinator insects of North America |publisher=Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation |location=Portland, OR }}{{page needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agriculturally introduced species can also [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]ize with native species resulting in a decline in genetic [[biodiversity]] &lt;ref name="Mooney" /&gt; and threaten agricultural production.&lt;ref name="Gullan" /&gt;

Habitat [[disturbance (ecology)]] associated with farming practices themselves can also facilitate the establishment of these introduced organisms. Contaminated machinery, livestock and fodder, and contaminated crop or pasture seed can also lead to the spread of weeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weeds.gov.au/management/prevention.htm |title=Weeds in Australia home page |publisher=Weeds.gov.au |date=2013-06-12 |accessdate=2013-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quarantines (see [[biosecurity]] )are one way in which prevention of the spread of invasive species can be regulated at the policy level. A quarantine is a legal instrument that restricts the movement of infested material from areas where an invasive species is present to areas in which it is absent.
The [[World Trade Organization]] has international regulations concerning the quarantine of pests and diseases under the [[Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures]]. Individual countries often have their own quarantine regulations. In the United States, for example, the [[United States Department of Agriculture]]/[[Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service]] (USDA/APHIS) administers domestic (within the United States) and foreign (importations from outside the United States) quarantines. These quarantines are enforced by inspectors at state borders and ports of entry.&lt;ref name="Pedigoand" /&gt;

====Biological control====
The use of [[biological pest control]] agents, or using predators, [[parasitoid]]s, parasites, and pathogens to control agricultural pests, has the potential to reduce agricultural pollution associated with other pest control techniques, such as pesticide use. The merits of introducing non-native biocontrol agents have been widely debated, however. Once released, the introduction of a biocontrol agent can be irreversible. Potential ecological issues could include the dispersal from agricultural habitats into natural environments, and host-switching or adapting to utilize a native species. In addition, predicting the interaction outcomes in complex ecosystems and potential ecological impacts prior to release can be difficult. One example of a biocontrol program that resulted in ecological damage occurred in North America, where a parasitoid of butterflies was introduced to control [[gypsy moth]] and browntail moth.  This parasitoid is capable of utilizing many butterfly host species, and likely resulted in the decline and extirpation of several native silk moth species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.ento.48.060402.102800 |pmid=12208812 |title=Nontarget effects—the Achilles' heel of biological control? Retrospective analyses to reduce risk associated with biocontrol introductions |journal=Annual Review of Entomology |volume=48 |pages=365–96 |year=2003 |last1=Louda |first1=S.M |last2=Pemberton |first2=R.W |last3=Johnson |first3=M.T |last4=Follett |first4=P.A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

International exploration for potential biocontrol agents is aided by agencies such as the European Biological Control Laboratory, the United States Department of Agriculture/[[Agricultural Research Service]] (USDA/ARS), the Commonwealth Institute of Biological Control, and the [[International Organization for Biological Control]] of Noxious Plants and Animals.  In order to prevent agricultural pollution, quarantine and extensive research on the organism’s potential efficacy and ecological impacts are required prior to introduction. If approved, attempts are made to colonize and disperse the biocontrol agent in appropriate agricultural settings. Continual evaluations on their efficacy are conducted.&lt;ref name="Pedigoand" /&gt;

===Genetically modified organisms (GMO)===

Bottom: After only a few bites of peanut leaves of this genetically engineered plant (containing the genes of the Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) bacteria), this lesser cornstalk borer larva crawled off the leaf and died. (Image Number K8664-1)-Photo by Herb Pilcher.|(Top) Non transgenic peanut leaves showing extensive damage from [[European corn borer]] larvae. (Bottom) Peanut leaves genetically engineered to produce Bt toxins are protected from herbivory damage.]]

====Genetic contamination and ecological effects====
GMO crops can, however, result in genetic contamination of native plant species through hybridization. This could lead to increased weediness of the plant or the extinction of the native species. In addition, the [[transgenic]] plant itself may become a weed if the modification improves its fitness in a given environment.&lt;ref name="Gullan" /&gt;

There are also concerns that non-target organisms, such as [[pollinator]]s and natural enemies, could be poisoned by accidental ingestion of Bt-producing plants. A recent study testing the effects of Bt corn pollen dusting nearby milkweed plants on larval feeding of the [[monarch butterfly]] found that the threat to populations of the monarch was low.&lt;ref name="Gullan" /&gt;

The use of GMO crop plants engineered for [[herbicide resistance]] can also indirectly increase the amount of agricultural pollution associated with [[herbicide]] use. For example, the increased use of herbicide in herbicide-resistant corn fields in the mid-western United States is decreasing the amount of milkweeds available for [[monarch butterfly]] larvae.&lt;ref name="Gullan" /&gt;

[[Regulation of the release of genetic modified organisms]] vary based on the type of organism and the country concerned.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

====GMO as a tool of pollution reduction====
While there may be some concerns regarding the use of GM products, it may also be the solution to some of the existing animal agriculture pollution issues.  One of the main sources of pollution, particularly vitamin and mineral drift in soils, comes from a lack of digestive efficiency in animals.  By improving digestive efficiency, it is possible to minimize both the cost of animal production and the environmental damage.  One successful example of this technology and its potential application is the [[Enviropig]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

The [[Enviropig]] is a genetically modified Yorkshire pig that expresses [[phytase]] in its saliva. Grains, such as corn and wheat, have phosphorus that is bound in a naturally indigestible form known as phytic acid. [[Phosphorus]], an essential nutrient for pigs, is then added to the diet, since it can not be broken down in the pigs digestive tract.  As a result, nearly all of the phosphorus naturally found in the grain is wasted in the feces, and can contribute to elevated levels in the soil. Phytase is an enzyme that is able to break down the otherwise indigestible phytic acid, making it available to the pig. The ability of the Enviropig to digest the phosphorus from the grains eliminates the waste of that natural phosphorus (20-60% reduction), while also eliminating the need to supplement the nutrient in feed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/90788 |pmid=11479566 |year=2001 |last1=Golovan |first1=Serguei P |title=Pigs expressing salivary phytase produce low-phosphorus manure |journal=Nature Biotechnology |volume=19 |issue=8 |pages=741–5 |last2=Meidinger |first2=Roy G |last3=Ajakaiye |first3=Ayodele |last4=Cottrill |first4=Michael |last5=Wiederkehr |first5=Miles Z |last6=Barney |first6=David J |last7=Plante |first7=Claire |last8=Pollard |first8=John W |last9=Fan |first9=Ming Z |last10=Hayes |first10=M.

===Animal management===
====Manure management====
{{main|Manure management}}
One of the main contributors to air, soil and [[water pollution]] is animal waste. According to a 2005 report by the USDA, more than 335 million tons of "dry matter" waste (the waste after water is removed) is produced annually on farms in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;USDA Agricultural Research Service. "FY-2005 Annual Report Manure and Byproduct Utilization", 31 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[Animal feeding operation]]s produce about 100 times more manure than the amount of human sewage sludge processed in US municipal waste water plants each year. Diffuse source pollution from agricultural fertilizers is more difficult to trace, monitor and control. High nitrate concentrations are found in groundwater and may reach 50&amp;nbsp;mg/litre (the EU Directive limit). In ditches and river courses, [[nutrient pollution]] from fertilizers causes eutrophication. This is worse in winter, after autumn ploughing has released a surge of nitrates; winter rainfall is heavier increasing runoff and leaching, and there is lower plant uptake. EPA suggests that one dairy farm with 2,500 cows produces as much waste as a city with around 411,000 residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=May 2004 |title=Risk Management Evaluation for Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations |url=https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=901V0100.txt |publisher=EPA |location=Cincinnati, OH |page=7 |id=EPA 600/R-04/042}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Research Council (United States)|US National Research Council]] has identified odors as the most significant animal emission problem at the local level. Different animal systems have adopted several waste management procedures to deal with the large amount of waste produced annually.

The advantages of manure treatment are a reduction in the amount of manure that needs to be transported and applied to crops, as well as reduced soil compaction. Nutrients are reduced as well, meaning that less cropland is needed for manure to be spread upon. Manure treatment can also reduce the risk of human health and biosecurity risks by reducing the amount of pathogens present in manure. Undiluted animal manure or slurry is one hundred times more concentrated than domestic sewage, and can carry an intestinal parasite, ''[[Cryptosporidium]],'' which is difficult to detect but can be passed to humans. [[Silage]] liquor (from fermented wet grass) is even stronger than slurry, with a low pH and very high biological oxygen demand. With a low pH, silage liquor can be highly corrosive; it can attack synthetic materials, causing damage to storage equipment, and leading to accidental spillage. All of these advantages can be optimized by using the right manure management system on the right farm based on the resources that are available.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

====Manure treatment====
=====Composting=====
[[Compost#Animal manure and bedding|Composting]] is a solid manure management system that relies on solid manure from bedded pack pens, or the solids from a liquid manure separator. There are two methods of composting, active and passive. Manure is churned periodically during active composting, whereas in passive composting it is not. Passive composting has been found to have lower green house gas emissions due to incomplete decomposition and lower gas diffusion rates.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

=====Solid-liquid separation=====
Manure can be mechanically separated into a solid and liquid portion for easier management. Liquids (4-8% dry matter) can be used easily in pump systems for convenient spread over crops and the solid fraction (15-30% dry matter) can be used as stall bedding, spread on crops, composted or exported.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

=====Anaerobic digestion and lagoons=====
[[File:Anaerobic Lagoon at Cal Poly.jpg|thumb|Anaerobic lagoon at a dairy]]
[[Anaerobic digestion]] is the biological treatment of liquid animal waste using bacteria in an area absent of air, which promotes the decomposition of organic solids.  Hot water is used to heat the waste in order to increase the rate of biogas production.&lt;ref name="manuremanagement.cornell"/&gt; The remaining liquid is nutrient rich and can be used on fields as a fertilizer and methane gas that can be burned directly on the biogas stove&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.renene.2017.08.068 |title=Current approach to manure management for small-scale Southeast Asian farmers - Using Vietnamese biogas and non-biogas farms as an example |journal=Renewable Energy |volume=115 |pages=362–70 |year=2018 |last1=Roubík |first1=Hynek |last2=Mazancová |first2=Jana |last3=Phung |first3=Le Dinh |last4=Banout |first4=Jan }}&lt;/ref&gt; or in an engine generator to produce electricity and heat.&lt;ref name="manuremanagement.cornell"&gt;{{cite report |date=2005-04-12 |title=Evaluating the Need for a Manure Treatment System |series=Fact Sheet |url=http://www.manuremanagement.cornell.edu/Pages/General_Docs/Fact_Sheets/Evaluating_Need_for_Manure_Treatment_System_factsheet.pdf |publisher=Cornell University Manure Management Program |location=Ithaca, NY |id=MT-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=July 1999 |title=Animal Agriculture: Waste Management Practices |url=http://www.gao.gov/archive/1999/rc99205.pdf |publisher=U.S. General Accounting Office |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=9–11 |id=GAO/RCED-99-205}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methane is about 20 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, which has significant negative environmental effects if not controlled properly.  Anaerobic treatment of waste is the best method for controlling the odor associated with manure management.&lt;ref name="manuremanagement.cornell" /&gt;

[[Anaerobic lagoon|Biological treatment lagoons]] also use anaerobic digestion to break down solids, but at a much slower rate.  Lagoons are kept at ambient temperatures as opposed to the heated digestion tanks.  Lagoons require large land areas and high dilution volumes to work properly, so they do not work well in many climates in the northern United States. Lagoons also offer the benefit of reduced odor and biogas is made available for heat and electric power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=September 2002 |title=Anaerobic Lagoons |series=Wastewater Technology Fact Sheet |url=https://www3.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/alagoons.pdf |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 832-F-02-009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have demonstrated that GHG emissions are reduced using aerobic digestion systems. GHG emission reductions and credits can help compensate for the higher installation cost of cleaner aerobic technologies and facilitate producer adoption of environmentally superior technologies to replace current anaerobic lagoons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.wasman.2007.09.034 |pmid=18060761 |title=Greenhouse gas emission reduction and environmental quality improvement from implementation of aerobic waste treatment systems in swine farms |journal=Waste Management |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=759–66 |year=2008 |last1=Vanotti |first1=M.B |last2=Szogi |first2=A.A |last3=Vives |first3=C.A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Anatomy of Criticism: Four Essays''''' ([[Princeton University Press]], 1957) is a book by Canadian literary critic and theorist, [[Herman Northrop Frye|Northrop Frye]], which attempts to formulate an overall view of the scope, theory, principles, and techniques of [[literary criticism]] derived exclusively from literature. Frye consciously omits all specific and practical criticism, instead offering classically inspired theories of modes, symbols, myths and genres, in what he termed "an interconnected group of suggestions." The literary approach proposed by Frye in ''Anatomy'' was highly influential in the decades before [[deconstruction|deconstructivist criticism]] and other expressions of [[postmodernism]] came to prominence in American academia circa 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Frank Lentricchia]], ''After the New Criticism'' (1980), in which Chapter One, 'The Place of Northrop Frye's ''Anatomy of Criticism'' ', begins by calling the book 'monumental'.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frye's four essays are sandwiched between a "Polemical Introduction" and a "Tentative Conclusion." The four essays are titled "Historical Criticism: A Theory of Modes", "Ethical Criticism: a Theory of [[Symbol]]s", "[[Archetypal]] Criticism: A Theory of [[mythology|Myth]]s", and "Rhetorical Criticism: A Theory of [[Genre]]s."

==Contents==
===Polemical Introduction===
The purpose of the introduction is to defend the need for literary criticism, to distinguish the nature of genuine literary criticism from other forms of criticism, and to clarify the difference between direct experience of literature and the systematic study of literary criticism.

There are a number of reasons why the introduction is labeled as a '[[polemic]]'. In defending the need for literary criticism, Frye opposes a notion common to [[Tolstoy]] and [[Romanticism|Romantic]] thought that 'natural taste' is superior to scholarly learning (and by extension, criticism). Frye also accuses a number of methods of criticism (e.g. [[Marxist]], [[Freud]]ian, [[Carl Jung|Jung]]ian, [[Neoclassicism|Neo-classical]], etc.) as being embodiments of the deterministic fallacy. He is not opposed to these ideologies in particular, but sees the application of any external, ready-made ideology to literature as a departure from genuine criticism. This results in subjecting a work of literature to an individual's pet philosophy and an elevation or demotion of authors according to their conformity to the pet philosophy.

Another point is to distinguish the difference between personal taste and genuine criticism. Personal taste is too easily swayed by the prevailing morals, values and tastes of the critic's society at that point in history. If taste succumbs entirely to such social forces, the result is the same as that of consciously adopting an external ideology described above. Yet even if there is a consensus among critics that the works of [[John Milton]] are more fruitful than [[R. D. Blackmore]] (to use Frye's example), a critic contributes little by saying so. In other words, value judgments contribute little to meaningful criticism.

In place of meaningless criticism, Frye proposes a genuine literary criticism which draws its method from the body of literature itself. Literary criticism ought to be a systematic study of works of literature, just as physics is of nature and history is of human action. Frye makes the explicit assumption that in order for systematic study to be possible, the body of literature must already possess a systematic nature. Frye claims that we know very little about this system as yet and that the systematic study of literature has progressed little since [[Aristotle]].

Frye concludes his introduction by addressing the weaknesses of his argument. He mentions that the introduction is a polemic, but written in first person to acknowledge the individual nature of his views. He concedes that the following essays can only give a preliminary, and likely inexact, glimpse of the system of literature. He admits to making sweeping generalities that will often prove false in light of particular examples. Finally, he stresses that while many feel an "emotional repugnance" to schematization of [[poetry]], the schematization should be regarded as an aspect of criticism, not the vibrant, personal, direct experience of the work itself—much as the geologist turns away from his or her systematic work to enjoy the beauty of the mountains.

==="Historical Criticism: Theory of Modes"===
Frye's systemization of literature begins with three aspects of poetry given by [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'': ''mythos'' (plot), ''ethos'' (characterization/setting), and ''dianoia'' (theme/idea). Frye sees works of literature as lying somewhere on a continuum between being [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] driven, as in most [[fiction]], and [[idea]] driven, as in [[essay]]s and [[Lyrics|lyric]]al poetry. The First essay begins by exploring the different aspects of fiction (subdivided into tragic and comic) in each mode and ends with a similar discussion of thematic literature.

|}

Frye divides his study of tragic, comic, and thematic literature into five "modes", each identified with a specific literary epoch: mythic, romantic, high [[mimesis|mimetic]], low mimetic, and ironic. This categorization is a representation of ''[[ethos]]'', or characterization and relates to how the protagonist is portrayed in respect to the rest of humanity and the protagonist's environment. Frye suggests that Classical civilizations progressed historically through the development of these modes, and that something similar happened in Western civilization during medieval and modern times. He speculates that contemporary fiction may be undergoing a return to myth, completing a full circle through the five modes. Frye argues that when irony is pushed to extremes, it returns to the mode of myth; this concept of the ''recursion'' of [[cyclic history|historical cycles]] is familiar from [[Giambattista Vico]]&lt;ref&gt;Cotrupi, Caterina Nella [https://books.google.com/books?id=rh8gcNF9YXkC ''Northrop Frye and the poetics of process''] p.18&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Oswald Spengler]].&lt;ref&gt;Frye (1991) [https://books.google.com/books?id=RgcnAQAAIAAJ ''Spiritus Mundi: Essays on Literature, Myth, and Society''] p.113 quotation: {{quotation|The demonic aspect of historical time is clearer in Vico than in Spengler, though Vico came later into my readig. In Vico there is also a projecting of authority, first on gods, then on "heroes" or human leaders, then on the people themselves. Vico lived at a time when there had been no permanently successful example of a democracy, and from his study of Roman history he concluded that the people cannot recover the authority they project on others, and hence the third age of the people is followed by a ''ricorso'' that starts the cycle over again. In Spengler there is no general cyclical movement of this kind, but there is one latent in his argument. Spengler's sense of a historically finite culture, exploiting and exhausting a certain range of imaginative possibilities, provided the basis for the conception of modes outlined in the first essay of Anatomy of Criticism. I soon scrapped his loaded term "decline" for a more neutral conception of cultural aging, but his vision of cultural history superseded the onward- and-upward people I had read still earlier in youth, such as Bernard Shaw and HG Wells, who had obviously got it wrong.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pages.prodigy.net/aesir/aoc.htm review]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050403220409/http://pages.prodigy.net/aesir/aoc.htm |date=April 3, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tragedy is concerned with the hero's separation from society.
*Mythic tragedy deals with the death of gods.
*Romantic tragedy features elegies mourning the death of heroes such as [[King Arthur|Arthur]] or [[Beowulf]].
*High mimetic tragedy presents the death of a noble human such as [[Othello]] or [[Oedipus]].
*Low mimetic tragedy shows the death or sacrifice of an ordinary human being and evokes pathos, as with [[Thomas Hardy]]'s [[Tess of the d'Urbervilles|Tess]] or [[Henry James]]'s [[Daisy Miller]].
*The ironic mode often shows the death or suffering of a protagonist who is both weak and pitiful compared to the rest of humanity and the protagonist's environment; [[Franz Kafka]]'s works provide many examples of such. At other times, the protagonist is not necessarily weaker than the average person yet suffers severe persecution at the hands of a deranged society. [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s Hester Prynne, and Hardy's Tess exemplify this treatment.

Comedy is concerned with integration of society.
*Mythic comedy deals with acceptance into the society of gods, often through a number of trials as with [[Hercules]] or through [[salvation]] or assumption as in the [[Bible]].
*In romantic comic modes, the setting is pastoral or idyllic, and there is an integration of the hero with an idealized simplified form of nature.
*High mimetic comedy involves a strong central protagonist who constructs his or her own society by brute force, fending off all opposition until the protagonist ends up with all honor and riches due him or her—the plays of [[Aristophanes]] or something like [[Shakespeare]]'s [[Prospero]] are examples.
*Low mimetic comedy often shows the social elevation of the hero or heroine and often ends in marriage.
*Ironic comedy is perhaps more difficult, and Frye devotes a good deal more space to this than the other comedic modes. At one extreme, ironic comedy borders on savagery, the inflicting of pain on a helpless victim. Some examples of this include tales of [[Lynching|lynch mob]]s, [[Crime fiction|murder mysteries]], or human sacrifice. Yet ironic comedy may also offer biting satire of a society replete with snobbery. It may even depict a protagonist rejected by society (thus failing the typical comic reintegration) yet who appears wiser than the rejecting society. Aristophanes, [[Ben Jonson]], [[Molière]], [[Henry Fielding]], [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]], and [[Graham Greene]] offer examples of the wide range of ironic comic possibility.

Finally, Frye explores the nature of thematic literature in each mode. Here, the intellectual content is more important than the plot, so these modes are organized by what is considered more authoritative or educational at the time. Also, these modes tend to organize by societal structure.
*In the mythical mode scripture, literature claiming divine inspiration is prevalent.
*In the romantic, the gods have retreated to the sky and it is up to chroniclers in a nomadic society to remember the lists of names of the patriarchs, the proverbs, traditions, charms, deeds, etc.
*In the high mimetic mode society is structured around a capital city, and "national" epics such as ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' and ''[[The Lusiad]]'' are typical.
*In the low mimetic, thematic exposition tends toward individualism and romanticism. The individual author's own thoughts and ideas are now the center of authority, as instanced by [[William Wordsworth]]'s ''[[The Prelude|Prelude]]''.
*Finally, in the ironic mode, the poet figures as a mere observer rather than an authoritative commentator, producing writing that tends to emphasize discontinuity and anti-epiphany. [[T. S. Eliot]]'s ''[[The Waste Land]]'' and [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' exemplify this thematic mode.

==="Ethical Criticism: Theory of Symbols"===
Now that Frye has established his theory of modes, he proposes five levels, or ''phases'', of symbolism, each phase independently possessing its own ''mythos'', ethos, and ''dianoia'' as laid out in the first essay. These phases are based on the four levels of [[medieval allegory]] (the first two phases constituting the first level). Also, Frye relates the five phases with the ages of man laid out in the first essay. Frye defines a literary symbol as: "[A]ny unit of any literary structure that can be isolated for critical attention."

Symbolic phases:
* Literal/descriptive (motifs and signs)
* Formal (image)
* Mythical (archetype)
* Anagogic (monad)

The '''descriptive''' phase exhibits the centrifugal, or outward, property of a symbol. For example, when a word such as 'cat' evokes a definition, image, experience or any property connected with the word 'cat' external to the literary context of the particular usage, we have the word taken in the descriptive sense. Frye labels any such symbol a ''sign''. He does not define the sign beyond this sense of pointing to the external, nor does he refer to any particular semiotic theory. In opposition to the sign stands the ''motif'' which is a symbol taken in the '''literal''' phase. This phase demonstrates the inward, or centripetal, direction of meaning, best described as the contextual meaning of the symbol. To Frye, ''literal'' means nearly the opposite of its usage in common speech; to say that something "literally" means something generally involves referring to a definition external to the text. Instead, ''literal'' refers to the symbol's meaning in its specific literary situation while ''descriptive'' refers to personal connotation and conventional definition. Finally, Frye draws an analogy between rhythm and harmony with the literal and descriptive phases respectively. The literal phase tends to be horizontal, dependent on what comes before and after the symbol while the descriptive phase tends to be laid out in space, having external meanings that vary in nearness to the contextual meaning.

Frye next introduces the '''formal''' phase, embodied by the image, in order to define the layer of meaning that results from the interplay of the harmony and rhythm of the signs and motifs. The  most frequently repeated imagery sets the tone of the work (as with the color red in ''[[Macbeth]]''), with less repeated imagery working in contrast with this tonal background. This section of the essay gives a faithful representation of literary formalism (also known as [[New Criticism]]). Frye's representation of formalism here is unique; however, its setting as part of the larger system of literary criticism Frye outlines in the entire work. The notion of form (and perhaps Frye's literal phase) relies heavily on the assumption of inherent meaning within the text—a point contested by deconstructionist critics.

The '''mythical''' phase is the treatment of a symbol as an archetype. This concept relates most closely with [[intertextuality]] and considers the symbol in a work as interconnected with similar symbolism throughout the entire body of literature. While Frye deals with myths and archetypes from a broader perspective in the third essay, in this section he focuses on the critical method of tracing a symbol's heritage through literary works both prior and subsequent to the work in question. Frye argues that convention is a vital part of literature and that copyright  is deleterious to the process of literary creation. Frye points to the use of convention in Shakespeare and Milton as examples to strengthen his argument that even verbatim copying of text and plot does not entail a death of creativity. Further, Frye argues that romantic, anti-conventional writers such as [[Walt Whitman]] tend to follow convention anyway. In criticism, the study of the archetypal phase of a symbol is akin to the "nature" perspective in the psychological debate over [[nature versus nurture]]. Rather than viewing the symbol as a unique achievement of the author or some inherent quality of the text, the archetypeal phase situates the symbol in its society of literary kindred as a product of its conventional forebears.

Finally, Frye proposes an '''anagogic''' phase wherein a symbol is treated as a monad. The anagogic level of medieval allegory treated a text as expressing the highest spiritual meaning. For example, Dante's Beatrice in the [[Divine Comedy]] would represent the bride of Christ. Frye makes the argument that not only is there a lateral connection of archetypes through intertextuality, but that there is a transcendent almost spiritual unity within the body of literature. Frye describes the anagogic in literature as "the imitation of infinite social action and infinite human thought, the mind of a man who is all men, the universal creative word which is all words."

==="Archetypal Criticism: Theory of Myths"===
Frye begins the essay regarding [[myth]] as the source of all [[literature]] (as a visual, auditory and textual art form), paintings (as visual art form) and music (as an auditory art form). The underlying structures and patterns of all these forms are similar, though they have a unique style of their own.

The third essay is the culmination of Frye's theory in that it unites the elements of characterization and each of the five symbolic phases presented in the first two essays into an organic whole. This whole is organized around a metaphor of human desire and frustration as manifested in the [[Great Chain of Being]] (divine, human, animal, vegetable, mineral and water) by analogy to the four [[season]]s.

At one pole we have apocalyptic imagery which typifies the revelation of [[heaven]] and ultimate [[wikt:fulfillment|fulfillment]] of human desire. In this state, the literary structure points toward unification of all things in a single analogical symbol. The ultimate of the divine is the deity, of the human is [[Christ]] (or any other being that embodies the oneness of humanity in its spiritual culmination), of the animal is the [[Domestic sheep|lamb]], of the vegetable is the [[Tree of life|Tree of Life]] or [[vine]], and of the mineral is the [[New Jerusalem|heavenly Jerusalem]] or city of God.

At the opposite pole lies [[demon]]ic imagery which typifies the unfulfillment, perverion, or opposition of human desire. In this state, things tend toward [[anarchy]] or [[tyranny]]. The divine is an angry, inscrutable God demanding sacrifice, the human is the tyrannical [[anti-christ|anti-Christ]], the animal is a predator such as a [[lion]], the vegetable is the evil wood as found at the beginning of Dante's ''[[Divine Comedy|Inferno]]'' or Hawthorne's "[[Young Goodman Brown]]", and the city is the [[dystopia]] embodied by [[George Orwell|Orwell]]'s ''1984'' or [[Kafka]]'s ''[[The Castle (novel)|The Castle]]''.

Finally we have the analogical imagery, or more simply, depictions of states that are similar to paradise or [[hell]], but not identical. There is a great deal of variety in the imagery of these structures, but tame animals and wise rulers are common in structures analogical to the apocalyptic (analogy of innocence), while predatory aristocrats and masses living in squalor characterize analogy to the demonic (analogy of experience).

Frye then identifies the mythical mode with the apocalyptic, the ironic with the demonic, and the romantic and [[Mimesis|low mimetic]] with their respective analogies. The [[Mimesis|high mimetic]], then, occupies the center of all four. This ordering allows Frye to place the modes in a circular structure and point to the cyclical nature of myth and archetypes. In this setting, literature represents the natural cycle of birth, growth, maturity, decline, death, [[resurrection]], rebirth, and the repetition of the cycle. The remainder of the chapter deals with the cycle of the four seasons as embodied by four mythoi: [[comedy]], [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]], [[tragedy]], and [[irony]] or [[satire]].

==="Rhetorical Criticism: Theory of Genres"===
In the first three essays, Frye deals mainly with the first three elements of Aristotle's elements of poetry (i.e. mythos, ethos, dianoia). In the fourth essay, he explores the last three elements:
* ''melos'' - the element dealing with the tonal, musical aspect of literature
* ''lexis'' - the written word, lying somewhere between musical and visual aspects. It may be referred to as diction (ear) or imagery (eye) depending on the critical focus.
* ''opsis'' - the element dealing with visual aspects of literature

Whereas mythos is the verbal imitation of action and dianoia the verbal imitation of thought (ethos being composed of the two), melos and opsis (with lexis composed of the two) correspond, though seen from a different (rhetorical) perspective. Frye identifies the connection as such: "The world of social action and event . . . has a particularly strong association with the ear. . . . The world of individual thought and idea has a correspondingly close connection with the eye . . ." (Frye, 243).

Rhetoric means two things: ornamental (opsis) speech and persuasive (melos) speech. Rhetorical criticism, then, is the exploration of literature in the light of melos, opsis, and their interplay as manifested in lexis.

The ''radical of presentation''—the relation (or idealized relation) between author and audience—is a further consideration. Difference in genre relies not on topical considerations (science fiction, romance, mystery), nor in length (e.g. epics are long, lyrics are short), but in the radical of presentation. As such, Frye proposes a total of four distinct genres:
* epos - Author speaks directly to audience (e.g. story telling, formal speech).
* fiction - Author and audience are hidden from each other (e.g. most novels).
* drama - Author is hidden from the audience; audience experiences content directly.
* lyric - Audience is "hidden" from author; that is, the speaker is "overheard" by hearers.

These four genres form the organizing principle of the essay, first examining the distinctive kind of rhythm of each, then looking at specific forms of each more closely. As Frye describes each genre, he explains the function of melos and opsis in each. To understand Frye's melos, it is important to note{{According to whom|date=May 2011}} his counter-intuitive usage of the term "musical". He contends that the common usage of the term is inaccurate for purposes of criticism, drawn from analogy with harmony, a stable relationship. Music, however, does not consist of a plastic, static, continuously stable relationship, but rather a series of dissonances resolving at the end into a stable relationship. Poetry containing little dissonance, then, has more in common with the plastic arts than with music.

The original presentation of the epic was ''ta epe'' (that which is spoken), and when an author, speaker, or storyteller addresses a visible audience directly, we have epos. The rhythm of epos is that of recurrence (i.e. accent, meter, sound patterns). These are the rhythms most commonly associated with poetry.

"Fiction" is a vague term which Frye uses to avoid introducing too many new terms. Part of the difficulty comes from fact that this is the only of the four genres which has no precedent in antiquity. He acknowledges having used the term previously in a different sense. In this essay, the term refers to literature in which the author addresses the audience through a book, or more simply stated, prose. The rhythm of prose is that of continuity of meaning.

Drama lies halfway between epos and fiction, or more accurately, its diction must fit the setting and the character. Some characters may be melos-oriented, speaking in meter or with various rhetorical effects in song and banter. Others may be opsis-oriented, speaking more in prose and conveying ideological content. Most characters alternate according to the dramatic situation. Such a marriage of the appropriate language with the character and setting (ethos) defines a rhythm of decorum, the distinctive rhythm of drama.

Classical lyrical poetry often presents a shepherd speaking of his love; he is overheard by his audience. However, the distinctiveness of lyric comes more from its peculiar rhythm than from this radical of representation. Frye describes this rhythm as associative rather than logical and is the stuff of dreams and the subconscious. It is closely related to the chant, and though it is found in all literature, it is more apparent in certain kinds of literature than others. At this point Frye suggests a connection between the four historical modes and the four genres. In this sense, the lyrical is typical of the ironic age—just as the ironic protagonist has turned away from society, the lyrical poet makes utterances without regard to the audience. The lyrical rhythm is very clearly seen in Joyce's ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'', a work based almost entirely on associative babbles and dream utterance.

==Miscellaneous==
* The Latin dedication at the beginning, "Helenae Uxori" is to Northrop's wife, Helen.
* Frye's [[Green World]] theory developed
* [[Bergson]]'s ''[[Laughter (Bergson book)|Laughter]]'' may provide a complementary view on [[comedy]].
* The book evolved out of an introduction to [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]]'s ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'': "the introduction to Spenser became an introduction to the theory of [[allegory]]" Frye allowed (p. vii).

The '''Ancient Monuments Society''' (AMS) is a [[learned society]] and [[Charitable organization#Charity registration|registered charity]] in England and Wales,&lt;ref&gt;{{EW charity|209605}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded in 1924 "for the study and conservation of ancient monuments, historic buildings and fine old craftsmanship".

==National Amenity Societies==
The Ancient Monuments Society is recognised as one of the [[Amenity society|National Amenity Societies]], and as such is informed of any application for listed building consent in England and Wales involving any element of demolition.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=[[Department for Communities and Local Government]] |title=Arrangements for handling heritage applications Direction 2015 |publisher=www.gov.uk |date=24 March 2015 |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/arrangements-for-handling-heritage-applications-direction-2015 |accessdate=5 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As such it plays an important part in shaping the historic environment in England and Wales.

==Partnership with Friends of Friendless Churches==
The Ancient Monuments Society works in partnership with the [[Friends of Friendless Churches]], sharing an office and staff and operating a joint membership scheme. The co-operation came about because Friends of Friendless Churches was set up by [[Ivor Bulmer-Thomas]], who was also Secretary and later Chairman of the Ancient Monuments Society.

==Publications==
The AMS publishes three newsletters and a volume of ''Transactions'' (scholarly articles on a range of architectural historic topics) annually for its 2,100 members.

== Early life ==
Bochner was raised in Pittsburgh. His father was a sign painter and his mother worked as an editorial assistant at ''The Jewish Chronicle''. Bochner’s interest in existential philosophy began at [[Taylor Allderdice High School]] where, in his senior thesis on [[Albert Camus]]' ''The Myth of Sisyphus'', he wrote, “All that was real—all that could be known—was what one could feel in his heart or touch through experience in the world. There is no truth beyond experience.”&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Bochner, A. (2014). Arthur P. Bochner, 2008 President National Communication Association. Review of Communication. 14, 71-88. DOI: 10.1080/15358593.2014.941687&lt;/ref&gt;  After high school he attended California State University in Pennsylvania where he participated in debate and extemporaneous speaking. He graduated with a B.S. in Speech Communication, then taught English and Speech at East High School in Auburn, New York. He earned an M.A. in Speech from [[Syracuse University]] and Ph.D. in Communication from [[Bowling Green State University]]. His doctoral dissertation was an experimental study of social relations entitled, ''A Multivariate Investigation of [[Machiavellianism]] and Task Structure in Four-Man Groups''.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

== Research and teaching ==
Bochner’s early research focused on interpersonal and group communication in the empiricist tradition using experimental design and multivariate statistics.  He spent three years as Assistant Professor at Cleveland State University and ten years at Temple University where he ascended through the academic ranks, achieving promotion to professor in 1982.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

In 1976, Bochner published “Conceptual Frontiers in the Study of Families: An Introduction to the Literature,” a foundational essay for which he later received NCA’s Brommel Award for distinguished contributions to family communication. He also received awards for foundational essays on interpersonal competence (with Clifford Kelly)&lt;ref&gt;Bochner, A., &amp; Kelly, C. (1974). Interpersonal Competence: Rationale, Philosophy, and Implementation of a Conceptual Framework. Speech Teacher, 23, 279-301&lt;/ref&gt; and autoethnography (with [[Carolyn Ellis]]). Bochner has been honored with numerous awards for career achievements in research and teaching including The Michael Osborne Teacher/Scholar Award, The Charles Woolbert Award (with [[Carolyn Ellis]]), Ohio University’s Elizabeth Andersch Career Achievement Award, and the McKnight Foundation’s William R. Jones Award for mentoring minority graduate students.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  Bochner acknowledges he is influenced by the communication theory of [[Gregory Bateson]] and [[R.D. Laing]], the humanistic psychology of [[Carl Rogers]], [[Abraham Maslow]], and [[Rollo May]], and the fieldwork of [[Erving Goffman]], [[Jules Henry]], and [[Clifford Geertz]], inspiring him “to break away from received traditions—to innovate, create, and experiment with new or different methods of inquiring into and representing lived experiences” (p.&amp;nbsp;297).&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Bochner, A. (2014). Coming to Narrative: A Personal History of Paradigm Change in the Human Sciences. Walnut Creek, CA: Left Coast Press&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, Bochner joined the Department of Communication at the University of South Florida. He became Chair of the department in 1985, guiding the department’s creation of the first Ph.D. program exclusively devoted to qualitative research in communication. In 1990, he left administration to collaborate with sociologist [[Carolyn Ellis]], and become Co-Director of the Institute for Interpretive Human Studies. In 1996, Ellis and Bochner co-edited, ''Composing Ethnography: Alternative Forms of Qualitative Writing'', a book widely recognized as the first volume to promote forms of autoethnographic inquiry designed to bridge humanities and social science research. Bochner and Ellis teamed up as editors of two book series emphasizing autoethnography and personal narrative, which have yielded more than thirty books representing evocative and novel forms of representing lived experience, bringing attention to emotions, [[subjectivity]], embodiment, and personal storytelling. He chaired the department for another two-year term in 1992. By 2004, the department had achieved distinction as a center of excellence in narrative and autoethnographic inquiry. In 2008, Bochner served as President of the [[National Communication Association]].&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

In 2014, Bochner published ''Coming to Narrative: A Personal History of Paradigm Change in the Human Sciences'', an autoethnographic story that layers theory and story, weaving his professional and personal life with the social and historical contexts in which they developed. NCA’s Ethnography Division presented their 2014 “Best Book Award” to Bochner and their “Legacy Award” for distinguished lifetime achievement in ethnography. The [[National Communication Association]] also named Bochner as a Distinguished Scholar. In 2015, Coming to Narrative was honored with a "Best Book" Award by the International Congress for Qualitative Inquiry. Bochner made numerous innovations in the teaching curriculum of communication studies. He introduced courses on marital and family communication, and inaugurated undergraduate courses on Love and Communication, Writing Lives, and Relationships on Film, and graduate courses on Communication As Social Construction, Writing Workshop, Close Relationships, and Narrative Inquiry.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

'''Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre''' (formerly the '''Bamfield Marine Station''') is a [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] research station established in 1972, located in [[Bamfield, British Columbia|Bamfield, Barkley Sound, British Columbia]] and run by the [[University of Victoria]], the [[University of British Columbia]], [[Simon Fraser University]], the [[University of Alberta]], and the [[University of Calgary]].  The Centre hosts numerous public education programs in marine related science. BC Field Trips organizes many instructional and educational programs for school-aged children at the Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bcfieldtrips.ca/users/bamfield-marine-sciences-centre|title=Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre|website=BC Field Trips|language=en|access-date=2018-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre also runs courses for [[university]] students during the summer (May to late August or early September) and during the fall (September to mid-December) through their affiliated universities.

The Centre is housed in the original building used as the western terminus of the British Empire's worldwide undersea cable called the [[All Red Line]].  Originally the site of the Pacific Cable Board (PCB) Cable Station, which served as the eastern terminus of the trans-Pacific [[telegraph]] cable linking [[Canada]] to [[Tabuaeran|Fanning Island]] (1,600 kilometres south of [[Hawaii]]).  The telegraph cable operated from 1901 to 1959.

The Centre also lends continued logistical support for [[Folger Passage]] and [[Barkley Sound]] with [[Ocean Networks Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oceannetworks.ca/about-us/funders-partners/partners/bamfield-marine-sciences-centre-bmsc|title=Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre (BMSC) {{!}} Ocean Networks Canada|website=www.oceannetworks.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre and the [[Huu-ay-aht First Nations]] partnered with the [[Hakai Institute]] to launch a drone. The drone took a series of photos, which were then used to map portions of the Barkley Sound area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hakai.org/blog/life-at-hakai/bamfield-you%E2%80%99ve-never-seen-it|title=Bamfield As You’ve Never Seen It Before {{!}} Hakai Institute|work=Hakai Institute|access-date=2018-09-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 1, 2018, Dr. Sean Rogers, a biology instructor at the University of Calgary, was named director of the Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre for a five-year term. Rogers has taught university courses at the Centre, and had been named acting director in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ucalgary.ca/utoday/issue/2018-06-19/biologist-sean-rogers-appointed-director-bamfield-marine-sciences-centre-five-year|title=Biologist Sean Rogers appointed director of Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre for five-year term|date=2018-06-18|work=UToday {{!}} University of Calgary|access-date=2018-09-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Center for Hellenic Studies in Greece''' (CHS GR&lt;ref&gt;initials used, for example, on Center's Web site&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Harvard University|Harvard]] [[research Center]] based in [[Nafplio]], [[Greece]]. A twin institution to its counterpart [[Harvard University]]’s [[Center for Hellenic Studies]] in [[Washington, D.C.]],&lt;ref name="en.wikipedia.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/collection.php?cpk=1631|title=Center for Hellenic Studies {{!}} Harvard University Press|last=|first=|date=|website=www.hup.harvard.edu|language=en|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; CHS GR is housed in the Iatrou building, formerly home to the municipal town hall of Nafplio, at Philhellene and King Othon Street. A joint American and Greek Executive Board supervise the Center in Greece. The Director of the Center for Hellenic Studies in Greece is Professor Ioannis Petropoulos of the [[Democritus University of Thrace]].

== History ==
The Center for Hellenic Studies in Greece inaugurated in 2008 by way of a joint decision between the [[Provost (education)|Provost]] and the [[Dean (education)|Dean]] of the [[Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences]]. CHS GR utilizes the knowledge and expertise of [[Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences|Harvard]]'s faculty and [[Research Center|research centers]] and is a part of [[Harvard University|Harvard]]’s continuing effort to expand its international presence.&lt;ref name="summer.harvard.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldwide.harvard.edu/search/all|title=Harvard Worldwide|last=|first=|date=|website=|accessdate=|deadurl=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center serves as a nexus for the network of international Centers operated by Harvard in [[Europe]] and around the globe, and it was organized and developed by being accessible, and free of charge, to the general public.

From a geographical standpoint Nafplio's role in the shaping of modern Greece and its enduring cultural significance make it an opportune setting for Harvard students as well as for visitors from Greece and across the globe. Nafplio neighbors with many archaeological sites in Greece such as [[Mycenae]], [[Mystras]], [[Epidaurus]], [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], [[Tiryns]], etc. Nafplio was the first capital of [[History of modern Greece|modern]] Greece after independence and a port during the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenean period]].

== Digital Library ==
The Center for Hellenic Studies’s facility in Nafplio has been equipped with a [[Digital library|Digital Library]] which provides access to [[Harvard Library]]'s electronic resources and a number of additional databases. Access is open to all researchers and visitors of the Center, regardless of affiliation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nafplio.gr/en/kentroellspoudonharvardmenu.html|title=The Center for Hellenic Studies (Greece), Harvard University|last=|first=|date=|website=www.nafplio.gr|language=en-gb|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programs ==
The Center for Hellenic Studies provides training and professional development to students, visitors, and researchers in all fields of study through a wide variety of [[Educational program|programs]], which include internships, workshops and seminars, research initiatives, and study abroad:

*The CHS Cultural Internship Program in Greece&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; brings together a group of college students from different [[Academic institution|institutions]] throughout [[Greece]] and the [[United States]] for five weeks each summer in [[Nafplio]] to work and gain professional experience. Students develop their talents and skills while contributing to projects that directly support the goals and activities of the internship institutions, which are the Fougaro Cultural Complex, the Municipal Organization of Culture, Environment, Sports, and Tourism (DOPPAT), the [[Archaeological Museum of Nafplion|Nafplio Archaeological Museum]] and the [[National Gallery (Athens)|National Gallery, Nafplio Annex]].
*The five-week-long Comparative Cultural Studies Seminar&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.summer.harvard.edu/study-abroad/greece|title=Harvard Summer Program in Greece|last=|first=|date=|work=Harvard Summer School|access-date=|dead-url=|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (CCS) is the oldest [[Harvard University|Harvard]] study-abroad program of [[Harvard Summer School]]. Divided between [[Nafplio]] and [[Thessaloniki]], and led by Harvard Professor [[Gregory Nagy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://classics.fas.harvard.edu/people/gregory-nagy-0|title=Gregory Nagy|last=|first=|date=|website=classics.fas.harvard.edu|language=en|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a founding team of Harvard-trained Senior Fellows, the program seeks to promote cross-cultural understanding by combining historical, literary, philosophical, and linguistic approaches to [[cultural exchange]].
*The CHS GR High School Summer Program (HSSP) is a sixteen-day summer program addressed to high school students from the [[Argolis]]. The students attend an intensive daily seminar led by Harvard faculty, and [[Teaching fellow|Teaching Fellows]] studying at Harvard. The Harvard undergraduate students acting as the Teaching Fellows support the daily program by assembling course material as well as preparing every other activity related to the program. The program is directed by Dr. Nicolas Prevelakis, Lecturer in Harvard's Committee on Degrees in Social Studies and Assistant Director of Curricular Development at [[Center for Hellenic Studies|Center for Hellenic Studies in Washington D.C.]]
*CHS offers [[research]] opportunities to junior faculty members and individual researchers, aiming to build a network of fellows that will enhance learning and support the academic profile of Greece. The CHS-CCS Fellowships Program, addresses junior faculty—Adjunct Lecturers, Lecturers, Assistant Professors—of 100 Schools of [[Humanities]] and [[Social science|Social Sciences]] from [[List of universities in Greece|Greek Universities]]. The fellows participate in the CCS Program in Greece by presenting their research and interacting with colleagues and students from the U.S. and elsewhere. Their year-long appointment includes access to all Harvard electronic resources. CHS also offers in collaboration with the [[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki]], Faculty of Philosophy, School of Philology, Department of Classics, the CHS-AUTH joint research fellowships to young [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] holders from AUTH’s Department of Classics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.auth.gr/en/affilliations|title=Agreements of Scientific Cooperation {{!}} ARISTOTLE UNIVERSITY OF THESSALONIKI|last=|first=|date=|website=www.auth.gr|language=en|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fellowships include year-long access to Harvard University’s online databases and resources and to AUTH’s library system and also participation in a number of events and activities organized by both institutions.
*In cooperation with the Harvard Alumni Association, the Center for Hellenic Studies supports the organization of the “Greece Spring Break for Students and Alumni” Trip. Academic head of the program is Professor [[Gregory Nagy]]. Starting from [[Nafplio]] and [[Mycenae]] and proceeding through the [[Peloponnese]], [[Delphi]] and [[Athens]], the group supplements its explorations with selected readings in translation from [[Homer]], [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], and some modern texts. The group consists of students, alumni, and participants and alumni from the Harvard [[Massive open online course|MOOC]] The Ancient Greek Hero in 24 Hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edx.org/course/ancient-greek-hero-24-hours-harvardx-hum2x-2|title=The Ancient Greek Hero in 24 Hours|last=|first=|date=|work=edX|access-date=|dead-url=|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Events and Activities ==
As part of its mission of outreach, the Center for Hellenic Studies in Greece offers a regular program of activities that address not only Harvard and other academic institutions but also the local community, including the [[Argolis]] region and the [[Peloponnese]]. Such is the Events Series, which is organized with the support of Municipalities of the [[Argolis]], [[Nafplio]], [[Argos|Argos-Mycenae]], [[Ermionida]], [[Epidaurus]], as well as other institutions such as the Society for the Promotion of Education and Learning (SPEL), the [[University of Peloponnese]], the Harvard Club of Greece, the [[Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki]], etc. A number of other activities such as educational programs, exhibitions, events and workshops are organized in collaboration with institutions of the city such as the Municipal Organization of Culture, Environment, Sports, and Tourism (DOPPAT), Municipalities of the [[Argolis]] as well as the regional government of the [[Peloponnese]], the Athletic Federation of Greece (SEGAS), the Department of Theatre Studies, University of [[Peloponnese]], the Fougaro Cultural Complex, etc.

CHS in Greece has established long collaborations with institutions such as SPEL under the direction of [[Georgios Babiniotis|George Babiniotis]], the [[International Olympic Academy]], the [[Fulbright Foundation]] in Greece, the [[Michael Marks Awards for Poetry Pamphlets|Michael Marks]] Charitable Trust, the [[University of Peloponnese]], in order to provide a regular program of events and activities addressed to the local and global educational and research community.

CHS GR also hosts and supports a number of visiting study abroad programs and collaborates with a number of educational institutions.

The '''Centre for Nanoscience and Quantum Information''' (informally, '''NSQI''') is a research centre within the [[University of Bristol]]. The centre was initially built as an intra-university facility, but was absorbed into the portfolio of the School of Physics in 2016. The centre officially opened in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.bris.ac.uk/news/2009/6531.html| title = Official opening of the Centre for Nanoscience &amp; Quantum Information| accessdate = 7 November 2011| publisher = University of Bristol}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Centre was designed to provide a unique ultra-low-vibration research space, making the labs some of the quietest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.capitasymonds.co.uk/news__events/news/quietest_building_in_the_world.aspx| title = 'Quietest building in the world' officially opens| accessdate = 8 November 2011| publisher = Capita Symonds}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://physicsworld.com/blog/2009/09/visting_the_quietest_building.html| title = Visiting the quietest building in the world| accessdate = 10 November 2011 | publisher = Institute of Physics}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== The Building ==

=== Building layout ===
The building is split across four floors:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.bris.ac.uk/nsqi-centre/facilities/| title = Facilities at the Centre for Nanoscience &amp; Quantum Information| accessdate = 3 November 2011| publisher = NSQI, University of Bristol}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Basement: is entirely for the most sensitive experimental work, with seven low noise labs, two ultra-low noise labs, an [[anechoic chamber]] and a class 1000 [[cleanroom]], as well as three prep labs. 
* Ground Floor: has two Quantum Information labs (with less stringent noise requirements), staff offices (including an office dedicated for users of the [[NanoESCA]] facility contained in the NSQI basement) plus a seminar room and large, bright, open foyer and coffee area.
* First Floor: houses researchers, students and operations staff associated with [[QETLabs]], the [[QE-CDT]] and affiliated quantum technologies groups.
* Second Floor: contains another office and a large Quantum Engineering Technology lab; a main interdisciplinary communal lab containing a clean room area and several annex labs. 
* Third Floor: location of the main switch room and plant room for all the Centre services (water tanks, boilers, air handling units etc.).

=== Building design features ===
The building was designed by Percy Thomas of Capita Architecture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.capitaarchitecture.co.uk/capita.html| title = Capita Architecture| accessdate = 7 November 2011| publisher = Capita Architecturel}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2004 and built by Willmott Dixon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.willmottdixongroup.co.uk/assets/h/i/highereducationbrochure.pdf| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110409174626/http://www.willmottdixongroup.co.uk/assets/h/i/highereducationbrochure.pdf| dead-url = yes| archive-date = 9 April 2011| title = Higher Education Profile| page = 11| accessdate = 7 November 2011| publisher = Willmott Dixon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary requirement for the building was that it be a low-[[noise]] research environment, stable enough to allow researchers to take measurements at subnanometre and subnanoNewton resolution, despite other activities going on around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/jan/05/quietest-building-chemists-physicists-engineers| title = Delicate science| accessdate = 7 November 2011| publisher = The Guardian| location=London| first=Louise| last=Tickle| date=5 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The criteria set for the research space exceeded any standard curve (VC curves) and required significant design and engineering solutions.

==== Low vibrations ====
The primary source of noise for researchers at the [[nanoscale]] is mechanical [[vibration]]. Activities within a building generate noise that can travel through the structure and vibrations created outside (such as from road traffic) can travel through the ground and enter the building. A variety of methods were employed to reduce vibration generation, travel and entry into the lab space:

* The main structure of the building is massive,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.naturalarchitecture.co.uk/project_scientific_1.htm| title = New centre for Nano-science and Quantum Information, University of Bristol| accessdate = 7 November 2011| publisher = Natural Architecture}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2.0 m-thick concrete foundations and 0.5 m-thick concrete floors.
* All plant machinery is removed to the third floor, as far from the lab space as possible.
* All services and plant machinery is suspended on springs, rubber pads or damper pads to reduce coupling between the mechanism and the building.
* All services are balanced to reduce turbulence within pipe and ductwork.
* All corridors are floating, separate from the main structure, stopping vibrations crossing the floor and major foot traffic from affecting the building.
* The lift shaft is decoupled from the building structure.
* The building is decoupled from the building next door.
* All services pass through a flexible hose coupling before entering the low noise labs.
* All Low noise labs have a seven tonne concrete isolation block set on damper pads, within the ground slab. This is the experimental space, with lower vibrations than the surrounding floor and allowing experiments to continue while the researcher walks around within the lab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.bris.ac.uk/nsqi-centre/facilities/lownoise.html| title = Low noise lab facilities at the Centre for Nanoscience &amp; Quantum Information| accessdate = 3 November 2011| publisher = NSQI, University of Bristol}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Both ultra-low noise labs have either a 23-tonne or 27-tonne concrete isolation block supported by [[pneumatic]] rams. The block is T-shaped in cross-section, to keep the centre of gravity lower (reducing wobble within the block). The block is surrounded by a floating floor, so that researchers can use the room while experiments are taking place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.bris.ac.uk/nsqi-centre/facilities/ultra-lownoise.html| title = Ultra low noise lab facilities at the Centre for Nanoscience &amp; Quantum Information| accessdate = 3 November 2011| publisher = NSQI, University of Bristol}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To further reduce the noise in the ultra-low noise labs, control equipment can be removed from the room and installed in the neighbouring control room. The control room has its own isolation block and is heavily soundproofed. Conduits allow cables to run between the labs, allowing the experiment to be completely run from the control room.

==== Soundproofing ====
Acoustic noise within the building is countered through several measures. Most importantly, experimental rooms are far from the busy University precinct, underground and in an area that is not used for teaching, or as a thoroughfare. The thickness of the floor ensures that little sound penetrates across and the walls between labs and doors of the labs are soundproof. The plant machinery is removed as far from the labs as possible, on the top floor, and the services are tuned as precisely as possible to reduce any sounds from the water supply, chilled water system or air vents.

==== Low electrical noise ====
Many of the experiments planned for the Centre involve recording tiny electrical currents (as low as a few picoAmps) so electrical noise is seen as a serious problem. Each basement research lab is a full [[Faraday cage]], all service pipework changes to plastic before entering the lab and no [[Category 5 cable]] (cat5e) is used in data network, [[optical fibre]] is used instead. All labs are also supplied with an independent earth and 'clean' power supply, the mains having been filtered by a 1:1 [[transformer]].

==== Interdisciplinary space ====
In addition to providing state-of-the-art low noise spaces, the building is also designed to encourage collaboration and interdisciplinary research. This includes plenty of meeting spaces and a light &amp; spacious foyer/coffee area.

'''Conservatism''' is a [[Political philosophy|political]] and [[social philosophy]] promoting traditional social institutions in the context of [[culture]] and [[civilization]]. The central tenets of conservatism include tradition, human imperfection, [[organic society]], hierarchy, authority, and [[property rights]].{{sfn|Heywood|2012|p=68}} Conservatives seek to preserve a range of institutions such as [[monarchy]], religion, [[parliamentary government]], and property rights, with the aim of emphasizing social stability and continuity.{{sfn|Heywood|2012|p=69}} The more extreme elements—[[reactionaries]]—oppose [[modernism]] and seek a return to "the way things were".&lt;ref&gt;Iain McLean and Alistair McMillan, "Conservatism", ''Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics'', Third Edition, "Sometimes it (conservatism) has been outright opposition, based on an existing model of society that is considered right for all time. It can take a 'reactionary' form, harking back to, and attempting to reconstruct, forms of society which existed in an earlier period", Oxford University Press, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-19-920516-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/133435/conservatism|title=Conservatism (political philosophy)|publisher=Britannica.com}} Retrieved on 1 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first established use of the term in a political context originated in 1818 with [[François-René de Chateaubriand]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jerry Z. Muller|title=Conservatism: An Anthology of Social and Political Thought from David Hume to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9F7i5u4sOtgC&amp;pg=PA26|year=1997|publisher=Princeton U.P.|page=26|quote=Terms related to 'conservative' first found their way into political discourse in the title of the French weekly journal, ''Le Conservateur'', founded in 1818 by François-René de Chateaubriand with the aid of Louis de Bonald.|isbn=0691037116}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the period of [[Bourbon Restoration]] that sought to roll back the policies of the [[French Revolution]]. Historically associated with [[right-wing politics]], the term has since been used to describe [[#Forms|a wide range of views]]. There is no single set of policies regarded as conservative because the meaning of conservatism depends on what is considered traditional in a given place and time. Thus conservatives from different parts of the world—each upholding their respective traditions—may disagree on a wide range of issues. [[Edmund Burke]], an 18th-century politician who opposed the French Revolution but supported the [[American Revolution]], is credited as one of the main theorists of [[conservatism in the United Kingdom|conservatism in Great Britain in the 1790s]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frank O'Gorman|title=Edmund Burke: His Political Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U-reNJAnv1oC&amp;pg=PA171|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|page=171|isbn=9780415326841}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Quintin Hogg, Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone|Quintin Hogg]], the chairman of the British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in 1959: "Conservatism is not so much a philosophy as an attitude, a constant force, performing a timeless function in the development of a free society, and corresponding to a deep and permanent requirement of human nature itself".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Quintin Hogg Baron Hailsham of St. Marylebone|title=The Conservative Case|url=https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=%22+attitude,+a+constant+force,+performing+a+timeless+function+in+the+development+of+a+free+society,+and+corresponding+to+a+deep+and+permanent+requirement+of+human+nature+itself%22&amp;num=10|year=1959|publisher=Penguin Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the tradition-based definition of conservatism, some political theorists such as [[Corey Robin]] define conservatism primarily in terms of a general defense of [[Social inequality|social]] and [[economic inequality]]. From this perspective, conservatism is less an attempt to uphold traditional institutions and more, "a meditation on — and theoretical rendition of — the felt experience of having power, seeing it threatened, and trying to win it back".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/15/what-does-conservatism-stand-for|title=What does conservatism stand for?|last=Rooksby|first=Ed|date=15 July 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|issn=0261-3077|accessdate=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chronicle.com/article/The-Conservative-Mind/130199/|title=The Conservative Mind|last=Robin|first=Corey|date=8 January 2012|work=|newspaper=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]|accessdate=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Liberal conservatism ===
{{Main|Liberal conservatism}}
[[Liberal conservatism]] incorporates the [[classical liberal]] view of minimal government intervention in the economy. Individuals should be free to participate in the market and generate wealth without government interference.{{sfn|McAnulla|2006|p=71}} However, individuals cannot be thoroughly depended on to act responsibly in other spheres of life, therefore liberal conservatives believe that a strong state is necessary to ensure law and order and social institutions are needed to nurture a sense of duty and responsibility to the nation.{{sfn|McAnulla|2006|p=71}} Liberal conservatism is a variant of conservatism that is strongly influenced by [[Liberalism|liberal]] stances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xGNRRwkZFysC&amp;pg=PA109|title=Analyzing Politics|last=Grigsby|first=Ellen|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|year=2008|isbn=978-0-495-50112-1|location=|pages=108–09, 112, 347|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As these latter two terms have had different meanings over time and across countries, liberal conservatism also has a wide variety of meanings. Historically, the term often referred to the combination of [[economic liberalism]], which champions ''[[laissez-faire]]'' markets, with the classical conservatism concern for established [[tradition]], respect for authority and religious values. It contrasted itself with [[classical liberalism]], which supported [[freedom for the individual]] in both the economic and social spheres.

Over time, the general conservative ideology in many countries adopted economic liberal arguments and the term liberal conservatism was replaced with conservatism. This is also the case in countries where liberal economic ideas have been the tradition such as the United States and are thus considered conservative. In other countries where liberal conservative movements have entered the political mainstream, such as [[Italy]] and [[Spain]], the terms liberal and conservative may be synonymous. The liberal conservative tradition in the United States combines the economic [[individualism]] of the classical liberals with a [[Burkean]] form of conservatism (which has also become part of the [[American conservative]] tradition, such as in the writings of [[Russell Kirk]]).

A secondary meaning for the term liberal conservatism that has developed in [[Europe]] is a combination of more modern conservative (less traditionalist) views with those of [[social liberalism]]. This has developed as an opposition to the more [[collectivist]] views of [[socialism]]. Often this involves stressing what are now conservative views of [[free market]] economics and belief in individual responsibility, with social liberal views on defence of [[civil rights]], [[environmentalism]] and support for a limited [[welfare state]]. In continental Europe, this is sometimes also translated into English as social conservatism.

=== Conservative liberalism ===
{{Main|Conservative liberalism}}
[[Conservative liberalism]] is a variant of liberalism that combines liberal values and policies with conservative stances, or more simply the right-wing of the liberal movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.ipolitique.fr/liberalisme-conservateur.htm Ipolitique.fr] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319053712/http://www.ipolitique.fr/liberalisme-conservateur.htm |date=March 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parties-and-elections.de/contents.html|title=parties-and-elections.de|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mair"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Representative Government in Europe|last=Gallagher|first=M.|last2=Laver|first2=M.|last3=Mair|first3=P.|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|page=221|quote=|author-link=Michael Gallagher (academic)|author-link3=Peter Mair|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The roots of conservative liberalism are found at the beginning of the [[History of liberal thought|history of liberalism]]. Until the two [[World Wars]], in most European countries the political class was formed by conservative liberals, from Germany to Italy. Events after [[World War I]] brought the more radical version of classical liberalism to a more conservative (i.e. more moderate) type of liberalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beyond Liberalism|last=Allen|first=R.T.|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|page=13|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Libertarian conservatism ===
{{Main|Libertarian conservatism}}
[[Libertarian conservatism]] describes certain political ideologies within the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] which combine [[libertarian]] economic issues with aspects of conservatism. Its four main branches are [[constitutionalism]], [[paleolibertarianism]], [[American conservatism|small government conservatism]] and [[Christian libertarianism]]. They generally differ from [[Paleoconservatism|paleoconservatives]], in that they are in favor of more [[liberty|personal]] and [[economic freedom]].

[[Agorist]]s such as [[Samuel Edward Konkin III]] labeled libertarian conservatism [[right-libertarianism]].&lt;ref name="nlm"&gt;{{cite web|title=New Libertarian Manifesto |url=http://agorism.info/NewLibertarianManifesto.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223021118/http://www.agorism.info/NewLibertarianManifesto.pdf |archivedate=February 23, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="int"&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview With Samuel Edward Konkin III|url=http://www.spaz.org/~dan/individualist-anarchist/software/konkin-interview.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to paleoconservatives, libertarian conservatives support strict ''laissez-faire'' policies such as [[free trade]], opposition to any national bank and opposition to [[regulations|business regulations]]. They are vehemently opposed to [[environmental regulation]]s, [[corporate welfare]], [[subsidies]] and other areas of economic intervention.

Many conservatives, especially in the United States, believe that the government should not play a major role in regulating business and managing the economy. They typically oppose efforts to charge high tax rates and to redistribute income to assist the poor. Such efforts, they argue, do not properly reward people who have earned their money through hard work.

=== Fiscal conservatism ===
{{Main|Fiscal conservatism}}
[[File:TeaPartyByFreedomFan.JPG|thumb|[[Taxpayer March on Washington]], as conservative protesters walk down [[Pennsylvania Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Pennsylvania Avenue]], Washington, D.C., in 2009]]
[[Fiscal conservatism]] is the economic philosophy of prudence in government spending and debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B10JkvO82x8C&amp;pg=PA109|title=Correctional Organization and Management: Public Policy Challenges, Behavior, and Structure|first=Robert M.|last=Freeman|publisher=Elsevier|year=1999|page=109|isbn=978-0-7506-9897-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'', Edmund Burke argued that a government does not have the right to run up large debts and then throw the burden on the taxpayer: &lt;blockquote&gt;[I]t is to the property of the citizen, and not to the demands of the creditor of the state, that the first and original faith of civil society is pledged. The claim of the citizen is prior in time, paramount in title, superior in equity. The fortunes of individuals, whether possessed by acquisition or by descent or in virtue of a participation in the goods of some community, were no part of the creditor's security, expressed or implied...[T]he public, whether represented by a monarch or by a senate, can pledge nothing but the public estate; and it can have no public estate except in what it derives from a just and proportioned imposition upon the citizens at large.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== National and traditional conservatism ===
{{Main|National conservatism|Traditional conservatism}}
[[File:Gianfranco Fini 2004.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Gianfranco Fini]], former President of the Italian [[Chamber of Deputies (Italy)|Chamber of Deputies]], in 2004]]
[[National conservatism]] is a political term used primarily in Europe to describe a variant of conservatism which concentrates more on national interests than standard conservatism as well as upholding cultural and ethnic identity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dictionary Of Public Administration|last=Mandal|first=V.C.|year=2007|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|location=|isbn=978-81-7625-784-8|page=306|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Hs0xJORVIHwC&amp;pg=PA306&amp;cd=8&amp;q=%22National%20conservatism%22%20-inpublisher%3Aicon|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while not being outspokenly [[Nationalism|nationalist]] or supporting a [[Far-right politics|far-right]] approach.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Jason (August 23, 2016).

National conservatism is heavily oriented towards the traditional [[family]] and social stability as well as in favour of limiting [[immigration]]. As such, national conservatives can be distinguished from economic conservatives, for whom free market economic policies, [[deregulation]] and fiscal conservatism are the main priorities. Some commentators have identified a growing gap between national and economic conservatism: "[M]ost parties of the Right [today] are run by economic conservatives who, in varying degrees, have marginalized social, cultural, and national conservatives".&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_n12_v49/ai_19559422 National questions – conservatives fragmenting as liberals unite]{{dead link|date=January 2016}}, National Review, June 30, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; National conservatism is also related to [[traditionalist conservatism]].

Traditionalist conservatism is a political philosophy emphasizing the need for the principles of [[natural law]] and transcendent moral order, [[tradition]], [[hierarchy]] and [[organic unity]], [[agrarianism]], [[classicism]] and [[high culture]] as well as the intersecting spheres of loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;Frohnen, Bruce, Jeremy Beer, and Jeffrey O. Nelson, ed. (2006) ''American Conservatism: An Encyclopedia'' Wilmington, DE: ISI Books, pp. 870–75&lt;/ref&gt; Some traditionalists have embraced the labels "[[reactionary]]" and "[[counterrevolution]]ary", defying the stigma that has attached to these terms since the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. Having a hierarchical view of society, many traditionalist conservatives, including a few Americans, defend the [[monarchy|monarchical]] political structure as the most natural and beneficial social arrangement.

=== Cultural and social conservatism ===
{{Main|Cultural conservatism|social conservatism}}
[[Cultural conservative]]s support the preservation of the heritage of one nation, or of a shared culture that is not defined by national boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RbwDNb5jtzUC&amp;printsec=frontcover |title=Cultural Conservatism, Political Liberalism: From Criticism to Cultural Studies |first=James |last=Seaton |publisher=University of Michigan Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-472-10645-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shared culture may be as divergent as [[Western culture]] or [[Chinese culture]]. In the United States, the term cultural conservative may imply a conservative position in the [[culture war]]. Cultural conservatives hold fast to traditional ways of thinking even in the face of monumental change. They believe strongly in traditional values and traditional politics and often have an urgent sense of nationalism.

[[Social conservatism]] is distinct from cultural conservatism, although there are some overlaps. Social conservatives may believe that society is built upon a fragile network of relationships which need to be upheld through duty, traditional values and established institutions;{{sfn|Heywood|2017|p=69}} and that the government has a role in encouraging or enforcing traditional values or behaviours. A social conservative wants to preserve traditional morality and social mores, often by opposing what they consider radical policies or [[social engineering (political science)|social engineering]]. Social change is generally regarded as suspect.

A second meaning of the term social conservatism developed in the [[Nordic countries]] and [[continental Europe]], where it refers to liberal conservatives supporting modern [[European welfare state]]s.

Social conservatives (in the first meaning of the word) in many countries generally favour the [[pro-life]] position in the [[abortion controversy]] and oppose human [[embryonic stem cell]] research (particularly if publicly funded); oppose both [[eugenics]] and [[human enhancement]] ([[transhumanism]]) while supporting [[bioconservatism]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utne.com/2005-01-01/TheNextDigitalDivide.aspx?page=2 The Next Digital Divide] (utne article)&lt;/ref&gt; support a traditional definition of marriage as being one man and one woman; view the [[nuclear family]] model as society's foundational unit; oppose expansion of [[civil marriage]] and [[child adoption]] to couples in [[same-sex relationship]]s; promote [[public morality]] and traditional [[family values]]; oppose [[atheism]],&lt;ref&gt;"No, I don't know that atheists should be considered as citizens, nor should they be considered patriots.

Most conservatives in the United States support the [[death penalty]].

=== Religious conservatism {{anchor|Religious conservatism}}===
{{See also|Christian right|Religious fundamentalism}}
[[File:Marche pour la vie 2012 - 6.jpg|thumb|[[March for Life (Paris)|March for Life]] in Paris, France in 2012]]
Religious conservatism principally apply the teachings of particular religions to politics, sometimes by merely proclaiming the value of those teachings, at other times by having those teachings influence laws.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, Margaret L., Taylor, Howard Francis. [https://books.google.com/books?id=LP9bIrZ9xacC&amp;pg=PA469 ''Sociology: Understanding a Diverse Society''] Cengage Learning, 4th Ed. (2005), pp. 469–70.  {{ISBN|978-0-534-61716-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most democracies, political conservatism seeks to uphold traditional family structures and social values. Religious conservatives typically oppose abortion, homosexual behavior, drug use&lt;ref&gt;"So Christians do not approve of the taking of illegal drugs, including most recreational drugs, especially those which can alter the mind and make people incapable of praying or being alert to God." http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/rs/sanctity/chdrugsrev2.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; and sexual activity outside of marriage. In some cases, conservative values are grounded in religious beliefs and conservatives seek to increase the role of religion in public life.&lt;ref&gt;Petersen, David L. (2005). "Genesis and Family Values". ''Journal of Biblical Literature''. '''124''' (1).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Paternalistic conservatism ===
{{Main|Paternalistic conservatism}}
Paternalistic conservatism is a strand in conservatism which reflects the belief that societies exist and develop organically and that members within them have obligations towards each other.{{sfn|Heywood|2013|p=34}} There is particular emphasis on the [[Noblesse oblige|paternalistic obligation]] of those who are [[Social privilege|privileged]] and [[wealth]]y to the [[Poverty|poorer parts of society]]. Since it is consistent with principles such as [[Organic unity|organicism]], [[hierarchy]] and [[duty]], it can be seen an outgrowth of [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditional conservatism]]. Paternal conservatives support neither the [[individual]] nor the [[State (polity)|state]] in principle, but are instead prepared to support either or recommend a balance between the two depending on what is most practical.{{sfn|Heywood|2012|p=80}}

It stresses the importance of a [[social safety net]] to deal with [[poverty]], support of limited [[redistribution of wealth]] along with government regulation to regulate markets in the interests of both consumers and producers.&lt;ref name="Patrick Dunleavy 2000. pp. 107–08"&gt;Patrick Dunleavy, Paul Joseph Kelly, Michael Moran. ''British Political Science: Fifty Years of Political Studies''. Oxford, England, UK; Malden, Massachusetts, US: Wiley-Blackwell, 2000. pp. 107–08&lt;/ref&gt; Paternalistic conservatism first arose as a distinct ideology in the [[United Kingdom]] under Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]]'s "[[One nation conservatism|One Nation]]" [[Toryism]].&lt;ref name="Patrick Dunleavy 2000. pp. 107–08"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Blake. Disraeli. Second Edition. London, England, UK: Eyre &amp; Spottiswoode (Publishers) Ltd, 1967. p. 524&lt;/ref&gt; There have been a variety of one nation conservative governments. In the United Kingdom, the Prime Ministers Disraeli, [[Stanley Baldwin]], [[Neville Chamberlain]], [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Harold Macmillan]]&lt;ref&gt;Trevor Russel. The Tory Party: its policies, divisions and future. Penguin, 1978. p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; were one nation conservatives.

In [[Germany]], during the 19th-century [[Chancellor of Germany|German Chancellor]] [[Otto von Bismarck]] adopted policies of state-organized compulsory insurance for workers against sickness, accident, incapacity and old age. Chancellor [[Leo von Caprivi]] promoted a conservative agenda called the "New Course".&lt;ref&gt;John Alden Nichols. ''Germany after Bismarck, the Caprivi era, 1890–1894: Issue 5''. Harvard University Press, 1958. p. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the administration of President [[William Howard Taft]] was a progressive conservative and he described himself as "a believer in progressive conservatism"&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Lurie. William Howard Taft: The Travails of a Progressive Conservative. New York, New York, US: Cambridge University Press, 2012. p. ix&lt;/ref&gt; and President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] declared himself an advocate of "progressive conservatism".&lt;ref&gt;[[Günter Bischof]]. "Eisenhower, the Judiciary, and Desegregation" by Stanley I. Kutler, ''Eisenhower: a centenary assessment''. p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Canada]], a variety of conservative governments have been part of the [[Red tory]] tradition, with Canada's former major conservative party being named the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada]] from 1942 to 2003.&lt;ref name="Hugh Segal 2011. pp. 113–48"&gt;Hugh Segal. The Right Balance. Victoria, British Columbia, Canada: Douglas &amp; McIntyre, 2011. pp. 113–48&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, the Prime Ministers [[Arthur Meighen]], [[R. B.

=== Authoritarian conservatism ===
{{Main|Far-right politics}}
[[Authoritarian conservatism]] refers to autocratic regimes that center their ideology around conservative nationalism rather than [[ethnic nationalism]], though certain racial components such as [[antisemitism]] may exist.&lt;ref&gt;Michael H. Kater. Never Sang for Hitler: The Life and Times of Lotte Lehmann, 1888–1976. Cambridge University Press, 2008. p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; Authoritarian conservative movements show strong devotion towards religion, tradition and culture while also expressing fervent nationalism akin to other far-right nationalist movements. Examples of authoritarian conservative leaders include [[António de Oliveira Salazar]]&lt;ref&gt;Howard J. Wiarda, Margaret MacLeish Mott. Catholic Roots and Democratic Flowers: Political Systems in Spain and Portugal. Westport, CT: Greenwood Publishing Group, 2001. p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Engelbert Dollfuss]].&lt;ref&gt;Günter J. Bischof, Anton Pelinka, Alexander Lassner. The Dollfuss/Schuschnigg Era in Austria: A Reassessment. Piscataway, NJ: Transaction Publishers, 2001. p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Authoritarian conservative movements were prominent in the same era as [[fascism]], with which it sometimes clashed. Although both ideologies shared core values such as nationalism and had common enemies such as [[communism]] and [[materialism]], there was nonetheless a contrast between the traditionalist nature of authoritarian conservatism and the revolutionary, [[Palingenetic ultranationalism|palingenetic]] and populist nature of fascism—thus it was common for authoritarian conservative regimes to suppress rising fascist and [[National Socialism (disambiguation)|National Socialist movements]].&lt;ref&gt;Cyprian Blamires. World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1. Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2006. p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; The hostility between the two ideologies is highlighted by the struggle for power for the [[Austrian National Socialism|National Socialists]] in Austria, which was marked by the assassination of [[Engelbert Dollfuss]].

Sociologist [[Seymour Martin Lipset]] has examined the class basis of right-wing extremist politics in the 1920–1960 era. He reports:
: Conservative or rightist extremist movements have arisen at different periods in modern history, ranging from the [[Miklós Horthy|Horthyites]] in Hungary, the [[Engelbert Dollfuss|Christian Social Party of Dollfuss in Austria]], the [[Stahlhelm, Bund der Frontsoldaten|Stahlhelm]] and other nationalists in pre-Hitler Germany, and [[António de Oliveira Salazar|Salazar in Portugal]], to the pre-1966 Gaullist movements and the monarchists in contemporary France and Italy. The right extremists are conservative, not revolutionary. They seek to change political institutions in order to preserve or restore cultural and economic ones, while extremists of the centre and left seek to use political means for cultural and social revolution. The ideal of the right extremist is not a totalitarian ruler, but a monarch, or a traditionalist who acts like one. Many such movements in Spain,  Austria, Hungary, Germany, and Italy-have been explicitly monarchist....The supporters of these movements differ from those of the centrists, tending to be wealthier, and more religious, which is more important in terms of a potential for mass support.&lt;ref&gt;Seymour M. Lipset, "Social Stratification and 'Right-Wing Extremism'" ''British Journal of Sociology'' 10#4 (1959), pp. 346-382 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/587800 on-line]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Toryism|Related}}
In Great Britain, conservative ideas (though not yet called that) emerged in the [[Tory]] movement during the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] period (1660–1688). Toryism supported a hierarchical society with a monarch who ruled by [[Divine right of kings|divine right]]. [[Tories (British political party)|Tories]] opposed the idea that sovereignty derived from the people and rejected the authority of parliament and freedom of religion. [[Robert Filmer]]'s ''Patriarcha: or the Natural Power of Kings'' (published posthumously in 1680, but written before the [[English Civil War]] of 1642–1651) became accepted as the statement of their doctrine. However, the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 destroyed this principle to some degree by establishing a constitutional government in England, leading to the hegemony of the Tory-opposed [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] ideology. Faced with defeat, the Tories reformed their movement, now holding that sovereignty was vested in the three estates of Crown, Lords and Commons&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eccleshall|1990|pp=ix, 21}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than solely in the Crown. Toryism became marginalized during the long period of Whig ascendancy in the 18th century.

[[File:EdmundBurke1771.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Edmund Burke]] (1729–1797)]]
Conservatives typically see [[Richard Hooker]] (1554–1600) as the founding father of conservatism, along with the [[George Savile, 1st Marquess of Halifax|Marquess of Halifax]] (1633–1695), [[David Hume]] (1711–1776) and [[Edmund Burke]] (1729–1797). Halifax promoted pragmatism in government whilst Hume argued against political rationalism and utopianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Muller|editor1-first=Jerry Z.|title=Conservatism: an anthology of social and political thought from David Hume to the present|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wolin|first1=Sheldon S.|title=Hume and Conservatism|journal=American Political Science Review|date=2 September 2013|volume=48|issue=4|pages=999–1016|doi=10.2307/1951007|jstor=1951007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burke served as the private secretary to the [[Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham|Marquis of Rockingham]] and as official pamphleteer to the [[Rockingham Whigs|Rockingham branch of the Whig party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Edmund Burke: selected writings and speeches|last=Stanlis|first=Peter J.|publisher=[[Transaction Publishers]]|year=2009|isbn=|location=New York|pages=18|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with the Tories, they were the conservatives in the late 18th century United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=M. Morton Auerbach|title=The Conservative Illusion|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/AuerbachMMorton-1959?View=FindIt|publisher=Columbia University Press (1959)|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burke's views were a mixture of liberal and conservative. He supported the [[American Revolution]] of 1765–1783, but abhorred the violence of the [[French Revolution]] (1789–1799). He accepted the liberal ideals of private property and the economics of [[Adam Smith]] (1723–1790), but thought that economics should remain subordinate to the conservative social ethic, that capitalism should be subordinate to the medieval social tradition and that the business class should be subordinate to [[aristocracy]]. He insisted on standards of honor derived from the medieval aristocratic tradition and saw the aristocracy as the nation's natural leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Conservative Illusion|last=Auerbach|first=|publisher=|year=1959|isbn=|location=|pages=37–40|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; That meant limits on the powers of the Crown, since he found the institutions of Parliament to be better informed than commissions appointed by the executive. He favored an [[established church]], but allowed for a degree of [[religious toleration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Conservative Illusion|last=Auerbach|first=|publisher=|year=1959|isbn=|location=|pages=52–54|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burke justified the social order on the basis of tradition: tradition represented the wisdom of the species and he valued community and social harmony over social reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Conservative Illusion|last=Auerbach|first=|publisher=|year=1959|isbn=|location=|page=41|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burke was a leading theorist in his day, finding extreme idealism (either Tory or Whig) an endangerment to broader liberties and (like Hume) rejecting abstract reason as an unsound guide for political theory. Despite their influence on future conservative thought, none of these early contributors were explicitly involved in Tory politics. Hooker lived in the 16th century, long before the advent of [[toryism]], whilst Hume was an apolitical philosopher and Halifax similarly politically independent. Burke described himself as a Whig.

===== Revival =====
Shortly after Burke's death in 1797, conservatism revived as a mainstream political force as the Whigs suffered a series of internal divisions. This new generation of conservatives derived their politics not from Burke but from his predecessor, the [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke|Viscount Bolingbroke]] (1678–1751), who was a Jacobite and traditional Tory, lacking Burke's sympathies for Whiggish policies such as [[Catholic emancipation]] and [[American Revolution|American independence]] (famously attacked by [[Samuel Johnson]] in "Taxation No Tyranny"). In the first half of the 19th century, many newspapers, magazines and journals promoted loyalist or right-wing attitudes in religion, politics and international affairs. Burke was seldom mentioned, but [[William Pitt the Younger]] (1759–1806) became a conspicuous hero. The most prominent journals included ''The Quarterly Review'', founded in 1809 as a counterweight to the Whigs' ''Edinburgh Review'' and the even more conservative ''Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine''. Sack finds that the ''Quarterly Review'' promoted a balanced Canningite toryism as it was neutral on Catholic emancipation and only mildly critical of Nonconformist Dissent; it opposed slavery and supported the current poor laws; and it was "aggressively imperialist". The [[high-church]] clergy of the Church of England read the ''[[Orthodox Churchman's Magazine]]'' which was equally hostile to Jewish, Catholic, [[Jacobin]], [[Methodist]] and [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] spokesmen. Anchoring the ultra Tories, ''Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine'' stood firmly against Catholic emancipation and favoured slavery, cheap money, mercantilism, the [[Navigation Acts]] and the [[Holy Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sack|first=J.

Conservatism evolved after 1820, embracing free trade in 1846 and a commitment to democracy, especially under Disraeli. The effect was to significantly strengthen conservatism as a grassroots political force. Conservatism no longer was the philosophical defense of the landed aristocracy, but had been refreshed into redefining its commitment to the ideals of order, both secular and religious, expanding imperialism, strengthened monarchy and a more generous vision of the welfare state as opposed to the punitive vision of the Whigs and liberals.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Claeys, "Political Thought," in Chris Williams, ed., ''A Companion to 19th-Century Britain'' (2006). p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1835, Disraeli attacked the Whigs and utilitarians as slavishly devoted to an industrial oligarchy, while he described his fellow Tories as the only "really democratic party of England" and devoted to the interests of the whole people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Charles Richmond|author2=Paul Smith|title=The Self-Fashioning of Disraeli, 1818–1851|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jnF3IRJbKR8C&amp;pg=PA162|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge UP|page=162|isbn=9780521497299}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, inside the party there was a tension between the growing numbers of wealthy businessmen on the one side and the aristocracy and rural gentry on the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Conservative Illusion|last=Auerbach|first=|publisher=|year=1959|isbn=|location=|pages=39–40|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aristocracy gained strength as businessmen discovered they could use their wealth to buy a peerage and a country estate.

Although conservatives opposed attempts to allow greater representation of the middle class in parliament, they conceded that [[electoral reform]] could not be reversed and promised to support further reforms so long as they did not erode the institutions of church and state. These new principles were presented in the [[Tamworth Manifesto]] of 1834, which historians regard as the basic statement of the beliefs of the new Conservative Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eccleshall|1990|pp=79–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Robert Peel Portrait.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Robert Peel]] (1788–1850)]]
Some conservatives lamented the passing of a pastoral world where the ethos of ''[[noblesse oblige]]'' had promoted respect from the lower classes. They saw the [[Anglican Church]] and the aristocracy as balances against commercial wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eccleshall|1990|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; They worked toward legislation for improved working conditions and urban housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eccleshall|1990|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; This viewpoint would later be called [[Tory democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eccleshall|1990|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since Burke there has always been tension between traditional aristocratic conservatism and the wealthy business class.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eccleshall|1990|pp=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1834, Tory [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Robert Peel]] issued the [[Tamworth Manifesto]] in which he pledged to endorse moderate political reform. This marked the beginning of the transformation of British conservatism from [[High Tory]] reactionism towards a more modern form based on "conservation". The party became known as the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] as a result, a name it has retained to this day. However, Peel would also be the root of a split in the party between the traditional Tories (led by the [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Earl of Derby]] and [[Benjamin Disraeli]]) and the "Peelites" (led first by Peel himself, then by the [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Earl of Aberdeen]]). The split occurred in 1846 over the issue of [[free trade]], which Peel supported, versus [[protectionism]], supported by Derby. The majority of the party sided with Derby whilst about a third split away, eventually merging with the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]] and the [[radicalism (politics)|radicals]] to form the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]. Despite the split, the mainstream Conservative Party accepted the doctrine of free trade in 1852.

In the second half of the 19th century, the Liberal Party faced political schisms, especially over [[History of Ireland|Irish]] [[Irish Parliamentary Party|Home Rule]]. Leader [[William Gladstone]] (himself a former Peelite) sought to give Ireland a degree of autonomy, a move that elements in both the left and right-wings of his party opposed. These split off to become the [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionists]] (led by [[Joseph Chamberlain]]), forming a coalition with the Conservatives before merging with them in 1912. The Liberal Unionist influence dragged the Conservative Party towards the left as Conservative governments passing a number of progressive reforms at the turn of the 20th century. By the late 19th century, the traditional business supporters of the Liberal Party had joined the Conservatives, making them the party of [[business]] and [[commerce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=|last=Feuchtwanger|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|page=273|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a period of Liberal dominance before the [[First World War]], the Conservatives gradually became more influential in government, regaining full control of the cabinet in 1922. In the interwar period, conservatism was the major ideology in Britain&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Ball, "Baldwin, Stanley, first Earl Baldwin of Bewdley (1867–1947)", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ross McKibbin, ''Parties and people: England, 1914–1951'' (Oxford, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garside, W.R.; Greaves, J.I. (1997). "Rationalisation and Britain's industrial Malaise: The interwar years revisited". ''Journal of European Economic History''. '''26''' (1): 37–68.&lt;/ref&gt; as the Liberal Party vied with the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] for control of the left. After the [[Second World War]], the first Labour government (1945–1951) under [[Clement Attlee]] embarked on a program of nationalization of industry and the promotion of social welfare. The Conservatives generally accepted those policies until the 1980s.

Other conservative political parties, such as the [[United Kingdom Independence Party]] (UKIP, founded in 1993), [[Northern Ireland]]'s [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP) and the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP, founded in 1971), began to appear, although they have yet to make any significant impact at Westminster ({{as of |2014 |lc = on}}, the DUP comprises the largest political party in the ruling coalition in the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]]), and since 2017 the DUP has provided support for the Conservative [[Second May ministry|minority government]].

==== France ====
[[File:Jmaistre.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Joseph de Maistre]] (1753–1821)]]
Another form of conservatism developed in France in parallel to conservatism in Britain. It was influenced by [[Counter-Enlightenment]] works by men such as [[Joseph de Maistre]] and [[Louis de Bonald]]. Latin conservatism was less pragmatic and more [[reactionary]] than the conservatism of Burke.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} Many continental or traditionalist conservatives do not support [[separation of church and state]], with most supporting state recognition of and cooperation with the [[Catholic Church in France|Catholic Church]], such as had existed in France before the Revolution.

Eventually, conservatives added [[Gaullism]], [[patriotism]], and [[nationalism]] to the list of traditional values they support. Conservatives were the first to embrace nationalism, which was previously associated with [[liberalism]] and the Revolution in France.&lt;ref&gt;ams, Ian Political Ideology Today (2nd edition), Manchester University Press, 2002, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Germany ====
{{Main|Conservatism in Germany}}
Conservatism developed alongside nationalism in Germany, culminating in Germany's victory over France in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], the creation of the unified [[German Empire]] in 1871 and the simultaneous rise of [[Otto von Bismarck]] on the European political stage. Bismarck's "balance of power" model maintained peace in Europe for decades at the end of the 19th century. His "revolutionary conservatism" was a conservative state-building strategy designed to make ordinary Germans—not just the Junker elite—more loyal to state and emperor, he created the modern welfare state in Germany in the 1880s. According to Kees van Kersbergen and Barbara Vis, his strategy was: {{Quote|[G]ranting social rights to enhance the integration of a hierarchical society, to forge a bond between workers and the state so as to strengthen the latter, to maintain traditional relations of authority between social and status groups, and to provide a countervailing power against the modernist forces of liberalism and socialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kersbergen|first1=Kees van|last2=Vis|first2=Barbara|title=Comparative Welfare State Politics: Development, Opportunities, and Reform|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UQL3AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA38|year=2013|publisher=Cambridge UP|page=38|isbn=9781107652477}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Bismarck also enacted universal male suffrage in the new German Empire in 1871.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moore|first1=Robert Laurence|last2=Vaudagna|first2=Maurizio|title=The American Century in Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PeoqKSxiOu4C&amp;pg=PA226|year=2003|publisher=Cornell University Press|page=226|isbn=0801440750}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a great hero to German conservatives, who erected many monuments to his memory after he left office in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frankel|first=Richard|date=|year=2003|title=From the Beer Halls to the Halls of Power: The Cult of Bismarck and the Legitimization of a New German Right, 1898–1945|url=|journal=German Studies Review|volume=26|issue=3|pages=543–60|doi=10.2307/1432746|jstor=1432746|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the rise of [[Nazism]] in 1933, [[agrarianism|agrarian movements]] faded and was supplanted by a more command-based economy and forced social integration. Though [[Adolf Hitler]] succeeded in garnering the support of many German industrialists, prominent traditionalists openly and secretly opposed his policies of euthanasia, genocide and attacks on organized religion, including [[Claus von Stauffenberg]], [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]], [[Henning von Tresckow]], Bishop [[Clemens August Graf von Galen]] and the monarchist [[Carl Friedrich Goerdeler]].

More recently, the work of conservative [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|Christian Democratic Union]] leader and Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] helped bring about [[German reunification]], along with the closer integration of Europe in the form of the [[Maastricht Treaty]].

Three conservative leaders in the EPP included [[Prime Minister of Spain]] [[Mariano Rajoy]] (2011-18), [[Chancellor of Germany]] [[Angela Merkel]] and [[Prime Minister of Hungary]] [[Viktor Orbán]].]]
Today, German conservatism is often associated with politicians such as Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]], whose tenure has been marked by attempts to save the common European currency ([[Euro]]) from demise. The German conservatives are divided under Merkel due to the refugee crisis in Germany and many conservatives in the [[CDU/CSU]] oppose the refugee and migrant policies developed under Merkel.

==== United States ====
{{Main|Conservatism in the United States}}
American conservatism is a broad system of political beliefs in the [[United States]] that is characterized by respect for American traditions, support for [[Judeo-Christian ethics|Judeo-Christian]] values, [[economic liberalism]], [[anti-communism]] and a defense of [[Western culture]]. [[Liberty]] within the bounds of conformity to Conservatism is a core value, with a particular emphasis on strengthening the [[free market]], limiting the size and scope of government and opposition to high taxes and government or labor union encroachment on the entrepreneur.

The major conservative party in the United States is the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], also known as the GOP (Grand Old Party). American conservatives consider [[individualism|individual liberty]] as long as it conforms to Conservative values, [[small government]], [[deregulation]] of the government, [[economic liberalism]] and [[free trade]], as the fundamental traits of democracy, which contrasts with [[Modern Liberalism in the United States|modern American liberals]], who generally place a greater value on [[social equality]] and [[social justice]].&lt;ref&gt;Gregory L. Schneider, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=IVD3z0PuTRQC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Conservative Century: From Reaction to Revolution]'' "The label (conservatism) is in frequent use and has come to stand for a skepticism, at times an outright hostility, toward government social policies; a muscular foreign policy combined with a patriotic nationalism; a defense of traditional Christian religious values; and support for the free market economic system.", "Within the conservative disposition in America there are inherent contradictions between supporters of social order and tradition and supporters of individual freedom.", (2009) pp. 4–9, 136&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sherwood Thompson, ''Encyclopedia of Diversity and Social Justice''  p. 7: "Historically...social justice became associated with liberalism in which equality is the ideal.", Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2014, {{ISBN|978-1442216044}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Historic conservatism in different countries ===
{{Further|Right-wing politics|Political spectrum}}
Conservative political parties vary widely from country to country in the goals they wish to achieve. Both conservative and liberal parties tend to favor private ownership of property, in opposition to communist, socialist and green parties, which favor communal ownership or laws requiring social responsibility on the part of property owners. Where conservatives and liberals differ is primarily on social issues. Conservatives tend to reject behavior that does not [[conformity|conform]] to some [[social norm]]. Modern conservative parties often define themselves by their opposition to liberal or labor parties. The United States usage of the term "conservative" is unique to that country.&lt;ref&gt;Ware, Alan. ''Political Parties and Party Systems''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996. {{ISBN|978-0-19-878076-2}}, pp. 31–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Alan Ware, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Greece, Iceland, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom retained viable conservative parties into the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Ware, Alan. ''Political Parties and Party Systems''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996. {{ISBN|978-0-19-878076-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ware said that Australia, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, Malta, New Zealand, Spain and the United States had no conservative parties, although they had either Christian democrats or liberals as major right-wing parties. Canada, Ireland and Portugal had right-wing political parties that defied categorization: the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada]]; [[Fianna Fáil]], [[Fine Gael]] and [[Progressive Democrats]] in Ireland; and the [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic Party of Portugal]].&lt;ref&gt;Ware, Alan. ''Political Parties and Party Systems''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996. {{ISBN|978-0-19-878076-2}}, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the [[Swiss People's Party]] has moved to the extreme right and is no longer considered to be conservative.&lt;ref&gt;Flecker, Jörg.

[[Klaus von Beyme]], who developed the method of party categorization, found that no modern Eastern European parties could be considered conservative, although the communist and communist-successor parties had strong similarities.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Paul G.

[[Louis Hartz]] explained the absence of conservatism in Australia or the United States as a result of their settlement as radical or liberal fragments of Great Britain. Although he said English Canada had a negligible conservative influence, subsequent writers claimed that [[United Empire Loyalist|loyalists]] opposed to the American Revolution brought a Tory ideology into Canada. Hartz explained conservatism in Quebec and Latin America as a result of their settlement as feudal societies.&lt;ref&gt;Fierlbeck, Katherine. ''Political thought in Canada: an intellectual history''.

Conservative elites have long dominated Latin American nations. Mostly, this has been achieved through control of and support for civil institutions, the church and the armed forces, rather than through party politics. Typically, the church was exempt from taxes and its employees immune from civil prosecution. Where national conservative parties were weak or non-existent, conservatives were more likely to rely on military dictatorship as a preferred form of government. However, in some nations where the elites were able to mobilize popular support for conservative parties, longer periods of political stability were achieved. Chile, Colombia and Venezuela are examples of nations that developed strong conservative parties. Argentina, Brazil, El Salvador and Peru are examples of nations where this did not occur.&lt;ref&gt;Middlebrook, Kevin J. ''Conservative parties, the right, and democracy in Latin America''.

==== Belgium ====
Having its roots in the conservative [[Catholic Party (Belgium)|Catholic Party]], the [[Christen-Democratisch en Vlaams|Christian People's Party]], retained a conservative edge through the twentieth century, supporting the king in the [[Royal Question]], supporting [[nuclear family]] as the cornerstone of society, defending Christian education and opposing [[euthanasia]]. The Christian People's Party dominated politics in post-war Belgium. In 1999, the party's support collapsed and it became the country's fifth largest party.&lt;ref&gt;Annesley, Claire.

==== Canada ====
{{Main|Conservatism in Canada}}
Canada's conservatives had their roots in the loyalists Tories who left America after the American Revolution. They developed in the socio-economic and political cleavages that existed during the first three decades of the 19th century and had the support of the business, professional and established Church (Anglican) elites in Ontario and to a lesser extent in Quebec. Holding a monopoly over administrative and judicial offices, they were called the "[[Family Compact]]" in Ontario and the "[[Chateau Clique]]" in Quebec. [[John A. Macdonald]]'s successful leadership of the movement to confederate the provinces and his subsequent tenure as prime minister for most of the late 19th century rested on his ability to bring together the English-speaking Protestant oligarchy and the [[ultramontane]] Catholic hierarchy of Quebec and to keep them united in a conservative coalition.&lt;ref&gt;Kornberg, Allan and Mishler, William. ''Influence in Parliament, Canada''. Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1976. p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

The conservatives combined [[Economic liberalism|pro-market liberalism]] and [[Toryism]]. They generally supported an activist government and state intervention in the marketplace and their policies were marked by ''[[noblesse oblige]]'', a paternalistic responsibility of the elites for the less well-off.&lt;ref&gt;Schultze, Rainer-Olaf; Sturm, Roland and Eberle, Dagmar. ''Conservative parties and right-wing politics in North America: reaping the benefits of an ideological victory?''. Germany: VS Verlag, 2003. {{ISBN|978-3-8100-3812-8}} p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; From 1942, the party was known as the Progressive Conservatives until 2003, when the national party merged with the [[Canadian Alliance]] to form the [[Conservative Party of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;Panizza, Francisco. ''Populism and the mirror of democracy''. London: Verso, 2005. {{ISBN|978-1-85984-489-2}} p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;

The conservative [[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]] governed the province of Quebec in periods from 1936 to 1960 and in a close alliance with English Canadian business elites and the Catholic Church. This period, known as the [[Grande Noirceur|Great Darkness]], ended with the [[Quiet Revolution]] and the party went into terminal decline.&lt;ref&gt;Conway, John Frederick.

The modern [[Conservative Party of Canada]] has rebranded conservatism and under the leadership of [[Stephen Harper]], the Conservative Party add more conservative policies.

==== Colombia ====
{{Main|Conservatism in Colombia}}
The [[Colombian Conservative Party]], founded in 1849, traces its origins to opponents of General [[Francisco de Paula Santander]]'s 1833–1837 administration. While the term "liberal" had been used to describe all political forces in Colombia, the conservatives began describing themselves as "conservative liberals" and their opponents as "red liberals". From the 1860s until the present, the party has supported strong central government; supported the Catholic Church, especially its role as protector of the sanctity of the family; and opposed separation of church and state. Its policies include the legal equality of all men, the citizen's right to own property and opposition to dictatorship. It has usually been Colombia's second largest party, with the [[Colombian Liberal Party]] being the largest.&lt;ref&gt;Osterling, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Denmark ====
Founded in 1915, the [[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservative People's Party of Denmark]]. was the successor of ''Højre'' (literally "[[Right-wing politics|Right"]]). The conservative party led the government coalition from 1982 to 1993. The party was a junior partner in coalition with the [[Venstre (Denmark)|Liberals]] from 2001 to 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Annesley, Claire. ''A political and economic dictionary of Western Europe''. London: Routledge, 2005. {{ISBN|978-1-85743-214-5}}, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; The party is preceded by 11 years by the [[Young Conservatives (Denmark)|Young Conservatives (KU)]], today the youth movement of the party. The party suffered a major defeat in the parliamentary elections of September 2011 in which the party lost more than half of its seat and also lost governmental power. A liberal cultural policy dominated during the postwar period. However, by the 1990s disagreements regarding immigrants from entirely different cultures ignited a conservative backlash.&lt;ref&gt;Kasper Støvring,  "The Turn from Cultural Radicalism to National Conservatism: Cultural Policy in Denmark." ''Telos'' 2009.148  (2009) pp. 54–72&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Finland ====
The conservative party in Finland is the [[National Coalition Party]] (in Finnish ''Kansallinen Kokoomus'', ''Kok''). The party was founded in 1918 when several monarchist parties united. Although in the past the party was right-wing, today it is a moderate liberal conservative party. While the party advocates [[economic liberalism]], it is committed to the [[social market economy]].&lt;ref&gt;Siaroff, Alan.

==== France ====

Conservatism in France focused on the rejection of the secularism of the French Revolution, support for the role of the Catholic Church and the restoration of the monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;E.L.

Following the Second World War, conservatives in France supported Gaullist groups and have been nationalistic and emphasized tradition, order and the regeneration of France.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Vinen, "The Parti républicain de la Liberté and the Reconstruction of French Conservatism, 1944–1951," ''French History'' (1993) 7#2 pp. 183–204&lt;/ref&gt; Gaullists held divergent views on social issues. The number of conservative groups, their lack of stability and their tendency to be identified with local issues defy simple categorization. Conservatism has been the major political force in France since the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;Viereck, Peter and Ryn, Claes G. New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Publishers, 2005. {{ISBN|978-0-7658-0576-8}} p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; Unusually, post-war French conservatism was formed around the personality of a leader, [[Charles de Gaulle]]; and did not draw on traditional French conservatism, but on the [[Bonapartism]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Ware, Alan.

==== Greece ====
The main interwar conservative party was called the [[People's Party (Greece)|People's Party]] (PP), which supported [[Greek monarchy|constitutional monarchy]] and opposed the [[Second Hellenic Republic|republican]] [[Liberal Party (Greece)|Liberal Party]]. Both it and the Liberal party were suppressed by the authoritarian, arch-conservative and royalist [[4th of August Regime]] of [[Ioannis Metaxas]] in 1936–1941. The PP was able to re-group after the Second World War as part of a United Nationalist Front which achieved power campaigning on a simple anticommunist, ultranationalist platform during the [[Greek Civil War]] (1946–1949). However, the vote received by the PP declined during the so-called "Centrist Interlude" in 1950–1952. In 1952, Marshal [[Alexandros Papagos]] created the [[Greek Rally]] as an umbrella for the right-wing forces. The Greek Rally came to power in 1952 and remained the leading party in Greece until 1963—after Papagos' death in 1955 reformed as the [[National Radical Union]] under [[Konstantinos Karamanlis]]. Right-wing governments backed by the palace and the army overthrew the [[Centre Union]] government in 1965 and governed the country until the establishment of the far-right [[Regime of the Colonels]] (1967–1974). After the [[metapolitefsi|regime's collapse]] in August 1974, Karamanlis returned from exile to lead the government and founded the [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] party. The new conservative party had four objectives: to confront [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|Turkish expansionism in Cyprus]], to reestablish and solidify democratic rule, to give the country a strong government and to make a powerful moderate party a force in Greek politics.&lt;ref&gt;Penniman, Howard Rae. ''Greece at the polls: the national elections of 1974 and 1977''.  Washington: American Enterprise Institute, 1981. {{ISBN|978-0-8447-3434-7}} pp. 49–59&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Independent Greeks]], a newly formed political party in [[Greece]], has also supported conservatism, particularly [[National conservatism|national]] and [[religious conservatism]]. The Founding Declaration of the Independent Greeks strongly emphasises in the preservation of the Greek state and its [[sovereignty]], the [[Greek people]] and the [[Greek Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://anexartitoiellines.gr/files/idritiki%20diakirixi.pdf Founding Declaration of Independent Greeks]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Iceland ====
Founded in 1924 as the [[Conservative Party (Iceland)|Conservative Party]], Iceland's [[Independence Party (Iceland)|Independence Party]] adopted its current name in 1929 after the merger with the [[Liberal Party (Iceland, historical)|Liberal Party]]. From the beginning, they have been the largest vote-winning party, averaging around 40%. They combined liberalism and conservatism, supported nationalization of infrastructure and opposed class conflict. While mostly in opposition during the 1930s, they embraced [[economic liberalism]], but accepted the welfare state after the war and participated in governments supportive of state intervention and protectionism. Unlike other Scandanivian conservative (and liberal) parties, it has always had a large working-class following.&lt;ref&gt;Grofman, Bernard and Lijpart, Arend, editors.

Hardarson {{ISBN|978-0-87586-138-8}}, pp. 107–08&lt;/ref&gt; After the financial crisis in 2008, the party has sunk to a lower support level around 20–25%.

==== Italy ====
After World War II, in [[Italy]] the conservative parties were mainly represented by the [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]] (DC) party, which government form the foundation of the Republic until party's dissolution in 1994. Officially, DC refused the ideology of conservatism, but in many aspects, for example [[family values]], it was a typical [[social conservative]] party.

In 1994, the media tycoon and entrepreneur [[Silvio Berlusconi]] founded the [[liberal conservative]] party [[Forza Italia]] (FI). Berlusconi won three elections in [[Italian general election, 1994|1994]], [[Italian general election, 2001|2001]] and [[Italian general election, 2008|2008]], governing the country for almost ten years as [[Prime Minister of Italy|Prime Minister]]. Forza Italia formed a coalition with right-wing regional party [[Lega Nord]] while in government.

Besides FI, now the conservative ideas are mainly expressed by the [[New Centre-Right]] party led by [[Angelino Alfano]], Berlusconi form a new party, which is the reborn [[Forza Italia (2013)|Forza Italia]] founding a new conservative movement. Alfano was the current [[Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs|Minister of Foreign Affairs]]. After the [[Italian general election, 2018|2018 election]], [[Lega Nord]] and the [[Five Star Movement]] formed the [[right-wing populist]] government.

==== Luxembourg ====
Luxembourg's major [[Christian democratic]] conservative party, the [[Christian Social People's Party]] (CSV or PCS), was formed as the Party of the Right in 1914 and adopted its present name in 1945. It was consistently the largest political party in Luxembourg and dominated politics throughout the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Urwin, Derek W.

==== Norway ====
The [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party of Norway]] (Norwegian: Høyre, literally "[[Right-wing politics|right"]]) was formed by the old upper class of state officials and wealthy merchants to fight the populist democracy of the [[Liberal Party (Norway)|Liberal Party]], but lost power in 1884 when parliamentarian government was first practised. It formed its first government under parliamentarism in 1889 and continued to alternate in power with the Liberals until the 1930s, when Labour became the dominant political party. It has elements both of paternalism, stressing the responsibilities of the state and of economic liberalism. It first returned to power in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Knut Heidar|Heidar, Knut]].

==== Switzerland ====
There are a number of conservative parties in Switzerland's parliament, the Federal Assembly. These include the largest, the [[Swiss People's Party]] (SVP),&lt;ref name="Hans-Georg"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ziebertz|first=Hans-Georg|title=How Teachers in Europe Teach Religion: An International Empirical Study: An International Empirical Study in 16 Countries|year=2011|publisher=Lit Verlag|isbn=978-3-643-10043-6|page=237}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Christian Democratic People's Party of Switzerland|Christian Democratic People's Party]] (CVP)&lt;ref name=Juravich&gt;{{cite book|last=Juravich|first=Tom|title=Ravenswood: The Steelworkers' Victory and the Revival of American Labor|year=2000|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-8666-1|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Conservative Democratic Party of Switzerland]] (BDP),&lt;ref name=Schwok&gt;{{cite book|last=Schwok|first=René|title=Switzerland – European Union: An Impossible Membership?|year=2009|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=978-90-5201-576-7|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a splinter of the SVP created in the aftermath to the election of Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf as Federal Council.&lt;ref name="Schwok"/&gt; The right-wing parties have a majority in the Federal Assembly.

The [[Swiss People's Party]] (SVP or UDC) was formed from the 1971 merger of the [[Party of Farmers, Traders and Independents|Party of Farmers, Traders and Citizens]], formed in 1917 and the smaller Swiss Democratic Party, formed in 1942. The SVP emphasized agricultural policy and was strong among farmers in German-speaking Protestant areas. As Switzerland considered closer relations with the European Union in the 1990s, the SVP adopted a more militant protectionist and isolationist stance. This stance has allowed it to expand into German-speaking Catholic mountainous areas.&lt;ref&gt;Siaroff, Alan ''Comparative European Party Systems''. New York: Garland, 2000. {{ISBN|0-8153-2930-X}} p. 446&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Anti-Defamation League]], a non-Swiss lobby group based in the United States has accused them of manipulating issues such as immigration, Swiss neutrality and welfare benefits, awakening antisemitism and racism.&lt;ref&gt;The Stephen Roth Institute. ''Anti-semitism worldwide'' Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2002 {{ISBN|0-8032-5943-3}} p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Council of Europe]] has called the SVP "extreme right", although some scholars dispute this classification. For instance, Hans-Georg Betz describes it as "populist radical right".&lt;ref&gt;Hainsworth, pp. 44, 74&lt;/ref&gt; The SVP is the largest party since 2003.

==== United Kingdom ====
{{Main|Conservatism in the United Kingdom}}
According to historian James Sack, English conservatives celebrate [[Edmund Burke]] as their intellectual father.&lt;ref&gt;James J. Sack, "The Memory of Burke and the Memory of Pitt; English Conservatism Confronts its Past, 1806–1829" (1987) 623–40.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke was affiliated with the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig Party]] which eventually became the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], but the modern [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] is generally thought to derive from the [[Tories (British political party)|Tory party]] and the MPs of the modern conservative party are still frequently referred to as Tories.

=== Modern conservatism in different countries ===
While conservatism has been seen as an appeal to traditional, hierarchical society, some writers such as [[Samuel P. Huntington]] see it as situational. Under this definition, conservatives are seen as defending the established institutions of their time.&lt;ref&gt;Winthrop and Lovell, pp. 163–66&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Australia ====
{{Main|Conservatism in Australia}}
The [[Liberal Party of Australia]] adheres to the principles of [[social conservatism]] and [[liberal conservatism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dennis Raphael|title=Tackling Health Inequalities: Lessons from International Experiences|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zjh4lQAbPrYC&amp;pg=PA66|year=2012|publisher=Canadian Scholars’ Press|isbn=978-1-55130-412-0|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is liberal in the sense of economics. Other conservative parties are the [[National Party of Australia]], a sister party of the Liberals, [[Family First Party]], [[Democratic Labour Party (Australia)|Democratic Labor Party]], [[Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party]], [[Australian Conservatives]] and the [[Katter's Australian Party]].

The second largest party in the country is the [[Australian Labor Party]] and its dominant faction is [[Labor Right]], a [[socially conservative]] element. Australia undertook significant economic reform under the Labor Party in the mid-1980s. Consequently, issues like protectionism, welfare reform, privatization and deregulation are no longer debated in the political space as they are in Europe or North America. Moser and Catley explain: "In America, 'liberal' means left-of-center, and it is a pejorative term when used by conservatives in adversarial political debate. In Australia, of course, the conservatives are in the Liberal Party".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Mosler|author2=Robert Catley|title=America and Americans in Australia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YungugjvIaQC&amp;pg=PA83|year=1998|page=83|isbn=9780275962524}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jupp points out that, "[the] decline in English influences on Australian reformism and radicalism, and appropriation of the symbols of Empire by conservatives continued under the Liberal Party leadership of Sir [[Robert Menzies]], which lasted until 1966".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Jupp|title=The English in Australia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n63TaXC5TpEC&amp;pg=PA172|year=2004|page=172|isbn=9780521542951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Russia ====
Under [[Vladimir Putin]], the dominant leader since 1999, Russia has promoted explicitly conservative policies in social, cultural and political matters, both at home and abroad. Putin has attacked globalism and economic liberalism. Putin has promoted new think tanks that bring together like-minded intellectuals and writers. For example, the Izborsky Club, founded in 2012 by Aleksandr Prokhanov, stresses Russian nationalism, the restoration of Russia's historical greatness and systematic opposition to liberal ideas and policies.&lt;ref&gt;Marlene Laruelle, "The Izborsky Club, or the New Conservative Avant‐Garde in Russia."

In cultural and social affairs, Putin has collaborated closely with the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. Mark Woods provides specific examples of how the Church under [[Patriarch Kirill of Moscow]] has backed the expansion of Russian power into Crimea and eastern Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Woods, "How the Russian Orthodox Church is backing Vladimir Putin's new world order" [http://www.christiantoday.com/article/how.the.russian.orthodox.church.is.backing.vladimir.putins.new.world.order/81108.htm  ''Christian Today'' March 3, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; More broadly, ''The New York Times'' reports in September 2016 how that Church's policy prescriptions support the Kremlin's appeal to social conservatives:
: A fervent foe of homosexuality and any attempt to put individual rights above those of family, community or nation, the Russian Orthodox Church helps project Russia as the natural ally of all those who pine for a more secure, illiberal world free from the tradition-crushing rush of globalization, multiculturalism and women’s and gay rights.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Higgins, "In Expanding Russian Influence, Faith Combines With Firepower," [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/14/world/europe/russia-orthodox-church.html ''New York Times'' Sept 13, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== South Korea ====
{{Main|Conservatism in South Korea}}
[[South Korea]]'s major conservative party, the [[Liberty Korea Party]], has changed its form throughout its history. First it was the Democratic-Republican Party (1963–1980) and its head was [[Park Chung-hee]], who seized power in a 1961 military coup d'état and ruled as an unelected military strongman until his formal election as President in [[South Korean presidential election, 1963|1963]]. He was President for 16 years until his assassination on 26 October 1979. The [[Democratic Justice Party]] inherited the same ideology as the Democratic-Republican Party. Its head, [[Chun Doo-hwan]], also gained power through a coup and his followers called themselves the Hanahae. The Democratic Justice Party changed its form and acted to suppress the opposition party and to follow the people's demand for direct elections. The party's [[Roh Tae-woo]] became the first President who was elected through direct election. The next form of the major conservative party was the Democratic-Liberal Party and again through election its second leader, [[Kim Young-sam]], became the fourteenth President of Korea. When the conservative party was beaten by the opposition party in the general election, it changed its form again to follow the party members' demand for reforms. It became the New Korean Party, but it changed again one year later since the President Kim Young-sam was blamed by the citizen for the [[International Monetary Fund]].{{clarify|date=March 2014}} It changed its name to Grand National Party (GNP). Since the late [[Kim Dae-jung]] assumed the presidency in 1998, GNP had been the opposition party until [[Lee Myung-bak]] won the presidential election of [[South Korean presidential election, 2007|2007]].

The meaning of "conservatism" in the United States has little in common with the way the word is used elsewhere. As Ribuffo (2011) notes, "what Americans now call conservatism much of the world calls liberalism or neoliberalism".&lt;ref&gt;Leo P. Ribuffo, "20 Suggestions for Studying the Right now that Studying the Right is Trendy," ''Historically Speaking'' Jan 2011 v.12#1 pp. 2–6, quote on p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1950s, conservatism in the United States has been chiefly associated with the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. However, during the era of [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] many [[Southern Democrats]] were conservatives and they played a key role in the [[Conservative coalition]] that largely controlled domestic policy in Congress from 1937 to 1963,&lt;ref&gt;Kari Frederickson, ''The Dixicrat Revolt and the End of the Solid South, 1932–1968'', p. 12, "...conservative southern Democrats viewed warily the potential of New Deal programs to threaten the region's economic dependence on cheap labor while stirring the democratic ambitions of the disfranchised and undermining white supremacy.", The University of North Carolina Press, 2000, {{ISBN|978-0-8078-4910-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Conservative Democrat]]s continued to have influence in the U.S. politics until 1994's [[Republican Revolution]], when the American South shifted from solid Democrat to solid Republican, while maintaining its conservative values.

Major priorities within American conservatism include support for the [[traditional family]], [[Law and order (politics)|law and order]], the [[right to bear arms]]. [[Christian values]], [[anti-communism]] and a defense of "[[Western civilization]] from the challenges of modernist culture and totalitarian governments".&lt;ref name="GregorySchneider"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Conservative Century: From Reaction to Revolution|last=Schneider|first=Gregory|publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]]|year=2009|isbn=|location=|page=xii|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic conservatives and libertarians favor [[small government]], low taxes, limited regulation and free enterprise. Some social conservatives see traditional social values threatened by secularism, so they support [[school prayer]] and [[Opposition to the legalization of abortion|oppose abortion]] and [[homosexuality]].&lt;ref name=Social&gt;{{cite book|title=Texas Politics: Governing the Lone Star State|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fQFZCrbc9mIC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;q=social%20conservatism%20abortion%20marriage|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|accessdate=19 January 2012|author=Cal Jillson|date=22 February 2011|quote=Social conservatives focus on moral or values issues, such as abortion, marriage, school prayer, and judicial appointments.|isbn=9780203829417}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neoconservatives]] want to expand American ideals throughout the world and show a strong support for Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Frohnen, ed.

The conservative movement of the 1950s attempted to bring together these divergent strands, stressing the need for unity to prevent the spread of "Godless communism", which Reagan later labeled an "[[Evil Empire speech|evil empire]]".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Edward Gottfried, ''Conservatism in America: Making Sense of the American Right'', p. 9, "Postwar conservatives set about creating their own synthesis of free-market capitalism, Christian morality, and the global struggle against Communism." (2009); Gottfried, ''Theologies and moral concern'' (1995) p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Reagan administration]], conservatives also supported the so-called "[[Reagan Doctrine]]" under which the U.S. as part of a Cold War strategy provided military and other support to guerrilla insurgencies that were fighting governments identified as socialist or communist. The Reagan administration also adopted [[Neoliberalism]] and [[trickle-down economics]], as well as [[Reaganomics]], which made for economic growth in the 1980s, fueled by trillion dollar deficits.

Other modern conservative positions include opposition to [[big government]] and [[opposition to environmentalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Jacques; Riley E. Dunlap; Mark Freeman, ''The organisation of denial: Conservative think tanks and environmental scepticism'', Environmental Politics. v12 m3 (2008), pp. 349–85&lt;/ref&gt; On average, American conservatives desire tougher foreign policies than liberals do.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=23736 Peter Hays Gries, ''The Politics of American Foreign Policy: How Ideology Divides Liberals and Conservatives over Foreign Affairs'' (Stanford, 2014).]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Economic liberalism]], [[deregulation]] and [[social conservatism]] are main principles of the Republican Party.

Most recently, the [[Tea Party movement]], founded in 2009, has proven a large outlet for populist American conservative ideas. Their stated goals include rigorous adherence to the U.S. Constitution, lower taxes and opposition to a growing role for the federal government in health care. Electorally, it was considered a key force in Republicans reclaiming control of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Theda Skocpol and Vanessa Williamson, ''The Tea Party and the Remaking of Republican Conservatism'' (2012) pp. 45–82&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-12030-503544.html|title=Katie Couric Interviews Tea Party Leaders|date=25 January 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Psychology ==
{{See also|Biology and political orientation}}
Following the Second World War, psychologists conducted research into the different motives and tendencies that account for ideological differences between left and right. The early studies focused on conservatives, beginning with [[Theodor W. Adorno]]'s ''[[The Authoritarian Personality]]'' (1950) based on the [[F-scale (personality test)|F-scale]] personality test. This book has been heavily criticized on theoretical and methodological grounds, but some of its findings have been confirmed by further empirical research.&lt;ref name="Jost, J.J 2003"&gt;Jost, J.J, Glaser, J., Kruglanski, A.A., &amp; Sulloway, F.J. (2003). Political conservatism as motivated social cognition. ''Psychological Bulletin'', 129:(3), pp. 339–75.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, British psychologist [[Glenn Wilson (psychologist)|Glenn Wilson]] published an influential book providing evidence that a general factor underlying conservative beliefs is "fear of uncertainty".&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, G.D. (Ed.)(1973) The Psychology of Conservatism, London: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; A meta-analysis of research literature by Jost, Glaser, Kruglanski and Sulloway in 2003 found that many factors, such as [[Ambiguity tolerance|intolerance of ambiguity]] and need for [[Cognitive closure (psychology)|cognitive closure]], contribute to the degree of one's political conservatism.&lt;ref name="Jost, J.J 2003"/&gt; A study by Kathleen Maclay stated these traits "might be associated with such generally valued characteristics as personal commitment and unwavering loyalty". The research also suggested that while most people are resistant to change, liberals are more tolerant of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2003/07/22_politics.shtml|title=Researchers help define what makes a political conservative|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to psychologist [[Bob Altemeyer]], individuals who are politically conservative tend to rank high in [[right-wing authoritarianism]] (RWA) on his RWA scale.&lt;ref&gt;Altemeyer, B. (1981). Right-wing authoritarianism. Winnipeg, Canada: University of Manitoba Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This finding was echoed by [[Theodor Adorno]]. A study done on Israeli and Palestinian students in Israel found that RWA scores of right-wing party supporters were significantly higher than those of left-wing party supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rubinstein|first1=G.|doi=10.1177/0022022196272005|title=Two Peoples in One Land: A Validation Study of Altemeyer's Right-Wing Authoritarianism Scale in the Palestinian and Jewish Societies in Israel|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology|year=1996|volume=27|pages=216–230|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2005 study by H. Michael Crowson and colleagues suggested a moderate gap between RWA and other conservative positions: "The results indicated that conservatism is not synonymous with RWA".&lt;ref&gt;Crowson, H. Michael, Stephen J. Thoma, and Nita Hestevold. "Is political conservatism synonymous with authoritarianism?." ''The Journal of Social Psychology'' 145.5 (Oct 2005): 571(22). Expanded Academic ASAP. Gale. Remote Access. 20 May 2009 [http://find.galegroup.com/itx/start.do?prodId=EAIM Galegroup.com].&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist Felicia Pratto and her colleagues have found evidence to support the idea that a high [[social dominance orientation]] (SDO) is strongly correlated with conservative political views and opposition to social engineering to promote equality,&lt;ref name="pratto"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pratto|first1=Felicia|last2=Sidanius|first2=Jim|last3=Stallworth|first3=Lisa M.|last4=Malle|first4=Bertram F.|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.67.4.741|title=Social dominance orientation: A personality variable predicting social and political attitudes|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1994|volume=67|pages=741–763|issue=4|url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:3207711}}&lt;/ref&gt; though Pratto's findings have been highly controversial{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} as Pratto and her colleagues found that high SDO scores were highly correlated with measures of [[prejudice]]. However, [[David J. Schneider]] argued for a more complex relationships between the three factors, writing "correlations between prejudice and political conservative are reduced virtually to zero when controls for SDO are instituted, suggesting that the conservatism–prejudice link is caused by SDO".&lt;ref&gt;The psychology of stereotyping, David J. Schneider,  Guilford Press, 2005 {{ISBN|978-1-59385-193-4}}  p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth Minogue]] criticized Pratto's work, saying: "It is characteristic of the conservative temperament to value established identities, to praise habit and to respect prejudice, not because it is irrational, but because such things anchor the darting impulses of human beings in solidities of custom which we do not often begin to value until we are already losing them. Radicalism often generates youth movements, while conservatism is a condition found among the mature, who have discovered what it is in life they most value".&lt;ref&gt;The Social science encyclopedia, Jessica Kuper, Taylor &amp; Francis, 1985 {{ISBN|978-0-7102-0008-2}} pp. 155–156.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1996 study on the relationship between racism and conservatism found that the correlation was stronger among more educated individuals, though "anti-Black affect had essentially no relationship with political conservatism at any level of educational or intellectual sophistication". They also found that the correlation between racism and conservatism could be entirely accounted for by their mutual relationship with social dominance orientation.&lt;ref name="sidanius96"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.70.3.476|last1=Sidanius|first1=J|last2=Pratto|first2=F|last3=Bobo|first3=L|year=1996|title=Racism, conservatism, affirmative action, and intellectual sophistication: A matter of principled conservatism or group dominance?|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=70|issue=3|pages=476–490|url=http://www.scholar.harvard.edu/files/bobo/files/1996_racism_conservatism_affirmative_action_and_journal_of_personality_and_social_psychology.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 research report found that conservatives are happier than liberals and that—as income inequality increases—this difference in relative happiness increases because conservatives (more than liberals) possess an ideological buffer against the negative hedonic effects of [[economic inequality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Napier|first1=J.

The '''Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women''' ('''CEDAW''') is an international treaty adopted in 1979 by the [[United Nations General Assembly]].
Described as an international [[bill of rights]] for women, it was instituted on 3 September 1981 and has been ratified by 189 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-8&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en|title=United Nations Treaty Collection|author=|date=|website=un.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906035454/https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-8&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en|archivedate=6 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over fifty countries that have ratified the Convention have done so subject to certain declarations, reservations, and objections, including 38 countries who rejected the enforcement article 29, which addresses means of settlement for disputes concerning the interpretation or application of the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/reservations-country.htm |title=Declarations, Reservations and Objections to CEDAW |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2011-09-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111222104936/http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/reservations-country.htm |archivedate=22 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia's declaration noted the limitations on central government power resulting from its federal constitutional system. The [[United States]] and [[Palau]] have signed, but not ratified the treaty. The [[Holy See]], [[Iran]], [[Somalia]], [[Sudan]], and [[Tonga]] are not signatories to CEDAW.

The CEDAW Chairperson position is currently held by Dalia Leinarte.

==CEDAW with UNSCR 1325 and 1820==
[[File:Map5.1Discrepant Behavior compressed.jpg|right|400px|thumb| A world map showing countries by CEDAW enforcement, 2010.]]
'''Resolutions 1325 10th anniversary events highlight use of CEDAW mechanisms&lt;ref name="gnwp"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gnwp.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Cedaw-1325-1820-synergy2.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501140626/http://www.gnwp.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Cedaw-1325-1820-synergy2.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-05-01 |title=Ensuring Accountability to UNSCR 1325 and 1820 using CEDAW reporting mechanisms |date=November 2010 |website=gnwp.org |publisher=Global Network of Women Peacebuilders |accessdate=5 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;'''

The 10th anniversary of Resolution 1325 in October 2010 highlighted the increasing demand for accountability to UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security. Many expressed concern about the fact that only 22 Member States out of 192 have adopted national action plans. Women are still underrepresented, if not totally absent, in most official peace negotiations and sexual violence in peacetime and in conflict continue to increase.

These realities emphasized the need to use external legal mechanisms to strengthen the implementation of SCR 1325, particularly CEDAW. The well-established mechanisms of CEDAW – the Member States compliance report and the civil society shadow reporting process were cited as possible instruments to ensure accountability.

Several regional and international meetings including the High Level Seminar "1325 in 2020: Looking Forward…Looking Back," organized by the African Center for the Constructive Resolution of Disputes, and the "Stockholm International Conference 10 years with 1325 – What now?" called for the use of CEDAW to improve 1325 implementation.

'''Intersection between SCR 1325 and CEDAW
'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gnwp.org/written-statement-submitted-to-cedaw-on-the-occasion-of-the-general-discussion-on-women-in-conflict-and-post-conflict-situations |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723130833/http://www.gnwp.org/written-statement-submitted-to-cedaw-on-the-occasion-of-the-general-discussion-on-women-in-conflict-and-post-conflict-situations |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 July 2011 |title=Written Statement submitted to CEDAW on the occasion of the General Discussion on Women in Conflict and Post-conflict Situations |author=GNWP-ICAN |date=18 July 2011 |website=gnwp.org |publisher=Global Network of Women Peacebuilders (GNWP) – International Civil society Action Network (ICAN) |accessdate=25 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While CEDAW and UN Security Council Resolutions 1325 and 1820 on Women, Peace and Security are important international instruments on their own, there is also an intersection among the three standards that can be used to enhance their implementation and impact.

Resolutions 1325 and 1820 broaden the scope of CEDAW application by clarifying its relevance to all parties in conflict, whereas CEDAW provides concrete strategic guidance for actions to be taken on the broad commitments outlined in the two Resolutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=UNIFEM |title=CEDAW and Security Council Resolution 1325: A Quick Guide |url=http://www.unrol.org/files/CEDAWandUNSCR1325_eng.pdf |journal=Women, Peace &amp; Security |location= |publisher= |date=2006 |accessdate=25 August 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826120303/http://www.unrol.org/files/CEDAWandUNSCR1325_eng.pdf |archivedate=26 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CEDAW is a global human rights treaty that should be incorporated into national law as the highest standard for women's rights. It requires the UN Member States that have ratified it (185 to date) to set in place mechanisms to fully realize [[women's rights]].

Resolution 1325 is an international law unanimously adopted by the Security Council that mandates the UN Member States to engage women in all aspects of peacebuilding including ensuring women's participation on all levels of decision–making on peace and security issues.

Resolution 1820 links sexual violence as a tactic of war with the maintenance of international peace and security. It also demands a comprehensive report from the UN Secretary-General on implementation and strategies for improving information flow to the Security Council; and the adoption of concrete protection and prevention measures to end sexual violence.

Resolutions 1325 and 1820, and CEDAW share the following agenda on women's human rights and [[gender equality]]:&lt;ref name="gnwp" /&gt;

# Demand women’s participation in [[decision-making]] at all levels
# Rejection of violence against women as it impedes the advancement of women and maintains their subordinate status
# Equality of women and men under the law; protection of women and girls through the [[rule of law]]
# Demand security forces and systems to protect women and girls from [[gender-based violence]]
# Recognition of the fact that distinct experiences and burdens of women and girls come from systemic discrimination
# Ensure that women’s experiences, needs and perspectives are incorporated into the political, legal and social decisions that determine the achievement of just and lasting peace

A General Comment from the CEDAW committee could strengthen women’s advocacy for the full implementation of Resolutions 1325 and 1820 at the country and community levels. Conversely, CEDAW’s relevance to conflict-affected areas will be underscored further by the two Resolutions.  In other words, all three international instruments will reinforce each other and be much more effective if used together in leveraging women’s human rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gnwp.org/what-we-do/local-legislative-advocacy/cedaw-with-unscr-1325-and-1820 CEDAW with UNSCR 1325 and 1820 « Global Network of Women Peacebuilders&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130414214651/http://www.gnwp.org/what-we-do/local-legislative-advocacy/cedaw-with-unscr-1325-and-1820 |date=14 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members and ratification==
{{Main|List of parties to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women}}
The six UN member states that have not ratified or acceded to the convention are [[Iran]], [[Palau]], [[Somalia]], [[Sudan]], [[Tonga]], and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-8&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en |title='Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women' |publisher=Treaties.un.org |date= |accessdate=2011-09-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120823144158/http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-8&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en |archivedate=23 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The one [[United Nations General Assembly observers#Non-member states|UN non-member state]] that had not acceded to the convention is the [[Holy See]]/[[Vatican City]].&lt;ref name="Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Note:'' See New Zealand No 47 Declarations and Reservations New Zealand has signed this treaty on behalf of Niue.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan) in 2007 has also ratified the treaty in its legislature, but is unrecognized by the United Nations and is a party to the treaty only unofficially.&lt;ref&gt;Government Information Office, Republic of China (Taiwan). "Taiwan Aims to Sign Up Against Discrimination." 8 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The latest state to have acceded the convention was [[South Sudan]] on 30 April 2015.&lt;ref name="Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women" /&gt;

Within the United States, over 40 cities and local governments have adopted CEDAW ordinances or resolutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://citiesforcedaw.org/background/|title=Background, Cities for CEDAW|work=Cities for CEDAW|access-date=2018-11-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Reservations ==
Many [[Reservation (law)|reservations]] have been entered against certain articles of the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Reservations to CEDAW: An Analysis for UNICEF |url=http://www.unicef.org/gender/files/Reservations_to_CEDAW-an_Analysis_for_UNICEF.pdf |website=www.unicef.org |accessdate=2015-05-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151004104944/http://www.unicef.org/gender/files/Reservations_to_CEDAW-an_Analysis_for_UNICEF.pdf |archivedate=4 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also some reservations that are not specific to an article within the Convention but rather a general reservation to all aspects of the Convention that would violate a stated principle. For example, [[Mauritania]] made a reservation stating it approved the Convention "in each and every one of its parts which are not contrary to [[Sharia|Islamic Sharia]]."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; A number these reservations, especially those entered by Islamic states parties, are subject to much debate.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Human Rights |last=Henkin |first=Louis |publisher=Foundation Press |year=2009 |isbn= |location= |pages=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 28 of the Convention states that "a [[Reservation (law)|reservation]] incompatible with the object and purpose of the present Convention shall not be permitted."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As a result, many states parties have entered objections to the reservations of other states parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Human rights |last=Henkin |first=Louis |publisher=Foundation Press |year=2009 |isbn= |location= |pages=822}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, many Nordic states parties were concerned that some of the reservations were "undermining the integrity of the text."&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal |url= |title=The Vienna Convention Reservations Regime and the Convention on the Discrimination Against Women |last=Clark |first=Belinda |date=1991 |journal=The American Journal of International Law |doi= |pmid= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, some states parties have withdrawn their reservations.

As of May 2015, sixty-two states parties have entered reservations against some part of the Convention.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-8&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en |title=Declarations and Reservations |date=2015 |accessdate= |website=United Nations Treaty Collection |publisher= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906035454/https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-8&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en |archivedate=6 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-four states parties have entered objections to at least one of these reservations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The most reserved article is Article 29, concerning dispute resolution and interpretation of the Convention, with thirty-nine reservations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Because reservations to Article 29 are expressly allowed by the Convention itself, these reservations were not very controversial.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Article 16, concerning the equality of women in marriage and family life is subject to twenty-three reservations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The Committee, in General Recommendation No. 28, specifically stated that reservations to Article 2, concerning general non-discrimination, are impermissible.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; However, Article 2 has seventeen reservations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women==
The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women is the United Nations (U.N.) treaty body that oversees the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). The formation of this committee was outlined in [https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm#article17 Article 17] of the CEDAW, which also established the rules, purpose, and operating procedures of the committee.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet"&gt;{{cite web |last=U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights |title=Fact Sheet No. 22, Discrimination Against Women: The Convention and the Committee |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/47947740d.html |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout its years of operation the committee has held multiple sessions to ensure the rules outlined in the CEDAW are being followed. Over time the practices of the committee have evolved due to an increased focus on [[women's rights]] issues.

===History of the committee===
The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women was formed on 3 September 1981 after the CEDAW received the 20 [[ratification]]s required for it to enter into force. Article 17 of the CEDAW established the committee in order to ensure that the provisions of the CEDAW were followed by the countries that had signed and agreed to be bound by it.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt; The first regular session of the committee was held from 18–22 October 1982. In this session the first officers of the committee were elected by simple majority, with Ms. L. Ider of [[Mongolia]] becoming chairperson.&lt;ref name="The Work Of CEDAW"&gt;{{cite book |last=United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women |title=The Work of CEDAW: Reports of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against  Women |year=1989 |publisher=United Nations |location=New York |isbn=9211301327 |pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other officers elected were three vice-chairpersons: M.&amp;nbsp;Caron of Canada, Z.&amp;nbsp;Ilic of [[Yugoslavia]] and L.&amp;nbsp;Mukayiranga of [[Rwanda]]. The final officer elected was D.&amp;nbsp;P. Bernard of [[Guyana]] as [[rapporteur]] of the committee. During this session, the committee also unanimously approved to adopt its [[rules of procedure]].&lt;ref name="The Work Of CEDAW" /&gt;

The committee is allowed to hold as many meetings as are required to perform their duties effectively, with the [[State (polity)|states]] party to the CEDAW and the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] authorizing the number of regular sessions held.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; In addition, special sessions can be held at the request of either a state party to the convention or the majority of the members serving on the committee.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; Fifty-three sessions have been held to date, with the most recent taking place from 1 October 2012 to 19 October 2012.&lt;ref name=Sessions&gt;{{cite web |last=U.N.

===Reports===
Under [https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm#article18 article 18] of the CEDAW states must report to the committee on the progress they have made in implementing the CEDAW within their state.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; As most of the information the committee works with comes from these reports, guidelines have been developed to help states prepare accurate and useful reports.&lt;ref name=Methods&gt;{{cite web |last=United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women |title=Overview of the current working methods of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women |url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/wk-methods/Overview-English.pdf |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=18 October 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022084310/http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/wk-methods/Overview-English.pdf |archivedate=22 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial reports discussing the current picture of discrimination against women in the reporting states are required to specifically deal with each article of the CEDAW, and consist of no more than one-hundred pages.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; States are required to prepare and present these initial reports within one year of ratifying the CEDAW.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt; Periodic reports detailing the state's progress in adhering to the articles of the CEDAW should be no more than seventy-five pages in length and should focus on the specific period of time since the state's last report.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; States party to the CEDAW are typically required to provide periodic reports every four years, but if the committee is concerned about the situation in that state they can request a report at any time.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt;

The committee chooses which reports addressing by considering factors such as the amount of time the report has been pending, whether the report is initial or periodic (with more priority given to initial reports), and from which region the report originates.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; Eight states are invited to give their reports during each session and it is required a representative from the state is in attendance when the report is presented.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; The committee focuses on constructive dialogue when a report is presented and appreciates careful time management on the part of the state presenting its report.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; Due to the high backlog of overdue reports the committee has encouraged states to combine all of their outstanding reports into one document and sends reminders to states who have reports that are five years overdue.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; The CEDAW also requires that the committee provide an annual report that includes its activities, comments relating to the reports provided by states, information relating to the Optional Protocol of the CEDAW, and any other general suggestions or recommendations the committee has made.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; This report is given to the [[United Nations General Assembly]] through the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]].&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; All reports, agendas and other official documents pertaining to the committee, including the reports provided by the states, are provided to the public unless otherwise decided by the committee.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt;

===General Recommendations===

Along with issuing its annual report and offering advice to reporting states, the committee has the ability to issue general recommendations that elaborate on its views of the obligations imposed by CEDAW.&lt;ref name=Methods /&gt; To date, the committee has issued thirty-two general recommendations, the latest dealing with the gender related dimensions of refugee status, asylum, nationality and statelessness of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women |title=General recommendation No. 32 on the gender-related dimensions of refugee status, asylum, nationality and statelessness of women |url=https://undocs.org/CEDAW/C/GC/32 |website=undocs.org |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=21 March 2017 |date=14 November 2014 |id=CEDAW/C/GC/32 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322014914/http://undocs.org/CEDAW/C/GC/32 |archivedate=22 March 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The recommendations issued by the committee in its first decade were short and dealt mainly with the content of states’ reports and reservations to the convention.&lt;ref name=Methods /&gt; Since 1991, however, recommendations have been focused on guiding states’ application of the CEDAW in specific situations.&lt;ref name=Methods /&gt; The formulation of a general recommendation begins with dialogue between the committee on the topic in the recommendation with various non-governmental organizations and other U.N. bodies.&lt;ref name=Methods /&gt; The recommendation is then drafted by a member of the committee and discussed and revised in the next session, and finally adopted in the following session.&lt;ref name=Methods /&gt;

Currently the Committee is working on the '''General Recommendation''' Trafficking in women and girls in the context of global migration.

===Changes in the committee===

For the first ten years the committee operated significantly differently from now. The only form of [[censure]] given to the committee by the CEDAW was their general recommendations and concluding comments following a report.&lt;ref name=Reilly&gt;{{cite book |last=Reilly |first=Niamh |title=Women's human rights : seeking gender justice in a globalizing age |year=2009 |publisher=[[Polity Press]] |location=Cambridge |isbn=9780745637006 |pages=62 |edition=Reprinted.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the emergence of the Global Campaign for Women's Human Rights in 1991 more attention was given to the CEDAW, reviving the committee.&lt;ref name=Reilly /&gt; The committee made changes to the CEDAW that allowed it to meet more than once a year, and have taken advantage of this by meeting at least twice a year since 1997.&lt;ref name=Reilly /&gt; The committee originally only met for two weeks in its annual sessions, but that has now been changed to meeting multiple times a year in eighteen-day sessions.&lt;ref name=Report /&gt; CEDAW also gained new complaint and inquiry proceedings allowing the committee to initiate inquiry proceedings if it believes a state is in severe violation of the articles of the CEDAW.&lt;ref name=Reilly /&gt;

===Recommendations for improvement===
Despite evolving since the committee was first formed, members believe there are ways in which the committee can better meet the goals outlined in the CEDAW.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt; One of the committee's main goals moving forward is expanding its information base, allowing it to more effectively deal with issues that arise concerning the CEDAW.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt; The committee is authorized in [https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm#article22 Article 22] of the CEDAW to invite specialized U.N. agencies such as the [[United Nations Development Programme]] to deliver reports discussing women's rights issues in the state under discussion.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt; Another method for gathering information is requesting reports from non-governmental organizations dealing with discrimination against women that are operating in the country under discussion.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt; This is recommended to insure that the committee is receiving the full, unbiased picture of affairs within the reporting state.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt;

Another recommendation for improvement involves interpreting and clarifying the language used in the CEDAW in order to make the document as useful as it can be.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt; A third improvement that has been suggested is improving the efficiency of the committee.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt; Due to the backlog in reports faced by the committee it has been suggested that the government officials who prepare reports presented to the committee should be trained, in order to make all reports uniform and more easily processed.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt; A final suggestion for improvement is the implementation of a right of petition in the CEDAW, allowing the committee to hear complaints from citizens of a state against the state, increasing the committee's strength and direct impact on the problem of discrimination against women.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt;

===Languages===
The official languages of the committee are [[English language|English]], [[Arabic]], [[French language|French]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]], with any statement made in one of the official languages translated into the other four.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; A speaker who does not speak one of the official languages provides a translator.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; All formal decisions and documents issued by the committee are provided in each of the official languages.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; The original rules of procedure adopted by the committee did not include Arabic as an official language, but the rule was amended in the committees second session to include Arabic.&lt;ref name="The Work Of CEDAW" /&gt;

===Members and Officers of the Committee===
Twenty-three members serve on the committee, described as experts for their experience and expertise in women's issues.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book |last=Merry |first=Sally Engle |title=Human rights and gender violence : translating international law into local justice |year=2006 |publisher=[[Univ. of Chicago Press]] |location=Chicago [u.a.] |isbn=0226520730 |pages=82 |edition=[Nachdr.].}}&lt;/ref&gt; The members are nominated by their national governments and elected through a secret ballot by states party to the convention.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Upon winning the election and taking up their responsibilities the members of the committee recite the following statement, known as the solemn declaration, "I solemnly declare that I shall perform my duties and exercise powers as a member of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women honourably, faithfully, impartially and conscientiously".&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; The members come from a wide range of occupations including doctors, lawyers, diplomats and educators, providing various viewpoints to the committee due to their diversity.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Many members continue to hold full-time jobs outside the committee and receive little monetary payment for their work on the committee.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Optional Protocol==
The [[Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] is a side-agreement to the Convention which allows its parties to recognise the competence of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women to consider complaints from individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/cedawopprot-2000.html Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509170959/http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/cedawopprot-2000.html |date=9 May 2008 }}, Article 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Optional Protocol was adopted by the UN General Assembly on 6 October 1999 and entered into force on 22 December 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/protocol/wom1242.htm |title=Optional Protocol to Women's Convention Comes into Force |date=21 December 2000 |accessdate=2008-07-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907212930/http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/protocol/wom1242.htm |archivedate=7 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently it has 80 signatories and 109 parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-8-b&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en |title=Parties to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women |publisher=UN OHCHR |accessdate=2009-10-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520040105/http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-8-b&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en |archivedate=20 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Controversy around CEDAW comes from two opposite directions: social and religious [[conservative]]s which claim that CEDAW is seeking to impose a [[Liberalism|liberal]], [[Progressivism|progressive]], [[Feminism|feminist]] standard on countries, in detriment of [[traditional values]]; and [[radical feminists]], who are skeptical of the power, or even desire, of CEDAW to radically transform societies and truly liberate women, and claim that CEDAW adheres to a form of weak [[liberal feminism]] similar to other mainstream organizations.&lt;ref&gt;https://academic.oup.com/icon/article/10/2/512/666068/Gender-and-democratic-citizenship-the-impact-of&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digitalcommons.law.umaryland.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1006&amp;context=iclc_papers |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-08-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180511154106/http://digitalcommons.law.umaryland.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1006&amp;context=iclc_papers |archivedate=11 May 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://femequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/How-Does-the-CEDAW-Address-the-Problem-of-Culture-and-Tradition.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-08-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810015119/http://femequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/How-Does-the-CEDAW-Address-the-Problem-of-Culture-and-Tradition.pdf |archivedate=10 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cultural Competency Training''' is an instruction to achieve cultural competence and the ability to appreciate and interpret accurately other [[culture]]s.

==Cultural competence==
[[Cultural competence]] refers to an ability to interact effectively with people of different cultures. Cultural competence comprises four components: (a) awareness of one's own cultural worldview, (b) attitude towards cultural differences, (c) knowledge of different cultural practices and worldviews, and (d) cross-cultural skills. Developing cultural competence results in an ability to understand, communicate with, and effectively interact with people across cultures and leads to a 15% decrease in miscommunication.&lt;ref name=Forest&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.culturalcandor.com/| title=Cultural Candor Inc. Cultural Competency Training| accessdate=12 November 2015| publisher=Cultural Candor Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural Competency has a fundamental importance in every aspect of a work field and that includes school and government setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasponline.org/research-and-policy/advocacy-tools-and-resources/communications-strategies-and-resources/school-climate%E2%80%94connectthedots/the-importance-of-cultural-competence|title=The Importance of Cultural Competence|website=www.nasponline.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the amalgamation of different cultures in American society, it has become imperative for teachers and government employees to have some form of cultural competency training.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nea.org/home/39783.htm|title=Why Cultural Competence?|work=NEA|access-date=2017-05-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
To cater to an increasingly globalized society, many hospitals, organizations, and employers may choose to implement forms of cultural competency training methods to enhance transparency between language, values, beliefs, and cultural differences.  Training in cultural competence often includes careful consideration of how best to approach people's various forms of diversity.  This new found awareness oftentimes allows military members, educators, medical practitioners, workers, and common citizens to establish equity in their environments and enhances interrelationships between one another for increased productivity levels.  There have been numerous developed theories as to how best to conduct cultural competency training, which oftentimes is dependent on the specific environment and type of work.

== Cultural Competence Training &amp; Identity ==

When defining the ideas that surround cultural competence training, defining what culture is can help to understand the ideas that shape the concept. [[Culture]] is defined as the set of shared attitudes, values, goals, and practices that characterizes an institution or organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of CULTURE|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/culture|website=www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate=1 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; When looking at culture in terms of cultural competence training, certain groups of individuals should be focused on because of their relevance to society. There are many groups that are marginalized and underrepresented; however, four specific areas to look at are:

=== LGBTQIAP ===
[[LGBT|LGBTQIAP]] community, race, and religion. These areas, along with others, represent concepts that make up one’s identity. The approach to identity helps to shape the ideas and themes that go into cultural competence training.
The acronym LGBTQIAP stands for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transsexual, Transgender, Queer, Questioning, Intersex, Asexual, Ally, and Pansexual. This particular group of individuals has faced numerous obstacles and has historical events to highlight the inequalities they face such as the Stonewall riots. The [[Stonewall riots]] became a symbol for the gay liberation movement when police attempted a raid at the Stonewall Inn bar to arrest the gay and lesbian patrons and the gay community fought back. Numerous systemic oppressions historically and currently target LGBT individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leyva|first1=Valerie L.|last2=Breshears|first2=Elizabeth M.|last3=Ringstad|first3=Robin|title=Assessing the Efficacy of LGBT Cultural Competency Training for Aging Services Providers in California’s Central Valley|journal=Journal of Gerontological Social Work|volume=57|issue=2-4|pages=335–348|doi=10.1080/01634372.2013.872215}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural competence training helps professionals develop knowledge and skills on how to address issues and be more aware on the type of language that is politically correct.

=== Race ===
Race is a sensitive aspect of cultural competency training that requires professionals to be able to identify, acknowledge and value cultural differences. Training on this aspect of cultural competence teaches professionals that to ignore racial differences, is a form of microaggression that can help exacerbate racial inequalities.  In order to begin to understand intercultural communications one must understand the historical and social context under which different cultural groups operate.  For example, the history related to the cultural genocide of indigenous peoples in North America, understanding the said group’s value system, their ways of learning, and logic is essential in being able to understand how certain aspects of their culture may be similar or different from our own. Such distinction must be approached with respect and without ascribing superiority or inferiority to the difference.

=== Religion ===
Religious differences can play a role in how professionals interact and communicate with others. [[Religiosity]] refers to the nature and extent of public and private religious activity, including belief in God, prayer, and place of worship attendance. Religiosity is usually linked to formal religious traditions (such as [[Christianity]]), institutions (such as mosques), sacred texts (such as [[Book of Mormon|The Book of Mormon]]), and a definitive moral code (such as the Decalogue). Spirituality can be an important part of religion but can also exist independent of extant faith traditions, involving a variety of more individual subjective beliefs and activities related to the sacred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whitley|first1=Rob|last2=Jarvis|first2=Eric G.|title=Religious Understanding as Cultural Competence: Issues for Clinicians|journal=Psychiatric Times|date=June 2015|pages=1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this aspect of cultural competence training professionals should learn how to have religious competence. Religious competence refers to skills, practices, and orientations that recognize, explore, and harness patient religiosity to facilitate diagnosis, recovery, and healing. Religious competence involves the learning and deployment of generic competencies, including active listening and a nonjudgmental stance. It is also an overarching orientation, providing a safe place for discussion of religious issues and identities received in a humble, respectful, and empathetic manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whitley|first1=Rob|last2=Jarvis|first2=Eric G.|title=Religious Understanding as Cultural Competence: Issues for Clinicians|journal=Psychiatric Times|date=June 2015|pages=1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nationality ===
in terms of nationality, particularly for people who are immigrants, the recent increase in global migration make them an increasingly common demographic everywhere. Though they will have varying cultures as well. In this aspect, it is important for those who are trained to understand both similarities and differences between them, and the individual they are helping. With this knowledge, it makes the process of aiding the individual more efficient, and successful. &lt;ref&gt;Schouler-Ocak, Graef-Calliess, Tarricone, Qureshi, Kastrup, &amp; Bhugra. (2015). EPA guidance on cultural competence training. ''European Psychiatry,'' ''30''(3), 431-440.&lt;/ref&gt; Both the past Nation the individual has come from, and their journey of immigration as an experience, can shape their mentality. To have specialists with specific nationalities help explain some differences is a helpful strategy. &lt;ref&gt;Bhugra, D. (2017). Cultural competence training and mental health care in refugees and asylum seekers. ''European Psychiatry,'' ''41''(SS), S35.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural Competence Training in School ==
School is considered to be the second learning home for kids. Every year a large number of people come to the United States. These groups of people are often families, including small children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics|title=Immigration Data &amp; Statistics {{!}} Homeland Security|website=www.dhs.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In today’s world, cultural competency plays a very vital role in shaping the kids future. In the United States, there is an underlying difference among parents as to how a kid should be raised, but it is clear that cultural competency should be taught at a young age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://fee.org/articles/cultural-competence-and-your-child/|title=Cultural Competence and Your Child {{!}} Wendy McElroy|last=McElroy|first=Wendy|date=2007-09-01|access-date=2017-05-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States is not the front runner in cultural competency training amongst children, as Canada and Australia are seemingly far more progressive in this sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wehearyou.acecqa.gov.au/2014/07/10/what-does-it-mean-to-be-culturally-competent/|title=What does it mean to be culturally competent?|last=ACECQA|first=Author|date=2014-07-10|website=We Hear You|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural competency training can be a huge help for the families who are thinking of adopting a foster child, specifically, if that child was born outside of United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.socialworkers.org/pressroom/features/issue/diversity.asp|title=Diversity &amp; Cultural Competence|website=www.socialworkers.org|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; A school is a mixture of different races and cultures and as an educator, one must be sensitive to everyone’s needs. Different cultures act uniquely to the different situations, and as an educator, one has to not only value diversity, but also have a strategy for everyone to feel welcomed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nea.org/tools/30402.htm|title=Diversity Toolkit: Cultural Competence for Educators|work=NEA|access-date=2017-05-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural Competence Training in the Workforce ==
Over the years, there have been new developed ways of practicing cultural competency in the workforce. There are many different methods that would allow assistance in cultural competency such as: Global leadership programs, international team building exercises and specific cross-cultural skills training for special executive positions. Having a good grasp on the many different cultures that exist is increasingly becoming a major principle in the workforce. The techniques for cultural competency training must be practiced more than just in class room lecture. Trainers must be extremely educated in this matter to be able to sufficiently train people.  They must take notice of their own biases perspective and about the different types cultures that receive discrimination.

== Cultural Competence Training for Medical Students and Physicians ==
{{see also|Cultural competence in health care}}
In the medical setting, effective communication between clinicians, patients, families and other health care providers is fundamental.

[[Health disparities]] refer to gaps in the quality of health and health care across racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups. Studies have demonstrated the multiple factors that contribute to health disparities.

Cultural Competence Online for Medical Practice (CCOMP) is an attempt in the United States to address one of the factors - the patient-doctor interaction.  The CCOMP project is funded by a grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) through the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI).  CCOMP offers a clinician's guide to reduce cardiovascular disparities, intended to create effective cross-cultural approaches to care for African-American patients with [[cardiovascular disease]], especially [[hypertension]]. Videos with real patient scenarios and case-based modules are aimed at developing this increased awareness.

The '''EUR-ACE (European Accredited Engineer)''' Label is a certificate awarded to courses of study in Engineering that are accredited by authorized quality assurance and accreditation agencies in the [[European Higher Education Area]]. 

The [[European Network for Accreditation of Engineering Education]] (ENAEE) grants this authorization to agencies that accredit degree programs in Engineering in accordance with the European Framework Standards and ENAEE's Standards for Accreditation Agencies.

The EUR-ACE label may be awarded to First Cycle (Bachelor) and Second Cycle (Master) accredited degrees in [[Engineering]].

==History==

The European Standing Observatory for the Engineering Profession and Education (ESOEPE) was established in September 2000. Its aim was to improve systems of accreditation of engineering degree programs in Europe.

In 2004 ESOEPE submitted a proposal to the European Commission. This proposal envisaged the establishment of a quality label (the EUR-ACE Label) which could be awarded to engineering degree programs which had reached certain educational standards, as defined by their learning outcomes.

The proposal was accepted by the EU Commission and funding provided for the project.
ESOEPE was dissolved; ENAEE was established and implemented the EUR-ACE Project.

The EUR-ACE Project concluded on 31/03/2006 with the presentation of the results in a public workshop in which the EUR-ACE label was listed among the six EC-sponsored “European quality labels in higher education”.
.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ecaconsortium.net/event/paris/doc/WG4-ECA position paper&lt;/ref&gt;

The approach to using learning outcomes in the ENAEE European Framework Standards has been corroborated in a number of publications and projects since the establishment of ENAEE.

As of 19 November 2014, authorized agencies sign a Mutual Recognition Agreement whereby they  accept each other's accreditation decisions in respect of Bachelor and Master engineering degree programs which they accredit.

==Agencies authorised to award the EUR-ACE label==

As of 21 November 2017 ENAEE had authorised 15 agencies to award the EUR-ACE label, which has been awarded to some 2600 engineering degree programmes in 35 countries both within and outside of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.enaee.trynisis.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''easiness effect''' is the claim that as a result of [[popular science|science popularization]] [[layperson|laypeople]] develop an overconfident scientific understanding. This results in science-related decision-making that reflects a misunderstanding of popular science rather than the judgment of professional scientists.{{R|"Scharrer"}}

== Context ==
Rainer Bromme and Susan Goldman, writing in the ''[[Educational Psychologist (journal)|Educational Psychologist]]'' describe the context, stating "Challenges to understanding science include determining the relevance of information, the tentativeness of scientific truth, distinguishing between scientific and nonscientific issues, and determining what is true and what is false."{{R|"Bromme"}}

Scotty Hendricks, a contributing writer to BigThink.com, notes that popular science writers might have to start considering the effect that their work has on the general public.{{R|"Hendricks2016"}}

== Evidence ==
Scharrer and her co-authors studied the claimed effect by inviting laypeople to read popular science articles and/or articles with more scientific detail, publishing their results in ''[[Public Understanding of Science]]''.&lt;ref name="Scharrer" /&gt; The subjects were then interviewed to judge their scientific opinions and confidence in those opinions, in relation to the material that they had read. Scharrer's team inferred that there was a statistically significant effect of scientific overconfidence and willingness to override expert opinion.{{R|"Scharrer"}}

In some of their experiments, Scharrer's team attempted to counteract the easiness effect by explicitly warning subjects of the complexity and controversiality of the scientific material presented. They found that the easiness effect disappeared partially but not completely.{{R|"Scharrer"}} The researchers suggest that it has to do mostly with writing style. Popular articles condense the science and speak with certainty whereas an academic paper speaks mostly in terms of probability. Hence reading mostly popularizations leads to overconfidence in the results.{{R|"Hendricks2016"}}

== Countermeasures ==
Scharrer and her co-authors recommended "explicitly highlighting topic complexity and controversiality" in order to reduce the easiness effect, and additionally
recommended "a need for further educating the public on the division of cognitive labor and its implications for making judgments" and adding to formal science education the notion that "making reliable judgments often requires deference to scientific experts".{{R|"Scharrer"}}
== Commentary ==
Mark Carnall of [[The Guardian]] said that the expanded access that laypeople have to simplified explanations of scientific facts may be the cause of their rising distrust in experts. The partial understanding they get from the "easy-to-digest science stories" from the media and bad [[science communication]] would give them confidence to reject the actual claims that scientists make.  He expresses the concern that "[[alternative facts]]" exploit this effect to confuse what scientific facts really are and highlights the importance of critical thinking skills to counter this phenomenon.{{R|"Guardian_Carnall"}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5154">{{Occupational hazards}}

'''Engineering controls''' are strategies designed to protect workers from [[Occupational hazard|hazardous conditions]] by placing a barrier between the worker and the hazard or by removing a hazardous substance through air [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/engcontrols/|title=NIOSH Directory of Engineering Controls|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=U.S. [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]]|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roelofs2007"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-4lTEuFWtdIC&amp;pg=PA9|title=Preventing Hazards at the Source|first=Cora|date=1 January 2007|publisher=[[American Industrial Hygiene Association]]|year=|isbn=978-1-931504-83-6|location=|pages=9ff|author=Roelofs}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Engineering controls involve a physical change to the workplace itself, rather than relying on workers' behavior or requiring workers to wear protective clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/dte/grant_materials/fy10/sh-20839-10/hierarchy_of_controls.pdf|title=Hierarchy of Controls|last=|first=|date=|website=U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]]|access-date=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Engineering controls is the third of five members of the [[hierarchy of hazard control]]s, which orders control strategies by their feasibility and effectiveness. Engineering controls are preferred over [[administrative controls]] and [[personal protective equipment]] (PPE) because they are designed to remove the hazard at the source, before it comes in contact with the worker. Well-designed engineering controls can be highly effective in protecting workers and will typically be independent of worker interactions to provide this high level of protection. The initial cost of engineering controls can be higher than the cost of administrative controls or PPE, but over the longer term, operating costs are frequently lower, and in some instances, can provide a cost savings in other areas of the process.&lt;ref name="CDC"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/hierarchy/default.html|title=Hierarchy of Controls - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|last=|first=|date=|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-30}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hazard elimination|Elimination]] and [[Hazard substitution|substitution]] are usually considered to be separate levels of hazard controls, but in some schemes they are categorized as types of engineering control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hsaa.ca/effective-representation/hazard-identification-elimination-and-control|title=Hazard Identification, Elimination and Control|last=|first=|date=|website=Health Sciences Association of Alberta|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170314062833/https://www.hsaa.ca/effective-representation/hazard-identification-elimination-and-control|archive-date=2017-03-14|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-03-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://machinerysafety101.com/2011/02/28/understanding-the-hierarchy-of-controls/|title=Understanding the Hierarchy of Controls|last=Nix|first=Doug|date=2011-02-28|website=Machinery Safety 101|access-date=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2387">'''Environment statistics''' is the application of [[statistics|statistical methods]] to [[environmental science]]. It covers procedures for dealing with questions concerning both the natural environment in its undisturbed state and the interaction of humanity with the environment. Thus weather, climate, air and water quality are included, as are studies of plant and animal populations.

The [http://unstats.un.org/unsd/environment/FDES/FDES-2015-supporting-tools/FDES.pdf United Nations Framework for the Development of Environment Statistics (FDES)] defines the scope of environment statistics as follows:
The scope of environment statistics covers biophysical aspects of the environment and those aspects of the socio-economic system that directly influence and interact with the environment.
The scope of environment, social and economic statistics overlap. It is not easy – or necessary – to draw a clear line dividing these areas. Social and economic statistics that describe processes or activities with a direct impact on, or direct interaction with, the environment are used widely in environment statistics. They are within the scope of the FDES.

Sources of data for environmental statistics are varied and include: surveys related to human populations and the environment, records from agencies managing environmental resources, maps and images, equipment used to examine the environment, and research studies around the world.  A primary component of the data is direct observation, although most environmental statistics use a variety of sources.&lt;ref name="Manly"/&gt;

Environmental statistics covers a number of types of study:&lt;ref name="Manly"/&gt;
*Baseline studies to document the present state of an environment to provide background in case of unknown changes in the future;
*Targeted studies to describe the likely impact of changes being planned or of accidental occurrences; 
*Regular monitoring to attempt to detect changes in the environment.

In [[demography|human demography]] and [[population biology]], '''fecundity''' is the potential for reproduction of an [[organism]] or [[population]], measured by the number of [[gamete]]s (eggs), seed set, or asexual propagules. Fecundity is similar to  [[fertility]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the natural capability to produce offspring. A lack of fertility is [[infertility]] while a lack of fecundity would be called [[Sterility (physiology)|sterility]].

Human demography considers only human fecundity which is often intentionally limited through [[contraception]], while population [[biology]] studies all [[Organism|organisms]]. The term fecundity in population biology is often used to describe the rate of offspring production after one time step (often annual). In this sense, fecundity may include both birth rates and survival of young to that time step. Fecundity is under both [[Genetics|genetic]] and environmental control, and is the major measure of [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]]. ''Fecundation'' is another term for [[fertilization]]. ''Superfecundity'' or ''retrofecundity'' refers to an organism's ability to store another organism's sperm (after [[copulation]]) and fertilize its own eggs from that store after a period of time, essentially making it appear as though fertilization occurred without sperm (i.e. [[parthenogenesis]]).{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Fecundity is important and well studied in the field of [[population ecology]]. Fecundity can increase or decrease in a [[population]] according to current conditions and certain [[regulating factors]]. For instance, in times of hardship for a population, such as a [[starvation|lack of food]], juvenile and eventually adult fecundity has been shown to decrease (i.e. due to a lack of resources the juvenile individuals are unable to reproduce, eventually the adults will run out of resources and reproduction will cease).

Fecundity has also been shown to increase in [[ungulates]] with relation to warmer weather.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

In sexual [[evolutionary biology]], especially in sexual selection, fecundity is contrasted to [[reproductivity]].

In [[obstetrics]] and [[gynecology]], fecundability is the probability of being [[pregnant]] in a single [[menstrual cycle]], and fecundity is the probability of achieving a live birth within a single cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Berek JS and Novak E. Berek &amp; Novak's gynecology. 14th ed. 2007, Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins. Pg. 1186&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Genital jewellery''', also known as '''sex jewellery''' and '''adult jewellery''', is [[jewellery]] which is designed specifically for wear on or to accentuate the [[genital]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=d0NRAyl-2EEC&amp;lpg=PA198&amp;dq=%22genital%20jewellery%22&amp;pg=PA198#v=onepage&amp;q=%22genital%20jewellery%22&amp;f=false Judith Green, Ronald N. Labonté (2007) ''Critical perspectives in public health''], pp198, Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-40952-7}} Retrieved 17 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;   In a wider sense also [[Nipple shield (jewelry)|nipple rings]] and some [[butt-plug]]s may be called genital jewellery.

Genital jewellery includes [[cock ring]]s and [[Labia piercing|vaginal jewellery]] as well as [[anal piercing]]s. These items often blur the line between jewellery and [[sex toys]]. Genital jewellery is available for men and women and some models may be worn by both sexes. While some genital piercings have been around since at least Victorian times (e.g. [[Prince Albert piercing]] jewellery), a recent increase in popularity and social acceptance has resulted in the fusion between function and [[fashion]] that is sex jewellery.

The practice is not new, however, with genital piercings, designed to stimulate as well as to decorate, being described as early as 300 in ''The Kama Sutra''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DuNTznUH8ZkC&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;dq=%22genital%20jewellery%22&amp;pg=PA163#v=onepage&amp;q=%22genital%20jewellery%22&amp;f=false Guy N.

Wearing genital jewellery in nudist resorts may sometimes be considered inappropriate&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcn.ca/gn_sample.htm Federation of Canadian Naturalists] Retrieved 17 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; because it may be seen as overtly sexual (see [[Issues_in_social_nudity#Appropriate_dress|Issues in social nudity]]).

The '''glass tax''' was introduced in Great Britain in 1746, during the reign of King [[George II of England|George II]]. Glass was at that time sold by weight, and manufacturers responded by producing smaller, more highly decorated objects, often with hollow stems, known today as "Excise glasses".{{sfnp|Hurst-Vose|1980|p=|ps=none}} In 1780, the government granted Ireland free trade in glass without taxation, resulting in the establishment of glassworks in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] and [[Waterford]]. In 1825, the tax in Ireland was restored, and gradually the industry declined, until the glass tax was abolished by Sir [[Robert Peel]]'s government in 1845.{{sfnp|Tait|2004|p=|ps=none}}

A contemporary account in the medical journal ''[[The Lancet]]'' described the glass tax as an "absurd impost on light":
{{quote|In a hygienic point of view, the enormous tax on glass, amounting to more than three hundred per cent on its value, is one of the most cruel a Government could inflict on the nation&amp;nbsp;... The deficiency of light in town habitations, in a great measure caused by the enormous cost of glass, is universally admitted to be one of the principal causes of the unhealthiness of cities ...{{r|Lancet}}}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13332">'''Historical editions''' form part of a category of printed music, which generally consists of [[classical music]] and [[opera]] from a past repertory, where the term can apply to several different types of published music.  However, it is principally applied to one of three types of music of this sort:
* '''Scholarly or critical editions''' are music editions in which careful scholarship has been employed to ensure that the music contained within is as close to the composer's original intentions as possible. Such editions are sometimes called [[urtext edition]]s.
* '''Collected Works or Complete Works''', generally in multi-volume sets, are devoted to a particular composer or to a particular musical repertory.  This is sometimes referred to in German as  ''Gesamtausgabe''&lt;ref&gt;Literally: "whole edition"&lt;/ref&gt; when containing the works of one particular composer.
* '''Monuments or Monumental Editions''' (or the German ''Denkmäler'')&lt;ref&gt;Literally: "memorials"&lt;/ref&gt; when containing a repertory defined by geography, time period, or musical genre.

== The origins of historical editions ==
Up until the 18th century, music performance and distribution centered around current compositions.  Even professional musicians rarely were familiar with music written more than a half century before their own time.&lt;ref&gt;Moser, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;  In the second half of the 18th century, an awakening of interest in the history of music prompted the publication of numerous collections of older music (for example, [[William Boyce (composer)|William Boyce]]'s ''Cathedral Music'', published around 1760-63, and [[Giovanni Battista Martini]]'s ''Esemplare, ossia Saggio... di contrappunto'', published around 1774-5).&lt;ref&gt;Sydney Robinson Charles, [http://www.grovemusic.com "Editions, Historical", ''Grove Music Online''] ed. L. Macy. Accessed 17 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  Around the same time, the proliferation of pirated editions of music by popular composers (such as [[Haydn]] and [[Mozart]]) prompted respected music publishers to embark on "oeuvres complettes," intended as uniform editions of the entire musical output of these composers.  Unfortunately, many of these early complete works projects were never finished.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, p. 337&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, the emergence of [[romantic hero]] worship of composers, sometimes described as the "cult of genius," fired the enthusiasm for Complete Works series for important composers.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, p. 377.&lt;/ref&gt;  The development of the academic field of musicology also contributed to an interest in more accurate and well-researched editions of musical works.  Finally, the rise of [[Nationalism]] within music circles influenced the creation of Monumental Editions devoted to geographical regions, such as ''Denkmäler deutscher Tonkunst'' begun in 1892 and ''Denkmäler der Tonkunst in Österreich'' begun in 1894.

== Editing historical editions ==
In creating a scholarly or critical edition, an editor examines all available versions of the given piece (early musical sketches, manuscript versions, publisher’s proof copies, early printed editions, and so on) and attempts to create an edition that is as close to the composer’s original intentions as possible. Editors use their historical knowledge, detective skills, and musical understanding to choose what one hopes is the most accurate version of the piece.  More recent scholarly editions often include footnotes or critical reports describing discrepancies between differing versions, or explaining appropriate performance practice for the time period.  In general, editing music is a much more challenging endeavor than editing text-based works of literature, as [[musical notation]] can be imprecise, musical handwriting can be difficult to decipher, and first or early printed editions of pieces often contained mistakes.&lt;ref&gt;James Grier, "Editing" in [http://www.grovemusic.com ''Grove Music Online''] Accessed 24 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

By comparison, what are known as performers’ editions do not rely on a thorough examination of all known sources, and often purposely include extraneous markings not written by the composer ([[dynamics (music)|dynamics]], articulation marks, bowing indications, fingerings, and so on) to aid a musician playing from that score.

==Scholarly or critical editions==

===Opera===
''For information on critical editions of operatic works, see '''[[critical edition (opera)]]'''''

==Collected Works or Complete Works ==
The German music publisher [[Breitkopf &amp; Härtel]] initiated many of the earliest complete works series of major composers.  A few of these include:
* [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]: [[Bach Gesellschaft|''Werke'']] (1851-1900; supplemental volume [revised edition of ''[[The Art of Fugue]]''] 1926)
* [[George Frideric Handel]]: [[Händel-Gesellschaft|''Werke'']] (1858-1902)
* [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]]: ''Werke'' (1862-1907)
* [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]: [[Beethoven Gesamtausgabe|''Werke'']] (1862–65, supplemental volume 1888)
* [[Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy]]: ''Werke'' (1874-1877)
* [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]: [[Alte Mozart-Ausgabe|''Werke'']] (1877-1883, supplements until 1910)
Many of these early complete works series were edited by music scholars or composers famous in their own right, such as [[Johannes Brahms]], [[Guido Adler]], [[Julius Rietz]], [[Friedrich Chrysander]], and others.

After the upheavals of [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], which slowed the output of musical scholarship and publishing, renewed activity led to many new series as well as to a reassessment of the older complete works series.  New techniques in photographic and other types of reproduction allowed scholars to consult many more early sources, either in microfilm or facsimile copies.  Entirely new series were published for several major composers for whom complete works sets already existed.  These updated editions incorporated new scholarship in their editing and allowed for a broader definition of complete works, often including early versions of pieces, sketches, and so on.&lt;ref name=CHAS&gt;Charles, ''Grove Music Online''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of these new series have been published by the German music publisher Bärenreiter, and include:
* Bach: ''[[Neue Bach-Ausgabe]]'' (1954-)
* Handel: ''Hallische Händel-Ausgabe'' (1955-)
* Mozart: ''[[Neue Mozart-Ausgabe]]'' (1955-)
In addition to the reworking of older Complete Works series, many new series have been initiated for composers not previously featured in this way.  Some examples include:
* [[Leoš Janáček]]: ''Complete Critical Edition'' (1978-)
* [[Edward Elgar]]: ''Elgar Complete Edition'' (1981-)
* [[Alban Berg]]: ''Sämtliche Werke'' (1984-)
* [[Claude Debussy]]: ''Oeuvres complètes'' (1985-)
* [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]]: [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach: The Complete Works|''The Complete Works'']] (2005-)
* [[Johann Christian Bach]]: [[Collected Works of Johann Christian Bach|''Collected Works'']] (1984–99)
It would be impossible to list here all of the new Complete Works series that have been initiated in the last century.  Some of the major publishers of these series include [[Breitkopf &amp; Härtel]], Bärenreiter, Stainer &amp; Bell, [[G. Henle Verlag]], and others.

==Monuments or Monumental Editions==
Many of the early Monumental Editions were devoted to geographic regions, and often had the support of their respective governments.  For example, the series ''[[Denkmäler deutscher Tonkunst]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Literally: Memorials of German Musical Art&lt;/ref&gt; begun in 1892 by a group of German musicians that included [[Johannes Brahms]], [[Joseph Joachim]], and [[Philipp Spitta]], was supported by the German government.&lt;ref name=CHAS/&gt; Examples of other monumental editions (still ongoing) include:
* ''Samfundet til udgivelse af dansk musik'' (1872-)
* ''[[Denkmäler der Tonkunst in Österreich]]'' (1894-)
* ''Monumenta Musicae Belgicae'' (1932-)
* ''[[Music of the United States of America (publications)|Music of the United States of America]]'' (1988-) 
Some recent projects include not only those focusing on geographic regions, but also many devoted to particular time periods or repertory, such as:
* ''Monumenta Musicae Byzantinae'' (1935-)
* ''Polyphonic Music of the Fourteenth Century'' (1956–58)
* ''Recent Researches in Music'' (1962-)
* ''Italian Opera, 1640-1770'' (1977-)
It would be impossible to list all of the Monumental Editions currently ongoing.  Several of the major publishers of these series include the [http://www.corpusmusicae.com American Institute of Musicology], [http://www.areditions.com A-R Editions], Bärenreiter, Istituto Italiano per la Storia della Musica, Instituto Español de musicologia, [[Éditions de l'Oiseau-Lyre]], and others.

===Characteristics of complete works and monumental editions===
Publication of these multi-volume series is usually spread over many years, sometimes decades.  Depending on the financial state of the publisher, some projected sets are never finished, and some sets are taken over by other publishers.  There are often different editors for individual volumes, with a general editor or committee of editors to oversee the entire series.  Complete Works series are often organized by genre, for example grouping all symphonies together, or all piano sonatas.  Several of the complete works sets have complicated, multi-tiered systems for numbering the volumes.  Monumental Editions have varying organizational schemes, but several of them include numerous sub-series, some of which are devoted to the music of single composers.

These publications are often sponsored by musicological research bodies or by civic organizations.  Many of these endeavors also value international cooperation, creating editorial boards that include scholars from various countries.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, p. 380.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Finding pieces within historical edition sets ==
Finding a particular piece of music within one of these multi-volume sets can often be difficult, as many of the series do not have general indices.  For pieces within a composer's complete works set, researchers often consult the ''[[New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'' (Second Edition, 2001), either online or in its printed version.  Articles on composers will list the title and publisher of any complete works sets that exist, and within the list of compositions by that composer, will include volume numbers of the complete works set in which each piece is found.

To find pieces within older Monumental Editions, the best resource is still the 3rd edition of [[Anna Harriet Heyer]]'s ''Historical Sets, Collected Editions, and Monuments of Music: A Guide to their Content'', published in 1980.  A more up to date description of newer complete works and monumental edition sets can be found in the work of George Hill and Norris Stephens, but there is no index to find individual pieces.  An online database, called the "Index to Printed Music: Collections &amp; Series," is currently underway, but it is accessible by subscription only, and is not yet complete.

[[File:Gallee.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Old Saxon Baptismal Vow]]: "''Forsachistu diobolae..''" (Forsake devils) and "''gelobistu in got alamehtigan fadaer''" (believe in god almighty father). Left caption in a later writing: "''Abrinuciatio diaboli lingua Teotisca veter''." = (abjuration of the devil in Old German). Under the Baptismal Vow in Latin an enumeration of the first 20 practices in the Indiculus superstitionum et paganiarum.]]

The '''''Indiculus superstitionum et paganiarum''''' (''Small index of superstitions and paganism'') is a [[Latin]] collection of [[Capitulary|capitularies]] identifying and condemning superstitious and pagan beliefs found in the north of [[Gaul]]&lt;ref name=dierkens24&gt;Dierkens 24.&lt;/ref&gt; and among the [[Saxon]]s during the time of their subjugation and conversion by [[Charlemagne]].

From the original manuscript only the cover remains, which lists thirty chapters. The manuscript is held in the [[Vatican Library]] in a collection (''Codex Palatinus Latinus'' 577) which probably originates from [[Fulda]] and thence traveled to [[Mainz]], arriving there in 1479. From Mainz it went to the [[Bibliotheca Palatina]] in [[Heidelberg]], and arrived in Rome at the latest in 1623. Preceding the ''Indiculus'' is the so-called [[Old Saxon Baptismal Vow]]. The text is edited in the ''Karlomanni Principis Capitulare'', published by the [[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]].

==Date==
''Codex Palatinus Latinus'' 577 itself appears to have been copied ca. 800 in either Fulda or [[Mainz]]. Alain Dierkens argues, on the basis of word choice (the correspondence between the phrase ''superstitionem et paganiarum'' and the diction used by Boniface in his 742&lt;ref&gt;Tangl, letter 50, 80ff.&lt;/ref&gt; letter to [[Pope Zachary]]) and a comparison between the content of the ''Indiculus'' and the conclusions of the [[Concilium Germanicum]] (744), that the ''Indiculus'' was indeed appended to or pertained to the decisions made at the Concilium Germanicum and the two consequent Frankish synods at Estinnes and Soissons.&lt;ref&gt;Dierkens 23.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, they were not the product of a late-seventh century scribe at Fulda, nor were the prohibitions aimed specifically or exclusively at the Saxons.&lt;ref name=dierkens24/&gt;

==Significance==
The index provides valuable insight into the religious culture of the pagan Saxons (from the Christian point of view) and into the daily practices of Christian missionaries working in that area. Since it is more or less contemporary with the activities of [[Saint Boniface]] in modern-day Germany, he has been called a "guiding influence" on its compilation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qh1lrIM5nd4C&amp;pg=PA173 Filotas 173.]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Alain Dierkens, the ''Indiculus'', which he thinks derives from the "entourage" of Boniface, evidences the ongoing practice of pre-Christian practices, including divination, the use of amulets, magic, and witchcraft, and suggests that the church allowed or transformed certain practices which it had been unable to extirpate.&lt;ref&gt;Dierkens 25-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institute of Linguistics of the Russian Academy of Sciences''' ({{lang-ru|Институт языкознания Российской академии наук}}) is a structural unit in the Language and Literature Section of History and Philology Department of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]. This Institute is one of the major centers in the field of [[Linguistics|linguistic research]] in [[Russia]].

Researchers of the Institute of Linguistics are involved in the study of fundamental linguistic problems as well as in applied linguistic studies of the languages of Russia, the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] and foreign countries too. These include Romance, Germanic, Celtic, Iranian, Turkic, Mongolian, Finno-Ugriс languages and languages of the Caucasus region, Tropical Africa and South-Eastern Asia.

Great attention is paid to the problems of [[linguistic typology]] and [[historical linguistics|comparative and historical linguistics]]. Much attention is given to the research of [[psycholinguistic]] and [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] problems ([[language situation]], [[language policy]], [[language conflicts]]) in different regions of the world.&lt;ref&gt;A Scholars' guide to humanities and social sciences in the Soviet successor states: the Academies of Sciences of Russia, Armenia, Azerbaidzhan, Belarus, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kirghizstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Tadzhikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan / Institute of Scientific Information in the Social Sciences (INION), Russian Academy of Sciences and Kennan Institute for Advanced Russian Studies, Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.

== History ==

The Institute of Linguistics of the USSR Academy of Sciences was created in 1950 in [[Moscow]] after the so-called “discussion of linguistic issues” during the campaign against the [[Marrism]] (Japhetic theory). The Institute was organized on the basis of the [[Russian Language Institute|Institute of the Russian Language of the Academy of Sciences]], established in 1944, as a "counterweight" to the Marr Institute of Language and Mind in [[Leningrad]], the leading center of theoretical language studies in the USSR of that period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://feb-web.ru/feb/izvest/1950/01/501-080.htm Постановление Президиума АН СССР от 1 июля 1950 г.] Известия Академии наук СССР. Отделение литературы и языка. — М., 1950. — Т. IX. Вып. 1. — С. 80—81.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter in 1952 was reorganized as the Leningrad branch of the Moscow Institute of Linguistics (this situation continued until 1991, when the Leningrad branch was transformed into an independent [[Institute of Linguistic Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences]]).

The first Director of the Moscow Institute of Linguistics was [[Viktor Vinogradov]], in 1954 this position was taken by his deputy, Аcademician [[Viktor Borkovskiy]]; Viktor Vinogradov became the Director of a renewed Institute of the Russian Language in 1958. Later Institute of Linguistics was headed by acad. [[Boris Serebrennikov]] (1960—1964), corr.-member [[Fedot Filin]] (1964— 1968),  corr.-member [[Viktoria Yartseva]] (1968—1977), acad. [[Georgiy Stepanov]] (1977—1986),  corr.-member of Vadim Solntsev (1986—2000), corr.-member [[Vinogradov, Viktor Alekseevich|Viktor Vinogradov]] (2000—2012).

On June 19, 2012 [[Vladimir Alpatov]] became the Director of the Institute of Linguistics, as elected by general meeting of all the researchers of the Institute.

'''ICPSR''', the '''Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research''', was established in 1962. An integral part of the infrastructure of [[social science]] research, ICPSR maintains and provides access to a vast archive of social science data for research and instruction (over 8,000 discrete studies/surveys with more than 65,000 datasets). Since 1963, ICPSR has offered training in [[quantitative research|quantitative methods]] to facilitate effective data use. The [http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/sumprog ICPSR Summer Program in Quantitative Methods of Social Research] offers a comprehensive curriculum in research design, statistics, data analysis, and methodology. To ensure that data resources are available to future generations of scholars, ICPSR curates and preserves data, migrating them to new storage media and file formats as changes in technology warrant. In addition, ICPSR provides user support to assist researchers in identifying relevant data for analysis and in conducting their research projects.

ICPSR supports students, instructors, researchers, and policy makers who:
* Conduct secondary research to support primary research findings or generate new findings
* Preserve and disseminate primary research data
* Study or teach statistical methods in quantitative analysis
* Write articles, papers, or theses to fulfill undergraduate or graduate requirements
* Develop funding proposals for grants or contracts that require a data management plan

ICPSR provides a number of tools as classroom aids for college-level instructors:
* Bibliography of Data-related Literature — citations to data from published works; a good starting point for literature reviews and research papers
* Social Science Variables Database — lets students learn by comparing variables across datasets
* Survey Documentation and Analysis online analysis package — allows exploration of data directly online
* Crosstab Assignment Builder — lets students create contingency tables from ICSPR data using an instructor-predefined subset of variables

A unit within the [[University of Michigan Institute for Social Research|Institute for Social Research]] at the [[University of Michigan]], ICPSR is a membership-based organization, with approximately 760 member colleges and universities and other research institutions around the world. A Governing Council of leading scholars and data professionals guides and oversees the activities of ICPSR.

While many of the datasets housed at ICPSR are provided to the public without cost, most require the user to be a member of an ICPSR member institution or to pay a download fee.

The ICPSR data archive is listed in the [[Registry of Research Data Repositories]] re3data.org.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ICPSR entry in re3data.org|url=http://service.re3data.org/repository/r3d100010255|website=www.re3data.org|accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ICPSR Summer Program in Quantitative Methods of Social Research ==
The founders of ICPSR believed researchers needed training to use the data the consortium was providing.

The first Summer Program was held in 1963 and was attended by 21 faculty members and 41 graduate students from member institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/files/ICPSR/fifty/sumprog63-64.pdf|title = 1963-1964 ICPSR Annual Report|date = |accessdate = December 10, 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The program offered nine courses, with the most popular class, "Proseminar in Behavior Research Methods," attracting 46 participants.

The Summer Program expanded its offerings and participation over time. In 2015, the ICPSR Summer Program offered 81 courses addressing quantitative and analytic skills taught by 101 instructors from across North America and Europe. Participants included students, faculty, and nonacademic researchers from more than 40 countries, 300 institutions, and 30 disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/sumprog/|title = ICPSR Summer Program|date = |accessdate = December 10, 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4666">The '''International Network of Engineers and Scientists for global responsibility''' (INES) is an independent non-profit-organization concerned about the impact of science and technology on society. 

INES efforts focus on [[disarmament]] and international peace, ethics in science, responsibilities of scientists and the responsible use of science and technology, just and [[sustainable development]].

INES was founded in 1991 in [[Berlin]] at the international congress Challenges - Science and Peace in a Rapidly Changing Environment and has become a network of over 200 organisations and individual members.

== Challenges for Scientists and Engineers ==
Rapid changes in our environment and our societies are forcing us to become more conscious of our role in the world. Science and technology are employed in a worldwide competition for military and economic power. The impacts of this competition have global implications. We have entered a phase in which global developments are in conflict with basic requirements for human survival. Large stocks of weapons of mass destruction, the [[overexploitation]] of limited common resources, and a heavily unbalanced world economy provide fundamental challenges to human civilisation and may even threaten its existence.

Engineers and scientists play a key role, both in developing new knowledge that might threaten international security and in providing positive solutions for the future. They are as much a part of the problem as they can be a part of the solution.

== Activities ==
* Lobbies for [[nuclear disarmament]] and sustainable science.
* Works for the reduction of military spending.
* Promotes the awareness of ethical principles and the specific responsibility of engineers and scientists.
* Participates in [[whistleblowing]] campaigns, which support those who have been victimised for acting upon such principles.
* Encourages and facilitates public discourse and international communication among concerned scientists.
* Organises international conferences and regional workshops.
* Raises public awareness.
* Promotes environmentally sound technologies.
* Supports publishing books, e.g., Einstein, Peace Now!; Joseph Rotblat: Visionary for Peace. 

INES is a member of the [[International_Peace_Bureau|International Peace Bureau (IPB)]] and closely cooperates with IPB as well as the [[International_Physicians_for_the_Prevention_of_Nuclear_War|International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War (IPPNW)]] and the [[International Association of Lawyers Against Nuclear Arms]] (IALANA).

INES actively participates in the [[Middle_Powers_Initiative|Middle Powers Initiative (MPI)]] and has been present at the [[European_Social_Forum|European Social Forums]] since 2000 and at the [[World_Social_Forum|World Social Forums]]. INES participates in the [http://fm-sciences.org/?lang=en World Social Forum on Sciences].

== Goals ==
* [[Nuclear_Non-Proliferation_Treaty|Abolition of nuclear weapons]]
* Promoting the responsible and sustainable use of science and technology
* Implementing ethical principles in the education of scientists and engineers

== INES Bodies ==

'''International Winter University (IWU) Kassel''' is a short-term program that is held during the winter season by the [[University of Kassel]] every year. The IWU inspired from the international short-term programs held in Germany, then [[International Summer University (ISU) Kassel]] began the establishment of IWU in response to growing interest of international students to study in Germany. In addition to the international master programs,&lt;ref&gt;See the list of [http://cms.uni-kassel.de/unicms/index.php?id=study International Study Programmes] for details.&lt;/ref&gt; Uni Kassel organizes both of ISU and IWU as one of its internationalization strategies. The program of IWU Kassel is designed for university students as well as researchers and professionals who want to learn more about [[Germans|German]] and European perspectives in [[Environmental Sciences]] and German Language &amp; Culture. Environmental science has been one of the strengths of Uni Kassel since its foundation in 1971.

The uniqueness of IWU lies in the concern for the [[sustainability]] of global environment and cultural heritage. While IWU Kassel embraces [[globalization]] and [[innovation]] in the study program, the best practices of the program has been kept – arrangement of host families – to ensure that the visiting students are fully engaged in the [[local community]] and culture during their short stay in [[Kassel]]. Students are arranged to live with carefully selected host families and to practice their classroom knowledge with tandem partners and tutors. Workshops (e.g. German dancing, cooking, sports), field trips and excursions in Kassel and neighboring areas are also organized to introduce local culture and traditions to the students. Since the program is held during the term time, IWU students also have abundant opportunities to meet local students and participate in student activities on campus. The theme “sustainability” does not only cover the academic content of IWU, but also the program design which encourages continuous learning within and outside classrooms.

==History and Development of the Programme==
Following the success of ISU, the International Winter University (IWU) was established in 2005/06 to offer international students an alternative time frame to experience [[education in Germany]]. It is a pioneer of short-term winter programs in Germany and is one of the short-term programs bearing the DAAD&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://www.germany.daad.org/ DAAD] page.&lt;/ref&gt; Quality Seal.

Besides, IWU offers short-term credit-bearing academic program featuring the strengths of Uni Kassel in the areas of Environmental Sciences and German Language &amp; Culture studies. Apart from the academic components with specific foci, IWU is unique in its host-family program for students to experience first-hand German lifestyle. The University’s long-standing partnerships with industries in the region and experiences in university-industry [[knowledge transfer]] also bring additional benefit to IWU students by giving them opportunities to witness the application of academic knowledge in industrial settings.

Since its inception, IWU has received on average some 50 international students each year. The number of students is on the rise with its growing popularity among partnering universities. Some of these students returned to Kassel for further studies and many of them have become the ambassadors of the University and the city of Kassel in their home countries. 

==Program of Study==
The study program of IWU Kassel includes German language courses which are designed to meet the criteria of the [[Common European Framework of Reference for Languages]] (European Language Portfolio) at the following levels: A1, B1 and C1. Students will study in small groups under the supervision of experienced teachers qualified in '''teaching German as a foreign language'''. Interactive and innovative teaching methods are characteristics of this German language course.

The seminars for engineering module usually cover the following topics: an introduction to international climate policy, renewable energy and energy systems from a German and European perspective, environment protection measures, solar-thermal technologies and systems, [[photovoltaic]], the history and future of wind energy, [[wind farm management]], [[biomass]], [[natural gas storage]], and rational and efficient energy usage: low energy housing and sustainable building. Seminar for German culture module usually covers topics such as German history, literature, and art of the 19th and 20th centuries, which all activities will explore how contemporary German culture has been shaped by historical developments in the past 200 years, the "Age of Goethe" (Goethe-Zeit), the end of the 19th century ([[nietzsche]]), and the [[revolutionary]] [[art movement]] ([[bauhaus]] and [[expressionism]]).

Students will be awarded 6 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]] upon completion of the German language course and two academic seminars in either the engineering module or culture module. The seminars are taught by experienced faculty members in English and optionally in German. Students of the engineering module are arranged to visit industrial partners. Students from the cultural module are arranged to visit the museums and cultural establishments in Kassel.&lt;ref&gt;See a list of [https://www.kassel.de/englisch/culture/ museums] in Kassel.&lt;/ref&gt;

==About Kassel and Uni Kassel==


Kassel is a mid-sized city located in northern Hesse in the centre of Germany. The city has around 198,500 inhabitants and a total area of 107 km2. Kassel is known as the "Capital of the [[German Fairy Tale Route]]" for it is the place where [[Jacob Grimm]] and [[Wilhelm Grimm]] spent more than 30 years of their lives to collect and compile the [[Grimm's Fairy Tales]] (German: ''Grimms Märchen'') collection. Kassel is also the city of "[[documenta]]" where the world’s largest exhibition of contemporary art takes place every five years.

In 1971, Uni Kassel was founded in the city of Kassel as a reform university. The University is one of the first universities to have developed an international and inter-disciplinary perspective in research and learning. Being the youngest public university in the state of Hessen, it has currently a student population of over 25,000 which includes some 3,200 international students from over 120 countries.&lt;ref&gt;See the University of Kassel's [https://www.uni-kassel.de/uni/en/international-service/coming-to-kassel/facts-and-figures/ "Facts and figures"] page.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Priestley.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Priestley by [[Ellen Sharples]] (1794)&lt;ref&gt;McLachlan, ''Iconography'', 28-30.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Joseph Priestley]] ({{OldStyleDate|24 March|1733|13 March}} &amp;ndash; 8 February 1804) was a [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] [[natural philosopher]], [[English dissenters|Dissenting]] [[clergyman]], [[Political philosophy|political theorist]], and [[theologian]]. While his achievements in all of these areas are renowned, he was also dedicated to improving education in Britain; he did this on an individual level and through his support of the [[Dissenting academies]]. His [[grammar]] textbook was innovative and highly influential. More importantly, though, Priestley introduced a [[liberal arts]] curriculum at [[Warrington Academy]], arguing that a practical education would be more useful to students than a classical one. He was also the first to advocate the study and teaching of [[Historiography#Modern historiography|modern history]], an interest driven by his belief that humanity was improving and could bring about [[Millennialism|Christ's Millennium]].

==Personal and institutional teaching==
Priestley was a teacher in one way or another throughout his entire adult life. Once he discovered how much he enjoyed teaching, he consistently returned to this calling. At the school he established in [[Nantwich]], [[Cheshire]], he taught a wide range of topics to the town's children: [[Latin]] (and perhaps Greek), [[History of geography#Marco Polo to the 18th century|geography]], [[mathematics]], and [[English grammar]]. Unusually for the time, he also taught [[natural philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 1, 77-79.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the success of this school, he was offered the position of tutor of modern languages and rhetoric at [[Warrington Academy]]. In later years, when he lived in [[Leeds]] and [[Birmingham]], he created classes for the youth of his parishes; in Birmingham his three classes totaled 150 students and he helped organize the New Meeting [[Sunday school]]s for the poor.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 2, 242-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having received an excellent education at Daventry, a [[Dissenting academies|Dissenting academy]], and convinced that education was the key to shaping people and the world's future, Priestley continued to support the Dissenting academies throughout his life. For example, he advised the founders of [[New College at Hackney]] on its curriculum and preached a charity sermon on the "proper Objects of Education" to help raise money for the school. After emigrating to America in 1794, Priestley continued the educational projects that had always been important to him. He attempted to find funding for the Northumberland Academy and donated his library to it, but the academy did not open until 1813 and closed soon after. He communicated with [[Thomas Jefferson]] regarding the proper organization of a university and when Jefferson founded the [[University of Virginia]], it was Priestley's curricular principles that dominated the school. Jefferson also passed Priestley's advice on to [[James Madison (Episcopal Bishop)|Bishop James Madison]], whose [[College of William &amp; Mary]] also followed Priestley's maxims.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 2, 339-343.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wherever Priestley went, he also instructed people in [[natural philosophy]]. In Nantwich, he bought scientific instruments, such as a [[microscope]], for the school, and encouraged his students to give public presentations of their experiments. In [[Calne]], where he was a tutor to the son of [[William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne|Lord Shelburne]], Priestley convinced his patron to buy expensive equipment with which to teach his son the fundamentals of natural philosophy. He wrote in his ''[[Miscellaneous Observations relating to Education]]'' (1778), published during these years, that children should not only be educated in the ancient subjects of rhetoric and grammar but should also become acquainted with science early in their lives since scientific understanding underpins the progress of the human race.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs, 14; Schofield, Vol. 2, 10-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Priestley moved to Birmingham in 1780, he encouraged the town's children to play with his apparatus and ask questions about his laboratory: the Priestley home became a place of scientific education for the town's children. Priestley's rain gauge and "perambulator" (a wheelbarrow for recording distances) delighted them. The boys often played with his air-gun, aiming at a wig of Priestley's which he had fastened to a post. Priestley designed [[magic lantern]] shows for them and shocked them with his electrical machine.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 2, 245-6; Gibbs, 140; Uglow, 319-20; 407; Jackson, 227-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational philosophy==
In 1765, Priestley dedicated his ''[[Essay on a Course of Liberal Education for Civil and Active Life]]'' (1765),&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''[[Essay on a Course of Liberal Education for Civil and Active Life]]''. London: Printed for C. Henderson under the Royal Exchange; T. Becket and De Hondt in the Strand; and by J. Johnson and Davenport, in Pater-Noster-Row, 1765.&lt;/ref&gt; to the governing board of Warrington Academy. In it he argues that young people's education should anticipate their practical needs, something he accused the current universities, Dissenting and Establishment alike, of failing to do. In Priestley's eyes, the contemporary focus on a traditional [[classics|classical education]] prevented students from acquiring useful skills. This principle of utility guided his unusual curricular recommendations. He proposed that students study English and the modern languages instead of the classical languages, learn practical mathematics, read modern rather than ancient history, and study the constitution and laws of England. He believed that these topics would prepare his students for the commercial middle-class life that most of them would live; he did not believe that the poor should receive this same education, arguing "it could be of no service to their country, and often a real detriment to themselves."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Sheps, 137.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1766 Warrington Academy replaced its old classical curriculum with Priestley's new [[liberal arts]] model.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe, 52-4; Schofield, Vol. 1, 124-5; Watts, 95-7; Sheps, 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars of education have argued that this work and his later ''[[Miscellaneous Observations relating to Education]]'' (1778) (often reprinted with the ''Essay on Education'')&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''[[Miscellaneous Observations relating to Education]]. More especially, as it respects the conduct of the mind''. Bath: Printed by R. Cruttwell; London: J. Johnson, 1778.&lt;/ref&gt; made Priestley the "most considerable English writer on educational philosophy" between [[John Locke]] and [[Herbert Spencer]].&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 1, 121; see also Watts, 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==
[[File:PriestleyGrammar.png|left|upright|thumb|Title page from the first edition of Priestley's ''[[The Rudiments of English Grammar|Rudiments]]'' (1761)]]
Priestley's first successful educational venture was the establishment of a local school in [[Nantwich]]. Believing that all students should have a good grasp of the [[English language]] and its [[Grammar#History|grammar]] before learning any other language and dismayed at the quality of the instruction manuals available, Priestley wrote his own textbook: ''[[The Rudiments of English Grammar]]'' (1761).&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''[[The Rudiments of English Grammar]]; adapted to the use of schools. With observations on style''. London: Printed for R. Griffiths, 1761.&lt;/ref&gt; The book was very successful—it was reprinted for over fifty years. Its humor may have contributed to its popularity; for example, Priestley illustrated the ''[[couplet]]'' with this rhyme:

::Beneath this stone my wife doth lie:
::She's now at rest, and so am I.&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Jackson, 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Priestley also quoted from the most famous English authors, encouraging the middle-class association between reading and pleasure, a reading that would also, Priestley hoped, foster morality. Priestley's innovations in the teaching and description of English grammar, particularly his efforts to disassociate it from Latin grammar, made his textbook revolutionary and have led twentieth-century scholars to describe him as "one of the great grammarians of his time."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Schofield, Vol. 1, 79.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rudiments'' influenced all of the major grammarians of the late eighteenth century: [[Robert Lowth]], [[James Harris (grammarian)|James Harris]], [[John Horne Tooke]] and even the American [[Noah Webster]]. The resounding success of Priestley's book was one of the reasons that [[Warrington Academy]] offered him a teaching position in 1761.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 1, 83-5; 99-100; Jackson, 52; Gibbs, 16; Watts, 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Priestley's philosophy was founded on the fervent belief that a thorough understanding of history was necessary not only to worldly success but also to spiritual growth.&lt;ref&gt;Sheps, 135; 149.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote: "my view was, not merely to make history intelligible to persons who may choose to read it for amusement, but .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. to facilitate its subserviency to the highest uses to which it can be applied: to contribute to its forming the able statesman and the intelligent and useful citizen."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in McLachlan, 253.&lt;/ref&gt; His abiding interest in history, particularly [[Historiography#Modern historiography|modern history]], sets Priestley apart from his contemporaries. Priestley was the first person to advocate the serious study of modern history; no other British university was teaching the subject at the time and [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] would not begin until 1841.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 1, 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

While at Warrington Academy, Priestley gave a series of lectures on history and government; in 1788 he finally published them as ''[[Lectures on History and General Policy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''[[Lectures on History and General Policy]]''. Need first edition publication information.&lt;/ref&gt; They cover a wide array of topics—"forms of government, the feudal system, the rise of corporations, law, agriculture, commerce, the arts, finance and taxation, colonies, manners, population, war and peace"—demonstrating how all-encompassing Priestley believed the study of history to be.&lt;ref&gt;McLachlan, 255.&lt;/ref&gt; In this text, he narrates a version of history in which all events are "an exhibition of the ways of God;" studying history and nature, according to Priestley, "leads us to the knowledge of his perfections and of his will."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in McLachlan, 258.&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding history thus allows one to comprehend the natural laws God established and the perfection towards which they allow the world to tend. This [[Millennialism|millennial]] outlook is tied together with Priestley's belief in scientific progress and the improvement of the human race. Priestley maintained that each age improves upon the previous one and studying history allows people to see and participate in that progress.&lt;ref&gt;Sheps, 138.&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[Essay on the First Principles of Government]]'' (1768) he writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Highly as we think of the ''wisdom of our ancestors'' we justly think of ourselves, of the present age, wiser and . . . must see that we can . . . improve upon institutions that have been transmitted to us. Let us not doubt but that every generation in posterity will be as much superior to us in political, and all kinds of knowledge, and that they will be able to improve upon the best civil and religious institutions that we can prescribe for them. [Priestley's emphasis]&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Sheps, 139.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This millennial conception of history was in direct contrast to the two dominant historical paradigms of the time: [[Edward Gibbon|Edward Gibbon's]] decline narrative found in his ''[[Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' and [[David Hume|David Hume's]] cyclical narrative found in his ''[[History of England (Hume)|History of England]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sheps, 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike Gibbon and Hume, Priestley did not limit himself to narrating a version of history in these ''Lectures''; he also presented a method for historical research and was one of the first to argue for the primacy of original documents in the study of history. He also contended that much could be learned from "material evidence" of former civilizations, such as "ancient coins, medals and inscriptions," as well as "exchequer rolls, public and private ledger books, letters, diaries, monetary, financial and exchange systems, systems of fortifications and city plans . . . [in addition to] ballads and works of fiction."&lt;ref&gt;Sheps, 141.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 2, 254-5; McLachlan, 256; Sheps, 141.&lt;/ref&gt; The book was well received and was employed by many educational institutions, such as the Dissenting academy at Hackney,&lt;!-- Is New College at Hackney the same as [[Homerton College, Cambridge]]? --&gt; [[Brown University|Brown]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Yale University|Yale]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 2, 259; Sheps, 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory underpinning Priestley's [[millennialism|millennial]] view of history and his educational philosophy, was [[David Hartley (philosopher)|David Hartley's]] theory of association. Hartley's [[Association of Ideas|associationism]], an expansion of [[John Locke|John Locke's]] theories in ''[[Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1690) and laid out in ''[[Observations on Man]]'' (1749), postulated that the human mind operated according to natural laws and that the most important law for the formation of the self was "associationism." For Hartley, associationism was a physical process: vibrations in the physical world traveled through the nerves attached to people's sense organs and ended up in their brains. The brain connected the vibrations of whatever sensory input it was receiving with whatever feelings or ideas that the brain was simultaneously "thinking." These "associations" were impossible to avoid, formed as they were simply by experiencing the world; they were also the foundation of a person's character. Locke famously warns against letting "a foolish maid" convince a child that "goblins and sprites" are associated with the darkness, for "darkness shall ever afterwards bring with it those frightful ideas, and they shall be so joined, that he can no more bear the one than the other."&lt;ref&gt;Locke, John. ''An Essay Concerning Human Understanding''. Ed. [[Roger Woolhouse]]. New York: Penguin Books (1997), 357.&lt;/ref&gt; Associationism provided the scientific basis for Priestley's belief that man is "perfectible" and served as the foundation for all of his pedagogical innovations.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, 87; 93; Sheps, 137-9; 147-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Priestley viewed education as one of the primary forces shaping a person's character as well as the basis of morality, he, unusually for his time, promoted the education of women. Alluding to the language of Locke's ''Essay Concerning Human Understanding'', he wrote: "certainly, the minds of women are capable of the same improvement, and the same furniture, as those of men."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Watts, 89.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that if women were to care for children and be intellectually stimulating companions for their husbands, they had to be well-educated. Although Priestley advocated education for middle-class women, he did not extend this logic to the poor.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, 89-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charts of biography and history===
[[File:PriestleyChart.gif|thumb|right|A redacted version of Priestley's ''Chart of Biography'' (1765)]]
As a supplement to his lectures on history, Priestley also designed and published ''[[A Chart of Biography]]'' (1765)&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''[[A Chart of Biography]]''. London: J. Johnson, St. Paul's Church Yard, 1765 and Joseph Priestley, ''A description of a chart of biography''. [Warrington] : Printed at Warrington, 1764; ''A Description of a Chart of Biography''. Warrington: Printed by William Eyres, 1765.&lt;/ref&gt; and a ''New Chart of History'' (1769) (which he dedicated to [[Benjamin Franklin]]).&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''[[A New Chart of History]]''. London: Engraved and published for J. Johnson, 1769; ''A Description of a New Chart of History''. London: Printed for J. Johnson, 1770.&lt;/ref&gt; These charts and their accompanying ''Descriptions'' would allow students, Priestley said, to "trace out distinctly the dependence of events to distribute them into such periods and divisions as shall lay the whole claim of past transactions in a just and orderly manner."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Sheps, 141-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Chart of Biography'' covers a vast timespan, from 1200 BC to 1800 AD, and includes two thousand names. Priestley organized his list into six categories: Statesman and Warriors; Divines and Metaphysicians; Mathematicians and Physicians (natural philosophers were placed here); Poets and Artists; Orators and Critics (prose fiction authors were placed here); and Historians and Antiquarians (lawyers were placed here). Priestley's "principle of selection" was fame, not merit; therefore, as he mentions, the chart is a reflection of current opinion. He also wanted to ensure that his readers would recognize the entires on the chart. Priestley had difficulty assigning his all of his people to individual categories; he attempted to list them in the category under which their most important work had been done. [[Machiavelli]] is therefore listed as a historian rather than a statesman and [[Cicero]] is listed as a statesman instead of an orator. The chart was also arranged in order of importance; "statesmen are placed on the lower margin, where they are easier to see, because they are the names most familiar to readers."&lt;ref&gt;Sheps, 144.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McLachlan, 253; Sheps, 142-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Chart of History'' lists events in 106 separate locations; it illustrates Priestley's belief that the entire world's history was significant, a relatively new development in the eighteenth century, which had begun with [[Voltaire]] and [[William Robertson (historian)|William Robertson]]. The world's history is divided up into the following geographical categories: Scandinavia, Poland, Russia, Great Britain, Spain, France, Italy, Turkey in Europe, Turkey in Asia, Germany, Persia, India, China, Africa and America. Priestley aimed to show the history of empires and the passing of power; the subtitle of the ''Description'' that accompanied the chart was "A View of the Principle Revolutions of Empire that have taken place in the World" and he wrote that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The capital use [of the ''Charts'' was as] a most excellent mechanical help to the knowledge of history, impressing the imagination indelibly with a just image of the rise, progress, extent, duration, and contemporary state of all the considerable empires that have ever existed in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Sheps, 146.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
As Arthur Sheps in his article about the ''Charts'' explains, "the horizontal line conveys an idea of the duration of fame, influence, power and domination. A vertical reading conveys an impression of the contemporaneity of ideas, events and people. The number or density of entries . . . tells us about the vitality of any age."&lt;ref&gt;Sheps, 147.&lt;/ref&gt; Voids in the chart indicated intellectual Dark Ages, for example.&lt;ref&gt;Sheps, 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Both ''Charts'' were popular for decades—the ''[[A New Chart of History]]'' went through fifteen editions by 1816.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The trustees of Warrington were so impressed with Priestley's lectures and charts that they arranged for the [[University of Edinburgh]] to grant him a [[Doctor of Laws|Doctor of Law degree]] in 1764.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 1, 118-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious education==
[[File:PriestleyInstitutes.png|left|thumb|upright|Title page from the second edition of ''[[Institutes of Natural and Revealed Religion]]'']]
Priestley pondered what form the best religious education would take throughout his life. In the 1760s, when he was a student at [[Daventry Academy]], he imbibed the pedagogical principles of its founder, [[Philip Doddridge]]; although he was dead, Doddridge's emphasis on academic rigor and freedom of thought lived on at the school and impressed Priestley. These ideals would always be a part of Priestley's educational programs. He began writing one of these while still at Daventry, the ''[[Institutes of Natural and Revealed Religion]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''[[Institutes of Natural and Revealed Religion]]''. Need publication information for first edition.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, he did not publish the work until 1772, when he was at [[Leeds]]. In an effort to increase and stabilize membership at his church there, he taught three religious education classes. He subdivided the young people of the congregation into three categories: young men from 18-30 to whom he taught "the elements of natural and revealed religion" (young women may or may not be included in this group); children under 14 to whom he taught "the first elements of religious knowledge by way of a short catechism in the plainest and most familiar language possible"; and "an intermediate class" to whom he taught "knowledge of the Scriptures only."&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 1, 170; Gibbs, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the later [[Sunday school]]s established by [[Robert Raikes]], Priestley aimed his classes at middle-class Rational Dissenters; he wanted to teach them "the principles of natural religion and the evidences and doctrine of revelation in a regular and systematic course," something their parents could not provide.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Priestley wrote texts for the courses he envisioned: ''A Catechism for Children and Young Persons'' (1767), which went through eleven English-language editions;&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''A catechism for children, and young persons''. Need publication information for first edition.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''A Scripture Catechism, consisting of a Series of Questions, with References to the Scriptures instead of Answers'' (1772), which went through six British editions by 1817.&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''A scripture catechism, consisting of a series of questions, with references to the scriptures instead of answers''. need publication information for first edition.&lt;/ref&gt; He aimed to write non-sectarian ''Catechisms'', but in this he failed. He offended many orthodox readers by focusing on God's benevolence instead of on Adam's sin and Christ's atonement. Priestley implemented this same system of religious instruction over a decade later in [[Birmingham]], when he became a minister at New Meeting.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 1, 170-1; Gibbs, 37; Watts, 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Language assessment''' or '''language testing''' is a field of study under the umbrella of [[applied linguistics]].  Its main focus is the assessment of [[first language|first]], [[second language|second]] or other language in the school, college, or university context; assessment of language use in the workplace; and assessment of language in the immigration, citizenship, and [[right of asylum|asylum]] contexts.&lt;ref name="HornbergerSpringer"&gt;{{cite book |author=Hornberger, Nancy H. |author2=Shohamy, Elana   |title=Encyclopedia of Language and Education, Volume 7: Language Testing and Assessment |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=0-387-32875-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assessment may include listening, speaking, reading, [[Writing Assessment|writing]], an integration of two or more of these skills, or other constructs of language ability. Equal weight may be placed on knowledge (understanding how the language works theoretically) and [[language proficiency|proficiency]] (ability to use the language practically), or greater weight may be given to one aspect or the other.&lt;ref&gt;http://hrd.apec.org/index.php/Language_Assessment {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090722201227/http://hrd.apec.org/index.php/Language_Assessment |date=22 July 2009 }} APEC Human Resources Development Working Group&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{globalize|date=August 2008}}
The earliest works in language assessment in the United States date back to the 1950s to the pioneering studies and test created by [[Robert Lado]] and David Harris. The earliest large scale assessments in the United States were referred to as the Michigan Tests, developed by the English Language Institute at the University of Michigan, now known as [[CaMLA]], and the [[TOEFL|''Test of English as a Foreign Language'' (TOEFL)]]  developed by [[Educational Testing Service]] (ETS), Princeton, New Jersey.

The English Language Institute  at the University of Michigan ([[CaMLA]]) was established in 1941 and was the first of its kind in the United States. Charles Fries, Director of ELI, and [[Robert Lado]], Director of Testing at ELI, were determined to put foreign language teaching and testing on a "scientific" footing. The first test launched in 1946 was the ''Lado Test of Aural Comprehension''. Approximately 10 years later, a full suite of tests had been assembled: "an English language test battery", which was administered to incoming foreign students at Michigan and other universities. Today this is known at the Michigan English Language Assessment Battery ([[MELAB]]). In 1953, the ELI also developed the ECPE (Examination for the Certificate of Proficiency in English) exam, under contract to the United States Information Agency, for use abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Swales, J. 2013, Other Floors, Other Voices: A Textography of A Small University Building, https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xsz5AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT68&amp;lpg=PT68&amp;dq=1953+ECPE+melab+1985&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BiM65G_a-8&amp;sig=xoxFrmJibs4ScLuNpc8Z3ftocX4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lbKBVaGQK6iR7Aa2r4PoCA&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=1953%20ECPE%20melab%201985&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

TOEFL was launched in 1961 and was designed to assess the English language ability of students applying for admission to U.S. and Canadian colleges and universities.  This test, which is used widely around the world, is still in use although it is now only available in the internet-based format (now called the TOEFL iBT&lt;ref&gt;About the TOEFL iBT Test http://www.ets.org/toefl/ibt/about/ Retrieved 23 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;).

Many tests from other companies, universities and agencies compete for this market: [[International Test of English Proficiency|iTEP]] (International Test of English Proficiency), the [[Canadian English Language Proficiency Index Program]] (CELPIP) Test, the [[Pearson Language Tests|Pearson Language Test]]'s ''[[Pearson Test of English Academic|Pearson Test of English]]'' (PTE), [[CaMLA]] assessments including the ''Michigan English Language Assessment Battery'' ([[MELAB]]) and [[Cambridge English Language Assessment]], [[the British Council]] and the Australian IDP's ''[[International English Language Testing System]]'' (IELTS). In the United States, non-profit and other organizations such as the [[Center for Applied Linguistics]], Washington, D.C. and [[Language Testing International]], White Plains, NY have developed language tests that are used by many public and private agencies.  Many universities too, like the [[UCLA|University of California, Los Angeles]], [[Teachers College|Teachers College, Columbia University]], and the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign]], have developed English (and other) language tests to assess the abilities of their students and teaching assistants. These language assessments are generally known as proficiency or achievement assessments. Other modern English language tests developed include ''The General English Proficiency Test (GEPT)'' in Taiwan, the ''College English Test'' in China, and the ''STEP Eiken'' in Japan. New technology has also made a presence in the field: Versant's English and Dutch assessments use phone technology to record the speaking and automated scoring of their speaking tests, and the ETS is currently experimenting with automated scoring of their [[Writing Assessment|writing tests]].

== Organizations ==
The International Language Testing Association (ILTA) is one of the many organizations that organizes conferences, workshops, and a public forum for the discussion of important matters. ILTA's major annual conference is the Language Testing Research Colloquium.  ILTA's Lifetime Achievement Award winners include: [[Carol Chapelle]] (USA), Alan Davies (UK), Lyle Bachman (USA), Bernard Spolsky (Israel), John Clark (USA), Charles Alderson (UK) and Elana Shohamy (Israel).

Educational Testing Service, Princeton, New Jersey, the home of the TOEFL, offers an annual outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award in Second or Foreign Language and the [[University of Cambridge]], UK, also offers an annual outstanding master's degree Award in second language testing. In Europe, there are two organizations: the Association of Language Testers of Europe (ALTE) and the European Association for Language Testing and Assessment (EALTA). All of these associations have developed [[code of ethics|Codes of Ethics]] and Practice that all language assessment professionals are expected to adhere to.

== Annual conferences ==
There are many annual conferences on general or specific topics. Among the most important conferences is ILTA's official conference: the '''Language Testing Research Colloquium''' (LTRC), which has been held every year since 1978. In the last few years, it has been held in different parts of the world: Temecula, California, USA (2004); Ottawa, Canada (2005); Melbourne, Australia (2006); Barcelona, Spain (2007); Hangzhou, China (2008), and Denver, Colorado (2009), Cambridge, UK (2010), Ann Arbor, Michigan (2011), Princeton, New Jersey (2012), and Seoul, South Korea (2013).

ALTE's international conferences are held in different cities in Europe: Barcelona, Spain (2002); Berlin, Germany (2005); Cambridge, UK (2008); Krakow, Poland (2011); Paris,France (2014); Bologna, Italy (2017) ) with regional conferences in Perugia, Prague, Budapest, Sofia, and Lisbon. Similarly, there are regional meetings in China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. International conference themes have included supporting the European Year of Languages (2001), the impact of multilingualism (2005), the wider social and educational impact of assessment (2008) and the role of language frameworks (2011). Selected conference papers have been published through the [[Studies in Language Testing (SiLT)]] volumes.

== Publications ==
There are two premier journals in the field: ''Language Assessment Quarterly'' (published by [[Routledge]]/[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]) currently edited by James E. Purpura and ''[[Language Testing]]'' (published by [[Sage Publications]]) currently edited by Glenn Fulcher and April Ginther that publishes major findings from researchers. Both these journals are indexed in Thompson's SSCI list. SpringerNature publishes ''Language Testing in Asia'', which is focussed on Asia, the Middle East and Oceania. Other journals that publish articles from the field include ''[[Applied Linguistics (journal)|Applied Linguistics]]'', ''Language Learning'', ''[[TESOL Quarterly]]'', ''Assessing Writing'', and ''[[System (journal)|System]]''. Some of these journals have special issue volumes on Ethics in language assessment, structural equation modeling, language assessment in Asia, Classroom assessment, etc. and commentaries, brief reports, and book and test reviews.

The field has exploded in the last twenty years in terms of textbooks and research publications. The most popular books include: Lyle Bachman's ''Fundamental considerations in language testing,'' and ''Statistical Analyses for Language Assessment,'' Lyle Bachman and Adrian Palmer's ''Language Testing in Practice'' and ''Language Assessment in Practice,' Glenn Fulcher and Fred Davidson's 'Language Testing and Assessment: An Advanced Resource Book', Charles Alderson's 'Assessing Reading,'' John Read's ''Assessing Vocabulary,'' James Purpura's ''Assessing Grammar,'' Gary Buck's ''Assessing Listening,'' Sara Weigle's ''[[Assessing Writing]],' Glenn Fulcher's 'Practical Language Testing' and 'Testing Second Language Speaking'. Edited volumes include: [[Alister Cumming]]'s ''Validation in Language Testing,'' Antony John Kunnan's ''Validation in Language Assessment,'' and ''Fairness in Language Assessment,'' and the 'Routledge Handbook of Language Testing', edited by Glenn Fulcher and Fred Davidson.

The most popular book series are Michael Milanovic, Cyril Weir, and Lynda Taylor's [[Studies in Language Testing (SiLT)]] series, and Lyle Bachman and Charles Alderson's ''Cambridge Language Assessment Series.''

== Courses ==
Language assessment or language testing courses are taught as required or elective courses in many graduate and [[doctoral]] programs, particularly in the subjects of [[applied linguistics]], [[English for Speakers of Other Languages]], [[English as a second language|English as a second or foreign language]], or educational linguistics. These programs are known as MA or PhD programs in Applied Linguistics, Educational Linguistics, [[English as a Foreign or Second Language|TESOL]], [[TEFL]], or [[TESL]]. The focus of most courses is on test development, [[psychometric]] qualities of tests, [[Validity (logic)|validity]], [[reliability (statistics)|reliability]] and fairness of tests, and [[classical true score measurement theory]].  Additional courses focus on [[item response theory]], [[factor analysis]], [[structural equation modeling]], [[G factor (psychometrics)|G theory]], [[latent growth modeling]],  [[Qualitative research|qualitative analysis]] of test performance data such as conversation and [[discourse analysis]], and politics and language policy issues.

Universities that have regular courses and programs that focus on language assessment at the Ph.D. level include University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, University of Hawai'i, Manoa, Teachers College, Columbia University, Penn State University, Georgia State University, Northern Arizona University, McGill University, University of Toronto, Lancaster University (UK), University of Leicester, University of Bristol, University of Cambridge, University of Bedfordshire, and Guangdong University of Foreign Studies (China); at the MA level include Lancaster University, University of Leicester, California State Universities at Fullerton, Los Angeles, Long Beach, San Jose, and San Francisco.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3755">'''Mean world syndrome''' is a term coined by [[George Gerbner]] to describe a [[phenomenon]] whereby [[violence]]-related content of [[mass media]] makes viewers believe that the world is more dangerous than it actually is. Mean world syndrome is one of the main conclusions of [[cultivation theory]]. Gerbner, a pioneer researcher on the [[Social aspects of television|effects of television on society]], argued that people who watch television tended to think of the [[world]] as an [[intimidating]] and unforgiving place. A [[direct correlation]] between the amount of television one watches and the amount of [[fear]] one harbors about the world has been proven, although the direction of causality remains debatable in that persons [[fearful]] of the world may be more likely to retreat from it and in turn spend more time with indoor, [[Solitude|solitary]] activities such as television watching.&lt;ref name="pej"&gt;[http://www.pejnews.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4053&amp;catid=74:ijustice-news&amp;Itemid=216 George Gerbner Leaves the Mean World Syndrome] Posted by: lex on http://PEJ.org Sunday, January 08, 2006, Peace, Earth &amp; Justice News&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of opinions, images, and attitudes that viewers tend to form when watching television will have a direct influence on how the viewer perceives the real world. They will reflect and refer to the most common images or recurrent messages thought to affect their own real lives.  Gerbner once said: "You know, who tells the stories of a culture really governs human behaviour. It used to be the parent, the school, the church, the community. Now it's a handful of global conglomerates that have nothing to tell, but a great deal to sell."&lt;ref name="pej"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/49852245|title=Media effects: advances in theory and research|last=Gerbner|first=G.|last2=Gross|first2=L.|last3=Morgan|first3=M.|last4=Signorielli|first4=N.|last5=Shanahan|first5=J.|date=2002|publisher=Lawrence Elbaum Associates|year=|isbn=9781410602428|editor-last=Jennings|editor-first=Bryant|edition=2nd|location=Mahwah, NJ|pages=43-67|chapter=Growing Up with Television: Cultivation Processes|oclc=49852245|editor-last2=Zillmann|editor-first2=Dolf|chapter-url=http://academic.csuohio.edu/kneuendorf/quillin/Gerbneretal%20growing%20up%20with%20television%202002.pdf|chapter-format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gerbner says that the spread of the syndrome has become more intense over time. He describes how newer technologies such as [[VCR]], [[DVD]], and cable television do not disturb the cultivation theory, but actually allow more complete access and spread of recurrent messages, although widening access to the Internet world of information can counteract that. The 1930s [[behaviorism]] models, the [[Payne Fund Studies]], show that the effect that mass media has on our behavior is considerable. This is called the [[hypodermic needle model]]: people are injected with appropriate messages and ideas constructed by the mass media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.utwente.nl/en/bms/communication-theories/sorted-by-cluster/Mass%20Media/Hypodermic_Needle_Theory/|title=Mass Media {{!}} Hypodermic Needle Theory|last=|first=|date=September 6, 2004|website=Universiteit Twente|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3604">'''Media archaeology''' or archeology is a field that attempts to understand new and emerging media through close examination of the past, and especially through critical scrutiny of dominant progressivist narratives of popular commercial media such as [[film]] and [[television]].&lt;ref name=jp/&gt; Media archaeologists often evince strong interest in so-called [[Dead Media Project|dead media]], noting that new media often revive and recirculate material and techniques of communication that had been lost, neglected, or obscured.&lt;ref name=gh/&gt; Some media archaeologists are also concerned with the relationship between media fantasies and technological development, especially the ways in which ideas about imaginary or speculative media affect the media that actually emerge.&lt;ref name=sn/&gt;

The theories and concepts of media archaeology have been primarily elaborated by the scholars and cultural critics [[Thomas Elsaesser]], [[Erkki Huhtamo]], [[Siegfried Zielinski]], and Wolfgang Ernst, taking off from earlier work by [[Michel Foucault]] on the archaeology of knowledge, [[Walter Benjamin]] on the culture of mass media, and film scholars such as [[C.W. Ceram]] on the archaeology of cinema.&lt;ref name="jp" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gh" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sn" /&gt; Other writers who have contributed to the discipline's emergence include Eric Kluitenberg, [[Anne Friedberg]], [[Friedrich Kittler]], and [[Jonathan Crary]].&lt;ref name=jp/&gt; New media theorist [[Jussi Parikka]] defines media archaeology as follows:

:Media archaeology exists somewhere between materialist media theories and the insistence on the value of the obsolete and forgotten through new cultural histories that have emerged since the 1980s. I see media archaeology as a theoretically refined analysis of the historical layers of media in their singularity—a conceptual and practical exercise in carving out the aesthetic, cultural, and political singularities of media. And it's much more than paying theoretical attention to the intensive relations between new and old media mediated through concrete and conceptual archives; increasingly, media archaeology is a method for doing media design and art.&lt;ref name=gh/&gt;

'''Multimedia fugacity model''' is a model in [[environmental chemistry]] that summarizes the processes controlling chemical behavior in environmental media by developing and applying of mathematical statements or "models" of chemical fate.&lt;ref name="Mackay"&gt;

The models are formulated using the concept of [[fugacity]], which was introduced by [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] in 1901 as a criterion of equilibrium and convenient method of calculating multimedia equilibrium partitioning.
The fugacity of chemicals is a mathematical expression that describes the rates at which chemicals diffuse, or are transported between phases. The transfer rate is proportional to the fugacity difference that exists between the source and destination phases.
For building the model, the initial step is to set up a mass balance equation for each phase in question that includes fugacities, concentrations, fluxes and amounts. The important values are the proportionality constant, called [[fugacity capacity]] expressed as Z-values (SI unit: mol/m3 Pa) for a variety of media, and transport parameters expressed as D-values (SI unit: mol/Pa h) for processes such as advection, reaction and intermedia transport. The Z-values are calculated using the equilibrium partitioning coefficients of the chemicals, [[Henry's law]] constant and other related physical-chemical properties.&lt;ref name="Mackay"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Depending on the number of phases and complexity of processes different level models are applied. Many of the models apply to steady-state conditions and can be reformulated to describe time-varying conditions by using differential equations. The concept has been used to assess the relative propensity for chemicals to transform from temperate zones and “condense out” at the polar regions.
The multicompartmental approach has been applied to the “quantitative water air sediment interaction" or "QWASI" model designed to assist in understanding chemical fate in lakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Multiple religious belonging''' refers to the idea that individuals can belong to more than one religious tradition. While this is often seen as a common reality in regions such as [[Asia]] with its many religions, religious scholars have begun to discuss multiple religion belonging with respect to religious traditions such as [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]].{{sfnm |1a1=Cornille |1y=2002 |2a1=Phan |2y=2003}}

==Context==
In some religions such as [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]], those who hold to an [[exclusivism|exclusivist]] understanding of religion see multiple religious belonging as problematic. This is in contrast with countries such as [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]], [[Vietnam]], [[India]], [[Nepal]] and [[Sri Lanka]], whose cultures have a long history of being influenced by different religions.{{sfn|Phan|2003|p=498}} Moreover, in the [[Postmodernity|postmodern]] period people tend to question their identity, because of the unlimited choices of religions, which leads to the difficulty in defining their identity.{{sfn|Aylesworth|2015}}

Van Bragt showed that 79% of Japanese self-identify as [[Shintoist]]s and 75% self-identify as [[Buddhism|Buddhists]]. The reason for the extremely high percentage of both religions is that many Japanese consider themselves as both a Shintoist and a Buddhist and do not consider it a problem to belong to more than one religion.{{sfn|Van Bragt|2002|p=8}} (Whether this statistic is correct is arguable.{{efn|According to Mark R. Mullins's figures, there are only 30–33% of Japanese consider themselves as having "personal faith", while others usually see themselves as "without religion" (''mushukyo'').{{sfn|Mullins|2011}} For further discussions, see {{harvnb|Mullins|2011|pp=197–198}}.}}) This phenomenon, according to Van Bragt, is a "[[division of labour]]". Van Bragt argued that the cause of this phenomenon is that, different from the Western concept of religion, Shintoism and Buddhism in Japan are defined by their rituals and practices, not by their moral and social authority.{{efn|According to Van Bragt, while Buddhism and Shintoism govern the rituals and practices of Japanese, Confucianism is regarded as the authority for morality and the source of principles of social life.{{sfn|Van Bragt|2002|p=9}}}} Thus, the Japanese can belong to several religions that do not conflict with each other in terms of social and ethical issues.

Scholars such as [[Catherine Cornille]], [[Peter C. Phan]], [[Francis Xavier Clooney]], [[Jan Van Bragt]], [[Aloysius Pieris]] and [[Devaka Premawardhana]] have questioned the possibility of defining oneself into multiple religions. For these scholars, "religious belonging" is not an individual's subjective sense of a particular religion but rather, in Cornille's words, "the recognition of one's religious identity by the tradition itself and the disposition to submit to the conditions for membership as delineated by that tradition."{{sfn|Cornille|2002|p=4}} For Cornille, the ultimate purpose of a scholarly discussion on multiple religious belonging is to transform one's religion through the understanding of other religions.{{sfn|Cornille|2002|p=5}}

== Types of approaches ==
Based on Van Bragt's study, scholars have tried to investigate the possibility for adherents of a religion such as Christianity to belong to multiple religions. The approach to Christian multiple religious belonging, according to Devaka Premawardhana, can be divided into two trends: [[Peter C. Phan|Peter Phan]]'s approach based on a Christological ground, in which he emphasises on Christ's "asymmetrically superior status", and [[Francis Xavier Clooney|Francis Clooney]]'s approach rooted in a methodological ground, which tries to cross boundaries into another religion just as religions must have discrete entities.{{sfn|Premawardhana|2011|p=77}}{{Elucidate|date=December 2017|reason=What does 'just as religions must have discrete entities' mean? Please clarify this sentence.}} These two approaches are summarised below.

=== Christological approach ===
Phan's approach emphasised the assymmetricality in which [[Jesus]] is the [[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]] made flesh and the climax of God dealing with humankind.{{sfn|Phan|2003|p=503}} In an attempt to resonate with one's cultural identity and tradition, Phan explained that multiple religious belonging is necessary in order for practitioners of multiple belonging to treat other religions as a qualifier of their identity. This approach, according to Phan, does not deny one's Christian identity, which functions as substantive in relation to non-Christian religion.{{sfn|Phan|2003|pp=509–510}} Phan noted that multiple religious belonging is not a new issue in the twenty-first century but rather the common form of life of the first-century Christians recorded in the book of [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]]. In Phan's view, the disappearance of this trend was "a tragic loss to both [[Judaism]] and Christianity", because it led to a subsequent history of bitter hatred, especially from the side of Christianity.{{sfn|Phan|2003|pp=504–505}}

=== Methodological approach ===
As a [[Comparative theology|comparative theologian]], Clooney writes about the diversity in the world nowadays, especially with respect to the flourishing of different religions. For Clooney, reflecting on one's religion in this [[Pluralism (philosophy)|pluralistic]] world is necessary, so that we can "see the others in light of our own, and our own in light of the other."{{sfn|Clooney|2010|p=13}} Focusing on the study of scriptural and theological texts, Clooney compares them between Christian traditions and non-Christian religions, to "cross boundaries" to other traditions, so that one would re-think his or her theology, which would thus shape his or her identity.{{sfn|Clooney|2004}} After more than 40 years of studying Hinduism, Clooney concluded that he finds the distinctive disciplines of theology and Hinduism are "mutually enriching".{{sfn|Clooney|2010|pp=16–17}} By applying this approach, according to Clooney, one can start within his or her "home" tradition, enter a different tradition and return to his or her tradition, which is enriched and reformulated after crossing boundaries.{{sfn|Premawardhana|2011|pp=87–88}}

== Challenges and controversy ==
While scholars studying multiple religious belonging attempt to appreciate other religions' traditions besides their own, the conservative segment of Christianity tends to question the [[Inclusivism|inclusivistic]] view of multiple religious belonging because it implies that salvation can be found from somewhere else other than Jesus Christ.{{sfn|Kärkkäinen|2010}}{{efn|For definitions of traditional typology such as exclusivism and inclusivism, see {{harvnb|Migliore|2004|pp=306–307}}.}} In a 2010 article, [[Veli-Matti Kärkkäinen]], a systematic theologian, questioned the approach of "othering" those that have traditions different from Christians' because God is the one who offers salvation; Christians only witness it. It is out of humility that Christians can say that salvation belongs to God, and God only, in Kärkkäinen's view.{{sfn|Kärkkäinen|2010}} On the other hand, scholars studying multiple religious belonging such as [[John B. Cobb]] see this as an opportunity rather than a threat: "I do not see multiple religious belonging as the primary way into the future. The primary way is the transformation of the particular religious traditions, at least in the Christian case, through their new encounter with other traditions." For Cobb, engaging in [[interfaith dialogue]] helps smooth the tension between Christianity and Judaism and avoid misunderstanding toward [[Islam]].{{sfn|Cobb|2002|p=27}}

In a 2017 article, sociologist Steve Bruce pointed out that most of the published writings in which multiple religious belonging is studied are purely conceptual and offer "only anecdotes to illustrate theoretical or classificatory discussions".{{sfn|Bruce|2017|p=606}} Bruce argued that the few attempts to gather empirical data on the phenomenon have conflated a variety of different attitudes that should not be given the label of "multiple religious belonging", attitudes such as: [[Universalism|universalistic]] re-interpretation of multiple religions, multiple religious association through family ties, multiple religious interest or sympathies, ancillary religious respect for a specific aspect of a religion, and secular equal respect for all religions.{{sfn|Bruce|2017|p=610–611}} Bruce argued that the term "multiple religious belonging" should be strictly confined to being "an observant 'member' of more than one religion (religion here meaning such high level abstractions as Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism, Buddhism etc)", and since most religions have strict requirements for and expectations of observant members, sociologists should expect multiple religious belonging, defined in this way, to be "remarkably rare".{{sfn|Bruce|2017|p=611}}

The '''palm branch''' is a symbol of victory, triumph, peace, and eternal life originating in the ancient [[Near East]] and [[Mediterranean world]]. The palm ''([[Phoenix (plant)|Phoenix]])'' was sacred in [[Mesopotamian religion]]s, and in [[ancient Egyptian religion|ancient Egypt]] represented immortality. In [[Judaism]], the [[lulav]], a closed [[wikt:frond|frond]] of the [[date palm]] is part of the [[Three Pilgrimage Festivals|festival]] of [[Sukkot]]. A palm branch was awarded to victorious athletes in [[ancient Greece]], and a palm frond or the tree itself is one of the most common attributes of [[Victoria (mythology)|Victory personified]] in [[ancient Rome]].

In [[Christianity]], the palm branch is associated particularly with [[Palm Sunday]], when according to Christian tradition palm branches were waved at the [[Triumphal entry into Jerusalem|triumphal entry of Jesus into Jerusalem]]. It was adopted into [[Christian symbolism|Christian iconography]] to represent the victory of [[Christian martyr|martyrs]], or the victory of the spirit over the flesh.

Since a victory signals an end to a conflict or competition, the palm developed into a symbol of peace, a meaning it can have in [[Islam]],&lt;ref&gt;Solomon A. Nigosian, ''Islam: Its History, Teaching, and Practices'' (Indiana University Press, 2004), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; where it is often associated with Paradise.

The palm appears on several flags or seals representing countries or other places, with the [[coconut palm]] associated with the [[tropics]].

==Antiquity==
[[File:Cylinder Seal, Achaemenid, modern impression 05.jpg|thumb|Palms on an [[Achaemenid]] seal impression, 5th century BC. The iconography of palm was commonly used by ancient Babylonians.]]
[[File:Apollo Artemis Delos MAN.jpg|thumb|Apollo holding a laurel branch and [[patera|libation bowl]], next to a palm that represents his birth on Delos ([[Comacchio Painter]], ca. 450 BC)]]
In [[Religion in Mesopotamia|Assyrian religion]], the palm is one of the trees identified as the [[World Tree|Sacred Tree]]&lt;ref&gt;Mariana Giovino, ''The Assyrian Sacred Tree: A History of Interpretations'' (Academic Press Fribourg Vandenhoeck and Ruprecht Göttingen, 2007), ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; connecting heaven, represented by the crown of the tree, and earth, the base of the trunk. Reliefs from the 9th century BC show winged ''genii'' holding palm fronds in the presence of the Sacred Tree.&lt;ref&gt;Holly Chase, "The Date Palm: Pillar of Society," in ''Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery 1989: Staples'' (Prospect Books, 1990), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; It is associated with the goddess [[Ishtar]] and is found on the [[Ishtar Gate]].  In ancient [[Mesopotamia]], the [[date palm]] may have represented fertility in humans. The Mesopotamian goddess [[Inanna]], who had a part in the sacred marriage ritual, was believed to make the dates abundant.&lt;ref name="datesex"&gt;[http://www.museum.upenn.edu/new/research/Exp_Rese_Disc/NearEast/datesex.shtml Sex Life of the Date] University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology&lt;/ref&gt; Palm stems represented long life to the [[Ancient Egypt]]ians, and the god [[Huh (god)|Huh]] was often shown holding a palm stem in one or both hands. The palm was carried in Egyptian funeral processions to represent eternal life.&lt;ref&gt;Fernando Lanzi and Gioia Lanzi, ''Saints and Their Symbols: Recognizing Saints in Art and in Popular Images'' (Liturgical Press, 2004), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kingdom of Nri]] ([[Igbo people|Igbo]]) used the ''omu'', a tender palm frond, to sacralize and restrain.&lt;ref&gt;Sulayman Nyang and Jacob K. Olupona, ''Religious Plurality in Africa: Essays in Honour of John S. Mbiti'' (Mouton de Gruyter, 1995), p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue the palm in the [[Parthian language|Parthian]] poem ''[[Drakht-e Asurig]]'' serves as a reference to the Babylonian faith.&lt;ref name=iranica&gt;[[Ahmad Tafazzoli]], [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/draxti-asurig "DRAXT Ī ĀSŪRĪG"], ''[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]'', December 15, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

The palm was a symbol of [[Phoenicia]] and appeared on Punic coins. In [[ancient Greek language|ancient Greek]], the word for palm, ''phoinix,'' was thought to be related to the [[ethnonym]].

In [[Archaic Greece]], the palm tree was a sacred sign of [[Apollo]], who had been born under a palm on the island of [[Delos]].&lt;ref&gt;Apollo's birth is described in the ''Homeric Hymn to Delian Apollo''.&lt;/ref&gt; The palm thus became an icon of the [[Delian League]]. In recognition of the alliance, [[Cimon|Cimon of Athens]] erected a bronze statue of a palm tree at [[Delphi]] as part of a victory monument commemorating the [[Battle of the Eurymedon]] (469/466 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Evelyn B. Harrison, "Pheidias," in ''Personal Styles in Greek Sculpture'' (Cambridge University Press, 1996), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to representing the victorious League, the bronze palm ''(phoinix)'' was a visual pun on the defeated Phoenician fleet.&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen Kuiper, ''Ancient Greece: From the Archaic Period to the Death of Alexander the Great'' (Britannica Educational Publishing, 2011), p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; From 400 BC onward, a palm branch was awarded to the victor in athletic contests, and the practice was brought to Rome around 293 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]] 10.47.3; Guillermo Galán Vioque, ''Martial, Book VII: A Commentary'', translated by J.J. Zoltowski (Brill 2002), p. 411.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CONSTANTINUS I RIC VII 100-80000773.jpg|thumb|left|[[Solidus (coin)|Solidus]] (335–336 AD) of [[Constantine I]], the first Christian emperor, with Victory holding a palm and a [[tropaion|military trophy]] next to a [[Chi Rho|christogram]]]]
The palm became so closely associated with victory in ancient Roman culture that the Latin word ''palma'' could be used as a [[metonym]] for "victory", and was a sign of any kind of victory.&lt;ref&gt;Vioque, ''Martial, Book VII: A Commentary'', pp. 61, 206, 411.&lt;/ref&gt; A lawyer who won his case in the [[Roman forum|forum]] would decorate his front door with palm leaves.&lt;ref&gt;Vioque, ''Martial, Book VII: A Commentary'', pp. 205–206.&lt;/ref&gt; The palm branch or tree became a regular attribute of the [[Victoria (mythology)|goddess Victory]], and when [[Julius Caesar]] secured his rise to sole power with a [[Battle of Pharsalus|victory at Pharsalus]], a palm tree was supposed to have sprung up miraculously at the Temple of [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]], the Greek counterpart of Victory, in [[Tralles]], later known as Caesarea, in Asia Minor.&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''Bellum Civile'' 3.105; Veit Rosenberger, "Republican ''Nobiles'': Controlling the ''Res Publica''," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 302; Anna Clark, ''Divine Qualities: Cult and Community in Republican Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 2007), p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''toga palmata'' was a [[toga]] ornamented with a palm motif; it was worn to celebrate a [[Roman triumph|military triumph]] only by those who had a previous triumph. The toga itself was the garment of the civilian at peace, and was worn by the ''triumphator'' to mark his laying down of arms and the cessation of war. The use of the palm in this setting indicates how the original meaning of "victory" shaded into "peace" as the aftermath of victory.&lt;ref&gt;Vioque, ''Martial, Book VII: A Commentary'', p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Coins issued under [[Constantine I]], the first Christian emperor, and his successors continue to display the traditional iconography of Victory, but often combined with Christian symbolism such as [[christogram]]s. The Roman senator [[Quintus Aurelius Symmachus|Symmachus]], who tried to preserve [[Religion in ancient Rome|Rome's religious traditions]] under Christian domination, is pictured on an ivory diptych bearing a palm branch in an allegorical triumph over death.

In [[Judaism]], the [[date palm]] ([[Lulav]]) is one of the [[Four Species]] used in the daily prayers on the feast of [[Sukkot]]. It is bound together with the [[hadass]] ([[Myrtus|myrtle]]), and [[Aravah (Sukkot)|aravah]] ([[willow]]).  The [[Midrash]]&lt;ref&gt;Vayikra Rabbah 30:12.&lt;/ref&gt; notes that the binding of the Four Species symbolizes the desire to unite the four "types" of Jews in service of God.

During the Roman Empire, the date palm represented [[Judaea (Roman province)|Judaea]] and its fecundity to both Romans and Jews. Roman sources praise the date as the produce of the province. The date palm was a frequent image for Judaea on Imperial coinage, most notably on the [[Judaea Capta coinage|''Iudaea Capta'' series]], when the typical [[tropaion|military trophy]] is replaced by the palm. The palm appears also on at least one [[Hasmonean]] coin and on coinage issued in 38–39 AD by [[Herod Antipas]]. Palm ornaments are found also on [[Ossuary#Jewish|Jewish ossuaries]].&lt;ref&gt;Steven Fine, "Between Rome and Jerusalem: The Date Palm as 'Jewish Symbol," in ''Art And Judaism In The Greco-Roman World: Toward A New Jewish Archaeology'' (Cambridge University Press, 2005), pp. 140–145.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, [[Judean date palm#Germination of 2000-year-old seed|Judean date palm seeds dated at around 2000 years old]] were recovered during excavations at [[Herod the Great]]'s palace on [[Masada]] in Israel. In 2005, some of the seeds were planted. One grew and has been nicknamed "[[Methuselah]]".&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Bird Rose, "On the Spot: In the Red Center," in ''The Face of the Earth: Natural Landscapes, Science, and Culture'' (University of California Press, 2011), p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:900-101 Eberhard im Bart.jpg|thumb|[[Eberhard I, Duke of Württemberg]] (1492). The [[Duke]] chose a [[Arecaceae|palm]] as his personal symbol in commemoration of his [[pilgrimage]] to [[Jerusalem]] in 1468 when he became a [[Knight of the Holy Sepulchre]].]]
In contemporary Christianity, the palm branches carried on Palm Sunday originate in the [[Triumphal entry into Jerusalem|triumphal entry of Christ into Jerusalem]]. Early [[Christian]]s used the palm branch to symbolize the victory of the faithful over enemies of the soul, as in the [[Palm Sunday]] festival celebrating the triumphal entry of [[Jesus]] into [[Jerusalem]]. In western [[Christian art]], [[Christian martyrs|martyrs]] were often shown holding a palm frond as an [[Emblem|attribute]], representing the victory of spirit over flesh, and it was widely believed that a picture of a palm on a tomb meant that a martyr was buried there.&lt;ref name="martyr"&gt;{{citeweb | url= http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11432a.htm |date=1911|author=Hassett, M.|title=Palm in Christian Symbolism|work=The Catholic Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Origen]] calls the palm (In Joan, XXXI) the symbol of victory in that war waged by the spirit against the flesh. In this sense it was especially applicable to martyrs, the victors par excellence over the spiritual foes of mankind; hence the frequent occurrence in the Acts of the martyrs of such expressions as "he received the palm of martyrdom." On 10 April 1688 it was decided by the [[Congregation of Rites]] that the palm when found depicted on catacomb tombs was to be regarded as a proof that a martyr had been interred there. Subsequently, this opinion was acknowledged by Mabillon, Muratori, [[Benedict XIV]] and others to be untenable; further investigation showed that the palm was represented not only on tombs of the post-persecution era, but even on tombs of those who did not practice Christianity.

The general significance of the palm on early Christian monuments is slightly modified according to its association with other symbols (e.g., with the [[monogram]] of Christ, the [[Ichthys|Ichthus]] (Fish), or the Good Shepherd). On some later monuments the palm was represented merely as an ornament separating two scenes. Palms also represented heaven, evidenced by ancient art often depicting Jesus in heaven among palms.

In the [[Middle Ages]], [[pilgrim]]s to the [[Holy Land]] would bring back palms for deposit at their home churches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=tappan&amp;book=bold&amp;story=crusades When Knights Were Bold]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Crusades|Crusader]]s would carry or wear an image of one, seen today in the [[Catholic]] [[Order of the Holy Sepulchre]], which still awards a [[Palm of Jerusalem]] decoration. In addition, the [[Custody of the Holy Land]], courtesy of the [[Catholic Church]], bestows the [[Jerusalem Pilgrim's Cross]] on Catholic pilgrims to the city.

==Islam==
The palm is richly significant in Islamic culture, and the palm symbolizes rest and hospitality in many cultures of the Middle East. The presence of palm trees around an [[oasis]] showed that water was the gift of [[Allah]].&lt;ref&gt;Holly Chase, "The Date Palm: Pillar of Society," in ''Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery 1989: Staples'' (Prospect Books, 1990), p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Quran]], the palm appears in the [[paradise|paradisical]] imagery of the Garden ''([[Jannah]])''.&lt;ref&gt;Nerina Rustomji, ''The Garden and the Fire: Heaven and Hell in Islamic Culture'' (Columbia University Press, 2009), pp. 43, 67.&lt;/ref&gt; In one prophetic tradition, the [[Dome of the Rock]] will stand on a palm tree issuing from one of the rivers of Paradise.&lt;ref&gt;Rustomji, ''The Garden and the Fire,'' p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muhammad]] is said to have built his home out of palm,{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} to have leaned against a palm while speaking,&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ipgrave, ''Bearing the Word: Prophecy in Biblical and Qur'ānic Perspective'' (Church House Publishing, 2005), p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; and to have raised the first [[mosque]] as a roof placed on palm trees.&lt;ref&gt;Afif Bahnassi, "Art and Aesthetic Creativity," in ''Culture and Learning in Islam'' (UNESCO Publishing, 2003), p. 566.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Quran (19:16–34), [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] is said to have given birth to Jesus under a [[date palm]].&lt;ref&gt;Sûrah XIX: 23, 25, 26, as cited by Chase, "The Date Palm"; entry on "Mary," in ''The New Encyclopedia of Islam'', edited by Cyril Glassé (Stacey International, 1989, rev. ed. 2001), p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[northern Sudan]], the ''doum'' palm is the symbol of endurance ''(doum)'', and particularly of the Muslim saint who gave his name to [[Wad Hamid]].&lt;ref&gt;Johann Christoph Bürgel, "Islam Reflected in the Contemporary Literature of Muslim Peoples," in ''Islam in the World Today: A Handbook of Politics, Religion, Culture, and Society'' (Cornell University Press, 2010), p. 825.&lt;/ref&gt;  The palm also appears on a number of coins from Islamic states, for example the 1970 [[Tunisia]]n 1 [[dinar]] issue honoring the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]], and several [[Iraq]]i coins of the 1970s.

==Modern usage==

The Latin motto of [[Lord Nelson]] is ''Palmam qui meruit ferat'',  "Let him bear the palm who has deserved it". The motto has been adopted by numerous other organizations, including the [[University of Southern California]].

Today, the palm, especially the [[coconut palm]], is a symbol of a tropical island paradise.&lt;ref name="VPEintro"&gt;[http://www.plantapalm.com/vpe/introduction/vpe_introduction.htm Virtual Palm Encyclopedia – Introduction]&lt;/ref&gt; Palms appear on the flags and seals of several places where they are native, including those of [[Malta]], [[Haiti]], [[Paraguay]], [[Guam]], [[Florida]], [[Poland]], [[Australia]] and [[South Carolina]]. It also appeared on the flag of the short-lived [[Tripolitanian Republic]] (1918–1923), though not followed in later Libyan flags.

The palm branch symbol is included in [[Medieval Unicode Font Initiative|MUFI]]: ⸙ (2E19, ‘Palm Branch’ in [[Unicode]]).

In [[Arabic language|Arabic]], the term ''Fog al-Nakhal'' ({{lang|ar|فوق النخل}}), which literally translates to "''above the palm trees''", is an [[idiom]] used to indicate euphoria, satisfaction or strong happiness.

{{Bible-related |interpretation}}

"'''Pardes'''" refers to (types of) [[Hermeneutics|approaches]] to biblical [[exegesis]] in rabbinic [[Judaism]] or to [[Zohar|interpretation]] of text in [[Torah study#Forms of traditional Jewish Torah study|Torah study]]. The term, sometimes also spelled '''PaRDeS''', is an [[acronym]] formed from the same initials of the following four approaches:
*[[Peshat|'''P'''esh'''a'''t]] ({{Hebrew|פְּשָׁט}}) – "surface" ("straight") or the literal (direct) meaning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=225&amp;letter=P Peshat] in the ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''R'''emez ({{Hebrew|רֶמֶז}}) – "hints" or the deep (allegoric: hidden or symbolic) meaning beyond just the literal sense.
*'''De'''rash ({{Hebrew|דְּרַשׁ}}) – from Hebrew ''darash'': "inquire" ("seek") – the comparative ([[midrash]]ic) meaning, as given through similar occurrences.
*'''S'''od ({{Hebrew|סוֹד}}) (pronounced with a long O as in 'lore') – "secret" ("mystery") or the esoteric/mystical meaning, as given through inspiration or revelation.

Each type of ''Pardes'' interpretation examines the extended meaning of a text.  As a general rule, the extended meaning never contradicts the base meaning.  The ''[[Peshat]]'' means the plain or contextual meaning of the text.  ''Remez'' is the allegorical meaning.  ''Derash'' includes the metaphorical meaning, and ''Sod'' represents the hidden meaning.  There is often considerable overlap, for example when legal understandings of a verse are influenced by mystical interpretations or when a "hint" is determined by comparing a word with other instances of the same word.

Some books such as ''[[Tolaat Yaakov]]'', divide Pardes into Peshat, Remez, ''Din'' (law), and Sod.  According to this understanding, ''Derash'' is divided into the homiletics, which are classified under Remez, and legal interpretations, which are classified under Din.

==Context==

===Exoteric and esoteric in ''Sod''===
* [[Exoteric]] means that Scripture is read in the context of the physical world, human orientation, and human notions. The first three exegetical methods: ''Peshat-Simple'', ''Remez-Hinted'', and ''Drush-Homiletic'' belong to the exoteric "''Nigleh-Revealed''" part of Torah embodied in mainstream [[Rabbinic literature]], such as the [[Talmud]], [[Midrash]], and exoteric-type [[Jewish commentaries on the Bible]].
* [[Esoteric]] means that the surface meaning of Scripture, as with esoteric texts in general, while it may also be true, is not the real truth to which Scripture refers. Instead, the surface meaning hides/covers/conceals its real intention. The real truth is the secret hidden within the deceptive covering. The fourth level of exegesis, ''Sod-Secret'', belongs to the esoteric "''Nistar-Hidden''" interpretations of Scripture found alternatively in [[Jewish mysticism|Jewish mysticism-Kabbalah]] or in [[Jewish philosophy|Jewish philosophy-Metaphysics]]. Religious adherents of Kabbalah and of Rationalism fought over their alternative claims to know the esoteric meaning. In Medieval Jewish Rationalism, the hidden truth within Scripture was human-centred [[Divine transcendence]] philosophical depths. In Kabbalistic mysticism, it was God's Persona-centred [[Divine immanence]] emanations. Therefore, each tradition interpreted classic Rabbinic references to [[Pardes (legend)]], ''Maaseh Bereishit/Maaseh Merkabah'' ([[Talmudic]] passages about esotericism) and to the connected 4-fold structure of PaRDeS exegesis differently.

Both mystical and rational religious Judaism, however, together rooted in mainstream [[Rabbinic literature]] and [[Mitzvot]] observance, accepted common truth in ''Peshat'', ''Remez'', and ''Drush'' levels of Judaism. In this way, Jewish religious esotericism is inseparable from exoteric Judaism. Their esoteric meanings did not deny the truth of exotericism, but rather reinforced the need for exoteric [[Halacha]] Jewish law and practical observance of the [[613 Mitzvot]] as God's plan in Creation.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

The mystical view of esoteric ''Sod-Secret'' as the elite doctrines of [[Kabbalah]] also gave conceptual context to ''Peshat'', ''Remez'', and ''Drush'': in the mystical unfolding of the spiritual [[Four Worlds]], each realm corresponds to a level in PaRDeS. God's immanence is found at successively descending levels of reality. Torah descends from on High, while man ascends the levels of PaRDeS exegesis in Torah from Below. In this sense, ascending the four levels of interpretation reveals greater divinity in Torah; the exoteric and esoteric are linked in a continuous chain. While rationalists read Rabbinic [[Aggadah]] legends metaphorically, kabbalists read them as allusions to Kabbalah.

===Halacha and Aggadah in ''Peshat'', ''Remez'', ''Drush''===
Within mainstream exoteric classic [[Rabbinic literature]], such as the [[Talmud]] and [[Midrashim]], [[Halacha]] is Jewish legal discussion and ruling, while [[Aggadah]] is Jewish theological/narrative discussion. As two approaches in exoteric Judaism, so ''Peshat-Simple'', ''Remez-Hinted'' and ''Drush-Homiletic'' exegeses methods, which work exoterically, can be used in either Halachic or Aggadic contexts.

==Examples==

===Peshat===
(Gen. 1,2) And the earth was empty (tohu) and formless (bohu).&lt;br /&gt;
[[Rashi]] - The Hebrew word 'tohu' means astonishment in English and the word 'bohu' means emptiness and next to emptiness. Thus the phrase is 'amazement and desolation'. This means that a person would be amazed and astonished at anything that was there.

===Remez===
'''Aggadic example:'''
&lt;br /&gt;There is a traditional Rabbinic passage describing spiritual history that relates the 6 days of Creation to the 6000 years the World will exist, and the Sabbath to the 7th Millennium Messianic Era. The first 2000 years of Creation from Adam, through Noah and the Tower of Babel, to Abraham were 2000 years when God was hidden. The next 2000 years from the Israelite Patriarchs, through the Giving of the Torah at Sinai, to the 1st and 2nd Jewish Commonwealths and Temples in Jerusalem, were 2000 years of Divine revelation. The final 2000 years of preparation when the [[Jewish Messiah]] is waited for, are 2000 years balanced between Divine concealment and revelation.

A Remez-allusion to this is found in the first verse of the Torah:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"''In the beginning God created the Heavens and the Earth''"&lt;br /&gt;בראשית ברא אלהים את השמים ואת הארץ.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Of these 7 words, only ''Hashamayim-Heavens'' has no letter א [[Aleph]], the first letter of the [[Hebrew alphabet]], numerical value of 1 ([[gematria]]). Aleph, hints at its etymological variants "Aluph" (Chief/Ruler) and "Eleph" (One Thousand), the first representing the 1 God, the second representing 1,000 years. Hebrew root words are generally made from three consonant letters, as vowels are read in pronunciation instead. Hebrew reads from right to left. Of the 6 words with Aleph in them in the verse: in the first 2 Aleph is positioned as third letter (concealed God in the first 2,000 years), in the next 2 Aleph is positioned as first letter (revealed God in the middle 2,000 years), in the last 2 Aleph is positioned as second letter (balance between concealed and revealed God in the last 2,000 years).

This is a Remez-allusion exegesis, but gains further meaning in [[Kabbalah]] Jewish mysticism (Sod-Secret exegesis) by the Kabbalistic doctrine that Creation was ennacted through the Hebrew letters of the Torah.

'''Halachic example:'''
&lt;br /&gt;(gemara makkos 2b) Q. A hint that the law of conspiring witnesses is in the Torah, where is it? &lt;br /&gt;
A. There is no such hint, because it is stated explicitly (Deut 19:19) You do to them what they conspired to do to the accused.

Q. But a hint that conspiring witnesses receive a whipping [if they cannot be punished by doing to them as they conspired] according to the Torah, where is it? &lt;br /&gt;
A. As it says (Deut 25:1–2) They caused the righteous to be righteous and the evil to be evil. And therefore the evil get whipped.

Q. Because they caused the righteous to be righteous and the evil to be evil. And therefore the evil get whipped? &lt;br /&gt;
A. But there must have been witnesses who testified that the righteous were evil. And other witnesses came and caused the righteous to be known as righteous as they were before, and caused the previous witnesses to be known as evil. And therefore the evil get whipped.

===Derash (Midrash)===
(gemara makkos 23b) Rabbi Simlai deduced that there were 613 [[mitzvot]] taught to Moses at Mount Sinai. The verse says that (Deut 33,4) Torah was given to us through Moses at Sinai. The [[gematria]] of Torah is 611. And one should add to them the first two of the [[Ten Commandments]] that were given directly by God to the Jews [this is known because they are written in the first person singular], making the total 613.

===Sod===
'''Maimonides:'''
&lt;br /&gt;In his ''[[Guide for the Perplexed]]'', [[Maimonides]] wrote the most important book of Medieval [[Jewish philosophy]]. In it he declares his intention to conceal from the average reader his explanations of ''Sod'' &lt;ref&gt;Within [the Torah] there is also another part which is called ‘hidden’ (mutsnaʿ), and this [concerns] the secrets (sodot) which the human intellect cannot attain, like the meanings of the statutes (ḥukim) and other hidden secrets. They can neither be attained through the intellect nor through sheer volition, but they are revealed before Him who created [the Torah] (Rabbi [[Abraham ben Asher]], ''The Or ha-Sekhel'')&lt;/ref&gt; esoteric meanings of Torah. Religious Jewish Rationalists read Maimonides' Aristotelianism as a mutually-exclusive alternative metaphysics to [[Kabbalah]],&lt;ref&gt;Such as the first (religious) criticism of Kabbalah, ''Ari Nohem'', by [[Leon Modena]] from 1639. In it, Modena urges a return to Maimonidean Aristotelianism. ''The Scandal of Kabbalah: Leon Modena, Jewish Mysticism, Early Modern Venice'', Yaacob Dweck, Princeton University Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; as does the mainstream academic view on Maimonides. According to this, Medieval Jewish Rationalists and their [[Dor Daim|heirs]] today hold that only [[philosophy]] can extend the human capacity as much as possible to understand Divine secrets, rather than a revealed theosophy like Kabbalah. Some academics hold that Maimonides' project fought against the Proto-Kabbalah of his time.&lt;ref&gt;Menachem Kellner, ''Maimonides' Confrontation With Mysticism'', Littman Library, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Kabbalists and their heirs, however, read Maimonides according to Kabbalah or as an actual covert subscriber to Kabbalah.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/107784/jewish/Philosopher-and-Mystic.htm Maimonides: Philosopher and Mystic] from ''Chabad.org''&lt;/ref&gt; According to this, he employed rationalism to defend Judaism rather than limit enquirey of ''Sod'' only to rationalism. His rationalism, if not taken as an opposition,&lt;ref&gt;Contemporary academic views in the study of Jewish mysticism, hold that 12-13th century Kabbalists wrote down and systemised their transmitted oral doctrines in oppositional response to Maimonidean rationalism. See e.g. Moshe Idel, ''Kabbalah: New Perspectives''&lt;/ref&gt; also assisted the Kabbalists, purifying their transmitted teaching from mistaken [[Anthropomorphism in Kabbalah|corporeal]] interpretations that could have been made from [[Heichalot|earlier Jewish mysticism]],&lt;ref&gt;The first comprehensive systemiser of Kabbalah, [[Moshe Cordovero]], for example, was influenced by Maimonides. One example is his instruction to undercut any conception of a Kabbalistic idea after grasping it in the mind. One's intellect runs to God in learning the idea, then returns back in qualified rejection of false spatial/temporal conceptions of the idea's truth, as the human mind can only think in material references. Cited in Louis Jacobs, ''The Jewish Religion: A Companion'', Oxford University Press, 1995, entry on Cordovero&lt;/ref&gt; though Kabbalists held that their theosophy alone allowed human access to Divine mysteries.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Lamm, ''The Religious Thought of Hasidism: Text and Commentary'', Ktav Pub, 1999: Introduction to chapter on Faith/Reason has historical overview of religious reasons for opposition to Jewish philosophy, including the Ontological reason, one Medieval Kabbalist holding that "we begin where they end"&lt;/ref&gt; In this passage, Maimonides mentions Divine secrets within Torah:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Adam and Eve were at first created as one being, having their backs united: they were then separated, and one half was removed and brought before Adam as Eve." Note how clearly it has been stated that Adam and Eve were two in some respects, and yet they remained one, according to the words, "Bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh" (Gen. ii. 23). The unity of the two is proved by the fact that both have the same name, for she is called ishah (woman), because she was taken out of ish (man), also by the words, "And shall cleave unto his wife, and they shall be one flesh" (ii. 24). How great is the ignorance of those who do not see that all this necessarily includes some [other] idea [besides the literal meaning of the words].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Guide for the Perplexed]]'', book 2 section 30&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Kabbalah:'''
{{quote|My beloved came down to His garden&lt;ref&gt;''[[Tikkun Chatzot]]''&lt;/ref&gt;}}
&lt;br /&gt;Kabbalah does not read Scripture as analogy, but as theosophical symbols of dynamic processes in the Supernal Divinity. According to this, Creation was ennacted through the letters of the [[Hebrew language]], particularly [[Names of God in Judaism|Divine Names]]. The [[Midrash]] describes God "looking into the Torah to Create the World", which Kabbalah extended into a linguistic mysticism. United with the [[Ein Sof|Infinite Divine]], the text of the Torah becomes one long Name of God, or alternatively, God's revealed Being as represented in this World. Kabbalists endeavoured to perceive the unlimited Divinity in the Torah of the [[Tree of life (biblical)|Tree of life]], through the exoteric Torah of the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil|Tree of Knowledge]], the two representing [[Divine transcendence|transcendent]] and [[Divine immanence|immanent]] revelations of God in the [[Sephirot]], uniting [[Tiferet]] ("The Holy One Blessed Be He") and [[Malkuth]] (Feminine [[Shekhinah]]).

The teachings of [[Isaac Luria]], which form the basis of modern esoteric [[Kabbalah]], read the mythological [[Lurianic Kabbalah|doctrine]] of ''[[Tohu and Tikun|Shevirat HaKeilim]]'' ("Shattering of the [[sephirot|vessels]] in God's Persona) from the account of the [[Edomite]] [[List of rulers of Edom|Kings]] of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 36:31 and I [[Books of Chronicles|Chronicles]] 1:43:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"These are the kings who reigned in the land of Edom before there reigned any king over the children of Israel..."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In Kabbalah, based on exoteric [[Midrash]], the [[Patriarchs (Bible)|Hebrew Patriarchs]]: Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, embody the sephirot of ''Chesed-Kindness'', ''Gevurah-Strength'' and ''Tiferet-Beauty''. Kindness and Judgement are polar forces and Beauty harmonises. The imbalances emerged in [[Ishmael]] and [[Esau]], while the harmony fathered the [[12 tribes of Israel]]. Ishmael and Esau are considered the spiritual roots of the Nations, deriving from the initial unrectified spiritual Realm of [[Tohu and Tikun|Tohu]]-Chaos, whose pristine Divine potential was too high to be contained in Existence, shattering its vessels which fell down into exile. The Israelites relate to the lower Realm of [[Tohu and Tikun|Tikun]]-Rectification. The [[Jewish Messianism|Messianic Era]] for all people will embody both advantages of the high lights of Tohu in the rectified vessels of Tikun, when "all Nations will ascend the mountain of God".&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah 2:3&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edom]], the progeny of Esau, corresponds to unrectified [[Gevurah]]-Strength, the waste of which vitalises the [[kelipot]] shells. Gevurah is the [[Tzimtzum|constricting]] force in Creation, allowing independent Existence, but also causing the initial vessels of Tohu to act independently and shatter. The Edomite Kings who reigned before any king in Israel, while also being historical people according to ''Peshat'', in Kabbalah both embody and symbolise the vessels of Tohu that shattered. The verses name eight kings, the breakages in the eight emotional sephirot from Daat to Malchut. Death is the lights-souls reascending and the vessel fragments falling, animated by remnant sparks of light. Of the eighth king, only Genesis says he died, as Malchut remained partially intact. The sparks of holiness animate Creation down to Material Existence. In the highest [[Four Worlds|World]] [[Atziluth]], the general root-sparks number 288, read out by [[gematria]] from [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 1:2–3:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
And the Earth was [[Tohu wa-bohu|chaos and void]] (the World of [[Tohu and Tikun|Tohu]]), with darkness upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God hovered (מרחפת-"''Merachepet''", the sparks animating the fragments [[Ohr|externally]]) over the face of the waters. And God said, Let there be light..(the World of [[Tohu and Tikun|Tikun]], allowing stable reception of Divine revelation)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
"''Merachepet''" divides into 288 (רפח) sparks animating within the מת-"dead"-fallen fragments.

==Pardes exegesis and essence==
In a discourse [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]], the Lubavitch Rebbe, asks where [[Hasidic thought]] fits in with Pardes exegesis.&lt;ref&gt;''On the Essence of Chasidus: A Chasidic Discourse by Rabbi Menachem M Schneerson, the Lubavitcher Rebbe'', Kehot publications, reissued 2003. This is a bi-lingual translation of the original Hebrew [[Maamarim (Chabad)|Maamar]] ''Inyana Shel Toras HaHasidus-The Concept of the Torah of Hasidism'', originally delivered orally in 1965, then edited by the Rebbe with footnotes&lt;/ref&gt; [[Habad]] is the intellectualist school in [[Hasidic Judaism]], translating the mystical faith of General-Hasidism and the movement's [[Baal Shem Tov|founder]] into intellectual articulation. The works of the last Habad leader focus on uniting the different aspects of traditional Jewish thought, exoteric and esoteric, through the Hasidic explanation. The four levels of Pardes in [[Kabbalah]] articulate the [[Four Worlds|Four spiritual Worlds]] and the four [[Kochos hanefesh|soul levels]] in Action, Emotion, Understanding and Wisdom. In the discourse he describes General-Hasidism relating through faith to the [[Atzmus|essence]] of the soul, the Torah, and God (Hasidic focus on Divine [[Panentheism|Omnipresence]] perceived by the soul's essence). In esoteric Kabbalistic terminology this relates to the fifth (highest) primary World of [[Adam Kadmon]], and the above-conscious fifth (highest) soul level of Will (internal aspect: soul-root "Delight"), called in Kabbalah "Yehida-Unity". He describes Habad thought articulating in intellectual grasp the essence-fifth level of Torah exegesis, ''Hasidut-Yehida'' not listed above the four levels of PaRDeS because as essence it is not limited to a particular form. ''Peshat'', ''Remez'', ''Drush'' and ''Sod'' are constrained by their limited disciplines: from ''Peshat'' describing material perception to ''Sod-Kabbalah'' limited to the esoteric supernal emanations of God. As essence, Hasidic thought, investigated intellectually in Habad, both transcends all four levels of Pardes in its own exegetical explanation, and permeates within the four. ''Yechida-Essence'' is revealed through the four levels of Pardes, but not constrained by them. The particular exegeses of PaRDeS become connected together in light of the Hasidic exegesis. In this way, the discourse describes Kabbalah, which gains psychological understanding through Hasidism, being actually a limited esoteric commentary on Hasidism's ''Yehida-Essence''. Kabbalah remains transcendent, while Hasidic thought emphasises action, as the [[Atzmut]] essence of God receives its only true revelation in the ultimate Material purpose to Creation, the Omnipresent Divinity related to in Hasidic thought.

==Association with paradise==
{{Main|Pardes (legend)}}
The Pardes system is often regarded as mystically linked to the word ''pardes'' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] פָּרְדֵּס), meaning [[orchard]]. "Pardes" is etymologically related to the English word "[[paradise]]", and the [[Quran]]ic Firdaus ([[Arabic language|Arabic]] فِردَوس) among various other forms, in that they all share a common origin in an [[Old Iranian]] root, attested in the [[Avestan language]] as ''pairi.daêza-''.&lt;ref name="New Oxford"&gt;''New Oxford American Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; It occurs only three times in the [[Tanakh]], namely, in [[Song of Songs]] 4:13, [[Ecclesiastes]] 2:5, and [[Nehemiah]] 2:8. In the first of these passages it means "garden"; in the second and third, "park." In the apocalypses and in the [[Talmud]] the word is used of the [[Garden of Eden]] and its heavenly prototype.&lt;ref&gt;Compare references in Weber's ''Jüdische Theologie'', 2d ed., 1897, pp. 344 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; From this usage, comes [[Christianity]]'s denotation of Paradise as the [[Heaven|abode of the blessed]].&lt;ref&gt;Compare [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 23:43; [[Second Epistle to the Corinthians|II Cor]]. 12:4; [[Book of Revelation|Rev]] 2:7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=65&amp;letter=P Paradise] in the ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pardes and modern exegesis==
The Pardes exegesis system flows from traditional belief in the text as Divine revelation; [[Mosaic authorship]] in regard to the [[Torah]], prophetic inspirations in the rest of [[Tanakh]], and belief in [[Oral Torah]] transmission. Modern [[Jewish denominations]] differ over the validity of applying modern historical-critical exegetical methods to Scripture. [[Haredi]] Judaism regards the Oral Torah texts as revelation, and can apply Pardes method to read classic [[Rabbinic literature]]. [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]] is open to historical critical study of Rabbinic literature and some application to the later Biblical canon. Additionally, some Modern Orthodox scholars have looked at [[Biblical Criticism]] on the Torah, incorporating some of its views within traditional belief in Mosaic revelation.&lt;ref&gt;''Modern Scholarship in the Study of Torah: Contributions and Limitations'' (The Orthodox Forum Series), Shalom Carmy editor, Jason Aronson publishers, 1996. Also Rabbi Dr. Nathan Lopes Cardozo study: [http://www.aishdas.org/toratemet/en_cardozo.html On Bible Criticism and Its Counterarguments] 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Non-Orthodox denominations apply critical method throughout, but with different theological conclusions.

Beginning with [[Samuel David Luzzatto]] in the nineteenth century, there has been an approach to understanding the Torah that finds statements in classical [[Jewish commentaries on the Bible]] that would allow acceptance of revelation, and still use [[Lower Criticism]].&lt;ref name=Heschel&gt;[http://www.yctorah.org/component/option,com_docman/task,doc_view/gid,312/ Aggadic Man: The Poetry and Rabbinic Thought of Abraham Joshua Heschel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304023856/http://www.yctorah.org/component/option,com_docman/task,doc_view/gid,312 |date=2016-03-04 }}, Alan Brill, ''Meorot'' Journal - ''A Forum of Modern Orthodox Discourse'' 6:1, 2006. Pages 15–16&lt;/ref&gt; Comments of Rashbam, Ibn Ezra, Ibn Caspi, Judah Ha-Hasid, and Abravenel have been used in this historical-philological form of ''Peshat''.&lt;ref name=Heschel/&gt;

In the 20th Century, the [[Conservative Judaism]] philosopher-theologian [[Abraham Joshua Heschel]], while accepting modern scholarship, saw existentialist revelation and Divine encounter as the foundation of legitimate Bible interpretation. His 1962 masterwork, ''Torah min HaShamayim BeAspaklariya shel HaDorot'' (English: ''Torah from Heaven in the Light of the Generations'') is a study of classical rabbinic theology and [[aggadah]] (spiritual thought), as opposed to [[halakha]] (Jewish law) in revealing the Divinity of [[Torah study]]. It explores the views of the Rabbis in the Talmud, Midrash and among the philosophical and mystical traditions, about the nature of Torah, the revelation of God to mankind, prophecy, and the ways that Jews have used scriptural exegesis to expand and understand these core Jewish texts in a living, fluid spiritual exegesis.&lt;ref&gt;An English translation by Gordon Tucker is titled ''Heavenly Torah: As Refracted Through the Generations''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparisons with other traditions==
The Pardes typology has some similarities to the contemporary Christian [[Allegory in the Middle Ages|fourfold allegorical scheme]]. The great Muslim scholar and Imam, [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]], the last Caliph before the schism of Sunni and Shia expresses in similar fashion that the Quran has four levels of interpretation similar to that of the PaRDeS: “The Book of God has four things: literal expression (‘ibāra), allusion (ishāra), subtleties (laṭā’if), and deepest realities (ḥaqā’iq). The literal expression is for the common folk (‘awāmm), the allusion is for the elite (khawāṣṣ), the subtleties are for the friends of God (awliyā’), and the deepest realities are for the prophets (anbiyā’)." &lt;ref&gt;From ''Spiritual Gems: The Mystical Qur’an Commentary'' ascribed to Ja’far al-Sadiq as contained in Sulami’s ''Haqa’iq al-Tafsir'' (Louisville: Fons Vitae, 2011), trans. Farhana Mayer, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paul Laffoley''' (August 14, 1935 – November 16, 2015) was an American [[visionary artist]] and [[architect]] from [[Boston, Massachusetts]], represented by [[Kent Fine Art]] in New York.

==Biography==

Paul Laffoley, as one of America's foremost visionary artists, seemed to work in a perpetual present tense (there is no "late" or "old age" style for him). From a young age, spiritual productivity was measured by how deeply one's wisdom could be developed, and how broadly one's compassion could exert itself.

Paul Laffoley was born on August 14, 1935 in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], to an [[Irish Catholic]] family.  His father, Paul Laffoley, Sr., the president of the Cambridge Trust Company, was also a [[lawyer]] and taught classes at [[Harvard Business School]]. Although his father had been against him pursuing painting as a career, Laffoley was indoctrinated with his father's religious philosophical beliefs including aspects of Buddhism and Hinduism and what he called "mind-physics". Laffoley senior also instructed Paul that there was "no gravity" which was a source of great humor when Paul was given the assignment to explain in grade school.

Laffoley wrote that his first spoken word was "[[Constantinople]]" at the age of six months. He did not speak again until he was four years old.&lt;ref name="madone"/&gt; He was diagnosed as having Asperger's Syndrome testing both high and low academically.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} According to Laffoley, he attended the progressive Mary Lee Burbank School in [[Belmont, Massachusetts]], where his draftsman's talent was ridiculed by his [[abstract expressionist]] teachers.  After further studies at the Waldorf School, Laffoley would complete undergraduate studies at [[Brown University]], graduating in 1961 with honors in classics, philosophy, and [[art history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paul Laffoley Bio|url=http://kentfineart.net/artists/paul-laffoley|publisher=Kent Fine Arts LLC|accessdate=12 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021031335/http://kentfineart.net/artists/paul-laffoley/|archivedate=21 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As written by Paul in The Phenomenology of Revelation, he was given eight [[electroshock]] treatments after the termination of "about a year of weekly sessions with a psychiatrist, who had treated me for a mild state of catatonia" while at Brown in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lafolley|first=Paul|title="The Dream As The Initiation" from The Phenomenology of Revelation|year=1989|publisher=Kent Fine Arts|location=New York, NY|isbn=1878607057|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, he enrolled at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]], where he studied architecture because it consisted of diagrams that rendered objects in space with accuracy and precision.  He also studied with the sculptor Mirko Basaldella at Harvard's Carpenter Center that he cited was an early influence. After one year, he was summarily grand juried out of the GSD by the faculty for being "overly involved in his work". By chance, Laffoley was given an issue of Progressive Architecture by his uncle with Frederick Kiesler on the cover.  Laffoley felt Kiesler work was what he had been searching for, and after writing 17 letters, Laffoley came to New York and succeeded in apprenticing with [[Frederick John Kiesler|Frederick Kiesler]].  While canvasing the art scene in New York, Laffoley would meet [[Andy Warhol]], who offered him a place to sleep at his 87th Street fire station if he would report on late night television between 1 and 5 am. It was from watching these Indian Head Test Patterns along with his early exposure to a Hindu tutor that Laffoley would arrive at a format for his large scale paintings that would dominate his work for five decades.

After the death of his father in 1963, Paul would return to Boston from New York, and eventually established his first dedicated studio space at 36 Bromfield Street on Christmas Day, 1968.  It was there that Paul's career would begin to "connect" with an early show at the Orson Welles Theater that was "highjacked" and taken to the Woodstock Music Festival for presentation by Dean Gitter without Paul's permission.  In an effort to recover his work, Paul took the bus to Woodstock which lead to his exposure to the current countercultures of the day, and would be followed by numerous exhibition opportunities and curatorial projects that would lead to the creation of his Boston Visionary Cell (1971).  The Boston Visionary Cell, which Paul Laffoley founded on the model of an artists’ guild, was a highly communal and curatorial undertaking.  The charter of the Boston Visionary Cell underscores Laffoley’s thought processes “to develop and advance visionary art”.

By the late 1980s, Laffoley began to move from the spiritual and the intellectual, and evolved to the view of his work as an interactive, physically engaging [[psychotronics|psychotronic]] device, perhaps similar to architectural monuments such as [[Stonehenge]] or the Cathedral of Notre Dame and their spiritual aura.  Works such as Thanaton III (1989), The Orgone Motor (1983), and the Geochronmechane: The Time Machine from Earth (1990) would follow this concept.

After the destruction of the World Trade Center towers on [[September 11, 2001]], Laffoley was one of a number of architects who, in 2002, submitted designs for the competition to plan the [[One World Trade Center|Freedom Tower]]. Laffoley took his inspiration from the work of [[Catalonia|Catalan]] architect [[Antoni Gaudí]]. His conception was to plan a gigantic hotel in the style of Gaudí's [[Sagrada Família]] church in [[Barcelona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Collins|first=Glenn|title=Postmodern, In a Manner Of Speaking; A Shape Out of 1908 Is Offered Downtown|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/21/nyregion/postmodern-in-a-manner-of-speaking-a-shape-out-of-1908-is-offered-downtown.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|accessdate=13 October 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=January 21, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="madone"&gt;{{cite web|last=Larroque|first=Jean-Pierre|title=The Mad One|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmBuzdLUFsc|publisher=Doublethink Productions|accessdate=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Austin Museum of Art organized a traveling survey of his career in 1999, Mr. Laffoley became something of a cult figure for curators around the world. The Palais de Tokyo in Paris devoted an entire room to his work in its 2009 exhibition "Chasing Napoleon", and several of his works were included in "The Alternative Guide to the Universe" at the Hayward Gallery in London in 2013. Other major shows include Premonitions of the Bauharoque at the Henry Art Gallery, Seattle (publication), Secret Garden at the Hamburger Bahnhof, Berlin (publication) and the recent monograph entitled ''The Essential Paul Laffoley'' edited by Douglas Walla and published by the University of Chicago Press in Spring 2016.

==About==
Following his formal education in the classics at Brown and architectural studies at [[Harvard]], Laffoley would begin to assimilate and systematically cross-pollinate his related strands of intellectual inquiry.  In a search for expanded opportunities, he went to New York in 1963 to work with the visionary artist and architect [[Frederick Kiesler]], and was also recruited to view late-night TV for [[Andy Warhol]] in exchange for a place to sleep.  Weekdays, Laffoley found employment with [[Emery Roth &amp; Sons]] where he worked on the plans for the yet to be built [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] Towers before being terminated upon his suggestion of bridges joining the two buildings.

At that time, Laffoley had been painting in the basement of his family home in [[Belmont, Massachusetts|Belmont]] on the weekends, completing his first fully mature vision:  The [[Kali-Yuga]]: The End of the Universe at 424826 A.D.  From this point forward, Laffoley began to formulate his unique trans-disciplinary approach to a new discipline combining, [[philosophy]], [[science]], [[architecture]] and spirituality to the practice of painting.  Laffoley first began to organize his ideas in a format related to eastern [[mandalas]], partially inspired by the late night patterns he watched for Warhol on late night television.  This quickly developed into four general subcategories of paintings: [[operating system]]s, [[Psychotronics|psychotronic]] devices, meta-energy, [[time travel]], and [[lucid dream]]ing.  Conceived of as "structured singularities", Laffoley never works in series, but rather approaches each project as a unique schematic.  Working in a solitary lifestyle, each 73 ½ x 73 ½ inch canvas would take up to three years to paint and code.  By the late 1980s, Laffoley began to move from the spiritual and the intellectual, to the view of his work as an interactive, physically engaging psychotronic device, a modern approach to trans-disciplinary enlightenment and its spiritual aura.

From an early age, Laffoley manifested an obsessive interest in [[UFO]]s.  He had seen the movie ''[[The Day the Earth Stood Still]]'' 873 times.  He explains that his obsessive interest in the film derives partly from a fascination with the architecture of the space ship in the film which, early on in his life, was subconscious. While he was still a child he made a vow to become an architect so that he could design flying saucers, although he did not become a registered architect until he was 50 years of age.

==Work==

Painted on large canvases, the majority of Paul Laffoley's paintings combine words and imagery to depict a spiritual architecture of explanation, tackling concepts like dimensionality, time travel through hacking relativity, connecting conceptual threads shared by philosophers through the millennia, and theories about the cosmic origins of mankind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Outsider Art Sourcebook|date=March 2009|publisher=Raw Vision|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0954339326}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Ken|title=The Boston Visionary Cell|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/18/arts/design/paul-laffoley-the-boston-visionary-cell.html?_r=0|accessdate=12 October 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Ken|title=ART IN REVIEW: Paul Laffoley, 'Portaling'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/06/arts/art-in-review-paul-laffoley-portaling.html|accessdate=13 October 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=April 6, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2010,

Laffoley's writings as well as works of art were published in May 2016 by the [[University of Chicago Press]] in a new book entitled ''The Essential Paul Laffoley'' edited and texts by Douglas Walla, with further texts by [[Linda Dalywimple Henderson]], [[Arielle Saiber]] and [[Steven Moskowitz]].

British writer [[Michael Bracewell]], in his collection of essays entitled ''When Surface was Depth'' observed: "If Laffoley's work within the Boston Visionary Cell can be said to have one principal preoccupation - a common denominator of his eclectic scholarship and practice - then that preoccupation would be to understand the process by which one goes from becoming to being." Bracewell has also written that, "The Boston Visionary Cell, as a concretized manifestation of its inhabitant's work and preoccupations, describes the way in which a chaos of data - no less than a chaos of marble - can be sculpted by research to release the perfect forms within it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bracewell|first=Michael|title=when surface was depth|date=July 9, 2002|publisher=Da Capo Press|location=London|isbn=0306811308|pages=346–353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Estate of Paul Laffoley is represented by [[Kent Fine Art]] in New York.

The '''Program on Energy Efficiency in Artisanal Brick Kilns in Latin America to Mitigate Climate Change''' (EELA) is a program of the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) which is implemented by Swiss contact in conjunction with its partners in nine countries in [[Latin America]]. The objective is to mitigate [[climate change]] through the reduction of [[greenhouse gas]] emissions in Latin America and to improve the quality of life of the population in the areas of intervention.

==The problem==
Artisanal brick producers in Latin America use fuel with high environmental impact in [[kiln]]s with low [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]]. Wood, tires and plastics, among other fuels, are used to fire bricks, contributing to air pollution and deforestation as well as increasing the causes of climate change. Despite their contribution to the construction industry and the generation of jobs, artisanal brick producers largely operate informally and are generally excluded from social, environmental and economic public policies.

==The approach==
The EELA program is focused on developing management models for artisanal brick producers, and includes activities that range from the adoption of more efficient production processes that require less fuel and emit less greenhouse gases, to the creation of new products that use less raw materials.

==EELA activities==
:* Innovation through the introduction of technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and are financially viable for artisanal brick producers.
:* Working in coordination with public bodies to incorporate the artisanal brick production sector within the national climate change mitigation agenda.
:* Taking account of lessons learned within the countries, and promoting the exchange of experiences among them.

==Areas of operation==
EELA began its first phase working with 970 artisanal brick producers in seven areas located in San Juan (Argentina), Cochabamba (Bolivia), Serido (Brazil), Nemocon (Colombia), Cuenca (Ecuador), Leon (Mexico) and Cusco (Peru). In 2012, Nicaragua and Honduras joined the initiative. The experience gained in the pilot areas will serve as a basis to expand EELA’s intervention at a national level.

==Aims==
EELA hopes to reduce the GHG emissions of artisanal brick producers in the countries of operation by 30% and increase their income by 10%.

==Artisanal brick producers in San Jeronimo, Cusco, Peru==
In conjunction with the Ministry of Production, the Regional Directorate of Production and the Municipality of San Jeronimo, EELA works to promote good manufacturing practices to better employ heat as well as provide technical assistance in the following areas:
:* Mixers designed to optimize time and resources
:* Extrusion machinery to use less raw materials and diversify production
:* Fans to make kiln combustion more effective

EELA constructed a downdraft kiln that is more efficient than a traditional kiln and that is affordable for an artisanal brick producer. The kiln is being replicated by brick producers in San Jerónimo, Cuenca (Ecuador) and in Mexico.

==Challenges==
In a second phase, EELA will seek to improve the management models through the use of knowledge gained from its first phase. 
&lt;!--THIS NEXT SECTION IS IMPOSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND AND CERTAINLY NOT A STYLE OF WRITING THAT IS OK IN WIKIPEDIA. SO PLEASE REWRITE IN PLAIN ENGLISH (OR DELETE!)!!.......
==EELA as a facilitator== 
The development of a market approach will be used as a strategy to incorporate artisanal brick producers in a comprehensive system and determine how to generate effective and large-scale changes on the basis of the identification of market barriers and stakeholder incentives.

EELA will try to ensure the future sustainability of its activities by adopting a facilitating role that will seek to influence the market and articulate its different stakeholders without becoming one of them. Within this context, EELA will foster the creation of conditions that will allow the artisanal brick producer access to different technological innovations while considering the dynamics of the market itself.--&gt;

==Joint effort==
EELA is supported by a group of partners that includes both public and private entities with experience in the brick sector, in each of the countries in which it operates.

Renewable energy technology has sometimes been seen as a costly luxury item by critics, and affordable only in the affluent developed world. This erroneous view has persisted for many years, but 2015 was the first year when investment in non-hydro renewables, was higher in developing countries, with $156 billion invested, mainly in China, India, and Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;FS-UNEP Collaborating Centre, [http://fs-unep-centre.org/sites/default/files/publications/globaltrendsinrenewableenergyinvestment2016lowres_0.pdf Global trends in renewable energy investment], 2016 p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most developing countries have abundant [[renewable energy]] resources, including [[solar energy]], [[wind power]], [[geothermal energy]], and [[biomass]], as well as the ability to manufacture the relatively labor-intensive systems that harness these. By developing such energy sources developing countries can reduce their dependence on oil and natural gas, creating energy portfolios that are less vulnerable to price rises. In many circumstances, these investments can be less expensive than fossil fuel energy systems.&lt;ref name=mdg&gt;[http://www.worldwatch.org/system/files/ren21-1.pdf Energy for Development: The Potential Role of Renewable Energy in Meeting the Millennium Development Goals] pp. 7-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In isolated rural areas, [[electricity grid]] extensions are often not economical. Off‐grid renewable technologies provide a sustainable and cost‐effective alternative to the [[diesel generator]]s that would be otherwise be deployed in such areas. Renewable technologies can also help to displace other unsustainable energy sources such as [[kerosene lamp]]s and [[biomass|traditional biomass]].&lt;ref name=reeee/&gt;

[[Kenya]] is the world leader in the number of [[solar power]] systems installed per capita (but not the number of watts added). More than 30,000 small [[solar panel]]s, each producing 12 to 30 watts, are sold in Kenya annually. Kenya was the first African country to use [[geothermal power in Kenya|geothermal power]], and still has the largest installed capacity of geothermal power in Africa at 200 MW, with a potential of up to 10 GW.&lt;ref name="en.ccchina.gov.cn"&gt;http://en.ccchina.gov.cn/Detail.aspx?newsId=38323&amp;TId=97&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale for renewable energy==
In 2009, about 1.4 billion of people in the world lived without electricity, and 2.7 billion relied on wood, charcoal, and dung for home energy requirements. This lack of access to modern energy technology limits income generation, blunts efforts to escape poverty, affects people's health, and contributes to global deforestation and climate change. Small-scale renewable energy technologies and [[distributed energy]] options, such as onsite solar power and improved cookstoves, offer rural households
modern energy services.&lt;ref name=verlaw&gt;{{cite web |ssrn=2198045 |title=Deploying Off-Grid Technology to Eradicate Energy Poverty |author=Sovacool, Benjamin K., |date=5 October 2012 |work=Science (vol. 338, 47-48)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Renewable energy can be particularly suitable for developing countries. In rural and remote areas, transmission and distribution of energy generated from [[fossil fuels]] can be difficult and expensive. Producing renewable energy locally can offer a viable alternative.&lt;ref name=aus&gt;[http://www.ausaid.gov.au/publications/pdf/renewable_energy.pdf Power for the People] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330120425/http://www.ausaid.gov.au/publications/pdf/renewable_energy.pdf |date=2012-03-30 }} p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Renewable energy doesn't always have to come from a developing country. The Developing Areas Study Group session is a group of speakers from all over the energy businesses discusses the potential ideas to get developing countries the renewable energy that they need. Papers written by W. Morgan, R. Moss and P. Richard discuss the opportunities of renewable resources that lie within the developing country as well. Morgan and Richard claim firewood and agriculture could play a great role in an alternative energy solution in developing countries, while Richards claims that efficient use of agriculture could lead to renewable energy. Morgan also points out that green plants could play a great role in producing synthetic fuel alcohol, which would not only impact the developing country but the world as a whole in providing an alternative fuel source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor= 20001554 |title= Energy in Developing Countries |last= McDonald |first= Paul |date= 1980 |journal= Area |accessdate= |doi= |pmid= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interest in renewable energies has increased in recent years due to environmental concern about [[global warming]] and [[air pollution]], reduced costs of the technologies themselves, and improved efficiency and reliability.&lt;ref name=aus/&gt; In recent years, supportive programs from governments, businesses, nonprofit organizations, and community cooperatives have expanded access to these off-grid technologies and the energy services they provide. Program planners should select “low-hanging fruit” first, aiming for maximum access to modern energy services with the least effort.&lt;ref name=verlaw/&gt;

==Use of renewables==
Collectively, developing countries have more than half of global renewable power capacity. China and India are rapidly expanding markets for renewable energy. Brazil produces most of the world’s sugar-derived ethanol and has been adding new biomass and wind power plants. Many renewable markets are growing at rapid rates in countries such as Argentina, Costa Rica, Egypt, Indonesia, Kenya, Tanzania, Thailand, Tunisia, and Uruguay.&lt;ref name=ren9&gt;[[REN21]] (2010). [http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/REN21_GSR_2010_full.pdf Renewables 2010 Global Status Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820221548/http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/REN21_GSR_2010_full.pdf |date=2010-08-20 }} p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In isolated rural areas, electricity grid extensions are often not economical. Off‐grid renewable technologies provide a sustainable and cost‐effective alternative to the diesel generators that would be otherwise be deployed in such areas. Renewable technologies can also help to displace other unsustainable energy sources such as kerosene lamps and traditional biomass.&lt;ref name="reeee"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/Renew_Policies.pdf |title=Renewable Energy |author=IEA |year=2011 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology advances are opening up a huge new market for solar power: the approximately 1.3 billion people around the world who don't have access to grid electricity. Even though they are typically very poor, these people have to pay far more for lighting than people in rich countries because they use inefficient kerosene lamps. Solar power costs half as much as lighting with kerosene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.technologyreview.com/energy/39544/?p1=MstCom |title=In the Developing World, Solar is Cheaper than Fossil Fuels |author= Kevin Bullis |date= January 27, 2012 |work= Technology Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 3 million households get power from small solar PV systems.&lt;ref name=re10&gt;REN21 (2010). [http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/REN21_GSR_2010_full.pdf Renewables 2010 Global Status Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820221548/http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/REN21_GSR_2010_full.pdf |date=2010-08-20 }} p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Kenya is the world leader in the number of solar power systems installed per capita. More than 30,000 very small solar panels, each producing 12 to 30 watts, are sold in Kenya annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rael.berkeley.edu/files/2006/Kammen-SciAm-Renewables-9-06.pdf |title=The Rise of Renewable Energy |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Micro-hydro systems configured into village-scale or county-scale mini-grids serve many areas. More than 30 million rural households get lighting and cooking from biogas made in household-scale systems. These stoves are being manufactured in factories and workshops worldwide, and more than 160 million households now use them.&lt;ref name = re10/&gt;

===Poverty alleviation===
{{See also|Energy poverty}}
Renewable energy projects in many developing countries have demonstrated that renewable energy can directly contribute to [[poverty alleviation]] by providing the energy needed for creating businesses and employment. Renewable energy technologies can also make indirect contributions to alleviating poverty by providing energy for cooking, space heating, and lighting.&lt;ref name=mdg/&gt;

===Education===
Renewable energy can also contribute to education, by providing electricity to schools. Renewable energy for cooking and heating can reduce the time that children spend out of school collecting fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ashdenawards.org/winners/grameen08 |title=Grameen Shakti installs efficient stoves as well as solar home systems |author=Ashden Awards |accessdate=2008-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===
2.4 billion people use only traditional biomass, such as wood, residues and dung, for cooking and heating. The constant use of these types of energy sources exposes them to indoor particulate and carbon monoxide concentrations many times higher than [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) standards. "Traditional stoves using dung and charcoal emit large amounts of carbon monoxide and other noxious gases. Women and children suffer most, because they are exposed for the longest periods of time. Acute respiratory illnesses affect as much as 6% of the world population. The WHO estimates that 2.5 million women and young children in developing countries die prematurely each year from breathing the fumes from indoor biomass stoves".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull442/44204002429.pdf|title=IAEA BULLETIN, 44/2/2002|pages=28, 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Renewable energy can improve this situation by reducing exposure to indoor pollutants.

Furthermore, renewable can also provide energy to refrigerate medicine and sterilize medical equipment in rural areas where the access to electricity is difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ashdenawards.org/winners/kxn |title=PV-powered vaccine fridges |author=Ashden Awards |accessdate=2008-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also provide power to supply the fresh water and sewerage services needed to reduce the spread of infectious diseases.&lt;ref name=mdg/&gt;

==Government policies==
{{Further|Renewable energy policy}}
More developing countries are implementing the public policies needed for the widespread development of renewable energy technologies and markets, which have traditionally been dominated by Europe, Japan, and North America. The exceptions include countries like Brazil, which has built the world’s leading [[biofuel]]s industry, [[Renewable energy in China|China]], India, which are leaders in developing decentralized renewable sources such as [[small hydro]], small wind, biogas, and solar water heating.&lt;ref name=mdg/&gt;
However, policies like [[feed-in tariff]] are applied. Besides, with the [[Kyoto Protocol]], the program called the [[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM) that allows for industrialized nations to invest in projects that reduce emissions in developing countries as an alternative to more expensive emission reductions in their own countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unfccc.int/cooperation_and_support/financial_mechanism/adaptation_fund/items/3659.php Adaptation Fund]&lt;/ref&gt;

Developing-country Governments need to steer resources mobilized for large-scale investments into new production sectors and new technologies. Some argue that policies should base on active industrial policies, combining large scale investments and active policy interventions. There is a need of subsidizing these type of energy services to make them affordable to the major part of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/esa/desa/desalert/2009/WESS_overview_en.pdf|title=World Economic and Social Survey 2009 Promoting Development, Saving, 2009, the Planet|pages=4, 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Renewable Energy in the Philippines}}
[[File:Bangui Wind Mills.JPG|thumb|[[Bangui Wind Farm]] in [[Ilocos Norte]], [[Philippines]]]] The [[Philippines|Philippine]] government sees the growth of the renewable energy sector essential for national energy security. The Philippines' fossil fuel sector is unsustainable, being dependent on the import of nonrenewable fuel, including petroleum, but has significant potential in the renewable energy sector. Based on a report of an Australian consulting firm, International Energy Consultants, the Philippines has the highest electricity rate in Asia, followed by [[Japan]]. Transmitting power and transporting fuel throughout the Philippine archipelago is problematic due to very high cost.&lt;ref name=manila.b&gt;http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/325264/the-right-mix-the-philippines-achieving-its-renewable-energy-goals&lt;/ref&gt;

The Philippines could be considered a world leader in renewable energy, with its 30 percent of its power generation being powered by the renewable energy sector. the Philippines is the world's second largest generator of geothermal energy and was the first [[Southeast Asia]]n nation to invest in large-scale solar and wind technologies.&lt;ref name=manila.b /&gt;

Promotion and support of renewable energy in the country was intensified with the passing of the Renewable Energy Act of 2008 which made a feed-in-tariff and a renewable portfolio standard. The Philippines aims to triple renewable energy supply by 2030.&lt;ref name=manila.b /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/business/06/14/11/philippines-lifts-2030-renewable-energy-target&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently the government has concluded agreements with private developers for extensive projects in Oriental Mindoro with an eventual output of 48 MW, with plans for even larger development in the future.&lt;ref&gt;http://samueldalsanto.com/2012/04/14/samuel-helps-philippines-wind-power-project-get-presidential-approval/&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite government efforts, some investors have criticized the government's lack of firmness in its feed-in-tariff policy, and the solar industry accused the government for hampering its progress in the country.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cleanbiz.asia/story/policy-problems-hamper-philippine-renewables-growth&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 3, 2011, Algeria launched the National Development Programme for new and renewable energy and energy efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portail.cder.dz/spip.php?article937] Adoption of the Algerian program of renewable energy and energy conservation policy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://portail.cder.dz/spip.php?rubrique44] Algerian Development Programme for new and renewable energy and energy efficiency&lt;/ref&gt; The program, which spans the period from 2011 to 2013, aims to produce 22,000 MW of electricity from solar and wind power which 10,000 MW for export.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portail.cder.dz/spip.php?article1155] Algerian Development Programme for new and renewable energy and energy efficiency (List of projects)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kenya====
{{Main|Renewable energy in Kenya}}
In [[Kenya]], the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum&lt;ref&gt;The Ministry of Energy http://www.energy.go.ke/?page_id=2&lt;/ref&gt; is in charge of renewable energy policies. In March 2008, the country adopted the [[feed-in tariff]] policy. In January 2010, the policy was revised to urge private sectors to invest in electricity generation from renewable sources.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.energy.go.ke/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/feed%20in%20tarriffs2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenya was the first African country to use [[geothermal power in Kenya|geothermal power]], and still has the largest installed capacity of geothermal power in Africa at 200 MW, with a potential of up to 10 GW.&lt;ref name="en.ccchina.gov.cn"/&gt; The only other country in Africa utilising geothermal power is [[Ethiopia]].

Kenya is the world leader in the number of solar power systems installed per capita (but not the number of watts added). More than 30,000 small solar panels, each producing 12 to 30 watts, are sold in Kenya annually. For an investment of as little as $100 for the panel and wiring, the PV system can be used to charge a car battery, which can then provide power to run a fluorescent lamp or a small television for a few hours a day. More Kenyans are turning to solar power every year rather than making connections to the country’s electric grid. This is due to the high connectivity costs and the fact that there is an abundance of solar power in Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rael.berkeley.edu/files/2006/Kammen-SciAm-Renewables-9-06.pdf The Rise of Renewable Energy]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Renewable energy]] accounted for more than 85.4% of the domestically produced electricity used in Brazil, according to preliminary data from the 2009 National Energy Balance, conducted by the Energy Research Corporation (EPE).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/articles/2009/12/brazils-wind-power-auction-spurs-more-clean-energy-development.html Renewable energy in Brazil]&lt;/ref&gt; After the oil shocks of the 1970s, Brazil started focusing on developing alternative sources of energy, mainly [[Ethanol fuel in Brazil|sugarcane ethanol]]. Its large sugarcane farms helped. In 1985, 91% of cars produced that year ran on sugarcane ethanol. The success of [[flexible-fuel vehicle]]s, introduced in 2003, together with the mandatory E25 blend throughout the country, have allowed ethanol fuel consumption in the country to achieve a 50% market share of the gasoline-powered fleet by February 2008.&lt;ref name="ANP07_2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://br.invertia.com/noticias/noticia.aspx?idNoticia=200807152306_ABR_77211977|title=ANP: consumo de álcool combustível é 50% maior em 2007|author=Agência Brasil|date=2008-07-15|publisher=Invertia|accessdate=2008-08-09|language=Portuguese|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226014527/http://br.invertia.com/noticias/noticia.aspx?idNoticia=200807152306_ABR_77211977|archivedate=2008-12-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redebrasilatual.com.br/temas/economia/gabrielli-etanol-reduzira-mercado-de-gasolina-a-17-ate-2020 90% of cars produced in Brazil are Flexfuel]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Actroid-DER 01.jpg|right|thumb|200px|An [[Actroid]] manufactured by Kokoro Company Ltd.]]
'''Robot fetishism''' (also '''ASFR''' or '''technosexuality'''&lt;ref name="asfr"&gt;"ASFR", documentary short by filmmaker Allison de Fren, 2004 [http://www.ifilm.com/ifilmdetail/2408202 (streaming video)]&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Sexual fetishism|fetishistic]] attraction to [[humanoid robot]]s; also to people acting like robots or people dressed in robot costumes. A less common fantasy involves transformation into a robot. In these ways it is similar to [[agalmatophilia]], which involves attraction to or transformation into [[statue]]s or [[mannequin]]s.&lt;ref name="asfr" /&gt;

Robot fetishism can be viewed as a form of erotic [[anthropomorphism]].&lt;ref name="asfr" /&gt; When transformation or roleplaying is involved it can be thought of as a form of [[erotic objectification]].&lt;ref name="asfr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="metro"&gt;"Let's mech love", by Lisa Scott, [[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|''Metro daily paper'']], 7 February 2007 [http://www.metro.co.uk/metrosexual/article.html?in_article_id=36440 (web page)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==ASFR==
By its enthusiasts, robot fetishism is more commonly referred to by the initials "ASFR". This initialism stems from the now-defunct [[Usenet]] [[newsgroup]] ''alt.sex.fetish.robots''. Many devotees of this fetish refer to themselves as [[technosexual]],&lt;ref name="metro" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bizarre"&gt;"Acting Like a Sex Machine", by Kate Hodges, [[Bizarre (magazine)|''Bizarre Magazine'']], October 2004&lt;/ref&gt; or as "ASFRians".&lt;ref name="asfr" /&gt; ASFR can be divided into two distinct but sometimes overlapping types of fantasies.&lt;ref name="metro" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bizarre" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ddiss"&gt;"Deviant Desires: Incredibly Strange Sex", by [[Katharine Gates]], Juno Books (October 1999), {{ISBN|1-890451-03-7}} [http://www.deviantdesires.com/map/robots.html (web page)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first of these is simply a desire to have a ready-made [[android (robot)|android]] partner. This partner can be desired for sex, companionship, or any combination of the two. The main distinguishing feature of this fantasy is that the android is a completely artificial construct, often manufactured solely to fulfil the wishes of its owner. This type of fantasy or situation is referred to as "built".&lt;ref name="asfr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bizarre" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sextv"&gt;"Remote Control: Romancing the Robot" (clip only), ''[[SexTV]]'' documentary episode featuring interviews with members of the ASFR community [https://web.archive.org/web/20060716141605/http://www.sextelevision.net/videoplayer/?segmentID=401&amp;n=1 (streaming video)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The second type of fantasy prevalent within ASFR is referred to as "transformation". This involves a human who has been either willingly or unwillingly turned into an android. That person can be either oneself or one's partner, or both. It is usually the process of transformation (through whatever means it is achieved) that is the focus of this fantasy.&lt;ref name="asfr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bizarre" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sextv" /&gt;

Many people in the ASFR community prefer either one or the other.&lt;ref name="metro" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bizarre" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sextv" /&gt; In some cases this preference is very strong, and people can be as equally repelled by one type as they are attracted to the other. In other cases, there is as much appreciation for built as there is for transformation.&lt;ref name="ddiss" /&gt; A recent informal survey of ASFR community members found that two thirds prefer built while the remainder prefer transformation or some combination of both.&lt;ref name="fc"&gt;"Transformation vs. Built Poll", Fembot Central Message Board, Sept. 26, 2006 [http://www.fembotcentral.net/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=4722&amp;sid=6bf74fe352be20c70f2cbfca9f3e49fc (web page)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nova BanzaiBaby01.jpg|left|thumb|200px|An example of ASFR art.]]
The aspects of this fetish that are most appreciated by members of the ASFR community are greatly varied. For some, things like robotic appearance, motion, or sound are important for arousal.&lt;ref name="metro" /&gt; For others, these are not, and a completely lifelike android that appears to be human is desired.&lt;ref name="ddiss" /&gt; This holds true for other aspects, such as [[sentience]] or [[self-awareness]]. The ability of the android to remove parts of its skin or other bodily appendages in order to reveal its circuitry is quite pleasing to some, but distasteful to others.&lt;ref name="ddiss" /&gt; There is a further divide between those who prefer an android to appear human-like and those who would prefer a more mechanical looking robot, i.e. with a metallic surface.

As realistic androids and humanoid robots do not currently exist in a form readily available to the consumer,&lt;ref name="metro" /&gt; this fetish can only be acted upon in a limited number of ways. Primarily this is done through fantasy, involving either [[Masturbation|self stimulation]] or [[sexual roleplaying]] with a partner.&lt;ref name="ddiss" /&gt; ASFR art is therefore important to aid in the reinforcement of imagination.&lt;ref name="asfr" /&gt;

Art with ASFR content includes but is not limited to [[science fiction]] movies, music videos,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOKPuO-XLF4 Electrosexual Fetish (ASFR) Video Directed by Mashyno]&lt;/ref&gt; television shows, novels, short stories, illustrations, [[Digital image editing|manipulated photographs]], songs and even television commercials.&lt;ref name="exotic"&gt;"Wrong Turns Down The Sex-Info-Highway 5.07", by Martine Duplessis, ''Exotic Magazine'', 1996 [http://www.xmag.com/archives/5-07-jan98/sexhiway.html (web page)]&lt;/ref&gt; Such works are sought after by technosexuals since economically viable androids are not yet available. Realistic [[sex doll]]s such as the [[RealDoll]] may provide a way to explore this fetish with existing technology. Recent developments in robotics and [[artificial intelligence]], such as those seen in the [[Actroid]] or [[EveR-1]] may lead to the production of more advanced synthetic partners.&lt;ref name="asfr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="metro" /&gt;

It is also worth noting that some ASFRians do not wish to use synthetic partners at all, and instead would prefer human partners to participate in forms of fantasy play.&lt;ref name="ddiss" /&gt;

'''''Sophia''''' is an academic journal devoted to professional pursuits in [[philosophy, metaphysics]], [[religion]] and moral thinking, founded in 1962 by Max Charlesworth and Graeme de Graaf. From 2001 Sophia was published by [[Ashgate Publishing]] in collaboration with the Australasian Society for Philosophy of Religion and Theology, and Australasian Society for Asian and Comparative Philosophy (University of Melbourne and Deakin University respectively). The journal has since moved to [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] in Dordrecht, with its editorial office split between Melbourne, Australia and both coasts of the United States. The Editors-in-Chief are [[Purushottama Bilimoria]], [[Patrick Hutchings]], and [[Jay Garfield]].

Together with the [[Australasian Journal of Philosophy]], it is one of the most prominent Australasian (meaning, Australia, New Zealand, The Pacific, Singapore, &amp; H K) journals in the areas of philosophy, ethics and religion It prides itself in its rigorously scholarly profile, which is reflected in the international composition of its editorial board and the diverse philosophical traditions in which its contributors work, ranging from analytic, continental, to Asian/cross-cultural, feminist and indigenous concerns.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5252">The '''Survey of English Usage''' was the first research centre in Europe to carry out research with [[Corpus linguistics|corpora]]. The Survey is based in the Department of English Language and Literature at [[University College London]].

== History ==

The Survey of English Usage was founded in 1959 by [[Randolph Quirk|Randolph (now Lord) Quirk]]. Many well-known linguists have spent time doing research at the Survey, including Bas Aarts, Valerie Adams, John Algeo, Dwight Bolinger, Noël Burton-Roberts, [[David Crystal]], Derek Davy, Jan Firbas, [[Sidney Greenbaum]], Liliane Haegeman, Robert Ilson, Ruth Kempson, [[Geoffrey Leech]], Jan Rusiecki, Jan Svartvik, and Joe Taglicht. The current Director is Bas Aarts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=Survey Staff | url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/english-usage/staff/index.htm | publisher=[[University College London]] | accessdate=14 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original '''Survey Corpus''' predated modern computing. It was recorded on reel-to-reel tapes, transcribed on paper, filed in filing cabinets, and indexed on paper cards. Transcriptions were annotated with a detailed [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] and [[Paralanguage|paralinguistic]] annotation developed by Crystal and Quirk (1964).&lt;ref&gt;Crystal, David, and Quirk, Randolph (1964). ''Systems of Prosodic and Paralinguistic Features in English''. The Hague: Mouton.&lt;/ref&gt; Sets of paper cards were manually annotated for grammatical structures and filed, so, for example, all noun phrases could be found in the noun phrase filing cabinet in the Survey. Naturally, corpus searches required a visit to the Survey.

This corpus is now known more widely as the '''London-Lund Corpus''' (LLC), as it was the responsibility of co-workers in Lund, Sweden, to computerise the corpus. Thirty-four of the spoken texts were published in book form as Svartvik and Quirk (1980),&lt;ref&gt;Svartvik, Jan and Quirk, Randolph (1980) (eds.). ''A Corpus of English Conversation'' Lund: CWK Gleerup.&lt;/ref&gt; and the corpus was used as the basis for the famous ''Comprehensive Grammar'' (Quirk ''et al.'' 1985).&lt;ref&gt;Quirk, Randolph, Greenbaum, Sidney, Leech, Geoffrey and Svartvik, Jan (1985). ''A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language'' London: Longman.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current research ==

=== Constructing corpora ===

In 1988 Sidney Greenbaum proposed a new project, '''ICE''', the [[International Corpus of English]]. ICE was to be an international project, carried out at research centres around the world, to compile corpora of English varieties where English was the first or second official language. ICE texts would contain spoken and written English in a balanced sample of one million words per component so that these samples could be compared in a wide varieties of ways. The ICE project continues around the world to the present day.

'''ICE-GB''', the British Component of ICE, was compiled at the Survey. ICE-GB was annotated to a very detailed level, including constructing a full grammatical analysis (parse) for every sentence in the corpus. The first release of ICE-GB took place in 1998. ICE-GB was distributed with software for searching and exploring the [[parsed corpus]] called ICECUP. Release 2 of ICE-GB has now been released and is available on CD.

As well as contrasting varieties of English, many researchers are interested in language development and change over time. A recent project at the Survey undertook the parsing of a large (400,000 word) selection of the spoken part of the LLC in a manner directly comparable with ICE-GB, forming a new, 800,000 word diachronic corpus, called the  Diachronic Corpus of Present-Day Spoken English ('''DCPSE'''). DCPSE has now been released and is available on CD from the Survey.

These two corpora comprise the largest collection of parsed and corrected, orthographically transcribed spoken English language data in the world, with over one million words of spoken English in this form.

=== Exploring corpora ===

[[Treebank|Parsed corpora]] are large databases containing detailed grammatical tree structures. One of the consequences of forming large collections of valuable linguistic data is a pressing need for methods and tools to help researchers and other users make the most of them. So in parallel with the parsing of natural language data, the Survey team have carried out research and development of software tools to help linguists use these corpora. The ICECUP research platform uses an intuitive grammatical query representation called Fuzzy Tree Fragments (FTFs) to search parsed corpora.

=== Linguistic research with corpora ===

As well as distributing corpora and tools to the [[corpus linguistics]] research community, the SEU carries out research into English language. Recent projects include research on the English Noun Phrase, Subordination in Spoken and Written English, and the English Verb Phrase. The Survey also provides support for PhD students who carry out research into English language corpora.

'''Time Unit Box System''' ('''TUBS''') is a simple system for notating events that happen over a period. This system is mostly used for notating [[rhythm]]s in [[music]]. The notation consists of one or more rows of boxes; each box represents a fixed unit of time. Blank boxes indicate that nothing happens during that interval, while a mark in a box indicates that an event occurs at the start of that time interval.

TUBS is most useful for showing relationships between complex rhythms, such as [[polyrhythm]]s, that would be difficult to see in traditional [[musical notation]]. TUBS also has the advantage that non-musicians can interpret it much more easily than musical notation, because of its simplicity.

It was originally used by [[Musicology|musicologists]] Philip Harland and James Koetting to notate polyrhythms in [[African music]]. However, [[Joseon dynasty|Joseon]] composer Bak Yeon(박연)'s invention of similar but unrelated notation ''jeongganbo''(정간보, [https://web.archive.org/web/20060314223120/http://www.koreandb.net/KMusic/Pic/Klp011.jpg image]) to notate [[Korean court music]] dates back to middle of the 15th century.

TUBS notation has been adapted by several people; the most common adaptations use different symbols in the boxes to represent different sounds, for example different ways of hitting a drum or even different musical pitches. In fact, [[Tracker (music software)|tracker]] notation is essentially TUBS rotated by 90 degrees.

== Examples ==
Below is an example in TUBS, followed by a similar representation in traditional music notation.

Below is an example of an adapted TUBS score depicting a percussion pattern for multiple instruments. One benefit with the TUBS system is that it clearly relates WHICH drum is to be struck (as the symbol will be solid, hollow, etc. uniquely for each drum) as opposed to different drums being notated via a different line of the musical staff, which can be more difficult to see. More importantly, the symbol used inside of each Time Unit Box relates how the drum is to be struck (open tone, slap, bass, rim-shot, etc.) which is not as easily conveyed with the musical staff notation.

[[Transparency of media ownership in Europe|Transparency of media ownership]] refers to the public availability of accurate, comprehensive and up-to-date information about media ownership structures to make possible for media authorities and the wider public to ascertain who effectively owns and controls the media. In [[Romania]] transparency of media ownership is addressed directly in the Constitution and is regulated by a media-specific law, namely the Audiovisual Law no. 504, and by national company law. As for constitutional provisions, even if [[Romania]] is among the few European countries that addresses the issue of media transparency directly in the Constitution, it should be said that the focus is on transparency of financial sources and not on ownership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/files/18780552/Craufurd_Smith_Stolte_Transparency_of_Media_Ownership_in_the_EU_24sep2014.pdf Rachel Craufurd and Yolande Stolte, The transparency of media ownership in the European Union and Neighbouring States, Access-Info, Open Society Program on Independent Journalism, September 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, despite the constitutional provisions on the right to impose an obligation on the media to make public their sources of finance, the Parliament has never enacted the applicable legislation which is indeed absent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/files/18780552/Craufurd_Smith_Stolte_Transparency_of_Media_Ownership_in_the_EU_24sep2014.pdf Rachel Craufurd and Yolande Stolte, The transparency of media ownership in the European Union and Neighbouring States, Access-Info, Open Society Program on Independent Journalism, September 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; The Romanian media-specific law requiring the disclosure of media ownership information applies only to the broadcast sector and provides the disclosure to both a public authority, namely the [[National Audiovisual Council]] (CNA) and directly to the public. Finally, also the national company law contains provisions regulating transparency of media ownership. It applies to all media which are registered companies and foresees the obligation to publish all the most relevant information on companies' ownership in the [[Trade Register Company]]. Overall, even though the Romanian legislation in the field of media ownership transparency is fully aligned with the European standards, in practice sufficient information to assess who effectively owns and ultimately controls the media is not always available.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/tmo/12165 Access-Info, Romania TMO Consultation. Retrieved October 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal framework==

===Media-specific law: disclosure to a public authority===

Romanian law on media ownership transparency only covers the broadcast sector and has no similar provision for print media, but, in practice, many Romanian newspapers make public their publishers and owners. The situation is more complicated for online media and blogs where anonymity is very common.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irex.org/sites/default/files/pdf/media-sustainability-index-europe-eurasia-2016-romania.pdf.pdf IREX 2016, Europe &amp; Eurasia Media Sustainability Index 2016: Romania. Retrieved October 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

The relevant law, named [[Audiovisual Law no. 504]], requires the disclosure of all the information necessary to identify the owners of media companies, e.g. name and contact details of the media organisation; name and contact detail of owners; country of domicile of company with an interest; citizenship / residence status of individual with an interest beyond a given threshold. However, the disclosure requirement does not apply to [[beneficial ownership]], which refers to shares of a media company hold on behalf of another person. According to the law, the information must be reported to the [[National Audiovisual Council]], a public regulatory authority under the control of the Parliament. The CNA is the guarantor of the public interest in the audiovisual field.

One of the main problem of the law concerns indirect interest: threshold for disclosing indirect interest, which is 20%, looks too high to provide proper information for assessing media ownership and guaranteeing transparency. Furthermore, getting information on individuals or companies with indirect control or significant interests in a given media company is quite time-consuming and complex as it requires in practice a step-by-step process of checking and cross-referencing of a large number of different records.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/tmo/12165 Access-Info, Romania TMO Consultation. Retrieved October 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to constraints or costs for public access to the information held by the [[National Audiovisual Council]] there are not particularly high costs or time-consuming procedures, even if, in general terms, accessing information held by public institutions often entails several barriers, such as the reluctance of public officials to reveal sensitive information and their resort to broad interpretations of the exceptions to public disclosure of information.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/tmo/12165 Access-Info, Romania TMO Consultation. Retrieved October 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the legal framework provides the disclosure of nearly all the information needed to identify ownership of the broadcast media in Romania. However, the threshold for reporting indirect interest (20%), the difficulties in obtaining information on entities or persons with indirect control and significant interest, abuses and poor implementation, the lack of co-operation between the CNA and other authorities leave room to abuses and insufficient disclosure.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/tmo/12165 Access-Info, Romania TMO Consultation. Retrieved October 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media-specific law: disclosure directly to the public===

According to Article. 48 of Law 504 of 2002, media companies from the audiovisual field must also disclose the information on media ownership directly to the public through their websites. The requirement applies to all kind of information to be disclosed in accordance with the law. In particular, financial information must be updated and disclosed on an annual basis, while the other information must be always available to the public (requirement of the “permanent access” by the public, according to Article 48).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/document/162195917/TMO-Romania Access-Info Europe, Transparency of media ownership – The legal framework: Romania. Retrieved October 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-media specific transparency requirements: company law ===

In addition to the Audiovisual Law, another source of regulation for transparency of media ownership in Romania is [[Corporate law|company law]] which contains non-media specific transparency requirements. The relevant law, which is the Law 31 / 1990 on Trading Companies is applicable to all registered media company owing a licence and forbids owners' anonymity: companies are therefore obliged to publish all the main information on ownership in the [[Trade Register Office]] (TRO) and to communicate changes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/document/162195917/TMO-Romania Access-Info Europe, Transparency of media ownership – The legal framework: Romania. Retrieved October 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; All the constitutive deeds and the modifications are registered in the Trade Registry and published in the Official Journal. The specific information to be disclosed depends on the legal type of the company and might be different for each type of business organisations. However, the mandatory information for all companies are: names, the date and the place of birth, the address and the citizenship of the partners / shareholders (in case of natural persons); the name, the headquarter address and the nationality of the associates (in case of legal persons); the type, name, headquarters address and the company logo; the company’s field of activity; the registered capital, including the contribution of each partner in cash or in kind; the number and the face value of the shares and the number of shares given to each partners; the managers of the company and their rights; the share given to each associate in case of profit and loss; secondary headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/document/162195917/TMO-Romania Access-Info Europe, Transparency of media ownership – The legal framework: Romania. Retrieved October 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

The public can directly access this data by requesting information from the Trade Registry. Also, since the constitutive documents are also published in the Official Journal, the public can consult this information through the institutional website of the Journal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/document/162195917/TMO-Romania Access-Info Europe, Transparency of media ownership – The legal framework: Romania. Retrieved October 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

Even if the law requires the disclosure of all necessary information on ownership, in fact this data have to be reported to various agencies. This might imply, for instance, a complicated step-by-step check process involving request for information from different agencies for each company in the cases of chains of ownership, such as companies owning other companies and the like.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/document/162195917/TMO-Romania Access-Info Europe, Transparency of media ownership – The legal framework: Romania. Retrieved October 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, as there are minimal financial sanctions for failure to report in time, in practice few companies comply with the obligation to update ownership information.

According to some critics, the Trade Register Office only shows the tip of the iceberg since the real owner of the media and who effectively controls them remain hidden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.mirovni-institut.si/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/media-ownership-and-its-impact-on-media-independence-and-pluralism.pdf Manuela Proteasa, 2004, "Romania" in Media ownership and its impact on media independence and pluralism / &amp;#91;editor Brankica Petković&amp;#93;. Ljubljana : Peace Institute, Institute for Contemporary Social and Political Studies. Retrieved October 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, although public, the access to information collected in the Register is not free of charge and can even be prohibitive.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/tmo/12165 Access-Info, Romania TMO Consultation. Retrieved October 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these limits, the TRO remains the main source of data on media ownership in Romania&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.mirovni-institut.si/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/media-ownership-and-its-impact-on-media-independence-and-pluralism.pdf Manuela Proteasa, 2004, "Romania" in Media ownership and its impact on media independence and pluralism / &amp;#91;editor Brankica Petković&amp;#93;. Ljubljana : Peace Institute, Institute for Contemporary Social and Political Studies. Retrieved October 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; and even if the learning process might be time-consuming, especially in the most complex cases of unclear ownership, all in all it is feasible given sufficient time and resources to collect all the needed information, including [[beneficial ownership]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/tmo/12165 Access-Info, Romania TMO Consultation. Retrieved October 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transparency of media ownership in practice==

Despite the fact that Romanian legislation in the field of media ownership transparency is formally aligned with the European standards (both the [[European Commission]] and the [[Council of Europe]] standards are incorporated in the national legal framework), in practice, there are some major problems. Among the main shortcomings there is the absence of the requirement to disclose all the necessary data to establish which are the owners in case of indirect control or having significant interests in the media company. Moreover, at the practical level, the implementation of the law leaves room for abuses and inadequate disclosure. In sum, a set of factors, including the difficulty in ascertain indirect control and significant interest, implementation problems as well as the challenges in accessing public information result in a significant difficulty for the general public in accessing all the key information to establish who effectively owns and ultimately controls a media outlet.

'''University of Khartoum''' (shortened to '''UofK''') ({{lang-ar|جامعة الخرطوم}}) is a multi-campus, co-educational, public [[university]] located in [[Khartoum]]. It is the largest and oldest [[university]] in [[Sudan]]. UofK was founded as [[Gordon Memorial College]] in 1902 and established in 1956 when Sudan gained independence. Since that date, the University of Khartoum has been recognized as a top university and a high-ranked academic institution in [[Sudan]] and [[Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Akec, John A. (14 February 2009) [http://www.sudantribune.com/Why-the-university-education-still,30170 Why the university education still excites Sudanese?] The Sudan Tribune, Comment and Analysis, Retrieved 21 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
 
It features several institutes, academic units and research centers including [[Mycetoma Research Center]], [[Soba University Hospital]], [[Saad Abualila Hospital]], [[Dr. Salma Dialysis centre]], [[Institute of Endemic Diseases]], [[Institute for Studies and Promotion of Animal Exports]], [[Institute of African and Asian Studies]], [[Institute of Prof. Abdalla ElTayeb for Arabic Language]], [[Development Studies and Research Institute]] and [[U of K publishing house]].

== History ==
[[File:Khalda Zahir-bw.jpg|thumb|left|[[Khalida Zahir]], graduated as the first Sudanese female doctor in 1952&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unitykhartoum.blogspot.be/2011/07/khalda-zahir-of-almorada-village-ssa.html|title=The Unity High School Archive|author=Unity High School|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In 1898 after [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] gained dominance in Sudan as part of a [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|condominium]] arrangement, [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] proposed founding a college in the memory of [[Charles George Gordon|Gordon of Khartoum]], who was killed in the [[Battle of Khartoum]]. Gordon Memorial College was founded in 1902 with primary education being its sole program.
 
By 1906, the college was offering programs for training assistant engineers, land surveyors and primary school teachers. The first equipped laboratory for [[bacteriological analysis]] was added in 1905, with donations from [[Henry Wellcome|Sir Henry Wellcome]], an American-British pharmaceutical entrepreneur and archaeologist.

In 1924, the college incorporated programs in [[Sharia]], engineering, education (teachers training), clerical work, accounting and science. The [[Kitchener School of Medicine]], the first medical school in Sudan, was established.

In 1936, the School of Law was established. In 1947, the college was affiliated with [[University of London|The University of London]] as the first overseas participant in its "special relationship" scheme.  The first graduates to receive University of London degrees completed their programs in 1950. The next year, Gordon Memorial College was formally renamed University College Khartoum, which incorporated the Kitchener School of Medicine.

When Sudan gained independence in 1956, the new Parliament passed a bill to award university status to Khartoum University College. It officially became Khartoum University on 24 July 1956. The eminent horticultural scientist [[John Pilkington Hudson]] was a visiting professor in 1961-3, who founded its department of horticulture.&lt;ref&gt;ODNB entry: [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/99289 Retrieved 24 July 2011.]{{paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 April 1984, the Government announced the closure of all faculties of the university. The university was reopened fully on August 1.&lt;ref name="Eds.1986"&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Haim Shaked|editor2=Daniel Dishon|title=Middle East Contemporary Survey, Vol. 8, 1983-84|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t32OO3DkDikC&amp;pg=PA646|year=1986|publisher=The Moshe Dayan Center|isbn=978-965-224-006-4|page=646}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university was closed several times after the 1989 military coup d'état for the intensive participation of its students in pro-democracy rallies.

== Student body ==
The university has 16,800 undergraduate students in 23 faculties, schools and graduate research institutes. The annual admission rate is 3,500 students, 55% of whom are female. There are 6,000 [[graduate students]] (graduate diploma, [[M.Sc.]] and [[Ph.D.]]). It has 850 teaching staff (faculty), 20 research fellows and 500 teaching assistants.

== Campuses ==
There are four campuses:
* The Central Campus in Central Khartoum.
* The Medical Campus located in the South of Central Khartoum.
* The Agriculture and Veterinary Campus  at [[Shambat (city)|Shambat]], [[Khartoum North]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uofk.edu/faculties/veterinary/about/about.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041224090405/http://www.uofk.edu/faculties/veterinary/about/about.htm|title=Faculty of Veterinary Medicine - About|archivedate=24 December 2004|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Faculty of Education Campus at [[Omdurman]] 15&amp;nbsp;km from central campus.
* Suba Campus (Faculty of [[Medical Laboratory Science]], Suba Hospital) at Suba,20&amp;nbsp;km South of Khartoum.
* The management studies campus in central Khartoum.

== Admission ==
Undergraduate admission policy is governed by the [[Board of Higher Education of Sudan]], which sets the minimum admission requirement for high school students based on their national origin (Sudanese vs. non-Sudanese) and the high-school certificate board.

For post-graduate studies, the requirements are on the university admission webpage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uofk.edu/admission/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060213015019/http://www.uofk.edu/admission/index.htm |archivedate=2006-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its development was continued until in 1993 an ordinance was passed for the establishment of the College of Medical Laboratory Sciences an independent institution affiliated to the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research.In 1997, it was merged with the University of Khartoum as the Faculty of Medical Laboratory Sciences (FMLS).
The Faculty of Medical Laboratory Sciences offers preparation for careers in medical (clinical) laboratory sciences. A career in medical laboratory sciences is a great way to combine an aptitude for science with the desire to help others. Medical Laboratory Scientists, also known as clinical laboratory scientists, are highly skilled professionals who perform analytical tests on blood, tissue, and body fluids to provide laboratory information for the detection, diagnosis, and treatment of human diseases. There also is a growing trend for medical lab scientists to perform wellness laboratory testing aimed at preventing disease.

The '''University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies''' ('''UTIAS''', {{IPAc-en|j|uː|ˈ|t|aɪ|ə|s}} {{respell|yoo|TY|əs}}) is an advanced research facility for [[aeronautics]] and [[aerospace engineering]], located in the [[Downsview]] district of [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada. Established in 1949 by founding Director Gordon N. Patterson, the institute is managed by the [[University of Toronto Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering]] and mainly receives funding from governmental agencies such as the [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council]], the [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|Department of National Defence]] and the [[Canadian space agency|Canadian Space Agency]]. Notable international sponsors include the [[European Space Agency]], [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]], [[Max-Planck-Institut für Plasmaphysik]], [[NASA Ames Research Center]] and the [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]].

==History==

In 1970, the institute was involved in the emergency rescue of the [[Apollo 13]] astronauts, after the mission was aborted by a major accident en route to the Moon. UTIAS was contacted for assistance due to its expertise in shockwaves and aerospace dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.utias.utoronto.ca/AssetFactory.aspx?did=220 |title=An Account of UTIAS Involvement in the Rescue of Apollo 13 |last=Sullivan |first=Phil |publisher=University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engineers and scientists at UTIAS calculated the amount of pressure needed to separate the [[Lunar Module]] from the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command/Service Module]] without damaging the hatch, allowing the crew to survive the re-entry to Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.casmuseum.org/common/PDF/pressreleases/CASM_Apollo_13_Release_2010.pdf |title=Canadians celebrate Canada's contribution to the safe return of the Apollo 13 astronauts on 40th anniversary of original space mission |publisher=[[Canadian Air and Space Museum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Observing the 40th anniversary of the incident in 2010, lunar module pilot [[Fred Haise]] wrote a letter thanking the UTIAS team for its contribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aiac.ca/success-stories/utias-bringing-apollo-13-home.aspx |title=UTIAS - Bringing Apollo 13 Home |publisher=Aerospace Industries Association of Canada |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100523072844/http://www.aiac.ca/success-stories/utias-bringing-apollo-13-home.aspx |archivedate=2010-05-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years,{{when|date=October 2013}} the institute has produced the world's first [[microwave]]-powered aircraft, the world's first engine-powered [[ornithopter]] (both inventions of [[James DeLaurier]]), and Canada's first [[space telescope]], [[Microvariability and Oscillations of STars telescope|MOST]].  The major expertise areas represented are [[aerospace engineering|aircraft design]], particularly at [[subsonic flight|subsonic]] speeds, [[flight simulation]], space [[mechatronics]] and [[robotics]], [[Microsatellite (spaceflight)|microsatellite]] technology, [[computational fluid dynamics]] and [[nuclear fusion]]. The institute's partners in the aerospace industry include [[Bombardier Aerospace]], [[MD Robotics]] (formerly [[Spar Aerospace]]) and [[General Atomics]]. It operates the [[Canadian Advanced Nanospace eXperiment Program]] for the study and testing of nanosatellite technology.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

An '''urban refugee''' is a [[refugee]] who decided or was obliged to settle in an [[urban area]] rather than in a [[refugee camp]] in the country or territory where the person fled to. More than 60% of the world's refugee population and 80% of [[internally displaced person]]s (IDP) under [[UNHCR]] mandate live in urban environments.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unhcr.org/urban-refugees.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, their number was around 5.5 million people. "Urban refugee" is not a recognized legal term in the [[Convention relating to the Status of Refugees|1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees]]. However, the UNHCR has adopted a 'Policy on Refugee Protection and Solutions in Urban Areas' in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.refworld.org/docid/4ab8e7f72.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Urban refugees are among the most vulnerable groups in low income countries. According to UNHCR, the urban refugee population worldwide is very diverse, comprising a large number of women, children, and older people who have particular protection challenges. The urban refugee population face specific protecting needs attendant to urban environments: they may lack access to services, health, education and are often confronted to xenophobic attitudes in their country of asylum.

The overwhelming majority of refugees living in urban areas are to be found in the poorest and more conflict-affected regions of the world. Africa and Asia concentrate the highest number of urban refugee populations. Some war-affected countries host a huge number of both urban internally displaced people and refugees in capital cities (such as [[Kampala]] or [[Khartoum]]). Urban refugees also live in the main cities of their country of origin: after protracted exile, many returnees prefer settling back as IDPs in cities and towns of their own country upon return.

Since around 2017, the UNHCR prioritizes urban refugees for [[third country resettlement|resettlement]] over those refugees living in [[refugee camps]]. In Kenya, for example, only refugees living in Nairobi are submitted for resettlement places, and not those refugees living in [[Kakuma]] or [[Dadaab]].

==Reasons for living in urban areas==
Reasons for living in urban settings rather than in refugee camps could be specific medical care needs that can't be provided for in camps, or higher than average educational achievements and aspirations, as camps don't provide much higher education opportunities. There is insufficient physical and material security in some camps. Especially certain groups of refugees, such as [[LGBTI]] refugees and women at high risk of gender-based violence, cannot be sufficienty protected from other refugees in the camps.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fmreview.org/sites/fmr/files/FMRdownloads/en/resettlement.pdf|{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} page 35&lt;/ref&gt; Or it could simply the fact that the state or territory where refugees fled to does not run refugee camps (e.g. Syria or Egypt). Some refugees leave camps in search of better economic opportunities in urban centres and to avoid being dependent on aid rations. Some even move back and forth between urban centres and refugee camps to get the best of both.

A disadvantage is that the UNHCR and other aid agencies cannot legally protect and support refugees dispersed in urban settings as much as in camps.

==Notable urban refugee settlements==
* [[Damascus]], Syria: the majority of a total of around 63,000 Iraqi refugees in Syria&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/iraqi-refugees-in-syria-feel-new-strains-of-war/2013/04/09/4f5cd784-9ee8-11e2-a941-a19bce7af755_story.html&lt;/ref&gt; (also see [[Iraqis in Syria]]). 
* [[Cairo]], Egypt: around 30,000 Sudanese refugees&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fmreview.org/FMRpdfs/FMR27/50.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; (also see [[sudanese refugees in Egypt]]).&lt;!-- as of 2015, Kenyan government requires refugees to reside in camps --&gt;
* [[Cape Town]], South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.state.gov/j/prm/funding/fy2015/240479.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Kathmandu]], Nepal: 500 Rohingya and Sri Lankan refugees as well as [[Ahmadiyyas]] from Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/11/bleak-outlook-nepal-urban-refugees-151123110438884.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Beirut]], Lebanon: 26,000 
* [[Kandahar]] and [[Kabul]], Afghanistan: 55,000 each
* [[Belgrade]], Serbia: 57,542 
* [[Amman]], Jordan:  162,061 
* [[Bangui]], Central African Republic: 496,731

==Examples of usage==
  
The [[marketer]] Matt Bailey described it as "a desire to see something done, but not enough desire to make it happen".&lt;ref name=Bailey&gt;Matt Bailey, "Viral marketing", excerpt "Analytics 1.0 - A Case of Velleity," found at [http://www.sitelogicmarketing.com/blog/07-analytics-velleity Site Logic marketing website].  Accessed April 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In modern writing===

Matt Bailey expressed an attempt "to bring it back, as it has more relevance now than ever."&lt;ref name=Bailey /&gt;  He writes that:
{{quote|Velleity is what keeps companies locked in this mindset of reporting useless numbers. Desiring, even expecting to someday have an epiphany of change, but not willing to change the mindset or the culture of locked-in reporting to achieve it. Nor are they willing to ask the hard questions in order to uncover what must be done.|Matt Bailey, marketing writer&lt;ref name=Bailey /&gt;}}

===In philosophy===

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] describes the velleity of an [[artist]] as a "desire to ''be'' 'what he is able to represent, conceive, and express'...."&lt;ref&gt;
Aaron Ridley, in "Nietzsche, philosophy and the arts," ed. by Salim Kemal, Ivan Gaskell, Daniel W. Conway, at pp. 128-131 (Cambridge University Press, 2002) {{ISBN|0-521-52272-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-52272-4}} (emphasis provided), found at [https://books.google.com/books?id=8GzFg3pH4SIC&amp;pg=PA130&amp;lpg=PA130&amp;dq=Velleity+%2B+philosophy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MljPsygceA&amp;sig=SWt2zXpiLVhU9oBymK3jfNIAKQs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=TrH4SfCODNOGmQeOj-GYDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7#PPA134,M1 Google Book search]. Accessed April 29, 2009.
&lt;/ref&gt;  Nietzsche championed the [[will to power]], which can be encapsulated{{by whom?|date=November 2012}} as starting with velleity, in his [[free-will theorem]].

Keith David Wyma refers frequently to the "concept of velleity", citing [[Thomas Aquinas]] as a pioneer of introducing the idea into philosophy.&lt;ref name=Wyma&gt;
Keith David Wyma, ''Crucible of reason'', pp. 197, 221, 223, 225, 227 (Rowman and Littlefield 2004).  {{ISBN|978-0-7425-3538-1}}.

===In psychology===
{{Main|Volition (psychology)}}
Psychologist Avi Sion writes, "''Many psychological concepts may only be defined and explained with reference to velleity''." (''Emphasis in original''.)&lt;ref name=Sion&gt;Avi Sion, "Volition and allied causal concepts," p. 190 (2004). {{ISBN|978-2-9700091-6-0}}.

Also found at [http://www.thelogician.net/4b_volition/4b_chapter_09.htm The Logician website].  All accessed June 3, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  An example he cites is that "an ordinarily desirable object can only properly be called 'interesting' or 'tempting' to that [[Agency (philosophy)|agent]] at that time, if he manifests some velleity...."&lt;ref name=Sion /&gt;
He distinguishes between the two types of velleity - "''to do'' something and one ''not to do'' something...."&lt;ref name=Sion /&gt;  Furthermore, he asserts, "The concept of velleity is also important because it enables us to understand the co-existence of conflicting values."&lt;ref name=Sion /&gt;  A person could thus have "double velleity" or "a mix of velleity for something and a volition for its opposite: the latter dominates, of course, but that does not erase the fact of velleity."&lt;ref name=Sion /&gt;

Kathy Kolbe also lists velleity as a "key concept of [[conation]]."&lt;ref name=Kolbe&gt;See [http://www.kolbe.com/knol/keyConceptsOfConation.htm Kathy Kolbe's website page on Conation].  Accessed June 3, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Verbum Domini''''' ({{lang-en|The Word of the Lord}}) is a post-synodal [[apostolic exhortation]] issued by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] which deals with how the [[Catholic church]] should approach the [[Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicculture.org/news/headlines/index.cfm?storyid=8243 Catholic Culture : Latest Headlines : Pope Benedict issues major document on Sacred Scripture (link to full text)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He issued it following the XII Ordinary [[General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops]], which had met in October 2008 to discuss "The Word of God in the Life and Mission of the Church."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/synod/index.htm Synod of Bishops - Index&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Verbum Domini'' is dated September 30, 2010, for the [[calendar of saints|Feast]] of [[St. Jerome]], the [[patron saint]] of [[Biblical studies]].

The document use the Prologue of John's Gospel ({{Bibleref|John|1:1-1:18}}) as a guide because it reveals [[Jesus]], the "Word made flesh" who "dwelt among us" ({{Bibleref|John|1:14}}).

Its structure is:

# Introduction
# Part One - Verbum Dei
God seeks dialogue with humankind. At the [[Incarnation_(Christianity)|Incarnation]], the Word became flesh and lived among us.&lt;ref&gt;Verbum Domini § 6&lt;/ref&gt;
# Part Two - Verbum In Ecclesia
# Part Three - Verbum Mundo

Its general theme of the "[[Logos_(Christianity)|Word of God]]" had been dealt with previously in the [[Magisterium]], notably by [[Pope Leo XIII]] in [[Providentissimus Deus]],  by the [[Second Vatican Council]] in its Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation: [[Dei Verbum]], by [[Pope Pius XII]] in [[Divino afflante Spiritu]] and by the 1992 [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]].
