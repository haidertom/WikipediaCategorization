An '''adaptive system''' is a set of interacting or interdependent entities, real or abstract, forming an integrated whole that together are able to respond to environmental changes or changes in the interacting parts, in a way analogous to either continuous physiological [[homeostasis]] or evolutionary [[adaptation]] in [[biology]]. [[Feedback loops]] represent a key feature of adaptive systems, such as [[ecosystems]] and individual [[organisms]]; or in the human world, [[communities]], [[organizations]], and [[families]].

Artificial adaptive systems include [[robots]] with [[control system]]s that utilize [[negative feedback]] to maintain desired states.

==The law of adaptation==

The law of adaptation can be stated informally as: 
{{quote|Every adaptive system converges to a state in which all kind of stimulation ceases.&lt;ref&gt;José Antonio Martín H., Javier de Lope and Darío Maravall: "Adaptation, Anticipation and Rationality in Natural and Artificial Systems: Computational Paradigms Mimicking Nature" Natural Computing, December, 2009. Vol. 8(4), pp. 757-775. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11047-008-9096-6 doi]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Formally, the law can be defined as follows:

Given a system &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, we say that a physical event &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is a stimulus for the system &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; if and only if the probability &lt;math&gt;P(S \rightarrow S'|E)&lt;/math&gt; that the system suffers a change or be perturbed (in its elements or in its processes) when the event &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; occurs is strictly greater than the prior probability that &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; suffers a change independently of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;P(S \rightarrow S'|E)&gt;P(S \rightarrow S') &lt;/math&gt;

''Let &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; be an arbitrary system subject to changes in time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; be an arbitrary event that is a stimulus for the system &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;: we say that &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is an adaptive system if and only if when t tends to infinity &lt;math&gt;(t\rightarrow \infty)&lt;/math&gt; the probability that the system &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; change its behavior &lt;math&gt;(S\rightarrow S')&lt;/math&gt; in a time step &lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt; given the event &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the probability that the system change its behavior independently of the occurrence of the event &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;. In mathematical terms:''

#- &lt;math&gt; P_{t_0}(S\rightarrow S'|E) &gt; P_{t_0}(S\rightarrow S') &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;
#- &lt;math&gt; \lim_{t\rightarrow \infty} P_t(S\rightarrow S' | E) = P_t(S\rightarrow S')&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, for each instant &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; will exist a temporal interval &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; such that:

:&lt;math&gt; P_{t+h}(S\rightarrow S' | E) - P_{t+h}(S\rightarrow S') &lt; P_t(S\rightarrow S' | E) - P_t(S\rightarrow S')&lt;/math&gt;

==Benefit of self-adjusting systems==
In an adaptive system, a parameter changes slowly and has no preferred value.  In a self-adjusting system though, the parameter value “depends on the history of the system dynamics”.  One of the most important qualities of ''self-adjusting systems'' is its “[[edge of chaos|adaptation to the edge of chaos]]” or ability to avoid [[chaos theory|chaos]].  Practically speaking, by heading to the [[edge of chaos]] without going further, a leader may act spontaneously yet without disaster.  A March/April 2009 Complexity article further explains the self-adjusting systems used and the realistic implications.&lt;ref&gt;Hübler, A. &amp; Wotherspoon, T.: "Self-Adjusting Systems Avoid Chaos". Complexity. 14(4), 8 – 11. 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Physicists have shown that [[adaptation]] to the [[edge of chaos]] occurs in almost all systems with [[feedback]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wotherspoon|first1=T.|last2=Hubler|first2=A.|title=Adaptation to the edge of chaos with random-wavelet feedback|journal=J Phys Chem A|doi=10.1021/jp804420g}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practopoiesis==
''Practopoiesis,'' a term due to its originator Danko Nikolić, is a reference to a kind of adaptive or self-adjusting system in which [[autopoiesis]] of an ''organism'' or a ''cell'' occurs through [[allopoiesis|allopoietic]] interactions among its ''components''.&lt;ref name=Nikolic2015&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002251931500106X|title=Practopoiesis: Or how life fosters a mind. |author=Danko Nikolić|date=2015|doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2015.03.003|volume=373|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|pages=40–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; The components are organized into a [[poiesis|poietic]] hierarchy: one component creates another. The theory proposes that living systems exhibit a hierarchy of four such poietic operations in total:

    ''evolution'' (i) &amp;rarr; ''gene expression'' (ii) &amp;rarr; ''non gene-involving homeostatic mechanisms (anapoiesis)'' (iii) &amp;rarr; ''cell function'' (iv)

Practopoiesis challenges current neuroscience doctrine by asserting that mental operations primarily occur at the anapoietic level (iii) &amp;mdash; i.e., that minds emerge from fast homeostatic (adaptive) mechanisms. This contrasts the widespread belief that thinking is synonymous with neural activity ('cell function' at level iv). 

Each lower level contains knowledge that is more general than the higher level; for example, genes contain more general knowledge than anapoietic mechanisms, which in turn contain more general knowledge than cell functions. This hierarchy of knowledge enables the anapoietic level to directly store concepts, which are necessary for the emergence of mind.

Dr '''Ashraf Choudhary''', {{post-nominals|country=NZL|QSO|size=85%}}, (born 15 February 1949) is a [[Pakistani New Zealander|Pakistani-New Zealand]] scientist in [[agricultural engineering]] and formerly a member of the [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliament]] in New Zealand. He is a member of the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]], and was New Zealand's first MP from [[South Asia]] and [[Pakistan]].

==Education==
Choudhary was born in the [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Pakistani half]] of the [[Punjab region]] in village Jajay. He comes from a family of agriculture. He attended high school in the town of [[Sialkot]],&lt;ref name="pildat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pildat.org/eventsdel.asp?detid=65|title=Patience and Persistence required for a stable democracy in Pakistan|date=25 December 2004|publisher=PILDAT|accessdate=7 June 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110615031605/http://www.pildat.org/eventsdel.asp?detid=65| archivedate= 15 June 2011 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then gained a degree in [[agricultural engineering]] from [[University of Agriculture, Faisalabad]] (UAF) in [[Faisalabad]]. He continued his studies abroad, gaining a master's degree in [[agricultural engineering]] at the [[Newcastle University|University of Newcastle upon Tyne]], [[England]] and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in [[agricultural engineering]] at [[Massey University]], New Zealand. By profession, Choudhary was originally an [[environmental scientist]] and taught at the Massey University of New Zealand before his induction into Parliament.&lt;ref name="pildat"/&gt; He has published a large number of scientific papers in his field, and is considered to be an international authority on [[conservation tillage]]. His work has a particular focus on agricultural techniques in developing countries. Choudhary has three children.

==Migrating to New Zealand==
Before entering [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliament]], Choudhary had worked with a number of community organizations, including such groups as the New Zealand Federation of Ethnic Councils and [[FIANZ]] – the Federation of Islamic Associations of New Zealand (of which he was president in 1984–85). In his capacity as president of [[FIANZ]] he oversaw the first annual [[halal]] meat contract with the [[New Zealand Meat Producers Board]] in June 1984, with the aid of [[Mazhar Krasniqi]], Hajji Abdul Rahim Rasheed and Dr. Mohammad Hanif Quazi.

He was awarded a [[British and Commonwealth orders and decorations|QSO]] for his community work in 2001.

==Entrance into New Zealand politics==

}}
{{NZ parlbox footer}}
Having been a supporter of the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] for some time, Choudhary was elected to Parliament as a Labour Party list MP in the [[New Zealand general election, 2002|2002 elections]]. He was sworn in on the [[Qur'an]], something which [[Winston Peters]] (leader of the [[New Zealand First]] party) criticised as a breach of proper procedure. The rules, however, contained no prohibition against it, allowing the taker of the oath to specify any religious text they wished (or, alternatively, use none at all). Because Parliamentary officials did not have a copy of the [[Qur'an]], they obtained a copy from the [[FIANZ]] office, which was then donated to the Parliamentary Library for use in the future.

Since entering [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliament]], Choudhary has served on the Primary Production, Local Government and Environment, and Education and Science select committees. He also came to public attention in 2003, when he abstained in a vote to legalise [[prostitution]]. The Muslim community were upset by his decision to abstain from voting since prostitution is seen as a violation of their faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/content/206420/423466/article.html|title=Muslims upset with MP|date=17 July 2003|work=[[Television New Zealand]]|accessdate=7 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contribution to the Muslim community in New Zealand==
Choudhary once again came to the attention of the Muslim community in December 2004, when he announced his intention to vote in favour of the deeply controversial [[Civil unions in New Zealand|Civil Union]] legislation. Choudhary remarked that "if the law allows one minority group in our society to be discriminated against then all minorities are vulnerable".

In July 2005 Choudhary came to the public's attention again when he refused to condemn outright the practice of [[stoning]] people for homosexual and extramarital sexual behaviour. In TV3's [[60 Minutes (New Zealand)|60 Minutes]] show on 4 July 2005, Dr. Choudhary was asked: "Are you saying the [[Qur'an]] is wrong to recommend that gays in certain circumstances be stoned to death?" He replied: " No, no. Certainly what the Qur'an says is correct." He then qualified his statement, "In those societies, not here in New Zealand".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10334250|title=Some stoning okay says Choudhary|last=Berry|first=Ruth|date=5 July 2005|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|accessdate=7 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement==
On 29 September 2011, Choudhary delivered his valedictory speech in Parliament and would retire from politics after the [[New Zealand general election, 2011|2011 general election]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://parliamenttoday.co.nz/2011/09/valedictory-speeches-sept-29/ Parliament Today – Valedictory Speeches Sept 29, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; Since retiring Choudhary has been active in the Pakistani and Indian community circles of Auckland encouraging youth political involvement and supporting blood donor drives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiannewslink.co.nz/index.php/archives2012/may_15_2012_issue/former-mp-calls-more-youngsters-to-politics.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130213172129/http://www.indiannewslink.co.nz/index.php/archives2012/may_15_2012_issue/former-mp-calls-more-youngsters-to-politics.html |archivedate=13 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiannewslink.co.nz/index.php/archives2012/feb_1_2012_issue/pakistani-blood-donors-do-us-proud.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130222203844/http://www.indiannewslink.co.nz/index.php/archives2012/feb_1_2012_issue/pakistani-blood-donors-do-us-proud.html |archivedate=22 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Auckland local elections, 2016|2016 Auckland elections]], Choudhary was elected to the Otara-Papatoetoe Local Board and Counties Manukau District Health Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/EN/AboutCouncil/HowCouncilWorks/Elections/Documents/Confirmedlocalelectionresults2016.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-10-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019000339/http://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/EN/AboutCouncil/HowCouncilWorks/Elections/Documents/Confirmedlocalelectionresults2016.pdf |archivedate=19 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/EN/AboutCouncil/HowCouncilWorks/Elections/Documents/aucklanddhb2016.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-10-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019014606/http://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/EN/AboutCouncil/HowCouncilWorks/Elections/Documents/aucklanddhb2016.pdf |archivedate=19 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10980">[[File:Trounce Pond.jpg|thumb|right|A [[retention pond]] for treatment of [[urban runoff]] (stormwater).]]
'''Best management practices''' ('''BMPs''') is a term used in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] to describe a type of [[water pollution]] control.  Historically the term has referred to auxiliary pollution controls in the fields of [[industrial wastewater treatment|industrial wastewater]] control and [[sewage treatment| municipal sewage]] control, while in [[stormwater]] management (both urban and rural) and [[wetland]] management, BMPs may refer to a principal control or treatment technique as well.

==Terminology==
Beginning in the 20th century, designers of industrial and municipal sewage pollution controls typically utilized [[sewage treatment|engineered systems]] (e.g. [[Trickling filter|filters]], [[clarifier]]s, [[Bioreactor|biological reactors]]) to provide the central components of pollution control systems, and used the term "BMPs" to describe the supporting functions for these systems, such as operator training and equipment maintenance.

'''Stormwater management,''' as a specialized area within the field of [[environmental engineering]], emerged later in the 20th century, and some practitioners have used the term '''BMP''' to describe both structural or engineered control devices and systems (e.g. [[retention basin|retention ponds]]) to treat polluted stormwater, as well as operational or procedural practices (e.g. minimizing use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides). Other practitioners prefer to use the term '''Stormwater control measure''', due to the varied definitions of the term "BMP" and its use in non-stormwater practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=National Research Council, Committee on Reducing Stormwater Discharge Contributions to Water Pollution |chapter-url=http://www.nap.edu/read/12465/chapter/7 |title=Urban Stormwater Management in the United States |chapter=5. Stormwater Management Approaches |date=2009 |publisher=National Academies Press |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=978-0-309-12540-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== U.S. Clean Water Act References to "BMP" ==
[[United States Congress|Congress]] referred to '''BMP'''  in several sections of the U.S. [[Clean Water Act]] (CWA) but did not define the term.
*The 1977 CWA used the term in describing the areawide waste treatment planning program&lt;ref&gt;United States. Clean Water Act of 1977, Pub.L. 95-217, December 27, 1977. Sections 208 (b), (i) and (j), {{USC|33|1288}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in procedures for controlling [[toxic]] [[water pollution|pollutants]] associated with industrial discharges.&lt;ref&gt;CWA sec. 304(e), {{USC|33|1314(e)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Clean Water Act#Dredge and fill permits (wetlands)|"Section 404" program]], which covers dredge and fill permits, refers to BMPs in one of the enforcement exemptions.&lt;ref&gt;CWA sec. 404(f), {{USC|33|1344}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*References to stormwater BMPs first appear in the 1987 amendment to the CWA in describing the Nonpoint Source Management Demonstration Program.&lt;ref&gt;Water Quality Act of 1987, Pub.L. 100-4, February 4, 1987. CWA sec. 319(a),(b),(h),(l), &amp; (m), {{USC|33|1329}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Another stormwater BMP reference was added in 2001 with the authorization for a Wet Weather Watershed Pilot Project program.&lt;ref&gt;Wet Weather Water Quality Act of 2000, December 21, 2000. Added by the Miscellaneous Appropriations Act, 2001 (114 Stat. 2763A–225), as enacted into law by section 1(a)(6) of Pub.L. 106–554 (114 Stat. 2763). Amended CWA sec.121(a)(2), {{USC|33|1274}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== EPA definitions ==
In implementing the CWA, the U.S. [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) defined '''BMP''' in the federal wastewater permit regulations, initially to refer to auxiliary procedures for industrial wastewater controls.  
:...schedules of activities, prohibitions of practices, maintenance procedures, and other management practices to prevent or reduce the pollution of waters of the United States, BMPs also include treatment requirements, operating procedures, and practices to control plant site runoff, spillage or leaks, sludge or waste disposal, or drainage from raw material storage.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Washington, D.C. "EPA Administered Permit Programs: The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System." ''Code of Federal Regulations,'' {{CodeFedReg|40|122|2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later the Agency added a reference to stormwater management BMPs.
:...each NPDES permit shall include conditions meeting the following requirements when applicable... (k) Best management practices (BMPs)  to control or abate the discharge of pollutants when: ... (2) Authorized under section 402(p) of the CWA for the control of storm water discharges...&lt;ref&gt;EPA. {{CodeFedReg|40|122|44}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Industrial wastewater BMPs ==
Industrial wastewater BMPs are considered an adjunct to engineered [[sewage treatment|treatment]] systems. Typical BMPs include operator training, maintenance practices, and spill control procedures for treatment chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{cite report |date=July 1994 |title=Best Management Practices and Spill Response: Guidance Document |url=https://open.alberta.ca/dataset/f7457ac3-7967-49c9-94dd-7986cb6624da/resource/6b40c069-d846-4fa2-a98b-bfd060a7ab3a/download/best-management-practices-spill-response-guidance-document.pdf |publisher=Alberta Environmental Protection |location=Edmonton, AB}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also many BMPs available which are specific to particular industrial processes, for example:
* source reduction practices in metal finishing industries (e.g. substituting less toxic [[solvent]]s or using water-based cleaners);
* in the [[chemical industry]], capturing equipment washdown waters for recycle/reuse at various process stages;
* in the [[paper industry]], using [[process control]] monitoring to optimize [[bleaching]] processes, and reduce the overall amount of bleach used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=October 1993 |title=Guidance Manual for Developing Best Management Practices (BMP) |chapter=Ch. 3. Industry-Specific Best Management Practices |url=https://www3.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/owm0274.pdf |publisher=EPA |id=EPA-833-B-93-004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stormwater management BMPs ==
[[Stormwater]] management BMPs are control measures taken to mitigate changes to both quantity and quality of [[urban runoff]] caused through changes to [[land use]]. Generally BMPs focus on [[water quality]] problems caused by increased [[impervious surface]]s from [[land development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=National Research Council, Committee on Reducing Stormwater Discharge Contributions to Water Pollution |chapter-url=https://www.nap.edu/read/12465/chapter/5 |title=Urban Stormwater Management in the United States |chapter=3. Hydrologic, Geomorphic, and Biological Effects of Urbanization on Watersheds |date=2009 |publisher=National Academies Press |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=978-0-309-12540-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; BMPs are designed to reduce stormwater volume, peak flows, and/or [[nonpoint source pollution]] through [[evapotranspiration]], [[Infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]], [[detention basin|detention]], and filtration or biological and chemical actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Debo |first1=Thomas N. |last2=Reese |first2=Andrew J. |authorlink= |title=Municipal Stormwater Management |url= |accessdate= |year=2003 |edition=2nd |publisher=CRC Press |location=Boca Raton, FL |isbn=1-56670-584-3 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; BMPs also can improve receiving-water quality by extending the duration of outflows in comparison to inflow duration (known as  hydrograph extension), which dilutes the stormwater discharged into a larger volume of upstream flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author-last1=Granato |author-first1=G.E. |date=2014 |title=Statistics for stochastic modeling of volume reduction, hydrograph extension, and water-quality treatment by structural stormwater runoff best management practices (BMPs) |url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2014/5037/ |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |id=Scientific Investigations Report 2014–5037}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stormwater BMPs can be classified as "structural" (i.e., devices installed or constructed on a site) or "non-structural" (procedures, such as modified landscaping practices or street sweeping). There are a variety of BMPs available; selection typically depends on site characteristics and pollutant removal objectives. EPA has published a series of stormwater BMP fact sheets for use by local governments, builders and property owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/national-menu-best-management-practices-bmps-stormwater |title=National Menu of Best Management Practices (BMPs) for Stormwater |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016 |website=National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stormwater management BMPs can be also categorized into four basic types:
# Storage practices: ponds; recovery; [[Green infrastructure|green infrastructure design]]. 
# Vegetative practices: [[Buffer zone|buffers]]; channels; [[green roof]]s; wetlands; functional art;{{explain|date=November 2018}} stormwater wetland park design; wetland park engineering &amp; design. 
# Filtration/Infiltration practices: filtering; [[Infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]]; [[Rain garden|rain gardens]]; [[Permeable paving|porous pavement]]; civic infrastructure and design; functional stormwater design.
# Water sensitive development: better site design;{{explain|date=November 2018}} open space site design; [[Low-impact development (U.S. and Canada)|low impact development]].

A '''bleep censor''' is the replacement of a [[profanity]] or [[classified information]] with a [[beep (sound)|beep sound]] (usually a {{Audio|1000Hz.ogg|1000 Hz tone}}) in television and radio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/bleep |title=bleep – definition of bleep by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}
[[File:Bleep visual censor.gif|frame|right|Censor boxes, such as the one above, may be used along with the bleeps so that the audience would not [[lip reading|lip read]] the swearer's words. Above, the cartoon says "Oh-", followed by the censor.]]
Bleeping has been used for many years as a means of [[Censorship|censoring]] TV programs to remove content not deemed suitable for "family" or "daytime" viewing and personal information for privacy. The bleep censor is a software module, manually operated by a broadcast [[technician]]. A bleep is sometimes accompanied by a digital blur or box over the speaker's mouth in cases where the removed speech may still be easily understood by [[lip reading]].

On [[closed captioning|closed caption subtitling]], bleeped words are usually represented by the phrase "(''bleep'')", sometimes the phrase "[expletive]" or "[censored]", occasionally [[hyphen]]s (e.g. ''f—k'' ''f---''&lt;!-- sic --&gt;), and sometimes [[asterisk]]s (e.g. ****, f***, f**k, f*ck, f#@k or f#@%), remaining faithful to the audio track. Where open captions are used (generally in instances where the speaker is not easily understood), a blank is used where the word is bleeped. Occasionally, bleeping is not reflected in the captions, allowing the unedited dialogue to be seen. Sometimes, a "[[Censor bars|black bar]]" can be seen for closed caption bleep.

Bleeping is normally only used in unscripted programs – [[documentary film|documentaries]], [[radio documentary|radio features]], [[panel game]]s etc. – since scripted [[drama (genre)|drama]] and [[comedy]] are designed to suit the time of broadcast. In the case of comedies, most bleeping may be for humorous purposes, and other sound effects may be substituted for the bleep tone for comical effect, examples of which include a [[slide whistle]], an infant's cooing, dolphin noises, or a [[Coil spring|spring]] "boing".

Other uses of bleep censoring may include [[reality television]] and daytime [[talk show]]s, where identifying information such as ages, [[surname]]s, addresses/hometowns, phone numbers and attempts to advertise a personal business without advanced or appropriate notice will be silenced or bleeped to maintain the subject's privacy (such as seen for subjects arrested in episodes of ''[[Cops (TV series)|COPS]]'').

When [[film]]s are edited for daytime TV, broadcasters usually prefer not to bleep swearing, but cut out the segment containing it, replace the speech with different words, or cover it with silence or a [[sound effect]]. In the first example, the film may (unintentionally) become nonsensical or confusing if the removed portion contains an element important to the plot. The bleep is sometimes used for privacy reasons, concealing [[confidential information]] such as names and addresses.
Bleep censors have seen a rare use in cinema film, for example during Johanna Mason's interview in ''[[The Hunger Games: Catching Fire]]'', or during Tony Stark's meeting with Senator Stern in ''[[Iron Man 2]]''.

Bleeping is commonly used in [[English language|English]]-language and [[Japanese language|Japanese]]-language broadcasting, but is sometimes/rarely used in some other languages (such as [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Filipino language|Filipino]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[Thai language|Thai]]), displaying the varying attitudes between countries; some are more liberal towards swearing, less inclined to use strong profanities in front of a camera in the first place, or unwilling to censor. In the Philippines and Ecuador, undubbed movies on television have profanity muted instead of bleeped.

== Regulations ==
{{globalize|section|date=March 2013}}

=== Advertising in the United Kingdom ===
[[Television advertisements|Television]] and [[radio commercial]]s are not allowed to use bleeps to obscure swearing under [[Broadcast Advertising Clearance Centre|BACC/CAP]] guidelines. However, this does not apply to program trailers or cinema advertisements and "f**k" is beeped out of two cinema advertisements for [[Johnny Vaughan]]'s [[95.8 Capital FM|Capital FM]] show and the cinema advertisement for the ''[[Family Guy]]'' season 5 DVD. An advert for [[esure]] insurance released in October 2007 uses the censor bleep, as well as a black star placed over the speaker's mouth, to conceal the name of a competitor company the speaker said she used to use. The Comedy Central advert for ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut]]'' had a version of "Kyle's Mom's a B**ch" where vulgarities were bleeped out, though the movie itself did not have censorship, and was given a 15 rating, despite a high amount of foul language.

A [[Barnardo's]] ad, released in summer 2007, has two versions: one where a boy can be heard saying "f**k off"&lt;!--This should be left uncensored, Wikipedia is not censored (see WP:NOTCENSORED)--&gt; four times which is restricted to "18" rated cinema screenings, and one where a censor bleep sound obscures the profanity which is still restricted to "15" and "18" rated films.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Sweney, [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jul/05/advertising.asa "Probe into Barnardo's F-word ads"], ''The Guardian'', 5 July 2007
&lt;/ref&gt; Neither is permitted on UK television.

Trailers for programs containing swearing are usually bleeped until well after the [[Watershed (television)|watershed]], and it is very rare for any trailer to use the most severe swearwords uncensored.

The UK version of the Adventureland Red Band trailer (the version shown in cinemas) which showed before ''Funny People'' and ''Drag Me to Hell'' when it was out in UK cinemas had the profanities bleeped out in order to have a 15 certificate.

=== United States ===

The [[Federal Communications Commission]] has the right to regulate indecent broadcasts. However, the FCC does not actively monitor television broadcasts for indecency violations, nor does it keep a record of television broadcasts. Reports must be documented exclusively by the public and submitted in written form, whether by traditional letter or [[electronic mail|e-mail]].

The FCC is allowed to enforce indecency laws during 6&amp;nbsp;a.m. – 10&amp;nbsp;p.m. local time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/guides/obscenity-indecency-and-profanity |title=Obscenity, Indecency and Profanity |publisher=FCC.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, for network broadcasts, offensive material seen during [[Watershed (television)|watershed]] in one time zone may be subject to fines and prosecution for stations in earlier time zones: for instance, a program with offensive content broadcast at 10&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]]/[[Mountain Time Zone|Mountain]] may fall out of watershed at 9 p.m. [[Central Time Zone|Central Time]]/[[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific Time]]. To compensate, a channel may only air uncensored material after 1 a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]] so that the broadcast is out of watershed in the contiguous United States.

Cable and satellite channels are subject to regulations on what the FCC considers "obscenity," but are exempt from the FCC's "indecency" and "profanity" regulations, though many police themselves, mainly to appeal to advertisers who would be averse to placing their ads on their programs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4244">'''The China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study''' (CHARLS) is a [[longitudinal survey]] being conducted by the [[China Center for Economic Research]] at [[Peking University]] with Professor Yaohui Zhao of Peking University serving as [[Principal Investigator]] and Professors [https://dornsife.usc.edu/cf/econ/econ_faculty_display.cfm?Person_ID=1003738 John Strauss] of the [[University of Southern California]] and Albert Park of [[HKUST Institute for Emerging Market Studies]] serving as co-Principal Investigators.

== Goals ==

The survey will collect a [[representative sample]] of Chinese 45 and older every two years to enable [[Interdisciplinarity|multidisciplinary studies]] on issues related to [[population ageing]]. China is one of the fastest ageing countries in the world and accounts for a large fraction of the growth in the world’s old. By 2050, China’s elderly (65 and older) population share is expected to reach 30%.&lt;ref name="RAND_WR774"&gt;{{cite web|title=Health Outcomes and Socio-Economic Status Among the Elderly in China - Evidence from the CHARLS Pilot|url=http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/working_papers/2010/RAND_WR774.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Funding ==

The pilot survey is funded by the [[National Institute on Aging]], the [[World Bank]], and [[Natural Science Foundation of China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Institute of Aging - CHARLS Related Funding Grants|url=https://taggs.hhs.gov/RecipInfo.cfm?SELEIN=LCYqIy8%2FLEZNQkxPXFFaOEsK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Data Collection ==

The questionnaire contains information on household [[demographics]], transfers among family members, health status, health care, employment, income, consumption and [[assets]], as well as information on health facilities of the community and government policies in local areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CHARLS Pilot Questionnaire|url=http://charls.ccer.edu.cn/charls/content.asp?id=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CHARLS is designed on the models of health and retirement studies originated from the [[Health and Retirement Study]] (HRS) in the U.S., but has the advantage of including information on the community the respondent resides and local policies. Due to large internal variations of government policies, the data will enable analyses of policy impacts in the process of population ageing. Other countries participating in this international network of ageing studies include [[England]], fifteen countries in continental [[Europe]], [[Israel]], [[India]], [[Korea]], and [[Japan]].

=== Initial Results ===

The pilot survey was conducted in two provinces ([[Zhejiang]] and [[Gansu]]) in 2008 and collected data on roughly 1,600 households.&lt;ref name="RAND_WR774" /&gt; The pilot data of 2008 has been released to the research community since April 30, 2009. The national baseline survey is being planned for 2011. CHARLS data will be available for download by researchers at no cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Institute of Ageing Longitudinal Database Search|url=http://www.nia.nih.gov/ResearchInformation/ScientificResources/LongitudinalStudiesAllCurrent.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''cloud drop effective radius''' (alternatively '''cloud effective radius''' or '''effective radius''') is a [[weighted mean]] of the size distribution of cloud droplets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/PIP/shtml/cloud_effective_radius.shtml |title=Cloud Effective Radius |work=Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center |accessdate=3 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724155507/http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/PIP/shtml/cloud_effective_radius.shtml |archivedate=24 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was defined in 1974 by [[James E. Hansen]] and [[Larry Travis]] as the ratio of the third to the second [[moment (mathematics)|moment]] of a droplet size distribution to aid in the [[inverse problem|inversion]] of [[remote sensing|remotely sensed]] data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hansen., J.E. and L.D. Travis |title=Light scattering in planetary atmospheres |journal=[[Space Science Reviews]] |volume=16 |issue =4 |year=1974 |doi=10.1007/BF00168069 |pages=527–610 |bibcode=1974SSRv...16..527H}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physically, it is an area weighted radius of the cloud drop particles.

Mathematically, this can be expressed as
&lt;math&gt;r_e = \dfrac{\int\limits_{0}^{\infty} \pi \cdot r^3 \cdot n(r)\,dr}{\int\limits_{0}^{\infty} \pi \cdot r^2 \cdot n(r)\,dr}&lt;/math&gt;.

The global effective particle radius has different values for water and ice clouds: the former is around 14 μm, whereas for ice it is around 25 μm. Studies also indicate that the effective cloud droplet radius is larger over oceans than over ground by 15%-20%. By contrast, the difference in the ice particle size over land and oceans is much smaller (only 5%).&lt;ref name = "2013stubenrauch"&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9384">'''Contextual image classification''', a topic of [[pattern recognition]] in [[computer vision]], is an approach of [[Classification in machine learning|classification]] based on contextual information in images. "Contextual" means this approach is focusing on the relationship of the nearby pixels, which is also called neighbourhood. The goal of this approach is to classify the images by using the contextual information.

== Introduction ==
Similar as [[Natural language processing|processing language]], a single word may have multiple meanings unless the context is provided, and the patterns within the sentences are the only informative segments we care about. For images, the principle is same. Find out the patterns and associate proper meanings to them.

As the image illustrated below, if only a small portion of the image is shown, it is very difficult to tell what the image is about.
[[File:01 mouth.png|center|Mouth]]

Even try another portion of the image, it is still difficult to classify the image.
[[File:02 left eye.png|center|Left eye]]

However, if we increase the contextual of the image, then it makes more sense to recognize.
[[File:03 increased image of smiling face.png|center|thumb|Increased field of smiling face]]

As the full images shows below, almost everyone can classify it easily.
[[File:Full image.png|center|thumb|Full image]]

During the procedure of [[Segmentation (image processing)|segmentation]], the methods which do not use the contextual information are sensitive to noise and variations, thus the result of segmentation will contain a great deal of misclassified regions, and often these regions are small (e.g., one pixel).

Compared to other techniques, this approach is robust to noise and substantial variations for it takes the continuity of the segments into account.

Several methods of this approach will be described below.

== Applications ==

=== Functioning as a post-processing filter to a labelled image ===
This approach is very effective against small regions caused by noise. And these small regions are usually formed by few pixels or one pixel. The most probable label is assigned to these regions.
However, there is a drawback of this method. The small regions also can be formed by correct regions rather than noise, and in this case the method is actually making the classification worse.
This approach is widely used in [[remote sensing]] applications.

=== Improving the post-processing classification ===
This is a two-stage classification process:
# For each pixel, label the pixel and form a new feature vector for it.
# Use the new feature vector and combine the contextual information to assign the final label to the

=== Merging the pixels in earlier stages ===
Instead of using single pixels, the neighbour pixels can be merged into homogeneous regions benefiting from contextual information. And provide these regions to classifier.

=== Acquiring pixel feature from neighbourhood ===
The original spectral data can be enriched by adding the contextual information carried by the neighbour pixels, or even replaced in some occasions. This kind of pre-processing methods are widely used in [[Image texture|textured image]] recognition. The typical approaches include mean values, variances, texture description, etc.

=== Combining spectral and spatial information ===
The classifier uses the grey level and pixel neighbourhood (contextual information) to assign labels to pixels. In such case the information is a combination of spectral and spatial information.

=== Powered by the Bayes minimum error classifier ===
Contextual classification of image data is based on the Bayes minimum error classifier (also known as a [[naive Bayes classifier]]).

'''Present the pixel''':
*A pixel is denoted as &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;.
*The neighbourhood of each pixel &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; is a vector and denoted as &lt;math&gt;N(x_0)&lt;/math&gt;.
**The values in the neighbourhood vector is denoted as &lt;math&gt;f(x_i)&lt;/math&gt;.
**Each pixel is presented by the vector
:::&lt;math&gt;\xi = \left ( f(x_0), f(x_1), \ldots, f(x_k) \right )&lt;/math&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt;x_i \in N(x_0); \quad i = 1, \ldots, k&lt;/math&gt;

*The labels (classification) of pixels in the neighbourhood &lt;math&gt;N(x_0)&lt;/math&gt; are presented as a vector
::&lt;math&gt;\eta = \left ( \theta_0, \theta_1, \ldots, \theta_k \right )&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\theta_i \in \left \{ \omega_0, \omega_1, \ldots, \omega_k \right \}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\omega_s&lt;/math&gt; here denotes the assigned class.

*A vector presents the labels in the neighbourhood &lt;math&gt;N(x_0)&lt;/math&gt; without the pixel &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\hat \eta = \left ( \theta_1, \theta_2, \ldots, \theta_k \right )&lt;/math&gt;

'''The neighbourhood''':
Size of the neighbourhood. There is no limitation of the size, but it is considered to be relatively small for each pixel &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;.
A reasonable size of neighbourhood would be &lt;math&gt;3 \times 3&lt;/math&gt; of 4-[[Connectedness|connectivity]] or 8-connectivity (&lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; is marked as red and placed in the centre).
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Square_4_connectivity.svg|[[4-connected graph|4-connectivity]] neighbourhood,&amp;nbsp;
Image:Square_8_connectivity.svg|[[8-connectivity]] neighbourhood
&lt;/gallery&gt;

'''The calculation''':

Apply the minimum error classification on a pixel &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;, if the probability of a class &lt;math&gt;\omega_r&lt;/math&gt; being presenting the pixel &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; is the highest among all, then assign &lt;math&gt;\omega_r&lt;/math&gt; as its class.

: &lt;math&gt;\theta_0 = \omega_r \quad\text{ if }\quad P(\omega_r\mid f(x_0)) = \max_{s=1,2,\ldots,R} P(\omega_s\mid f(x_0)) &lt;/math&gt;

The contextual classification rule is described as below, it uses the feature vector &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; rather than &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;.

: &lt;math&gt;\theta_0 = \omega_r \quad\text{ if }\quad P(\omega_r\mid\xi) = \max_{s=1,2,\ldots,R} P(\omega_s\mid\xi) &lt;/math&gt;

Use the Bayes formula to calculate the posteriori probability  &lt;math&gt;P(\omega_s\mid\xi)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;P(\omega_s\mid\xi) = \frac{p(\xi\mid\omega_s)P(\omega_s)}{p \left ( \xi \right )}&lt;/math&gt;

The number of vectors is the same as the number of pixels in the image. For the classifier uses a vector corresponding to each pixel &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;, and the vector is generated from the pixel's neighbourhood.

'''The basic steps of contextual image classification''':
#Calculate the feature vector &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; for each pixel.
#Calculate the parameters of probability distribution &lt;math&gt;p ( \xi\mid\omega_s )&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P ( \omega_s )&lt;/math&gt;
#Calculate the posterior probabilities &lt;math&gt;P(\omega_r\mid\xi)&lt;/math&gt; and all labels &lt;math&gt;\theta_0&lt;/math&gt;. Get the image classification result.

== Algorithms ==

=== Template matching ===
The [[template matching]] is a "brute force" implementation of this approach.&lt;ref&gt;G.T. Toussaint, "The Use of Context in Pattern Recognition," Pattern Recognition, vol. 10, 1977,  pp. 189–204.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is first create a set of templates, and then look for small parts in the image match with a template.

This method is computationally high and inefficient. It keeps an entire templates list during the whole process and the number of combinations is extremely high. For a &lt;math&gt;m \times n&lt;/math&gt; pixel image, there could be a maximum of &lt;math&gt;2^{m \times n}&lt;/math&gt; combinations, which leads to high computation. This method is a top down method and often called [[Lookup table|table look-up]] or [[Data dictionary|dictionary look-up]].

=== Lower-order Markov chain ===

The [[Markov chain]]&lt;ref&gt;K. Abend, T.J. Harley, and L.N. Kanal, "Classification of Binary Random Patterns," IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, vol. 11, no. 4, October 1965, pp. 538–544.&lt;/ref&gt; also can be applied in pattern recognition. The pixels in an image can be recognised as a set of random variables, then use the lower order Markov chain to find the relationship among the pixels. The image is treated as a virtual line, and the method uses conditional probability.

=== Hilbert space-filling curves ===

The [[Hilbert curve]] runs in a unique pattern through the whole image, it traverses every pixel without visiting any of them twice and keeps a continuous curve. It is fast and efficient.

=== Markov meshes ===

The lower-order Markov chain and Hilbert space-filling curves mentioned above are treating the image as a line structure. The Markov meshes however will take the two dimensional information into account.

=== Dependency tree ===

The [[Chow–Liu tree|dependency tree]]&lt;ref&gt;C.K. Chow and C.N. Liu, "Approximating Discrete Probability Distributions with Dependence Trees," IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, vol.14, no. 3, May 1965, pp. 462–467.&lt;/ref&gt; is a method using tree dependency to approximate probability distributions.

'''Criticism of science''' addresses and refines problems within [[science]] in order to improve science as a whole and its role in society. It is distinct from the academic positions of [[antiscience]] or [[anti-intellectualism]] which seek to reject entirely the scientific method.

==Philosophical critiques==
[[File:Paul Feyerabend Berkeley.jpg|200px|thumb|"All methodologies, even the most obvious ones, have their limits." ―[[Paul Feyerabend]] in ''[[Against Method]]'']]

[[Philosophy of science|Philosopher of science]] [[Paul Feyerabend]] advanced the idea of [[epistemological anarchism]], which holds that there are no useful and exception-free [[methodology|methodological rules]] governing the [[scientific progress|progress of science]] or the growth of [[knowledge]], and that the idea that science can or should operate according to universal and fixed rules is unrealistic, pernicious and detrimental to science itself.&lt;ref name="contra"&gt;{{cite book | last = Feyerabend | first = Paul |authorlink = Paul Feyerabend | title = Against Method | publisher = Verso | location = London | year = 1993 | isbn = 978-0-86091-646-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Feyerabend advocates a democratic society where science is treated as an equal to other [[ideology|ideologies]] or social institutions such as [[religion]], and [[education]], or [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] and [[mythology]], and considers the dominance of science in society [[authoritarian]] and unjustified.&lt;ref name="contra"/&gt; He also contended (along with [[Imre Lakatos]]) that the [[demarcation problem]] of distinguishing science from [[pseudoscience]] on objective grounds is not possible and thus fatal to the notion of science running according to fixed, universal rules.&lt;ref name="contra"/&gt;

Feyerabend also criticized science for not having evidence for its own philosophical precepts. Particularly the notion of Uniformity of Law and the Uniformity of Process across time and space, as noted by [[Steven Jay Gould]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gould|first=Stephen J|title=[[Time's Arrow, Time's Cycle]]: Myth and Metaphor in the Discovery of Geological Time|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1987|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=120|isbn=0-674-89198-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; "We have to realize that a unified theory of the physical world simply does not exist" says Feyerabend, "We have theories that work in restricted regions, we have purely formal attempts to condense them into a single formula, we have lots of unfounded claims (such as the claim that all of chemistry can be reduced to physics), phenomena that do not fit into the accepted framework are suppressed; in physics, which many scientists regard as the one really basic science, we have now at least three different points of view...without a promise of conceptual (and not only formal) unification".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 0-86091-184-5 | title = Farewell To Reason| page = 100 | publisher = Verso | last = Feyerabend | first = Paul | year = 1987 | authorlink = Paul Feyerabend}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, science is [[begging the question]] when it presupposes that there is a universal truth with no proof thereof.

Historian [[Jacques Barzun]] termed science "a [[faith]] as [[fanaticism|fanatical]] as any in [[history]]" and warned against the use of scientific thought to suppress considerations of [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] as integral to [[human]] existence.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Barzun, ''Science: The Glorious Entertainment'', Harper and Row: 1964. p. 15. (quote) and Chapters II and XII.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[Stanley Aronowitz]] scrutinizes science for operating with the presumption that the only acceptable criticisms of science are those conducted within the methodological framework that science has set up for itself. That science insists that only those who have been inducted into its community, through means of training and credentials, are qualified to make these criticisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 0-8166-1659-0 | title = Science As Power: Discourse and Ideology in Modern Society | page = viii (preface) | publisher = [[University of Minnesota Press]] | last = Aronowitz | first = Stanley | year = 1988 | authorlink = Stanley Aronowitz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aronowitz also alleges that while scientists consider it absurd that [[Fundamentalist Christianity]] uses biblical references to bolster their claim that the [[Bible]] is true, scientists pull the same tactic by using the tools of science to settle disputes concerning its own validity.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Aronowitz in conversation with Derrick Jensen in {{cite book | isbn = 1-931498-52-0 | title = Welcome to the Machine: Science, Surveillance, and the Culture of Control | page = 31 | publisher = Chelsea Green Publishing Company | last = Jensen | first = Derrick | year = 2004 | authorlink = Derrick Jensen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher of religion [[Alan Watts]] criticized science for operating under a materialist model of the world that he posited is simply a modified version of the [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic worldview]], that "the universe is constructed and maintained by a Lawmaker" (commonly identified as [[God]] or the [[Logos]]). Watts asserts that during the rise of secularism through the 18th to 20th century when scientific philosophers got rid of the notion of a lawmaker they kept the notion of law, and that the idea that the world is a material machine run by law is a presumption just as unscientific as religious doctrines that affirm it is a material machine made and run by a lawmaker.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Watts Audio lecture "Myth and Religion: Image of Man" and "Out Of Your Mind, 1: The Nature of Consciousness: 'Our image of the world' and 'The myth of the automatic universe'"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epistemology===

David Parkin compared the [[epistemology|epistemological]] stance of science to that of [[divination]]. He suggested that, to the degree that divination is an epistemologically specific means of gaining insight into a given question, science itself can be considered a form of divination that is framed from a Western view of the nature (and thus possible applications) of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Parkin|first1=David|chapter=Simultaneity and Sequencing in the Oracular Speech of Kenyan Diviners|page=185|editor-last1=Peek|editor-first1=Philip M.|title=African divination systems : ways of knowing|date=1991|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|isbn=9780253343093}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Polymath]] and [[Discordianism#Episkopos|Episkopos]] of [[Discordianism]] [[Robert Anton Wilson]] stresses that the instruments used in scientific investigation produce meaningful answers relevant only to the instrument, and that there is no objective vantage point from which science could verify its findings since all findings are relative to begin with.&lt;ref name="Anton Wilson 1999 4"&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 1-56184-002-5 | title = The New Inquisition | page = 4 | publisher = New Falcon Publications | last = Anton Wilson | first = Robert | year = 1999 | authorlink = Robert Anton Wilson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics===
[[File:An Experiment on a Bird in an Air Pump by Joseph Wright of Derby, 1768.jpg|thumb|right|[[Joseph Wright of Derby]] (1768) ''An Experiment on a Bird in an Air Pump'', National Gallery, London]]
Several academics have offered critiques concerning [[ethics]] in science. In ''Science and Ethics'', for example, the professor of philosophy [[Bernard Rollin]] examines the relevance of ethics to science, and argues in favor of making education in ethics part and parcel of scientific training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | first=Bernard E. | last=Rollin | year=2006
 | title=Science and Ethics
 | publisher=Cambridge University Press
 | isbn=0-521-85754-6
 | oclc=238793190 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Social science]] scholars, like [[anthropologist]]s like [[Tim Ingold]], and scholars from [[philosophy]] and the [[humanities]], like [[Adorno]] in [[critical theory]], have criticized modern science for subservience to economic and technological interests.&lt;ref name="Ingold1996p9"&gt;"Many would agree that modern science has become so corrupted by its association with positivist methodology, and by its subservience to commercial and military interests" {{harv|Ingold|1996|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A related criticism is the debate on positivism. While before the 19th century science was perceived to be in opposition to religion, in contemporary society science is often defined as the antithesis of the [[humanities]] and [[the arts]].&lt;ref name="Ingold1996p19"&gt;"Keith Hart is sensitive to the way in which the meaning of science has changed over the centuries. His strategy for revealing such changes is to show how successive generations have responded to the question of what science is not. Where once the antitheses of science were myth and religion, now they are the humanities and creative arts." {{harv|Ingold|1996|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many recent thinkers, such as [[Carolyn Merchant]], [[Theodor Adorno]] and [[E. F. Schumacher]] considered that the 17th century [[scientific revolution]] shifted science from a focus on understanding [[nature]], or [[wisdom]], to a focus on manipulating nature, i.e. [[power (sociology)|power]], and that science's emphasis on manipulating nature leads it inevitably to manipulate people, as well.&lt;ref name=UW&gt;Fritjof Capra, ''Uncommon Wisdom'', {{ISBN|0-671-47322-0}}, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; Science's focus on quantitative measures has led to critiques that it is unable to recognize important qualitative aspects of the world.&lt;ref name=UW/&gt;

==Methodology==
===Cognitive and publication biases===
While many scientists and skeptics point out cognitive biases that may permeate commonsense thinking and cause illogical conclusions, the same biases are much less likely to be examined within the scientific community.  Critics argue that the biggest bias within science is motivated reasoning, whereby scientists are more likely to accept evidence that supports their hypothesis and more likely to scrutinize findings that do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | last=Philip | first=Ball | date=May 14, 2015

 | title=The Trouble with Scientists
 | publisher=Nautilus
 | accessdate=2015-03-11
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists do not practice pure induction but instead often come into science with preconceived ideas and often will, unconsciously or consciously, interpret observations to support their own hypotheses through confirmation bias. For example, scientists may re-run trials when they do not support a hypothesis but use results from the first trial when they do support their hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | first=Thomas | last=Gilovich | year=1991
 | title=How We Know What Isn't So
 | publisher=The Free Press
 | isbn=0-02-911706-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often argued that while each individual has cognitive biases, these biases are corrected for when scientific evidence converges. However, systematic issues in the publication system of academic journals can often compound these biases.  Issues like [[publication bias]], where studies with non-significant results are less likely to be published, and selective outcome reporting bias, where only the significant outcomes out of a variety of outcomes are likely to be published, are common within academic literature. These biases have widespread implications, such as the distortion of meta-analyses where only studies that include positive results are likely to be included.&lt;ref name=Ioannidis&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ioannidis|first1=John P.A.|last2=Munafò|first2=Marcus R.|last3=Fusar-Poli|first3=Paolo|last4=Nosek|first4=Brian A.|last5=David|first5=Sean P.|title=Publication and other reporting biases in cognitive sciences: detection, prevalence, and prevention|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date=May 2014|volume=18|issue=5|pages=235–241|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2014.02.010|pmid=24656991|pmc=4078993}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Statistical outcomes can be manipulated as well, for example large numbers of participants can be used and trials overpowered so that small difference cause significant effects or inclusion criteria can be changed to include those are most likely to respond to a treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greenhalgh|first1=T.|last2=Howick|first2=J.|last3=Maskrey|first3=N.|title=Evidence based medicine: a movement in crisis?|journal=BMJ|date=13 June 2014|volume=348|issue=jun13 4|pages=g3725–g3725|doi=10.1136/bmj.g3725}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether produced on purpose or not, all of these issues need to be taken into consideration within scientific research, and peer-reviewed published evidence should not be assumed to be outside of the realm of bias and error; some critics are now claiming that many results in scientific journals are false or exaggerated.&lt;ref name=Ioannidis/&gt;

===Reproducibility===
The [[behavioral science]] and [[social science]]s have long suffered from the problem of their studies being largely not being [[Reproducibility|reproducible]].&lt;ref name=Carey&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/28/science/many-social-science-findings-not-as-strong-as-claimed-study-says.html?_r=0|first=Benedict |last=Carey |title=Many Psychology Findings Not as Strong as Claimed, Study Says |publisher=New York Times |date=27 August 2015 |accessdate=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Now, [[biomedicine]] has come under similar pressures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2016/jan/04/biomedical-studies-not-reproducible/ |title=Most biomed studies irreproducible, reviews find |first=Bradley J. |last=Fikes |journal=San Diego Union-Tribune |date=4 January 2016 |accessdate=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a phenomenon known as the [[replication crisis]], journals are less likely to publish straight replication studies so it may be difficult to disprove results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | last=French | first=Chris | date=March 15, 2012  | url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/mar/15/precognition-studies-curse-failed-replications  | title=Precognition studies and the curse of the failed replications  | publisher=The Guardian  | accessdate=2015-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another result of publication bias is the [[Proteus phenomenon]]: early attempts to replicate results tend to contradict them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pfeiffer|first1=Thomas|last2=Bertram|first2=Lars|last3=Ioannidis|first3=John P. A.|last4=Biondi-Zoccai|first4=Giuseppe|title=Quantifying Selective Reporting and the Proteus Phenomenon for Multiple Datasets with Similar Bias|journal=PLoS ONE|date=29 March 2011|volume=6|issue=3|pages=e18362|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0018362}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are claims that this bias may be beneficial, allowing accurate meta-analysis with fewer publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Winter|first1=Joost|last2=Happee|first2=Riender|last3=Wray|first3=K. Brad|title=Why Selective Publication of Statistically Significant Results Can Be Effective|journal=PLoS ONE|date=20 June 2013|volume=8|issue=6|pages=e66463|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0066463}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metascience critiques ===
There are some critiques of science from [[metascience (research)|metascience]], that broadly accepted form of scientific publishing produces mostly insignificant, unreliable and false results, because of studies design and prevalence of [[scientific misconduct]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ioannidis|first=John P.

==Feminist critiques==
{{See also|Feminist philosophy of science}}
Feminist scholars and women scientists such as [[Emily Martin (anthropologist)|Emily Martin]], [[Evelyn Fox Keller]], [[Ruth Hubbard]], [[Londa Schiebinger]] and Bonnie Spanier have critiqued science because they believe it presents itself as objective and neutral while ignoring its inherent [[gender bias]]. They assert that gender bias exists in the language and practice of science, as well as in the expected appearance and social acceptance of who can be scientists within society.&lt;ref name="Aggressive egg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Math classes"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schiebinger|first=Londa|title=Has Feminism Changed Science?|year=2001|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=USA|pages=56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=Emily|title=The Egg and the Sperm: How Science Has Constructed a Romance Based on Stereotypical Male-Female Roles|journal=Signs|issue=3|date=Spring 1991|volume=16|pages=485–501|doi=10.1086/494680}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sandra Harding]] says that the "moral and political insights of the women's movement have inspired social scientists and biologists to raise critical questions about the ways traditional researchers have explained gender, sex, and relations within and between the social and natural worlds."&lt;ref name=Harding_method&gt;{{cite book|author=Harding, Sandra|editor=Nancy Tuana|year=1989|title=Feminism &amp; Science|chapter= 'Is Therea Feminist Method'|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-20525-4|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anne Fausto-Sterling]] is a prominent example of this kind of feminist work within biological science. Some feminists, such as [[Ruth Hubbard]] and [[Evelyn Fox Keller]], criticize traditional [[rhetoric of science|scientific discourse]] as being historically biased towards a male perspective.&lt;ref name="shildrick"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Price, Janet |author2=Shildrick, Margrit |title=Feminist Theory and the Body: A Reader |year=1999 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=0-415-92566-5 |page=487}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hubbard, Ruth|year=1990|title=The Politics of Women's Biology|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=0-8135-1490-8|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; A part of the feminist research agenda is the examination of the ways in which power inequities are created and/or reinforced in scientific and academic institutions.&lt;ref name="QCommRsrch"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Lindlof | first1 = Thomas R. | last2 = Taylor | first2 = Bryan C. | title = Qualitative Communication Research Methods | publisher = Sage Publications | location = Thousand Oaks, Calif | year = 2002 | isbn = 978-0-7619-2493-7 |page = 357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other feminist scholars, such as [[Ann Hibner Koblitz]],&lt;ref&gt;Ann Hibner Koblitz, "A historian looks at gender and science," ''International Journal of Science Education'', vol. 9 (1987), p. 399-407.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lenore Blum]],&lt;ref&gt;Lenore Blum, "AWM's first twenty years: The presidents' perspectives," in Bettye Anne Case and Anne M. Leggett, eds., ''Complexities: Women in Mathematics'', Princeton University Press, 2005, p. 94-95.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mary Gray (scholar)|Mary Gray]],&lt;ref&gt;Mary Gray, "Gender and mathematics: Mythology and Misogyny," in Gila Hanna, ed., ''Towards Gender Equity in Mathematics Education: An ICMI Study'', Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Mary Beth Ruskai,&lt;ref&gt;Mary Beth Ruskai, "Why women are discouraged from becoming scientists," ''The Scientist'', March 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; and Pnina Abir-Am and Dorinda Outram,&lt;ref&gt;Pnina Abir-Am and Dorinda Outram, "Introduction," ''Uneasy Careers and Intimate Lives: Women in Science, 1789-1979'', Rutgers University Press, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; have criticized some gender and science theories for ignoring the diverse nature of scientific research and the tremendous variation in women's experiences in different cultures and historical periods.  For example, the first generation of women to receive advanced university degrees in Europe were almost entirely in the natural sciences and medicine -- in part because those fields at the time were much more welcoming of women than were the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Hibner Koblitz, ''Science, Women and Revolution in Russia'', Routledge, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;  Koblitz and others who are interested in increasing the number of women in science have expressed concern that some of the statements by feminist critics of science could undermine those efforts, notably the following assertion by Keller:&lt;ref&gt;Evelyn Fox Keller, ''Reflections on Gender and Science'', Yale University Press, 1985, p. 174-175.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|
Just as surely as inauthenticity is the cost a woman suffers by joining men in misogynist jokes, so it is, equally, the cost suffered by a woman who identifies with an image of the scientist modeled on the patriarchal husband.  Only if she undergoes a radical disidentification from self can she share masculine pleasure in mastering a nature cast in the image of woman as passive, inert, and blind.
}}

==Language in science==
Emily Martin examines the metaphors used in science to support her claim that science reinforces socially constructed ideas about gender rather than objective views of nature. In her study about the fertilization process, Martin describes several cases when gender-biased perception skewed the descriptions of biological processes during fertilization and even possibly hampered the research. She asserts that classic metaphors of the strong dominant sperm racing to an idle egg are products of gendered stereotyping rather than a faithful portrayal of [[human fertilization]]. The notion that women are passive and men are active are socially constructed attributes of gender which, according to Martin, scientists have projected onto the events of fertilization and so obscuring the fact that eggs do play an active role. For example, she wrote that "even after having revealed...the egg to be a chemically active sperm catcher, even after discussing the egg's role in tethering the sperm, the research team continued for another three years to describe the sperm's role as actively penetrating the egg."&lt;ref name="Aggressive egg"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Freedman|first=David|title=New Theory on How The Aggressive Egg Attracts Sperm|journal=Discover|date=June 1992|url=http://discovermagazine.com/1992/jun/theaggressiveegg55|accessdate=November 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott Gilbert, a developmental biologist at Swarthmore College supports her position: "if you don’t have an interpretation of fertilization that allows you to look at the egg as active, you won’t look for the molecules that can prove it. You simply won’t find activities that you don’t visualize."&lt;ref name="Aggressive egg"/&gt;

==Media and politics==
{{main|Politicization of science}}
The [[mass media]] face a number of pressures that can prevent them from accurately depicting competing scientific claims in terms of their credibility within the scientific community as a whole. Determining how much weight to give different sides in a [[scientific debate]] requires considerable expertise regarding the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Many issues damage the relationship of science to the media and the [[Politicization of science|use of science and scientific arguments by politicians]]. As a very broad generalisation, many politicians seek certainties and ''facts'' whilst scientists typically offer probabilities and caveats. However, politicians' ability to be heard in the [[mass media]] frequently distorts the scientific understanding by the public. Examples in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] include the controversy over the [[MMR vaccine|MMR inoculation]], and the 1988 forced resignation of a government minister, [[Edwina Currie]], for revealing the high probability that battery eggs were contaminated with ''[[Salmonella]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/3/newsid_2519000/2519451.stm "1988: Egg industry fury over salmonella claim"], "On This Day," BBC News, December 3, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scientists and philosophers suggest that scientific theories are more or less shaped by the dominant political, economic, or cultural models of the time, even though the scientific community may claim to be exempt from social influences and historical conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 978-0-86091-646-8 | title = Against Method | page = 66 | publisher = Verso | last = Feyerabend | first = Paul | year = 1983 | authorlink = Paul Feyerabend}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 0-8166-1659-0 | title = Science As Power: Discourse and Ideology in Modern Society | pages = 272–273, 276 | publisher = University of Minnesota Press | last = Aronowitz | first = Stanley | year = 1988 | authorlink = Stanley Aronowitz}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Zoologist]] [[Peter Kropotkin]] thought that the Darwinian theory of evolution overstressed a painful "we must struggle to survive" way of life, which he said was influenced by [[capitalism]] and the struggling lifestyles people lived within it.&lt;ref name="Anton Wilson 1999 4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 1-4043-1945-X | title = Mutual Aid | page = Preface to the 1914 edition | publisher = Porter Sargent | last = Kropotkin | first = Peter | year = 1955 | authorlink = Robert Anton Wilson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karl Marx also thought that science was largely driven by and used as capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 0-8166-1659-0 | title = Science As Power: Discourse and Ideology in Modern Society | page = 40 | publisher = University of Minnesota Press | last = Aronowitz | first = Stanley | year = 1988 | authorlink = Stanley Aronowitz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Anton Wilson]], [[Stanley Aronowitz]], and [[Paul Feyerabend]] all thought that the [[military-industrial complex]], large [[corporation]]s, and the grants that came from them had an immense influence over the research and even results of scientific experiments.&lt;ref name="contra"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Robert Anton: 1999, pg 92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 0-86091-184-5 | title = Farewell To Reason| page = 102 | publisher = Verso | last = Feyerabend | first = Paul | year = 1987 | authorlink = Paul Feyerabend}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yo2"&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 0-8166-1659-0 | title = Science As Power: Discourse and Ideology in Modern Society | page = 20 | publisher = University of Minnesota Press | last = Aronowitz | first = Stanley | year = 1988 | authorlink = Stanley Aronowitz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aronowitz even went as far as to say "It does not matter that the scientific community ritualistically denies its alliance with economic/industrial and military power. The evidence is overwhelming that such is the case. Thus, every major power has a national science policy; the United States Military appropriates billions each year for 'basic' as well as 'applied' research".&lt;ref name="yo2" /&gt;

'''''Degenerates and Perverts''''' is an art history book written by [[Eileen Chanin]] and Steven Miller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.artlink.com.au/articles/2785/degenerates-and-perverts/ |title=Degenerates and Perverts |last=Furby |first=Paula |website=www.artlink.com.au |access-date=November 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is about the [[1939 Herald Exhibition of French and British Contemporary Art]], a groundbreaking exhibition of [[contemporary art]] which stayed in Australia throughout the [[Second World War]]. This exhibition included works by masters such as [[Picasso]] and [[Van Gogh]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.abebooks.com/9780522851045/Degenerates-Perverts-1939-Herald-Exhibition-0522851045/plp |title=Degenerates and Perverts: The 1939 Herald Exhibition of Modern Art |website=www.abebooks.com |access-date=November 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; available at bargain war-time prices. It has been regarded as a missed opportunity for Australia to establish a world-class art collection. The book includes reproductions of many of the artworks, and discusses the story of the exhibition and the myths which have grown up around it.

''Degenerates and Perverts'' was published by the [[Miegunyah Press]] (an imprint of [[Melbourne University Press]]) in 2005, and included an introductory essay by Judith Pugh. The book won the [[NSW History Awards]] and was shortlisted for the [[Victorian Premier's Literary Award]].

The title comes from a comment by art gallery director [[J. S. McDonald]] that modern art was "the work of degenerates and perverts".

{{COI|date=July 2016}}
'''Festive ecology''' explores the relationships between the [[symbol]]ism and the [[ecology]] of the [[plant]]s, [[fungi]] and [[animal]]s associated with cultural events such as [[festivals]], [[processions]], and special occasions.  Examples of topics are given below.

==Christmas==
The plants traditionally associated with [[Christmas]] – [[holly]], [[ivy]], [[mistletoe]], [[common yew]] - have had special roles in earlier religions and past cultures.  Some early religions in [[Europe]] had midwinter festivals to celebrate the return of the sun from the shortest day.  In the 4th and 5th centuries, 25 December was gradually adopted as the date for Christmas in Europe in order to superimpose on the existing mid-winter festivals.  The [[winter solstice]] in the Northern Hemisphere, on what is now 17 December, was the start of the Roman festival of [[Saturnalia]].  This was a week of public feasting, dancing, singing and gambling.  Houses were decorated with evergreens and bunches of holly were given as tokens of friendship.  When this festival was absorbed into the Christian calendar, holly and the other evergreens were absorbed as well.

===Holly===
Holly is palatable to livestock despite its spines and was extensively used as a winter fodder for livestock in medieval times in England and Wales, particularly in [[Cumbria]], the [[Pennines]] and the [[Welsh borders]].&lt;ref name=Spray&gt;Spray, M (1981). Holly as a fodder in England. ''Agricultural History Review'' '''29''', 97-110.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hay and grains for wintering stock would often have run short in these upland areas.  This would mean that the livestock would eventually have to be slaughtered, causing real problems to medieval economies in the following years.  Thus, a supply of fresh browse would have been extremely valuable.  Written records of payments and agreements involving the use of holly for livestock cover a wide period from the late 12th century to the mid-18th century, by which time the practice had been largely abandoned.&lt;ref name=Spray/&gt;  An early reference to the practice occurs in “[[The Dream of Rhonabwy]]”, a Welsh story from the [[Mabinogion]],  a remarkable collection of medieval literature.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Gwyn &amp; Jones, Thomas (1949). ''The Mabinogion''.  Revised edition 1989. JM Dent &amp; Sons, London.&lt;/ref&gt;  Written before the 14th century, The Dream of Rhonabwy refers to the mid-12th century in [[Powys]].  The floor of the old black house of Heilyn Goch is described as being covered in the urine and dung of cows together with branches of holly whose tips had been eaten by the cattle.

===Ivy===
Ivy was used in garlands by the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] and the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] for religious ceremonies and for celebrating at other, more secular, occasions.  It was strongly associated with Bacchus ([[Dionysus]]), the Greco-Roman god of [[wine]].  Since Roman times, ivy has been associated with wine and wine-making.  Branches of evergreen ivy tied to a pole was often used as the “sign of the bush” indicating a place where wine or alcohol was for sale.  Hence, the proverb “Good wine needs no bush” meaning that it is not necessary to advertise well-made goods.  Ivy is less commonly seen in houses in Britain at Christmas compared to holly and mistletoe and it may be that established religions opposed its use in Christmas wreaths because of its association with drunkenness.

===Mistletoe===

Mistletoe is an evergreen plant well known for its association with [[oak]] trees and [[Druids]] first documented by [[Pliny the Elder]] who wrote about the ceremonies of the [[Celt]]ic Druids in [[Gaul]] in his ''[[Naturalis]] Historia''.&lt;ref&gt;Rackham, H (1952). ''Pliny: Natural History'', Book XVI, para xcv. Heinemann, London.&lt;/ref&gt;  These Druids held the oak in particular veneration, used oak leaves in their ceremonies, and regarded anything growing on oak trees as having been sent from heaven.  On the rare occasions when mistletoe was found growing on an oak, it would be gathered with great ceremony.  A priest in white clothing would cut the mistletoe with a golden sickle and allow it to fall onto a white cloak; two white bulls would then be sacrificed.  According to Pliny, it was believed that mistletoe in a drink would make any barren animal fertile and that it was a remedy for all poisons.  Special powers are attributed to mistletoe by a wide range of cultures, both within Europe and further afield.&lt;ref&gt;Frazer, J G (1922). ''The Golden Bough''. Macmillan, London.&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of mistletoe as an all-heal and a cure for barrenness is reputed to have a very ancient history.&lt;ref&gt;Graves, R (1955). ''The Greek Myths''. Penguin, Harmondsworth.&lt;/ref&gt;  The link between mistletoe and fertility persists to this day in Britain in the tradition of kissing underneath bunches of mistletoe at Christmas.  In the early 19th century, it was traditional for each man who kissed under the mistletoe to remove one berry.  Once all the berries are gone, so is the potency.

===Yew Trees===
Yew trees continually put out new stems which coalesce with the existing trunk resulting in trees of great age.  The merging of old and decaying wood with vibrant young shoots has led to the yew being traditionally associated with [[reincarnation]] and [[immortality]].&lt;ref&gt;Cornish, V (1946). ''The Churchyard Yew and Immortality''. Frederick Muller, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dressing the Arbor Tree, Aston-on-Clun, Shropshire, England==
[[File:Arbour tree, Aston on Clun (1293722).jpg|thumb|Arbour tree, [[Aston on Clun]], 1920's]]
The custom of dressing the Arbor tree – a [[black poplar]] growing in [[Aston-on-Clun]] in south Shropshire – with flags on flagpoles every 29 May is almost unique in Britain,&lt;ref&gt;Box, John (2003). Dressing the Arbor tree.  ''Folklore'' '''114''', 13-28.&lt;/ref&gt; although "[[Appleton_Thorn#Bawming_the_Thorn|Bawming the Thorn]]" at [[Appleton Thorn]] in [[Cheshire]] is not dissimilar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.information-britain.co.uk/customdetail.php?id=19|title=British Folk Customs, Bawming the thorn, Cheshire|author=|date=|website=www.information-britain.co.uk|accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  New flags are attached to wooden flagpoles on the Arbor tree which remain throughout the year.  

The Arbor tree is a male black poplar tree growing beside a stream at a place where four roads meet.  Written records of the Arbor tree only extend back to 1898, but the tradition of dressing the tree is reputed to date back to a local wedding in 1786.  The custom has developed and acquired new meanings, particularly since the 1955 when a pageant was devised.  The pageant and the celebrations associated with the tree dressing are evolving in response to those living in the local community as well as to the external recognition now accorded to this unique tradition. 

The present black poplar grew from a rooted cutting taken from the old tree which was said to be at least 300 years old when it collapsed in 1995 and had been repeatedly pollarded.  Black poplar is an extremely unusual tree to be associated with notable events or traditions, which are more likely to involve [[pedunculate oak]], [[sessile oak]], common yew or hawthorn (''[[Crataegus]]'').

The black poplar (''Populus nigra'' var. ''betulifolia'') is an uncommon native tree in Britain.  Black poplars are associated with alluvial soils in river valleys and floodplains generally south of a line from the [[River Mersey]] to the estuary of the [[Humber]] with particular concentrations across the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] from the [[Welsh Marches]] to [[East Anglia]] and notably in the Vale of Aylesbury ([[Aylesbury Vale]]).&lt;ref&gt;Mabey, Richard (1996).  ''Flora Britannica''. [[Sinclair-Stevenson]], London.&lt;/ref&gt;  A male clone ([[cloning]]) was much planted in the suburbs of [[Manchester]] in the late 18th century as it grew well in the polluted atmosphere and it became known as the ‘Manchester poplar’.  Growing to a height of some 30&amp;nbsp;metres, the bark of the black poplar is distinctively ridged and furrowed and has characteristic large burrs or bosses.  When mature, the tree forms a huge dome of massive spreading branches which arch outwards.  This spreading habit is dramatically different from the elongated shape of the Lombardy poplar (''Populus nigra'' ‘Italica’) which, surprisingly, is a cultivated variety of the black poplar that was imported to [[Essex]] from [[Turin]] in 1758 and widely planted because of its unusual shape.  The black poplar is also a different species from the more widespread black Italian poplar (''Populus'' x&amp;nbsp;''euramericana'' or ''Populus'' x&amp;nbsp;''canadensi''s) which is a hybrid between the black poplar and the North American eastern cottonwood (''[[Populus deltoides]]'').

Poplars are unusual in that there are separate male and female trees.  Male black poplars are far more numerous than female trees in Britain and seedlings are, therefore, very rare.&lt;ref&gt;Milne-Redhead, Edgar (1990).  The BSBI black poplar survey, 1973-88.  ''Watsonia'' '''18''', 1-5.&lt;/ref&gt;  Regrowth occurs from the branches or trunk of fallen trees which root into the underlying soil.  Growing in river valleys and floodplains, the trees can be uprooted by floods and grow again in a new location.

==Other==
Accounts of other traditional customs on 29 May are usually linked to Royal Oak Day ([[Oak Apple Day]]) and include the surviving customary rights in [[Grovely Wood]] at [[Great Wishford]], [[Wiltshire]], and [[Castleton Garland Day|Garland King Day]] at [[Castleton, Derbyshire|Castleton]] (Derbyshire).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4767">The '''flail space model (FSM)''' is a [[Physical model|model]] of how a [[passenger|car passenger]] moves in a [[vehicle]] that collides with a roadside feature such as a [[Traffic barrier|guardrail]] or a [[crash cushion]]. Its principal purpose is to assess the potential risk of harm to the hypothetical occupant as he or she impacts the interior of the passenger compartment and, ultimately, the efficacy of an experimental roadside feature undergoing full-scale vehicle crash testing.

The FSM eliminates the complexity and expense of using instrumented [[Crash test dummy|anthropometric dummies]] during the crash test experiments. Furthermore, while crash test dummies were developed to model collisions between vehicles, they are not accurate when used for the sorts of collision angles that occur when a vehicle collides with a roadside feature; by contrast, the FSM was designed for such collisions.&lt;ref name="gabauer"&gt;Gabauer, Douglas, "A methodology to evaluate the flail space model using event data recorder technology", Department of Mechanical Engineering, Rowan University, Glassboro, NJ, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The FSM is based on research performed at [[Southwest Research Institute]] in 1980&lt;ref&gt;Michie, J. D., "Development of improved criteria for evaluating safety performance of highway appurtenances", Final Report of  Internal Research Project No. 03-9254, Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio, Texas, June 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; and published in 1981 in the paper entitled "Collision Risk Assessment Based on Occupant Flail-Space Model" by Jarvis D. Michie.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Michie, J. D., "Collision risk assessment based on occupant flail space model," in Transportation Research Record 796, 1981, pp. 1–9.&lt;/ref&gt; The FSM (coined by Michie) was accepted by the highway community and published as a key part of the "Recommended Procedures for the Safety Evaluation of Highway Appurtenances" published in 1981 in [[National Cooperative Highway Research Program]] (NCHRP) Report 230.&lt;ref&gt;Michie, J. D.  National Cooperative Highway Research Program Report 230: Recommended Procedures for the Safety Performance Evaluation of Highway Appurtenances.  NCHRP Transportation Research Board, Washington, DC, March 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, the NCHRP Report was updated and presented as NCHRP Report 350;&lt;ref&gt;Ross, H. E., Jr. et al.  National Cooperative Highway Research Program Report 350:  Recommended Procedures for the Safety Evaluation of Highway Features.  NCHRP Transportation Research Board, Washington, DC, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; in this research effort performed by the [[Texas A&amp;M Transportation Institute|Texas Transportation Research Institute]], the FSM was reexamined and was unmodified in the new publication. In 2004, Douglas Gabauer further examined the efficacy of the FSM in his [[PhD thesis]].&lt;ref name="gabauer" /&gt; The [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials]] (AASHTO) retained the FSM as the method of assessing the risk of harm to vehicle occupants in the 2009 "Manual for Assessing Safety Hardware" that replaced NCHRP Report 350, stating that the FSM had "served its intended purpose well".&lt;ref&gt;Manual for Assessing Safety Hardware.  American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, Washington, DC,  2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Details ==
The FSM hypothesis divides the collision into two stages.  In stage one, the unrestrained occupant is propelled forward and sideways in the compartment space due to vehicle collision [[Acceleration|accelerations]] and then impacts one or more surfaces (including the steering wheel) with velocity "V". According to the model, the vehicle (instead of the occupant) is the object that is accelerating. The occupant experiences no injury-producing force prior to contact with the compartment surfaces.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In stage two, the occupant is assumed to remain in contact with the compartment surface and experiences the same accelerations as the vehicle for the rest of the collision.  The occupant may sustain [[Blunt trauma|injury]] at the end of stage one based on the velocity of impact with the compartment surfaces and due to vehicle accelerations during stage two.  The occupant impact velocity and acceleration are computed from the vehicle collision acceleration history and the compartment geometry.  Finally, the hypothetical occupant impact velocity and acceleration are then compared to threshold values of [[Engineering tolerance|human tolerance]] to these forces.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Forschungszentrum Jülich''' ("Jülich Research Centre") is a member of the [[Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres]] and is one of the largest interdisciplinary research centres in [[Europe]]. It was founded on 11 December 1956 by the state of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] as a registered association, before it became "Kernforschungsanlage Jülich GmbH" or Nuclear Research Centre Jülich in 1967. In 1990, the name of the association was changed to "Forschungszentrum Jülich GmbH". It has close collaborations with [[RWTH Aachen]] in the form of [[RWTH Aachen#Jülich-Aachen Research Alliance (JARA)|Jülich-Aachen Research Alliance (JARA)]].

== Location ==
[[Image:Forschungszentrum Juelich-Lage.png|thumb|Location of Forschungszentrum Jülich in Germany]] Forschungszentrum Jülich is situated in the middle of the Stetternich Forest in [[Jülich]] ([[Düren (district)|Kreis Düren]], [[Rheinland]]) and covers an area of 2.2 square kilometres.

== Financing ==
The annual [[budget]] of Forschungszentrum Jülich is approximately € 530 million (in 2009). Public funds are split between the German Federal Government (90%) and the Federal State of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] (10%).

== Staff/size ==
Forschungszentrum Jülich employs more than 5,700 members of staff (2015) and works within the framework of the disciplines [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[medicine]] and [[engineering]] on the basic principles and applications in the areas of [[health]], [[information]], [[Environmental science|environment]] and [[energy]]. Amongst the members of staff, there are approx. 1,500 scientists including 400 PhD students and 130 diploma students. Around 600 people work in the administration and service areas, 500 work for project management agencies, and there are 1,600 technical staff members, while around 330 trainees are completing their training in more than 20 different professions.

More than 800 visiting scientists come to Forschungszentrum Jülich every year from about 50 different countries.

=== Training and apprenticeships ===
In 2003, 367 people were trained in 20 different professions at Forschungszentrum Jülich. The proportion of trainees lies around 9% and is more than twice as high as the German national average (for companies with more than 500 employees). In cooperation with [[RWTH Aachen University]] and Aachen University of Applied Sciences, Forschungszentrum Jülich also offers combined practical and academic courses. After they have successfully completed their exams, graduates are offered six months employment in their chosen profession. Between 1959 and 2007 around 3,800 trainees completed their training in more than 25 different professions.

No lectures are held at Forschungszentrum Jülich itself, but in line with the so-called "Jülich model", the directors of the institutes are appointed professors at nearby universities in a joint procedure with the Federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia (usually Aachen, Bonn, Cologne, Düsseldorf, but also universities farther away such as Duisburg-Essen or Münster). By holding a lectureship there, they can fulfil their teaching duties. Many other scientists at Forschungszentrum Jülich who have achieved habilitation also undertake lectureships in the nearby universities. In cooperation with the universities, what are known as "research schools" (e.g. "German Research School for Simulation Science" with [[RWTH Aachen|RWTH Aachen University]] or "International Helmholtz Research School of Biophysics and Soft Matter" with the universities of Cologne and Düsseldorf) are founded in an effort to support the scientific training of students.

An exception to this is the training of mathematical-technical assistants. In cooperation with Aachen University of Applied Sciences (Campus Jülich), the lectures required for the B.Sc. in "Scientific Programming" are largely held in the Central Institute for Applied Mathematics (ZAM) by university professors and ZAM instructors. For the subsequent M.Sc. in "Technomathematics", the same model applies and some of the lectures are held by ZAM staff.

Every year, Forschungszentrum Jülich hosts a two-week IFF Summer School, which addresses current issues in solid-state physics.

== Large-scale facilities at Forschungszentrum Jülich ==

=== Cooler Synchrotron COSY ===
'''COSY''' ('''Co'''oler '''Sy'''nchrotron) is a particle accelerator ([[synchrotron]]) and storage ring (circumference: 184 m) for accelerating [[proton]]s and [[deuteron]]s operated by the Institute of [[Nuclear physics|Nuclear Physics]] (IKP) at Forschungszentrum Jülich.

COSY is characterised by what is known as beam cooling, which reduces the deviation of particles from their predetermined path (can also be understood as the thermal motion of particles) using [[electron]] or [[stochastic]] cooling. At COSY there are a number of experimental facilities for studies in the field of [[hadron]] physics. These include the ANKE magnetic spectrometer, the TOF flight spectrometer and the WASA universal detector, which was moved to COSY from the CELSIUS storage ring of The Svedberg Laboratoriet (TSL) in Uppsala, Sweden in 2005.    

COSY is one of the only accelerators in the medium energy range with both electron cooling and stochastic cooling.

The synchrotron is used by scientists from German and international research institutions at internal and external target stations. It is one of the research facilities used for collaborative research supported by the [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Germany)]].

=== Research reactor FRJ-2 ===
[[File:Forschungsreaktor Jülich 2.jpg|right|thumb|Research reactor FRJ-2]]'''FRJ-2''' was a reactor of the same class as [[DIDO (nuclear reactor)|DIDO]] and was used for [[neutron]] scattering experiments. It has been operated by the Central [[Research reactor|Research Reactors]] Division (ZFR). FRJ-2 was the strongest [[neutron source]] in the [[Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres|Helmholtz Association]] and it was primarily used to conduct scattering and spectroscopic experiments on [[condensed matter]].
On May 2, 2006, FRJ-2 was shut down after almost 44 years or 18,875 days of operation. The experiments at FRJ-2 were dismantled bit by bit and transferred to Jülich's outstation at the [[FRM II]] research reactor in Garching near Munich.

In May 2006, the Jülich Centre for Neutron Science JCNS was founded as response to the shut down of FRJ-2. JCNS operates instruments at the national and international leading sources FRM II, Institut Laue-Langevin in Grenoble, France, and Spallation Neutron Source SNS in OakRidge, USA, under a common scientific objective and provides external users with access to world class instruments under standardized conditions. The breadth of JCNS is comparable to a facility based around a medium flux research reactor, though it offers the quality of high flux sources. JCNS also provides a frame for the method and instrument development program of FZJ and for its in-house research in the condensed matter and key technology programmes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jcns.info/about_jcns/ JCNS about] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716093737/http://www.jcns.info/about_jcns |date=2011-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Supercomputers ===
The following [[supercomputer]]s are all operated in Jülich by the Central Institute for Applied Mathematics (ZAM) within the framework of the [[John von Neumann]] Institute for Computing (NIC).

==== JUGENE - Petascale BlueGene/P system ====
From autumn 2007 the [[JUGENE]], an IBM [[Blue Gene#Blue Gene/P|Blue Gene/P]] computer is running and was officially started in February 2008.  Its 65,000 processors reached 220 TFLOPS. It started out as the fastest computer in Europe and the second fastest in the world. On May 26, 2009, the newly upgraded JUGENE was unveiled. It includes 294 912 processor cores, 144 [[terabyte]] memory, 6 [[petabyte]] storage in 72 racks. With a peak performance of about one [[FLOPS|PetaFLOPS]], it was the third fastest computer and fastest computer in Europe&lt;ref name="top500jun09"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://top500.org/list/2009/06/100|title=Top500 List - June 2009 - TOP500 Supercomputer Sites|publisher=|accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it currently (November 2010) is the ninth fastest supercomputer in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://top500.org/site/649/list/36 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202010849/http://top500.org/site/649/list/36 |archivedate=2010-12-02 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

==== JUROPA ====
JuRoPA (''Jülich Research on Petascale Architecture'') is an Intel Xeon X5570 based [[Cluster (computing)|Cluster]] supercomputer with a peak performance of 308 TFLOPS and 79 [[terabyte]] main memory; in June 2009 it was the 10th fastest computer of the world and the second fastest (after JUGENE) in Europe.&lt;ref name="top500jun09"/&gt; It currently (November 2010) is the 23rd fastest supercomputer worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.top500.org/list/2009/11/100|title=Top500 List - November 2009 - TOP500 Supercomputer Sites|publisher=|accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== JUBL ====
'''JUBL''' (''Jülich BlueGene/L'') was a massively parallel [[supercomputer]], based on IBMs [[Blue Gene|Blue Gene/L]] architecture, with 16,384&amp;nbsp;[[Central Processing Unit|processors]] (8192&amp;nbsp;nodes each with two processors) and an [[Primary storage|internal memory]] of 4.1&amp;nbsp;[[Byte|terabytes]] (512&amp;nbsp;megabytes per node). It was capable of a peak performance (R&lt;sub&gt;peak&lt;/sub&gt;) of 45.87&amp;nbsp;[[FLOPS|TFLOPS]]. The [[LINPACK]] performance (R&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) is 37.33 TFLOPS. At the time when it officially went into operation, JUBL was the 6th most powerful computer in the world.

==== JUICE ====
Since spring 2007, '''JUICE''' (Juelich Initiative Cell Cluster) has been in operation. It is a cluster based on IBMs [[Cell microprocessor]]. Twelve [[IBM_BladeCenter#QS20|QS20]] blades with 24 Cell CPUs and 12GB RAM provide a peak LINPACK performance of 4.8&amp;nbsp;TFLOP/s. The cluster uses [[Mellanox]] 4x [[Infiniband]] cards and a 24-port Voltaire switch for highspeed communication.

==== IBM p690 Cluster Jump ====
The massively parallel supercomputer '''[[IBM]] p690 Cluster Jump''' has been in operation since the beginning of 2004.

With 1312&amp;nbsp;processors (41&amp;nbsp;nodes each with 32&amp;nbsp;processors) and an internal memory of 5&amp;nbsp;terabytes (128&amp;nbsp;gigabytes per node), the computer can achieve a maximum performance of 5.6&amp;nbsp;TFLOPS, which placed it at number 21 in the list of the most powerful computers in the world at the time of its inauguration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://top500.org/site/649/list/23 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202011847/http://top500.org/site/649/list/23 |archivedate=2010-12-02 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; The nodes are linked to each other through a high performance switch (HPS). Through a globally parallel data system, applications have access to more than 60&amp;nbsp;terabytes of storage space and an integrated cassette storage with a capacity of one petabyte. The IBM p690 Cluster Jump is run on the [[IBM AIX|AIX]]&amp;nbsp;5.1 [[operating system]].

A new building (1,000&amp;nbsp;m²) was built especially for the IBM p690 Cluster Jump beside the Central Institute for Applied Mathematics.

==== CRAY SV1ex ====
''No longer in operation''

The vector computer '''[[Cray|CRAY]] SV1ex''' was the successor of CRAY J90, which was in operation between 1996 and 2002. It represented the next stage in the computer series of the parallel vector computers with a shared memory, CRAY X-MP, Y-MP and C90.
With 16 [[Central Processing Unit|CPU]]s and an internal memory of 32 [[Byte|gigabytes]], the CRAY SV1ex had a performance of 32 [[Flops|GFLOPS]]. It was run on the [[Unicos|UNICOS]] 10.0 operating system.  This computer was decommissioned on June 30, 2005.

==== CRAY J90 ====
''No longer in operation''

The vector computer '''CRAY J90''' was used as a [[file server]]. It had 12 [[Central Processing Unit|processors]], an internal memory of 2 [[Byte|gigabytes]] and boasted a performance of 3 GFLOPS. CRAY J90 was also run on UNICOS 10.0 and it too was decommissioned on June 30, 2005.

'''TEXTOR''' ('''T'''okamak '''EX'''periment for '''T'''echnology '''O'''riented '''R'''esearch) was a [[tokamak]] in the field of [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]-wall interaction operated by the Institute of Energy Research - [[Plasma (physics)|Plasma Physics]] (IEK-4) at Forschungszentrum Jülich.

Until it was decommissioned in December 2013, TEXTOR was used for research into [[nuclear fusion]]. In experiments, [[hydrogen]] was heated to a temperature of up to 50 megakelvins so that it took the form of a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. Studies of the interaction of this plasma with the surrounding wall constituted a major part of the research performed. The knowledge gained is mainly being applied to a new experimental reactor, [[ITER]], which is currently under construction in Cadarache (South France) with the help of Forschungszentrum Jülich among others.

=== Magnetic resonance tomography ===
The Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine (INM-4) houses several magnetic resonance scanners, the largest of which is a 9.4 [[Tesla (unit)|tesla]] combined [[Positron emission tomography|PET]]-[[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] machine for scanning humans, which is one of the highest field devices in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fz-juelich.de/inm/inm-4/EN/UeberUns/Einrichtungen/_node.html Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine (INM-4): Facilities&lt;/ref&gt; The institute also houses a 3T combined PET-MR system, a 3T and a 4T MR system, all for human use, and a 9.4T small-animal scanner.

=== SAPHIR Atmosphere Simulation Chamber===
[[Image:Simulation Atmosphärischer Photochemie in einer großen Reaktionskammer.jpg|thumb|SAPHIR]]In the 20-meter long '''[[SAPHIR]]''' chamber ('''S'''imulation of '''A'''tmospheric '''PH'''otochemistry '''I'''n a large '''R'''eaction Chamber), a group in the Institute of Chemistry and Dynamics of the [[Geosphere]] - [[Troposphere]] (ICG-II) investigates photochemical reactions in the [[atmosphere]].

=== PhyTec experimental facility for cultivating plants ===
Since 2003, a greenhouse with cutting-edge technology has been available at Forschungszentrum Jülich.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fz-juelich.de/icg/icg-3/datapool/general/PhyTec_eng_internetQualitaet.pdf Flyer (PDF)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927003158/http://www.fz-juelich.de/icg/icg-3/datapool/general/PhyTec_eng_internetQualitaet.pdf |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum transparency of the panels (over 95%) is achieved in the spectral range important for photosynthesis thanks to a special type of glass and an anti-reflective coating. Moreover, [[ultraviolet|UV-B rays]] can pass through the glass panels. The [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] concentration can be increased and decreased in two chambers, the [[humidity]] can be varied, and the temperatures can be kept at 25&amp;nbsp;°C, even in summer when the sun is constantly shining. Scientists at the Institute of Chemistry and Dynamics of the [[Geosphere]] - Phytosphere (ICG-III) simulate different climate scenarios here and investigate their influence on the key processes in plants, such as growth, transport, exchange processes with the atmosphere and soil, and biotic interactions.

=== Beamlines at synchrotrons ===
The Peter Grünberg Institute (PGI) supports a number of beamlines for research with synchrotron radiation at various synchrotrons:
* BL5 U-250-PGM at [[Delta (research lab)|DELTA]] (Dortmund)
* UE56/1-SGM at [[BESSY]] (Berlin)
* MuCAT at APS (Argonne, USA)
* JUSIFA at [[HASYLAB]] (Hamburg)
* NanoESCA beamline [[Elettra]] (Trieste, Italy)

== Further research projects at Forschungszentrum Jülich ==

=== CLaMS: Atmosphere Model for Climate Research ===
Understanding the chemical processes in the atmosphere is the basis of many climate models. 
Environmental researchers at Forschungszentrum Jülich investigate the chemistry of the atmosphere with airplanes, balloons and satellites. 
They use their findings to generate chemical models such as [[CLaMS]], which are then used in simulations on supercomputers.

=== MEM-BRAIN: carbon dioxide separation  ===
Together with its research partners, Forschungszentrum Jülich is developing ceramic membranes. These membranes could be put to use as filters in power plants, which would separate process gases and effectively retain carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.co2separation.de/|title=CO2Separation|publisher=|accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== UNICORE: easy access to computing resources ===
Today, computing and storage resources are often split between a number of computer systems, computer centres or even between different countries. Science and industry therefore need tools that will allow easy and secure access to these resources. UNICORE [https://web.archive.org/web/20070811215938/http://www.fz-juelich.de/zam/grid/] from Jülich is one such [[Grid computing|grid-based]] software package.

== Infrastructure ==
As well as research institutions and large-scale facilities, Forschungszentrum Jülich has a variety of infrastructure units and central institutions that it needs for its day-to-day operations, including:

* Finance and Controlling Division (F)
* Personnel Division (P)
* Legal and Patent Division (R)
* Operation Management Division (B)

The '''Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel''' ('''WGEEP'''), also known as the '''Gadgil Commission''' after its chairman [[Madhav Gadgil]], was an environmental research commission appointed by the [[Ministry of Environment and Forests (India)|Ministry of Environment and Forests]] of India. The commission submitted the report to the [[Government of India]] on 31 August 2011. The Expert Panel approached the project through a set of tasks such as:
# Compilation of readily available information about [[Western Ghats]]
# Development of Geo-spatial database based on environmental sensitivity, and
# Consultation with Government bodies and Civil society groups.&lt;ref name="Ref 1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the Western Ghats, Ecology Expert Panel|url=http://moef.nic.in/downloads/public-information/wg-23052012.pdf|work=Madhav Gadgil Commission|publisher=The Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India|accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People in Kerala, especially [[Christian]] organizations, strongly protested the implementation of the report since most of the farmers in the hilly regions are Christians, especially in [[Wayanad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Church’s stand on Gadgil report wrong| url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/kerala/%E2%80%98Church%E2%80%99s-stand-on-Gadgil-report-wrong%E2%80%99/2013/05/05/article1575590.ece|newspaper=The Indian Express|date=5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kerala priests and politicians unite to oppose Gadgil report on Western Ghats|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/gadgil-report-western-ghats-politcians-and-church-unite-to-oppose/1/316622.html|publisher=India Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During the 20th century, a very large number of Christians had migrated from [[Travancore|southern Kerala]] and acquired forest land in Wayanad and other areas with abundant forest and waste land, in what is known as [[Malabar Migration]]. The Gagdil Committee report was criticised for being excessively environment-friendly and not in tune with the ground realities.&lt;ref name="rediff.com"&gt;http://www.rediff.com/news/interview/the-kasturirangan-report-is-a-disaster-for-the-western-ghats/20131230.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Major recommendations of Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel (WGEEP) ==
*  The panel recommended a National-level authority, Western Ghats Ecology Authority (WGEA).

The report was considered by [[UNESCO]], which added the 39 serial sites of the Western Ghats on the [[World Heritage List]].&lt;ref name="econtimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-10-18/news/43178612_1_hlwg-western-ghats-gadgil-committee|title=MoEF approves Kasturirangan panel report on Western Ghats|date=2013-10-18|location=New Delhi|newspaper=[[The Economic Times]]|publisher=[[The Times Group]]|agency=[[Press Trust of India]]|accessdate=2014-01-08|deadurl=no|archivedate=2014-01-08|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140108131023/http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-10-18/news/43178612_1_hlwg-western-ghats-gadgil-committee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kasturirangan Report==
The [[Kasturirangan committee report]] has sought to balance the two concerns of development and environment protection, by watering down the environmental regulation regime proposed by the Western Ghats Ecology Experts Panel’s Gadgil report in 2012. The Kasturirangan report seeks to bring just 37% of the Western Ghats under the Ecologically Sensitive Area (ESA) zones — down from the 64% suggested by the Gadgil report.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/paradise-lost/article1-1179300.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;
Dr. V.S. Vijayan, member of the Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel (WGEEP) said recommendations of the Kasturirangan report are undemocratic and anti-environmental.&lt;ref name="rediff.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=‘Kasturirangan report is anti-environmental’|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kasturirangan-report-is-antienvironmental/article5533619.ece|publisher=The Hindu Newspaper|accessdate=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A crucial report on Western Ghats prepared by [[K. Kasturirangan]]-led high-level working group (HLWG) has recommended prohibition on development activities in 60,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ecologically sensitive area spread over Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Goa, Kerala and Tamil Nadu.

The 10-member panel, constituted to examine the Western Ghats ecology expert panel report prepared under the leadership of environmentalist Madhav Gadgil, has also moved away from the suggestions of the Gadgil panel.

The Gadgil panel had recommended a blanket approach consisting of guidelines for sector-wise activities, which could be permitted in the ecologically sensitive zones.

===Livelihood options===
“Environmentally sound development cannot preclude livelihood and economic options for this region... The answer (to the question of how to manage and conserve the Ghats) will not lie in removing these economic options, but in providing better incentives to move them towards greener and more sustainable practices,” the HLWG report says.

The panel submitted the report to Environment Minister Jayanthi Natarajan.

===Prohibitory regime===
Roughly 37 per cent of the total area defined as the boundary of the Western Ghats is ecologically sensitive. Over this area of some 60,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, spread over the States of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, the working group has recommended a prohibitory regime on those activities with maximum interventionist and destructive impact on the environment, the panel says in its report.

The Working Group was constituted to advise the government on the recommendations of an earlier report of ecologist Madhav Gadgil-led "Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel" (WGEEP).

The WGEEP had recommended 64% of Western Ghats to be declared as an ecologically sensitive area. It had suggested three levels of categorization where regulatory measures for protection would be imposed and had recommended the establishment of the Western Ghats Ecology Authority for management of the Ghats.

The 10-member Working Group, headed by [[Planning Commission (India)|Planning Commission]] member Kasturirangan, has environmental experts and other professionals as its members.

“''The Western Ghats is a biological treasure trove that is endangered, and it needs to be protected and regenerated, indeed celebrated for its enormous wealth of endemic species and natural beauty''”, the report says.

Natarajan said that the recommendations would be looked into urgently so that action can be taken to address these challenges.

Kasturirangan said, “''The message of this report is serious, alarming and urgent. It is imperative that we protect, manage and regenerate the lands now remaining in the Western Ghats as biologically rich, diverse, natural landscapes''”.

==Green Economics==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Kennet Tickell.jpeg|thumb|left|Institute Founder and CEO Miriam Kennet with Sir Crispin Tickell and Oliver Tickell at Oxford University]] --&gt;
As defined by the Green Economics Institute, green economics is "Progressive Economics, reclaiming economics for all people everywhere - women, nature, other species, the planet and its systems".&lt;ref name="greeneconomics.org.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name=6conf&gt;[http://www.gef.eu/fileadmin/user_upload/Green_Economics_Conference_flyer_July_2011.pdf Green Economics Institute: 6th Annual Green Economics Conference at Oxford University] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304023853/http://gef.eu/fileadmin/user_upload/Green_Economics_Conference_flyer_July_2011.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inderscience.com/www/conf/2012jul_ijge_growth_rio_uk_110.pdf Green Economics Institute Seventh Annual Green Economics Conference at Oxford University]&lt;/ref&gt;

Green Economics Institute Founder and CEO Miriam Kennet describes green economics as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Green Economics is the green movement's challenge to mainstream orthodoxy in economics and it is gaining ground globally and in the corridors of power as the best alternative to solving climate change, the credit crunch, poverty and biodiversity losses. It is about providing reclaiming the practices and policies of economics, for all people everywhere, nature, other species, the planet and its systems. It is about provisioning for the needs, impacts, effects and responsibilities, for everyone and everything on the planet.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Founders==
[[File:GEIWorkshop.jpg|thumb|right|An interactive Green Economics workshop in Petersfield, July 2011]]

The Green Economics Institute was founded by Miriam Kennet and Volker Heinemann in 2004.

'''Miriam Kennet''', co-founder, director and CEO, received an MAIB in Economics and International Business from [[South Bank University]], and most recently an MSC in Environmental Science and Economics from the [[University of Oxford]]. She has researched into environmental economics at [[South Bank University]], Oxford University, and [[Keele University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.micandidate.eu/candidate.aspx?idcandidate=2705 ]{{dead link|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greeneconomics.org.uk/page34.html |title=Miriam Kennet |publisher=Green Economics |date= |accessdate=2013-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Volker Heinemann''', co-founder and director of the Institute, holds a master's degree in Economics. He is a former German Green Councillor and is currently an associate editor of the ''[[International Journal of Green Economics]]''&lt;ref&gt; www.inderscience.com/jge&lt;/ref&gt; He is author of ''Die Oekonomie der Zukunft'', a book that investigates future economic trends in the developed world. It is based on the idea that a new economic science, free from any neo-liberal or other normative bias is needed: green economics.&lt;ref name="greeneconomics5"/&gt;

'''Michelle Gale (USA)''' is our current Non Executive Director and has been in post for 10 years.
She heads up our COP UNFCC Climate Delegations Diplomacy and also is the co -author and editor of many  of our books. She is a specialist in International Relations, and Economics and Human Rights Law and gender issues.

'''Professor Maria Madi''' (Brazil) heads up our academic work at the www.geiacademy.org. &lt;ref&gt; www.geiacademy.org &lt;/ref&gt;. She is a specialist and Professor of international finance.

'''The Green Economics Institute Trust'''
The Green Economics Institute Trust, greeneconomicsinstitutetrust.org, is a Registered Charity No 111768 (Ref: The Charities Commission) which was founded in 2009 by Judith Felton with founding trustees, Jacob Sanders, Miriam Kennet, Volker Heinemann and others.
Its board of trustees is very active and holds regular Exhibition Stands roughly one a month around Europe to advise people what they can do to implement our research and ideas. The Charity  spreads its ideas by educating the public in all aspects of Green Economics and Social and Environmental Justice, in particular it shared the  offices with '''Launchpad''' a charity for the homeless, and also with the '''Ethical Property Company'''.

'''Social Justice'''
It has supported the  publication of numerous books on aspects of social justice, for Example The Philosophy of Social Justice which was very popular at the Paris UNFCC COP21 Climate Conference showing the link between social justice, diversity and solving climate change issues. It also publishes regularly on climate change and supports the publication of books on the green economy.

The Trust has also been active in the migration debate- promoting the idea of '''Changing the Narrative of Migration''' with 4 conferences on the subject and academic papers and a book '''{{ISBN|9781907543210}}'''&lt;ref&gt; {{ISBN|9781907543210}} &lt;/ref&gt; discussing other ways of looking at migration and its true history, believing that xenophobia and intolerance are contrary to the introduction of a green economy. More information about the Green Economics Institute Trust can be found at its website www.greeneconomicsinstitutetrust.org 
&lt;ref&gt;www.greeneconomicsinstitutetrust.org &lt;/ref&gt;. Its email is &lt;ref&gt; info@greeneconomicsinstitutetrust.org&lt;/ref&gt; greeneconomicsinstitutetrust.org.

'''Mental Health and Sustainability'''
The Trust is also very active in promoting mental health as a very important factor in understanding the human difficulty in changing track and stopping runnaway climate change, pollution and a range of difficult subjects. It works with a range of top pyschiatrists and many of them inform the profession and government on this issue. We have also published a book on Health, ''The Greening of Health and Healthcare, which has been very influential not least being used by  Chinese government official when planning the next phase of health developments in China.
''
'''Law: Whose Law is it anyway?''' 
The Trust is very active in philosophy and the law internationally, working with many partner lawyers. It is currently engaged in a round of lectures, talking about how many of the worlds worst ever atrocities have been committed under the cover of the ruling laws or governments so that victims have no recourse to law whilst this has taken place. We are advising people to consider, who is the law for and who does it protect, and who has access to it. It is necessary to sort this out if we are considering the role of the commons, and the rights of ordinary people to access ordinary resources, water for example, so ''Whose Law is it anyway?'' is a major project developing at the institute led by '''Maria Fernanda Madi''' (Brazil and the Netherlands).

'''Diversity'''
The Trust has always promoted diversity in all its activities, publications and events, as well as acting as a beacon for others. It is currently advising several other Institutions on how to achieve and maintain real diversity in organisations as a means of ensuring social and environmental justice.

''''''Chair of Trustees'''''' is Marlyn Lee - Hughes, more information can be found at:  greeneconomicsinstitutetrust.org. She is a specialist in both science, trained at Edinburgh and a lecturer in English. Mrs Hughes runs our Registered Charity The Green Economics Institute Trust and its work in 
'''Educating the Public in all aspects of Green Economics and Social and Environmental Justice.''

==Research and Conferences==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:GEICollage.jpg|thumb|left|A collage depicting Green Economics conferences and awards ceremonies]] --&gt;
The Green Economics Institute's Green Economics Research is focused on three key aspects:&lt;ref name=key101 /&gt;
# The reform of mainstream [[economics]] by means of robust research into alternatives and existing theories, and how these can be made more relevant and practical.&lt;ref name=key101 /&gt;
# The creation and development of the new "Greening the Economy" discourse of [[Green economy|green economics]].&lt;ref name=key101 /&gt;
# Research into policy formulation and implementation which would provide economics with the philosophy, methodology, ontology and instruments to bring social and environmental justice.&lt;ref name=key101 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8563">'''Gross out''' describes a [[art movement|movement]] in art (often comic), which aims to shock&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eyman|first=Louis Giannetti, Scott|title=Flashback : a brief history of USA|year=2010|publisher=Pearson Education/Allyn &amp; Bacon|location=Boston, MA|isbn=0-205-69590-6|pages=379|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt; and disgust the [[audience]] with controversial material such as [[toilet humour]], [[nudity]], or any sexual topic.

== Cinema ==

===Features===
Gross-out is a [[genre|subgenre]] of comedy movies in which the makers employ humor that is willfully "tasteless"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pryor]|first=Joe Garner ; foreword by Richard|title=Made you laugh! : the funniest moments in radio, television, stand-up, and movie comedy|year=2004|publisher=Andrews McMeel Pub.|location=Kansas City|isbn=0-7407-4695-2|pages=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;  or even downright disgusting. It usually involves gratuitous nudity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Capsuto|first=Steven|title=Alternate channels : the uncensored story of gay and lesbian images on radio and television|year=2000|publisher=Ballantine Books|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-345-41243-5|pages=250|edition=1.}}&lt;/ref&gt; unrealistic aggressiveness towards property or [[Schadenfreude]]. The movies are generally aimed at a younger audience aged between 18 and 24.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=King|first=Geoff|title=Film comedy|year=2002|publisher=Wallflower|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=1-903364-35-3|pages=73|edition=repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; One boon of this genre is that it provides an inexpensive way to make a movie "edgy" and to generate media attention for it.

===History===
In the United States, following the abolition of the film industry's censorious [[Production Code]] and its replacement with the [[MPAA film rating system]] in the late 1960s, some filmmakers began to experiment with subversive&lt;ref name= "Mitchell03"&gt;{{cite news | last = Mitchell | first = Elvis | authorlink = Elvis Mitchell | title = Revisiting Faber College (Toga, Toga, Toga!) | work = [[The New York Times]] | pages =  | language = | publisher = | date=25 August 2003 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/25/movies/critic-s-notebook-revisiting-faber-college-toga-toga-toga.html | accessdate = 2011-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; film comedies, which explicitly dealt with taboo subjects such as sex and other bodily functions.  Noteworthy examples include 1972's ''[[Pink Flamingos]]'' (in which the central character eats dog excrement) and other films by [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]], and 1974's sketch comedy film ''[[The Groove Tube]]''. As these films emerged from the [[counterculture]] movement and gained a measure of audience success,&lt;ref name="Mitchell03"/&gt; they inspired more mainstream films to follow their example. However, long before the Production Code, early silent comedy film makers produced and attempted several 'gross-out' pictures to the disdain of early film reviewers. One such example is the [[lost film|lost]] ''[[Nell's Eugenic Wedding]]'' starring [[Fay Tincher]] and [[Tod Browning]].

The label "gross-out movie" was first applied by the mainstream media to [[1978 in film|1978]]'s ''[[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]]'s [[Animal House]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bernheimer|first=Kathryn|title=The 50 funniest movies of all time : a critic's ranking|year=1999|publisher=Carol Pub. Group|location=Secaucus, N.J.|isbn=0-8065-2091-4|pages=109–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; a comedy about the [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] experience at [[Higher education in the United States|US colleges]].&lt;ref name="Mitchell03"/&gt; Its humor included not only explicit use of bodily functions (like projectile vomiting), but also references to topical political matters like [[Kent State shootings]], [[Richard Nixon]], the [[Vietnam war]], and the [[Civil rights movement#Civil rights movement in the United States|civil rights movement]].&lt;ref name= "Peterson"&gt;{{cite news | last = Peterson | first = Molly | title = ''National Lampoon's Animal House'' | work = [[National Public Radio]] | date = July 29, 2002 | url = https://www.npr.org/programs/morning/features/patc/animalhouse/ | accessdate = 2010-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was a great [[box office]] success despite its limited production costs and thus started an industry trend.&lt;ref name="Mitchell03"/&gt; Since then, gross-out films increased in number, and became almost the norm for American comedy films. Some films of this genre could be aimed at teen audiences (such as ''[[Superbad (film)|Superbad]]'', ''[[Porky's]]'', ''[[American Pie (series)|American Pie]]'' or ''[[Eurotrip]]''), while others are targeted at somewhat more mature audiences (such as ''[[There's Something About Mary]]'', ''[[The Hangover (film)|The Hangover]]'' or ''[[Wedding Crashers]]'').

== Television ==
{{advert|date=June 2012}}

''The Tom Green Show and [[Jackass (TV series)|Jackass]]'' and its UK cousin, ''[[Dirty Sanchez (television series)|Dirty Sanchez]]'', were the pioneers of "gross out television".  The shows featured dangerous [[stunts]], [[nudity]], [[profanity]], and action new to the television platform. Both series were featured on [[MTV]], and progressed to feature-length movies.  ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head]]'', ''[[The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show]]'', [[Rugrats]], [[Rocko's Modern Life]],  [[Aaahh!!! Real Monsters]], and ''[[Animaniacs]]'' transferred the gross-out television genre to the medium of small screen [[animation]] largely in the early 1990s. Today this continues with such shows as ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[Family Guy]]'', ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[Futurama]]'', ''[[Rick and Morty]]'', [[Regular Show]], [[American Dad!]] and ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]''.

== Theater ==

Gross-out [[theater]] is increasingly practiced on stage, particularly in the [[Edinburgh Festival]]. However, it is also displayed in the larger and more adventurous [[United Kingdom|British]] theaters.

The prime examples of the above are the stage version of the contemporary drama ''[[Trainspotting (novel)#Stage adaptation|Trainspotting]]'' by bestselling playwright and author [[Irvine Welsh]]; the controversial New York musical ''[[Urinetown]]'' by Kotis and Hollmann; the outrageous [[anarchistic]] schlockomedy (shock horror comedy) musical about a Manchester jobcentre ''Restart'' by Komedy Kollective;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.komedykollective.com komedykollective.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and performances by another United Kingdom-based act, Forced Entertainment, who devised the [[iconic]] theatrical [[gorefest]] ''Bloody Mess''.

== Art ==

Controversial American cartoonist and vaudeville performer [[Basil Wolverton]] invented his trademark "[[spaghetti]] and [[meatball]]s" style of artwork.

Various artists helped create a flourishing gross-out art scene, which began mainly in the 1990s, the most famous of which were [[Damien Hirst]], known for encasing mutilated, rotting [[cattle]] in [[formaldehyde]], and making art of [[endangered]] [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] [[species]] such as [[shark]]s in formaldehyde tanks, and [[Tracey Emin]], whose [[Art exhibition|exhibit]] of an unmade [[bed]] featured used [[tampons]], [[condoms]] and blood-stained [[underwear]].

== Music ==

Gross out themes are common in popular music genres, such as [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[hard rock]], where shock value helps create marketable notoriety.  Bands include [[Blink-182]] famous for including [[breast]] and [[fart]] jokes in their songs, while bands such as [[Cannibal Corpse]] and [[Agoraphobic Nosebleed]] write extremely revolting lyrics designed to induce nausea and shock the music world.

Probably the biggest gross-out shock to the music world was the act of [[GG Allin]]. Allin was infamous for his transgressive music act, which included eating excrement, mutilating himself and attacking audience members.

Sometimes the line between truth and [[urban myth]] is blurred by the [[sensationalist]] sections of the media.  For example, [[Frank Zappa]] never ate steaming excrement live on-stage, and the famed incident involving [[Ozzy Osbourne]] biting a head off of a bat was actually unintentional (he thought the bat was a prop).

Similar themes are also sometimes conveyed in music videos, the aptly named Gross Out, a [[Single (music)|single]] from [[indie (music)|indie]]/[[garage rock]] band, [[The Vines (band)|The Vines]].

==School webcam controversy==
In the 2010 ''[[Robbins v. Lower Merion School District]]'' case, plaintiffs charged two suburban Philadelphia high schools secretly spied on students by surreptitiously and remotely activating webcams embedded in school-issued laptops the students were using at home, and therefore infringed on their privacy rights.  The schools admitted to secretly snapping over 66,000 webshots and screenshots, including webcam shots of students in their bedrooms.&lt;ref name="USATODAY"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2010/02/school-district-accused-of-issuing-webcam-laptops-to-spy-on-students/1|author=Doug Stanglin|title=School district accused of spying on kids via laptop webcams|date=February 18, 2010|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=February 19, 2010|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AKsnVJzj|archivedate=August 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"&gt;{{cite web|title=Initial LANrev System Findings|url=http://lmsd.org/documents/news/100503_l3_report.pdf|website=Lower Merion School District|accessdate=17 October 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615100827/http://lmsd.org/documents/news/100503_l3_report.pdf|archivedate=15 June 2010|format=PDF|date=May 2010|quote=LMSD Redacted Forensic Analysis, L-3 Services – prepared for [[Ballard Spahr]] (LMSD's counsel)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perbix had previously praised Theft Track, the name of the feature that lets administrators remotely photograph potential thieves if a computer is reported stolen, noting in a YouTube video he produced that: &lt;blockquote&gt;It’s an excellent feature. Yes, we have used it, and yes, it has gleaned some results for us. But it, in and of itself, is just a fantastic feature for trying to—especially when you’re in a school environment and you have a lot of laptops and you’re worried about, you know, laptops getting up and missing. I’ve actually had some laptops we thought were stolen which actually were still in a classroom, because they were misplaced, and by the time we found out they were back, I had to turn the tracking off. And I had, you know, a good twenty snapshots of the teacher and students using the machines in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2010/2/24/headlines/fbi_us_attorney_probing_penn_school_districts_computer_spying |title=FBI, US Attorney Probing Penn.

'''Hydraulic engineering''' as a sub-discipline of [[civil engineering]] is concerned with the flow and conveyance of [[fluid]]s, principally [[water]] and sewage. One feature of these systems is the extensive use of gravity as the motive force to cause the movement of the fluids. This area of civil engineering is intimately related to the design of [[bridge]]s, [[dam]]s, [[Channel (geography)|channel]]s, [[canal]]s, and [[levee]]s, and to both sanitary and [[environmental engineering]].

Hydraulic engineering is the application of the principles of fluid mechanics to problems dealing with the collection, storage, control, transport, regulation, measurement, and use of water.&lt;ref name="Prasuhn, Alan L. 1987"&gt;Prasuhn, Alan L. ''Fundamentals of Hydraulic Engineering''. Holt, Rinehart, and Winston: New York, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Before beginning a hydraulic engineering project, one must figure out how much water is involved. The hydraulic engineer is concerned with the transport of sediment by the river, the interaction of the water with its alluvial boundary, and the occurrence of scour and deposition.&lt;ref name="Prasuhn, Alan L. 1987"/&gt;  "The hydraulic engineer actually develops conceptual  designs for the various features which interact with water such as spillways and outlet works for dams, culverts for highways, canals and related structures for irrigation projects,  and cooling-water facilities for [[thermal power plant]]s."  &lt;ref&gt;Cassidy, John J., Chaudhry, M. Hanif, and Roberson, John A. "Hydraulic Engineering", John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fundamental principles==

A few examples of the fundamental principles of hydraulic engineering include [[fluid mechanics]], [[fluid]] flow, behavior of real fluids, [[hydrology]], pipelines, open channel hydraulics, mechanics of [[sediment]] transport, physical modeling, hydraulic machines, and drainage hydraulics.

=== Fluid mechanics ===

''Fundamentals of Hydraulic Engineering'' defines hydrostatics as the study of fluids at rest.&lt;ref name="Prasuhn, Alan L. 1987"/&gt; In a fluid at rest, there exists a force, known as pressure, that acts upon the fluid's surroundings. This pressure, measured in N/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, is not constant throughout the body of fluid. Pressure, p, in a given body of fluid, increases with an increase in depth. Where the upward force on a body acts on the base and can be found by the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;p=\rho gy&lt;/math&gt;

where, 
:''&amp;rho;'' = density of water
:''g'' = specific gravity
:''y'' = depth of the body of liquid

Rearranging this equation gives you the [[pressure head]] ''p/&amp;rho;g'' = ''y''. Four basic devices for [[pressure measurement]] are a [[piezometer]], [[manometer]], differential manometer, [[Bourdon gauge]], as well as an inclined manometer.&lt;ref name="Prasuhn, Alan L. 1987"/&gt;

As Prasuhn states:&lt;br /&gt;
:On undisturbed submerged bodies, pressure acts along all surfaces of a body in a liquid, causing equal perpendicular forces in the body to act against the pressure of the liquid. This reaction is known as equilibrium. More advanced applications of pressure are that on plane surfaces, curved surfaces, dams, and quadrant gates, just to name a few.&lt;ref name="Prasuhn, Alan L. 1987"/&gt;

=== Behavior of real fluids ===

==== Real and ideal fluids ====

The main difference between an ideal fluid and a real fluid is that for ideal flow ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and for real flow ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Ideal fluid is incompressible and has no viscosity. Real fluid has viscosity. Ideal fluid is only an imaginary fluid as all fluids that exist have some viscosity.

==== Viscous flow ====

A viscous fluid will deform continuously under to  a shear force by the pascles law, whereas an ideal fluid doesn't deform.

==== Laminar flow and turbulence ====

The various effects of disturbance on a viscous flow are stable, transition and unstable.

==== Bernoulli's equation ====

For an ideal fluid, [[Bernoulli's equation]] holds along streamlines.

''p/&amp;rho;g'' + ''u''²/2''g'' = ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/''&amp;rho;g'' + ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;²/2''g'' = ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/ρ''g'' + ''u''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;²/2''g''

==== Boundary layer ====

Assuming a flow is bounded on one side only, and that a rectilinear flow passing over a stationary flat plate which lies parallel to the flow, the flow just upstream of the plate has a uniform velocity. As the flow comes into contact with the plate, the layer of fluid actually 'adheres' to a solid surface. There is then a considerable shearing action between the layer of fluid on the plate surface and the second layer of fluid. The second layer is therefore forced to decelerate (though it is not quite brought to rest), creating a shearing action with the third layer of fluid, and so on. As the fluid passes further along the plate, the zone in which shearing action occurs tends to spread further outwards. This zone is known as the 'boundary layer'. The flow outside the boundary layer is free of shear and viscous-related forces so it is assumed to act like an ideal fluid. The intermolecular cohesive forces in a fluid are not great enough to hold fluid together.  Hence a fluid will flow under the action of the slightest stress and flow will continue as long as the stress is present.&lt;ref name="Finnemore"&gt;E. John Finnemore, Joseph Franzini "Fluid Mechanics with Engineering Applications",McGraw-Hill,2002&lt;/ref&gt; The flow inside the layer can be either viscous or turbulent, depending on Reynolds number.&lt;ref name="Prasuhn, Alan L. 1987"/&gt;

==Applications==

Common topics of design for hydraulic engineers include hydraulic structures such as [[dams]], [[levees]], water distribution networks, water collection networks, sewage collection networks, [[storm water]] management, [[sediment transport]], and various other topics related to [[transportation engineering]] and [[geotechnical engineering]]. Equations developed from the principles of [[fluid dynamics]] and [[fluid mechanics]] are widely utilized by other engineering disciplines such as mechanical, [[aerospace engineering|aeronautical]] and even traffic engineers.

Related branches include [[hydrology]] and [[rheology]] while related applications include hydraulic modeling, flood mapping, catchment flood management plans, shoreline management plans, estuarine strategies, coastal protection, and flood alleviation.

Earliest uses of hydraulic engineering were to [[irrigation|irrigate crops]] and dates back to [[Mesopotamia|the Middle East]] and [[ancient Egypt|Africa]]. Controlling the movement and supply of water for growing food has been used for many thousands of years. One of the earliest hydraulic machines, the [[water clock]] was used in the early 2nd millennium BC.&lt;ref&gt;Gascoigne, Bamber. “History of Clocks”. History World. From 2001, ongoing. http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?groupid=2322&amp;HistoryID=ac08&amp;gtrack=pthc&lt;/ref&gt; Other early examples of using gravity to move water include the [[Qanat]] system in ancient Persia and the very similar [[Turpan water system]] in ancient China as well as irrigation canals in Peru.&lt;ref&gt;"Qanats" Water History. From 2001, ongoing. http://www.waterhistory.org/histories/qanats/&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[History of China#Ancient era|ancient China]], hydraulic engineering was highly developed, and engineers constructed massive canals with levees and dams to channel the flow of water for irrigation, as well as locks to allow ships to pass through. [[Sunshu Ao]] is considered the first Chinese hydraulic engineer. Another important Hydraulic Engineer in China, [[Ximen Bao]] was credited of starting the practice of large scale canal irrigation during the [[Warring States period]] (481&amp;nbsp;BC-221&amp;nbsp;BC), even today hydraulic engineers remain a respectable position in China. Before becoming [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]] in 2002, [[Hu Jintao]] was a hydraulic engineer and holds an engineering degree from [[Tsinghua University]]

In the [[History of the Philippines (900-1521)|Archaic epoch of the Philippines]], hydraulic engineering also developed specially in the Island of [[Luzon]], the [[Ifugao (province)|Ifugao]]s of the mountainous region of the [[Cordillera]]s built irrigations, dams and hydraulic works and the famous [[Banaue Rice Terraces]] as a way for assisting in growing crops around 1000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20071201054321/http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Temple/9845/tech.htm&lt;/ref&gt; These Rice Terraces are 2,000-year-old [[Terrace (agriculture)|terrace]]s that were carved into the mountains of [[Ifugao]] in the [[Philippines]] by ancestors of the [[Igorot|indigenous people]].

[[Eupalinos]] of [[Megara]], was an [[ancient Greek]] [[engineer]] who built the [[Tunnel of Eupalinos]] on [[Samos]] in the 6th century BC, an important feat of both civil and hydraulic engineering. The civil engineering aspect of this tunnel was the fact that it was dug from both ends which required the diggers to maintain an accurate path so that the two tunnels met and that the entire effort maintained a sufficient slope to allow the water to flow.

Hydraulic engineering was highly developed in Europe under the aegis of the [[Roman Empire]] where it was especially applied to the construction and maintenance of [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueduct]]s to supply water to and remove sewage from their cities.&lt;ref name="Finnemore"/&gt;  In addition to supplying the needs of their citizens they used [[hydraulic mining]] methods to prospect and extract alluvial [[gold]] deposits in a technique known as [[hushing]], and applied the methods to other ores such as those of [[tin]] and [[lead]].

In the 15th century, the [[Somali people|Somali]] [[Ajuran Sultanate|Ajuran Empire]] was the only [[hydraulic empire]] in Africa. As a hydraulic empire, the Ajuran State monopolized the [[water resources]] of the [[Jubba river|Jubba]] and [[Shebelle River]]s. Through hydraulic engineering, it also constructed many of the [[limestone]] [[Water well|wells]] and [[cistern]]s of the state that are still operative and in use today. The rulers developed new systems for [[agriculture]] and [[taxation]], which continued to be used in parts of the [[Horn of Africa]] as late as the 19th century.&lt;ref name="His 40"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FlL2vE_qRQ8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The History of Somalia |page=26 |date= |accessdate=2014-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further advances in hydraulic engineering occurred in the [[Muslim world]] between the 8th to 16th centuries, during what is known as the [[Islamic Golden Age]]. Of particular importance was the '[[water management technological complex]]' which was central to the [[Muslim Agricultural Revolution|Islamic Green Revolution]] and,&lt;ref name=Burke-174&gt;{{citation|author=Edmund Burke|title=Islam at the Center: Technological Complexes and the Roots of Modernity|journal=[[Journal of World History]]|volume=20|issue=2|date=June 2009|publisher=[[University of Hawaii Press]]|doi=10.1353/jwh.0.0045|pages=165–186 [174]}}&lt;/ref&gt; by extension, a precondition for the emergence of modern technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Edmund Burke|title=Islam at the Center: Technological Complexes and the Roots of Modernity|journal=[[Journal of World History]]|volume=20|issue=2|date=June 2009|publisher=[[University of Hawaii Press]]|doi=10.1353/jwh.0.0045|pages=165–186 [168]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The various components of this 'toolkit' were developed in different parts of the [[Afro-Eurasia]]n landmass, both within and beyond the Islamic world.

The various components of this complex included [[canal]]s, [[dam]]s, the ''[[qanat]]'' system from Persia, regional water-lifting devices such as the ''[[noria]], [[shaduf]]'' and [[screwpump]] from [[Egypt]], and the [[windmill]] from Islamic [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name=Burke-173/&gt; Other original Islamic developments included the ''[[Sakia|saqiya]]'' with a [[flywheel]] effect from Islamic Spain,&lt;ref name=Flywheel&gt;Ahmad Y Hassan, [http://www.history-science-technology.com/Notes/Notes%204.htm Flywheel Effect for a ''Saqiya''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007124513/http://www.history-science-technology.com/Notes/Notes%204.htm |date=2010-10-07 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Reciprocating motion|reciprocating]] [[suction]] [[pump]]&lt;ref name=Hill2&gt;Donald Routledge Hill, "Mechanical Engineering in the Medieval Near East", ''Scientific American'', May 1991, pp. 64–9.

===Modern times===
In many respects, the fundamentals of hydraulic engineering haven't changed since ancient times. Liquids are still moved for the most part by gravity through systems of canals and aqueducts, though the supply reservoirs may now be filled using pumps. The need for water has steadily increased from ancient times and the role of the hydraulic engineer is a critical one in supplying it. For example, without the efforts of people like [[William Mulholland]] the Los Angeles area would not have been able to grow as it has because it simply doesn't have enough local water to support its population. The same is true for many of our world's largest cities. In much the same way, the central valley of California could not have become such an important agricultural region without effective water management and distribution for irrigation. In a somewhat parallel way to what happened in California, the creation of the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] (TVA) brought work and prosperity to the South by building dams to generate cheap electricity and control flooding in the region, making rivers navigable and generally modernizing life in the region.

Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) performed experiments, investigated and speculated on waves and jets, eddies and streamlining.   Isaac Newton (1642–1727) by formulating the laws of motion and his law of viscosity, in addition to developing the calculus, paved the way for many great developments in fluid mechanics.  Using Newton's laws of motion, numerous 18th-century mathematicians solved many frictionless (zero-viscosity) flow problems.  However, most flows are dominated by viscous effects, so engineers of the 17th and 18th centuries found the inviscid flow solutions unsuitable, and by experimentation they developed empirical equations, thus establishing the science of hydraulics.&lt;ref name="Finnemore"/&gt;

Late in the 19th century, the importance of dimensionless numbers and their relationship to turbulence was recognized, and dimensional analysis was born.  In 1904 Ludwig Prandtl published a key paper, proposing that the flow fields of low-viscosity fluids be divided into two zones, namely a thin, viscosity-dominated boundary layer near solid surfaces, and an effectively inviscid outer zone away from the boundaries.  This concept explained many former paradoxes and enabled subsequent engineers to analyze far more complex flows.  However, we still have no complete theory for the nature of turbulence, and so modern fluid mechanics continues to be combination of experimental results and theory.&lt;ref&gt;Fluid Mechanics&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern hydraulic engineer uses the same kinds of [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) tools as many of the other engineering disciplines while also making use of technologies like [[computational fluid dynamics]] to perform the calculations to accurately predict flow characteristics, [[global positioning system|GPS]] mapping to assist in locating the best paths for installing a system and laser-based surveying tools to aid in the actual construction of a system.

'''Hydrophobicity scales''' are values that define relative [[hydrophobe|hydrophobicity]] of [[amino acid]] residues. The more positive the value, the more [[hydrophobic]] are the amino acids located in that region of the protein. These scales are commonly used to predict the [[Transmembrane domain|transmembrane alpha-helices]] of [[membrane proteins]]. When consecutively measuring amino acids of a protein, changes in value indicate attraction of specific protein regions towards the hydrophobic region inside [[lipid bilayer]].

==Hydrophobicity and the hydrophobic effect==
{{main|Hydrophobic effect}}
[[File:Liquid water hydrogen bond.png|right|thumb|200px|Hydrogen bonds between molecules of liquid water]]
The hydrophobic effect represents the tendency of [[water#Chemical and physical properties|water]] to exclude non-polar molecules. The effect originates from the disruption of highly dynamic [[hydrogen bond]]s between molecules of liquid water. Polar chemical groups, such as OH group in [[methanol]] do not cause the hydrophobic effect. However, a pure hydrocarbon molecule, for example [[hexane]], cannot accept or donate hydrogen bonds to water. Introduction of hexane into water causes disruption of the hydrogen bonding network between water molecules. The hydrogen bonds are  partially reconstructed by building a water "cage" around the hexane molecule, similar to that in [[clathrate hydrate]]s formed at lower temperatures. The mobility of water molecules in the "cage" (or [[solvation shell]]) is strongly restricted. This leads to significant losses in translational and rotational [[entropy]] of water molecules and makes the process unfavorable in terms of [[Gibbs free energy|free energy]] of the system.&lt;ref name="Tanford, C. 1980"&gt;Tanford, C., The hydrophobic effect(New York:Wiley.1980).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="multiple"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W . Kauzmann, Adv. Protein Chem. 14 (1959) 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charton, M. and Charton, B.I. (1982) J. Theor. Biol., 99, 629–644.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of amino acid hydrophobicity scales==
[[File:Different hydrophobicity scales.png|thumb|A table comparing four different scales for the hydrophobicity of an amino acid residue in a protein with the most hydrophobic amino acids on the top]]

A number of different hydrophobicity scales have been developed.&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;Kallol M. Biswas, Daniel R. DeVido, John G. Dorsey(2003) Journal of Chromatography A,1000,  637–655.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

There are clear differences between the four scales shown in the table.&lt;ref&gt;http://prowl.rockefeller.edu/aainfo/hydro.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Both the second and fourth scales place [[cysteine]] as the most hydrophobic residue, unlike the other two scales. This difference is due to the different methods used to measure hydrophobicity. The method used to obtain the Janin and Rose et al. scales was to examine proteins with known 3-D structures and define the hydrophobic character as the tendency for a residue to be found inside of a protein rather than on its surface.&lt;ref&gt;J. Janin, Nature, 277(1979)491-492.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. Rose, A. Geselowitz, G. Lesser, R. Lee and M. Zehfus, Science 229(1985)834-838.&lt;/ref&gt; Since cysteine forms disulfide bonds that must occur inside a globular structure, cysteine is ranked as the most hydrophobic. The first and third scales are derived from the physiochemical properties of the amino acid side chains. These scales result mainly from inspection of the amino acid structures.&lt;ref&gt;R. Wolfenden, L. Andersson, P. Cullis and C. Southgate, Biochemistry 20(1981)849-855.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Kyte and R. Doolittle, J. Mol Biol. 157(1982)105-132&lt;/ref&gt; Biswas et al., divided the scales based on the method used to obtain the scale into five different categories.&lt;ref name ="multiple"/&gt;

==Partitioning methods==
The most common method of measuring amino acid hydrophobicity is partitioning between two immiscible liquid phases. Different organic solvents are most widely used to mimic the protein interior. However, organic solvents are slightly miscible with water and the characteristics of both phases change making it difficult to obtain pure hydrophobicity scale.&lt;ref&gt;Kallol M. Biswas, Daniel R. DeVido, John G. Dorsey(2003) Journal of Chromatography A,1000, 637–655.&lt;/ref&gt; Nozaki and Tanford proposed the first major hydrophobicity scale for nine amino acids.&lt;ref&gt;Y . Nozaki, C. Tanford, J. Biol. Chem. 246 (1971) 2211.
&lt;/ref&gt; Ethanol and dioxane are used as the organic solvents and the free energy of transfer of each amino acid was calculated.  Non liquid phases can also be used with partitioning methods such as micellar phases and vapor phases. Two scales have been developed using micellar phases.&lt;ref&gt;J .H. Fendler, F. Nome, J. Nagyvary, J. Mol. Evol. 6 (1975)215&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E .B. Leodidas, A.T. Hatton, J. Phys. Chem. 94 (1990) 6411.&lt;/ref&gt; Fendler et al. measured the partitioning of 14 radiolabeled amino acids using [[sodium dodecyl sulfate]] (SDS) [[micelles]]. Also, amino acid side chain affinity for water was measured using vapor phases.&lt;ref&gt;R . Wolfenden, L. Andersson, P.M. Cullis, C.C.B. Southgate, Biochemistry 20 (1981) 849. .&lt;/ref&gt; Vapor phases represent the simplest non polar phases, because it has no interaction with the solute.&lt;ref&gt;K .A. Sharp, A. Nicholls, R. Friedman, B. Honig, Biochemistry 30 (1991) 9686.&lt;/ref&gt; The hydration potential and its correlation to the appearance of amino acids on the surface of proteins was studied by Wolfenden. Aqueous and [[polymer]] phases were used in the development of a novel partitioning scale.&lt;ref&gt;B .Y. Zaslavsky, N.M. Mestechkina, L.M. Miheeva, S.V.
Rogozhin, J. Chromatogr. 240 (1982) 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Partitioning methods have many drawbacks. First, it is difficult to mimic the protein interior.&lt;ref&gt;S . Damadoran, K.B. Song, J. Biol. Chem. 261 (1986) 7220.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A . Ben-Naim, Biopolymers 29 (1990) 567.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the role of self solvation makes using free amino acids very difficult. Moreover, hydrogen bonds that are lost in the transfer to organic solvents are not reformed but often in the interior of protein.&lt;ref name=Chothia&gt;C . Chothia, J. Mol. Biol. 105 (1976) 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Accessible surface area methods==
{{main|Implicit solvation}}
Hydrophobicity scales can also be obtained by calculating the [[solvent accessible surface area]]s for amino acid residues in the expended polypeptide chain&lt;ref name=Chothia/&gt; or in [[alpha-helix]] and multiplying the surface areas by the [[Implicit solvation#Accessible surface area-based method|empirical solvation parameters]] for the corresponding types of atoms.&lt;ref name ="multiple" /&gt; 
A differential solvent accessible surface area hydrophobicity scale based on proteins as compacted networks near a critical point, due to self-organization by evolution, was constructed based on asymptotic power-law (self-similar) behavior.&lt;ref&gt;M. A. Moret, G. F. Zebende, Phys. Rev. E 75 (2007) 011920; J. C. Phillips, Phys. Rev. E 80 (2009) 051916.&lt;/ref&gt; This scale is based on a bioinformatic survey of 5526 high-resolution structures from the Protein Data Bank. This differential scale has two comparative advantages: (1) it is especially useful for treating changes in water-protein interactions that are too small to be accessible to conventional force-field calculations, and (2) for homologous structures, it can yield correlations with changes in properties from mutations in the amino acid sequences alone, without determining corresponding structural changes, either in vitro or in vivo.

==Chromatographic methods==
Reversed phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) is the most important chromatographic method for measuring solute hydrophobicity.&lt;ref name ="multiple" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R .S. Hodges, B.-Y. Shu, N.E. Zhou, C.T. Mant, J. Chromatogr. A 676 (1994) 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The non polar stationary phase mimics biological membranes. Peptide usage has many advantages because partition is not extended by the terminal charges in RPLC. Also, secondary structures formation is avoided by using short sequence peptides. Derivatization of amino acids is necessary to ease its partition into a C18 bonded phase. Another scale had been developed in 1971 and used peptide retention on hydrophilic gel.&lt;ref&gt;A .A. Aboderin, Int. J. Biochem. 2 (1971) 537.&lt;/ref&gt; 1-butanol and pyridine were used as the mobile phase in this particular scale and glycine was used as the reference value. Pliska and his coworkers&lt;ref&gt;V . Pliska, M. Schmidt, J.L. Fauchere, J. Chromatogr. 216(1981) 79.&lt;/ref&gt; used thin layer chromatography to relate mobility values of free amino acids to their hydrophobicities. About a decade ago, another hydrophilicity scale was published, this scale used normal phase liquid chromatography and showed the retention of 121 peptides on an amide-80 column.&lt;ref&gt;M . Plass, K. Valko, M.H. Abraham, J. Chromatogr. A 803(1998) 51–60.&lt;/ref&gt;
The absolute values and relative rankings of hydrophobicity determined by chromatographic methods can be affected by a number of parameters. These parameters include the silica surface area and pore diameter, the choice and pH of aqueous buffer, temperature and the bonding density of stationary phase chains.&lt;ref name ="multiple" /&gt;

==Site-directed mutagenesis==
This method use DNA recombinant technology and it gives an actual measurement of protein stability. In his detailed site-directed mutagenesis studies, Utani and his coworkers substituted 19 amino acids at Trp49 of the tryptophan synthase and he measured the free energy of unfolding. They found that the increased stability is directly proportional to increase in hydrophobicity up to a certain size limit. The main disadvantage of site-directed mutagenesis method is that not all the 20 naturally occurring amino acids can substitute a single residue in a protein. Moreover, these methods have cost problems and is useful only for measuring protein stability.&lt;ref name ="multiple" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K . Yutani, K. Ogasahara, T. Tsujita, Y. Sugino, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84 (1987) 4441.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical property methods==
[[File:Hydrophobicity scales2.gif|thumb|Wimley-White whole-residue hydrophobicity scales]]
The hydrophobicity scales developed by [[physical property]] methods are based on the measurement of different physical properties. Examples include, partial molar heat capacity, transition temperature and surface tension. Physical methods are easy to use and flexible in terms of solute. The most popular hydrophobicity scale was developed by measuring surface tension values for the naturally occurring 20 amino acids in NaCl solution.&lt;ref&gt;H .B. Bull, K. Breese, Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 161(1974)665&lt;/ref&gt; The main drawbacks of surface tension measurements is that the broken hydrogen bonds and the neutralized charged groups remain at the solution air interface.&lt;ref name ="multiple" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Kyte, R.F. Doolittle, J. Mol. Biol. 157 (1982) 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Another physical property method involve measuring the solvation free energy.&lt;ref&gt;D . Eisenberg, A.D. McLachlan, Nature 319 (1986) 199&lt;/ref&gt; The solvation free energy is estimated as a product of an accessibility of an atom to the solvent and an atomic solvation parameter. Results indicate the solvation free energy lowers by an average of 1 Kcal/residue upon folding.&lt;ref name ="multiple" /&gt;

==Recent applications==
Palliser and Parry have examined about 100 scales and found that they can use them for locating B-strands on the surface of proteins.&lt;ref&gt;C .C. Palliser, D.A.D. Parry, Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 42
(2001) 243.&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrophobicity scales were  also used to predict the preservation of the genetic code.&lt;ref&gt;G . Trinquier, Y.-H. Sanejouand, Protein Eng. 11 (1998) 153.&lt;/ref&gt; Trinquier observed a new order of the bases that better reflect the conserved character of the genetic code.&lt;ref name ="multiple" /&gt; They believed new ordering of the bases was uracil-guanine-cystosine-adenine(UGCA)better reflected the conserved character of the genetic code compared to the commonly seen ordering UCAG.&lt;ref name ="multiple" /&gt;

==Wimley–White whole residue hydrophobicity scales==
The Wimley–White whole residue hydrophobicity scales are significant for two reasons. First, they include the contributions of the peptide bonds as well as the sidechains, providing absolute values. Second, they are based on direct, experimentally determined values for transfer free energies of polypeptides.

Two whole-residue hydrophobicity scales have been measured:
* One for the transfer of unfolded chains from water to the bilayer interface (referred to as the Wimley–White interfacial hydrophobicity scale).
* One for the transfer of unfolded chains into octanol, which is relevant to the hydrocarbon core of a bilayer.
The Stephen H. White website&lt;ref name="Irvine"&gt;{{cite web|last=White|first=Stephen|title=Experimentally Determined Hydrophobicity Scales|publisher=University of California, Irvine|date=2006-06-29|url=http://blanco.biomol.uci.edu/hydrophobicity_scales.html|accessdate=2009-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides an example of whole residue hydrophobicity scales showing the free energy of transfer ΔG(kcal/mol) from water to POPC  interface and to n-octanol.&lt;ref name="Irvine" /&gt; These two scales are then used together to make Whole residue hydropathy plots.&lt;ref name="Irvine" /&gt; The hydropathy plot constructed using ΔGwoct − ΔGwif shows favorable peaks on the absolute scale that correspond to the known TM helices. Thus, the whole residue hydropathy plots illustrate why transmembrane segments prefer a transmembrane location rather than a surface one.&lt;ref&gt;Wimley WC &amp; White SH (1996). Nature Struct.

== Bandyopadhyay-Mehler protein structure based scales==
Most of the existing hydrophobicity scales are derived from the properties of amino acids in their free forms or as a part of a short peptide. Bandyopadhyay-Mehler hydrophobicity scale was based on partitioning of amino acids in the context of protein structure. Protein structure is a complex mosaic of various dielectric medium generated by arrangement of different amino acids. Hence, different parts of the protein structure most likely would  behave as solvents with different dielectric values. For simplicity, each protein structure was considered as a immiscible mixture of two solvents, protein interior and protein exterior. The local environment around individual amino acid  (termed as "micro-environment") was computed for both protein interior and protein exterior. The ratio gives the relative hydrophobicity scale for individual amino acids. Computation was trained on high resolution protein crystal structures. This quantitative descriptor for microenvironment was derived from log P values of small molecules, partitioned into water and octanol, (known as Rekker's Fragmental Constants) widely used for pharmacophores. This scale well correlate with the existing methods, based on partitioning and free energy computations. Advantage of this scale is it is more realistic, as it is in the context of real protein structures.&lt;ref name="Debashree" /&gt;
 
==Scale based on contact angle of water nanodroplet==

[[File:Simulation system in hydrophobicity calculation.jpg|thumb|The MD simulation system and the structure of artificial beta-folding 2D peptide network composed of unified R-side chains.|left]]
In the field of [[engineering]], the hydrophobicity (or [[dewetting]] ability) of a flat surface (e.g., a counter top in kitchen or a cooking pan) can be measured by the [[contact angle]] of water droplet. A [[University of Nebraska-Lincoln]] team recently devised a computational approach that can relate the molecular hydrophobicity scale of amino-acid chains to the contact angle of water nanodroplet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1073/pnas.1616138113|title=Characterizing hydrophobicity of amino acid side chains in a protein environment via measuring contact angle of a water nanodroplet on planar peptide network|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=113|issue=46|pages=12946–12951|year=2016|last1=Zhu|first1=Chongqin|last2=Gao|first2=Yurui|last3=Li|first3=Hui|last4=Meng|first4=Sheng|last5=Li|first5=Lei|last6=Francisco|first6=Joseph S|last7=Zeng|first7=Xiao Cheng}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team constructed planar networks composed of unified amino-acid side chains with native structure of the beta-sheet protein. Using molecular dynamics simulation, the team is able to measure the contact angle of water nanodroplet on the planar networks (caHydrophobicity).

In the other hand, previous studies show that the minimum of excess [[chemical potential]] of a hard-sphere solute with respect to that in the bulk exhibits a linear dependence on cosine value of contact angle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1073/pnas.0902778106|title=Characterizing hydrophobicity of interfaces by using cavity formation, solute binding, and water correlations|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=106|issue=36|pages=15119–15124|year=2009|last1=Godawat|first1=R|last2=Jamadagni|first2=S. N|last3=Garde|first3=S|pmc=2741215}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the computed excess chemical potentials of the purely repulsive methane-sized Weeks–Chandler–Andersen solute with respect to that in the bulk, the extrapolated values of cosine value of contact angle are calculated(ccHydrophobicity), which can be used to quantify the hydrophobicity of amino acid side chains with complete wetting behaviors.

'''Intergroup dialogue''' is a "face to face facilitated conversation between members of two or more social identity groups that strives to create new levels of understanding, relating and action." This process promotes conversation around controversial issues, specifically, in order to generate new "collective visions" that uphold the dignity of all people.&lt;ref name="Bridging Differences"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zúñiga|first1=Ximena|title=Bridging Differences through Dialogue |url=http://academic.udayton.edu/JamesOlive/ClassMaterials/EDC551/Zuniga%20%282002%29.pdf |publisher=About Campus |accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intergroup dialogue is based in the philosophies of the democratic and popular education movements. It is most commonly used on college campuses, but may assume different namesakes in other settings.

== History ==

Intergroup dialogue is rooted in "philosophical and cultural traditions that have valued dialogue as a method of communication and inquiry" to explore shared concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schoem &amp; Hurtado (Eds.)|title=Intergroup dialogue: Deliberative democracy in school, college, community and workplace|location=Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press|pages=306–327}}&lt;/ref&gt; These traditions heavily influenced 20th century movements for [[democratic education]], which included intergroup dialogue as a core objective. The application of dialogue in education was a core tenet of the democratic education movement, drawing on the work of public intellectuals like [[John Dewey]] who envisioned "schools as social centers" that "educate youth for democratic citizenship." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Benson|first1=Harkavy|title=The Enduring Appeal of Community Schools|journal=American Educator|date=July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dewey and other advocates of democratic education at the time envisioned dialogue as "the practice of deliberative democracy." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Trifonas|first1=Peter|title=Revolutionary Pedagogies: Cultural Politics, Instituting Education and the Discourse of Theory|date=2000|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|pages=252}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Civic engagement]], [[experiential learning]] and [[student-centered learning]] are also products of this movement. For example, [[Paulo Freire]], a core figure in [[popular education]], adopted a theoretical approach to intergroup dialogue that emphasized the importance of people's own experiences, and need to build dialogue capacity to enable people to "analyze their situation and take action to transform themselves and their conditions.” [[Myles Horton]], another popular education thinker, co-founded the [[Highlander Research and Education Center]] (1932) - one of the earliest U.S. mainstream examples of a community center that offered dialogue, "popular education and literacy...as a means of promoting civic participation and social action organizing." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Minkler|first1=Meredith (Ed.)|title=Community Organizing and Community Building for Health and Welfare|date=2012|publisher=Rutgers Press|location=New Jersey|page=65|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The intergroup education movement in the 1940s and 1950s built upon the idea of "dialogue as liberatory educational practice," also drawing from feminist, antiracist and [[critical theory]] as well as the Intergroup [[Contact hypothesis]]. This movement was a response in some capacities to 20th century U.S. political turmoil. The [[Second Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], the rapid internal movement of [[African Americans]] from the rural South to the industrial north, contributed to considerable social unrest within the United States. Similar effects were felt in the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]] with the mass migration of [[Mexican Americans]] following [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Zúñiga, Nagda et. al."&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zúñiga, Nagda et. al.|title=Intergroup Dialogue in Higher Education: Meaningful Learning About Social Justice|date=October 13, 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intergroup education was the foundation for "antibias, antiracist, multicultural, [and] [[social justice]] education" that sought to address this unrest, primarily in college campus settings.&lt;ref name="Zúñiga, Nagda et. al." /&gt; In the 1980s, the [[University of Michigan]] inaugurated its [http://igr.umich.edu/ Program on Intergroup Relations], which inspired similar models at a number of universities throughout the U.S. The growing popularity of intergroup dialogue programs on college campuses coincided with other shifts in higher education, including, for instance, the integration of [[Critical race theory]] as academic discipline in law and other fields.

== Methodology and Approach ==

=== Intergroup Dialogue Goals ===

Intergroup dialogue is intended to build relationships amongst participants with different social identities through the use of personal storytelling, empathetic listening and interpersonal inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=Joohan|last2=Kim|first2=Eun Joo|title=Theorizing Dialogic Deliberation: Everyday Political Talk as Communicative Action and Dialogue|journal=Communication Theory|date=2008|volume=18|issue=1|pages=51–70|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2885.2007.00313.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It integrates three core educational goals: "consciousness raising, building relationships across differences and conflicts, and strengthening individual and collective capacities to promote social justice." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zuniga|first1=Ximena|last2=Nagda|first2=Biren|last3=Chesler|first3=Mark|last4=Cytron-Walker|first4=Adena|title=Intergroup Dialogue in Higher Education|date=2007|publisher=Wiley Periodicals, Inc.|location=Hoboken, NJ|isbn=9780787995799|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Intergroup dialogue distinguishes its approach from other dialogic methods such as debate and discussion.

==== Dialogic Goals ====

'''Debate:''' To clarify pros and cons of issues, to develop critical thinking skills

'''Discussion:''' To generate different perspectives on issues, to consider decisions among different options

'''Intergroup Dialogue:'''To increase critical self and societal awareness, to increase intergroup communication, understand and collaborative actions&lt;ref name="Zúñiga, Nagda et. al." /&gt;

=== Multi-partiality ===

Intergroup dialogue draws the work of  [[Freire]] whose work focuses on consciousness raising, a process through which members of an oppressed group come to understand the history and circumstances of their oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Freire|first1=Paolo|title=Pedagogy of the Oppressed|date=1970|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|location=New York, NY|isbn=0826412769}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intergroup dialogue further aims to raise the consciousness of all participants, including those from advantaged and disadvantaged groups, through the use of  multi-partial facilitation. This approach was developed by Janet Rifkin, Professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, as a method of conflict resolution, and was adopted by the Program on Intergroup Relations as a method of facilitating dialogue across difference of social identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roger|first1=Fisher|title=Multipartiality|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MX3FfacNco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A multi-partial approach to facilitation differs from both a neutral or impartial approach, as well as a model in which the facilitator acts as an advocate, such as in many feminist models. Multi-partial facilitation acknowledges the presence of “dominant narratives”, within dialogue, or sets of assumptions and beliefs based on socialization and cultural values. If the facilitator were to be impartial and neutral in moments of conflict between dialogue participants, the dominant narrative would affirm the experiences and voices of the dominant group members and further marginalize the experience of marginalized participants. A multi-partial facilitation approach differs from facilitator-advocate approaches in that it is equally invested in the participation and growth of all dialogue participants; it encourages self-reflection and awareness through engagement rather than direct confrontation, an approach based on the belief that “people who are not feeling threatened are more open to discussing their feelings and interests and are more open to discussing the effects the conflict is having on both groups.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stephan|first1=W|title=Psychological and Communication Processes Associated With Intergroup Conflict Resolution|journal=Small Group Research|date=2008|volume=39|issue=28|doi= 10.1177/1046496407313413|pages=28–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than directly confronting a group member’s bias,  a multi-partial facilitator “pursues” the dominant narrative and encourages group members to share their experiences, while simultaneously encouraging a critical analysis of the underlying assumptions and narratives at play.

== Presence on College Campuses ==

Universities worldwide offer intergroup dialogue programs to their students. Intergroup dialogue programs are frequently launched as part of larger campus diversity and social justice initiatives seeking to address tensions and conflict related to social identity, most centrally, race.  Campuses vary in their approach to intergroup dialogue, "tailor[ing] to the specific needs of the campus, school, academic department or student affairs unit that it serves." &lt;ref name="Bridging Differences" /&gt; Dialogue groups are generally housed in on-campus organizations or academic departments, included as course offerings in [[Social Work]], [[Sociology]], [[Psychology]], [[American Studies]], [[Peace and Conflict Studies]] and [[Education]]. Students enrolled in intergroup dialogue coursework are typically required to complete supplementary readings, reflections, papers and in some cases, field work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zúñiga|first1=Ximena|title=Fostering Intergroup Dialogue on Campus: Essential Ingredients|url=http://www.diversityweb.org/digest/w98/fostering.html|website=Diversity Digest|publisher=Association of American Colleges and Universities|accessdate=February 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evaluation and Outcomes ==

Research shows that Intergroup dialogue has positive impacts on participants' understanding of diversity and social justice issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alimo|first1=Craig|last2=Kelly|first2=Robert|last3=Clarke|first3=Christine|title=Diversity initiatives in higher education: Intergroup Dialogue Program student outcomes and implications for campus radical climate: A case study|journal=Multicultural Education|date=2002|volume=10|issue=1|pages=49–53|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/216312081}}&lt;/ref&gt; After conducting a qualitative interview study with dialogue participants,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yeakley|first1=Anna|title=The nature of prejudice change: Positive and negative change processes arising from intergroup contact experiences.|journal=Unpublished doctoral dissertation, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor|date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anna Yeakley found that "connecting through a depth of personal sharing" has been shown to play a significant role in creating positive dialogue outcomes, while participants who "disconnected in response to hurtful intergroup conflicts" reported negative outcomes. Yeakley highlights the importance of facilitator training, and finds that five facilitation skills are essential to promoting positive outcomes:  ( 1 ) creating a safe space, ( 2 ) recognizing signs of negative processes, ( 3 ) encouraging and supporting depth of personal sharing, ( 4 ) engaging conflicts as teachable moments, and ( 5 ) attending to identity differences in awareness and experience.&lt;ref name="Zúñiga, Nagda et. al." /&gt;

The fungal partner is called the '''[[mycobiont]]'''. The photosynthetic partner, algae or cyanobacteria, is called the '''[[photobiont]]'''. The body of a lichens that does not contain reproductive parts of the fungus is called the '''[[thallus]]'''. The thallus is different from those of either the fungus or alga growing separately. The [[fungus]] surrounds the algal cells, often enclosing them within complex fungal tissues unique to lichen associations. In many species the fungus penetrates the algal cell wall, forming penetration pegs or [[haustoria]] similar to those produced by pathogenic fungi.&lt;ref name=dobson&gt;F.S.

The algal or cyanobacterial cells are [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]], and as in plants they [[redox|reduce]] atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] into organic carbon sugars to feed both symbionts. Both partners gain water and mineral nutrients mainly from the atmosphere, through rain and dust. The fungal partner protects the alga by retaining water, serving as a larger capture area for mineral nutrients and, in some cases, provides minerals obtained from the [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]]. If a [[Cyanobacteria|cyanobacterium]] is present, as a primary partner or another symbiont in addition to green alga as in certain tripartite lichens, they can [[nitrogen fixation|fix atmospheric nitrogen]], complementing the activities of the green alga.

Although strains of [[cyanobacteria]] found in various [[cyanolichen]]s are often closely related to one another, they differ from the most closely related free-living strains.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/297/5580/357 Sciencemag.org]&lt;/ref&gt; The lichen association is a close symbiosis. It extends the ecological range of both partners but is not always obligatory for their growth and reproduction in natural environments, since many of the algal symbionts can live independently. A prominent example is the alga ''[[Trentepohlia (alga)|Trentepohlia]]'' which forms orange-coloured populations on tree trunks and suitable rock faces. Lichen propagules ([[Diaspore (botany)|diaspores]]) typically contain cells from both partners, although the fungal components of so-called "fringe species" rely instead on algal cells dispersed by the “core species.”&lt;ref name="RaiBergman2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=A.N.

Lichen associations may be examples of [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]], [[commensalism]] or even [[parasitism]],{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} depending on the species. [[Cyanobacteria]] in laboratory settings can grow faster when they are alone rather than when they are part of a lichen.

==Symbionts==

[[File:Lichen Cross Section Diagram.svg|thumb|right|Schematic cross section of lichen, a symbiosis between green algae and a [[fungus]]. 1. Thick layers of [[hyphae]], called the cortex 2. [[Green algae]] 3. Loosely packed [[hyphae]] 4. Anchoring [[hyphae]] called [[rhizine]]s.]]
::''"Lichens are fungi that have discovered agriculture"'' - [[Trevor Goward]]&lt;ref name=LNA&gt;LICHEN BIOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT, LICHENS OF NORTH AMERICA, Sylvia and Stephen Sharnoff, [http://www.lichen.com/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Living as a [[Symbiosis|symbiont]] in a lichen appears to be a successful way for a fungus to derive essential nutrients, as about 20% of all fungal species have acquired this mode of life. The fungal partner may be an [[Ascomycete]] or [[Basidiomycete]].&lt;ref name=UCLS&gt;[http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/fungi/lichens/lichensy.html Lichens: Systematics, University of California Museum of Paleontology]&lt;/ref&gt; Common algal partners are ''[[Trebouxia]]'', ''[[Pseudotrebouxia]]'', or ''[[Myrmecia (alga)|Myrmecia]]''. Common [[cyanobacterium]] partners include are ''[[Nostoc]]''&lt;ref name=dobson/&gt; or ''[[Scytonema]]''.&lt;ref name=UCLS/&gt;

The largest number of lichenized fungi occur in the [[Ascomycota]], with about 40% of species forming such an association.&lt;ref name="Kirk pp.378-81"&gt;Kirk ''et al''., pp. 378–81.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these lichenized fungi occur in orders with nonlichenized fungi that live as [[saprotroph]]s or [[parasite|plant parasites]] (for example, the [[Leotiales]], [[Dothideales]], and [[Pezizales]]). Other lichen fungi occur in only five [[order (biology)|orders]] in which all members are engaged in this habit (Orders [[Graphidales]], [[Gyalectales]], [[Peltigerales]], [[Pertusariales]], and [[Teloschistales]]). Lichenized and nonlichenized fungi can even be found in the same genus or species.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Overall, about 98% of lichens have an ascomycetous mycobiont. Next to the Ascomycota, the largest number of lichenized fungi occur in the unassigned [[fungi imperfecti]]. Comparatively few [[Basidiomycetes]] are lichenized, but these include [[agarics]], such as species of ''[[Lichenomphalia]]'', [[clavarioid fungi]], such as species of ''[[Multiclavula]]'', and [[corticioid fungi]], such as species of ''[[Dictyonema]]''.

The [[autotroph]]ic symbionts occurring in lichens are a wide variety of simple, photosynthetic organisms commonly and traditionally known as algae. These symbionts include both [[prokaryotic]] and [[eukaryotic]] organisms. Approximately 100 species of photosynthetic partners from 40 genera and five distinct classes (prokaryotic: [[Cyanophyceae]]; eukaryotic: [[Trebouxiophyceae]], [[Phaeophyceae]], [[Chlorophyceae]]) have been found to associate with the lichen-forming fungi.&lt;ref name=Friedl1996&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Photobionts |title=Lichen Biology|author=Friedl T, Büdel B. |editor-last=Nash III TH |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn= |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prokaryotes belong to the [[Cyanobacteria]], whose representatives are often called bluegreen algae. The bluegreen algae occur as symbionts in about 8% of the known lichens. The most commonly occurring genus is ''[[Nostoc]]''.&lt;ref name=Rikkinen1995&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rikkinen J. |year=1995 |title=What's behind the pretty colors? A study on the photobiology of lichens |journal=Bryobrothera |volume=4 |pages=1–226}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the lichens contain eukaryotic autotrophs belonging to the [[Chlorophyta]] (green algae) or to the Xanthophyta ([[yellow-green algae]]). About 90% of all known lichens have a green alga as a symbiont, and among these, ''[[Trebouxia]]'' is the most common genus, occurring in about 40% of all lichens. The second most commonly represented green alga genus is ''[[Trentepohlia (alga)|Trentepohlia]]''. Overall, about 100 species are known to occur as autotrophs in lichens. All the algae are probably able to exist independently in nature as well as in the lichen.&lt;ref name=Rikkinen1995/&gt;

A particular fungus species and algal species are not necessarily always associated together in a lichen. One fungus, for example, can form lichens with a variety of different algae. The [[thalli#thallus|thalli]] produced by a given fungal symbiont with its differing partners will be similar, and the secondary metabolites identical, indicating that the fungus has the dominant role in determining the morphology of the lichen. Further, the same algal species can occur in association with different fungal partners. Lichens are known in which there is one fungus associated with two or even three algal species. Rarely, the reverse can occur, and two or more fungal species can interact to form the same lichen.&lt;ref name=Rikkinen1995/&gt;

Both the lichen and the fungus partner bear the same scientific name, and the lichens are being integrated into the classification schemes for fungi. The alga bears its own scientific name, which bears no relationship to that of the lichen or fungi.&lt;ref name="Kirk pp.378-81"/&gt;

===Fungus component===

Depending on context, the entire lichen, or just the fungus that is part of the lichen. Both the lichen and the fungus that is a part of the lichen are currently (2014) given the same species name, which creates an ambiguity. An example of when "lichenized fungus" refers to just the fungus is when the fungus is grown in culture without a phycobiont. An example where "lichenized fungus" refers to the entire lichen is in a list of classified lichens.

Some fungi can only be found living on lichens ([[obligate]] [[parasite]]s), but are not considered part of the lichen. These are referred to as [[lichenolous fungi]].

===Photosynthetic component===

The photosynthetic component of a lichen is called the '''[[photobiont]]''' or '''[[phycobiont]]'''.&lt;ref name=ASLGPZ/&gt; Sometimes the photobiont is a green algae ([[chlorophyta]]), sometimes a blue-green aglae ([[cyanobacteria]], not really an algae), and sometimes both. The layer of tissue containing the cells of the photobiont is called the "photobiontic layer".&lt;ref name=ASLGPZ/&gt;

"[[Clorococcoid]]" means a green algae (Chlorophyta) that has single cells that are [[globose]], which is common in lichens.&lt;ref name=ASLGAF&gt;[http://www.lichens.lastdragon.org/faq/glossary1.html Alan Silverside's Lichen Glossary (a-f), Alan Silverside]&lt;/ref&gt; This was once classified in the order [[Chlorococcales]], which you may find stated in older literature, but new DNA data shows many independent lines of evolution exist among this formerly large taxonomic group. [[Chlorococcales]] is now a relatively small order and may no longer include any lichen photobionts. [[Trebuxia]], once included here, is now considered to be in a separate class, [[Trebouxiophyceae]]. "[[trebouxioid]]" refers to members of this class or algae resembling them.

"'''[[Trebouxioid]]'''" means a clorococcoid green algae photobiont is in the genus ''[[Trebouxia]]'', or resembles a member of that genus, and is therefore presumably a member of the class [[Trebouxiophyceae]].&lt;ref name=ASLGPZ&gt;[http://www.lichens.lastdragon.org/faq/glossary3.html Alan Silverside's Lichen Glossary (p-z), Alan Silverside]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cyanolichens===

A [[cyanolichen]] is a lichen with a [[cyanobacteria]] as its main photosynthetic component ([[photobiont]]).&lt;ref name=ASLGAF/&gt;
Many cyanolichens are small and black, and have [[limestone]] as the substrate. Another cyanolichen group, the [[jelly lichen]]s ( e.g., from the genera ''[[Collema]]'' or ''[[Leptogium]]'') are large and [[foliose]] (e.g., species of ''[[Peltigera]]'', ''[[Lobaria]]'', and ''[[Degelia]]''. These lichen species are grey-blue, especially when dampend or wet. Many of these [[characterize]] the [[Lobarion]] communities of higher rainfall areas in western Britain, e.g., in the [[Celtic Rainforest]].

'''Marion True''' (born November 5, 1948) was the former curator of [[antiquities]] for the [[Getty Center|J. Paul Getty Museum]] in [[Los Angeles, California]]. True was indicted on April 1, 2005, by the Italian court, on criminal charges accusing her of participating in a conspiracy that laundered stolen artifacts through private collections and creating a fake paper trail; the Greeks later followed suit.&lt;ref name="Combs-Kersel"&gt;Combs, Jacob, and Morag Kersel. [http://brown.edu/Departments/Joukowsky_Institute/undergrad/prizes/Combs2010.pdf "A True Controversy: The Trial of Marion True and Its Lessons for Curators, Museums Boards, and National Governments.]" : 1-15.&lt;/ref&gt; The trial brought to light many questions about museum administration, repatriation, and ethics.

==Early years==
True was born in [[Tahlequah, Oklahoma]] in 1948, and grew up in [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]] where she developed an interest in Greek [[Antiquities]].&lt;ref name="Combs-Kersel"/&gt; True later received a [[scholarship]] to study the classics and fine arts at New York University, [[NYU]]. True also has a [[masters degree]] in classical [[archaeology]] from NYU's Institute of Fine Arts, and a [[PhD]] from [[Harvard]], where she studied under Emily Dickinson Vermeule.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Reynolds, [http://www.arts.arizona.edu/are476/files/true2.htm "The puzzle of Marion True"], ''Los Angeles Times'', October 30, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne Muchnic, [http://www.italystl.com/ra/2159.htm "Getty curator Marion True, indicted over acquisitions, has often spoken on ethical issues"] ''Los Angeles Times'', May 27, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; True was trained by Cornelius Clarkson Vermeule III, contemporary scholar of Ancient Art and Curator of Classical Art at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, from 1957 to 1996.

In 1982, True joined The Getty as a curatorial assistant and later became a [[curator]] in 1986. True created a new policy for The Getty in 1987,&lt;ref name="Combs-Kersel"/&gt; which required the museum to notify governments when objects were being considered for [[acquisitions]]. Under this new policy, if a government could prove an object had been illegally exported, the museum would return it.

In 1992, True organized a symposium to debate the authenticity of a Greek kouros, which is  referred to today as the [[Getty kouros]].&lt;ref name="Combs-Kersel"/&gt; The label in the museum reads, "Greek, 530 BCE or Modern Forgery". This Kouros was worth $10 million in 1985 when it was acquired, and it is believed to have been looted from southern Italy.

In 1995, True put in place another acquisition policy that prohibited the museum from acquiring antiquities that lacked thorough documentation, or that had not previously been part of an established collection.&lt;ref name="Combs-Kersel"/&gt; Later in 1995, The Getty incorporated the collection of Barbara and Lawrence Fleischman into the museum's collection.&lt;ref name="Combs-Kersel"/&gt; During that same year, True obtained a private loan to purchase a vacation home on the Greek Island of [[Paros]]; Larry Fleischman offered to loan True the money to repay this loan in 1996.&lt;ref name="Combs-Kersel"/&gt; Later, lawyers would question if True and the Fleischmans had a conflict of interest.

==Trial==

In 2005, True was indicted by the Italian government, along with renowned American antiquities dealer, [[Robert E. Hecht]], for conspiracy to traffic in illicit antiquities. She was accused of participating in a conspiracy that laundered stolen objects through private collection in order to create a fake paper trail that would serve as the items' provenance.&lt;ref name=Mead&gt;Mead, Rebecca. [http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/04/09/070409fa_fact_mead "Onward and Upward with the Arts: Den of Antiquity."] ''The New Yorker'' 9 April  1007:1-8&lt;/ref&gt; The Getty issued statements supporting True, "We Trust that this trial will result in her exoneration and end further damage to the personal and professional reputation of Dr. True."&lt;ref name="Combs-Kersel"/&gt; The primary evidence in the case came from the 1995 raid of a [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]] warehouse, which contained a fortune in stolen artifacts. Italian art dealer, [[Giacomo Medici (art dealer)|Giacomo Medici]], was eventually arrested in 1997; his operation was thought to be "one of the largest and most sophisticated antiquities networks in the world, responsible for illegally digging up and spiriting away thousands of top-drawer pieces and passing them on to the most elite end of the international art market".&lt;ref name=vogue&gt;''[[Men's Vogue]]'', November/December 2006, Vol. 2, No. 3, pg. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Medici was sentenced in 2004, by a  court in Rome, to ten years in prison and a fine of 10 million euros, "the largest penalty ever meted out for antiquities crime in Italy".&lt;ref name=vogue/&gt;

On October 1, 2005, True resigned from The Getty.&lt;ref name="Combs-Kersel"/&gt; In November 2006, The Greek prosecution followed the Italian's lead, charging True with trafficking in looted antiquities due to her involvement in The Getty's purchase of an illicitly excavated golden funerary wreath.&lt;ref name="Combs-Kersel"/&gt; On November 20, 2006, the Director of the museum, [[Michael Brand]], announced that 26 disputed pieces were to be returned to Italy.

In a letter to the [[J. Paul Getty Trust]] on December 18, 2006, True stated that she was being made to "carry the burden" for practices which were known, approved, and condoned by The Getty's Board of Directors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-true29dec29,0,3427365.story?coll=la-home-headlines LATimes.com ~ "Getty lets her take fall, ex-curator says"]&lt;/ref&gt; True testified for the first time in March 2007.

In September 2007, Italy dropped the civil charges against True.&lt;ref name="Combs-Kersel"/&gt; The Getty also announced its plan to return 40 out of 46 objects. On September 26, 2007, Getty Center signed a contract with the Italian Culture [[Ministry (government department)|ministry]] in [[Rome]] to return stolen arts from Italy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7013471.stm BBC NEWS, Getty to hand back 'looted art']&lt;/ref&gt; Forty ancient art works would be returned including: the 5th century BC [[Aphrodite]] [[limestone]] and [[marble]] statue, in 2010; [[fresco]] [[paintings]] stolen from [[Pompeii]]; marble and [[bronze]] sculptures; and [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] vases.

In November 2007, the Greek criminal charges against True were dropped as the statute of limitations had expired. The wreath and three other items from the Getty's collection were returned to Greece.&lt;ref name="Combs-Kersel"/&gt;

==Criminal charges==
All charges against True were eventually dismissed. Because the statute of limitations had expired, she was acquitted in 2007 of charges relating to the acquisition of a 2,500-year-old funerary wreath, which was shown to have been looted from northern Greece.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/11/27/europe/getty.php Intl. ''Herald Tribune'' "Ex-curator acquitted in case of Greek relic"]&lt;/ref&gt; The wreath in question had already been returned to Greece. In 2010, an Italian court dismissed the remainder of the charges against her, holding that the statute of limitations has expired.&lt;ref&gt;Jason Felch, [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2010/10/charges-dismissed-against-getty-curator-marion-true-by-italian-judge.html "Charges dismissed against ex-Getty curator Marion True by Italian judge (updated)"] ''Los Angeles Times'', October 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contested artifacts==

Aphrodite of Morgantina was an [[acrolithic]] sculpture acquired by The Getty in 1988, it is a 7-foot-tall, 1,300-pound statue of limestone and marble.&lt;ref&gt;Flech, Jason, [http://articles.latimes.com/2011/mar/23/entertainment/la-et-return-of-aphrodite-20110323 "The Getty Ship Aphrodite Statue to Sicily: The Iconic Statue, bought in 1988, is among 40 object of disputed origin repatriated."] The LA Times 23 March  2011&lt;/ref&gt; The Museum and True ignored the obvious signs that it was looted.  It was returned to Morgantina in early March, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Morreale, Giovanni, [http://www.timesofsicily.com/chasing-aphrodite-venus-of-morgantina/ "Chasing Aphrodite: Venus of Morgantina"], ''Times of Sicily'' February 16, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that the sculpture actually portrays [[Persephone]] or [[Demeter]], rather than [[Aphrodite]].

[[File:Kouros.jpg|thumb|The Getty kouros]] The [[Getty kouros]] is an over-life-size statue in the form of a late archaic Greek kouros.&lt;ref name=Museum&gt;[J. Paul Getty Museum. Statue of a kouros. Retrieved September 2, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt; The dolomitic marble sculpture was also bought by Frel in 1985 for $7 million and first exhibited there in October 1986. If genuine, it is one of only twelve complete kouroi still extant. If fake, it exhibits a high degree of technical and artistic sophistication by an as-yet unidentified forger. Its status remains undetermined: today the museum's label reads "Greek, about 530 B.C., or modern forgery".&lt;ref name=Museum/&gt;

The Golden Wreath was bought by The Getty in 1994 for $1.15 million.&lt;ref name=Mead/&gt; True was shown the wreath in a Swiss bank vault before purchasing and determined that it was "too dangerous" to purchase, because of its signs of looting. Under the advisement of The Getty's board, True purchased it through Christoph Leon, a Swiss art dealer.&lt;ref name=Mead/&gt;

The '''George C. Marshall Space Flight Center''' ('''MSFC'''), located in Huntsville, Alabama, is the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]]'s civilian [[rocket]]ry and [[spacecraft propulsion]] research center.&lt;ref name=facts&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/msfcfactsheet11032016.pdf |title=Marshall Space Flight Center Fact Sheet |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=November 3, 2016 |website=NASAfacts |publisher=NASA |access-date=March 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest [[NASA]] center, MSFC's first mission was developing the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn launch vehicles]] for the [[Apollo program|Apollo Moon program]]. Marshall has been the agency's lead center for [[Space Shuttle]] propulsion and its [[Space Shuttle external tank|external tank]]; payloads and related crew training; [[International Space Station]] (ISS) design and assembly; and computers, networks, and information management. Located on the [[Redstone Arsenal]] near [[Huntsville, Alabama]], MSFC is named in honor of [[General of the Army (United States)|Army General]] [[George Marshall]].

The center also contains the '''Huntsville Operations Support Center''' ('''HOSC'''), a facility that supports ISS launch, payload and experiment activities at the [[Kennedy Space Center]]. The HOSC also monitors rocket launches from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]] when a Marshall Center payload is on board.

==History==
After the end of the war with Germany in May 1945, a program was initiated to bring to the United States a number of scientists and engineers who had been at the center of Germany's advanced military technologies. The largest and best-known activity was called [[Operation Paperclip]]. In August 1945, 127 missile specialists led by [[Wernher von Braun]] signed work contracts with the [[Ordnance Corps (United States Army)|U.S. Army's Ordnance Corps]]. Most of them had worked on the [[V-2]] missile development under von Braun at [[Peenemünde]]. 
Von Braun and the other Germans were sent to [[Fort Bliss, Texas]], joining the Army's newly formed Research and Development Division Sub-office (Rocket).

For the next five years, von Braun and the German scientists and engineers were primarily engaged in adapting and improving the V-2 missile for U.S. applications; testing was conducted at nearby [[White Sands Missile Range|White Sands Proving Grounds, New Mexico]]. Von Braun had long had a great interest in rocketry for space science and exploration. Toward this, he was allowed to use a [[WAC Corporal]] rocket as a second stage for a V-2; the combination, called Bumper, reached a record-breaking {{convert|250|mi|km}} altitude.&lt;ref&gt;Fidenbach, Peter L.; [http://nmsua.edu/tiopete/files/2008/12/wspgcoldbook.pdf "A Brief History of White Sands Proving Ground"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028154222/http://nmsua.edu/tiopete/files/2008/12/wspgcoldbook.pdf|date=2014-10-28}}, N.M. State Univ.&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II, the production and storage of ordnance shells was conducted by three arsenals nearby to [[Huntsville, Alabama]]. After the war, these were closed, and the three areas were combined to form [[Redstone Arsenal]]. In October 1948, the Chief of Ordnance designated Redstone Arsenal as the center of research and development activities in free-flight rockets and related items, and the following June, the Ordnance Rocket Center was opened. A year later, the [[United States Secretary of the Army|Secretary of the Army]] approved the transfer of the rocket research and development activities from [[Fort Bliss]] to the new center at Redstone Arsenal. Beginning in April 1950, about 1,000 persons were involved in the transfer, including von Braun's group. At this time, R&amp;D responsibility for guided missiles was added, and studies began on a medium-range guided missile that eventually became the [[PGM-11 Redstone|Redstone]] rocket.

Over the next decade, the missile development on Redstone Arsenal greatly expanded. Many small free-flight and guided rockets were developed, and work on the Redstone rocket got underway. Although this rocket was primarily intended for military purposes, von Braun kept space firmly in his mind, and published a widely read article on this subject.&lt;ref&gt;Wernher von Braun; [[Man Will Conquer Space Soon!|"Crossing the Last Frontier"]], ''Collier's Magazine'', March 22, 1952, pp. 24–29, 72, 74&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-1952, the Germans who had initially worked under individual contracts were converted to civil service employees, and in 1954-55, most became U.S. citizens. Von Braun was appointed Chief of the Guided Missile Development Division.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redstone.army.mil/history/chron2b/welcome.html "Redstone Arsenal Complex Chronology, Part II: Nerve Center of Army Missilery, 1950-62 - Section B: The ABMA/AOMC Era, 1956-62"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060716183621/http://www.redstone.army.mil/history/chron2b/welcome.html |date=2006-07-16 }}. Redstone Arsenal Historical Information. United States Army&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1954, von Braun proposed using the Redstone as the main booster of a multi-stage rocket for launching artificial satellites. A year later, a study for [[Project Orbiter]] was completed, detailing plans and schedules for a series of scientific satellites. The Army's official role in the U.S. space satellite program was delayed, however, after higher authorities elected to use the [[Vanguard (rocket)|Vanguard rocket]] then being developed by the [[Naval Research Laboratory]] (NRL).

In February 1956, the [[Army Ballistic Missile Agency]] (ABMA) was established; von Braun was the director of the Development Operations Division. One of the primary programs was a {{convert|1500|mi|km|adj=on}}, single-stage missile that was started the previous year; intended for both the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy, this was designated the [[PGM-19 Jupiter]]. Guidance component testing for this Jupiter intermediate range ballistic missile (IRBM) began in March 1956 on a modified Redstone missile dubbed Jupiter A while re-entry vehicle testing began in September 1956 on a Redstone with spin-stabilized upper stages named Jupiter-C. The first Jupiter IRBM flight took place from Cape Canaveral in March 1957 with the first successful flight to full range on 31 May.&lt;ref&gt;James N. Gibson, ''Nuclear Weapons of the United States, An Illustrated History'', p. 167, Schiffer Publishing Ltd., Atglen, PA, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;  Jupiter was eventually taken over by the U.S. Air Force. The ABMA developed [[Jupiter-C]] was composed of a Redstone rocket first stage and two upper stages for RV tests or three upper stages for Explorer satellite launches. ABMA had originally planned the 20 September 1956 flight as a satellite launch but, by direct intervention of Eisenhower, was limited to the use of 2 upper stages for an RV test flight traveling {{convert|3350|mi|km}} and attaining an altitude of {{convert|682|mi|km}}. While the Jupiter C capability was such that it could have placed the fourth stage in orbit, that mission had been assigned to the NRL.&lt;ref&gt;[https://history.nasa.gov/sputnik/expinfo.html "Data Sheet - Explorer-1 and Jupiter-C"], Dept. of Astronautics, National Air and Space Museum, Smithsonian Institution;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. E. Wolfe and W. J. Truscott, ''Juno Final Report Volume 1, Juno 1: Re-entry Test Vehicles and Explorer Satellites'', JPL, 1960&lt;/ref&gt; Later Jupiter-C flights would be used to launch satellites.

The Soviet Union launched [[Sputnik 1]], the first man-made earth satellite, on October 4, 1957. This was followed on November 3 with the second satellite, [[Sputnik 2]]. The United States attempted a satellite launch on December 6, using the NRL's Vanguard rocket, but it barely struggled off the ground, then fell back and exploded. On January 31, 1958, after finally receiving permission to proceed, von Braun and the ABMA space development team used a Jupiter C in a [[Juno I]] configuration (addition of a fourth stage) to successfully place [[Explorer 1]], the first American satellite, into orbit around the earth.

Effective at the end of March 1958, the U.S. Army Ordnance Missile Command (AOMC), was established at Redstone Arsenal. This encompassed the ABMA and its newly operational space programs. In August, AOMC and [[DARPA|Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (ARPA, a Department of Defense organization) jointly initiated a program managed by ABMA to develop a large space booster of approximately 1.5-million-pounds thrust using a cluster of available rocket engines. In early 1959, this vehicle was designated [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn]].

On April 2, President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] recommended to Congress that a civilian agency be established to direct nonmilitary space activities, and on July 29, the President signed the [[National Aeronautics and Space Act]], creating the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA). The nucleus for forming NASA was the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (NACA), with its 7,500 employees and [[Ames Research Center]] (ARC), [[Langley Research Center]] (LaRC), and [[Glenn Research Center|Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory]] (later LRC, then Glenn RC) becoming the initial operations of NASA.

Despite the existence of an official space agency, the Army continued with certain far-reaching space programs. In June 1959, a secret study on [[Project Horizon]] was completed by ABMA, detailing plans for using the Saturn booster in establishing a manned Army outpost on the Moon. Project Horizon, however, was rejected, and the Saturn program was transferred to NASA.

[[File:army nasa transfer 01.jpg|thumb|left|Ceremony of transfer from Army to NASA July 1, 1960]]
The U.S. manned satellite space program, using the Redstone as a booster, was officially named [[Project Mercury]] on November 26, 1958. With a future goal of manned flight, monkeys Able and Baker were the first living creatures recovered from outer space on May 28, 1959. They had been carried in the [[nose cone]] on a Jupiter missile to an altitude of {{convert|300|mi|km}} and a distance of {{convert|1500|mi|km}}, successfully withstanding 38 times the normal pull of gravity. Their survival during speeds over 10,000 miles per hour was America's first biological step toward putting a man into space.

On October 21, 1959, President Eisenhower approved the transfer of all Army space-related activities to NASA. This was accomplished effective July 1, 1960, when 4,670 civilian employees, about $100 million worth of buildings and equipment, and {{convert|1,840|acre|km2}} of land transferred from AOMC/ABMA to NASA's George C. Marshall Space Flight Center. MSFC officially opened at Redstone Arsenal on this same date, then was dedicated on September 8 by President Eisenhower in person. The Center was named in honor of [[General of the Army (United States)|General of the Army]] [[George Marshall|George C. Marshall]], Army [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Chief of Staff]] during World War II, [[United States Secretary of State]], and [[Nobel Prize]] winner for his world-renowned [[Marshall Plan]].

==Capabilities and projects==
From its initiation, MSFC has been NASA's lead center for the development of rocket propulsion systems and technologies. During the 1960s, the activities were largely devoted to the [[Apollo Program]] – man's first visit to the Moon. In this, the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn Family]] of launch vehicles were designed and tested at MSFC. Following the highly successful [[Moon landing]], including initial scientific exploration, MSFC had a major role in Post-Apollo activities; this included [[Skylab]], the United States' first space station. With a permanent space station as an objective, the [[Space Shuttle]] was developed as a reusable transportation vehicle, and with it came [[Spacelab]] and other experimental activities making use of the Shuttle’ cargo bay. These and other projects are described in a later section. But first, MSFC's present capabilities and projects are addressed.

===Present and future – 2000s onward===
Marshall Space Flight Center has capabilities and projects supporting NASA's mission in three key areas: lifting from Earth (Space Vehicles), living and working in space (International Space Station), and understanding our world and beyond (Advanced Scientific Research).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/missions/index.html|title=Marshall Missions|first=Jennifer|last=Harbaugh|date=3 March 2015|website=nasa.gov|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Space vehicles====
MSFC is NASA's designated developer and integrator of launch systems. The state-of-the-art Propulsion Research Laboratory serves as a leading national resource for advanced space propulsion research. Marshall has the engineering capabilities to take space vehicles from initial concept to sustained service. For manufacturing, the world's largest-known welding machine of its type was installed at MSFC in 2008; it is capable of building major, defect-free components for manned-rated space vehicles.

In early March 2011, NASA Headquarters announced that MSFC will lead the efforts on a new heavy-lift rocket that, like the Saturn V of the lunar exploration program of the late 1960s, will carry large, [[Human-rating certification|man-rated]]  payloads beyond low-Earth orbit. The Center will have the program office for what is being called the [[Space Launch System]] (SLS).&lt;ref&gt;[http://marshallstar.msfc.nasa.gov/3-3-11.pdf "SLS program office at Marshall"], ''Marshall Star'', March 3, 2011, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Constellation Program=====
Before it was cancelled by President [[Barack Obama]] in early 2010, the [[Constellation Program]] had been a major activity in NASA since 2004. In this program, MSFC was responsible for propulsion on the heavy-lift vehicles. These vehicles were designated [[Ares I]] and [[Ares V]], and would replace the aging [[Space Shuttle]] fleet as well as transport humans to the Moon, Mars, and other deep-space destinations.&lt;ref&gt;Connolly, John F.; [http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/163092main_constellation_program_overview.pdf "Constellation Program Overview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070710060512/http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/163092main_constellation_program_overview.pdf |date=2007-07-10 }}", NASA Constellation Program Office, October 2006; .&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 2006, the MSFC Exploration Launch Projects Office began work on the Ares projects. On October 28, 2009, an Ares I-X test rocket lifted off from the newly modified [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|Launch Complex 39B]] at [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC) for a two-minute powered flight; then continued for four additional minutes traveling {{convert|150|mi|km}} down range.

=====Space Shuttle=====
MSFC had responsibility for the Space Shuttle's propulsion engines. On February 1, 2003, the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster]] occurred, with the orbiter disintegrating during reentry and resulting in the death of its seven crew members. Flights of the other Shuttles were put on hold for 29 months. Based on a seven-month investigation, including a ground search that recovered debris from about 38 percent of the Orbiter, together with telemetry data and launch films, indicated that the failure was caused by a piece of insulation that broke off the [[external tank]] during launch and damaged the [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection]] on the Orbiter's left wing.

MSFC was responsible for the external tank, but few or no changes to the tank were made; rather, NASA decided that it was inevitable that some insulation might be lost during launch and thus required that an inspection of the orbiter's critical elements be made prior to reentry on future flights.

NASA retired the Space Shuttle in 2011, leaving America dependent upon the Russian  [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|''Soyuz'']] spacecraft for manned space missions.

=====Orbital Space Plane=====
The initial plans for the Space Station envisaged a small, low-cost [[Crew Return Vehicle]] (CRV) that would provide emergency evacuation capability. The 1986 Challenger disaster led planners to consider a more capable spacecraft. The [[Orbital Space Plane]] (OSP) development got underway in 2001, with an early version expected to enter service by 2010. With the initiation of the Constellation program in 2004, the knowledge gained on the OSP was transferred to Johnson Space Center (JSC) for use in the development of the [[Crew Exploration Vehicle]]. No operational OSP was ever built.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/news/background/facts/ospfacts.html "Beginning a New Era of Space Flight: The Orbital Space Plane"] MSFC Fact Sheet, May 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

====International Space Station====
The [[International Space Station]] is a partnership of the United States, Russian, European, Japanese, and Canadian Space Agencies. The station has continuously had human occupants since November 2, 2000. Orbiting 16 times daily at an average altitude of about {{convert|250|mi|km|abbr=on}}, it passes over some 90 percent of the world's surface. It weighs over {{convert|800,000|lb|kg}}, and a crew of six conducts research and prepares the way for future explorations.

NASA began the plan to build a space station in 1984. The station was named ''Freedom'' in 1988, and changed to the International Space Station (ISS) in 1992. The ISS is composed in modules, and the assembly in orbit started with the delivery of Russian module [[Zarya (spacecraft)|''Zarya'']] in November 1998. This was followed in December by the first U.S. module, ''Unity'' also called Node 1, built by Boeing in facilities at MSFC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/space/spacestation/docs/ISS_overview.pdf|title=Boeing: International Space Station|author=|date=|website=www.boeing.com|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the 21st century started, Space Shuttle flights carried up supplies and additional small equipment, including a portion of the solar power array. The two-module embryonic ISS remained unmanned until the next module, [[Destiny (ISS module)|''Destiny'']], the U.S. Laboratory, arrived on February 7, 2001; this module was also built by Boeing at MSFC. The three-module station allowed a minimum crew of two astronauts or cosmonauts to be on the ISS permanently. In July, [[Quest Joint Airlock|''Quest'']] air-lock was added to ''Unity'', providing the capability for [[extra-vehicular activity]] (EVA).

Since 1998, 18 major U.S. components on the ISS have been assembled in space. In October 2007, [[Harmony (ISS module)|''Harmony'']] or Node 2, was attached to ''Destiny''; also managed by MSFC, this gave connection hubs for European and Japanese modules as well as additional living space, allowing the ISS crew to increase to six. The 18th and final major U.S. and Boeing-built element, the Starboard 6 Truss Segment, was delivered to the ISS in February 2009. With this, the full set of solar arrays could be activated, increasing the power available for science projects to 30&amp;nbsp;kW. That marked the completion of the U.S. "core" of the station.

On 5 March 2010, Boeing turned over to NASA the U.S. on-orbit segment of the ISS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://boeing.mediaroom.com/2010-03-05-Boeing-Transfers-US-Portions-of-International-Space-Station-to-NASA|title=Boeing Transfers US Portions of International Space Station to NASA|last=|first=|date=5 March 2010|website=Boeing|publisher=Boeing|access-date=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is planned that the International Space Station will be operated at least through the end of 2020. With the retirement of the Space Shuttle fleet in 2011, future manned missions to the ISS will depend upon the Russian ''Soyuz'' spacecraft for the immediate future.

====Advanced scientific research====
MSFC is involved in some of the most advanced space research of our time. Scientist/Astronaut researchers aboard the [[International Space Station]] are engaged in hundreds of advanced experiments, most of which could not be conducted except for the zero-gravity environment. The deep-space images from the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] and the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]] are made possible in part by the people and facilities at Marshall. The Center was not only responsible for the design, development, and construction of these telescopes, but it is also now home to the only facility in the world for testing large telescope mirrors in a space-simulated environment. Preliminary work has started on a Hubble successor, the [[James Webb Space Telescope]] (JWST); this will be the largest primary mirror ever assembled in space. In the future, the facility will likely be used for another successor, the [[Advanced Technology Large-Aperture Space Telescope]] (AT-LAST).

The [[National Space Science and Technology Center]] (NSSTC) is a joint research venture between NASA and the seven research universities of the State of Alabama. The primary purpose of NSSTC is to foster collaboration in research between government, academia, and industry. It consists of seven research centers: Advanced Optics, Biotechnology, Global Hydeology &amp; Climate, Information Technology, Material Science, Propulsion, and Space Science. Each center is managed by either MSFC, the host NASA facility, or the [[University of Alabama in Huntsville]], the host university.

=====Deep-space astronomy=====
The [[Hubble Space Telescope]] was launched in April 1990, but gave flawed images. It had been designed at MSFC, but used a primary mirror that had [[spherical aberration]] due to incorrect grinding and polishing by the contractor. The defect was found when the telescope was in orbit. The design was such that repairs were possible, and three maintenance missions were flown in Shuttles during the 1990s. Another servicing mission (STS-109) was flown on March 1, 2002. Each mission resulted in considerable improvements, with the images receiving worldwide attention from astronomers as well as the public.

Based on the success of earlier maintenance missions, NASA decided to have a fifth service mission to Hubble; this was STS-125 flown on May 11, 2009. The maintenance and addition of equipment resulted in Hubble performance considerably better than planned at its origin. It is now expected that the Hubble will remain operational until its successor, the [[James Webb Space Telescope]] (JWST), is available in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jwst.nasa.gov/about.html|title=About Webb/NASA|author=|date=|website=www.jwst.nasa.gov|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts125/main/overview.html|title=NASA - STS-125: The Final Visit|first=Jerry Wright :|last=JSC|date=|website=www.nasa.gov|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Further information|#Hubble Space Telescope}}

The [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]], originating at MSFC, was launched on July 3, 1999, and is operated by the [[Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory]]. With an [[angular resolution]] of 0.5 [[arcsecond]] (2.4 µrad), it has a thousand times better resolution than the first orbiting X-ray telescopes. Its highly [[eliptical]] orbit allows continuous observations up to 85 percent of its 65-hour [[orbital period]]. With its ability to make X-ray images of star clusters, supernova remnants, galactic eruptions, and collisions between clusters of galaxies - in its first decade of operation it has transformed astronomer's view of the high-energy universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chandra.harvard.edu/ten/|title=Chandra :: About Chandra :: The Extraordinary Universe with Chandra|author=|date=|website=chandra.harvard.edu|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope]], initially called the Gamma-Ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST), is an international, multi-agency space observatory used to study the cosmos. It was launched June 11, 2008, has a design life of 5 years and a goal of 10 years. The primary instrument is the Large Area Telescope (LAT) that is sensitive in the photon energy range of 8 to greater than 300 GeV. It can view about 20% of the sky at any given moment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/spacecraft/index.html "Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope"], NASA&lt;/ref&gt;

The LAT is complemented by the GLAST Burst Monitor (GBM) which can detect burst of X-rays and gamma rays in the 8-keV to 3-MeV energy range, overlapping with the LAT. The GBM is a collaborative effort between the U.S. [[National Space Science and Technology Center]] and the [[Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics]] in Germany. MSFC manages the GBM, and Charles A. Meegan of MSFC is the Principal Investigator. Many new discoveries have been made in the initial period of operation. For example, on May 10, 2009, a burst was detected that, by its propagation characteristics, is believed to negate some approaches to a new theory of gravity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/news/first_year.html NASA - Fermi Telescope Caps First Year With Glimpse of Space-Time]. Nasa.gov. Retrieved on 2013-07-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE), with [[Gerald J. Fishman]] of MSFC serving as Principal Investigator, is an ongoing examination of the many years of data from gamma-ray bursts, pulsars, and other transient gamma-ray phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;"The Gamma-Ray Astronomy Team Home Page; {{cite web |url=http://www.batse.msfc.nasa.gov/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108070046/http://www.batse.msfc.nasa.gov/ |archivedate=2011-11-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 [[Shaw Prize]], often called "Asia's Nobel Prize," was shared by Fishman and Italian astronomer [[Enrico Costa (physicist)|Enrico Costa]] for their gamma-ray research.&lt;ref&gt;Roop, Lee; "Gamma rays lead to glory," ''The Huntsville Times'', June 16, 2011, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Research in the ISS=====
For 10 years, MSFC has supported activities in the U.S. Laboratory (''Destiny'') and elsewhere on the International Space Station through the [[Payload Operations and Integration Center|Payload Operations Center]] (POC). The research activities include experiments on topics ranging from human physiology to physical science. Operating around the clock, scientists, engineers, and flight controllers in the POC link Earth-bound researchers throughout the world with their experiments and astronauts aboard the ISS. {{As of|2011|03}}, this has included the coordination of more than 1,100 experiments conducted by 41 space-station crew members involved in over 6,000 hours of science research.

=====Solar system research=====
Teams at Marshall manage NASA's programs for exploring the Sun, the Moon, the planets, and other bodies throughout our solar system. These have included [[Gravity Probe B]], an experiment to test two predictions of Einstein's general theory of relativity, and [[Hinode|Solar-B]], an international mission to study the solar magnetic field and origins of the solar wind, a phenomenon that affects radio transmission on the Earth. The MSFC Lunar Precursor and Robotic Program Office manages projects and directs studies on lunar robotic activities across NASA.

=====Climate and weather research=====
MSFC also develops systems for monitoring the Earth's climate and weather patterns. At the Global Hydrology and Climate Center (GHCC), researchers combine data from Earth systems with satellite data to monitor biodiversity conservation and climate change, providing information that improves agriculture, urban planning, and water-resource management.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ghcc.msfc.nasa.gov/ GHCC / Earth Science Office] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110224052901/http://www.ghcc.msfc.nasa.gov/ |date=2011-02-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Microsatellites=====
On November 19, 2010, MSFC entered the new field of microsatellites with the successful launch of  [[FASTSAT]]  (Fast, Affordable, Science and Technology Satellite). Part of a joint DoD/NASA payload, it was launched by a [[Minotaur IV]] rocket from the [[Kodiak Launch Complex]] on [[Kodiak Island]], Alaska. FASTSAT is a platform carrying multiple small payloads to low-Earth orbit, creating opportunities to conduct low-cost scientific and technology research on an autonomous satellite in space. FASTSAT, weighing just under {{convert|400|lb|kg}}, serves as a full scientific laboratory containing all the resources needed to carry out scientific and technology research operations. It was developed at the MSFC in partnership with the Von Braun Center for Science &amp; Innovation and Dynetics, Inc., both of Huntsville, Alabama. Mark Boudreaux is the project manager for MSFC.

There are six experiments on the FASTSAT bus, including [[NanoSail-D2]], which is itself a nanosatellite – the first satellite launched from another satellite. It was deployed satisfactorily on January 21, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/smallsats/fastsat/ "FASTSAT Latest News and Update"] MSFC Data&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spinoffs====
In addition to supporting NASA's key missions, the spinoffs from these activities at MSFC have contributed broadly to technologies that improve the Nation and the World. In the last decade alone, Marshall generated more than 60 technologies featured as NASA spinoffs. MSFC research has benefited firefighters, farmers, plumbers, healthcare providers, soldiers, teachers, pilots, divers, welders, architects, photographers, city planners, disaster relief workers, criminal investigators, and even video-gamers and golfers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/ "Value for NASA, Benefits for the Nation]" Office of the Chief Technologist, NASA&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s and 1990s – the Shuttle era===
The [[Space Shuttle]] is likely the most complex spacecraft ever built. Although MSFC was not responsible for developing the centerpiece – the [[Space Shuttle orbiter|Orbiter Vehicle]] (OV) – it was responsible for all of the rocket propulsion elements: the OV's three main engines, the [[Space Shuttle external tank|External Tank]] (ET), and the [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|Solid-Rocket Boosters]] (SRBs). MSFC was also responsible for [[Spacelab]], the research facility carried in the Shuttle's cargo bay on certain flights. From the start of the program in 1972, the management and development of Space Shuttle propulsion was a major activity at MSFC. [[Alex McCool|Alex A. McCool, Jr.]] was manager of MSFC's Space Shuttle Projects Office.

====Shuttle propulsion====
Throughout 1980, engineers at MSFC participated in tests related to plans to launch the first Space Shuttle. During these early tests and prior to each later Shuttle launch, personnel in the Huntsville Operations Support Center monitored consoles to evaluate and help solve any problems at the Florida launch that might involve Shuttle propulsion

On April 12, 1981, [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] made the first orbital test flight of a full Space Shuttle with two astronauts. This was designated [[STS-1]] (Space Transportation System-1), and verified the combined performance of the entire system. This was followed by [[STS-2]] on November 12, also using ''Columbia'', primarily to demonstrate safe re-launch of a Shuttle. During 1982, two more test flights ([[STS-3]] &amp; [[STS-4]]) were made. [[STS-5]], launched November 11, was the first operational mission; carrying four astronauts, two commercial satellite were deployed. In all three of these flights, on-board experiments were carried and conducted on pallets in the Shuttle's cargo bay.&lt;ref&gt;[[List of space shuttle missions]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Space Shuttle [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']] was launched on mission [[STS-51-L]] on January 28, 1986. (The sequential numbering changed after 1983, but otherwise this would have been STS-25). One-minute, 13-seconds into flight, the entire ''Challenger'' was [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|enveloped in a fireball and broke into several large segments, killing the seven astronauts]]. Subsequent analysis of the high-speed tracking films and telemetry signals indicated that a leak occurred in a joint on one of the [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|solid rocket boosters (SRBs)]], the escaping flame impinged on the surface of the [[Space Shuttle external tank|external tank (ET)]]; there followed a complex series of very rapid structural failures, and in milliseconds the hydrogen and oxygen streaming from the ruptured tank exploded.

The basic cause of the disaster was determined to be an [[O-ring]] failure in the right SRB; cold weather was a contributing factor. The redesign effort, directed by MSFC, involved an extensive test program to verify that the SRBs were safe. There were no Space Shuttle missions in the remainder of 1986 or in 1987. Flights resumed in September 1988, with sequential numbering starting with [[STS-26]].

====Shuttle missions and payloads====
As a reusable space-launch vehicle, the space shuttles carried a wide variety of payloads – from scientific research equipment to highly classified military satellites. The flights were assigned a Space Transportation System (STS) number, in general sequenced by the planned launch date. The Wikipedia [[list of space shuttle missions]] shows all flights, their missions, and other information.

The first orbital flight (STS-1) by Shuttle ''Columbia'' on April 12, 1981, did not have a payload, but all flights that followed generally had multiple payloads. Through 1989, there were 32 flights; this includes the one on January 28, 1986, when ''Challenger'' was lost, and the delay until September 29, 1988, when flights resumed. During the 1990s, there were 58 flights, giving a total of 95 successful flights through 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/missions.html Space Shuttle Launch Archive].

For the [[Magellan (spacecraft)|Magellan]] planetary spacecraft, MSFC managed the adaptation of the [[Inertial Upper Stage]]. This solid-rocket was used in May 1989 to propel the spacecraft from Orbiter ''Atlantis'' on a 15-month loop around the Sun and eventually into orbit around Venus for four years of radar surface-mapping.

Many Shuttle flights carried equipment for performing on-board research. Such equipment was accommodated in two forms: on pallets or other arrangements in the Shuttle's cargo bay (most often in addition to hardware for the primary mission), or within a reusable laboratory called Skylab. All such experimental payloads were under the general responsibility of MSFC.

=====Pallet experiments=====
Pallet experiments covered a very wide spread of types and complexity, but many of them were in fluid physics, materials science, biotechnology, combustion science, and commercial space processing. For some missions, an aluminum bridge fitting across the cargo bay was used. This could carry 12 standard canisters holding isolated experiments, particularly those under the [[Getaway Special]] (GAS) program. GAS flights were made available at low cost to colleges and universities, American industries, individuals, foreign governments, and others.

On some flights, a variety of pallet experiments constituted the full payload; examples of these include the following:

*[[STS-35|Astronomy Laboratory-1]] (ASTRO-1) was developed by Goddard Space Flight Center and flown on STS-35 in December 1990. The $150-million payload included an X-ray telescope and three ultraviolet (UV) telescopes. The displays to be used by the on-board scientist-astronaut to aim the UV telescopes failed. An astronomer in the MSFC Payload Control Center then did the telescope pointing.
*[[STS-45|Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and Science]] (ATLAS 1) was carried on STS-45 launched in March 1992. This had l2 instruments from the U.S., France, Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, The Netherlands, and Japan. Experiments were conducted in atmospheric chemistry, solar radiation, space plasma physics, and ultraviolet astronomy.

=====Spacelab=====
In addition to the pallet experiments, many other experiments were flown and performed using [[Spacelab]]. This was a reusable laboratory consisting of multiple components, including a pressurized module, an unpressurized carrier, and other related hardware. Under a program managed by MSFC, ten Europeans nations jointly designed, built, and financed the first Spacelab through the European Space Research Organisation ([[ESRO]]. In addition, Japan funded a Spacelab for STS-47, a dedicated mission.&lt;ref&gt;Lord, Douglas R.; [https://archive.org/details/nasa_techdoc_19880009991 "Spacelab: An international success story"] NASA, Jan. 1, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

Over a 15-year period, Spacelab components flew on 22 shuttle missions, the last in April 1998. Examples of Spacelab missions follow:

*[[STS-9|Spacelab 1]] was flown on STS-9, launched November 28, 1983. A Shuttle ''Columbia'' flight, this was the first with six astronauts, including two Payload Specialists from the ESRO. There were 73 experiments carried out in astronomy and physics, atmospheric physics, Earth observations, life sciences, materials sciences, and space plasma physics
*[[STS-50|U.S. Microgravity Laboratory 1]] (USML-1) was launched in June 1992 on STS-50, the first [[Extended Duration Orbiter]]. During 14 days, 31 microgravity experiments were completed in round-the-clock operations. [[STS-73|USML-2]] was launched in October 1995 on STS-73 with an MSFC scientist, [[Frederick W. Leslie]], as an on-board Payload Specialist.

In early 1990, MSFC's new Spacelab Mission Operations Control Center took over the responsibility for controlling all Spacelab missions. This replaced the Payload Operations Control Center formerly situated at the JSC from which previous Spacelab missions were operated.&lt;ref&gt;"Spacelab Mission Operations Control Facility," MSFC Fact Sheet, May 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other major programs====
The advent of the Space Shuttle made possible several major space programs in which MSFC had significant responsibilities. These were the International Space Station, the Hubble Space Telescope, the Chandra X-Ray Observatory, and the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory. The latter three are part of NASA's series of  [[Great Observatories program|Great Observatories]]; this series also includes the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]], but this was not launched by a Space Shuttle and MSFC had no significant role in its development.

=====International Space Station=====
A manned space station had long been in the plans of visionaries. Wernhar von Braun, in his widely read ''Collier's Magazine'' 1953 article, envisioned this to be a huge wheel, rotating to produce gravity-like forces on the occupants.&lt;ref&gt;''Opt.Cet.''; Wernher von Braun; "Crossing the Last Frontier,"&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Project Horizon]], prepared by the U.S. Army in 1959, a space station would be built by assembling spent booster rockets. Following this same basic concept, in 1973 MSFC used a modified stage of Saturn V to put into orbit [[Skylab]], but this was preceded by the Soviet Union's ''[[Salyut]]'' in 1971, then followed by their ''[[Mir]]'' in 1986. Even during Skylab, MSFC began plans for a much more complete space station. President [[Ronald Reagan]] announced plans to build [[Space Station Freedom]] in 1984. Luther B. Powell was MSFC's space station program manager.

By the late 1990s, planning for four different stations were underway: the American ''Freedom'', the Soviet/Russian ''[[Mir-2]]'', the European ''Columbus'', and the Japanese ''[[Japanese Experimental Module|Kibō]]''. In June 1992, with the [[Cold War]] over, American President [[George H. W. Bush]] and Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]] agreed to cooperate on space exploration. Then in September 1993, American Vice-President [[Al Gore, Jr.]], and Russian Prime Minister [[Viktor Chernomyrdin]] announced plans for a new space station. In November, plans for ''Freedom'', ''Mir-2'', and the European and Japanese modules were incorporated into a single [[International Space Station]]. Boeing began as NASA's prime contractor for U.S. hardware in January 1995.

The ISS is composed of a number of modules, sharing primary power from large arrays of solar power cells. The first module, ''[[Zarya]]'' from Russia, was delivered to orbit by a [[Proton rocket]] on November 20, 1998. On December 4, the first American component,  [[Unity (ISS module)|''Unity'']], a connecting module, was carried up by Space Shuttle ''Endeavour'' on flight STS-88; it was then joined with ''Zarya'' to form an embrionic ISS.  ''Unity'' was built by Boeing in MSFC facilities. Additional building supplies were carried to the ISS in May 1999, aboard STS-96.

The ISS continued to be assembled throughout the next decade, and has been continuously occupied since February 7, 2001. In March 2010, Boeing completed its contract and officially turned over to NASA the U.S. on-orbit segment of the ISS.

=====Hubble Space Telescope=====
Shortly after NASA was formed, the [[Orbiting Solar Observatory]] was launched, and was followed by the [[Orbiting Astronomical Observatory]] (OAO) that carried out ultraviolet observations of stars between 1968 and 1972. These showed the value of space-based astronomy, and led to the planning of the Large Space Telescope (LST) that would be launched and maintained from the forthcoming space shuttle. Budget limitations almost killed the LST, but the astronomy community – especially [[Lyman Spitzer]] – and the National Science Foundation pressed for a major program in this area. Congress finally funded LST in 1978, with an intended launch date of 1983.

MSFC was given responsibility for the design, development, and construction of the telescope, while [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] (GFC) was to control the scientific instrument and the ground-control center. As the Project Scientist, MSFC brought on board C. Robert O’Dell, then chairman of the Astronomy Department at the [[University of Chicago]]. Several different people, at various times, served as the project manager. The telescope assembly was designed as a [[Cassegrain reflector]] with hyperbolic mirror polished to be [[diffraction limited]]; the primary mirror had a diameter of {{convert|2.4|m|in|abbr=on}}. The mirrors were developed by the optics firm, Perkin-Elmer. MSFC did not have a facility to check the ‘end-to-end’ performance of the mirror assembly, so the telescope could not be totally checked until launched and placed in service.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman, Robert; ''The Universe in a Mirror: The Saga of the Hubble Space Telescope and Visionaries Who Built It''; Princeton Univ. Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The LST was named the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] in 1983, the original launch date. There were many problems, delays, and cost increases in the program, and the ''Challenger'' disaster delayed the availability of the launch vehicle. Finally, on April 24, 1990, on Mission STS-31, Shuttle ''Discovery'' launched the Hubble telescope successfully into its planned orbit. Almost immediately it was realized that the optical performance was not as expected; analysis of the flawed images showed that the primary mirror had been ground to the wrong shape, resulting in [[spherical aberration]].

Fortunately, the Hubble telescope had been designed to allow in-space maintenance, and in December 1993, mission STS-61 carried astronauts to the Hubble to make corrections and change some components. A second repair mission, STS-82, was made in February 1997, and a third, STS-103, in December 1999. For these repair missions, the astronauts practiced the work in MSFC's Neutral Buoyancy Facility, simulating the weightless environment of space.

Through the 1990s, the Hubble did provide astronomy images that had never before been seen. During the next decade, two additional repair missions were made (March 2002 and in May 2009), eventually bringing the telescope to even better that its initially intended performance.

=====Chandra X-Ray Observatory=====
Even before HEAO-2 (the [[Einstein Observatory]]) was launched in 1978, MSFC began preliminary studies for a larger X-ray telescope. To support this effort, in 1976 an X-Ray Test Facility, the only one of its size, was constructed at Marshall for verification testing and calibration of X-ray mirrors, telescope systems, and instruments. With the success of HEAO-2, MSFC was given responsibility for the design, development, and construction of what was then known as the Advanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility (AXAF). The [[Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory]] (SAO) partners with MSFC, providing the science and operational management.

Work on the AXAF continued through the 1980s. A major review was held in 1992, resulting in many changes; four of the twelve planned mirrors were eliminated, as were two of the six scientific instruments. The planned circular orbit was changed to an elliptical one, reaching one-third of the way to the Moon at its farthest point; this eliminated the possibility of improvement or repair using the Space Shuttle, but it placed the spacecraft above the Earth's radiation belts for most of its orbit.

AXAF was renamed [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]] in 1998. It was launched July 23, 1999, by the Shuttle ''Columbia'' (STS-93). An [[Inertial Upper Stage]] booster adapted by MSFC was used to transport ''Chandra'' to its high orbit Weighing about {{convert|22,700|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, this was the heaviest payload ever launched by a Shuttle. Operationally managed by the SAO, ‘’Chandra’’ has been returning excellent data since being activated. It initially had an expected life of five years, but this has now been extended to 15 years or longer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/chandra/main/index.html "Chandra: Exploring the Invisible Universe"] MSFC&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Compton Gamma Ray Observatory=====
The ''Compton'' Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO) is another of NASA's Great Observatories; it was launched April 5, 1991, on Shuttle flight STS-37. At {{convert|37,000|lb|kg}}, it was the heaviest astrophysical payload ever flown at that time. CGRO was 14 years in development by NASA; TRW was the builder. Gamma radiation (rays) is the highest energy-level of electromagnetic radiation, having energies above 100 [[electronvolt|keV]] and thus frequencies above 10 [[hertz|exahertz]] (10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; Hz). This is produced by [[atom|sub-atomic]] particle interactions, including those in certain astrophysical processes. The continuous flow of cosmic rays bombarding space objects, such as the Moon, generate this radiation Gamma rays also result in bursts from nuclear reactions. The CGRO was designed to image continuous radiation and to detect bursts.

MSFC was responsible for the Burst and Transient Source Experiment, (BATSE). This triggered on sudden changes in gamma count-rates lasting 0.1 to 100 s; it was also capable of detecting less impulsive sources by measuring their modulation using the Earth [[occultation]] technique. In nine years of operation, BATSE triggered about 8000 events, of which some 2700 were strong bursts that were analyzed to have come from distant galaxies.

Unlike the Hubble Space Telescope, the CGRO was not designed for on-orbit repair and refurbishment. Thus, after one of its gyroscopes failed, NASA decided that a controlled crash was preferable to letting the craft come down on its own at random. On June 4, 2000, it was intentionally de-orbited, with the debris that did not burn up falling harmlessly into the Pacific Ocean. At MSFC, [[Gerald J. Fishman]] is the principal investigator of a project to continue examination of data from BATSE and other gamma-ray projects. The 2011 [[Shaw Prize]] was shared by Fishman and Italian [[Enrico Costa (physicist)|Enrico Costa]] for their gamma-ray research.

===1960s and 1970s – the initial decades===
[[File:MSFC rocket park.jpg|thumb|Rockets developed at MSFC and ABMA before it are on display at MSFC.]]
Shortly before activating its new Field Center in July 1960, NASA described the MSFC as the only self-contained organization in the nation that was capable of conducting the development of a space vehicle from the conception of the idea, through production of hardware, testing, and launching operations.

Initially, engineers from Huntsville traveled to Florida to conduct launch activities at the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]]. The first NASA launch facility there ([[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|Launch Complex 39]]) was designed and operated by MSFC, then in on July 1, 1962, the overall site achieving equal status with other NASA centers and was named the Launch Operations Center, later renamed the [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC).

Another major NASA facility, the Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC) located near [[Houston, Texas]], was officially opened in September 1963. Designated the primary center for U.S. space missions and systems involving astronauts, it coordinates and monitors crewed missions through the Mission Control Center. MSC was renamed the [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center]] (JSC) in February 1973. Through the years, there have been a number of ‘turf’ battles between MSFC and MSC/JSC concerning mission responsibilities.

When the Marshall Space Flight Center began official operations in July 1960, Wernher von Braun was the Director and Eberhard Rees was his Deputy for Research and Development. The administrative activities in MSFC were led by persons with backgrounds in traditional U.S. Government functions, but all of the technical heads were individuals who had assisted von Braun in his success at ABMA. The initial technical activities and leaders at MSFC were as follows:&lt;ref&gt;From a NASA-MSFC Organization Chart dated May 25, 1961&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}
* Director – [[Wernher von Braun]]
* Deputy Director for R&amp;D – [[Eberhard Rees|Eberhard F. M. Rees]]
* Reliability Office – H. August Schulze
* Future Projects Office – [[Heinz-Hermann Koelle]]
* Light &amp; Medium Vehicles Office – Hans Hueter
* Saturn Systems Office – O. Hermann Lange
* Technical Program Coordination Office – George N. Constan
* Weapons Systems Office – Werner G. Tiller
* Launch Operations Directorate – [[Kurt H. Debus]]
* Aeroballistics Division – [[Ernst Geissler|Ernst G. Geissler]]
* Computation Division – [[Helmut Hölzer]]
* Fabrication &amp; Assembly Engineering Division – Hans H. Maus
* Guidance &amp; Control Division – [[Walter Haeussermann|Walter Häussermann]]
* Quality Division – [[Dieter Grau|Dieter E. Grau]]
* Research Projects Division – [[Ernst Stuhlinger]]
* Structures &amp; Mechanics Division – [[William A. Mrazek]]
* Test Division – Karl L. Heimburg
{{div col end}}

With the exception of Koelle, all of the technical leaders had come to the United States under [[Operation Paperclip]] after working together at [[Peenemünde]]. Von Braun knew well the capabilities of these individuals and had great confidence in them. This confidence was shown to be appropriate; in the following decade of developing hardware and technical operations that established new levels of complexity, there was never a single failure of their designs during manned flight.

The initial projects at MSFC were primarily continuations of work initiated earlier at ABMA. Of immediate importance was the final preparation of a Redstone rocket that, under [[Project Mercury]] would lift a [[space capsule]] carrying the first American into space. Originally scheduled to take place in October 1960, this was postponed several time and on May 5, 1961, [[astronaut]] [[Alan Shepard]] made America's first [[sub-orbital spaceflight]]. The delays led to a circumstance similar to that of the first satellite; on April 12, 1961, Soviet cosmonaut [[Yuri Gagarin]] had become the first person to orbit the Earth.

By 1965, MSFC had about 7,500 government employees. In addition, most of the prime contractors for launch vehicles and related major items (including [[North American Aviation]], [[Chrysler]], [[Boeing]], [[Douglas Aircraft]], [[Rocketdyne]], and [[IBM]]) collectively had approximately a similar number of employees working in MSFC facilities.

Several support contracting firms were also involved in the programs; the largest of these was Brown Engineering Company (BECO, later [[Teledyne Technologies#Companies|Teledyne Brown Engineering]]), the first high-technology firm in Huntsville and by this time having some 3,500 employees. In the Saturn-Apollo activities, BECO/TBE provided about 20-million [[man-hour]]s of support. Milton K. Cummings was the BECO president, Joseph C. Moquin the executive vice president, William A. Girdini led the engineering design and test work, and Raymond C. Watson, Jr., directed the research and advanced systems activities. [[Cummings Research Park]], the second largest park of this type in the Nation, was named for Cummings in 1973.

====Saturn launch vehicles====
On May 25, 1961, just 20 days after Shepard's flight, President [[John F. Kennedy]] committed the Nation to "achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to Earth".&lt;ref&gt;John F. Kennedy; "Special Message to the Congress on Urgent National Needs." Delivered in person before a joint session of Congress, May 25, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; In what would be called the [[Apollo Program]], the primary mission of MSFC was developing the heavy-lift rockets – the Saturn family. This required the development and equalization of three new liquid-fueled rocket engines, the  [[J-2 (rocket engine)|J-2]], the [[F-1 (rocket engine)|F-1]], and the [[H-1 (rocket engine)]]; in addition, an existing engine, the [[RL10]], was improved for use on Saturns. Leland F. Belew managed the Engine Development Office.&lt;ref&gt;Bilstein, Roger E.; [https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/sp4206.htm "Stages to Saturn: A Technological History of the Apollo/Saturn Launch Vehicles]" NASA History Series;&lt;/ref&gt;
The F-1 engine was, and still is the most powerful single-nozzle liquid-fueled rocket engine ever used in service; each produced 1.5-million-pounds thrust. Originally started by the U.S. Air Force, responsibility for the development was taken over by ABMA in 1959, and the first test firings at MSFC were in December 1963.

=====Saturn I=====
The original vehicle, designated [[Saturn I]], consisted of two propulsion stages and an instrument unit; it was first tested in flight on October 27, 1961. The first stage (S-I) had a cluster of eight H-1 engines, giving approximately 1.5-million-pounds thrust total. The four outboard engines were [[gimbaled thrust|gimbaled]] to allow vehicle steering. The second stage (SIV) had six gimbaled LR10A-3 engines, producing a combined 90-thousand-pounds thrust. Ten Saturn Is were used in flight-testing of Apollo [[boilerplate (spaceflight)|boilerplate]] units. Five of the test flights also carried important auxiliary scientific experiments.

=====Saturn IB=====
The [[Saturn IB]] (alternatively known as the Uprated Saturn I) also had two propulsion stages and an instrument unit. The first stage (S-IB) also had eight H-1 engines with four gimballed, but the stage had eight fixed fins of equal size fitted to the sides to provide aerodynamic stability. The second stage (S-IVB) had a single J-2 engine that gave a more powerful 230-thousand-pounds thrust. The J-2 was gimbaled and could also be restarted during flight. The vehicle was first flight-tested on February 26, 1966. Fourteen Saturn 1Bs (or partial vehicles) were built, with five used in unmanned testing and five others used in manned missions, the last on July 15, 1975.

=====Saturn V=====
The [[Saturn V]] was the pinnacle of developments at MSFC. This was an [[expendable launch system|expendable]], [[Human-rating certification|man-rated]] heavy-lift vehicle that was the most vital element in the Apollo Program. Designed under the direction of [[Arthur Rudolph]], the Saturn V holds the record as the largest and most powerful launch vehicle ever brought to operational status from a combined height, weight, and payload standpoint.

The Saturn V consisted of three propulsion stages and an instrument unit. The first stage (S-IC), had five F-1 engines, giving a combined total of 7.5-million-pounds thrust. These engines were arranged in a cross pattern, with the center engine fixed and the outer four gimballed. The second stage (S-II), had five J-2 engines with the same arrangement as the F-1s and giving a total of 1.0-million-pounds thrust. The third stage (S-IVB) had a single gimballed J-2 engine with 200-thousand-pounds thrust. As previously noted, the J-2 engine could be restarted in flight. The basic configuration for this heavy-lift vehicle was selected in early 1963, and the name Saturn V was applied at that time (configurations that might have led to Saturn II, III, and IV were discarded).

The [[Apollo (spacecraft)|Apollo Spacecraft]] was atop the launch vehicle, and was composed of the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] (LM) and the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command/Service Module]] (CSM) inside the Spacecraft Lunar Module Adapter, with the [[Launch Escape System]] at the very top. The Apollo Spacecraft and its components were developed by other NASA centers, but were flight-tested on Saturn I and IB vehicles from MSFC.

While the three propulsion stages were the "muscle" of the Saturn V, the [[Saturn V Instrument Unit|Instrument Unit]] (IU) was the "brains." The IU was on a 260-inch (6.6-m) diameter, 36-inch (91-cm) high, ring that was held between the third propulsion stage and the LM. It contained the basic guidance system components – a stable platform, accelerometers, a digital computer, and control electronics – as well as radar, telemetry, and other units. Basically the same IU configuration was used on the Saturn I and IB. With IBM as the prime contractor, the IU was the only full Saturn component manufactured in Huntsville.

The first Saturn V test flight was made on November 9, 1967. On July 16, 1969, as its crowning achievement in the Apollo space program, a Saturn V vehicle lifted the Apollo 11 spacecraft and three astronauts on their journey to the Moon. Other Apollo launches continued through December 6, 1972. The last Saturn V flight was on May 14, 1973, in the Skylab Program (described later). A total of 15 Saturn Vs were built; 13 functioned flawlessly, and the other two (intended as backup) remain unused.

=====Fabrication and test facilities=====
Wernher von Braun believed that the personnel designing the space vehicles should have direct, hands-on participation in the building and testing of the hardware. For this, MSFC had facilities comparable with the best to be found in private industries. Included were precision machine shops, giant metal-forming and welding machines, and all types of inspection equipment. For every type of Saturn vehicle, one or more prototypes were fabricated in MSFC shops. Large, special-purpose computers were used in the checkout procedures.

Static test towers had been constructed at ABMA for the Redstone and Jupiter rockets. In 1961, the Jupiter stand was modified to test Saturn 1 and 1B stages. A number of other test stands followed, the largest being the [[Saturn V Dynamic Test Stand]] completed in 1964. At {{convert|475|ft|m}} in height, the entire Saturn V could be accommodated. Also completed in 1964, the S1C Static Test Stand was for live firing of the five F-1 engines of the first stage. Delivering a total of 7.5-million-pounds thrust, the tests produced earthquake-like rumbles throughout the Huntsville area and could be heard as far as {{convert|100|mi|km}} away.&lt;ref&gt;MSFC Pamphlet, "Propulsion Laboratory, Marshall Space Flight Center" 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Saturn activities progressed, external facilities were needed. In 1961, The Michoud Rocket Factory near New Orleans, Louisiana, was selected as the Saturn production site. A {{convert|13,500|acre|km2}} isolated area in [[Hancock County, Mississippi]] was selected to conduct Saturn tests. Known as the Mississippi Test Facility (later renamed the [[John C. Stennis Space Center]]), this was primarily to test the vehicles built at the [[Michoud Assembly Facility|rocket factory]].

====Space Shuttle====
[[File:Space Shuttle Pathfinder OV-098 original configuration.jpg|thumb|A crane hoists [[Space Shuttle Pathfinder]] into the Saturn V Dynamic Test Stand at MSFC to test the procedures in preparation for the dynamic test of [[Space Shuttle Enterprise]].]]
On January 5, 1972, President [[Richard M. Nixon]] announced plans to develop the [[Space Shuttle]], a reusable Space Transportation System (STS) for routine access to space. The Shuttle was composed of the [[Space Shuttle orbiter|Orbiter Vehicle]] (OV) containing the crew and payload, two [[Solid Rocket Booster]]s (SRBs), and the [[Space Shuttle external tank|External Tank]] (ET) that carried liquid fuel for the OV's main engines. MSFC was responsible for the SRBs, the OV's three main engines, and the ET. The Center also received responsibility for [[Spacelab]], a versatile laboratory that would be carried on some flights within the Shuttle's cargo bay. Other assignments included the adaptation of the [[Inertial Upper Stage]] Booster, a two-stage rocket that would lift Shuttle payloads into higher orbits or interplanetary voyages.

The first test firing of an OV main engine was in 1975. Two years later, the first firing of a SRB took place and tests on the ET began at MSFC. The first ''Enterprise'' OV flight, attached to a Shuttle Carrier Aircraft (SCA – an extensively modified [[Boeing 747]]), was in February 1977; this as followed by a free landings in August and October. In March 1978, the ''Enterprise'' OV was flown atop a SCA to MSFC. Mated to an ET, the partial Space Shuttle was hoisted onto the modified [[Saturn V Dynamic Test Stand]] where it was subjected to a full range of vibrations comparable to those in a launch. The second space shuttle, ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', was completed and placed at the KSC for checking and launch preparation. On April 12, 1981, the ''Columbia'' made the first orbital test flight.

====Scientific and engineering research====
From the start, MSFC has had strong research projects in science and engineering. Two of the early activities, Highwater and Pegasus, were performed on a non-interference basis while testing the Saturn I vehicle.

=====Highwater and Pegasus=====
In [[Project Highwater]], the dummy second stage was filled with {{convert|23,000|USgal|m3}} of water as ballast, and, after burnout of the first stage, explosive charges released the water into the upper atmosphere. The project answered questions about the diffusion of liquid propellants in the event that a rocket was destroyed at high altitude. Highwater experiments were carried out in April and November,1962.

Under the [[Pegasus satellite program|Pegasus Satellite Program]], the second stage was instrumented to study the frequency and penetration depth of [[micrometeoroid]]s. Two large panels were folded into the empty stage and, when in orbit, unfolded to present 2,300-square-feet (210-m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of instrumented surface. Three Pegasus satellites were launched during 1965, and stayed in orbit from 3 to 13 years.

=====Lunar exploration=====
[[File:Lunar Roving Vehicle Mobility Test Article Dress Test.jpg|thumb|MSFC tested candidates for the Lunar Roving Vehicle on this test track.]]
The overall Apollo Program was the largest scientific and engineering research activity in history. The actual landing on the Moon led to investigations that could have only been conducted on location. There were six Apollo missions that landed on the Moon: [[Apollo 11]], [[Apollo 12|12]], [[Apollo 14|14]], [[Apollo 15|15]], [[Apollo 16|16]], and [[Apollo 17|17]]. [[Apollo 13]] had been intended as a landing, but only circled the Moon and returned to Earth after an oxygen tank ruptured and crippled power in the CSM.

Except for Apollo 11, all of the missions carried an [[Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package]] (ALSEP), composed of equipment for seven scientific experiments plus a central control station (they were controlled from the Earth) with a [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]] (RTG). Scientists from MSFC were among the co-investigators.

The [[Lunar rover (Apollo)|Lunar Roving Vehicle]] (LRV), popularly known as the "Moon Buggy," was developed by MSFC to provide transportation for exploring a limited amount of the Moon's surface. Not intended in the original planning, by 1969 it became clear that an LRV would be needed to maximize the scientific returns. An LRV was carried on the last three missions, allowing an area similar in size of Manhattan Island to be explored. Outbound they carried an ALSEP to be set up; on the return trip, they carried more than 200 pounds of lunar rock and soil samples. Saverio E. "Sonny" Morea was the LRV project manager at MSFC.&lt;ref&gt;Morea, Saverio E; [http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/lunar/LRV_Historical_Perspective.pdf "The Lunar Roving Vehicle – Historical Perspective"]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Skylab and ATM=====

Even before the first Apollo landing, plans were being made by NASA for an [[Apollo Applications Program]] (AAP). This involved science-based manned space missions using surplus Apollo equipment. The lack of interest by Congress, and subsequent lack of funding, cut out most of the proposed activities – such as [[Manned Venus Flyby]] – but an orbital workshop remained of interest. Under [[Project Horizon]] in the late 1950s, use of spent missile stages for building a manned orbital space station had been proposed, and this general concept was picked up under AAP.

In December 1965, MSFC was authorized to have the Orbital Workshop as a formal project. At a meeting at MSFC on August 19, 1966, [[George Mueller (NASA)|George E. Mueller]], NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, pinned down the final concept for the major elements. MSFC was assigned responsibility for the development of the orbiting space station hardware as well as overall systems engineering and integration.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Air Force was pursuing the [[Manned Orbiting Laboratory]] (MOL), a small space station with a two-man crew, primarily intended for photo reconnaissance. For five years, MOL competed with a NASA station for funding but was finally dropped.
[[File:Neutral Buoyancy Space Simulator.jpg|thumb|MSFC used the Neutral Buoyancy Facility to test Skylab procedures. Here, engineers are testing procedures for repairing Skylab.]]
For testing and mission simulation, a {{convert|75|ft|m|adj=on}}-diameter water-filled tank, the [[Neutral Buoyancy Simulator|Neutral Buoyancy Facility]], was opened at MSFC in March 1968. Engineers and astronauts used this underwater facility to simulate the [[weightlessness]] (or zero-g) environment of space. This was particularly used in training astronauts in activities in zero-g work, especially [[Extra-vehicular activity|spacewalks]].

The Orbital Workshop was designed using the hull of a Saturn V third stage, being fully refitted on the ground. It was renamed [[Skylab]] in February 1970. Two were built – one for flight and the other for testing and mission simulation in the Neutral Buoyancy Facility. Leland F Belew served for eight years as the overall Skylab program director.

Another AAP project that survived was a solar observatory, originally intended to be a deployable attachment to the Apollo spacecraft. Called the [[Apollo Telescope Mount]] (ATM), the project was assigned to MSFC in 1966. As the Orbital Workshop matured into the Skylab, the ATM was added as an appendage, but the two activities were kept as independent development projects. Rein Ise was the ATM project manager at MSFC. The ATM included eight major instruments for observations of the Sun at wavelengths from extreme [[ultraviolet]] to [[infrared]]. The data was mainly collected on special photographic film; during the Skylab missions, the film had to be changed out by astronauts in [[spacewalk]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Ise, Rein, and Eugene H. Cagle; "The Apollo Telescope Mount on Skylab," ''Acta Astronautica'', vol. 1, no. 11–12 (Nov–Dec) 1974, pp 1315–1329&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 14, 1973, the 77-ton (70,000-kg) Skylab was launched into a 235-nautical-mile (435-km) orbit by a Saturn V vehicle (the last to be flown) with Skylab replacing the upper stage. Saturn IB vehicles with their CSMs were used to ferry three-man crews to where they docked with the Skylab. Severe damage was sustained during Skylab launch and deployment, resulting in the loss of the station's micrometeoroid shield/sun shade and one of its main solar panels. This loss was partially corrected by the first crew, launched May 25; they stayed in orbit with Skylab for 28 days. Two additional missions followed with the launch dates of July 28 and November 16, with mission durations of 59 and 84 days, respectively. Skylab, including the ATM, logged about 2,000 hours on some 300 scientific and medical experiments. The last Skylab crew returned to the Earth on February 8, 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Belew, Leland. F. (editor); [https://history.nasa.gov/SP-400/contents.htm "Skylab, Our First Space Station"] NASA publication SP-400, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Apollo–Soyuz=====
The last Saturn IB flight was launched on July 15, 1975, carrying a three-man crew on a six-day mission to dock with a Soviet [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]] spacecraft.. Called the [[Apollo–Soyuz Test Project]] (ASTP), the primary purpose was to provide engineering experience for future joint space flights, but both spacecraft also had scientific experiments. This was the last manned U.S. space mission until April 1981.

=====HEAO=====
The [[HEAO Program|High Energy Astronomy Observatory]] (HEAO) Program involved three missions of large spacecraft in [[low earth orbit|low-Earth orbit]] Each spacecraft was about {{convert|18|ft|m}} in length, weighed between {{convert|6000|and|7000|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, and carried some {{convert|3000|lb|kg}} of experiments for [[X-ray astronomy|X-ray]] and [[gamma-ray astronomy|gamma-ray]] astronomy and [[Cosmic ray|cosmic-ray]] investigations. The project provided revolutionary insights into celestial objects by studying their high-energy radiation from space. Scientists from across the Nation served as [[principal investigator]]s.

The HEAO spacecraft was conceived by MSFC in the late 1960s, but, with the Apollo Program, funding did not become available for some time. Using [[Atlas-Centaur]] launch vehicles, highly successful missions were started in August 1977 (HEAO 1), November 1978 (HEAO 2, also called the Einstein Observatory), and September 1979 (HEAO 3). Fred A. Speer was the HEAO project manager for MSFC.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Wallace H.; [https://history.nasa.gov/SP-466/sp466.htm "The Star Splitters: The High Energy Astronomy Observatories"] NASA, SP-466, 1984;&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Other research=====
Other MSFC-managed space science projects in the 1970s included the [[LAGEOS|Laser Geodynamics Satellite]] (LAGEOS) and [[Gravity Probe A]]. In LAGEOS, laser beams from 35 ground stations are reflected by 422 prismatic mirrors on the satellite to track movements in the Earth's crust. The measurement accuracy is a few centimeters and it tracks the movement of [[tectonic plates]] with comparable accuracy. Conceived and built at MSFC, the LAGEOS was launched by a [[Delta (rocket family)|Delta]] rocket in May 1976.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experimentDisplay.do?id=1976-039A-01 "Laser Tracking Reflector"], NASA Tech Data&lt;/ref&gt;

Gravity Probe A, also called the Redshift Experiment, used an extremely precise [[hydrogen maser]] clock to confirm part of Einstein's [[general relativity|general theory of relativity]]. The probe was launched in June 1976, by a [[Scout (rocket family)|Scout]] rocket, and remained in space for near two hours, as intended.&lt;ref&gt;Vessot, R.F.C. et al. (1980). "Test of Relativistic Gravitation with a Space-Borne Hydrogen Maser" ''. Rev. Ltrs.'', vol. 45, no 26 (1980), pp. 2081–2084&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[organization]]al [[management]], '''mean down time''' ('''MDT''') is the [[average]] time that a system is non-operational. This includes all downtime associated with [[repair]], [[Corrective maintenance|corrective]] and [[preventive maintenance]], self-imposed [[downtime]], and any [[logistics]] or [[Administration (business)|administrative]] delays.

==Description==
The inclusion of delay times distinguishes mean down time from [[mean time to repair]] (MTTR), which includes only downtime specifically attributable to repairs.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite book |title=Reliability, Maintainability and Risk: Practical Methods for Engineers |last=Smith |first=David J. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2011 |publisher=Elsevier |location= |isbn= |page=22 |pages= |accessdate=June 12, 2012|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ewh1jHEyr1AC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mean Down Time key factors:
# '''SYSTEM FAILURE'''
## ''Identification &amp; Recovery Time.''  First, the fact that the system is down must be identified, and maintainers notified &amp; brought to action
## ''[[Fault detection and isolation]].''  The problem must be identified and the faulty part identified.
## ''Parts Procurement.''  Replacement parts needed (if any) must be obtained
## ''System Repair.''  Faulty parts must be replaced or repaired.
# '''SCHEDULED DOWNTIME'''
## ''Preventive Maintenance.''  Preventive maintenance checks are often intrusive and require the system to be down{{Why?|date=September 2010}} (unless [[prognostics]] are used), e.g., checking oil in a car engine.
## ''System Upgrade.''  System downtime is usually required to bring new features to the system.
## ''Calibration.''  Many forms of mechanical or electronic equipment require periodic intrusive calibration.
## ''Other administrative actions''

There are four main ways of reducing MDT:
# ''Design the system to fail less often.''  A more reliable system that doesn't fail often reduces the Down Time.
# ''Make the system [[repairable]].'' If an item is repairable, it will be used for a longer time, and the user will become more familiar with its operation. This will decrease the MDT because the user will be able to detect abnormal operation sooner, and the system will be repaired before the problem becomes too serious.
# ''Let the user repair the system.'' By designing a system to be user-repairable, the MDT will be considerably decreased, as it will not have to be taken out of service for long periods of time while it is being repaired by the manufacturer (which of course includes time spent in transit to and from the manufacturer).
# ''Provide the user with a repair support system.'' The closer critical spare parts are to the system, the faster it will be able to be repaired, as this eliminates the delay involved in ordering parts from the manufacturer and waiting to receive them. Also, the clarity of any instructions on how to repair an item will greatly contribute to the speed at which it is repaired.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5407">'''Meteorological intelligence''' is [[information]] measured, gathered, compiled, exploited, analyzed and disseminated by [[Meteorology|meteorologists]], [[Climatology|climatologists]] and [[Hydrology|hydrologists]] to characterize the current state and/or predict the future state of the [[atmosphere]] at a given location and time.  Meteorological intelligence is a subset of [[environmental intelligence]] and is synonymous with the term [[weather intelligence]].  

The earliest known use of the term "meteorological intelligence" in a written document dates to 1854 on pg. 168 of the Eighth Annual Report of the Board of Regents of the [[Smithsonian Institution]].  This report discusses the Smithsonian Institution's initiative to transmit meteorological intelligence via [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] lines.  An early reference to "meteorological intelligence" in England dates an 1866 issue of [[Edinburgh Review|The Edinburgh Review]] which was a prominent [[Scottish people|Scottish]] journal during the 19th century (Reeve 1866, pg. 75).  

Another documented, early use of the term dates to 1874 in a historical compilation entitled, "The American Historical Record" (Lossing 1874, pg. 125).  In this book, Lossing uses the term to refer to weather observations transmitted over telegraph lines for the purpose of studying the nature of [[storm]]s with the ultimate goal of enhancing public safety through the issuance of storm warnings.  This mission was carried out by the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Army Signal Service]] starting in the 1870s who was responsible for communication (via telegraph) of technical [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] for the army as well as "meteorological intelligence" for the general welfare of the country (Ingersoll 1879, pg. 156).

From the viewpoint of the [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence community]], the term meteorological intelligence is more limited in its use referring to the use of [[Clandestine operation|clandestine]] or technical means to learn about environmental conditions over enemy territory (Shulsky and Schmitt 2002) as in the [[North Atlantic weather war]]. In the [[military intelligence]] context, weather information is often referred to as meteorological or environmental intelligence (Hinsley 1990, pg. 420; Platt 1957, pg. 14; U.S. Congress, pg. 164). 

With regard to private sector [[meteorology]], the term meteorological intelligence is a broad term of art that is primarily associated with observed and forecast weather information provided to decision makers in one of a number of weather sensitive business areas including: Energy, [[forestry]], [[agriculture]], [[telecommunication]]s, [[transport]]ation, [[aviation]], [[entertainment]], [[Retailing|retail]] and [[construction]] (CMOS 2001, pg. 23) .  It is considered a key aspect of [[weather risk management]] for the legal and [[insurance]] industries.

      <comment>No, it is not. Most Christians today are Trinitarians, but not all of them. Historically speaking, Trinitarianism developed in late antiquity, several centuries after the beginning of Christianity, as one of several proposed solutions to the problem of the relationship between Jesus, God the Father, and the Holy Spirit, which is never actually clarified in the Bible itself. Christians before that time were still Christians, perhaps not "orthodox" Christians, but Christians nonetheless.</comment>

"Monotheism" Accessed 23 January 2013, http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/390101/monotheism&lt;/ref&gt;

Monotheism is distinguished from [[henotheism]], a religious system in which the believer worships one god without denying that others may worship different gods with equal validity, and [[monolatrism]], the recognition of the existence of many gods but with the consistent worship of only one deity.&lt;ref&gt;Frank E. Eakin, Jr. ''The Religion and Culture of Israel'' (Boston: Allyn and Bacon, 1971), 70.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "monolatry" was perhaps first used by [[Julius Wellhausen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mackintosh|first=Robert|year=1916|title=Monolatry and Henotheism|journal=Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics|volume=VIII|pages=810|url=https://archive.org/details/EncyclopaediaOfReligionAndEthics.Hastings-selbie-gray.13Vols|accessdate=Jan 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The broader definition of monotheism characterizes the traditions of [[Bábism]], the [[Bahá'í Faith]], [[Balinese Hinduism]], [[Cao Dai|Cao Dai (Caodaiism)]], [[Cheondoism|Cheondoism (Cheondogyo)]], [[Christianity]], [[Deism]], [[Eckankar]], [[Hindu sects]] such as [[Shaivism]] and [[Vaishnavism]], [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], [[Mandaeism]], [[Rastafari]], [[Seicho no Ie]], [[Sikhism]], [[Tengrism]] (Tangrism), [[Tenrikyo|Tenrikyo (Tenriism)]], [[Yazidism]], and [[Zoroastrianism]], and elements of pre-monotheistic thought are found in early [[religion]]s such as [[Atenism]], [[Chinese folk religion|ancient Chinese religion]], and [[Yahweh#Iron Age I (1200–930 BCE): El, Yahweh, and the origins of Israel|Yahwism]].&lt;ref&gt;References:&lt;br&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''[[:wikt:monotheism|monotheism]]'' comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:μόνος|μόνος]]}} (''monos'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2368642 Monos], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', at Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "single" and {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:θεός|θεός]]}} (''theos'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2348292 Theos], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', at Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "[[Deity|god]]".&lt;ref&gt;The compound {{lang|el|μονοθεισμός}} is current only in [[Modern Greek]]. There is a single attestation of {{lang|grc|μονόθεον}} in a Byzantine hymn (''Canones Junii'' 20.6.43; A. Acconcia Longo and G. Schirò, ''Analecta hymnica graeca, vol. 11 e codicibus eruta Italiae inferioris''. Rome: Istituto di Studi Bizantini e Neoellenici. Università di Roma, 1978)&lt;/ref&gt; The English term was first used by [[Henry More]] (1614–1687).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An Explanation of the Grand Mystery of Godliness |last=More |first=Henry |year=1660 |publisher= Flesher &amp; Morden |location=London |page= 62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
{{Primary sources|section|date=July 2017}}

According to Jewish, Christian and Islamic tradition, monotheism was the original religion of humanity; this original religion is sometimes referred to as "the Adamic religion", or, in the terms of [[Andrew Lang]], the "[[Urreligion]]". Scholars of religion largely abandoned that view in the 19th century in favour of an [[development of religion|evolutionary progression]] from [[animism]] via [[polytheism]] to monotheism, but by 1974 this theory was less widely held, and a modified view similar to Lang's became more prominent.&lt;ref name="odccmono"/&gt;{{qn|date=January 2017}} Austrian anthropologist [[Wilhelm Schmidt (linguist)|Wilhelm Schmidt]] had postulated an ''[[Urmonotheismus]]'', "original" or "primitive monotheism" in the 1910s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Armstrong|first1=Karen|title=A History of God: The 4,000-Year Quest of Judaism, Christianity and Islam|date=1994|publisher=Ballantine Books|location=New York City, New York|isbn=978-0345384560|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was objected{{by whom|date=January 2017}} that [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]] had grown up in opposition to polytheism as had Greek philosophical monotheism.&lt;ref name="odccmono"/&gt; More recently, [[Karen Armstrong]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Armstrong|first1=Karen|title=A History of God: The 4,000-Year Quest of Judaism, Christianity and Islam|date=1994|publisher=Ballantine Books|location=New York City, New York|isbn=978-0345384560}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other authors have returned to the idea of an evolutionary progression beginning with [[animism]], which developed into [[polytheism]], which developed into [[henotheism]], which developed into [[monolatry]], which developed into true monotheism.&lt;ref&gt;

| quote                 = Evolutionary interpretations of the history of religion are usually understood to be an explanation of the phenomenon of religion as a result of a continuous development. The model for such development is the growth of living beings which leads to increasingly subtle differentiation and integration. Within such a framework of thought, monotheism would be interpreted as the result of a continuous development from animism, polytheism, henotheism and monolatry to belief in the one and only God. Such a development cannot be proved. Monotheism appeared suddenly, though not without being prepared for.

Christians, on the other hand, argue that the doctrine of the Trinity is a valid expression of monotheism, citing that the Trinity does not consist of three separate [[deities]], but rather the three [[Hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|persons]], who exist [[consubstantiality|consubstantially]] (as one [[Ousia|substance]]) within a single [[Godhead in Christianity|Godhead]].&lt;ref&gt;https://icucourses.com/pages/025-10-three-persons-are-subsistent-relations ; International Catholic University, The One True God: "The fatherhood constitutes the Person of the Father, the sonship constitutes the Person of the Son, and the passive spiration constitutes the Person of the Holy Spirit. But in God "everything is one where there is no distinction by relative opposition." Consequently, even though in God there are three Persons, there is only one consciousness, one thinking and one loving. The three Persons share equally in the internal divine activity because they are all identified with the divine essence. For, if each divine Person possessed his own distinct and different consciousness, there would be three gods, not the one God of Christian revelation. So you will see that in this regard there is an immense difference between a divine Person and a human person."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://orthodoxwiki.org/Holy_Trinity ; Holy Trinity, Orthodox Wiki: "Orthodox Christians worship the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—the Holy Trinity, the one God. Following the Holy Scriptures and the Church Fathers, the Church believes that the Trinity is three divine persons (hypostases) who share one essence (ousia). It is paradoxical to believe thus, but that is how God has revealed himself. All three persons are consubstantial with each other, that is, they are of one essence (homoousios) and coeternal. There never was a time when any of the persons of the Trinity did not exist. God is beyond and before time and yet acts within time, moving and speaking within history."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/topic/Trinity-Christianity ; Britannica, Trinity: "The Council of Nicaea in 325 stated the crucial formula for that doctrine in its confession that the Son is “of the same substance [homoousios] as the Father,” even though it said very little about the Holy Spirit. Over the next half century, Athanasius defended and refined the Nicene formula, and, by the end of the 4th century, under the leadership of Basil of Caesarea, Gregory of Nyssa, and Gregory of Nazianzus (the Cappadocian Fathers), the doctrine of the Trinity took substantially the form it has maintained ever since. It is accepted in all of the historic confessions of Christianity, even though the impact of the Enlightenment decreased its importance."&lt;/ref&gt;

====In Ancient Israel====
{{see also|Yahweh|Elohim|Baal}}
During the 8th century BCE, the worship of [[Yahweh|YHWH]] in Israel was in competition with many other cults, described by the [[Yahwist]] faction collectively as [[Baal]]s. The oldest books of the [[Hebrew Bible]] reflect this competition, as in the books of [[Book of Hosea|Hosea]] and [[Book of Nahum|Nahum]], whose authors lament the "[[apostasy]]" of the people of Israel, threatening them with the wrath of God if they do not give up their polytheistic cults.&lt;ref&gt;1 Kings 18, Jeremiah 2; Othmar Keel, Christoph Uehlinger, Gods, Goddesses, and Images of God in Ancient Israel, Fortress Press (1998); Mark S.

====The Shema====
{{Main article|Shema Yisrael}}
''Shema Yisrael'' ("Hear, [O] Israel") are the [[Incipit|first two words]] of a section of the [[Torah]], and is the title of a prayer that serves as a centerpiece of the morning and evening [[Jewish services|Jewish prayer services]]. The first verse encapsulates the monotheistic essence of Judaism: "Hear, O Israel: the [[YHVH|{{LORD}}]] our God, the {{LORD}} is one" ({{Lang-he-n|שְׁמַע יִשְׂרָאֵל ה' אֱלֹהֵינוּ ה' אֶחָד}}), found in {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|6:4|HE}}, sometimes alternatively translated as "The {{LORD}} is our God, the {{LORD}} alone". Observant Jews consider the Shema to be the most important part of the [[prayer]] service in Judaism, and its twice-daily recitation as a ''[[mitzvah]]'' (religious commandment). It is traditional for Jews to say the Shema as their [[last words]], and for parents to teach their children to say it before they go to sleep at night.

===Christianity===
{{Main article|God in Christianity|Trinity}}
[[File:Shield-Trinity-Scutum-Fidei-English.svg|thumb|right|The [[Trinity]] is the belief in Christianity that God is one God in essence but three persons: [[God the Father]], [[God the Son]] ([[Jesus]]), and [[God the Holy Spirit]].&lt;ref name="def-lateran"&gt;Definition of the [[Fourth Lateran Council]] quoted in ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'' [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_P17.HTM#1FT §253].&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Among [[early Christians]] there was considerable debate over the nature of the [[Godhead (Christianity)|Godhead]], with some denying the incarnation but not the deity of Jesus ([[Docetism]]) and others later calling for an [[Arianism|Arian]] conception of God. Despite at least one earlier local [[Council of Alexandria|synod]] rejecting the claim of Arius, this [[Christology|Christological]] issue was to be one of the items addressed at the [[First Council of Nicaea]].

The First Council of Nicaea, held in [[Nicaea]] (in present-day [[Turkey]]), convoked by the [[Roman Emperors|Roman Emperor]] [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine I]] in 325, was the first [[ecumenical council|ecumenical]]&lt;ref&gt;''Ecumenical'', from [[Koine Greek]] [[Oikoumene|oikoumenikos]], literally meaning worldwide the earliest extant uses of the term for a council are in Eusebius's ''Life of Constantine'' 3.6 [http://khazarzar.skeptik.net/books/eusebius/vc/gr/index.htm] around 338 "{{lang|grc|σύνοδον οἰκουμενικὴν συνεκρότει}}" (he convoked an Ecumenical council), Athanasius's Ad Afros Epistola Synodica in 369 [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/2819.htm], and the Letter in 382 to [[Pope Damasus I]] and the Latin bishops from the [[First Council of Constantinople]][http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF2-14/Npnf2-14-63.htm#TopOfPage]&lt;/ref&gt; council of [[bishop]]s of the [[Roman Empire]], and most significantly resulted in the first uniform Christian [[doctrine]], called the [[Nicene Creed]]. With the creation of the creed, a precedent was established for subsequent general ecumenical councils of bishops ([[synod]]s) to create statements of belief and [[Canon law|canons]] of doctrinal [[orthodoxy]]— the intent being to define a common creed for the [[Christian Church|Church]] and address [[heresy|heretical]] ideas.

One purpose of the council was to resolve [[Arian controversy|disagreements]] in [[Early centers of Christianity#Alexandria|Alexandria]] over the nature of [[Jesus]] in relationship to the Father; in particular, whether Jesus was of the [[Homoousia|same substance]] as [[God the Father]] or merely of [[Homoiousia|similar substance]]. All but two bishops took the first position; while [[Arius]]' argument failed.

Christian orthodox traditions (Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and most Protestants) follow this decision, which was reaffirmed in 381 at the [[First Council of Constantinople]] and reached its full development through the work of the [[Cappadocian Fathers]]. They consider God to be a triune entity, called the Trinity, comprising three "[[person]]s", [[God the Father]], [[God the Son]], and [[God the Holy Spirit]]. These three are described as being "of the same substance" ({{lang|grc|[[ousia|ὁμοούσιος]]}}).

Christians overwhelmingly assert that monotheism is central to the Christian faith, as the Nicene Creed (and others), which gives the orthodox Christian definition of the Trinity, begins: "I believe in one God". From earlier than the times of the [[Nicene Creed]], 325&amp;nbsp;CE, various Christian figures advocated&lt;ref&gt;''Examples of ante-Nicene statements'':

&lt;/ref&gt; the triune [[Holy Mystery|mystery]]-nature of God as a normative profession of faith. According to [[Roger E.

Most modern Christians believe the [[Godhead in Christianity|Godhead]] is triune, meaning that the three persons of the Trinity are in one union in which each person is also wholly God. They also hold to the doctrine of a [[Hypostatic union|man-god]] [[Christ Jesus]] as [[God incarnate#Christianity|God incarnate]]. These Christians also do not believe that one of the three divine figures is God alone and the other two are not but that all three are mysteriously God and one. Other Christian religions, including [[Unitarian Universalism]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Mormonism]] and others, do not share those views on the Trinity.

Some Christian faiths, such as [[God in Mormonism|Mormonism]], argue that the Godhead is in fact three separate individuals which include God the Father, His Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mormon.org/beliefs/articles-of-faith|title=Articles of Faith|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each individual having a distinct purpose in the grand existence of human kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mormon.org/beliefs/jesus-christ|title=Jesus Christ|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Mormons believe that before the Council of Nicaea, the predominant belief among many early Christians was that the Godhead was three separate individuals.

The Qur'an asserts the existence of a single and absolute truth that transcends the world; a unique and indivisible being who is independent of the creation.&lt;ref name="EncRel"&gt;Vincent J. Cornell, Encyclopedia of Religion, Vol 5, pp.3561-3562&lt;/ref&gt; The Qur'an rejects binary modes of thinking such as the idea of a [[Dualistic cosmology|duality]] of God by arguing that both [[Goodness and evil|good and evil]] generate from God's creative act. God is a universal god rather than a local, tribal or parochial one; an absolute who integrates all affirmative values and brooks no evil.&lt;ref name="Barlas96"&gt;Asma Barlas, Believing Women in Islam, p.96&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ash'ari]] theology, which dominated Sunni Islam from the tenth to the nineteenth century, insists on ultimate divine transcendence and holds that divine unity is not accessible to human reason. Ash'arism teaches that human knowledge regarding it is limited to what was has been revealed through the prophets, and on such paradoxes as God's creation of evil, revelation has to accepted ''bila kayfa'' (without [asking] how).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Tamara Sonn|title=Tawḥīd|encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World|editor=John L. Esposito|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2009|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195305135.001.0001/acref-9780195305135-e-0788?rskey=y8ZWqZ|subscription=yes|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tawhid'' constitutes the foremost article of the Muslim [[Shahada|profession of faith]], "There is no god but God, Muhammad is the messenger of God.&lt;ref name="EoI"&gt;D. Gimaret, ''Tawhid'', [[Encyclopedia of Islam]]&lt;/ref&gt; To attribute divinity to a created entity is the only unpardonable sin mentioned in the [[Qur'an]].&lt;ref name="Barlas96"/&gt; The entirety of the Islamic teaching rests on the principle of ''tawhid''.&lt;ref&gt;Ramadan (2005), p.230&lt;/ref&gt;

As they traditionally profess a concept of monotheism with a singular [[God the father|person]] as God, Judaism&lt;ref name="RebShmuleyKosherJoshkel"/&gt; and Islam reject the Christian idea of monotheism. Judaism uses the term [[Shituf]] to refer to non-monotheistic ways of worshiping God. Though Muslims venerate Jesus ([[Jesus in Islam|Isa]] in Arabic) as a prophet, they do not accept the doctrine that he was a begotten son of God.

===Sabianism===
{{Main article|Sabians}}
According to the Quran, the Sabians were a monotheistic religious group.&lt;ref&gt;"the Jews, the Sabians, and the Christians." Bernard Lewis, The Jews of Islam, 1987, page 13&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Hadith]]s account them as converts to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Sahih Bukhari Book #7 Hadith #340, Book #59 Hadith #628, and Book #89 Hadith #299 etc.&lt;/ref&gt; However this interpretation may be related to the fact that [[Quraysh]] polytheists used to describe anyone who converted to Islam with the word "Saba"{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} ({{lang|ar|صبى/صبوت}}) which may either mean that this term was used for anyone who changed his religion or that they identified the message of Muhammed as a "Sabian belief". The former linguistic explanation (i.e. ''saba'' = ''changed his religion'') is the one adopted by most Muslim scholars.

Sabians are often identified with [[Mandaeism]], a small monotheistic community which lives today in [[Iraq]] and call themselves ''Yahyawiya'' ({{lang-ar|يحياوية}}). Muslim scholars traditionally viewed them as followers of the prophets [[Noah]] and ''Yahya'' (i.e. [[John the Baptist]]).&lt;ref name="Khalil ‘ibn Ahmad"&gt;Khalil ‘ibn Ahmad (d. 786–787), who was in Basra before his death, wrote: "The Sabians believe they belong to the prophet Noah, they read ''[[Zaboor]]'' (see also [[Book of Psalms]]), and their religion looks like Christianity." He also states that "they worship the angels."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Atenism==
{{Main article|Atenism}}
[[File:La salle dAkhenaton (1356-1340 av J.C.) (Musée du Caire) (2076972086).jpg|upright=1.3|thumb|Pharaoh [[Akhenaten]] and his family adoring the Aten.]]

[[Amenhotep IV]] initially introduced [[Atenism]] in Year 5 of his reign (1348/1346 BCE) during the [[18th dynasty]] of the [[New Kingdom]]. He raised [[Aten]], once a relatively obscure Egyptian [[Solar deity]] representing the disk of the sun, to the status of Supreme God in the Egyptian pantheon.&lt;ref&gt;Rosalie David, op. cit., p.125&lt;/ref&gt; To emphasise the change, Aten's name was written in the [[cartouche]] form normally reserved for Pharaohs, an innovation of Atenism. This religious reformation appears to coincide with the proclamation of a [[Sed festival]], a sort of royal jubilee intended to reinforce the Pharaoh's divine powers of kingship. Traditionally held in the thirtieth year of the Pharaoh's reign, this possibly was a festival in honour of [[Amenhotep III]], who some Egyptologists think had a [[coregency]] with his son Amenhotep IV of two to twelve years.

Year 5 is believed to mark the beginning of Amenhotep IV's construction of a new capital, [[Akhetaten]] (''Horizon of the Aten''), at the site known today as [[Amarna]]. Evidence of this appears on three of the boundary [[stele|stelae]] used to mark the boundaries of this new capital. At this time, Amenhotep IV officially changed his name to Akhenaten (''Agreeable to Aten'') as evidence of his new worship. The date given for the event has been estimated to fall around January 2 of that year. In Year 7 of his reign (1346/1344 BCE), the capital was moved from [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] to Akhetaten (near modern Amarna), though construction of the city seems to have continued for two more years. In shifting his court from the traditional ceremonial centres Akhenaten was signalling a dramatic transformation in the focus of religious and political power.

The move separated the Pharaoh and his court from the influence of the priesthood and from the traditional centres of worship, but his decree had deeper religious significance too—taken in conjunction with his name change, it is possible that the move to Amarna was also meant as a signal of Akhenaten's symbolic death and rebirth. It may also have coincided with the death of his father and the end of the coregency. In addition to constructing a new capital in honor of Aten, Akhenaten also oversaw the construction of some of the most massive [[Egyptian temple|temple]] complexes in ancient Egypt, including one at [[Karnak]] and one at Thebes, close to the old temple of [[Amun]].

In Year 9 (1344/1342 BCE), Akhenaten declared a more radical version of his new religion, declaring Aten not merely the supreme god of the Egyptian pantheon, but the only God of Egypt, with himself as the sole intermediary between the Aten and the Egyptian people. Key features of Atenism included a ban on idols and other images of the Aten, with the exception of a rayed solar disc, in which the rays (commonly depicted ending in hands) appear to represent the unseen spirit of Aten. Aten was addressed by Akhenaten in prayers, such as the ''[[Great Hymn to the Aten]]'': "O Sole God beside whom there is none".

The details of Atenist theology are still unclear. The exclusion of all but one god and the prohibition of idols was a radical departure from Egyptian tradition, but most scholars see Akhenaten as a practitioner of [[monolatrism|monolatry]] rather than monotheism, as he did not actively deny the existence of other gods; he simply refrained from worshiping any but Aten. It is known that Atenism did not solely attribute divinity to the Aten. Akhenaten continued the [[imperial cult#Ancient Egypt|cult]] of the Pharaoh, proclaiming himself the [[Son of God|son of Aten]] and encouraging the Egyptian people to worship him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancientegyptonline.co.uk/amarnareligion.html|title=Ancient Egypt Gods: The Aten|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptian people were to worship Akhenaten; only Akhenaten and Nefertiti could worship Aten directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hart|first=George|title=The Routledge dictionary of Egyptian gods and goddesses|year=2005|edition=2nd|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-34495-1|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Akhenaten's successors, Egypt reverted to its traditional religion, and Akhenaten himself came to be reviled as a heretic.

==Chinese view==
{{Main article|Shangdi|Tian|Mohism}}
[[File:天-bronze-shang.svg|thumb|upright|[[Shang Dynasty]] [[bronze script]] character for ''tian'' (天), which translates to Heaven and sky.]]
The orthodox faith system held by most dynasties of [[China]] since at least the [[Shang Dynasty]] (1766&amp;nbsp;BCE) until the modern period centered on the worship of ''[[Shangdi]]'' (literally "Above Sovereign", generally translated as "God") or [[Tian|Heaven]] as an omnipotent force.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Homer H. Dubs, "Theism and Naturalism in Ancient Chinese Philosophy," ''Philosophy of East and West'', Vol. 9, No. 3/4, 1959&lt;/ref&gt; This faith system pre-dated the development of [[Confucianism]] and [[Taoism]] and the introduction of [[Buddhism]] and [[Christianity]]. It has features of monotheism in that Heaven is seen as an omnipotent entity, a [[Incorporeality|noncorporeal]] force with a [[personal god|personality]] [[transcendent reality|transcending]] the world. From the writings of [[Confucius]] in the ''[[Analects]]'', it is known Confucius believed that Heaven cannot be deceived, Heaven guides people's lives and maintains a personal relationship with them, and that Heaven gives tasks for people to fulfill in order to teach them of virtues and morality.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; However, this faith system was not truly monotheistic since other lesser gods and spirits, which varied with locality, were also worshiped along with ''Shangdi''. Still, later variants such as [[Mohism]] (470 BCE–c.391 BCE) approached true monotheism, teaching that the function of lesser gods and ancestral spirits is merely to carry out the will of ''Shangdi'', akin to the angels in Abrahamic religions which in turn counts as only one god. In [[Mozi]]'s ''Will of Heaven'' (天志), he writes:

{{quote box |width=60em |align=center
|quote="I know Heaven loves men dearly not without reason. Heaven ordered the sun, the moon, and the stars to enlighten and guide them. Heaven ordained the four seasons, Spring, Autumn, Winter, and Summer, to regulate them. Heaven sent down snow, frost, rain, and dew to grow the five grains and flax and silk that so the people could use and enjoy them. Heaven established the hills and rivers, ravines and valleys, and arranged many things to minister to man's good or bring him evil. He appointed the dukes and lords to reward the virtuous and punish the wicked, and to gather metal and wood, birds and beasts, and to engage in cultivating the five grains and flax and silk to provide for the people's food and clothing. This has been so from antiquity to the present."

且吾所以知天之愛民之厚者有矣，曰以磨為日月星辰，以昭道之；制為四時春秋冬夏，以紀綱之；雷降雪霜雨露，以長遂五穀麻絲，使民得而財利之；列為山川谿谷，播賦百事，以臨司民之善否；為王公侯伯，使之賞賢而罰暴；賊金木鳥獸，從事乎五穀麻絲，以為民衣食之財。自古及今，未嘗不有此也。
|source=''Will of Heaven'', Chapter 27, Paragraph 6, ca. 5th century BCE
}}

Worship of ''Shangdi'' and Heaven in ancient China includes the erection of shrines, the last and greatest being the [[Temple of Heaven]] in Beijing, and the offering of prayers. The ruler of China in every Chinese dynasty would perform annual sacrificial rituals to ''Shangdi'', usually by slaughtering a completely healthy bull as sacrifice. Although its popularity gradually diminished after the advent of Taoism and Buddhism, among other religions, its concepts remained in use throughout the pre-modern period and have been incorporated in later religions in China, including terminology used by early Christians in China. Despite the rising of non-theistic and pantheistic spirituality contributed by Taoism and Buddhism, Shangdi was still praised up until the end of the [[Qing Dynasty]] as the last ruler of the Qing declared himself [[son of heaven]].

{{main|Proto-Indo-European religion}}

The supreme god of the [[Proto-Indo-European religion]] was the god [[Dyeus|*''Dyḗus Pḥ&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;tḗr '']]. A number of words derived from the name of this supreme deity are used in various [[Indo-European languages]] to denote a monotheistic God.

In western Eurasia, the ancient traditions of the Slavic religion contained elements of monotheism. In the sixth century AD, the Byzantine chronicler [[Procopius]] recorded that the Slavs "acknowledge that one god, creator of lightning, is the only lord of all: to him do they sacrifice an ox and all sacrificial animals."&lt;ref name=katicic2008&gt;{{cite book |last=Katičić |first=Radoslav |title=Božanski boj: Tragovima svetih pjesama naše pretkršćanske starine |year=2008 |publisher=IBIS GRAFIKA |location=Zagreb |isbn=978-953-6927-41-8 |url=http://ir.nmu.org.ua/bitstream/handle/123456789/120570/96db5654f2d3025b46454ace91716506.pdf |ref=Katičić 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018000746/http://ir.nmu.org.ua/bitstream/handle/123456789/120570/96db5654f2d3025b46454ace91716506.pdf |archivedate=2015-10-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The deity to whom Procopius is referring is the storm god [[Perún]], whose name is derived from [[Perkwunos|*''Perk&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;unos'']], the Proto-Indo-European god of lightning.

Hindu views are broad and range from monism, through pantheism and panentheism (alternatively called monistic theism by some scholars) to monotheism and even atheism. Hinduism cannot be said to be purely polytheistic. Hindu religious leaders have repeatedly stressed that while God's forms are many and the ways to communicate with him are many, God is one. The ''[[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]]'' of the ''[[murti]]'' is a way to communicate with the abstract one god (''[[Brahman]]'') which creates, sustains and dissolves creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islam101.com/religions/hinduism/conceptOfGod.htm |title=Concept Of God In Hinduism By Dr Naik |publisher=Islam101.com |accessdate=2012-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"When at first the unborn sprung into being, He won His own dominion beyond which nothing higher has been in existence" ([[Atharva Veda]] 10.7.31)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vedah.com/org2/literature/atharva_veda/spritual_hymns.html Atharva Veda: Spiritual &amp; Philosophical Hymns] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007123304/http://www.vedah.com/org2/literature/atharva_veda/spritual_hymns.html |date=October 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of auspicious qualities of God are countless, with the following six qualities (''bhaga'') being the most important:
* ''Jñāna'' (omniscience), defined as the power to know about all beings simultaneously
* ''[[Aishvarya]]'' (sovereignty, derived from the word [[Ishvara]]), which consists in unchallenged rule over all
* ''Shakti'' (energy), or power, which is the capacity to make the impossible possible
* ''Bala'' (strength), which is the capacity to support everything by will and without any fatigue
* ''Vīrya'' (vigor), which indicates the power to retain immateriality as the supreme being in spite of being the material cause of mutable creations
* ''Tejas'' (splendor), which expresses His self-sufficiency and the capacity to overpower everything by His spiritual effulgence&lt;ref name= Tapasyananda&gt;{{cite book

In the [[Shaivite]] tradition, the ''[[Shri Rudram]]'' ([[Sanskrit]] श्रि रुद्रम्), to which the Chamakam (चमकम्) is added by scriptural tradition, is a Hindu ''[[stotra]]'' dedicated to [[Rudra]] (an epithet of [[Shiva]]), taken from the [[Yajurveda]] (TS 4.5, 4.7).&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of the Śatarudriya see: Kramrisch, pp. 71-74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a full translation of the complete hymn see: Sivaramamurti (1976)&lt;/ref&gt; Shri Rudram is also known as ''Sri Rudraprasna'', ''{{IAST|Śatarudrīya}}'', and ''Rudradhyaya''. The text is important in [[Vedanta]] where [[Shiva]] is equated to the Universal supreme God. The hymn is an early example of enumerating the [[Names of God|names of a deity]],&lt;ref&gt;For the {{IAST|Śatarudrīya}} as an early example of enumeration of divine names, see: Flood (1996), p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; a tradition developed extensively in the [[sahasranama]] literature of [[Hinduism]].

The [[Nyaya]] school of Hinduism has made several arguments regarding a monotheistic view. The Naiyanikas have given an argument that such a god can only be one. In the ''Nyaya Kusumanjali'', this is discussed against the proposition of the ''[[Mimamsa]]'' school that let us assume there were many demigods (''[[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]]s'') and sages (''[[rishi]]s'') in the beginning, who wrote the Vedas and created the world. Nyaya says that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[If they assume such] omniscient beings, those endowed with the various superhuman faculties of assuming infinitesimal size, and so on, and capable of creating everything, then we reply that the ''law of parsimony'' bids us assume only one such, namely Him, the adorable Lord. There can be no confidence in a non-eternal and non-omniscient being, and hence it follows that according to the system which rejects God, the tradition of the Veda is simultaneously overthrown; there is no other way open.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In other words, Nyaya says that the polytheist would have to give elaborate proofs for the existence and origin of his several celestial spirits, none of which would be logical, and that it is more logical to assume one eternal, omniscient god.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yP-fIislexUC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;lpg=PA161&amp;dq=In+other+words,+Nyaya+says+that+the+polytheist+would+have+to+give+elaborate+proofs+for+the+existence+and+origin+of+his+several+celestial+spirits,+none+of+which+would+be+logical,+and+that+it+is+more+logical+to+assume+one+eternal,+omniscient+god.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XcvJAwws4J&amp;sig=mJlpVrEaVtXqdq6u0n6kt6vzuNQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiEsZ7mt_zSAhVP5mMKHc5PBc4Q6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=In%20other%20words,%20Nyaya%20says%20that%20the%20polytheist%20would%20have%20to%20give%20elaborate%20proofs%20for%20the%20existence%20and%20origin%20of%20his%20several%20celestial%20spirits,%20none%20of%20which%20would%20be%20logical,%20and%20that%20it%20is%20more%20logical%20to%20assume%20one%20eternal,%20omniscient%20god.&amp;f=false|title=The Arian Christian Doctrines: The Origins of Christianity|last=Studies|first=Institute for Metaphysical|last2=Inc|first2=The Institute for Metaphysi Studies|last3=MM|first3=MR Charles D.

[[Sikh]]s believe in one, timeless, omnipresent, supreme creator. The opening verse of the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], known as the [[Mul Mantra]], signifies this:

:{{lang-pa|ੴ ਸਤਿ ਨਾਮੁ ਕਰਤਾ ਪੁਰਖੁ ਨਿਰਭਉ ਨਿਰਵੈਰੁ ਅਕਾਲ ਮੂਰਤਿ ਅਜੂਨੀ ਸੈਭੰ ਗੁਰ ਪ੍ਰਸਾਦਿ ॥}}
:[[Transliteration]]: ikk ōankār sat(i)-nām(u) karatā purakh(u) nirabha'u niravair(u) akāla mūrat(i) ajūnī saibhan&lt;small&gt;(g)&lt;/small&gt; gur(a) prasād(i).
:One Universal creator God, The supreme Unchangeable Truth, The Creator of the Universe, Beyond Fear, Beyond Hatred, Beyond Death, Beyond Birth, Self-Existent, by Guru's Grace.

The word "ੴ" ("Ik ōaṅkār") has two components. The first is ੧, the digit "1" in [[Gurmukhi]] signifying the singularity of the creator. Together the word means: "One Universal creator God".

It is often said that the 1430 pages of the [[Guru Granth Sahib]] are all expansions on the Mul Mantra. Although the Sikhs have many names for God, some derived from [[Islam]] and [[Hinduism]], they all refer to the same Supreme Being.

The Sikh holy scriptures refer to the One God who pervades the whole of space and is the creator of all beings in the [[universe]]. The following quotation from the Guru Granth Sahib highlights this point:
{{quote|
"Chant, and meditate on the One God, who permeates and pervades the many beings of the whole Universe. God created it, and God spreads through it everywhere. Everywhere I look, I see God. The Perfect Lord is perfectly pervading and permeating the water, the land and the sky; there is no place without Him."|Guru Granth Sahib, Page 782}}

However, there is a strong case for arguing that the Guru Granth Sahib teaches [[monism]] due to its non-dualistic tendencies:
{{quote|
{{lang-pa|ਸਹਸ ਪਦ ਬਿਮਲ ਨਨ ਏਕ ਪਦ ਗੰਧ ਬਿਨੁ ਸਹਸ ਤਵ ਗੰਧ ਇਵ ਚਲਤ ਮੋਹੀ ॥੨॥}}&lt;br&gt;
"You have thousands of Lotus Feet, and yet You do not have even one foot. You have no nose, but you have thousands of noses. This Play of Yours entrances me." |[[Guru Granth Sahib]], Page 13}}

Sikhs believe that God has been given many names, but they all refer to the One [[God]], [[VāhiGurū]]. Sikhs believe that members of other religions such as Islam, Hinduism and [[Christianity]] all worship the same God, and the names [[Allah]], [[Ar-Rahim|Rahim]], [[Al-Karim|Karim]], [[Hari]], [[Rama|Raam]] and [[Brahman|Paarbrahm]] are frequently mentioned in the Sikh holy scriptures. Although there is no set reference to God in Sikhism, the most commonly used Sikh reference to God is [[Akal Purakh]] (which means "the true immortal") or [[Waheguru]], the Primal Being.

===Ancient Greek religion===
{{main|Ancient Greek religion}}

====Classical Greece====
[[File:Xenophanes in Thomas Stanley History of Philosophy.jpg|thumb|right|Fictionalized portrait of [[Xenophanes]] from a 17th-century engraving]]

The surviving fragments of the poems of the classical Greek philosopher [[Xenophanes of Colophon]] suggest that he held views very similar to those of modern monotheists.&lt;ref&gt;McKirahan, Richard D. "Xenophanes of Colophon. ''Philosophy Before Socrates''. Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company, 1994. 61. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; His poems harshly criticize the traditional notion of anthropomorphic gods, commenting that "...if cattle and horses and lions had hands or could paint with their hands and create works such as men do,... [they] also would depict the gods' shapes and make their bodies of such a sort as the form they themselves have."&lt;ref&gt;Diels-Kranz, ''Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker'', Xenophanes frr. 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Xenophanes declares that there is "...one god, greatest among gods and humans, like mortals neither in form nor in thought."&lt;ref name="osborne62"&gt;Osborne, Catherine. "Chapter 4." ''Presocratic Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction''. Oxford UP. 62. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Xenophanes's theology appears to have been monist, but not truly monotheistic in the strictest sense.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; Although some later philosophers, such as [[Antisthenes]], believed in doctrines similar to those expounded by Xenophanes, his ideas do not appear to have become widely popular.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

In [[Plato]]'s writings, he often presents [[Socrates]] as speaking of "the God" in the singular form. He does, however, often speak of the gods in the plural form as well. The [[Euthyphro dilemma]], for example, is formulated as "Is that which is holy loved by the gods because it is holy, or is it holy because it is loved by the gods?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lamb|first1=W. R.

====Hellenistic Religion====
{{main|Hellenistic religion}}
The development of pure (philosophical) monotheism is a product of the [[Late Antiquity]]. During the 2nd to 3rd centuries, [[origins of Christianity|early Christianity]] was just one of several competing religious movements advocating monotheism.

"[[Henology|The One]]" (Τὸ Ἕν) is a concept that is prominent in the writings of the [[Neoplatonists]], especially those of the philosopher [[Plotinus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wyller|first1=Egil A.|title=Henologische Perspektiven II: zu Ehren Egil A.

[[File:Columns of the Temple of Apollo at Delphi, Greece.jpeg|thumb|Remains of the [[Temple of Apollo (Delphi)|Temple of Apollo]] at Delphi, Greece.]]

A number of oracles of [[Apollo]] from [[Didyma]] and [[Clarus]], the so-called "theological oracles", dated to the 2nd and 3rd century CE, proclaim that there is only one highest god, of whom the gods of polytheistic religions are mere manifestations or servants.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dictionary of Deities and Demons in the Bible]], s.v. "Apollo".&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] concept of the "Uncaused Cause"—never incorporated into the polytheistic ancient Greek religion—has been used by many exponents of Abrahamic religions to articulate their arguments for the existence of the Judeo-Christian-Islamic version of God.

The [[Hypsistarian]]s were a religious group who believed in a most high god, according to Greek documents. Later revisions of this Hellenic religion were adjusted towards Monotheism as it gained consideration among a wider populace. The worship of Zeus as the head-god signaled a trend in the direction of monotheism, with less honour paid to the fragmented powers of the lesser gods.

==New religious movements==
{{Expand section|date=July 2012}}
Various [[New religious movements]], such as [[Cao Dai|Cao Đài]], [[Tenrikyo]], [[Seicho no Ie]], and [[Cheondoism]], are monotheistic.

==Tengrism==
{{See also|Tengrism}}
Tengrism or Tangrism (sometimes stylized as Tengriism), occasionally referred to as Tengrianism &lt;!-- Do not put non-English translations on the English Wikipedia page --&gt;, is a modern term&lt;ref&gt;
The spelling ''Tengrism'' is found in the 1960s, e.g. Bergounioux (ed.), ''Primitive and prehistoric religions'', Volume 140, Hawthorn Books, 1966, p. 80.
''Tengrianism'' is a reflection of the Russian term, {{lang|ru|Тенгрианство}}. It is reported in 1996 ("so-called Tengrianism") in Shnirelʹman (ed.), ''Who gets the past?: competition for ancestors among non-Russian intellectuals in Russia'', Woodrow Wilson Center Press, 1996, {{ISBN|978-0-8018-5221-3}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4iwHp8asmsdEC&amp;pg=PA31 p. 31] in the context of the nationalist rivalry over [[Bulgars#Legacy|Bulgar legacy]].

In ''[[Irk Bitig]]'', Tengri is mentioned as ''Türük Tängrisi'' (God of Turks).&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Paul Roux, Die alttürkische Mythologie, p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; The term is perceived among [[Turkic peoples]] as a ''national'' religion.

In [[Sino-Tibetan peoples|Sino-Tibetan]] and [[Altaic mythologies|Turco-Mongol]] traditions, the Supreme God is commonly referred to as the ruler of Heaven, or the Sky Lord granted with omnipotent powers, but it has largely diminished in those regions due to [[ancestor worship]], [[Taoism]]'s [[pantheistic]] views and Buddhism's rejection of a creator God, although Mahayana Buddhism does seem to keep a sense of divinity. On some occasions in the mythology, the Sky Lord as identified as a male has been associated to mate with an Earth Mother, while some traditions kept the omnipotence of the Sky Lord unshared.

==Native American religion==
Native American theology may be monotheistic, polytheistic, henotheistic, animistic, or some combination thereof.

Cherokee for example are monotheist as well as pantheist.

The [[Great Spirit]], called ''[[Wakan Tanka]]'' among the [[Sioux]],&lt;ref name=Ostler&gt;Ostler, Jeffry. The Plains Sioux and U.S. Colonialism from Lewis and Clark to Wounded Knee. Cambridge University Press, Jul 5, 2004. {{ISBN|0521605903}}, pg 26.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Gitche Manitou]]'' in [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]], is a conception of universal spiritual force, or [[God|supreme being]] prevalent among some [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] and [[First Nations|First Nation]] cultures.&lt;ref name=Thomas&gt;Thomas, Robert Murray. Manitou and God: North-American Indian Religions and Christian Culture. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2007. {{ISBN|0313347794}} pg 35.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Lakota people|Lakota]] activist [[Russell Means]] a better translation of ''Wakan Tanka'' is the Great Mystery.&lt;ref name=Means&gt;Means, Robert. Where White Men Fear to Tread: The Autobiography of Russell Means. Macmillan, 1995. {{ISBN|0312147619}} pg 241.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers have interpreted [[Aztec philosophy]] as fundamentally monotheistic or panentheistic. While the populace at large believed in a polytheistic pantheon, Aztec priests and nobles might have come to an interpretation of [[Teotl]] as a single universal force with many facets.&lt;ref name="iepMaffie"&gt;{{cite web|author=James Maffie|title=Aztec Philosophy|work= [[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|date= 2005|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/a/aztec.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been criticism to this idea, however, most notably that many assertions of this supposed monotheism might actually come from post-Conquistador bias, imposing an Antiquity pagan model unto the Aztec.&lt;ref&gt;James Maffie, Aztec Philosophy: Understanding a World in Motion, University Press of Colorado, 15/03/2014&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22123">[[Music]] has been used in [[psychological operations]]. The term '''music torture''' is sometimes used by critics of the practice of playing [[loud music]] incessantly to prisoners or people besieged.

The [[United Nations]] and the [[European Court of Human Rights]] have banned the use of loud music in [[interrogation]]s.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} The term [[torture]] is sometimes used to describe the practice. While it is acknowledged by US interrogation experts that it causes discomfort, it has also been characterized by them as causing no "long-term effects".&lt;ref name=BbcMusicTorture20030523&gt;

Music and sound have been usually used as part of a combination of interrogation methods, today recognized by international bodies as amounting to torture.&lt;ref&gt;UN Committee Against Torture 1997 "Concluding observations: Israel. 09/05/1997."  {{cite web |url=http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/1B3ED23212DCBE3B05256547005C47FA |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728224401/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/1B3ED23212DCBE3B05256547005C47FA |archivedate=2014-07-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Attacking all senses without leaving any visible traces, they have formed the basis of the widely discussed torture in [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo]] and [[Abu Ghraib prison|Abu Ghraib]]. They were, however, devised much earlier in the 1950s and early 1960s, as a way to counter so-called Soviet "brainwashing".&lt;ref&gt;McCoy, Alfred W (2006). ''A Question of Torture.

"Detainees have reported being routinely subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment during arrest and detention. Many have told Amnesty International that they were tortured and ill-treated by US and UK troops during interrogation. Methods often reported include prolonged sleep deprivation; beatings; prolonged restraint in painful positions, sometimes combined with exposure to loud music; prolonged hooding; and exposure to bright lights. Virtually none of the allegations of torture or ill-treatment has been adequately investigated by the authorities."

=== [[Greece]] ===
According to recent research, the [[Greek military junta of 1967–74|Greek military Junta]] (1967–1974) used the above-mentioned combination of interrogation techniques, including music. This took place in the headquarters of the Special Interrogation Unit of Greek Military Police (EAT/ESA), Athens. New interviews with survivors, held there in 1973, talk about the use of songs, popular hits of the time: these were played loudly and repeatedly from loudspeakers as the detainee had to stand without rest, food, drink or sleep.&lt;ref&gt;Papaeti Anna (2013). “Music, Torture, Testimony: Reopening the Case of the Greek Military Junta (1967–74).” the world of music (special issue): Music and Torture | Music and Punishment 2:1(2013), guest edited by M. J. Grant and Anna Papaeti, pp. 73–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==

In the book ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' by [[Anthony Burgess]] and the subsequent [[A Clockwork Orange (film)|film]] based upon it, a rebellious teenager is subjected to brutal experimental brain-washing techniques that cause him to feel physical pain if he has similar violent thoughts to those that sent him to jail in the first place; as an accidental side-effect, he has the same response if he hears [[Beethoven's Ninth Symphony]].  Later, a man tortures him by locking him in a room where the symphony is played loudly.

In ''[[Back to the Future]]'', Marty used music made by [[Van Halen]] to scare his dad, George McFly, awake, implying that since that kind of music did not exist in that time, it would scare him.

In ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'', a helicopter squadron plays classical music, [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Ride of the Valkyries]]'', over loudspeakers on-board their helicopters while attacking a Viet Cong village, as a form of psychological warfare.

In [[Woody Allen]]'s early film ''[[Bananas (film)|Bananas]]'', a prisoner is tortured by being tied up in a room while operetta, featuring an annoying coluratora soprano, is played over and over on a cheap record-player. 

In ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]'', Mimi played "[[Panama (song)|Panama]]" by Van Halen repeatedly to drive Drew and friends from his house.

In an episode of the U.S. television show ''[[Burn Notice]]'' Sam Axe plays loud music to a prisoner to break his will.

In the film ''[[The Men Who Stare at Goats (film)|The Men Who Stare at Goats]]'', a take-off of the [[Barney &amp; Friends]] ending song "I Love You" is played in the cells of Iraqi detainees as a form of torture.

In the TV series ''[[Homeland (TV series)|Homeland]]'', [[Grindcore]] is used to keep a prisoner awake.

In ''Power Rangers Megaforce'', Emma sings a song to help the rangers defeat Dischord.

In the series 'Lost', [[drum and bass]] music is used to keep an islander's boyfriend awake and indoctrinated and tortured.

In one episode of 'The Flash' Cisco plays 'Never Gonna Give You Up' on repeat to Hartley get him to reveal information they need.

Public awareness of the use of this technique is widespread enough that it can be used in satirical attacks on popular culture:
{{quotation|"Hollywood — Several days after Paris Hilton announced that she will release a music album, the Pentagon has decided to buy 50,000 copies of her upcoming album to use against insurgents in the volatile Anbar province in western Iraq."&lt;ref name=DatelineHollywood&gt;{{cite news|url=http://datelinehollywood.com/archives/2006/06/12/us-military-to-attack-insurgents-with-paris-hilton-album/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20060615002213/http://datelinehollywood.com/archives/2006/06/12/us-military-to-attack-insurgents-with-paris-hilton-album/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-06-15 |title=U.S. MILITARY TO ATTACK INSURGENTS WITH PARIS HILTON ALBUM |publisher=[[Dateline Hollywood]] |author= |date= |accessdate=2007-11-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the TV series ''[[American Horror Story]]'', in the second season titled ''[[American Horror Story: Asylum|Asylum]]'', the song "[[Dominique]]" is played constantly for the asylum patients in the episode "[[Welcome to Briarcliff]]".

In the TV series "[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]", the song "Easy Street" by "The Collapsable Hearts Club" is played repeatedly to [[Daryl Dixon]] in order to torture him.

In [[Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (film)]] a captured British intelligence officer under interrogation in a Soviet prison is subjected to disturbing sounds being repeatedly played through a pair of headphones

==Musicians' protests==

On 9 December 2008 the ''[[Associated Press]]'' reported that various musicians were coordinating their objections to the use of their music as a technique for softening up captives through an initiative called Zero dB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Zero dB is an initiative against music torture set up by legal charity [[Reprieve (organisation)|Reprieve]], which represents over thirty prisoners in Guantanamo Bay. Zero dB aims to stop torture music by encouraging widespread condemnation of the practice and by calling on governments and the UN to uphold and enforce the Convention Against Torture and other relevant treaties. The initiative is backed by the Musicians Union which is calling on British musicians to voice their outrage against the use of music to torture.

Musicians and the wider public are making their own silent protests against music torture which are being shown on Zero dB. A series of silent protests and actions are planned through 2009. Participating musicians will include minutes of silence in their concerts to draw their audience's attention to the USA's use of deafening music against captives.

According to the ''Associated Press'' [[FBI]] agents stationed at Guantanamo Bay reported that the use of deafening music was common.&lt;ref name=AP2008-12-09/&gt;
According to the ''Associated Press''
Guantanamo Bay spokesmen [[Commander]] [[Pauline Storum]]: 
:{| class="wikitable" border="1"

:''"...wouldn't give details of when and how music has been used at the prison, but said it isn't used today. She didn't respond when asked whether music might be used in the future."&lt;ref name=AP2008-12-09/&gt;
|}

Among the musicians united in their objections were [[Christopher Cerf (musician and television producer)|Christopher Cerf]], a composer for the children's show [[Sesame Street]], and [[Tom Morello]]
of [[Rage Against the Machine]] and [[Audioslave]].&lt;ref name=AP2008-12-09/&gt;
Others include [[Massive Attack]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGS5o4KoOCk You Tube video]&lt;/ref&gt; [[R.E.M.]], [[The Roots]], [[Rise Against]], [[Rosanne Cash]], [[Pearl Jam]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], [[Trent Reznor]], [[Billy Bragg]], [[Michelle Branch]], [[Jackson Browne]], [[T-Bone Burnett]], [[David Byrne]], [[Marc Cohn]], [[Steve Earle]], [[Limp Bizkit]], [[System of a Down]], [[Disturbed (band)|Disturbed]], [[the Entrance Band]], [[Skinny Puppy]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/feb/07/skinny-puppy-payment-guantanamo&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Joe Henry]].&lt;ref&gt;

[[Image:Peter Francken in his studio.jpg|thumb|300px|This 2009 photo shows music production using a [[digital audio workstation]] (DAW) with [[multi-monitor]] set-up.]]
'''Electronic and digital music technology''' is the use of electronic or digital instruments, [[computer]]s, electronic [[effects unit]]s, [[software]] or [[digital audio]] equipment by a [[musician]], [[composer]], [[sound engineer]], [[DJ]] or [[record producer]] to make, perform&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=m:tech educational services|title=What is Music Technology?|url=http://www.mtechonline.co.uk/schools/what-is-music-technology.html|accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[sound recording|record]] [[music]]. The term usually refers to the use of electronic devices, electronic and digital instruments, [[computer hardware]] and [[computer software]] that is used in the [[performance]], playback, [[Sound recording and reproduction|recording]], [[musical composition|composition]], [[sound recording and reproduction]], [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]], [[Music informatics|analysis]] and [[Digital audio editor|editing]] of music.

Music technology is connected to both artistic and technological creativity. Musicians and music technology experts are constantly striving to devise new forms of expression through music, and they are physically creating new devices and software to enable them to do so. Although in the 2010s, the term is most commonly used in reference to modern electronic devices and computer software such as [[digital audio workstation]]s and [[Protools]] digital sound recording software, electronic and digital musical technologies have precursors in the [[Music technology (electric)|electric music technologies]] of the early 20th century, such as the electromechanical [[Hammond organ]], which was invented in 1929. In the 2010s, the [[Ontology|ontological]] range of music technology has greatly increased, and it may now be electronic, digital, software-based or indeed even purely conceptual.

==Education==

===Professional training===
{{see also|Audio engineer|Category:Audio engineering schools}}
Music technology is taught at many different educational levels, including college diplomas and university degrees at the undergraduate and graduate level. The study of music technology is usually concerned with the creative use of technology for creating new sounds, performing, [[Sound recording and reproduction|recording]], [[Programming (music)|programming]] [[Music sequencer|sequencers]] or other music-related electronic devices, and manipulating, mixing and reproducing music. Music technology programs train students for careers in "...sound engineering, computer music, audio-visual production and post-production, mastering, scoring for film and multimedia, audio for [[video games|games]], software development, and multimedia production."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/music/technology|title=Music Technology - NYU Steinhardt|author=|date=|website=steinhardt.nyu.edu|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those wishing to develop new music technologies often train to become an [[Audio engineers#Research and development|audio engineer working in R&amp;D]].&lt;ref name="wisegeek"&gt;{{cite web|last=wiseGeek|title=What Is Audio Engineering?|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-audio-engineering.htm|accessdate=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the increasing role of interdisciplinary work in music technology, individuals developing new music technologies may also have backgrounds or training in [[computer programming]], [[computer hardware]] design, [[acoustics]], [[record producer|record producing]] or other fields.

===Use in music education===
In the 2010s, electronic and digital music technologies are widely used to assist in [[music education]] for training students in high school, college and university music programs. [[Electronic keyboard]] labs are used for cost-effective beginner group piano instruction in colleges and universities.

==History==

==Synthesizers and drum machines==
[[File:R.A.Moog minimoog 2.jpg|thumb|right|An early [[Minimoog]] synthesizer by R.A. Moog Inc. from 1970.]]
A [[synthesizer]] is an [[electronic musical instrument]] that generates electric signals that are converted to sound through [[instrument amplifier]]s and [[loudspeaker]]s or [[headphones]]. Synthesizers may either [[#Imitative synthesis|imitate existing sounds]] (instruments, vocal, natural sounds, etc.), or generate new electronic [[timbres]] or sounds that did not exist before. They are often played with an electronic [[musical keyboard]], but they can be controlled via a variety of other input devices, including [[music sequencers]], [[MIDI controller|instrument controllers]], [[#Fingerboard controller|fingerboards]], [[guitar synthesizer]]s, [[wind controller]]s, and [[electronic drum]]s. Synthesizers without built-in controllers are often called [[sound modules]], and are controlled using a controller device.

Synthesizers use various methods to generate a signal. Among the most popular waveform synthesis techniques are [[subtractive synthesis]], [[additive synthesis]], [[wavetable synthesis]], [[frequency modulation synthesis]], [[phase distortion synthesis]], [[physical modeling synthesis]] and [[sample-based synthesis]]. Other less common synthesis types include [[Subharmonic synthesizer|subharmonic synthesis]], a form of additive synthesis via subharmonics (used by [[Trautonium|mixture trautonium]]), and [[granular synthesis]], sample-based synthesis based on grains of sound, generally resulting in [[soundscape]]s or [[Cloud (music)|clouds]]. In the 2010s, synthesizers are used in many genres of [[pop music|pop]], [[rock music|rock]] and [[dance music]]. Contemporary [[classical music]] [[composer]]s from the 20th and 21st century write compositions for synthesizer.

The development of the modern synthesizer was spurred on by the invention of the miniaturized [[transistor]] in 1947. The lightweight transistors made it was possible to make [[synthesizer]]s much more portable and complex. A new breed of synthesizers appeared, mainly in [[America]]. American inventor [[Robert Moog]]'s [[synthesizer]] designs in the 1960s were a significant advancement in the field over its predecessors. This was partially owed to new technologies that became available, such as the [[Semiconductors|newly developed semiconductors]]. These new instruments were less expensive and became available worldwide. These were capable of producing a vast range of complex sounds. Later versions often incorporated automatic rhythm units, called [[drum machine]]s. They had more popularity than any synthesizer from the past. The release of [[Wendy Carlos]]' album ''[[Switched-On Bach]]'' in 1968 brought [[Moog synthesizer|Moog's synthesizer]] to the general public's attention. The album demonstrated that besides creating strange sounds, the [[synthesizer]] could be used to make beautiful music.

===Drum machines===
[[File:Yamaha RY30 front.png|thumb|A [[Yamaha]] RY30 Drum Machine]]
A [[drum machine]] is an [[electronic musical instrument]] designed to imitate the [[sound]] of [[drum kit|drum]]s, [[cymbal]]s, other [[percussion instrument]]s, and often [[basslines]]. Drum machines either play back prerecorded samples of drums and cymbals or synthesized re-creations of drum/cymbal sounds in a rhythm and tempo that is programmed by a musician. Drum machines are most commonly associated with [[electronic dance music]] genres such as [[house music]], but are also used in many other genres. They are also used when [[session musician|session drummers]] are not available or if the production cannot afford the cost of a professional drummer. In the 2010s, most modern drum machines are [[music sequencer|sequencers]] with a sample playback ([[rompler]]) or [[synthesizer]] component that specializes in the reproduction of drum [[timbre]]s. Though features vary from model to model, many modern drum machines can also produce unique sounds, and allow the user to compose unique [[drum beat]]s and patterns.

Electro-mechanical drum machines were first developed in 1949, with the invention of the [[Chamberlin|Chamberlin Rhythmate]]. Transistorized electronic drum machines later appeared in the 1960s. The [[Ace Tone]] Rhythm Ace, created by [[Ikutaro Kakehashi]], began appearing in [[popular music]] from the late 1960s, followed by drum machines from [[Korg]] and Ikutaro's later [[Roland Corporation]] also appearing in popular music from the early 1970s.&lt;ref name="sos_roland"&gt;{{citation |last=Reid |first=Gordon |year=2004 |title=The History Of Roland Part 1: 1930&amp;ndash;1978 |journal=[[Sound on Sound]] |issue=November |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/nov04/articles/roland.htm |accessdate=19 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sly and the Family Stone]]'s 1971 album ''[[There's a Riot Goin' On]]'' helped to popularize the sound of early drum machines, along with [[Timmy Thomas]]' 1972 [[R&amp;B]] hit "[[Why Can't We Live Together]]" and [[George McCrae]]'s 1974 [[disco]] hit "[[Rock Your Baby]]" which used early Roland rhythm machines.&lt;ref name="collins"&gt;Mike Collins (2014), [https://books.google.com/books?id=tdEABAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA320 ''In the Box Music Production: Advanced Tools and Techniques for Pro Tools'', page 320], [[CRC Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Early drum machines sounded drastically different than the drum machines that gained their peak popularity in the 1980s and defined an entire decade of pop music. The most iconic drum machine was the [[Roland TR-808]], widely used in [[hip hop]] and [[dance music]]. Other classic drum machines include the [[Alesis|Alesis HR-16]], [[Korg Mini Pops|Korg Mini Pops 120]], [[E-mu|E-MU SP-12]], [[Elektron (company)|Elektron]] SPS1 Machinedrum, [[Roland CR-78]], [[PAiA Electronics|PAiA]] Programmable Drum Set, [[LinnDrum]], [[Roland TR-909]] and [[Oberheim DMX]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Felton|first1=David|title=Top Ten Classic Drum Machines|url=http://www.attackmagazine.com/features/top-ten-classic-drum-machines/|website=Attack Magazine|accessdate=December 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sampling technology==
{{see also|Sampler (musical instrument)|}}

Digital sampling technology, introduced in the 1980s, has become a staple of [[music production]] in the 2000s. Devices that use [[Sampler (musical instrument)|sampling]], record a sound digitally (often a musical instrument, such as a [[piano]] or [[flute]] being played), and replay it when a key or pad on a controller device (e.g., an [[electronic keyboard]], [[electronic drum]] pad, etc.) is pressed or triggered. Samplers can alter the sound using various [[effects unit|audio effects]] and audio processing. Sampling has its roots in [[France]] with the sound experiments carried out by [[Musique Concrete]] practitioners.

In the 1980s, when the technology was still in its infancy, digital samplers cost tens of thousands of dollars and they were only used by the top [[recording studio]]s and musicians. These were out of the price range of most musicians. Early samplers include the 12-bit [[Toshiba]] [[Technodelic|LMD-649]]&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;''[[:nl:Rockin'f|Rockin'f]]'', March 1982, [http://tokyosky.sub.jp/tokyosky_webmasters_blog/2011/02/f-19823-lmd-649-1982.html pages 140-141]&lt;/ref&gt; and the 8-bit [[Emulator I]] in 1981. The latter's successor, the [[Emulator II]] (released in 1984), listed for $8,000.&lt;ref name="Electronic Music Pioneers"&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Kettlewell
 | first = Ben
 | author-link = 
 | title = Electronic Music Pioneers
 | publisher = Pro Music Press
 | location = USA
 | date = 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samplers were released during this period with high price tags, such as the [[Kurzweil Music Systems|K2000]] and [[K2500]].

The first affordable sampler, the [[Akai|AKAI S612]], became available in the mid-1980s and retailed for US$895. Other companies soon released affordable samplers, including the [[Ensoniq Mirage|Mirage Sampler]], [[Oberheim Electronics|Oberheim DPX-1]], and more by [[Korg]], [[Casio]], [[Yamaha]], and [[Roland]]. Some important hardware samplers include the [[Akai|Akai Z4/Z8]], [[Ensoniq ASR-10]], [[Roland Corporation|Roland V-Synth]], [[Casio FZ-1]], [[Kurzweil K250]], [[Akai MPC60]], [[Ensoniq Mirage]], [[Akai S1000]], [[E-mu Emulator]], and [[Fairlight CMI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Solida|first1=Scot|title=The 10 most important hardware samplers in history|url=http://www.musicradar.com/news/tech/the-10-most-important-hardware-samplers-in-history-361471|website=Music Radar|accessdate=December 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the biggest uses of sampling technology was by [[hip-hop music]] [[DJ]]s and performers in the 1980s. Before affordable sampling technology was readily available, DJs
would use a technique pioneered by [[Grandmaster Flash]] to manually repeat certain parts in a song by juggling between two separate turntables. This can be considered as an early precursor of sampling. In turn, this [[turntablism]] technique originates from Jamaican [[dub music]] in the 1960s, and was introduced to American hip hop in the 1970s.

In the 2000s, most professional recording studios use digital technologies. In the 2010s, many samplers exist in the digital-only realm. This new generation of digital samplers are capable of reproducing and manipulating sounds. New genres of music have formed which would be impossible without sampling. Advanced sample libraries have made complete performances of [[orchestra]]l compositions possible that sound similar to a live performance.&lt;ref name="Musical Instruments" /&gt; Modern sound libraries allow musicians to have the ability to use the sounds of almost any instrument in their productions.

==MIDI==
{{see also|MIDI|}}
[[File:Synth rack @ Choking Sun Studio.jpg|thumb|alt=Several rack-mounted synthesizers that share a single controller|MIDI allows multiple instruments to be played from a single controller (often a keyboard, as pictured here), which makes stage setups much more portable. This system fits into a single rack case, but prior to the advent of MIDI. it would have required four separate, heavy full-size keyboard instruments, plus outboard mixing and [[effects unit]]s.]]
[[MIDI]] has been the musical instrument industry standard interface since the 1980s through to the present day.&lt;ref name="fact"/&gt; It dates back to June 1981, when [[Roland Corporation]] founder [[Ikutaro Kakehashi]] proposed the concept of standardization between different manufacturers' instruments as well as computers, to [[Oberheim Electronics]] founder [[Tom Oberheim]] and [[Sequential Circuits]] president [[Dave Smith (engineer)|Dave Smith]]. In October 1981, Kakehashi, Oberheim and Smith discussed the concept with representatives from [[Yamaha]], [[Korg]] and [[Kawai (company)|Kawai]].&lt;ref name="chadab5100"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chadabe|first=Joel|authorlink=Joel Chadabe|date=1 May 2000|title=Part IV: The Seeds of the Future|journal=Electronic Musician|publisher=Penton Media|volume=XVI|issue=5|url=http://www.emusician.com/gear/0769/the-electronic-century-part-iv-the-seeds-of-the-future/145415|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928230435/http://www.emusician.com/gear/0769/the-electronic-century-part-iv-the-seeds-of-the-future/145415|archivedate=28 September 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, the MIDI standard was unveiled by Kakehashi and Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/news/technical-grammy-award-ikutaro-kakehashi-and-dave-smith|title=Technical GRAMMY Award: Ikutaro Kakehashi And Dave Smith|date=29 January 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/videos/technical-grammy-award-recipients-ikutaro-kakehashi-and-dave-smith-at-special-merit-awards|title=Ikutaro Kakehashi, Dave Smith: Technical GRAMMY Award Acceptance|date=9 February 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[NAMM]] show in [[Los Angeles]] of 1983, [[MIDI]] was released. A demonstration at the convention showed two previously incompatible analog [[synthesizer]]s, the [[Sequential Circuits|Prophet 600]] and [[Roland Jupiter-6]], communicating with each other, enabling a player to play one keyboard while getting the output from both of them. This was a massive breakthrough in the 1980s, as it allowed synths to be accurately layered in live shows and studio recordings. MIDI enables different electronic instruments and electronic music devices to communicate with each other and with computers. The advent of MIDI spurred a rapid expansion of the sales and production of electronic instruments and music software.

In 1985, several of the top keyboard manufacturers created the [[MIDI Manufacturers Association|MIDI Manufacturers Association (MMA)]]. This newly founded association standardized the MIDI protocol by generating and disseminating all the documents about it. With the development of the MIDI File Format Specification by [[Opcode]], every music software company's [[Music sequencer|MIDI sequencer software]] could read and write each other's files.

Since the 1980s, [[personal computers]] developed and became the ideal system for utilizing the vast potential of [[MIDI]]. This has created a large consumer market for software such as MIDI-equipped [[electronic keyboard]]s, [[Music sequencer|MIDI sequencers]] and [[Digital Audio Workstation]]s. With universal MIDI protocols, electronic keyboards, sequencers, and drum machines can all be connected together.

Some universally accepted varieties of [[Comparison of MIDI editors and sequencers|MIDI software applications]] include music instruction software, MIDI sequencing software, music notation software, [[hard disk]] recording/editing software, patch editor/sound library software, computer-assisted composition software, and [[Software synthesizer|virtual instruments]]. Current developments in computer hardware and specialized software continue to expand MIDI applications.

==Computers in music technology==

Computer and synthesizer technology joining together changed the way music is made, and is one of the fastest changing aspects of music technology today. [[Max Mathews|Dr. Max Matthews]], a telecommunications engineer at [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]]' Acoustic and Behavioural Research Department, is responsible for some of the first digital music technology in the 50s. [[Max Mathews|Dr. Matthews]] also pioneered a cornerstone of music technology; [[Analog-to-digital converter|analog to digital conversion]].

The first generation of professional commercially available computer music instruments, or [[workstation]]s as some companies later called them, were very sophisticated elaborate systems that cost a great deal of money when they first appeared. They ranged from $25,000 to $200,000.&lt;ref name="Electronic Music Pioneers" /&gt; The two most popular were the [[Fairlight CMI|Fairlight]], and the [[Synclavier]].

It was not until the advent of [[MIDI]] that [[general-purpose computer]]s started to play a role in music production. Following the widespread adoption of MIDI, computer-based [[Comparison of MIDI editors and sequencers|MIDI editors and sequencers]] were developed. MIDI-to-[[CV/Gate]] converters were then used to enable [[analogue synthesizer]]s to be controlled by a MIDI sequencer.&lt;ref name="russ2012"&gt;{{cite book	 | last      = Russ         |first      = Martin	 | year      = 2012	 | title     = Sound Synthesis and Sampling	 | url       = https://books.google.com/books?id=X9h5AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA192	 | publisher = [[CRC Press]]	 | ISBN     = 1136122141	 | page      = 192	 | accessdate = 26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reduced prices in [[personal computer]]s caused the masses to turn away from the more expensive [[workstation]]s. Advancements in technology have increased the speed of hardware processing and the capacity of memory units. Software developers write new, more powerful programs for sequencing, recording, notating, and mastering music.

==2000s==
[[Music sequencer]] software, such as [[Pro Tools]], [[Logic Audio]] and many others, are  the most widely used form of contemporary music technology in the 2000s. Such programs allow the user to record acoustic sounds with a [[microphone]], [[audio mixing|mix tracks]] record or [[MIDI]] musical sequences, which may then be organized along a timeline and edited on a [[flat-panel display]] of a [[computer]] or [[Digital Audio Workstation]]. Musical segments recorded on can be copied and duplicated ad infinitum, without any loss of fidelity or added noise (a major contrast from [[analog recording]], in which every copy leads to a loss of fidelity and added noise). Digital music can be edited and processed using a multitude of audio effects. [[Contemporary classical music]] sometimes uses computer-generated sounds, either pre-recorded or generated/manipulated live, in conjunction or [[wikt:juxtaposition]] with classical [[Acoustic music|acoustic instruments]] like the cello or violin. Classical and other notated types of music are frequently written on [[scorewriter]] software.

Many musicians and artists use 'patcher' type programmes, such as [[Pure Data|Pd]], [[Bidule]], [[Max/MSP]], [[Kyma (sound design language)]] and [[Audiomulch]] as well as (or instead of) [[digital audio workstation]]s or sequencers and there are still a significant number of people using more "traditional" software only approaches such as [[CSound]] or the [[Composers Desktop Project]]. Music technology includes many forms of music reproduction. Music and sound technology refer to the use of sound engineering in a commercial, experimental or amateur hobbyist manner. Music technology and sound technology may sometimes be classed as the same thing, but they actually refer to different fields of work. Sound engineering refers primarily to the use of sound technology for [[sound recording]] or in [[sound reinforcement system]]s used in concerts and live shows.

It may be impossible to bring the ship to shore for repairs, therefore one may stand on planks that are not rotten in order to repair or replace the ones that are. At a later time, the planks previously used for support may be tested by standing on other planks that are not rotten:

{{quote|"We can conduct certain tests assuming that certain [[memeplex]]es (e.g., science, logic, rationality) are foundational, but at a later time we might want to bring these latter memeplexes into question too. The more comprehensively we have tested our interlocking memeplexes, the more confident we can be that we have not let a meme virus enter into our mindware..." (p. 181)}}

In this way, one might proceed to examine and revise their beliefs so as to become more rational.

'''Neurotoxicity''' is a form of [[toxicity]] in which a biological, chemical, or physical agent produces an adverse effect on the structure or function of the [[central nervous system|central]] and/or [[peripheral nervous system|peripheral]] [[nervous system]].&lt;ref name="Neurotoxicity review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cunha-Oliveira T, Rego AC, Oliveira CR | title = Cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the neurotoxicity of opioid and psychostimulant drugs | journal = Brain Research Reviews | volume = 58 | issue = 1 | pages = 192–208 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18440072 | doi = 10.1016/j.brainresrev.2008.03.002 | quote = The Interagency Committee on Neurotoxicology defined neurotoxicity as a broad concept, including any adverse effect on the structure or function of the central and/or peripheral nervous system by a biological, chemical or physical agent. In this definition, neurotoxic effects may be permanent or reversible and result from direct or indirect actions on the nervous system (Erinoff, 1995).}}&lt;/ref&gt; It occurs when exposure to substance – specifically, a [[neurotoxin]] – alters the normal activity of the nervous system in such a way as to cause permanent or reversible damage to [[nervous tissue]].&lt;ref name="Neurotoxicity review" /&gt; This can eventually disrupt or even kill [[neuron]]s, which are cells that [[neurotransmission|transmit and process signals]] in the brain and other parts of the nervous system. Neurotoxicity can result from [[organ transplant]]s, [[radiation treatment]], certain [[drug therapy|drug therapies]] (e.g., substances used in [[chemotherapy]]), [[recreational drug use]], and exposure to [[heavy metals]], [[pesticide]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Neurotoxicity of pesticides. Keifer MC(1), Firestone J. Author information: (1)University of Washington, Department of Medicine, Seattle, WA 98195-7234, USA., 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jan 1, 2008 - Neurotoxicity of pesticides: a brief review. Costa LG(1), Giordano G, Guizzetti M, Vitalone A. Author information: (1)Dept. of Environmental and ...&lt;/ref&gt; certain industrial cleaning [[solvent]]s, and certain naturally occurring substances.  Symptoms may appear immediately after exposure or be delayed. They may include limb weakness or numbness, loss of memory, vision, and/or intellect, uncontrollable obsessive and/or compulsive behaviors, delusions, headache, cognitive and behavioral problems and sexual dysfunction.

The term ''neurotoxicity'' implies the involvement of a neurotoxin; however, the term ''neurotoxic'' may be used more loosely to describe states that are known to cause physical [[brain damage]], but where no specific neurotoxin has been identified.

The presence of [[neurocognitive deficit]]s alone is not usually considered sufficient evidence of neurotoxicity, as many substances may impair [[neurocognitive]] performance without resulting in the death of neurons. This may be due to the direct action of the substance, with the impairment and neurocognitive deficits being temporary, and resolving when the substance is [[drug elimination|eliminated]] from the body. In some cases the level or exposure-time may be critical, with some substances only becoming neurotoxic in certain doses or time periods. Some of the most common naturally occurring brain toxins that lead to neurotoxicity as a result of excessive drug use are [[beta amyloid]] (Aβ), [[glutamate]], [[dopamine]], and [[oxygen radicals]]. When present in high concentrations, they can lead to neurotoxicity and death ([[apoptosis]]). Some of the symptoms that result from cell death include loss of motor control, cognitive deterioration and autonomic nervous system dysfunction. Additionally, neurotoxicity has been found to be a major cause of [[neurodegenerative diseases]] such as [[Alzheimer's disease]] (AD).

==Neurotoxic agents==

===Beta amyloid===
Aβ was found to cause neurotoxicity and cell death in the brain when present in high concentrations. Aβ results from a mutation that occurs when protein chains are cut at the wrong locations, resulting in chains of different lengths that are unusable. Thus they are left in the brain until they are broken down, but if enough accumulate, they form [[Senile plaques|plaques]] which are toxic to [[neurons]]. Aβ uses several routes in the [[central nervous system]] to cause cell death. An example is through the [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]] (nAchRs), which is a receptor commonly found along the surfaces of the cells that respond to nicotine stimulation, turning them on or off. Aβ was found manipulating the level of [[nicotine]] in the brain along with the [[MAP kinase]], another signaling receptor, to cause cell death. Another chemical in the brain that Aβ regulates is [[JNK]]; this chemical halts the [[extracellular signal-regulated kinases]] (ERK) pathway, which normally functions as memory control in the brain. As a result, this memory favoring pathway is stopped, and the brain loses essential memory function. The loss of memory is a symptom of [[neurodegenerative disease]], including AD. Another way Aβ causes cell death is through the phosphorylation of [[AKT]]; this occurs as the element phosphate is bound to several sites on the protein. This phosphorylation allows AKT to interact with [[Bcl-2-associated death promoter|BAD]], a protein known to cause cell death. Thus an increase in Aβ results in an increase of the AKT/BAD complex, in turn stopping the action of the anti-apoptotic protein [[Bcl-2]], which normally functions to stop cell death, causing accelerated neuron breakdown and the progression of AD.

===Glutamate===
[[Glutamate]] is a chemical found in the brain that poses a toxic threat to [[neuron]]s when found in high concentrations. This concentration equilibrium is extremely delicate and is usually found in millimolar amounts extracellularly. When disturbed, an accumulation of glutamate occurs as a result of a mutation in the [[glutamate transporters]], which act like pumps to drain glutamate from the brain. This causes glutamate concentration to be several times higher in the blood than in the brain; in turn, the body must act to maintain equilibrium between the two concentrations by pumping the glutamate out of the bloodstream and into the neurons of the brain. In the event of a mutation, the glutamate transporters are unable to pump the glutamate back into the cells; thus a higher concentration accumulates at the [[glutamate receptors]]. This opens the ion channels, allowing calcium to enter the cell causing excitotoxicity.  Glutamate results in cell death by turning on the [[N-methyl-D-aspartic acid]] receptors (NMDA); these receptors cause an increased release of calcium ions (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) into the cells. As a result, the increased concentration of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; directly increases the stress on [[mitochondria]], resulting in excessive [[oxidative phosphorylation]] and production of [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS) via the activation of [[nitric oxide synthase]], ultimately leading to cell death. Aβ was also found aiding this route to neurotoxicity by enhancing neuron vulnerability to glutamate.

===Oxygen radicals===
The formation of [[oxygen radicals]] in the brain is achieved through the [[nitric oxide synthase]] (NOS) pathway. This reaction occurs as a response to an increase in the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration inside a brain cell. This interaction between the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and NOS results in the formation of the cofactor [[tetrahydrobiopterin]] (BH4), which then moves from the plasma membrane into the cytoplasm. As a final step, NOS is dephosphorylated yielding [[nitric oxide]] (NO), which accumulates in the brain, increasing its [[oxidative stress]]. There are several ROS, including [[superoxide]], [[hydrogen peroxide]] and [[hydroxyl]], all of which lead to neurotoxicity. Naturally, the body utilizes a defensive mechanism to diminish the fatal effects of the reactive species by employing certain enzymes to break down the ROS into small, benign molecules of simple oxygen and water. However, this breakdown of the ROS is not completely efficient; some reactive residues are left in the brain to accumulate, contributing to neurotoxicity and cell death. The brain is more vulnerable to oxidative stress than other organs, due to its low oxidative capacity. Because [[neuron]]s are characterized as [[postmitotic]] cells, meaning that they live with accumulated damage over the years, accumulation of ROS is fatal. Thus, increased levels of ROS age neurons, which leads to accelerated neurodegenerative processes and ultimately the advancement of AD.

==Prognosis==
The prognosis depends upon the length and degree of exposure and the severity of neurological injury. In some instances, exposure to neurotoxins can be fatal. In others, patients may survive but not fully recover. In other situations, many individuals recover completely after treatment.

==Etymology and pronunciation==
The word ''neurotoxicity'' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|n|ʊər|oʊ-|t|ɒ|k|ˈ|s|ɪ|s|ᵻ|t|i}}) uses [[classical compound|combining forms]] of ''[[wikt:neuro-#Prefix|neuro-]]'' + ''[[wikt:tox-#Prefix|tox-]]'' + ''[[wikt:-icity#Suffix|-icity]]'', yielding "[[nervous tissue]] poisoning".

Species use restricted [[ecological niche]]s, and the niches of all species are '''segregated''', often with much overlap, by the use of different habitats, different geographic areas and seasons, and different food resources, to mention only a few of the many niche dimensions. The causes of niche restriction and segregation are important problems in evolutionary ecology.

==Background==
Two ecological paradigms deal with the problem. The first paradigm predominates in what may be called “classical” ecology. It assumes that niche space is largely saturated with individuals and species, leading to strong competition. Niches are restricted because “neighbouring” species, i.e., species with similar ecological characteristics such as similar habitats or food preferences, prevent expansion into other niches or even narrow niches down. This continual struggle for existence is an important assumption of [[natural selection]] introduced by [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] as an explanation for evolution.

The other paradigm assumes that niche space is to a large degree vacant, i.e., that there are many [[vacant niches]]. It is based on many empirical studies &lt;ref&gt;Rohde, K. 1980. Warum sind ökologische Nischen begrenzt?  Zwischenartlicher Antagonismus oder innerartlicher Zusammenhalt?  Naturwissenschaftliche Rundschau, 33, 98-102.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rohde, K. 2005a. Eine neue Ökologie. Aktuelle Probleme der evolutionären Ökologie. Naturwissenschaftliche Rundschau, 58, 420-426.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nonequilibrium Ecology(1992)"&gt;K. Rohde: Nonequilibrium Ecology, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2005b, 223 pp. auf http://www.cambridge.org/9780521674553&lt;/ref&gt; and theoretical investigations especially of Kauffman 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Kauffman, S.A. 1993. The origins of order. Self-organization and selection in evolution. Oxford University Press, New York Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; Causes of vacant niches may be evolutionary contingencies or brief or long-lasting environmental disturbances.

Both paradigms agree that species are never “universal” in the sense that they occupy all possible niches; they are always specialized, although the degree of specialization varies. For example, there is no universal parasite which infects all host species and microhabitats within or on them. However, the degree of host specificity varies strongly. Thus, ''Toxoplasma'' (Protista) infects numerous vertebrates including humans, ''Enterobius vermicularis'' infects only humans.

The following mechanisms for niche restriction and segregation have been proposed:

== Niche restriction ==

# Species must be specialized in order to survive. They may survive for a while in less optimal habitats under favourable conditions, but they will be extinguished when conditions become less favourable, for example due to changed weather conditions (this aspect was especially emphasized by Price 1983).&lt;ref&gt;Price, P. W. 1983. Communities of specialists: vacant niches in ecological and evolutionary time. In Strong, D., Simberloff, D. and Abele, L. Eds.. Ecological Communities: Conceptual Issues and the Evidence. Princeton University Press, Princeton, N.J.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Niches remain narrow or become narrower as the result of natural selection in order to enhance the chances of mating. This “mating theory of niche restriction” &lt;ref&gt;Rohde, K. 1977. A non-competitive mechanism responsible for restricting niches.  Zoologischer Anzeiger 199, 164-172.&lt;/ref&gt; is supported by the observation that niches of asexual stages are often wider than those of sexually mature stages; that niches become narrower at the time of mating; and that microhabitats of sessile species and of species with small population sizes often are narrower than those of non-sessile species and of species with large population sizes.

== Niche segregation ==

# The random selection of niches in largely empty niche space will often automatically lead to segregation (this mechanism is of particular importance in the second paradigm).
# Niches are segregated due to interspecific competition (this mechanism is of particular importance in the first paradigm).
# Niches of similar species are segregated (as the result of natural selection) in order to prevent interspecific hybridisation, because hybrids are less fit. (Many cases of niche segregation explained by interspecific competition are better explained by this mechanism, i.e., “[[Reinforcement (speciation)|reinforcement of reproductive barriers]]”) (e.g., Rohde 2005b).&lt;ref name="Nonequilibrium Ecology(1992)"/&gt;

==Relative significance of the mechanisms==

Both paradigms acknowledge a role for all mechanisms (except possibly for that of random selection of niches in the first paradigm), but emphasis on the various mechanisms varies. The first paradigm stresses the paramount importance of interspecific competition, whereas the second paradigm tries to explain many cases which are thought to be due to competition in the first paradigm, by reinforcement of reproductive barriers and/or random selection of niches. – Many authors believe in the overriding importance of interspecific competition. Intuitively, one would expect that [[interspecific competition]] is of particular importance in all those cases in which sympatric species (i.e., species occurring together in the same area) with large population densities use the same resources and largely exhaust them. However, Andrewartha and Birch (1954,1984)&lt;ref&gt;Andrewartha,H.G. and Birch, L.C. 1954. The distribution and abundance of animals. University of Chicago Press, Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrewartha, H.G. and Birch, L.C. 1984. The ecological web. University of Chicago Press. Chicago and London.&lt;/ref&gt; and others have pointed out that most natural populations usually don’t even approach exhaustion of resources, and too much emphasis on interspecific competition is therefore wrong. Concerning the possibility that competition has led to segregation in the evolutionary past, Wiens (1974, 1984)&lt;ref&gt;Wiens, J.A. 1974. Habitat heterogeneity and avian community structure in North American grasslands. American Midland Naturalist 91,195-213.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiens, J.A. 1984. Resource systems, populations, and communities. In: Price, P.W., Slobodchikoff, C.N. and Gaud, W.S. Eds. A new ecology. Novel approaches to interactive systems. John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, Chichester, Brisbane, Toronto, Singapore, pp. 397-436.&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that such assumptions cannot be proven, and Connell (1980)&lt;ref&gt;Connell, J.H. 1980. Diversity and the coevolution of competitors, or the ghost of competition past. Oikos 35, 131-138.&lt;/ref&gt; found that interspecific competition as a mechanism of niche segregation has been proven only for some pest insects. Barker (1983),&lt;ref&gt;Barker, J.S.F. 1983. Interspecific competition. In: Ashburner, M., Carson, H.L. and Thompson, jr., J.N. Ed. The genetics and biology of Drosophila. Academic Press, London, pp. 285-341.&lt;/ref&gt; in his review of competition in ''Drosophila'' and related genera, which are among the best known animal groups, concluded that the idea of niche segregation by interspecific competition is attractive, but that no study has yet been able to show a mechanism responsible for segregation. Without specific evidence, the possibility of random segregation can never be excluded, and assumption of such randomness can indeed serve as a null-model. – Many physiological and morphological differences between species can prevent hybridization. Evidence for niche segregation as the result of reinforcement of reproductive barriers is especially convincing in those cases in which such differences are not found in allopatric but only in sympatric locations. For example, Kawano (2002)&lt;ref&gt;Kawano, K. 2002. Character displacement in giant rhinoceros beetles. American Naturalist 159, 255-271.&lt;/ref&gt; has shown this for giant rhinoceros beetles in Southeast Asia. Two closely related species occur in 12 allopatric (i.e., in different areas) and 7 sympatric (i.e., in the same area) locations. In the former, body length and length of genitalia are practically identical, in the latter, they are significantly different, and much more so for the genitalia than the body, convincing evidence that reinforcement is an important factor (and possibly the only one) responsible for niche segregation. - The very detailed studies of communities of Monogenea parasitic on the gills of marine and freshwater fishes by several authors have shown the same. Species use strictly defined microhabitats and have very complex copulatory organs.  This and the fact that fish replicas are available in almost unlimited numbers, makes them ideal ecological models.  Many congeners (species belonging to the same genus) and non-congeners were found on single host species. The maximum number of congeners was nine species. The only limiting factor is space for attachment, since food (blood, mucus, fast regenerating epithelial cells) is in unlimited supply as long as the fish is alive. Various authors, using a variety of statistical methods, have consistently found that species with different copulatory organs may co-occur in the same microhabitat, whereas congeners with identical or very similar copulatory organs are spatially segregated, convincing evidence that reinforcement and not competition is responsible for niche segregation.&lt;ref&gt;Rohde, K. 1991. Intra- and interspecific interactions in low density populations in resource-rich habitats.  Oikos 60, 91-104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rohde, K. 1994.

Journal of Animal Ecology. 19.1 (1949). 1-35&lt;/ref&gt; It is associated with the [[functional response]], which is the change in predator's rate of prey consumption with change in prey density. As Holling notes, total predation can be expressed as a combination of functional and numerical response.&lt;ref&gt;Holling, C. S. "The components of predation as revealed by a study of small-mammal predation of the European pine sawfly." Canadian Entomologist 91: 293-320. (1959)&lt;/ref&gt; The numerical response has two mechanisms: the '''demographic response''' and the '''aggregational response'''. The numerical response is not necessarily proportional to the change in prey density, usually resulting in a time lag between prey and predator populations.&lt;ref&gt;Ricklefs, R. E. The Economy of Nature. 6th Edition. New York: Freeman and Company. 2010. p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, there is often a scarcity of predators when the prey population is increasing.

== Demographic response ==

The demographic response consists of changes in the rates of predator reproduction or survival due to a changes in prey density. The increase in prey availability translates into higher energy intake and reduced energy output. This is different from an increase in energy intake due to increased foraging efficiency, which is considered a functional response. This concept can be articulated in the [[Lotka-Volterra]] Predator-Prey Model.

&lt;math&gt;dP/dt = acVP-mP&lt;/math&gt;

a = conversion efficiency: the fraction of prey energy assimilated by the predator and turned into new predators&lt;br /&gt;
P = predator density&lt;br /&gt;
V = prey density&lt;br /&gt;
m = predator mortality

Demographic response consists of a change in dP/dt due to a change in V and/or m. For example, if V increases, then predator growth rate (dP/dt) will increase. Likewise if the energy intake increases (due to greater food availability) and a decrease in energy output (from foraging), then predator mortality (m) will decrease and predator growth rate (dP/dt) will increase. In contrast, the functional response consists of a change in conversion efficiency (a) or capture rate (c).

The relationship between available energy and reproductive efforts can be explained with the [[Biological life cycle|life history]] theory in the trade-off between fecundity and growth/survival. If an organism has more net energy, then the organism will sacrifice less energy dedicated to survival per reproductive effort and will therefore increase its reproduction rate.

In [[parasitism]], functional response is measured by the rate of infection or laying of eggs in host, rather than the rate of prey consumption as it is measured in predation.  Numerical response in parasitism is still measured by the change in number of adult parasites relative to change in host density.  Parasites can demonstrate a more pronounced numerical response to changes in host density since there is often a more direct connection (less time lag) between food and reproduction in that both needs are immediately satisfied by its interaction with the host.&lt;ref&gt;Holling, C. S. "The components of predation as revealed by a study of small-mammal predation of the European pine sawfly." Canadian Entomologist 91: 293-320.(1959)&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Aggregational response ==

The aggregational response, as defined by Readshaw in 1973, is a change in predator population due to immigration into an area with increased prey population.&lt;ref&gt;Readshaw, J.L. The numerical response of predators to prey density. In: Hughes, Ed., Quantitative Evaluation of Natural Enemy Effectiveness. J. Applied Biol. 10:342-351. 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; In an experiment conducted by Turnbull in 1964, he observed the consistent migration of spiders from boxes without prey to boxes with prey. He proved that hunger impacts predator movement.&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull, A. L. The search for prey by a web-building spider Achaearanea tepidariorum (C. L. Koch) (Araneae, Theridiidae). Canadian Entomologist 96: 568-579. 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

Riechert and Jaeger studied how predator competition interferes with the direct correlation between prey density and predator immigration.&lt;ref&gt;Riechert, Susan E. Thoughts on Ecological Significance of Spiders. BioScience. 24(6): 352-356. 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jaeger, R.G. Competitive Exclusion: Comments on survival and extinction of species. BioScience. 24: 33-39. 1974&lt;/ref&gt; One way this can occur is through exploitation competition: the differential efficiency in use of available resources, for example, an increase in spiders' web size (functional response). The other possibility is interference competition where site owners actively prevent other foragers from coming in vicinity.

== Ecological relevance ==

The concept of numerical response becomes practically important when trying to create a strategy for [[pest control]]. The study of spiders as a biological mechanism for pest control has driven much of the research on aggregational response. Antisocial predator populations that display territoriality, such as spiders defending their web area, may not display the expected aggregational response to increased prey density.&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull, A. L. The search for prey by a web-building spider Achaearanea tepidariorum (C. L. Koch) (Araneae, Theridiidae). Canadian Entomologist 96: 568-579. 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

A credible, simple alternative to the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model and its common prey dependent generalizations is the ratio dependent or [[Arditi-Ginzburg equations|Arditi-Ginzburg model]].&lt;ref&gt;Arditi, R. and Ginzburg, L.R. 1989. [http://life.bio.sunysb.edu/ee/ginzburglab/Coupling%20in%20Predator-Prey%20Dynamics%20-%20Arditi%20and%20Ginzburg,%201989.pdf Coupling in predator-prey dynamics: ratio dependence].  ''Journal of Theoretical Biology'' 139: 311-326.&lt;/ref&gt;  The two are the extremes of the spectrum of predator interference models.  According to the authors of the alternative view, the data show that true interactions in nature are so far from the Lotka-Volterra extreme on the interference spectrum that the model can simply be discounted as wrong.  They are much closer to the ratio dependent extreme, so if a simple model is needed one can use the Arditi-Ginzburg model as the first approximation.&lt;ref&gt;Arditi, R. and Ginzburg, L.R. 2012.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2158">'''Optimal maintenance''' is the discipline within [[operations research]] concerned with maintaining a system in a manner that maximizes [[Profit (economics)|profit]] or minimizes [[cost]]. Cost functions depending on the [[reliability theory|reliability]], [[availability]] and [[maintainability]] characteristics of the system of interest determine the parameters to minimize. Parameters often considered are the cost of failure, the cost per time unit of "downtime" (for example: revenue losses), the cost (per time unit) of [[corrective maintenance]], the cost per time unit of [[preventive maintenance]] and the cost of [[repairable]] system replacement [Cassady and Pohl]. The foundation of any maintenance model relies on the correct description of the underlying deterioration process and failure behavior of the component, and on the relationships between maintained components in the product breakdown (system / sub-system / assembly / sub-assembly...).

Optimal Maintenance strategies are often constructed using stochastic models and focus on finding an optimal [[Planned maintenance|inspection time]] or the optimal acceptable degree of system degradation before maintenance and/or replacement. Cost considerations on an Asset scale may also lead to select a "run-to-failure" approach for specific components.

There are four main survey papers available accomplished to cover the spectrum of optimal maintenance:

* Optimal maintenance models for systems subject to failure–a review by YS Sherif, ML Smith published in Naval Research Logistics Quarterly, 1981.
* C. Valdez-Flores, R.M. Feldman, “A survey of preventive maintenance models for stochastically deteriorating single-unit systems”, Naval Research Logistics, vol 36, 1989 Aug, pp 419-446.
* J.J. McCall, “Maintenance policies for stochastically failing equipment:a survey”, Management Science, vol 11, 1965 Mar, pp 493-524.
* W.P. Pierskalla, J.A. Voelker, “A survey of maintenance models: The control and surveillance of deteriorating systems”, Naval Research Logistics Quarterly, vol 23, 1976 Sep, pp 353-388.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2104">'''PlanetQuest''' is [[NASA]]'s education and public outreach program centered on the science and technology of NASA’s long-term search for habitable planets beyond our solar system.

Major components of the PlanetQuest outreach program include:
* PlanetQuest: the Search for Another Earth, a continuously updated public news and multimedia Internet site;
* The Night Sky Network, a national coalition of amateur astronomy clubs who do astronomy education and public outreach on behalf of NASA;
* The Center for Astronomy Education, which provides professional development resources for instructors who teach introductory astronomy course, including a series of national “Teaching Excellence” workshops; 
* Informal education initiatives, including “PlanetQuest Updates” provided to more than 60 museums nationwide, and interactive multimedia kiosks. 

Begun in January 2002 and based at NASA’s [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]], PlanetQuest is funded by the Exoplanet Exploration Program, a long-term suite of NASA missions designed to detect and characterize of Earth-like planets. The main components of Navigator include two ground-based and two space based missions:

On Earth:
* The [[Keck Interferometer]]. Initial interferometeric work began in 2005.
* The [[Large Binocular Telescope]] Interferometer.  Instrument that is part of the Large Binocular Telescope, which has been operational since 2005.
In space:
* [[SIM PlanetQuest]]. SIM Lite cancelled in 2010.
* The [[Terrestrial Planet Finder]] observatories. ''De facto'' cancelled.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5717">'''Political alienation''' refers to an individual [[citizenship|citizen]]'s relatively enduring sense of estrangement from or rejection of the prevailing [[political system]].
==Content and categories==
Political alienation is not to be confused with [[voter apathy]], which describes a person's indifference to voting and/or the voting process. Politically ''alienated'', people feel compelled to vote, but are restricted by their sense of insignificance to the system. They feel that they are underrepresented or not represented at all by those running for office; their best interest or concerns are not regarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Political Sociology: Oppression, Resistance, and the State|last=Glasberg|first=Davita Silfen|last2=Shannon|first2=Deric|date=November 16, 2010|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc; 1 edition|isbn=1412980402|location=|pages=|oclc=815880812}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Political alienation falls into two broad categories: ''political incapability'' and ''political discontentment''. In the first instance, [[social alienation|alienation]] is forced upon the individual by their environment, whereas in the second case it is voluntarily chosen by them.&lt;ref name="Olsen 1968"&gt;{{Cite journal| author =  Olsen, Marvin E. | title = Two Categories of Political Alienation | year = 1968 | url = http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/josf47&amp;div=45&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals | journal = Social Forces |volume=47 |pages=288 | accessdate = 2011-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are at least five expressions of political alienation:&lt;ref name="Finifter 1970"&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Finifter, Ada W. | title = Dimensions of Political Alienation | date = June 1970 | jstor = 1953840 |journal=[[The American Political Science Review]] | volume=64 | issue = 2 | pages=389–410 | doi=10.2307/1953840}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#''Political [[Social alienation#Powerlessness|powerlessness]]''. An individual's feeling that they cannot affect the actions of the government.
#''Political [[Social alienation#Meaninglessness|meaninglessness]]''. An individual's perception that political decisions are unclear and unpredictable.
#''Political [[Social alienation#Normlessness|normlessness]]''. An individual's perception that norms or rules intended to govern political relations are broken down, and that departures from prescribed behavior are common.
#''Political [[Social alienation#Social isolation|isolation]]''. An individual's rejection of political norms and goals that are widely held and shared by other members of a society.
#Political ''disappointment.'' An individual's disinterest to a political decision or participation because of the ruling class bad behaviors, such as, leaders having scandals by doing shameful things.

Political alienation is adversely related to [[political efficacy]].&lt;ref name="Olsen 1968"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Finifter 1970"/&gt;

The most common [[election|electoral]] consequences of political alienation are [[abstention]] and [[protest vote|protest voting]].&lt;ref name="Olsen 1968"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Finifter 1970"/&gt;

In the current election system in the United States, many voters feel that their vote will not matter in their state if they do not agree with the majority of the population. Voters who usually vote Democrat in the general election, but live in a primarily Republican state, often feel less inclined to vote. The same goes for Republicans who live in a primarily Democratic state. In these situations, voters feel as if their vote no longer matters in the electoral college.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wood|first=Michael|date=Fall 2014|title=Political Alienation in American Society|url=https://scholarworks.uvm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1007&amp;context=hcoltheses|journal=Vermont Senior Thesis|volume=|pages=48|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* This idea prompted groups to propose new state boundary lines or new states in general. This idea is most notably tied to the Partition and secession in California

=== 2016 U.S. General Election ===
The 2016 U.S. General Election saw political alienation as one of the forefronts of the campaign. Both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton made appeals to the working class in Midwestern states by pointing out that they feel as if their votes don't matter and that they've been forgotten by past candidates. Both candidates did the same with Black and Latino voters in urban areas, voicing concerns with political alienation in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.electproject.org/2016g|title=2016g - United States Elections Project|website=www.electproject.org|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The voter turnout in the 2016 election is estimated to have been 55.5% of those eligible to vote. This election also saw an increase in voters in swing states and a decrease in voters living in "locked" states. This made political alienation a primary issue during the election because of the low voter turnout in many states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.electproject.org/2016g|title=2016g - United States Elections Project|website=www.electproject.org|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Psychological resilience''' is the ability to successfully cope with a crisis and to return to pre-crisis status quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Terte|first=Ian|last2=Stephens|first2=Christine|date=2014|title=Psychological Resilience of Workers in High-Risk Occupations|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/smi.2627|journal=Stress and Health|language=en|volume=30|issue=5|pages=353–355|doi=10.1002/smi.2627|issn=1532-3005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Resilience exists when the person uses "mental processes and behaviors in promoting personal assets and protecting self from the potential negative effects of stressors".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robertson|first=Ivan T.|last2=Cooper|first2=Cary L.|last3=Sarkar|first3=Mustafa|last4=Curran|first4=Thomas|date=2015-04-25|title=Resilience training in the workplace from 2003 to 2014: A systematic review|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/joop.12120|journal=Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology|language=en|volume=88|issue=3|pages=533–562|doi=10.1111/joop.12120|issn=0963-1798}}&lt;/ref&gt; In simpler terms, psychological resilience exists in people who develop psychological and behavioral capabilities that allow them to remain calm during crises/chaos and to move on from the incident without long-term negative consequences. Psychological resilience is an evolutionary advantage that most people have and use to manage normal stressors.

==Background==

Resilience is generally thought of as a "positive adaptation" after a stressful or adverse situation.&lt;ref name="Hopf S.M 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hopf S.M |title= Risk and Resilience in Children Coping with Parental Divorce|journal= Dartmouth Undergraduate Journal of Science |year=2010|url=http://dujs.dartmouth.edu/spring-2010/risk-and-resilience-in-children-coping-with-parental-divorce#.VTceVpNGRHA}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a person is "bombarded by daily stress, it disrupts their internal and external sense of balance, presenting challenges as well as opportunities". Resilience is the integrated adaptation of physical, mental and spiritual aspects in a set of "good or bad" circumstances, a coherent sense of self that is able to maintain normative developmental tasks that occur at various stages of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Richardson | first=Glenn E. | title=The metatheory of resilience and resiliency | journal=Journal of Clinical Psychology | publisher=Wiley-Blackwell | volume=58 | issue=3 | year=2002 | issn=0021-9762 | doi=10.1002/jclp.10020 | pages=307–321 | pmid=11836712}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Children's Institute of the [[University of Rochester]] explains that "resilience research is focused on studying those who engage in life with hope and humor despite devastating losses".&lt;ref name="childrens_institute"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.childrensinstitute.net/sites/default/files/documents/children-resilience-family-court-review.pdf | title=Fostering children's resilience in the aftermath of divorce: The role of evidence-based programs for children | work=Children's Institute, [[University of Rochester]] | date=2005 | accessdate=30 March 2016 | author=Pedro-Carroll, JoAnne | pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is important to note that resilience is not only about overcoming a deeply stressful situation, but also coming out of the said situation with "competent functioning". Resiliency allows a person to rebound from adversity as a strengthened and more resourceful person.

==History==

The first research on resilience was published in 1973. The study used [[epidemiology]], which is the study of disease prevalence, to uncover the risks and the protective factors that now help define resilience.&lt;ref&gt;Garmezy, N. (1973). "Competence and adaptation in adult schizophrenic patients and children at risk", pp. 163–204 in Dean, S. R. (Ed.), ''Schizophrenia: The first ten Dean Award Lectures''. NY: MSS Information Corp.&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, the same group of researchers created tools to look at systems that support development of resilience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Garmezy | first1 = N. | last2 = Streitman | first2 = S. | year = 1974 | title = Children at risk: The search for the antecedents of schizophrenia. Part 1. Conceptual models and research methods | journal = Schizophrenia Bulletin | volume = 1 | issue = 8| pages = 14–90 | pmid = 4619494 | doi = 10.1093/schbul/1.8.14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Emmy Werner]] was one of the early scientists to use the term ''resilience'' in the 1970s. She studied a cohort of children from [[Kauai]], Hawaii. Kauai was quite poor and many of the children in the study grew up with alcoholic or mentally ill parents. Many of the parents were also out of work.&lt;ref&gt;Werner, E. E. (1971). ''The children of Kauai : a longitudinal study from the prenatal period to age ten''. Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, {{ISBN|0870228609}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Werner noted that of the children who grew up in these detrimental situations, two-thirds exhibited destructive behaviors in their later teen years, such as chronic unemployment, substance abuse, and out-of-[[marriage|wedlock]] births (in case of teenage girls). However, one-third of these youngsters did not exhibit destructive behaviours. Werner called the latter group 'resilient'.&lt;ref name=w1989&gt;Werner, E. E. (1989). ''Vulnerable but invincible: a longitudinal study of resilient children and youth''. New York: McGraw-Hill, {{ISBN|0937431036}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, resilient children and their families were those who, by definition, demonstrated traits that allowed them to be more successful than non-resilient children and families.

Resilience also emerged as a major theoretical and research topic from the studies of children with mothers diagnosed with schizophrenia in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Masten, Best 1990"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Masten | first1 = A. S. | last2 = Best | first2 = K. M. | last3 = Garmezy | first3 = N. | year = 1990 | title = Resilience and development: Contributions from the study of children who overcome adversity | journal = Development and Psychopathology | volume = 2 | issue = 4| pages = 425–444 | doi = 10.1017/S0954579400005812 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1989 study,&lt;ref&gt;Masten, A. S. (1989). "Resilience in development: Implications of the study of successful adaptation for developmental psychopathology". In D. Cicchetti (Ed.), ''The emergence of a discipline: Rochester symposium on developmental psychopathology'' (Vol. 1, pp. 261–294). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum, {{ISBN|0805805532}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the results showed that children with a [[schizophrenic]] parent may not obtain an appropriate level of comforting caregiving—compared to children with healthy parents—and that such situations often had a detrimental impact on children's development. On the other hand, some children of ill parents thrived well and were competent in academic achievement, and therefore led researchers to make efforts to understand such responses to adversity.

Since the onset of the research on resilience, researchers have been devoted to discovering the protective factors that explain people's adaptation to adverse conditions, such as maltreatment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cicchetti | first1 = D. | last2 = Rogosch | first2 = F. A. | year = 1997 | title = The role of self-organization in the promotion of resilience in maltreated children | journal = Development and Psychopathology | volume = 9 | issue = 4| pages = 797–815 | pmid= 9449006 | doi = 10.1017/S0954579497001442 }}&lt;/ref&gt; catastrophic life events,&lt;ref name="Fredrickson, Tugade 2003"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fredrickson | first1 = B. L. | last2 = Tugade | first2 = M. M. | last3 = Waugh | first3 = C. E. | last4 = Larkin | first4 = GR| year = 2003 | title = A prospective study of resilience and emotions following the terrorist attacks on the United States on September 11th, 2002| journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 84 | issue = 2| pages = 365–376 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.84.2.365 | pmid = 12585810 | pmc = 2755263 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or urban poverty.&lt;ref name="Luthar 1999"&gt;Luthar, S. S. (1999). ''Poverty and children's adjustment.'' Newbury Park, CA: Sage, {{ISBN|0761905189}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of empirical work then has been shifted to understand the underlying protective processes. Researchers endeavor to uncover how some factors (e.g. connection to family) may contribute to positive outcomes.&lt;ref name="Luthar 1999"/&gt;

==Process==

In all these instances, resilience is best understood as a process. It is often mistakenly assumed to be a trait of the individual, an idea more typically referred to as "resiliency".&lt;ref&gt;Masten, A.S. (1994). "Resilience in individual development: Successful adaptation despite risk and adversity", pp. 3–25 in M. Wang &amp; E. Gordon (Eds.), ''Risk and resilience in inner city America: challenges and prospects''. Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum, {{ISBN|080581325X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Most research now shows that resilience is the result of individuals being able to interact with their environments and the processes that either promote well-being or protect them against the overwhelming influence of risk factors.&lt;ref name="Zautra, A.J. 2010 pp. 3-34"&gt;Zautra, A.J., Hall, J.S. &amp; Murray, K.E. (2010). "Resilience: A new definition of health for people and communities", pp. 3–34 in J.W. Reich, A.J. Zautra &amp; J.S. Hall (eds.), ''Handbook of adult resilience''. New York: Guilford, {{ISBN|146250647X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is essential to understand the process or this cycle of resiliency. When people are faced with an adverse condition, there are three ways in which they may approach the situation.

# Erupt with anger
# Implode with overwhelming negative emotions, go numb, and become unable to react
# Simply become upset about the disruptive change

Only the third approach promotes well-being. It is employed by resilient people, who become upset about the disruptive state and thus change their current pattern to cope with the issue. The first and second approaches lead people to adopt the victim role by [[projection (psychology)|blaming others]] and rejecting any coping methods even after the crisis is over. These people prefer to instinctively react, rather than respond to the situation. Those who respond to the adverse conditions by adapting themselves tend to cope, spring back, and halt the crisis. Negative emotions involve fear, anger, anxiety, distress, helplessness, and hopelessness which decrease a person's ability to solve the problems they face and weaken a person's resiliency. Constant fears and worries weaken people's immune system and increase their vulnerability to illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;Siebert, Al (2005). ''The Resiliency Advantage'', pp. 2–4. Berrett-Koehler Publishers. {{ISBN|1576753298}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

These processes include individual coping strategies, or may be helped by a protective environment like good [[family resilience|families]], schools, communities, and social policies that make resilience more likely to occur.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, B., Dodgen, D. &amp; Solarz, A. (2005). "The resilience revolution: A paradigm shift for research and policy", pp. 47–63 in R.D. Peters, B. Leadbeater &amp; R.J. McMahon (eds.), ''Resilience in children, families, and communities: Linking context to practice and policy''. New York: Kluwer. {{ISBN|0306486555}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense "resilience" occurs when there are cumulative "protective factors". These factors are likely to play a more important role, the greater the individual's exposure to cumulative risk factors.

==Biological models==
Three notable bases for resilience—self-confidence, self-esteem and [[self-concept]]—all have roots in three different nervous systems—respectively, the [[somatic nervous system]], the [[autonomic nervous system]] and the [[central nervous system]].&lt;ref&gt;Siebert, Al (2005). ''The Resiliency Advantage'', pp. 74–78. Berrett-Koehler Publishers. {{ISBN|1576753298}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An emerging field in the study of resilience is the neurobiological basis of resilience to stress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/339586/title/Brain_scan_foretells_who_will_fold_under_pressure Brain scan foretells who will fold under pressure; Tests on high-stakes math problems identify key regions of neural activity linked to choking], sciencenews.org (May 5, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, neuropeptide Y (NPY) and 5-Dehydroepiandrosterone (5-DHEA) are thought to limit the stress response by reducing sympathetic nervous system activation and protecting the brain from the potentially harmful effects of chronically elevated cortisol levels respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Charney|first1= DS |title=Psychobiological mechanisms of resilience and vulnerability: implications for successful adaptation to extreme stress |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=161 |issue=2 |pages=195–216 |year=2004 |pmid=14754765 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.161.2.195}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the relationship between social support and stress resilience is thought to be mediated by the oxytocin system's impact on the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmid=18627668| year=2008| last1=Ozbay| first1=F| last2=Fitterling| first2=H| last3=Charney| first3=D| last4=Southwick| first4=S| title=Social support and resilience to stress across ''the life'' span: A neurobiologic framework| volume=10| issue=4| pages=304–10| journal=Current Psychiatry Reports| doi=10.1007/s11920-008-0049-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Resilience, conceptualized as a positive bio-psychological adaptation, has proven to be a useful theoretical context for understanding variables for predicting long-term health and well-being".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Parental resilience: A neglected construct in resilience research|doi = 10.1111/cp.12053 | volume=19|issue=3|journal=Clinical Psychologist|pages=111–121|authors=Gavidia-Payne, S., Denny, B., Davis, K., Francis, A. and Jackson, M.|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some limited research that, like trauma, resilience is [[epigenetic]]—that is, it may be inherited—but the science behind this finding is preliminary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/05/28/trauma-may-be-woven-dna-native-americans-160508|work=Indian Country Today|title=Trauma May Be Woven in DNA of Native Americans|last=Pember|first=Mary Annette|date=May 28, 2015|accessdate=May 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related factors==

Studies show that there are several factors which develop and sustain a person's resilience:&lt;ref name="apa.org"&gt;American Psychological Association. (2014). [http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/road-resilience.aspx The Road to Resilience].&lt;/ref&gt;

# The ability to make realistic plans and being capable of taking the steps necessary to follow through with them
# Confidence in one's strengths and abilities
# Communication and problem-solving skills
# The ability to manage strong impulses and feelings

Resilience is negatively correlated with personality traits of neuroticism and negative emotionality, which represents tendencies to see and react to the world as threatening, problematic, and distressing, and to view oneself as vulnerable. Positive correlations stands with personality traits of openness and positive emotionality, that represents tendencies to engage and confront the world with confidence in success and a fair value to [[self-directedness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John W. Reich|author2=Alex J. Zautra|author3=John Stuart Hall|title=Handbook of Adult Resilience|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lyRc8ZshU98C&amp;pg=PA114|year=2012|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=978-1-4625-0647-7|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Positive emotions===

There is significant research found in scientific literature on the relationship between [[positive emotions]] and resilience. Studies show that maintaining positive emotions whilst facing adversity promote flexibility in thinking and problem solving. Positive emotions serve an important function in their ability to help an individual recover from stressful experiences and encounters. That being said, maintaining a positive emotionality aids in counteracting the physiological effects of negative emotions. It also facilitates adaptive coping, builds enduring social resources, and increases personal well-being.&lt;ref name="Fredrickson, B. L. 2003"&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 21852891 | pmc = 3156609 | year = 2005 | author1 = Fredrickson | first1 = B. L. | title = Positive emotions broaden the scope of attention and thought-action repertoires | journal = Cognition &amp; Emotion | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 313–332 | last2 = Branigan | first2 = C | doi = 10.1080/02699930441000238 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formation of conscious perception and monitoring one's own socioemotional factors is considered as a stability aspect of positive emotions.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} This is not to say that positive emotions are merely a by-product of resilience, but rather that feeling positive emotions during stressful experiences may have adaptive benefits in the coping process of the individual.&lt;ref name=tugade&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 14769087 | pmc = 3132556 | year = 2004 | author1 = Tugade | first1 = M.

L. | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.86.2.320 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Empirical evidence for this prediction arises from research on resilient individuals who have a propensity for coping strategies that concretely elicit positive emotions, such as benefit-finding and cognitive reappraisal, humor, optimism, and goal-directed problem-focused coping. Individuals who tend to approach problems with these methods of coping may strengthen their resistance to stress by allocating more access to these positive emotional resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.91.4.730| pmid = 17014296| title = Psychological resilience, positive emotions, and successful adaptation to stress in later life| journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology| volume = 91| issue = 4| pages = 730–49| year = 2006| last1 = Ong | first1 = A.

Positive emotions not only have physical outcomes but also physiological ones. Some physiological outcomes caused by humor include improvements in immune system functioning and increases in levels of salivary [[immunoglobulin A]], a vital system antibody, which serves as the body's first line of defense in respiratory illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/00223980209604148| pmid = 12081092| title = Perceived Attributes of Health-Promoting Laughter: A Cross-Generational Comparison| journal = The Journal of Psychology| volume = 136| issue = 2| pages = 171–81| year = 2002| last1 = Mahony | first1 = D.

H. | last2 = Minchoff | first2 = B. | last3 = Dillon | first3 = K. M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, other health outcomes include faster injury recovery rate and lower readmission rates to hospitals for the elderly, and reductions in a patient's stay in the hospital, among many other benefits. A study was done on positive emotions in trait-resilient individuals and the cardiovascular recovery rate following negative emotions felt by those individuals. The results of the study showed that trait-resilient individuals experiencing positive emotions had an acceleration in the speed in rebounding from cardiovascular activation initially generated by negative emotional arousal, i.e. heart rate and the like.&lt;ref name=tugade/&gt;

===Grit===
{{Main|Grit (personality trait)}}
Grit refers to the perseverance and passion for long-term goals.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Duckworth|first1= A.L. |last2=Peterson|first2= C. |last3=Matthews|first3= M.D. |last4=Kelly|first4= D.R. |title= Grit: perseverance and passion for long-term goals. |journal=J Pers Soc Psychol|volume=92 |issue=6 |pages=11087–1101 |year=2007 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.92.6.1087}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is characterized as working persistently towards challenges, maintained effort and interest over years despite negative feedback, adversity, plateaus in progress, or failure.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; High grit people view accomplishments as a marathon rather than an immediate goal. High grit individuals display a sustained and focused application of self in problematic situations than less gritty individuals.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Grit affects the effort a person contributes by acting on the importance pathway. When people value a goal as more valuable, meaningful, or relevant to their self-concept they are willing to expend more effort on it when necessary. The influence of individual differences in grit results in different levels of effort-related cardiac activity when gritty and less gritty individuals performed the same task. Grit is associated with differences in potential motivation, one pathway in motivational intensity theory. Grit may also influence an individual's perception of task difficulty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Silvia|first1= P.J. |last2=Eddington|first2= K.M. |last3=Beaty|first3= R.E. |last4=Nusbaum|first4= E.C. |last5=Kwapil|first5= T.R. |title= Gritty people try harder: grit and effort-related cardiac autonomic activity during an active coping challenge |journal=J Int J Psychophysiol|volume=88 |issue=2 |pages=200–205 |year=2013 |doi=10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2013.04.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grit was highly correlated with the [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five]] [[conscientiousness]] trait.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Although grit and conscientiousness highly overlap in their achievement aspects, they differ in their emphasis. Grit emphasizes long-term stamina, whereas conscientiousness focuses on short-term intensity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Grit varies with level of education and age. More educated adults tend to be higher in grit than less educated individuals of the same age.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Post college graduates report higher grit levels than most other education level groups.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Grit increases with age when education level is controlled for.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In life achievements, grit may be as important as talent. College students at an elite university who scored high in grit also earned higher GPAs than their classmates, despite having lower SAT scores.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In a study at the West Point military academy it was found that grit was a more reliable predictor of first summer retention than self-control or a summary measure of cadet quality.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Gritty competitors at the Scripps National Spelling Bee outranked other competitors who scored lower in grit, at least partially due to accumulated practice.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Grit may also serve as a protective factor against [[suicide]]. A study at [[Stanford University]] found that grit was predictive of psychological health and well-being in medical residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Salles|first1= A. |last2=Cohen|first2= G.L. |last3=Mueller|first3= C.M. |title= The relationship between grit and resident well-being|journal=Am J Surg|volume=207 |issue=2 |pages=251–254|year=2014 |doi=10.1016/j.amjsurg.2013.09.006|pmid= 24238604 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gritty individuals possess self-control and regular commitment to goals that allows them to resist impulses, such as to engage in [[self-harm]]. Individuals high in grit also focus on future goals, which may stop them from attempting suicide. It is believed that because grit encourages individuals to create and sustain life goals, these goals provide meaning and purpose in life. Grit alone does not seem to be sufficient, however. Only individuals with high gratitude and grit have decreased suicidal ideation over long periods of time. Gratitude and grit work together to enhance meaning in life, offering protection against death and suicidal thoughts or plans.&lt;ref name=Kleinman&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kleinman|first1= E.M. |last2=Adams|first2= L.M. |last3=Kashdan|first3= T.B. |last4=Riskind|first4= J.H. |title= Gratitude and grit indirectly reduce risk of suicidal ideations by enhancing meaning in life: Evidence for a mediated moderation mode |journal=Journal of Research in Personality|volume=47 |issue=5 |pages=539–546|year=2013 |doi=10.1016/j.jrp.2013.04.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other factors===

A study was conducted among high achieving professionals who seek challenging situations that require resilience. Research has examined 13 high achievers from various professions, all of whom had experienced challenges in the workplace and negative life events over the course of their careers but who had also been recognized for their great achievements in their respective fields. Participants were interviewed about everyday life in the workplace as well as their experiences with resilience and thriving. The study found six main predictors of resilience: positive and proactive personality, experience and learning, sense of control, flexibility and adaptability, balance and perspective, and perceived social support. High achievers were also found to engage in many activities unrelated to their work such as engaging in hobbies, exercising, and organizing meetups with friends and loved ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1037/spy0000003| title = Ordinary magic, extraordinary performance: Psychological resilience and thriving in high achievers| journal = Sport, Exercise, and Performance Psychology| volume = 3| pages = 46–60| year = 2014| last1 = Sarkar | first1 = M. | last2 = Fletcher | first2 = D. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several factors are found to modify the negative effects of adverse life situations. Many studies show that the primary factor for the development of resilience is social support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Theron|first=Linda|last2=van Rensburg|first2=Angelique|date=August 2018|title=Resilience over time: Learning from school-attending adolescents living in conditions of structural inequality|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140197118301052|journal=Journal of Adolescence|volume=67|pages=167–178|doi=10.1016/j.adolescence.2018.06.012|issn=0140-1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Abraham 359–366"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abraham|first=Ruth|last2=Lien|first2=Lars|last3=Hanssen|first3=Ingrid|date=2018-03-27|title=Coping, resilience and posttraumatic growth among Eritrean female refugees living in Norwegian asylum reception centres: A qualitative study|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2F10.1177%2F0020764018765237|journal=International Journal of Social Psychiatry|language=en|volume=64|issue=4|pages=359–366|doi=10.1177/0020764018765237|issn=0020-7640}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gagnon|first=Anita J.|last2=Stewart|first2=Donna E.|date=2013-11-13|title=Resilience in international migrant women following violence associated with pregnancy|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00737-013-0392-5|journal=Archives of Women's Mental Health|language=en|volume=17|issue=4|pages=303–310|doi=10.1007/s00737-013-0392-5|issn=1434-1816}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many competing definitions of social support exist, most can be thought of as the degree of access to, and use of, strong ties to other individuals who are similar to one’s self.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lin|first=Nan|last2=Woelfel|first2=Mary W.|last3=Light|first3=Stephen C.|date=September 1985|title=The Buffering Effect of Social Support Subsequent to an Important Life Event|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2136756|journal=Journal of Health and Social Behavior|volume=26|issue=3|pages=247|doi=10.2307/2136756|issn=0022-1465}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social support requires not only that you have relationships with others, but that these relationships involve the presence of solidarity and [[Trust (emotion)|trust]], intimate communication, and mutual obligation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perlin|first=L.|date=1981|title="The stress process."|url=|journal=Journal of Health and Social Behavior|volume=22|pages=337–56|via=EbscoHost}}&lt;/ref&gt; both within and outside the [[family]].&lt;ref name="Abraham 359–366"/&gt; Additional factors are also associated with resilience, like the capacity to make realistic plans, having [[self-confidence]] and a positive [[self image]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elm|first1=Jessica|title="I'm in this world for a reason": Resilience and recovery among American Indian and Alaska Native two-spirit women|journal=Journal of Lesbian Studies|date=June 2016|volume=20|issue=3–4|pages=352–371|doi=10.1080/10894160.2016.1152813|pmid=27254761}}&lt;/ref&gt; developing [[communication skills training|communications skills]], and the capacity to manage strong feelings and [[impulse (psychology)|impulses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studentsuccess.unc.edu/files/2015/08/The-Road-to-Resiliency.pdf |title=APA – Resilience Factors &amp; Strategies |publisher=unc.edu |accessdate=2010-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Temperamental and constitutional disposition is considered as a major factor in resilience. It is one of the necessary precursors of resilience along with warmth in family cohesion and accessibility of prosocial support systems.&lt;ref&gt;Masten, A. S., &amp; Reed, M. G. (2002). [https://books.google.com/books?id=2Cr5rP8jOnsC&amp;pg=PA74 Resilience in development]. In C. R. Snyder, &amp; S. J. Lopez (Eds.), Handbook of positive psychology (pp. 74-88). London, England: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; There are three kinds of temperamental systems that play part in resilience, they are the appetitive system, defensive system and attentional system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=DERRYBERRY | first=DOUGLAS | last2=REED | first2=MARJORIE A. | last3=PILKENTON–TAYLOR | first3=CAROLYN | title=Temperament and coping: Advantages of an individual differences perspective | journal=Development and Psychopathology | publisher=Cambridge University Press (CUP) | volume=15 | issue=04 | date=14 November 2003 | issn=0954-5794 | doi=10.1017/s0954579403000439 | pmid=14984137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another protective factor is related to moderating the negative effects of environmental hazards or a stressful situation in order to direct vulnerable individuals to optimistic paths, such as external social support. More specifically a 1995 study distinguished three contexts for protective factors:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Werner | first1 = E. E. | year = 1995 | title = Resilience in development| journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 4 | issue = 3| pages = 81–85 | doi = 10.1111/1467-8721.ep10772327 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# personal attributes, including outgoing, bright, and positive [[self-concept]]s;
# the family, such as having close bonds with at least one family member or an emotionally stable parent; and
# the community, such as receiving support or counsel from peers.

Furthermore, a study of the elderly in Zurich, Switzerland, illuminated the role humor plays as a coping mechanism to maintain a state of happiness in the face of age-related adversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ruch | first1 = W. | last2 = Proyer | first2 = R. T. | last3 = Weber | first3 = M. | doi = 10.1007/s00391-009-0090-0 | title = Humor as a character strength among the elderly | journal = Zeitschrift für Gerontologie und Geriatrie | volume = 43 | issue = 1 | pages = 13–18 | year = 2009 | pmid = 20012063 | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the above distinction on resilience, research has also been devoted to discovering the individual differences in resilience. [[Self-esteem]], ego-control, and ego-resiliency are related to behavioral adaptation.&lt;ref name=Ci1993&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cicchetti | first1 = D. | last2 = Rogosch | first2 = F. A. | last3 = Lynch | first3 = M. | last4 = Holt | first4 = K. D. | year = 1993 | title = Resilience in maltreated children: Processes leading to adaptive outcome | journal = Development and Psychopathology | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = 629–647 | doi = 10.1017/S0954579400006209 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, maltreated children who feel good about themselves may process risk situations differently by attributing different reasons to the environments they experience and, thereby, avoid producing negative [[internalized]] [[self-perception]]s. Ego-control is "the threshold or operating characteristics of an individual with regard to the expression or containment"&lt;ref&gt;Block, J. H., &amp; Block, J. (1980). "The role of ego-control and ego-resiliency in the organisation of behaviour". In W. A. Collins (Ed.), ''Development of cognition, affect, and social relations: Minnesota Symposia on Child Psychology '' (Vol. 13, p. 43). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum, {{ISBN|089859023X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; of their impulses, feelings, and desires. Ego-resilience refers to "dynamic capacity, to modify his or her model level of ego-control, in either direction, as a function of the demand characteristics of the environmental context"&lt;ref&gt;Block, J. H., &amp; Block, J. (1980). "The role of ego-control and ego-resiliency in the organisation of behaviour". In W. A. Collins (Ed.), ''Development of cognition, affect, and social relations: Minnesota Symposia on Child Psychology '' (Vol. 13, p. 48). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum, {{ISBN|089859023X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maltreated children who experienced some risk factors (e.g., single parenting, limited maternal education, or family unemployment), showed lower ego-resilience and intelligence than nonmaltreated children. Furthermore, maltreated children are more likely than nonmaltreated children to demonstrate disruptive-aggressive, withdraw, and internalized behavior problems. Finally, ego-resiliency, and positive self-esteem were predictors of competent adaptation in the maltreated children.&lt;ref name=Ci1993/&gt;

Demographic information (e.g., gender) and resources (e.g., social support) are also used to predict resilience. Examining people's adaptation after disaster showed women were associated with less likelihood of resilience than men. Also, individuals who were less involved in affinity groups and organisations showed less resilience.&lt;ref name=Bonanno&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bonanno | first1 = G. A. | last2 = Galea | first2 = S. | last3 = Bucciareli | first3 = A. | last4 = Vlahov | first4 = D. | year = 2007 | title = What predicts psychological resilience after disaster?

Certain aspects of religions and spirituality may, hypothetically, promote or hinder certain psychological virtues that increase resilience. Research has not established connection between spirituality and resilience. According to the 4th edition of ''Psychology of Religion'' by Hood, et al., the "study of positive psychology is a relatively new development...there has not yet been much direct empirical research looking specifically at the association of religion and ordinary strengths and virtues".&lt;ref&gt;Hood, R., Hill, P., Spilka, B., (2009) ''The psychology of religion, 4th edition: An empirical approach''. Newyork: The Guilford press, {{ISBN|1606233920}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In a review of the literature on the relationship between religiosity/spirituality and PTSD, amongst the significant findings, about half of the studies showed a positive relationship and half showed a negative relationship between measures of religiosity/spirituality and resilience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Peres | first1 = J. | last2 = Moreira-Almeida | first2 = A. | last3 = Nasello | first3 = A. | last4 = Koenig | first4 = H. | year = 2007 | title = Spirituality and resilience in trauma victims | journal = Journal of Religion &amp; Health | volume = 46 | issue = 3| pages = 343–350 | doi = 10.1007/s10943-006-9103-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States Army has received criticism for promoting spirituality in its new [Comprehensive Soldier Fitness] program as a way to prevent PTSD, due to the lack of conclusive supporting data.

In military studies it has been found that resilience is also dependent on group support: unit cohesion and morale is the best predictor of combat resiliency within a unit or organization. Resilience is highly correlated to peer support and group cohesion. Units with high cohesion tend to experience a lower rate of psychological breakdowns than units with low cohesion and morale. High cohesion and morale enhance adaptive stress reactions.&lt;ref&gt;Department of the Army (2009). Field Manual No. 6-22.5. Combat and Operational Stress Control Manual for Leaders and Soldiers. Department of the Army Headquarters, Washington, DC, 18 March 2009. p 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Building==

In [[cognitive behavioral therapy]], building resilience is a matter of mindfully changing basic behaviors and thought patterns.&lt;ref name="Padesky"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Padesky|first=Christine A.|last2=Mooney|first2=Kathleen A.|date=2012-06-01|title=Strengths-Based Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy: A Four-Step Model to Build Resilience|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cpp.1795|journal=Clinical Psychology &amp; Psychotherapy|language=en|volume=19|issue=4|pages=283–290|doi=10.1002/cpp.1795|issn=1063-3995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first step is to change the nature of self-talk. Self-talk is the internal monologue people have that reinforce beliefs about the person's self-efficacy and self-value. To build resilience, the person needs to eliminate negative self-talk, such as "I can't do this" and "I can't handle this", and to replace it with positive self-talk, such as "I can do this" and "I can handle this". This small change in thought patterns helps to reduce psychological stress when a person is faced with a difficult challenge. The second step a person can take to build resilience is to be prepared for challenges, crises, and emergencies. In business, preparedness is created by creating emergency response plans, business continuity plans, and contingency plans. For personal preparedness, the individual can create a financial cushion to help with economic crises, he/she can develop social networks to help him/her through trying personal crises, and he/she can develop emergency response plans for his/her household.

Resilience is also enhanced by developing effective coping skills for stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chua|first=Li Wen|last2=Milfont|first2=Taciano L.|last3=Jose|first3=Paul E.|date=2014-11-27|title=Coping Skills Help Explain How Future-Oriented Adolescents Accrue Greater Well-Being Over Time|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10964-014-0230-8|journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence|language=en|volume=44|issue=11|pages=2028–2041|doi=10.1007/s10964-014-0230-8|issn=0047-2891}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coping skills help the individual to reduce stress levels, so they remain functional. Coping skills include using meditation, exercise, socialization, and self-care practices to maintain a healthy level of stress, but there are many other lists associated with psychological resilience.

The [[American Psychological Association]] suggests "10 Ways to Build Resilience",&lt;ref name="apa.org" /&gt; which are:

# to maintain good [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]]s with close family members, friends and others;
# to avoid seeing [[crisis|crises]] or [[Stress (biology)|stressful]] events as unbearable problems;
# to accept circumstances that cannot be changed;
# to develop realistic [[goal]]s and move towards them;
# to take decisive actions in adverse situations;
# to look for opportunities of self-discovery after a struggle with loss;
# to develop self-confidence;
# to keep a long-term perspective and consider the stressful event in a broader context;
# to maintain a hopeful outlook, expecting good things and [[Mental image|visualizing]] what is wished;
# to take care of one's [[mind]] and [[Human body|body]], [[physical exercise|exercising]] regularly, paying attention to one's own needs and feelings.

The Besht model of natural resilience building in an ideal family with positive access and support from family and friends, through parenting illustrates four key markers. They are:

# Realistic upbringing
# Effective risk communications
# Positivity and restructuring of demanding situations
# Building self efficacy and hardiness

In this model, [[self-efficacy]] is the belief in one's ability to organize and execute the courses of action required to achieve necessary and desired goals and [[Hardiness (psychological)|hardiness]] is a composite of interrelated attitudes of commitment, control, and challenge.

A number of self-help approaches to resilience-building have been developed, drawing mainly on the theory and practice of [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) and [[rational emotive behavior therapy]] (REBT).&lt;ref name="Robertson_2012"&gt;{{Cite book| author=Robertson, D | title=Build your Resilience| year=2012| publisher=Hodder| location=London| isbn=978-1444168716|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QwIstsEgkBMC}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a group cognitive-behavioral intervention, called the Penn Resiliency Program (PRP), has been shown to foster various aspects of resilience. A meta-analysis of 17 PRP studies showed that the intervention significantly reduces depressive symptoms over time.&lt;ref name="pmid19968381"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Brunwasser SM, Gillham JE, Kim ES.|title=A meta-analytic review of the Penn Resiliency Program's effect on depressive symptoms|journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology|year=2009|volume=77|issue=6|pages=1042–1054|doi=10.1037/a0017671|pmid=19968381|last2=Gillham|last3=Kim|pmc=4667774}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of 'resilience building' is debatably at odds with the concept of resilience as a process,&lt;ref name="Rutter, M. 2008 pp. 3"&gt;Rutter, M. (2008). "Developing concepts in developmental psychopathology", pp. 3–22 in J.J. Hudziak (ed.), ''Developmental psychopathology and wellness: Genetic and environmental influences''. Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Publishing, {{ISBN|1585622796}}.&lt;/ref&gt; since it is used to imply that it is a developable characteristic of oneself.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Masten | first1 = A.

[[Bibliotherapy]], positive tracking of events, and enhancing psychosocial protective factors with positive psychological resources are other methods for resilience building.&lt;ref&gt;Yates, T. M., Egeland, B., &amp; Sroufe, L. A. (2003). "Rethinking resilience: A developmental process perspective", pp. 234–256 in S. S. Luthar (Ed.), ''Resilience and vulnerability: Adaptation in the context of childhood adversities''. New York: Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0521001617}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, increasing an individual's resources to cope with or otherwise address the negative aspects of risk or adversity is promoted, or builds, resilience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Resilience: Building immunity in psychiatry | pmc=3777343 | pmid=24082242 | doi=10.4103/0019-5545.117134 | volume=55 | issue=3 | year=2013 | journal=Indian J Psychiatry | pages=224–34 | last1 = Shastri | first1 = PC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrasting research finds that strategies to regulate and control emotions, in order to enhance resilience, allows for better outcomes in the event of mental illness.&lt;ref name=Min&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.comppsych.2013.05.008| pmid = 23806709| title = Cognitive emotion regulation strategies contributing to resilience in patients with depression and/or anxiety disorders| journal = Comprehensive Psychiatry| volume = 54| issue = 8| pages = 1190–7| year = 2013| last1 = Min | first1 = J.

These strategies focused on planning, positively reappraising events, and reducing rumination helped in maintaining a healthy continuity.&lt;ref name=Min/&gt;{{clarify|date=March 2016}} Patients with improved resilience were found to yield better treatment outcomes than patients with non-resilience focused treatment plans,&lt;ref name=Min/&gt; providing potential information for supporting evidence based psychotherapeutic interventions that may better handle mental disorders by focusing on the aspect of psychological resilience.

Military organizations test personnel for the ability to function under stressful circumstances by deliberately subjecting them to stress during training. Those students who do not exhibit the necessary resilience can be screened out of the training. Those who remain can be given stress inoculation training. The process is repeated as personnel apply for increasingly demanding positions, such as [[special forces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Robson | first =Sean | author-link = | last2 =Manacapilli | first2 =Thomas | author2-link = | title =Enhancing Performance Under Stress: Stress Inoculation Training for Battlefield Airmen | place =Santa Monica, California | publisher =[[RAND Corporation]] | series = | volume = | orig-year = | year =2014 | month= | edition = | chapter = | chapter-url = | page = | pages =61 | language = | url =http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR700/RR750/RAND_RR750.pdf | doi = | id = | isbn =9780833078445 | mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Children==

Resilience in children refers to individuals who are doing better than expected, given a history that includes risk or adverse experience. Once again, it is not a trait or something that some children simply possess. There is no such thing as an 'invulnerable child' that can overcome any obstacle or adversity that he or she encounters in life—and in fact, the trait is quite common.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Resilience is the product of a number of developmental processes over time, that has allowed children experience small exposures to adversity or some sort of age appropriate challenges to develop mastery and continue to develop competently.&lt;ref&gt;Yates, T. M., Egeland, B., &amp; Sroufe, L. A. (2003). "Rethinking resilience: A developmental process perspective", pp. 234–256 in S. S. Luthar (Ed.), ''Resilience and vulnerability: Adaptation in the context of childhood adversities''. New York: Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0521001617}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This gives children a sense of personal pride and self-worth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Steven J. Wolin, M.D.|author2=Sybil Wolin, Ph.D.|title=The Resilient Self: How Survivors of Troubled Families Rise Above Adversity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7UF3-Wjg4SoC|year=2010|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-75687-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on 'protective factors', which are characteristics of children or situations that particularly help children in the context of risk has helped developmental scientists to understand what matters most for resilient children. Two of these that have emerged repeatedly in studies of resilient children are good cognitive functioning (like cognitive self-regulation and IQ) and positive relationships (especially with competent adults, like parents).&lt;ref&gt;Luthar, S. S. (2006). "Resilience in development: A synthesis of research across five decades", pp. 739–795 in D. Cicchetti and D. J. Cohen (Eds.), ''Developmental Psychopathology (2nd ed.): Vol. 3 Risk, Disorder, and Adaptation''. Hoboken, NJ: Wiley and Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; Children who have protective factors in their lives tend to do better in some risky contexts when compared to children without protective factors in the same contexts. However, this is not a justification to expose any child to risk. Children do better when not exposed to high levels of risk or adversity.

===Building in the classroom===

Resilient children within classroom environments have been described as working and playing well and holding high expectations, have often been characterized using constructs such as [[locus of control]], [[self-esteem]], [[self-efficacy]], and [[autonomy]].&lt;ref&gt;Garmezy, N. (1974, August) ''The study of children at risk: New perspectives for developmental psychopathology.''&lt;/ref&gt; All of these things work together to prevent the debilitating behaviors that are associated with [[learned helplessness]].

===Role of the community===
Communities play a huge role in fostering resilience. The clearest sign of a cohesive and supportive community is the presence of social organizations that provide healthy human development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Garmezy | first1 = N. | year = 1991 | title = Resiliency and vulnerability to adverse developmental outcomes associated with poverty | journal = American Behavioral Scientist | volume = 34 | issue = 4| pages = 416–430 | doi = 10.1177/0002764291034004003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Services are unlikely to be used unless there is good communication concerning them. Children who are repeatedly [[Relocation (personal)|relocated]] do not benefit from these resources, as their opportunities for resilience-building, meaningful community participation are removed with every relocation.&lt;ref name="Emotional Adjustment of Moving for Young Kids"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moveboxer.com/content/pages/the-emotional-adjustment-of-moving-for-young-kids|title=Emotional Adjustment of Moving for Young Kids|last=Howard|first=Alyssa|publisher=Moveboxer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of the family===

Fostering resilience in children requires family environments that are caring and stable, hold high expectations for children's behavior and encourage participation in the life of the family.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, Haertel, &amp; Walberg, M. C., G. D., &amp; H. J (Ed.). (1994). ''Educational Resilience in Inner Cities.'' Hillsdale, New Jersey: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; Most resilient children have a strong relationship with at least one adult, not always a parent, and this relationship helps to diminish risk associated with family discord. The definition of parental resilience, as the capacity of parents to deliver a competent and quality level of parenting to children, despite the presence of risk factors, has proven to be a very important role in children's resilience. Understanding the characteristics of quality parenting is critical to the idea of parental resilience.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Even if divorce produces stress, the availability of social support from family and community can reduce this stress and yield positive outcomes.&lt;ref name="Benard, B. 1991"&gt;Benard, B. (1991) [https://archive.org/details/fosteringresilie00benarich ''Fostering resiliency in kids: Protective factors in the family, school and community.''] Portland, OR: Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory.&lt;/ref&gt; Any family that emphasizes the value of assigned chores, caring for brothers or sisters, and the contribution of part-time work in supporting the family helps to foster resilience.&lt;ref name=w1989/&gt; Resilience research has traditionally focused on the well being of children, with limited academic attention paid to factors that may contribute to the resilience of parents.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Families in poverty===
Numerous studies have shown that some practices that poor parents utilize help promote resilience within families. These include frequent displays of warmth, affection, emotional support; reasonable expectations for children combined with straightforward, not overly harsh discipline; family routines and celebrations; and the maintenance of common values regarding money and leisure.&lt;ref&gt;Cauce, Ana Mari; Stewart, Angela; Rodriguez, Melanie D.; Cochran, Bryan; Ginzler, Joshua.

Luthar (ed.), ''Resilience and Vulnerability: Adaptation in the Context of Childhood Adversities''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0521001617}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to sociologist Christopher B. Doob, "Poor children growing up in resilient families have received significant support for doing well as they enter the social world—starting in daycare programs and then in schooling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Doob|first=Christopher B.|title=Social Inequality and Social Stratification in US Society|year=2013|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bullying===
{{Main|Bullying and emotional intelligence#Resilience}}

Beyond preventing [[bullying]], it is also important to consider how interventions based on emotional intelligence (EI) are important in the case that bullying does occur. Increasing EI may be an important step in trying to foster resilience among victims. When a person faces stress and adversity, especially of a repetitive nature, their ability to adapt is an important factor in whether they have a more positive or negative outcome.&lt;ref name=Brisa&gt;Monroy Cortés, B. G. &amp; Palacios Cruz, L. (2011) [http://www.redalyc.org/articulo.oa?id=58220785008 Resiliencia: ¿Es posible medirla e influir en ella?] ''Salud Mental'', ''34''(3) 237–246. México: Instituto Nacional de Psiquiátrica Ramón de la Fuente Muñiz. {{ISSN|0185-3325}} [Spanish]&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 study examined adolescents who illustrated resilience to bullying and found some interesting gendered differences, with higher behavioral resilience found among girls and higher emotional resilience found among boys. Despite these differences, they still implicated internal resources and negative emotionality in either encouraging or being negatively associated with resilience to bullying respectively and urged for the targeting of psychosocial skills as a form of intervention.&lt;ref name=Sapouna&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.chiabu.2013.05.009| title = Resilience to bullying victimization: The role of individual, family and peer characteristics| journal = Child Abuse &amp; Neglect| volume = 37| issue = 11| pages = 997–1006| year = 2013| last1 = Sapouna | first1 = M. | last2 = Wolke | first2 = D. }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emotional intelligence]] has been illustrated to promote resilience to stress&lt;ref name=Schneider&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2013.07.460| title = Emotional intelligence and resilience| journal = Personality and Individual Differences| volume = 55| issue = 8| pages = 909–914| year = 2013| last1 = Schneider | first1 = T.

(2013) found that emotional perception was significant in facilitating lower negative emotionality during stress and Emotional Understanding facilitated resilience and has a positive correlation with positive affect.&lt;ref name=Schneider /&gt;

==Studies in specific populations and causal situations==

===Affected populations===

====Among transgender youth====

Transgender youth experience a wide range of abuse and lack of understanding from the people in their environment and are better off with a high resilience to deal with their lives. A study was done looking at 55 transgender youths studying their sense of personal mastery, perceived social support, emotion-oriented coping and self-esteem. It was seen that around 50% of the variation in the resilience aspects accounted for the problematic issues of the teens. This means that transgender youths with lower resilience were more prone to mental health issues, including depression and trauma symptoms. Emotion-oriented coping was a strong aspect of resilience in determining how depressed the individuals were.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Aspects of Psychological Resilience among Transgender Youth|journal=LGBT Youth|date=8 April 2011|volume=8|issue=2|pages=103–115|doi=10.1080/19361653.2011.541347|last1=Grossman|first1=Arnold H.|last2=d'Augelli|first2=Anthony R.|last3=Frank|first3=John A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Among pregnant adolescents and depressive symptoms====

Pregnancies among adolescents are considered as a complication, as they favour education interruption, poor present and future health, higher rates of poverty, problems for present and future children, among other negative outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Pérez-López FR, Chedraui P, Kravitz AS, Salazar-Pousada D, Hidalgo L |title= Present problems and controversies concerning pregnant adolescents|journal= Open Access Journal of Contraception |year=2011|volume=2 |pages=85–94|url= http://www.unizar.es/gine/adol.pdf|doi=10.2147/OAJC.S13398}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigators from the Ecuadorian Catholic University ([[Universidad Católica de Santiago de Guayaquil]]) (Guayaquil) and the Spanish [[University of Zaragoza]] (Zaragoza), performed a comparative study at the Enrique C. Sotomayor Obstetric and Gynecology Hospital (Guayaquil) assessing resilience differences between pregnant [[adolescents]] and adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Salazar-Pousada | first1 = D. | last2 = Arroyo | first2 = D. | last3 = Hidalgo | first3 = L. | last4 = Pérez-López | first4 = F. R. | last5 = Chedraui | first5 = P. | title = Depressive Symptoms and Resilience among Pregnant Adolescents: A Case-Control Study | doi = 10.1155/2010/952493 | journal = Obstetrics and Gynecology International | volume = 2010 | pages = 1–7 | year = 2010 | pmid = 21461335 | pmc =3065659 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 56.6% of gravids presented total CESD-10 scores 10 or more indicating depressed mood. Despite this, total CESD-10 scores and depressed mood rate did not differ among studied groups. Adolescents did, however, display lower resilience reflected by lower total resilience scores and a higher rate of scores below the calculated median (P &lt; 0.05). Logistic regression analysis could not establish any risk factor for depressed mood among studied subjects; however, having an adolescent partner and a preterm delivery related to a higher risk for lower resilience.

===Causal situations===

====Divorce====

Oftentimes divorce is viewed as detrimental to one's emotional health, but studies have shown that cultivating resilience may be beneficial to all parties involved. The level of resilience a child will experience after their parents have split is dependent on both internal and external variables. Some of these variables include their psychological and physical state and the level of support they receive from their schools, friends, and family friends.&lt;ref name="Hopf S.M 2010"/&gt; The ability to deal with these situations also stems from the child's age, gender, and temperament. Children will experience divorce differently and thus their ability to cope with divorce will differ too. About 20–25% of children will "demonstrate severe emotional and behavioral problems" when going through a divorce.&lt;ref name="Hopf S.M 2010"/&gt; This percentage is notably higher than the 10% of children exhibiting similar problems in married families.&lt;ref name="Kelly J, Emery R 2003 352–362"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1741-3729.2003.00352.x| title = Children's Adjustment Following Divorce: Risk and Resilience Perspectives| journal = Family Relations| volume = 52| issue = 4| pages = 352–362| year = 2003| last1 = Kelly | first1 = J. B. | last2 = Emery | first2 = R. E. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite having divorces parents of approximately 75–80% of these children will "develop into well-adjusted adults with no lasting psychological or behavioral problems". This comes to show that most children have the tools necessary to allow them to exhibit the resilience needed to overcome their parents' divorce.

The effects of the divorce extend past the separation of both parents. The remaining conflict between parents, financial problems, and the re-partnering or remarriage of parents can cause lasting stress.&lt;ref name="Hopf S.M 2010"/&gt; Studies conducted by Booth and Amato (2001) have shown that there is no correlation between post-divorce conflict and the child's ability to adjust to their life circumstance.&lt;ref name="Kelly J, Emery R 2003 352–362"/&gt; On the other hand, Hetherington (1999) completed research on this same topic and did find adverse effects in children.&lt;ref name="Kelly J, Emery R 2003 352–362"/&gt; In regards to the financial standing of a family, divorce does have the potential to reduce the children's style of living. Child support is often given to help cover basic needs such as schooling. If the parents' finances are already scarce then their children may not be able to participate in extracurricular activities such as sports and music lessons, which can be detrimental to their social lives.

Repartnering or remarrying can bring in additional levels of conflict and anger into their home environment. One of the reasons that re-partnering causes additional stress is because of the lack of clarity in roles and relationships; the child may not know how to react and behave with this new "parent" figure in their life. In most cases, bringing in a new partner/spouse will be the most stressful when done shortly after the divorce. In the past, divorce had been viewed as a "single event", but now research shows that divorce encompasses multiple changes and challenges.&lt;ref name="Kelly J, Emery R 2003 352–362"/&gt; It is not only internal factors that allow for resiliency, but the external factors in the environment are critical for responding to the situation and adapting. Certain programs such as the 14-week Children's Support Group and the Children of Divorce Intervention Program may help a child cope with the changes that occur from a divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.childrensinstitute.net/sites/default/files/documents/children-resilience-family-court-review.pdf|author=Pedro-Carroll, JA |title= Fostering children's resilience in the aftermath of divorce: The told of evidence based programs for children|journal= Family Court Review|volume=43|year=2005|pages=52–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Natural disasters====
Resilience after a natural disaster can be gauged in a number of different ways. It can be gauged on an individual level, a community level, and on a physical level. The first level, the individual level, can be defined as each independent person in the community. The second level, the community level, can be defined as all those inhabiting the locality affected. Lastly, the physical level can be defined as the infrastructure of the locality affected.&lt;ref name="ecologyandsociety.org"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.5751/ES-05377-180216|title=Education, Vulnerability, and Resilience after a Natural Disaster|journal=Ecology and Society|volume=18|issue=2|year=2013|last1=Frankenberg|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Sikoki|first2=Bondan|last3=Sumantri|first3=Cecep|last4=Suriastini|first4=Wayan|last5=Thomas|first5=Duncan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UNESCAP funded research on how communities show resiliency in the wake of natural disasters.&lt;ref name="unescap.org"&gt;{{cite journal|title= Theme Study on Building Resilience to Natural Disasters and Major Economic Crises|journal= Welcome to UN ESCAP. |url= http://www.unescap.org/sites/default/files/ThemeStudy2013-full2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found that, physically, communities were more resilient if they banded together and made resiliency an effort of the whole community.&lt;ref name="unescap.org"/&gt; Social support is key in resilient behavior, and especially the ability to pool resources.&lt;ref name="unescap.org"/&gt; In pooling social, natural, and economic resources, they found that communities were more resilient and able to over come disasters much faster than communities with an individualistic mindset.&lt;ref name="unescap.org"/&gt;

The World Economic Forum met in 2014 to discuss resiliency after natural disasters. They conclude that countries that are more economically sound, and have more individuals with the ability to diversify their livelihoods, will show higher levels of resiliency.&lt;ref name="weforum.org"&gt;{{cite journal|title= Building Resilience to Natural Disasters|journal= The World Economic Forum. |url= http://www.weforum.org/sessions/summary/building-resilience-natural-disasters-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has not been studied in depth yet, but the ideas brought about through this forum appear to be fairly consistent with already existing research.&lt;ref name="weforum.org"/&gt;

====Death of a family member====

Little research has been done on the topic of family resilience in the wake of the death of a family member.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rynearson, Edward K. |title=Violent Death: Resilience and Intervention Beyond the Crisis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WoRCPUeylLYC&amp;pg=PP1|date=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1-135-92633-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, clinical attention to bereavement has focused on the individual mourning process rather than on those of the family unit as a whole. Resiliency is distinguished from recovery as the "ability to maintain a stable equilibrium"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Bonanno|first1=George A.|title=Loss, Trauma, and Human Resilience|journal=American Psychologist|volume=59|issue=1|pages=20–8|pmid=14736317|year=2004|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.59.1.20}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is conducive to balance, harmony, and recovery. Families must learn to manage familial distortions caused by the death of the family member, which can be done by reorganizing relationships and changing patterns of functioning to adapt to their new situation.&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Greeff|first1=Abraham P.|last2=Human|first2=Berquin|title=Resilience in families in which a parent has died|journal=The American Journal of Family Therapy|volume=32|pages=27–42|doi=10.1080/01926180490255765|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exhibiting resilience in the wake of trauma can successfully traverse the bereavement process without long-term negative consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2190/OM.61.1.b| title = Reactions to Loss Scale: Assessing Grief in College Students| journal = OMEGA – Journal of Death and Dying| volume = 61| pages = 25–51| year = 2010| last1 = Cooley | first1 = E.| last2 = Toray | first2 = T.| last3 = Roscoe | first3 = L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the healthiest behaviors displayed by resilient families in the wake of a death is honest and open communication. This facilitates an understanding of the crisis. Sharing the experience of the death can promote immediate and long-term adaptation to the recent loss of a loved one. Empathy is a crucial component in resilience because it allows mourners to understand other positions, tolerate conflict, and be ready to grapple with differences that may arise. Another crucial component to resilience is the maintenance of a routine that helps to bind the family together through regular contact and order. The continuation of education and a connection with peers and teachers at school is an important support for children struggling with the death of a family member.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Therapeutic Interventions to Strengthen Resilience in Vulnerable Children|journal=School Psychology International|volume=35|issue=3|pages=309–337|doi=10.1177/0143034314529912|year=2014|last1=Heath|first1=M. A.|last2=Donald|first2=D. R.|last3=Theron|first3=L. C.|last4=Lyon|first4=R. C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Brad Evans and Julian Reid criticize resilience discourse and its rising popularity in their book, ''Resilient Life''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Evans|first1=Brad|last2=Reid|first2=Julian|title=Resilient Life: The Art of Living Dangerously|date=2014|publisher=Polity Press|location=Malden, MA|isbn=978-0-7456-7152-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors assert that policies of resilience can put the onus of disaster response on individuals rather than publicly coordinated efforts. Tied to the emergence of [[neoliberalism]], [[climate change]] theory, third-world development, and other discourses, Evans and Reid argue that promoting resilience draws attention away from governmental responsibility and towards self-responsibility and healthy psychological affects such as "posttraumatic growth".

Another criticism regarding resilience is its definition. Like other psychological phenomena, by defining specific psychological and affective states in certain ways, controversy over meaning will always ensue. How the term resilience is defined affects research focuses; different or insufficient definitions of resilience will lead to inconsistent research about the same concepts. Research on resilience has become more heterogeneous in its outcomes and measures, convincing some researchers to abandon the term altogether due to it being attributed to all outcomes of research where results were more positive than expected.&lt;ref name=burt&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0954579412000119| pmid = 22559126| title = Resilience in the transition to adulthood| journal = Development and Psychopathology| volume = 24| issue = 2| pages = 493–505| year = 2012| last1 = Burt | first1 = K.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3113">[[File:Släpljus - Ystad-2015.jpg|thumb|Raking light across a wall, gives a [[relief]] like impression.]]
'''Raking light''', the illumination of objects from a [[Light_source#Light_sources|light source]] at an [[Angle#Types_of_angles|oblique angle]] or almost [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to the surface, provides information on the [[Topography|surface topography]] and relief of the artefact thus lit. It is widely used in the examination of works of art.

==Examination of paintings==
Using raking light, the effects of [[impasto]] and the surface texture of a [[painting]] are accentuated by the increased illumination of surfaces facing the light source and the exaggeration of [[shadows]] on surfaces facing away from the light source.&lt;ref name="NG"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/glossary/raking-light |title=Glossary - raking light |publisher=[[The National Gallery]] |accessdate=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some instances raking light may help reveal [[pentimenti]] (changes in an artist's intention).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/ophelia/conservation-ophelia/raking-light-and-relief |title=Raking light and relief |publisher=[[Tate]] |accessdate=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of [[murals|wall paintings]], raking light helps show preparatory techniques such as [[Fresco|incisions]] in the plaster support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/pdf_publications/pdf/wall_paintings.pdf |title=The Conservation of Wall Paintings |page=25 |publisher=[[Getty Conservation Institute]] |accessdate=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation==
[[Conservation-restoration|Conservators]] examine objects under raking light during [[visual inspection]] and for [[condition recording]].&lt;ref name="NG"/&gt; In the examination of [[Easel|easel paintings]], raking light may help document [[craquelure]], paint [[wikt:cupping|cupping]], uneven [[Tension (physics)|tension]] in a [[canvas]], or [[Wood warping|warp]] in a [[Panel painting|panel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-hki.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/services/photo_lighting.html |title=Lighting techniques - raking light |publisher=[[Hamilton Kerr Institute]] |date=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the examination of [[Murals|wall paintings]], raking light can help document surface deterioration phenomena such as the [[efflorescence]] of [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]] and micro-[[delamination]], and may be used for monitoring the effects of conservation interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/pdf_publications/pdf/wall_paintings.pdf |title=The Conservation of Wall Paintings |pages=49, 145f |publisher=[[Getty Conservation Institute]] |accessdate=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The paper is allowed to dry and then removed.  The image is reversed from the inscription, and  protrudes from the squeeze paper.

The use of a squeeze allows more information to be gleaned than examining the original inscription, for example curves inside the cuts can identify the scribe who originally carved the inscription.&lt;ref name="TIH"&gt;Taking Inscriptions Home  University of Reading, Ure Museum&lt;/ref&gt;

Squeezes can also (and some have been since the 1950s) be made by applying layers of [[liquid latex]].  This method works best on horizontal surfaces.&lt;ref name="TIH" /&gt;

Modern digitising methods mean that the image can be restored to the original orientation.

Large collections of squeezes are held by the ''[[Inscriptiones Graecae]]'' and other epigraphic collections.

'''The Reasons that Induced Dr. S. to Write a Poem Call'd the Lady's Dressing Room''' is a poem by [[Lady Mary Wortley Montagu]] published in 1734. The poem is a [[satire]] and was written in response to a poem by [[Jonathan Swift]] entitled "[[The Lady's Dressing Room]]". The poem is part of a poetic duel between the two poets, in which Montagu attacks Swift's character and suggests that he wrote "The Lady's Dressing Room" as a result of his sexual frustration and impotence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lorenzo Modia|first=Maria Jesus|title=Teaching Eighteenth-century Poetic Satire with a Competency-based  Approach: Jonathan Swift and Lady Mary Wortley Montagu|journal=International Education Studies|date=December 2011|volume=4|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both poems have been seen as satires of gender roles and stereotypes of the time, although Swift's poem has received greater praise and recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weise|first=Wendys|title=Seeing and the Difference It Makes: Ocularity, Gender, and Space in Swift's and Montagu's "Dressing Room" Satires|journal=Taylor &amp; Francis Group, Women's Studies|year=2006|volume=35|issue=8|pages=707–738|doi=10.1080/00497870600945600}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
The poem is a narrative where "the Doctor", referring to [[Jonathan Swift]], is the protagonist. The tale relates his journey one day to meet with a prostitute named Betty that he has been attempting to woo. After paying for her services, however, he finds himself experiencing an episode of impotence. He proceeds to blame his sexual failure on Betty and she returns his blame, allocating it to his old age. The Doctor insists that his money be returned to him but Betty refuses to do so. He swears vengeance, saying, "I'll so describe your dressing room / The very Irish shall not come". Here Montagu references Swift's poem, "[[The Lady's Dressing Room]]", and also slights Swift's Irish nationality. Betty the prostitute replies with another reference to Swift's poem saying, "I'm glad you'll write. / You'll furnish paper when I shite."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=al.]|first=general editors, Joseph Black ... [et|title=The restoration and the eighteenth century.|year=2006|publisher=Broadview Press|location=Peterborough, Ontario [u.a.]|isbn=1-55111-611-1|edition=Repr. with corrections.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
The poem's biting satire obviously overtly attacks Dr. Swift and his writings. It also actively accuses Swift of Misogyny and sexism. Swift's poem was highly invasive as it chronicles the unwanted entry of a man into a lady's dressing room where he sees the woman no longer as an elevated goddess, but as a normal human being with normal bodily functions. In his poem he attacks womankind, abasing them as vile and disgusting creatures. More importantly, the scene he depicts "unveils" the myth of femininity. The 18th century required women to be flawless, gentle and pure in public and private. Swift mocks them in both spheres, deeply desecrating the female image. He also brings their integrity into question, suggesting that they, through attempting to be clean, are hiding their inherent filthiness. Not everyone found Swift's satire tasteful, but his writing was very influential. 

Montagu's poem, however, suggests that the hatred of women that inspired Swift to write his poem is actually just a result of his own sexual frustration and incapacity. In denouncing Swift's misogynistic views, Montagu also criticizes his pessimism in other subject areas. Swift was known as a satirist to be extremely cynical and critical of nearly everything. This poem stands to reason that all of Swift's pessimism is a result of internal issues and failures. Montagu mocks the double standard required for women; Swift invalidates females in both the public and private sphere and Montagu refutes this with cleverly pointed satire.

For both poems, the form is very significant. Their use of satire made their work possible. They could raise eyebrows without starting fires and question contradictory systems and values while eliciting pleased smiles. This form popularized their works.

It provides a platform for creating [[inquiry-based science]] projects for middle school and high school students to work collaboratively using evidence and resources from the Web.  WISE inquiry projects are typically developed by teams including teachers, researchers, and scientists.  These projects range in duration from 2 days to 4 weeks, suitable for teachers in every science topic at all grade levels. The use of Internet materials provides the foundation of WISE.  All projects make use of some content from the World Wide Web, as well as additional Web pages authored for purposes of the project.  This approach helps students learn to use the Internet for inquiry, critiquing Web sites, designing approaches, or comparing arguments. Typical projects engage students in designing solutions to problems (e.g. building a desert house that is warm at night and cool during the day), debating contemporary science controversies (e.g. the causes of declining amphibian populations), investigating scientific phenomena (e.g. thermal equilibrium in the classroom), or critiquing scientific claims found in web sites (e.g. arguments for life on Mars).

WISE projects can also incorporate [[Java (programming language)|Java]] applets, flash models, forums to facilitate online discussions, data collection, drawing, argument creation, resource sharing, branching, concept mapping and other built-in components.  WISE is entirely browser-based, meaning that students only need access to a computer with an Internet connection, with no required software other than the Web browser).  All student work is saved on central project servers that enable student accounts and teacher accounts to be coordinated, with special Web environments designed to support teachers and students.  Students can access their work from any computer on the Internet. Teachers can choose from the library of curriculum projects in the WISE Teacher's Portal, each accompanied by a set of materials including a detailed lesson plan, pre and post assessments, connections to the AAAS National standards, tools for setting up a custom grading scheme, and even a software tool that enables customization of the WISE project for local issues, geographical features or student populations. Teachers can monitor and grade student work in real time, provide formative feedback during a project run, and manage their student accounts. 

Finally, WISE provides a user-friendly interface to facilitate the authoring of new projects, with numerous technology-based components including online discussions, data collection, drawing, argument creation, resource sharing, concept mapping and other built-in tools. Developers can also include custom tools of their own design. Projects are further customizable by teachers and other end users through the same interface to better meet the needs of their students and constraints of local educational settings. The website provides rich descriptions of the WISE learning environment, a library of inquiry projects for students and teachers, a teacher support center, and the complete authoring environment.

'''William S.W. Lim''', born in [[Hong Kong]] in 1932, is a [[Singapore]]an [[architect]]. He graduated from the [[Architectural Association School of Architecture]] in London and continued his graduate studies at [[Harvard University]]. Lim was a [[Fulbright Fellow]] in the Department of City and Regional Planning at Harvard University. Since 1957, he has worked in Singapore and Malaysia in several businesses as a partner. His work began from the design of modernist structures for residential and commercial interests, and progressed on to large-scale shopping centres in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur. His designs include the [[People's Park Complex]] (1973) in Singapore, which went on to become the model for commercial development in the city; the [[Golden Mile Complex]] (1974); and the Tanglin Shopping Center. In 1981,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rama9art.org/citiesonthemove/body315.html William Lim's CV from the Cities On The Move Exhibition 1999]&lt;/ref&gt; he started his own business. He was a founding member of the Singapore Heritage Society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reasonablespread.com/SpreaderFiles/2291/files/upload/WIlliamLimCV.doc CV OF WILLIAM S W LIM ]&lt;/ref&gt; Lim is also a co-founder and Chairman of Asian Urban Lab and President of the Architectural Association of Asia (AA Asia). He was conferred a Doctor of Architecture ''Honoris Causa'' by the [[Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology]] (RMIT) University, Australia, in 2002 and appointed Honorary Professor of LaSalle-SIA College of the Arts (Singapore) in 2005. Currently, Lim writes and lectures on a wide range of subjects relating to architecture, urbanism and culture in Asia as well as on current issues relating to the postmodern, ''glocality'' and social justice.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?q=+WILLIAM+S+W+LIM+&amp;btnG=Search+Books William S.W.

L’'''École de Physique des Houches''' (the Physics School of [[Les Houches]]) was founded in 1951 by a young French scientist, [[Cécile DeWitt-Morette]].

Historically the first lessons were given in 1951 by [[Léon van Hove]]  on quantum mechanics.  The conditions were very spartan with the lessons lasting eight weeks in alpine chalets devoid of all comforts, a few kilometers from the village of Les Houches.

Soon, the school rapidly attracted the greatest names of modern physics, such as [[Enrico Fermi]], [[Wolfgang Pauli]], [[Murray Gell-Mann]] and [[John Bardeen]] amongst others.  The young students, then unknown, included such future scientists as [[Pierre-Gilles de Gennes]], [[Georges Charpak]], and [[Claude Cohen-Tannoudji]], all future winners of the Nobel prize for Physics, as well as mathematician [[Alain Connes]], future winner of the Fields medal.
