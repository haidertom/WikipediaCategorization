'''Acclimatization''' [[American and British English spelling differences#iseize|or]] '''acclimatisation''' ([[#Names|also called]] '''acclimation''' or '''acclimatation''') is the process in which an individual [[organism]] adjusts to a [[environmental change|change in its environment]] (such as a change in altitude, temperature, humidity, [[photoperiod]], or [[pH]]), allowing it to maintain performance across a range of environmental conditions. Acclimatization occurs in a short period of time (hours to weeks), and within the organism's lifetime (compared to [[adaptation]], which is a development that takes place over many generations). This may be a discrete occurrence (for example, when [[mountaineering|mountaineers]] acclimate to [[altitude#High altitude and low pressure|high altitude]] over hours or days) or may instead represent part of a periodic cycle, such as a [[mammal]] shedding heavy winter [[fur]] in favor of a lighter summer coat. Organisms can adjust their morphological, behavioral, physical, and/or biochemical traits in response to changes in their environment.&lt;ref&gt;(2009) “Acclimatisation” (n.d.) The Unabridged Hutchinson Encyclopedia Retrieved November 5 2009 from http://encyclopedia.farlex.com/acclimatization&lt;/ref&gt; While the capacity to acclimate to novel environments has been well documented in thousands of species, researchers still know very little about how and why organisms acclimate the way that they do.

==Names==
The nouns ''[[wikt:acclimatization#Noun|acclimatization]]'' and ''[[wikt:acclimation#Noun|acclimation]]'' (and the corresponding verbs ''[[wikt:acclimatize#Verb|acclimatize]]'' and ''[[wikt:acclimate#Verb|acclimate]]'') are widely regarded as [[synonym]]ous,&lt;ref name="OxfordDictionaries"&gt;{{Citation |author=Oxford Dictionaries |authorlink=OxfordDictionaries.com |title=Oxford Dictionaries Online |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/ |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MW_Collegiate"&gt;{{Citation |author=Merriam-Webster |authorlink=Merriam-Webster |title=Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |url=http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/collegiate/ |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MWU"&gt;{{Citation |author=Merriam-Webster |authorlink=Merriam-Webster |title=Merriam-Webster's Unabridged Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |url=http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/unabridged/ |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AHD"&gt;{{Citation |author=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |url=https://ahdictionary.com/ |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dorlands"&gt;{{Citation |author=Elsevier |authorlink=Elsevier |title=Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary |publisher=Elsevier |url=http://dorlands.com/ |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stedmans"&gt;{{Citation |author=Wolters Kluwer |authorlink=Wolters Kluwer |title=Stedman's Medical Dictionary |publisher=Wolters Kluwer |url=http://stedmansonline.com/ |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; both in general vocabulary&lt;ref name="OxfordDictionaries"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MW_Collegiate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MWU"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AHD"/&gt; and in medical vocabulary.&lt;ref name="Dorlands"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stedmans"/&gt; It [[linguistic prescription|has sometimes been asserted]] that they should be differentiated by reserving ''acclimatization'' for a wild/natural process (e.g., shedding heavy winter fur with natural seasonal change) and reserving ''acclimation'' for changes occurring in response to an artificial or controlled situation, such as changes in temperature imposed in an [[experiment]]. This assertion is not widely known or followed (as the foregoing citations of 6 major dictionaries show), so writers who intend it must explicitly state that it applies within their [[usage]] (for example, "in the following discussion, X refers strictly to Y") if they expect their intended meaning to be received by their audience. The synonym ''[[wikt:acclimatation#Noun|acclimatation]]''&lt;ref name="MWU"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dorlands"/&gt; is less commonly encountered, and fewer dictionaries enter it.

==Methods==
===Biochemical===
In order to maintain performance across a range of environmental conditions, there are several strategies organisms use to acclimate. In response to changes in temperature, organisms can change the biochemistry of [[cell membrane]]s making them more fluid in cold temperatures and less fluid in warm temperatures by increasing the number of [[membrane protein]]s.&lt;ref name="Los"&gt;Los, D.A.; Murata, N. (2004). "Membrane fluidity and its roles in the perception of environmental signals." ''Biochimica et Biophysica Acta-biomembranes'' '''0666''', 142–157.&lt;/ref&gt; Organisms may also express specific [[protein]]s called [[heat shock protein]]s that may act as molecular chaperons and help the cell maintain function under periods of extreme stress. It has been shown, that organisms which are acclimated to high or low temperatures display relatively high resting levels of heat shock proteins so that when they are exposed to even more extreme temperatures the proteins are readily available. Expression of heat shock proteins and regulation of membrane fluidity are just two of many biochemical methods organisms use to acclimate to novel environments.

===Morphological===
Organisms are able to change several characteristics relating to their [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] in order to maintain performance in novel environments. For example, birds often increase their organ size to increase their metabolism. This can take the form of an increase in the mass of nutritional organs or heat-producing organs, like the pectorals (with the latter being more consistent across species&lt;ref name="LiknesSwanson2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liknes|first1=Eric T.|last2=Swanson|first2=David L.|title=Phenotypic flexibility of body composition associated with seasonal acclimatization in passerine birds|journal=Journal of Thermal Biology|volume=36|issue=6|year=2011|pages=363–370|issn=03064565|doi=10.1016/j.jtherbio.2011.06.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref name="McKechnie2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McKechnie|first1=Andrew E.|title=Phenotypic flexibility in basal metabolic rate and the changing view of avian physiological diversity: a review|journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology B|volume=178|issue=3|year=2008|pages=235–247|issn=0174-1578|doi=10.1007/s00360-007-0218-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
While the capacity for acclimation has been documented in thousands of species, researchers still know very little about how and why organisms acclimate in the way that they do. Since researchers first began to study acclimation, the overwhelming hypothesis has been that all acclimation serves to enhance the performance of the organism. This idea has come to be known as the [[beneficial acclimation hypothesis]]. Despite such widespread support for the beneficial acclimation hypothesis, not all studies show that acclimation always serves to enhance performance (''See [[beneficial acclimation hypothesis]]''). One of the major objections to the beneficial acclimation hypothesis is that it assumes that there are no costs associated with acclimation.&lt;ref name = "Angilletta"&gt;Angilletta, M.J. (2009). Thermal Adaptation: A Theoretical and Empirical Synthesis. Oxford University Press, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are likely to be costs associated with acclimation. These include the cost of sensing the environmental conditions and regulating responses, producing structures required for plasticity (such as the energetic costs in expressing [[Heat shock protein|heat shock proteins]]), and genetic costs (such as linkage of plasticity-related genes with harmful genes).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=DeWitt|first=Thomas J.|last2=Sih|first2=Andrew|last3=Wilson|first3=David Sloan|date=1998-02-01|title=Costs and limits of phenotypic plasticity|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534797012743|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=13|issue=2|pages=77–81|doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(97)01274-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the shortcomings of the beneficial acclimation hypothesis, researchers are continuing to search for a theory that will be supported by empirical data.

The degree to which organisms are able to acclimate is dictated by their [[phenotypic plasticity]] or the ability of an organism to change certain traits. Recent research in the study of acclimation capacity has focused more heavily on the evolution of phenotypic plasticity rather than acclimation responses. Scientists believe that when they understand more about how organisms evolved the capacity to acclimate, they will better understand acclimation.

==Examples==

=== Plants ===
Many plants, such as [[maple tree]]s, [[iris (plant)|irises]], and [[tomato]]es, can survive freezing temperatures if the temperature gradually drops lower and lower each night over a period of days or weeks. The same drop might kill them if it occurred suddenly. Studies have shown that tomato plants that were acclimated to higher temperature over several days were more efficient at photosynthesis at relatively high temperatures than were plants that were not allowed to acclimate.&lt;ref name = "Camejo"&gt;Camejo, D.; Marti, M.; Nicolas, E.; Alarcon, J.; Jimenez, A.; Sevila, F. (2007) Response of superoxide dismutase isoenzymes in tomato plants (''Lycopersicon esculentum'') during thermo-acclimation of the photosynthetic apparatus. ''Physiologia Plantarum'' '''131''', 367-377.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the orchid ''[[Phalaenopsis]]'', [[phenylpropanoid biosynthesis|phenylpropanoid enzyme]]s are enhanced in the process of plant acclimatisation at different levels of [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] photon flux.&lt;ref&gt;Enhancement of phenylpropanoid enzymes and lignin in Phalaenopsis orchid and their influence on plant acclimatisation at different levels of photosynthetic photon flux. Mohammad Babar Ali, Serida Khatun, Eun-Joo Hahn and Kee-Yoeup Paek, Plant Growth Regulation, 2006, Volume 49, Numbers 2-3, pages 137-146, {{doi|10.1007/s10725-006-9003-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animals===
{{Disputed section|date=August 2011}}
Animals acclimatize in many ways. [[Sheep]] grow very thick [[wool]] in cold, damp climates. [[Fish]] are able to adjust only gradually to changes in water temperature and quality. Tropical fish sold at [[pet store]]s are often kept in [[acclimatization bags]] until this process is complete.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cpp.edu/~jskoga/Aquariums/Acclimation.html&lt;/ref&gt; Lowe &amp; Vance (1995) were able to show that lizards acclimated to warm temperatures could maintain a higher running speed at warmer temperatures than lizards that were not acclimated to warm conditions.&lt;ref name = "Lowe"&gt;Lowe, C.H.; Vance, V.J. (1955) Acclimation of the critical thermal maximum of the reptile ''Urosaurus ornatus''. ''Science'' '''122''', 73-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Humans====
The [[salt]] content of sweat and urine decreases as people acclimatize to hot conditions.&lt;ref name="armyheat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usariem.army.mil/pages/download/heatacclimatizationguide.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702085236/http://www.usariem.army.mil/download/heatacclimatizationguide.pdf|archivedate=2007-07-02|title=Heat acclimatization guide|publisher=US Army|accessdate=2009-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plasma volume, heart rate, and capillary activation are also affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sportsci.org/encyc/heataccl/heataccl.html|title=Heat Acclimatization|website=www.sportsci.org|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Effects of high altitude on humans|Acclimatization to high altitude]] continues for months or even years after initial ascent, and ultimately enables humans to survive in an environment that, without acclimatization, would kill them. Humans who migrate permanently to a higher altitude naturally acclimatize to their new environment by developing an increase in the number of [[red blood cells]] to increase the [[oxygen]] carrying capacity of the [[blood]], in order to compensate for lower levels of [[oxygen]] intake.&lt;ref name=Acclimatisation&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Muza, SR |author2=Fulco, CS |author3=Cymerman, A |title=Altitude Acclimatization Guide. |journal=US Army Research Inst. of Environmental Medicine Thermal and Mountain Medicine Division Technical Report |issue=USARIEM–TN–04–05 |year=2004 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/7616 |accessdate=2009-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kenneth"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Kenneth Baillie |author2=Alistair Simpson | title=Altitude oxygen calculator | url=http://www.altitude.org/oxygen_levels.php | publisher=Apex (Altitude Physiology EXpeditions) | accessdate=2006-08-10}} - Altitude physiology model&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>/* Life insurance as a function of the life annuity */[[WP:AWB/T|Typo fixing]], replaced: a of  →  of using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7853">The '''actuarial present value''' ('''APV''') is the [[expected value]] of the [[present value]] of a contingent [[cash flow]] stream (i.e. a series of payments which may or may not be made). Actuarial present values are typically calculated for the benefit-payment or series of payments associated with [[life insurance]] and [[life annuity|life annuities]]. The probability of a future payment is based on assumptions about the person's future mortality which is typically estimated using a life table.

== Life insurance ==

[[Whole life insurance]] pays a pre-determined benefit either at or soon after the insured's death. The symbol ''(x)'' is used to denote "a life aged ''x''" where ''x'' is a non-random parameter that is assumed to be greater than zero. The actuarial present value of one unit of whole life insurance issued to ''(x)'' is denoted by the symbol &lt;math&gt;\,A_x&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\,\overline{A}_x&lt;/math&gt; in [[actuarial notation]]. Let ''G&gt;0'' (the "age at death") be the [[random variable]] that models the age at which an individual, such as ''(x)'', will die. And let ''T'' (the future lifetime random variable) be the time elapsed between age-''x'' and whatever age ''(x)'' is at the time the benefit is paid (even though ''(x)'' is most likely dead at that time). Since ''T'' is a function of G and x we will write ''T=T(G,x)''. Finally, let ''Z'' be the present value random variable of a whole life insurance benefit of 1 payable at time ''T''. Then:

:&lt;math&gt;\,Z=v^T=(1+i)^{-T} = e^{-\delta T} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''i'' is the effective annual interest rate and δ is the equivalent [[force of interest]].

To determine the actuarial present value of the benefit we need to calculate the [[expected value]] &lt;math&gt;\,E(Z)&lt;/math&gt; of this random variable ''Z''. Suppose the death benefit is payable at the end of year of death. Then ''T(G, x) := [[Floor and ceiling functions|ceiling]](G - x)'' is the number of "whole years" (rounded upwards) lived by ''(x)'' beyond age ''x'', so that the actuarial present value of one unit of insurance is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} A_x  &amp;=  E[Z]   =  E[v^T]  \\
 &amp;=  \sum_{t=1}^\infty v^{t}  Pr[T = t]  =  \sum_{t=0}^\infty v^{t+1}  Pr[T(G, x) = t+1]   \\
 &amp;=  \sum_{t=0}^\infty v^{t+1} Pr[t &lt; G - x \leq t+1 \mid G &gt; x] \\
 &amp;=  \sum_{t=0}^\infty v^{t+1} \left(\frac{Pr[G&gt;x+t]}{Pr[G&gt;x]}\right)\left(\frac{Pr[x+t&lt;G\leq x+t+1]}{Pr[G&gt;x+t]}\right) \\ 
 &amp;=  \sum_{t=0}^\infty v^{t+1} {}_t p_x \cdot q_{x+t}  \end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;{}_t p_x&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that ''(x)'' survives to age ''x+t'', and &lt;math&gt;\,q_{x+t}&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that ''(x+t)'' dies within one year.

If the benefit is payable at the moment of death, then ''T(G,x): = G - x'' and the actuarial present value of one unit of whole life insurance is calculated as

:&lt;math&gt;\,\overline{A}_x\! = E[v^T] = \int_0^\infty v^t f_T(t)\,dt = \int_0^\infty v^t\,_tp_x\mu_{x+t}\,dt,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;f_T&lt;/math&gt; is the [[probability density function]] of ''T'', &lt;math&gt;\,_tp_x&lt;/math&gt; is the probability of a life age &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; surviving to age &lt;math&gt;x + t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu_{x+t}&lt;/math&gt; denotes [[force of mortality]] at time &lt;math&gt;x+t&lt;/math&gt; for a life aged &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

The actuarial present value of one unit of an ''n''-year term insurance policy payable at the moment of death can be found similarly by integrating from 0 to ''n''.

The actuarial present value of an n year pure [[Endowment policy|endowment]] insurance benefit of 1 payable after n years if alive, can be found as

:&lt;math&gt;\,_nE_x = Pr[G &gt; x + n]v^n = \,_np_xv^n &lt;/math&gt;

In practice the information available about the random variable ''G'' (and in turn ''T'') may be drawn from life tables, which give figures by year. For example, a three year term life insurance of $100,000 payable at the end of year of death has actuarial present value

:&lt;math&gt;

100,000 \,A_{\stackrel 1 x :{\overline 3|}} = 100,000 \sum_{t=1}^{3} v^{t} Pr[T(G,x) = t]

&lt;/math&gt;

For example, suppose that there is a 90% chance of an individual surviving any given year (i.e. ''T'' has a [[geometric distribution]] with parameter ''p = 0.9'' and the set ''{1, 2, 3, ...}'' for its support). Then

:&lt;math&gt;Pr[T(G,x)=1]=0.1, \quad Pr[T(G,x)=2]=0.9(0.1)=0.09, \quad Pr[T(G,x)=3]=0.9^2(0.1) = 0.081,&lt;/math&gt;

and at interest rate 6% the actuarial present value of one unit of the three year term insurance is

:&lt;math&gt;

\,A_{\stackrel 1 x :{\overline 3|}} = 0.1(1.06)^{-1} + 0.09(1.06)^{-2} + 0.081(1.06)^{-3} = 0.24244846,

&lt;/math&gt;

so the actuarial present value of the $100,000 insurance is $24,244.85.

In practice the benefit may be payable at the end of a shorter period than a year, which requires an adjustment of the formula.

== Life annuity ==

The actuarial present value of a [[life annuity]] of 1 per year paid continuously can be found in two ways:

'''Aggregate payment technique''' (taking the expected value of the total [[present value]]):

This is similar to the method for a life insurance policy. This time the random variable ''Y'' is the total present value random variable of an annuity of 1 per year, issued to a life aged ''x'', paid continuously as long as the person is alive, and is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;Y=\overline{a}_{\overline{T(x)|}} = \frac{1-(1+i)^{-T}}{\delta} = \frac{1-v^T(x)}{\delta},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''T=T(x)'' is the future lifetime random variable for a person age ''x''. The expected value of ''Y'' is:

:&lt;math&gt;\,\overline{a}_x = \int_0^\infty \overline{a}_{\overline{t|}} f_T(t)\,dt = \int_0^\infty \overline{a}_{\overline{t|}} \,_tp_x\mu_{x+t}\,dt.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Current payment technique''' (taking the total present value of the function of time representing the expected values of payments):

:&lt;math&gt;\,\overline{a}_x =\int_0^\infty v^{t} [1-F_T(t)]\,dt= \int_0^\infty v^{t} \,_tp_x\,dt&lt;/math&gt;

where ''F''(''t'') is the [[cumulative distribution function]] of the random variable ''T''.

The equivalence follows also from integration by parts.

In practice life annuities are not paid continuously. If the payments are made at the end of each period the actuarial present value is given by

:&lt;math&gt;a_x = \sum_{k=1}^\infty v^t [1-F_T(t)] = \sum_{t=1}^\infty v^t \,_tp_x. &lt;/math&gt;

Keeping the total payment per year equal to 1, the longer the period, the smaller the present value is due to two effects:

*The payments are made on average half a period later than in the continuous case.
*There is no proportional payment for the time in the period of death, i.e. a "loss" of payment for on average half a period.

Conversely, for contracts costing an equal lumpsum and having the same [[internal rate of return]], the longer the period between payments, the larger the total payment per year.

== Life insurance as a function of the life annuity ==

The APV of whole-life insurance can be derived from the APV of a whole-life annuity-due this way:

:&lt;math&gt;\,A_x = 1-iv \ddot{a}_x&lt;/math&gt;

This is also commonly written as:

:&lt;math&gt;\,A_x = 1-d \ddot{a}_x&lt;/math&gt;

In the continuous case,

:&lt;math&gt;\,\overline{A}_x = 1-\delta \overline{a}_x.&lt;/math&gt;

In the case where the annuity and life insurance are not whole life, one should replace the insurance with an n-year endowment insurance (which can be expressed as the sum of an n-year term insurance and an n-year pure endowment), and the annuity with an n-year annuity due.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20262">[[Mathematics]] encompasses a growing variety and depth of subjects over [[History of mathematics|history]], and comprehension requires a system to categorize and organize the many subjects into more general '''areas of mathematics'''. A number of different classification schemes have arisen, and though they share some similarities, there are differences due in part to the different purposes they serve. In addition, as mathematics continues to be developed, these classification schemes must change as well to account for newly created areas or newly discovered links between different areas. Classification is made more difficult by some subjects, often the most active, which straddle the boundary between different areas.

A traditional division of mathematics is into [[pure mathematics]], mathematics studied for its intrinsic interest, and [[applied mathematics]], mathematics which can be directly applied to real world problems.&lt;ref&gt;For example the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]] groups its mathematics articles as [[wikisource:1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Classified List of Articles#Mathematics|Pure, Applied, and Biographies]].&lt;/ref&gt;
This division is not always clear and many subjects have been developed as pure mathematics to find unexpected applications later on. Broad divisions, such as [[discrete mathematics]] and [[computational mathematics]], have emerged more recently.

An ideal system of classification permits adding new areas into the organization of previous knowledge, and fitting surprising discoveries and unexpected interactions into the outline.
For example, the [[Langlands program]] has found unexpected connections between areas previously thought unconnected, at least [[Galois groups]], [[Riemann surface]]s and [[number theory]].

==Classification systems==
*The [[Mathematics Subject Classification]] (MSC) is produced by the staff of the review databases [[Mathematical Reviews]] and [[Zentralblatt MATH]]. Many mathematics journals ask authors to label their papers with MSC subject codes. The MSC divides mathematics into over 60 areas, with further subdivisions within each area.
*In the [[Library of Congress Classification]], mathematics is assigned the subclass QA within the class Q (Science). The LCC defines [[Library of Congress Classification: Class Q -- Science#QA Mathematics|broad divisions]], and individual subjects are assigned specific numerical values.
*The [[List of Dewey Decimal classes#500 – Science|Dewey Decimal Classification]] assigns mathematics to division 510, with subdivisions for [[Algebra]] &amp; [[number theory]], [[Arithmetic]], [[Topology]], [[Analysis]], [[Geometry]], [[Numerical analysis]], and [[Probabilities]] &amp; [[applied mathematics]].
*The [https://arxiv.org/archive/math Categories within Mathematics] list is used by the [[Arxiv]] for categorizing [[preprints]]. It differs from MSC; for example, it includes things like [[quantum algebra]].
*The [[International Mathematical Union|IMU]] uses its [http://www.mathunion.org/activities/icm/icm-2010-program-structure/ programme structure] for organizing the lectures at its four-yearly [[International Congress of Mathematicians|ICM]]. One of its top-level sections that MSC doesn't have is [[Lie theory]].
*The [[ACM Computing Classification System]] includes a couple of mathematical [http://portal.acm.org/ccs.cfm?part=author&amp;coll=portal&amp;dl=GUIDE categories] F. Theory of Computation and G. Mathematics of Computing.
*[[MathOverflow]] has a [http://mathoverflow.net/tags tag system].
*Mathematics book publishers such as [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] ([https://www.springer.com/mathematics?SGWID=0-10042-0-0-0 subdisciplines]), [[Cambridge University Press|Cambridge]] ([http://www.cambridge.org/gb/knowledge/other_subject/item1521/?site_locale=en_GB Browse Mathematics and statistics]) and the [[American Mathematical Society|AMS]] ([http://www.ams.org/bookstore/textbooks subject area]) use their own subject lists on their websites to enable customers to browse books or filter searches by subdiscipline, including topics such as [[mathematical biology]] and [[mathematical finance]] as top-level headings.
*Schools and other educational bodies have [[syllabus]]es.
*Research institutes and university mathematics departments often have sub-departments or study groups. e.g. [[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics|SIAM]] has [http://siam.org/activity/ activity groups] for its members.
*Wikipedia uses a [[:Category: Mathematics]] system on its articles, and also has a [[list of mathematics lists]].

==Major divisions of mathematics==

===Pure mathematics===

====Foundations====
;[[Recreational mathematics]]
: From [[magic square]]s to the [[Mandelbrot set]], numbers have been a source of amusement and delight for millions of people throughout the ages. Many important branches of "serious" mathematics have their roots in what was once a mere puzzle and/or game.
;[[History of mathematics|History]] and [[List of mathematicians|biography]]
: The history of mathematics is inextricably intertwined with the subject itself. This is perfectly natural: mathematics has an internal organic structure, deriving new theorems from those that have come before. As each new generation of mathematicians builds upon the achievements of our ancestors, the subject itself expands and grows new layers, like an onion.
;[[Mathematical logic]] and [[Foundations of mathematics|foundations]], including [[set theory]]
: Mathematicians have always worked with logic and symbols, but for centuries the underlying laws of logic were taken for granted, and never expressed symbolically. '''Mathematical logic''', also known as '''symbolic logic''', was developed when people finally realized that the tools of mathematics can be used to study the structure of logic itself. Areas of research in this field have expanded rapidly, and are usually subdivided into several distinct departments.
:;[[Model theory]]
:: Model theory studies mathematical [[structure (mathematical logic)|structures]] in a general framework. Its main tool is [[first-order logic]].
:;[[Set theory]]
:: A [[Set (mathematics)|set]] can be thought of as a collection of distinct things united by some common feature. Set theory is subdivided into three main areas. [[Naive set theory]] is the original set theory developed by mathematicians at the end of the 19th century. [[Axiomatic set theory]] is a rigorous [[axiom]]atic theory developed in response to the discovery of serious flaws (such as [[Russell's paradox]]) in naive set theory.  It treats sets as "whatever satisfies the axioms", and the notion of collections of things serves only as motivation for the axioms. [[Internal set theory]] is an axiomatic extension of set theory that supports a [[logically consistent]] identification of ''illimited'' (enormously large) and ''infinitesimal'' (unimaginably small) elements within the [[real number]]s. See also [[List of set theory topics]].
:;[[Proof theory]] and [[constructive mathematics]]
:: '''Proof theory''' grew out of [[David Hilbert]]'s ambitious program to formalize all the proofs in mathematics. The most famous result in the field is encapsulated in [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]]. A closely related and now quite popular concept is the idea of [[Turing machines]]. '''Constructivism''' is the outgrowth of [[L.E.J. Brouwer|Brouwer]]'s unorthodox view of the nature of logic itself; constructively speaking, mathematicians cannot assert "Either a circle is round, or it is not" until they have actually exhibited a circle and measured its roundness.

====Arithmetic====
[[Arithmetic]] is the study of numbers and the properties of operations between them.

====Algebra====
The study of structure begins with [[number]]s, first the familiar [[natural number]]s and [[integer]]s and their [[arithmetic]]al operations, which are recorded in [[elementary algebra]]. The deeper properties of these numbers are studied in [[number theory]]. The investigation of methods to solve equations leads to the field of [[abstract algebra]], which, among other things, studies [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] and [[field (mathematics)|field]]s, structures that generalize the properties possessed by everyday numbers. Long standing questions about [[compass and straightedge]] construction were finally settled by [[Galois theory]]. The physically important concept of [[vector (geometric)|vector]]s, generalized to [[vector space]]s, is studied in [[linear algebra]].

; [[Order theory]]
: For any two distinct  real numbers, one must be greater than the other. Order Theory extends this idea to sets in general. It includes notions like [[lattice (order)|lattices]] and ordered [[algebraic structure]]s. See also the [[order theory glossary]] and the [[list of order topics]].
; General [[algebraic system]]s
: Given a [[Set (mathematics)|set]], different ways of combining or relating members of that set can be defined. If these obey certain rules, then a particular algebraic structure is formed. [[Universal algebra]] is the more formal study of these structures and systems.
; [[Number theory]]
: Number theory is traditionally concerned with the properties of integers. More recently, it has come to be concerned with wider classes of problems that have arisen naturally from the study of integers. It can be divided into elementary number theory (where the integers are studied without the aid of techniques from other mathematical fields); [[analytic number theory]] (where [[calculus]] and [[complex analysis]] are used as tools); [[algebraic number theory]] (which studies the algebraic numbers  - the roots of [[polynomial]]s with integer [[coefficient]]s); [[geometric number theory]]; [[combinatorial number theory]]; [[transcendental number theory]]; and [[computational number theory]]. See also the [[list of number theory topics]].
; [[Field theory (mathematics)|Field theory]] and polynomials
: Field theory studies the properties of [[Field (mathematics)|fields]]. A field is a mathematical entity for which addition, subtraction, multiplication and division are [[well-defined]].  A polynomial is an expression in which constants and variables are combined using only addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
; [[Commutative ring]]s and [[commutative algebra|algebras]]
: In [[ring theory]], a branch of abstract algebra, a commutative ring is a ring in which the multiplication operation obeys the [[commutative operation|commutative law]]. This means that if a and b are any elements of the ring, then a×b=b×a.  Commutative algebra is the field of study of commutative rings and their ideals, modules and algebras.  It is foundational both for [[algebraic geometry]] and for algebraic number theory. The most prominent examples of commutative rings are [[polynomial ring|rings of polynomials]].

====Analysis==== 
Within the world of mathematics, '''[[Mathematical analysis|analysis]]''' is the branch that focuses on change: [[Derivative|rates of change]], [[Integral|accumulated change]], and multiple things changing relative to (or independently of) one another.

Modern analysis is a vast and rapidly expanding branch of mathematics that touches almost every other subdivision of the discipline, finding direct and indirect applications in topics as diverse as [[number theory]], [[cryptography]], and [[abstract algebra]]. It is also the language of science itself and is used across [[chemistry]], [[biology]], and [[physics]], from [[astrophysics]] to [[X-ray crystallography]].

====Combinatorics====
[[Combinatorics]] is the study of finite or discrete collections of objects that satisfy specified criteria. In particular, it is concerned with "counting" the objects in those collections ([[enumerative combinatorics]]) and with deciding whether certain "optimal" objects exist ([[extremal combinatorics]]). It includes [[graph theory]], used to describe inter-connected objects (a graph in this sense is a network, or collection of connected points). See also the [[list of combinatorics topics]], [[list of graph theory topics]] and [[glossary of graph theory]].  A ''combinatorial flavour'' is present in many parts of [[problem-solving]].

====Geometry and topology====
[[Geometry]] deals with spatial relationships, using fundamental qualities or [[axiom]]s. Such axioms can be used in conjunction with mathematical definitions for points, straight lines, curves, surfaces, and solids to draw logical conclusions.  See also [[List of geometry topics]]

;[[Convex geometry]] and [[discrete geometry]]
: Includes the study of objects such as [[polytopes]] and [[polyhedra]]. See also [[List of convexity topics]]
;Discrete or [[combinatorial geometry]]
: The study of geometrical objects and properties that are [[discrete mathematics|discrete]] or [[combinatorial]], either by their nature or by their representation. It includes the study of shapes such as the [[Platonic solids]] and the notion of [[tessellation]].
;[[Differential geometry]]
: The study of geometry using calculus. It is very closely related to [[differential topology]]. Covers such areas as [[Riemannian geometry]], [[curvature]] and [[differential geometry of curves]]. See also the [[glossary of differential geometry and topology]].
;[[Algebraic geometry]]
: Given a [[polynomial]] of two real [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]], then the points on a plane where that function is zero will form a curve. An [[algebraic curve]] extends this notion to polynomials over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] in a given number of variables. Algebraic geometry may be viewed as the study of these curves. See also the [[list of algebraic geometry topics]] and [[list of algebraic surfaces]].
;[[Topology]]
: Deals with the properties of a figure that do not change when the figure is continuously deformed. The main areas are point set topology (or [[general topology]]), [[algebraic topology]], and the topology of [[manifold]]s, defined below.
:;[[General topology]]
:: Also called ''point set topology''. Properties of [[topological space]]s. Includes such notions as [[open set|open]] and [[closed set|closed]] [[Set (mathematics)|sets]], [[compact space]]s, [[continuous function]]s, [[limit of a sequence|convergence]], [[separation axiom]]s, [[metric space]]s, [[dimension theory]].  See also the [[glossary of general topology]] and the [[list of general topology topics]].
:;[[Algebraic topology]]
:: Properties of algebraic objects associated with a topological space and how these algebraic objects capture properties of such spaces.  Contains areas like [[homology theory]], [[cohomology theory]], [[homotopy theory]], and [[homological algebra]], some of them examples of [[functor]]s.  Homotopy deals with [[homotopy group]]s (including the [[fundamental group]]) as well as [[simplicial complexes]] and [[CW complexes]] (also called ''cell complexes'').  See also the [[list of algebraic topology topics]].
:;[[Manifold]]s
:: A manifold can be thought of as an ''n''-[[dimension]]al generalization of a [[Surface (topology)|surface]] in the usual 3-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]. The study of manifolds includes  differential topology, which looks at the properties of differentiable functions defined over a manifold.  See also [[complex manifold]]s.

===Applied mathematics===

====Probability and statistics====
{{See also|glossary of probability and statistics}}

*[[Probability theory]]: The mathematical theory of [[Statistical randomness|random]] phenomena. Probability theory studies [[random variable]]s and [[event (probability theory)|event]]s, which are mathematical abstractions of [[determinism|non-deterministic]] events or measured quantities. See also [[:Category:probability theory]], and the [[list of probability topics]].
**[[Stochastic process]]es: An extension of probability theory that studies collections of random variables, such as [[time series]] or [[random field|spatial processes]]. See also [[List of stochastic processes topics]], and [[:Category:Stochastic processes]].
*[[Statistics]]: The science of making effective use of numerical [[data]] from experiments or from populations of individuals. Statistics includes not only the collection, analysis and interpretation of such data, but also the planning of the collection of data, in terms of the design of [[Survey sampling|surveys]] and [[experimental design|experiments]]. See also the [[list of statistical topics]].

====Computational sciences====
;[[Numerical analysis]]
: Many problems in mathematics cannot in general be solved exactly. Numerical analysis is the study of [[iterative method]]s and [[algorithms]] for approximately solving problems to a specified error bound. Includes [[numerical differentiation]], [[numerical integration]] and [[numerical methods]]; c.f. [[scientific computing]]. See also [[List of numerical analysis topics]]
;[[Computer algebra]]
: This area is also called '''symbolic computation''' or '''algebraic computation'''. It deals with exact computation, for example with integers of arbitrary size, polynomials or elements of finite fields. It includes also the computation with non numeric mathematical objects like polynomial [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]] or series.

====Physical sciences====
; [[Mechanics]]
: Addresses what happens when a real physical object is subjected to forces. This divides naturally into the study of rigid solids, deformable solids, and fluids, detailed below.
: {{further|Continuum mechanics|Elasticity (physics)|Plasticity (physics)}}
; [[Mechanics of structures]]
: Mechanics of structures is a field of study within [[applied mechanics]] that investigates the behavior of structures under mechanical loads, such as bending of a beam, buckling of a column, torsion of a shaft, deflection of a thin shell, and vibration of a bridge.
: {{further|Energy principles in structural mechanics|Flexibility method|Direct stiffness method|Finite element method}}
; [[Materials science|Mechanics of deformable solids]]
: Most real-world objects are not point-like nor perfectly rigid. More importantly, objects change shape when subjected to forces. This subject has a very strong overlap with [[continuum mechanics]], which is concerned with continuous matter. It deals with such notions as [[stress (physics)|stress]], [[Strain (materials science)|strain]] and [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]].
: {{further|Solid state physics|Materials science|Mechanics of materials|Mechanics of solids|Fracture mechanics|Deformation (mechanics)|Deformable bodies}}
; [[Fluid mechanics]]
: [[Fluid]]s in this sense includes not just [[liquid]]s, but flowing [[gas]]es, and even [[solid]]s under certain situations. (For example, dry [[sand]] can behave like a fluid). It includes such notions as [[viscosity]], [[turbulent flow]] and [[laminar flow]] (its opposite).
: {{further|Fluid dynamics|Mechanics of fluids|Rheology|Electrodynamics|Plasma Physics|Gas dynamics|Aerodynamics}}
; [[Particle mechanics]]
: In mathematics, a [[particle]] is a point-like, perfectly rigid, solid object. Particle mechanics deals with the results of subjecting particles to forces. It includes [[celestial mechanics]]—the study of the motion of celestial objects.

====Other applied mathematics====
*[[Operations research]] (OR), also known as operational research, provides optimal or near-optimal solutions to complex problems. OR uses [[mathematical model]]ing, [[statistics|statistical analysis]], and [[mathematical optimization]].
*[[Mathematical programming]] (or mathematical optimization) minimizes (or maximizes) a real-valued function over a domain that is often specified by constraints on the variables. Mathematical programming studies these problems and develops [[iterative method]]s and [[algorithm]]s for their solution.

[[File:CMAC system block diagram.jpg|thumb|320px|A block diagram of the CMAC system for a single joint. The vector S is presented as input to all joints. Each joint separately computes an S -. A* mapping and a joint actuator signal pi. The adjustable weights for a l l joints may reside in the same physical memory.&lt;ref name="Albus75"&gt;J.S. Albus (1975). "A New Approach to Manipulator Control: the Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller (CMAC)". In: ''Trans. ASME, Series G. Journal of Dynamic Systems, Measurement and Control'', Vol. 97, pp. 220–233, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; ]]
The '''cerebellar model arithmetic computer''' (CMAC) is a type of neural network based on a model of the mammalian [[cerebellum]]. It is also known as the cerebellar model articulation controller. It is a type of [[Association (psychology)|associative]] [[memory]].&lt;ref&gt;J.S. Albus (1979). "Mechanisms of Planning and Problem Solving in the Brain". In: ''Mathematical Biosciences''. Vol. 45, pp. 247293, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

The CMAC was first proposed as a function modeler for robotic controllers by [[James Albus]] in 1975&lt;ref name="Albus75"/&gt; (hence the name), but has been extensively used in [[reinforcement learning]] and also as for automated classification in the [[machine learning]] community. CMAC computes a function &lt;math&gt;f(x_1 ... x_n)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of input dimensions. The input space is divided up into hyper-rectangles, each of which is associated with a memory cell. The contents of the memory cells are the weights, which are adjusted during training. Usually, more than one quantisation of input space is used, so that any point in input space is associated with a number of hyper-rectangles, and therefore with a number of memory cells. The output of a CMAC is the algebraic sum of the weights in all the memory cells activated by the input point.

A change of value of the input point results in a change in the set of activated hyper-rectangles, and therefore a change in the set of memory cells participating in the CMAC output. The CMAC output is therefore stored in a distributed fashion, such that the output corresponding to any point in input space is derived from the value stored in a number of memory cells (hence the name associative memory). This provides generalisation.

== Building blocks ==
[[Image:CmacHashing.jpg|thumb|CMAC, represented as a 2D space]]
In the adjacent image, there are two inputs to the CMAC, represented as a 2D space. Two quantising functions have been used to divide this space with two overlapping grids (one shown in heavier lines). A single input is shown near the middle, and this has activated two memory cells, corresponding to the shaded area. If another point occurs close to the one shown, it will share some of the same memory cells, providing generalisation.

The CMAC is trained by presenting pairs of input points and output values, and adjusting the weights in the activated cells by a proportion of the error observed at the output. This simple training algorithm has a proof of convergence.&lt;ref&gt;Y. Wong, CMAC Learning is Governed by a Single Parameter, IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks, San Francisco, Vol. 1, pp. 1439–43, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is normal to add a kernel function to the hyper-rectangle, so that points falling towards the edge of a hyper-rectangle have a smaller activation than those falling near the centre.&lt;ref&gt;P.C.E. An, W.T. Miller, and P.C. Parks, Design Improvements in Associative Memories for Cerebellar Model Articulation Controllers, Proc. ICANN, pp. 1207–10, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major problems cited in practical use of CMAC is the memory size required, which is directly related to the number of cells used. This is usually ameliorated by using a [[hash function]], and only providing memory storage for the actual cells that are activated by inputs.

== One-step convergent algorithm  ==
Initially least mean square (LMS) method is employed to update the weights of CMAC. The convergence of using LMS for training CMAC is sensitive to the learning rate and could lead to divergence. In 2004 &lt;ref name="Qin1"&gt;Ting Qin, et al. "A learning algorithm of CMAC based on RLS." Neural Processing Letters 19.1 (2004): 49-61.&lt;/ref&gt;, a recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm was introduced to train CMAC online. It does not need to tune a learning rate.  Its convergence has been proved theoretically and can be guaranteed to converge in one step. The computational complexity of this RLS algorithm is O(N3).

&lt;ref name="Qin2" /&gt;]]

[[File:Ccmac.jpg|thumb|Left panel: real functions; right panel: CMAC approximation with derivatives|360x360px]]

== Hardware implementation infrastructure ==
Based on QR decomposition, an algorithm (QRLS) has been further simplified to have an O(N) complexity. Consequently, this reduces memory usage and time cost significantly. A parallel pipeline array structure on implementing this algorithm has been introduced&lt;ref name="Qin2"&gt;Ting Qin, et al. "Continuous CMAC-QRLS and its systolic array." Neural Processing Letters 22.1 (2005): 1-16.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Overall by utilizing QRLS algorithm, the CMAC neural network convergence can be guaranteed, and the weights of the nodes can be updated using one step of training. Its parallel pipeline array structure offers its great potential to be implemented in hardware for large-scale industry usage.

==Continuous CMAC ==
Since the rectangular shape of CMAC receptive field functions produce discontinuous staircase function approximation, by integrating CMAC with B-splines functions, continuous CMAC offers the capability of obtaining any order of derivatives of the approximate functions.
==Deep CMAC ==
In recent years, numerous studies have confirmed that by stacking several shallow structures into a single deep structure, the overall system could achieve better data representation, and, thus, more effectively deal with nonlinear and high complexity tasks. In 2018 &lt;ref&gt;* Yu Tsao, et al. "Adaptive Noise Cancellation Using Deep Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller." IEEE Access Vol. 6, pp. 37395 - 37402, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;, a deep CMAC (DCMAC) framework was proposed and a backpropagation algorithm was derived to estimate the DCMAC parameters. Experimental results of an adaptive noise cancellation task showed that the proposed DCMAC can achieve better noise cancellation performance when compared with that from the conventional single-layer CMAC.

The [[enzyme]] '''citrate synthase''' [[Enzyme Commission number|E.C.]] 2.3.3.1 (previously 4.1.3.7)] exists in nearly all living cells and stands as a pace-making enzyme in the first step of the [[citric acid cycle]] (or [[Krebs cycle]]).&lt;ref name = "Weigand_1986"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wiegand G, Remington SJ | title = Citrate synthase: structure, control, and mechanism | journal = Annual Review of Biophysics and Biophysical Chemistry | date = 1986 | volume = 15 | pages = 97–117 | pmid = 3013232 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.bb.15.060186.000525 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Citrate synthase is localized within [[eukaryotic]] cells in the [[mitochondrial matrix]], but is encoded by nuclear [[DNA]] rather than mitochondrial. It is synthesized using cytoplasmic [[ribosomes]], then transported into the mitochondrial matrix.
 
Citrate synthase is commonly used as a quantitative enzyme marker for the presence of intact [[mitochondria]]. Maximal activity of citrate synthase indicates the mitochondrial content of skeletal muscle.&lt;ref name="pmid27115137"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Gillen JB, Martin BJ, MacInnis MJ, Skelly LE, Tarnopolsky MA, Gibala MJ | title=Twelve Weeks of Sprint Interval Training Improves Indices of Cardiometabolic Health Similar to Traditional Endurance Training despite a Five-Fold Lower Exercise Volume and Time Commitment | journal= [[PLOS One]] | volume=11 | issue=4 | pages=e0154075 | year=2016 | url= http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0154075 | doi= 10.1371/journal.pone.0154075 | PMC=4846072  | PMID = 27115137 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The maximal activity can be increased by [[endurance training]] or [[high-intensity interval training]],&lt;ref name="pmid27115137"/&gt; but maximal activity is increased more with high-intensity interval training.&lt;ref name="pmid27396440"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=MacInnis MJ, Zacharewicz E, Martin BJ, Haikalis ME, Skelly LE, Tarnopolsky MA, Murphy RM, Gibala MJ| title=Superior mitochondrial adaptations in human skeletal muscle after interval compared to continuous single-leg cycling matched for total work | journal= [[The Journal of Physiology]] | volume=595 | issue=9 | pages=2955-2968 | year=2017  | doi= 10.1113/JP272570 | PMC=5407978  | PMID = 27396440 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citrate synthase [[catalysis|catalyzes]] the [[condensation reaction]] of the two-carbon [[acetate]] residue from [[acetyl coenzyme A]] and a molecule of four-carbon [[oxaloacetate]] to form the six-carbon [[citrate]]:&lt;ref name = "Weigand_1986"/&gt;

 Image:Oxaloacetic acid.png|[[Oxaloacetic acid]]
 Image:Citrate wpmp.png|[[Citric acid]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Oxaloacetate is regenerated after the completion of one round of the Krebs cycle.

Oxaloacetate is the first substrate to bind to the enzyme. This induces the enzyme to change its conformation, and creates a binding site for the acetyl-CoA. Only when this [[citroyl-CoA]] has formed will another conformational change cause thioester [[hydrolysis]] and release coenzyme A. This ensures that the energy released from the thioester bond cleavage will drive the condensation.

Citrate synthase's 437 amino acid residues are organized into two main subunits, each consisting of 20 alpha-helices.  These alpha helices compose approximately 75% of citrate synthase's [[tertiary structure]], while the remaining residues mainly compose irregular extensions of the structure, save a single beta-sheet of 13 residues.  Between these two subunits,  a single cleft exists containing the active site.  Two binding sites can be found therein: one reserved for citrate or oxaloacetate and the other for Coenzyme A.  The active site contains three key residues: His274, His320, and Asp375 that are highly selective in their interactions with substrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goodsell | first1 = D.S. | name-list-format = vanc | title = Citrate Synthase | journal = Molecule of the Month | publisher = RCSB Protein Data Bank | date = 1 September 2007 | volume = | doi = 10.2210/rcsb_pdb/mom_2007_9 }}; {{PDB|1CSC|5CSC|5CTS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mechanism ===

Citrate synthase has three key [[amino acids]] in its [[active site]] (known as the [[catalytic triad]]) which catalyze the conversion of [[acetyl-CoA]] [H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CC(=O)−SCoA] and [[oxaloacetate]] [&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C(=O)CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;] into [[citrate]] [&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C(OH)(CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;] and H−SCoA in an [[aldol condensation]] reaction.  This conversion begins with the negatively charged carboxylate side chain oxygen atom of Asp-375 deprotonating acetyl CoA’s alpha carbon atom to form an enolate anion which in turn is neutralized by protonation by His-274 to form an [[enol]] intermediate [H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C=C(OH)−SCoA]. At this point, the epsilon nitrogen lone pair of electrons on His-274 formed in the last step abstracts the hydroxyl enol proton to reform an enolate anion that initiates a [[nucleophilic]] attack on the oxaloacetate’s carbonyl carbon [&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C(=O)CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;] which in turn [[deprotonation|deprotonate]] the epsilon nitrogen atom of His-320.  This [[nucleophilic addition]] results in the formation of citroyl−CoA [&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH(CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C(=O)−SCoA].  At this point, a water molecule is deprotonated by the epsilon nitrogen atom of His-320 and [[hydrolysis]] is initiated.  One of the oxygen’s lone pairs nucleophilically attacks the [[carbonyl]] carbon of citroyl−CoA.  This forms a tetrahedral intermediate and results in the ejection of −SCoA as the carbonyl reforms.  The −SCoA is protonated to form HSCoA.  Finally, the hydroxyl added to the carbonyl in the previous step is deprotonated and citrate [&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C(OH)(CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;] is formed.&lt;ref name = "Lehninger"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Cox | first1 = David L. | last2 = Nelson | first2 = Michael M. | name-list-format = vanc | title = Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry | date = 2005 | publisher = W.H.

=== Inhibition ===

The enzyme is inhibited by high ratios of [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]:[[Adenosine diphosphate|ADP]], acetyl-CoA:CoA, and [[NADH]]:[[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD]], as high concentrations of ATP, acetyl-CoA, and NADH show that the energy supply is high for the cell.  It is also inhibited by [[succinyl-CoA]], which resembles Acetyl-coA and acts as a competitive inhibitor to acetyl-CoA and a noncompetitive inhibitor to oxaloacetate&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Colleen M.|last2=Williamson|first2=John R.|date=1971-10-15|title=Inhibition of citrate synthase by succinyl-CoA and other metabolites|url=https://febs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1016/0014-5793(71)80400-3|journal=FEBS Letters|volume=18|issue=1|pages=35–38|doi=10.1016/0014-5793(71)80400-3|issn=0014-5793}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Citrate]] inhibits the reaction and is an example of product inhibition.
The inhibition of citrate synthase by acetyl-CoA analogues has also been well documented and has been used to prove the existence of a single active site.  These experiments have revealed that this single site alternates between two forms, which participate in ligase and hydrolase activity respectively.&lt;ref name = "Bayer_1981"/&gt;  This protein may use the [[morpheein]] model of [[allosteric regulation]].&lt;ref name=pmid22182754&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Selwood T, Jaffe EK | title = Dynamic dissociating homo-oligomers and the control of protein function | journal = Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics | volume = 519 | issue = 2 | pages = 131–43 | date = Mar 2012 | pmid = 22182754 | pmc = 3298769 | doi = 10.1016/j.abb.2011.11.020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clinical nutrition''' is [[nutrition]] of [[patients]] in [[health care]]. [[wiktionary:clinical|Clinical]] in this sense refers to the management of patients, including not only outpatients at [[clinic]]s, but also (and mainly) inpatients in hospitals. It incorporates primarily the scientific fields of [[nutrition]] and [[diet (nutrition)|dietetics]]. It aims to keep a healthy [[Energy balance (biology)|energy balance]] in patients, as well as providing sufficient amounts other nutrients such as protein, vitamins, minerals.

==Methods of nutrition==
Among the [[routes of administration]], the preferred means of nutrition is, if possible, [[oral administration]]. Alternatives include [[enteral administration]] (in [[nasogastric feeding]]) and [[intravenous]] (in [[parenteral nutrition]]).

==Clinical malnutrition==
In the field of clinical nutrition, [[malnutrition]] has causes, epidemiology and management distinct from those associated with malnutrition that is mainly related to poverty.

The main causes of ''clinical malnutrition'' are:
* [[Cachexia]] caused by diseases, injuries and/or aging
* Difficulties with ingestion, such as [[stroke]], [[paresis]], [[dementia]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[dysphagia]]

Clinical malnutrition may also be aggravated by [[iatrogenic]] factors, i.e., the inability of a [[health care]] entity to appropriately compensate for causes of malnutrition.

There are various definitions of clinical malnutrition. According to one of them, patients are defined as ''severely undernourished'' when meeting at least one of the following criteria: [[body mass index|BMI]] [[less than|&lt;]] or = 20&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and/or [[more than|&gt;]] or = 5% unintentional weight loss in the past month and/or &gt; or = 10% unintentional weight loss in the past 6 months. By the same system, the patient is ''moderately undernourished'' if they met at least one of the following criteria: BMI 20.1–22&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and/or 5-10% unintentional weight loss in the past six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kruizenga HM, de Vet HC, Van Marissing CM |title=The SNAQ(RC), an easy traffic light system as a first step in the recognition of undernutrition in residential care |journal=J Nutr Health Aging |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=83–9 |year=2010 |doi= 10.1007/s12603-009-0147-1|pmid=20126953|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Closed ecological systems''' ('''CES''') are [[ecosystems]] that do not rely on matter exchange with any part outside the system.

The term is most often used to describe small [[wikt:manmade|manmade]] ecosystems. Such systems are scientifically interesting and can potentially serve as a [[life support system]] during [[space flight]]s, in [[space stations]] or [[space habitat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Manmade Closed Ecological Systems | author= I. I. Gitelson | author2= G. M. Lisovsky | author3= R. D. MacElroy | last-author-amp= yes | publisher= [[Taylor &amp; Francis]] |date=2003 | ISBN = 0-415-29998-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a closed ecological system, any waste products produced by one species must be used by at least one other species. If the purpose is to maintain a life form, such as a [[mouse]] or a [[human]], waste products such as [[carbon dioxide]], [[feces]] and [[urine]] must eventually be converted into [[oxygen]], [[food]], and [[water]].

A closed ecological system must contain at least one [[autotroph]]ic organism. While both [[chemotroph]]ic and [[phototroph]]ic organisms are plausible, almost all closed ecological systems to date are based on a phototroph such as green [[algae]].

== Examples ==

A closed ecological system for an entire planet is called an [[Ecosphere (planetary)|ecosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cof.orst.edu/cof/fs/turner/pdfs/lexicon_of_the_spheres.pdf|title=A Lexicon of the Spheres|publisher=[[Oregon State University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencehelpdesk.com/unit/science2/11|title=ESO 2 Science 11: The Ecosphere and the Ecosystems|publisher=Science Helpdesk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Artificiality|Man-made]] closed ecological systems which were created to sustain human life include [[Biosphere 2]], [[MELiSSA]], and the BIOS-1, BIOS-2, and [[BIOS-3]] projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=BioScience | date=Oct 1997 | volume=47 |issue=9 | pages=575–85 | title= Bios-3: Siberian experiments in bioregenerative life support | author=Salisbury FB | author2=Gitelson JI | author3=Lisovsky GM | doi=10.2307/1313164 | pmid=11540303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bottle garden]]s and [[Ecosphere (aquarium)|aquarium ecospheres]] are partially or fully enclosed glass containers that are self-sustaining closed ecosystems that can be made or purchased. They can include tiny [[shrimp]], [[algae]], [[gravel]], decorative [[Animal shell|shell]]s, and [[gorgonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ecospheres.co.uk/what-is-an-ecosphere/  | title=What is an EcoSphere?  (Shrimp and Gorgonia coral)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==

The 1993 novel ''[[This Other Eden (novel)|This Other Eden]]'' by [[Ben Elton]] featured the development of "claustrospheres" which were closed ecological systems contained within a dome in which people could take refuge in the event of environmental collapse.

The critically panned 1996 comedy film ''[[Bio-Dome]]'' involved the protagonists becoming trapped in a closed ecological system being run as an experiment.

{{evolutionary biology}}

In [[phylogenetics]], the '''crown group''' of a collection of [[species]] consists of the living representatives of the collection together with their ancestors back to their [[most recent common ancestor]] as well as all of that ancestor's descendants. It is thus a [[clade]], a group consisting of a species and all its descendants.

The concept was developed by [[Willi Hennig]], the formulator of [[cladistics|phylogenetic systematics]], as a way of classifying living organisms relative to their extinct relatives in his "Die Stammesgeschichte der Insekten",&lt;ref name=Hennig1969&gt;{{citation

==Contents of the crown group==
It is not necessary for a species to have living descendants in order for it to be included in the crown group. Extinct side branches on the [[family tree]] that are descended from the most recent common ancestor of living members will still be part of a crown group. For example, if we consider the crown-birds (i.e. all [[Extant taxon|extant]] birds and the rest of the family tree back to their most recent common ancestor), extinct side branches like the [[dodo]] or [[great auk]] are still descended from the most recent common ancestor of all living [[bird]]s, so fall within the bird crown group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DNA yields dodo family secrets|work=[[BBC News]]|date=2002-02-28|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1847431.stm|accessdate=2006-09-07 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; One very simplified cladogram for birds is shown below:&lt;ref name="chiappe2007"&gt;{{Citation|last=Chiappe |first=Luis M. |year=2007 |title=Glorified Dinosaurs: The Origin and Early Evolution of Birds |location=Sydney |publisher=University of New South Wales Press |isbn=978-0-86840-413-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this diagram, the clade labelled "Neornithes" is the crown group of birds: it includes the most recent common ancestor of all living birds and its descendants, living or not. Although considered to be birds (i.e. members of the clade Aves), ''Archaeopteryx'' and other extinct groups are not included in the crown group, as they fall outside the Neornithes clade, being descended from an earlier ancestor.

An alternative definition does not require any members of a crown group to be extant, only to have resulted from a "major cladogenesis event".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=UCMP Glossary: Phylogenetics |publisher=University of California Museum of Paleontology |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/glossary/glossary_1.html |accessdate=2010-12-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first definition forms the basis of this article.

Often, the crown group is given the designation "crown-", to separate it from the group as commonly defined. Both [[birds]] and [[mammals]] are traditionally defined by their traits,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=ed|first=Rob Nagel,|title=U-X-L encyclopedia of science.|year=2001|publisher=U-X-L|location=Detroit|isbn=0787654329|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Benton|first=Michael J.|title=Vertebrate palaeontology|year=2004|publisher=Blackwell Science|location=Oxford|isbn=0632056371|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contain fossil members that lived before the last common ancestors of the living groups or, like the mammal ''[[Haldanodon]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Luo, Zhe-Xi |title=Transformation and diversification in early mammal evolution |journal=Nature |volume=450 |issue=7172 |pages=1011–1019 |year=2007 |pmid=18075580 |doi=10.1038/nature06277 |url=http://carnegiemnh.net/assets/science/vp/Luo%202007%20%28Mesozoic%20mammal%20review%29%5B1%5D.pdf |bibcode=2007Natur.450.1011L |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121124020009/http://carnegiemnh.net/assets/science/vp/Luo%202007%20%28Mesozoic%20mammal%20review%29%5B1%5D.pdf |archivedate=2012-11-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; were not descended from that ancestor although they lived later. Crown-Aves and Crown-Mammalia therefore differ slightly in content from the common definition of Aves and Mammalia.

==Other groups under the crown group concept==
The cladistic idea of strictly using the topology of the [[phylogenetic tree]] to define groups, necessitates other definitions than crown groups to adequately define commonly discussed fossil groups like various [[Burgess Shale]] fauna. Thus, a host of [[prefix]]es have been defined to describe various branches of the phylogenetic tree relative to extant organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Craske, A. J. &amp; Jefferies, R. P. S. (1989): A new mitrate from the Upper Ordovician of Norway, and a new approach to subdividing a plesion. ''Palaeontology'' no 32, pages 69–99&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pan-group===
A '''pan-group''' or '''total group''' is the crown group and all organisms more closely related to it than to any other [[extant taxon|extant]] organisms. In a tree analogy, it is the crown group and all branches back to (but not including) the split with the closest branch to have living members. The Pan-Aves thus contain the living birds and all (fossil) organisms more closely related to birds than to [[crocodilian]]s (their closest living relatives). The phylogenetic lineage leading back from [[Neornithes]] to the point where it merges with the crocodilian lineage, along with all side branches, constitutes pan-birds. In addition to non-crown group primitive birds like ''Archaeopteryx'', ''[[Hesperornis]]'' and ''[[Confuciusornis]]'', therefore, pan-group birds would include all [[dinosaur]]s and [[pterosaur]]s as well as an assortment of non-crocodilian animals like ''[[Marasuchus]]''.

Pan-Mammalia consists of all mammals and their fossil ancestors back to the phylogenetic split from the remaining [[amniotes]] (the [[Sauropsida]]). Pan-Mammalia is thus an alternative name for [[Synapsida]].

{{redirect|Stem group|stem groups in mathematics|isoclinism of groups}}
===Stem groups===
A '''stem group''' is a [[paraphyletic]] group composed of a pan-group or total group, above, ''minus'' the crown group itself (and therefore minus all living members of the pan-group). This leaves primitive relatives of the crown groups, back along the phylogenetic line to (but not including) the [[last common ancestor]] of the crown group and their nearest living relatives. It follows from the definition that all members of a stem group are extinct. The "stem group" is the most used and most important of the concepts linked to crown groups, as it offers a purely phylogenetic route to classify fossils that otherwise do not fit into systematics based on living organisms.

While often attributed to Jefferies (1979), Willmann (2003)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Willmann|first=Rainer|title=From Haeckel to Hennig:  the early development of phylogenetics in German-speaking Europe|journal=Cladistics |year=2003|volume=19|pages=449–479|doi=10.1016/j.cladistics.2003.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; traced the origin of the stem group concept to German systematist Othniel Abel (1914)

 | author = Abel, O.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was discussed and diagrammed in English as early as 1933 by [[Alfred Romer|A. S. Romer]].&lt;ref name=Romer1933&gt;{{citation

Alternatively, the term "stem group" is sometimes used in a narrower sense to cover just the members of the traditional taxon falling outside the crown group. Permian synapsids like ''[[Dimetrodon]]'' and ''[[Anteosaurus]]'' are stem mammals in the wider sense but not in the narrower one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Czaplewski|first=Terry A. Vaughan, James M. Ryan, Nicholas J.|title=Mammalogy|year=2000|publisher=Brooks/Cole Thomson Learning|location=Fort Worth|isbn=003025034X|page=61|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LD1nDlzXYicC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;dq=Thrinaxodon+jaw+joint&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fyNh_jXDhU&amp;sig=Axq3-lnEd_OjGxTO8DjWU9QWrEs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FCX0UemnEcSm4ATQ-oGIAg&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=Stem%20mammals&amp;f=false|edition=4th|accessdate=27 July 2013|quote=From a [[cynodont]] ancestry, the stem mammals arose in the late Triassic, slightly after the first appearance of dinosaurs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Examples of stem groups (in the wider sense)====
'''Stem birds''' perhaps constitute the most cited example of a stem group, as the phylogeny of this group is fairly well known. The following cladogram, based on Benton (2005),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Vertebrate Palaeontology |edition=3rd|author=Benton, M.

The crown group here is [[Neornithes]], all modern bird lineages back to their last common ancestor. The closest living relatives of birds are [[crocodilian]]s. If we follow the phylogenetic lineage leading to Neornithes to the left, the line itself and all side branches belong to the stem birds until the lineage merges with that of the crocodilians. In addition to non-crown group primitive birds like ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'', ''[[Hesperornis]]'' and ''[[Confuciusornis]]'', stem group birds include the [[dinosaurs]] and the [[pterosaurs]]. The last common ancestor of birds and crocodilians—the first crown group archosaur—was neither bird nor crocodilian and possessed none of the features unique to either. As the bird stem group evolved, distinctive bird features such as feathers and hollow bones appeared. Finally, at the base of the crown group, all traits common to extant birds were present.

'''Stem mammals''' are those in the lineage leading to living mammals, together with side branches, from the divergence of the lineage from the Sauropsida to the last common ancestor of the living mammals. This group includes the [[synapsid]]s as well as [[Mammaliaformes|mammaliaforms]] like the [[Morganucodonta|morganucodonts]] and the [[Docodonta|docodonts]]; the latter groups are traditionally and anatomically been considered mammals even though they fall outside the crown group mammals.&lt;ref name=Romer&gt;[[Alfred Romer|Romer, A.S.]] (1966): Vertebrate Paleontology. University of Chicago Press, Chicago; 3rd edition {{ISBN|0-7167-1822-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Stem Tetrapoda|Stem tetrapods]]''' are the animals belonging to the lineage leading to [[tetrapod]]s from their divergence from the [[lungfish]], our nearest relatives among the fishes. In addition to a series of [[lobe-finned fishes]], they also include some of the early [[labyrinthodontia|labyrinthodonts]]. Exactly what labyrinthodonts are in the stem group tetrapods rather than the corresponding crown group is uncertain, as the phylogeny of early tetrapods is not well understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marjanović|first=David|author2=Laurin, Michel|title=The origin(s) of extant amphibians: a review with emphasis on the "lepospondyl hypothesis"|journal=Geodiversitas|date=1 March 2013|volume=35|issue=1|pages=207–272|doi=10.5252/g2013n1a8|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.5252/g2013n1a8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This example shows that crown and stem group definitions are of limited value when there is no consensus phylogeny.

'''Stem arthropods''' constitute a group that has seen attention in connection with the [[Burgess Shale]] fauna. Several of [[fossils of the Burgess Shale|the finds]], including the enigmatic ''[[Opabinia]]'' and ''[[Anomalocaris]]'' have some, though not all, features associated with [[arthropod]]s, and are thus considered stem arthropods.&lt;ref name="Budd1996"&gt;{{Citation

'''Stem priapulids''' are other early Cambrian to middle Cambrian faunas, appearing in Chengjiang to Burgess Shale. The genus ''[[Ottoia]]'' has more or less the same build as modern [[priapulida|priapulids]], but phylogenetic analysis indicates that it falls outside the crown group, making it a stem priapulid.&lt;ref name=Budd2000/&gt;

===Plesion-group===
The name ''plesion'' has a long history in biological systematics, and '''plesion group''' has acquired several meanings over the years. One use is as "nearby group" (plesion means ''close to'' in [[Greek language|Greek]]), i.e. [[sister group]] to a given [[taxon]], whether that group is a crown group or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Patterson|first=C.|author2=Rosen, D.E.|title=Review of ichthyodectiform and other Mesozoic teleost fishes and the theory and practice of classifying fossils|journal=Bulletine of American Natural History|year=1977|volume=158|issue=2|pages=85–172}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term may also mean a group, possibly [[paraphyletic]], defined by primitive traits (i.e. [[symplesiomorphy|symplesiomorphies]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kluge|first=N.|title=Modern Systematics of Insects. Part I. Principles of Systematics of Living Organisms and General System of Insects, with Classification of Primary Wingless and Paleopterous Insects|year=2000|publisher=Lan'|location=St. Petersburg, Russland|pages=336|url=http://www.insecta.bio.pu.ru/z/syst_I_2.htm|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally taken to mean a side branch splitting off earlier on the phylogenetic tree than the group in question.

==Palaeontological significance of stem and crown groups==
Placing [[fossil]]s in their right order in a stem group allows the order of these acquisitions to be established, and thus the ecological and functional setting of the evolution of the major features of the group in question.  Stem groups thus offer a route to integrate unique palaeontological data into questions of the evolution of living organisms.  Furthermore, they show that fossils that were considered to lie in their own separate group because they did not show all the diagnostic features of a living clade, can nevertheless be related to it by lying in its stem group.  Such fossils have been of particular importance in considering the origins of the [[tetrapods]], [[mammals]], and [[animal]]s.

The application of the stem group concept also influenced the interpretation of the organisms of the [[Burgess shale]]. Their classification in stem groups to extant phyla, rather than in phyla of their own, is thought by some to make the [[Cambrian explosion]] easier to understand without invoking unusual evolutionary mechanisms;&lt;ref name=Brysse2008&gt;{{citation

==Stem groups in systematics==
As originally proposed by [[Karl-Ernst Lauterbach]], stem groups should be given the prefix "stem" (i.e. Stem-Aves, Stem-Arthropoda), however the crown group should have no prefix.&lt;ref&gt;Lauterbach, K-E. (1989): Das Pan-Monophylum – ein Hilfsmittel für die Praxis der Phylogenetischen Systematik. ''Zoologischer Anzeiger'', no 223, pp 139–156.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter has not been universally accepted for known groups. A number of [[Paleontology|paleontologists]] have opted to apply this approach anyway.&lt;ref&gt;Gauthier, J., and de Queiroz, K. (2001).

The '''Dana/Spicer Model 70''' is an automotive axle manufactured by [[Dana Holding Corporation]] and has been used in OEM heavy duty applications by [[Chevrolet]], [[Dodge]], and [[Ford]]. It can be identified by its straight axle tubes, 10 bolt asymmetrical cover, and a "70" cast in to the housing and is visually similar to the [[Dana 60]]. The majority of the Dana 70s are rear axles, however Dana 70 front axles do exist. Both front and rear axle variations were first offered in 1957. The Dana 70 is generally regarded to have more strength than a [[Dana 60]] but not as much as a [[Dana 80]]. Gross axle weight ratings are often lowered by the vehicle manufacturer for safety and tire reasons.

==Front axle==
[[File:DANA70HDKodiaks.jpg|thumb|Dana 70 HD Front axle in a Chevy Kodiak 4500 4x4 truck.]]

In general, Dana 70 front axles are uncommon, due to attributes that the [[Dana 60]] front axle can match. The main advantage a Dana 70 front axle has over a Dana 60 front axle is better gross axle weight ratings.

===Dodge and IHC Dana 70 front axles===
The first Dana 70 front axle was used in 1958 by Dodge in the W300, in both 4.88 and 5.87 ratios. International started using Dana 70 front axles in the late 1960s. Both companies used Dana 70 front axles until the mid-1970s (Dodge W300 pickup up until 1978, discontinued in 1979). All of these Dana 70 front axles were closed knuckle, with king pins and had a [[Gross axle weight rating|GAWR]] of 6000&amp;nbsp;lbs. Like the rear Dana 70 axles, the Dana 70 front axle started out with 23 spline axle shafts and then went to 35 spline axle shafts. While these axles were being manufactured, Dana offered a "Power-Lok" [[limited slip differential]] for some of these axles.

===GM Dana 70 front axles===
GM began making 4x4 [[Chevrolet Kodiak]]s and GMC Topkicks that utilize a Dana 70 front axle for the 2005-2009 models. These Dana 70 axles had open knuckles and [[ball joint]]s. These Dana 70 axles only came with 5.13:1 gear ratios and had a GAWR of 8000&amp;nbsp;lbs. They differ greatly from previous Dana 70 front axles, some of the major differences being the use of 1550 Universal Joints and being a high pinion, reverse cut axle.

==Rear axle==
All Dana 70 rear axles are [[axle#Full-floating vs semi-floating|full floating]] and ''typically'' have a gross axle rating of {{Convert|7500|lbs||abbr=on}}. The Dana 70 rear axle was first used in the Dodge W300 in 1958. The Dana 70 started out using 10 spline pinions and 23 spline axle shafts. The later, more current, Dana 70 axles use 29 spline pinions and 32 or 35 spline axle shafts. Dana offered two different [[limited slip differential]]s with the Dana 70, the "Power-Lok" and the "Trac-Lok."

[[File:Dana70.jpg|thumb|left|Dana 70U rear axle in a 1998 2500 Dodge Diesel]]

===Dana 70HD===
In the 1970s the Dana 70HD was offered. The axle tubes were increased to {{Convert|4|in|}} diameter and carrier bearings were larger and thicker, the axle shafts were 35 spline only. These upgrades gave the Dana 70HD a gross axle rating of {{Convert|10000|lbs||abbr=on}}. The Dana 70 front drive axles used in the Chevrolet Kodiaks and GMC Topkicks also had these features.  This axle was standard for the [[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)]] dual rear wheel trucks until 1985, when Ford started using the [[Sterling_10.5_axle|Sterling 10.25]] rear axle. However Ford still kept the Dana 70HD an option until the [[Dana 80]] was made available. The axle was available or optional for the Big Three until 1994 when Dodge used the Dana 80 for its dual rear wheel trucks instead. The Dana 70HD is still seen in commercial applications today. In the UK the 70HD Dana axles were license built by Salisbury Engineering in an early 10/23 spline version with a {{Convert|4.3|t|lbs}} rating for the [[Ford A-series]] truck with a European 6 × {{Convert|205|mm||abbr=on}} DIN standard hub bolt pattern.

===Dana 70U/Dana 70B===
In the 1980s the Dana 70U or Dana 70B was offered. GM, Ford and Dodge all used this axle.    This axle had a ''smaller'' pinion bearing and mostly have 32 spline axle shafts.   The Dana 70U and Dana 70B both have gross axle weight ratings of {{Convert|7500|lbs||abbr=on}}.  The [[Dodge Ram#1994–2001 (BR/BE)|2nd generation]] Dodge Ram trucks consistently feature this axle in the 2500 trucks with the Diesel or V10 ''and'' automatic transmission. This axle was designed for single rear wheel applications.

==Pinion Offsets==
There are three pinion offsets for the Dana 70 rear axle. {{Convert|1/2|,|5/8|and|31/32|in}} offset. The first Dana 70 axles had a {{Convert|1/2|in||adj=on}} pinion offset and were found in Dana 70HD's as well. The drawback with the &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-inch offset was that a 4.10:1 gear ratio was the highest gear set possible. In the 1970s the &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-inch offset was phased out for a {{Convert|5/8|in||adj=on}} offset that allowed for higher gearing. The &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; offset was used in all the major variations of the Dana 70 and is still being used today. A {{Convert|31/32|in||adj=on}} offset was used for a short time in the late 1980s to the early 1990s to allow even higher gears than the &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; offset could offer. Only the Dana 70-3HD used the &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-inch offset.

'''Diocletian windows''', also called '''thermal windows''', are large semicircular windows characteristic of the enormous [[public bath]]s (''[[thermae]]'') of [[Ancient Rome]]. They have been revived on a limited basis by some [[neo-classical architecture|classical revivalist architects]] in more modern times.

==Description==
Diocletian windows are large segmental arched [[window]]s (or other openings) which are usually divided into three lights (window compartments) by two vertical [[mullion]]s. The central compartment is often wider than the two side lights on either side of it.&lt;ref name=pevsner1&gt;{{cite book|title=Pevsner's Architectural Glossary|year=2010|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-16721-4|editor=Bradley, Simon|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Names ==
Diocletian windows are named after the windows found in the [[Baths of Diocletian|Thermae (Baths) of Diocletian]] (AD 302) in [[Rome]]. (The Thermae is now the church of [[Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri]].) The variant name, thermal window, also comes from their association with the Thermae of Diocletian.

== Influence ==
[[File:Penn Station3.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;A five-light variant of the thermal window is seen on the old [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Penn Station]] in New York City (''circa'' 1911).]]

This type of window was revived and used in Italy in the 16th century, especially by [[Andrea Palladio]]. Palladio and others incorporated an elongated Diocletian window in the form of an arched central light flanked by narrower, square-headed apertures. This combination became known as a [[Palladian architecture#The Palladian window|Palladian, or Venetian, window]].

The Diocletian window was much used in the early 18th century by the English architect [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington|Richard Boyle]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/164082/Diocletian-window www.britannica.com- Diocletian Window]&lt;/ref&gt; 3rd [[Earl of Burlington]], one of the originators of the [[Palladian architecture#English Palladian revival (neo-Palladian)|English Palladian style]], and by his followers.

Diocletian windows continued to be used occasionally in large public buildings in the various devolutions of [[neoclassical architecture]] including the [[Beaux Arts architecture|Beaux Arts movement]] (1880–1920).

The '''European Pulsar Timing Array''' ('''EPTA''') is a European collaboration to combine five 100-m class radio-telescopes to observe an array of [[pulsars]] with the specific goal of detecting [[gravitational waves]]. It is one of three pulsar timing array projects in operation, the others being the [[Parkes Pulsar Timing Array]] and the [[North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves]].

==Pulsars and high-precision timing==
[[Pulsars]] are rapidly rotating, highly magnetised [[neutron stars]] that emit radio waves from their magnetic poles that are, due to the star's rotation, observed on Earth as a string of pulses. Due to the extremely high density of neutron stars, their rotation periods are very stable, hence the observed arrival time of the pulses are highly regular. These arrival times are called TOAs (time of arrival) and can be used to perform high-precision timing experiments.

The stability of the TOAs from most pulsars is limited due to the presence of [[red noise]], also called "timing noise".&lt;ref&gt;Z. Arzoumanian, D.J. Nice, J.H. Taylor, and S.E. Thorsett. "[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-data_query?bibcode=1994ApJ...422..671A&amp;link_type=ARTICLE&amp;db_key=AST&amp;high= Timing behavior of 96 radio pulsars]." ''The Astrophysical Journal,'' volume 422, February 1994 (pages 671-680).&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is a special class of pulsars, called millisecond pulsars (MSP), that are shown to suffer from little or no timing noise.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Keeping track of the TOAs of different MSPs over the sky allows for a high-precision timing experiment to detect [[gravitational waves]].

==Detection of gravitational waves==
[[Gravitational waves]] (GW) are small disturbances in space-time, caused by the motion of masses, if the third time derivative of the mass quadrupole moment is non-zero. These waves are very weak, such that only the strongest waves, caused by the rapid motion of dense stars or black-holes, have a chance of being detected. A pulsar timing array (PTA) uses an array of MSPs as the endpoints of a Galaxy-scale [[Gravitational wave detector|GW detector]]. It is sensitive to GWs with a frequency in the nanohertz regime, which corresponds to the regime where the stochastic GW background, caused by the coalescence of super-massive black holes in the early Universe, is predicted to exist.{{citation needed|date = July 2013}} This makes PTAs complementary to other GW detectors such as [[LIGO]], [[Virgo interferometer|VIRGO]] and [[Laser Interferometer Space Antenna|LISA]].

==Telescopes==
The EPTA uses five European telescopes. These are the [[Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope]], the [[Effelsberg Radio Telescope]], the [[Lovell Telescope]], the [[Nançay Radio Telescope]] and the [[Sardinia Radio Telescope]].

==LEAP==
[[Image:European Pulsar Timing Array (logo).jpg|thumb|right|The LEAP logo.]]

Since 2009, the EPTA has made some progress thanks to a project [[European Research Council]] funded project known as the Large European Array for Pulsars (LEAP). The aim of this project is to coherently combine the five EPTA telescopes to synthesise the equivalent of a fully steerable 194-m dish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leap.eu.org/ The Large European Array for Pulsars]&lt;/ref&gt; This will improve the accuracy with which the pulsar TOAs can be measured by an order of magnitude, essential for the first detection of [[gravitational waves]] within the next decade.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

[[File:Arrilaser film recorder.jpg|thumb|Pair of Arrilaser film recorders]]
A '''film recorder''' is a [[graphical output device]] for transferring [[digital image]]s to [[photographic film]]. In a typical film recorder, an image is passed from a host computer to a mechanism to expose film through a variety of methods, historically by direct photography of a high-resolution [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT) display. The exposed film can then be developed using conventional developing techniques, and displayed with a slide or motion picture projector. The use of film recorders predates the current use of [[video projector|digital projectors]], which eliminate the time and cost involved in the intermediate step of transferring computer images to a separate display medium, instead directly displaying the image signal from a computer.

==Design==

===Operation===
All film recorders typically work in the same manner. The image is fed from a host computer as a raster stream over a digital interface. A film recorder exposes film through various mechanisms; flying spot (early recorders); photographing a high resolution video monitor; electron beam recorder ([[Sony HDVS]]); a CRT scanning dot (Celco); focused beam of light from a [[light valve]] technology (LVT) recorder; a scanning laser beam (Arrilaser); or recently, full-frame LCD array chips.

For [[color]] image recording on a CRT film recorder, the red, green, and blue channels are sequentially displayed on a single gray scale CRT, and exposed to the same piece of film as a [[multiple exposure]] through a [[filter (photography)|filter]] of the appropriate color. This approach yields better resolution and color quality than possible with a tri-phosphor color CRT. The three filters are usually mounted on a motor-driven wheel. The filter wheel, as well as the camera's [[shutter (photography)|shutter]], [[aperture]], and film motion mechanism are usually controlled by the recorder's electronics and/or the [[device driver|driving software]]. CRT film recorders are further divided into analog and digital types. The analog film recorder uses the native video signal from the computer, while the digital type uses a separate display board in the computer to produce a digital signal for a [[vector display]] in the recorder. Digital CRT recorders provide a higher resolution at a higher cost compared to analog recorders due to the additional specialized hardware.&lt;ref name=IW-890306&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GzoEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PT66&amp;pg=PT66#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Product Comparison: PC Film Recorders |author1=Capen, Tracey |author2=Douglas, Sally J. |page=51 |date=6 March 1989 |magazine=InfoWorld |accessdate=4 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical resolutions for digital recorders were quoted as 2K and 4K, referring to 2048×1366 and 4096×2732 pixels, respectively, while analog recorders provided a resolution of 640×428 pixels in comparison.&lt;ref name=PCM-890228&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9wwQdu9dei0C&amp;lpg=PA199&amp;pg=PA199#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=From Screen to Slide—Affordably |author=Fersko-Weiss, Henry |date=28 February 1989 |page=199 |magazine=PC Magazine |accessdate=4 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Higher-quality LVT film recorders use a focused beam of light to write the image directly onto a film loaded spinning drum, one pixel at a time. In one example, the light valve was a liquid-crystal shutter, the light beam was steered with a lens, and text was printed using a pre-cut optical mask.&lt;ref name=PCM-890228 /&gt; The LVT will record pixel beyond grain. Some machines can burn 120-res or 120 lines per millimeter. The LVT is basically a reverse [[drum scanner]]. The exposed film is developed and printed by regular photographic chemical processing.

===Formats===

Film recorders are available for a variety of film types and formats. The [[35mm film|35mm negative film]] and [[transparency (photography)|transparencies]] are popular because they can be processed by any photo shop. [[Large format|Single-image 4×5 film]] and 8×10 are often used for high-quality, large format printing.&lt;ref name=PCM-890228 /&gt;

Some models have detachable [[film holder]]s to handle multiple formats with the same camera or with Polaroid backs to provide on-site review of output before exposing film.&lt;ref name=PCM-890228 /&gt;

==Uses==

Film recorders are used in [[digital printing]] to generate master negatives for [[lithography|offset]] and other bulk [[printing]] processes. For preview, archiving, and small-volume reproduction, film recorders have been rendered obsolete by modern [[Computer printer|printer]]s that produce photographic-quality hardcopies directly on plain paper.

They are also used to produce the master copies of [[film|movie]]s that use [[computer animation]] or other [[special effect]]s based on [[digital image processing]].

===Computer graphics===
Film recorders were among the earliest [[computer graphics]] output devices; for example, the [[IBM 740]] CRT Recorder was announced in 1954.

Film recorders were also commonly used to produce [[photographic slide|slide]]s for [[slide projector]]s;&lt;ref name=IW-890306 /&gt; but this need is now largely met by [[video projector]]s that project images directly from a computer to a screen. The terms "[[presentation slide|slide]]" and "slide deck" are still commonly used in [[presentation program]]s.

===Current uses===
Currently, film recorders are primarily used in the motion picture [[film-out]] process for the ever increasing amount of [[digital intermediate]] work being done.  Although significant advances in large venue video projection alleviates the need to output to film, there remains a deadlock between the motion picture studios and theater owners over who should pay for the cost of these very costly projection systems.  This, combined with the increase in international and independent film production, will keep the demand for film recording steady for at least a decade.

==Key manufacturers==

Traditional film recorder manufacturers have all but vanished from the scene or have evolved their product lines to cater to the motion picture industry.  [[Dicomed]] was one such early provider of digital color film recorders. 
[[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]], Management Graphics, Inc, MacDonald-Detwiler, [[Information International, Inc.]], and [[Agfa]] were other producers of film recorders.

*[[Kodak]] Lightning I film recorder. One of the first laser recorders. Needed an engineering staff to set up.
*Kodak Lightning II film recorder used both gas and diode laser to record on to film.
*The last LVT machines produced by Kodak / Durst-Dice stopped production in 2002. There are no LVT film recorders currently being produced. LVT Saturn 1010 uses a LED exposure (RGB) to 8"x10" film at 1000-3000ppi.
* LUX Laser Cinema Recorder from Autologic/Information International in [[Thousand Oaks]], [[California]]. Sales end in March 2000. Used on the 1997 film [[Titanic (1997 film)|“Titanic”]].
*[[Arri]] produces the [[Arrilaser]] line of laser-based motion picture film recorders.
*[[Celco]] makes a line of CRT based motion picture film recorders.
*Lasergraphics is a recent entrant into the cine film recorder market with its twenty-year history in the traditional film recorder business.
*[[CCG Digital Image Technology|CCG]], formerly [[Agfa]] film recorders, has been a steady manufacturer of film recorders based in Germany.
*In 2004 CCG introduced [[Definity (film recorder)|Definity]], a motion picture film recorder utilizing LCD technology.  In 2010 CCG introduced the first full LED LCD film recorder as a new step in film recording.

It can record [[Color motion picture film|IN]], [[List of motion picture film stocks#Intermediate film|IP]] and [[35 mm film|prints]] with and without [[Sound-on-film|sound]]
*[[Oxberry (company)|Oxberry]] produced the Model 3100 film recorder camera system, with interchangeable pin-registered movements (shuttles) for 35mm (full frame/Silent, 1.33:1) and 16mm (regular 16, "2R"), and others have adapted the Oxberry movements for [[Cinemascope|CinemaScope]], 1.85:1, 1.75:1, 1.66:1, as well as Academy/Sound (1.37:1) in 35mm and Super-16 in 16mm ("1R"). For instance, the "Solitaire" and numerous others employed the Oxberry 3100 camera system.

==History==

Before video tape recorders or  [[VTR]]s were invented, TV shows were either broadcast live or recorded to film for later showing, using the [[Kinescope]] process. In 1967 CBS Laboratories introduced the [[Electronic Video Recording]] format, which used video and telecined-to-video film sources, which were then recorded with an electron-beam recorder at CBS' EVR mastering plant at the time to 35mm film stock in a rank of 4 strips on the film, which was then slit down to 4 {{convert|8.75|mm|abbr=on}} film copies, for playback in an EVR player.

All types of CRT recorders were (and still are) used for film recording. Some early examples used for computer-output recording were the 1954 [[IBM 740]] CRT Recorder, and the 1962 [[Stromberg-Carlson]] SC-4020, the latter using a [[Charactron]] CRT for text and vector graphic output to either 16mm motion picture film, 16mm microfilm, or hard-copy paper output. 

Later 1970 and 80s-era recording to B&amp;W (and color, with 3 separate exposures for red, green, and blue)) 16mm film was done with an EBR (Electron Beam Recorder), the most prominent examples made by [[3M]]), for both video and COM ([[Microform|Computer Output Microfilm]]) applications. [[Image Transform]] in [[Universal City, California]] used specially modified 3M EBR film recorders that could perform color [[film-out]] recording on 16mm by exposing three 16mm frames in a row (one red, one green and one blue). The film was then printed to color 16mm or 35mm film.  The video fed to the recorder could either be [[NTSC]], [[PAL]] or [[SECAM]]. Later, Image Transform used specially modified VTRs to record 24 frame for their "Image Vision" system. The modified [[1 inch type B videotape]] VTRs would record and play back 24frame video at 10&amp;nbsp;MHz bandwidth, at about twice the normal [[NTSC]] resolution. Modified 24fps 10&amp;nbsp;MHz Bosch [[Fernseh]] KCK-40 cameras were used on the set. This was a custom pre-[[HDTV]] video system. Image Transform had modified other gear for this process.  At its peak, this system was used in the production of the film "[[Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl]]" in 1982.  This was the first major pre-[[digital intermediate]] [[post production]] using a film recorder for film-out production.

In 1988, companies in the United States collectively produced 715&amp;nbsp;million slides at a cost of $8.3&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name=PCM-890228 /&gt;

===Awards===
The [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] awarded an [[Academy Award|Oscar]] to the makers of the Arrilaser film recorder. The Award of Merit Oscar from the [[Academy Scientific and Technical Award]] ceremony was given on 11 February 2012 to Franz Kraus, Johannes Steurer and Wolfgang Riedel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://www.fraunhofer.de/en/press/research-news/2012/january/technical_oscar_forarriandfraunhofer-pressreleasejanuary272012.html |title=Technical Oscar for ARRI and Fraunhofer |author= |date=27 January 2012 |publisher=Fraunhofer Institute for Physical Measurement Techniques |accessdate=4 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://phys.org/news/2012-01-oscar.html |title=Developers of film recorder to receive Oscar |author= |agency=Associated Press |date=6 January 2012 |publisher=Phys.org |accessdate=4 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steurer was awarded the [[Oskar Messter]] Memorial Medal two years later in 2014 for his role in the development of the Arrilaser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.arri.com/corporate/press/english/english_single/johannes-steurer-receives-oskar-messter-medal/7581/ |title=Johannes Steurer receives Oskar Messter Medal |author= |date=14 May 2014 |publisher=Arri |accessdate=4 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''flexibility–usability tradeoff''' is a [[design elements and principles|design principle]] maintaining that, as the [[flexibility (engineering)|flexibility]] of a system increases, its [[usability]] decreases. The tradeoff exists because accommodating flexibility requires satisfying a larger set of requirements, which results in complexity and usability compromises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steinebach|first=Gerhard, and Subhrajit Guhathakurta, Hans Hagen|title=Visualizing Sustainable Planning|year=2009|publisher=Springer|isbn=3540882022|pages=256|url=https://www.amazon.com/Visualizing-Sustainable-Planning-X-media-publishing-Steinebach/dp/3540882022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Design theory maintains that over their lifecycle, systems shift from supporting multiple uses inefficiently, towards efficiently supporting a single use as users' needs become more defined and better understood, both by themselves and designers.

When weighting the relative importance of flexibility versus usability, designers are advised to consider how well the needs of the user are understood. If user needs are well understood, designers should bias toward simple less-flexible systems. Otherwise, designers should create flexible designs that support multiple future applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lidwell|first=William, and Kritina Holden, Jill Butler|title=Universal Principles of Design, Revised and Updated: 125 Ways to Enhance Usability, Influence Perception, Increase Appeal, Make Better Design Decisions, and Teach through Design|year=2010|publisher=Rockport Publishers|location=London|isbn=1592535879|pages=102–103|url=https://www.amazon.com/Universal-Principles-Design-Revised-Updated/dp/1592535879}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Forensic facial reconstruction''' (or '''forensic facial approximation''') is the process of recreating the face of an individual (whose identity is often not known) from their [[skeletal]] remains through an amalgamation of artistry, [[anthropology]], [[osteology]], and [[anatomy]].  It is easily the most subjective—as well as one of the most controversial—techniques in the field of [[forensic anthropology]].  Despite this controversy, facial reconstruction has proved successful frequently enough that research and methodological developments continue to be advanced.

In addition to remains involved in criminal investigations, facial reconstructions are created for remains believed to be of historical value and for remains of [[prehistoric]] [[hominids]] and [[human]]s.

== Types of identification==
There are two forms pertaining to [[forensic identification|identification]] in [[forensic anthropology]]: '''circumstantial''' and '''positive'''.&lt;ref name=Burns&gt;Burns. ''Forensic Anthropology Training Manual.''&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Circumstantial identification''' is established when an individual fits the biological profile of a set of skeletal or largely skeletal remains.  This type of identification does not prove or verify identity because any number of individuals may fit the same biological description.
*'''Positive identification''', one of the foremost goals of forensic science, is established when a unique set of biological characteristics of an individual are matched with a set of skeletal remains.  This type of identification requires the skeletal remains to correspond with medical or dental records, unique ante mortem wounds or pathologies, [[DNA]] analysis, and still other means.&lt;ref&gt;Reichs and Craig. ''Facial Approximation: Procedures and Pitfalls.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Facial reconstruction presents investigators and family members involved in criminal cases concerning unidentified remains with a unique alternative when all other identification techniques have failed.&lt;ref name="Reichs" /&gt;  Facial approximations often provide the stimuli that eventually lead to the positive identification of remains.

== Legal admissibility ==
In the U.S., the [[Daubert Standard]] is a legal precedent set in 1993 by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] regarding the admissibility of [[expert witness]] [[testimony]] during legal proceedings, set in place to ensure that expert testimony is based on sufficient facts or data, derived from proper application of reliable principles and methods.&lt;ref name=Steadman&gt;Steadman&lt;/ref&gt; When multiple [[forensic]] artists produce approximations for the same set of skeletal remains, no two reconstructions are ever the same and the data from which approximations are created are largely incomplete.&lt;ref&gt;Helmer et al. ''Assessment of the Reliability of Facial Reconstruction.''&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, forensic facial reconstruction does not uphold the [[Daubert Standard]], is not considered a legally recognized technique for positive identification, and is not admissible as expert testimony. Currently, reconstructions are only produced to aid the process of positive identification in conjunction with verified methods.

== Types of reconstructions ==

=== Two-dimensional reconstructions ===
[[File:2D facial reconstruction.jpg|thumb|An example of a 2D facial reconstruction conducted by forensic artist Karen T. Taylor, and the subsequent identification, [[Murder of April Lacy|April Dawn Lacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Riggs|first1=Robert|title=Robert Riggs Reports Forensic Artist Reconstructs Victims Faces May 2004|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0o70ltA64lI|accessdate=13 January 2015|date=11 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Forensic facial reconstruction of Alberto di Trento.jpg|thumb|Forensic facial reconstruction of [[Alberto di Trento]] by Arc-Team and the 3D artist Cicero Moraes]]

Two-dimensional facial reconstructions are based on ante mortem [[photograph]]s, and the [[human skull|skull]].  Occasionally skull radiographs are used but this is not ideal since many cranial structures are not visible or at the correct scale. This method usually requires the collaboration of an artist and a [[forensic anthropologist]].  A commonly used method of 2D facial reconstruction was pioneered by [[Karen T. Taylor]] of Austin, Texas during the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Dowling, Paul. "Saving Face." Forensic Files. Prod. Paul Bourdett and Vince Sherry. Dir. Michael Jordan. 28 Nov. 2007. Television.&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor's method involves adhering tissue depth markers on an unidentified skull at various anthropological landmarks, then photographing the skull.  Life-size or one-to-one frontal and lateral photographic prints are then used as a foundation for facial drawings done on transparent vellum.  Recently developed, the F.A.C.E. and C.A.R.E.S. computer software programs quickly produce two-dimensional facial approximations that can be edited and manipulated with relative ease.  These programs may help speed the reconstruction process and allow subtle variations to be applied to the drawing, though they may produce more generic images than hand-drawn artwork.&lt;ref name=Reichs&gt;Reichs and Craig&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Three-dimensional reconstructions ===
Three-dimensional facial reconstructions are either: 1) sculptures (made from casts of [[Human cranium|cranial]] remains) created with modeling clay and other materials or 2) high-resolution, [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional computer images]].  Like two-dimensional reconstructions, three-dimensional reconstructions usually require both an artist and a [[forensic anthropologist]].  Computer programs create three-dimensional reconstructions by manipulating scanned [[photograph]]s of the unidentified cranial remains, [[stock photography|stock photographs]] of facial features, and other available reconstructions. These computer approximations are usually most effective in victim identification because they do not appear too artificial.&lt;ref name="Reichs" /&gt; This method has been adapted by the [[National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children]], which uses this method often to show approximations of an [[unidentified decedent]] to release to the public in hopes to identify the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Unidentified murder victim a 'total nightmare' case for detectives| url=http://www.fdlreporter.com/article/20130804/FON019804/308040064/Unidentified-murder-victim-total-nightmare-case-detectives| accessdate=9 July 2015| first=Adam| last=Rodewald| date=5 August 2013| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714184728/http://www.fdlreporter.com/article/20130804/FON019804/308040064/Unidentified-murder-victim-total-nightmare-case-detectives| archivedate=14 July 2015| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Superimposition ===
[[Superimposition]] is a technique that is sometimes included among the methods of forensic facial reconstruction.  It is not always included as a technique because investigators must already have some kind of knowledge about the identity of the skeletal remains with which they are dealing (as opposed to 2D and 3D reconstructions, when the identity of the skeletal remains are generally completely unknown).  Forensic [[superimposition]]s are created by superimposing a photograph of an individual suspected of belonging to the unidentified skeletal remains over an [[X-ray]] of the unidentified [[human skull|skull]].  If the skull and the photograph are of the same individual, then the anatomical features of the face should align accurately.&lt;ref name=Lundy&gt;Lundy. ''Physical Anthropology In Forensic Medicine''&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Hermann Welcker]] in 1883 and [[Wilhelm His, Sr.]] in 1895, were the first to reproduce three-dimensional facial approximations from [[Human cranium|cranial]] remains.&lt;ref&gt;Forensic Facial Reconstruction: The Final Frontier&lt;/ref&gt;  Most sources, however, acknowledge His as the forerunner in advancing the technique.  His also produced the first data on average facial [[Biological tissue|tissue]] thickness followed by Kollmann and Buchly who later collected additional data and compiled tables that are still referenced in most laboratories working on facial reproductions today.&lt;ref name=Rhine&gt;Rhine. ''Facial Reproductions In Court.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Facial reconstruction originated in two of the four major subfields of [[anthropology]].  In [[biological anthropology]], they were used to approximate the appearance of early [[Hominidae|hominid]] forms, while in [[archaeology]] they were used to validate the remains of historic figures.  In 1964, [[Mikhail Mikhaylovich Gerasimov|Mikhail Gerasimov]] was probably the first to attempt paleo-anthropological facial reconstruction to estimate the appearance of ancient peoples&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Iscan. ''Craniofacial Image Analysis and Reconstruction.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Although students of Gerasimov later used his techniques to aid in criminal investigations, it was [[Wilton M Krogman|Wilton M. Krogman]] who popularized facial reconstruction's application to the [[forensic]] field.  [[Wilton M Krogman|Krogman]] presented his method for facial reconstruction in his 1962 book, detailing his method for approximation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  Others who helped popularize three-dimensional facial reconstruction include Cherry (1977), Angel (1977), Gatliff (1984), Snow (1979), and Iscan (1986).&lt;ref name="Reichs" /&gt;

In 2004 it was for Dr. Andrew Nelson of the [[University of Western Ontario]], Department of Anthropology that noted Canadian artist [[Christian Corbet]] created the first forensic facial reconstruction of an approximately 2,200-year-old mummy based on CT and laser scans. This reconstruction is known as the Sulman Mummy project.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

== Technique for creating a three-dimensional clay reconstruction ==
[[File:Skulls_for_Facial_Approximation.jpg|thumb|Skulls for Facial Approximation]]

Because a standard method for creating [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] forensic facial reconstructions has not been widely agreed upon, multiple methods and techniques are used.  The process detailed below reflects the method presented by Taylor and Angel from their chapter in Craniofacial Identification in Forensic Medicine, pgs 177-185.&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;Taylor and Angel. ''Facial Reconstruction and Approximation.''&lt;/ref&gt; This method assumes that the sex, age, and race of the remains to undergo facial reconstruction have already been determined through traditional [[forensic]] [[anthropological]] techniques.

The [[human skull|skull]] is the basis of facial reconstruction; however, other physical remains that are sometimes available often prove to be valuable.  Occasionally, remnants of [[soft tissue]] are found on a set of remains.  Through close inspection, the forensic artist can easily approximate the thickness of the soft tissue over the remaining areas of the skull based on the presence of these tissues.  This eliminates one of the most difficult aspects of reconstruction, the estimation of tissue thickness.  Additionally, any other bodily or physical evidence found in association with remains (e.g. jewelry, hair, glasses, etc.) are vital to the final stages of reconstruction because they directly reflect the appearance of the individual in question.

[[File:Steps of forensic facial reconstruction - Virtual Mummy - cogitas3d.gif|left|thumb|Steps of forensic facial reconstruction of a [[mummy]]]]

Most commonly, however, only the bony skull and minimal or no other soft tissues are present on the remains presented to forensic artists.  In this case, a thorough examination of the skull is completed.  This examination focuses on, but is not limited to, the identification of any bony pathologies or unusual landmarks, ruggedness of [[muscle]] attachments, profile of the [[Human mandible|mandible]], symmetry of the [[nasal bone]]s, [[dentition]], and wear of the occlusal surfaces.  All of these features have an effect on the appearance of an individual's face.

Once the examination is complete, the skull is cleaned and any damaged or fragmented areas are repaired with wax. The mandible is then reattached, again with wax, according to the alignment of teeth, or, if no teeth are present, by averaging the vertical dimensions between the mandible and [[maxilla]].  Undercuts (like the nasal openings) are filled in with modeling clay and [[prosthetic]] eyes are inserted into the orbits centered between the superior and inferior [[orbit (anatomy)|orbital]] rims.  At this point, a plaster cast of the skull is prepared.  Extensive detail of the preparation of such a cast is presented in the article from which these methods are presented.

After the cast is set, colored plastics or the colored ends of safety matches are attached at twenty-one specific "landmark" areas that correspond to the reference data.  These sites represent the average facial [[Biological tissue|tissue]] thickness for persons of the same sex, race, and age as that of the remains.  From this point on, all features are added using modeling clay.

First, the [[facial]] [[muscle]]s are layered onto the cast in the following order: temporalis, masseter, buccinator and occipito-frontals, and finally the soft tissues of the neck.  Next, the nose and lips are reconstructed before any of the other muscles are formed.  The lips are approximately as wide as the interpupillary distance.  However, this distance varies significantly with age, sex, race, and occlusion.  The nose is one of the most difficult facial features to reconstruct because the underlying [[bone]] is limited and the possibility of variation is expansive.  The nasal profile is constructed by first measuring the width of the nasal aperture and the nasal spine.  Using a calculation of three times the length of the spine plus the depth of tissue marker number five will yield the approximate nose length.  Next, the pitch of the nose is determined by examining the direction of the nasal spine - down, flat, or up.  A block of clay that is the proper length is then placed on the nasal spine and the remaining nasal tissue is filled in using tissue markers two and three as a guide for the bridge of the nose.  The [[Nasalis muscle|alae]] are created by first marking a point five millimeters below the bottom of the nasal aperture.  After the main part of the nose is constructed, the alae are created as small egg-shaped balls of clay, that are five millimeters in diameter at the widest point, these are positioned on the sides of the nose corresponding with the mark made previously.  The alae are then blended to the nose and the overall structure of the nose is rounded out and shaped appropriately.

The muscles of facial expression and the soft tissue around the eyes are added next.  Additional measurements are made according to race (especially for those with eye folds characteristic of Asian descent) during this stage.  Next, tissues are built up to within one millimeter of the tissue thickness markers and the ears (noted as being extremely complicated to reproduce) are added.  Finally, the face is "fleshed," meaning clay is added until the tissue thickness markers are covered, and any specific characterization is added (for example, hair, wrinkles in the skin, noted racial traits, glasses, etc.). The skull of Mozart was the basis of his facial reconstruction from anthropological data. The bust was unveiled at the "Salon du Son", Paris, in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Forensic scientists uncovering Mozart | pmc=1293314 | pmid=2061918 | volume=84 | issue=6 | year=1991 | journal=J R Soc Med | pages=387 | author=Puech PF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Forensic scientists uncovering Mozart | pmc=1293314 | pmid=2061918 | volume=84 | issue=6 | year=1991 | journal=J R Soc Med | pages=387 | author=Puech PF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Problems with facial reconstruction ==
There are multiple outstanding problems associated with forensic facial reconstruction.&lt;ref name=Lebedinskaya&gt;Lebedinskaya et al. ''Principles of Facial Reconstruction.''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Insufficient tissue thickness data ===
[[File:Gail Mathews.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction and actual photograph of [[Gary Ridgway|Green River victim]] Gail Mathews. The victim had distinctive lips, which could not be represented in the reconstruction, as her body was decomposed.]]
[[File:Durham, Ontario Jane Doe facial reconstructions.jpg|left|thumb|In many cases, the subject's hairstyle is unknown, which causes an artist to guess possible solutions, such as this unidentified woman found in Ontario, Canada.]]

The most pressing issue relates to the data used to average facial [[Biological tissue|tissue]] thickness.  The data available to forensic artists are still very limited in ranges of ages, sexes, and body builds.  This disparity greatly affects the accuracy of reconstructions.  Until this data is expanded, the likelihood of producing the most accurate reconstruction possible is largely limited.&lt;ref name=Rathbun&gt;Rathbun. ''Personal Identification: Facial Reproductions.''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lack of methodological standardization ===
A second problem is the lack of a methodological standardization in approximating facial features.&lt;ref name="Reichs" /&gt; A single, official method for reconstructing the face has yet to be recognized.  This also presents major setback in facial approximation because facial features like the eyes and nose and individuating characteristics like hairstyle - the features most likely to be recalled by witnesses - lack a standard way of being reconstructed.  Recent research on [[computational forensics|computer-assisted methods]], which take advantage of digital image processing, pattern recognition, promises to overcome current limitations in facial reconstruction and linkage.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

=== Subjectivity ===
Reconstructions only reveal the type of face a person ''may'' have exhibited because of artistic subjectivity.  The position and general shape of the main facial features are mostly accurate because they are greatly determined by the skull.&lt;ref name=Helmer&gt;Helmer et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
[[Image:National Geographic - King Tut face.jpg|thumb|The facial reconstruction of [[Tutankhamun]] as shown on the cover of ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' in 2005.]]

In recent years, the presence of forensic facial reconstructions in the [[entertainment industry]] and the [[Mass media|media]] has increased.{{Or|date=November 2008}}  The way the fictional criminal investigators and forensic anthropologists utilize forensics and facial reconstructions are, however, often misrepresented{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} (an influence known as the "[[CSI effect]]").{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}  For example, the fictional forensic investigators will often call for the creation of a facial reconstruction as soon as a set of skeletal remains is discovered. In many instances, facial reconstructions have been used as a last resort to stimulate the possibility of identifying an individual.&lt;ref&gt;''Studies in Crime: An Introduction to Forensic Archaeology'' {{ISBN|0-415-16612-8}} p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; 

Facial reconstruction has been featured as part of an array of forensic science methods in fictional TV shows like ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'' and ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'' and their respective spinoffs in the [[CSI (franchise)|''CSI'']] and [[NCIS (franchise)|''NCIS'']] franchises.

In ''[[Bones (TV series)|Bones]]'', a long-running TV series centered around forensic analysis of decomposed and skeletal human remains, facial reconstruction is featured in the majority of episodes, used much like a police artist sketch in police procedurals. Regular cast character Angela Montenegro, the Bones team's facial reconstruction specialist, employs 3D software and holographic projection to "give victims back their faces" (as noted in the episode, "A Boy in a Bush").

In the ''[[MacGyver (1985 TV series)|MacGyver]]'' episode "The Secret Of Parker House", MacGyver reconstructs the skull of Penny's aunt Betty while investigating her house.

The facial reconstruction of Egypt's [[Tutankhamun]], popularly known as King Tut, made the June 2005 cover of [[National Geographic Magazine]].

A variety of facial reconstruction kits toys are available, with "crime scene" versions, also, reconstructions of famous historical figures, like King Tut and the dinosaur [[T-Rex]].&lt;ref&gt;Several kits from various manufacturers are currently available, others have come and gone over the past decade or so, as evidenced by a Web search for "facial reconstruction kit." Several current models are [https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dtoys-and-games&amp;field-keywords=facial%20reconstruction at amazon.com.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, facial reconstruction has been part of the process used by researchers attempting to identify human remains of two Canadian Army soldiers lost in [[World War I]]. One soldier was identified through DNA analysis in 2007, but due to DNA deterioration, identifying the second using the same techniques failed. In 2011, the second of the soldiers' remains discovered at [[Avion, Pas-de-Calais|Avion]], [[France]] were identified through a combination of 3-D printing software, reconstructive sculpture and use of isotopic analysis of bone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thetelegram.com/News/Local/2011-06-04/article-2558929/Where-science-meets-art/1|title=Where science meets art|last=Baird|first=Moira|date=June 4, 2011|work=The Telegram|publisher=Transcontinental Media|accessdate=23 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Quiring03222011"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.villagegamer.net/2011/03/22/3d-printing-technology-helped-identify-canadian-ww1-soldier/|title=3D Printing Technology Helped Identify Canadian WW1 Soldier|last=Quiring|first=Tami|date=March 22, 2011|work=Village Gamer|accessdate=23 June 2012|location=Aldergrove, British Columbia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Glittering Images: A Journey Through Art from Egypt to Star Wars''''' is a 2012 book by American cultural critic [[Camille Paglia]], in which the author discusses notable works of [[Applied arts|applied]] and [[Visual arts|visual art]] from ancient to modern times. Paglia wrote that she intended it to be a personalized "journey" through [[art history]], focusing on [[Western world|Western]] works. Paglia writes that she felt inspired to write given that she worries 21st century Americans are overexposed to visual stimulation by the "all-pervasive mass media" and must fight to keep their capacity for [[contemplation]].&lt;ref name="on-art"/&gt;

The book features twenty-nine sections, with glossy full-color illustrations, each focused on a specific piece.&lt;ref name=WSJ1/&gt; Artists detailed include [[Titian]], [[Manet]], [[Picasso]], and [[Jackson Pollock]] among others. After its October 16, 2012 release, the book received positive reviews from publications such as ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'',&lt;ref name=WSJ1/&gt;&lt;ref name=inquirer&gt;{{cite news|last=Derakhshani|first=Tirdad|title=Camille Paglia hopes to reignite regular folks' interest in the arts|url=http://articles.philly.com/2012-10-17/entertainment/34500629_1_camille-paglia-sexual-personae-western-art|date=October 17, 2012|publisher=''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]''|accessdate=July 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; while it also picked up more critical, negative reviews from publications such as ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]''.&lt;ref name="on-art"/&gt;

==Summary==
[[File:Charioteer of Delphi-2.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Paglia discusses the [[Charioteer of Delphi]], a notable [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] work.&lt;ref name=delphi/&gt;]]

While touching on the themes of Paglia's previous work, ''Glittering Images'' focuses on modern cultural [[ignorance]].&lt;ref name=WSJ1/&gt; Paglia wrote what she intended as a personalized "journey" through art history since she believes people today have become visually overexposed by the mass-media and disconnected from the past.&lt;ref name="on-art"/&gt; In it, she argues, "the eye is assaulted, coerced, desensitized."&lt;ref name=WSJ1/&gt;

Paglia discusses twenty-nine examples of visual artwork. Paglia begins by describing the [[ancient Egypt]]ian funerary images of [[Nefertari (18th dynasty)|Queen Nefertari]],&lt;ref name="on-art"/&gt; a royal whose name means "the most beautiful of them all". Paglia refers to how the civilization "dreamed of conquering the terrors of death", and she notes how "Egyptian painted figures float in an abstract space that is neither here nor there", describing the visual power of this "eternal present" depicted.&lt;ref&gt;''Glittering Images'', pp.3-5&lt;/ref&gt; She then turns to the [[Cycladic civilization|Cycladic]] statuettes carved by [[Bronze Age]] residents of several [[Aegean Sea]] islands, which feature "coolly geometric" designs unlike that of the voluptuous figures carved by earlier, [[Stone Age]] people (such as the '[[Venus of Willendorf]]') while still displaying [[vulva]]e markings and prominent breasts that convey femininity. These pieces of [[Cycladic art]] are cited as "daring explorations of form and structure" foreshadowing the future.&lt;ref&gt;''Glittering Images'', pp.11-13&lt;/ref&gt;

The author then describes the '[[Charioteer of Delphi]]', a work from the fifth century BC that she writes embodies well the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] ideals of "young male beauty" and the building of character through personal striving. She states how she finds the chariot racing athlete "grave and dignified" with his meditative expression, giving a "look that would become canonical for gods and heroes in the classic tradition".&lt;ref name=delphi&gt;''Glittering Images'', pp.15-18&lt;/ref&gt; She goes on to write about the '[[Erechtheion#The Porch of the Caryatids|Porch of the Maidens]]' in the [[Erechtheion]] in [[Athens, Greece]], with columns carved into feminine shapes that she labels as "a remarkable display of female power" as "muscular strength" co-exists with womanly curves,&lt;ref&gt;''Glittering Images'', pp.21&lt;/ref&gt; and then the piece '[[Laocoön and His Sons]]', a violent scene carved in marble in which [[sea serpent]]s attempt to slay a man and his three sons that stridently addresses the problem of [[theodicy]].&lt;ref&gt;''Glittering Images'', pp.27&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:KellsFol007vMadonnaChild V2.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Paglia praises the intricacy of the [[Book of Kells]], the section devoted to [[Virgin Mary]] pictured here.&lt;ref name=kells/&gt;]]

The book goes on next to the famous [[mosaic]] of [[Saint John Chrysostom]] in the [[Hagia Sophia]], a piece that Paglia writes as having an "implacable intensity of gaze" making it a great piece of [[Byzantine art]],&lt;ref&gt;''Glittering Images'', pp.36-37&lt;/ref&gt; and additionally to the late eighth century Ireland's [[Book of Kells]], an "intricately decorated manuscript of the Gospels that is one of the most beautiful objects surviving from medieval Europe."&lt;ref name=kells&gt;''Glittering Images'', pp.39&lt;/ref&gt; The eight piece included is [[Donatello]]'s '[[Mary Magdalene (Donatello)|Mary Magdalene]]', a work of the [[Italian Renaissance]] created in 1453 that showed the artist's ability to be "harsh and imposing".&lt;ref&gt;''Glittering Images'', pp.43&lt;/ref&gt; Paglia then discusses [[Titian]]'s '[[Venus with a Mirror]]'; she writes about the artistic changes it symbolizes as the strong brushwork and liberal use of paint allow for warm flesh tones, Titian creating "opulent nudes that thrust sexual display and fantasy" onto the viewer.&lt;ref&gt;''Glittering Images'', pp.49&lt;/ref&gt;

Paglia next discusses [[Bronzino]]'s 'Portrait of Andrea Doria as Neptune', writing that as a work of the [[Mannerism]] movement it shows a "polished theatricality" arresting to the viewer,&lt;ref&gt;''Glittering Images'', pp.53&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]]'s '[[Chair of Saint Peter]]' in the [[Vatican City]], a 17th-century work showing how [[Baroque art]] often "overwhelms the senses with flamboyant grandeur".&lt;ref&gt;''Glittering Images'', pp.59&lt;/ref&gt;

She takes a nuanced view of the lasting influence of [[pop art]], writing that, generally, the artistic movement "projects an innocent child’s view of the world."&lt;ref name="on-art"/&gt; She also argues that works by artists such as [[Andy Warhol]], whom she praises, conveyed powerful subtleties with their pieces. The book details '[[Marilyn Diptych]]', a 1962 silkscreen that replicates a photo of [[Marilyn Monroe]] over and over with image variations, and the work is lauded for strongly showing the "multiplicity of meanings" in the actress' life and legacy.&lt;ref name=WSJ1/&gt;

The book additionally cites [[Eleanor Antin]]'s [[conceptual art]] project '100 Boots'. Paglia praises the work, writing that "boots, like their creator, are outsiders, eternal migrants questing for knowledge and experience."&lt;ref name=roth/&gt;

==Reception==
Writer John Adams of ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' published a critical review of the book, viewing it as being "so agenda driven and so riddled with polemic asides that its potential to persuade is forever being compromised." Adams noted that the book avoided discussions of [[Giotto]], [[Michelangelo]], [[El Greco]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Johannes Vermeer|Vermeer]], and [[Vincent van Gogh|van Gogh]], which he criticized. He supported how Paglia "encourages us to read more closely and to look more imaginatively" at the world of [[art history]], though concluded that her praise of [[George Lucas]] was assessing art "by its reach rather than its depth", and thus Paglia "has journeyed to the wrong continent, and what she has found glittering there is fool's gold."&lt;ref name="on-art"&gt;{{cite news|last=Adams|first=John|title=Paglia on Art|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/02/books/review/glittering-images-by-camille-paglia.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|date=November 30, 2012|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|accessdate=July 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalist Gary Rosen of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', however, praised the book's "impressive range" and accessibility for a general audience. He argued that "[f]or the most part, Ms. Paglia chooses well, from works both celebrated and obscure", and he stated that the author "is especially good at the difficult trick of providing context for the newcomer to art history without being tedious for a more experienced reader."&lt;ref name=WSJ1&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosen|first=Gary|title=The Pagan Aesthetic|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10000872396390443675404578058504002593338|publisher=''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''|accessdate=July 17, 2014|date=October 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' ran a supportive article that labeled the book a "magisterial, poetically composed, and masterly study".&lt;ref name=inquirer/&gt;

The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' published a supportive review by [[Michael S. Roth]], an author and the president of [[Wesleyan University]]. He wrote, "Artists, questing outsiders, are still with us, still finding their way, making their way. Perhaps some of them will be inspired by the glittering images Camille Paglia offers here."&lt;ref name=roth&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Michael S.

'''''I quattro libri dell'architettura''''' (''The Four Books of Architecture'') is a treatise on [[architecture]] by the architect [[Andrea Palladio]] (1508–1580), written in [[Italian language|Italian]].  It was first published in four [[volume]]s in 1570 in [[Venice]], illustrated with woodcuts after the author's own drawings. It has been reprinted and translated many times, often in single-volume format.

Book I was first published in English in 1663 in a London edition by Godfrey Richards. The first complete English language edition was published in London by the Italian-born architect [[Giacomo Leoni]] in 1715-1720.&lt;ref&gt;The Center for Palladian Studies in America, Inc., "Palladio and his Books." http://www.palladiancenter.org/palladiobooks.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization ==

The treatise is divided into four books:

The First book discusses building materials and techniques.  It documents five [[classical order]]s (Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, composite) in all their parts (bases, columns, architraves, arches, capitals, trabeations), as well as discussing other building elements (vaulted ceilings, floors, doors and windows, fireplaces, roofs and stairs).

The Second book covers the designs of private urban townhouses and country villas of the 1500s, in and around Venice, almost all designed by Palladio himself.  This includes nine palazzi, 22 villas (13 of them completed, another 5 partly completed), and a series of unrealized projects.  The plates of completed projects sometimes differ from the buildings as actually constructed.

The Third book addresses matters of city planning:  streets, stone street paving, bridges of both stone and wood, and piazzas, with examples drawn from Roman origins alongside contemporary examples; also basilicas, including the basilica designed by [[Vitruvius]] in [[Fano]] and the important [[Basilica Palladiana]] in Vicenza.

The Fourth book contains five chapters of general introduction, then 26 chapters, each of which describe the designs of specific Roman temples dating from antiquity, along with one contemporary church design.  (The exception is the [[San Pietro in Montorio]], designed by [[Donato Bramante]], consecrated in the year 1500.)  Palladio's selections range geographically from Rome, Naples, Spoleto, Assisi, Pola and Nîmes.  Illustrations of the temples include careful measurements of existing building elements, together with Palladio's own conjectural interpretations of the temple's facades where only fragments remained, as at the [[Temple of Trajan]].

The 26 temples discussed in include:

==Author==
Palladio founded an architectural movement which takes its name from him, [[Palladian architecture]]. ''I quattro libri dell'architettura'' contains Palladio's own designs celebrating the purity and simplicity of [[classical architecture]]. Some of these ideas had gotten no further than the drawing board while others, for example [[villa]] plans, had been successfully built. The book's clarity inspired numerous [[patron]]s and other architects.  Palladian architecture grew in popularity across [[Europe]] and, by the end of the 18th century, had extended as far as [[North America]]. [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[President of the United States]], was a keen admirer of Palladio and once referred to the book as "the Bible". ''The Four Books'' was used to inform his own work as the architect of [[Monticello]] and the [[University of Virginia]] and also architect William Buckland's at the 1774 Hammond-Harwood House in Annapolis, Maryland.

Palladio drew inspiration from surviving Roman buildings, Roman authors (especially the architect [[Vitruvius]]) and Italian Renaissance architects.  However, ''The Four Books of Architecture'' provided [[:wikt:systematic|systematic]] rules and plans for buildings which were creative and unique. Palladio's villa style is based on details applied to a structural system built of bricks. He offers two types of general rules in the corpus: design rules (those based on appearance) and construction rules (those based on the logic of villa construction). Here rules of the two types are identified in sets from which subsets of identifiers and rules can be written.

Each of the nine rule-sets contains many sub-identities of components and procedures for physical construction. A rule-set such as “Walls”, that identifies five sub-rules based on wall thickness, only needs construction rules; there is no need for rules based on style. In contrast, rules for “Frames” are based on a geometric style of curves and shape proportions.

{{rquote|right|The fundamental error of modern times lies in the fact that the '''yawning abyss of quality in the difference between God and man''' has been removed. The result in dogmatic theology is a mockery of God ...|[[Søren Kierkegaard]]|''Journals'', November 20, 1847&lt;ref name="Journals1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kierkegaard |first=Søren |authorlink=Søren Kierkegaard |others=translated by Alexander Dru |title=Journals of Søren Kierkegaard |publisher=Oxford |date=1948}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;/div&gt;

The '''infinite qualitative distinction''' ({{lang-da|den uendelige kvalitative forskel}}; {{lang-de|unendliche qualitative Unterschied}}), sometimes translated as '''infinite qualitative difference''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Søren |last=Kierkegaard |title=Training in Christianity, and the Edifying discourse which 'accompanied' it |url=https://books.google.com/?id=T9BXAAAAYAAJ |date=1941 |others=Transl. by [[Walter Lowrie (author)|Walter Lowrie]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page=[https://books.google.com/?id=T9BXAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22the+infinite+qualitative+difference+between+God+and+man%22 139 ("the infinite qualitative difference between God and man")]}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a concept coined by the Danish philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]]. The distinction emphasizes the very different attributes of finite and temporal men and the infinite and eternal qualities of a supreme being. This concept fits into the [[apophatic theology#20th_century|apophatic theology]] tradition and therefore is fundamentally at odds with theological theories which posit a supreme being able to be fully understood by man. The theologian [[Karl Barth]] made the concept of infinite qualitative distinction a cornerstone of his theology.&lt;ref&gt;McGrath, 2006, pp. 225-227&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
For Kierkegaard, direct communication with God is impossible, as the idea of God and man are infinitely different. He argues that indirect communication with God is the only way of communication. For example, in [[Christian]] belief, the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] posits that [[Jesus Christ]] is God incarnate. The infinite qualitative distinction is opposed to rational theology in the sense that, whereas the latter argues one can prove empirically Jesus is God incarnate, the former argues that [[empirical evidence]] is ultimately insufficient in making that conclusion. The paradoxical nature of the Incarnation, that God is embodied in a man, is offensive to reason, and can only be comprehended indirectly, through [[faith]].&lt;ref&gt;Dorrien, Gary. ''The Barthian revolt in modern theology''. Westminster Press, 1999. p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Barth's book ''[[The Epistle to the Romans (Barth)|The Epistle to the Romans]]'' also emphasizes such a gulf. In the preface to the Second Edition of his commentary, Barth writes, "if I have a system, it is limited to a recognition of what Kierkegaard called the 'infinite qualitative distinction' between time and eternity, and to my regarding this as possessing negative as well as positive significance: 'God is in heaven, and thou art on earth'. The relation between such a God and such a man, and the relation between such a man and such a God, is for me the theme of the Bible and the essence of philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Karl |last=Barth |authorlink=Karl Barth |title=The Epistle to the Romans |url=https://books.google.com/?id=dCEDzQhI4R4C&amp;printsec=frontcover |year=1968 |origyear=[https://books.google.com/?id=3OrYAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22if+I+have+a+system,+it+is+limited+to+a+recognition+of+what+Kierkegaard+called+the+'+infinite+qualitative+distinction+'+between+time+and+eternity,+and+to+my+regarding+this+as+possessing+negative+as+well+as+positive+significance%22 1933] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=0-19500294-6 |id={{ISBN|978-0-195-00294-2}} |page=[https://books.google.com/?id=dCEDzQhI4R4C&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=%22if+I+have+a+system,+it+is+limited+to+a+recognition+of+what+Kierkegaard+called+the+'+infinite+qualitative+distinction+'+between+time+and+eternity,+and+to+my+regarding+this+as+possessing+negative+as+well+as+positive+significance%22 10]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kierkegaard doesn't believe God is so objective toward human beings but rather that he is the absolute subjective being. He put it this way in 1846: {{Quotation|The subjective thinker is a dialectician dealing with the existential, and he has the passion of thought requisite for holding fast to the qualitative disjunction. But on the other hand, if the qualitative is applied in empty isolation, if it is applied to the individual in an altogether abstract fashion, one may risk saying something infinitely decisive and be quite correct in what one says, and yet, ludicrously enough, say nothing at all. Hence it is a psychologically noteworthy phenomenon, that the absolute disjunction may be used quite disingenuously, precisely for the purpose of evasion. When the death-penalty is affixed to every crime, it ends in no crime being punished at all.  So also in the case of the injunction. Applied abstractly it becomes an unpronounceable mute letter, or if pronounced, it says nothing. The subjective thinker has the absolute disjunction ready to hand; therefore, as an essential existential moment he holds it fast with a thinker’s passion, but he holds it as a last decisive resort, to prevent everything from being reduced to merely quantitative differences. He holds it in reserve, but does not apply it so as by recurring to it abstractly to inhibit existence. Hence the subjective thinker adds to his equipment aesthetic and ethical passion, which gives him the necessary concreteness. All existential problems are passionate problems, for when existence is interpenetrated with reflection it generates passion.

===Admissions===

With an acceptance rate of only 10%, it is the most selective in Saudi Arabia. The university's admission policy applies certain criteria to ensure admissions of the most promising students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.kfupm.edu.sa/admissions/Files/AdmissionsRules.htm |title=معايير القبول في الجامعة |publisher=King Fahd University|accessdate=11 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the university accepted the best 2% of high school graduates from all over the Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=المانع|first=عبدالله|title=السلطان: جامعة البترول استقطبت أفضل 02% من طلاب المملكة|url=http://www.al-madina.com/node/398394|accessdate=24 September 2012|newspaper=Al Madina|date=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; comprising 20% for the high school certificate, 30% for the general capabilities test (similar to [[SAT]]), and 50% for the collective test performances (test of high school's maths, physics, chemistry and Biology).

=== KFUPM Endowment ===
It was announced in 2007 that the University will establish an independent administrative body tasked with managing and overseeing donations and the University's industry collaboration activities. The Endowment Fund Office is composed of an independent governing board, with a professional staff that manages the Fund's operations, resembling those of Harvard Investment Group and the Yale Investment Office. The KFUPM Fund is the first in Saudi Arabia to be professionally managed by specialized finance and investment teams. The mission of the Fund is to be able to provide the necessary financing (up to 30%) the University needs in the future, and cover costs that aren't sponsored by the University's main funds source, The Ministry of Education. In just over five years, the Endowment has grown to be the largest university endowment in Saudi Arabia (relative to the size of KFUPM budget) and was able to raise more than $500 million in financial assets along with real estate assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.kfupm.edu.sa/kfupmfund/Default.aspx#page/12|title=::: KFUPM Endowment :::|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Endowment's main investment projects include the establishment of a business park in the north side of the KFUPM campus that includes constructing numerous hotels and office buildings. The University has contracted the UK-based Marts &amp; Lundy to consult on fundraising and managing activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.kfupm.edu.sa/kfupmfund/News.aspx?nid=48|title=::: KFUPM Endowment :::|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fund's main financing activities include the establishment of specific-purpose research grants and projects. In addition, the Endowment has announced the creation of 8 doctoral fellowships (the first of its kind in the kingdom that is unrelated to governmental constraints in terms of funding).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.kfupm.edu.sa/kfupmfund/News.aspx?nid=47|title=::: KFUPM Endowment :::|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1450">A '''Legist''', from the Latin ''lex'' 'law', is any expert or student of law.

It was especially used since the [[Carolingian]] dynasty for royal councillors who advised the monarch in legal matters, and specifically helped base its absolutist ambitions on [[Roman Law]]. More generally they were teachers of civil or Roman law, who, besides expounding sources, explaining terms, elucidating texts, summarizing the contents of chapters etc., illustrated by cases, real or imaginary, the numerous questions and distinctions arising out of the "Corpus Juris" enactments of the ancient Roman code.
 
From the twelfth century, when a fresh impulse was given to legal researches, the terms legist and [[decretist]] -- the latter applied, in the narrower sense, to the interpreter of ecclesiastical [[canon law]] and commentator on the canonical texts—have been carefully distinguished.
 
Legists came to be employed by lower authorities in the feudal pyramid. The rise of universities would lead to academical lawyers taking their place in the western world.

By analogy, the term is also applied to equivalent legal advisers in other traditions, e.g. in [[Sharia|Islamic law]] and/or civil law of the [[Ottoman Empire]].

'''Linear (or Longitudinal) Timecode''' ('''LTC''') is an [[encoding]] of [[SMPTE timecode]] data in an [[audio signal]], as defined in SMPTE 12M specification. The [[Sound reproduction|audio]] signal is commonly recorded on a [[VTR]] track or other storage media.  The bits are encoded using the [[biphase mark code]] (also known as ''FM''):  a 0 bit has a single transition at the start of the bit period.  A 1 bit has two transitions, at the beginning and middle of the period.  This encoding is [[self-clocking]]. Each frame is terminated by a '[[sync word]]' which has a special predefined [[synchronization|sync]] relationship with any [[video]] or [[telecine|film]] content.

A special bit in the linear timecode frame, the ''biphase mark correction'' bit, ensures that there are an even number of AC transitions in each timecode frame.

The sound of linear timecode is a jarring and distinctive noise and has been used as a sound-effects shorthand to imply ''telemetry'' or ''computers''.

==Generation and Distribution==
In broadcast video situations, the LTC generator should be tied into house black burst, as should all devices using timecode, '''to ensure correct color framing and correct synchronization of all digital clocks.''' When synchronizing multiple clock-dependent digital devices together with video, such as digital audio recorders, the devices must be connected to a common word clock signal that is derived from the house black burst signal. This can be accomplished by using a generator that generates both black burst and video-resolved word clock, or by synchronizing the master digital device to video, and synchronizing all subsequent devices to the word clock output of the master digital device (and to LTC).

Made up of 80 bits per frame, where there may be 24, 25 or 30 frames per second, LTC timecode varies from 960&amp;nbsp;Hz (binary zeros at 24 frames/s) to 2400&amp;nbsp;Hz (binary ones at 30 frames/s), and thus is comfortably in the audio frequency range. LTC can exist as either a balanced or unbalanced signal, and can be treated as an audio signal in regards to distribution. Like audio, LTC can be distributed by standard audio wiring, connectors, distribution amplifiers, and patchbays, and can be ground-isolated with audio transformers.  It can also be distributed via 75 ohm video cable and video distribution amplifiers, although the voltage attenuation caused by using a 75 ohm system may cause the signal to drop to a level that can not be read by some equipment.

Care has to be taken with analog audio to avoid audible 'breakthrough' (aka "crosstalk") from the LTC track to the audio tracks.

'''LTC care''':

*Avoid percussive sounds close to LTC
*Never process an LTC with noise reduction, eq or compressor
*Allow pre roll and post roll
*To create negative time code add one hour to time (avoid ''midnight effect'')
*Always put slowest device as a master

Longitudinal SMPTE timecode should be played back at a middle-level when recorded on an audio track, as both low and high levels will introduce distortion.

==Longitudinal timecode data format==

The basic format is an 80-bit code that gives the time of day to the second, and the frame number within the second.  Values are stored in [[binary-coded decimal]], least significant bit first.
There are thirty-two bits of user data, usually used for a reel number and date.

* Bit 10 is set to 1 if [[SMPTE time code#Drop frame timecode|drop frame]] numbering is in use; frame numbers 0 and 1 are skipped during the first second of every minute, except multiples of 10 minutes.  This converts 30 frame/second time code to the 29.97 frame/second [[NTSC]] standard.
* Bit 11, the [[color framing]] bit, is set to 1 if the time code is synchronized to a color video signal.  The frame number modulo 2 (for NTSC and [[SECAM]]) or modulo 4 (for [[PAL]]) should be preserved across cuts in order to avoid phase jumps in the [[chrominance subcarrier]].
* Bits 27, 43, and 59 differ between 25 frame/s time code, and other frame rates (30, 29.97, or 24).{{r|BR.780-2|p=9}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |mode=cs1 |title=Indian Standard IS: 12429 (Part 1) Time and Control Code for Video Tape Recorders: Part 1 Longitudinal Time Code (LTC) |year=2002 |orig-year=1988 |publisher=[[Bureau of Indian Standards]] |pages=1–3 |url=https://law.resource.org/pub/in/bis/S04/is.12429.1.1988.pdf}}  This is an example of the 25 frame/s bit assignments, which are different from the more commonly seen 30/29.97/24 bit assignments.&lt;/ref&gt;  The bits are:
** "Polarity correction bit" (bit 59 at 25 frame/s, bit 27 at other rates): this bit is chosen to provide an even number of 0 bits in the whole frame, including the sync code.  (Since the frame is an even number of bits long, this implies an even number of 1 bits, and is thus an [[even parity]] bit.  Since the sync code includes an odd number of 1 bits, it is an odd parity bit over the data.)  This keeps the phase of each frame consistent, so it always starts with a rising edge at the beginning of bit 0.  This allows seamless splicing of different time codes, and lets it be more easily read with an [[oscilloscope]].&lt;!--It is NOT needed to ensure zero DC bias; biphase encoding takes care of that.--&gt;
** "Binary group flag" bits BGF0 and BGF2 (bits 27 and 43 at 25 frame/s, bits 43 and 59 at other rates): these indicate the format of the user bits.  Both 0 indicates no (or unspecified) format.  Only BGF0 set indicates four 8-bit characters (transmitted [[little-endian]]).  The combinations with BGF2 set are reserved.{{r|BR.780-2|p=7–8}}
* Bit 58, unused in earlier versions of the specification, is now defined as "binary group flag 1" and indicates that the time code is synchronized to an external clock.{{r|BR.780-2|p=7}}  if zero, the time origin is arbitrary.
* The sync pattern in bits 64 through 79 includes 12 consecutive 1 bits, which cannot appear anywhere else in the time code.  Assuming all user bits are set to 1, the longest run of 1 bits that can appear elsewhere in the time code is 10, bits 9 to 18 inclusive.
* The sync pattern is preceded by 00 and followed by 01.  This is used to determine whether an audio tape is running forward or backward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SMPTR Made Simple |publisher=TimeLine Vista, Inc. |year=1996 |page=11 |url=http://faculty.spokanefalls.edu/InetShare/AutoWebs/steveg/SmpteMadeSimple.pdf |quote=The time code reader uses the direction sense bits to determine whether the tape is running forward or backward.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Synchronisation and SMPTE timecode (time code) |first=Phil |last=Rees |date=15 November 2013 |url=http://www.philrees.co.uk/articles/timecode.htm |accessdate=2016-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Liturgics''' is the [[academic discipline]] dedicated to the study of [[liturgy]] (public worship rites, rituals, and practices). Liturgics scholars typically specialize in a single approach drawn from another scholarly field.  The most common sub-disciplines are: [[history]] or [[church history]], [[theology]], and [[anthropology]]. Although liturgics scholars using these approaches apply the principles of their respective disciplines to their research, all liturgics scholars focus their work in the [[ritual]] behaviors of the members of faith communities.

The list does not include the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]], since this was, at least partially, externally induced by a [[meteor impact]].

'''Mireia Boya Busquet''' (born 1979) is a Catalan scientist, activist, and politician. She is a councilor of the [[Val d'Aran|Aran]] municipality of [[Les, Catalonia|Les]]. Since February 2018 she has been part of the national secretariat of the [[Popular Unity Candidacy]] (CUP). She was a member of the [[Parliament of Catalonia|Catalan Parliament]] from 2016 to 2017.

==Biography==
The daughter of Ernesto Boya and the politician {{ill|Maria Pilar Busquets|es}}, she has a degree in [[Environmental Science]]s from the [[Autonomous University of Barcelona]] (2002), a master's degree in Landscape Design (2004), and a PhD in Land Management and Planning (2009) from the [[Université de Montréal]]. In the professional field, she is a consultant and associate professor of the Humanities Department of [[Pompeu Fabra University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.vilaweb.cat/noticies/la-cup-renova-el-40-dels-diputats-al-parlament/ |title=La CUP renova el 40% dels diputats que té al parlament |trans-title=The CUP Renews 40% of MPs in Parliament |work=[[VilaWeb]] |language=Catalan |date=11 January 2016 |access-date=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mireia Boya Busquet has been a fighter for the recognition of [[Val d'Aran|Occitan]] identity of the Valley of Aran, and was the first member of the Catalan Parliament to use the [[Aranese dialect]] in the [[Parliament of Catalonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.esdiario.com/895533049/Rozando-el-esperpento-la-nueva-diputada-de-CUP-solo-hablara-en-aranes.html |title=Rozando el esperpento: la nueva diputada de CUP sólo hablará en aranés |trans-title=Grazing the Grotesque: The New CUP Deputy Will Only Speak in Aranese |work=ESDiario.com |language=Spanish |date=20 January 2016 |access-date=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her brother, {{ill|Jusèp Boya Busquet|es}}, has been general director of Archives, Libraries, Museum, and Heritage of the Generalitat beginning in January 2016, an office that he was dismissed from after the 2017 suspension of Catalonian self-government.

==Political career==
Boya is a founder and former coordinator of the [[Assemblea Nacional Catalana]] in Val d'Aran and councilor in the city of [[Les, Catalonia|Les]] for the [[Corròp]] party, framed in [[Occitan nationalism]]. In the [[Catalan regional election, 2015|2015 elections to the Parliament of Catalonia]], she was a candidate of the [[Popular Unity Candidacy|CUP]] for the district of [[Province of Lleida|Lleida]], after a vote in primaries. Boya, who was second in the list in her constituency, was not elected, but on 18 December 2015, during the tense negotiations between the CUP and the pro-independence coalition [[Junts pel Sí]], the CUP's number one, Ramon Usall, resigned for personal reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20151219/30915108732/diputado-cup-renuncia-ramon-usall.html |title=Voto secreto en la asamblea de la CUP para decidir si se inviste a Artur Mas |trans-title=Secret Vote in the CUP Assembly to Decide Whether to Invest Artur Mas |first=Àlex |last=Tort |work=[[La Vanguardia]] |language=Spanish |date=19 December 2015 |access-date=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, Boya occupied the post of regional parliamentarian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.naciodigital.cat/lleida/noticia/16111/mireia/boya/sera/diputada/cup/substitucio/ramon/usall |title=Mireia Boya serà diputada de la CUP en substitució de Ramon Usall |trans-title=Mireia Boya to be CUP Deputy as Substitute for Ramon Usall |first=Àlvar |last=Llobet |work=Nació Digital |language=Catalan |date=10 January 2016 |access-date=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.jornalet.com/nova/5499/una-occitanista-aranesa-candidata-al-parlament-de-catalonha-per-la-cup |title=Una occitanista aranesa candidata al Parlament de Catalonha per la CUP |trans-title=An Occitan Aranese Candidate for the Parliament of Catalonia for the CUP |work=Jornalet |language=Catalan |date=31 July 2015 |access-date=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She participated in the plenary sessions of the Parliament that voted for the roadmap to independence for Catalonia, and voted the Unilateral declaration of Independence of Catalonia.

In the elections of 21 December 2017, of the 5,265 votes cast in Val d'Aran, the CUP received 174 – 3.3% of the total.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://resultados.elpais.com/elecciones/2017/autonomicas/09/25-39.html |title=Resultados Electorales en Aran: Elecciones Cataluña 2017 |trans-title=Electoral Results in Aran: Catalan Elections 2017 |work=[[El País]] |language=Spanish |access-date=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, she was elected a member of the CUP National Secretariat as an independent candidate with 662 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20180216/44820594186/la-cup-renueva-su-cupula-con-equilibrios-internos-pese-al-exito-de-endavant.html |title=La CUP renueva su cúpula con equilibrios entre Endavant y Poble Lliure |trans-title=The CUP Renews its Leadership with Balances Between Endavant and Poble Lliure |work=[[La Vanguardia]] |agency=EFE |location=Barcelona |language=Spanish |date=16 February 2018 |access-date=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Occitan nationalism===
A defender of the [[Occitania|Occitan nation]], Boya upholds a "project of a country with two languages of its own", a country that looks "to the north, to Occitania".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20160120/301542079265/diputada-cup-aranes-parlament.html |title=La nueva diputada de la CUP sólo hablará en aranés en la tribuna |trans-title=The New CUP Deputy Will Only Speak in Aranese at the Rostrum |first=Quico |last=Sallés |work=[[La Vanguardia]] |location=Barcelona |language=Spanish |date=20 January 2016 |access-date=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judicial case==
On 22 December 2017, Judge Pablo Llarena of the [[Supreme Court of Spain]] agreed on the inquiry (previously charged) for rebellion against Mireia Boya (president of the CUP's parliamentary group), [[Artur Mas]] (president of the [[Catalan European Democratic Party|PDeCat]]), [[Marta Rovira]] (secretary general of the [[Republican Left of Catalonia|ERC]]), [[Anna Gabriel i Sabaté|Anna Gabriel]] (spokesperson of the CUP), [[Marta Pascal]] (general coordinator of the CUP), and {{ill|Neus Lloveras|es}} (president of the [[Association of Municipalities for Independence|AMI]]), all for belonging to the organizing team of the [[Catalan independence referendum, 2017|Catalan independence referendum]] held on 1 October 2017 and with a decisive role in the secessionist plan, whose roadmap was annulled by the Spanish Constitutional Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.abc.es/espana/abci-supremo-investiga-mas-rovira-y-gabriel-rebelion-201712221105_noticia.html |title=El juez imputa a Marta Rovira, Artur Mas y Anna Gabriel en la causa por rebelión |trans-title=The Judge Accuses Marta Rovira, Artur Mas, and Anna Gabriel in the Case for Rebellion |first1=Nati |last1=Villanueva |first2=Luis P. |last2=Arechederra |work=[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]] |language=Spanish |date=22 December 2017 |access-date=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://okdiario.com/espana/cataluna/2017/12/22/imputada-boya-cup-sostiene-decision-del-supremo-venganza-1631314 |title=La imputada Boya (CUP) sostiene que la decisión del Supremo es una 'venganza' |trans-title=The Accused Boya (CUP) Maintains that the Supreme's Decision is a 'Revenge' |work=Okdiario |language=Spanish |date=22 December 2017 |access-date=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boya was declared as investigated on 14 February 2018, being released without precautionary measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.abc.es/espana/abci-mireia-boya-declara-ante-5733616839001-20180214011307_video.html |title=Mireia Boya declara ante el Tribunal Supremo |trans-title=Mireia Boya Testifies Before the Supreme Court |work=[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]] |language=Spanish |date=14 February 2018 |access-date=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vivienda prefabricada.jpg|thumb|[[Prefabricated]] house in [[Valencia]], [[Spain]].]]
'''Modular buildings''' and '''modular homes''' are [[prefabricated building]]s or [[house]]s that consist of repeated sections called modules. "Modular" is a construction method that involves constructing sections away from the building site, then delivering them to the intended site. Installation of the prefabricated sections is completed on site. Prefabricated sections are sometimes placed using a [[crane (machine)|crane]]. The modules can be placed side-by-side, end-to-end, or stacked, allowing a variety of configurations and styles.

Modular buildings, also called prefabricated homes or precision built homes, are built to equal or higher standards as on-site [[stick-built home]]s. The building method is referred to as permanent modular construction. 

Material for stick built and modular homes are the same. Modular homes are not doublewides or mobile homes. First, modular homes do not have axles or a metal frame, meaning that they are typically transported on flat-bed [[truck]]s. Modular buildings must conform to all relevant local building codes, while doublewides and mobile homes have metal under framing. Doublewides and mobile homes made in the United States are required to conform to federal codes governed by [[U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/housing/ramh/mhs/faq|title=HUD- Manufactured Housing and Standards|website=Portal.hud.gov|access-date=2016-05-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160504145914/http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=%2Fprogram_offices%2Fhousing%2Framh%2Fmhs%2Ffaq|archive-date=2016-05-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==
[[File:Modular home (Palmer, Alaska - 2006).jpg|thumb|right|Modular home in [[Sutton, Alaska]]]]
Modular buildings may be used for long-term, temporary or permanent facilities, such as construction camps, schools and classrooms, civilian and military housing, and industrial facilities. Modular buildings are used in remote and rural areas where conventional construction may not be reasonable or possible, for example, the Halley VI accommodation pods used for a BAS Antarctic expedition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bas.ac.uk/polar-operations/sites-and-facilities/facility/halley/|title=Halley VI Research Station - British Antarctic Survey|website=Bas.ac.uk|access-date=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other uses have included churches, health care facilities, sales and retail offices, fast food restaurants and cruise ship construction. They can also be used in areas that have weather concerns, such as hurricanes.
{{toclimit|3}}
==Construction process==
Construction is offsite, using [[lean manufacturing]] techniques to prefabricate single or multi-story buildings in deliverable module sections. Permanent Modular Construction (PMC) buildings are manufactured in a controlled setting and can be constructed of wood, steel, or concrete. Modular components are typically constructed indoors on [[assembly lines]]. Modules' construction may take as little as ten days but more often one to three months. PMC modules can be integrated into site built projects or stand alone and can be delivered with [[Mechanical, electrical, and plumbing|MEP]], fixtures and interior finishes.

The buildings are 60% to 90% completed offsite in a factory-controlled environment, and transported and assembled at the final building site. This can comprise the entire building or be components or subassemblies of larger structures. In many cases, modular contractors work with traditional general contractors to exploit the resources and advantages of each type of construction. Completed modules are transported to the building site and assembled by a crane.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.modular.org/htmlPage.aspx?name=why_modular|title=Why Build Modular?|website=Modular.org|access-date=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Placement of the modules may take from several hours to several days.

Permanent modular buildings are built to meet or exceed the same building codes and standards as site-built structures and the same architect-specified materials used in conventionally constructed buildings are used in modular construction projects. PMC can have as many stories as building codes allow. Unlike relocatable buildings, PMC structures are intended to remain in one location for the duration of their useful life.

==Manufacturing considerations==
The entire process of [[modular construction]] places significance on the design stage. This is where practices such as [[DFMA|Design for Manufacture and Assembly (DfMA)]] are used to ensure that assembly tolerances are controlled throughout manufacture and assembly on site. It is vital that there is enough allowance in the design to allow the assembly to take up any "slack" or misalignment of components. The use of advanced [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] systems, [[3D printing]] and manufacturing control systems are important for modular construction to be successful. This is quite unlike on-site construction where the tradesman can often make the part to suit any particular installation.

==Advantages==
[[File:Modular Construction Timeline.jpg|thumb|Simultaneous site development and building construction at the plant reduces schedule by 30% to 50%]]

Modular buildings are argued to have advantages over conventional buildings, for a variety of reasons. 
*'''Speed of construction/faster return on investment'''. Modular construction allows for the building and the site work to be completed simultaneously. According to some materials, this can reduce the overall completion schedule by as much as 50%. This also reduces labor, financing and supervision costs. To save even more time and money, nearly all design and engineering disciplines are part of the manufacturing process. Also unique to modular construction is the ability to simultaneously construct a building’s floors, walls, ceilings, rafters, and roofs. During site-built construction, walls cannot be set until floors are in position, and ceilings and rafters cannot be added until walls are erected. On the other hand, with modular construction, walls, floors, ceilings, and rafters are all built at the same time, and then brought together in the same factory to form a building. This process can allow modular construction times of half that of conventional, stick-built construction.
*'''Indoor construction'''. Assembly is independent of weather, which can increase work efficiency and avoids damaged building material.
*'''Ability to service remote locations'''. Particularly in countries in which potential markets may be located far from industrial centers, such as Australia, there can be much higher costs to build a site-built house in a remote area or an area experiencing a construction boom such as mining towns. Modular buildings are also beneficial in providing medical and sanitary facilities where time, space, and money are an issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://comstruc.com/modular-construction-advantages/|title=Modular Construction Advantages &amp; Modern Day Applications - Commercial Structures Corp.|date=2017-07-26|work=Commercial Structures Corp.|access-date=2018-03-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Low waste'''. With the same plans being constantly built, the manufacturer has records of exactly what quantity of materials are needed for a given job. With the consistency, builders can design systems that use common lengths of lumber, wallboard, etc., cut items with maximum efficiency, or be able to order special lengths in bulk. While waste from a site-built dwelling may typically fill several large dumpsters, construction of a modular dwelling generates much less waste. According to the UK group WRAP, up to a 90% reduction in materials can be achieved through the use of modular construction. Materials minimized include: wood pallets, shrink wrap, cardboard, plasterboard, timber, concrete, bricks, and cement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrap.org.uk/sites/files/wrap/Modern%20Methods%20of%20Construction%20-%20Summmary.pdf|title=Current Practices and Future Potential in Modern Methods of Construction|access-date=2017-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Environmentally friendly construction process'''. Modular construction reduces waste and site disturbance compared to site-built structures. The controlled environment of the factory allows for more accurate construction while allowing the extra materials to be recycled in-house.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.constructionworld.org/7-benefits-prefabricated-construction/|title=7 Benefits of Prefabricated Construction - Construction World|website=Constructionworld.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''Flexibility'''. One can continually add to a modular building, including creating high rises.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = High-rise housing going modular|url = http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2012/02/01/high-rise-housing-going-modular/|website=News.blogs.cnn.com|accessdate = 2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the needs change, modular buildings can be disassembled and the modules relocated or refurbished for their next use reducing the demand for raw materials and minimizing the amount of energy expended to create a building to meet the new need. In essence, the entire building can be recycled in some cases.
*'''Quality'''. Combining traditional building techniques, quality manufacturing and third-party agencies who offer random inspections, testing, and certification services for quality control, commercial modular buildings are built in strict accordance with appropriate local, state, and national regulations and codes. Due to the need to transport modules to the final site, each module must be built to independently withstand travel and installation requirements. Thus the final module-to-module assembly of independently durable components can yield a final product that is more durable than site-built structures. Modular buildings often use [[Structural insulated panel|Structural Insulated Panels]] (SIPs) in construction, which offer a range of advantages over traditional building materials. SIPs panels are a light yet durable combination of panel board and either closed-cell [[polyurethane]] (PU) or expanded [[polystyrene]] (EPS) insulating foam. They are air-tight, and as such provide excellent thermal performance. They also offer superior damp and cold resistance when compared to timber and other materials, and are immune to both compression shrinking and cold bridging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.green-modular.com/blog/structural-insulated-panels/|title=Structural Insulated Panels {{!}}Green Modular|website=Green Modular|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modular units may also be designed to fit in with external aesthetics of any existing building and modular units once assembled can be virtually indistinguishable from a site-built structure.
* '''Improved Air Quality''' - Many of the indoor air quality issues identified in new construction result from high moisture levels in the framing materials. Because the modular structure is substantially completed in a factory-controlled setting using dry materials, the potential for high levels of moisture being trapped in the new construction is eliminated.

Modular buildings can also contribute to LEED requirements in any category site-built construction can, and can even provide an advantage in the areas of Sustainable Sites, Energy and Atmosphere, Materials and Resources, and Indoor Environmental Quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://modular.org/marketing/documents/Modular_09V3LEED.pdf |title=Modular Building and the USGBC’s LEED ™ Version 3.0 2009 Building Rating System}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Modular construction can also provide an advantage in similar categories in the International Green Construction Code.

==Disadvantages==
*Volumetric: Transporting the completed modular building sections take up a lot of space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Pros and Cons of a Commercial Modular Building|url = http://www.modulartoday.com/pros-cons.html|website = www.modulartoday.com|accessdate = 2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Flexibility: Due to transport and sometimes manufacturing restrictions, module size can be limited, affecting room sizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Prefab Housing Disadvantages|url = http://budgeting.thenest.com/prefab-housing-disadvantages-24540.html|website = Budgeting Money - The Nest|accessdate = 2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some financial institutions may be hesitant to offer a loan for a modular home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://learningcenter.statefarm.com/residence/buying-selling/what-to-know-when-buying-a-manufactured-home/|title=Buying a Manufactured Home|last=|first=|date=|website=State Farm|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Market acceptance===
[[Image:Stoke newington raines court 1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Raines Court is a multi-story modular housing block in [[Stoke Newington]], [[London]], one of the first two residential buildings in Britain of this type. (December 2005)]]
Some home buyers and some lending institutions resist consideration of modular homes as equivalent in value to site-built homes.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}} While the homes themselves may be of equivalent quality, entrenched zoning regulations and psychological marketplace factors may create hurdles for buyers or builders of modular homes and should be considered as part of the decision-making process when exploring this type of home as a living and/or investment option. In the UK and Australia, modular homes have become accepted in some regional areas; however, they are not commonly built in major cities. Modular homes are becoming increasingly common in Japanese urban areas, due to improvements in design and quality, speed and compactness of onsite assembly, as well as due to lowering costs and ease of repair after earthquakes. Recent innovations allow modular buildings to be indistinguishable from site-built structures.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}} Surveys have shown that individuals can rarely tell the difference between a modular home and a site-built home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title= Factory-Built Construction and the American Homebuyer: Perceptions and Opportunities|url=https://www.huduser.gov/portal/Publications/pdf/Perceptions_of_factory_construction.pdf|format=PDF|website=Huduser.gov|page=9|accessdate = 2017-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modular homes vs. mobile homes===
Differences include the building codes that govern the construction, types of material used and how they are appraised by banks for lending purposes. Modular homes are built to either local or state building codes as opposed to manufactured homes, which are also built in a factory but are governed by a federal building code.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.drysideproperty.com/mobile%20vs%20manuf%20vs%20modular.html|title=Mobile homes vs Manufactured homes vs Modular homes|last=Solutions|first=Dryside Property - Jennifer Mitchell and Magic Web|website=Drysideproperty.com|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The codes that govern the construction of modular homes are exactly the same codes that govern the construction of site-constructed homes.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}} In the United States, all modular homes are constructed according to the [[International Building Code]] (IBC), IRC, BOCA or the code that has been adopted by the local jurisdiction.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}} In some states, such as California, mobile homes must still be registered yearly, like vehicles or standard trailers, with the Department of Motor Vehicles or other state agency. This is true even if the owners remove the axles and place it on a permanent foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hcd.ca.gov/manufactured-mobile-home/index.shtml|title=HCD Manufactured and Mobile Homes|website=Hcd.ca.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recognizing a mobile or manufactured home===
A mobile home should have a small metal tag on the outside of each section. If you cannot locate a tag, you should be able to find details about the home in the electrical panel box. This tag should also reveal a manufacturing date.&lt;ref name="freshome.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freshome.com/2013/03/27/10-basic-facts-about-modular-homes/|title=10 Basic Facts You Should Know About Modular Homes - Freshome.com|author=|date=13 November 2015|website=freshome.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modular homes do not have metal tags on the outside but will have a dataplate installed inside the home, usually under the kitchen sink or in a closet. The dataplate will provide information such as the manufacturer, third party inspection agency, appliance information, and manufacture date.

===Materials===
The materials used in modular homes are typically the same as site constructed homes. Wood-frame floors, walls and roof are often utilized. Some modular homes include brick or stone exteriors, granite counters and steeply pitched roofs. Modulars can be designed to sit on a perimeter foundation or basement. In contrast, mobile homes are constructed with a steel chassis that is integral to the integrity of the floor system. Modular buildings can be custom built to a client's specifications. Current designs include multi-story units, multi-family units and entire apartment complexes. The negative stereotype commonly associated with mobile homes has prompted some manufacturers to start using the term "off-site construction."

=== Financing ===
'''Mobile homes''' often require special lenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/housing/sfh/title/repair|title=HUD Financing Manufactured (Mobile) Homes|website=Portal.hud.gov|access-date=2016-05-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503104807/http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=%2Fprogram_offices%2Fhousing%2Fsfh%2Ftitle%2Frepair|archive-date=2016-05-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Modular homes''' on the other hand are financed as site built homes with a construction loan&lt;ref name="freshome.com"/&gt;

==Standards and zoning considerations==
Typically, modular dwellings are built to local, state or council code, resulting in dwellings from a given manufacturing facility having differing construction standards depending on the final destination of the modules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_reg/lgheamhr1995693/ |title=Australian Government modular home regulations|website=Austlii.edu.au |accessdate=2007-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important zones that manufacturers have to take into consideration are local wind, heat, and snow load zones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://homenation.com/zone-maps/ |title=Home Building Zone Maps }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, homes built for final assembly in a hurricane-prone, earthquake or flooding area may include additional bracing to meet local building codes. Steel and/or wood framing are common options for building a modular home.

Some US courts have ruled that [[zoning]] restrictions applicable to mobile homes do not apply to modular homes since modular homes are designed to have a permanent foundation.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}} Additionally, in the US, valuation differences between modular homes and site-built homes are often negligible in [[real estate appraisal]] practice; modular homes can, in some market areas, (depending on local appraisal practices per [[Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice]]) be evaluated the same way as site-built dwellings of similar quality. In Australia, manufactured home parks are governed by additional legislation that does not apply to permanent modular homes. Possible developments in equivalence between modular and site-built housing types for the purposes of [[real estate appraisal]]s, financing and zoning may increase the sales of modular homes over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://modularhomesnetwork.com/building-codes/index.asp |title=Building Codes for Modular Homes |website=Modularhomesnetwork.com|accessdate=2010-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Building strength===
Modular homes are designed to be stronger than traditional homes by, for example, replacing nails with screws, adding glue to joints, and using 8-10% more lumber than conventional housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Disruptive Development: Modular Manufacturing In Multifamily Housing|url=http://ternercenter.berkeley.edu/uploads/A.Stein_PR_Disruptive_Development_-_Modular_Manufacturing_in_Multifamily_Housing.pdf|accessdate=10 September 2017|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is to help the modules maintain their structural integrity as they are transported on trucks to the construction site; however, it is difficult to predict the final building strength since the modules need to endure transportation stresses that traditional homes never experience.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}}

The insulated concrete forms are modular units that are dry-stacked (without mortar) and filled with concrete. Insulating concrete forms has an acceptable ductility if used in high seismic risk zones.&lt;ref name=Asadi&gt;{{cite journal |last=Asadi |first=Pouria |date=March 2016 |title=Response modification factor due to ductility of screen-grid ICF wall system in high seismic risk zones |journal=KSCE Journal of Civil Engineering|issn=1226-7988 |doi=10.1007/s12205-016-0083-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When FEMA studied the destruction wrought by [[Hurricane Andrew]] in Dade County Florida, they concluded that modular and [[masonry]] homes fared best compared to other construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fema.gov/library/viewRecord.do?id=2765|title=FIA 22, Mitigation Assessment Team Report: Hurricane Andrew in Florida (1993) |website=Fema.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===CE marking===
The [[CE mark]] is a construction norm that guarantees the user of mechanical resistance and strength of the structure. It is a label given by [[European community]] empowered authorities for end-to-end process mastering and traceability.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}}

All manufacturing operations are being monitored and recorded:
* Suppliers have to be known and certified,
* Raw materials and goods being sourced are to be recorded by batch used,
* Elementary products are recorded and their quality is monitored,
* Assembly quality is managed and assessed on a step by step basis,
* When a modular unit is finished, a whole set of tests are performed and if quality standards are met, a unique number and EC stamp is attached to and on the unit.

This ID and all the details are recorded in a [[database]], At any time, the producer has to be able to answer and provide all the information from each step of the production of a single unit, The EC certification guaranties standards in terms of durability, resistance against wind and earthquakes.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}}

===Surfaces and finishes===
Modular buildings can be assembled on top of multiple foundation surfaces, such as a crawl space, stilts (for areas that are prone to flooding), full [[basement]]s or standard slab at grade. They can also be built to multi-story heights. [[Motels]] and other multi-family structures have been built using modular construction techniques. The height to which a modular structure can be built depends on jurisdiction, but a number of countries, especially in Asia, allow them to be built to 24 floors or more.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}}

Exterior wall surfaces can be finalized in the plant production process or in the case of brick/stone veneers, field applications may be the builders' choice. Roof systems also can be applied in the field after the basic installation is completed.

===U.S. regional differences with modular construction===
Weather, population density, geographical distances, and local housing architecture play a role in the use of modular construction for home building. Because modular construction is so adaptable, it has begun to permeate every region of the U.S.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}}

====Northeast====
The northeast is populated with factories that can combine modular housing design with other construction methods such as panelization and [[structural insulated panel|SIP]]s. Modules are typically limited to 16' width and up to 70' lengths because of the narrow road structure and densely populated areas of the region.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}} Other limitations are placed on transportation to locations such as Connecticut, Cape Cod, and Long Island.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}}

====Mid-Atlantic====
The Mid-Atlantic region is similar to the northeast, in terms of building design and transport restriction to modules to a width of not more than 16'.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}}

====Southeast====

Manufacturers in the Southeast often limit their ability to customize homes and focus on very traditional single story floor plans.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}} Much of the south is in coastal and high wind areas; modular construction may prove appealing in this area as it is already inherently stronger as it must be built for transport and craned installation, therefore offering wind resistance as good or higher than site-built construction.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}}

====Central Plains====
The central plains states typically are made up of farming and rural communities. Ranch homes are the mainstay of the region. Prone to strong storms and tornado conditions, modular construction offers the ability to better withstand these storm patterns than its site built counterpart.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}} The inter-module attachments that must be made when assembling a modular home on a foundation offer an inherently stronger home than site built construction can offer.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}} Interior finishes on both the walls and ceilings are typically textured. Corners on interior walls are typically rounded and finish trim around windows is optional. Because of the wider road and lower population density, modules can be as wide as 20' and as long as 90'. The ability to provide larger modules reduces the amount of modules needed to complete a home.

====Rockies====
Home design in this area ranges from Chalet style homes to log cabin style homes. Manufacturers in the region therefore provide a number of styles of homes. Capability varies from factory to factory as well as the ability to do complete customization of floor plans. Transportation is limited mostly to 16' wide modules to travel the roads of the area.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}}

====West Coast====
The high cost of living in coastal areas, and especially California, may provide modular construction an edge due to its lower cost.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}} Extreme building regulation and environmental requirements can delay the start of residential construction.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}} Several factories specialize in environmentally responsible construction by following green construction standards and offering zero energy homes.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}}

Living in coastal areas also mean that the modular home structure should be strong enough to withstand winds with high velocity. Modular homes, built correctly, have such kind of resistance to stand high wind velocity without any damage issues.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}}

In [[theatre]], a '''monologue''' (from {{lang-el|μονόλογος}}, from μόνος ''mónos'', "alone, solitary" and λόγος ''lógos'', "speech") is a speech presented by a single [[character (arts)|character]], most often to express their mental thoughts aloud, though sometimes also to directly address another character or the [[audience]]. Monologues are common across the range of dramatic media ([[Play (theatre)|play]]s, [[film]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/list/ls000000354/|title=The Greatest Movie Speeches/Monologues of all time!|author=|date=|website=IMDb|accessdate=29 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401000758/http://www.imdb.com/list/ls000000354/|archivedate=1 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; etc.), as well as in non-dramatic media such as [[poetry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/rb/dm1.html |title=Dramatic Monologue: An Introduction |publisher=Victorianweb.org |date=2003-03-10 |accessdate=2013-08-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130807215608/http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/rb/dm1.html |archivedate=7 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Monologues share much in common with several other literary devices including [[Soliloquy|soliloquies]], [[Apostrophe (figure of speech)|apostrophes]], and [[asides|asides]]. There are, however, distinctions between each of these devices.

==Similar literary devices==
Monologues are similar to [[Poetry|poems]], epiphanies, and others, in that, they involve one 'voice' speaking but there are differences between them. For example, a soliloquy involves a character relating his or her thoughts and feelings to him/herself and to the audience without addressing any of the other characters. A monologue is the thoughts of a person spoken out loud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/soliloquy |title=Soliloquy – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130706041614/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/soliloquy |archivedate=6 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Monologues are also distinct from apostrophes, in which the speaker or writer addresses an imaginary person, inanimate object, or idea.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pleasanton.k12.ca.us/fhsweb/thoeb/RomeoandJuliet.htm |title=The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare |publisher=Pleasanton.k12.ca.us |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902062728/http://www.pleasanton.k12.ca.us/fhsweb/thoeb/RomeoandJuliet.htm |archivedate=2 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Asides differ from each of these not only in length (asides are shorter) but also in that asides are not heard by other characters even in situations where they logically should be (e.g. two characters engaging in a [[dialogue]] interrupted by one of them delivering an aside).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

==History==
In ancient Greek theatre, the origin of western drama,{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} the conventional three actor rule was preceded by a two actor rule, which was itself preceded by a convention in which only a single actor would appear on stage, along with the chorus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuritz|first=Paul|title=The Making of Theatre History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cS6JV4Z27DoC|accessdate=27 May 2014|year=1988|isbn=978-0-13-547861-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of the monologue as a dramatic device, therefore, is not rooted in dialogue. It is, instead, the other way around; dialogue evolved from monologue.

Ancient Roman theatre featured monologues extensively, more commonly than either Ancient Greek theatre or modern theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Link Monologues in Roman Comedy |author=Henry W. Prescott |journal=Classical Philology |volume=34 |issue=1 |date=January 1939 |pages=1–23|jstor=264065}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the key purposes of these monologues was to indicate the passage of significant amounts of time (that would be tedious to actually play out in real time) within scenes. This type of monologue is referred to as a linking monologue.&lt;ref name="jstor1"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Link Monologues in Roman Comedy |author=Henry W. Prescott |journal=Classical Philology |volume=34 |issue=2 |date=April 1939 |pages=116–126|jstor=264823}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other monologue types included "entrance monologues"&lt;ref name="jstor1"/&gt; and exit monologues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Exit Monologues in Roman Comedy |author=Henry W. Prescott |journal=Classical Philology|volume=37 |issue=1 |date=January 1942 |pages=1–21 |jstor=264367}}&lt;/ref&gt; In each of these cases a primary function is indicating the passage of time.&lt;ref name="jstor1"/&gt;

From Renaissance theatre onward, monologues generally focused on characters using the extended speech to pursue their dramatic need. Postmodern theatre, on the other hand, often embraces the performative aspects of the monologue, even to the point of challenging the boundary between character portrayal (e.g. acting) and autobiographical speeches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geis|first=Deborah R.|title=Postmodern theatric(k)s: monologue in contemporary American drama|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AiJaAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=27 May 2014|date=December 1993|publisher=[[University of Michigan Press]]|isbn=978-0-472-10467-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Interior monologues involve a character externalizing their thoughts so that the audience can witness experiences that would otherwise be mostly internal. In contrast, a dramatic monologue involves one character speaking to another character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/389899/monologue |title=monologue (drama and literature) - Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130812133304/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/389899/monologue |archivedate=12 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Monologues can also be divided along the lines of active and narrative monologues. In an active monologue a character is using their speech to achieve a clear goal. Narrative monologues simply involve a character telling a story and can often be identified by the fact that they are in the past tense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.angelfire.com/ego/westmontdrama/MonologueInfo.html |title=Monologue Information |publisher=Angelfire.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028033907/http://www.angelfire.com/ego/westmontdrama/MonologueInfo.html |archivedate=28 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Auditions==
Actors in theatre, and sometimes in film and television, may be asked to deliver monologues in auditions. Audition monologues demonstrate an actor's ability to prepare a piece and deliver a performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Audition Monologues|url=http://www.ace-your-audition.com/free-monologues.html|website=Ace Your Audition|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100714084548/http://www.ace-your-audition.com/free-monologues.html|archivedate=14 July 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These pieces are usually limited to two minutes or less and are often paired with a contrasting monologue: comic and dramatic; classical and contemporary. The choice of monologues for an audition&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailyactor.com/contemporary-monologues/|title=Monologues from Movies &amp; Plays|last=|first=|date=October 4, 2018|website=Daily Actor|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; often depends on the play or role. The audition monologue is a rite of passage with theatre actors.

They are often associated with other involuntary actions, including muscular [[spasm]]s in multiple areas of the body, a general [[euphoria|euphoric]] sensation and, frequently, body movements and vocalizations.&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"/&gt; The period after orgasm (known as the [[refractory period (sex)|refractory period]]) is often a relaxing experience, attributed to the release of the [[neurohormone]]s [[oxytocin]] and [[prolactin]] as well as [[endorphins]] (or "endogenous [[morphine]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Exton MS, Krüger TH, Koch M |title=Coitus-induced orgasm stimulates prolactin secretion in healthy subjects |journal=Psychoneuroendocrinology |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=287–94 |date=April 2001 |pmid=11166491 |doi=10.1016/S0306-4530(00)00053-6|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The health effects surrounding the human orgasm are diverse. There are many physiological responses during sexual activity, including a relaxed state created by prolactin, as well as changes in the [[central nervous system]] such as a temporary decrease in the [[Metabolism|metabolic]] activity of large parts of the [[cerebral cortex]] while there is no change or increased metabolic activity in the [[Limbic system|limbic]] (i.e., "bordering") areas of the brain.&lt;ref name="Georgiadis"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Georgiadis JR, Reinders AA, Paans AM, Renken R, Kortekaas R |title=Men versus women on sexual brain function: prominent differences during tactile genital stimulation, but not during orgasm |journal=Human Brain Mapping |volume=30 |issue=10 |pages=3089–101 |date=October 2009 |pmid=19219848 |doi=10.1002/hbm.20733|last2=Reinders |last3=Paans |last4=Renken |last5=Kortekaas }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a wide range of [[sexual dysfunction]]s, such as [[anorgasmia]].

Orgasm in non-human animals has been studied significantly less than orgasm in humans, but research on the subject is ongoing.

==Definitions==
In a clinical context, orgasm is usually defined strictly by the muscular contractions involved during sexual activity, along with the characteristic patterns of change in heart rate, blood pressure, and often respiration rate and depth.&lt;ref name="M&amp;J"/&gt; This is categorized as the sudden discharge of accumulated sexual tension during the [[Human sexual response cycle|sexual response cycle]], resulting in rhythmic muscular contractions in the pelvic region.&lt;ref name="M&amp;J"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="health.discovery.com"/&gt; However, definitions of orgasm vary and there is sentiment that consensus on how to consistently classify it is absent.&lt;ref name=levine_orgasm&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Levine, R.J.|year=2004|title=An orgasm is... who defines what an orgasm is?|journal=[[Sexual and Relationship Therapy]]|volume=19|pages=101–107 |doi=10.1080/14681990410001641663}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least twenty-six definitions of orgasm were listed in the journal ''[[Clinical Psychology Review]]''.&lt;ref name=mah_&amp;_binik&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Mah |first1=K. |last2=Binik |first2=Y. M. |title=The nature of human orgasm: a critical review of major trends |journal=[[Clinical Psychology Review]]|volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=823–56 |date=August 2001 |pmid=11497209 |doi=10.1016/S0272-7358(00)00069-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some debate whether certain types of sexual sensations should be accurately classified as orgasms, including female orgasms caused by [[G-spot]] stimulation alone, and the demonstration of extended or continuous orgasms lasting several minutes or even an hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author =  Schwartz, Bob | title = The One Hour Orgasm: A New Approach to Achieving Maximum Sexual Pleasure | publisher = Breakthru Publishing |date=May 1992 | isbn = 978-0-942540-07-9}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The question centers around the clinical definition of orgasm, but this way of viewing orgasm is merely physiological, while there are also psychological, endocrinological, and neurological definitions of orgasm.&lt;ref name=levine_orgasm/&gt;&lt;ref name=mah_&amp;_binik/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mah"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Mah |first1=K. |last2=Binik |first2=Y.

However, the sensations in both sexes are extremely pleasurable and are often felt throughout the body, causing a mental state that is often described as transcendental, and with [[vasocongestion]] and associated pleasure comparable to that of a full-contractionary orgasm. For example, modern findings support distinction between ejaculation and male orgasm.&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"/&gt;&lt;ref name=mah_&amp;_binik/&gt; For this reason, there are views on both sides as to whether these can be accurately defined as orgasms.&lt;ref name="Mah"/&gt;

==Achieving orgasm==
Orgasms can be achieved by a variety of activities, including [[Sexual intercourse|vaginal]], [[Anal sex|anal]] or [[oral sex]], [[non-penetrative sex]] or masturbation. Orgasm may also be achieved by the use of a [[sex toy]], such as a [[Vibrator (sex toy)|sensual vibrator]] or an [[erotic electrostimulation]]. It can additionally be achieved by stimulation of the [[nipple]]s or other [[erogenous zone]]s, though this is rarer.&lt;ref name="Answer"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Orgasm Answer Guide|isbn = 978-0-8018-9396-4|publisher=JHU Press|year=2009|pages=108–109|accessdate=6 November 2011|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Kkts3AX9QVAC&amp;pg=PA108 |author1=Barry R.

Orgasm by psychological stimulation alone was first reported among people who had [[spinal cord injury]].&lt;ref name="Komisaruk"/&gt; Although sexual function and [[sexuality after spinal cord injury]] is very often impacted, this injury does not deprive one of sexual feelings such as [[sexual arousal]] and erotic desires.&lt;ref name="Komisaruk"/&gt;

Scientific literature focuses on the psychology of female orgasm significantly more than it does on the psychology of male orgasm, which "appears to reflect the assumption that female orgasm is psychologically more complex than male orgasm," but "the limited empirical evidence available suggests that male and female orgasm may bear more similarities than differences. In one controlled study by Vance and Wagner (1976), independent raters could not differentiate written descriptions of male versus female orgasm experiences".&lt;ref name="Mah"/&gt;

===Males===

====Variabilities====
In men, the most common way of achieving orgasm is by physical sexual stimulation&lt;!-- NOTE: "Sexual stimulation" can mean or include non-physical stimulation; because it takes physical sexual stimulation of the genitals for most people to orgasm, the wording "physical sexual stimulation" is more accurate than "sexual stimulation." --&gt; of the [[Human penis|penis]].&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"/&gt; This is usually accompanied by [[ejaculation]], but it is possible, though also rare, for men to orgasm without ejaculation (known as a "dry orgasm") or to ejaculate without reaching orgasm (which may be a case of [[delayed ejaculation]], a [[nocturnal emission]] or a case of [[anorgasmia|anorgasmic ejaculation]]).&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"/&gt;&lt;ref name=mah_&amp;_binik/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dunn"/&gt; Men may also achieve orgasm by stimulation of the [[prostate]] ([[#Anal and prostate stimulation|see below]]).&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wibowo"/&gt;

====Two-stage model====
The traditional view of male orgasm is that there are two stages: emission following orgasm, almost instantly followed by a [[refractory period (sex)|refractory period]].&lt;ref name="Dunn"/&gt; In 1966, [[Masters and Johnson]] published pivotal research about the phases of sexual stimulation.&lt;ref name=M&amp;J/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Masters and Johnson | url=http://health.discovery.com/centers/sex/sexpedia/mandj.html | publisher=The Discovery Channel | accessdate=28 May 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060518002107/http://health.discovery.com/centers/sex/sexpedia/mandj.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 18 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their work included women and men, and, unlike [[Alfred Kinsey]] in 1948 and 1953,&lt;ref name="Andersen"&gt;{{cite book|title=Sociology: Understanding a Diverse Society|isbn = 978-0-495-00742-5|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|year=2007|page=338|accessdate=3 January 2012|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UILcQZS6Bi4C&amp;pg=PA338&amp;dq=Kinsey+criticized+Freud#v=onepage&amp;q=Kinsey%20criticized%20Freud&amp;f=false|author1=Margaret L. Andersen |author2=Howard Francis Taylor }}&lt;/ref&gt; tried to determine the [[physiology|physiological]] stages before and after orgasm.

Masters and Johnson argued that, in the first stage, "accessory organs contract and the male can feel the ejaculation coming; two to three seconds later the ejaculation occurs, which the man cannot constrain, delay, or in any way control" and that, in the second stage, "the male feels pleasurable contractions during ejaculation, reporting greater pleasure tied to a greater volume of ejaculate".&lt;ref name="Dunn"/&gt; They reported that, unlike females, "for the man the resolution phase includes a superimposed refractory period" and added that "many males below the age of 30, but relatively few thereafter, have the ability to ejaculate frequently and are subject to only very short refractory periods during the resolution phase". Masters and Johnson equated male orgasm and ejaculation and maintained the necessity for a refractory period between orgasms.&lt;ref name="Dunn"/&gt;

====Subsequent and multiple orgasms====
There has been little scientific study of multiple orgasm in men. In contrast to the two-stage model of male orgasm, Kahn (1939) equalized orgasm and ejaculation and stated that several orgasms can occur and that "indeed, some men are capable of following [an orgasm] up with a third and a fourth" orgasm.&lt;ref name="Dunn"/&gt; Though it is rare for men to achieve multiple orgasms,&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"/&gt; Kahn's assertion that some men are capable of achieving them is supported by men who have reported having multiple, consecutive orgasms, particularly without ejaculation.&lt;ref name="Dunn"/&gt; Males who experience dry orgasms can often produce multiple orgasms, as the refractory period is reduced.&lt;ref name="Dunn"/&gt;

An increased infusion of the [[hormone]] [[oxytocin]] during ejaculation is believed to be chiefly responsible for the refractory period, and the amount by which oxytocin is increased may affect the length of each refractory period.&lt;ref&gt;Panksepp, Jaak (2004). ''Textbook of biological psychiatry.'' [[John Wiley &amp; Sons|Wiley-IEEE]]. p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; Another chemical which is considered to be responsible for the male refractory period is [[prolactin]],&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haake"&gt;{{Cite news | last1 = Haake | first1 = P. | last2 = Exton | first2 = M.S. | last3 = Haverkamp | first3 = J. | last4 = Krämer | first4 = M. | last5 = Leygraf | first5 = N. | last6 = Hartmann | first6 = U. | last7 = Schedlowski | first7 = M. | last8 = Krueger | first8 = T.H.C. | date = April 2002 | title = Absence of orgasm-induced prolactin secretion in a healthy multi-orgasmic male subject | periodical = International Journal of Impotence Research | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 133–135 | url = http://www.nature.com/ijir/journal/v14/n2/full/3900823a.html | doi = 10.1038/sj/ijir/3900823 | accessdate = 2007-07-30 | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Anecdotal reports on cabergoline suggest it may be able to eliminate the refractory period altogether, allowing men to experience multiple ejaculatory orgasms in rapid succession. At least one scientific study supports these claims,&lt;ref name="Prolactin"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Krüger TH, Haake P, Haverkamp J, et al. |title=Effects of acute prolactin manipulation on sexual drive and function in males |journal=The Journal of Endocrinology |volume=179 |issue=3 |pages=357–65 |date=December 2003 |pmid=14656205 |doi=10.1677/joe.0.1790357}}&lt;/ref&gt; although cabergoline is a hormone-altering drug and has many potential side effects. It has not been approved for treating sexual dysfunction.&lt;ref name="Prolactin"/&gt;

Another possible reason for the lack or absence of a refractory period in men may be an increased infusion of the hormone [[oxytocin]]. It is believed that the amount by which oxytocin is increased may affect the length of each refractory period. A scientific study to successfully document natural, fully ejaculatory, multiple orgasms in an adult man was conducted at [[Rutgers University]] in 1995. During the study, six fully ejaculatory orgasms were experienced in 36 minutes, with no apparent refractory period.&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first=B. | last=Whipple |author2=B.

====Orgasmic factors and variabilities====
In women, the most common way to achieve orgasm is by direct sexual stimulation of the [[clitoris]] (meaning consistent [[Fingering (sexual act)|manual]], [[Oral sex|oral]] or other concentrated friction against the external parts of the clitoris).

====Clitoral and vaginal categories====
Discussions of female orgasm are complicated by orgasms in women typically being divided into two categories: clitoral orgasm and vaginal (or G-spot) orgasm.&lt;ref name="Mah"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sex and Society" /&gt; In 1973, [[Irving Singer]] theorized that there are three types of female orgasms; he categorized these as [[vulva]]l, uterine, and blended, but because he was a philosopher, "these categories were generated from descriptions of orgasm in literature rather than laboratory studies".&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"/&gt; In 1982, Ladas, [[Beverly Whipple|Whipple]] and Perry also proposed three categories: the tenting type (derived from clitoral stimulation), the A-frame type (derived from G-spot stimulation), and the blended type (derived from clitoral and G-spot stimulation).&lt;ref name="Bolin &amp; Whelehan"&gt;{{cite book|title=Human Sexuality: Biological, Psychological, and Cultural Perspectives|isbn = 978-0-7890-2672-9|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|year=2009|page=276|accessdate=11 February 2012|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lDQoIhOwwdYC&amp;pg=PA276|author1=Anne Bolin |author2=Patricia Whelehan }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, Whipple and Komisaruk proposed [[cervix]] stimulation as being able to cause a fourth type of female orgasm.&lt;ref name="Bolin &amp; Whelehan"/&gt;

Female orgasms by means other than clitoral or vaginal/G-spot stimulation are less prevalent in scientific literature&lt;ref name="Mah"/&gt; and most scientists contend that no distinction should be made between "types" of female orgasm.&lt;ref name="Sex and Society"/&gt; This distinction began with [[Sigmund Freud]], who postulated the concept of "vaginal orgasm" as separate from clitoral orgasm.&lt;!-- NOTE: Rules are "promulgated"; theories are "postulated."--&gt; In 1905, Freud stated that clitoral orgasms are purely an adolescent phenomenon and that upon reaching puberty, the proper response of mature women is a change-over to vaginal orgasms, meaning orgasms without any clitoral stimulation. While Freud provided no evidence for this basic assumption, the consequences of this theory were considerable. Many women felt inadequate when they could not achieve orgasm via vaginal intercourse alone, involving little or no clitoral stimulation, as Freud's theory made penile-vaginal intercourse the central component to women's sexual satisfaction.&lt;ref name="Zastrow"&gt;{{cite book | author= Charles Zastrow|author-link = Charles Zastrow|title = Introduction to Social Work and Social Welfare: Empowering People | publisher =[[Cengage Learning]]|year= 2007|page=228|accessdate = March 15, 2014| isbn = 978-0495095101 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tco4YjyZab4C&amp;pg=PT248}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Irvine"&gt;{{cite book|title=Disorders of Desire: Sexuality and Gender in Modern American Sexology|isbn =978-1-59213-151-8|publisher=Temple University Press|year=2005|pages=37–38|accessdate=3 January 2012|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uIJXT7ZCTCsC&amp;pg=PA37|author=Janice M.

The first major national surveys of sexual behavior were the [[Kinsey Reports]].&lt;ref name="Andersen"/&gt; [[Alfred Kinsey]] was the first researcher to harshly criticize Freud's ideas about female sexuality and orgasm when, through his interviews with thousands of women,&lt;ref name="Andersen"/&gt; Kinsey found that most of the women he surveyed could not have vaginal orgasms.&lt;ref name="Irvine"/&gt; He "criticized Freud and other theorists for projecting male constructs of sexuality onto women" and "viewed the clitoris as the main center of sexual response" and the vagina as "relatively unimportant" for sexual satisfaction, relaying that "few women inserted fingers or objects into their vaginas when they masturbated". He "concluded that satisfaction from penile penetration [is] mainly psychological or perhaps the result of referred sensation".&lt;ref name="Irvine"/&gt;

Masters and Johnson's research into the female [[Human sexual response cycle|sexual response cycle]], as well as [[Shere Hite]]'s, generally supported Kinsey's findings about female orgasm.&lt;ref name="Hite"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Irvine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Archer, Lloyd"&gt;{{cite book | title = Sex and Gender | publisher =[[Cambridge University Press]]|year= 2002|pages=85–88| accessdate =25 August 2012| isbn = 978-0521635332|url =https://books.google.com/?id=BJ1V9r_J0sUC&amp;pg=PA85 |author1=John Archer |author2=Barbara Lloyd }}

====Clitoral and vaginal relationships====
{{Further|G-spot#Society and culture}}
Accounts that the vagina is capable of producing orgasms continue to be subject to debate because, in addition to the vagina's low concentration of nerve endings, reports of the G-spot's location are inconsistent—it appears to be nonexistent in some women and may be an extension of another structure, such as the [[Skene's gland]] or the clitoris, which is a part of the Skene's gland.&lt;ref name="O'Connell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pappas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kilchevsky"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Balon, Segraves"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Richard Balon, Robert Taylor Segraves|title=Clinical Manual of Sexual Disorders|publisher=[[American Psychiatric Association|American Psychiatric Pub]]|year=2009|accessdate=January 24, 2014|page=258|isbn=978-1585629053|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YuP3Hb0TMLQC&amp;pg=PA258|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20140126060011/https://books.google.com/books?id=YuP3Hb0TMLQC&amp;pg=PA258|archivedate=January 26, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a January 2012 ''[[The Journal of Sexual Medicine]]'' review examining years of research into the existence of the G-spot, scholars stated that "[r]eports in the public media would lead one to believe the G-spot is a well-characterized entity capable of providing extreme sexual stimulation, yet this is far from the truth".&lt;ref name="Kilchevsky"/&gt;

Possible explanations for the G-spot were examined by Masters and Johnson, who were the first researchers to determine that the clitoral structures surround and extend along and within the labia. In addition to observing that the majority of their female subjects could only have clitoral orgasms, they found that both clitoral and vaginal orgasms had the same stages of physical response. On this basis, they argued that clitoral stimulation is the source of both kinds of orgasms,&lt;ref name="Archer, Lloyd"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Masters and Johnson"/&gt; reasoning that the clitoris is stimulated during penetration by friction against its hood; their notion that this provides the clitoris with sufficient sexual stimulation has been criticized by researchers such as [[Elisabeth Lloyd]].&lt;ref name="Lloyd"/&gt;

Australian [[Urology|urologist]] Helen O'Connell's 2005 research additionally indicates a connection between orgasms experienced vaginally and the clitoris, suggesting that clitoral tissue extends into the anterior wall of the vagina and that therefore clitoral and vaginal orgasms are of the same origin.&lt;ref name="O'Connell"/&gt; Some studies, using [[ultrasound]], have found physiological evidence of the G-spot in women who report having orgasms during vaginal intercourse,&lt;ref name="Acton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Buss, Meston"&gt;{{cite book|authors=David M. Buss, Cindy M. Meston|title=Why Women Have Sex: Understanding Sexual Motivations from Adventure to Revenge (and Everything in Between)|publisher= [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]]|year=2009|accessdate=January 24, 2014|pages=35–36|isbn=978-1429955225|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=slyflT85lXIC&amp;pg=PA35}}&lt;/ref&gt; but O'Connell suggests that the clitoris's interconnected relationship with the vagina is the physiological explanation for the conjectured G-spot. Having used [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] technology which enabled her to note a direct relationship between the legs or roots of the clitoris and the erectile tissue of the "clitoral bulbs" and corpora, and the distal urethra and vagina, she stated that the vaginal wall is the clitoris; that lifting the skin off the vagina on the side walls reveals the bulbs of the clitoris—triangular, crescental masses of erectile tissue.&lt;ref name="O'Connell"/&gt; O'Connell et al., who performed dissections on the female genitals of [[cadaver]]s and used photography to map the structure of nerves in the clitoris, were already aware that the clitoris is more than just its glans and asserted in 1998 that there is more erectile tissue associated with the clitoris than is generally described in anatomical textbooks.&lt;ref name="Sloane"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Archer, Lloyd"/&gt; They concluded that some females have more extensive clitoral tissues and nerves than others, especially having observed this in young cadavers as compared to elderly ones,&lt;ref name="Sloane"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Archer, Lloyd"/&gt; and therefore whereas the majority of females can only achieve orgasm by direct stimulation of the external parts of the clitoris, the stimulation of the more generalized tissues of the clitoris via intercourse may be sufficient for others.&lt;ref name="O'Connell"/&gt;

French researchers Odile Buisson and Pierre Foldès reported similar findings to that of O'Connell's. In 2008, they published the first complete 3D [[Medical ultrasonography|sonography]] of the stimulated clitoris, and republished it in 2009 with new research, demonstrating the ways in which erectile tissue of the clitoris engorges and surrounds the vagina, arguing that women may be able to achieve vaginal orgasm via stimulation of the G-spot because the highly innervated clitoris is pulled closely to the anterior wall of the vagina when the woman is sexually aroused and during vaginal penetration. They assert that since the front wall of the vagina is inextricably linked with the internal parts of the clitoris, stimulating the vagina without activating the clitoris may be next to impossible.&lt;ref name="Pappas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Acton"&gt;See here [https://books.google.com/books?id=amNcvrLCGZEC&amp;pg=PT98] for the 2009 King's College London's findings on the G-spot and [https://books.google.com/books?id=kP9bCflZpVkC&amp;pg=PA145 page 145] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20151028201436/https://books.google.com/books?id=kP9bCflZpVkC&amp;pg=PA145 |date=October 28, 2015 }} for ultrasound/physiological material with regard to the G-spot. {{cite book|author=Ashton Acton|title=Issues in Sexuality and Sexual Behavior Research: 2011 Edition|publisher=[[ScholarlyEditions]]|year=2012|accessdate=January 24, 2014|page=|isbn=978-1464966873|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=slyflT85lXIC&amp;pg=PA35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carroll2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carroll |first=Janell L.|title=Discovery Series: Human Sexuality|edition=1st|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|isbn=978-1111841898|year=2013&lt;!-- NOTE: Copyright date is 2013 inside of the book. --&gt;|page=103|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gU3SZSh-eXsC&amp;pg=PT135|accessdate=2015-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Buisson and Foldès 2009"&gt;{{cite journal  |last=Buisson|first=Odile|last2=Foldès  |first2=Pierre|title=The clitoral complex: a dynamic sonographic study|journal=[[The Journal of Sexual Medicine]]|volume= 6|issue= 5|pages= 1223–31|year=2009 |pmid=19453931|doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2009.01231.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their 2009 published study, the "coronal planes during perineal contraction and finger penetration demonstrated a close relationship between the root of the clitoris and the anterior vaginal wall". Buisson and Foldès suggested "that the special sensitivity of the lower anterior vaginal wall could be explained by pressure and movement of clitoris's root during a vaginal penetration and subsequent perineal contraction".&lt;ref name="Acton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Buisson and Foldès 2009"/&gt;

Supporting a distinct G-spot is a study by [[Rutgers University]], published 2011, which was the first to map the female genitals onto the sensory portion of the brain;&lt;ref name="Komisaruk 2"/&gt; brain scans showed that the brain registered distinct feelings between stimulating the clitoris, the cervix and the vaginal wall&amp;nbsp;– where the G-spot is reported to be&amp;nbsp;– when several women stimulated themselves in a [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|functional magnetic resonance]] (fMRI) machine.&lt;ref name="Komisaruk 2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pappas"/&gt; "I think that the bulk of the evidence shows that the G-spot is not a particular thing," stated Barry Komisaruk, head of the research findings. "It's not like saying, 'What is the thyroid gland?' The G-spot is more of a thing like New York City is a thing. It's a region, it's a convergence of many different structures."&lt;ref name="Kilchevsky"/&gt; Commenting on Komisaruk's research and other findings, Emmanuele Jannini, a professor of endocrinology at the University of Aquila in Italy, acknowledged a series of essays published in March 2012 in ''The Journal of Sexual Medicine'', which document evidence that vaginal and clitoral orgasms are separate phenomena that activate different areas of the brain and possibly suggest key psychological differences between women.&lt;ref name="Pappas"/&gt;

====Other factors and research====
Regular difficulty reaching orgasm after ample sexual stimulation, known as [[anorgasmia]], is significantly more common in women than in men ([[#Dysfunction and satisfaction|see below]]).&lt;ref name="Anorgasmia"/&gt; In addition to sexual dysfunction being a cause for women's inability to reach orgasm, or the amount of time for sexual arousal needed to reach orgasm being variable and longer in women than in men, other factors include a lack of communication between sexual partners about what is needed for the woman to reach orgasm, feelings of sexual inadequacy in either partner, a focus on only penetration (vaginal or otherwise), and men generalizing women's trigger for orgasm based on their own sexual experiences with other women.&lt;ref name="Weiten"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wallen K, Lloyd EA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Flaherty"/&gt;

Scholars state "many couples are locked into the idea that orgasms should be achieved only through intercourse [vaginal sex]" and that "[e]ven the word ''[[foreplay]]'' suggests that any other form of sexual stimulation is merely preparation for the 'main event.'... ...Because women reach orgasm through intercourse less consistently than men, they are more likely than men to have [[Fake orgasm|faked an orgasm]]".&lt;ref name="Weiten"/&gt; Sex counselor [[Ian Kerner]] stated, "It's a myth that using the penis is the main way to pleasure a woman." He cites research concluding that women reach orgasm about 25% of the time with intercourse, compared with 81% of the time during oral sex ([[cunnilingus]]).&lt;ref name="Rob Baedeker"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rob|first=Baedeker|title=Sex: Fact and Fiction|publisher=[[WebMD]]|pages=2–3|accessdate=28 November 2012|url=http://men.webmd.com/features/sex-fact-fiction?page=2|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112134913/http://men.webmd.com/features/sex-fact-fiction?page=2|archivedate=January 12, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first large-scale empirical study worldwide to link specific practices with orgasm, reported in the ''[[Journal of Sex Research]]'' in 2006, demographic and sexual history variables were comparatively weakly associated with orgasm. Data was analyzed from the Australian Study of Health and Relationships, a national telephone survey of sexual behavior and attitudes and sexual health knowledge carried out in 2001–2002, with a representative sample of 19,307 Australians aged 16 to 59. Practices included "vaginal intercourse alone (12%), vaginal + manual stimulation of the man's and/or woman's genitals (49%), and vaginal intercourse + manual + oral (32%)" and the "[e]ncounters may also have included other practices. Men had an orgasm in 95% of encounters and women in 69%. Generally, the more practices engaged in, the higher a woman's chance of having an orgasm. Women were more likely to reach orgasm in encounters including cunnilingus".&lt;ref name="Richters J"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sexual practices at last heterosexual encounter and occurrence of orgasm in a national survey|journal=[[The Journal of Sex Research]]|date=August 2006 |pmid=17599244 |doi=10.1080/00224490609552320 |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=217–26 |vauthors=Richters J, Visser R, Rissel C, Smith A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies suggest that women exposed to lower levels of prenatal [[androgen]]s are more likely to experience orgasm during vaginal intercourse than other women.&lt;ref name="Wallen K, Lloyd EA"/&gt;

==== Exercise-induced ====
Kinsey, in his 1953 book ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Female'', stated that exercise could bring about sexual pleasure, including orgasm.&lt;ref name=1990Rev&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Butt|first1=DS|title=The sexual response as exercise.

For women, penile-anal penetration may also indirectly stimulate the clitoris by the shared sensory nerves, especially the [[pudendal nerve]], which gives off the [[inferior anal nerves]] and divides into the [[perineal nerve]] and the [[dorsal nerve of clitoris|dorsal nerve of the clitoris]].&lt;ref name="Answer"/&gt; The G-spot area, considered to be interconnected with the clitoris,&lt;ref name="O'Connell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Answer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kilchevsky"/&gt; may also be accessible through anal penetration; besides the shared anatomy of the aforementioned sensory nerves, orgasm by indirect stimulation of the clitoris or G-spot area through anal penetration may be aided by the close proximity between the vaginal cavity and the rectal cavity.&lt;ref name="Zdrok"&gt;{{cite book |first=Victoria|last=Zdrok| title = The Anatomy of Pleasure | publisher =Infinity Publishing|year = 2004|pages=100–102|accessdate = July 5, 2013| isbn = 978-0741422484 |url =https://books.google.com/books?id=Cx62zwSwbcsC&amp;pg=PA100}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Taormino"&gt;See [https://books.google.com/books?id=bG8XqRO6rRQC&amp;pg=PA3 page 3] for women preferring anal sex to vaginal sex, and [https://books.google.com/books?id=bG8XqRO6rRQC&amp;pg=PA15 page 15] for reaching orgasm through indirect stimulation of the G-spot. {{cite book|author=Tristan Taormino|author-link=Tristan Taormino|title=The Ultimate Guide to Anal Sex for Women|isbn = 978-1-57344-221-3|publisher=Cleis Press|year=1997|pages=282 pages|accessdate=November 6, 2011|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hLv1ohTIiicC}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Achieving orgasm solely by anal stimulation, however, is rare among women.&lt;ref name="Tarrant"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shira Tarrant|title=Politics: In the Streets and Between the Sheets in the 21st Century|isbn =978-1317814757|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2015|pages=247–248|accessdate=March 11, 2017|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t6nwCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT247}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Valdez"&gt;{{cite book|author =Natasha Janina Valdez|title=Vitamin O: Why Orgasms Are Vital to a Woman's Health and Happiness, and How to Have Them Every Time!|isbn = 978-1-61608-311-3|publisher=[[Skyhorse Publishing]] Inc.|year=2011|page=79|accessdate=November 6, 2011|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5PsNKTB87isC&amp;pg=PT79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Direct stimulation of the clitoris, a G-spot area, or both, during anal sex can help some women enjoy the activity and reach orgasm from it.&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taormino"/&gt;

===Nipple stimulation===
For women, stimulation of the [[breast]] area during sexual intercourse or [[foreplay]], or solely having the breasts fondled, can create mild to intense orgasms, sometimes referred to as a ''breast orgasm'' or ''nipple orgasm''.&lt;ref name="Komisaruk 2"/&gt; Few women report experiencing orgasm from nipple stimulation.&lt;ref name="Boston"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kinsey"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Alfred C.

An orgasm is believed to occur in part because of the hormone [[oxytocin]], which is produced in the body during sexual excitement and arousal and labor. It has also been shown that oxytocin is produced when a man or woman's nipples are stimulated and become erect.&lt;ref name="Komisaruk 2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Levin R, Meston C |title=Nipple/Breast stimulation and sexual arousal in young men and women |journal=The Journal of Sexual Medicine |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=450–4 |date=May 2006 |pmid=16681470 |doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2006.00230.x|citeseerx=10.1.1.421.7798 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Komisaruk also relayed, however, that preliminary data suggests that nipple nerves may directly link up with the relevant parts of the brain without uterine mediation, acknowledging the men in his study who showed the same pattern of nipple stimulation activating genital brain regions.&lt;ref name="Komisaruk 2"/&gt;

==Medical aspects==

===Physiological responses===
Masters and Johnson were some of the first researchers to study the sexual response cycle in the early 1960s, based on the observation of 382 women and 312 men. They described a cycle that begins with excitement as blood rushes into the genitals, then reaches a plateau during which they are fully aroused, which leads to orgasm, and finally resolution, in which the blood leaves the genitals.&lt;ref name="M&amp;J"/&gt;

In the 1970s, [[Helen Singer Kaplan]] added the category of desire to the cycle, which she argued precedes sexual excitation. She stated that emotions of anxiety, defensiveness and the failure of communication can interfere with desire and orgasm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Kaplan HS |title=Hypoactive sexual desire |journal=[[Journal of Sex &amp; Marital Therapy]] |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=3–9 |year=1977 |pmid=864734|doi=10.1080/00926237708405343}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1980s and after, Rosemary Basson proposed a more cyclical alternative to what had largely been viewed as linear progression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | first=Martin | last=Portner | title=The Orgasmic Mind: The Neurological Roots of Sexual Pleasure | date=15 May 2008 | url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-orgasmic-mind | work=Scientific American | accessdate=16 July 2009 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102222534/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-orgasmic-mind | archivedate=November 2, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In her model, desire feeds arousal and orgasm, and is in turn fueled by the rest of the orgasmic cycle. Rather than orgasm being the peak of the sexual experience, she suggested that it is just one point in the circle and that people could feel sexually satisfied at any stage, reducing the focus on climax as an end-goal of all sexual activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Basson R |title=The female sexual response: a different model |journal=[[Journal of Sex &amp; Marital Therapy]] |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=51–65 |year=2000 |pmid=10693116 |doi=10.1080/009262300278641}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Males====
As a man nears orgasm during stimulation of the penis, he feels an intense and highly pleasurable pulsating sensation of [[Neuromuscular junction|neuromuscular]] [[euphoria]]. These pulses are a series of throbbing sensations of the [[bulbospongiosus muscle]]s that begin in the anal sphincter and travel to the [[glans penis|tip of the penis]]. They eventually increase in speed and intensity as the orgasm approaches, until a final "plateau" (the orgasmic) pleasure sustained for several seconds.&lt;ref name="Dunn"/&gt; The length of a man's orgasm has been estimated at 10–15 seconds on average, though it is possible for them to last up to 30 seconds.

During orgasm, a human male experiences rapid, rhythmic contractions of the [[anus|anal sphincter]], the prostate, and the muscles of the penis. The [[sperm]] are transmitted up the [[vas deferens]] from the [[testicles]], into the prostate gland as well as through the [[seminal vesicle]]s to produce what is known as [[semen]].&lt;ref name="Dunn"/&gt; The prostate produces a secretion that forms one of the components of ejaculate. Except for in cases of a dry orgasm, contraction of the sphincter and prostate force stored semen to be expelled through [[External urethral orifice (male)|the penis's urethral opening]]. The process takes from three to ten seconds, and produces a pleasurable feeling.&lt;ref name="Mah"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dunn"/&gt; Ejaculation may continue for a few seconds after the euphoric sensation gradually tapers off. It is believed that the exact feeling of "orgasm" varies from one man to another.&lt;ref name="Mah"/&gt; Normally, as a man ages, the amount of semen he ejaculates diminishes, and so does the duration of orgasms. This does not normally affect the intensity of pleasure, but merely shortens the duration. After ejaculation, a refractory period usually occurs, during which a man cannot achieve another orgasm. This can last anywhere from less than a minute to several hours or days, depending on age and other individual factors.&lt;ref name=soc/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schacter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weiner &amp; Craighead"/&gt;

Women's orgasms are preceded by erection of the clitoris and moistening of the opening of the vagina. Some women exhibit a [[Flushing (physiology)|sex flush]], a reddening of the skin over much of the body due to increased blood flow to the skin. As a woman nears orgasm, the clitoral glans retracts under the [[clitoral hood]], and the [[labia minora]] (inner lips) become darker. As orgasm becomes imminent, the outer third of the vagina tightens and narrows, while overall the vagina lengthens and dilates and also becomes congested from engorged soft tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Anatomic and physiologic changes during female sexual response | website = Clinical Proceedings | publisher = Association of Reproductive Health Professionals | url = http://www.arhp.org/healthcareproviders/cme/onlinecme/NYNCP/changes.cfm | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080708005232/http://www.arhp.org/healthcareproviders/cme/onlinecme/NYNCP/changes.cfm | archivedate = 2008-07-08 | accessdate =1 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elsewhere in the body, [[myofibroblast]]s of the nipple-[[Areolar connective tissue|areolar]] complex contract, causing erection of the nipples and contraction of the areolar diameter, reaching their maximum at the start of orgasm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=[[Sexual and Relationship Therapy]] | volume=21 | issue=1 | pages=237–249 | url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/csmt/2006/00000021/00000002/art00011 | title=The Breast/Nipple/Areola Complex and Human Sexuality | accessdate=2 April 2011 | date=2 May 2006 | last=Levin | first=Roy | quote=Areola corrugation immediately after orgasm physically signals that orgasm has occurred | doi=10.1080/14681990600674674 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101093637/http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/csmt/2006/00000021/00000002/art00011 | archivedate=January 1, 2016 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A woman experiences full orgasm when her uterus, vagina, anus, and [[human pelvis|pelvic]] muscles undergo a series of rhythmic contractions. Most women find these contractions very pleasurable.

Researchers from the [[University of Groningen|University Medical Center of Groningen]] in the [[Netherlands]] correlated the sensation of orgasm with muscular contractions occurring at a frequency of 8–13&amp;nbsp;Hz centered in the pelvis and measured in the anus. They argue that the presence of this particular frequency of contractions can distinguish between voluntary contraction of these muscles and spontaneous involuntary contractions, and appears to more accurately correlate with orgasm as opposed to other metrics like heart rate that only measure excitation. They assert that they have identified "[t]he first objective and quantitative measure that has a strong correspondence with the subjective experience that orgasm ultimately is" and state that the measure of contractions that occur at a frequency of 8–13&amp;nbsp;Hz is specific to orgasm. They found that using this metric they could distinguish from rest, voluntary muscular contractions, and even unsuccessful orgasm attempts.&lt;ref name = "Kortekaas 2008"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=van Netten JJ, Georgiadis JR, Nieuwenburg A, Kortekaas R |title=8–13 Hz fluctuations in rectal pressure are an objective marker of clitorally-induced orgasm in women |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=279–85 |date=April 2008 |pmid=17186125 |doi=10.1007/s10508-006-9112-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since ancient times in Western Europe, women could be [[Medical diagnosis|medically diagnosed]] with a disorder called [[female hysteria]], the symptoms of which included faintness, nervousness, insomnia, fluid retention, heaviness in abdomen, muscle spasm, shortness of breath, irritability, loss of appetite for food or sex, and "a tendency to cause trouble".&lt;ref name=Maines&gt;{{cite book |author=Maines, Rachel P. |title=The Technology of Orgasm: "Hysteria", the Vibrator, and Women's Sexual Satisfaction |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-8018-6646-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women considered suffering from the condition would sometimes undergo "pelvic massage" — [[Fingering (sexual act)|stimulation of the genitals]] by the doctor until the woman experienced "hysterical paroxysm" (i.e., orgasm). Paroxysm was regarded as a medical treatment, and not a sexual release.&lt;ref name=Maines/&gt; The disorder has ceased to be recognized as a medical condition since the 1920s.

===Brain===
There have been very few studies correlating orgasm and brain activity in real time. One study examined 12 healthy women using a [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) scanner while they were being stimulated by their partners. Brain changes were observed and compared between states of rest, sexual stimulation, faked orgasm, and actual orgasm. Differences were reported in the brains of men and women during stimulation. However, changes in brain activity were observed in both sexes in which the brain regions associated with behavioral control, fear and anxiety shut down. Regarding these changes, [[Gert Holstege]] said in an interview with ''[[The Times]]'', "What this means is that deactivation, letting go of all fear and anxiety, might be the most important thing, even necessary, to have an orgasm."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first=Mark | last=Henderson | title=Women fall into 'trance' during orgasm | date=20 June 2005 |  url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/health/article1964119.ece |work=[[The Times]]|accessdate =8 December 2011 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While stroking the clitoris, the parts of the female brain responsible for processing fear, anxiety and behavioral control start to diminish in activity. This reaches a peak at orgasm when the female brain's emotion centers are effectively closed down to produce an almost trance-like state. Holstege is quoted as saying, at the 2005 meeting of the European Society for Human Reproduction and Development: "At the moment of orgasm, women do not have any emotional feelings."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | first=Martin | last=Portner | title=The Orgasmic Mind: The Neurological Roots of Sexual Pleasure | date=15 May 2008 | url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-orgasmic-mind | work=Scientific American | accessdate=7 July 2009 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102222534/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-orgasmic-mind | archivedate=November 2, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial reports indicated that it was difficult to observe the effects of orgasm on men using PET scans, because the duration of the male orgasm was shorter. However, a subsequent report by Rudie Kortekaas, et al. stated, "Gender commonalities were most evident during orgasm... From these results, we conclude that during the sexual act, differential brain responses across genders are principally related to the stimulatory (plateau) phase and not to the orgasmic phase itself."&lt;ref name="Georgiadis"/&gt;

Research has shown that as in women, the emotional centers of a man's brain also become deactivated during orgasm but to a lesser extent than in women. Brain scans of both sexes have shown that the [[pleasure center]]s of a man's brain show more intense activity than in women during orgasm.&lt;ref&gt;''The Scientific American Book of Love, Sex, and the Brain: The Neuroscience of How, When, Why, and Who we love'', Judith Horstman (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Human [[Electroencephalography|brain wave]] patterns show distinct changes during orgasm, which indicate the importance of the limbic system in the orgasmic response.&lt;ref name=health.discovery.com/&gt; Male and female brains demonstrate similar changes during orgasm, with brain activity scans showing a temporary decrease in the [[metabolism|metabolic]] activity of large parts of the [[cerebral cortex]] with normal or increased metabolic activity in the limbic areas of the brain.&lt;ref name="Georgiadis"/&gt;

[[EEG]] tracings from volunteers during orgasm were first obtained by Mosovich and Tallaferro in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1954 |title= Studies on EEG and sex function orgasm |journal=[[The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry|Diseases of the nervous system]]|volume=15|issue=7|pages=218–20|last1= Mosovich |first1=A.|last2= Tallaferro |first2=A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; These research workers recorded EEG changes resembling [[petit mal]] or the clonic phase of a [[grand mal]] seizure.

===Health===

====General====
Orgasm, and sexual activity as a whole, are physical activities that can require exertion of many major bodily systems. A 1997 study in the ''[[BMJ]]'' based upon 918 men age 45–59 found that after a ten-year follow-up, men who had fewer orgasms were twice as likely to die of any cause as those having two or more orgasms a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/315/7123/1641|title=Sex and Death: Are They Related?

(Note that as a rule, [[correlation does not imply causation]].)

There is some research suggesting that greater resting heart rate variability is associated with orgasms through penile-vaginal intercourse without additional simultaneous clitoral stimulation.&lt;ref name="Pappas"/&gt;

A small percentage of men have a disease called [[postorgasmic illness syndrome]] (POIS), which causes severe muscle pain throughout the body and other symptoms immediately following [[ejaculation]].

====Dysfunction and satisfaction====
The inability to have orgasm, or regular difficulty reaching orgasm after ample sexual stimulation, is called [[anorgasmia]] or inorgasmia.&lt;ref name="Bullough"&gt;{{cite book |authors=Vern L Bullough, RN, PhD, Faan, Vern L.

Kinsey's ''[[Kinsey Reports|Sexual Behavior in the Human Female]]'' showed that, over the previous five years of sexual activity, 78% of women had orgasms in 60% to 100% of [[Women who have sex with women|sexual encounters with other women]], compared with 55% for heterosexual sex.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Kinsey|Kinsey, A.]]; [[Wardell Pomeroy|Pomeroy, W.]]; [[Clyde Martin|Martin, C.]], &amp; [[Paul Gebhard|Gebhard, P.]] ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Female'', Philadelphia: Saunders (1953), {{ISBN|978-0-253-33411-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Kinsey attributed this difference to female partners knowing more about women's sexuality and how to optimize women's sexual satisfaction than male partners do.&lt;ref name="Weiten"/&gt; Like Kinsey, scholars such as Peplau, Fingerhut and Beals (2004) and Diamond (2006) found that lesbians have orgasms more often and more easily in sexual interactions than heterosexual women do,&lt;ref name="Weiten"/&gt; and that female partners are more likely to emphasize the emotional aspects of lovemaking.&lt;ref name="Weiten"/&gt; In contrast, research by Diane Holmberg and Karen L.

Specifically in relation to simultaneous orgasm and similar practices, many sexologists claim that the problem of [[premature ejaculation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sexarchive.info/IES/italy.html |title=The International Encyclopedia of Sexuality: Italy |publisher=.hu-berlin.de |date=1 January 1999 |accessdate=15 October 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305193730/http://www.sexarchive.info/IES/italy.html |archivedate=March 5, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; is closely related to the idea encouraged by a scientific approach in the early 20th century when mutual orgasm was overly emphasized as an objective and a sign of true sexual satisfaction in intimate relationships.

If orgasm is desired, anorgasmia may be attributed to an inability to relax. It may be associated with performance pressure and an unwillingness to pursue pleasure, as separate from the other person's satisfaction; often, women worry so much about the pleasure of their partner that they become anxious, which manifests as impatience with the delay of orgasm for them. This delay can lead to frustration of not reaching orgasmic sexual satisfaction.&lt;ref name="Carroll 2"/&gt; Psychoanalyst [[Wilhelm Reich]], in his 1927 book ''[[Die Funktion des Orgasmus]]'' (published in English in 1980 as ''Genitality in the Theory and Therapy of Neurosis'') was the first to make orgasm central to the concept of mental health, and defined [[neurosis]] in terms of blocks to having [[orgastic potency]]. Although orgasm dysfunction can have psychological components, physiological factors often play a role. For instance, delayed orgasm or the inability to achieve orgasm is a common side effect of many medications.

[[Menopause]] may involve loss of hormones supporting sexuality and genital functionality. Vaginal and clitoral atrophy and dryness affects up to 50%–60% of postmenopausal women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid = 10022110 | volume=281 | issue=6 | title=Sexual dysfunction in the United States: prevalence and predictors | date=February 1999 | journal=JAMA | pages=537–44 |vauthors=Laumann EO, Paik A, Rosen RC |doi = 10.1001/jama.281.6.537}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Testosterone levels in men fall as they age.

==Theoretical biological and evolutionary functions of female orgasm{{anchor|Theoretical_biological_and_evolutionary_functions}}==

===Shifts in research===
The function or functions of the human female orgasm have been debated among researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wheatley|first1=John R|last2=Puts|first2=David A|editor1-last=Shackelford|editor1-first=Todd K|editor2-last=Hansen|editor2-first=Ranald D|title=The Evolution of Sexuality|date=2015|publisher=Springer International Publishing|chapter=Evolutionary Science of Female Orgasm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because male orgasms that expel [[sperm]] from the body into the vagina during sexual intercourse may result in conception, researchers have several hypotheses about the role, if any, of the female orgasm in the reproductive and therefore evolutionary process.&lt;ref name="Geoffrey Miller"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wallen K, Lloyd EA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lloyd"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gould"/&gt; The literature started with the argument that female orgasm is a byproduct of shared early male ontogeny, where male orgasm is an [[adaptation]].&lt;ref&gt;Symons, D. (1979). The evolution of human sexuality. Oxford: Oxford Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shifted to investigate and also support the sire-choice hypothesis, which proposes that female orgasm has been shaped by [[natural selection]] to function in the selection of high quality sires (male parents) for offspring. Therefore, orgasm increases the chances of conceiving with males of a high genetic quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Puts | first1 = D.

===Selective pressure and mating===
Wallen K and Lloyd EA stated, "In men, orgasms are under strong selective pressure as orgasms are coupled with ejaculation and thus contribute to male reproductive success. By contrast, women's orgasms in intercourse are highly variable and are under little selective pressure as they are not a reproductive necessity."&lt;ref name="Wallen K, Lloyd EA"/&gt;

[[Desmond Morris]] suggested in his 1967 popular-science book ''[[The Naked Ape]]'' that the female orgasm evolved to encourage physical intimacy with a male partner and help reinforce the [[pair bond]]. Morris suggested that the relative difficulty in achieving female orgasm, in comparison to the male's, might be favorable in [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] evolution by leading the female to select [[Mating|mates]] who bear qualities like patience, care, imagination, intelligence, as opposed to qualities like size and aggression, which pertain to mate selection in other primates. Such advantageous qualities thereby become accentuated within the species, driven by the differences between male and female orgasm. If males were motivated by, and taken to the point of, orgasm in the same way as females, those advantageous qualities would not be needed, since self-interest would be enough.

===Fertility===

There are theories that the female orgasm might increase fertility.&lt;ref name="Geoffrey Miller"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lloyd"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gould"/&gt; For example, the 30% reduction in size of the vagina could help clench onto the penis (much like, or perhaps caused by, the [[pubococcygeus muscle]]s), which would make it more stimulating for the male (thus ensuring faster or more voluminous ejaculation). The British biologists Baker and Bellis have suggested that the female orgasm may have a [[peristalsis]] or "upsuck" action (similar to the [[esophagus]]' ability to swallow when upside down), resulting in the retaining of favorable sperm and making conception more likely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1006/anbe.1993.1272 |last=Baker |first=R. R. |last2=Bellis |first2=M. A. |year=1993 |title=Human sperm competition: Ejaculate manipulation by females and a function for the female orgasm |journal=Animal Behaviour |volume=46 |issue=5 |pages=887–909 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; They posited a role of female orgasm in [[sperm competition]].

The observation that women tend to reach orgasm more easily when they are ovulating also suggests that it is tied to increasing fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Adam |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2005/jun/08/genetics.research |department=Science |date=8 June 2005 |title=Female orgasm all in the genes |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302095146/https://www.theguardian.com/science/2005/jun/08/genetics.research |archivedate=March 2, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionary biologist Robin Baker argues in ''[[Sperm Wars]]'' that occurrence and timing of orgasms are all a part of the female body's unconscious strategy to collect and retain sperm from more evolutionarily fit men.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} An orgasm during intercourse functions as a bypass button to a woman's natural cervical filter against sperm and pathogens. An orgasm before functions to strengthen the filter.

Desmond Morris proposed that orgasm might facilitate conception by exhausting the female and keeping her horizontal, thus preventing the sperm from leaking out. This possibility, sometimes called the "Poleaxe Hypothesis" or the "Knockout Hypothesis",  is now considered highly doubtful. A 1994 [[TLC (TV channel)|Learning Channel]] documentary on sex had fiber optic cameras inside the vagina of a woman while she had sexual intercourse. During her orgasm, her [[Pelvic floor|pelvic muscles]] contracted and her [[Vaginal portion of cervix|cervix]] repeatedly dipped into a pool of semen in the [[vaginal fornix]], as if to ensure that sperm would proceed by the [[external orifice of the uterus]], making conception more likely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people=[[Desmond Morris]] (host) |date=1994 | title=[[The Human Animal (TV series)|The Human Animal]] | medium=TV | publisher=The Learning Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolutionary psychologists Christopher Ryan and Cacilda Jethá, in their discussion of the female orgasm, address how long it takes for females to achieve orgasm compared to males, and females' ability to have multiple orgasms, hypothesizing how especially well suited to multiple partners and [[insemination]] this is. They quote [[primate sexuality]] specialist Alan Dixson in saying that the monogamy-maintenance explanation for female orgasm "seems far-fetched" because "females of other primate species, and particularly those with multimale-multifemale [promiscuous] mating systems such as macaques and chimpanzees, exhibit orgasmic responses in the absence of such bonding or the formation of stable family units." On the other hand, Dixson states that "Gibbons, which are primarily monogamous, do not exhibit obvious signs of female orgasm."&lt;ref name="Ryan"&gt;{{cite book |title=Sex at Dawn |isbn=978-0062207944 |publisher=HarperCollins |year=2012 |page=263 |last=Ryan |first=Christopher |first2=Cacilda |last2=Jethá}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[female promiscuity]] explanation of female sexuality was echoed at least 12 years earlier by other evolutionary biologists, and there is increasing scientific awareness of the female [[proceptive phase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Browne |first=Anthony |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/sep/03/anthonybrowne.theobserver |title=Women are promiscuous, naturally |department=UK News |date=2 September 2000 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304225027/http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/sep/03/anthonybrowne.theobserver |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Dixson classifies humans as mildly polygynous in his survey of primate sexuality, he appears to have doubts, when he writes, "One might argue that ... the female's orgasm is rewarding, increases her willingness to copulate with a variety of males rather than one partner, and thus promotes sperm competition." Ryan and Jethá use this as evidence for their theory that [[partible paternity]] and promiscuity were common for early modern humans.&lt;ref name="Ryan"/&gt;

The clitoris is [[homology (biology)|homologous]] to the penis; that is, they both develop from the same embryonic structure.&lt;ref name="Schünke"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Francoeur"/&gt; While researchers such as [[Geoffrey Miller (psychologist)|Geoffrey Miller]], [[Helen Fisher (anthropologist)|Helen Fisher]], [[Meredith Small]] and [[Sarah Blaffer Hrdy]] "have viewed the clitoral orgasm as a legitimate adaptation in its own right, with major implications for female sexual behavior and sexual evolution,"&lt;ref name="Geoffrey Miller"/&gt; others, such as [[Donald Symons]] and [[Stephen Jay Gould]], have asserted that the clitoris is [[vestigiality|vestigial]] or nonadaptive, and that the female orgasm serves no particular evolutionary function.&lt;ref name="Geoffrey Miller"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gould"/&gt; However, Gould acknowledged that "most female orgasms emanate from a clitoral, rather than vaginal (or some other), site" and stated that his nonadaptive belief "has been widely misunderstood as a denial of either the adaptive value of female orgasm in general, or even as a claim that female orgasms lack significance in some broader sense". He explained that although he accepts that "clitoral orgasm plays a pleasurable and central role in female sexuality and its joys," "[a]ll these favorable attributes, however, emerge just as clearly and just as easily, whether the clitoral site of orgasm arose as a [[Spandrel (biology)|spandrel]] or an adaptation". He said that the "male biologists who fretted over [the adaptionist questions] simply assumed that a deeply vaginal site, nearer the region of fertilization, would offer greater selective benefit" due to their Darwinian, ''[[summum bonum]]'' beliefs about enhanced reproductive success.&lt;ref name="Gould"/&gt;

Proponents of the nonadaptive hypothesis, such as Elisabeth Lloyd, refer to the relative difficulty of achieving female orgasm through vaginal sex, the limited evidence for increased fertility after orgasm and the lack of statistical correlation between the capacity of a woman to orgasm and the likelihood that she will engage in intercourse.&lt;ref name="Lloyd"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chivers"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Meredith L. | last = Chivers | first2 = Michael W. | last2 = Wiedermana | title = A Narrow (But Thorough) Examination of the Evolutionary Significance of Female Orgasm | journal = [[Journal of Sex Research]] | volume = 44 | issue = 1 | pages = 104–105 | year = 2007 | pmid =  | doi = 10.1080/00224490709336797 | deadurl = no | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Lloyd is by no means against evolutionary psychology. Quite the opposite; in her methods and in her writing, she advocates and demonstrates a commitment to the careful application of evolutionary theory to the study of human behavior," stated [[Meredith Chivers|Meredith L. Chivers]]. She added that Lloyd "meticulously considers the theoretical and empirical bases for each account and ultimately concludes that there is little evidence to support an adaptionist account of female orgasm" and that Lloyd instead "views female orgasm as an ontogenetic leftover; women have orgasms because the urogenital neurophysiology for orgasm is so strongly selected for in males that this developmental blueprint gets expressed in females without affecting fitness, just as males have nipples that serve no fitness-related function".&lt;ref name="Chivers"/&gt;

A 2005 [[twin study]] found that one in three women reported never or seldom achieving orgasm during sexual intercourse, and only one in ten always orgasmed. This variation in ability to orgasm, generally thought to be psychosocial, was found to be 34% to 45% genetic. The study, examining 4000 women, was published in ''[[Biology Letters]]'', a [[Royal Society]] journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4616899.stm |title=Female orgasm is 'down to genes{{'-}} |work=[[BBC]] |date=7 June 2005 |accessdate=28 May 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161021184246/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4616899.stm |archivedate=October 21, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dunn |first=Kate M |last2=Cherkas |first2=Lynn F |last3=Spector |first3=Tim D |title=Genetic influences on variation in female orgasmic function: a twin study |journal=Biology Letters |type=Abstract |date=22 September 2005 |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=260–263 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2005.0308|pmc=1617159 |pmid=17148182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elisabeth Lloyd has cited this as evidence for the notion that female orgasm is not adaptive.&lt;ref name="Lloyd"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lloyd2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mypage.iu.edu/%7Eealloyd/Reviews.html#IsntItObviousThat |title=Reviews |publisher=Mypage.iu.edu |accessdate=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller, Hrdy, Helen O'Connell and [[Natalie Angier]] have criticized the "female orgasm is vestigial" hypothesis as understating and devaluing the psychosocial value of the female orgasm.&lt;ref name="Geoffrey Miller"/&gt; Hrdy stated that the hypothesis smacks of [[sexism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Christopher Shea| title=Orgasmic science|work=The Boston Globe| date=24 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  O'Connell said, "It boils down to rivalry between the sexes: the idea that one sex is sexual and the other reproductive. The truth is that both are sexual and both are reproductive."&lt;ref name="O'Connell"/&gt; O'Connell used [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] technology to define the true size and shape of the clitoris, suggesting that it extends into the anterior wall of the vagina ([[#In females|see above]]).

O'Connell describes typical textbook descriptions of the clitoris as lacking detail and including inaccuracies, saying that the work of [[Georg Ludwig Kobelt]] in the early 19th century provides a most comprehensive and accurate description of clitoral anatomy. She argues that the bulbs appear to be part of the clitoris and that the distal urethra and vagina are intimately related structures, although they are not erectile in character, forming a tissue cluster with the clitoris that appears to be the center of female sexual function and orgasm.&lt;ref name="O'Connell"/&gt; By contrast, Nancy Tuana, at the 2002 conference for ''Canadian Society of Women in Philosophy'', argues that the clitoris is unnecessary in reproduction, but that this is why it has been "historically ignored", mainly because of "a fear of pleasure. It is pleasure separated from reproduction. That's the fear". She reasoned that this fear is the cause of the ignorance that veils female sexuality.&lt;ref name="Cairney"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cairney|first=Richard|title=Exploring female sexuality|publisher=ExpressNews|date=21 October 2002|accessdate=21 December 2011|url=http://www.expressnews.ualberta.ca/article.cfm?id=3201|archivedate=21 December 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111221175533/http://www.archives.expressnews.ualberta.ca/article/2002/10/3201.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other theories===
Brody Costa et al. suggest that women's vaginal orgasm consistency is associated with being told in childhood or adolescence that the vagina is the important zone for inducing female orgasm. Other proposed factors include how well women focus mentally on vaginal sensations during penile-vaginal intercourse, the greater duration of intercourse, and preference for above-average penis length.&lt;ref name="Brody, Weiss"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Vaginal orgasm is associated with vaginal (not clitoral) sex education, focusing mental attention on vaginal sensations, intercourse duration, and a preference for a longer penis|journal=[[The Journal of Sexual Medicine]]|pages=2774–81 |date=August 2010 |pmid=19732304 |doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2009.01469.x |volume=7 |issue=8 |vauthors=Brody S, Weiss P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Costa theorizes that vaginal orgasm is more prevalent among women with a prominent [[tubercle of the upper lip]].&lt;ref name="Brody, Costa"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Vaginal orgasm is more prevalent among women with a prominent tubercle of the upper lip|journal=[[The Journal of Sexual Medicine]]|date=June 2011 |pmid=21676178 |doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2011.02331.x |volume=8 |issue=10 |pages=2793–9 |vauthors=Brody S, Costa RM }}&lt;/ref&gt; His research indicates that "[a] prominent and sharply raised lip tubercle has been associated with greater odds (odds ratio = 12.3) of ever having a vaginal orgasm, and also with greater past month vaginal orgasm consistency (an effect driven by the women who never had a vaginal orgasm), than less prominent lip tubercle categories." However, lip tubercle was not associated with social desirability responding, or with orgasm triggered by masturbation during penile-vaginal sex, solitary or partner clitoral or vaginal masturbation, vibrator, or cunnilingus.&lt;ref name="Brody, Costa"/&gt;

An empirical study carried out in 2008 provides evidence for Freud's implied link between inability to have a vaginal orgasm and psychosexual [[Defence mechanisms|immaturity]]. In the study, women reported their past month frequency of different sexual behaviors and corresponding orgasm rates and completed the Defense Style Questionnaire (DSQ-40), which is associated with various [[Psychopathology|psychopathologies]]. The study concluded that a "vaginal orgasm was associated with less somatization, dissociation, displacement, autistic fantasy, devaluation, and isolation of affect." Moreover, "vaginally anorgasmic women had immature defenses scores comparable to those of established (depression, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and obsessive–compulsive disorder) outpatient psychiatric groups." In the study, a vaginal orgasm (as opposed to a clitoral orgasm) was defined as being triggered solely by penile–vaginal intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Vaginal orgasm is associated with less use of immature psychological defense mechanisms|journal=[[The Journal of Sexual Medicine]]|pages=1167–1176 |date=May 2008 |doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2008.00786.x |pmid=18331263|author1=Brody S |author2=Costa R.M. |volume=5|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Wilhelm Reich]], the lack of women's capacity to have a vaginal orgasm is due to a lack of [[orgastic potency]], which he believed to be the result of culture's suppression of genital sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Reich, Wilhelm (1984) Children of the Future: On the Prevention of Sexual Pathology. New York: Farrar Straus and Giroux, footnote on p. 142: "1949: The statement that the girl's clitoral masturbation is normal is also due to the then prevalent psychoanalytic concept that the little girl had no vaginal genatility. The lack of vaginal genatility was later shown by sex-economy to be an artifact of our culture, which suppresses genitality completely and instills castration anxiety not only in the boy but also in the girl. This creates a true secondary drive in the form of penis envy and predominance of clitoral genitality. Psychoanalytic theory mistook these artificial secondary drives for primary, natural functions."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Involuntary orgasm ==
Medical research shows that the genital reflex is part of the spinal cord, and not necessarily under conscious control.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cKjnCQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT44&amp;ots=hIEz0UlK0O&amp;dq=genital%20reflex&amp;pg=PT45#v=onepage&amp;q=genital%20reflex&amp;f=false "Nervous System: A Tutorial Study Guide" Author Nicoladie Tam 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=I2n5hTAxdTYC&amp;lpg=PA431&amp;ots=izwjpSjtWd&amp;dq=genital%20reflex&amp;pg=PA431#v=onepage&amp;q=genital%20reflex&amp;f=false "Spinal Cord Medicine, Second Edition: Principles &amp; Practice."

Orgasms may thus occur as the result of [[sexual assault]] or [[rape]]. An involuntary orgasm from forced sexual contact often results in feelings of [[shame]] caused by internalization of [[Victim blaming|victim-blaming]] attitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anugraha.info/Traningdownload.php?file=20111213044253Trauma.pdf&amp;arg3=resource&amp;op=center |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227055826/http://www.anugraha.info/Traningdownload.php?file=20111213044253Trauma.pdf&amp;arg3=resource&amp;op=center |dead-url=yes |archive-date=27 December 2013 |accessdate=26 December 2013|title=Trauma Counseling }} D.

Unwanted orgasms may arise as a result of [[persistent genital arousal disorder]].

Lack of control over orgasms may be used as part of consensual [[BDSM]] play; this practice is known as [[forced orgasm]].

==Tantric sex==
[[Tantric sex]], which is not the same as [[Vajrayana|Buddhist tantra (Vajrayana)]], is the ancient Indian spiritual tradition of sexual practices. It attributes a different value to orgasm than traditional cultural approaches to sexuality. Some practitioners of [[Tantra|tantric]] sex aim to eliminate orgasm from sexual intercourse by remaining for a long time in the pre-orgasmic and non-emission state. Advocates of this, such as [[Rajneesh]], claim that it eventually causes orgasmic feelings to spread out to all of one's conscious experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author = Rajneesh, Bhagwan Shree | title = Tantra, Spirituality, and Sex | year= 1983 | isbn = 978-0-88050-696-0 | publisher = Rajneesh Foundation Internat. | location = Rajneeshpuram, Or.}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Chia, Mantak  |author2=Abrams, Douglas  |lastauthoramp=yes | title = The Multi-Orgasmic Man | publisher = Harper San Francisco | year= 1996 | isbn = 978-0-06-251336-6}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates of tantric and neotantric sex who claim that Western culture focuses too much on the goal of climactic orgasm, which reduces the ability to have intense pleasure during other moments of the sexual experience, suggest that eliminating this enables a richer, fuller and more intense connection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Douglas, N  |author2=Slinger, P  |lastauthoramp=yes | title = Sexual Secrets: The Alchemy of Ecstasy | publisher = Destiny Books | year= 1979 | isbn = 978-0-89281-266-0}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
[[File:Carracci - Jupiter et Junon.jpeg|thumb|''[[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]]'', by [[Annibale Carracci]].]]
Orgasm has been widely described in literature over the centuries. In antiquity, [[Latin literature]] addressed the subject as much as [[Greek literature]]: Book III of [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' retells a discussion between [[Jove]] and [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], in which the former states: "The sense of pleasure in the male is far / More dull and dead, than what you females share."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses|Met]].'' III, 320-21 (translated by Sir Samuel Garth, [[John Dryden]], et al, 1717). In the original in [[Latin]], Ovid writes: ''maior vestra profecto est, / quam quae contingit maribus.''&lt;/ref&gt; Juno rejects this thought; they agree to ask the opinion of [[Tiresias]] ("who had known [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]/Love in both ways," having lived seven years as a female).&lt;ref&gt;''Met''. III, 323 (translated by [[A. S. Kline]], 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Tiresias offends Juno by agreeing with Jove, and she strikes him blind on the spot (Jove lessens the blow by giving Tiresias the gift of foresight, and a long life).&lt;ref&gt;''Met.'' III, 335.&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier, in the ''[[Ars Amatoria]]'', Ovid states that he abhors sexual intercourse that fails to complete both partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} ''Jornal de Letras, Artes e Ideias'', Ano XXV/Number 930. 24 May to 6 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theme of orgasm survived during [[Romanticism]] and is incorporated in many [[Homoeroticism|homoerotic]] works. In ''FRAGMENT: Supposed to be an Epithalamium of Francis Ravaillac and Charlotte Cordé'', [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] (1792–1822), "a translator of extraordinary range and versatility",&lt;ref&gt;Webb, 1976, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; wrote the phrase "No life can equal such a death." That phrase has been seen as a [[metaphor]] for orgasm,&lt;ref name="Lauritsen"&gt;"[http://paganpressbooks.com/jpl/HHREV3.HTM Hellenism and Homoeroticism in Shelley and his Circle] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708193419/http://paganpressbooks.com/jpl/HHREV3.HTM |date=July 8, 2008 }}", by John Lauritsen (2008). Consulted on 10 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and it was preceded by the rhythmic urgency of the previous lines "Suck on, suck on, I glow, I glow!", which has been seen as alluding to [[fellatio]].&lt;ref name="Lauritsen" /&gt; For Shelley, orgasm was "the almost involuntary consequences of a state of abandonment in the society of a person of surpassing attractions".&lt;ref&gt;Plato, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Ellerker Williams]], the last love of Shelley's life, was remembered by the poet in "The Boat on the Serchio", which has been considered as possibly "the grandest portrayal of orgasm in literature":&lt;ref name="Lauritsen" /&gt;

Shelley, in this poem, associates orgasm with death when he writes "the death which lovers love".&lt;ref name="Lauritsen" /&gt; In [[French literature]], the term ''[[la petite mort]]'' (the little death) is a famous [[euphemism]] for orgasm;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Georgiadis J, Kortekaas R, Kuipers R, Nieuwenburg A, Pruim J, Reinders A, Holstege G |title=Regional cerebral blood flow changes associated with clitorally induced orgasm in healthy women |journal=Eur J Neurosci |volume=24 |issue=11 |pages=3305–16 |year=2006 |pmid=17156391 |doi=10.1111/j.1460-9568.2006.05206.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is the representation of man who forgets himself and the world during orgasm. [[Jorge Luis Borges]], in the same vision, wrote in one of the several [[footnote]]s of "[[Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius]]" that one of the churches of [[Tlön]] claims [[Platonism|Platonic]]ally that "All men, in the vertiginous moment of coitus, are the same man. All men who repeat a line from [[Shakespeare]] ''are'' William Shakespeare."&lt;ref&gt;Borges, ''Ficciones'', p.28&lt;/ref&gt; Shakespeare himself was knowledgeable of this idea: lines "I will live in thy heart, die in thy lap, and be buried in thy eyes" and "I will die bravely, like a smug bridegroom", said respectively by [[Benedick]] in ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' and by King Lear in [[King Lear|the play of that ilk]],&lt;ref&gt;''MUCH ADO'', v ii 99–101. &amp; ''Lear'', iv vi 201.&lt;/ref&gt; are interpreted as "to die in a woman's lap" = "to experience a sexual orgasm".&lt;ref&gt;Partridge, 2001, p.118.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sigmund Freud]] with his [[psychoanalytic]] projects, in ''[[The Ego and the Id]]'' (1923), speculates that sexual satisfaction by orgasm make [[Eros]] ("life instinct") exhausted and leaves the field open to [[Thanatos]] ("death instinct"), in other words, with orgasm Eros fulfills its mission and gives way to Thanatos.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Sigmund Freud|Freud, Sigmund]]. ''The Ego and the Id''. The Hogarth Press Ltd. London, 1949. Quoted by ''Vida Íntima: Enciclopédia do Amor e do Sexo'', Abril Cultural, Vol. 1, 1981, [[São Paulo]], Brazil, p. 66-67.&lt;/ref&gt; Other modern authors have chosen to represent the orgasm without metaphors. In the novel ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' (1928), by [[D. H. Lawrence]], we can find an explicit narrative of a sexual act between a couple: "As he began to move, in the sudden helpless orgasm there awoke in her strange thrills rippling inside her..."&lt;ref&gt;[[D. H. Lawrence]], New York: Grove Press, 1969, cited by BANKER-RISHKIN; GRANDINETTI, 1997, p.141&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9049">In [[literature]], '''pace''', or '''pacing''' is the speed at which a [[narrative|story]] is told—not necessarily the speed at which the story takes place.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bishop|1988|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Schellhardt|2008|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Turco|1999|pp=67–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The number of words needed to write about a certain event does not depend upon how much time the event takes to happen; it depends upon how important that moment is to the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bauer|1992|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The pace is determined by the length of the [[Scene (drama)|scenes]], how fast the [[Action (narrative)|action]] moves, and how quickly the reader is provided with information.  It is also sometimes dictated by the [[genre]] of the story:  [[Comedy (drama)|comedies]] move faster than [[drama]]s; [[Adventure fiction|action adventures]] move faster than [[Thriller (genre)|suspense]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Schellhardt|2008|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A dragging pace is characteristic of many novels turned down by publishers, and of some that find their way into print but not into the hearts and recommendations of readers.  Most rejected manuscripts move too slowly, encouraging readers to put them down.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Stein|1995|p=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Methods ==
Storytellers have a number of writing tools at their disposal—for example, [[narration]], action, [[description]], and [[Dialogue in writing|dialogue]].  When considering how to pace a story, description and narration will move it along slowly, steadily, and easily, while action and dialogue will speed it up.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kempton|2004|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Of all the tools at a writer's disposal, dialogue is the one that most quickly puts the characters and the reader into the present moment, even more so than action.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kempton|2004|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pace can be increased through:
* flipping forward past a scene that is in the story but never appears in the book&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Stein|1995|p=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* skipping steps in a logical sequence of events&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Stein|1995|p=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* short scenes&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bishop|1988|p=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* frequent paragraphing&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Stein|1995|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* short sentences&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Stein|1995|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* dialogue&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kempton|2004|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Stein|1995|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* action&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kempton|2004|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* active voice and aggressive verbs&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=151–152}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* flab-cutting (removal of superfluous words and phrases, and unnecessary adjectives and adverbs)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Stein|1995|p=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Pace can be decreased through:
* description and narration&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kempton|2004|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* introspection&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bishop|1988|p=241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Weaving ==
While ''dialogue'' is the element that brings a story and the characters to life on the page, ''action'' creates the movement, and ''narrative'' gives the story its depth and substance.  Writing a story means weaving all the elements of fiction together.  When this is done right, weaving dialogue, action, and narrative can create a beautiful tapestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kempton|2004|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pacing is probably the most common fiction element to pay attention to when considering when to and when not to weave dialogue, narrative, and action.  When creating a fast-paced conflict scene between two or more people, a writer might do well to consider only dialogue, at least for parts of it.  Perhaps the characters have just entered into an argument and the writer wants to speed up the scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kempton|2004|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Then there are times when a scene should move slowly, so it is not always best to use dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kempton|2004|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, reading slow-moving dialogue is preferable to reading lengthy passages of philosophical narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kempton|2004|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are scenes in all stories that work best using only narrative or only dialogue or only action.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kempton|2004|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are no definite rules about when to and when not to weave.  To weave well is to find the story's rhythm.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kempton|2004|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variation ==
===Within a story===
A good [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] is an exercise in proper balance.  By staying aware of the scenes' levels of intensity and writing accordingly, a writer can make novels fresh and memorable to their readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bell|2004|pp=127-128}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Beginning writers often give every moment in their stories the same weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bauer|1992|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in writing fiction, they are in charge of the way time moves.  They can pass quickly over what is unimportant, or even skip it entirely.  Then they can stretch out the events their readers care about.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bauer|1992|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is a time for telling and a time for showing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kempton|2004|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most stories are paced not too fast, but too slowly.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kempton|2004|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, there is nothing less exciting than non-stop excitement, so writers must avoid the monotony of constant action and texture the pace.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Saville|2013|p=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Writing should be done with a consciousness of pacing and tension.  In the [[rising action]] of the story, reader interest can be maintained by upping the action ante with each succeeding scene.  The initial obstacle the hero overcomes should be smaller than the one that follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lamb|2008|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Between different stories===
Different kinds of stories call for different kinds of characters, tension, pacing, themes, and dialogue.  A fast-paced action adventure needs fast-paced dialogue in every scene to keep the story moving forward quickly.  Likewise, a literary story needs the dialogue to match the pace of the other elements in the story—it needs to move more slowly.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kempton|2004|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Genre stories generally move quickly, employing more dialogue and action and less slow-paced narrative, because they are generally plot-driven rather than character-driven, like literary and mainstream stories.  The emphasis is on the action that keeps the plot moving rather than the narrative that keeps the character growing.  It pays to know the characters because who they are determines how slowly or quickly they talk.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kempton|2004|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13507">A '''pathosystem''' is a subsystem of an [[ecosystem]] and is defined by the phenomenon of parasitism. A plant pathosystem is one in which the host species is a plant. The [[parasite]] is any species in which the individual spends a significant part of its lifespan inhabiting one host individual and obtaining nutrients from it. The parasite may thus be an [[insect]], [[mite]], [[nematode]], parasitic Angiosperm, [[fungus]], [[bacterium]], [[mycoplasma]], [[virus]] or [[viroid]]. Other consumers, however, such as mammalian and avian herbivores, which graze populations of plants, are normally considered to be outside the conceptual boundaries of the plant pathosystem.&lt;ref name=Robinson87/&gt;

A host has the property of resistance to a parasite. And a parasite has the property of parasitic ability on a host. Parasitism is the interaction of these two properties. The main feature of the pathosystem concept is that it concerns parasitism, and it is not concerned with the study of either the host or parasite on its own. Another feature of the pathosystem concept is that the parasitism is studied in terms of populations, at the higher levels and in ecologic aspects of the system. The pathosystem concept is also multidisciplinary. It brings together various crop science disciplines such as [[entomology]], nematology, [[plant pathology]], and [[plant breeding]]. It also applies to wild populations and to agricultural, horticultural, and forest crops, and to tropical, subtropical, as well as both subsistence and commercial farming.

In a wild plant pathosystem, both the host and the parasite populations exhibit [[genetic diversity]] and genetic flexibility. Conversely, in a [[crop]] pathosystem, the host population normally exhibits genetic uniformity and genetic inflexibility (i.e., clones, pure lines, hybrid varieties), and the parasite population assumes a comparable uniformity. This distinction means that a wild pathosystem can respond to [[selection pressure]]s, but that a crop pathosystem does not. It also means that a system of locking (see below) can function in a wild plant pathosystem but not in a crop pathosystem.

'''''Pathosystem balance''''' means that the parasite does not endanger the survival  of the host; and that the resistance in the host does not endanger the survival of the parasite. This is self-evident from the evolutionary survival of wild plant pathosystems, as systems, during periods of [[geological time]].&lt;ref name=Robinson10&gt;Robinson, R.A.(2010) Self-Organizing Agro-Ecosystems; Sharebooks Publishing http://www.sharebookspublishing.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The gene-for-gene relationship&lt;ref&gt;Flor, H.H. (1942); “Inheritance of pathogenicity in Melampsora lini.” Phytopath., 32; 653-669.&lt;/ref&gt; is an approximate botanical equivalent of [[antigen]]s and [[Antibody|antibodies]] in mammals. For each resistance  gene in the host, there is a corresponding, or matching, [[gene]] in the parasite. When the genes of the parasite match those of the host, the resistance does not operate.

There are two kinds of resistance to parasites in plants:

* '''Vertical resistance'''&lt;ref name=Vanderplank63&gt;Vanderplank, J.E. (1963); “Plant Diseases; Epidemics and Control.” Academic Press, New York &amp; London, 349pp.&lt;/ref&gt; involves a gene-for-gene relationship. This kind of resistance is genetically controlled by single genes, although several such genes may be present in a single host or parasite individual. [[Vertical resistance]] is ephemeral resistance because it operates against some strains of the parasite but not others,&lt;ref name=Vanderplank63/&gt; depending on whether or not a match occurs. In [[agriculture]], vertical resistance requires pedigree breeding and [[back-crossing]]. It has been the resistance of choice during the twentieth century.
* '''Horizontal resistance'''&lt;ref name=Vanderplank63/&gt; does not involve a gene-for-gene relationship. It is the resistance that invariably remains after vertical resistance has been matched. It is genetically controlled by [[polygene]]s and it is durable resistance as many ancient clones testify. Its use in agriculture  requires population breeding and recurrent mass selection.

[[Infection]] is the contact made by one parasite individual with one host individual for the purposes of parasitism. There are two kinds of infection:

* '''Allo-infection'''&lt;ref name=Robinson76&gt;Robinson, R.A. (1976); “Plant Pathosystems.” Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg, New York, 184pp.&lt;/ref&gt; means that the parasite originates away from its host and has to travel to that host. The first infection of any individual host must be an allo-infection. Vertical resistance can control allo-infection only. It normally does this with a system of locking (see below) which reduces the proportion of allo-infections that are matching infections.
*
* '''Auto-infection'''&lt;ref name=Robinson76/&gt; means that the parasite originates on, or in, the host that it is infecting. Auto-infection and all the consequences of a matching allo-infection, can be controlled only by [[horizontal resistance]]. This is because the parasite individual reproduces asexually to produce a [[Cloning|clone]] (or else reproduces sexually and quickly reaches [[homogeneity]] of matching individuals) and auto-infection is thus matching infection.

An [[epidemic]] is the growth of a parasite population which is made at the expense of the host population. There are two kinds of epidemic:

* '''Continuous epidemics'''&lt;ref name=Robinson87&gt;[[Raoul A. Robinson|Robinson, Raoul A.]] (1987) Host Management in Crop Pathosystems. Macmillan, New York,  Collier-Macmillan, London, 263pp&lt;/ref&gt; have no break in the parasitism; they have no gene-for-gene relationships; they involve [[evergreen]] trees, and some [[perennial]] herbs.
* '''Discontinuous epidemics'''&lt;ref name=Robinson87/&gt; have regular breaks in the parasitism, due to an absence of host tissue during an adverse season, such as a temperate winter or tropical [[dry season]]; they often have a gene-for-gene relationship against some of their parasites; they involve annual plants, some perennial herbs, and the leaves and fruits of [[deciduous]] trees and shrubs.

== ''Gene-for-gene relationship - the n/2 model'' ==

The n/2 model (pronounced either ‘en over two’ or 'half en') suggests the mode of operation of the gene-for-gene relationship in a wild plant pathosystem.&lt;ref name=Robinson96&gt;Robinson, R.A. (1996) Return to Resistance; Breeding Plants to Reduce Pesticide Dependence”. agAccess, Davis, California, 480pp.&lt;/ref&gt; It apparently functions as a system of locking in which every host and parasite individual has half of the genes in the gene-for-gene relationship (i.e., n/2 genes, where n is the total number of pairs of genes in that relationship). Each gene in the host is the equivalent of a tumbler in a mechanical lock, and each gene in the parasite is the equivalent of a notch on a mechanical key. Provided that each n/2 combination of genes occurs with an equal frequency, and with a random distribution, in both the host and parasite populations, the frequency of matching allo-infections will be reduced to the minimum. For example, with six pairs of genes, each host and parasite individual would have three genes, and there would be twenty different locks and keys; with a twelve-gene system, there would be 924 six-gene locks and keys. Given an equal frequency and a random distribution  of every lock and key, the frequency of matching allo-infection would be 1/20 and 1/924, respectively. These figures are obtained from the [[binomial expansion]] illustrated by [[Pascal's triangle]].&lt;ref&gt;Person, C.O. (1959); “Gene-for-gene relationships in host-parasite systems.” Can. J. Bot. 37; 1101-1130.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Robinson96/&gt;

This system of locking cannot function in a crop pathosystem in which the host population has genetic uniformity. A crop pathosystem is usually the equivalent of every door in the town having the same lock, and every householder having the same key which fits every lock. A system of locking is ruined by uniformity, and this is exactly what we have achieved when protecting our genetically uniform crops with vertical resistance. It also explains why vertical resistance is temporary resistance in agriculture. This type of error is called sub-optimization and it results from working at too low a systems level. The system of locking is an emergent property that is observable only at the systems level of the pathosystem. Comparable biological emergents are the schooling of [[fish]], and the flocking of [[bird]]s, which cannot be observed at any systems level below that of the population. The n/2 model is also the most important hypothesis to emanate from the concept of the pathosystem.&lt;ref name=Robinson10/&gt; It can also be argued that the gene-for-gene relationship must function on a basis of [[heterogeneity]] in the wild pathosystem because the gross instability of the '[[boom and bust]]'&lt;ref name=Vanderplank63/&gt; of modern plant breeding would have no evolutionary survival value.&lt;ref name=Robinson10/&gt;

A gene-for-gene relationship can evolve only in a discontinuous pathosystem.&lt;ref name=Robinson87/&gt; This is because it functions as a system of locking. A matching allo-infection is the equivalent of a lock being unlocked. With the end of the season, all matched (i.e., unlocked) host tissues disappear. With the onset of a new growing season, all discontinuous host tissue (e.g., new leaves of a deciduous tree, newly germinated annual [[seedling]]s, or newly emerged tissue of a perennial herb) is unmatched and each host individual has a vertical resistance that is functioning. This is the equivalent of re-locking. This alternation of matching and non-matching (or unlocking and re-locking) is an essential feature of any system of locking, and it is possible only in a discontinuous pathosystem. Conversely, in a continuous pathosystem just one matching allo-infection on each host individual is required for that individual to be parasitised for the rest of its life which, in the case of some evergreen trees, may endure for centuries. A gene-for-gene relationship is useless in such a pathosystem and, consequently, it will not evolve.

Crops that are derived from a continuous wild pathosystem (e.g., [[aroid]]s, banana, cassava, citrus, cocoa, coconut, date palm, ginger, mango, oil palm, olive, papaya, pineapple, pyrethrum, sisal, sugarcane, sweet potato, tea, turmeric, vanilla, yams) have no gene-for-gene relationships, not withstanding a few erroneous reports to the contrary.

== ''Horizontal resistance'' ==

Horizontal resistance is the resistance that invariably remains after a matching allo-infection has occurred.&lt;ref name=Robinson76/&gt; To postulate that horizontal resistance does not occur would be to postulate an absolute susceptibility. Such a level of  susceptibility is experimentally unproved, and is theoretically impossible. Horizontal resistance is polygenically inherited and it can be exhibited at any level between its minimum and its maximum. Its maximum level should provide a virtually complete control of a parasite under conditions of maximum epidemiological competence.&lt;ref name=Robinson10/&gt; Breeding for comprehensive horizontal resistance will require simultaneous quantitative improvements and will eventually control all the parasites that have epidemiological competence in a particular agro-ecosystem.&lt;ref name=Robinson96/&gt; (5). However, because epidemiological competence is so variable, a [[cultivar]] that is in balance with one agro-ecosystem, is likely to be unbalanced in another agro-ecosystem, having too much resistance to some parasites and too little to others.

Of particular importance is the concept of parasite interference, first defined by Vanderplank,&lt;ref&gt;Vanderplank, J.E. (1968); “Disease Resistance in Plants.” Academic Press, New York &amp; London, 206pp.&lt;/ref&gt; who called it the cryptic error in field trials. Parasite interference does not affect the demonstration of  vertical resistance, but it can totally destroy the evidence for high levels of horizontal resistance.&lt;ref name=Robinson10/&gt; This factor, which has only recently been recognised, largely explains the almost total neglect of horizontal resistance during the twentieth century.

The greater the area of a uniform host population with a single vertical resistance, the more dangerous that resistance becomes. This is because of an increased selection pressure for the matching parasite, and an increased loss when the matching does occur. The greater the area of uniformity of vertical resistance, therefore, the greater the danger.&lt;ref name=Robinson10/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vanderplank63/&gt; Conversely, the greater the area of a uniform host population with high horizontal resistances, the more effective the horizontal resistance becomes. This is because parasite interference declines as the area of a horizontally resistant host population increases, and it is least when the entire crop of a region has a high level of  horizontal resistance in all of its cultivars. The greater the area of uniformity of horizontal resistance, therefore, the greater the security.&lt;ref name=Robinson10/&gt;

In breeding crop plants for horizontal resistance to their parasites, the disciplines of plant breeding, plant pathology, and crop entomology should be regarded as being amalgamated into a single discipline.

Human physiology seeks to understand the mechanisms that work to keep the [[human body]] alive and functioning,&lt;ref name="Guyton"/&gt; through scientific enquiry into the nature of mechanical, physical, and biochemical functions of humans, their organs, and the cells of which they are composed. The principal level of focus of physiology is at the level of organs and systems within systems. The endocrine and nervous systems play major roles in the reception and transmission of signals. that integrate function in animals. Homeostasis is a major aspect with regard to such interactions within plants as well as animals. The biological basis of the study of physiology, integration refers to the overlap of many functions of the systems of the human body, as well as its accompanied form. It is achieved through communication that occurs in a variety of ways, both electrical and chemical.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Changes in physiology can impact the mental functions of individuals. Examples of this would be the effects of certain medications or toxic levels of substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mental disorders|url=http://www.who.int/topics/mental_disorders/en/|website=World Health Organization|publisher=WHO|accessdate=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Change in [[behavior change (individual)|behavior]] as a result of these substances is often used to assess the health of individuals.&lt;ref name = Davis2017&gt;{{cite web | title = Eszopiclone | publisher = F.A.

Much of the foundation of knowledge in human physiology was provided by animal experimentation. Due to the frequent connection between form and function, physiology and [[anatomy]] are intrinsically linked and are studied in tandem as part of a medical curriculum.&lt;ref name="NIH2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bergman |first1=Esther M |last2=de Bruin |first2=Anique BH |last3=Herrler |first3=Andreas |last4=Verheijen |first4=Inge WH |last5=Scherpbier |first5=Albert JJA |last6=van der Vleuten |first6=Cees PM |title=Students' perceptions of anatomy across the undergraduate problem-based learning medical curriculum: a phenomenographical study |pmc=4225514 |journal=BMC Medical Education |doi=10.1186/1472-6920-13-152 |date=19 November 2013 |quote=Together with physiology and biochemistry, anatomy is one of the basic sciences that are to be taught in the medical curriculum. |pmid=24252155 |volume=13 |page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plants===
{{Main|Plant physiology}}Plant physiology is a subdiscipline of [[botany]] concerned with the functioning of plants. Closely related fields include [[plant morphology]], [[plant ecology]], [[phytochemistry]], [[cell biology]], genetics, [[biophysics]], and [[molecular biology]]. Fundamental processes of plant physiology include [[photosynthesis]], [[Respiration in plant|respiration]], [[plant nutrition]], [[tropism]]s, [[nastic movements]], [[photoperiodism]], [[photomorphogenesis]], [[circadian rhythm]]s, [[Germination|seed germination]], [[dormancy]], and [[stoma]]ta function and transpiration. Absorption of water by roots, production of food in the leaves, and growth of shoots towards light are examples of plant physiology.

===Cells===
{{Main|Cell physiology}}Although there are differences between animal, plant, and microbial cells, the basic physiological functions of cells can be divided into the processes of [[cell division]], [[cell signaling]], [[cell growth]], and [[Metabolism|cell metabolism]].

===Microorganisms===
{{Main|Microorganism}}Microorganisms can be found almost everywhere on Earth. Types of microorganisms include archaea, bacteria, eukaryotes, protists, fungi, and micro-plants. [[Microbes in human culture|Microbes are important in human culture]] and [[health]] in many ways, serving to [[Fermentation in food processing|ferment foods]], [[Sewage treatment|treat sewage]], [[Algae fuel|produce fuel]], [[enzyme]]s and other [[bioactive compound]]s. They are essential tools in [[biology]] as [[model organism]]s and have been put to use in [[biological warfare]] and [[bioterrorism]]. They are a vital [[Soil microbiology|component of fertile soils]]. In the [[human body]] microorganisms make up the [[human microbiota]] including the essential [[gut flora]]. They are the [[pathogen]]s responsible for many [[infectious disease]]s and as such are the target of [[Hygiene|hygiene measures]]. Most microorganisms can reproduce rapidly, and bacteria are also able to freely exchange genes through [[Bacterial conjugation|conjugation]], [[Transformation (genetics)|transformation]] and [[Transduction (genetics)|transduction]], even between widely divergent species.

== History ==

===The classical era===
The study of human physiology as a medical field originates in [[classical Greece]], at the time of [[Hippocrates]] (late 5th century BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scienceclarified.com/Ph-Py/Physiology.html |title=Physiology|work=Science Clarified |publisher= Advameg, Inc. |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Outside of Western tradition, early forms of physiology or anatomy can be reconstructed as having been present at around the same time in China,&lt;ref&gt;Helaine Selin, ''Medicine Across Cultures: History and Practice of Medicine in Non-Western Cultures'' (2003), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; India&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=From Physiology and Chemistry to Biochemistry|page=8|publisher=Pearson Education|author1=D. P. Burma |author2=Maharani Chakravorty }}&lt;/ref&gt; and elsewhere.
Hippocrates incorporated his belief system called the theory of humours, which consisted of four basic substance: earth, water, air and fire. Each substance is known for having a corresponding humour: black bile, phlegm, blood and yellow bile, respectively. Hippocrates also noted some emotional connections to the four humours, which Claudius Galenus would later expand on. The critical thinking of [[Aristotle]] and his emphasis on the relationship between structure and function marked the beginning of physiology in [[Ancient Greece]]. Like Hippocrates, Aristotle took to the humoral theory of disease, which also consisted of four primary qualities in life: hot, cold, wet and dry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/neurophysio.html|title=Early Medicine and Physiology|work=ship.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claudius Galenus (c. ~130–200&amp;nbsp;AD), known as [[Galen]] of Pergamum, was the first to use experiments to probe the functions of the body. Unlike Hippocrates, Galen argued that humoral imbalances can be located in specific organs, including the entire body.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/223895/Galen-of-Pergamum|title=Galen of Pergamum|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; His modification of this theory better equipped doctors to make more precise diagnoses. Galen also played off of Hippocrates idea that emotions were also tied to the humours, and added the notion of temperaments: sanguine corresponds with blood; phlegmatic is tied to phlegm; yellow bile is connected to choleric; and black bile corresponds with melancholy. Galen also saw the human body consisting of three connected systems: the brain and nerves, which are responsible for thoughts and sensations; the heart and arteries, which give life; and the liver and veins, which can be attributed to nutrition and growth.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt; Galen was also the founder of experimental physiology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first1 = C. | last1 = Fell | first2 = F. | last2 = Pearson | title = Historical Perspectives of Thoracic Anatomy | journal = Thoracic Surgery Clinics |date=November 2007 | volume = 17 | issue = 4 | pages = 443–8| url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1547412706001034 | doi = 10.1016/j.thorsurg.2006.12.001| pmid = 18271159 }}&lt;/ref&gt; And for the next 1,400 years, Galenic physiology was a powerful and influential tool in medicine.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt;

===Early modern period===
[[Jean Fernel]] (1497–1558), a French physician, introduced the term "physiology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the Scientific Revolution: From Copernicus to Newton |page=344|author=Wilbur Applebaum|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galen, [[Ibn al-Nafis]], [[Michael Servetus]], [[Realdo Colombo]], [[Amato Lusitano]] and [[William Harvey]], are credited as making important discoveries in the [[circulation of the blood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rampling|first=M. W.|date=2016|title=The history of the theory of the circulation of the blood|journal=Clinical Hemorheology and Microcirculation|volume=64|issue=4|pages=541–549|doi=10.3233/CH-168031|issn=1875-8622|pmid=27791994}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Santorio Santorio]] in 1610s was the first to use a device to measure the [[pulse]] rate (the ''pulsilogium''), and a [[thermoscope]] to measure temperature.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://exhibits.hsl.virginia.edu/treasures/santorio-santorio-1561-1636/|title=Santorio Santorio (1561-1636): Medicina statica|last=|first=|date=|website=Vaulted Treasures|publisher=University of Virginia, Claude Moore Health Sciences Library|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1791 [[Luigi Galvani]] described the role of electricity in nerves of dissected frogs. In 1811, Julien Jean César Legallois studied respiration in animal dissection and lesions and found the center of respiration in the [[medulla oblongata]]. In the same year, [[Charles Bell]] finished work on what would later become known as the [[Bell-Magendie law]], which compared functional differences between dorsal and ventral roots of the [[spinal cord]]. In 1824, [[François Magendie]] described the sensory roots and produced the first evidence of the cerebellum’s role in [[Equilibrioception|equilibration]] to complete the Bell-Magendie law.

In the 1820s, the French physiologist [[Henri Milne-Edwards]] introduced the notion of physiological division of labor, which allowed to "compare and study living things as if they were machines created by the industry of man." Inspired in the work of [[Adam Smith]], Milne-Edwards wrote that the "body of all living beings, whether animal or plant, resembles a factory ... where the organs, comparable to workers, work incessantly to produce the phenomena that constitute the life of the individual." In more differentiated organisms, the functional labor could be apportioned between different instruments or [[Biological system|systems]] (called by him as ''appareils'').&lt;ref name="brain"&gt;R. M. Brain. ''The Pulse of Modernism: Physiological Aesthetics in Fin-de-Siècle Europe''. Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2015. 384 pp., [https://books.google.com/books?id=l8IECgAAQBAJ].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1858, [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]] studied the cause of blood coagulation and inflammation that resulted after previous injuries and surgical wounds. He later discovered and implemented [[antiseptic]]s in the operating room, and as a result decreased death rate from surgery by a substantial amount.&lt;ref name="medicalnewstoday.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="physiologyinfo.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physiologyinfo.org/mm/Timeline-of-Physiology/Milestones-in-Physiology.pdf|date=1 October 2013|title= Milestones in Physiology (1822-2013)|accessdate=2015-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Physiological Society]] was founded in London in 1876 as a dining club.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.physoc.org/society-history|title=The Society's history {{!}} Physiological Society|website=www.physoc.org|language=en|access-date=2017-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The American Physiological Society]]  (APS) is a nonprofit organization that was founded in 1887. The Society is, "devoted to fostering education, scientific research, and dissemination of information in the physiological sciences."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.the-aps.org/fm/About-Us.html|title=American Physiological Society &gt; About|website=www.the-aps.org|language=en|access-date=2017-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1891, [[Ivan Pavlov]] performed research on "conditional responses" that involved dogs' saliva production in response to a bell and visual stimuli.&lt;ref name="physiologyinfo.org"/&gt;

In the 19th century, physiological knowledge began to accumulate at a rapid rate, in particular with the 1838 appearance of the [[Cell theory]] of [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden|Matthias Schleiden]] and [[Theodor Schwann]]. It radically stated that organisms are made up of units called cells. [[Claude Bernard]]'s (1813–1878) further discoveries ultimately led to his concept of ''[[milieu interieur]]'' (internal environment),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to the Study of Ex- perimental Medicine|last=Bernard|first=Claude|publisher=Dover Publications|year=1865|isbn=|location=New York|publication-date=1957|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lectures on the Phenomena of Life Common to Animals and Plants|last=Bernard|first=Claude|publisher=Thomas|year=1878|isbn=|location=Springfield|publication-date=1974|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would later be taken up and championed as "[[homeostasis]]" by American physiologist [[Walter B. Cannon]] in 1929. By homeostasis, Cannon meant "the maintenance of steady states in the body and the physiological processes through which they are regulated."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Brown Theodore M. |author2=Fee Elizabeth | date = October 2002 | title = Walter Bradford Cannon: Pioneer Physiologist of Human Emotions | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 92 | issue = 10| pages = 1594–1595 | pmc=1447286 | doi=10.2105/ajph.92.10.1594}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the body's ability to regulate its internal environment. William Beaumont was the first American to utilize the practical application of physiology.

Nineteenth century physiologists such as [[Michael Foster (physiologist)|Michael Foster]], [[Max Verworn]], and [[Alfred Binet]], based on [[Haeckel]]'s ideas, elaborated what came to be called "general physiology", a unified science of life based on the cell actions,&lt;ref name=brain/&gt; later renamed in the 20th century as [[cell biology]].&lt;ref&gt;Heilbron, J. L. (2003). ''The Oxford Companion to the History of Modern Science'', Oxford University Press, p. 649, [https://books.google.com/books?id=abqjP-_KfzkC link].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late modern period===
In the 20th century, biologists  became interested in how organisms other than human beings function, eventually spawning the fields of [[comparative physiology]] and [[ecophysiology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Feder | first1=ME |last2=Bennett |first2=AF |first3=Burggren |last3=WW |last4=Huey |first4=RB  | title = New directions in ecological physiology | year = 1987 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-521-34938-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major figures in these fields include [[Knut Schmidt-Nielsen]] and [[George Bartholomew (biologist)|George Bartholomew]]. Most recently, [[evolutionary physiology]] has become a distinct subdiscipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first1 = Theodore | last1 = Garland, Jr | author1-link=Theodore Garland, Jr. | last2 = Carter | first2 = P. A. | title = Evolutionary physiology | journal = Annual Review of Physiology | year = 1994 | issue = 1 | pages = 579–621 | url = http://www.biology.ucr.edu/people/faculty/Garland/GarlCa94.pdf | doi = 10.1146/annurev.ph.56.030194.003051 | volume = 56 | pmid=8010752}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920, [[August Krogh]] won the Nobel Prize for discovering how, in capillaries, blood flow is regulated.&lt;ref name="physiologyinfo.org"/&gt;

In 1954, [[Andrew Huxley]] and Hugh Huxley, alongside their research team, discovered the sliding filaments in [[skeletal muscle]], known today as the sliding filament theory.&lt;ref name="physiologyinfo.org"/&gt;

Recently, there have been intense debates about the vitality of physiology as a discipline (Is it dead or alive?).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pinter|first=G. G.|last2=Pinter|first2=V.|date=1993|title=Is Physiology a Dying Discipline?|journal=Physiology|volume=8|issue=2|pages=94–95|doi=10.1152/physiologyonline.1993.8.2.94}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lemoine|first=Maël|last2=Pradeu|first2=Thomas|date=2018-07-01|title=Dissecting the Meanings of "Physiology" to Assess the Vitality of the Discipline|journal=Physiology (Bethesda, Md.)|volume=33|issue=4|pages=236–245|doi=10.1152/physiol.00015.2018|issn=1548-9221|pmid=29873600}}&lt;/ref&gt; If physiology is perhaps less visible nowadays than during the golden age of the 19th century,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge History of the Modern Biological and Earth Science|last=Kremer|first=Richard L.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2009|isbn=9781139056007|editor-last=Bowler &amp; Pickstone|location=Cambridge|pages=342–366|chapter=Physiology|doi=10.1017/CHOL9780521572019.019}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is in large part because the field has given birth to some of the most active domains of today's biological sciences, such as [[neuroscience]], [[endocrinology]], and [[immunology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Noble|first=Denis|date=2013|title=More on Physiology Without Borders|journal=Physiology|volume=28|issue=1|pages=2–3|doi=10.1152/physiol.00044.2012|issn=1548-9213|pmid=23280350}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, physiology is still often seen as an integrative discipline, which can put together into a coherent framework data coming from various different domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Neill|first=Jimmy D.|last2=Benos|first2=Dale J.|date=1993|title=Relationship of Molecular Biology to Integrative Physiology|journal=Physiology|volume=8|issue=5|pages=233–235|doi=10.1152/physiologyonline.1993.8.5.233}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Noble|first=Denis|date=2002-03-01|title=Modeling the Heart--from Genes to Cells to the Whole Organ|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/295/5560/1678|journal=Science|language=en|volume=295|issue=5560|pages=1678–1682|doi=10.1126/science.1069881|issn=0036-8075|pmid=11872832}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Notable physiologists==
{{Main|List of physiologists}}

=== Women in physiology ===
Initially, women were largely excluded from official involvement in any physiological society. The [[American Physiological Society]], for example, was founded in 1887 and included only men in its ranks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Physiological Society &gt; Founders|url=http://www.the-aps.org/fm/founders.html|website=www.the-aps.org|publisher=The American Physiological Society|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902, the American Physiological Society elected [[Ida Hyde]] as the first female member of the society.&lt;ref name="Tucker 1981"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tucker|first1=GS|title=Ida Henrietta Hyde: the first woman member of the society|journal=The Physiologist|date=December 1981|volume=24|issue=6|pages=1–9|pmid=7043502|url=http://www.the-aps.org/mm/Publications/Journals/Physiologist/1980-1989/1981/December.pdf}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hyde, a representative of the [[American Association of University Women]] and a global advocate for gender equality in education,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/hydeida-henrietta|title=Ida Henrietta Hyde|work=jwa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; attempted to promote gender equality in every aspect of science and medicine.

Soon thereafter, in 1913, [[J.S. Haldane]] proposed that women be allowed to formally join [[The Physiological Society]], which had been founded in 1876.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.physoc.org/women-physiology|title=Women in Physiology {{!}} Physiological Society|website=www.physoc.org|language=en|access-date=2018-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 July 1915, six women were officially admitted: [[Florence Buchanan]], [[Winifred Cullis]], [[Ruth C. Skelton]], [[Sarah C. M. Sowton]], [[Constance Leetham Terry]], and  [[Enid M. Tribe]].&lt;ref name="physoc.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physoc.org/women-physiology|title=Women in Physiology|work=physoc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The centenary of the election of women was celebrated in 2015 with the publication of the book "Women Physiologists: Centenary Celebrations And Beyond For The Physiological Society." ({{ISBN|978-0-9933410-0-7}})

Prominent women physiologists include:
* [[Gerty Cori]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1363456/Carl-Cori-and-Gerty-Cori|title=Carl Cori and Gerty Cori|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with husband [[Carl Cori]], received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1947 for their discovery of the [[phosphate]]-containing form of [[glucose]] known as [[glycogen]], as well as its function within [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] [[Metabolism|metabolic]] mechanisms for energy production. Moreover, they discovered the [[Cori cycle]], also known as the Lactic acid cycle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Cori+cycle|title=Cori cycle|work=TheFreeDictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; which describes how muscle tissue converts glycogen into lactic acid via [[lactic acid fermentation]].

* [[Elizabeth Blackburn]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1567675/Elizabeth-H-Blackburn|title=Elizabeth H. Blackburn|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with [[Carol W. Greider]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Carol-W-Greider "Carol W. Greider"]. ''Encyclopædia Britannica''.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jack W. Szostak]], was awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of the genetic composition and function of [[telomeres]] and the enzyme called [[telomerase]].

The '''Zeiss-Planetarium''' in [[Jena]], [[Germany]] is the oldest continuously operating [[planetarium]] in the world. It was opened on July 18, 1926. The Zeiss-Planetarium is a projection planetarium. The planets and fixed stars are projected onto the inner surface of a white cupola.

The Zeiss-Planetarium is owned and operated by the [[Ernst-Abbe-Stiftung]].

It was engineered by German engineer [[Walther Bauersfeld]].

{{for|the Philip K. Dick story|Project Plowshare}}
The '''Plowshares Project''' is a [[Peace Studies]] collaborative between [[Manchester University (Indiana)|Manchester University]], [[Earlham College]] and [[Goshen College]] in [[Indiana]].

==History==
The Plowshares Project was formed in 2002, and is funded by a four-year grant from [[Eli Lilly and Company]]. The project defines its mission and goals by the religious ethos of the [[Church of the Brethren]], the [[Society of Friends]], and [[Mennonite Church USA]].

==Purpose==
Plowshares was initiated to enrich the Peace Studies programs at Manchester, Earlham, and Goshen colleges. The program facilitates channels of discussion, and seeks to uphold the peacemaking traditions of the colleges' [[peace churches|founding churches]].

==Declared goals==
With the Lilly grant, the Plowshares Program intends to:
*''Further Expand Peace Studies Programs''—by creating an international resource for peace studies education, strengthening educators, and offering grants for student research.
*''Unification of Peace Studies Courses''—through discussion and program development by founding schools.
*''Increase Awareness of Peace Studies and Related Issues''—by creating a community presence to inform respective communities and nation of happenings and to distinguish Indiana as a strong base for peace studies.

==Peace House==
The Peace House is the main outlet for community involvement for the Plowshares Project. Located in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]], the house serves as a hub for undergraduate students from any US college or university, and in any major, to become directly involved in the fields of peace and justice. 

The Peace House provides semester-long residence for students pursuing internships with Indianapolis companies and organizations who are involved or concerned with peace and justice issues. There is also a nine-week summer intensive available for students. 

===Fall and spring semesters===
During the regular semester, students at the Peace House take two Peace Studies courses taught by adjunct faculty. From the Plowshares website:
*''Introduction to Urban Peace and Justice Issues''— combined with an introduction to the city of Indianapolis
*''Peacemaking in Practice''—focusing on "self-reflection, strategic planning and practical skills for non-violent social change&lt;ref&gt;1&lt;/ref&gt;"

====Internship====
The internship session mediated by Peace House allows for '''up to''' 20 hours of work per week under the supervision of the Peace House director; the work grants up to six credit hours. 

===Summer session===
The nine-week summer session operates without the class work, but still facilitates a full-time internship. The student may work up to 40 hours per week with a selected organization, and may still earn up to six credit hours. During the summer, students may also reside at the Peace House without earning college credit.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10678">The '''Portlethen Moss''' {{coord|57|3|27.04|N|2|8|50.68|W|region:GB|display=title}} is an [[acid]]ic bog [[nature reserve]] located to the west of the town of [[Portlethen]], [[Aberdeenshire]] in [[Scotland]].  Like other [[Bog|mosses]], this [[wetland]] area supports a variety of plant and animal [[species]], even though it has been subject to certain development and [[agricultural]] degradation pressures.  For example, the [[Great Crested Newt]] was found here prior to the expansion of the town of [[Portlethen]].  Many acid loving vegetative species occur in Portlethen Moss, and the [[habitat]] is monitored by the [[Scottish Wildlife Trust]].

Portlethen Moss is the location of considerable [[prehistoric]], [[Middle Ages]] and seventeenth century history, largely due to a ridge near the bog which was the route of early travellers.  By at least the [[Middle Ages]] this [[trackway]] was more formally constructed with raised stonework and called the [[Causey Mounth]].  Without this [[drovers' road]], travel through the Portlethen Moss and several nearby bogs would have been impossible between [[Aberdeen]] and coastal points to the south.

==History==
[[Image:Calluna vulgaris 1.jpg|thumb|left|True [[Calluna|heather]], a common plant on the Portlethen Moss]]

Prehistoric man inhabited the Portlethen Moss area as evidenced by well preserved [[Iron Age]] [[stone circle]]s and other excavated [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s nearby.&lt;ref&gt;Duffy, A 1998 'Charcoal samples', in Rees, T 'Excavation of Cairnwell Ring-Cairn, Portlethen', Proc Soc Antiq Scot, 127, 255-280&lt;/ref&gt; Obviously only the outcrops and ridge areas would have been habitable, but the desirability of primitive habitation would have been enhanced by  proximity to the sea and natural defensive protection of the moss to impede intruders. From [[Tacitus]] accounts&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Accounts of Agricola in Caledonia'', ca 42AD&lt;/ref&gt; of the Roman general [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola|Agricola]], it is known that the Romans were daunted by Portlethen Moss, [[Netherley Red Moss]], [[Cookney Moss]] and other local bogs that hindered travel. This is also evidenced by the [[Roman Camp]] of [[Raedykes]] having been established immediately south of this cluster of [[moss (habitat)|mosses]]; the Romans not being able to progress further north, turned inland toward [[Netherley, Aberdeenshire|Netherley]].The Portlethen Moss is near the Grampian Mountains.

The ancient [[Causey Mounth]] passage specifically connected the [[Bridge of Dee]] to the town of [[Stonehaven]]. This route was used to access the historic meeting of the [[Covenanter]]s at [[Muchalls Castle]] in the year 1638 AD as they opposed the Bishops of Aberdeen. The route was also that taken by the [[William Keith, 7th Earl Marischal]] and [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose]] when they led a [[Covenanter]] army of 9000 men in the biggest battle of the [[Bishops' Wars]] in 1639&lt;ref&gt;Archibald Watt, ''Highways and Biways around [[Kincardineshire]]'', Stonehaven Heritage Society (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

Further to the east of Portlethen Moss lie three original [[coast]]al [[fishing]] villages: [[Findon, Scotland|Findon]], [[Portlethen]] Village and [[Downies]]. In the period 1960 to 2005, Portlethen has developed as a [[dormitory town]] to Aberdeen and a location for [[retail]] [[Big-box store#United Kingdom|superstore]]s.

==Conservation status==
The Portlethen Moss is a recognised nature preserve by the Scottish Wildlife Trust (with designation PLM076) and the Aberdeenshire Council.  While [[peat]] cutting was conducted in prehistoric and [[Middle Ages]] times, there has been no harvesting of peat in the modern era.  There is some ongoing loss of moss habitat from [[cattle]] [[grazing]], but the most significant threat is from ongoing land development pressure;&lt;ref&gt;Fiona Everingham, ''Portlethen Moss Survey'', Scottish Wildlife Trust, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; in fact, half of the Portlethen Moss has been lost to [[Urban development|urban]] (low density) land development by the town of Portlethen during the period 1985 to 2005.  Trampling is considered an insignificant threat due to the small animal or human presence in the existing nature reserve area; furthermore, cattle grazing, while ongoing, is deemed a much lesser current threat than [[Human overpopulation|population expansion pressure]].  Enrichment (addition of grazing animal  [[manure]]) is not a major issue due to the low density of animals.  As a net result damage to the primordial moss is considered extensive and widespread by the Scottish Wildlife Trust.  The raised bog habitat of the Portlethen Moss is also protected by the [[United Kingdom Biodiversity Action Plan]].

==Topography and meteorology==
[[Image:Ruinedchapel.jpg|thumb|left|Ruined Episcopal chapel from 18th century south of the Portlethen Moss along the Causey Mounth]]
Portlethen Moss is considered a [[raised bog]], because its general situation is on higher ground, at the edge of the [[Mounth]], a coastal mountain spur of the [[Grampian Mountains]] overlooking the [[North Sea]].  There are rock [[outcrop]]s and strewn [[boulder]]s [[relict]] from the glacial age at this site.  Elevations within the Portlethen Moss range from approximately 35 to 60 metres above sea level.  Formation of this moss has occurred due to extensive sets of depressions in the underlying rock formations of [[Old Red Sandstone]].  The entire water composition of the bog thus has been provided by [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] with no source of [[surface runoff]], since the topography reduces to lower elevations in every direction.  Due to the high winds, moderate precipitation and cool temperatures that generally prevail, conditions are favourable for formation of an acid bog, since water stagnates, but eventually evaporates with ensuing acidity enhancement of decaying organic matter.  There was virtually no [[drainage]] outlet in prehistoric times, and little drainage even in modern times.

==Evolution of Portlethen Moss==
Many coastal mosses were initiated by the process of [[glacier|glaciation]], which sheared rock formations to a generally level terrain, while also gouging moderate sized craters that would pond.  This description fits the fundamental situation of Portlethen Moss, where sphagnum would have flourished over millennia of [[evaporation]], further intensifying the [[soil acidity]], fueled by organic matter decaying, with little drainage outlet.  A layer of [[sphagnum]] moss would have developed at the [[benthic]] level of the bog, and additional sphagnum layers floated in mats atop the bog.

At an intermediate level of evolution, thick peat layers formed from decay and carbonisation of the rotting sphagnum.  Generations of carex and juncus flourished, leading to further decay of these materials and eventual heightening of the organic mass.  Finally, secondary vegetation took root in the spongy sphagnum mats adding greater biomass to the bog.In some cases the heavy saturated organic layers could actually rupture, spilling large volumes of mud and organic debris to surrounding fields, thus enabling a bed for further spatial expansion of the entire bog.    Ultimately the colour of the moss waters became blood red in colour, from the successive organic decay and stagnation.  Only in times associated with cattle grazing and significant human presence (probably the late Iron Age), would this process reverse and the bog reduce in size.

==Vegetation==
A wide variety of [[sphagnum]], [[carex|sedges]], [[juncus|rushes]] and other characteristic bog species inhabit Portlethen Moss.  Sometimes insectivorous plants reside in mosses, since the soils are generally nutrient poor.  The heath also serves as a food source for area [[roe deer]], while ''Corydalis'' is an attractive host for numerous [[butterfly]] [[larva]]e.  Representative plant species found in this nature reserve include:
[[Image:Erica tetralix 2B.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Erica tetralix]]'', a [[wildflower]]  found on the Portlethen Moss]]

==Relation to other mosses==
There are numerous mosses or bog habitats in Scotland, many of them situated also in Aberdeenshire, including the [[Cookney Moss]], [[Leuchar Moss]] and [[Red Moss of Netherley]] nearby.  There are also many other shires within Scotland that contain mosses such as [[Fife]], [[Angus, Scotland|Angus]], [[Morayshire]] and [[Lanarkshire]].  Some of these are lowland bogs and others, like Portlethen Moss, are raised bogs.  There are other similar acidic peat bogs in the northern part of [[North America]], [[Russia]] and northern [[Europe]], but in those locations they are usually called "bogs".

A J Clark was the first to quantify drug-induced biological responses (using an equation described f-mediated receptor activation. So far, nearly all of the quantitative theoretical modelling of receptor function has centred on [[ligand-gated ion channels]] and [[GPCR]]s.&lt;ref name="Rang2006"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rang HP |title=The receptor concept: pharmacology's big idea |journal=Br.

==History==

===The receptor concept===
In 1901, Langley challenged the [[Scientific hypothesis|dominant hypothesis]] that drugs act at nerve endings by demonstrating that nicotine acted at sympathetic ganglia even after the degeneration of the severed preganglionic nerve endings.&lt;ref&gt;Langley J. On the stimulation and paralysis of nerve cells and of nerve-endings. Part 1. ''J Physiol'' 1901 October 16; 27(3): 224–236.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1905 he introduced the concept of a receptive substance on the surface of skeletal muscle that mediated the action of a drug. It also postulated that these receptive substances were different in different species (citing the fact that nicotine-induced muscle paralysis in mammals was absent in crayfish).&lt;ref&gt;J. N. Langley. On the reaction of cells and of nerve-endings to certain poisons, chiefly as regards the reaction of striated muscle to nicotine and to curare. ''J Physiol'' 1905; 33: 374–413.&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, [[Paul Ehrlich|Ehrlich]] was trying to understand the basis of selectivity of agents.&lt;ref name=LEL2004&gt;{{cite journal |author=Limbird LE |title=The receptor concept: a continuing evolution |journal=Mol. Interv. |volume=4 |issue=6 |pages=326–36 |year=2004 |pmid=15616162 |doi=10.1124/mi.4.6.6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He theorized that selectivity was the basis of a preferential distribution of lead and dyes in different body tissues. However, he later modified the theory in order to explain immune reactions and the selectivity of the immune response.&lt;ref name=LEL2004/&gt; Thinking that selectivity was derived from interaction with the tissues themselves, Ehrlich envisaged molecules extending from cells that the body could use to distinguish and mount an immune response to foreign objects. However, it was only when Ahlquist showed the differential action of adrenaline demonstrated its effects on two distinct receptor populations, did the theory of receptor-mediated drug interactions gain acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ahlquist | first1 = R.P. | year = 1948 | title = A study of the adrenotrophic receptors | url = | journal = Am J Physiol | volume = 155 | issue = | pages = 586–600 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L.E.

===Nature of receptor–drug interactions===

====Receptor occupancy model====
The receptor occupancy model, which describes agonist and competitive antagonists, was built on the work of Langley, [[Archibald Hill|Hill]], and Clark. The occupancy model was the first model put forward by Clark to explain the activity of drugs at receptors and quantified the relationship between drug concentration and observed effect. It is based on mass-action kinetics and attempts to link the action of a drug to the proportion of receptors occupied by that drug at equilibrium.&lt;ref name="CA1999"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Christopoulos A, El-Fakahany EE |title=Qualitative and quantitative assessment of relative agonist efficacy |journal=Biochem. Pharmacol. |volume=58 |issue=5 |pages=735–48 |year=1999 |pmid=10449182 |doi=10.1016/S0006-2952(99)00087-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E.M Ross, and T.P. Kenakin. (2001) Pharmacodynamics. Mechanisms of drug action and the relationship between drug concentration and effect. In Goodman &amp; Gilman’s The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, Vol. Tenth. J.G. Hardman &amp; L.E. Limbird, Eds. McGraw-Hill. New York.&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, the magnitude of the response is directly proportional to the amount of drug bound, and the maximum response would be elicited once all receptors were occupied at equilibrium. He applied mathematical approaches used in enzyme kinetics systematically to the effects of chemicals on tissues.&lt;ref name=TK04/&gt;
He showed that for many drugs, the relationship between drug concentration and biological effect corresponded to a hyperbolic curve, similar to that representing the adsorption of a gas onto a metal surface&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Quirke V |title=Putting theory into practice: James Black, receptor theory and the development of the beta-blockers at ICI, 1958-1978 |journal=Med Hist |volume=50 |issue=1 |pages=69–92 |year=2006 |pmid=16502872 |doi= 10.1017/s0025727300009455|pmc=1369014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fitted the [[Hill equation (biochemistry)|Hill–Langmuir equation]].&lt;ref name="Rang2006"/&gt; Clark, together with [[John Gaddum|Gaddum]], was the first to introduce the [[Dose-response relationship#Dose–response curve|log concentration–effect curve]] and described the now-familiar 'parallel shift' of the log concentration–effect curve produced by a competitive antagonist.&lt;ref name="Rang2006"/&gt; Attempts to separate the binding phenomenon and activation phenomenon were made by [[Everhardus Jacobus Ariëns|Ariëns]] in 1954 and by Stephenson in 1956 to account for the intrinsic activity (efficacy) of a drug (that is, its ability to induce an effect after binding).&lt;ref name="CA1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="colquhoun1973"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maehle AH, Prüll CR, Halliwell RF 2002 637–41"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Maehle AH, Prüll CR, Halliwell RF |title=The emergence of the drug receptor theory |journal=Nature Reviews.

=====Competitive inhibition models=====

The development of the classic theory of drug antagonism by Gaddum, Schild and Arunlakshana built on the work of Langley, [[Archibald Hill|Hill]] and Clark.&lt;ref name="colquhoun1973"&gt;D. Colquhoun, The relation between classical and cooperative models for drug action. In: H.P. Rang, Editor, Drug Receptors, Macmillan Press (1973), pp. 149–182. http://www.ucl.ac.uk/Pharmacology/dc-bits/colquhoun-1973.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Gaddum|Gaddum]] described a model for the competitive binding of two ligands to the same receptor in short communication to the Physiological Society in 1937. The description referred only to binding, it was not immediately useful for the analysis of experimental measurements of the effects of antagonists on the response to agonists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Colquhoun D |title=The quantitative analysis of drug-receptor interactions: a short history |journal=Trends Pharmacol. Sci. |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=149–57 |year=2006 |pmid=16483674 |doi=10.1016/j.tips.2006.01.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was Heinz Otto Schild who made measurement of the equilibrium constant for the binding of an antagonist possible.  He developed the [[Schild regression|Schild equation]] to determine a dose ratio, a measure of the potency of a drug. In Schild regression, the change in the dose ratio, the ratio of the EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of an agonist alone compared to the EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; in the presence of a competitive antagonist as determined on a dose response curve used to determine the affinity of an antagonist for its receptor.

=====Agonist models=====

The flaw in Clark's receptor-occupancy model was that it was insufficient to explain the concept of [[agonist|partial agonist]] lead to the development of agonist models of drug action by Ariens in 1954 and by Stephenson in 1956 to account for the intrinsic activity (efficacy) of a drug (that is, its ability to induce an effect after binding).&lt;ref name="colquhoun1973"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maehle AH, Prüll CR, Halliwell RF 2002 637–41"/&gt;

===Two-state receptor theory===

The two-state model is a simple linear model to describe the interaction between a ligand and its receptor, but also the active receptor (R&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name="bridges2008"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bridges TM, Lindsley CW |title=G-Protein-Coupled Receptors: From Classical Modes of Modulation to Allosteric Mechanisms |journal=ACS Chem. Biol. |volume= 3|issue= 9|pages= 530–41|date=July 2008 |pmid=18652471 |doi=10.1021/cb800116f |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model uses an equilibrium dissociation constant to describe the interaction between ligand and receptor.  It proposes that ligand binding results in a change in receptor state from an inactive to an active state based on the [[Protein structure|receptor's conformation]]. A receptor in its active state will ultimately elicit its biological response. It was first described by Black and Leff in 1983 as an alternative model of receptor activation.&lt;ref&gt;J.W. Black and P. Leff. (1983) Operational Models of Pharmacological Agonism. In: ''Proc. R. Soc. London Ser.'' B 220, pp. 141–162.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the receptor occupancy model, the theory originated from earlier work by del Castillo &amp; Katz on observations relating to ligand-gated ion channels.&lt;ref name="Rang2006"/&gt; In this model, [[agonists]] and [[inverse agonists]] are thought to have selective binding affinity for the pre-existing resting and active states&lt;ref name="Rang2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Leff P |title=The two-state model of receptor activation |journal=Trends Pharmacol.

Whereas [[Receptor antagonist|antagonists]] have no preference in their affinity for a receptor state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Giraldo J |title=Agonist induction, conformational selection, and mutant receptors |journal=FEBS Lett. |volume=556 |issue=1-3 |pages=13–8 |year=2004 |pmid=14706818 |doi=10.1016/S0014-5793(03)01404-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vauquelin G, Van Liefde I |title=G protein-coupled receptors: a count of 1001 conformations |journal=Fundamental &amp; clinical pharmacology |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=45–56 |year=2005 |pmid=15660959 |doi=10.1111/j.1472-8206.2005.00319.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that receptor conformation (state) would affect binding affinity of a ligand was used to explain a mechanism of partial agonism of receptors by del Castillo &amp; Katz in 1957 was based on their work on the action of acetylcholine at the motor endplate&lt;ref name="Rang2006"/&gt; build on similar work by Wyman &amp; Allen in 1951 on conformational-induced changes in hemoglobin's oxygen binding affinity occurring as a result of oxygen binding.&lt;ref name="Colquhoun1998"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Colquhoun D |title=Binding, gating, affinity and efficacy: the interpretation of structure-activity relationships for agonists and of the effects of mutating receptors |journal=Br.

===Ternary complex model===
The original Ternary complex model was used to describe ligand, receptor, and G-protein interactions.  It uses equilibrium dissociation constants for the interactions between the receptor and each ligand (K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; for ligand A; K&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; for ligand B), as well as a cooperativity factor (α) that denotes the mutual effect of the two ligands on each other’s affinity for the receptor. An α &gt; 1.0 refers to positive allosteric modulation, an α &lt; 1.0 refers to negative allosteric modulation, and an α = 1.0 means that binding of either ligand to the receptor does not alter the affinity of the other ligand for the receptor (i.e., a neutral modulator).&lt;ref name="bridges2008"/&gt; Further, the α parameter can be added as a subtle but highly useful extension to the ATCM in order to include effects of an allosteric modulator on the efficacy (as distinct from the affinity) of another ligand that binds the receptor, such as the orthosteric agonist. Some ligands can reduce the efficacy but increase the affinity of the orthosteric agonist for the receptor.&lt;ref name="bridges2008"/&gt;

Although it is a simple assumption that the proportional amount of an active receptor state should correlate with the biological response, the experimental evidence for receptor overexpression and spare receptors suggests that the calculation of the net change in the active receptor state is a much better measure for response than is the fractional or proportional change. This is demonstrated by the effects of agonist/ antagonist combinations on the desensitization of receptors. This is also demonstrated by receptors that are activated by overexpression, since this requires a change between R and R* that is difficult to understand in terms of a proportional rather than a net change, and for the molecular model that fits with the mathematical model.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bio-balance.com/ijp.pdf Optimal Agonist/Antagonist Combinations Maintain Receptor Response by Preventing Rapid β-adrenergic Receptor Desensitization | BIO BALANCE]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bio-balance.com/JMGM_article.pdf Molecular dynamics of a biophysical model for b2-adrenergic and G protein-coupled receptor activation | BIO BALANCE]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bio-balance.com/Graphics.htm The Biophysical Basis for the Graphical Representations | BIO BALANCE]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postulates of receptor theory==
*[[Receptor (biochemistry)|Receptors]] must possess structural and steric specificity.
*Receptors are [[Saturation (chemistry)|saturable]] and finite (limited number of binding sites)
*Receptors must possess high [[Dissociation constant#Protein-ligand binding|affinity]] for its endogenous ligand at physiological concentrations
*Once the endogenous ligand binds to the receptor, some early recognizable chemical event must occur

[[File:Dutch, 17th century, Black boy with slave collar, Private Collection.jpg|thumb|upright|Black boy with [[slavery|slave collar]], Dutch 17th-century painting.]]

'''Representations of slavery in European art''' date back to ancient times. They show slaves of varied ethnicity, white as well as black.

In Europe, slavery became increasingly associated with blackness from the 17th century onwards. However, slaves before this period were predominantly white. The ''black'' in European art is not the same topic as the ''slave'' in European art: slaves were not always black and blacks not always slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Also note the ambiguity of the term "Turkish slave": a Turkish slave may be a Turk or someone enslaved by a Turk. See [[Turkish Slave]] for yet another layer of confusion about a picture by [[Parmigianino]].&lt;/ref&gt; The article also concentrates on European art rather than Western art in general.

== Slaves in art ==
[[File:Retrato de Juan Pareja, by Diego Velázquez.jpg|thumbnail|upright|''[[Portrait of Juan de Pareja]]'', by Velázquez]]
[[File:Alexandre Dumas (1762-1806).JPG|thumbnail|upright|Thomas Alexandre Dumas]]

From the Renaissance onwards, a substantial number of bound figures, often naked and crouching, illustrate enslavement.&lt;ref&gt;''The Slave in European Art: From Renaissance Trophy to Abolitionist Emblem'', ed Elizabeth McGrath and Jean Michel Massing, London (The Warburg Institute) and Turin 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This imagery had for one of its roots the ancient tradition of [[Roman Triumph]], but its contemporaneous relevance was greatly magnified by the prevalence of slavery within European countries. In particular, [[galley slaves]] were often used by artists as models for muscular nude bodies.

Sometimes the name of an individual who was a slave is known. One instance is  [[Juan de Pareja]] (1606–1670) who was a slave of [[Velázquez]] and was trained as a painter by the artist. Velázquez freed Juan de Pareja in 1650 and the document of manumission survives.&lt;ref&gt;See Carmen Fracchia's article in The Slave in European Art: From Renaissance Trophy to Abolitionist Emblem, ed Elizabeth McGrath and Jean Michel Massing, London (The Warburg Institute) and Turin 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The document which was discovered by [[Jennifer Montagu]] is in the Archivio di Stato in Rome. See ''Burlington Magazine'', volume 125,1983,pages 683-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Juan de Pareja became a successful artist himself.

[[Alexandre Dumas]] of ''The Three Musketeers'' fame, was the son of a slave, [[Thomas-Alexandre Dumas|also known as Alexandre]], who rose to be a general in chief in the French army. His portrait hardly suggests his early life as a slave. He was pawned by his father who was a French nobleman but was lucky enough to be retrieved by the father and brought up in France.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Reiss, ''The Black Count: Glory, Revolution, Betrayal, and the Real Count of Monte Cristo'' (New York: Crown Publishers, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frans Post]] (1612—1680) and [[Albert Eckhout]] (c.1610–1665) were two early Dutch painters to depict slavery. Post painted pictures of slaves working in  idyllic rural landscapes which do little to reflect the harsh realities of their life.&lt;ref&gt;See Ernest van den Boogaart article in ''The Slave in European Art: From Renaissance Trophy to Abolitionist Emblem'', ed Elizabeth McGrath and Jean Michel Massing, London (The Warburg Institute) and Turin 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Eckhout's work is a visual record of the ethnic mix in Dutch Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;See Jean Michel Massing in Studies in ''Imagery II: the World Discovered''. London 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Rebecca Parker Brienen, ''Albert Eckhout'', 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconographic aspects of slavery==


The trade in black Africans was widespread in Europe long before the [[Triangular Trade]] involving Europe, Africa and the Americas. Numerous portraits of high-class Europeans show them in the company of black figures, often children, whose status may be advertised by the silver [[slavery|slave collar]] being worn. A silver collar is usually worn in conjunction with luxurious clothes and other finery, which allowed the artist to show off his repertoire and the owner of the slave to show off his or her wealth. In fact, in the 17th and 18th centuries, it was the fashion among some wealthy Europeans to have their black household slaves or servants wear silver collars; these were often inscribed with the name of the owner or employer. The slave collar is seen in contemporary paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Slave in European Art: From Renaissance Trophies to Abolitionist Emblem| editor1= McGrath, Elizabeth  | editor2= Massing, Jean Michel |location= London |publisher=The Warburg Institute|date= 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chains, fetters, manacles, slave collars are the familiar iconographic markers of slavery with the broken chain being particularly useful for ''dis''-enslavement.{{cn|date=May 2014}} 

Slaves were chattel and so it is no surprise to see that they were on occasion branded like cattle in life and in art. Another sign of slavery, less obvious and much less gruesome, was the cropped pony tail or topknot which marked an enslaved Turk in the galleys.&lt;ref&gt;See articles by Elizabeth McGrath and Rick Scorza in ''The Slave in European Art: From Renaissance Trophy to Abolitionist Emblem'', ed Elizabeth McGrath and Jean Michel Massing, London (The Warburg Institute) and Turin 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Often slaves were  prisoners captured in war and  there is an iconographical overlap between the two.  Michelangelo's [[Dying Slave]] was not given this title by him. He instead talked of such figures as prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Echinger-Maurach, ''Studien zu Michelangelos Juliusgrabmal'', 2 vols, Hildesheim,  1991.&lt;/ref&gt; The slave status of Caryatids is similarly open to interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Vitruvius ''De Architectura'' I.1.4-5.&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is not always clear from a picture that a slave or a servant or a free person has been represented. Thus, it is unknown if the portrait of Juan de Pareja were painted by Velázquez while the former was still a slave. In any case, the portrait is not an image of enslavement, even if Juan de Pareja were a slave at the time of painting.{{cn|date=May 2014}}

== Abolitionism ==

[[File:Wedgwood - Anti-Slavery Medallion - Walters 482597.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Anti-Slavery Medallion by Josiah Wedgwood]]

With [[Abolitionism]], the imagery of enslavement was turned to a social and political purpose. An instance of this is the medallion devised for the movement by [[Josiah Wedgwood]] which shows a  pleading grateful black slave. People wore the medallion as a token of their commitment to abolitionism.

An example of an anti-Abolitionist image is that by [[George Cruikshank]], ''New Union Club''. It satirises what supposedly took place at a celebrated dinner organised by Abolitionists.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12789">'''Rollover Pass''' (also called '''Rollover Fish Pass''') is part of a low-elevation area and was subject to overflow during high tides or storms.  A man-made strait was cut through private property on the [[Bolivar Peninsula]] and links the [[Gulf of Mexico]] with Rollover Bay and East Bay on the upper [[Texas]] coast in eastern [[Galveston County]] ({{coord|29|30|N|94|30|W|}}). Located on property owned by the Gulf Coast Rod, Reel and Gun Club and managed by the Gilchrist Community Association, the Pass was opened in 1955 by the Texas Game and Fish Commission when they were granted an easement by the property owners.  The intent was to increase bay water [[salinity]], promote growth of submerged vegetation, and help marine fish to and from spawning and feeding areas in the bay.&lt;ref name="isbn0-9614885-0-6"&gt;{{cite book |title=Bolivar! Gulf Coast peninsula: features and facts, history, photographs, maps |publisher=Peninsula Press of Texas |location=Crystal Beach, TX |year=1985 |pages= |isbn=0-9614885-0-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pass is about 1600 feet long and 200 feet wide.  Large cement walls frame the Gulf side (southeast of Texas Highway 87) and steel bulkheads contain the sides of the Rollover Bay side northwest of the highway.

Rollover Pass earned its name from the practice of smugglers who, from the days of Spanish rule through [[prohibition]], avoided the Galveston customs station by rolling barrels of import or export merchandise (i.e., whiskey and rum) over the narrowest part of the peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/rkr05 Rollover Pass] Handbook of Texas Online&lt;/ref&gt;  A Texas Historical Marker, Number 7166, was erected in 1963 but was damaged by Hurricane Ike in 2008.  However, a portion of the marker is still visible and several lines of text refer to the action of the smugglers.

Rollover Pass is a popular location for fishing and birding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Ted Lee, Jr Eubanks |author2=Robert A. Behrstock |author3=Seth Davidson |title=Finding Birds On The Great Texas Coastal Birding Trail: Houston, Galveston, and the Upper Texas Coast (Texas A&amp;M Nature Guides) |publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press |location=College Station |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=1-58544-534-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Visitors come from all over the U.S. to camp, fish, and enjoy family recreation activities.  Parking and camping are available on all four quadrants and handicapped or elderly persons are able to fish while sitting in their vehicle.

A unique feature of Rollover Pass is the constantly changing water flow which brings a great variety of marine life through the area.  Incoming tides bring in salt water and organisms within, while outgoing tides not only bring them out again but also contain brackish or fresh water species.

Marine life seen at Rollover Pass includes blacktip sharks, red drum, black drum, speckled sea trout, flounder, sheephead, ladyfish or skipjacks, gafftop sail catfish, hardhead catfish, ribbonfish, needlefish, tripletail, Spanish mackerel, jack crevale, tarpon, pompano, croaker, sand trout, whiting, mullet, mud minnows, shad or menhaden, dogfish, brown shrimp, white shrimp, sea otters, blue crabs, stone crabs, and fiddler crabs.  Endangered species have also been sighted there, specifically green turtles, loggerhead turtles, and the American eel.  

Also seen are alligators and gar, especially during heavy rains.  Alligators travel from the back bayous and ponds into the salt water so that any parasites on their hide can be cleaned off.  

Freshwater runoff from surrounding rivers, bayous and diversionary canals drain into the Galveston Bay complex.  Much of the water going into East Bay via the Intracoastal Waterway from neighboring counties drains to the Gulf through Rollover Pass.  

Rollover Pass and Rollover Bay are a significant winter destination for many migrant bird species coming down from the northern states.  It is named as a destination point by several birding organizations and in the Texas Park and Wildlife Department Bolivar Loop map.&lt;ref&gt;[https://tpwd.texas.gov/huntwild/wildlife/wildlife-trails/coastal/upper/bolivar-loop Bolivar Loop] Texas Park and Wildlife Department, ''Great Texas Wildlife Trails''&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the Rollover Pass area is a federally protected critical habitat for the piping plover, an endangered species.&lt;ref&gt;Office of the Federal Register https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2001/07/10/01-16905/endangered-and-threatened-wildlife-and-plants-final-determination-of-critical-habitat-for-wintering Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Final Determination of Critical Habitat for Wintering Piping Plovers&lt;/ref&gt;

On the morning of September 13, 2008 [[Hurricane Ike]] came ashore near Galveston, Texas. The storm surge associated with [[Hurricane Ike]] devastated the adjoining coastal communities of [[Gilchrist, Texas|Gilchrist]] (northeast from Rollover Pass) and [[Caplen, Texas|Caplen]] (southwest from Rollover Pass) along with most of the [[Bolivar Peninsula]].

As of 2014, homes and businesses have been rebuilt in the area, new residents are settling in, and visitors once again are able to travel through that section of Highway 87. The Rollover Pass bridge has two lanes open instead of the original three. But Texas Historical Marker Number 7166 has yet to be replaced at the Pass.

== Lawsuits and Legislation ==

In May 2009 the 81st Texas legislature in regular session passed Senate Bill 2043.  A companion bill was House Bill 3986.  This authorized the commissioner of the Texas General Land Office to close or modify certain man-made passes if funds were appropriated by the legislature.  The bill and its supporting information may be seen at the Texas Legislature Online site, search 81(R) SB2043.  
http://www.legis.state.tx.us/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=81R&amp;Bill=SB2043

Subsequent actions by the GLO and Galveston County prompted the following court filings:  

''UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS, GALVESTON DIVISION''

''CIVIL ACTION NO. 3:13-CV-00126''

On April 19, 2013, the Gulf Coast Rod, Reel and Gun Club, Inc. and the Gilchrist Community Association filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court, Southern District of Texas, Galveston Division, against Jerry Patterson, Commissioner; the Texas General Land Office; the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; Col. Christopher W. Sallese, District Engineer, Galveston District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; Lt. Gen. Thomas P. Bostick, Commander and Chief of Engineers, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; and John M. McHugh, Secretary of the Army.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guidrynews.com/story.aspx?id=1000051471 Rollover Pass Litigation ] ''Guidry News Service; '' April 19, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The lawsuit was amended on January 13, 2014 to include additional assertions not discovered until after the original had been filed.&lt;ref&gt;''Guidry News Service'', http://www.guidrynews.com/14February/03414Complaint.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The private property owners, Gulf Coast Rod, Reel and Gun Club, and the GCA which manages the Pass property, have filed this suit to protect the Pass from being filled in with dirt and closed completely, thereby devastating an already storm-ravaged area and causing extreme hardship to the businesses who rely on tourism, and homeowners trying to rebuild after Hurricane Ike.  A petition with 2,868 signatures has many comments which demonstrate the commitment of the signers to keep the Pass open.&lt;ref&gt;Petition, change.org:  [http://www.change.org/petitions/galveston-county-judge-and-commissioners-do-not-take-eminent-domain-action-against-rollover-pass?utm_campaign=petition_created&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=guides Galveston County Judge and Commissioners, Do Not Take Eminent Domain Action Against Rollover Pass]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rolloverpasstexas.com/#! rolloverpasstexas.com] Gilchrist Community Association&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the concerns of both sides are:  private property rights; the best fishing location for handicapped persons on the Texas coast; government coercion; beach erosion; siltation of the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway; freshwater diversion; and economic effects.&lt;ref&gt;Wayne Stupka and Ted Vega, [http://www.crystalbeachlocalnews.com/?p=19250 "Keep Rollover Pass Open"] ''Crystal Beach Local News''&lt;/ref&gt;

Issues listed in the original lawsuit included:  the GLO has no ownership rights to the property; false representation of data to obtain a federal U.S. Army Corps of Engineers permit to close the Pass; violations of the U.S. Constitution; violations of Environmental Policy, Clean Water and Rehabilitation Act requirements; failure by the USACE to analyze impacts of actions by those closing the Pass; failure to perform analyses of alternatives in the best interest of the public and socioeconomic impact; Rehabilitation Act discrimination against mobility impaired persons by not providing any alternate accessible place; discrimination against disabled persons in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act; failure to consider and incorporate changes from Texas' recent judicial decision regarding public vs. private beaches;&lt;ref&gt;Severance vs. Patterson, Cause No. 09-0387&lt;/ref&gt; failure to address alternate structures such as jetties or groins to control sediment; and declaratory relief or injunction to prevent closure of Rollover Pass by the GLO&lt;ref&gt;Ted Vega and Wayne Stupka, [http://www.crystalbeachlocalnews.com/?p=20851 "Rollover Pass Litigation"] April 19, 2013, ''Crystal Beach Local News,''&lt;/ref&gt;

''GALVESTON COUNTY, TEXAS, CIVIL COURT #2''

''CIVIL CASE NUMBER CV76026''

On March 28, 2016 a Petition in Condemnation (OCA) was filed in Galveston County Civil Court to start eminent domain proceedings which would take the private property on which Rollover Pass is located.  The case number is CV76026, plaintiff County of Galveston, Texas,  defendant Gulf Coast Rod, Reel and Gun Club, Inc.  The Gilchrist Community Association is added on as a defendant also.  As of June 2017 various hearings, motions and discovery proceedings have taken place and a jury trial was scheduled for June 12, 2017.  A pending settlement is being discussed as of June 5.  

All documents filed in the court may be seen by going to the Galveston County Civil Court Records and searching by case number CV76026.  

http://publicaccess.co.galveston.tx.us/CaseDetail.aspx?CaseID=1266481 

In August 2017 the County Court at Law No. 2, Galveston County, Texas issued a Writ of Possession to take the property.  In the months thereafter, the county provided minimal maintenance services and the public was allowed continued access as per Bolivar beach regulations.  

In March 2018 an appeal was filed in the Court of Appeals, 14th District of Texas, Houston by the Gilchrist Community Association against the County of Galveston, Texas; Case No. 14-17-00681-CV.  

Issues presented included the following:  1. The County Court at Law erred in holding that the Gilchrist Community Association lacked standing; and 2. The County of Galveston lacked the statutory authority to obtain property by eminent domain when the purpose was to substitute the county's eminent domain authority for the non-existent power of the General Land Office of Texas.

==Video==

In December 2013 a video was produced and released by The Electric Theater Radio Hour in Galveston, Texas.  This video, entitled "Rollover Pass battles Patterson &amp; Galveston County on eminent domain threat" (sic) is hosted by George Lee, who interviews Ted Vega, president of the Gilchrist Community Association.  It outlines the conflict between the GCA and elected state and county officials, specifically Jerry Patterson, former commissioner of the Texas General Land Office; Mark Henry, county judge of Galveston County; and Ryan Dennard, commissioner of Precinct 1 in Galveston (term expires 2016) which includes Rollover Pass.

Photos by outdoor author and photographer Ed Snyder and others as well as artwork from young local area students are featured in the video and it can be viewed on You Tube.

The '''Royal Netherlands Institute of Southeast Asian and Caribbean Studies''' ({{lang-nl|Koninklijk Instituut voor Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde|lit = Royal Institute for the Linguistics, Geography and [[Ethnology]]}}, abbreviated: '''KITLV''') at [[Leiden]] was founded in 1851. Its objective is the advancement of the study of the [[anthropology]], [[linguistics]], [[social sciences]], and [[history]] of [[Southeast Asia]], the [[Pacific Area]], and the [[Caribbean]]. Special emphasis is laid on the former Dutch colonies of the [[Dutch East Indies]] (now [[Indonesia]]), [[Suriname]], and the [[Dutch West Indies]] (the [[Netherlands Antilles]] and [[Aruba]]). Its unique collection of books, manuscripts, prints and photographs attracts visiting scholars from all over the world. On July 1, 2014, the management of the collection was taken over by [[Leiden University Libraries]].

== Jakarta ==

In 1969, a KITLV office was started by [[Hans Ras]] in [[Jakarta]] ("KITLV-Jakarta"), as a part of an agreement with the [[Indonesian Institute of Sciences]]. Here, publications from Indonesia, [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]] are bought and given a place in the library of the institute, publications of the institute are sold, and original scientific works in the [[Dutch language]] are translated into [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]. The Jakarta office is, since July 1, 2014, part of [[Leiden University Libraries]] and Representative Office of Leiden University doubles as the [[representative office]] of Leiden University.

== Publications ==
The KITLV Press published and distributed academic books on Southeast Asian and Caribbean Studies. It also published three journals: 
* ''[[Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde]]'',  
* ''Journal of Indonesian Social Sciences and Humanities'', and  
* ''[[New West Indian Guide]] / Nieuwe West-Indische Gids''. 
[[Brill Publishers|Brill]] acquired KITLV Press in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brill.com/news/brill-completes-acquisition-kitlv-press Brill Completes Acquisition of KITLV Press]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Abbé pratiquant la simonie.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Abbot practising simony (France, 12th century)]]
'''Simony''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɪ|m|ə|n|i}} is the act of selling church offices and roles. It is named after [[Simon Magus]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Reader's Encyclopedia'' (1965), New York: Thomas Y. Crowell Company, vol.2, ''p.''932, "Simon."&lt;/ref&gt; who is described in the [[Acts of the Apostles]] 8:9–24 as having offered two disciples of [[Jesus]], [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and [[John the Apostle|John]], payment in exchange for their empowering him to impart the power of the [[Holy Spirit]] to anyone on whom he would [[Laying on of hands|place his hands]].  The term extends to other forms of trafficking for money in "spiritual things."&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1880)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="halsbury832"&gt;''Halsbury'' '''832'''&lt;/ref&gt; Simony was one of the important issues during the [[Investiture Controversy]].

==History==
===Catholic Church===
Although an offense against [[canon law]], Simony became widespread in the [[Catholic Church]] in the 9th and 10th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions, edited by Wendy Doniger, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; In the canon law, the word bears a more extended meaning than in [[English law]]. ''Simony according to the canonists'', says [[John Ayliffe]] in his ''[[John Ayliffe#Works|Parergon]]'',
{{quote|"...is defined to be a deliberate act or a premeditated will and desire of selling such things as are spiritual, or of anything annexed unto spirituals, by giving something of a temporal nature for the purchase thereof; or in other terms it is defined to be a commutation of a thing spiritual or annexed unto spirituals by giving something that is temporal."}}

[[File:Tizian 109.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Girolamo and cardinal Marco Corner investing Marco, abbot of Carrara, with his benefice, [[Titian]], ca 1520&lt;/center&gt;]]

In the ''[[Corpus Juris Canonici]]'' the Decretum&lt;ref&gt;Pt. ii. cause i. quest. 3&lt;/ref&gt; and the Decretals&lt;ref&gt;Bk. v. tit. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; deal with the subject. The offender whether ''simoniacus'' (the perpetrator of a simoniacal transaction) or ''simoniace promotus'' (the beneficiary of a simoniacal transaction), was liable to deprivation of his benefice and deposition from orders if a [[Secular clergy|secular priest]], or to confinement in a stricter [[monastery]] if a [[Regular clergy|regular]]. No distinction seems to have been drawn between the sale of an immediate and of a reversionary interest. The innocent ''simoniace promotus'' was, apart from dispensation, liable to the same penalties as though he were guilty.{{clarify|date=August 2013}}

Certain matters were simoniacal by the [[canon law]] but would not be regarded as such in English law.{{efn|For example, the sale of [[tithes]], the taking of a fee for [[Confession (religion)|confession]], absolution, marriage or burial, the concealment of one in [[mortal sin]] or the reconcilement of an impenitent for the sake of gain, and the doing of [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] for spiritualities.}} So grave was the crime of simony considered that even infamous persons (deprived of citizens' rights due to conviction) could accuse another of it. English provincial and [[legatine]] constitutions continually assailed simony.

===Church of England===
The [[Church of England]] struggled with the practice after its separation from Rome. For the purposes of [[English law]], simony is defined by [[William Blackstone]] as "obtain[ing] orders, or a licence to preach, by money or corrupt practices"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blackstone|first=William|title=[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]] vol I|date=1765|pages=376–7|place=Oxford|publisher=Clarendon Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, more narrowly, "the corrupt presentation of any one to an ecclesiastical [[benefice]] for gift or reward".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blackstone|first=William|title=[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]] vol IV|date=1769|page=62|place=Oxford|publisher=Clarendon Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While [[English and Welsh law|English law]] recognized simony as an offence,&lt;ref&gt;'''3''' ''[[Edward Coke|Coke's Institutes]]'' 153–156&lt;/ref&gt; it treated it as merely an ecclesiastical matter, rather than a crime, for which the punishment was forfeiture of the office or any advantage from the offence and severance of any patronage relationship with the person who bestowed the office. Both [[Edward VI of England]] and [[Elizabeth I]] promulgated statutes against simony, in the latter case through the [[Simony Act 1588]].  The cases of [[Bishop of St. David's]] [[Thomas Watson (Bishop of St David's)|Thomas Watson]] in 1699&lt;ref&gt;Handley, S. (2004) "[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/28868 Watson, Thomas (1637–1717)]", ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', Oxford University Press. Retrieved 21 August 2007 (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt; and of [[Dean of York]] [[Sir William Cockburn, 11th Baronet|William Cockburn]] in 1841 were particularly notable.&lt;ref name="times410410"&gt;''[[The Times]]'', 10 April 1841, p.6 col.b, reprinted from the ''Cambridge Advertiser''&lt;/ref&gt;

By the [[Benefice]]s Act 1892, a person guilty of simony is guilty of an offence for which he may be proceeded against under the Clergy Discipline Act 1892. An innocent clerk is under no disability, as he might be by the canon law. Simony may be committed in three ways – in promotion to orders, in presentation to a [[benefice]], and in resignation of a [[benefice]]. The [[common law]] (with which the canon law is incorporated, as far as it is not contrary to the common or statute law or the prerogative of [[the Crown]]) has been considerably modified by statute. Where no statute applies to the case, the doctrines of the canon law may still be of authority.

{{As of|2011}}, simony remains an offence.&lt;ref name="halsbury832"&gt;''Halsbury'' '''832'''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="halsbury1359"&gt;''Halsbury'' '''1359'''&lt;/ref&gt; An unlawfully bestowed office can be declared void by [[the Crown]], and the offender can be disabled from making future appointments and fined up to £1000.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simony Act 1588]], s.4&lt;/ref&gt; Clergy are no longer required to make a declaration as to simony on [[ordination]], but offences are now likely to be dealt with under the [[Clergy Discipline Measure 2003]],&lt;ref&gt;2003 No.3&lt;/ref&gt; r.8.&lt;ref name="halsbury1359"/&gt;

'''Toxicofera''' (Greek for "those who bear [[toxin]]s") is a proposed [[clade]] of [[squamata|scaled reptiles]] (squamates) that includes the [[snake|Serpentes]] (snakes), [[Anguimorpha]] (monitor lizards, gila monster, and alligator lizards) and [[Iguania]] (iguanas, agamas, and chameleons). Toxicofera contains about 4,600 species, (nearly 60%) of [[extant taxon|extant]] squamata.&lt;ref name="Fry2006"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature04328 |pmid=16292255 |title=Early evolution of the venom system in lizards and snakes |journal=Nature |volume=439 |issue=7076 |pages=584–8 |year=2005 |last1=Fry |first1=Bryan G. |last2=Vidal |first2=Nicolas |last3=Norman |first3=Janette A. |last4=Vonk |first4=Freek J. |last5=Scheib |first5=Holger |last6=Ramjan |first6=S.

{{Further|Evolution of snake venom}}
Venom in squamates has historically been considered a rarity; while it has been [[Asp (reptile)|known in Serpentes since ancient times]], the actual percentage of [[venomous snake|snake species considered venomous]] was relatively small (around 25%).&lt;ref name="Fry2009"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jprot.2009.01.009 |pmid=19457354 |title=Evolution and diversification of the Toxicofera reptile venom system |journal=Journal of Proteomics |volume=72 |issue=2 |pages=127–36 |year=2009 |last1=Fry |first1=Bryan G. |last2=Vidal |first2=Nicolas |last3=Van Der Weerd |first3=Louise |last4=Kochva |first4=Elazar |last5=Renjifo |first5=Camila }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the approximately 2,650 species of advanced snakes (Caenophidia), only the front-fanged species (~650) were considered venomous by the anthropocentric definition.
Following the classification of Helodermatidae in the 19th century, their venom was thought to have developed independently.&lt;ref name="Fry2006" /&gt; In snakes, the venom gland is in the upper jaw, but in helodermatids, it is found in the lower jaw.&lt;ref name="Fry2006" /&gt; The origin of venom in squamates was thus considered relatively recent in [[evolution]]ary terms and the result of [[convergent evolution]] among the seemingly-[[polyphyletic]] venomous snake [[Family (biology)|families]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

In 2003  a study was published that described venom in snake subfamilies previously thought to lack it.&lt;ref name="Fry2003"&gt;
{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00239-003-2461-2 |pmid=12962311 |title=Molecular Evolution and Phylogeny of Elapid Snake Venom Three-Finger Toxins |journal=Journal of Molecular Evolution |volume=57 |issue=1 |pages=110–29 |year=2003 |last1=Fry |first1=B.

P. |bibcode=2003JMolE..57..110F }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Further study claimed nearly all "non-venomous" snakes produce venom to a certain extent, suggesting a single, and thus far more ancient origin for venom in Serpentes than had been considered until then.&lt;ref name="Fry2003-ratsnake"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00239-003-2497-3 |pmid=14708577 |title=Isolation of a Neurotoxin (α-colubritoxin) from a Nonvenomous Colubrid: Evidence for Early Origin of Venom in Snakes |journal=Journal of Molecular Evolution |volume=57 |issue=4 |pages=446–52 |year=2003 |last1=Fry |first1=Bryan G. |last2=Lumsden |first2=Natalie G. |last3=Wüster |first3=Wolfgang |last4=Wickramaratna |first4=Janith C. |last5=Hodgson |first5=Wayne C. |last6=Manjunatha Kini |first6=R. |bibcode=2003JMolE..57..446F }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fry2004"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/molbev/msh091 |pmid=15014162 |title=Assembling an Arsenal: Origin and Evolution of the Snake Venom Proteome Inferred from Phylogenetic Analysis of Toxin Sequences |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=870–83 |year=2004 |last1=Fry |first1=B. G. |last2=Wüster |first2=W }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a practical matter, Fry cautioned:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/12/031216075937.htm Venom Hunt Finds 'Harmless' Snakes A Potential Danger] December 16, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Some non-venomous snakes have been previously thought to have only mild 'toxic [[saliva]]'. But these results suggest that they actually possess true venoms. We even isolated from a [[rat snake]]'' [''Coelognathus radiatus'' (formerly known as ''[[Elaphe radiata]]'')&lt;ref name="Fry2003-ratsnake" /&gt;]'', a snake common in pet stores, a typical [[cobra]]-style [[neurotoxin]], one that is as potent as comparative toxins found in close relatives of the cobra. These snakes typically have smaller quantities of venom and lack fangs, but they can still deliver their venom via their numerous sharp teeth. But not all of these snakes are dangerous. It does mean, however, that we need to re-evaluate the relative danger of non-venomous snakes.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This prompted further research, which led to the discovery of venom (and venom [[genes]]) in species from groups which were not previously known to produce it, e.g. in Iguania (specifically ''[[Pogona barbata]]'' from the family [[Agamidae]]) and Varanidae (from ''[[Varanus varius]]'').&lt;ref name="Fry2006" /&gt;  It is thought that this was the result of descent from a common venom-producing squamate ancestor; the hypothesis was described simply as the "venom clade" when first proposed to the [[scientific community]].&lt;ref name="Fry2006" /&gt;  The venom clade included Anguidae for [[phylogenetic]] reasons and adopted a previously suggested clade name: Toxicofera.&lt;ref name="Vidal2005"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.crvi.2005.10.001 |pmid=16286089 |title=The phylogeny of squamate reptiles (lizards, snakes, and amphisbaenians) inferred from nine nuclear protein-coding genes |journal=Comptes Rendus Biologies |volume=328 |issue=10–11 |pages=1000–8 |year=2005 |last1=Vidal |first1=Nicolas |last2=Hedges |first2=S. Blair }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was estimated that the common ancestral species that first developed venom in the venom clade lived on the order of 200 million years ago.&lt;ref name="Fry2006" /&gt;  The venoms are thought to have evolved after genes normally active in various parts of the body [[Gene duplication|duplicated]] and the copies found new use in the [[salivary glands]].&lt;ref name="Fry2003" /&gt;

Among snake families traditionally classified as venomous, the capacity seems to have evolved to extremes more than once by [[parallel evolution]]; 'non-venomous' snake lineages have either lost the ability to produce venom (but may still have lingering venom [[pseudogene]]s) or actually do produce venom in small quantities (e.g. 'toxic saliva'), likely sufficient to assist in small prey capture, but not normally causing harm to humans if bitten.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

The newly discovered diversity of squamate species producing venoms is a [[Treasure trove#Terminology|treasure trove]] for those seeking to develop new [[pharmaceutical]] drugs; many of these venoms lower [[blood pressure]], for example.&lt;ref name="Fry2006" /&gt;  Previously known venomous squamates have already provided the basis for [[medication]]s such as [[Ancrod]], [[Captopril]], [[Eptifibatide]], [[Exenatide]] and [[Tirofiban]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

The world's largest venomous lizard and the largest species of venomous land animal is the [[Komodo dragon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guinness World Records 2014|last=Glenday|first=Craig|publisher=The Jim Pattison Group|year=2013|isbn=9781908843159|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}{{page needed|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism ===

Other scientists such as [[Washington State University]] biologist Kenneth V. Kardong and toxicologists Scott A. Weinstein and Tamara L. Smith, have stated that the allegation of venom glands found in many of these animals "has had the effect of underestimating the variety of complex roles played by oral secretions in the biology of reptiles, produced a very narrow view of oral secretions and resulted in misinterpretation of reptilian evolution". According to these scientists "reptilian oral secretions contribute to many biological roles other than to quickly dispatch prey". These researchers concluded that, "Calling all in this clade venomous implies an overall potential danger that does not exist, misleads in the assessment of medical risks, and confuses the biological assessment of squamate biochemical systems".&lt;ref name="Mackessy2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weinstein|first1=Scott A.|last2=Smith|first2=Tamara L.|last3=Kardong|first3=Kenneth V.|editor=Stephen P.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3946">In [[linguistics]], '''transformational syntax''' is a derivational approach to [[syntax]] that developed from the extended standard theory of [[generative grammar]] originally proposed by [[Noam Chomsky]] in his books ''[[Syntactic Structures]]'' and ''[[Aspects of the Theory of Syntax]]''.&lt;ref name="Akmajian"&gt;Akmajian, Adrian; Heny, Frank ''An Introduction To The Principles Of Transformational Syntax'' MIT Press, {{ISBN|9780262510226}}&lt;/ref&gt; It emerged from a need to improve on approaches to [[grammar]] in [[structural linguistics]]. 

Particularly in early incarnations, transformational syntax adopted the view that [[phrase structure grammar]] must be enriched by a transformational grammar, with [[syntactic rules]] or [[syntactic operations]] that alter the base structures created by phrase structure rules. In more recent theories, including [[Government and Binding Theory]] but especially in [[Minimalist program|Minimalism]], the strong distinction between phrase structure and transformational components has largely been abandoned, with operations that build structure ([[phrase structure rules]]) and those that change structure ([[transformational rules]]) either interleaved, or unified under a single operation (as in the Minimalist operation [[Merge (linguistics)|Merge]]). 

==Overview==
{{Main|Transformational grammar}}
According to the Chomskyan tradition, [[language acquisition]] is easy for children because they are born with a [[universal grammar]] in their minds. The tradition also distinguishes between [[linguistic competence]], what a person knows of a language, and [[linguistic performance]], how a person uses it. Finally, grammars and metagrammars are ranked by three [[levels of adequacy]]: observational, descriptive, and explanatory. A core aspect of the original Standard Theory is a distinction between two different representations of a sentence, called [[deep structure]] and [[surface structure]]. The two representations are linked to each other by a set of transformation rules, the totality of these rules is what constitute grammar, and what a grammatical description of a language should present. Under this theory, a speaker must have access to both structures to interpret an expression.

Under this model, syntax was placed in the center of linguistic research and sought to go beyond description. Scholars explored the formalism of syntax and psychology of grammar under this model. This led to more systematic research on linguistic data such as [[native speaker]] judgments and distinctions in [[grammaticality]].

Many notable linguists have written on the topic, including [[Andrew Radford (linguist)|Andrew Radford]],&lt;ref name="radford"&gt;Radford, Andrew (1982). ''Transformational Syntax: A Student's Guide to Chomsky's Extended Standard Theory'' Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521285742}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rodney Huddleston]],&lt;ref name="huddleston"&gt;Huddleston, Rodney D. (1976). ''An Introduction to English Transformational Syntax.'' Longman, {{ISBN|9780582550629}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Roger Fowler]].&lt;ref name="Fowler"&gt;Fowler, Roger (1971). ''An Introduction to Transformational Syntax.''  Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, {{ISBN|9780389041528}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aspects of transformational syntax were revised or replaced under the [[Minimalist program]].&lt;ref name="Stabler"&gt;Stabler, Edward P. (2000). Minimalist grammars and recognition. Manuscript for the SFB340 workshop at Bad Teinach&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-transformational syntax===

Non-transformational syntax describes competing models. The main non-transformational syntactic frameworks include [[head-driven phrase structure grammar]], [[lexical-functional grammar]], [[categorial grammar]], and [[simpler syntax]].&lt;ref name="borsley"&gt;Borsley, Robert; Börjars, Kersti, eds. (2011). ''Non-Transformational Syntax: Formal and Explicit Models of Grammar .'' Wiley-Blackwell {{ISBN|978-0631209652}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Treatise on the Gods''''' (1930) is [[H. L. Mencken]]'s survey of the history and philosophy of [[religion]], and was intended as an unofficial companion volume to his [[Treatise on Right and Wrong]] (1934).&lt;ref&gt;https://openlibrary.org/b/OL14380373M/Treatise_on_right_and_wrong&lt;/ref&gt; The first and second printings were sold out before publication, and eight more printings followed.&lt;ref&gt;''Treatise on the Gods'', preface to the Revised Edition&lt;/ref&gt;  Its first edition received a major 5-column review in the ''[[New York Times]]'', written by one P.W. Wilson;&lt;ref&gt;See the NYT online archive&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Marxism|Marxist]] literary critic [[Granville Hicks]] called it "the best popular account we have of the origin and nature of religion." However, the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] theologian [[Reinhold Niebuhr]], writing in the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'', claimed that "It is only in dealing with moral and social issues that [Mencken] achieves the heights of complete detachment, and in this case the detachment is that of a cynic rather than that of a scientist." By the end of its first year ''Treatise'' had sold thirteen thousand copies.&lt;ref&gt;''The Skeptic: A Life of H. L. Mencken'', by [[Terry Teachout]]&lt;/ref&gt; By 1940 its popularity had waned, and although it went temporarily out of print in 1945, Mencken considered it "my best book, and by far."&lt;ref&gt;''The Skeptic: A Life of H. L. Mencken'', by [[Terry Teachout]]&lt;/ref&gt; At the request of its original publisher [[Alfred A Knopf]], Mencken wrote a revised edition (1946), eliminating (among other changes) a controversial quote about [[Jews]]:

:The Jews could be put down very plausibly as the most unpleasant race ever heard of. As commonly encountered, they lack many of the qualities that mark the civilized man: courage, dignity, incorruptibility, ease, confidence. They have vanity without pride, voluptuousness without taste, and learning without wisdom. Their fortitude, such as it is, is wasted upon puerile objects, and their charity is mainly a form of display.&lt;ref&gt;''Treatise on the Gods'', 1930, pp. 345–46&lt;/ref&gt;

A year after publication the ''[[New York Times]]'' published another review, this one by [[Philip Wylie]] and accompanied by a [[caricature]] of Mencken by [[Miguel Covarrubias|Covarrubias]]. Wylie referred to the book as a "[[Tourbillon (disambiguation)|tourbillon]] by the [[Burgrave]] of [[Baltimore]]". Two more editions of the book followed, in 1997 and 2006.

'''Turkey slap''' is a [[Human sexual activity|sexual behaviour]] in which a male slaps a partner's face repeatedly with his [[penis]]. While the act of hitting another's face with the penis can be a sexual act, the term "turkey slap" refers to the act when performed in a non-sexual way either playfully or to shame, degrade or harass the victim. More recently this has been popularized in the Netherlands in the form of [[swaffelen]]. 

The term gained notoriety in [[Australia]] during 2006, after two male contestants in the ''[[Big Brother 6 (Australia)|Big Brother]]'' reality TV series performed the act on a female housemate. In the ensuing controversy, the male housemates were expelled from the house and contest for violating the show's terms of agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,21630096-5012853,00.html|title=Big Brother turkey-slap baby|author=Darren Cartwright|date=April 27, 2007|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[News Limited]]|accessdate=28 August 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318153323/http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,21630096-5012853,00.html|archivedate=18 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.duncanriley.com/big-brother-turkey-slap-transcript/ |title=Big Brother Turkey Slap Transcript|website=duncanriley.com|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Urban agriculture,''' '''urban farming''', or '''urban gardening''' is the practice of cultivating, processing and distributing [[food]] in or around [[urban areas]].&lt;ref&gt;Bailkey, M., and J. Nasr. 2000. "From Brownfields to Greenfields: Producing Food in North American Cities," ''Community Food Security News''. Fall 1999/Winter 2000:6&lt;/ref&gt; Urban agriculture can also involve [[animal husbandry]], [[aquaculture]], [[agroforestry]], [[urban beekeeping]], and [[horticulture]]. These activities occur in [[peri-urban]] areas as well, and [[peri-urban agriculture]] may have different characteristics.&lt;ref name="otherurbanag"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fanrpan.org/archive/documents/d00780/|title=The role of urban agriculture in addressing household poverty and food security: the case of Zambia|author1=Hampwaye, G.|author2=Nel, E.|date=|website=|publisher=Gdnet.org|accessdate=1 April 2013|author3=Ingombe, L.|lastauthoramp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Urban agriculture can reflect varying levels of economic and social development. It may be a social movement for sustainable communities, where organic growers, "foodies," and "[[locavore]]s" form social networks founded on a shared ethos of nature and community holism. These networks can evolve when receiving formal institutional support, becoming integrated into local town planning as a "transition town" movement for sustainable urban development. For others, [[food security]], nutrition, and income generation are key motivations for the practice. In either case, more direct access to fresh vegetables, fruits, and meat products through urban agriculture can improve food security and [[food safety]].

In semi-desert towns of Persia, oases were fed through aqueducts that carried mountain water to support intensive food production, nurtured by wastes from the communities.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Continuous productive urban landscapes : designing urban agriculture for sustainable cities|last=André.|first=Viljoen|date=2005|publisher=Architectural Press|others=Bohn, Katrin., Howe, J. (Joe)|isbn=9780750655439|location=Oxford|oclc=60533269}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Machu Picchu]], water was conserved and reused as part of the stepped architecture of the city, and vegetable beds were designed to gather sun in order to prolong the growing season.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 

[[File:City experiment in gardening, New York City LCCN93501876.jpg|thumb|left|A gardening demonstration in New York City, 1922]] The idea of supplemental food production beyond rural farming operations and distant imports is not new. It has been used during war and depression times when food shortage issues arose, as well as during times of relative abundance. [[Allotment garden]]s came up in Germany in the early 19th century as a response to poverty and food insecurity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www2.gtz.de/Dokumente/oe44/ecosan/nl/en-allotment-gardens-cagayan-de-oro-2005.pdf |title=untitles |access-date=13 March 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719034258/http://www2.gtz.de/Dokumente/oe44/ecosan/nl/en-allotment-gardens-cagayan-de-oro-2005.pdf |archive-date=19 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1893, citizens of a depression-struck [[Detroit]] were asked to use any vacant lots to grow vegetables. They were nicknamed Pingree's Potato Patches after the mayor, [[Hazen S. Pingree]], who came up with the idea. He intended for these gardens to produce income, food supply, and even boost independence during times of hardship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hazen S. Pingree Monument|url=http://historicdetroit.org/building/hazen-s-pingree-monument/|website=http://historicdetroit.org/|publisher=DAN AUSTIN}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Victory garden]]s sprouted during WWI and WWII and were fruit, vegetable, and herb gardens in US, Canada, and UK. This effort was undertaken by citizens to reduce pressure on food production that was to support the war effort. 

During the first World War, President Woodrow Wilson called upon all American citizens to utilize any available open space for food growth, seeing this as a way to pull them out of a potentially damaging situation. Because most of Europe was consumed with war, they were unable to produce sufficient food supplies to be shipped to the U.S., and a new plan was implemented with the intent to feed the U.S. and even supply a surplus to other countries in need. By the year 1919, over 5 million plots were growing food and over 500 million pounds of produce was harvested. 

[[File:MONTREUIL - Le clos des peches.jpg|thumb|Peaches in [[Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis]], [[France]]]]
A very similar practice came into use during the Great Depression that provided a purpose, a job, and food to those who would otherwise be without anything during such harsh times. In this case, these efforts helped to raise spirits socially as well as to boost economic growth. Over 2.8 million dollars worth of food was produced from the subsistence gardens during the Depression. By the time of the Second World War, the War/Food Administration set up a National Victory Garden Program that set out to systematically establish functioning agriculture within cities. With this new plan in action, as many as 5.5 million Americans took part in the victory garden movement and over 9 million pounds of fruit and vegetables were grown a year, accounting for 44% of U.S.-grown produce throughout that time.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

[[Community garden]]ing in most communities are open to the public and provide space for citizens to cultivate plants for food or recreation. A community gardening program that is well-established is Seattle's [[P-Patch]]. The grassroots [[permaculture]] movement has been hugely influential in the renaissance of urban agriculture throughout the world.  The Severn Project in Bristol was started in 2010 for £2500 and provides 34 tons of produce per year, employing people from disadvantaged backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Severn Project|url=http://www.thesevernproject.org/our-story/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|City farm}}''City farms'' are agricultural plots in [[urban area]]s, which involve people working with [[Animal agriculture|animals]] and plants to produce food. City farms are usually [[Community gardening|community-run gardens]] which aim to improve community relationships and offer an awareness of [[agriculture]] and [[farming]] to people who live in urbanized areas. City farms are important sources of [[food security]] for many communities around the globe. City farms vary in size from small plots in private yards to larger farms that occupy a number of acres. In 1996, a United Nations report estimated there are over 800 million people worldwide who grow food and raise livestock in cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Lawson| first=Laura| date=2016-12-22| title=Agriculture: Sowing the city| url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v540/n7634/full/540522a.html| journal=Nature| language=en| volume=540| issue=7634| pages=522–524| doi=10.1038/540522a| issn=0028-0836| bibcode=2016Natur.540..522L}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although some city farms have paid employees, most rely heavily on volunteer labour, and some are run by volunteers alone. Other city farms operate as partnerships with [[local authority|local authorities]].

During the 1960s a number of [[community gardens]] were established in the [[United Kingdom]], influenced by the community garden movement in the [[United States]]. The first city farm was set up in 1972 in [[Kentish Town]], [[London]]. It combined farm animals with gardening space, an addition inspired by children's farms in the [[Netherlands]]. Other city farms followed across London and the United Kingdom. In Australia, several city farms exist in various capital cities. In [[Melbourne]], the [[Collingwood Children's Farm]] was established in 1979 on the Abbotsford Precinct Heritage Farmlands (the APHF), the oldest continually farmed land in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], farmed since 1838.

In 2010, New York City saw the building and opening of the world's largest privately owned and operated [[rooftop farm]], followed by an even larger location in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/new-york-could-grown-all-its-own-food-180949748/|title=History, Travel, Arts, Science, People, Places - Smithsonian|work=smithsonianmag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both were a result of municipal programs such as The Green Roof Tax Abatement Program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/dob/html/sustainability/green_roofs.shtml|title=Department of Buildings|work=nyc.gov|access-date=9 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160213083527/http://www.nyc.gov/html/dob/html/sustainability/green_roofs.shtml|archive-date=13 February 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Green Infrastructure Grant Program.&lt;ref&gt;https://a826-web01.nyc.gov/GIGrant/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perspectives==

===Resource and economic===
The Urban Agriculture Network has defined urban agriculture as:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Urban agriculture : food, jobs and sustainable cities|date=1996|publisher=United Nations Development Programme|others=Cheema, G. Shabbir., Smit, Jac., Ratta, Annu., Nasr, Joe., United Nations Development Programme., Urban Agriculture Network.|isbn=9789211260472|location=New York, N.Y.|oclc=34575217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[A]n industry that produces, processes, and markets food, fuel, and other outputs, largely 
in response to the daily demand of consumers within a town, city, or [[metropolis]], on many 
types of privately and publicly held land and water bodies found throughout intra-urban and 
peri-urban areas. Typically urban agriculture applies [[intensive agriculture|intensive production]] methods, 
frequently using and reusing natural resources and urban wastes, to yield a diverse array of 
land-, water-, and air-based fauna and flora contributing to the food security, health, 
livelihood, and environment of the individual, household, and community.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Globalization has removed the need and ability of a community's agency in their food production. This results in an inability to address food injustice on a smaller, more manageable scale. This is especially true in cities. Today, most cities have lots of vacant land due to urban sprawl and home foreclosures. This land could be used to address food insecurity. One study of Cleveland shows that city could actually meet up to 100% of its fresh produce need. This would prevent up to $115 million in annual economic leakage. Using the rooftop space of New York City would also be able to provide roughly twice the amount of space necessary to supply New York City with its green vegetable yields. Space could be even better optimized through the usage of hydroponic or indoor factory production of food. Growing gardens within cities would also cut down on the amount of food waste. In order to fund these projects, it would require financial capital in the form of private enterprises or government funding. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grewal|first=Sharanbir S.|last2=Grewal|first2=Parwinder S.|title=Can cities become self-reliant in food?|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0264275111000692|journal=Cities|volume=29|issue=1|pages=1–11|doi=10.1016/j.cities.2011.06.003|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Environmental===
The [[Council for Agricultural Science and Technology]] (CAST) defines urban agriculture to include aspects of environmental health, remediation, and recreation:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cast-science.org |author=Butler, L. and D.M. Moronek (eds.)|date=May 2002 |title=Urban and Agriculture Communities: Opportunities for Common Ground |publisher=Council for Agricultural Science and Technology |location=Ames, Iowa |accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Urban agriculture is a complex system encompassing a spectrum of interests, from a traditional core of activities associated with the production, processing, marketing, distribution, and consumption, to a multiplicity of other benefits and services that are less widely acknowledged and documented. These include recreation and leisure; economic vitality and business entrepreneurship, individual health and well-being; community health and well being; landscape beautification; and environmental restoration and remediation.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Modern planning and design initiatives&lt;ref name="Boeing2016"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://geoffboeing.com/publications/how-neighborhoods-lost-food/|author=Boeing, G.|title=How Our Neighborhoods Lost Food, and How They Can Get It Back|journal=Progressive Planning|date=2016|volume=206|issue=Winter|pages=35–37|accessdate=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; are often more responsive to this model of urban agriculture because it fits within the current scope of [[sustainable design]]. The definition allows for a multitude of interpretations across cultures and time. Frequently it is tied to policy decisions to build sustainable cities.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fraser | first1 = Evan D.G. | year = 2002 | title = Urban Ecology in Bangkok Thailand: Community Participation, Urban Agriculture and Forestry | url = | journal = Environments | volume = 30 | issue = | page = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Urban farms also provide unique opportunities for individuals, especially those living in cities, to get actively involved with ecological citizenship. By reconnecting with food production and nature, urban community gardening teaches individuals the skills necessary to participate in a democratic society. Decisions must be made on a group-level basis in order to run the farm. Most effective results are achieved when residents of a community are asked to take on more active roles in the farm. &lt;ref&gt;Katharine Travaline &amp; Christian Hunold (2010) Urban agriculture and ecological citizenship in Philadelphia, Local Environment, 15:6, 581-590, DOI: 10.1080/13549839.2010.487529&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food security===
{{main article |Food security}}
Access to nutritious food, both economically and geographically, is another perspective in the effort to locate food and livestock production in cities. With the tremendous influx of world population to urban areas, the need for fresh and safe food is increased. The [[Community Food Security Coalition]] (CFSC) defines food security as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
All persons in a community having access to culturally acceptable, nutritionally adequate food through local, non-emergency sources at all times.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Areas faced with food security issues have limited choices, often relying on highly [[food processing|processed]] [[fast food]] or convenience store foods that are high in calories and low in nutrients, which may lead to elevated rates of diet-related illnesses such as diabetes. These problems have brought about the concept of [[food justice]] which Alkon and Norgaard (2009; 289) explain is, "places access to healthy, affordable, culturally appropriate food in the contexts of institutional racism, racial formation, and racialized geographies.... Food justice serves as a theoretical and political bridge between scholarship and activism on sustainable agriculture, food insecurity, and [[environmental justice]]." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1111/j.1475-682x.2009.00291.x |title=Breaking the Food Chains: An Investigation of Food Justice Activism |journal=Sociological Inquiry |volume=79 |issue=3 |pages=289–305 |year=2009 |last1=Alkon |first1=Alison Hope |last2=Norgaard |first2=Kari Marie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some systematic reviews have already explored urban agriculture contribution to food security and other determinants of health outcomes (see &lt;ref name="Audate PP, Fernandez MA, Cloutier G, Lebel A 2018"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2196/resprot.9427 |pmid=29588270 |pmc=5893886 |title=Impacts of Urban Agriculture on the Determinants of Health: Scoping Review Protocol |journal=JMIR |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=e89 |year=2018 |last1=Audate |first1=PP |last2=Fernandez |first2=MA |last3=Cloutier |first3=G |last4=Lebel |first4=A }} http://www.researchprotocols.org/2018/3/e89&lt;/ref&gt;)

==Impact==

===Economic===
Urban and peri-urban agriculture (UPA) expands the economic base of the city through production, processing, packaging, and [[agricultural marketing|marketing]] of consumable products. This results in an increase in entrepreneurial activities and the [[job creation|creation of jobs]], as well as reducing food costs and improving quality.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Urban agriculture for sustainable cities: using wastes and idle land and water bodies as resources. Jac Smit, Joe Nasr. ''Environment and Urbanization,'' Vol 4, Issue 2, pp. 141 - 152. First Published October 1, 1992. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1177/095624789200400214&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; UPA provides employment, income, and access to food for urban populations, which helps to relieve chronic and emergency food insecurity. Chronic food insecurity refers to less affordable food and growing [[urban poverty]], while emergency food insecurity relates to breakdowns in the chain of [[food distribution]]. UPA plays an important role in making food more affordable and in providing emergency supplies of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/fcit/upa/en/ |author=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations |title=Urban and Peri-urban Agriculture, Household Food Security and Nutrition |publisher=FAO |accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research into market values for produce grown in urban gardens has attributed to a [[community garden]] plot a median yield value of between approximately $200 and $500 (US, adjusted for inflation).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sarep.ucdavis.edu/newsltr/v7n3/sa-10.htm Sommers, L., and B. Butterfield, as cited in: Blair, D., C. Giesecke, and S. Sherman. (1991). "A Dietary, Social and Economic Evaluation of the Philadelphia Urban Gardening Project," ''Journal of Nutrition Education''.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716000637/http://www.sarep.ucdavis.edu/newsltr/v7n3/sa-10.htm |date=16 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social===
[[File:Kstovo-hay-1536.jpg|thumb|The needs of urban landscaping can be combined with those of suburban livestock farmers. ([[Kstovo]], Russia).]]

Urban agriculture can have a large impact on the social and emotional well-being of individuals. &lt;ref name="Wakefield, S. 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/heapro/dam001 |pmid=17324956 |title=Growing urban health: Community gardening in South-East Toronto |journal=Health Promotion International |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=92–101 |year=2007 |last1=Wakefield |first1=S. |last2=Yeudall |first2=F. |last3=Taron |first3=C. |last4=Reynolds |first4=J. |last5=Skinner |first5=A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; UA can have an overall positive impact on [[community health]], which directly impacts individuals social and emotional well-being.   &lt;ref name="Wakefield, S. 2007"/&gt; Urban gardens are often places that facilitate positive [[social interaction]], which also contributes to overall social and emotional well-being. Many gardens facilitate the improvement of social networks within the communities that they are located. For many neighborhoods, gardens provide a “symbolic focus,” which leads to increased neighborhood pride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1353-8292(00)00013-7 |pmid=11027957 |title=A survey of community gardens in upstate New York: Implications for health promotion and community development |journal=Health &amp; Place |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=319–27 |year=2000 |last1=Armstrong |first1=Donna }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Related to the previous point, urban agriculture increases community participation through sensibilization and diagnostic workshops or different commissions in the area of vegetable gardens. Activities which involve hundreds of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sior.ub.edu/jspui/cris/socialimpact/socialimpact00444|title=Increased community participation. [Social Impact]. Cities Without Hunger - Community Gardens: Sao Paulo (2003-2009).|last=|first=|date=|website=SIOR, Social Impact Open Repository|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When individuals come together around UA, physical activity levels are often increased.  Many state that working in agriculture is much more interesting and fulfilling than going to the gym, and that it makes getting [[physical exercise|exercise]] “fun.”  In addition to the exercise that individuals receive while actually working in gardens, many people say that the majority of the exercise they receive through urban agriculture is actually getting to the gardens—many people either walk or ride their bike to the sites, which provides many physical benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/02614360902769894 |title=Cultivating health and wellbeing: Members' perceptions of the health benefits of a Port Melbourne community garden |journal=Leisure Studies |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=207–19 |year=2009 |last1=Kingsley |first1=Jonathan 'Yotti' |last2=Townsend |first2=Mardie |last3=Henderson‐Wilson |first3=Claire }}&lt;/ref&gt;

UPA can be seen as a means of improving the [[livelihood]] of people living in and around cities. Taking part in such practices is seen mostly as informal activity, but in many cities where inadequate, unreliable, and irregular access to food is a recurring problem, urban agriculture has been a positive response to tackling food concerns. Due to the food security that comes with UA, feelings of independence and empowerment often arise. The ability to produce and grow food for oneself has also been reported to improve levels of self-esteem or of self-efficacy.&lt;ref name="Wakefield, S. 2007"/&gt; Households and small communities take advantage of vacant land and contribute not only to their household food needs but also the needs of their resident city.&lt;ref name=Hales&gt;[http://www.mygreenhobby.com/urban-agriculture-why-it-has-a-positive-impact/ Hales et al. (2016). "Urban Agriculture: Urban agriculture, positive impact"] ''My Green Hobby''&lt;/ref&gt; The CFSC states that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Community and residential gardening, as well as small-scale farming, save household food dollars. They promote nutrition and free cash for non-garden foods and other items. As an example, you can raise your own chickens on an urban farm and have fresh eggs for only $0.44 per dozen.&lt;ref&gt;What's the Real Cost of Raising Backyard Chickens? (2015, March 29). Retrieved April 2, 2015, from http://www.urbanfarminghq.com/cost-of-raising-backyard-chickens/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402184950/http://www.urbanfarminghq.com/cost-of-raising-backyard-chickens/ |date=2 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This allows families to generate larger incomes selling to local [[grocer]]s or to local outdoor markets while supplying their household with the proper nutrition of fresh and nutritional products.

[[File:Ezhou-train-station-0109.jpg|thumb|rt|250px|A vegetable garden in the square in front of the train station in [[Ezhou]], China]]

Some community urban farms can be quite efficient and help women find work, who in some cases are marginalized from finding employment in the formal economy.&lt;ref&gt;FAO. (1999). "Issues in Urban Agriculture," ''FAO Spotlight Magazine,'' January.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that participation from women have a higher production rate, therefore producing the adequate amount for household consumption while supplying more for market sale.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idrc.ca/fr/ev-2490-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html#gender%20and%20land Mahbuba Kaneez Hasna.

As most UA activities are conducted on vacant municipal land, there have been raising concerns about the allocation of land and property rights. The [[International Development Research Centre|IDRC]] and the [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]] have published the Guidelines for Municipal Policymaking on Urban Agriculture, and are working with municipal governments to create successful policy measures that can be incorporated in urban planning.&lt;ref&gt;IDRC/ UN-HABITAT".Guidelines for Municipal Policymaking on Urban Agriculture" Urban Agriculture: Land Management and Physical Planning (2003) [http://www.ruaf.org/sites/default/files/Guideline%203%20Urban%20agriculture%20-%20Land%20Management%20and%20Physical%20Planning.pdf PDF] 1.3&lt;/ref&gt;

Over a third of U.S. households, roughly 42 million, participate in food gardening.  There has also been an increase of 63% participation in farming by millennials from 2008-2013. US households participating in community gardening has also tripled from 1 to 3 million in that time frame. Urban agriculture provides unique opportunities to bridge diverse communities together. In addition, it provides opportunities for health care providers to interact with their patients. Thus, making each community garden a hub that is reflective of the community. &lt;ref&gt;Alaimo, K., Beavers, A.W., Crawford, C. et al.

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy efficiency===
[[File:Mushroom growing kit, BTTR Ventures.jpg|thumb|upright|Edible Oyster Mushrooms growing on used coffee grounds]]
The current [[industrial agriculture]] system is accountable for high [[energy economics|energy costs]] for the [[transportation]] of foodstuffs. According to a study by Rich Pirog, the associate director of the Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture at Iowa State University, the average conventional produce item travels {{convert|1500|mi}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leopold.iastate.edu/pubs/staff/files/food_travel072103.pdf |title=Pirog, R. and A.

Pirog found that traditional, non-local, food distribution system used 4 to 17 times more fuel and emitted 5 to 17 times more {{CO2}} than the local and [[Regional Transportation Plan|regional transport]].&lt;ref&gt;Pirog, Rich S.; Van Pelt, Timothy; Enshayan, Kamyar; and Cook, Ellen, "Food, Fuel, and Freeways: An Iowa perspective on how far food travels, fuel usage, and greenhouse gas emissions" (2001). Leopold Center Pubs and Papers. 3. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://lib.dr.iastate.edu/leopold_pubspapers/3&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, in a study by Marc Xuereb and Region of Waterloo Public Health, they estimated that switching to locally grown food could save transport-related emissions equivalent to nearly 50,000 metric tons of {{CO2}}, or the equivalent of taking 16,191 cars off the road.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"&gt;Xuereb, Marc.

{{see also|Energy efficiency in agriculture|Efficient energy use}}

===Carbon footprint===
As mentioned above, the energy-efficient nature of urban agriculture can reduce each city's [[carbon footprint]] by reducing the amount of transport that occurs to deliver goods to the consumer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.delta-institute.org/content/urban-agriculture Delta Institute, "Urban Agriculture."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928072314/http://www.delta-institute.org/content/urban-agriculture |date=28 September 2013 }} Web. 25 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, these areas can act as [[carbon sink]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rowe|first=D. Bradley|title=Green roofs as a means of pollution abatement|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0269749110004859|journal=Environmental Pollution|volume=159|issue=8–9|pages=2100–2110|doi=10.1016/j.envpol.2010.10.029|pmid=21074914|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; offsetting some of the carbon accumulation that is innate to urban areas, where pavement and buildings outnumber plants. Plants absorb atmospheric carbon dioxide ({{CO2}}) and release breathable oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) through [[photosynthesis]]. The process of [[Carbon Sequestration]] can be further improved by combining other agriculture techniques to increase removal from the atmosphere and prevent the release of {{CO2}} during harvest time. However, this process relies heavily on the types of plants selected and the methodology of farming.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt; Specifically, choosing plants that do not lose their leaves and [[evergreen|remain green all year]] can increase the farm's ability to sequester carbon.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt;

===Reduction in ozone and particulate matter===
The reduction in [[ozone]] and other [[particulate matter]] can benefit human health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/s1352-2310(99)00144-2 |title=Air pollution in cities |journal=Atmospheric Environment |volume=33 |issue=24–25 |pages=4029–37 |year=1999 |last1=Mayer |first1=Helmut |bibcode=1999AtmEn..33.4029M }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reducing these particulates and ozone gases could reduce [[mortality rate]]s in urban areas along with increase the health of those living in cities. Just to give one example, in the article “[[Green roof]]s as a means of pollution abatement,” the author argues that a rooftop containing 2000 m² of uncut [[grass]] has the potential to remove up to 4000&amp;nbsp;kg of particulate matter. According to the article, only one square meter of green roof is needed to offset the annual particulate matter emissions of a car.&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Affairs Department, City of Los Angeles. 2006. "Green Roofs - Cooling Los Angeles: A Resource Guide". http://environmentla.org/pdf/EnvironmentalBusinessProgs/Green%20Roofs%20Resource%20Guide%202007.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.envpol.2010.10.029 |pmid=21074914 |title=Green roofs as a means of pollution abatement |journal=Environmental Pollution |volume=159 |issue=8–9 |pages=2100–10 |year=2011 |last1=Rowe |first1=D. Bradley }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soil decontamination===
Vacant urban lots are often victim to illegal dumping of hazardous chemicals and other wastes. They are also liable to accumulate standing water and “[[grey water]]”, which can be dangerous to public health, especially left stagnant for long periods. The implementation of urban agriculture in these vacant lots can be a cost-effective method for removing these chemicals. In the process known as [[Phytoremediation]], plants and the associated microorganisms are selected for their chemical ability to degrade, absorb, convert to an inert form, and remove toxins from the soil.&lt;ref&gt;Black, H. "Absorbing Possibilities: Phytoremediation." Environ Health Perspectives 103.12 (1995): 1106-108.&lt;/ref&gt;  Several chemicals can be targeted for removal including heavy metals (e.g. Mercury and lead) inorganic compounds (e.g. Arsenic and Uranium), and organic compounds (e.g. petroleum and chlorinated compounds like PBC's).&lt;ref&gt;Comis, Don. (2000). "Phytoremediation: Using Plants To Clean Up Soils." Agricultural Research: n. pag. Phytoremediation: Using Plants To Clean Up Soils. USDA-ARS, 13 August 2004. Web. 25 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Phytoremeditation is both an environmentally friendly, cost-effective, and energy-efficient measure to reduce pollution. Phytoremediation only costs about $5–$40 per ton of [[soil decontamination|soil being decontaminated]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lasat | first1 = M.

(2004). "Junk-greedy Greens: phytoremediation as a new option for soil decontamination,"] BioTech J. '''2''': 61-67&lt;/ref&gt; Implementation of this process also reduces the amount of soil that must be disposed of in a hazardous waste landfill.&lt;ref name="phytoremediation1995"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=8747015 |pmc=1519251 |year=1995 |author1=Black |first1=H |title=Absorbing possibilities: Phytoremediation |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives |volume=103 |issue=12 |pages=1106–8 |doi=10.2307/3432605|jstor=3432605 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Urban agriculture as a method to mediate chemical pollution can be effective in preventing the spread of these chemicals into the surrounding environment. Other methods of remediation often disturb the soil and force the chemicals contained within it into the air or water. Plants can be used as a method to remove chemicals and also to hold the soil and prevent erosion of contaminated soil decreasing the spread of pollutants and the hazard presented by these lots.&lt;ref name="phytoremediation1995"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/nps/urban.cfm |title=Managing Urban Runoff &amp;#124; Polluted Runoff &amp;#124; US EPA |publisher=Water.epa.gov |accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One way of identifying soil contamination is through using already well-established plants as bioindicators of soil health. Using well-studied plants is important because there has already been substantial bodies of work to test them in various conditions, so responses can be verified with certainty. Such plants are also valuable because they are genetically identical as crops as opposed to natural variants of the same species. Typically urban soil has had the topsoil stripped away and has led to soil with low aeration, porosity, and drainage. Typical measures of soil health are microbial biomass and activity, enzymes, [[soil organic matter]] (SOM), total nitrogen, available nutrients, porosity, aggregate stability, and compaction. A new measurement is active carbon (AC), which is the most usable portoin of the total organic carbon (TOC) in the soil. This contributes greatly to the functionality of the soil food web. Using common crops, which are generally well-studied, as bioindicators an be used to effectively test the quality of an urban farming plot before beginning planting. &lt;ref&gt;Alaimo K, Beavers AW, Crawford C, et al. (2016) Amplifying Health Through Community Gardens: A Framework for Advancing Multicomponent, Behaviorally Based Neighborhood Interventions. Current Environmental Health Reports 3:302–312. doi: 10.1007/s40572-016-0105-0&lt;/ref&gt;

===Noise pollution===
Large amounts of [[noise pollution]] not only lead to lower property values and high frustration, they can be damaging to human hearing and health.&lt;ref name=pass&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Passchier-Vermeer | first1 = W. | last2 = Passchier | first2 = W.F. | year = 2000 | title = Noise exposure and public health | doi = 10.1289/ehp.00108s1123 | pmid = 10698728 | pmc = 1637786 | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | volume = 108 | issue = 1| pages = 123–131 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the study “Noise exposure and public health,” they argue that exposure to continual noise is a public health problem. They cite examples of the detriment of continual noise on humans to include: “hearing impairment, hypertension and ischemic heart disease, annoyance, sleep disturbance, and decreased school performance.” Since most roofs or vacant lots consist of hard flat surfaces that reflect sound waves instead of absorbing them, adding plants that can absorb these waves has the potential to lead to a vast [[Noise control|reduction in noise pollution]].&lt;ref name=pass /&gt;

===Nutrition and quality of food===
Daily intake of a variety of fruits and vegetables is linked to a decreased risk of chronic diseases including diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Urban agriculture is associated with increased consumption of fruits and vegetables &lt;ref name="autogenerated94"&gt;Alaimo, K., Packnett, E., Miles, R., Kruger, D. (2008). "Fruit and Vegetable Intake among Urban Community Gardeners". Journal of Nutrition Education and Behavior. (1499-4046),40 (2), p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; which decreases risk for disease and can be a cost-effective way to provide citizens with quality, fresh produce in urban settings.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foodsecurity.org |author=Bellows, Anne C., Katherine Brown, Jac Smit |title= "Health Benefits of Urban Agriculture" (paper and research conducted by members of the Community Food Security Coalition's North American Initiative on Urban Agriculture) |publisher=Foodsecurity.org |accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name="autogenerated94"/&gt; Produce from urban gardens can be perceived to be more flavorful and desirable than store bought produce&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.03.044 |pmid=21596466 |pmc=3114166 |title=Connecting food environments and health through the relational nature of aesthetics: Gaining insight through the community gardening experience |journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine |volume=72 |issue=11 |pages=1853–63 |year=2011 |last1=Hale |first1=James |last2=Knapp |first2=Corrine |last3=Bardwell |first3=Lisa |last4=Buchenau |first4=Michael |last5=Marshall |first5=Julie |last6=Sancar |first6=Fahriye |last7=Litt |first7=Jill S. }}&lt;/ref&gt; which may also lead to a wider acceptance and higher intake. A Flint, Michigan study found that those participating in community gardens consumed fruits and vegetables 1.4 more times per day and were 3.5 times more likely to consume fruits or vegetables at least 5 times daily (p.&amp;nbsp;1).&lt;ref name="autogenerated94"/&gt;  Garden-based education can also yield nutritional benefits in children. An Idaho study reported a positive association between school gardens and increased intake of fruit, vegetables, vitamin A, vitamin C and fiber among sixth graders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jada.2007.01.015 |pmid=17383272 |title=Garden-Based Nutrition Education Affects Fruit and Vegetable Consumption in Sixth-Grade Adolescents |journal=Journal of the American Dietetic Association |volume=107 |issue=4 |pages=662–5 |year=2007 |last1=McAleese |first1=Jessica D. |last2=Rankin |first2=Linda L. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Harvesting fruits and vegetables initiates the enzymatic process of nutrient degradation which is especially detrimental to water [[vitamins|soluble vitamin]]s such as [[ascorbic acid]] and [[thiamin]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/jsfa.2825 |title=Nutritional comparison of fresh, frozen and canned fruits and vegetables. Part 1. Vitamins C and B and phenolic compounds |journal=Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture |volume=87 |issue=6 |pages=930–44 |year=2007 |last1=Rickman |first1=Joy C |last2=Barrett |first2=Diane M |last3=Bruhn |first3=Christine M }}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of blanching produce in order to freeze or can reduce nutrient content slightly but not nearly as much as the amount of time spent in storage.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt; Harvesting produce from one's own community garden cuts back on storage times significantly.

Urban agriculture also provides quality nutrition for low-income households. Studies show that every $1 invested in a community garden yields $6 worth of vegetables if labor is not considered a factor in investment.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"/&gt; Many urban gardens reduce the strain on food banks and other emergency food providers by donating shares of their harvest and provide fresh produce in areas that otherwise might be food deserts. The supplemental nutrition program Women, Infants and Children (WIC) as well as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) have partnered with several urban gardens nationwide to improve the accessibility to produce in exchange for a few hours of volunteer gardening work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/s0002-8223(08)70150-0 |title=Urban Gardening Yields Benefits for Low Income Families |journal=Journal of the American Dietetic Association |volume=103 |pages=94–5 |year=2003 |last1=Swartz |first1=S.H. |last2=Ranum |first2=O.J. |last3=Phillips |first3=O.K. |last4=Cavanaugh |first4=J.J. |last5=Bennett |first5=A.E. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Urban farming has been shown to increase health outcomes. Gardeners consume twice as much fruit and vegetables than non-gardeners. Levels of physical activity are also positively associated with urban farming. These results are seen indirectly and can be supported by the social involvement in an individual's community as a member of the community farm. This social involvement helped raised the aesthetic appeal of the neighborhood, boosting the motivation or efficacy of the community as a whole. This increased efficacy was shown to increase neighborhood attachment. Therefore, the positive health outcomes of urban farming can be explained in part due to the interpersonal sand social factors that boost health. Focusing on improving the aesthetics and community relationships and not only on the plant yield, is the best way to maximize the positive effect of urban farms on a neighborhood. &lt;ref&gt;Litt, J.s., et al. “Exploring Ecological, Emotional and Social Levers of Self-Rated Health for Urban Gardeners and Non-Gardeners: A Path Analysis.” Social Science &amp; Medicine, vol. 144, 2015, pp. 1–8., doi:10.1016/j.socscimed.2015.09.004.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economy of scale===
Using high-density urban farming, as for instance with [[vertical farms]] or stacked greenhouses, many environmental benefits can be achieved on a citywide scale that would be impossible otherwise. These systems do not only provide food, but also produce potable water from waste water, and can [[recycle]] organic waste back to energy and nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tom Bosschaert |url=http://www.except.nl/consult/largescaleurbanargriculture/largescaleurbanagriculture1.html |title=Bosschaert, T ''"Large Scale Urban agriculture Essay"'', Except Consultancy, 2007 |publisher=Except.nl |date=15 December 2007 |accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, they can reduce food-related transportation to a minimum while providing fresh food for large communities in almost any climate.

===Health inequalities and food justice===
A 2009 report by the USDA, determined that "Evidence is both abundant and robust enough for us to conclude that Americans living in low-income and minority areas tend to have poor access to healthy food", and that the "structural inequalities" in these neighborhoods "contribute to inequalities in diet and diet-related outcomes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=USDA|author2=Economic Research Service|title=Access to Affordable and Nutritious Food: Measuring and Understanding Food Deserts and Their Consequences: A Report to Congress.|journal=Administrative Publication No. (AP-036)|date=June 2009|page=160|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/ap-administrative-publication/ap-036.aspx#.UVH-XehVfog|accessdate=28 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406185309/http://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/ap-administrative-publication/ap-036.aspx#.UVH-XehVfog|archive-date=6 April 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These diet-related outcomes, including obesity and diabetes, have become epidemic in low-income urban environments in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Designed for Disease: The Link Between Local Food Environments and Obesity and Diabetes. [[California Center for Public Health Advocacy]], PolicyLink, and the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research. April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the definition and methods for determining "[[food deserts]]" have varied, studies indicate that, at least in the United States,  there are racial disparities in the food environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0739456X08317461 |title=Beyond Food Deserts: Measuring and Mapping Racial Disparities in Neighborhood Food Environments |journal=Journal of Planning Education and Research |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=469–82 |year=2008 |last1=Raja |first1=S. |last2=Changxing Ma |last3=Yadav |first3=P. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus using the definition of environment as the place where people live, work, play and pray, food disparities become an issue of environmental justice.&lt;ref name="Cultivating Food Justice - Growing Food and Justice"&gt;{{cite book |title=Cultivating Food Justice: Race, Class, and Sustainability|year=2011|publisher=MIT Press |isbn=9780262300223|pages=149–177 |author=Morales, Alfonso |editor1=Alison Hope Alkon |editor2=Julian Agyeman |chapter=Growing Food and Justice: Dismantling Racism through Sustainable Food Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially true in American inner-cities where a history of racist practices have contributed to the development of food deserts in the low-income, minority areas of the urban core.&lt;ref name="cultivating food justice - from industrial garden"&gt;{{cite book|title=Cultivating Food Justice: Race, Class, and Sustainability|year=2011|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262300223|pages=89–121|author=Nathan McClintock|editor1=Alison Hope Alkon |editor2=Julian Agyeman |chapter=From Industrial Garden to Food Desert: Demarcated Devaluation in the Flatlands of Oakland, California}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of inequality is so integral to the issues of food access and health that the Growing Food &amp; Justice for All Initiative was founded with the mission of “dismantling racism” as an integral part of creating food security.&lt;ref name="growing food and justice for all"&gt;{{cite web|title=Growing Food and Justice for All|url=http://www.growingfoodandjustice.org/About_Us.html|accessdate=28 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315104816/http://www.growingfoodandjustice.org/About_Us.html|archive-date=15 March 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only can urban agriculture provide healthy, fresh food options, but also can contribute to a sense of community, aesthetic improvement, crime reduction, minority empowerment and autonomy, and even preserve culture through the use of farming methods and heirloom seeds preserved from areas of origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cultivating Food Justice: Race, Class, and Sustainability |year=2011 |publisher=MIT Press|pages=197–221|author=Teresa M. Mares, Devon G. Pena |editor=Alison Hope Alkon, Julian Agyeman |chapter=Environmental and Food Justice: Toward Local, Slow, and Deep Food Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental justice===
Urban agriculture may advance [[environmental justice]] and food justice for communities living in food deserts.&lt;ref name="Boeing2016" /&gt;  First, urban agriculture may reduce racial and class disparities in access to healthy food. When urban agriculture leads to locally grown fresh produce sold at affordable prices in food deserts, access to healthy food is not just available for those who live in wealthy areas, thereby leading to greater equity in rich and poor neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="MCC"/&gt;
 
Improved access to food through urban agriculture can also help alleviate psychosocial stresses in poor communities. Community members engaged in urban agriculture improve local knowledge about healthy ways to fulfill dietary needs. Urban agriculture can also better the mental health of community members. Buying and selling quality products to local producers and consumers allows community members to support one another, which may reduce stress. Thus, urban agriculture can help improve conditions in poor communities, where residents experience higher levels of stress due to a perceived lack of control over the quality of their lives.&lt;ref name="4Sapolsky"&gt;[[Robert Sapolsky|Sapolsky, Robert]], "Sick of Poverty," Scientific American, Dec. 2005, pp: 93-99.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Urban agriculture may improve the livability and built environment in communities that lack supermarkets and other infrastructure due to the presence of high unemployment caused by [[deindustrialization]]. Urban farmers who follow sustainable agriculture methods can not only help to build local food system infrastructure, but can also contribute to improving local air, and water and soil quality.&lt;ref name="2GOTTLIEB"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1089/env.2009.0001 |title=Where We Live, Work, Play . . . And Eat: Expanding the Environmental Justice Agenda |journal=Environmental Justice |volume=2 |pages=7–8 |year=2009 |last1=Gottlieb |first1=Robert }}&lt;/ref&gt; When agricultural products are produced locally within the community, they do not need to be transported, which reduces [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|{{CO2}} emission]] rates and other pollutants that contribute to high rates of [[asthma]] in lower socioeconomic areas. Sustainable urban agriculture can also promote worker protection and consumer rights.&lt;ref name="2GOTTLIEB"/&gt; For example, communities in [[New York City]], [[Illinois]], and [[Richmond, Virginia]] have demonstrated improvements to their local environments through urban agricultural practices.&lt;ref name="3ACC"&gt;Alternatives for Community &amp; Environment. Environmental Justice and the Green Economy. A Vision Statement and Case Studies for Just and Sustainable Solutions. Rep. Roxbury, MA: Alternatives for Community &amp; Environment, 2010. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
However, urban agriculture can also present urban growers with health risks if the soil used for urban farming is contaminated. Although local produce is often believed to be clean and healthy, many urban farmers ranging from New York urban farmer Frank Meushke &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/14/garden/14lead.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 Murphy, Kate.

Web. 9 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; have found their products contained high levels of [[Lead poisoning|lead]], due to [[soil contamination]], which is harmful to human health when consumed. The soil contaminated with high lead levels often originates from old house paint which contained lead, [[vehicle exhaust]], or atmospheric deposition. Without proper education on the risks of urban farming and safe practices, urban consumers of urban agricultural produce may face additional health-related issues&lt;ref name="MCC"&gt;McClintock, Nathan.

==Implementation==
[[File:Urban agriculture in Amsterdam.jpg|thumb|left|A small urban farm in [[Amsterdam]]]]
[[File:Foodrooffarm.jpg|thumb|Rooftop urban farming at the Food Roof Farm in downtown St. Louis, MO]]
Creating a community-based infrastructure for urban agriculture means establishing local systems to grow and process food and transfer it from farmer ([[Production, costs, and pricing|producer]]) to [[consumer]].&lt;ref name="Boeing2016" /&gt;

To facilitate food production, cities have established community-based farming projects. Some projects have collectively tended community farms on [[common land]], much like that of eighteenth-century [[Boston Common (park)|Boston Common]]. One such community farm is the [[Collingwood Children's Farm]] in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]. Other community garden projects use the [[allotment garden]] model, in which gardeners care for individual plots in a larger gardening area, often sharing a tool shed and other amenities. Seattle's [[P-Patch]] gardens use this model, as did the [[South Central Farm]] in Los Angeles and the Food Roof Farm in St. Louis. Independent urban gardeners also grow food in individual yards and on roofs. [[Garden sharing]] projects seek to pair producers with the land, typically, residential yard space. [[Roof gardens]] allow for urban dwellers to maintain green spaces in the city without having to set aside a tract of undeveloped land. Rooftop farms allow otherwise unused industrial roofspace to be used productively, creating work and profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/new-york-could-grown-all-its-own-food-180949748/? | title=New York Could Grow All Its Own Food.

[[File:Tomato plants growing July 2013 in garbage cans.JPG|thumb|Tomato plants growing in a pot farming alongside a small house in [[New Jersey]] in fifteen [[garbage can]]s filled with [[soil]], grew over 700 tomatoes during the summer of 2013.]] 
[[Food processing]] on a community level has been accommodated by centralizing resources in community tool sheds and processing facilities for farmers to share. The Garden Resource Program Collaborative based in Detroit has cluster tool banks. Different areas of the city have tool banks where resources like tools, [[compost]], mulch, tomato stakes, seeds, and education can be shared and distributed with the gardeners in that cluster. Detroit's Garden Resource Program Collaborative also strengthens their gardening community by providing to their member's transplants; education on gardening, policy, and food issues; and by building connectivity between gardeners through workgroups, potlucks, tours, field trips, and cluster workdays. In Brazil, "Cities Without Hunger" has generated a public policy for the reconstruction of abandoned areas with food production and has improved the green areas of the community.

[[Farmers' market]]s, such as the [[Farmers Market (Los Angeles)|farmers' market in Los Angeles]], provide a common land where farmers can sell their product to consumers. Large cities tend to open their farmer's markets on the weekends and one day in the middle of the week. For example, the farmers' market of [[Boulevard Richard-Lenoir]] in [[Paris, France]], is open on Sundays and Thursdays. However, to create a consumer dependency on urban agriculture and to introduce local food production as a sustainable career for farmers, markets would have to be open regularly. For example, the Los Angeles Farmers' Market is open seven days a week and has linked several local grocers together to provide different food products. The market's central location in downtown Los Angeles provides the perfect interaction for a diverse group of sellers to access their consumers.

===Queensland, Australia===
In Queensland many people have started a trend of urban farming both utilizing [[Aquaponics]] and self-watering containers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.futuredirections.org.au/publication/localising-food-production-urban-agriculture-in-australia/ | title=Localising Food Production: Urban Agriculture in Australia| date=2015-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cairo, Egypt===
In Egypt, development of rooftop gardens began in the 1990s. In the early 1990s at [[Ain Shams University]], a group of agriculture professors developed an initiative focused on growing organic vegetables to suit densely populated cities of Egypt. The initiative was applied on a small scale; until it was officially adopted in 2001, by the Food and Agriculture Organization ([[FAO]]).&lt;ref&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.

{{main article|Organopónicos}}

After the disintegration of the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Eastern Bloc]], [[Cuba]] faced severe shortages of fuel and [[agrochemical|agrochemical inputs]]. These products had previously been imported from the Soviet Union in exchange for Cuban sugar. As a result, Cubans experienced an acute food crisis in the early 1990s, which in part was met with a popular movement of urban agriculture. Urban farmers employed – and still employ –
[[agroecology|agroecological]] techniques, allowing food production to take place largely without petroleum-based inputs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10460-015-9659-y |title=Low-carbon food supply: The ecological geography of Cuban urban agriculture and agroecological theory |journal=Agriculture and Human Values |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=771–784 |year=2016 |last1=Cederlöf |first1=Gustav |url=https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/lowcarbon-food-supply(91a7f323-379c-4eeb-b2c8-c6bfe94ea449).html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, {{convert|35000|acre}} of urban gardens produced {{convert|3400000|short ton}} of food. In Havana, 90% of the city's fresh produce come from local urban farms and gardens. In 2003, more than 200,000 Cubans worked in the expanding urban agriculture sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=cubaagriculture.com |url=http://www.cubaagriculture.com/agriculture-today.htm |title=Cuban Ministry of Agriculture |publisher=Cubaagriculture.com |accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mumbai, India===
Economic development in [[Mumbai]] brought a growth in population caused mainly by the migration of laborers from other regions of the country. The number of residents in the city increased more than twelve times in the last century. [[Greater Mumbai]], formed by [[South Mumbai|City Island]] and [[Salsette Island]], is the largest city in India with a population of 16.4 million, according to data collected by the census of 2001. Mumbai is one of the densest cities in the world, 48,215 persons per km² and 16,082 per km² in suburban areas. In this scenario, urban agriculture seems unlikely to be put into practice since it must compete with real estate developers for the access and use of vacant lots. Alternative farming methods have emerged as a response to the scarcity of land, water, and economic resources employed in UPA.

Dr. Doshi's city garden methods are revolutionary for being appropriate to apply in reduced spaces as terraces and balconies, even on civil construction walls, and for not requiring big investments in capital or long hours of work. His farming practice is purely organic and is mainly directed to domestic consumption. His gardening tools are composed of materials available in the local environment: sugarcane waste, polyethylene bags, tires, containers and cylinders, and soil. The containers and bags (open at both ends) are filled with the sugarcane stalks, compost, and garden soil, which make possible the use of a minimal quantity of water is compared to open fields. Dr. Doshi states that solar energy can replace soil in cities. He also recommends the idea of chain planning, or growing plants in intervals and in small quantities rather than at once and in large amounts. He has grown different types of fruit such as mangos, figs, guavas, bananas, and sugarcane stalks in his terrace of {{convert|1200|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} in Bandra. The concept of [[city farm]]ing developed by Dr. Doshi consumes the entire household's organic waste. He subsequently makes the household self-sufficient in the provision of food: {{convert|5|kg}} of fruits and vegetables are produced daily for 300 days a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/southasia/ruaf/CD/ho1.html |title=RUAF Foundation.

The main objectives of a pilot project at city farm at Rosary High School, Dockyard Road, were to promote economic support for street children, beautify the city landscape, supply locally produced organic food to urban dwellers (mainly those residing in slums), and to manage organic waste in a sustainable city. The project was conducted in the Rosary School, in Mumbai, with the participation of street children during 2004. A city farm was created in a terrace area of {{convert|400|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}. The participants were trained in urban farming techniques. The farm produced vegetables, fruits, and flowers. The idea has spread the concept of city farm to other schools in the city.

The Mumbai Port Trust (MBPT) central kitchen distributes food to approximately 3,000 employees daily, generating important amounts of organic disposal. A terrace garden created by the staff recycles ninety percent of this waste in the production of vegetables and fruits. Preeti Patil, who is the catering officer at the MBPT explains the purpose of the enterprise:&lt;ref&gt;Roshni Udyavar et al., "Development of City Farms by Street Children"&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Mumbai Port Trust has developed an organic farm on the terrace of its central kitchen, which is an area of approximately {{convert|3000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}. The activity of city farming was started initially to dispose of kitchen organic waste in an eco-friendly way. Staff members, after their daily work in the kitchen, tend the garden, which has about 150 plants.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Bangkok, Thailand===
In early 2000, urban gardens were started under the direction of the NGO, Thailand Environment Institute (TEI), to help achieve the Bangkok Metropolitan Administrations (BMA) priority to "green" Thailand. With a population of 12 million and 39% of the land in the city vacant due to rapid expansion of the 1960s–80s Bangkok is a test bed for urban gardens centered on community involvement.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The two urban gardens initiated by TEI are in Bangkok Noi and Bangkapi and the main tasks were stated as:
* Teach members of the communities the benefits of urban green space.
* Create the social framework to plan, implement, and maintain the urban green space.
* Create a process of a method to balance the needs of the community with the needs of the larger environmental concerns.

While the goals of the NGO are important in a global context, the community goals are being met through the work of forming the urban gardens themselves. In this sense, the creation, implementation, and maintenance of urban gardens are highly determined by the desires of the communities involved. However, the criteria by which TEI measured their success illustrates the scope of benefits to a community which practices urban agriculture. TEI's success indicators were:
* Establishing an Urban Green Plan
* Community Capacity Building
* Poverty Reduction
* Links with Government
* Developing a Model for Other Communities

===China===
Beijing's increase in land area from {{convert|4822|km2}} in 1956 to {{convert|16808|km2}} in 1958 led to the increased adoption of peri-urban agriculture. Such "suburban agriculture" led to more than 70% of non-staple food in Beijing, mainly consisting of vegetables and milk, to be produced by the city itself in the 1960s and 1970s. Recently, with relative food security in China, periurban agriculture has led to improvements in the quality of the food available, as opposed to quantity. One of the more recent experiments in urban agriculture is the Modern Agricultural Science Demonstration Park in Xiaotangshan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Jianming | first = Cai | title = Periurban Agriculture Development in China | journal = Urban Agriculture Magazine | volume = 9 | date = 1 April 2003 | url = http://www.ruaf.org/system/files?file=Periurban%20Agriculture%20Development%20in%20China.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 12 July 2007 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927195253/http://www.ruaf.org/system/files?file=Periurban%20Agriculture%20Development%20in%20China.pdf | archivedate = 27 September 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, Chinese cities have been known to mix agricultural activities within the urban setting. Shenzhen, once a small farming community, is now a fast-growing metropolis due to the Chinese government designation as an open economic zone. Due to large and growing population in China, the government supports urban self-sufficiency in food production. Shenzhen's village structure, sustainable methods, and new agricultural advancements initiated by the government have been strategically configured to supply food for this growing city.&lt;ref name="Pepall, Jennifer 1997"&gt;Pepall, Jennifer. New Challenges for Chinas Urban Farms IDRC Report (1997) 21.3&lt;/ref&gt;

The city farms are located about {{convert|10|km}} from the city center in a two-tier system. The first tier approached from city center produces perishable items. Located just outside these farms, hardier vegetables are grown such as potatoes, carrots, and onions. This system allows producers to be sold in city markets just a few short hours after picking.

Another impressive method used in Chinese agriculture and aquaculture practice is the mulberry-dike fish-pond system, which is a response to waste recycling and soil fertility. This system can be described as:&lt;ref name="Pepall, Jennifer 1997"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Mulberry trees are grown to feed silkworms and the silkworm waste is fed to the fish in ponds. The fish also feed on waste from other animals, such as pigs, poultry, and buffalo. The animals, in turn, are given crops that have been fertilized by mud from the ponds. This is a sophisticated system as a continuous cycle of water, waste, and food...with a man built into the picture.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As the population grows and industry advances, the city tries to incorporate potential agricultural growth by experimenting with new agricultural methods. The Fong Lau Chee Experimental Farm in Dongguan, Guangdong has worked with new agricultural advancements in lychee production. This farm was established with aspirations of producing large quantities and high-quality lychees, by constantly monitoring sugar content, and their seeds. This research, conducted by local agricultural universities allows for new methods to be used with hopes of reaching the needs of city consumers.&lt;ref&gt;Yeung, Yue-man. Urban Agriculture Research in East and Southeast Asia: Record, Capacities, and Opportunities Cities Feeding People CFP Report 6 (1993) The Chinese University of Hong Kong&lt;/ref&gt;

However, due to increased levels of economic growth and pollution, some urban farms have become threatened. The government has been trying to step in and create new technological advancements within the agricultural field to sustain levels of urban agriculture.

"The city plans to invest 8.82 billion yuan in 39 agricultural projects, including a safe agricultural base, an agricultural high-tech park, agricultural processing and distribution, forestry, eco-agricultural tourism, which will form an urban agriculture with typical Shenzhen characteristics" in conjunction with this program the city is expected to expand the Buji Farm Produce Wholesale Market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.sz.gov.cn/economy/200708/t20070824_229911.htm Shenzhen Government Online Economic Structure: Urban Agriculture 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416053328/http://english.sz.gov.cn/economy/200708/t20070824_229911.htm |date=16 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Municipal Bureau of Agriculture, Forestry and Fishery the city will invest 600 million yuan on farms located around the city, with hopes of the farms to provide "60 percent of the meat, vegetables, and aquatic products in the Shenzhen market".&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.sz.gov.cn/In/200610/t20061027_148990.htm Shenzhen Government Online SZ farms to feed city residents Local News]{{dead link|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has also been an emerging trend of going green and organic as a response to pollution and pesticides used in farming practices. Vegetable suppliers are required to pass certain inspections held by the city's Agriculture Bureau before they can be sold as "green".&lt;ref&gt;Shenzhen Government Online Shenzhen store embrace green 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Harare, Zimbabwe===
Harare is particularly suited for urban agriculture, as its topography heavily features ''vleis'', land drainage systems that become waterlogged in the rainy season. When it rains they are difficult to cross, and in the dry season they shrink and crack, which causes structural damage to infrastructure, even though the vleis are still storing water underground. Therefore, these moisture-rich areas are mostly left unbuilt, allowing for urban cultivation.

Aside from vleis and the private residential land that Harareans cultivate, considerable public land is used for agriculture in Harare: along public roads, railway lines, undeveloped plots, road verges, and the banks of ditches.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mudimu|first=Godfrey|date=1996|title=Urban Agricultural Activities and Women's Strategies in Sustaining Family Livelihoods in Harare, Zimbabwe|url=|journal=Singapore Journal of Tropical Geography|volume=17|pages=179–194|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Drakakis-Smith|first=David|date=1995|title=Urban Poverty and Urban Agriculture: An Overview of the Linkages in Harare|url=|journal=Habitat International|volume=19|pages=183–193|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The land is mostly used for maize, groundnuts, sweet potatoes, green vegetables, fruits, paprika, and flowers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mbiba|first=Beacon|title=City Harvests: Urban and Peri-Urban Agriculture in Harare, Zimbabwe|url=https://www.academia.edu/9507035|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;This unsanctioned cultivation has a history of necessity: in colonial times, laborers wanted towns where they could cultivate crops like at their rural homes, and with very low income, needed to supplement their food supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mbiba|first=Beacon|date=1994|title=Institutional Responses to Uncontrolled Urban Cultivation in Harare: Prohibitive or Accommodative?|url=|journal=Environment and Urbanization|volume=6|pages=188–202|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, urban agriculture in Harare causes harm to the environment. The practice has reduced rainwater infiltration into the soil by 28.5 percent and lowered tree species diversity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition, most informal urban farmers use harmful chemical fertilizers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shingirai|first=Chimbwanda|date=2014-07-25|title=Contribution of urban crop production to household food security: a study of urban agriculture in Warren Park suburb of Harare|url=http://ir.uz.ac.zw/handle/10646/1294?show=full|language=en-ZW}}&lt;/ref&gt; Urban agriculture has also been viewed negatively in Harare because it impedes on housing and urban development. In the eyes of Zimbabwean laws, agriculture was not an “urban” activity or a legitimate form of land use in cities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1983, the Greater Harare Illegal Cultivation Committee was formed, though its efforts to curb urban agriculture wholly failed.

In the 1990s, the failure of Structural Adjustment Programs induced greater unemployment, higher prices, and lower incomes, so more people started growing their own food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ruaf.org/sites/default/files/UAM21%20p.26-27.pdf|title=The Impact of the Economic Meltdown on Urban Agriculture in Harare|last=Toriro|first=Percy|date=January 2009|work=Urban Agriculture|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1990 and 1994, Harare's cultivation area increased by 92.6 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286348362|title=CONFLICTS, CONTESTATION, AND MARGINALIZATION IN URBAN AGRICULTURE: EXPERIENCES FROM KUWADZANA EXTENSION, HARARE (PDF Download Available)|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boom in urban agriculture improved both the food security and the nutrition of its practitioners, as well as additional income from selling excess produce. The practice continued in the 2000s when a major recession brought about widespread poverty, unemployment, and enormous inflation. Finally, the 2002 Nyanga Declaration on Urban Agriculture in Zimbabwe explicitly acknowledged the value of urban agriculture for food security and the reduction of poverty. Accepting that many people depend on it to survive, the government allocated sixty thousand hectares of land in Harare for cultivation purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chaminuka|first=Nyasha|last2=Makaye|first2=Peter|date=2015-04-23|title=The Resilience of Urban Agriculture in the Face of Adversity from the City Authorities: The Case of Mkoba|url=https://socialscienceresearch.org/index.php/GJHSS/article/view/1482|journal=Global Journal of Human-Social Science Research|language=en|issn=2249-460X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===

==== Nationwide Survey Findings ====
According to the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]], a farm is defined as a location that produces and sells at least $1,000 worth of products. A study conducted on urban farms in 2012 surveyed over 315 farms that identified as urban. Of those, over 32% were found in the Northeast, more than 26% in the South, 22% in the West, and less than 19% in the Midwest. The survey found that most urban farms in the United States are structured as either non-profit or solely owned. Urban farms typically use techniques that allow them to produce intensively on small land. Mainly, these practices include raised beds, greenhouse, and [[container garden]]s. Of the products made, an overwhelming majority of urban farms focus on fresh vegetable, followed by herbs and flowers. If an urban farm focuses on animals, the primary animal is hens. Bees and sheep are the second most common urban farm animals.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www. attractive.ncat.org|title=Urban Agriculture in the United States: Baseline Findings of a Nationwide Survey|last=Oberholtzer|first=Lydia|date=November 2016|website=National Center for Appropriate Technology|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021101093149/http://www/|archive-date=1 November 2002|dead-url=yes|access-date=|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost half of the urban farms that participated in the survey made a total gross sale adding to less than $10,000. The majority of these sales coming from farmers markets, [[Community-supported agriculture|Community Supported Agriculture]] (CSA), and restaurants. Not even 5% of the urban farms could be considered according to total gross sales statistics. Most urban farms agree on the main challenges that they face; production costs, managing pests, managing weeds, and climate. They also see profitability, financing, and farm labor as big challenges of managing an urban farm.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====New York====
[[File:Lower_East_Side_in_Adam_Purple%27s_Garden_1984..jpg|thumb|left|Garden of Adam Purple, lower east-side, New York City, 1984]] Many low-income residents suffer from high rates of obesity and diabetes and limited sources of fresh produce. The City and local nonprofit groups have been providing land, training and financial encouragement, but the impetus in urban farming has really come from the farmers, who often volunteer when their regular work day is done.  In addition, the New York City Department of Environmental Protection offers a grant program for private property owners in combined sewer areas of New York City. The minimum requirement is to manage 1” of stormwater runoff from the contributing impervious area. Eligible projects include green roofs, rooftop farms, and [[rainwater harvesting]] on private property in combined sewer areas. Because of this grant program, New York City now has the world's largest rooftop farms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treehugger.com/sustainable-agriculture/rooftop-farm-brooklyn.html|title=One of the world's largest rooftop farms is in Brooklyn|work=TreeHugger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some urban gardeners have used empty lots to start a community or urban gardens. However, the soil must be tested for heavy contamination in city soil because of vehicle exhaust and remnants of old construction. The City also has a composting program, which is available to gardeners and farmers. One group, GreenThumb, provides free seedlings. Another program, the City Farms project operated by the nonprofit Just Food, offers courses on growing and selling food.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/07/dining/07urban.html?ex=1210824000&amp;en=9d6a23b0418d45a4&amp;ei=5070&amp;emc=eta1 Urban Farmers' Crops Go From Vacant Lot to Market]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two alternate means of growing are [[rooftop garden]]s and [[hydroponic]] (soil-less) growing. ''The New York Times'' wrote an article about one of Manhattan's first gardens which incorporate both these techniques.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/28/dining/28roof.html From Roof To Table,]&lt;/ref&gt; Another option urban gardeners have used is Farm-in-A-Box LLC, a company that provides hand-made, ready-to-use garden boxes to residents and schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.farminaboxnyc.com/|title=Welcome|website=Farm-In-A-Box|access-date=2016-04-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160430091534/http://www.farminaboxnyc.com/|archive-date=30 April 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====California====
In response to the recession of 2008, a coalition of community-based organizations, farmers, and academic institutions in California's [[Pomona Valley]] formed the Pomona Valley Urban Agriculture Initiative.

After the passage of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]], cheap grain from the United States flooded Mexico, driving peasant farmers off of their land. Many immigrated to the Pomona Valley and found work in the construction industry. With the 2008 recession, the construction industry also suffered in the region. It is unlikely to regain its former strength because of severe water shortages in this desert region as well as ongoing weakness in the local economy. These immigrants were dry land organic farmers in their home country by default since they did not have access to pesticides and petroleum-based fertilizers. Now, they found themselves on the border of two counties: Los Angeles County with a population of 10 million and almost no farmland, and San Bernardino County which has the worst access to healthy food in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publichealthadvocacy.org|title=California Center for Public Health Advocacy|work=publichealthadvocacy.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both counties, there is a growing demand for locally grown organic produce. In response to these conditions, Uncommon Good, a community-based nonprofit organization that works with immigrant farmer families, convened a forum which became the Urban Farmers Association. The Urban Farmers Association is the first organization of its kind for poor immigrant farmers in the Pomona Valley. Its goal is to develop opportunities for its members to support themselves and their families through urban agriculture. With Uncommon Good, it is a founding member of the Pomona Valley Urban Agriculture Initiative (PVUAI). The PVUAI is working with local colleges and universities to expand upon a food assessment survey that was done in the City of Pomona.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2006.01.009 |pmid=16627123 |title=Disparities in Access to Fresh Produce in Low-Income Neighborhoods in Los Angeles |journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine |volume=30 |issue=5 |pages=365–70 |year=2006 |last1=Algert |first1=Susan J. |last2=Agrawal |first2=Aditya |last3=Lewis |first3=Douglas S. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Oakland====
{{Main article|Urban agriculture in West Oakland}}

[[Urban agriculture in West Oakland]] has taken a radical form that can be traced back to community gardening initiatives starting in the 1970s in the cities of [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] and [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], and the city's African-American heritage.&lt;ref name="nm"&gt;McClintock, Nathan. (2011). "Cultivation, Capital, and Contamination: Urban Agriculture in Oakland, California." 2011. PDF file.&lt;/ref&gt; Oakland's manufacturing industry attracted new residents during WWII. To reduce racial tension, the Oakland Housing Authority established housing projects for blacks in West Oakland and whites in East Oakland. With exclusionary [[Covenant (law)|covenants]] and [[redlining]] by banks, development capital was kept out of West Oakland while the African-American population had limited opportunities to rent or buy housing outside West Oakland.&lt;ref name="mc"&gt;McClintock, Nathan. (2008). [http://escholarship.org/uc/item/1wh3v1sj From Industrial Garden to Food Desert: Unearthing the Root Structure of Urban Agriculture in Oakland, California.] UC Berkeley: Institute for the Study of Societal Issues.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Black Panther Party]] (BPP) played a role in seeding urban agricultural practices in West Oakland.&lt;ref name="nm" /&gt; One of its social programs aimed to improve the access to healthy food for the city's black population by providing breakfast in local schools, churches, and community centers. A small amount of this food came from small local gardens planted by BPP members. According to Prof. Nathan McClintock, "The Panthers used gardening as a coping mechanism and a means of supplementing their diets, as a well as a means to strengthen community members engaged in the struggle against oppression."&lt;ref name="nm" /&gt; The People of Color Greening Network (PCGN) was created in the 1990s. The group planted in empty and vacant lots in West Oakland. In addition, schools around Alameda County began teaching basic gardening skills and food education.&lt;ref name="nm" /&gt; Other groups have carried on those legacies, such as People's Grocery&lt;ref name="js"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10460-012-9363-0 |title=Growing food justice by planting an anti-oppression foundation: Opportunities and obstacles for a budding social movement |journal=Agriculture and Human Values |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=455–66 |year=2012 |last1=Sbicca |first1=Joshua }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Planting Justice.&lt;ref name="sj"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/anti.12247 |title=These Bars Can't Hold Us Back: Plowing Incarcerated Geographies with Restorative Food Justice |journal=Antipode |volume=48 |issue=5 |pages=1359–79 |year=2016 |last1=Sbicca |first1=Joshua }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the city of Oakland's Mayor's Office of Sustainability proposed a Sustainable Community Development Initiative towards sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;Floyd, Ceda [http://www2.oaklandnet.com/oakca/groups/pwa/documents/report/oak025325.pdf "Resolution Authorizing The City Of Oakland To Adopt Part Three Of The 'City Of Oakland Sustainable Community Development Initiative.'”] Oakland City Council Resolution No. 74678. 1 December 1998. PDF file.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to West Oakland's lack of access to nutritious and healthy food, other organizations including the PCGN and City Slicker Farms demanded the plan include strategies for creating a sustainable impact on the local food system. City Slicker Farms was founded in 2001 in response to the lack of access to fresh produce in West Oakland. Through land donations from local residents, a network of urban farms was created through the Community Market Farms Program, and in 2005 the organization established the Backyard Garden Program to aid West Oakland residents in growing their own food at home. This program now grows upwards of 30,000&amp;nbsp; lbs. of food each year.&lt;ref name="csf"&gt;[http://www.cityslickerfarms.org/annual-reports/ "Annual Reports"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304023524/http://www.cityslickerfarms.org/annual-reports/ |date=4 March 2016 }} City Slicker Farms. 29 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sc"&gt;[http://www.cityslickerfarms.org/mission-and-history Mission and History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160207064950/http://www.cityslickerfarms.org/mission-and-history |date=7 February 2016 }}.

====Montreal====
[[File:Lufa Farms Aerial view of Montreal rooftop greenhouse3.jpg|thumb|[[Lufa Farms]] greenhouses are constructed on the rooftops of [[Greater Montreal]].]]
Canada has a number of companies working on urban farm technology, including [[Lufa Farms]]. In Montreal, there are 97 community gardens which allow citizens space in each plot to grow their plants. The program has been in place since 1975 and is managed by the boroughs. Of the eighteen boroughs, some have a gardening instructor who visits the gardens regularly to give gardeners tips. The soil, a water supply, a space for tools, sand, fencing, and paint are all provided by the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/portal/page?_pageid=5977,68887600&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL|title=Ville de Montreal - Official city portal - Community gardens|work=montreal.qc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Now you can find about 100 [[community gardens]] in Montreal and they have very extensive, well-established, city run community gardening programs. This gardening program is run by the Department of Sports, Recreation and Social Development which provides the garden with the necessities needed for it to run, such as water, maintenance and others. The largest community garden has about 255 allotment plots while the smallest community garden has about 25 plots. 2/3 of the community gardens can be found in parkland zones, which will help prevent development problems in the long run. Out of 2 million people living in the urbanized parts of Montreal, about 10000 of these residents share the garden plots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cosgrove |first1=Sean |title=Community Gardening in Major Canadian Cities: Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver Compared |url=http://www.cityfarmer.org/canadaCC.html |publisher=City Farmer, Canada's Office of Urban Agriculture |accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Davidson |first1=Thomas |last2=Krause |first2=Kathryn |title=A Social History of Urban Agriculture in Montreal |url=http://felix.geog.mcgill.ca/other/environ/1999b/food/irp4/history.html#4.0%20Montreal%20Historical%20setting |publisher=McGill |accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are currently the only grocery store that sells organic produce on their roof. With about 25000 square feet of green space and products certified by Ecocert Canada, they can sell over 30 different kinds of fresh, organic produce. Along with growing vegetables, they are also selling honey produced and harvested by eight Alvéole bee hives which have also made the green roof their home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=IGA INTRODUCES THE LARGEST ORGANIC SUPERMARKET GREEN ROOF GARDEN IN THE COUNTRY |url=https://www.iga.net/en/press_room/communiques_2017/iga_introduces_the_largest_organic_supermarket_green_roof_garden_in_the_country |website=IGA |publisher=IGA |accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====British Columbia====
A Canadian urban farmer in [[British Columbia]] has published details on a crop value rating (CVR) system that urban farmers can use to determine which [[crop]]s to grow, based on each crop's contribution to supporting the farm economically.&lt;ref name="Stone2016"&gt;{{Citation |last=Stone |first=Curtis A. |year=2016 |title=The Urban Farmer: Growing Food for Profit on Leased and Borrowed Land |publisher=New Society Publishers |url=http://theurbanfarmer.co/ |isbn=978-0865718012 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This entails forgoing some crops in favor of others, but he points out that urban farmers can develop [[business networking]] with rural farmers to bring some of those other crops to the urban point of sale. For example, the urban farmer may not be able to economically justify growing [[sweet corn]] (based on long [[growing degree-day|days to maturity]] and low [[crop yield|yield]] density per linear foot of row), but a networking arrangement is mutually beneficial, as it lets a rural sweet corn grower gain an additional point of sale at [[retail]] price while also letting the urban farmer fill the gap in his product line offering.&lt;ref name="Stone2016"/&gt;

Several community projects in [[Victoria, British Columbia]] were born to promote urban agricultural practices such as the Sharing Backyards program. This program exists to help people living in urban areas get connected with others who have extra space in their yards for the purpose of urban farming. Organizations also exist to educate people living in the urban parts of Vancouver on farming and growing food in an urban setting by running public demonstration gardens.

Covering the roof of the west building of the [[Vancouver Convention Centre]] is the largest green roof in Canada and one of the 10 largest green roofs in the world. With around six acres of living space, it is home to more than 400,000 indigenous plants and grasses that provide [[Thermal insulation|insulation]]. It is also home to four [[Western honey bee]] beehives which pollinate the plants on the roof and provide honey. The living includes other [[sustainable]] practices such as recycling and reusing water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ENVIRONMENT FUNCTIONAL, BEAUTIFUL AND ‘GREEN’ |url=https://www.vancouverconventioncentre.com/about-us/environment |website=Vancouver Convention Centre |publisher=Vancouver Convention Centre |accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of [[Kamloops]], in British Columbia, are actively promoting urban agricultural practices within their community. They stress on the importance of food security and its affect on the economy as well as the ecology. They created the Food and Urban Agriculture Plan (FUAP), initiated in 2014, which lays out goals and strategies to implement a [[sustainable]] food system. The Areas which they cover include: Food Production and Land Availability, Food Processing and Preparing, Food Distribution/Retail/Access, Cooking/Eating and Celebrating Food, Food Waste and Resource Management, as well as Education/Governance and Capacity Building. The FUAP greatly emphasizes on Urban Agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Food and Urban Agriculture Plan Harvesting Our Potential |url=https://www.kamloops.ca/sites/default/files/docs/city-hall/15-09-food_urban_agriculture_plan_2015_285947.pdf |website=Kamloops |publisher=City of Kamloops |accessdate=24 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ontario====
Ontario is the second biggest province and has one of the most urbanized cities in Canada, Toronto. The provincial government of Ontario has a website dedicated to providing information to those who are interested in establishing an urban farm or for those who just want to learn more about urban agriculture in Ontario.

UrbanHensTo is a 3-year pilot program that launched in the City of [[Toronto]] on March 2, 2018. This program allows eligible resident in 4 wards across the city to keep a maximum of 4 hens (no roosters) for the purpose of enjoyment or personal consumption of only the eggs. There are other requirements included with rearing these hens under this program such as [[zoning]] and guidelines for building the enclosure, waste and disposal. The wards eligible for this program from the UrbanHensTo site include:
* Ward 13 (Parkdale-High Park)
* Ward 21 (St. Paul's)
* Ward 5 (Etobicoke-Lakeshore)
* Ward 32 (Beaches-East York)
Workshops are also available to those interested in rearing urban hens. However, failure to abide by these rules and regulations can result in fines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Urban Hens TO Pilot |url=http://tfpc.to/urbanhensto-pilot |website=TFPC |publisher=Toronto Food Policy Council |accessdate=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toronto has a green roof policy and bylaw which has promoted the practice of installing green roofs. According to the Green Roof Industry Survey in 2016, the city was recognized as having the most green roofs installed on buildings in all of North America. This came to be after they developed a green roof strategy in 2009 where new development buildings are required to install a green roof. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Green Roofs |url=https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/planning-development/official-plan-guidelines/green-roofs/ |website=Toronto |publisher=City of Toronto |accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UK===
[[Todmorden]] is a town of 17,000 inhabitants in [[Yorkshire]], [[United Kingdom]] with a [[Incredible Edible Todmorden project|successful urban agriculture model]]. The project, which began in 2008, has meant that food crops have been planted at forty locations throughout the town.&lt;ref&gt;Paull, John (2013) [http://orgprints.org/24956/28/24956.pdf  "Please Pick Me" – How Incredible Edible Todmorden is repurposing the commons for open source food and agricultural biodiversity],  In J.

All are "propaganda gardens" promoting locals to consider growing local, to eat seasonal, to consider the provenance of their food, and to enjoy fresh.&lt;ref name="Tod"/&gt; There are food plots in the street, in the health center car park, at the rail station, in the police station, in the cemetery, and in all the town's schools.&lt;ref name="Tod"/&gt;

===Argentina===
The city of [[Rosario]] (population: 1.3 million) has incorporated agriculture fully into its land use planning and urban development strategy. Its Land Use Plan 2007-2017 makes specific provision for the agricultural use of public land. Under its Metropolitan Strategic Plan 2008-2018, Rosario is building a “green circuit”, passing through and around the city, consisting of family and community gardens, large-scale, commercial vegetable gardens and orchards, multifunctional garden parks, and “productive barrios”, where agriculture is integrated into programmes for the construction of public housing and the upgrading of slums. In 2014, the green circuit consisted of more than 30 ha of land used to grow vegetables, fruit and medicinal and aromatic plants. The city has five garden parks – large, landscaped green areas covering a total of 72 ha of land, which are used for agriculture and for cultural, sports and educational activities.&lt;ref&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization (2014) [http://www.fao.org/ag/agp/greenercities/en/GGCLAC/rosario.html Growing greener cities in Latin America and the Caribbean].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
The benefits that UPA brings along to cities that implement this practice are numerous. The transformation of cities from only consumers of food to generators of agricultural products contributes to sustainability, improved health, and poverty alleviation.

* UPA assists to close the open loop system in urban areas characterized by the importation of food from rural zones and the exportation of waste to regions outside the city or town.
* Wastewater and organic solid waste can be transformed into resources for growing agriculture products: the former can be used for irrigation, the latter as fertilizer.
* Vacant urban areas can be used for agriculture production.
* Other natural resources can be conserved. The use of wastewater for irrigation improves [[water management]] and increases the availability of freshwater for drinking and household consumption.
* UPA can help to preserve bioregional ecologies from being transformed into cropland.
* Urban agriculture saves energy (e.g. energy consumed in transporting food from rural to urban areas).
* Local production of food also allows savings in transportation costs, storage, and in product loss, what results in food cost reduction.
* UPA improves the quality of the urban environment through greening and thus, a reduction in pollution.
* Urban agriculture also makes the city a healthier place to live by improving the quality of the environment.
* UPA is a very effective tool to fight against hunger and malnutrition since it facilitates the access to food by an impoverished sector of the urban population.
Poverty alleviation: It is known that a large part of the people involved in urban agriculture is the urban poor. In developing countries, the majority of urban agricultural production is for self-consumption, with surpluses being sold in the market. According to the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations), urban poor consumers spend between 60 and 80 percent of their income on food, making them very vulnerable to higher food prices.
* UPA provides food and creates savings in household expenditure on consumables, thus increasing the amount of income allocated to other uses.
* UPA surpluses can be sold in local markets, generating more income for the urban poor.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[Community center]]s and gardens educate the community to see agriculture as an integral part of urban life. The Florida House Institute for Sustainable Development in [[Sarasota, Florida]], serves as a public community and education center in which innovators with sustainable, energy-saving ideas can implement and test them. Community centers like Florida House provide urban areas with a central location to learn about urban agriculture and to begin to integrate agriculture with the urban lifestyle.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Smit, Jack, et al. "Urban Agriculture for Sustainable Cities: Using Wastes and Idle Land and Water Bodies as Resources"&lt;/ref&gt;

Urban farms also are a proven effective educational tool to teach kids about healthy eating and meaningful physical activity.&lt;ref&gt;Can a hands-on teaching tool affect students' attitudes and behavior regarding fruit and vegetables? by Lineberger Sarah E. and J. M. Zajicek, HortTechnology 10 (3) 593-596 -2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trade-offs==
* Space is at a premium in cities and is accordingly expensive and difficult to secure.
* The utilization of untreated wastewater for urban agricultural irrigation can facilitate the spread of waterborne diseases among the human population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.agwat.2011.04.005 |title=Urban agriculture, using sustainable practices that involve the reuse of wastewater and solid waste |journal=Agricultural Water Management |volume=98 |issue=9 |pages=1388–94 |year=2011 |last1=Rojas-Valencia |first1=M.N. |last2=Velásquez |first2=M.T. Orta de |last3=Franco |first3=Víctor }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Although studies have demonstrated improved air quality in urban areas related to the proliferation of urban gardens, it has also been shown that increasing urban pollution (related specifically to a sharp rise in the number of automobiles on the road), has led to an increase in insect pests, which consume plants produced by urban agriculture. It is believed that changes to the physical structure of the plants themselves, which have been correlated to increased levels of air pollution, increase plants' palatability to insect pests. Reduced yields within urban gardens decreases the amount of food available for human consumption.&lt;ref name="autogenerated226"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/13504509.2011.570803 |title=The effects of air pollution on urban ecosystems and agriculture |journal=International Journal of Sustainable Development &amp; World Ecology |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=226–35 |year=2011 |last1=Bell |first1=J. N.B. |last2=Power |first2=S. A. |last3=Jarraud |first3=N. |last4=Agrawal |first4=M. |last5=Davies |first5=C. }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Studies indicate that the nutritional quality of wheat suffers when urban wheat plants are exposed to high nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide concentrations. This problem is particularly acute in the developing world, where outdoor concentrations of sulfur dioxide are high and large percentages of the population rely upon urban agriculture as a primary source of food. These studies have implications for the nutritional quality of other staple crops that are grown in urban settings.&lt;ref name="autogenerated226"/&gt;
* Agricultural activities on land that is contaminated (with such metals as lead) pose potential risks to human health. These risks are associated both with working directly on contaminated land and with consuming food that was grown in contaminated soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.apgeog.2012.10.001 |title=Assessing soil lead contamination at multiple scales in Oakland, California: Implications for urban agriculture and environmental justice |journal=Applied Geography |volume=35 |pages=460–73 |year=2012 |last1=McClintock |first1=Nathan }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Municipal greening policy goals can pose conflicts. For example, policies promoting urban tree canopy are not sympathetic to vegetable gardening because of the deep shade cast by trees. However, some municipalities like Portland, Oregon, and Davenport, Iowa are encouraging the implementation of fruit-bearing trees (as street trees or as park orchards) to meet both greening and food production goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nordahl|first=Darrin|title=Public Produce: The New Urban Agriculture|year=2009|publisher=Island Press|location=Washington DC|isbn=978-1-59726-588-1}}{{page needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
