__NOTOC__
The term '''study circle''' has become common terminology in the [[Bahá'í Faith]] to describe a specific type of gathering for the study of the [[Bahá'í teachings]], with an emphasis on "promoting the well-being of humanity."&lt;ref&gt;The introduction to 'Reflections on the Life of the Spirit' states that the Institute's purpose is "to use the courses as means of serving the Cause and promoting the well-being of humanity." (p. 1)&lt;/ref&gt;

Study circles are a form of [[distance learning]] designed to systematically bring education about spiritual concepts to the grassroots level.  Because they are intended to be sustainable and reproducible on a large scale, study circles shy away from formally taught classes, opting instead for participatory methods.  They are usually led by a tutor whose role is not to act as an expert but rather to facilitate the rhythm and pace of the study circle.  In this way, attendees of study circles are expected to become active participants in their own learning process.

Another foundational principle of study circles is a heavy emphasis on the [[:Category:Bahá'í texts|Bahá'í writings]] as a means of finding unity of vision and action by focusing on the essentials of Bahá'í belief.

At the present time, the most common curriculum used in study circles is one that was originally developed at the [[Ruhi Institute]] in [[Colombia]] but is now used in Bahá'í communities all over the world.  Because of its origin, most [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]] refer to this curriculum as the Ruhi sequence or Ruhi materials.  Additional courses used by study circles vary from country to country and include the "Fundamental Verities" and "Core Curriculum" materials developed in the United States, among others.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6106">{{short description|Organic matter in waste which can be broken down into carbon dioxide, water, methane or simple organic molecules}}
'''Biodegradable waste''' includes any [[organic matter]] in  [[type of waste|waste]] which can be broken down into carbon dioxide, water, methane or simple organic molecules by micro-organisms and other living things by [[compost]]ing, [[aerobic digestion]], [[anaerobic digestion]] or similar processes. In waste management, it also includes some inorganic materials which can be decomposed by bacteria. Such materials include [[gypsum]] and its products such as [[plasterboard]] and other simple organic [[sulfate]]s which can decompose to yield [[hydrogen sulphide]] in anaerobic land-fill conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why can't I put my leftover gyproc/drywall in the garbage? |publisher=Recycling Council of British Columbia|url=https://www.rcbc.ca/resources/faqs/hazard9}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Fact Sheet: Methane and Hydrogen Sulfide Gases at C&amp;DD Landfills|publisher=Environmental Protection Agency. State of Ohio, U.S.|url= http://epa.ohio.gov/portals/34/document/guidance/gd_669.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In domestic waste collection, the scope of biodegradable waste may be narrowed to include only those degradable wastes capable of being handled in the local waste handling facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccc.govt.nz/services/rubbish-and-recycling/sorting/organics-green-bin/|publisher=Christchurch City Council|title=Organics -Green Bin|access-date=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources==
Biodegradable waste can be found in [[municipal solid waste]] (sometimes called biodegradable municipal waste, or BMW) as [[green waste]], [[food waste]], [[paper]] waste, and [[biodegradable plastics]]. Other [[Biodegradation|biodegradable]] wastes include [[human waste]], [[manure]], [[sewage]], [[sewage sludge]] and [[slaughterhouse waste]]. In the absence of [[oxygen]], much of this waste will decay to [[methane]] by [[anaerobic digestion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cslondon.org/downloads/2010_Waste_Review.pdf CSL London Olympics Waste Review]. cslondon.org&lt;/ref&gt;

In many parts of the developed world, biodegradable waste is separated from the rest of the waste stream, either by separate kerb-side collection or by waste sorting after collection. At the point of collection such waste is often referred to as ''green waste''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccc.govt.nz/services/rubbish-and-recycling/sorting/organics-green-bin/|title=Organics - Green Bin|publisher= Christchurch City Council|access-date=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Removing such waste from the rest of the waste stream substantially reduces waste volumes for disposal and also allows biodegradable waste to be [[compost]]ed.

==Uses of biodegradable waste==
Biodegradable waste can be used for composting or a resource for heat, electricity and fuel by means of [[incineration]] or [[anaerobic digestion]].&lt;ref&gt;[[National Non-Food Crops Centre]]. [http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/tools/evaluation-of-opportunities-for-converting-indigenous-uk-wastes-to-fuels-and-energy-report-nnfcc-09-012 NNFCC report on Evaluation of Opportunities for Converting Indigenous UK Wastes to Fuels and Energy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720181907/http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/tools/evaluation-of-opportunities-for-converting-indigenous-uk-wastes-to-fuels-and-energy-report-nnfcc-09-012 |date=2011-07-20 }}. nnfcc.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; Swiss ''Kompogas'' and the Danish ''AIKAN'' process are examples of anaerobic digestion of biodegradable waste.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kompogas-utzenstorf.ch/pdf/kreislauf.pdf Recycling chain]. kompogas-utzenstorf.ch&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aikantechnology.com/ AIKAN website]. aikantechnology.com&lt;/ref&gt; While incineration can recover the most energy, anaerobic digestion plants retain nutrients and make compost for soil amendment and still recover some of the contained energy in the form of [[biogas]]. Kompogas produced 27 million [[Kwh]] of electricity and biogas in 2009. The oldest of the company's lorries has achieved 1,000,000 kilometers driven with biogas from household waste in the last 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zuonline.ch/storys/storys.cfm?vID=1585|title=Gesundheit, Kraft und Energie für 2002|date=3 January 2002|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020902075207/http://www.zuonline.ch/storys/storys.cfm?vID=1585|work=zuonline.ch|archivedate=2 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas relying on organic waste==

Featured in an edition of ''[[The Economist]]'' that predicted events in 2014, it was revealed that [[Massachusetts]] creates roughly 1.4 million tons of organic waste every year&lt;ref&gt;https://www.economist.com/news/2013/11/18/waste-not-want-not&lt;/ref&gt;. Massachusetts, along with [[Connecticut]] and [[Vermont]], are also going to enact laws to divert food waste from landfills.

In small and densely populated states, landfill capacity is limited so disposal costs are higher ($60–90 per ton in MA compared to national average of $49&lt;ref&gt;https://nrra.net/sweep/cost-to-landfill-waste-continues-to-rise-through-2016/&lt;/ref&gt;). Decomposing food waste generates methane, a notorious [[greenhouse gas]]. However, this biogas can be captured and turned into energy through anaerobic digestion, and then sold into the electricity grid.

[[File:Septic tank EN.svg|thumb|right|Scheme of a cesspit which is constructed like an underground holding tank]]
A '''cesspit''' (or '''cesspool''' or '''soak pit''' in some contexts), is a term with various meanings: it is used to describe either an underground holding tank (sealed at the bottom) or a soak pit (not sealed at the bottom).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-3-906484-57-0|url = http://www.eawag.ch/forschung/sandec/publikationen/compendium_e/index_EN|title = Compendium of Sanitation Systems and Technologies - (2nd Revised 2rEdition)|author1=Tilley, E. |author2=Ulrich, L. |author3=Lüthi, C. |author4=Reymond, Ph. |author5=Zurbrügg, C. |publisher = Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag), Duebendorf, Switzerland}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be used for the temporary collection and storage of [[Human feces|feces]], excreta or fecal sludge as part of an on-site [[sanitation]] system and has some similarities with [[septic tank]]s or with soak pits. Traditionally, it was a deep cylindrical chamber dug into the earth, having approximate dimensions of 1 metre diameter and 2–3 metres depth. Their appearance was similar to that of a hand-dug water well.

The pit can be lined with bricks or concrete, covered with a slab and needing to be emptied frequently when it is used like an underground holding tank.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In other cases (if soil and [[groundwater]] conditions allow), it is not constructed watertight, to allow liquid to leach out (similar to a [[pit latrine]] or to a soak pit).

== Uses ==
[[File:Cess Pool in Slovakia.jpg|thumb|An empty, old cesspool in Slovakia]]
=== Holding tank ===
In the UK a cesspit is a sealed tank for the reception and temporary storage of [[sewage]]; in North America this is simply referred to as a "[[holding tank]]". Because it is sealed, the tank must be emptied frequently &amp;mdash; in many cases as often as weekly. Because of the need for frequent emptying, the cost of maintenance of a cesspit can be very high.

=== Infiltration systems ===
A cesspool was at one time{{when|date=April 2016}} built like a [[dry well]] lined with loose-fitting brick or stone, used for the disposal of sewage via infiltration into the soil. Liquids leaked out through the soil as conditions allowed, while solids decayed and collected as  composted matter in the base of the cesspool. As the solids accumulated, eventually the particulate solids blocked the escape of liquids, causing the cesspool to drain more slowly or to overflow.

A [[biofilm]] forms in the loose soil surrounding a cesspool or [[pit latrine]] which provides some degree of attenuation of the pollutants present, but a very deep cesspool can allow raw sewage to directly enter [[groundwater]] with minimal biological cleansing, leading to [[groundwater pollution]] and undrinkable water supplies.  It is for this reason that deep water wells on the property must be drilled far from the cesspool.

Most residential waste cesspools in use in the US today are rudimentary septic systems, consisting of a concrete-capped pit lined with [[concrete masonry unit]]s (cinder blocks) laid on their sides with perforated [[drain field]] piping ([[weeping tile]]) extending outward below the level of the intake connection. The concrete cover will often have a cleanout pipe extending above ground. Some are constructed with concrete walls on one or more sides.

The waste cesspool is vulnerable to overloading or flooding by heavy rains or snow melt because it is not enclosed and sealed like conventional septic tank systems. It is also vulnerable to the entry of tree roots which can eventually cause the system to fail.

== Regulations ==
Modern environmental regulations either discourage or ban the use of cesspools, and instead connections to municipal [[Sanitary sewer|sewage systems]] or [[septic tank]]s are encouraged or required.

In many countries, planning and development regulations for the protection of the watershed prevent home-owners who live close to rivers and environmentally sensitive areas from installing a [[septic system]], requiring a holding tank instead.

=== United States ===
In some localities in the U.S., existing rural residential waste cesspools are "[[Grandfather clause|grandfathered]]" or allowed to continue operations until they no longer function. Once defunct, they must be disconnected and replaced by modern septic systems. In areas that have a higher than usual [[water table]] or fail a [[percolation test]], an above-ground drain field waste disposal system may be installed instead.

In the case of sale or transfer of residential property that uses an existing waste cesspool system, local laws may differ. Some counties or jurisdictions do not permit the sale of residential property that utilizes a waste cesspool. Other counties or villages may recognize the "grandfather clause" and allow the property sale or transfer.

=== Europe ===
In France, Germany, Spain and Switzerland, cesspits are forbidden.

== History ==
{{seealso|History of water supply and sanitation}}
===United States===
The typical American urbanite in the 1870s relied on the rural solution of individual well and outhouse (privy) or cesspools. Baltimore in the 1880s smelled "like a billion [[polecat]]s," according to [[H. L. Mencken]], and a [[Chicago]]an said in his city "the stink is enough to knock you down." Improvement was slow, and large cities of the East and South depended to the end of the century mainly on drainage through open gutters. Pollution of water supplies by [[sewage]] as well as dumping of [[industrial waste]] accounted in large measures for the public health records and staggering mortality rates of the period.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The National Experience}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===
Cesspits were introduced to Europe in the 16th century, at a time when urban populations were growing at a faster rate than in the past. The added burden of waste volume began overloading urban street gutters, where [[chamber pot]]s were emptied each day. There was no regulation of cesspit construction until the 18th century, when a need to address sanitation and safety concerns became apparent. Cesspits were cleaned out by tradesmen using shovels and horse-drawn wagons. Cesspools were cleaned only at night, to reduce the smell and annoyance to the public. The typical cesspit was cleaned out once every 8 to 10 years. Fermentation of the solid waste collecting in cesspits, however, resulted in dangerous infections and gases that sometimes asphyxiated cesspit cleaners. Cesspits began to be cleaned out more regularly, but strict regulations for cesspit construction and ventilation were not introduced until the 1800s.&lt;ref name="La Berge 2002 207–9"&gt;{{cite book|last=La Berge|first=Ann Elizabeth Fowler|title=Mission and Method: The Early Nineteenth-Century French Public Health Movement|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521527019|pages=207–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before construction reforms were introduced in the early 19th century, liquid waste would seep away through the ground, leaving solid waste behind in the cesspit. While this made removal of solid waste easier, the seeping liquid waste often contaminated well water sources, creating public health problems. Municipal reforms required that cesspits be built of solid walls of stone and concrete. This kept liquid waste in the cesspit, forcing cesspits to be cleaned more frequently, on average two or three times per year. Liquid cesspit waste would be removed with pumps by cesspit cleaners, and then solid waste, valuable as fertilizer and for manufacturing [[ammonia]], was removed.&lt;ref name="La Berge 2002 207–9" /&gt; 
 
In 1846, French public hygienist [[Alphone Guérard]] estimated that 100 cesspits were cleaned in Paris every night, by 200-250 total cesspit cleaners in the city, and out of a total of 30,000 cesspits. The replacement of Paris' cesspit system was challenged for decades by officials not on public hygiene grounds, but on economic ones, based on the desire to conserve human waste as fertilizer rather than disposing of it in a modern sewer system. Paris' sewer system began modernizing in the 1880s, with the conversion of storm sewers for public sewage. Some cesspits were still in use in Paris into the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=La Berge|first=Ann Elizabeth Fowler|title=Mission and Method: The Early Nineteenth-Century French Public Health Movement|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521527019|pages=209, 215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Society and culture ==

=== Accidents ===
In Suffolk County, on Long Island, [[New York (state)|New York]], most households still use cesspools for waste drainage.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Shovel Ready|date=2011-01-24|url=http://www.johnderbyshire.com/Opinions/Straggler/098.html|author=[[John Derbyshire]]|journal=[[National Review]]|volume=63|issue=1|page=55|issn=0028-0038|department=The Straggler}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cesspool collapses have occurred in this area, for example on December 8, 2009. Two workers in a decommissioned cesspit were trapped, subsequently leading to a two-hour rescue mission. Since 1998, six cases of cesspools collapsing and sucking in human residents that were standing over them have been reported, injuring a total of seven people, killing one in 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,192807,00.html|title=Man, Son, Neighbor Sucked Into N.Y.

These structures weakened over their lifespan leading to increased risk of collapse. Newer cesspools are [[Precast concrete|cast concrete]] which dramatically decrease any risk of collapse. All new construction in areas without waste sewer systems use these new precast cesspools. In addition, cast concrete cesspools are used commonly in commercial construction for storm water collection.

'''Codevelopment''' is a trend of thought and a development strategy in [[development studies]]
which considers [[Immigration|migrants]] to be a developing factor for their countries of origin.

Although it is widely accepted that it was [[France|French]] scholar [[Sami Naïr]] who first coined the word codevelopment, it is believed this phenomenon has existed alongside migrations since they exist. Traditionally, immigrants (especially those who migrate for economic reasons) have, collectively or individually, supported their communities of origin.

In 1997 Sami Naïr, while directing the Interministerial Mission on Migration/Codevelopment, defined this last concept as ''a proposal for integrating immigration and development in a way that migration fluxes will benefit both the country of origin and the country of destination. This is, a consensual relationship between two countries that will allow migration to the country of destiny not to imply an equivalent loss in the country of origin''.

Adherents to this model believe that it fosters mutual collaboration among countries in a way that traditional and hierarchical north-south development focus did not.
In this context, immigrant initiatives enrich the countries of origin both from a cultural and a [[human resources]] perspective. Their condition as transnational citizens would allow them a better understanding of the needs of both the communities of origin and destination.
For this reason, their participation in projects involving members of their communities, in both “their” countries would be more effective, as priorities and needs would be correctly identified.
On the other hand, this participation would also work as an integrating force in the destination countries, as they would be perceived as an enriching factor by the public opinion and institutions.

== Codevelopment and migration control ==

In countries receiving immigration, codevelopment has been implemented by the institutions in a different way. Since they were first implemented in France, codevelopment initiatives in Europe have been frequently linked to control of the migration fluxes, often promoting the return of immigrants.

At a European level, codevelopment was first mentioned during the [[Tampere Summit]] held in October 1999, when the [[European Council]] defined 5 guidelines for the new European migration policy aimed at a common space of ''"Liberty, Security and Justice".''
Anyhow, critics consider that Tampere quickly shifted towards a [[Fortress Europe]] mentality, limiting [[development aid]] to those countries willing to implement migration control measures and accepting repatriations.

An example of this tendency may be found in the imbalance between de 23 million euro budget that the [[European Union|EU]] plans on investing in the [[Schengen Information System]] and the [[Visa Information System]] (aimed at a further immigrant identification and control) with the 3 million euro budget (4 million in its second year) granted to codevelopment projects.

== Codevelopment in Spain ==

Since the late nineties, codevelopment has been the subject of postgraduate studies, specialist courses, discussions and forums among multiple stakeholders, as well as calls for project grants by some local and regional administrations, beginning with the Municipality of Madrid.  These authorities quickly became aware of the local impact of the presence of new immigrant communities, the importance of the links that bind them with their communities of origin, and the desirability of relating them in any future action to support the policies of cooperation. Codevelopment policies had a much stronger presence and development in the regional and local levels.

At the state level, in accordance with Tampere Summit on Migration, the GRECO Plan on migration management (Programa Global de Regulación y Coordinación de la Extranjería y la Inmigración 2000-2004), was launched by the Interior Ministry in 2001. This Plan devoted an important space for “joint development”, in line with the policies of Tampere and the French government. GRECO insisted on technical and educational cooperation, the voluntary return of migrants, the channelling of migrants’ remittances to development projects, and finally, on the cooperation with those governments that were ready to accept the returned illegal migrants, as well as to control the exit of their citizens with destination Spain. However, codevelopment was not even mentioned as a policy line in the Immigration law passed in 2000, and did not receive proper funding within the GRECO’s framework.

Since ending 2004, codevelopment policies have been open to discussion, including the contents, limits, and plans. Two state agencies claimed their space in codevelopment actions: the State Secretary for International Cooperation, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the brand new General Directorate of Immigrants’ Integration, at the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.

===Codevelopment policy ===

During 2005 there has been progress in the search for a consensus on competences and actors. A codevelopment line was mainstreamed in the Master Plans on Development Cooperation, and two years later, also in the new Integration Plan, called Strategic Plan on Citizenship and Integration 2007-2010, which was finally implemented in 2007, by the Ministry of Labour and Migration.

Regional and local authorities soon adopted this win/win approach and consequently launched several codevelopment guidelines within their Integration Plans and Development Cooperation Strategies. Ending 2009, most of the Spanish Regions (Comunidades Autónomas) had considered codevelopment and had set up budget lines both for migrants' associations and Development NGOs. Graciela Malgesini argues that codevelopment and migrants' remittances partly redirect the decentralized cooperation funds to their countries of origin.

===Current definitions of codevelopment ===

In the last ten years, academic research on codevelopment increased, as a result of the strong immigration process experienced by the Spanish society from 2000 onwards (which represented nearly 80% of Spain’s demographic growth). Many universities decided to open up new learning courses on the matter, following the steps of the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid. Several doctoral thesis are currently being carried out, focusing diverse aspects of codevelopment, including the impact of migration and remittances in the sending countries, mainly Ecuador, Colombia and Morocco. Migrants living in Spain remitted nearly €10 billion, in 2007 (while the overall Spanish OAD summed only half of this amount).

According to Graciela Malgesini, spontaneous codevelopment could be defined as the win/win effect, the linkage between migration and development, which generates mostly positive impacts on both the society of origin of immigrants, and the host society. This definition presumes the role of immigrants as actors and vectors of development, in "both sides", and the understanding of the relations between host countries (North) and sending countries (South) in a horizontal way. Codevelopment is directly related to Transnationalism.

Carlos Gimenez pinpointed other two characteristics of codevelopment: (1) The multiplicity of stakeholders (a network of participants that surpasses both quantitatively and qualitatively the traditional agents in the traditional development cooperation projects, as it includes authorities, social organizations, trade unions, universities, training institutes, businesses and immigrant associations). (2) Transnational citizenship (immigrants acting in codevelopment activities, embedded in a transnational dynamic, are also transnational citizens, to the extent that they have a dual presence. This dual space of belonging, in turn, encourages decision making, influences on the economic, political and social development, and allows the formation of a separate identity, based on two geographical areas, the country of origin and the country of destination).

===Codevelopment in practice ===

Transnationalism and codevelopment are spreading.In Latin America, covedelopment is a relatively new idea, but it has been embraced by grassroots organizations. For example, on November 25, 2010, FAMIGRANTES—the Federation of associations gathering migrants' family members in South America—gathered in their 4th Meeting on Migration and Codevelopment, in Rosario, Argentina. They stated that the codevelopment approach was the best way of understanding the contribution that their relatives were making both in the reception countries and in their homelands (www.famigrantes.org and www.famisur.org). At the same time, more than 100 migrants' associations launched FEDACOD (Federation of Associations for Codevelopment) in Valencia, Spain, on September 24, 2010 (www.fedacod.com).

'''Cognitive ethology''' is a branch of [[ethology]] concerned with the influence of conscious awareness and intention on the behaviour of an animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Harber|title=Collins COBUILD Advanced Dictionary of English|year=2012|publisher=Higher Education Press|isbn=9787040327878}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donald Griffin]], a [[zoology]] professor in the United States, set up the foundations for researches in the cognitive awareness of animals within their habitats.&lt;ref&gt;Ristau, C, Erlbaum L, et al. (1991). Cognitive Ethology. "Biological Psychology",  32 (2-3): 220-222&lt;/ref&gt;

The fusion of [[cognitive science]] and classical [[ethology]] into cognitive ethology "emphasizes observing animals under more-or-less natural conditions, with the objective of understanding the evolution, adaptation (function), causation, and development of the species-specific [[behavioral repertoire]]" ([[Niko Tinbergen]] 1963).

According to Jamieson &amp; Bekoff (1993),&lt;ref&gt;: Dale Jamieson and Marc Bekoff
Source: Analysis, Vol. 52, No. 1 (Jan., 1992), pp. 23-28&lt;/ref&gt; "Tinbergen's four questions about the evolution, adaptation, causation and development of behavior can be applied to the cognitive and mental abilities of animals."

(1998) Book review of Allen &amp; Bekoff (1997) on Cognitive Ethology.&lt;/ref&gt; attempt to show how cognitive ethology can take on the central questions of cognitive science, taking as their starting point the four questions described by Barbara Von Eckardt in her 1993 book ''What is Cognitive Science?'', generalizing the four questions and adding a fifth. Kingstone, Smilek &amp; Eastwood (2008) suggested that cognitive ethology should include human behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Kingstone, A., Smilek, D. &amp; Eastwood, J. D., (2008) 'Cognitive Ethology: a new approach for studying human cognition'. British Journal of Psychology, 99, 317-340&lt;/ref&gt; They proposed that researchers should firstly study how people behave in their natural, real world environments and then move to the lab. Anthropocentric claims for the ways non-human animals interact in their social and non-social worlds are often used to influence decisions on how the non-human animals can or should be used by humans.&lt;ref&gt;Bekoff, M. (1994) "Cognitive ethology and the treatment of non-human animals: How matters of mind inform matters of welfare." Animal Welfare, Vol 3(2),75-96&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relation to laboratory experimental psychology ==
Traditionally, cognitive ethologists have questioned research methods that isolate animals in unnatural surroundings and present them with a limited set of artificial stimuli, arguing that such techniques favor the study of artificial issues that are not relevant to an understanding of the natural behavior of animals.  However, many modern researchers favor a judicious combination of field and laboratory methods.&lt;ref&gt;Shettleworth, S. J. (2010) ''Cognition, Evolution, and Behavior'' New York: Oxford&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relation to ethics ==
Bekoff, M and Allen, C (1997) "identify three major groups of people (among some of whose members there are blurred distinctions) with different views on cognitive ethology, namely, slayers, skeptics, and proponents." The latter seemingly convergent with [[animal rights]] thinking in seeing animal experience as worthy in itself.

[[Ethicist]] [[Peter Singer]] is an example of a "proponent" in this sense, as is biologist [[E. O. Wilson]] who coined the term [[biophilia hypothesis|biophilia]] to describe the basis of a direct [[moral cognition]], that 'higher' animals would use to perceive moral implications in the environment directly.

==Three views==
According to Marc Bekoff, there are three different views towards whether a science of cognitive ethology is even possible. Slayers deny any possibility of success in cognitive ethology, proponents keep an open mind about animal cognition and the utility of cognitive ethological investigation, and skeptics stand somewhere in between.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bekoff|first=Marc|title=Cognitive Ethology and the Explanation of Nonhuman Animal Behavior|journal=Comparative Approaches to Cognitive Science. J.A. Meyer and H. L. Roitblat, eds .|year=1995|pages=119–150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''colicin''' is a type of [[bacteriocin]] produced by and toxic to some strains of ''[[Escherichia coli]]''.&lt;ref&gt;*  {{cite journal | vauthors = Feldgarden M, Riley MA | year = 1999 | title = The phenotypic and fitness effects of colicin resistance in Escherichia coli K-12 | journal = Evolution | volume = 53 | issue = 4| pages = 1019–27 | jstor=2640807 | doi=10.2307/2640807}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colicins are released into the environment to reduce competition from other [[bacterial strain]]s. Colicins bind to [[TonB-dependent receptors|outer membrane receptor]]s, using them to [[Translocase of the outer membrane|translocate]] to the cytoplasm or cytoplasmic membrane, where they exert their cytotoxic effect, including depolarisation of the cytoplasmic membrane, [[DNase]] activity, [[RNase]] activity, or inhibition of [[murein]] synthesis.

==Structure==
Channel-forming colicins (colicins A, B, E1, Ia, Ib, and N) are [[transmembrane protein]]s that depolarize the cytoplasmic membrane, leading to dissipation of cellular energy.&lt;ref name="PUB00030669"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kang C, Postle K, Chen G, Park H, Youn B, Hilsenbeck JL |title=Crystal structure of the cytotoxic bacterial protein colicin B at 2.5 A resolution |journal=Mol.

[http://mmbr.asm.org/cgi/content/abstract/71/1/158 Abstract][http://mmbr.asm.org/cgi/reprint/71/1/158 pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;  One domain regulates the target and binds to the receptor on the sensitive cell.  The second is involved with translocation, co-opting the machinery of the target cell.  The third is the 'killing' domain and may produce a pore in the target [[cell membrane]], or act as a [[nuclease]] to chop up the [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] of the target cell.

==Translocation==
Most colicins are able to translocate the outer membrane by a two-receptor system, where one receptor is used for the initial binding and the second for translocation. The initial binding is to [[TonB-dependent receptors|cell surface receptors]] such as the outer membrane proteins OmpF, FepA, BtuB, Cir and FhuA; colicins have been classified according to which receptors they bind to. The presence of specific periplasmic proteins, such as [[Outer membrane efflux proteins|TolA, TolB, TolC]], or TonB, are required for translocation across the membrane.&lt;ref name="PUB00014773"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cao Z, Klebba PE |title=Mechanisms of colicin binding and transport through outer membrane porins |journal=Biochimie |volume=84 |issue=5-6 |pages=399–412 |year=2002 |pmid=12423783 |doi=10.1016/S0300-9084(02)01455-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cloacin DF13 is a bacteriocin that inactivates ribosomes by hydrolysing 16S RNA in 30S ribosomes at a specific site.&lt;ref name="PUB00006229"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=van den Elzen PJ, Veltkamp E, Nijkamp HJ, Walters HH |title=Molecular structure and function of the bacteriocin gene and bacteriocin protein of plasmid Clo DF13 |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=11 |issue=8 |pages=2465–2477 |year=1983 |pmid=6344017 |doi=10.1093/nar/11.8.2465 |pmc=325896}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resistance==
Because they target specific receptors and use specific translocation machinery, cells can make themselves resistant to the colicin by repressing or deleting the genes for these proteins.  Such resistant cells may suffer the lack of a key nutrient (such as [[iron]] or a [[vitamin B|B vitamin]]), but benefit by not being killed.  Colicins exhibit a '1-hit killing kinetic' which does not necessarily mean a single molecule is sufficient to kill, but certainly that it only takes a small number.  In his 1969 Nobel Laureate speech, [[Salvador E. Luria]] speculated that colicins could only be this toxic by causing a [[domino effect]] that destabilized the cell membrane.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1969/luria-lecture.html Luria, S. E. (1969)  Nobel Lecture]&lt;/ref&gt;  He was not entirely correct, but pore-forming colicins do depolarize the membrane and thus eliminate the energy source for the cell.  The colicins are highly effective [[toxin]]s.

==Genetic organisation==
Virtually all colicins are carried on [[plasmid]]s.  The two general classes of colicinogenic plasmids are large, low-copy-number plasmids, and small, high-copy-number plasmids.  The larger plasmids carry other genes, as well as the colicin operon.  The colicin operons are generally organized with several major [[gene]]s.  These include an immunity gene, a colicin structural gene, and a [[bacteriocin release protein]] (BRP), or [[lysis]], gene.  The immunity gene is often produced constitutively, while the BRP is generally produced only as a read-through of the [[stop codon]] on the colicin structural gene.  The colicin itself is repressed by the [[SOS response]] and may be regulated in other ways, as well.

Retaining the colicin plasmid is very important for cells that live with their relatives, because if a cell loses the immunity gene, it quickly becomes subject to destruction by circulating colicin.  At the same time, colicin is only released from a producing cell by the use of the lysis protein, which results in that cell's death.  This suicidal production mechanism would appear to be very costly, except for the fact that it is regulated by the [[SOS response]], which responds to significant [[DNA]] damage.  In short, colicin production may only occur in terminally ill cells.  The Professor Kleanthous Research Group at the [[University of Oxford]] study colicins extensively as a model system for characterising and investigating protein-protein interactions and recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kleanthous Research Group|url=http://www.bioch.ox.ac.uk/aspsite/index.asp?pageid=910|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13235">The '''destruction of Mosul Museum artifacts''' became publicly known on February 26, 2015 when the group known as [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]] released a video showing their destruction.

==Mosul Museum==
The [[Mosul Museum]], opened in 1952, is the second largest museum in Iraq, with the first being the [[National Museum of Iraq]]. The museum is split into four areas of focus: The Assyrian hall, the Hatrene hall, the Islamic hall, and the Prehistoric hall.

===Importance of the region===
Iraq's present day borders overlap with the historic extent of [[Mesopotamia]]. Mesopotamia is considered to be one of the first areas in which urbanization evolved, beginning around the 4th millennia B.C. The "city" became the center of the new social system, resulting in the need of centralized power.&lt;ref&gt;[Huot, J. Louis (2008). The Importance of Iraq's Cultural Heritage. In P.G. Stone &amp; J.F. Bajjaly (Eds.), ''The Destruction of Cultural Heritage in Iraq'' (pp. 20) The Boydell press.]&lt;/ref&gt; Artistically, the land of Iraq holds evidence of the switch from stylized and schematic figures to more realistic representations of the human form. Writing evolved during this time period as well, allowing people to describe divine figures and conceptualize religion.&lt;ref&gt;[Huot, J. Louis (2008). The Importance of Iraq's Cultural Heritage. In P.G. Stone &amp; J.F. Bajjaly (Eds.), ''The Destruction of Cultural Heritage in Iraq''.]&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological efforts uncovered evidence of Mesopotamia as a world contemporary with the Bible, with many stories on cuneiform tablets describing versions of similar biblical texts.&lt;ref&gt;[Huot, J. Louis (2008). The Importance of Iraq's Cultural Heritage. In P.G. Stone &amp; J.F. Bajjaly (Eds.), ''The Destruction of Cultural Heritage in Iraq'' (pp. 22) The Boydell press.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The world's understanding of Iraq and its history comes from the archaeological efforts that have taken place on its land. Because of a lack of visible architectural remains in the area, Mesopotamia, and Iraq in particular, are where the "treasure hunting" of old transformed into the beginnings of  the real archaeological research we know today. Archaeologists have been researching in Iraq for over a century and a half, lending us a great amount of time to truly understand the region's impact on those who live there and ultimately, the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[Huot, J. Louis (2008). The Importance of Iraq's Cultural Heritage. In P.G. Stone &amp; J.F. Bajjaly (Eds.), ''The Destruction of Cultural Heritage in Iraq'' (pp. 20) The Boydell press.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Destruction (2015)==

===Contents of ISIL video===
In a video shared on February 26, 2015, ISIL entered the Mosul Museum with the purpose of destroying artifacts they deemed "idolatrous". Members of the group can be seen pushing over many statues, while using jackhammers and sledgehammers to damage the faces of others. A spokesperson appears in the beginning of the video, explaining the rationale behind the group's actions. The rationale pertains to the assumption that these objects (statues, figurines, etc.) were once worshiped instead of Allah.

A translation from the video is as follows: "These ruins that are behind me, they are idols and statues that people in the past used to worship instead of Allah. The so-called Assyrians and Akkadians and others looked to gods for war, agriculture and rain to whom they offered sacrifices…The Prophet Mohammed took down idols with his bare hands when he went into Mecca. We were ordered by our prophet to take down idols and destroy them, and the companions of the prophet did this after this time, when they conquered countries." &lt;ref&gt;[https://gatesofnineveh.wordpress.com/2015/02/27/assessing-the-damage-at-the-mosul-museum-part-1-the-assyrian-artifacts/ Assessing the Damage at the Mosul Museum, Part 1: The Assyrian Artifacts]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Damage===
Not all of the museum's collection was damaged by ISIL. However, the most impacted were the Assyrian and Hatrene areas of the museum. The Islamic hall, which still held many priceless antiquities, was not shown in the video. The Prehistoric hall was also never shown, though most of those artifacts had been removed prior to the destruction.

====Assyrian====
*Nergal Gate: The Nergal Gate is located on the north side of [[Nineveh]], an ancient Mesopotamian city located in present-day Mosul. The gate was built sometime between 704 and 690 BC, which was a time of expansion for Nineveh under the ruler [[Sennacherib]]. The gate is related to the ancient Mesopotamian god [[Nergal]], who was associated with the summer solstice, war, destruction, and the netherworld.   
*Lamassu: At the Nergal Gate's entrance, and just within the entrance, stand the [[lamassu]]. These mythological figures first began appearing in art and architecture during the first half of the second millennium B.C., and are described as large winged human-headed bulls. Aside from being decoration, the lamassu are protective figures, more specifically described as "a benevolent spirit attached to an individual, group, a place or an entrance." The lamassu erected at the entrance of the Nergal Gate at Nineveh are surrounded by relief sculpture that depicts the stages of transport of the human-headed bulls from quarries in Balatai.&lt;ref&gt;[Danrey, V. (2004). Winged Human-Headed Bulls of Ninevah: Genesis of an Iconographic Motif. Papers of the 49th Rencontre Assyriologique Internationale. Vol. 66, Ninevah.]&lt;/ref&gt;   
[[File:BM; RM6 - ANE, Assyrian Sculpture 13 West Wall (M + N) ~ Assyrian Empire + -Lamassu, Gates at Balawat, Relief Panel's) &amp; Full Projection.2.JPG|thumb|Lamassu and Balawat Gate in the British Museum]]

Before the release of the ISIL video on February 26, 2015, the lamassu were in various states of preservation. Of the two figures at the entrance of the gate, one still had its upper portion preserved. The video shows an ISIL member jackhammering face of the lamassu at the right side of the gate. The left one was probably untouched, as it has been missing its upper portion since the late 19th century. The ones located inside the gates were less well-preserved than their counterparts at the entrance. However, both were seen being damaged by jackhammers and sledgehammers. The Assyrian section within the Mosul Museum also holds other lamassu of an earlier style. These may also have become damaged.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gatesofnineveh.wordpress.com/2015/02/27/assessing-the-damage-at-the-mosul-museum-part-1-the-assyrian-artifacts/ Assessing the Damage at the Mosul Museum, Part 1: The Assyrian Artifacts]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Balawat Gates====
The Mosul Museum holds in its collection numerous bronze bands of the Balawat Gates, built during the reign of Ashurnasirpal II (883-859 BC). The bands are decorated with scenes of Assyrian war, hunt, and tribute.&lt;ref&gt;[J.E. Curtis &amp; N. Tallis. (2009). The Balawat gates of Ashurnasirpal II. In ''Journal of the American Oriental Society''. American Oriental Society. Vol. 129, No. 3. pp. 552-554.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Balawat Gates are of archaeological and historical significance because they are considered a "'major' find from a 'minor'" site.&lt;ref&gt;[Tucker, D.J. (1994). Representations of Igmur-Enlil on the Balawat Gates. In ''Iraq''. Vol. 56. pp. 107-116]&lt;/ref&gt; Tell-Balawat, the site from which the Balawat Gates originate, was considered a small site in comparison to the neighboring Assyrian sites of Nineveh and Nimrud. Through further research, Tell-Balawat (also known as the city of Igmur-Enlil), was found to be within a "hollow-way" between Nineveh and Nimrud, suggesting that its purpose included defending these two cities.&lt;ref&gt;[Tucker, D.J. (1994). Representations of Igmur-Enlil on the Balawat Gates. In ''Iraq''. Vol. 56. pp. 107-116]&lt;/ref&gt;

The displayed bands are shown on ISIL's video, but it is unknown whether they were destroyed at that time. Because the Mosul Museum was previously looted in 2003, some of the bands were already missing. Since the bands are considered portable, it is assumed that some were sold on the black market.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gatesofnineveh.wordpress.com/2015/02/27/assessing-the-damage-at-the-mosul-museum-part-1-the-assyrian-artifacts/ Assessing the Damage at the Mosul Museum, Part 1: The Assyrian Artifacts]&lt;/ref&gt; The British Museum holds a second pair of the Balawat Gates, built during the reign of Shalmaneser III. These are well documented, and can be used to aid in the identification of the Ashurnasirpal's bands if they arise.

====Hatrene statues====
Hatra was an ancient city located between the Roman Empire and the Parthian Empire, to the south of present-day Mosul. Its significance is great, as its historical and archaeological record indicate it was a wealthy trading city, influenced heavily by its neighboring peoples and empires. Hatra's artworks are of interest to scholars because they have been analyzed as hybrids of artistic styles from the West and East of the city. For example, a Hatrene statue of a seated goddess is described as having drapery consistent with Buddhist style, while also having the large, protruding eyes typical of Mesopotamian works.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed, S. Said (1972). Hatra, Iraq. In ''Archaeology''. Archaeological Institute of America. Vol. 25, No. 2. pp. 103-111.]&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Hercules Hatra Iraq Parthian period 1st 2nd century CE.jpg|thumb|Hatrene statue of Hercules]]

The Mosul Museum was home to a variety of Hatra's sculptures. Most of the sculptures were images of Hatrene kings or noblemen. The ISIL video shows many of these sculptures being hit with sledgehammers and toppled to the ground. Of the 27 known Hatrene sculptures of kings, 4 were seen damaged in the ISIL video. This represents a 15% loss of these sculptures that are known to be in existence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gatesofnineveh.wordpress.com/2015/03/03/assessing-the-damage-at-the-mosul-museum-part-2-the-sculptures-from-hatra/ Assessing the Damange at the Mosul Museum, Part 2: The Sculptures from Hatra]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Questioned authenticity of damaged artifacts====
According to Iraqi archaeologists, some of the collection belonging to the Mosul Museum was moved to the National Museum of Iraq in Baghdad six months prior to the release of the ISIL video. This spared many priceless artifacts from becoming damaged. Additionally, sources have suggested that a portion of the artifacts shown being damaged in the video were in fact reproductions or reconstructions. However, Iraqi archaeologists state this may not be the case entirely. Some artworks known to have been genuine were not shown in the video, leading archaeologists to believe that the portable objects were looted, while larger, non-portable objects were the only ones to be damaged.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/03/full-story-isil-takeover-mosul-museum-150309053022129.html/ The full story behind ISIL's takeover of Mosul Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Documentation===

The 2003 looting of the National Museum of Iraq showed the cultural heritage community the extreme importance of documentation within a museum or archaeological setting. The National Museum of Iraq lacked a complete inventory, which includes photographs of all objects. The problem became exacerbated when salvaged archaeological materials came into the museum in the late 1990s until the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The influx of artifacts made it very difficult for the staff to keep up with its documentation process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajaonline.org/online-review-museum/364 Learning from the Iraq Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://professorhistoryx.wordpress.com/2015/03/15/what-isis-destroys-why-and-why-we-must-document-it-hyperallergic/ What ISIS Destroys, Why, and Why We Must Document It]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mosul Museum may be in this same situation, though information on its documentation processes has not come to light. If photographs of their artifacts are in existence, they will be useful in identifying and recovering the looted artifacts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1342">'''ECSE''' is an abbreviation for ''[[Electrical Engineering]] and [[Computer science|Computer Sciences]] and [[Systems theory|Systems Engineering]].'' It is a designation used at some [[University|universities]] for the major or department that blends these three fields together.

One reason behind linking the areas of study is to provide students with a broad overview of each of [[software]], [[computer hardware|hardware]] and [[Systems theory]]. However there are also reasons for not blending departments: Students who major in theoretical computer science, studying such topics as algorithm analysis and software engineering, may not have any use for extensive electrical engineering or systems theory classes.{{Fact|date=December 2008}} 

Not every university uses the ECSE designation. Several universities, for example, have separate EE/ECE and CS departments/majors. Other schools use the similar [[Electrical and Computer Engineering|ECE]] (Electrical and Computer Engineering) designation. Additionally, some schools which offer an ECSE degree also offer degrees in Electrical Engineering or Computer Science separately.

The bibliographical definition of an '''edition''' includes all copies of a [[book]] printed “from substantially the same setting of [[typesetting|type]],” including all minor [[typography|typographical]] variants.

The numbering of book editions is a special case of the wider field of [[revision control]]. The traditional conventions for numbering book editions evolved spontaneously for several centuries before any greater [[applied science]] of revision control became important to humanity, which did not occur until the era of widespread [[computing]] had arrived (when [[software]] and [[electronic publishing]] came into existence). The old and new aspects of book edition numbering (from before and since the advent of computing) are discussed below.

[[File:UncleTomsCabinCover.jpg|thumb|rioght|180px|Title-page illustration by [[Hammatt Billings]] for ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'', First Edition: Boston: [[John P. Jewett]] and Company, 1852]]

According to the definition of ''edition'' above, a book printed today, by the same [[publisher]], and from the same type as when it was first published, is still the ''first edition'' of that book to a [[bibliographer]]. However, [[book collector]]s generally use the term ''first edition'' to mean specifically the first [[#Print run|print run]] of the first edition (aka "first edition, first impression"). Since World War II, books often include a number line ([[printer's key]]) that indicates the print run.

A "first edition" per se is not a valuable collectible book. A popular work may be published and reprinted over time by many publishers, and in a variety of formats. There will be a first edition of each, which the publisher may cite on the copyright page, such as: "First mass market paperback edition". The first edition of a facsimile reprint is the reprint publisher's first edition, but not the first edition of the work itself.

The Independent Online Booksellers Association has a [http://www.ioba.org/pages/resources/first-edition-primer/ A First Edition Primer ] which discusses several aspects of identifying first editions including publishing and specific publishers way of designating first editions.

===Bibliographical definition===
The classic explanation of edition was given by [[Fredson Bowers]] in ''Principles of Bibliographical Description'' (1949). Bowers wrote that an edition is “the whole number of copies printed at any time or times from substantially the same setting of type-pages,” including “all issues and variant states existing within its basic type-setting, as well as all impressions.”

Publishers often use the same typesetting for the [[hardcover]] and [[Paperback#Trade paperback|trade paperback]] versions of a book. These books have different covers, the [[title page]] and copyright page may differ, and the page margin sizes may differ (same ''type area'', smaller ''trim''), but to a bibliographer they are the same edition.

From time to time, readers may observe an error in the text (or, in the days of metal type, a piece of broken type), and report these to the publisher. The publisher typically keeps these "reprint corrections" in a file pending demand for a new print run of the edition, and before the new run is printed, they will be entered.

The method of entry, obviously, depends on the method of typesetting. For [[Letterpress printing|letterpress metal]], it typically meant resetting a few characters or a line or two. For [[Linotype machine|linotype]], it meant casting a new line for any line with a change in it. With film, it involved cutting out a bit of the film and inserting a new bit. In an electronic file, it means entering the changes digitally.

Such minor changes do not constitute a new edition, but introduce typographical variations within an edition, which are of interest to collectors.

===Collectors' definition===
[[File:Tristram Shandy First edition spines.jpg|thumb|First editions of [[Laurence Sterne]]'s [[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman|Tristram Shandy]] ]]
A common complaint of book collectors is that the bibliographer's definition is used in a book-collecting context. For example, [[J. D. Salinger]]'s ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'' {{asof|2016|lc=y}} remains in print in hardcover. The type is the same as the 1951 first printing, therefore all hardcover copies are, for the bibliographer, the first edition. Collectors would use the term for the first printing only.

First edition most often refers to the first commercial publication of a work between its own covers, even if it was first printed in a periodical: the complete text of [[Ernest Hemingway]]’s ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]'' appeared in the September 1, 1952 issue of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', yet the generally accepted “first” edition is the hardcover book [[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner]]’s published on September 8, 1952.

The term "first trade edition," refers to the earliest edition of a book offered for sale to the general public in book stores. For example, [[Upton Sinclair]]'s 1906 novel ''[[The Jungle]]'' was published in two variant forms. A "Sustainers' Edition", published by the Jungle Publishing Company, was sent to subscribers who had advanced funds to Sinclair. The first trade edition was published by [[Doubleday, Page]] to be sold in bookstores.

Many book collectors place maximum value on the earliest bound copies of a book—promotional [[advance copy|advance copies]], bound galleys, uncorrected proofs, and advance reading copies sent by publishers to book reviewers and [[bookstore|booksellers]]. It is true that these are rarer than the production copies; but given that these were not printed from a different setting of type (just the opposite; the main purpose of galleys and proofs is to double-check the typeset matter that will be used for production), they are not different editions.

===Publishers' definitions===
Publishers use "first edition" according to their own purposes, and consequently among them the designation is used very inconsistently. The "first edition" of a trade book may be the first iteration of the work printed by the publisher in question or the first iteration of the work that includes a specific set of illustrations or editorial commentary.

Publishers of non-fiction, academic works, and [[textbook]]s generally distinguish between revisions of the text of the work, by typically citing the dates of the first and latest editions of the work in the copyright page. Exceptions to this [[rule of thumb]] include denominating as a "second edition" a new textbook that has a different format, title, and/or author(s) because a previous textbook that shares only the same subject matter as the "second edition" is considered the first edition. The reason for this stretch of the definition is often for the short-term marketing advantage of the new textbook, because, although first editions are often considered more valuable than later editions to book collectors, being a subsequent edition of a previous textbook gives the impression that the textbook denominated as a subsequent edition is more authoritative.

==Other types of editions==

=== Revised edition ===
Publishers sometimes denominate a new iteration of a work a "revised edition" or the "(N)th edition, revised" when the previous iteration has been editorially revised or updated yet the author or publisher does not want to denominate it the "(N+1)th edition" ("N" being the number of the previous edition) for some subjective reason. Conversely, a new iteration of a work that is not substantially different may be denominated a "new edition" or the "(N+1)th edition".

The qualitative difference between a "revised edition" and a "new edition" is subjective. This is analogous to the way that software publishers may denominate an iteration "version 3.7" and the subsequent updated iteration "version 4" instead of "version 3.8". The subjective judgment of the ''degree'' of [[Software versioning#Change significance|the significance of the change]] made with the new iteration or the perceived marketing advantage of designating the new iteration as a specific number determines how the new iteration is numbered.

Therefore, the designation "revised edition" does not designate any quality or quantity of revision with certainty.

===Revised and updated edition===
When a non-fiction book is first published it sometimes instigates more research on its subject. The author may determine that new information justifies the revision of the book. A new iteration of the book would be published as a new edition, which may be denominated a "revised and updated edition". However, as with the denomination of "revised edition", the use of "revised and updated edition" manifests only the subjective choice of the publisher, which may be different from the publisher of a previous "revised edition" of the same work.

=== Co-edition &lt;!-- Section linked from Horus Heresy (novels) --&gt; ===
The basic definition of a ''co-edition'' is when two publishing houses publish the same edition of a book (or equivalent versions of an edition, for example, translated versions), simultaneously or near-simultaneously, usually in different countries. English and American editions may [[American and British English spelling differences|differ in spelling]], and they [[list of works with different titles in the United Kingdom and United States|sometimes have different titles]]. Some examples:
* An English-language edition, from the same plates, films, or files, may be published in different anglophone countries by different publishing companies. For example, Arms &amp; Armour Press in the UK and Stackpole Books in the U.S. published co-editions of various monographs on military matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Leventhal|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* A French-language novel published in France this year by a French publisher could become an English-language translation published in the U.S. next year by a U.S. publisher.

The logic of co-editions has often been to use the existing distribution systems of the different publishers in each country rather than establishing new distribution systems.

Advancing [[Information technology|IT]] and the globalization of publishing have been blurring the lines of what ''co-edition'' means. For example, anything published online is effectively published worldwide. Also, large multinational publishers now have existing distribution systems for their hardcopy books in many countries, so they don't need to partner with other companies. They may issue a book under a different imprint for each country, but the imprints are parts of the same parent corporation. The actual manufacturing of the books may be done in China regardless of where the copies will be sold.

=== e-dition ===
The term ''e-dition'', a play on the [[Internet-related prefixes#"E-"|''e-''for-electronic prefix]], has been used by various publishers to refer to various ideas, which include:
* The hardcopy book's content posted online, fully searchable
* Supplemental online-only content for buyers of the hardcopy book
* Online-only publishing (no hardcopy distribution)
* Proprietary-format digital publication ([[e-book]]s) for use in specialized hardware for reading the book ([[e-book reader]]s)

===Library edition===
A library edition may appear to be the same as copies appearing in shops and almost certainly uses the same setting. However, the binding and hinges are made extra strong to allow for the greater wear and tear in library books. This is analogous to the "police and taxi" packages for automobiles, in which heavier brakes and other upgrades are made to withstand harsher-than-standard use and longer [[duty cycle]]s.

===Book club edition===
A popular book is sometimes re-issued under the imprint of a [[Book sales club|book club]]. Often it is a new setting and with cheaper paper and binding. Any photographic illustrations in the original are either absent or reduced in number. Book club editions are sold to members at a good discount compared with the original issue price.

===Cheap edition===
After a book has exhausted the market at the high original price a publisher may issue a cheap edition themselves or sell the rights on to another publisher who will produce the book. A cheap edition typically uses a low-cost paper and is a paperback but they can be hardback. Also typically the size of the font is reduced to fit more words on a page to reduce the overall cost of the book. Naturally, for a cheap edition the author will receive a lower royalty but that may be compensated for by a greater volume of sales.

===Colonial edition===

During the peak of the [[British Empire]], cheap editions of novels published in Britain would often be produced for sale in the colonies before other editions of the books were sold. The rationale was that books took a long time to export to the colonies, that readership in those settlements was avid, and that books were an effective means to disseminate British values. Australia was by far the largest consumer of colonial editions. [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] (London) published the largest number of colonial edition titles. They began in 1843 and persisted (in terms of pricing and trade) until the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Graeme Johanson, ''A study of colonial editions in Australia, 1843-1972''. Elibank Press, Wellington, New Zealand. {{ISBN|0958349630}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cadet edition===
A cadet edition is a cut down version of a book which is more simply written. It is intended for young readers rather than adults.

===Large print edition===
These editions are typically library editions but the font size of the text is much larger than usual so that persons with poor eyesight (often older persons) can more easily read the book. The [[large print]] books tend to be of a uniform size.

===Critical edition===
A critical edition is a scholarly publication, containing commentary, critique, and sometimes a full developmental history of the work from all available sources.

== Printing, print run, impression, et cetera ==
&lt;!-- This heading is the target of multiple anchor-linked redirects: [[Print run]], [[Printing run]], [[Impression (book)]], [[Impression (books)]], [[Impression (publishing)]], and [[Press run]]. --&gt;
&lt;!--This section is linked from [[Krishnamurti's Notebook#Publication history]] [[The First and Last Freedom#Publication history]] ([[MOS:HEAD]]).--&gt;
A batch of identical copies of an iteration/edition of a work that is printed in the same, single execution of the production set-up is denominated a "print run", "printing run", "printing", "impression", or "press run" according to the subjective choice of the publisher. All these denominations denote the action of applying pressure to paper in order to produce the book, and therefore are interchangeable. One edition of a work may have any number of printings, e. g. first edition, first impression; first edition, second impression; and second edition, first impression. Books that sell poorly may have only one. Very successful books may have 50 or more. If present, the [[printer's key]] in the copyright page of a book can be used to identify the number of the printing in which it was produced. In [[printmaking]], however, an "impression" only denotes an individual copy of a specific printing of the work.

A publisher hopes to recoup a large amount of the initial costs of publishing a book from the sale of the copies/impressions produced in the first printing of the book. A variety of commercial and logistic factors are thus considered in deciding the number of books to be produced in a specific printing and their individual price.

Demand for additional printings after the first is always hoped for, because they increase a book's profitability. Once the [[fixed costs]] of developing, editing, typesetting, etc. have been covered by the revenue of the first sales, any additional revenue tends to add to the profit margin, minus, of course, the costs of the additional materials, printing, binding, and distribution.

Sometimes a printing will be unsatisfactory for various reasons, especially printings of artistic and photography books in which the quality of reproduction is paramount. A defective printing is usually destroyed by being [[Pulping|pulped]], yet occasionally a defective printing is shipped to a distant overseas market and there sold cheaply, contingent on the costs of shipping.

If sales of a book do not meet expectations, the remaining stock of a printing will be [[Remaindered book|remaindered]]. When all copies/impressions of a printing are sold, the book is either [[reprint]]ed or becomes [[out of print]]. Some [[print on demand]] and [[e-book]] publishers keep all their books perpetually "in print".

A "second" is an imperfect or damaged copy/impression which is set aside from the other copies/impressions of a printing. These will usually have their [[dust jacket]] clipped or marked in some way to designate their inferiority.

Sometimes readers may observe an error in the text of a book and report it to the publisher. The publisher usually records these '''reprint corrections''' in a file pending demand for a new printing, before which they are incorporated into the revised text. This is one of the factors that inserts the "substantially" into the definition of "substantially the same setting of type".

== Republication == &lt;!-- Courtesy note per [[WP:RSECT]]: [[Republication]] redirects here. --&gt;
Many commercially successful books have been republished, either by their original or other imprints. For this reason if a popular book is searched for in a large bookseller such as [[Amazon.com]] or a large library catalog such as WorldCat, often an array of different copyright years, publishers, editions, formats (hardcover, softcover, trade, and mass market), and so forth are observed. Because no universal authority or convention determines the exact distinction between a "reprinting" and "republishing" and whether a republishing is a different "edition", the denotation of such denominations is ambiguous, at least at first glance.

==Legal status==

===UK===
Since 1956, typographical arrangements of published editions are protected by copyright law. ''[[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]]'' defines a published edition to mean ''a published edition of the whole or any part of one or more literary, dramatic or musical works''.{{efn|Duration [[Directive (European Union)|Directive of the EU]] permits member states to create a publishers' right in critical and scientific works which have fallen into the [[public domain]].}}

It thus protects the publisher's investment in typesetting, as well as the processes of design and selection that are reflected in the appearance of the text.{{efn|See ''[[Newspaper Licensing Agency]] v. [[Marks &amp; Spencer]]'' [2000].}} It also covers modern editions of public domain works (such as the complete works of Shakespeare), and prohibits the reproduction of the layout (but not the work itself).

Her music, frequently inspired by folklore and the natural world has been commissioned and performed around the world. She is a member of the Scottish Music Centre&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scottishmusiccentre.com/emily-doolittle/|title=Emily Doolittle|website=www.scottishmusiccentre.com|access-date=2018-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Canadian Music Centre&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.musiccentre.ca/node/37657/showcase|title=Emily Doolittle|website=www.musiccentre.ca|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

== Life and work ==
Emily grew up in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]]. She studied at [[Dalhousie University]], the [[Royal Conservatory of The Hague|Koninklijk Conservatorium]] in the Hague, (where she studied with [[Louis Andriessen]] with the support of a Fulbright Fellowship), [[Indiana University]] and [[Princeton University]]. From 2008-2015 she was an Associate Professor of Music at the [[Cornish College of the Arts]] in Seattle. 

Emily has an interest in [[zoomusicology]] (the study of animal and human song) and the natural world. She has explored this in a number of works, her doctoral dissertation at Princeton and as a part of interdisciplinary birdsong research conducted alongside biologists and ornithologists. Together with cognitive biologist [[W. Tecumseh Fitch]], Bruno Gingras and Dominik Endres, she discovered that [[hermit thrush]] song follows the [[overtone series]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pnas.org/content/111/46/16616 | title=Overtone-based pitch selection in hermit thrush song: Unexpected convergence with scale construction in human music (PNAS)|work=pnas.org |access-date=2018-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Of the development of her passion for bird and animal song, she has said: "I was studying at the Koninklijk Conservatorium in the Hague when a bird woke me up one morning. It sounded like human music and aroused my interest in animal song."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/real-life-doctor-dolittle-sings-10655267|title='Real life Doctor Dolittle' sings to seals and turns their howls into music|last=Greenaway|first=Heather|date=2017-06-21|work=dailyrecord|access-date=2018-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other predominant themes in her music include story-telling, music with and/or for children and folklore. Her chamber opera ''Jan Tait and the Bear'' was awarded a 2016 Opera America Discovery Grant&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://operaamerica.org/Content/About/PressRoom/2016/04202016.aspx|title=Opera America Announces Recipients of Opera Grants for Female Composers|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was selected for performance at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] as part of the 2018 Made in Scotland Showcase&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.madeinscotlandshowcase.com/shows/jan-tait-and-bear | title=Jan Tait and the Bear &amp;#124; Made in Scotland|access-date=2018-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Her work has received numerous awards, including the 2012 Theodore Front Prize&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elizabethbishopcentenary.blogspot.com/2012/07/emily-doolittle-wins-theodore-front.html | title=Emily Doolittle wins Theodore Front Prize for "A short slow life"| date=2012-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; for ''A Short, Slow Life'', two [[ASCAP]] Morton Gold Awards, the [[Joseph H.

An '''exclosure''', in an area being used extensively for grazing, is a limited area from which unwanted animals, for example browsing animals, such as domestic [[cattle]] or wildlife, such as [[deer]], are excluded by fencing or other means.  Exclosures are sometimes constructed by government agencies that manage livestock use on public lands—a practice in which private owners of cattle pay, though often only a nominal sum, for the right to graze their livestock on the public lands.

One purpose of the exclosure is to determine how the area would develop (in [[biodiversity]], vegetation height, [[ecology|ecological]] characteristics, etc.) if grazing were not conducted.

Another purpose is to demarcate an area safe for humans by excluding potentially deadly animals.  For example, a beach may have a shark net around it to prevent sharks from attacking human swimmers.  Another example is at wild animal preserves which provide fenced in areas for humans to safely watch lions, tigers, or other large predators.

'''Exoticism''' (from 'exotic') is a trend in European art and design, whereby artists became fascinated with ideas and styles from distant regions, and drew inspiration from them. This often involved surrounding foreign cultures with mystique and fantasy which owed more to European culture than to the exotic cultures themselves: this process of glamorisation and stereotyping is called 'exoticization'.

==History of exoticism==

First stimulated by Eastern trade in the 16th and 17th centuries, interest in non-western (particularly "Oriental", i.e. Middle Eastern or Asian) art by Europeans became more and more popular following [[European colonialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oshinsky|first=Sara J.|title=Exoticism in the Decorative Arts|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/exot/hd_exot.htm|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The influences of Exoticism can be seen through numerous genres of this period, notably in music, painting, and decorative art. In music, exoticism is a genre in which the rhythms, melodies, or instrumentation are designed to evoke the atmosphere of far-off lands or ancient times (e.g. [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel's]] ''[[Daphnis et Chloé]]'' and ''Tzigane for Violin and Orchestra'',  [[Claude Debussy|Debussy's]] ''Syrinx for Flute Solo'' or [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov's]] ''[[Capriccio espagnol]]''). Like orientalist subjects in 19th-century painting, exoticism in the decorative arts and interior decoration was associated with fantasies of opulence.

Exoticism, by one definition, is "the charm of the unfamiliar". Scholar [[Alden Jones]] defines exoticism in art and literature as the representation of one culture for consumption by another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmartset.com/article/article08060708.aspx|title=This Is Not a Cruise|author=Alden Jones|date=August 6, 2007|publisher=The Smart Set}}&lt;/ref&gt; Victor Segalen's important "Essay on Exoticism" reveals Exoticism as born of the age of imperialism, possessing both aesthetic and ontological value, while using it to uncover a significant cultural "otherness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Segalen|first=Victor|title=Essay on Exoticism: An Aesthetics of Diversity|year=2002|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important and archetypical exoticist is the artist and writer [[Paul Gauguin]], whose visual representations of [[Tahiti]]an people and landscapes were targeted at a French audience. While exoticism is closely linked to [[Orientalism]], it is not a movement necessarily associated with a particular time period or culture. Exoticism may take the form of [[primitivism]], [[ethnocentrism]], or humanism.

Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres (29 August 1780 – 14 January 1867) was a French Neoclassical painter. The revival of ancient Greek and Roman art left behind the Academy’s emphasis on naturalism, and incorporated a new found idealism not seen since the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Herbert|first=Robert|title=Art, Leisure, and Parisian Society|journal=Art Journal|year=1990|volume=49|issue=1|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As classicism progressed, Ingres identified a newfound idealism and exoticism in his work. The Grand Odalisque, finished in 1814, was created to arouse the male view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carter|first=Karen|title=The Spectatorship of the Affiche Illustrée and the Modern City of Paris, 1880-1900|journal=Journal of Design History|year=2012|volume=25|issue=1|page=24|doi=10.1093/jdh/epr044}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The notion of the exotic figure furthers Ingres’ use of symmetry and line by enabling the eye to cohesively move across the canvas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chu|first=Petra|title=Nineteenth-Century European Art|year=2011|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=New Jersey|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Ingres’ intention was to make the woman beautiful in his work, his model was a courtesan, which arouse debate.

Édouard Manet’s [[Olympia (Manet)|Olympia]], finished in 1863, was based on Titian’s Venus of Urbino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chu|first=Petra|title=Nineteenth Century European Art|year=2011|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=New Jersey|page=233}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Olympia was a popular play about a courtesan called Olympia. This subject was extremely controversial for an artist to portray a woman like this because of traditional vision of the Academy.  Manet was being very different from the accepted academic style by outlining and flattening space that created a distortion of classical elements. Olympia is provocative in her nudity that implies she is naked, not nude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chu|first=Petra|title=Nineteenth Century European Art|year=2011|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=New Jersey|page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She is looking out in a very confrontational way, and setting the viewer as a man coming to the prostitute, although Olympia’s hand suggests she is not ready to engage with the customer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chu|first=Petra|title=Nineteenth Century European Art|year=2011|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=New Jersey|page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The African servant calls on racism and slavery in France, because showing someone of color participating in French life was unheard of, furthering the work's exotic nature.

'''National Financial Literacy Month''' is recognized in the United States in April in an effort to highlight the importance of [[financial literacy]] and teach Americans how to establish and maintain healthy financial habits.&lt;ref&gt;Senate Resolution 316; sponsored by Sen. Daniel Akaka D-HI&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, The National Endowment for Financial Education introduced Youth Financial Literacy Day and turned it over to the Jump$tart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy so that the event would not promote any one organization and instead focus on financial literacy as a whole. The Jump$tart Coalition and its approximately 150 partners expanded the event to a month.
  
In 2003, the [[United States Senate]] designated April as ''Financial Literacy for Youth Month''. In March 2004 the Senate passed Resolution 316 that officially recognized April as ''National Financial Literacy Month''.

Many{{Weasel-inline|date=May 2010}} of the country’s [[financial institutions]] and [[nonprofit]] financial educational organizations promote the month{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} by holding promotional events and creating educational materials that center around effectively handling money and dealing with debt.

==Educational initiatives==
{{see also|Financial Literacy Curriculum}}
[[Money Management International]], a nonprofit credit and debt counseling firm, created a [[microsite]] to support the mission of National Financial Literacy Month, with a step by step process for improving financial wellness.

==Government support==
In 2003 the [[United States Congress]] showed its support for the idea of a financial literacy month. Senate Resolution 48 and House Resolution 127 asked President [[George W. Bush]] to declare April Financial Literacy for Youth Month. At that time, governors of eight states had already named the month of April as such.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jumpstartcoalition.org/fileuptemp/AprilFinancialLiteracyMonth.doc&lt;/ref&gt; April was named National Financial Literacy Month by the passing of Senate Resolution 316 with [[unanimous consent]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jumpstartcoalition.org/fileuptemp/AprilFinancialLiteracyMonth.doc and http://www.jumpstartcoalition.org/fileuptemp/FINAL%20PR%202004%20Legislator%20Award.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2005, the [[United States House of Representatives]] passed a bill supporting the goals and ideals of Financial Literacy Month.&lt;ref name=2005house&gt;http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:HE00148:@@@L&amp;summ2=m&amp;&lt;/ref&gt;  This bill, and the resolution passed by the Senate, called on President Bush to issue a proclamation calling on Federal Government, States, localities, schools, nonprofit organizations business and the people of the United States to observe the month with appropriate programs and activities.&lt;ref name=2005house/&gt; During his term in office, President Bush did not issue a proclamation.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

During Financial Literacy Month in 2006, The [[Financial Literacy and Education Commission]] unveiled a new national strategy in their report "Taking Ownership of the Future: The National Strategy for Financial Literacy". The report outlined a series of outreach and education goals for the public and private sectors aimed to help Americans improve their understanding of financial issues such as credit management, savings, and homeownership.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mymoney.gov/pdfs/ownership.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the years, multiple states have also proclaimed April as Financial Literacy Month including [http://www.cscuf.coop/repository/arkansas+proclamation.pdf Arkansas], [http://www.cscuf.coop/repository/Oklahoma+April+Proclamation+optimized.pdf Oklahoma], [http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billInfo/billInfo.cfm?sYear=2017&amp;sInd=0&amp;body=H&amp;type=R&amp;bn=0777 Pennsylvania], and [http://www.cscuf.coop/repository/Texas+April+Proclamation.pdf Texas].

==Financial Literacy Month in Canada==
Differing from the US, November is Canada’s Financial Literacy Month. The month is organized by the Financial Literacy Action Group (FLAG), a coalition of 7 non-profit organizations who work with the federal government body [[Financial Consumer Agency of Canada]] (FCAC).

Throughout November FLAG organizes events across Canada to educate and engage with the public regarding the need for financial literacy and promote services available to the public: 
“[FLAG] raises awareness of the need for financial literacy and highlights the programs, services and tools available to help Canadians improve their financial knowledge, skills and confidence.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.financialliteracymonth.ca/en/about-flm&lt;/ref&gt;”

The purpose of this month is to educate the public so Canadians are equipped to:

- Provide for themselves and their family

- Invest in their future and the future of their children

- Understand their financial rights and obligations

- Contribute to the community as a good citizen

Similar to the United States, many of the country’s [[financial institutions]] (such as Planswell, Wealthsimple, RBC) and [[nonprofit]] financial educational organizations promote the month by creating educational material and hosting promotional events that center around topics of personal finances.

'''Food for the Hungry''' (also known as FH) is an international relief and development organization with operations in more than 20 countries. Food for the Hungry was founded in 1971 by Dr. Larry Ward.&lt;ref name="ECFA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecfa.org/MemberProfile.aspx?ID=5160 |title=Food for the Hungry (Accredited Organization Profile) |publisher=ECFA.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Food for the Hungry's stated mission is "to walk with leaders, churches and families in overcoming all forms of human poverty by living in healthy relationship with [[God]] and His creation"&lt;ref name="Vision"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fh.org/about/vision |title=About &amp;#124; Vision and Mission &amp;#124; Food for the Hungry |publisher=Fh.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which was taken from [[Book of Psalms]] 146:7 He upholds the cause of the oppressed and gives food to the hungry. Food for the Hungry is a charter member of the [[Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability]], since February 1, 1980.&lt;ref name="ECFA" /&gt;

== History ==
Larry Ward founded the organization in 1971, with offices in [[Southern California]]. He moved the offices to [[Arizona]] in 1974. Early projects included helping [[refugees]] in war-torn [[Bangladesh]], victims of the [[1972 Nicaragua earthquake]], rescuing Vietnamese "[[boat people]]" from the [[South China Sea]], and helping hungry and needy people in [[Haiti]] and West Africa. The child sponsorship program was started in 1978. Hunger Corps, the people-sending division of Food for the Hungry, began in 1979.

Dr. Larry Ward retired as president of both the U.S. fundraising office and the international implementation arm of Food for the Hungry in 1984. He was succeeded by [[Ted Yamamori]], Ph.D. As a young child, Yamamori had his own near-starvation experience at the end of [[World War II]] in [[Japan]]. He survived, thanks to the kindness of strangers. Dr. Yamamori retired in 2001, at which point two people were hired to replace him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.missionfrontiers.org/issue/article/feeding-the-hungry|title=Feeding the Hungry Dr. Tetsunao Yamamori &amp; Food for the Hungry|publisher=Mission Frontiers|accessdate=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Randall Hoag was appointed president of Food for the Hungry International, and Benjamin K. Homan was appointed president of Food for the Hungry/U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://global.christianpost.com/news/food-for-the-hungry-phoenix-officials-assess-relief-programs-in-indonesia-15685/ |title=Food For The Hungry, Phoenix Officials Assess Relief Programs in Indonesia |publisher=Global.christianpost.com |date=2005-05-18 |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2006, FH has consolidated its U.S. and international operations, led by President/CEO Gary Edmonds.

=== Evolution of FH's work ===
When Larry Ward founded FH, it was the result of his hurting heart for the 12,000 children who were then dying of hunger related causes.&lt;ref name="Policy Innovations"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.policyinnovations.org/ideas/innovations/data/food_hungry |title=The Food for the Hungry Story |publisher=Policyinnovations.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The predominant relief theory of the day was that poverty was caused by a lack of resources, so providing resources was the solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://askquestions.tv/category/speakers/keith-wright/ |title=Keith Wright - Redux |publisher=Askquestions.tv |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ward left his position as executive vice president and overseas director at [[World Vision]] in 1970&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/world-vision-international-inc |title=World Vision International, Inc.: Information from |publisher=Answers.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and headed out to help impoverished people by taking to Haiti resources he had purchased with his personal credit card.&lt;ref name="Policy Innovations" /&gt;

FH's first official response was to help returnees of war in the newly forming nation of [[Bangladesh]] (formerly [[East Pakistan]]) in 1971. The focus on relief operations continued into the late 1970s, although many of those countries became areas where FH helped the people recover through long-term development projects.

|-
| 1976 || Guatemala || Earthquake victims
|-
| 1978 || Philippines || Refugees of war

Beginning in 1978, FH began to more intentionally increase its development work. This is when FH first began working in countries without first responding to a humanitarian disaster, through its [[child sponsorship]] program. The child sponsorship&lt;ref name="ECFA" /&gt; program was launched in 1978 in [[Bolivia]], [[Guatemala]] and [[Philippines]]. Additional fields that were added in the 1980s included [[Peru]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Mozambique]] and [[Uganda]].

|-
| FHDR || Haiti border

|-

|}

Throughout the early 1990s, a greater emphasis on the community began to emerge as the focus for development. At the same time, conflicts such as [[terrorism]], [[genocide]] and communist rebel activity were on the rise. FH developed a concise set of development principles focused on transforming communities by working closely with the churches, leaders and families. Over time, new and existing areas of operation would increasingly focus on addressing the whole of the community as an essential approach to serving the most vulnerable. Several fields of operation were added in the 1990s under this principle.

The first ten years of the 21st century would prove to be challenging yet provide new opportunities to adapt to developing global realities. Challenges came through several major emergencies that were added to the ongoing issues of hunger, poverty, HIV/AIDS and war.&lt;ref name="Fex profile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fex.ennonline.net/5/agencyprofile |title=Food for the Hungry &amp;#124; ENN |publisher=Fex.ennonline.net |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1997 FH began implementing the innovative model of Cascade Groups into their developmental structure and programming. They have since been considered a leader and expert in the facilitation of these groups through their diligence and successful execution.

Cascade Groups uses of the idea of [[social networking]] to work in communities. Within this model, groups of 10-15 community-based [[volunteering|volunteers]] educate their neighbors about health issues. The volunteer educators regularly meet together with FH staff for training and supervision. Each of the volunteers meets regularly with 10-15 of her neighbors to share what she has learned and to facilitate behavior change at the household level. This not only creates a multiplying effect, but it also provides the structure for a community health information system that reports on new pregnancies, births and deaths.

Since the Cascade Group model was first pioneered, it has been used by 20 (and counting) other Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) in more than 20 countries, largely through the support of the [[U.S. Agency for International Development]]. In particular, the USAID Child Survival and Health Grants Program and the USAID [[Food for Peace]] (Title II Food Security) Program have helped to fund programs using the Cascade Group model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caregroupinfo.org/blog/criteria |title=Definition &amp; Criteria |publisher=Care Group Info |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Implementation of Child-focused Community Transformation (CFCT) in the 2010s'''

FH developed the concept of CFCT between 2005 and 2011 and officially launched CFCT as a unified model for community transformation with child-focused outcomes at the center of field implementation and the organization's strategic plan. Since September 2011, CFCT has formed the base of all Food for the Hungry program models. A core component of Food for the Hungry's mission is to "focus on the most vulnerable," with children believed to be the most prominent and vulnerable members of the communities Food for the Hungry serves. Child-focused does not mean that all development activity is centered solely on children, since children are supported and cared for by their families and community leaders. Therefore, the majority of CFCT activities are focused on strengthening families, the church, and community leaders. "Transformation" encompasses the process of radical change in behaviors, attitudes, beliefs, and worldviews of individuals, communities, and cultures toward living in healthy relationship with God, others, themselves, and creation (Four Key Relationships).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Myers|first1=Bryant L.|title=Walking with the poor : principles and practices of transformational development|date=2011|publisher=Orbis Books|location=Maryknoll, N.Y.|isbn=978-1570759390}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "transformational development" refers to the work that Food for the Hungry staff and community members do to achieve mutual transformation and advance and accelerate measurable well-being improvements for the most vulnerable.

=== Organizational Structure ===
Food for the Hungry, Inc. (FH/US) was incorporated by Larry Ward in the United States in 1971 and has existed continuously since then. Ward incorporated Food for the Hungry International (FHI) in [[Geneva]], Switzerland, in 1980. FHI was part of Ward's dream to implement unified relief and development programs worldwide through an international partnership of supporting national organizations (NOs) or affiliates.

FH/US became a supporting NO for FHI, along with like NOs in Japan (established in 1981), [[Canada]] (established in 1988), [[Sweden]] (established in 1988), [[Switzerland]] (established in 1988), [[Korea]] (established in 1989), [[United Kingdom]] (established in 1989) and a second organization in the United States, Korea-American Food for the Hungry International (established in 2002).&lt;ref name="Fex profile" /&gt;

In 2006, FH restructured to align operations with NOs in Canada, Switzerland, Sweden, United Kingdom and United States as members of FH Association (FHA), which was registered in Switzerland in November 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpplatform.ch/pbguide/organisation/food-hungry-association-fh |title=Food for the Hungry Association (FH) &amp;#124; GPPlatform |publisher=Gpplatform.ch |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan and Korea aligned as Food for the Hungry International Federation (FHF) and, though loosely affiliated as members of a larger FHI "family," operate separately from FHA.&lt;ref&gt;https://vocf.net/uploaded_project/fhifdir07.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

FH is the umbrella for all FHA NOs and relief and development fields. Field work occurs primarily in Asia, Africa, Central America, South America and the Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fh.org/work/countries |title=Work &amp;#124; Countries &amp;#124; Food for the Hungry |publisher=Fh.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; NOs support this work by raising funds, supplying human resources and helping to design and evaluate field programs.

FH is governed by a unified Board of Directors providing direct oversight of FHA and FH/US&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fh.org/about/leadership/board |title=Food for the Hungry |publisher=Fh.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is led by President/CEO Gary Edmonds.

== Biblical Holism ==

A [[Christian worldview|biblical worldview]] is both a foundation and umbrella for FH's work. Food for the Hungry's Statement of Faith&lt;ref name="Vision" /&gt; corresponds to the Statement of Faith of the [[National Association of Evangelicals]] (NAE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nae.net/about-us/statement-of-faith |title=Statement of Faith |publisher=Nae.net |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FH functions on the belief that poverty is the result of broken relationships: (1) between humans and humans, (2) between humans and creation and (3) between humans and God,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.fh.org/2012/08/biblical-worldview/ |title=Biblical Worldview: Both a Foundation and an Umbrella - Food for the Hungry Blog |publisher=Blog.fh.org |date=2012-08-17 |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that restoring these relationships in a holistic way is the key to overcoming poverty.

FH is not affiliated with any specific church or denomination, and its work is available to the world's most vulnerable people, regardless of race, gender or religion. While staff do not proselytize (use religious coercion or require a beneficiary to listen to a religious message before receiving help), biblical values infuse FH programs by promoting concepts that mend the broken relationships that result in poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/organizations/food-for-the-hungry |title=Food for the Hungry |publisher=Berkleycenter.georgetown.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The global FH partnership is committed to transformational development. This requires walking with churches, leaders and families to help them identify and overcome the issues that lock them in poverty. One of these issues is fatalistic worldviews that steal people's hope.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130215215831/http://dinkumfiles.com/2009/07/07/eastern-university-to-host-transformational-development-conference-august-7th-9th/ ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many organizations acknowledge that faith can be vital in development, including the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usaid.gov/work-usaid/partnership-opportunities/faith-based-community-organizations/history |title=Partnership Opportunities &amp;#124; U.S. Agency for International Development |publisher=Usaid.gov |date=2014-07-18 |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Heartbeat ===
In 2014, Food for the Hungry created a revised version of their "Vision, Mission, and Values" called "The Heartbeat of FH." The heartbeat is the values and principles that guide and shape the organization and is composed of values, vision, and purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fh.org/about/values-vision-purpose/|title=FH Values, Mission, and Purpose|last=|first=|date=|website=Food for the Hungry|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Values'''
# We follow Jesus. ''We are ambassadors of Jesus in our thoughts, words, and deeds''.
# Our work is relational. ''We pursue reconciled relationships of grace with those with whom we work, partner, and serve.'' 
# We invest wisely and focus on results. ''We are stewards in God's kingdom and strive to invest all resources to maximize missional impact.'' 
# We serve with humility. ''We recognize the dignity of others and put their interests above our own.''
# We pursue beauty, goodness, and truth. ''We pursue beauty, goodness, and truth.'' 
'''Vision'''

''All forms of human poverty ended worldwide.''

'''Purpose'''

''Together we follow God's call responding to human suffering and graduating communities from extreme poverty.''

== Examples of International Impact ==

=== The Democratic Republic of the Congo ===
FH installed a community water pump in Kamalenge. The community uses the water pump for farming and personal use. Since installation, the water management committee in Kamalenge has managed the water pump. FH also helped families in [[Kateba]] learn about health and nutrition through songs and flipcharts. Villages that FH was able to work in are now free of malnutrition. FH also helped to build a seed multiplication station in Emilingombre so farmers would have more direct access to seeds and seedlings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.usaid.gov/2012/08/a-lasting-impact-on-food-security/ |title=A Lasting Impact on Food Security &amp;#124; USAID Impact |publisher=Blog.usaid.gov |date=2012-08-07 |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Haiti and the Dominican Republic ===
In 2012, when [[Hurricane Isaac (2012)]] hit [[Haiti]] and the [[Dominican Republic]], FH staff helped families who lost homes, animals and crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Evans |first=Dave |url=http://blogs.christianpost.com/food-for-the-hungry/when-the-spotlight-on-disasters-fade-the-work-goes-on-11820/ |title=When the Spotlight on Disasters Fade, the Work Goes on &amp;#124; Food for the Hungry |publisher=Blogs.christianpost.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethiopia ===
Among several other countries, Food for the Hungry offers child sponsorships to children in [[Ethiopia]]. Sponsoring children in Ethiopia provides children with food, medical care, and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Evans |first=Dave |url=http://blogs.christianpost.com/food-for-the-hungry/bringing-hope-to-the-hard-places-11847// |title=Bringing Hope to the Hard Places &amp;#124; Food for the Hungry |publisher=Blogs.christianpost.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2011, FH reached approximately 84,652 households in Ethiopia. In addition to their work with families, FH helped 180,456 farmers improve access to markets due to road construction and maintenance.&lt;ref name="Foodaid"&gt;[http://foodaid.org/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Food-for-Peace-Mozambique-DRC-Ethiopia-Food-for-the-Hungry.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130722232838/http://foodaid.org/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Food-for-Peace-Mozambique-DRC-Ethiopia-Food-for-the-Hungry.pdf |date=July 22, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Republic of Mozambique ===
Food for the Hungry worked in Mozambique to significantly reduce morbidity and mortality – especially among children 0–23 months of age and pregnant women.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.caregroupinfo.org/docs/FH_Final_Eval_Report_27Dec2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; By 2010, FH helped develop 182 Farmer Field and Life Groups in Mozambique with 3,276 people receiving services. Their efforts have helped impact approximately 111,000 people.&lt;ref name="Foodaid" /&gt;
FH's Mozambique Child Survival Project was called one of the world's best examples of what can be achieved at low cost to improve the health of children in high-mortality, low-resource settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Henry B. Perry|url=http://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/5087/Perry/Henry|website=www.jhsph.edu|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110223401/http://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/5087/Perry/Henry|archivedate=2015-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Funding ==
FH is a charter member in good standing of the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability (ECFA).&lt;ref name="ECFA" /&gt; Their audited financial statement for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2013 shows that 35 percent of funding came from the U.S. government, 62 percent from individuals, 3 percent from churches, businesses, and foundations. Of this funding, 83 percent was used on programs, 11 percent on fundraising and 6 percent on administrative costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://issuu.com/fh_us/docs/2011_annual_report_sm?mode=window&amp;backgroundColor=%23222222 |title=Food for the Hungry 2011 Annual Report by Food for the Hungry |publisher=ISSUU |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Controversy ===
In 2012, Food for the Hungry was one of hundreds of non-profits chosen by the [[IRS]] for a routine audit of their tax return for 2007. They cooperated fully with the IRS. A preliminary letter listed several issues that IRS wanted to clarify. That letter was illegally leaked to the media, launching a media controversy over unconfirmed facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fh.org/gik |title=Gifts-in-Kind &amp;#124; Food for the Hungry |publisher=Fh.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2014, Food for the Hungry received a letter from the IRS. The letter accepted the tax return as originally submitted, and acknowledged that Food for the Hungry had followed all laws and accepted accounting practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wayback Machine|url=https://www.fh.org/images/general/docs/IRS_Audit_Closing_Release_final.pdf|website=www.fh.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505182100/https://www.fh.org/images/general/docs/IRS_Audit_Closing_Release_final.pdf|archivedate=2014-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As charter members of the [[Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability]], Food for the Hungry are in compliance with their Seven Standards of Responsible Stewardship. In addition, the organization has received [https://www.guidestar.org/profile/95-2680390 GuideStar's Platinum Seal of Transparency], which is the highest level of recognition offered by Guidestar to non-profits and charities. 

There are no outstanding issues concerning Food for the Hungry's involvement in issues with the IRS.

== Accomplishments ==
Food for the Hungry's HIV/AIDS prevention and care activities previously were smaller projects compared to its food distribution and development programs. In 2005, FH was awarded an $8.3 million grant through the [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]] (PEPFAR) to expand its prevention programs in [[Ethiopia]], [[Nigeria]], [[Mozambique]] and Haiti. This grant is part of a $100-million pool of PEPFAR abstinence funds awarded by USAID through its [[Abstinence]] and Healthy Choices for Youth program in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Marina Walker Guevaraemail |url=http://www.publicintegrity.org/2006/11/30/6400/food-hungry |title=Food for the Hungry &amp;#124; Center for Public Integrity |publisher=Publicintegrity.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tom Davis, formerly Chief Program Officer for FH, developed the Barrier Analysis methodology earlier in his career and was a pioneer of the Care Group model, which empowers volunteer peer educators to promote life saving behaviors with mothers at the community level. In 2012, while working with FH, his work earned him the [[American Public Health Association]] Gordon-Wyon Award for Excellence in Community-Oriented Public Health, Epidemiology and Practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apha.org/membergroups/sections/aphasections/intlhealth/cbphcw/activities/Gordon+Wyon+Awards.htm |title=Gordon Wyon Awards |publisher=APHA |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[David Evans (administrator)|David Evans]], then U.S. President of Food for the Hungry spoke at the 2012 Faith Suc   vg ncv   n   mmit on AIDS in [[Washington, DC]]. They were recognized for their volunteer efforts like transporting water, washing clothes, bathing those in need, counseling, and praying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Evans |first=Dave |url=http://blogs.christianpost.com/food-for-the-hungry/faith-summit-on-aids-receives-accolades-11034/ |title=Faith Summit on AIDS Receives Accolades &amp;#124; Food for the Hungry |publisher=Blogs.christianpost.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Partnerships ==

=== Sports Initiatives ===
In the 2010s, Food for the Hungry began partnering with several [[Major League Baseball]] players and cultural icons. This culminated in the creation of two sports campaigns, Striking Out Poverty in 2016, which partners with players in the [[MLB]], and FH Champions in 2017, which focuses on partnerships with players in the [[National Football League|NFL]]. Striking Out Poverty (also known as "K Poverty" or "SOP") began with a focus on ending poverty in nine communities in the [[Dominican Republic]], where baseball is the national sport and more than 500 baseball players in the MLB hail from the Dominican Republic. Food for the Hungry's Global Ambassador is [[Roberto Clemente Jr.|Roberto Clemente Jr]]., a former pro baseball player and son of [[Roberto Clemente]], the first Latin American player to compile 3,000 hits in Major League Baseball history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fh.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Roberto-Clemente-Jr-Ambassador.pdf|title=Food for the Hungry Names Roberto Clemente Jr. Global Ambassador|last=|first=|date=March 16, 2017|work=Food for the Hungry|access-date=2017-11-13|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other athletes who have participated in Striking Out Poverty campaigns and vision trips include [[Nick Ahmed]], [[Chase Anderson]], [[Dee Gordon]], [[Yasmani Grandal]], [[Liam Hendriks]], [[Starling Marte]], [[Gregory Polanco]], [[Rob Refsnyder]], [[Moisés Sierra]], [[Adam Wainwright]], and [[Luke Weaver (baseball)|Luke Weaver]]. NFL athletes who have worked with Food for the Hungry formerly as "Pro Player Partners" or as part of Champions by FH include [[Jarvis Jenkins]], [[Jonathan Meeks]], [[Derrick Morgan (American football)|Derrick Morgan]], [[Coty Sensabaugh]], and [[Michael Thomas (defensive back)|Michael Thomas]].

=== Artists and Influencers ===
Food for the Hungry also partners with Christian artists and influencers including [[TobyMac]], [[Lecrae]], [[Switchfoot]], [[Third Day]] and more as part of its Artists Program to promote Food for the Hungry at their concerts and events around the country. Each artists sponsors his or her own child with Food for the Hungry as part of their shared God-given mission with FH to end extreme poverty.

'''Forensic palynology''' is the study of [[pollen]], spores and other acid-resistant microscopic plant bodies, including dinoflagellates, to prove or disprove a relationship between objects, people and places that pertain to both criminal and civil cases. 

Pollen can tell a lot about where a person or object has been, because regions of the world, countries, and even different parts of a garden will have a distinctive pollen assemblage.&lt;ref name="bryant"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Forensic Palynology: A New Way to Catch Crooks | author = Vaughn M.

For instance, a dead body may be found in a wood, and the clothes may contain pollen that was released after death (the time of death can be determined by [[forensic entomology]]), but in a place other than where it was found. That indicates that the body was moved.

==Palynology==
[[Palynology]] is the study of pollen, spores and other microscopic plant bodies such as dinoflagellates (marine algal cysts). Pollen carries the male [[gametes]] (sex cells) of flowering plants and plants that produce cones (e.g. pine trees).  Spores are asexual reproductive bodies of ferns, mosses and fungi.

Palynology is used by geologists to help date rocks for petroleum, mining and water exploration and to help unravel the history of plants on Earth; by geographers to investigate climatic and environmental change: by botanists for plant taxonomy and phylogeny; by immunologist to investigate allergenic pollen; by archaeologists to study the customs, rituals and agricultural practices of ancient peoples; by zoologists and environmental scientists to understand foraging habits of insects, birds and mammals and to investigate past native vegetation and habitats in order to preserve the present and protect endangered species.

The '''Gas Council Engineering Research Station''' was a former engineering [[research institute]] on Tyneside, situated in a distinctively-shaped and listed building, now occupied by the [[North Tyneside|Metropolitan Borough of North Tyneside]]. 

==History==
===Design===
It was designed by Ryder &amp; Yates in 1965, who also designed the [[Television Centre, Newcastle upon Tyne]]. Ryder and Yates had formed in 1953 in Newcastle. It was built under the former [[Northumberland County Council]]. The Northern Gas Board had its main headquarters in Killingworth. It was first announced in November 1965. It was built in anticipation of North Sea gas. Killingworth was a north-east new town, known as Killingworth Township. It was planned to open in the summer of 1968. It was built on the site of [[Killingworth Colliery]]. The modernist architecture is developed from [[Le Corbusier]] and [[Berthold Lubetkin]]. 

===Construction===
It was built from 1966-67 on a 10-acre site. An extension was added from 1975-76 to contain a restaurant. 

It was Grade II listed on 27 January 1997 by [[English Heritage]] ([[Historic England]] since 2015).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1259313 Listing at Historic England]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
It is situated&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1831584 Geograph]&lt;/ref&gt; directly between the B1505 to east and the [[East Coast Main Line]] (ECML) to the west, in the west of Killingworth. Nearby to the south was the former distinctively-designed headquarters, Norgas House, of the [[Northern Gas Board]], also designed by Ryder &amp; Yates, until North Tyneside agreed its demolition in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/local-news/norgas-house-killingworth-set-demolished-1372524 Norgas House demolition 2012 Evening Chronicle]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Block A housed the Engineering Research Station and Block B housed the School of Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://northtyneside-consult.limehouse.co.uk/portal/lp_draft_15?pointId=1392895878394 North Tyneside Enhancing the Built Environment]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
It housed the main research function of British Gas, where the [[National Transmission System]] (NTS) was designed. The research centre's first function was to design the pipeline system around the UK. It researched [[metallurgy]] and pipelines, and avoiding any cracks in the UK's pipelines.

British Gas left the site in 1995 and North Tyneside Council moved in. In 2008, North Tyneside moved most of its functions to Cobalt Park on the [[A19 road|A19]].

'''Gender Through Comic Books''' (also known as #SuperMOOC because of its popular [[hash tag]] on Twitter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/search?q=%23SuperMOOC&amp;src=typd |title=Twitter / Search - #SuperMOOC |publisher=Twitter.com |date= |accessdate=August 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[MOOC]] taught April 2, 2013 through May 18, 2013.

More than 7,000 students enrolled in the April 2013 Gender Through Comic Books course taught by Christina Blanch&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linkedin.com/pub/christina-blanch/48/61/982 |title=Christina Blanch |publisher=LinkedIn |date= |accessdate=August 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Ball State University]] on the Canvas platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.canvas.net/courses/gender-through-comic-books |accessdate=May 19, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130423235716/https://www.canvas.net/courses/gender-through-comic-books |archivedate=April 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Blanch, an anthropologist, thought that "using comic books could be a way to approach teaching gender without the trepidation some students feel"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Knox |first=Kelly |url=https://www.wired.com/geekmom/2013/01/gender-through-comics/ |title=New Online Course Explores Gender Through Comic Books &amp;#124; GeekMom |publisher=Wired.com |date= |accessdate=August 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; when approaching the subject. Students read scholarly articles each week in addition to comics (offered as e-comics by [[Comixology]]),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.comixology.com/mooc&lt;/ref&gt; plus participated in live interviews with comic book creators with questions submitted via Twitter. There has been some controversy over issues of gender and patriarchy related to MOOCS,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historiann.com/2013/05/15/guest-post-on-the-lords-of-mooc-creation-whos-really-for-change-and-who-in-fact-is-standing-athwart-history-yelling-stop/ |title=Guest post on the Lords of MOOC Creation: who’s really for change, and who in fact is standing athwart history yelling STOP? : Historiann : History and sexual politics, 1492 to the present |publisher=Historiann |date= |accessdate=August 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Blanch's class served to break through barriers related to gender, the comics medium, and pedagogy.

The course was divided into six week-long modules and covered the topics of: ''What is gender?'', ''Gender and Culture: How we learn our gender'', ''Who is producing comic book culture?'', ''Femininity'', ''Masculinity'', and ''Gendered Spaces and Consuming Comics''.&lt;ref&gt;https://learn.canvas.net/courses/23/files/21549/download?verifier=FpgcVPH5Lh0uzjpHRImwtJL4Wdun9WMJrglnCxbt&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant to the course content were the interviews with prominent comic book creators: [[Terry Moore (comics)|Terry Moore]] author of ''[[Strangers in Paradise]]''; [[Mark Waid]], writer for ''[[Superman]]''; [[Kelly Sue DeConnick]], [[Steve Wacker]], and [[Sana Amanant]], creators of the new [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]]; [[Gail Simone]] author of [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]]; [[Scott Snyder]] author of [[Swamp Thing]]; and [[Brian K. Vaughn]] author of [[Y: The Last Man]]. Students could put questions forth in the discussion boards for the class, or use a Twitter hashtag to tweet questions during the interviews.

== Week One: What is gender? ==
Week one was an introduction into what gender is, and how gender differs from sex. Readings for this week included Strangers in Paradise, volumes 1 and 2, and the first issue of Rachel Rising, all by writer/artist Terry Moore. The week's interview was with Moore, as well. Additional reading for the introduction to gender was the article "Night to His Day": The Social Construction of Gender by Judith Lorber.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tannerhiggin.com/summer11eng1c/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/social_constructions.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Week Two: Gender and Culture: How we learn our gender ==
Week two discussed how gender is learned. Blanch interviewed Mark Waid, and the comic book selections were Action Comics #1 (the first appearance of Superman) and #267, and Waid's Birthright series. Additionally, the article "Doing Gender" by Candace West and Don H. Zimmerman&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.lib.umn.edu/clar0514/academic/west%20and%20zimmerman.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; was assigned.

== Week Three: Who is producing comic book culture? ==
Week three dealt with comic books as a medium of communication. The interview included Kelly Sue DeConnick, Sana Ammant and Steve Wacker and their roles as writers and editors. The assigned comics were Captain Marvel #1-7, Ms. Marvel #1, vol. 1, Ms. Marvel #1, vol. 2, and Daredevil #1. The article "How Comic Books are Made from Idea to Print"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=laichas |url=http://www.impact-books.com/comics/how-comic-books-are-made-from-idea-to-print |title=How Comic Books are Made from Idea to Print |publisher=IMPACT Books |date=2011-01-28 |accessdate=August 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the supplemental reading.

== Week Four: Femininity ==
Week four discussed femininity, and the readings included Secret Six (vol. 2) 1-7, Wonder Woman #1, Wonder Woman (New 52) #7, Birds of Prey #56, and Batgirl #0. The interview was with Gail Simone. (Due to technical difficulties, this was a recorded interview, not live as the others were.) The article "Spice World: Constructing Femininity the Popular Way" by Dafna Lemish&lt;ref&gt;http://users.ipfw.edu/tankel/syllabi/spring%202005/com%20507/spicegirls.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; was also assigned.

== Week Five: Masculinity ==
Week five discussed masculinity, and the comics assigned were both from the New 52: Batman #0 and Swamp Thing #0. The interview was with Scott Snyder. Additional reading was "Comic Book Masculinity and the New Black Superhero" by Jeffrey A. Brown&lt;ref&gt;http://lmc.gatech.edu/~hcarroll/courses/e1102-sp04/e1102-scans/secondary-sources/brown.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Week Six: Gendered Spaces and Consuming Comics ==
The final week discussed how different spaces can be gendered, and differences in how comics are consumed. The readings were from Y: The Last Man (#1-6) and Saga #1, and the interview was with Brian K. Vaughan. The article "Gendered Spaces: Gym Culture and the Construction of Gender" by Thomas Johansson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://logic.itsc.cuhk.edu.hk/~b114299/young/1996-3/artikkelJohansson3-96.htm |title=T Johansson/JA |publisher=Logic.itsc.cuhk.edu.hk |date= |accessdate=August 5, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102191747/http://logic.itsc.cuhk.edu.hk/~b114299/young/1996-3/artikkelJohansson3-96.htm |archivedate=January 2, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; was also assigned.

The student interaction in the message boards added to the discussions. Since the students were not in a classroom, this was the way they could share ideas and questions, and challenge others to see things from another point of view. Because the class was also global, the students brought with them their own cultural differences, which also added to the discussions.

{{Neuropsychology}}
'''Learning''' is the process of acquiring new, or modifying existing, [[knowledge]], [[behavior]]s, [[skill]]s, [[value (personal and cultural)|value]]s, or [[preference]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Gross, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Cle1Fcr_6_QC&amp;pg=PT335 Psychology: The Science of Mind and Behaviour] 6E, Hachette UK, {{ISBN|9781444164367}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to learn is possessed by humans, animals, and some [[machine learning|machines]]; there is also evidence for some kind of learning in some plants.&lt;ref&gt;Karban, R. (2015). Plant Learning and Memory. In: ''Plant Sensing and Communication''. Chicago and London: The University of Chicago Press, pp. 31-44, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8HOeCQAAQBAJ].&lt;/ref&gt; Some learning is immediate, induced by a single event (e.g. being burned by a hot stove), but much skill and knowledge accumulates from repeated experiences. The changes induced by learning often last a lifetime, and it is hard to distinguish learned material that seems to be "lost" from that which cannot be retrieved.&lt;ref name="Schacter"&gt;{{cite book | title=Psychology, 2nd edition | publisher=Worth Publishers |author1=Daniel L. Schacter |author2=Daniel T. Gilbert |author3=Daniel M. Wegner | origyear=2009| year=2011 | pages=264 | isbn=978-1-4292-3719-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human learning begins before birth and continues until death as a consequence of ongoing interactions between person and environment. The nature and processes involved in learning are studied in many fields, including [[educational psychology]], [[neuropsychology]], [[experimental psychology]], and [[pedagogy]]. Research in such fields has led to the identification of various sorts of learning. For example, learning may occur as a result of [[habituation]], or [[classical conditioning]], [[operant conditioning]] or as a result of more complex activities such as [[play (activity)|play]], seen only in relatively intelligent animals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Publications/ZooGoer/1996/1/junglegyms.cfm Jungle Gyms: The Evolution of Animal Play] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011051238/http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Publications/ZooGoer/1996/1/junglegyms.cfm |date=2007-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecephalopodpage.org/behavior.php|title=What behavior can we expect of octopuses? - The Cephalopod Page|author=|date=|website=www.thecephalopodpage.org|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005135515/http://www.thecephalopodpage.org/behavior.php|archivedate=5 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Learning may occur [[conscious]]ly or without conscious awareness. Learning that an aversive event can't be avoided nor escaped may result in a condition called [[learned helplessness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Britannica|1380861|Learned helplessness}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence for human behavioral learning [[prenatal]]ly, in which [[habituation]] has been observed as early as 32 weeks into [[gestation]], indicating that the [[central nervous system]] is sufficiently developed and primed for learning and [[memory]] to occur very early on in [[developmental psychology|development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sandman | first1 = Wadhwa | last2 = Hetrick | first2 = Porto | last3 = Peeke | year = 1997 | title = Human fetal heart rate dishabituation between thirty and thirty-two weeks gestation | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 68 | issue = 6| pages = 1031–1040 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1997.tb01982.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Play has been approached by several theorists as the first form of learning. Children experiment with the world, learn the rules, and learn to interact through play. [[Lev Vygotsky]] agrees that play is pivotal for children's development, since they make meaning of their environment through playing educational games.

=== Non-associative learning ===
''Non-associative learning'' refers to "a relatively permanent change in the strength of response to a single stimulus due to repeated exposure to that stimulus. Changes due to such factors as [[sensory adaptation]], [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], or injury do not qualify as non-associative learning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://users.ipfw.edu/abbott/314/Non-associativeLearning.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103191805/http://users.ipfw.edu/abbott/314/Non-associativeLearning.pdf |archivedate=2014-01-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-associative learning can be divided into [[habituation]] and [[sensitization]].

==== Habituation ====
{{Main|Habituation}}
''Habituation'' is an example of non-associative learning in which the strength or probability of a response diminishes when the stimulus is repeated. The response is typically a reflex or unconditioned response. Thus, habituation must be distinguished from [[Extinction (psychology)|extinction]], which is an associative process. In operant extinction, for example, a response declines because it is no longer followed by a reward. An example of habituation can be seen in small song birds—if a stuffed [[owl]] (or similar [[predator]]) is put into the cage, the birds initially react to it as though it were a real predator. Soon the birds react less, showing habituation. If another stuffed owl is introduced (or the same one removed and re-introduced), the birds react to it again as though it were a predator, demonstrating that it is only a very specific stimulus that is habituated to (namely, one particular unmoving owl in one place). The habituation process is faster for stimuli that occur at a high rather than for stimuli that occur at a low rate as well as for the weak and strong stimuli, respectively.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Science of Learning|last=Pear|first=Joseph|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2014|isbn=9781317762805|location=London|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Habituation has been shown in essentially every species of animal, as well as the sensitive plant ''[[Mimosa pudica]]''&lt;ref name="gagliano2014"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gagliano | first1 = M. | display-authors = etal | year = 2014 | title = Experience teaches plants to learn faster and forget slower in environments where it matters | url = | journal = Oecologia | volume = 175 | issue = 1| pages = 63–72 | doi=10.1007/s00442-013-2873-7| pmid = 24390479 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the large protozoan ''[[Stentor coeruleus]]''.&lt;ref name="wood1988"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wood | first1 = D.C. | year = 1988 | title = Habituation in ''Stentor'' produced by mechanoreceptor channel modification | url = | journal = Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 2254 | issue = | page = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept acts in direct opposition to sensitization.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Sensitization ====
{{Main|Sensitization}}
''Sensitization'' is an example of non-associative learning in which the progressive amplification of a response follows repeated administrations of a [[stimulation|stimulus]] (Bell et al., 1995).{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} This is based on the notion that a defensive reflex to a stimulus such as withdrawal or escape becomes stronger after the exposure to a different harmful or threatening stimulus.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Neurosciences - From Molecule to Behavior: a university textbook|last=Galizia|first=Giovanni|last2=Lledo|first2=Pierre-Marie|publisher=Springer Spektrum|year=2013|isbn=9783642107689|location=Heidelberg|pages=578}}&lt;/ref&gt; An everyday example of this mechanism is the repeated tonic stimulation of peripheral nerves that occurs if a person rubs their arm continuously. After a while, this stimulation creates a warm sensation that eventually turns painful. The pain results from the progressively amplified synaptic response of the peripheral nerves warning that the stimulation is harmful.{{clarify|date=January 2011}} Sensitisation is thought to underlie both adaptive as well as maladaptive learning processes in the organism.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

=== Active learning ===
{{main|Active learning}}

[[File:Learning_Retention_Pyramid.JPG|thumb|[[Experiential learning]] is more efficient than passive learning like reading or listening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/igorkokcharov/kokcharov-skillpyramid2015|title=Hierarchy of Skills|first=|last=Igor Kokcharov, Ph.D, PMP|date=22 May 2015|website=slideshare.net|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161217164955/http://www.slideshare.net/igorkokcharov/kokcharov-skillpyramid2015|archivedate=17 December 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

''Active learning'' occurs when a person takes control of his/her learning experience. Since understanding information is the key aspect of learning, it is important for learners to recognize what they understand and what they do not. By doing so, they can monitor their own mastery of subjects. Active learning encourages learners to have an internal dialogue in which they verbalize understandings. This and other meta-cognitive strategies can be taught to a child over time. Studies within [[metacognition]] have proven the value in active learning, claiming that the learning is usually at a stronger level as a result.&lt;ref&gt;[(Bransford, 2000, pg.15-20)]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, learners have more incentive to learn when they have control over not only how they learn but also what they learn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url = https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/files/?whdmsaction=public:main.file&amp;fileID=8113| title = Natural Learning in Higher Education| author = J.

Conversely, [[passive learning]] and [[direct instruction]] are characteristics of teacher-centered learning (or [[traditional education]]).

The [[research]] works on the human learning process as a [[complex adaptive system]] developed by [[Peter Belohlavek]] showed that it is the concept that the individual has that drives the accommodation process to assimilate new knowledge in the [[long-term memory]], defining learning as an intrinsically freedom-oriented and active process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last= Ferro|first= María Laura|date=2003-01-05|title= Teoría Unicista: Otra manera de aprender|magazine= Revista Nueva|location= Nº 599, p. 10-12|publisher= Agrupación Diarios del Interior}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[student-centered learning]] approach, the unicist reflection driven learning installs adaptive knowledge objects in the mind of the learner based on a cyclic process of: “action-reflection-action” to foster an [[adaptive behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Caldas|first= Sérgio Túlio|date=1990-08-30|title= Economista cria centro de estudo empresarial|url= |work= O Estado de São Paulo|location= Economia, p. 9 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ssrn.com/abstract=3161708|title= Unicist Reflection Driven Learning for Superior Education|last= Belohlavek|first=Peter|date=2018-04-12|website= |publisher=SSRN|access-date= 2018-09-29|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Associative learning ===
''Associative learning'' is the process by which a person or animal learns an association between two stimuli or events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Discovery Series: Introduction to Psychology|last=Plotnik|first=Rod|last2=Kouyomdijan|first2=Haig|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning|year=2012|isbn=9781111347024|location=Belmont, CA|pages=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; In classical conditioning a previously neutral stimulus is repeatedly paired with a reflex eliciting stimulus until eventually the neutral stimulus elicits a response on its own. In operant conditioning, a behavior that is reinforced or punished in the presence of a stimulus becomes more or less likely to occur in the presence of that stimulus.

==== Operant conditioning ====
{{Main|Operant conditioning}}
In ''operant conditioning'', a reinforcement (by reward) or instead a punishment given after a given behavior, change the frequency and/or form of that behavior. Stimulus present when the behavior/consequence occurs come to control these behavior modifications.

==== Classical conditioning ====
{{Main|Classical conditioning}}
The typical paradigm for ''classical conditioning'' involves repeatedly pairing an unconditioned stimulus (which unfailingly evokes a reflexive response) with another previously neutral stimulus (which does not normally evoke the response). Following conditioning, the response occurs both to the unconditioned stimulus and to the other, unrelated stimulus (now referred to as the "conditioned stimulus"). The response to the conditioned stimulus is termed a ''conditioned response''. The classic example is [[Ivan Pavlov]] and his dogs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Pavlov fed his dogs meat powder, which naturally made the dogs salivate—salivating is a reflexive response to the meat powder. Meat powder is the unconditioned stimulus (US) and the salivation is the unconditioned response (UR). Pavlov rang a bell before presenting the meat powder. The first time Pavlov rang the bell, the neutral stimulus, the dogs did not salivate, but once he put the meat powder in their mouths they began to salivate. After numerous pairings of bell and food, the dogs learned that the bell signaled that food was about to come, and began to salivate when they heard the bell. Once this occurred, the bell became the conditioned stimulus (CS) and the salivation to the bell became the conditioned response (CR). Classical conditioning has been demonstrated in many species. For example, it is seen in honeybees, in the [[proboscis extension reflex]] paradigm.&lt;ref name="bitterman"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bitterman | display-authors = etal | year = 1983 | title = Classical Conditioning of Proboscis Extension in Honeybees (''Apis mellifera'') | url = | journal = J. Comp. Psychol. | volume = 97 | issue = 2| pages = 107–119 | doi=10.1037/0735-7036.97.2.107}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was recently also demonstrated in garden pea plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gagliano|first=Monica|last2=Vyazovskiy|first2=Vladyslav V.|last3=Borbély|first3=Alexander A.|last4=Grimonprez|first4=Mavra|last5=Depczynski|first5=Martial|date=2016-12-02|title=Learning by Association in Plants|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep38427|journal=Scientific Reports|language=en|volume=6|issue=1|pages=38427|doi=10.1038/srep38427|issn=2045-2322|pmc=5133544|pmid=27910933|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623143237/http://www.nature.com/articles/srep38427|archivedate=2017-06-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another influential person in the world of classical conditioning is [[John B. Watson]]. Watson's work was very influential and paved the way for [[B.F. Skinner]]'s radical behaviorism. Watson's behaviorism (and philosophy of science) stood in direct contrast to Freud and other accounts based largely on introspection. Watson's view was that the introspective method was too subjective, and that we should limit the study of human development to directly observable behaviors. In 1913, Watson published the article "Psychology as the Behaviorist Views," in which he argued that laboratory studies should serve psychology best as a science. Watson's most famous, and controversial, experiment, "[[Little Albert]]", where he demonstrated how psychologists can account for the learning of emotion through classical conditioning principles.

==== Observational learning ====
{{Main|Observational learning}}
''Observational learning'' is learning that occurs through observing the behavior of others. It is a form of social learning which takes various forms, based on various processes. In humans, this form of learning seems to not need reinforcement to occur, but instead, requires a social model such as a parent, sibling, friend, or teacher with surroundings.

==== Imprinting ====
{{Main|Imprinting (psychology)}}
''Imprinting'' is a kind of learning occurring at a particular life stage that is rapid and apparently independent of the consequences of behavior. In filial imprinting, young animals, particularly birds, form an association with another individual or in some cases, an object, that they respond to as they would to a parent. In 1935, the Austrian Zoologist Konrad Lorenz discovered that certain birds follow and form a bond if the object makes sounds.

=== Play ===
{{Main|Play (activity)}}
''Play'' generally describes behavior with no particular end in itself, but that improves performance in similar future situations. This is seen in a wide variety of vertebrates besides humans, but is mostly limited to [[mammal]]s and [[bird]]s. Cats are known to play with a ball of string when young, which gives them experience with catching prey. Besides inanimate objects, animals may play with other members of their own species or other animals, such as [[orca]]s playing with seals they have caught. Play involves a significant cost to animals, such as increased vulnerability to [[predator]]s and the risk of [[injury]] and possibly [[infection]]. It also consumes [[energy]], so there must be significant benefits associated with play for it to have evolved. Play is generally seen in younger animals, suggesting a link with learning. However, it may also have other benefits not associated directly with learning, for example improving [[physical fitness]].

Play, as it pertains to humans as a form of learning is central to a child's learning and development. Through play, children learn social skills such as sharing and collaboration. Children develop emotional skills such as learning to deal with the emotion of anger, through play activities. As a form of learning, play also facilitates the development of thinking and language skills in children.&lt;ref name="Lillemyr, O.F. 2009"&gt;Lillemyr, O.F. (2009). Taking play seriously. Children and play in early childhood education: an exciting challenge. Charlotte, NC: Information Age Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are five types of play:
# sensorimotor play aka functional play, characterized by repetition of activity
# role play occurs starting at the age of 3
# rule-based play where authoritative prescribed codes of conduct are primary
# construction play involves experimentation and building
# movement play aka physical play&lt;ref name="Lillemyr, O.F. 2009"/&gt;

These five types of play are often intersecting. All types of play generate thinking and [[problem-solving]] skills in children. Children learn to think creatively when they learn through play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Whitebread | first1 = D. | last2 = Coltman | first2 = P. | last3 = Jameson | first3 = H. | last4 = Lander | first4 = R. | year = 2009 | title = Play, cognition and self-regulation: What exactly are children learning when they learn through play? | url = | journal = Educational &amp; Child Psychology | volume = 26 | issue = 2| pages = 40–52 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific activities involved in each type of play change over time as humans progress through the lifespan. Play as a form of learning, can occur solitarily, or involve interacting with others.

=== Enculturation ===
{{Main|Enculturation}}
''Enculturation'' is the process by which people learn values and behaviors that are appropriate or necessary in their surrounding culture.&lt;ref name="GrusecHastings"&gt;Grusec, Joan E.; Hastings, Paul D. "Handbook of Socialization: Theory and Research", 2007, Guilford Press; {{ISBN|1-59385-332-7}}, {{ISBN|978-1-59385-332-7}}; at page 547.&lt;/ref&gt; Parents, other adults, and peers shape the individual's understanding of these values.&lt;ref name="GrusecHastings"/&gt; If successful, enculturation results in competence in the language, values and rituals of the culture.&lt;ref name="GrusecHastings"/&gt; This is different from [[acculturation]], where a person adopts the values and societal rules of a culture different from their native one.

Multiple examples of enculturation can be found cross-culturally. Collaborative practices in the Mazahua people have shown that participation in everyday interaction and later learning activities contributed to enculturation rooted in nonverbal social experience.&lt;ref name="Paradise1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Paradise|first1=Ruth|title=Interactional Style and Nonverbal Meaning: Mazahua Children Learning How to Be Separate-But-Together|journal=Anthropology &amp; Education Quarterly|date=1994|doi=10.1525/aeq.1994.25.2.05x0907w|volume=25|issue=2|pages=156–172}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the children participated in everyday activities, they learned the cultural significance of these interactions. The collaborative and helpful behaviors exhibited by Mexican and Mexican-heritage children is a cultural practice known as being "acomedido".&lt;ref name=Lopez2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lopez|first1=Angelica|last2=Najafi|first2=Behnosh|last3=Rogoff|first3=Barbara|last4=Mejia-Arauz|first4=Rebeca|title=Collaboration and helping as cultural practices|journal=The Oxford Handbook of Culture and Psychology|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chillihuani girls in Peru described themselves as weaving constantly, following behavior shown by the other adults.&lt;ref name=Bolin&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bolin|first1=Inge|title=Growing Up in a Culture of Respect: Childrearing in highland Peru|date=2006|publisher=University of Texas|location=Austin|isbn=978-0-292-71298-0|pages=90–99|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Episodic learning ===
''Episodic learning'' is a change in behavior that occurs as a result of an event.&lt;ref&gt;Terry, W. S. (2006). Learning and Memory: Basic principles, processes, and procedures. Boston: Pearson Education, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a fear of dogs that follows being bitten by a dog is episodic learning. Episodic learning is so named because events are recorded into [[episodic memory]], which is one of the three forms of explicit learning and retrieval, along with perceptual memory and [[semantic memory]].&lt;ref&gt;Baars, B. J. &amp; Gage, N. M. (2007). Cognition, Brain, and Consciousness: Introduction to cognitive neuroscience. London: Elsevier Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; Episodic memory remembers events and history that are embedded in experience and this is distinguished from semantic memory, which attempts to extract facts out of their experiential context&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sixth International Conference on Cognitive Modeling: ICCM - 2004|last=Lovett|first=Marsha|last2=Schunn|first2=Christian|last3=Lebiere|first3=Christian|last4=Munro|first4=Paul|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Publishers|year=2004|isbn=978-0805854268|location=Mahwah, New Jersey|pages=220}}&lt;/ref&gt; or - as some describe - a timeless organization of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Artificial Intelligence: Critical Concepts, Volume 1|last=Chrisley|first=Ronald|last2=Begeer|first2=Sander|publisher=Routledge|year=2000|isbn=978-0415193320|location=London|pages=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, if a person remembers the [[Grand Canyon National Park|Grand Canyon]] from a recent visit, it is an episodic memory. He would use semantic memory to answer someone who would ask him information such as where the Grand Canyon is. A study revealed that humans are very accurate in the recognition of episodic memory even without deliberate intention to memorize it.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals of Cognitive Neuroscience: A Beginner's Guide|last=Gage|first=Nicole|last2=Baars|first2=Bernard|publisher=Academic Press|year=2018|isbn=9780128038130|location=London|pages=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is said to indicate a very large storage capacity of the brain for things that people pay attention to.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Multimedia learning ===
{{Main|Multimedia learning}}
''Multimedia learning'' is where a person uses both auditory and visual stimuli to learn information {{Harv|Mayer|2001}}. This type of learning relies on [[dual-coding theory]] {{Harv|Paivio|1971}}.

=== E-learning and augmented learning ===
{{Main|Electronic learning}}
''Electronic learning'' or e-learning is computer-enhanced learning. A specific and always more diffused e-learning is [[mobile learning]] (m-learning), which uses different mobile telecommunication equipment, such as [[cellular phone]]s.

When a learner interacts with the e-learning environment, it's called [[augmented learning]]. By adapting to the needs of individuals, the context-driven instruction can be dynamically tailored to the learner's natural environment. Augmented digital content may include text, images, video, audio (music and voice). By personalizing instruction, augmented learning has been shown to improve learning performance for a lifetime.&lt;ref name="Augmented Learning"&gt;[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1156186 Augmented Learning], Augmented Learning: Context-Aware Mobile Augmented Reality Architecture for Learning&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[minimally invasive education]].

Moore (1989)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moore | first1 = M | year = 1989 | title = Three types of interaction | url = | journal = American Journal of Distance Education | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 1–6 | doi=10.1080/08923648909526659| citeseerx = 10.1.1.491.4800 }}&lt;/ref&gt; purported that three core types of interaction are necessary for quality, effective online learning:
* learner–learner (i.e. communication between and among peers with or without the teacher present),
* learner–instructor (i.e. student teacher communication), and
* learner–content (i.e. intellectually interacting with content that results in changes in learners' understanding, perceptions, and cognitive structures).
In his theory of transactional distance, Moore (1993)&lt;ref&gt;Moore, M. G. (1993). Theory of transactional distance. In D. Keegan (Ed.), Theoretical principles of distance education (pp. 22-38). London and New York: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; contented that structure and interaction or dialogue bridge the gap in understanding and communication that is created by geographical distances (known as transactional distance).

=== Rote learning ===
{{Main|Rote learning}}
''Rote learning'' is [[memorizing]] information so that it can be [[recollection|recalled]] by the learner exactly the way it was read or heard. The major technique used for rote learning is ''learning by repetition'', based on the idea that a learner can recall the material exactly (but not its meaning) if the information is repeatedly processed. Rote learning is used in diverse areas, from mathematics to music to religion. Although it has been criticized by some educators, rote learning is a necessary precursor to meaningful learning.

=== Meaningful learning ===
{{See also|Deeper Learning}}
''Meaningful learning'' is the concept that learned knowledge (e.g., a fact) is fully understood to the extent that it relates to other knowledge. To this end, meaningful learning contrasts with [[rote learning]] in which information is acquired without regard to understanding. Meaningful learning, on the other hand, implies there is a comprehensive knowledge of the context of the facts learned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hassard|first=Jack|title=Backup of Meaningful Learning Model|url=http://www.csudh.edu/dearhabermas/advorgbk02.htm|accessdate=30 November 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111029042955/http://www.csudh.edu/dearhabermas/advorgbk02.htm|archivedate=29 October 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Informal learning ===
{{Main|Informal learning}}
''Informal learning'' occurs through the experience of day-to-day situations (for example, one would learn to look ahead while walking because of the danger inherent in not paying attention to where one is going). It is learning from life, during a meal at table with parents, [[play (activity)|play]], exploring, etc.

=== Formal learning ===
{{Main|Education}}
[[Image:Laurentius de Voltolina 001.jpg|right|225px|thumb|A depiction of the world's oldest continually operating university, the [[University of Bologna]], Italy]]
''Formal learning'' is learning that takes place within a teacher-student relationship, such as in a school system. The term formal learning has nothing to do with the formality of the learning, but rather the way it is directed and organized. In formal learning, the learning or training departments set out the goals and objectives of the learning.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, J., and Dale, M., [http://www.knowledgejump.com/learning/informal.html " Informal Learning in the Workplace"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121140538/http://www.knowledgejump.com/learning/informal.html |date=2013-01-21 }}, '' Department for Education and Employment Research Report No. 134. London, England: Department for Education and Employment'', August 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nonformal learning ===
{{Main|Nonformal learning}}
''Nonformal learning'' is organized learning outside the formal learning system. For example, learning by coming together with people with similar interests and exchanging viewpoints, in clubs or in (international) youth organizations, workshops.

=== Nonformal learning and combined approaches ===
The educational system may use a combination of formal, informal, and nonformal learning methods. The UN and EU recognize these different forms of learning (cf. links below). In some schools, students can get points that count in the formal-learning systems if they get work done in informal-learning circuits. They may be given time to assist international youth workshops and training courses, on the condition they prepare, contribute, share and can prove this offered valuable new insight, helped to acquire new skills, a place to get experience in organizing, [[teaching]], etc.

To learn a skill, such as solving a [[Rubik's Cube]] quickly, several factors come into play at once:
* Reading directions helps a player learn the patterns that solve the Rubik's Cube.
* Practicing the moves repeatedly helps build "[[muscle memory]]" and speed.
* Thinking critically about moves helps find shortcuts, which speeds future attempts.
* Observing the Rubik's Cube's six colors help anchor solutions in the mind.
* Revisiting the cube occasionally helps retain the skill.

=== Tangential learning ===
''Tangential learning'' is the process by which people self-educate if a topic is exposed to them in a context that they already enjoy. For example, after playing a music-based video game, some people may be motivated to learn how to play a real instrument, or after watching a TV show that references Faust and Lovecraft, some people may be inspired to read the original work.&lt;ref&gt;Tangential Learning {{cite web |url=http://penny-arcade.com/patv/episode/tangential-learning |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-31 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104053746/http://penny-arcade.com/patv/episode/tangential-learning |archivedate=2012-01-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-education can be improved with systematization. According to experts in natural learning,
self-oriented learning training has proven an effective tool for assisting independent learners with the natural phases of learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1039&amp;context=marketing_papers | title = The Natural Learning Project | author = J.

''[[Extra Credits]]'' writer and game designer James Portnow was the first to suggest games as a potential venue for "tangential learning".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robert|first=Rath,|date=2015-01-22|title=Game Criticism as Tangential Learning Facilitator: The Case of Critical Intel|url=http://gamescriticism.org/articles/rath-2-1/|journal=Journal of Games Criticism|language=en-US|volume=2|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mozelius ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mozelius et al|first=|date=|title=Motivating Factors and Tangential Learning for Knowledge Acquisition in Educational Games|url=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1154724.pdf|journal=The Electronic Journal of E-Learning|volume= 15| issue = 4 2017|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; points out that intrinsic integration of learning content seems to be a crucial design factor, and that games that include modules for further self-studies tend to present good results. The built-in encyclopedias in the ''[[Civilization (series)|Civilization]]'' games are presented as an example - by using these modules gamers can dig deeper for knowledge about historical events in the gameplay. The importance of rules that regulate learning modules and game experience is discussed by Moreno, C.,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moreno|first=Carlos|date=|year=2014|title=Kiwaka {{!}} Kiwaka Story (by LANDKA®)|url=http://www.lifeplay.es/volumen3/Analisis/067_070_RAMIREZ_MORENO_Analisis.pdf|journal=LifePlay|volume=3|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a case study about the mobile game {{Wikidata entity link| Q55416666}}.

=== Dialogic learning ===
{{Main|Dialogic learning}}
''Dialogic learning'' is a type of learning based on dialogue.

=== Incidental learning ===
In ''incidental teaching'' learning is not planned by the instructor or the student, it occurs as a byproduct of another activity — an experience, observation, self-reflection, interaction, unique event, or common routine task. This learning happens in addition to or apart from the instructor's plans and the student's expectations. An example of incidental teaching is when the instructor places a train set on top of a cabinet. If the child points or walks towards the cabinet, the instructor prompts the student to say “train.” Once the student says “train,” he gets access to the train set.

Here are some steps most commonly used in incidental teaching:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nspt4kids.com/healthtopics-and-conditions-database/incidental-teaching/|title=What is incidental teaching?|year=2017|website=North Shore Pediatric Therapy, Illinois|access-date=August 29, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829204217/http://nspt4kids.com/healthtopics-and-conditions-database/incidental-teaching/|archivedate=August 29, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An instructor will arrange the learning environment so that necessary materials are within the student's sight, but not within his reach, thus impacting his motivation to seek out those materials.
* An instructor waits for the student to initiate engagement.
* An instructor prompts the student to respond if needed.
* An instructor allows access to an item/activity contingent on a correct response from the student.
* The instructor fades out the prompting process over a period of time and subsequent trials.

Incidental learning is an occurrence that is not generally accounted for using the traditional methods of instructional objectives and outcomes assessment. This type of learning occurs in part as a product of social interaction and active involvement in both online and onsite courses. Research implies that some un-assessed aspects of onsite and online learning challenge the equivalency of education between the two modalities. Both onsite and online learning have distinct advantages with traditional on-campus students experiencing higher degrees of incidental learning in three times as many areas as online students. Additional research is called for to investigate the implications of these findings both conceptually and pedagogically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Konetes|first1=George|title=The Effects of Distance Education and Student Involvement on Incidental Learning|journal=IUP Doctoral Dissertations|date=2011|pages=115|url=https://dspace.iup.edu/bitstream/handle/2069/477/George%20Konetes.pdf?sequence=1|accessdate=2014-07-12|ref=Incidental Learning|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714130414/https://dspace.iup.edu/bitstream/handle/2069/477/George%20Konetes.pdf?sequence=1|archivedate=2014-07-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Domains ==
[[File:France in XXI Century. School.jpg|thumb|270px|''Future school'' (1901 or 1910)]]
[[Benjamin Bloom]] has suggested three domains of learning:
* [[Cognitive]]: To recall, calculate, discuss, analyze, problem solve, etc.
* [[Psychomotor learning|Psychomotor]]: To dance, swim, ski, dive, drive a car, ride a bike, etc.
* [[Affective]]: To like something or someone, love, appreciate, fear, hate, worship, etc.

These domains are not mutually exclusive. For example, in learning to play [[chess]], the person must learn the rules (cognitive domain)—but must also learn how to set up the chess pieces and how to properly hold and move a chess piece (psychomotor). Furthermore, later in the game the person may even learn to love the game itself, value its applications in life, and appreciate its [[history of chess|history]] (affective domain).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessballs.com/bloomstaxonomyoflearningdomains.htm|title=Bloom's Taxonomy|author=|date=|website=www.businessballs.com|accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transfer ==
Transfer of learning is the application of skill, knowledge or understanding to resolve a novel problem or situation that happens when certain conditions are fulfilled. Research indicates that learning transfer is infrequent; most common when "... cued, primed, and guided..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perkins|first=D.N.|author2=Salomon, G. |title=Are Cognitive Skills Context-Bound?|journal=Educational Researcher|date=Jan–Feb 1989|volume=18|issue=1|pages=16–25 [19]|doi=10.3102/0013189x018001016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has sought to clarify what it is, and how it might be promoted through instruction.

Over the history of its discourse, various hypotheses and definitions have been advanced. First, it is speculated that different types of transfer exist, including: near transfer, the application of skill to solve a novel problem in a similar context; and far transfer, the application of skill to solve novel problem presented in a different context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Committee on Developments in the Science of Learning with additional material from the Committee on Learning Research|title=Chapter 3. Learning and Transfer. How People Learn: Brain, Mind, Experience, and School: Expanded Edition|year=2000|publisher=The National Academies Press|url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=9853|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426234827/http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=9853|archivedate=2013-04-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Perkins and Salomon (1992) suggest that positive transfer in cases when learning supports novel problem solving, and negative transfer occurs when prior learning inhibits performance on highly correlated tasks, such as second or third-language learning.&lt;ref name="Perkins"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perkins|first=D.N.|author2=Salomon, G. |title=Transfer of Learning|journal=International Encyclopedia of Education|year=1992|volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concepts of positive and negative transfer have a long history; researchers in the early 20th century described the possibility that "...habits or mental acts developed by a particular kind of training may inhibit rather than facilitate other mental activities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rogers|first=Agnes L.|title=The Bearing of the New Psychology upon the Teaching of Mathematics|journal=Teacher's College Record|year=1916|volume=17|pages=344–352}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Schwarz, Bransford and Sears (2005) have proposed that transferring knowledge into a situation may differ from transferring knowledge out to a situation as a means to reconcile findings that transfer may both be frequent and challenging to promote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schwartz, Daniel L., John D. Bransford, and David Sears|title=Efficiency and innovation in transfer: Transfer of learning from a modern multidisciplinary perspective|year=2005|pages=1–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant and long research history has also attempted to explicate the conditions under which transfer of learning might occur. Early research by Ruger, for example, found that the "level of attention", "attitudes", "method of attack" (or method for tackling a problem), a "search for new points of view", "a careful testing of hypothesis" and "generalization" were all valuable approaches for promoting transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ruger|first=Henry Alfred|title=The psychology of efficiency: an experimental study of the processes involved in the solution of mechanical puzzles and in the acquisition of skill in their manipulation|journal=Science Press|year=1910|volume=19|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; To encourage transfer through teaching, Perkins and Salomon recommend aligning ("hugging") instruction with practice and assessment, and "bridging", or encouraging learners to reflect on past experiences or make connections between prior knowledge and current content.&lt;ref name="Perkins" /&gt;

== Factors affecting learning ==

=== External factors ===
# ''[[Heredity]]'': A classroom instructor can neither change nor increase heredity, but the student can use and develop it. Some learners are rich in hereditary endowment while others are poor. Each student is unique and has different abilities. The native intelligence is different in individuals. Heredity governs or conditions our ability to learn and the rate of learning. The intelligent learners can establish and see relationship very easily and more quickly.
# ''Status of students'': Physical and home conditions also matter: Certain problems like malnutrition i.e.; inadequate supply of nutrients to the body, fatigue i.e.; tiredness, bodily weakness, and bad health are great obstructers in learning. These are some of the physical conditions by which a student can get affected. Home is a place where a family lives. If the home conditions are not proper, the student is affected seriously. Some of the home conditions are bad ventilation, unhygienic living, bad light, etc. These affect the student and his or her rate of learning.&lt;ref name="Ref 1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mangal|first1=S.K.|title=ESSENTIALS OF EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY|date=January 5, 2007|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd|isbn= 9788120330559|page=736}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref 2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aggarwal|first1=J.C|title=Essentials Of Educational Psychology|date=November 1, 2009|publisher=Vikas Publishing House Pvt Ltd|isbn= 9788125922926|page=596|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Physical environment'': The design, quality, and setting of a [[learning space]], such as a school or classroom, can each be critical to the success of a [[learning environment]]. Size, configuration, comfort—fresh air, temperature, light, acoustics, furniture—can all affect a student's learning. The tools used by both instructors and students directly affect how information is conveyed, from display and writing surfaces (blackboards, markerboards, tack surfaces) to digital technologies. For example, if a room is too crowded, stress levels rise, student attention is reduced, and furniture arrangement is restricted. If furniture is incorrectly arranged, sight lines to the instructor or instructional material is limited and the ability to suit the learning or lesson style is restricted. Aesthetics can also play a role, for if student morale suffers, so does motivation to attend school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edutopia.org/article/new-teachers-designing-classroom-learning-environment-resources ''New Teachers: Designing Learning Environments'', May 7, 2015] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328041804/http://www.edutopia.org/article/new-teachers-designing-classroom-learning-environment-resources |date=March 28, 2016 }}.

=== Internal factors ===
There are several internal factors that affect learning.&lt;ref name="Ref 3"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mangal|first1=SK|title=ADVANCED EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY|date=January 1, 2002|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd|isbn=9788120320383|page=536|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref 4"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bhatia|first1=H.R|title=Elements Of Educational Psychology|date=January 1, 1973|publisher=Orient Blackswan|isbn= 9788125000297|page=558}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are
# ''Goals or purposes'': Each and everyone has a goal. A goal should be set to each pupil according to the standard expected to him. A goal is an aim or desired result. There are 2 types of goals called immediate and distant goals. A goal that occurs or is done at once is called an ''immediate goal,'' and ''distant goals'' are those that take time to achieve. Immediate goals should be set before the young learner and distant goals for older learners. Goals should be specific and clear, so that learners understand.
# ''Motivational behavior'': Motivation means to provide with a motive. Motivation learners should be motivated so that they stimulate themselves with interest. This behavior arouses and regulates the student's internal energies.
# ''Interest'': This is a quality that arouses a feeling. It encourages a student to move over tasks further. During teaching, the instructor must raise interests among students for the best learning. Interest is an apparent (clearly seen or understood) behaviour.
# ''Attention'': Attention means consideration. It is concentration or focusing of consciousness upon one object or an idea. If effective learning should take place attention is essential. Instructors must secure the attention of the student.
# ''Drill or practice'': This method includes repeating the tasks "n" number of times like needs, phrases, principles, etc. This makes learning more effective.
# ''Fatigue'': Generally there are three types of fatigue, i.e., muscular, sensory, and mental. Muscular and sensory fatigues are bodily fatigue. Mental fatigue is in the central nervous system. The remedy is to change teaching methods, e.g., use audio-visual aids, etc.
# ''[[Aptitude]]'': Aptitude is natural ability. It is a condition in which an individuals ability to acquire certain skills, knowledge through training.
# ''[[Attitude (psychology)|Attitude]]'': It is a way of thinking. The attitude of the student must be tested to find out how much inclination he or she has for learning a subject or topic.
# ''Emotional conditions'': Emotions are physiological states of being. Students who answer a question properly or give good results should be praised. This encouragement increases their ability and helps them produce better results. Certain attitudes, such as always finding fault in a student's answer or provoking or embarrassing the student in front of a class are counterproductive.
# ''Speed, Accuracy and retention'': Speed is the rapidity of movement. Retention is the act of retaining. These 3 elements depend upon aptitude, attitude, interest, attention and motivation of the students.
# ''Learning activities'': Learning depends upon the activities and experiences provided by the teacher, his concept of discipline, methods of teaching and above all his overall personality.
# ''Testing'': Various tests measure individual learner differences at the heart of effective learning. Testing helps eliminate subjective elements of measuring pupil differences and performances.
# ''Guidance'': Everyone needs guidance in some part or some time in life. Some need it constantly and some very rarely depending on the students conditions. Small learners need more guidance. Guidance is an advice to solve a problem. Guidance involves the art of helping boys and girls in various aspects of academics, improving vocational aspects like choosing careers and recreational aspects like choosing hobbies. Guidance covers the whole gamut of learners problems- learning as well as non- learning.

== In animal evolution ==
Animals gain knowledge in two ways. First is learning—in which an animal gathers information about its environment and uses this information. For example, if an animal eats something that hurts its stomach, it learns not to eat that again. The second is innate knowledge that is genetically inherited. An example of this is when a horse is born and can immediately walk. The horse has not learned this behavior; it simply knows how to do it.&lt;ref name="Dunlap"&gt;DunlapLehtila_umn_0130E_10349.pdf. at &lt;{{cite web|url=http://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/51978/1/DunlapLehtila_umn_0130E_10349.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113233355/http://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/51978/1/DunlapLehtila_umn_0130E_10349.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-13 |df= }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In some scenarios, [[Instinct|innate knowledge]] is more beneficial than learned knowledge. However, in other scenarios the opposite is true—animals must learn certain behaviors when it is disadvantageous to have a specific innate behavior. In these situations, learning [[Evolution|evolves]] in the species.

=== Costs and benefits of learned and innate knowledge ===
In a changing environment, an animal must constantly gain new information to survive. However, in a stable environment, this same individual needs to gather the information it needs once, and then rely on it for the rest of its life. Therefore, different scenarios better suit either learning or innate knowledge.
Essentially, the cost of obtaining certain knowledge versus the benefit of already having it determines whether an animal evolved to learn in a given situation, or whether it innately knew the information. If the cost of gaining the knowledge outweighs the benefit of having it, then the animal does not evolve to learn in this scenario—but instead, non-learning evolves. However, if the benefit of having certain information outweighs the cost of obtaining it, then the animal is far more likely to evolve to have to learn this information.&lt;ref name="Dunlap" /&gt;

Non-learning is more likely to evolve in two scenarios. If an environment is static and change does not or rarely occurs, then learning is simply unnecessary. Because there is no need for learning in this scenario—and because learning could prove disadvantageous due to the time it took to learn the information—non-learning evolves. However, if an environment is in a constant state of change, then learning is disadvantageous. Anything learned is immediately irrelevant because of the changing environment.&lt;ref name="Dunlap" /&gt; The learned information no longer applies. Essentially, the animal would be just as successful if it took a guess as if it learned. In this situation, non-learning evolves. In fact, a study of ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' showed that learning can actually lead to a decrease in productivity, possibly because egg-laying behaviors and decisions were impaired by interference from the memories gained from the new learned materials or because of the cost of energy in learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.anbehav.2003.12.005 | volume=68 | issue=3 | title=An operating cost of learning in Drosophila melanogaster | journal=Animal Behaviour | pages=589–598| year=2004 | last1=Mery | first1=Frederic | last2=Kawecki | first2=Tadeusz J. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in environments where change occurs within an animal's lifetime but is not constant, learning is more likely to evolve. Learning is beneficial in these scenarios because an animal can [[Adaptation|adapt]] to the new situation, but can still apply the knowledge that it learns for a somewhat extended period of time. Therefore, learning increases the chances of success as opposed to guessing.&lt;ref name="Dunlap" /&gt; An example of this is seen in aquatic environments with landscapes subject to change. In these environments, learning is favored because the fish are predisposed to learn the specific spatial cues where they live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Odling-Smee | first1 = L. | last2 = Braithwaite | first2 = V. A. | year = 2003 | title = The role of learning in fish orientation | url = | journal = Fish and Fisheries | volume = 4 | issue = 3| pages = 235–246 | doi = 10.1046/j.1467-2979.2003.00127.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Machine learning, a branch of [[artificial intelligence]], concerns the construction and study of systems that can learn from data. For example, a machine learning system could be trained on email messages to learn to distinguish between spam and non-spam messages.

[[Art museum]]s of '''[[Ukraine]]''' possess a large number of '''[[Western painting|Western European paintings]]'''. There, one can see canvases by world-famous artists (such as [[Titian]], [[Francesco Guardi]], [[Jusepe de Ribera]], [[Diego Velázquez]], [[Rubens]]) as well as by the painters whose works throughout the world are unique (such as [[Master of the Osservanza]], [[Jacopo del Sellaio]], [[Jacob Ferdinand Voet]], [[Georges de La Tour]] and others).

== Before the year 1917 ==
The museum collections of Western European paintings were formed in different ways. Usually they were based on private collections. The collectors often sold or presented pictures they owned to other owners; sometimes (mostly after the [[1905 Russian Revolution]]) large collections were sold abroad.

A number of Ukrainian art lovers spoke out against the export of the artistic wealth and strove for its preservation in public museums and galleries. As early as in the middle of the 19th century, in Ukraine there existed private museums and ‘cabinets of fine arts’ in the universities of [[Kiev]], [[Kharkov]], and [[Odessa]]. It was due to the public efforts that the first Ukrainian public museum was opened in 1886 in Kharkov, and the municipal art gallery in [[Lvov]] in 1907. Both had large sections of Western European paintings. Some educated people paid their own money to acquire artistic objects which they wanted to donate to their native cities. In such a manner, I. Betsky and A. Alfyorov, graduates of [[Kharkiv University|Kharkov University]], started the collection of Western European paintings at the local museum. In Kiev, it was [[Bogdan Khanenko|Bogdan and Varvara Khanenko]] who in the 1870s began collecting works by Western European artists.

== Between the October Revolution and the Great Patriotic War ==
After the October Revolution, all artistic works located in Ukraine were nationalised and distributed to museums and art galleries, both to the existing and to the newly formed ones.

But the new rulers kept selling works of art abroad. Besides, Ukrainian museum pieces were being exchanged for far less valuable ones from [[Russia]]n museums. For example, against Varvara Khanenko’s will, the [[Bolsheviks]] split the collection of [[Museum of Western and Oriental Art|Kiev Museum]]. Some pieces were sold to the USA for little money that was to be spent on military equipment and arms. Varvara’s will was violated once again after her death when the mention of the Khanenkos disappeared from the name of the museum. After that, it was for a long time called Kiev Museum of Western and Oriental Art.

In 1925-1926, the museum was enriched with Shchavinsky’s collection of the 17th century pictures by [[Flemish people|Flemish]] and [[Netherlands|Dutch]] artists.

In 1919, [[Zhitomir Local History Museum]] was created. Its art gallery was based on the Chaudoirs’ collection with a number of first-rate canvases by Western European painters.

The works from the stock of Odessa Committee for the Protection of Monuments of Art and Antiquity and the ones from the metropolitan museums formed Odessa Art Museum. It was opened in 1920. Its present name is [[Odessa State Museum of Western and Eastern Art]].

In November 1920, the [[Crimea]] having become [[Soviet Union|Soviet]], the regional section for the protection of monuments of art and antiquity started work effecting the order of the Crimean Revolutionary Committee. The section was to expropriate and inventory the art treasures from the palaces and mansions of the Crimean South Coast. In December, the objects expropriated formed the basis of [[Yalta]] Popular Artistic Museum where Western European authors prevailed. In 1927, Yalta Museum's collection was transferred to the newly created [[Sevastopol Art Museum]]. The same year, the museum in Sevastopol received [[Simferopol]] Art Museum’s entire collection of Western European art that included a lot of valuable Flemish and Dutch paintings.

After the annexation of [[Ukraine|Western Ukraine]] to the [[USSR]] in 1939, [[Lviv National Art Gallery|Lviv Art Gallery]] was enriched with nationalised private collections containing plenty of wonderful works by Western Europeans.

== During the Great Patriotic War ==
On June 29, 1941, most pieces from Kiev Museum of Western and Oriental Art started being evacuated to [[Penza]] and [[Saratov]]. But it appeared impossible to move the whole collection. When the [[Germans]] came, they started plundering the collection, a process that was put the brakes on for some time only by Dietrich Roskamp who was the keeper of the museum at that time. He protested against the misappropriation of the artistic objects and moving the collection to Germany. But it was hardly possible to fully stop it, and in 1943, due to the [[Red Army]]’s advance, the invaders organised the exportation of the collection to Germany. They did it methodically at first, listing and carefully packing the objects, and later hastily and chaotically. Altogether, the [[Nazi]]s took 474 pictures, 10 sculptures and about 25,000 prints from the museum. Luckily, a few valuable works had managed to be hidden, among them [[Perugino]]’s ''Archangel'' and [[Marco Palmezzano]]’s ''Madonna with a Saint''.

225 works of art were plundered from [[Lviv National Art Gallery|Lviv Art Gallery]] during the German invasion, many of them were destroyed. Among them was the unique collection of Dürer’s paintings.

In [[Kharkov Art Museum]], only five thousand pieces survived.

Before the war, the collection of [[Poltava Art Museum]] numbered about 30,000 pieces. The exposition failed to be evacuated and was almost all destroyed. Among the losses was the priceless Western European collection with unique works by [[Giambattista Tiepolo]], [[Rubens]], [[Melchior d'Hondecoeter]], [[Adriaen van Ostade]], [[Vigee Le Brun|Vigée-LeBrun]] and others.

The major part of the objects from [[Sevastopol Art Gallery]] was evacuated and preserved by its director Mikhail Kroshitsky. After the war, the works of art from Sevastopol Gallery were on display in [[Simferopol Art Museum|Simferopol]] for some time, because [[Sevastopol]] lay in ruins and the house of the museum had been burnt down.

Only eleven objects of all the pre-war treasures survived in the [[Donetsk Art Museum|Art Museum]] in [[Donetsk]] (at that period the name of the city was Stalino).

== After World War II ==
Kiev and Odessa have the largest collections that exist as independent museums of western and eastern (oriental) art. The Western European collection in Lvov, though as rich and valuable as those in Odessa and Kiev, is but a department of the local art gallery. Sections containing a lot of valuable works by Western Europeans exist in art museums of Kharkov, Sevastopol, and in [[Zhitomir]] Local History Museum. A number of important canvases by foreign artists are possessed by the museums of [[Poltava]], [[Sumy]], [[Lutsk]], [[Uzhgorod]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2504">In [[linguistics]], [[language]]s are often studied in terms of six major subsystems, which relate to major subfields within linguistics. In addition, particular subfields of linguistic inquiry may divide their subject matter into more specific subsystems. This list contains links to commonly studied language subsystems.

== Major subsystems ==

Linguists recognize seven major language subsystems:

* [[Phonetics]], the [[sound]]s of human [[speech]], including their physiological production, acoustic properties, auditory perception, and neurophysiological status;
* [[Phonology]], the systematic use of sound to encode meaning in any spoken [[human language]] ([[natural language]] or [[constructed language]]);
* [[Morphology (linguistics)|Morphology]], the structure of meaningful units of a language, such as [[word]]s and [[affix]]es;
* [[Syntax]], the principles and rules for constructing [[phrase]]s, [[clause]]s, and the like in human languages;
* [[Semantics]], the [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaningful]] content of words, [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentences]], or other language elements;
* [[Pragmatics]], the ways in which [[Context (language use)|context]] contributes to meaning in natural language use; and
* [[Lexicology]], the study of words.

This division varies among linguists and authors. For example, phonetics and phonology are occasionally merged into one subsystem. Morphology and lexicology can also be merged.

== Sociolinguistics ==

* The term ''[[Variety (linguistics)|variety]]'' in [[sociolinguistics]] is used as a cover term for dialects, registers, and other forms of language, including standard languages.
** [[Dialect]] refers to a variety that is used by a particular group of speakers.
** [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|Accent]] refers to a specific system of pronunciation.
** [[Idiolect]] refers to the variety that is used by an individual speaker.
** [[Register (sociolinguistics)|Register]] or [[Stylistics (linguistics)|style]] refer to a variety that is used in a particular setting or for a particular purpose.
** [[Standard language]] is a variety promoted by some social group, either officially or unofficially, as the preferred form.
* [[Abstand and ausbau languages]] are concepts developed by sociolinguists to describe related language varieties, ranging from dialects of a single language to distinct languages.

The '''Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics''' is located in [[Tübingen]], [[Baden-Württemberg]], [[Germany]]. It is one of 80 institutes in the [[Max Planck Society]] (Max Planck Gesellschaft).

The institute is studying signal and information processing in the brain. We know that our brain is constantly processing a vast amount of sensory and intrinsic information by which our behavior is coordinated accordingly. How the brain actually achieves these tasks is less well understood, for example, how it perceives, recognizes, and learns new objects. The scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics aim to determine which signals and processes are responsible for creating a coherent percept of our environment and for eliciting the appropriate behavior. Scientists of three departments and seven research groups are working towards answering fundamental questions about processing in the brain, using different approaches and methods.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7062">The '''National Children’s Study''' (NCS) was a longitudinal [[cohort study]] that planned to recruit participants from across the United States of America. It was intended to measure the many factors that contribute to [[health]] and disease from before birth through age 21. This included, but was not limited to, the search for drivers of diseases with prenatal or developmental origins. The Study was closed in December 2014.&lt;ref name=Science121214&gt;{{cite news|author1=Jocelyn Kaiser|title=NIH cancels massive U.S. children’s study|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/funding/2014/12/nih-cancels-massive-u-s-children-s-study|accessdate=December 16, 2014|work=Science|date=December 12, 2014|quote=has too many flaws to be carried out in a tight budget environment, advisers today told National Institutes of Health (NIH) Director Francis Collins.

==Organization==
The NCS was led by the [[National Institutes of Health]], with the [[Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development|''Eunice Kennedy Shriver'' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development]] (NICHD) serving as the scientific lead. Within NICHD, the NCS Program Office administered the implementation of day-to-day Study operations. The Program Office was supervised by the Study Director, Steven Hirschfeld, MD, PhD Associate Director for Clinical Research, NICHD.

For advice and recommendations regarding Study framework, content, and methodologies, the NCS Program Office engaged external advisors and scientific groups. These groups included federal partners such as the NCS Federal Advisory Committee and a Federal Consortium with representatives from multiple federal agencies including: the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]], the [[National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences|National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences of the National Institutes of Health]], the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], and the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]]. An independent Study Monitoring and Oversight Committee monitored study progress and participant safety.

In addition to these more formal channels, the NCS solicited feedback from subject matter experts from around the world and from individuals, community advocates, and professional societies concerned with child health. The NCS Program Office also provided public forums for input on a variety of initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalchildrensstudy.gov/about/organization/Pages/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Congressional Mandate==
The "President’s Task Force on Health Risks and Safety Risks to Children" recommended this federal initiative in 1999, after which Congress passed the [[Children's Health Act]] of 2000 (Title X, Section 1004). The Act charged NICHD to:

# plan, develop, and implement a [[prospective cohort study]], from birth to adulthood, to evaluate the effects of both chronic and intermittent exposures on child health and human development; and
# investigate basic mechanisms of developmental disorders and environmental factors, both risk and protective, that influence health and developmental processes.

The Act required this NCS to:
# incorporate behavioral, emotional, educational, and contextual consequences to enable a complete assessment of the physical, chemical, biological, and psychosocial environmental influences on children’s well-being;
# gather data on environmental influences and outcomes on diverse populations of children, which may include the consideration of prenatal exposures; and
# consider health disparities among children, which may include the consideration of prenatal exposures&lt;ref&gt;National Institutes of Health [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2011-05-02/html/2011-10500.htm New Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Neuropsychosocial Measures Formative Research Methodology Studies for the National Children's Study] Federal Register, vol 76, No. 84, May 2, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objective==
The NCS was designed to examine the effects of the environment—broadly defined to include factors such as air, water, diet, sound, family dynamics, community, and cultural influences— and [[genetics]] on the growth, [[child development|development]], and health of children across the United States. The NCS was designed to follow approximately 100,000 children, some from before birth, through age 21 years. The NCS planned to collect comprehensive information to:
# contribute to improving the health and well-being of all children
# deepen our understanding of the contribution of various factors to a range of health and disease outcomes
# understand factors that lead to health disparities.

With this broad perspective, the NCS was designed to contribute to the implementation of health equity, where each individual has an opportunity to realize their health potential.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalchildrensstudy.gov/about/overview/Pages/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discontinued==
The NCS was in its Vanguard, or [[pilot study|pilot]] phase, which was designed to assess the feasibility, acceptability, cost, and utility of Study scientific output, logistics, and operations prior to initiating the Main Study. The Vanguard Study enrolled about 5,000 children in 40 counties across the United States. General recruitment was completed in July 2013.

On December 12, 2014, the National Children’s Study closed, after an expert review committee advised the NIH Director that moving forward with the larger Main Study would not be the best way to add to the understanding of how environmental and genetic factors influence child health and development.&lt;ref&gt;National Children’s Study (NCS) Working Group [http://acd.od.nih.gov/reports/NCS_WG_FINAL_REPORT.pdf FINAL REPORT – DECEMBER 12, 2014]  National Institutes of Health, Advisory Committee to the Director, 19 pages&lt;/ref&gt;

The NCS will not collect any new information from participants.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The NIH plans to make data already collected available to researchers in late 2015.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

'''Neo-primitivism''' was a Russian [[art movement]] which took its name from the 31-page pamphlet ''Neo-primitivizm'', by [[Aleksandr Shevchenko|Aleksandr]] {{harvtxt|Shevchenko|1913}}. In the pamphlet Shevchenko proposes a new style of modern painting which fuses elements of [[Cézanne]], [[Cubism]] and [[futurism (art)|Futurism]] with traditional Russian '[[folk art]]' conventions and motifs, notably the [[russian icon]] and the [[lubok]].

==Neo-primitive artists==
Russian artists associated with Neo-primitivism include:

*[[David Burlyuk]]
*[[Marc Chagall]]
*[[Pavel Filonov]]
*[[Natalia Goncharova]]
*[[Mikhail Larionov]]
*[[Kasimir Malevich]]
*[[Aleksandr Shevchenko]]
*[[Igor Stravinsky]]

{{hatnote|The term ''opposing force'' is occasionally used to refer to a genuine military foe. This article is concerned only with its use in simulated conflict.}}
{{more citations needed|date=November 2009}}
[[File:OPFOR Soldiers.jpg|thumbnail|right|300px|U.S. OPFOR Soldiers at [[Fort Polk]], Louisiana]]
An '''opposing force''' (abbreviated '''OPFOR''' or '''enemy force''') is a [[military unit]] tasked with representing an enemy, usually for training purposes in [[War exercise|war game]] scenarios. The related concept of [[aggressor squadron]] is used by some air forces. The United States maintains the [[Fort Irwin National Training Center]] with the [[11th Armored Cavalry Regiment]] serving in the main OPFOR role. Other major units include the [[First United States Army]] which consists of 16 training brigades that often also serve as OPFOR. [[Fort Polk]]'s Joint  Readiness Training Center is another major training site typically reserved for units that are slated to deploy into conflict areas.

At a basic level, a unit might serve as an opposing force for a single scenario, differing from its 'opponents' only in the objectives it is given. However, major armies commonly maintain specialized groups trained to accurately emulate real-life enemies, to provide a more realistic experience for their training opponents. (To avoid the diplomatic ramifications of naming a real nation as a likely enemy, training scenarios often use fictionalized versions with different names but similar military characteristics to the expected real-world foes.)

==Tactics==
Opposing forces can also coincide with [[red team]]ing activities. Once the Analytic Red Team develops adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) it will be the opposing force that makes use of those TTPs in wargames and exercises.

Some dedicated opposing forces may fight using the likely enemy's doctrine, weapons, and equipment. They may wear uniforms which resemble the likely enemy's, or one dissimilar to "friendly forces". Their vehicles may either be those operated by the likely enemy's, or may be modified to look like those. All these measures help to enhance training realism and provide useful lessons on how to fight this particular enemy.

[[Blank ammunition]], [[smoke grenade]]s, and [[artillery]] simulators are often used by both sides in the exercise to provide the [[fog of war]] caused by the noise and smoke of battle.

In addition, a simulation system such as the [[Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System]] (MILES) may be used. This system is attached to various weapons, and are zeroed to the sights of the weapon. When a blank round is fired, the system sends out a laser beam, which score "kills" or "injuries" on any soldier or vehicle in what would be the path of the weapon's projectile. These laser beams are detected by receivers on harnesses worn by the soldiers, or on the vehicle itself.

Alternatively, [[paintball]] weapons which look like real weapons, or simulation rounds such as [[plastic bullet]]s may be used. Usually, controllers follow the training troops to help score additional kills, such as when a simulated grenade is thrown. They may do so with the MILES system using a controller gun. All these measures help to emphasize the importance of aimed fire, and taking cover. These concepts, while obvious, are often neglected in ordinary one-sided training exercises because the soldier does not suffer the consequences.

==Units==

[[File:OPFOR Training.JPG|thumbnail|OPFOR Training 2012]]
[[File:MT-LB US Marines.jpg|thumb|[[US Marines]] using a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[MT-LB]] vehicle for the OPFOR role during an exercise]]
One of the best-known examples of specialist operations is the [[United States]]' OPFOR. During the [[Cold War]], opposing force units employed [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military doctrine and simulated Soviet equipment; since the fall of the USSR, US opposing force units have become more flexible to represent a wider range of opponents. More recently training has focused on Iraq and Afghanistan.

There are three Major Training Centers that utilize home-based OPFOR units for the [[US Army]]:

*The [[National Training Center]] or ''NTC'' at [[Fort Irwin, California]]—home unit is the [[11th Armored Cavalry Regiment]] (the ''Blackhorse'')
*The [[Fort Polk#JRTC moves to Polk|Joint Readiness Training Center]] or ''JRTC'' at [[Fort Polk, Louisiana]]—home unit is the 1st Battalion, 509th Parachute Infantry Regiment (the ''Geronimos'')
*The [[Joint Multinational Readiness Center]] or ''JMRC'' (formerly known as the Combat Maneuver Training Center or CMTC) at Hohenfels, Germany&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hohenfels.army.mil Army.mil]&lt;/ref&gt;—home unit is the 1st Battalion, 4th Infantry Regiment (Separate) (the ''Warriors'')

[[File:Operation_force_Surrogate_Vehicle.jpg|thumb|An OSV replicating a Soviet BMP at NTC, Fort Irwin, CA]]
The units at NTC and JMRC were used to replicate a Soviet Motorized Rifle regiment or division. At NTC, [[M551 Sheridan]]s were used to replicate Soviet [[T-80]] tanks until 2003.  [[vismod|Visually Modified]] (VISMOD) [[HMMWV]]s are used to replicate [[BRDM-2]]s, VISMOD [[M113 armored personnel carrier#Basic variants|M113A3]]s (known as the OPFOR Surrogate Vehicle [OSV]) are used to replicate [[BMP-2]] Infantry Fighting Vehicles (IFV), while VISMOD [[M1 Abrams]] Tanks (known as the Krasnovian Variant Tank [KVT]) and M113A2s (known as the OPFOR Surrogate Vehicle, Tank [OSV-T]) are also used to replicate the [[T-80]]. At JMRC, M113A2s are used to replicate Soviet BMP-2s and [[M60 Patton#M60A3 series|M60A3]] tanks are used to replicate Soviet T-80s.

During the mid-1990s, JMRC was used to train peacekeeping forces for the former [[Yugoslavia]] under low-intensity conflict missions.  Currently, the OpFor mission has since been modified for counter-insurgency training for [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] and [[Operation Enduring Freedom]].

Starting in early 2004, NTC began focusing on training units selected to deploy to [[Iraq]] or [[Afghanistan]] in [[Urban Operations|urban operations]] (UO). Towns of ever increasing size and complexity have been constructed throughout the training area to provide battlefield realism and housing for the hundreds of role-playing personnel, many of whom speak [[Arabic language|Arabic]] or [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] natively, and replicate civilians on the battlefield while wearing Afghan or Iraqi clothing. Cultural awareness and liaison operations with local leaders are emphasized at all times and at all levels.

Various US military installations and/or major units have their own local versions of opposing force used for training exercises. The joint Australian/US military exercise "Crocodile '03" featured an Australian-led opposing force in which soldiers from a range of Australian units worked together with a [[US Marine Corps]] contingent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Exercise Crocodile '03: You win some, you lose some | author = John Wellfare | url = http://www.defence.gov.au/news/armynews/editions/1084/features/feature01a.htm | publisher = Army: The Soldiers' Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several [[state defense force]]s have served as OPFOR units when training with the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]]. The [[California State Military Reserve]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://4thmpbnpmo.com/opfor.htm |title=OPFOR |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher=1st Battalion (MP), 2nd Brigade (Civil Support), California State Military Reserve |access-date=16 November 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Georgia State Defense Force]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Seay |first=Howard, WO1 |last2= |first2= |date= |title=Operation Roughrider Cold |url=http://issuu.com/allanhayesgsdf/docs/headsup_june2015 |journal=Heads Up |publisher=Georgia State Defense Force |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=3 |doi= |access-date=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; have provided OPFOR services to their respective National Guard counterparts.

The [[British Army]] rotates units through [[British Army Training Unit Suffield]] as OPFOR.

The [[Republic of Korea Army|South Korean army]] utilizes a regiment-sized OPFOR unit replicating the [[Korean People's Army Ground Force|North Korean Army]] infantry force at the [[Korea Combat Training Center]].

===Private OPFOR companies===
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}
There are a number of private companies that provide OPFOR services to support the training missions of various military units. As the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan come to a close, the use of private training forces are on the rise in the Department of Defense. OPFOR companies supplement the existing training programs in a number of ways.{{which|date=November 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6159">The '''Oxyrhynchus Gospels''' are two fragmentary [[manuscript]]s discovered among the rich finds of discarded [[papyri]] at [[Oxyrhynchus]] in Egypt. Unknown to most laymen, they throw light on early [[non-canonical]] [[Gospel]] traditions.

==Oxyrhynchus 840==
'''Oxyrhynchus 840''' (P. Oxy. V 840), found in 1905, is a single small [[vellum parchment]] leaf with 45 lines of text written on both sides in a tiny neat hand that dates it to the 4th century, almost square, less than 10&amp;nbsp;cm across. It is kept at the [[Bodleian Library]], MS. Gr. th. g. 11 (P).&lt;ref name="bodl"&gt;{{cite web|title=MSS. Greek theology (Gr. th.)|url=http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/dept/scwmss/wmss/online/medieval/greek/gr-th.html|publisher=[[Bodleian Library]]|accessdate=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The text probably predates 200, but no more is determinable from this evidence. In his introduction in ''The Complete Gospels'', [[Philip Sellew]] notes that this fragment was likely a [[amulet|talisman]] text, kept as an [[amulet]], perhaps worn around the neck. [[Michael J. Kruger]] who did his PhD dissertation on this fragment &lt;ref&gt;[[Larry Hurtado]], Lord Jesus Christ, Eerdman Publishing 2003, p 439, footnote 40&lt;/ref&gt; concludes that this could not be an amulet but rather a miniature [[codex]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael J Kruger, [[Journal of Theological Studies]] 53 (2003), p 93&lt;/ref&gt; The text itself has been dated to the first half of the second century. Sellew calls it "similar to the New Testament gospels in its style and tone."

The fragment begins with the end of a warning to an evildoer who plans ahead, yet fails to take the next life into account. There follows sections of a narrative unparalleled in any other known gospel tradition, about Jesus' encounter with "a Pharisee, a leading priest" who tries to order Jesus and the disciples out of the Temple as ritually unclean. Jesus responds by contrasting ritual cleanliness, gotten by bathing with water used by dogs and pigs, like a harlot, against the life-giving water that comes down from heaven in baptism.

Jesus is called "[[wiktionary:Savior|Savior]]" ({{lang-el|Σωτήρ}}), which is rare in the New Testament, but not unparalleled.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''Luke'' 1:69, 2:11; ''John'' 4:42; ''Acts'' 5:31, 13:23&lt;/ref&gt; The author of the fragment also believes that laymen have to change their clothes to enter the temple, for which there is no other evidence. The author is distinctly hostile to Judaism, but as he knows little about it, the text is presumably not from Judea; the author's vague grasp of details of [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] rituals have suggested a [[Johannine]] circle, perhaps in Syria.&lt;ref&gt;Sellew's note to 2:2; for Syria, see [http://www.maplenet.net/~trowbridge/oxy840.htm Geoff Trowbridge, "The Oxyrhynchus 840 Gospel"].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oxyrhynchus 1224==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Jesus Seminar]] --&gt;
'''Oxyrhynchus 1224''' (P. Oxy. X 1224), now at the [[Bodleian Library]], MS. Gr. th. e. 8 (P),&lt;ref name="bodl" /&gt; consists of two small [[papyrus]] fragments from the late 3rd or early 4th century. It contains six passages, each about a sentence. Two of the longer ones are parallel to Mark 2:17 and Luke 9:50, but the differences in phrasing show they are textually independent of the Gospels. A precise date for composition is unknown; 50 is possible,&lt;ref&gt;Miller's introduction, ''Complete Gospels'', p.416, and notes to fragments 5 and 6.&lt;/ref&gt; though a date of around 150 AD. is more widely accepted by scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Craig A. Evans, Ph.D., Fabricating Jesus: How Modern Scholars Distort the Gospels, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Dominic Crossan]] notes the mutilated condition in his introduction to the fragmentary text in ''The Complete Gospels'' resulting in highly conjectural reconstructions of the text, which, however, "does not seem to be dependent on the New Testament gospels.... As an independent gospel, it belongs, insofar as its fragmentary state allows us to see, not with discourse gospels involving the risen Jesus (e.g., the ''[[Secret Book of James]]'' and the ''[[Gospel of Mary]]''), but with sayings gospels involving the earthly Jesus (e.g., [[Q document]] and the ''[[Gospel of Thomas]]''). Crossan suggests that the document might have been written as early as the mid-first century.

'''The Pan-European Institute''' (PEI) ([[Finnish language|Finnish]] ''Pan-Eurooppa Instituutti'') is a [[Finland|Finnish]] research institute at [[Turku School of Economics]], in [[Turku]], Finland. PEI observes developments within the European economy and business with special interest lies on the [[Baltic Sea]] region and its neighbouring countries such as [[Russia]], [[Belarus]], and [[Ukraine]]. Kari Liuhto is director and is assisted by an [http://www.tse.fi/EN/units/specialunits/pei/Pages/Advisory-Board.aspx advisory board] of 12 members. The Pan-European Institute celebrates its 25th anniversary in 2012 by organising a high-level seminar "[http://www.tse.fi/EN/UNITS/SPECIALUNITS/PEI/Pages/AnniversarySeminar.aspx The  Baltic Sea region 2025]". 

== Research, education, and partnerships ==
The research conducted by PEI is for external purposes, as well as internal. Cooperation has been successful on the national arena with the Academy of Finland, several Finnish ministries, the [[Parliament of Finland]] and the Prime Minister’s Office. Abroad, partners have been the [[European Commission]], the [[European Parliament]], the [[United Nations]], and the [[World Bank]].

The research also provides a foundation for the education provided at Turku School of Economics at the University of Turku. The Pan-European Institute provides several university courses in English within the subject of [http://www.tse.fi/EN/units/departmentsandunits/kv/Pages/default.aspx International Business]. The institute is also a partner of the [http://europeanstudies.utu.fi/studies/ European Studies programme] and the [http://balticstudies.utu.fi/nondegree/businessandsociety/ Baltic Sea Business &amp; Society programme].

Research at PEI has five focus areas:
* Economic and business development in the Baltic Sea region 
* Economic relations between EU and its bordering nations with special attention on Russia, [[Kaliningrad]], and the [[Northern Dimension]]
* [[Foreign direct investment]] (FDI) inflow into and outflow from Russia 
* Regional and social development in Europe 
* [[Small and medium enterprises]] (SMEs) in the EU and its eastern neighbours

== Economic and security monitoring ==
PEI especially monitors economic development in these areas:
* '''The Baltic Sea region''': The quarterly discussion forum [http://www.tse.fi/EN/units/specialunits/pei/economicmonitoring/bre/Pages/default.aspx Baltic Rim Economies (BRE)] focuses on the development of the Baltic Sea region. In BRE, high-level public and corporate decision makers, representatives of academia and several other experts participate.
* '''Russian regions''' and '''regional centres''' as well as [http://www.tse.fi/EN/units/specialunits/pei/economicmonitoring/emergingmarkets/Pages/default.aspx '''European emerging markets''']: for these markets, PEI provides visual information packages with economic information in a nutshell. The packages are mainly aimed at foreign investors and international companies.
* '''International operations of Russian firms''': Due to increased significance of Russian companies in Finland, the Pan-European Institute follows [http://www.tse.fi/EN/units/specialunits/pei/economicmonitoring/russianfirms/Pages/default.aspx international operations of Russian firms] and their impact on Finnish business.

Through a partnership with the Finnish Ministry for Foreign Affairs, PEI has monitored the security development (2010-2011) in Europe. The regions covered in this [http://www.tse.fi/FI/yksikot/erillislaitokset/pei/Documents/Regional%20Security%20Report%20II_final.pdf biannual review] are the Western CIS (Moldova, Ukraine, Belarus), the South Caucasus (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia) and Central Asia (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tadzhikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan).

'''Personnel selection''' is the methodical process used to hire (or, less commonly, [[promotion (rank)|promote]]) individuals. Although the term can apply to all aspects of the process ([[recruitment]], selection, hiring, acculturation, etc.) the most common meaning focuses on the selection of workers. In this respect, selected prospects are separated from rejected applicants with the intention of choosing the person who will be the most successful and make the most valuable contributions to the organization.&lt;ref name=Muchinsky&gt;Muchinsky, P. (2012). ''Psychology Applied to Work'', (10th ed.). Summerfield, N
klu
C: Hypergraphic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Its effect on the group is discerned when the selected accomplish their desired impact to the group, through achievement or tenure. The procedure of selection takes after strategy to gather data around a person so as to figure out whether that individual ought to be utilized. The strategies used must be in compliance with the various laws in respect to work force selection.

==Overview==
The professional standards of [[industrial psychology|industrial-organizational psychologists]] (I-O psychologists) require that any selection system be based on a [[job analysis]] to ensure that the selection criteria are job-related. The requirements for a selection system are characteristics known as KSAOs – knowledge, skills, ability, and other characteristics. US law also recognizes ''[[bona fide occupational qualifications]]'' (BFOQs), which are requirements for a job which would be considered discriminatory if not necessary – such as only employing men as wardens of maximum-security male prisons, enforcing a mandatory retirement age for airline pilots, or a religious college only employing professors of its religion to teach its theology.&lt;ref name=Muchinsky/&gt;

Personnel selection systems employ evidence-based practices to determine the most qualified candidates and involve both the newly hired and those individuals who can be promoted from within the organization.&lt;ref name=Muchinsky/&gt;

In this respect, selection of personnel has "validity" if an unmistakable relationship can be shown between the system itself and the employment for which the people are ultimately being chosen for. In this way, a vital piece of selection is Job Analysis. An analysis is typically conducted before, and regularly apart of, the improvement in determination systems. Then again, a selection method may be deemed valid after it has already been executed by directing follow up job analysis and demonstrating the relationship between the selection process and the respective job.&lt;ref name="Muchinsky" /&gt;

The procedure of personnel selection includes gathering data about the potential candidates with the end goal of deciding suitability and sustainability for the employment in that particular job. This data is gathered utilizing one or more determination devices or strategies classified as such:&lt;ref name="Muchinsky" /&gt; 
* Interviews
* Personality Tests
* Biographical Data
* Cognitive Ability Tests
* Physical Ability Tests
* Work Samples
Development and implementation of such screening methods is sometimes done by human resources departments; larger organizations hire consultants or firms that specialize in developing personnel selection systems. I-O psychologists must evaluate evidence regarding the extent to which selection tools predict job performance, evidence that bears on the validity of selection tools. These procedures are usually validated (shown to be job relevant), using one or more of the following types of [[validity (statistics)|validity]]: [[content validity]], [[construct validity]], and/or [[criterion validity|criterion-related validity]].&lt;ref name="Muchinsky" /&gt;

==History and development==
[[Imperial examination|Chinese civil servant exams]], established in AD 605, may be the first documented "modern" selection tests, and have influenced subsequent examination systems.&lt;ref&gt;

As a scientific and scholarly field, personnel selection owes much to [[psychometric]] theory and the art of integrating selection systems falls to [[human resources|human resource professionals]].

In the [[United States of America]], members of the [http://www.siop.org Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology (SIOP)] conduct much of the research on selection. Primary research topics include:

* the practicality, reliability, validity, and utility of various forms of selection measures
* methods for demonstrating return on investment for selection systems
* assessing fairness and making selection systems as fair as possible
* legal issues&amp;mdash;such as [[disparate treatment]] and [[disparate impact]]&amp;mdash;and overall compliance with laws
* the generalizability of validity across different work contexts
* alternative methods of demonstrating validity, such as synthetic validity&lt;ref&gt;Steel, P. (2006). [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=889965 From the work one knows the worker: A systematic review of the challenges, solutions, and steps to creating synthetic validity]. ''International Journal of Selection and Assessment'', '''14(1)''', 16-36.
&lt;/ref&gt;
* the predictive validity of non-traditional measures, such as personality

== Validity and reliability ==
=== Validity of interviews ===
The validity of interviews describes how useful interviews are in predicting job performance. In one of the most comprehensive meta-analytic summary to date by Weisner and Cronshaw (1988). The authors investigated interview validity as a function of interview format (individual vs board) and degree of structure( structure vs unstructured). Results of this study showed that structured interviews yielded much higher mean corrected validities than unstructured interviews (0.63 vs 0.20), and  structured board interviews using consensus ratings had the highest corrected validity (0.64).

In&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Comprehensive Review and Meta- analysis of the Validity of Interviews|last = McDaniel, Whetzel, Schmidt &amp; Maurer's|first = |date = 1994|journal = Journal of Applied Psychology Vol.79. No. 4, 599 – 616.|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; McDaniel, Whetzel, Schmidt &amp; Maurer's  Comprehensive Review and Meta- analysis of the Validity of Interviews (1994) paper, the authors go a step further and  include an examination of the validity of three different types of interview content(situational, job-related, and psychological).Their goal was to explore the possibility that validity is a function of the type of content collected.

They define the three kinds of content as follows – situational content was described as interview questions that get information on how the interviewee would behave in specific situations presented by the interviewer. For example, a question that asks whether the interviewee would choose to report a coworker for behaving in an unethical way or just let them go. Job related questions, on the other hand, assess the interviewee's past behavior and job-related information. While psychological interviews include questions intended to assess the interviewee's personality traits such as their work ethic, dependability, honesty etc.

The authors conducted a meta-analysis of all previous studies on the validity of interviews across the three types of  content mentioned above. Their results show that for job-performance criteria, situational interviews yield higher mean validity(0.50) than do job-related interviews(0.39) which yield a higher mean validity than do psychology interviews(0.29). This means that when the interview is used to predict job performance, it is best to conduct situational interviews rather than job-related or psychological interviews. On the other hand, when interviews are used to predict an applicant's training performance, the mean validity of job-related interviews(0.36) is somewhat lower than the mean validity of psychological interviews(0.40).

Going beyond the content of the interview, the authors' analysis of interview validity was extended to include an assessment of how the interview was conducted. Here, two questions emerged – Are structured interviews more valid than unstructured interviews ? and are board interviews( with more than one interviewer) more valid than individual interviews.

Their answer  to the first question – Are structured interviews more valid unstructured interviews was that structured interviews, regardless of content, is more valid(0.44) than unstructured interviews(0.33) in predicting job performance criteria. However, when training performance is the criteria, the validity of structured and unstructured interviews are similar (0.34 and 0.36).

As for the validity of board interviews versus individual interviews, the researchers conducted another meta-analyses comparing the validity of board interviews and individual interviews for job performance criteria. The results show that individual interviews are more valid than board interviews( 0.43 vs 0.32). This is true regardless of whether the individual interview is structured or unstructured.

When exploring the variance in interview validity between job performance, training performance, and tenure criteria, the researchers found that the interviews are similar in predictive accuracy for job-performance and training performance( 0.37 vs 0.36). But less predictive for tenure (0.20).

=== Validity of cognitive ability and personality tests ===
Based on meta-analysis results, cognitive ability tests appear to be among the most valid of all psychological tests and are valid for most occupations. However, these tests tend to do better at predicting training criteria than long term job performance. Cognitive ability tests in general provide the benefit of being generalizable. Hence they can be used across organizations and jobs and have been shown to produce large economic gains for companies that use them (Gatewood &amp; Feild, 1998; Heneman et al., 2000).

But despite the high validity of cognitive testing, it is less frequently used as selection tools. One main reason is that cognitive ability testing has been demonstrated to produce adverse impact. In general, groups including Hispanics and African-Americans score lower than the general population while other groups including Asian – Americans score higher (Heneman et al., 2000; Lubenski, 1995). The legal issues with cognitive ability testing were amplified by the supreme court's ruling in the famous 1971 Griggs v. Duke Power case. In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that when a selection test produces adverse impact against protected group members the company must be able to defend it by showing that use of the test is a "business necessity" for the operation of the business. The courts have held narrow interpretations of business necessity that require companies to show that no other acceptable selection alternative exists (Sovereign, 1999). As a result, many companies abandoned cognitive ability testing ( Steven L. Thomas &amp;Wesley A. Scroggins, 2006).

While the utility of cognitive ability testing in selection has been broadly accepted, the utility of personality testing, until relatively recently, has not. Historically, research documenting the low predictive validity and the potential for invasion of privacy based on item content has made its application as selection instruments questionable (Hogan, Hogan, &amp; Roberts, 1996).

But due to the legal challenges associated with cognitive ability, interest in personality instruments has recently been revived (Schmidt, Ones, &amp; Hunter, 1992). Some have suggested that pairing personality testing with cognitive ability testing may be one means to enhance validity while reducing adverse impact (Ryan, Ployhart, &amp; Friedel, 1998). Because it is very likely that some aspects of personality enhance individual ability to apply intellectual capacity while other personality traits limit its application (Kaufman &amp; Lichtenberger, 1999). Hence, adding a personality to an ability test should enhance validity while reducing the adverse impact of a selection system.

Recent research studies prove this assumption to be false, by showing that the addition of a predictor producing smaller group differences (i.e., personality test) to a predictor producing higher group differences (i.e., cognitive ability test) does not reduce the potential for adverse impact to the degree that is often expected (Bobko, Roth, &amp; Potosky, 1999; Schmitt, Rogers, Chan, Sheppard, &amp; Jennings, 1997).

Although the use of personality tests with measures of cognitive ability may not have the desired effects on reducing adverse impact, it appears that the addition of personality measures to measures of cognitive ability as a composite predictor results in significant incremental validity (Bobko et al., 1999; Schmitt et al.,1997). These studies found that the validity of predictor composites was highest when alternative predictors were used in combination with cognitive ability. Though this combination of predictors resulted in the highest predictive validity, the inclusion of cognitive ability with these alternative predictors increased the potential for adverse impact (Steven L. Thomas &amp; Wesley A. Scroggins, 2006).

In summary, cognitive ability testing by itself has been shown to have high levels of validity, but comes with issues relating to adverse impact. Personality tests, on the other hand, have historically been proven to have low validity due to the lack of a common understanding on what constitutes personality, and the non-standardized measures available. But a growing number of research  studies show that the best way for organizations to achieve close to optimal validity and job performance prediction, is to create a predictor composite that includes a measure of cognitive ability and an additional measure such as a personality test.

==Predictor validity and selection ratio==
Two major factors determine the quality of newly hired employees, [[predictive validity|predictor validity]] and [[selection ratio]].&lt;ref name=Muchinsky/&gt; The predictor cutoff is a test score differentiating those passing a selection measure from those who did not. People above this score are hired or are further considered while those below it are not.

The selection ratio (SR), on the other hand is the number of job openings [[statistical sample|''n'']] divided by the number of job applicants ''N''. This value will range between 0 and 1, reflecting the selectivity of the organization's hiring practices. When the SR is equal to 1 or greater, the use of any selection device has little meaning, but this is not often the case as there are usually more applicants than job openings. Finally, the [[base rate]] is defined by the percentage of employees thought to be performing their jobs satisfactorily following measurement.

==Selection decisions==
Tests designed to determine an individual's aptitude for a particular position, company or industry may be referred to as personnel assessment tools. Such tests can aid those charged with hiring personnel in both selecting individuals for hire and in placing new hires in the appropriate positions. They vary in the measurements they use and level of standardization they employ, though all are subject to error.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Labor Employment and Training Administration. (1999) "Chapter 1: Personnel Assessment." pp. 1-7 [http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/psych304-3.1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Predictors for selection always have less than perfect validity and scatter plots, as well as other forecasting methods such as judgmental bootstrapping, and index models can help us to refine a prediction model as well as identify any mistakes.&lt;ref name=Muchinsky/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Armstrong|first=J. Scott|last2=others|date=2012|title=Predicting job performance: The moneyball factor|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/J_Armstrong2/publication/254416540_Predicting_Job_Performance_The_Moneyball_Factor/links/0046352826eef7b0cc000000.pdf|journal=Foresight: The International Journal of Applied Forecasting|volume=25|pages=31–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The criterion cutoff is the point separating successful and unsuccessful performers according to a standard set by the hiring organization. [[Type I and type II errors|True positives]] are applied those thought to succeed on the job as a result of having passed the selection test and who have, in fact, performed satisfactorily. True negatives describe those who were correctly rejected based on the measure because they would not be successful employees.

False negatives occur when people are rejected as a result of selection test failure, but would have performed well on the job anyway.&lt;ref name=Muchinsky/&gt; Finally, false positives are applied to individuals who are selected for having passed the selection measure, but do not make successful employees. These selection errors can be minimized by increasing the validity of the predictor test.

Standards for determination of the cutoff score vary widely, but should be set to be consistent with the expectations of the relevant job.&lt;ref name=Muchinsky/&gt; Adjusting the cutoff in either direction will automatically increase the error in the other. Thus, it is important to determine which type of error is more harmful on a case-by-case basis.

Banding is another method for setting cutoff values.&lt;ref name=Muchinsky/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campion, M. A., Outtz, J. L., Zedeck, S., Schmidt, F. L., Kehoe, J. F., Murphy, K. R., &amp; Guion, R. M. (2001). [http://www.krannert.purdue.edu/faculty/campionm/Controversy_Score_Banding.pdf The controversy over score banding in personnel selection: Answers to 10 key questions]. ''Personnel Psychology'', '''54(1)''', 149–185.&lt;/ref&gt; Some differences in test scores are ignored as applicants whose scores fall with in the same band (or, range) are selected not on the basis of individual scores, but of another factor spas to reduce adverse impact. The width of the band itself is a function of test reliability, the two being negatively correlated. Banding allows employers to ignore test scores altogether by using random selection, and many have criticized the technique for this reason.

==Predicting job performance==
A meta-analysis of selection methods in personnel psychology found that [[g factor (psychometrics)|general mental ability]] was the best overall predictor of [[job performance]] and training performance.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, F. L. &amp; Hunter, J. E. (1998). [http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=1998-10661-006&amp;CFID=5257837&amp;CFTOKEN=93267042 The validity and utility of selection methods in personnel psychology: Practical and theoretical implications of 85 years of research findings]. ''Psychological Bulletin'', '''124(2)''', 262-274.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding interview procedures, there are data which put into question these tools for selecting employees.&lt;ref&gt;McDaniel, M. A., Whetzel, D. L., Schmidt, F. L., &amp; Maurer, S. D. (1994).[http://www.people.vcu.edu/~mamcdani/Publications/McDaniel_Whetzel_Schmidt_Maurer%20(1994).pdf The validity of employment interview: A comprehensive review and meta-analysis]. ''Journal of Applied Psychology'', '''79(4)''', 599-616.&lt;/ref&gt; While the aim of a job interview is ostensibly to choose a candidate who will perform well in the job role, other methods of selection provide greater predictive power and often entail lower costs. Unstructured interviews are commonly used, but structured interviews tend to yield better outcomes and are considered a better practice.&lt;ref&gt;Huffcut, A. I. (2010). [http://www.xavier.edu/appliedhrmresearch/2010-Winter/Article_8_Huffcutt_Seven%20Principles.pdf From science to practice: Seven principles for conducting employment interviews]. ''Applied H.R.M. Research'', '''12''', 121-136.&lt;/ref&gt;

Interview structure is defined as "the reduction in procedural variance across applicants, which can translate into the degree of discretion that an interviewer is allowed in conducting the interview."&lt;ref&gt;Huffcut, A. I., &amp; Hunter, W. Jr. (1994). [http://maamodt.asp.radford.edu/PSYC%20651/Huffcutt%20&amp;%20Arthur%20(1994)%20Interview.pdf Hunter &amp; Hunter revisited: Interview validity for entry-level jobs]. '' Journal of Applied Psychology'', '''79''', 184-190.&lt;/ref&gt; Structure in an interview can be compared to a typical paper and pencil test: we would not think it was fair if every test taker were given different questions and a different number of questions on an exam, or if their answers were each graded differently. Yet this is exactly what occurs in an unstructured interview; thus, a structured interview attempts to standardize this popular selection tool.

Multiple studies and meta-analyses have also been conducted to look at the relationship between [[organizational citizenship behavior| organizational citizenship behavior (OCB)]] and organizational performance and success.&lt;ref name=Muchinsky/&gt;&lt;ref name=Podsakoff&gt;Podsakoff, N. P., Whiting, S. W., Podsakoff, P. M., &amp; Mishra, P. (2011). [http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=pdh&amp;AN=apl-96-2-310&amp;site=ehost-live Effects of organizational citizenship behaviors on selection decisions in employment interviews]. ''Journal of Applied Psychology'', '''96(2)''', 310-326.&lt;/ref&gt; Job candidates exhibiting higher levels of helping, voice, and loyalty behaviors were generally rated as more confident, received higher salaries, and received higher salary recommendations than job candidates exhibiting these behaviors to a lesser degree.&lt;ref name=Podsakoff/&gt; This was found to be true even candidate responses regarding task performance were taken into account. Finally, content analyses of open-ended question responses indicated selection decisions were highly sensitive to candidates with low expression of voice and helping behaviors.

'''Physical literacy''' is a fundamental and valuable human capability that can be described as a disposition acquired by human individuals encompassing the motivation, confidence, physical competence, knowledge and understanding that establishes purposeful physical pursuits as an integral part of their lifestyle.&lt;ref name=Almond&gt;{{cite journal|last=Almond|first=L|author2=Whitehead, M|title=Physical Literacy: Clarifying the Nature of the Concept|journal=Physical Education Matters|year=2012|volume=7|issue=1|issn=1751-0988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fundamental and significant aspects of physical literacy&lt;ref name=Whitehead&gt;{{cite book|last=Whitehead|first=M|title=Physical Literacy throughout the Lifecourse|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=London and New York|isbn=0-415-48743-9|pages=12–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  are:

* everyone can be physically literate as it is appropriate to each individual’s endowment
* everyone’s physical literacy journey is unique
* physical literacy is relevant and valuable at all stages and ages of life
* the concept embraces much more than physical competence
* at the heart of the concept is the motivation and commitment to be active
* the disposition is evidenced by a love of being active, born out of the pleasure and satisfaction individuals experience in participation
* a physically literate individual values and takes responsibility for maintaining purposeful physical pursuits throughout the lifecourse.
* charting of progress of an individual’s personal journey must be judged against previous achievements and not against any form of national benchmarks

==General==

The concept of physical literacy has been developed over many years. It is seen, by a growing number of people, as the goal of the school subject, [[physical education]]. However, whilst this is extremely relevant, it is important to recognise that physical literacy is not restricted to the school years – it is relevant throughout the lifecourse.  In this respect, six phases of physical literacy have been identified: infancy, childhood, adolescence, young adulthood, adulthood and older adulthood.&lt;ref name="Whitehead &amp; Murdoch"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Whitehead|first=M|author2=Murdoch, E|journal=Physical Education Matters|year=2006|volume=1|issue=1|issn=1751-0988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the past few years there has been considerable interest, worldwide, in the concept of physical literacy. In Great Britain, a number of local authorities have adopted it as an overall guiding principle for their work in school-based physical education. In countries such as Northern Ireland and Canada, physical literacy has been the focus for considerable rethinking in respect of children’s physical development and has consequently been the inspiration behind the development of new programmes. In [[India]] this principle has been adapted by [[Sportism]]&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; for training the [[Indian people|Indian]] kids on the basis of Physical literacy concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sportism.co.in|title=Sportism - Multi-Sports Training|website=www.sportism.co.in|access-date=2016-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Multi-Sport Programme for Children|last=TImes|first=Adyar|date=May 22, 2016|work=|via=News Paper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there have been a number of interpretations of the concept that have moved away from the central tenets of physical literacy. For example, in some instances physical literacy has been the name given to a programme of fundamental movement skills, implying that the concept is solely about the acquisition of physical competence. Other interpretations have focused on knowledge and understanding, particularly in the games context. Both these scenarios include elements of physical literacy, but do not represent the whole story.&lt;ref name="Almond"/&gt;

==Attributes==

A physically literate individual will display the following attributes:&lt;ref name="Almond"/&gt;

* Physical literacy can be described as a disposition characterised by the motivation to capitalise on innate movement potential to make a significant contribution to the quality of life.
* All human beings exhibit this potential. However, its specific expression will depend   on individuals’ endowment in respect of all capabilities, significantly their movement potential, and will be particular to the culture in which they live.
* Individuals who are physically literate will move with poise, economy and confidence in a wide variety of physically challenging situations
* Physically literate individuals will be perceptive in ‘reading’ all aspects of the physical environment, anticipating movement needs or possibilities and responding appropriately to these with intelligence and imagination
* These individuals will have a well-established sense of self as embodied in the world. This, together with an articulate interaction with the environment, will engender positive self-esteem and self-confidence
* Sensitivity to and awareness of embodied capability will lead to fluent self-expression through non-verbal communication and to perceptive and empathetic interaction with others
* In addition, physically literate individuals will have the ability to identify and articulate the essential qualities that influence the effectiveness of their own movement performance, and will have an understanding of the principles of embodied health with respect to basic aspects such as exercise, sleep and nutrition

==Physical Literacy Worldwide==

===Canada===
'''Physical literacy''' is the mastering of fundamental movement skills and fundamental sport skills that permit a child to read their environment and make appropriate decisions, allowing them to move confidently and with control in a wide range of physical activity situations. It is the foundation of long-term participation and performance to the best of one’s ability. Physical Literacy is the cornerstone of both participation and excellence in physical activity and sport. Ideally, physical literacy is developed prior to the [[Adolescent development|adolescent growth spurt]].&lt;ref&gt;Physical Literacy | Canadian Sport for Life: http://www.canadiansportforlife.ca/learn-about-canadian-sport-life/physical-literacy&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fundamental Movement Skills and Fundamental Sport Skills'''

To become physically literate children need to master the 13 fundamental movement skills:&lt;ref name="cs4l"&gt;Balyi, I., Way, R., Norris, S., Cardinal, C. &amp; Higgs, C. (2005). Canadian sport for life: Long‐term athlete development resource paper. Vancouver, BC: Canadian Sport Centres.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Locomotor and Body Skills:'''
* [[Walking]]
* [[Running]]
* [[Balance (ability)|Balance]]
* [[Ice skating|Skating]]/[[Skiing]]
* [[Jumping]]
* [[Swimming (sport)|Swimming]]
* [[Cycling]]
* [[Skipping rope|Skipping]]

'''The Sending Skills'''
* Throwing
* [[Kick (football)|Kicking]]
* Striking

'''The Receiving Skills'''
* Catching
* Trapping

Each skill will involve a series of developmental stages that the child will go through in order to master that particular skill.
Fundamental Sport Skills involve using Fundamental Movement Skills in a sport specific setting (i.e. a child can kick a ball, this is a Fundamental Movement Skill; when she kicks a penalty kick in a soccer game, she has used this skill as a Fundamental Sport Skill, the skill of kicking a penalty kick).&lt;ref name="DPL"&gt;Higgs, C., Balyi, I. &amp; Way, R. (2008). Developing physical literacy: A guide for parents of children ages 0 to 12: A supplement to Canadian sport for life. Vancouver, BC: Canadian Sport Centres.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Four Environments'''

To develop physical literacy children should learn fundamental movement skills and fundamental sport skills in each of the four basic environments:
# On the ground: as the basis for most games, sport, dance and physical activities
# In the water: as the basis for all aquatic activities
# On snow and ice: as the basis for all winter sliding activities
# In the air: basis for [[gymnastics]], [[Diving (sport)|diving]] and other aerial activities&lt;ref name="cs4l" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DPL" /&gt;

The interdependencies of politicians and media are known as the [[politico-media complex]].

Of doubtful virtue, declining amounts of content and substance can easily be compensated by giving news stories a [[sensationalist]]ic twinge. Politainment thus ranges on the same level as [[edutainment|edu-]] and [[infotainment]].

Typical catchlines in politainment reports or media will at times bluntly argue ''[[ad hominem]]'' in a generalizing manner and try to emphasize virtues and [[charisma]] ("''xyz'' will [[Make America Great Again|make America great again]]") or vices and weaknesses (by [[denunciation]]: "''xyz'' will wreck this country"). The latter example is also known as [[fear appeal]]. More moderate forms make extensive use of [[ambiguity|imprecise]], [[metaphoric]] language ([[allegories]], [[metonymy]], [[periphrase]]s, [[kenning]]s etc.).

Politainment can be both a communication aspect of (1) [[politician]]s and [[spin doctor]]s to their and their party's own advantage and the political adversary's disadvantage or (2) a strategy for [[news]] [[publisher]]s, [[journalist]]s, etc., to promote their medium and journalistic work.

Politainment may be a factor in [[party identification]], mass-influencing [[voter]]'s choices, it has thus become an indispensable tool in [[political campaign]]s and [[election]]s.&lt;ref name=blackwell/&gt;&lt;ref name=schultz&gt;David Schultz, Politainment, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; As such it can also be one of the—seemingly innocuous—ingredients of [[crowd manipulation]] up to [[political warfare|political]] [[psychological warfare]].

'''Political sophistication''' is a construct in the field of [[political psychology]]. It concerns the extent to which a person has knowledge of political activity, assimilates information and forms political views. One of the earliest uses of the term was by Robert C Luskin in his paper Explaining Political Sophistication (1990).

Luskin writes "Terminology varies, but the name on which the literature seems to be settling on is political sophistication" &lt;ref name="jstor 586188 p331-361"/&gt;

"A person is politically sophisticated to the extent to which his or her political cognitions are numerous, cut a wide substantive swath, and are highly organised, or "constrained"&lt;ref name="jstor 586188 p331-361"/&gt;

Political sophistication has important implications for [[Democracy|democratic theory]]. Luskin wrote in 1987 "that by anything approaching elite standards, the American public is extremely unsophisticated about politics and has not become appreciably more so over the last two and a half decades" adding that "other publics, abroad, are similarly unsophisticated." This low political sophistication he argues is damaging to the "democratic ideal" as "the less sophisticated the public, the less alert to its interests, the less active in pursuit of them" and crucially "the less resistant to manipulation from above" &lt;ref name="jstor 586188 p331-361"/&gt;

Research in the field of political sophistication has focused on identifying the contributing factors to differing levels across public masses. Luskin investigated the effects of: 
* exposure - what political information they receive
* motivation - their interest in learning about politics
* intelligence - their ability to assimilate and organise such information

He found that interest was the most influential variable to political sophistication summarising that "we learn about the things we care about" before continuing "education is probably the prime predictor of dependent variables reflecting political interest".&lt;ref name="jstor 586188 p331-361"/&gt;

However the teaching of politics in UK schools has been a controversial topic. A report by [[OFSTED]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] found that classes in citizenship that were made compulsory in 2002 were "something that teachers often shy away from – possibly because of the understandable concern that they will be perceived to demonstrate bias"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Garner|first1=Richard|title=Teachers reluctant to teach politics for fear of bias|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/teachers-reluctant-to-teach-politics-for-fear-of-bias-1875463.html|website=independent.co.uk|accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other ways to increase political sophistication have been tested by John Gastill and James Dillard. They found a positive link between increasing political sophistication and increasing public deliberation through National Issues Forums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gastill|title=Increasing Political Sophistication Through Public Deliberation|date=1999|volume=16|pages=2–23|ssrn=2747796}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political sophistication has been shown to moderate political orientation. Researchers Becky L. Choma and Carolyn. L Hafer showed "that the association between explicit and implicit political orientation was moderated by political knowledge scores, such that the positive association was stronger among participants with a greater knowledge of politics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hafer|first1=Carolyn. L|last2=Choma|first2=Becky L.|title=Understanding the relation between explicitly and implicitly measured political orientation: The moderating role of political sophistication|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|date=2009|volume=47|issue=8|pages=964–967|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2009.07.024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5252">The '''Premier's Reading Challenge''' is a literacy initiative developed by Australian state governments. It is set not as a competitive event, but rather as an individual challenge to each student, as well as to promote a love of reading books.&lt;ref&gt;[http://education.qld.gov.au/schools/readingchallenge/about.html About the challenge] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007024026/http://education.qld.gov.au/schools/readingchallenge/about.html |date=2007-10-07 }}&lt;br&gt;- [http://www.education.vic.gov.au/prc/default.htm Premier's Reading Challenge - Home - Reading Challenge - Department of Education and Early Childhood Development]&lt;br&gt;- [https://products.schools.nsw.edu.au/prc/faqs.html#about1 NSW Premier's Reading Challenge 2008 : Frequently Asked Questions]&lt;br&gt;- http://www.premiersreadingchallenge.sa.edu.au/prc/files/links/PRC_pamphlet_A5.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The challenge is run in [[New South Wales]], [[Queensland]], [[South Australia]], and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. In [[Western Australia]], a similar program called the '''Premier's Summer Reading Challenge''' was cancelled in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.det.wa.edu.au/education/events/readingChallenge/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tasmania]]'s Labor government joined the other states in 2008.

The Premier's Reading Challenge in [[South Australia]], launched by Premier [[Mike Rann]] (2002 to 2011) has one of the highest participation rates in the world for reading challenges. It has been embraced by more than 95% of public, private and religious schools.&lt;ref&gt;Center for National Policy, Washington DC, What States Can Do, May 2, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Guidelines==
The guidelines for the program in each state differ slightly, but students must generally read a minimum of books within a certain number of books, within a certain amount of time. In some states, these books must be a combination of personal choice books and books from a pre-selected list of approved literature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.premiersreadingchallenge.sa.edu.au/prc/pages/books/guidelines Premiers Reading Challenge]&lt;br&gt;- [http://education.qld.gov.au/schools/readingchallenge/guidelines.html 2007 Guidelines] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007024155/http://education.qld.gov.au/schools/readingchallenge/guidelines.html |date=2007-10-07 }}&lt;br&gt;- [http://www.education.vic.gov.au/prc/about/rules.htm Rules - Reading Challenge - Department of Education and Early Childhood Development]&lt;br&gt;- [https://products.schools.nsw.edu.au/prc/rules.html NSW Premier's Reading Challenge 2008 : Challenge Rules]&lt;/ref&gt;

In South Australia the Premier's Reading Challenge involves students aged between 5 and 14 in reading a minimum of 12 books (but often many more) upon which they are tested for comprehension. At the end of their first year in the Challenge successful students receive a certificate signed by the Premier. At the end of the second year they receive a bronze medal. Then, in subsequent years, silver, gold, "legend" and "hall of fame". Top sports stars, celebrities and children's authors are appointed Premier's Reading Challenge Ambassadors and visit schools to promote the program and read to students. Former Premier Mike Rann, who proposed the Ambassadors and medal components of the scheme, said the medals and end of year medal ceremonies at schools contributed to the success of the program. "At first the younger children love the idea of the medals but then they fall in love with the books", Rann said.&lt;ref&gt;Center for National Policy, Washington DC: What States Can Do, 3 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==In special needs schools==
The NSW Premier's Reading Challenge has been used at Mary Brooksbank School, to help give the pupils with intellectual difficulties as many educational opportunities as are possible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/equal-opportunity-for-all-students/2007/09/08/1188783558455.html Equal opportunity for all students - National - smh.com.au&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The 50 students which attend the school have all successfully completed the challenge in two consecutive years. Many of the students cannot read independently, and so the books on the list were read to them by the teachers.

==In the news==
In 2005, the Victorian Premier's Reading Challenge attracted over 130,000 students, with 60,000 of them meeting the requirements for the award by reading 12 books in the set time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/books/premiers-reading-challenge-attracts-60000/2005/08/20/1124435182574.html Premier's reading challenge attracts 60,000 - Books - Entertainment]&lt;/ref&gt; In six months, over 1,000,000 books were read by the students.

The ''Sun-Herald'' provided an online section of its website which provides links to articles which can be used as part of the personal choices reading by students in the New South Wales Reading Challenge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.classscoop.sunherald.com.au/readingchallenge.asp Sun Herald Class Scoop&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]  {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20060819214340/http://www.classscoop.sunherald.com.au/readingchallenge.asp |date=2006-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2891">{{Governance}}

'''Simulation governance''' is a managerial function concerned with assurance of reliability of information generated by [[numerical simulation]].  The term was introduced in 2011 &lt;ref&gt;Szabó B. and Actis R. Simulation governance: New technical requirements for software tools in computational solid mechanics International Workshop on Verification and Validation in Computational Science University of Notre Dame 17–19 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and specific technical requirements were addressed from the perspective of mechanical design in 2012 &lt;ref&gt;Szabó B. and Actis R. Simulation governance: Technical requirements for mechanical design. Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Engrg. 249–252 158–168, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Its strategic importance was addressed in 2015 &lt;ref&gt;Meintjes K.  [https://www.nafems.org/publications/resource_center/bm_jan_15_1/ Simulation Governance: Managing Simulation as a Strategic Capability]. NAFEMS Benchmark Magazine, January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Imbert J-F.  [https://www.nafems.org/publications/resource_center/nwc15_100/ Simulation Governance - Building confidence, a key dimension of simulation strategy]. NAFEMS World Congress NWC15 San Diego, June 2015. &lt;/ref&gt;.  At the [https://www.nafems.org/congress/ 2017 NAFEMS World Congress] in Stockholm simulation governance was identified as the first of eight “[https://www.nafems.org/congress/thebigissues/ big issues]” in [[numerical simulation]].

Simulation governance is concerned with (a) selection and adoption of the best available simulation technology, (b) formulation of [[mathematical models]], (c) management of experimental data, (d) data and solution [[Verification and validation of computer simulation models#Verification|verification]] procedures, and (e) revision of mathematical models in the light of new information collected from physical experiments and field observations &lt;ref&gt;Oberkampf WL and Pilch M. [https://www.nafems.org/publications/resource_center/r0121/ Simulation Verification and Validation for Managers]. NAFEMS, 2017. {{ISBN|978-1-910643-33-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

A plan for simulation governance has to be tailored to fit the mission of each organization or department within an organization: If that mission is to apply established rules of design and [[certification]] then emphasis is on solution verification and [[standardization]]. If, on the other hand, that mission is to formulate design rules, or make condition-based maintenance decisions, then [[Verification and validation of computer simulation models|verification, validation]] and [[uncertainty quantification]] must be part of the plan.

{{italic title}}
'''''Smith's Bible Dictionary''''', originally named ''A Dictionary of the Bible'', is a 19th-century [[Bible]] dictionary containing upwards of four thousand entries that became named after its editor, [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]]. Its popularity was such that condensed dictionaries appropriated the title, "Smith's Bible Dictionary".

The original dictionary was published as a three-volume set in 1863, in London and [[Boston, USA]]. This was followed by ''A Concise Dictionary of the Bible'' (1865), intended for the general reader and students, and ''A Smaller Dictionary of the Bible'' (1866), for use in schools. ''A Comprehensive Dictionary of the Bible'' (1868), was published simultaneously in London and New York, and a four-volume ''Dictionary of the Bible'' (1871), was published in Boston, amongst other things incorporating the appendices of the first edition into the main body of the text.

In the UK, a corresponding second edition of the first volume in two parts, edited by Smith and [[J. M. Fuller]], was published in 1893.

The original publications are now in the [[public domain]]; some derivative, commercial versions are still in copyright.

One of the contributors to the dictionary was [[George Edward Post]] (of the [[American University of Beirut]] (AUB)).&lt;ref&gt; Robert E. Thompson. {{Google books|KV6vCwAAQBAJ|A History of the Presbyterian Churches in the United States|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''sports school''' ({{lang-ru|Детско-Юношеская Спортивная Школа, ДЮСШ}}) is a type of educational institution for children that originated in the [[Soviet Union]].

==Establishment and early years==
The system of sports schools was founded in the 1930s. In 1934, [[Young Pioneers Stadium]] was built in [[Moscow]], the first specialized sports extracurricular institution in the USSR. In the same year the first children's collective was established by [[Dynamo (sports society)|Dynamo sports society]]; this was a prototype of sports schools by [[Voluntary Sports Societies of the USSR|sports societies]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dynamo.org.ru/history/99.html Ого Вфсо "Динамо" - Всероссийское Физкультурно-Спортивное Общество "Динамо"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220165626/http://dynamo.org.ru/history/99.html |date=2008-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935-1936, the first sports schools were opened in Moscow, [[Leningrad]] and other cities of the USSR; they were created and functioned on the basis of regulations, approved by the Central Soviet of Sports Societies and Organizations of the USSR.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.educom.ru/ru/publications/press/system/review.php Хрнпхвеяйхи Нагнп Бнгмхймнбемхъ Х Пюгбхрхъ Яхярелш Бмеьйнкэмнцн Напюгнбюмхъ Б Лняйбе - Деоюпрюлемр Напюгнбюмхъ Ц. Лняйбш&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1940s dozens of schools functioned in the USSR by [[Dynamo (sports society)|Dynamo sports society]], [[Spartak (sports society)|Spartak sports society]], [[PFC CSKA Moscow|CDKA]], sports societies of Trade Unions, [[OSOAVIAKHIM]] and in the system of education. After the [[Great Patriotic War]], sports schools were frequently reorganized, transferred from the jurisdiction of sports societies to that of the system of education and vice versa.

Separate from these were two national sports universities under government operation: the Leningrad and Moscow Sports Institutes, which were the major sports institutions for adult level national athletes.

==Olympic Reserve specialized (complex) schools==
After the USSR joined as a full member of the [[International Olympic Committee]] in 1951, Specialized Children and Youth (Sports) Schools of the Olympic Reserve ({{lang-ru|Специализированная Детско-Юношеская (Спортивная) Школа Олимпийского Резерва, СДЮ(С)ШОР}}) began to be opened to prepare young athletes for the sports of highest achievements. The number of such sports schools grew, as did the number of sports disciplines within sports schools. They included not only [[Olympic sports]], but also national sports disciplines as well as tourism, [[orienteering]], and other sports. As an alternative there is also Complex Specialized Children and Youth School of the Olympic Reserve ({{lang-uk|Комплексна Спеціалізована Дитячо-Юнацька Школа Олімпійського Резерву, КСДЮШОР}}).

==Schools of Higher Sports Mastery==
Aside of regular sports schools and specialized schools of Olympic Reserve, there are also schools of higher sports mastery ({{lang-uk|Школа вищої спортивної майстерності, ШВСМ}}).

== Regional boarding schools of sports profile (Schools of Olympic Reserve) ==

Before 1989 in the Soviet Union existed a network of regional boarding schools of sports profile ({{lang-ru|ОШИСП, Областная школа-интернат спортивного профиля}}).&lt;ref name=fiskalov&gt;Fiskalov, V. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=61v3CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT401&amp;lpg=PT401&amp;dq=%D0%9E%D0%A8%D0%98%D0%A1%D0%9F&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1tivxxnwZs&amp;sig=-L-j0EU0BvhDVvgcD6qBOgdXt-Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj4p9qgmYraAhWJ24MKHdDjA0cQ6AEIQDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=%D0%9E%D0%A8%D0%98%D0%A1%D0%9F&amp;f=false Theoretical foundations and organization of athlete training (Теоретические основы и организация подготовки спортсменов)''. Litres, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Children live, study and receive advanced sports training there. Sports boarding schools can be either one-sport-oriented or multisports. In those schools children spend most of their time off studying practicing sports or perfecting certain skills. In 1989 all sports boarding schools were converted to schools of Olympic Reserve, UOR ({{lang-ru|училище олимпийского резерва, УОР}}).&lt;ref name=fiskalov/&gt;

==Structure==
Sports schools were compatible with the administrative division of the country: there were District, City, Oblast, Central, Republican sports schools. To enter sports school, a child could have a recommendation from one's secondary school; children were also invited to come into a certain sports school for the selection during lessons in an ordinary school, or they could come for the selection on their own initiative. In accordance with specifics of different sports disciplines, the age of children and youth admitted into a sports school was between 8 and 14. Groups were organized according to [[Unified Sports Classification System of the USSR|ranks of athletes]]: there were separate groups for Second-Class Junior Sportsmen, First-Class Junior Sportsmen, Second-Class Sportsmen, First-Class Sportsmen, Candidates for Master of Sports of the USSR, Masters of Sports of the USSR. Term of study in each group was one to two years, with different sports normatives applied in each year.&lt;ref name="GSE"/&gt;

==Popularity==
By 1971 there were 3,813 sports schools in the USSR, with some 1.3 million children and youth training there. These included 2,434 schools with one million attendees under the jurisdiction of the system of education and 1,245 schools with 340,000 attendees functioning in the system of sports societies.&lt;ref name="GSE"&gt;[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]], 3rd ed., [http://slovari.yandex.ru/dict/bse/article/00022/84400.htm entry on sports schools]&lt;/ref&gt; And by 1991, some 6,000 sports schools functioned in the USSR.

== Criticism ==

Sports schools, especially the Olympic reserve ones have been in the spotlight of several scandals related to child abuse. In their strive to get the best out of children, a lot of coaches resort to verbal abuse as well as severe and sometimes sadistic physical punishments. The situation is even worse in sports boarding schools where parents exercise little control and children are fully under the coaches' authority.

Another disadvantage of this system is that much more attention is paid to sports than school education. Sports boarding schools of Olympic reserve received the sarcastic nickname "hit-and-run" ({{lang-ru|бей-беги}}; not be confused with a traffic accident or a baseball play), meaning that children mostly hit footballs and ran around sports fields instead of studying.

==Sports schools in post-Soviet states==
After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|break-up of the USSR]], the system of children and youth sports in Russia passed through difficult times, but managed to retain the network of sports schools, and Physical Training Clubs (DYuKFP) were created in addition to them.

In 2005 some 4,951 sports schools and DYuKFPs functioned in the system of education and in the system of Rossport. To the former belonged 2,944 institutions of physical culture and sports education: 1,917 sports schools, 464 Specialized sports schools of the Olympic Reserve, 556 DYuKFPs and 7 centers for physical culture. Only sports schools of the system of education were attended by some 2 million children and youth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ed.gov.ru/files/materials/1635/Sved_ob_uchregd.doc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716060824/http://www.ed.gov.ru/files/materials/1635/Sved_ob_uchregd.doc |archivedate=2011-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and they had more than 13,000 departments in 122 sports disciplines. Rossport institutions were attended by some one million young athletes.

==Sports schools in other countries==
[[File:Singapore Sports School 20, Jul 07.JPG|thumb|200px|right|[[Singapore Sports School]] ]]
Soviet experience of mass children and youth sports education was applied by Eastern Europe an countries, in particular East Germany, where they were called ''Kinder- und Jugendsportschule (KJS)''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Naul | first = Roland |author2=Hardman, Ken | title = Sport and Physical Education in Germany | pages = 61 | year = 2002 | publisher = [[Routledge]] | url = https://books.google.com/books?q=suitable+entry+children+youth+KJS | isbn = 0-419-25390-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, [[Katarina Witt]] and [[Sven Fischer]] attended such schools. Similar sports schools were established in the [[People's Republic of China]], [[North Korea]] and [[Cuba]] (called Schools for Sports Initiation there),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =  Rhoden | first = William C. | title = PAN AMERICAN GAMES; The Secret of Cuba's Sports Success?

At the present time some 3,000 sports schools exist in the People's Republic of China, including full-time ones, and this system is essentially based on the powerful system of sports schools of the USSR.&lt;ref name="Rev"/&gt;

There are a number of sports schools in Asian countries. These include [[Singapore Sports School]] in Singapore and [[Bukit Jalil Sports School]] in [[Kuala Lumpur]], Malaysia. Both of these  schools were established after end of the Soviet Union (1991).

'''Strategic Foresight Group''' ('''SFG''') is a [[think tank]] based in India that works on global issues. It was established in 2002.

SFG has worked with governments and national institutions of 60 countries from around the world. It produces scenarios and policy concepts that have been discussed in the [[United Nations Security Council]], [[Parliament of India]], the [[European Parliament]], [[Oxford University]], [[Cambridge University]], [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]], [[House of Lords]], [[World Bank]], [[World Economic Forum]], [[United Nations Alliance of Civilizations]], and others.

[[Sundeep Waslekar]] is the President of Strategic Foresight Group. Ilmas Futehally is the Vice President and Executive Director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Aam_Aadmi/In_search_of_the_solution/id07articleshow/2271026.cms |title=In Search of Solution, The Times of India, 10 August 2007 |access-date=7 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725194912/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Aam_Aadmi/In_search_of_the_solution/id07articleshow/2271026.cms |archive-date=25 July 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The founding of SFG coincided with a period of oscillating developments in India-Pakistan relations. SFG produced an assessment of the [[cost of conflict]] between the two countries. India's then External Affairs Minister [[Yashwant Sinha]], in a [[suo moto]] letter addressed to the President of SFG, described it as a valuable tool for the practitioners of foreign policy. SFG went on to undertake a similar exercise for [[Sri Lanka]]. This report too attracted considerable attention.&lt;ref&gt;Hindustan Times, September 2006, Sri Lanka is the Most Militarised Society [http://www.strategicforesight.com/sfgnews_186.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, its report, The Final Settlement&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strategicforesight.com/publications_research.htm#finalsettlement The Final Settlement]&lt;/ref&gt; created a public debate; for the first time it identified the centrality of the water dimension in the [[India-Pakistan relations]].&lt;ref&gt;Philip Bowring in the New York Times on SFG's report The Final Settlement [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/07/opinion/07iht-edbow.html]&lt;/ref&gt; It was translated into [[Urdu]] as well as [[Marathi language|Marathi]].

While SFG focused on [[South Asia]] including [[India]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/msid-2282296,prtpage-1.cms|title=How to ensure freedom from future shock - The Economic Times|work=The Economic Times|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in its initial period, it has since widened the scope of its work to address [[terrorism]], [[clash of civilizations]], [[cost of conflict]], [[water security]] and global governance issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/indopak-conflict-positive-costs-zero-benefits/103689/|title=Indo-Pak Conflict: Positive Costs, Zero Benefits|work=The Financial Express|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, SFG convened a [[roundtable]] to prepare a common intellectual framework for deconstructing terror. Since then SFG has been invited by Prime Ministers, Ministers of Foreign Affairs and governments of several countries in [[North America]], [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and the [[Middle East]] for policy consultations.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Naumann Stiftung and Alliance and Liberals and Democrats in the European Parliament [http://www.fnst-freiheit.org/uploads/1404/3rdRTReport.pdf]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2005, SFG and the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats in Europe, jointly convened a roundtable at the [[European Parliament]], [[Brussels]], involving serving and former cabinet ministers and parliamentarians from the Middle East and [[Europe]]. The roundtable adopted the [http://www.strategicforesight.com/wir-secrt_brusselsconsensus.htm [[Brussels]] Consensus] on the principles and policies for a safer world. At the roundtable, Dr. Wolfgang Gerhardt, Chairman of the [[Friedrich Naumann Foundation]], said "Strategic Foresight Group has a track record in exploring value-based working solutions to the problems of society. This is their intention here (at the 3rd Roundtable). It is also our intention at the FNSt."&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Wolfgang Gerhardt, Chairman of the Friedrich-Naumann-Foundation, speaking at the European Parliament, Brussels, 26 November 2007 [http://www.fnst-freiheit.org/webcom/show_article.php/_c-705/_nr-135/printmode-true/i.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==2006–2007: West-Islam relations==
The [http://www.strategicforesight.com/wir-thirdroundtable.htm Third International Roundtable]  was organised by Strategic Foresight Group and the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe]] at the European Parliament, Brussels, on 26–27 November 2006. The Roundtable was endorsed by the [[League of Arab States]]. It engaged important public institutions from the Western and Islamic worlds.&lt;ref&gt;Comments on the theme paper of the Second International Roundtable on Constructing Peace, Deconstructing Terror {{cite web |url=http://www.iran-daily.com/1384/2411/html/national.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325221347/http://www.iran-daily.com/1384/2411/html/national.htm |archivedate=25 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 40 leaders from Europe, Asia and the Middle East participated in the Roundtable. They included serving [[cabinet ministers]], former ministers, leaders of [[parliamentary]] groups, special envoys of the heads of [[multilateralism|multilateral]] organisations and directors of important institutions. The distinguished group recommended an Inclusive Semi Permanent Conference on Peace in the Middle East, Western Islamic Dialogue and Engagement Initiative, International Historical Study Group on Common Human Civilisation, Arab Islamic [[Renaissance]] Initiative and the promotion of the Compact of Dialogue-Democracy-Development. The Roundtable welcomed the Report of the High Level Group of the [[Alliance of Civilizations]] of the [[United Nations]].

At the beginning of 2007 Strategic Foresight Group brought out its global research report ''An Inclusive World: in which the West, Islam and the Rest have a stake''. Prof [[Shlomo Ben-Ami]], former Foreign Minister of [[Israel]] describes this "as the most comprehensive approach to solve the crisis of our time that has ever been proposed." Prof Kamel Abu Jaber, former Foreign Minister of [[Jordan]], calls it "hope in an otherwise hopeless international system." The philosophy of An Inclusive World could be subject of a new global debate to overcome the divides at the beginning of the 21st [[century]]. The report was debated by [[Oxford University]] at one of the famous Oxford Union debates in May. It also featured three times in the debates at the House of Commons. The European Parliament and the League of Arab States circulated it widely among their members. It was translated into Arabic by the [[Bibliotheca Alexandrina]] based in Alexandria, [[Egypt]].

Speaking on the Middle East at the World Economic Forum's Middle East Summit, [[Sundeep Waslekar]] said that the region's primary risk is a "triple deficit" – a democratization deficit combined with a development deficit leads to a dignity deficit, often manifested in instability and violence.

One of the main conclusions of the Third International Roundtable was a proposal for the Inclusive Semi Permanent Conference for the Middle East. In 2008 SFG brought out a position paper on this subject, which was launched at the [[House of Lords]] in May 2008.

==2008: Peace and Security ==
In 2008, SFG continued its work in the [[Cost of conflict]] series, this time focussing on the Middle East,&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.gulfnews.com/articles/09/02/13/10285092.html Gulf News, 12 February 2009] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180520053309/https://gulfnews.com/news/mena/palestine/conflict-bleeds-middle-east-dry-1.51284 |date=20 May 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in alignment with its other work. The report on ''Cost of Conflict in the Middle East'' was launched at the United Nations office in Geneva in January 2009. It featured in floor debates in the House of Commons and House of Lords. It was discussed by a panel of ministers and senior diplomats at the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations when the latter hosted its forum in Istanbul in April 2009. The report was also discussed at the World Economic Forum Middle East summit at the Dead Sea in May 2009. It has since featured in several hundred newspapers, websites and blogs.&lt;ref&gt;The Cost of Enduring Middle East Conflict is Prohibitive, Tom Dine, 30 March 2009 [http://www.israelpolicyforum.org/blog/cost-enduring-middle-east-conflict-prohibitive] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505232356/http://www.israelpolicyforum.org/blog/cost-enduring-middle-east-conflict-prohibitive |date=5 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yementimes.com/article.shtml?i=1231&amp;p=business&amp;a=1  Review of Cost of Conflict in the Middle East in the Yemen Times] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608070405/http://www.yementimes.com/article.shtml?i=1231&amp;p=business&amp;a=1 |date=8 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, SFG came out with a report on 20 trends that would affect global security and economy in the next 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiawaterportal.org/Network/interview/ngos/devika_eng.html  Interview with Devika Mistry on Water Scarcity] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715185212/http://indiawaterportal.org/Network/interview/ngos/devika_eng.html |date=15 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2008, SFG expanded the scope of its work with an international conference on Responsibility to the Future. It was co-hosted by the [[United Nations Global Compact]], inaugurated by the [[President of India]] and attended by experts from 25 countries. Following the recommendations of the conference, SFG decided to address issues of water security in Asia&lt;ref&gt;[http://asiasecurity.macfound.org/news/entry/ Strategic Foresight Group Launches Project on Water Security] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727051824/http://asiasecurity.macfound.org/news/entry/ |date=27 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Middle East.

==2009–2014: Water security==
In 2009, SFG decided to focus on preventing conflicts arising out of resource scarcity, with focus on water.

An international workshop on Water Stress and Climate Change in the Himalayan River Basins was organised in August 2009 in [[Kathmandu]] bringing together experts and policy makers on water issues from [[China]], [[Nepal]], [[Bangladesh]] and [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;First International Workshop on Water Stress and [[Climate Change]] in Asia [http://www.strategicforesight.com/Kathmandu%20Report.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The Second International Workshop was held in [[Dhaka]] in January 2010. It resulted in the Dhaka Declaration on [[Water Security]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bdnews24.com/details.php?id=151168&amp;cid=2|title=bdnews24.com|publisher=|accessdate=9 July 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220192301/http://www.bdnews24.com/details.php?id=151168&amp;cid=2|archivedate=20 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dhaka Declaration highlights the significance of the rivers that flow from the [[Himalayas]] and the urgent need for cooperation between Basin countries. It has been predicted that due to the combined effect of melting of glaciers, extreme weather events and pollution, the rivers in the Eastern Himalayas will lose their flow from anywhere from 5 to 20 percent by 2050. This will have affect river flows mostly in the lean period, undermining plans to produce [[hydroelectricity]] and promote inland water navigation in the region.

The Dhaka Declaration proposes an exchange of scientific data, particularly in the low flow period and joint research projects. It underscores the risk of conflicts due to [[water scarcity]] and floods leading to migration on a large scale. A report titled ''The Himalayan Challenge: Water Security in Emerging Asia''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strategicforesight.com/publication_pdf/85801himalayan-challenge.pdf  The Himalayan Challenge: Water Security in Emerging Asia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Wall Street Journal, 20 August 2010, India can't talk away inflation [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703579804575441020169731944?mod=googlenews_wsj]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Times of India, 25 July 2010, Water Wars: India, China and the Great Thirst [http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-07-25/special-report/28308457_1_water-wars-water-resources-water-deficit]&lt;/ref&gt; was published in June 2010. This report is the first of its kind which evaluates future water balance and risks in India, China, Nepal and Bangladesh until the year 2030. A second report titled ''Himalayan Solutions'' was published in January 2011.

In February 2010, an  international initiative on Water Security in the Middle East was launched at Montreux, Switzerland, on 15–16 February, with two workshops attracting the participation of 60 leading policymakers, including members of Parliament, former Cabinet Ministers, senior leaders of Water Commissions and heads of research institutions from across the Middle East. In preparation for the workshops, SFG had held consultations with leaders in the Middle East, and distinguished experts from several countries in the region.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.strategicforesight.com/conference_pdf/57307Montreux%20Report-Final%20-%20Feb.%202010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A workshop was held in Sanliurfa, a town in [[Turkey]] close to the Syrian border to discuss collaborative solutions to the issue of water security in the Middle East. Participants at the level of former Ministers and heads of Departments in Water Ministries participated in the workshop. A report titled ''The Blue Peace: Rethinking Middle East Water'' was launched by the [[President of Switzerland]], [[Micheline Calmy-Rey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emwis.org/thematicdirs/news/2011/02/new-strategic-foresight-group-report-blue-peace-rethinking-middle-east-water|title=Euro-Mediterranean Information System on know-how in the Water sector - International portal|publisher=|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/feb/20/arab-nations-water-running-out|title=What does the Arab world do when its water runs out?|author=John Vidal|work=the Guardian|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jordantimes.com/?news=33830  Jordan Times, 25 January 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=207898  Jerusalem Post, 12 February 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=433959&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=36&amp;parent_id=16  Gulf Times, 11 May 2011] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120923085529/http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=433959&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=36&amp;parent_id=16 |date=23 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, a High-Level Group was established under the Chairmanship of HRH Prince [[Hassan bin Talal of Jordan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strategicforesight.com/HLG-%20Jordan%20Times.pdfSite_Id=1&amp;lang=2&amp;NewsID=66309&amp;CatID=13&amp;Type=Home&amp;GType=1  The Jordan Times, 11 April 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, SFG began addressing the issue of sustainable and collaborative solutions to the [[Nile River]] Basin in [[Africa]]. The Nile has been governed by agreements that date back to colonial times and give [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]] majority share of water. The Nile Basin Countries have drafted a new Cooperative Framework Agreement (CFA) to replace the old agreements. This has created tensions between riparian countries. SFG organised a workshop in [[Zurich]] in early 2012 bringing together members of parliaments, diplomats and scholars from these regions to discuss current and future prospects for the River. It published a report ''Blue Peace for the Nile''&lt;ref&gt;http://strategicforesight.com/publication_pdf/84153Blue%20Peace%20for%20the%20Nile.pdf Blue Peace in the Nile, SFG&lt;/ref&gt; which was launched on 22 March 2013, that also happens to be World Water Day.

SFG has developed the concept of Mega Arc of Hydro Insecurity, spanning from Vietnam and Thailand in the East across [[China]], [[Nepal]], [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Afghanistan]] to the [[Middle East]] and [[Turkey]] and further downwards from [[Egypt]] to [[Tanzania]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/21538687  Unquenchable Thirst, The Economist, 19 November 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Will Water Security Increase Tensions Across Asia, Forbes (India), 6 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

HRH Hassan bin Talal, Chairman of the United Nations Secretary General’s Advisory Board on Water and Sanitation launched the SFG report ''Water Cooperation for a Secure World'' &lt;ref&gt;http://strategicforesight.com/publication_pdf/20795water-cooperature-sm.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Amman]] on 28 November 2013. The report examines for the first time the relationship between water and peace around the world and is based on the study of 148 countries and 205 shared river basins. It concludes that any two nations engaged in active water cooperation do not go to war. Out of the 148 countries covered, 37 countries are not engaged in any significant degree of cooperation with their neighbouring countries. These 37 countries also face the risk of war.

In the report, SFG developed a new Water Cooperation Quotient,&lt;ref&gt;http://strategicforesight.com/publication_pdf/28799WCQ-web.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which is a measure of active cooperation by riparian countries in the management of water resources using 10 parameters including legal, political, technical, environmental, economic and institutional aspects. It is calculated on a scale of 0 to 100, with 100 being the best performance.

SFG also launched the report ''Rivers of Peace - Restructuring India-Bangladesh Relations'' &lt;ref&gt;http://strategicforesight.com/publications_inner.php?id=33&lt;/ref&gt; in 2013. This report provides a new formula to resolve the impasse over the Teesta River Agreement between India and Bangladesh.

A major breakthrough in developing consensus between multiple stakeholder representatives of Iraq and Turkey on a Plan of Action for promoting exchange and calibration of data and standards pertaining to Tigris river flows was achieved at a meeting organised by SFG in 2014. The outcome of the meeting which was held in Geneva has been referred to as the "Geneva Consensus On Tigris River".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.orsam.org.tr/en/WaterResources/showAnalysisAgenda.aspx?ID=2735&lt;/ref&gt;

The first annual High-Level Forum on Blue Peace in the Middle East at Istanbul in September 2014. About 90 policymakers, Members of Parliament, serving and former Ministers, media leaders, academics and water experts from across the Middle East came together for this event.  Participants proposed concrete initiatives at bilateral as well as regional levels to promote cooperation and sustainable management of water resources in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://the-levant.com/blue-peace-initiative-continues-efforts-bring-peace-middle-east/|title="Blue Peace initiative" continues its efforts to bring peace to the Middle East|work=The Levant News|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, SFG launched two reports: ''The Hydro-Insecure: Crisis of Survival in the Middle East ''&lt;ref&gt;http://strategicforesight.com/publication_pdf/19317hydro-insecure.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Water and Violence: Crisis of Survival in the Middle East'',&lt;ref&gt;http://strategicforesight.com/publication_pdf/63948150123-web.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which highlight the challenges of water security and the larger effect it has on the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americansecurityproject.org/the-middle-east-struggles-with-water-security/|title=The Middle East Struggles with Water Security|work=American Security Project|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, the reports highlight that water insecurity is always accompanied by one or more issues such as poverty, war and conflict, low women's development and environmental degradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/mena/jordan/refugees-exacerbate-water-crisis-in-middle-east-1.1475639|title=Refugees exacerbate water crisis in the Middle East|author=Jumana Khamis, Staff Reporter|publisher=|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 'Hydro Insecure: Crisis of Survival in the Middle East' report, 40 million people are hydro-insecure, out of the total population of Iraq, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, which is roughly 140 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/uae/environment/water-cooperation-key-to-ensuring-peace-1.1475648|title=Water cooperation key to ensuring peace|author=Jumana Khamis, Staff Reporter|publisher=|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SFG also analyses major global changes and shares perspectives at international conferences.

==Since 2014: Critical Global Challenges==

SFG is addressing major paradigm shifts due to major scientific, technological, environmental, economic, social, and political factors.

In 2011, SFG published a document titled ''Big Questions of Our Time'' which addresses issues that will affect humanity in the next 50 years, approximately until 2060. It has since been involved in analysing critical global challenges and linkages between them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strategicforesight.com/publication_pdf/67141BQOT.pdf Big Questions of Our Time, Strategic Foresight Group, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Global High-Level Panel on Water and Peace was launched in Geneva in 2015. It was co-convened by 15 countries and chaired by [[Danilo Turk]], the former president of Slovenia and former Assistant Secretary-General of the United Nations. Strategic Foresight Group was selected to help the Panel in developing political and substantive recommendations. The Panel launched its report in September 2017 which advocates a number of specific recommendations on protecting water infrastructure in conflict zones, preferential and concessional finance for trans-boundary water projects, new mechanisms for hydro-diplomacy. &lt;ref&gt;A Matter of Survival: Report of the High Level Panel on Water and Peace 
[https://www.genevawaterhub.org/sites/default/files/atoms/files/A_Matter_of_Survival_FINAL.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915183356/https://www.genevawaterhub.org/sites/default/files/atoms/files/A_Matter_of_Survival_FINAL.pdf |date=15 September 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Strategic Foresight Group briefed the historic [[United Nations Security Council]] in [[New York City]]. It was for the first time that the UNSC had convened an open debate on "water, peace and security". SFG President [[Sundeep Waslekar]] was one of the four briefers along with UN Secretary General [[Ban Ki-Moon]], Chairman of the [[Global High-Level Panel on Water and Peace]] [[Danilo Türk]] and ICRC Vice President [[Christine Beerli]].&lt;ref&gt;http://webtv.un.org/watch/part-1-open-debate-on-water-peace-and-security-security-council-7818th-meeting/5221217671001&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/press/en/2016/sc12598.doc.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Strategic Foresight Group launched the second edition of the Water Cooperation Quotient, a rare document analyzing water cooperation in all of the world's shared river basins. The [[InterAction Council of Former Heads of State and Government]] provided the Foreword, authored by its two co-chairs, Mr [[Bertie Ahern]], former Prime Minister of Ireland and President [[Olusegun Obasanjo]], former President of Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;Water Cooperation Quotient 2017 [http://www.strategicforesight.com/publication_pdf/Water%20Cooperation%20Quotient%202017.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Endorsements==
"The study by the Strategic Foresight Group represents a valuable input into global thinking about the situation in the [[Middle East]]. Many of these costs cannot be assigned a monetary value: the loss of human lives, the despair and humiliation of displaced populations, the damage to the very fabric of societies, the rise and persistence of a culture of violence, fear and extremism. The attempts made in the report to quantify the effect of conflict across a wide variety of sectors are nevertheless commendable." — Mr Sergei A. Ordzhonikidze, Under Secretary-General, United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;Opening remarks by Mr Sergei A. Ordzhonikidze

"I am happy to inaugurate the Conference on "Responsibility to the Future: Business, Peace, Sustainability", which I understand would be looking at issues that could affect the future of mankind. I congratulate the foresight of the organisers for convening this meeting… Such a large proportion of the world's population cannot be left on the periphery. We need to have a process of inclusive [[globalisation]], one which as is said, "will lift all boats in its tide"."

"The [[International Development Committee]], which I chair, had an informal briefing this morning from Strategic Foresight Group. Its ideas about and analysis of the causes of division, terrorism and extremism are interesting. It also makes some practical suggestions for tackling that." — The Rt. Hon. [[Malcolm Bruce]], MP, Chairman of [[International Development Select Committee]] of House of Commons&lt;ref&gt;The Rt. Hon. Malcolm Bruce, MP, speaking in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], [[London]], 20 March 2007 [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070320/debtext/70320-0013.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

"Given these failures, many people will warmly welcome the ''Cost of Conflict in the Middle East'',&lt;ref&gt;http://strategicforesight.com/publication_pdf/28458Lessons%20Learnt.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; a report produced by Strategic Foresight Group with wide international backing. This report charts spending on wars, plus the vast annual costs of military, police, security, relief and aid. Despite such spending, I am informed that 91 per cent of Israelis still feels insecure. The report points out that the overall standard of living in the Middle East would have doubled had comprehensive peace been available from 1991. It assesses the cost of lost opportunities and the potential of new, linked-up economies. I trust that this report will lead to changed policies in East and West, and will stimulate co-operative behaviour. Given these failures, many people will warmly welcome the ''Cost of Conflict in the Middle East''. I trust that this report will lead to changed policies in East and West, and will stimulate co-operative behaviour."

"It is a particular pleasure for us to have the Swedish International Development Agency and Strategic Foresight Group as partners in the Blue Peace Initiative, launched by the countries in the Middle East. This initiative has raised high expectations regarding the future of water and peace in the Middle East. The Blue Peace highlights solutions emerging of this one-year high-level multi stakeholder dialogue. SDC with the partners of the Blue Peace is ready to Action."

"Water was always a source of conflict, but what has changed in recent years is that it is being seen much more clearly in that light. It is, therefore, appropriate that Strategic Foresight Group has gone to the heart of the region which is most conflict prone-the Middle East to look at this aspect of what constitutes an impediment to peace and prosperity."
— [[Baroness Falkner of Margravine]] ([[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]) in the [[House of Lords]] on 27 October 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/lords/?gid=2011-10-27a.956.0|title=My Lords, it is a particular...: 27 Oct 2011: House of Lords debates - TheyWorkForYou|publisher=|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Endorsement of "Water Cooperation Quotient 2017"&lt;ref&gt; Water Cooperation Quotient 2017''' [http://www.strategicforesight.com/publication_pdf/Water%20Cooperation%20Quotient%202017.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

"This ground-breaking report is the only document that offers analysis on the risk of conflict and potential for cooperation among the 146 countries that have shared or transboundary rivers. The Water Cooperation Quotient is an effective decision-making tool for water cooperation and a badly needed barometer for assessing risks of war; one that the [[InterAction Council]] urges be employed around the world to promote peace, ensure security and improve human and planetary health through cooperation over shared waters, now and in the future." — [[Olusegun Obasanjo]],  President of Nigeria, 1999-2007 and  Bertie Ahern , Prime Minister of Ireland, 1997-2008 (Co-chairs of InterAction Council)

"This fascinating report provides a unique insight into the state of transboundary water cooperation worldwide and offers a valuable instrument for management of disputes and prevention of conflict. It should become a standard manual in the “toolbox” of policy makers and diplomats and serve in their efforts to devise effective conflict prevention strategies. Moreover, the water cooperation quotient should inspire policy makers to think and use the full potential of water cooperation for the well-being of their peoples." - [[Danilo Turk]],  President of Slovenia, 2007-2012, Chairman of the [[Global High-Level Panel on Water and Peace]] 

"This report offers detailed and unassailable analysis on the risk of conflict and same time outlines possibilities for potential cooperation among the 146 countries that share transboundary rivers. The Water Cooperation Quotient is an effective conflict prevention and peace-making tool for water cooperation and it should be present on the mind and action of every decision-making authority around the world." — J. [[Ramos-Horta]] , President of Timor-Leste, 2007-2012, Prime Minister of Timor-Leste, 2006-2007, [[Nobel Peace Prize]] Laureate, 1996

'''''The Battle for God: Fundamentalism in Judaism, Christianity and Islam''''' is a book by best-selling author [[Karen Armstrong]] published in 2000 by [[Alfred A. Knopf|Knopf]]/[[HarperCollins]] which the ''[[New York Times]]'' described as "one of the most penetrating, readable, and prescient accounts to date of the rise of the fundamentalist movements in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/26/books/holy-wars.html|date=Mar 26, 2000|title=Holy Wars|author=Chris Hedges|newspaper=New York Times|accessdate=2010-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Battle for God'' traces the history of the rise of [[fundamentalism]] in the three major [[monotheistic]] faiths. Armstrong's analysis starts with developments in [[Jewish fundamentalism|Judaism]] and traces it through the creation of fundamentalism in [[Fundamentalist Christianity|Christianity]] to adoption of a similar approach to modernity in [[Islamic fundamentalism|Islam]].

==Synopsis==
Armstrong's central case rests on the confusion between ''mythos'' and ''logos'', using these in the technical sense suggested by [[Johannes Slok]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Johannes Slok|title=Devotional Language. Translated by Henrik Mossin.|publisher= Danbury: Walter De Gruyter Incorporated|year= 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Myth concerns "what was thought to be timeless and constant in our existence... Myth was not concerned with practical matters but with meaning".&lt;ref&gt;[[Karen Armstrong]]. ''The Battle for God''; page xiv&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast "Logos was the rational, pragmatic and scientific thought that enabled men and women to function well in the world". In religion, logos appears in legal systems and practical action. By the eighteenth century, "people in Europe and America began to think that ''logos'' was the only means to truth and began to discount ''mythos'' as false and superstitious." Armstrong suggests that fundamentalists have turned their mythos into logos using the mindset of the modern scientific age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianethicstoday.com/Issue/029/The%20Battle%20For%20God%20%20By%20Karen%20Armstrong_029_29_.htm|author=Darrel Morgan|title=The Battle for God|date=Aug 2000|accessdate=2010-02-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805015838/http://www.christianethicstoday.com/Issue/029/The%20Battle%20For%20God%20%20By%20Karen%20Armstrong_029_29_.htm|archivedate=2009-08-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first part of the book, "The Old World and the New", compares the progression of the three monotheistic faiths between 1492, when [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] discovered [[Americas|America]], and 1870, when "The Franco-Prussian War had revealed the hideous effects of modern weaponry, and there was a dawning realisation that science might also have a malignant dimension."&lt;ref&gt;Karen Armstrong. ''The Battle for God''; page 136&lt;/ref&gt; It traces the way Jews and Muslims modernized during this period.

This leads to the modern period described in part two, “Fundamentalism”, when there was a growing adoption of a [[Biblical literalism|literalist]] interpretation of scripture in the United States, which eventually gave rise to ''[[The Fundamentals]]'', a series of 12 volumes refuting modern ideas published shortly before and during the [[World War I]], of which 3 million copies  were distributed to every pastor, professor and theological student across America by the largesse of oil millionaires. Though this led to a distinctive ideology, it was not till the 1980s that it emerged as a political force.

In Judaism, the growth of [[Zionism]] was given its biggest boost by the [[Holocaust]] which led to the establishment of the [[State of Israel]] in 1948. Although many traditional Jews migrated there, the most conservative rejected the secular interpretation of Zionism and it wasn't until the emergence of [[Gush Emunim]] after the [[Yom Kippur War]] in 1974 that fundamentalism emerged in Israel as a political force.

In Islam, fundamentalism did not emerge until modernization had taken hold, first in [[Egypt]] with the creation of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] by [[Hasan al-Banna]]. Armstrong traces the development of [[Sunni]] fundamentalism under [[Sayyid Qutb]] and [[Shia]] fundamentalism under [[Ayatollah Khomeini]].

==Response==
After [[September 11 attacks|9/11]], Karen Armstrong became one of the best selling authors in the US, as people attempted to understand the culture of men capable of carrying out such acts. One reviewer points out that "9-11 holds a fresh irony. While Osama and Co. wouldn't exist without the hegemony of Western secularism to rally against, their most effective attack on the Great Satan has breathed new life into our own fundamentalist tendencies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=C.

[[File:Stylised atom with three Bohr model orbits and stylised nucleus.png|thumb|200px|&lt;center&gt;Stylised atom as an emblem of [[science]].&lt;/center&gt;]]
[[File:Emb logo.png|thumb|250px|&lt;center&gt;An emblem of the [[Theosophical Society]].&lt;/center&gt;]]
Immediately after formation the [[Theosophical Society]] in 1875, the founders of modern '''[[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]]''' were aimed to show that their ideas can be confirmed by '''[[science]]'''. According to professor [[Olav Hammer]], at the end of the 19th century the Theosophical doctrine has acquired in Europe and America wide popularity, thanking to numerous publications, which contained its simplified exposition and, in particular, asserted that Theosophy "includes" both science and religion, thus, positioning itself as "a scientific religion," or "a religious science."{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=222}}{{refn|group=note|[[Helena Blavatsky]] argued that ancient civilizations owned wisdom based on "unity of science and religion."{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=10}}}} Professor [[Joscelyn Godwin]] wrote that the Theosophical Society was formed at the "crucial historical moment when it seemed possible to unite science and [[occultism]], West and East" in modern Theosophy, adding into western civilization the [[esoteric]] eastern wisdom.{{sfn|Godwin|1994|p=xv}}

== Scientism of Theosophy ==
For the modern Theosophy, which Hammer considered as a standard of the esoteric tradition, conventional science is called upon to play "two diametrically opposite roles." On the one hand, Theosophy has always expressed its clearly negative attitude towards it. On the other hand, in the process of building the occult doctrine, it gave to certain fragments of scientific discourse the status of valued elements. In this case, science was not used as an object of criticism, but as "a basis of legitimacy and source of doctrinal elements." Thus, in Hammer's opinion, the main goal was achieved: the doctrine acquired a "scientistic" appearance.{{sfnm|Hammer|2003|1pp=203, 204|Asprem|2013|2p=408}}{{refn|group=note|Lydia Fesenkova wrote: "Modern esotericism show itself usually in a scientistic wear... It appeals to science, proclaiming the principle of the unity of science, religion, and philosophy."{{sfn|Фесенкова|2003|pp=84–85}} However, in opinion of professor [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]], the "scientistic aspect of modem esotericism is much more than mere terminology; it reflects an ongoing effort to bridge the worlds of [[spirit]] and physical matter."{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=235}}}}

The Theosophical Society proclaimed its third main task, "To investigate the unexplained laws of nature and the powers latent in man."{{sfnm|Kuhn|1992|1p=113|Hammer|2003|2p=218}} Thus, it set itself one of its goals to investigate phenomena whose existence itself is highly controversial, that is, the very premises of Theosophy have become "fertile ground" for the search for "scientistic formulations." Scientism and the ambivalence relation to science were already evident in the first Theosophical publications. It can be seen in both [[Helena Blavatsky|Blavatsky's]] early articles, and in ''[[Isis Unveiled]],'' the book that became the "first full-scale attempt" to create the Theosophical doctrine, where she stated that Theosophy does not contradict science, but is, in fact, a "higher form of science", in comparison with what is usually understood by this term.{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=219}} This statement by Blavatsky is quoted in Hammer's thesis:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The exercise of ''[[Magic (paranormal)|magical]]'' power is the exercise of ''natural'' powers, but superior to the ordinary functions of Nature. A miracle is not a violation of the laws of Nature, except for ignorant people. Magic is but a ''science,'' a profound knowledge of the Occult forces in Nature, and of the laws governing the visible or the invisible world... A powerful [[mesmerism|mesmerizer]], profoundly learned in his science, such as [[Baron du Potet]], Regazzoni, Pietro d'Amicis of Bologna, are ''magicians,'' for they have become the [[adept]]s, the [[Initiation (Theosophy)|initiated]] ones, into the great mystery of our Mother Nature."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1966|1p=137|Hammer|2003|2p=220}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A dual relation of Blavatsky to science remained unchanged, in Hammer's opinion, throughout her theosophical career. It was manifested also in the [[The Mahatma Letters to A.P. Sinnett|mahatma letters]] and later continued in ''[[The Secret Doctrine]].''{{refn|group=note|Hammer, apparently, considered Blavatsky the author, including the letters of the mahatmas. However, according to [[Charles Leadbeater|Leadbeater]], the letters were not written or dictated directly by the mahatmas, as the Theosophists supposed, "but were the work of pupils carrying out general directions given to them by the Masters."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=807}}}} In one of the letters, terms and theories of the conventional science are characterized with words such as "misleading", "vacillating", "uncertain" and "incomplete".{{sfnm|Barker|1924|1p=62|Hammer|2003|2p=220}} It is this last word that is most important, that is, "science is a half-truth." The Theosophical doctrine "not so much" denies the truth of science, how much condemns its inability to explain an essence of the [[spirit]]ual processes that "are supposedly the real causes" of the physical and chemical phenomena.{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=221}} According to Hammer, "The Secret Doctrine" is completely "imbued with the rhetoric of scientism". Although the "basic cosmological" concept in this work ultimately derives "from ancient wisdom" that was received by Blavatsky, as she claimed, from her "Masters," many of the details of this declassified cosmology are accompanied by references to archaeological discoveries, modern biological theories such as evolutionary theory of [[Ernst Haeckel|Haeckel]], etc. She believed that the positioning of Theosophy in relation to science is of great importance, and the third parts of both the 1st and 2nd volumes of her book have the common heading ''Science and the Secret Doctrine Contrasted.'' These sections are devoted both to the refutation of the conventional science, and to the search in it the support of occult teachings.{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=221}} Blavatsky repeatedly returned to the assertion that modern physical sciences point to the same reality as the esoteric doctrines:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"If there is anything on earth like progress, Science will some day have to give up, ''nolens volens,'' such monstrous ideas as her physical, self-guiding ''laws''—void of soul and [[Spirit]],—and then turn to the occult teachings. It has done so already, however altered are the title-page and revised editions of the Scientific Catechism."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1888a|1pp=506–507|Hammer|2003|2p=262}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Blavatsky generally did not reject science, suggesting the possibility of "reconciliation" of science and Theosophy.{{refn|group=note|[[Nikolai Berdyaev]] wrote, "Contemporary popular theosophy is very deferential towards science... From the natural sciences it borrows a naive realism."{{sfn|Berdyaev}}}} She believed that they have "important common grounds", and that the "weaknesses" of the traditional science are only its "temporary shortcomings." The main point of contact, which unites science and "occultism" against the common enemy, a dogmatic religion, was the refusal to recognize "unknowable, absolutely transcendent causes." Theosophical cosmos appears and disappears in an infinite sequence of "cycles of evolution and involution." This is [[pantheism| pantheistic]] position, because the beginning of this process does not require "transcendent God."{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=265}} Hammer has cited:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Well may a man of science ask himself, 'What power is it that directs each atom?' &lt;...&gt; [[Theism|Theists]] would solve the question by answering 'God'; and would solve nothing philosophically. Occultism answers on its own pantheistic grounds."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1888a|1p=549|Hammer|2003|2p=265}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Theosophical criticism ==
In his thesis Arnold Kalnitsky wrote that, criticizing science of the 19th century, the Theosophists claimed on the "futility" its attempts to adequately explain "the greatest enigmas" of Universe. They evaluated the "occult based" hypotheses as more accurate than those presented by science.{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|p=312}}

Hammer wrote Blavatsky defined her position regarding science "from the beginning of her theosophical career." Thus, the ''Mahatma Letters'' contain, in his opinion, the "rather unsystematic" accusations the modern science and the fragments of the occult doctrine, supposedly "far superior" the scientific ideas of the day. The essence of Blavatsky's "later argument" is anticipated in the next passage from letter No. 11: "Modern science is our best ally. Yet it is generally that same science which is made the enemy to break our heads with."{{sfnm|Barker|1924|1p=63|Hammer|2003|2p=261|Asprem|2013|3p=405}} She constantly condemned the traditional science as "limited, [[materialism|materialistic]] and prejudiced" and blamed in this the famous thinkers and scholars.{{refn|group=note|A Russian Indologist [[Alexander Senkevich]] wrote that in the 19th century, an idea of the omnipotence of science became the main one, and "men believed in steam's force more than in virtue of preaching."{{sfn|Сенкевич|2012|p=157}}}} [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]] was the first among the culprits "due to the materialism of his method, 'the general tenor' of his writing and, more specifically, his misunderstanding of spiritual evolution." [[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] materialist error allegedly consisted in the fact that in his [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|law of gravitation]] the primary was the power, not the influence of the "spiritual causes." In addition, she repeated the baseless, according to Hammer, assertion that Newton came to his ideas after reading [[Jakob Böhme|Böhme]].{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1888a|1pp=481, 490|Hammer|2003|2p=267}}{{refn|group=note|In the third chapter of ''Isis'' (Vol. 1) named by its author ''The blind leaders of the blind'' she particularly sharply criticized the two "high priests" of the scientific materialism [[John Tyndall|Tyndall]] and [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Huxley]].{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1877|1pp=73–98|Lachman|2012|2p=174|Asprem|2013|3p=409}}}}

An American author Joseph Tyson wrote that, according to Blavatsky, the mechanistic science's adepts of her time were the "animate corpses." She wrote that "they have no spiritual sight because their spirits have left them." She called their hypotheses "the [[sophism]]s suggested by cold reason," which future generations would banish to the "limbo of exploded myths."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1877|1pp=306, 318, 621|Tyson|2006|2p=388}} Also [[Henry Olcott]] proclaimed that the Theosophists must break "the walls of incredulous and despotic Western science."{{sfnm|Olcott|2011|1p=100|Tyson|2006|2p=387}}{{refn|group=note|[[Vladimir Trefilov]] wrote, "The main difference between the Theosophical science and the usual modern science is seen in the fact that the latter has to do only with scraps of a whole—with the physical phenomena of this and other worlds, with that that can be performed through the physical brain of man and his feeling."{{sfn|Трефилов|1994|p=234}}}}{{refn|group=note|Adhering to a line of the initial theosophical criticism, [[#Theosophists-scientists|Edi Bilimoria]]{{sfn|Theowiki}} suggested to those modern scientists who claim that they investigate and unravel "the 'mind of God' would do better to probe into their own minds to discover the arrogance and philosophic naivete of such 'investigations'."{{sfn|Bilimoria|1997|p=159}}}}

Some scientists, according to Blavatsky, were more prone to spiritual, and she "selectively approved" them. "The positive side of [[René Descartes|Descartes']] work" was supposedly his faith in the "magnetic doctrine" and [[alchemy]], although he was a "worshipper of matter." She was admired by [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler's]] method, "combining scientific and esoteric thought."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1877|1pp=206, 207|Hammer|2003|2p=267}} She gave also some excerpts from Newton's most "speculative" works, where he supports a "spiritualized" approach to gravity. Thus, according to her words, these "greatest scientists" rediscovered the esoteric knowledge already available to "Western occultists including [[Paracelsus]]... [[Kabbalah|kabbalists]] and alchemists."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1888a|1p=490|Hammer|2003|2p=267}}{{refn|group=note|Bilimoria classified Newton as a "greatest mystic and Occultist" of England.{{sfn|Bilimoria|1997|p=150}}}}

A religious studies scholar [[Alvin Boyd Kuhn|Alvin Kuhn]] wrote Blavatsky claimed in ''The Secret Doctrine'' that occultism does not combat with conventional science, when "the conclusions of the latter are grounded on a substratum of unassailable fact." But when its opponents try "to wrench the formation of [[Kosmos]]...  from Spirit, and attribute all to blind matter, that the Occultists claim the right to dispute and call in question their theories." She stated that "science is limited" to researching one aspect of human life that relates to the sphere of material nature. "There are other aspects" of this life—[[Metaphysics|metaphysical]], supersensory, for the knowledge of which science has no tools. Science devotes its strength to the study of vital forces, which are expressed in a phenomenal or sensual area. Consequently, it sees nothing but the residual effects of such forces. "These are but the shadow of reality," Blavatsky claimed. Thus, science deals "only with appearances" and hints of life, and that is all that it is capable of until the postulates of the occult are recognized. Science is tied to "the plane of effects", but occultism is take to "the plane of causes." Science "studies the expression of life", esotericism sees life itself. So that the scientist can learn "the elements of real causality", he will have to develop in himself such [[siddhi|abilities]] which today almost all Europeans and Americans absolutely lack. There is no other way to get enough facts to substantiate his conclusions.{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1888a|1pp=477–78|Kuhn|1992|2p=258}}

Tim Rudbøg wrote in his thesis: "A large part of Blavatsky's critique of modern science consisted in the critical view that many of these so-called new discoveries and theories were actually known to the ancients, but lost to the moderns due to their arrogance. In other words, any 'new' discovery was, to a large extent, simply 'old wine in new bottles'."{{sfn|Rudbøg|2012|p=276}}

== Theosophical evolutionism ==
Modern Theosophy, as professor [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]] stated, "adapting contemporary scientific ideas," raised the concept of "[[spiritual evolution]] through countless worlds and eras."{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=211}} According to professor [[Donald S. Lopez Jr.|Donald Lopez]], the occult "system of spiritual evolution" was more profound and advanced than that proposed by [[Charles Darwin]]. Theosophists accepted his theory but rejected the assertion that life originated from matter, and not from spirit.{{sfn|Lopez|2009|p=11}}{{refn|group=note|In 1963 a British chemist [[#Theosophists-scientists|Lester Smith]]{{sfn|Theosopedia}} said, "There is a tendency to believe that the whole secret of life is wrapped up in this [[genetic code]], so that  when it has been completely unravelled it will be possible to create life... We should proclaim firmly  that the biochemists are not studying Life itself, but its mechanisms, the almost unbelievably intricate and delicate tools it uses for its purposes."{{sfn|Smith|1963|p=18}} An [[:ru:Действительные члены РАН|academician]] [[Erik M. Galimov|Galimov]] stated that [[Darwinism]] proved unproductive "in reference to the problem of the origin of life."{{sfn|Галимов|2001|p=212}} Lydia Fesenkova noted that from the positions of the natural sciences, Darwinism now looks like a "hypothesis that greatly simplifies the real state of things," so his conclusions find "constantly-increasing objections."{{sfn|Фесенкова|2007|p=128}}}}

Kuhn wrote that, according to Blavatsky, between the spiritual evolution of man and his physical development "there is an abyss which will not be easily crossed by any man in the full possession of his intellectual faculties." [[Evolution|Physical development]], "as modern Science teaches it, is a subject for open controversy; spiritual and moral development on the same lines is the insane dream of a crass materialism."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1888b|1p=650|Kuhn|1992|2p=255}} Darwinian theory and the materialistic science suggest that the development of matter in an organic form leads to the emergence of the psyche and intelligence as the products of two elements: matter and energy. Occultism claims that such a process can lead to the creation of physical forms only. Instead of considering intellect and consciousness as properties of evolved organisms, Theosophy speaks of a "spiritual evolution" as a concomitant biological one and associated with it. "Evolution in its higher aspect" can't be explained if its factors are reduced to blind material forces arising under the impact of the "mechanical influences of environment."{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|pp=253, 254}}{{refn|group=note|According to Indian philosophy, there are "other worlds than that which our senses reveal to us, other senses than those which we share with the lower animals, other forces than those of material nature."{{sfn|Radhakrishnan|1948b|p=373}}}}

An American author [[Gary Lachman]] wrote that, according to Blavatsky, the "scientific" theory of evolution reflects only that part of it that takes place in our present physical world. [[Darwinism]] does not take into account what happens before and after. In her opinion, Darwin "begins his evolution of species at the lowest point and traces upward. His only mistake may be that he applies his system at the wrong end." After passing through the period of necessary separation, the spirit returns to itself enriched during its journey. Consequently, the biological evolution is not a "random" event that could "occur" due to some "rare" combination of chemical matters and then continued driven by the need for survival and suitable [[mutation]]s. Blavatsky claimed that, not spirit is in matter, but on the contrary, ''matter'' "clings temporarily to spirit."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1877|1pp=428, 429|Lachman|2012|2p=171}}{{refn|group=note|Senkevich wrote that, according to Darwin, the three main factors: [[Genetic variability|variability]], [[heredity]], and [[natural selection]] were responsible for evolution; thus, "the pragmatic West" with its mundane approach to life simply lacked "common sense, to gain faith in the evolution of [[soul]] or consciousness."{{sfn|Сенкевич|2012|p=435}}}} Thus, the spirit (or consciousness) is primary, and matter is a temporary means used in its "work." According to Theosophy, evolution is the basic phenomenon of the Universe that does not coincide with the materialistic vision, which, in Blavatsky's opinion, is "a hideous, ceaseless procession of sparks of cosmic matter created by ''no one''... floating onward from ''nowhence''... and it rushes ''nowhither''."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1877|1p=xviii|Lachman|2012|2p=171}} She proposed the kabalistic scheme of evolution: "A stone becomes a plant; a plant a beast; a beast a ''man''; a man a ''spirit''; and the spirit a god." In this scheme: "Each perfected species in the physical evolution only affords more scope to the directing intelligence to act within the improved nervous system."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1877|1pp=301, 425|Lachman|2012|2p=171}}

According to words of Dimitry Drujinin, Olcott claimed, "Theosophy shows the student that evolution is a fact, but that it has not been partial and incomplete as Darwin's theory makes it."{{sfnm|Olcott|1885|1p=250|Дружинин|2012|2p=79}} Professor [[I. K. Taimni|Iqbal Taimni]]{{sfn|Harris, Swarup}} wrote that, it is not known to science that the main goal "of the evolution of forms" is to obtain more effective means for the development of the mind and "unfolding consciousness." This barbarism is quite standard because the ordinary scientists decline to view everything that is "invisible" and can't be investigated "by purely physical means." Occultism allows one to obtain the "missing knowledge" and makes the concept of the evolution of forms not only more complete, but also explains the cause of the entire process, without which it seems completely meaningless.{{sfn|Taimni|1969|p=384}}

== Orientalists and Theosophists ==
In 1888, the president of the Theosophical Society Henry Olcott met in [[Oxford]] with [[Max Müller]], "the father of the '[[Science of religion]]'," as Lopez named his.{{sfn|Lopez|2009|pp=154, 158}} Olcott wrote later in his diary that professor Müller, in a conversation with him, highly appreciated the work of Theosophists in translating and re-publishing the sacred books of the East. "But as for our more cherished activities," Olcott wrote, "the discovery and spread of ancient views on the existence of [[Siddha]]s{{sfn|Eliade|1958|p=303}} and of the ''[[siddhi]]s'' in man,{{sfnm|Radhakrishnan|1948b|1pp=366–7|Трефилов|2005|2p=379}} he was utterly incredulous." In Müller's opinion, nor in the [[Vedas]], nor in the [[Upanishads]] there are any esoteric overtones announced by the Theosophists, and they only sacrifice their reputation, pandering "to the superstitious belief of the Hindus in such follies." In response to Olcott's attempt to argue his point of view by references to the [[Gupta-Vidya]]{{refn|group=note|"'''Gupta-vidya''' (Sanskrit) ''Gupta-vidyā'' [from ''gupta'' from the verbal root ''gup'' to conceal, preserve + ''vidyā'' knowledge, wisdom] Secret knowledge, secret wisdom; the source of all religions and philosophies known to the world: theosophy, the ancient wisdom-religion, the esoteric philosophy."{{sfn|Purucker|1999}}}} and [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|Patanjali]] the professor said, "We had better change the subject." The president has remembered well not only this conversation, but also "two marble statuettes of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] sitting in [[meditation]], placed to the right and left of the fireplace." He noted this fact, having written in his diary in brackets: "[[Buddhist]]s take notice."{{sfnm|Olcott|1910|1p=61|Lopez|2009|2p=157}}

Professor Lopez claimed that this was a significant meeting, because both, Buddhist Olcott, and the [[Buddhist studies]] scholar Müller, although both were directly related to Buddhism, nevertheless took different positions and lived in different worlds. The world of Olcott, an American emigre and convinced Theosophist "no formal training in the classical languages of Buddhism", but who was knowing well both the Buddhist world, and many reputable monks, collided with the world of Müller, a German emigre and outstanding [[sanskrit]]ologist, who was reading "Buddhist manuscripts in the original Sanskrit and [[Pali]]," and however failed to recognize theirs esoteric meaning and "never traveled beyond Europe." In Asia, Olcott faced with Buddhist superstition, which is why he argued with some of the leading monks of Sri Lanka. But he deeply revered the Buddhist mores. After his travels through the countries of Asia, he knew that for Buddhists it was absolutely unacceptable and offensive to place anything connected with [[dharma]] on the floor [or even on a chair]. Moreover, he knew that Buddhists "would never place a statue of the Buddha on the floor."{{sfn|Lopez|2009|p=158}}{{refn|group=note|"As a representation of an exalted being, the image of the Buddha must also be exalted."{{sfn|Lopez|2009|p=159}}}} {{See also|Buddhism and Theosophy#The Founders of the Theosophical Society}}

Olcott asked all the same of the origin of these statuettes and inquired about their placement. Müller answered that "the statues of the Buddha" standing on the floor near his fireplace were taken out of "the great temple of [[Rangoon]] (presumably the [[Shwedagon Pagoda|Shwedagon]])."{{refn|group=note|"It is unclear whether they were pillaged during the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]]", Lopez wrote, "when British troops captured and held the temple for two years, or during the [[Second Anglo-Burmese War|Second]], when British troops captured the temple in 1852; it then remained under the control of the military until 1929."{{sfn|Lopez|2009|p=159}}}} The professor was so imbued with the British imperialism, as Lopez noted, that he was not at all embarrassed to use the military trophies captured in the Buddhist temple. The "more interesting" was Müller's answer to the question why he put the Buddha statues on the floor: "Because with the Greeks the hearth was the most sacred spot." According to Lopez, the answer "sounds slightly disingenuous, but its implication is important." For Müller, the image of the Buddha, captured in Asia and taken to England, has ceased to be Asian, and therefore its owner was not obliged allegedly to follow the "Asian custom." For him, the Buddha became part "of European culture, like a Greek god," and therefore he should follow the customs of Western civilization.{{sfn|Lopez|2009|p=159}}

Five years after the meeting with Olcott, professor Müller published an article ''Esoteric Buddhism,'' in which he tried again, in a different form, to prove that there is no esotericism in Buddhism and never was. All his indignation the professor directed against Blavatsky, believing that the Buddhist esotericism is only her invention. "I love Buddha and admire Buddhist morality", Müller wrote, "that I cannot remain silent when I see his noble figure lowered to the level of religious charlatans, or his teaching misrepresented as esoteric twaddle."{{sfnm|Müller|1893|1p=784|Lopez|2009|2p=179}}{{refn|group=note|Also a prominent Buddhist studies scholar [[Thomas Rhys Davids|Rhys Davids]] believed that "the original Buddhism was the very contrary of esoteric."{{sfn|Davids|1896|p=210}}}} Theosophists often disagreed with the European [[Oriental studies|Orientalists]] and ridiculed their limitation. In 1882, in his letter to [[Alfred Percy Sinnett|Alfred Sinnett]] [[mahatma]] [[Kuthumi]] offered, "Since those gentlemen—the Orientalists—presume to give to the world their ''soi-disant'' translations and commentaries on our sacred books, let the theosophists show the great ignorance of those 'world' [[pandit|pundits]], by giving the public the right doctrines and explanations of what they would regard as an absurd, fancy theory."{{sfnm|Barker|1924|1p=185|Lopez|2009|2pp=184–185}}

== Occultists and sceptics ==
For Hindus, the [[Siddhi|supernatural powers]] of a [[yogi|person, who was specially trained]], aren't something special. Professor [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan|Radhakrishnan]] noted that in Indian psychology "the psychic experiences, such as [[telepathy]] and [[clairvoyance]], were considered to be neither abnormal nor miraculous."{{sfn|Radhakrishnan|1948a|p=28}}

Kuhn wrote that, in Blavatsky's opinion, to consider [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] as a deception is to offend humanity: "To believe that for so many thousands of years, one-half of mankind practiced deception and fraud on the other half, is equivalent to saying that the human race was composed only of knaves and incurable idiots."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1877|1p=18|Kuhn|1992|2p=132}} However, according to the Theosophical [[mahatma|Masters]], the "recent persecutions" for alleged [[witchcraft]], magic, [[mediumship]] convincingly show that the "only salvation" of the genuine occultists lies in the public skepticism, because the attribution to the "charlatans and the jugglers" securely protects them.{{sfn|Barker|1924|p=4}}

A member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] [[Eugene Alexandrov]] argued that the [[paranormal]] phenomena don't exist. He wrote, "There is no telepathy (a transmission and reading of thoughts), there is no clairvoyance, [[Levitation (paranormal)|levitation]] is impossible, there is no '[[dowsing]]', there is no phenomena of a '[[poltergeist]]', there is no [[psychokinesis]]."{{sfn|Александров|2015|p=21}}{{refn|group=note|See also arguments of [[Robert Todd Carroll|Robert Carroll]]:{{sfn|Carroll|2003}}}} As Edi Bilimoria{{sfn|Theowiki}} wrote, a typical western scientist don't distinguish (or can't distinguish) two things: a "map" (the scientific model of the world) and "territory" (Nature).{{sfn|Bilimoria|1997|p=71}}{{refn|group=note|Thus, if he didn't want to mark any "ravines" or "swamps" (the paranormal phenomena) on his "map," this don't mean that he will never "find himself" there. For participants in a hypothetical dialogue the [[Initiation (Theosophy)|initiated]] occultist and a typical scientist, Bilimoria chose the appropriate abbreviations: OWL (''Occultist,'' ''Wise,'' and ''Learned,'' or ''an owl'') and ASS (''Archetypal Sceptical Scientist,'' or ''an ass'').{{sfn|Bilimoria|1997|p=99}}}} {{See also|Map–territory relation}}

=== "Occult or Exact Science?" ===
{{Fringe section|date=September 2018}}
A religious studies scholar Arnold Kalnitsky wrote that in this work Blavatsky outlines her "typical" views about science.{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|p=155}}{{refn|group=note|This article was first published in 1886 in the Theosophical magazine ''[[The Theosophist]].'' Later it was included in the 7th volume of the ''Blavatsky Collected Writings.''{{sfn|Blavatsky|1956}}}}

;Statement on impotence of science
Kalnitsky wrote that at the beginning of her article, Blavatsky distinguishes "modern science" from "esoteric science", and argues that the methodology of the latter is preferable because it ultimately has a more practical, solid basis.{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|p=155}}{{refn|group=note|A religious studies scholar [[Vladimir Trefilov]] stated, "Without denying the positive role of science, the Theosophical theorists emphasize its limitations."{{sfn|Трефилов|1994|p=234}}}} He cited the passage from hers article:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Every new discovery made by modern science vindicates the truths of the archaic philosophy. The true [[occult]]ist is acquainted with no single problem that esoteric science is unable to solve, if approached in the right direction."{{Sfnm|Blavatsky|1956|1p=55|Kalnitsky|2003|2p=155}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He concluded Blavatsky considers modern science to be a form of the "archaic philosophy", which, as a synthesized worldview, includes the "esoteric science." According to her, this is the position of the "true occultist," who can solve any problem by the proper use of esoteric methodology.{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|p=155}}{{refn|group=note|A religious studies scholar [[Alvin Boyd Kuhn|Alvin Kuhn]] stated, "Madame Blavatsky declared that occultism had no quarrel with so-called exact science where 'the conclusions of the latter are grounded on a substratum of unassailable fact'."{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|p=258}}}}

Blavatsky criticizes, Kalnitsky noted, the perspective of modern science, by disagreeing with the idea that the manipulation of matter presents a real scientific challenge. She asserts that replacing the word "[[matter]]" with the term "[[spirit]]" would result in a greater goal. She tries to show that knowledge of mere matter is not enough to provide the answers sought by science, because such knowledge does not adequately explain even the simplest phenomena of nature. Blavatsky notes that [[Spiritualism|spiritualistic phenomena]], with which she claims her audience would be well familiar, show the need for revising the prevailing scientific consensus. She argues that there is another form of "proof" of the existence of [[Extrasensory perception|extrasensory abilities]], citing the example of the use of narcotics, which allegedly had facilitated the demonstration of such abilities.{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|p=156}}{{refn|group=note|Radhakrishnan claimed that, according to Indian philosophy's teachings, "The perfections ([[siddhi]]s) are attained through birth, drugs (oadhi), spells ([[mantra]]s), austerity (tapas), or concentration ([[samadhi]])."{{sfn|Radhakrishnan|1948b|p=339}}}} Blavatsky's statement on "natural phenomena" is quoted in Kalnitsky thesis:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"No doubt the powers of human fancy are great; no doubt delusion and hallucination may be generated for a shorter or a longer period in the healthiest human brain either naturally or artificially. But natural phenomena that are not included in that 'abnormal' class do exist; and they have at last taken forcible possession even of scientific minds."{{Sfnm|Blavatsky|1956|1p=59|Kalnitsky|2003|2p=156}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Recognizing the potential errors inherent in relying upon imagination, and the unreliability of "delusion and hallucination," Blavatsky is still trying to gain the "stamp of legitimation" from reputable scientific judgement that could confirm that supersensory abilities "do exist." It was a constant aim of Theosophy, though implicit, and it was accompanied always by a distrust to the scientific approach. On the one hand, Blavatsky gives occasion for a reconciliation with the scientists, on the other—continues to denounce them.{{refn|group=note|Hammer claimed that Blavatsky often demonstrated how it is possible to combine the negative attitude to science with a positive.{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=221}}}} In Kalnitsky's opinion, she demonstrates a desire to show that the scientific evidence of the extrasensory perception is quite possible:{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|pp=156–7}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The phenomena of [[Hypnosis|hypnotism]], of [[telepathy|thought-transference]], of sense-provoking, merging as they do into one another and manifesting their occult existence in our phenomenal world, succeeded finally in arresting the attention of some eminent scientists."{{Sfnm|Blavatsky|1956|1p=59|Kalnitsky|2003|2p=157}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Kalnitsky stated Blavatsky shows a dualistic approach in her interpretation of these phenomena, distinguishing between "their occult existence" and their manifestation "in our phenomenal world." Apparently, this means that there is [[Noumenon|noumenal]] "sphere of reality," which is the basis of the phenomenal world. Furthermore, the assertion that "some eminent scientists" had shown interest in various forms of ESP, obviously, indicates that most scientists are not interested in it, and that widely recognizing of their paranormal nature did not happen. In particular, she criticizes the findings of the doctor [[Jean-Martin Charcot|Charcot]] and some other scientists in France, England, Russia, Germany and Italy, who "have been investigating, experimenting and theorising for over fifteen years."{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|p=157}} This is quoted in work by Kalnitsky:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The sole explanation given to the public, to those who thirst to become acquainted with the real, the intimate nature of the [[Paranormal|phenomena]], with their productive cause and genesis—is that the sensitives who manifest them are all '''hysterical!''' They are psychopates, and neurosists—we are told—no other cause underlying the endless variety of manifestations than that of a purely physiological character."{{Sfnm|Blavatsky|1956|1p=59|Kalnitsky|2003|2p=157}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

;Scientific method's limitation
Kalnitsky wrote that, in Blavatsky's opinion, the scientists, who are trying to explore the controversial [[Paranormal|paranormal phenomena]], find themselves in a situation of utter helplessness, but it is not their fault. They simply do not have an appropriate set of conceptual "tools" for the right approach to these phenomena. Without an elementary familiarization with occult principles and the adoption, at least as a working hypothesis, the notion of the [[Plane (esotericism)|subtle worlds]] of nature, the science is not able to reveal the true depth and scope of the universal laws that underlie all cosmic processes. The orthodox [[Materialism|scientists-materialists]] are constrained by the limitations of their sciences, and so they need a new orientation based on the attraction of occult knowledge. However, according to Blavatsky, even admitting the legitimacy of the occult hypothesis, they will not be able to bring their research to the end:{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|pp=158–9}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Therefore, having conducted their experiments to a certain boundary, they would desist and declare their task accomplished. Then the phenomena might be passed on to [[transcendental philosophy|transcendentalists]] and philosophers to speculate upon."{{Sfnm|Blavatsky|1956|1p=71|Kalnitsky|2003|2p=159}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Turning to the consideration of conflicting opinions about the paranormal experience, Blavatsky says that the scientific recognition of the hypothesis about the nature of the [[Parapsychology|psychic]] phenomena is not excluded, but it requires a discussion in relation to their underlying causes. She also claims that to defend the Theosophical position harder than spiritualistic, because the Theosophists categorically reject as a materialist theory so and a belief in spirits, presented in a traditional spiritualistic approach. Blavatsky classifies the spiritualists as the "idealists" and the scientists—as the "materialists," who both fully convinced that modern science can, respectively, or to confirm, or to deny the authenticity of the kingdom of the spirits. But those who believe in the ability of a science to accept the occult presentation will be disappointed, because its modern methodology simply does not allow it.{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|p=160}} Kalnitsky has quoted:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Science, unless remodelled entirely, can have no hand in occult teachings. Whenever investigated on the plan of the modern scientific methods, occult phenomena will prove ten times more difficult to explain than those of the spiritualists pure and simple."{{Sfnm|Blavatsky|1956|1p=77|Kalnitsky|2003|2p=160}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He wrote that Blavatsky believes that modern scientific methods need to be rethought and remodeled to make it possible to study phenomena that can not be adequately explained from the materialistic standpoint. She expresses her disappointment with the existing state of affairs, doubting in achieving any progress. After ten years of a careful monitoring of the debate, she does not believe in the possibility of an objective and impartial investigation of the paranormal phenomena, not to mention the real revision of the well-established scientific views and the adoption of more adequate occult theory. The few scientists who could believe in the authenticity of such phenomena do not accept the hypothesis beyond the spiritualistic representations. Even in the midst of doubt of the truth of the materialist worldview, they are unable to move from spiritualism to the occult theory. In the study of [[Paranormal|unexplained]] side of the nature their respect for the traditional scientific orthodoxy always prevails over their personal views. Thus, according to Blavatsky, a necessary condition of objectivity is the impartiality and a change of the opinions.{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|pp=160–1}}

In Kalnitsky's opinion, considering the methodology of science, Blavatsky understood that the [[inductive reasoning]], based on data supplied by the physical senses, can not adequately provide a reliable way to study the abnormal phenomena.{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|p=162}} He has quoted:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Science—I mean Western Science—has to proceed on strictly defined lines. She glories in her powers of observation, induction, analysis and inference. Whenever a phenomenon of an abnormal nature comes before her for investigation, she has to sift it to its very bottom, or let it go. And this she has to do, and she cannot, as we have shown, proceed on any other than the inductive methods based entirely on the evidence of physical senses."{{Sfnm|Blavatsky|1956|1p=78|Kalnitsky|2003|2p=162}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

;Against ethical materialism
Kalnitsky wrote Blavatsky argues that the fruits of materialistic scientific worldview, reaching the sphere of practical interests of the people, shape their [[ethics]]. She sees a direct logical connection between a faith in the soulless mechanistic universe and by the fact that is for her as a purely egoistic attitude to life.{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|p=162}} He has quoted:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The theoretical materialistic science recognizes nought but [[Matter|'''substance''']]. Substance is its deity, its only God." We are told that practical materialism, on the other hand, concerns itself with nothing that does not lead directly or indirectly to personal benefit. "Gold is its idol," justly observes Professor [[Alexander Butlerov|Butleroff]] (a spiritualist, yet one who could never accept even the elementary truths of occultism, for he "cannot understand them"). – "A lump of matter," he adds, "the beloved substance of the theoretical materialists, is transformed into a lump of mud in the unclean hands of ethical materialism. And if the former gives but little importance to inner (psychic) states that are not perfectly demonstrated by their exterior states, the latter disregards entirely the inner states of life... The spiritual aspect of life has no meaning for practical materialism, everything being summed up for it in the external. The adoration of this external finds its principal and basic justification in the dogma of materialism, which has legalized it."{{Sfnm|Blavatsky|1956|1pp=79–80|Kalnitsky|2003|2pp=162–3}}{{refn|group=note|In 1871, Butlerov organized, "to the consternation of many of his fellow scientists," the first scientific commission for the investigation of the [[Mediumship|mediumistic]] phenomena.{{sfn|Сенкевич|2012|p=171}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Kalnitsky wrote Blavatsky clearly expresses her utter contempt for the values of "practical materialists." She accuses the ideological foundations of theoretical materialism for its an ignoring of the spiritual dimension of reality. This aversion to the complete unspirituality of the materialism reflects her "implicit [[Gnosticism|gnostic]] ethical stance." A materialistic-physical and selfish interests are not compatible with the idealised world of the spirit and the transcendental purpose of [[Mysticism|mystical]] enlightenment. The practical materialists, even professing adherence to a moral code, do not cease to be by ethical materialists. According to Kalnitsky, "Blavatsky's radical gnostic dualism is allowing no room for compromise or alternative options." Thus, she considers the esoteric vision of reality the only viable alternative.{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|pp=163–4}}

Kalnitsky wrote that science was seen in the West as the dominant category of knowledge and for the Theosophists it was not so an enemy, as a potential ally. However, the stereotypes of the materialistic thinking were one of the main obstacles to the esoteric representation of reality. Thus, at every opportunity Blavatsky tries to dispel what was for Theosophy, as she considered, alien and wrong. It is meant to challenge to many of the basic principles that supported the materialistic basis of science. However, a neutral and objective approach of the science to the analysis of the facts seemed, for the Theosophists, trustworthy. Blavatsky's striving to apply this approach to the consideration of the paranormal and mystical phenomena pursued a goal: to achieve the legitimacy and public acceptance of Theosophy. A skeptical position, which was taken by Blavatsky in respect of the materialistic science, was motivated by her outrage over the ignore by the scientists the spiritual dimension of reality. On the other hand, the assertion that spiritual truths can be proven from a scientific point of view, was a constant theme of Blavatsky's claims. The efforts of the Theosophists were focused on the legitimation of all forms of extrasensory and mystical experience.{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|p=165}}

== Theosophical psychophysiology ==
{{Main article|Thought-Forms (book)}}
A few years after Blavatsky's death, the "second generation" of the Theosophists came to the leadership of the [[Theosophical Society Adyar|Theosophical Society]].{{sfn|Wessinger|2013}} As Hammer wrote, during this period, the "foci" of the Theosophical scientism shifted from the theory of evolution to other areas of science.{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=222}} [[Charles Leadbeater]], who became "the chief ideologist" of the Society, had involved with [[Annie Besant]] in the study of a functioning of the human mind. A religious studies scholar Gregory Tillett wrote that, according their claim, the functioning of mind "extrudes into the external world" the thought-forms which can be observed using clairvoyance methods.{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=224}} In 1901 Besant and Leadbeater published a book named ''[[Thought-Forms (book)|Thought-Forms: A Record of Clairvoyant Investigation]]'' contained a lot of color illustrations of forms, "created," according to its authors, by thoughts, emotions, and senses of men, as well by music. They argued that main source of the forms is the [[Aura (paranormal)|aura of man]], the outer part of the cloud-like substance of his "[[Subtle body|subtle bodies]]," interpenetrating each other, and extending beyond the confines of his physical body.{{sfnm|Hammer|2003|1p=55|Wessinger|2013|2p=36}}{{refn|group=note|In Hammer's opinion, "Leadbeater proposed a theory of the human aura" based on some Blavatsky's ideas.{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=223}} Truly, according to Blavatsky, "Every person emits a magnetic exhalation or aura."{{sfn|Blavatsky|1877a}} Goodrick-Clarke noted that a Japanese scientist [[Hiroshi Motoyama]] has expanded Leadbeater's concepts "through [[Electrophysiology|electrophysiological]] experimental work concerning the subtle network of [[chakra]]s and [[Nadi (yoga)|nadis]] as conductors of [[prana|energy]] in the [[Subtle body|subtle bodies]]."{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=235}}}}

== Theosophical chemistry ==
{{Main article|Occult Chemistry}}
According to Hammer and other scholars, in parallel with the "[[psychophysiology|psychophysiological]]" researches, the Theosophists were busy an occult chemistry based on a "greatly modified" atomic theory. Leadbeater began "the occult investigation" of chemical elements as early as 1895, and Besant soon joined him. They argued that, using clairvoyance, can describe the intra-atomic structure of any element. In their words, each element composed of atoms containing a certain number of "smaller particles." They published "these and other results" in 1908 in a book ''[[Occult Chemistry|Occult Chemistry: Clairvoyant Observations on the Chemical Elements]].'' Hammer wrote, "Although Leadbeater was the principal clairvoyant, the enduring interest in... chemistry is probably due to Annie Besant's fascination with science, especially chemistry."{{sfnm|Hammer|2003|1pp=222–23|Wessinger|2013|2p=36|DeGracia|2006|3pp=131–148}}{{refn|group=note|[[René Guénon]] wrote that the "detailed description of different kinds of atoms" by Besant and Leadbeater can be termed as "pseudo-scientific fantasies."{{sfn|Guénon|2004|p=101}}}}

== Theosophy and physics ==
A historian of religion Egil Asprem informed that in 1923, an astronomer and Theosophist G. E. Sutcliffe published a book ''Studies in Occult Chemistry and Physics'' which was a "critical analysis" of the [[theory of relativity]]. The author has pursued the goal: to equalize the meaning of "Eastern" and "Western science," describing their "as two complementary 'schools'." In this book, the theory of relativity is regarded as the highest achievement of "Western science," whereas the results of the Theosophical study "of atoms and etheric structures" known as "occult chemistry" are presented as the achievement of "the 'Eastern' school".{{sfnm|Sutcliffe|1923|1pp=v–vi|Asprem|2013|2p=415}} In an effort to show that the results of occult research can be compared with the theory of relativity, Sutcliffe "proposes a wholly new theory of gravity," based on physics of [[Luminiferous aether|ether]]. From his reasoning it can be seen that he is thoroughly erudite in the Theosophical literature, while also having a background in "conventional physics from Britain" in the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century. Sutcliffe tries to reinterpret the theory of [[Albert Einstein]] in "a tradition of British anti-relativism",  operating with the liberal "concept of ether."{{refn|group=note|"Ether physics was a crucial component of physics in Britain, and was part of the curriculum at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], as late as
1910."{{sfn|Asprem|2013|p=416}}}} The concept of Sutcliffe is based on "contraction and expansion of the accompanying ether of bodies," so, according to him, gravitation "is one of the effects of an expanding sphere of ether," and the electrical phenomena are a function of the "contracting sphere."{{sfnm|Sutcliffe|1923|1p=xv|Asprem|2013|2p=416}}

Professor Taimni wrote that the theory of relativity apparently gave "a new direction to our civilization" and created problems that "are a challenge" to our current worldview and ways of thinking. In the "scientific circles" it is considered that if mathematics is used to prove something, then the question "is finally settled", and it can't be discussed. However, most such conclusions are not always based on proven assumptions, and this makes possible a mistake in "the final conclusion." Often one does not take into account the fact that mathematical inference can then be correct if he accepts into account "all factors" concerning this issue, and if it is not, the conclusion may be incorrect "or only partially correct." This should be borne in mind when considering the nature of space and time, as well as the Einstein's method used to solve this problem. He based his theory "only on facts of the physical world" and if there are other, more [[Plane (esotericism)|subtle worlds]] "besides the physical",{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=936}}{{sfn|Трефилов|1994|p=237}} and they exist in accordance with the occult, then his theory has no authority "with respect to those worlds." Since his theory is based only on physical facts, it can be true, at best, "only for purely physical phenomena." It can't be assumed that it reveals the nature of space and time "in general", because it is presented "to the human mind" functioning within the boundaries of "the physical brain." "The very fact that the concept of the [[Spacetime|time-space continuum]]" given in his theory is too difficult for the human mind, indicates its limitations. In fact, its author simply tried to interpret "imperfectly the shadows of some realities cast on the screen in a shadow play of the mind."{{sfn|Taimni|1969|pp=226–227, 334}}

Taimni wrote that anyone who closely studied the nature of space and time could be convinced that the human mind is "also a very important factor in this problem", therefore, to understand the space and time, it is necessary to take into account this factor. And since the human mind is not only what is manifested through its physical brain, but has "many degrees of subtlety and modes of expression," the entire human nature is "really involved in the problem" of space and time. And therefore only the one who "dived" into his consciousness and has "unraveled" his deepest secrets, having reached the source from which space and time come,{{refn|group=note|According to the occult science, space and time are the result of the manifestation of their archetypal principles, called "Mahakasha" and "[[Mahakala]]" respectively.{{sfn|Bilimoria|1997|p=146}}}} is really capable of saying what the true nature "of these basic realities of the universe is." "Who is more competent to pronounce a correct opinion about the nature of an orange," Taimni is asking, "he who has merely scratched the rind or he who has peeled the orange and eaten it?"{{sfn|Taimni|1969|pp=334–335}}{{refn|group=note|In Taimni's opinion, Einstein's theory does not imply the existence "of super-physical worlds," ignores "the existence of mind and consciousness as principles independent of the physical world," suggests that there are "only three dimensions of space and one of time" and does not take into account "many other facts" of reality that are "part of the Occult Doctrine" and were repeatedly tested "by [[clairvoyance|seers]], occultists and [[mysticism|mystics]] of all ages."{{sfn|Taimni|1974|pp=6–7}}}}{{refn|group=note|Lopez claimed, "To understand the nature of reality, one must achieve [[buddhahood]]."{{sfn|Lopez|2009|p=19}}}}

According to words of Kuhn, Blavatsky claimed, "It is on the doctrine of the illusive nature of matter, and the infinite divisibility of the atom, that the whole science of Occultism is built."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1888a|1p=520|Kuhn|1992|2p=261}} The researchers in esotericism Emily B. Sellon and Renée Weber have written: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Anticipating the conclusions of Einsteinian relativity and [[Field (physics)|field]] theory, as well as [[quantum mechanics]], Blavatsky proposed a universe in which billiard-ball atoms and push-pull forces were replaced by space, time, motion, and energy, yielding a picture of a dynamic universe far in advance of her time."{{sfn|Sellon, Weber|1992|p=326}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== New paradigm ==
According to a philosopher and religious studies scholar [[Vladimir Trefilov]], the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|modern Theosophists]] were among the first who attempted to create "a new paradigm of thinking through the synthesis of scientific and non-scientific knowledge."{{sfn|Трефилов|1994|p=234}} As professor of Buddhist studies and Buddhist [[Evgeny Torchinov]] said, "Discussion between physicists, philosophers, psychologists, and scholars of religious studies in order to find the solutions of a problem of the [[Paradigm shift|general scientific paradigm change]], the isomorphism of consciousness and physical world,{{refn|group=note|According to Indian occultists, the manifested Universe is the product of interaction of two primary Principles: "'''[[Shiva]]''', or '''Consciousness''' and '''[[Shakti]]''', or '''Power'''."{{sfnm|Woodroffe|1973|1p=23|Bilimoria|1997|2p=133}}}} and even the [[ontology]] of consciousness in general could well take place, if don't resort to sticking labels like 'mysticism'."{{sfn|Торчинов|2007|loc=Заключение}} Professor [[Stanislav Grof]], psychologist, wrote that Western science has raised matter to a status of the prime cause of Universe, reducing life, consciousness, and mind to the forms of its accidental products. Dominance in Western science a [[Mechanistic Materialism|paradigm of Newton-Descartes]] became one of the causes of the emergence and development of the "planetary crisis."{{sfn|Grof|1998|loc=Ch. 6}}

An Ukrainian philosopher [[#Theosophists-scientists|Julia Shabanova]] has believed that "the post-materialist scientific paradigm and the worldview idealism" should become a conceptual basis of the future civilization.{{sfn|Шабанова|2016|p=197}} The Russian cyberneticist [[Sergei P. Kurdyumov|Sergei Kurdyumov]] and [[Doktor nauk|philosopher]] Helena Knyazeva, in a book ''Laws of Evolution and Self-organization of Complex Systems,'' suggested that the "paradigm of self-organization and non-linearity" would become the basis of the new scientific paradigm, taking from the West "the positive aspects of the tradition of analysis", and from the East—ideas of the [[Holism|integrity]], cyclicity, and the one law for Universe and man.{{sfn|Князева, Курдюмов|1994|pp=73, 223}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Eastern ideas about the universal coherence, the unity of everything in the world, and the cyclic flowing into each other of Non-Being and [[Being]] (unmanifested and manifested) can resonate with the [[Synergetics (Haken)|synergetic]] models... We can assume that there is a kind of an origin environment, in which all other observable and studied environments have grown. Then all the environments, with which we are dealing in life and scientific experiment, appear as some fluctuations (disturbances), the visible to us manifestations (modifications) of this one substrate—the origin environment."{{sfn|Князева, Курдюмов|1994|p=57}}{{refn|group=note|[[Fritjof Capra]] wrote in 1982, "The parallels to [[Eastern mysticism]] are appearing not only in physics but also in biology, psychology and other sciences...

According to a historian of religion Egil Asprem, an Indian scientist and engineer Edi Bilimoria{{sfn|Theowiki}} was one of the most significant characters "in the Theosophical discourse on science of the last decade and a half." In his work ''Mirages in Western Science Resolved by Occult Science'' he confirms the division into "Western" and "occult" science which took place already at the time of the formation of the Theosophical Society, and also "conceptually" updates the discussion of "modern physics and cosmology." Playing back the well-known Theosophical "rhetoric," Bilimoria suggests to move forward to "a reconciliation and reuniting of the wise old parent, Occult Science, with its adolescent prodigal son, Western science."{{sfnm|Bilimoria|1997|1p=v|Asprem|2013|2p=424}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Occult science is not bent on toppling, but rather on uplifting Western science to an even nobler position, by using examples from Western science itself to show how it is rooted in the deeper substratum of Occult Science and Philosophy."{{sfnm|Bilimoria|1997|1p=196|Asprem|2013|2p=425}}{{refn|group=note|Speaking of the ancient occult science, mahatma Kuthumi wrote, "Our laws are as immutable as those of Nature, and they were known to man and eternity before this strutting game cock, modern science, was hatched."{{sfn|Barker|1924|p=144}} Thus, according to Bilimoria, the fact of the "expanding Universe was well known" to occultists else in antiquity, "only in greater" detail in comparison with the concept of the "modern cosmologists."{{sfn|Bilimoria|1997|p=142}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Criticism of Theosophy ==
{{See also|Theosophical mysticism#Criticism}}
A Russian philosopher [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]] wrote that modern Theosophy is a doctrine not only "anti-religious" and "antiphilosophic", but also "anti-scientific."{{sfn|Соловьёв|1911|p=397}} A religious philosopher [[Sergius Bulgakov]] stated that [Blavatskian] Theosophy, trying to replace religion with itself, turns into a "vulgar pseudoscientific mythology."{{sfn|Bulgakov|2012|p=37}} In [[Nikolai Berdyaev|Berdyaev's]] opinion, modern Theosophy does not represent a synthesis of religion, philosophy and science, as its adherents say, but there is a "mixture" of them, in which there is no real religion, no real philosophy, no real science.{{sfn|Berdyaev|1972|p=299}}

The ambiguous attitude of the Theosophists towards science was especially abruptly criticized by the servants of the Christian church.{{refn|group=note|See also: [[Christianity and Theosophy#Confrontations]].}} In 1912, John Driscoll, an author of ''[[The Catholic Encyclopedia]],'' has described [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy's]] attitude to science as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Modern theosophy claims to be a definite science. Its teachings are the product of thought, and its source is consciousness, not any Divine revelation. &lt;...&gt; Judging it as presented by its own exponents, it appears to be a strange mixture of mysticism, charlatanism, and thaumaturgic pretension combined with an eager effort to express its teaching in words which reflect the atmosphere of Christian ethics and modern scientific truths."{{sfn|Driscoll|1912|pp=627–8}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A Russian theologian, [[Andrey Kuraev]], accused the Theosophists of violation of the principles of scientific aethics, arguing they do not react to the opponents' objections, do not bring "a scientific arguments in support of their position", and also put themselves "beyond all criticism from side of science." In support of his words, Kurayev quoted Blavatsky's statement on the need to fight with "every modern scholar's" pretension to evaluate "of ancient Esotericism", when he is not "a Mystic" or "a Kabalist".{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1897|1p=13|Кураев|2000|2p=129}} In connection with the special attention of the Theosophists to the theory of evolution, a Russian Orthodox cleric and theologian Dimitry Drujinin wrote that "Theosophy began to parasitize on the central tendencies of thought and science of its time." And also: "The rough and cheeky Blavatsky's criticism of Darwinism turned into personal insults to scholars." According to Drujinin, "the statements of Theosophy are an absurd nonsense."{{sfn|Дружинин|2012|pp=79–81}} Lydia Fesenkova, an employee of the [[Institute of Philosophy, Russian Academy of Sciences|Institute of philosophy]], also severely criticized the occult statements of Blavatsky, which described anthropogenesis: "From the point of view of science, such beliefs are an explicit profanity and don't have the right to exist in the serious literature."{{sfn|Фесенкова|2004|p=93}}

An [[:ru:Действительные члены РАН|academician]] [[:ru:Вячеслав Стёпин|Viacheslav Stepin]] answering the question about [[pseudoscience]] said, "The dominant value of the scientific rationality begins to influence other spheres of culture—and religion, the myth are modernized often under this influence.

The '''University Marine Biological Station Millport''' (UMBSM) was a [[higher education]] institution located on the island of [[Great Cumbrae]] in the [[Firth of Clyde]], [[Scotland]], and run by the University of [[University of London|London]] (of which it was a [[University of London#Central academic bodies|central academic body]]). It closed in 2013 and is now Millport Field Centre, run by the [[Field Studies Council]].

Located just outside the town, it has an extensive curriculum and research programme, with an influx of students throughout the academic year. A Museum and Aquarium (named after the founder, [[David Robertson (naturalist)|David Robertson]]) is open to visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.field-studies-council.org/centres/scotland/millport/learn/robertson-museum-and-aquarium.aspx|title=Robertson Museum and Aquarium|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=FSC Millport|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2003 the station took delivery of the [[Macduff, Aberdeenshire|Macduff]]-built, 22-metre marine [[research vessel]] RV ''Aora''. The station also functions as a Meteorological Office Weather Station and Admiralty Tide Monitor.

==History==
[[File:Marine Biological Station, Millport - geograph.org.uk - 426885.jpg|thumb|The University Marine Biological Station Millport]]
''The Ark'', an {{convert|84|ft|m|abbr=off|adj=on}} lighter, was fitted out as a floating laboratory by the father of modern [[oceanography]], [[John Murray (oceanographer)|Sir John Murray]]. She formed the Scottish Marine Station for 12 years from 1884. In 1885 she was moved from [[Granton, Edinburgh|Granton]] and drawn up on the shore at Port Loy, Cumbrae.&lt;ref name="UniGlasgowHistory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.field-studies-council.org/centres/scotland/millport/about/history.aspx|title=History - FSC Millport|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attracted a stream of distinguished scientists, drawn by the richness of the fauna and flora of the Firth of Clyde, but closed in 1903.

In Millport, an amateur naturalist, David Robertson, was encouraged by meeting [[Anton Dohrn]] and by the wealth of findings from the [[Challenger expedition]]. In 1894 he formed a committee to build a marine station in Millport and took over ''The Ark''. Millport Marine Biological Station was opened in 1897 by [[John Murray (oceanographer)|Sir John Murray]]. ''The Ark'' was totally destroyed by a great storm on the night of 20 January 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = PG Moore &amp; JA Gibson|date=January 2007| title = Marine Station at Millport| journal = The Linnean| volume = 23| issue = 1| pages = 31–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 July 1904 ''Scotia'', the ship of Dr [[William Speirs Bruce]]'s [[Scottish National Antarctic Expedition]], returned to her first Scottish landing site, on the Isle of Cumbrae.

From this beginning the station was gradually built up to its present size. The original building proved too small for the purpose and an architectural copy was built alongside. From 1966 to 1987 the station ran under the Directorship of [[Ronald Ian Currie]] [[FRSE]] who was responsible for the creation of RV Challenger and RV Calanus.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/obits_alpha/currie_ronald.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012 it was announced that the University Marine Biological Station Millport would be forced to close after the [[Higher Education Funding Council for England]] withdrew the grant of 400,000 pounds that it gave to the [[University of London]] to run the station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-20797045 |title=University Marine Biological Station Millport may close |date=20 December 2012 |author= |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=8 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; UMBSM closed on 31 October 2013.&lt;ref name="UniGlasgowHistory" /&gt;

Ownership was transferred to the [[Field Studies Council]] on 1 January 2014.&lt;ref name="UniGlasgowHistory" /&gt; In May 2014 a four-million-pound package of funding was announced that is intended to allow a comprehensive programme of development and refurbishment to be completed over five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buildscotland.co.uk/construction-news/180652/millport-marine-research-stations-reopens|title=Millport marine research station reopens|last=|first=|date=16 May 2014|website=|publisher=Build Scotand|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{dablink|"Standing water" redirects here. For the song "Standing Water" by [[Soul Asylum]], see [[The Silver Lining (Soul Asylum album)|The Silver Lining]]}}
'''Water stagnation''' occurs when [[water]] stops [[Environmental flow|flowing]]. '''Stagnant water''' can be a major [[environmental hazard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/general-article/panama-fever/ |title=General Article: Yellow Fever and Malaria in the Canal |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2010 |website=Panama Canal (film) |series=American Experience |publisher=WGBH Educational Foundation |location=Boston, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dangers==
[[Malaria]] and [[dengue]] are among the main dangers of stagnant water, which can become a breeding ground for the [[mosquitoes]] that transmit these diseases.&lt;ref name="WHO health risks"&gt;{{cite report |date=2013 |title=Health Risks Associated with Stagnant Water |series=Recommendations for Occupational Health and Safety Following Disasters |url=http://www.wpro.who.int/philippines/typhoon_haiyan/media/health_risks_associated_with_stagnant_water.pdf |publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stagnant water can be dangerous for drinking because it provides a better incubator than running water for many kinds of [[bacteria]] and [[parasite]]s. Stagnant water is often contaminated with [[human]] and [[animal]] [[feces]], particularly in [[deserts]] or other areas of low rain.&lt;ref name="WHO health risks"/&gt;

Stagnant water may be classified into the following basic, although overlapping, types:

* Water body stagnation (stagnation in swamp, lake, lagoon, river, etc.)
* Surface and ground waters stagnation
* Trapped water stagnation. The water may be trapped in human artifacts (discarded cans, plant pots, tires, dug-outs, roofs, etc.), as well as in natural containers, such as hollow tree trunks, leaf sheath etc.

To avoid ground and surface water stagnation, [[drainage]] of surface and [[subsoil]] is advised. Areas with a shallow water table are more susceptible to ground water stagnation due to the lower availability of natural soil drainage.

==Life that may thrive in stagnant water==
Some plants prefer flowing water, while others, such as [[Lotus (genus)|lotus]]es, prefer stagnant water.

Various [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] [[bacteria]] are commonly found in stagnant water &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cabral|first1=João|title=Water Microbiology. Bacterial Pathogens and Water|journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health|date=October 10, 2010|pmc=2996186|pmid=21139855|doi=10.3390/ijerph7103657|volume=7|pages=3657–703}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  For this reason, pools of stagnant water have historically been used in processing [[hemp]] and some other [[fiber crops]], as well as [[Tilia|linden]] [[Bark (botany)|bark]] used for making [[bast shoe]]s. Several weeks of soaking makes [[bast fiber]]s easily separable due to bacterial and fermentative processes known as [[retting]].

*[[Denitrifying bacteria]]
*[[Leptospira]]
*[[Purple bacteria]] (both sulfur and non-sulfur)

===Fish===
* [[Lepisosteidae]] (gar).
* [[Northern snakehead]] fish
* [[Pygmy gourami]]....
* [[Spotted barb]]
* [[Walking catfish]]
* [[Asian swamp eel]]
[[Image:Mosquito larvae.jpg|thumb|200px|Mosquito [[larva]]e in stagnant water]]

===Insects===
Stagnant water is the favorite breeding ground for a number of [[insect]]s.
* [[Dragonfly]] nymphs
* [[Fly]] magnets
* [[Mosquito]] larvae
* [[Nepidae]] (water scorpions)

===Other===
* [[Algae]]
* [[Biofilm]]
* A number of species of [[frog]]s prefer stagnant water.
* Some species of [[turtle]]s
** [[Mata mota]]
