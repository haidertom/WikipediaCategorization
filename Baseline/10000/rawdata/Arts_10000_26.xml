'''2017 in film''' is an overview of events, including the highest-grossing films, award ceremonies, festivals, and a list of films released and notable deaths.

==Evaluation of the year==
[[Richard Brody]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' observed that for 2017, "the most important event in the world of movies was the revelation, in the ''[[The New York Times|Times]]'' and ''The New Yorker'', of [[Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations|sexual abuse]] by [[Harvey Weinstein]], and the [[Weinstein effect|resulting liberation of the long-stifled voices of the people who had been abused by him or other powerful figures]] in the movie business, and, for that matter, in other arts and industries, too." He emphasizes that in effect, "[w]hat's missing from the year-end list, and from the era in movies, isn't only the unmade work by these filmmakers but the artistry and the careers of cast and crew members who would have been in their unrealized films."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brody|first1=Richard|authorlink1=Richard Brody|title=The Best Movies of 2017|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/2017-in-review/the-best-movies-of-2017|website=[[The New Yorker]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast]]|accessdate=7 January 2018|date=8 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alciphron (1732) title page.jpg|thumb|''Alciphron'' title page (1732).]]
'''''Alciphron''''', or '''''The Minute Philosopher''''' is an [[anticatholic]] philosophical [[dialogue]] by the 18th-century Irish philosopher [[George Berkeley]] wherein Berkeley combated the arguments of [[free-thinkers]] such as [[Bernard Mandeville|Mandeville]] and [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Shaftesbury]] against the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[religion]]. It was first published in 1732.

The dialogue is primarily between four characters, the free-thinkers Alciphron and Lysicles, Berkeley's spokesman Euphranor, and Crito, who serves as a spokesman for traditional Christianity. The mostly-silent narrator of the dialogue is given the name Dion.

The work contains two especially notable sections:
* Dialogue IV, in which Berkeley presents a novel [[teleological argument]] for the existence of [[God]] based on Berkeley's theory of visual language, defended in the ''[[Essay Toward a New Theory of Vision]]'' (first published in 1709, and included with the first edition of ''Alciphron'').&lt;ref&gt;See David Kline, "Berkeley's Divine Language Argument" in Ernest Sosa, ed., ''Essays on the Philosophy of George Berkeley'' (Dordrecht: Reidel, 1987), repr. in David Berman, ed., ''Alciphron in Focus'' (London: Routledge, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Dialogue VII, in which Berkeley presents a novel theory of language which has been compared with the theory of language advocated by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] in his ''Philosophical Investigations''.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Flew, "Was Berkeley a Precursor of Wittgenstein?" in W. B. Todd, ed. ''Hume and the Enlightenment: Essays Presented to Ernest Campbell Mossner'' (Edinburgh: The University Press, 1974), repr. in Berman, ed., ''Alciphron''.&lt;/ref&gt;
In a later work, ''[[The Theory of Vision Vindicated and Explained]]'' (first published in 1733), Berkeley adduced the work of [[Alberto Radicati]] as evidence that the views advocated by the character Lysicles were not overly exaggerated (para. 5).

[[File:Ancona S.Ciriaco (43).JPG|thumb|right|250px|Ancona Cathedral, facade]]
'''Ancona Cathedral''' ({{lang-it|Duomo di Ancona}}, ''Basilica Cattedrale Metropolitana di San Ciriaco'') is a [[Roman Catholic]] [[cathedral]] in [[Ancona]], central [[Italy]], dedicated to Saint [[Cyriacus of Ancona]]. It is the seat of the [[Archbishop of Ancona]]. The building is an example of mixed [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]]-Byzantine and [[Gothic architecture in Italy|Gothic]] elements, and stands on the site of the former [[acropolis]] of the [[Greater Greece|Greek]] city, the Guasco hill which overlooks Ancona and its gulf.

==History==
Excavations carried on in 2016 proved that an [[Italic tribes|Italic temple]], perhaps dedicated to [[Aphrodite (mythology)|Aphrodite]], existed on the site as early as the 3rd century BC. On top of it, in the 6th century CE, a Palaeo-Christian church was built: this had a nave and three aisles with the entrance facing south-east (where the current Chapel of the Crucifix is). Some remains of it still in existence include a mosaic pavement and perimeter walls.

In 995–1015 a new church was built, which kept the original walls. In 1017 the renovated [[basilica]] received the [[relics]] of Saint [[Marcellinus of Ancona]] and Saint Cyriacus. Further enlargement works occurred between the late 12th and the early 13th centuries, with the addition of a transept to obtain a [[Greek cross]] plan, and an entrance towards the south-west, resulting in the church now facing the port and the new road entering the city. The transepts were at a higher level than the previous nave, and had apses. The church, previously dedicated to [[Saint Lawrence]], was re-dedicated to Saint Cyriacus the Martyr, the patron saint and (possibly) bishop of Ancona.
[[File:Ancona San Ciriaco.jpg|left|thumb|One of the red marble lions in the portal]]
An initial restoration took place in 1883. During [[World War I]], on 24 May 1915, the basilica was damaged by a bombardment of the [[Austro-Hungarian]] fleet. The damage was restored in 1920, but in [[World War II]] Anglo-American aerial bombings destroyed the south transept and the Crypt of Tears under it, along with the art treasures housed there. Once the transept was rebuilt, the church was officially reopened in 1951. Further damage was caused by an earthquake in 1972, followed by a new restoration and another official opening in 1977.

In 1926 the cathedral was declared a [[basilica minor]].

==Description==

===Exterior===
The edifice is built in white stone from [[Mount Conero]], with apses protruding from the transept's ends and an elevated body, with a dome at the crossing, in correspondence to the nave. All the external surfaces feature a decoration of [[Lombard band]]s. The bell tower is in an isolated position. It is mentioned from 1314 and was built above a pre-existing late 13th-century tower.

[[File:Ancona, Duomo di San Ciriaco, X-XII secolo (15).jpg|thumb|250px|The 1189 balustrade tiles]]

The façade, divided into three section, is preceded by a wide staircase; above it is a 13th-century Romanesque portal formed by a round arch supported by four columns. The anterior ones stand on lions in Veronese red marble, while the rear ones, added later by [[Luigi Vanvitelli]], are on a simple pedestal.

Under the arches are four reliefs depicting the symbols of the [[Four Evangelists|Evangelists]]. The portal is attributed to [[Giorgio da Como]] (c. 1228), and is in Romanesque-Gothic style, built in Conero white stone from [[Mount Conero]] and Veronese red marble. It is decorated by a series of columns holding ogival arches with reliefs of saints' busts, animal figures and vegetable motifs. Above the portal is a large [[oculus]] with a Romanesque frame between two single [[mullioned window]]s.

The dome is one of the most ancient in Italy. It has an ogival shape with a dodecagonal drum, standing on a square base with small decorative arches. It was built over the crossing in the 13th century, and is attributed to [[Margaritone d'Arezzo]] (1270). Together with the church of [[Basilica di Sant'Antonio da Padova|Sant'Antonio]] at [[Padua]] and [[St. Mark's Basilica]] in [[Venice]], it was one of the few contemporary examples of domes built in churches, instead than in separate baptisteries. The copper cover was added in the 16th century.

===Interior===
The interior is on the [[Greek cross]] plan. All the arms are divided into a nave and two aisles, with re-used antique Roman columns with Byzantine capitals. At the crossing is the internal part of the dome, which has [[pendentive]]s with Byzantine-style figures of praying angels. The dome is supported by cruciform cluster piers.

The side arms of the transept end in elevated apses, while the central arm of the [[Presbytery (architecture)|presbytery]] lost the original apse during the enlargement works of the 18th century. All the naves have hull-shaped, painted wooden vaults dating from the 15th century. At the beginning of the northern nave is the monument to a [[Fermo]] warrior from 1530.

The south transept is home to the Chapel of the Crucifix. Its screens (''transennae'') are formed by tiles with [[sgraffito]] decoration from a balustrade of 1189. They depict, on the left, [[Jeremiah]] and [[Habakkuk]]; the Eternal Father and the Blessed Virgin; an angel and Saint [[John the Evangelist]]; and Saint Cyriacus; and, on the right, figures of animals: two [[Crane (bird)|crane]]s on a pomegranate tree, an eagle, two peacocks on a tree and two gryphons. In the Crypt of Tears below, rebuilt after the devastation of World War II, are remains of ancient structures. The presbytery's arms house, in the northern aisles, the sepulchre of Blessed [[Girolamo Ginelli]] (d. 1506), made in 1509 by [[Giovanni Dalmata]].

The northern transept houses the Madonna Chapel, with a lavishly decorated niche designed by [[Luigi Vanvitelli]] in 1739, which is the site of a venerated 17th century image of the Madonna. Under the chapel is a crypt with the remains of [[Judas Cyriacus|Saint Cyriacus of Ancona]] (in a marble case), Saints Liberius and Marcellinus (in Sicilian jasper) and the ashes of [[Saint Palatia]]. The urns with bronze festoons were designed and executed between 1757 and 1760 by [[Gioacchino Varlè]].

It is closely modelled after the [[royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom]] with French and distinctive Canadian elements replacing or added to those derived from the British version.

The [[maple leaves]] in the shield, [[blazon]]ed "proper", were originally drawn [[Vert (heraldry)|vert]] (green) but were redrawn [[gules]] (red) in 1957 and a circlet of the [[Order of Canada]] was added to the arms for limited use in 1987. The shield design forms the [[Royal standards of Canada#Sovereign's standard|monarch's royal standard]] and is also found on the [[Canadian Red Ensign]]. The [[Flag of the Governor General of Canada]], which formerly used the shield over the [[Union Flag]], now uses the [[crest (heraldry)|crest]] of the arms on a blue field.

The arms are embossed on the cover of any [[Canadian nationality law|citizen]]'s [[Canadian passport]], in order to legally signify and symbolize that the bearer is travelling under the aid of the [[The Crown#Concept|Crown of Canada]].

Nine quarterings on a shield was considered too complex&lt;ref name=RHSC/&gt; for a national symbol and by 1915 a push had begun to design a new coat of arms for Canada.&lt;ref name=fraser2&gt;{{cite book|last=Fraser|first=Alistair B|title=The Flags of Canada|date=30 January 1998|chapter=Chapter I, Canada's National Symbols|url=http://fraser.cc/FlagsCan/index.html|chapterurl=http://fraser.cc/FlagsCan/Nation/NatSym.html|accessdate=1 October 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080915061016/http://fraser.cc/FlagsCan/index.html| archivedate=15 September 2008| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A committee was formed in 1919 to pursue the issue, eventually agreeing that the elements of the new arms would reference the Royal Arms of England, Ireland, Scotland, and France, with maple leaves representing Canada, though there was at the time no consensus on how the leaves were to be used.&lt;ref name=fraser2/&gt; The decision was settled by 1920, and the committee conferred with the [[College of Arms]] in London, only to face resistance to the use of the Royal Arms from the [[Garter King of Arms]].&lt;ref name=fraser2/&gt; After some manoeuvring, including the personal intervention of [[Winston Churchill]], the new arms of Canada were eventually formally requested by an [[Order in Council]] on 30 April 1921 and adopted on 21 November of the same year by proclamation of King [[George V]] as the Arms or Ensigns Armorial of the Dominion of Canada.&lt;ref name=proclamation&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/sc-cs/arm1_e.cfm |title=Ceremonial and Canadian Symbols Promotion – The arms of Canada |publisher=Canadian Heritage |date=23 June 2008 |accessdate=21 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924075037/http://www.pch.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/sc-cs/arm1_e.cfm|archivedate=24 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="London Gazette 1921 Proclamation"&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=32525|page=9242|date=22 November 1921}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new layout closely reflected the arms of the United Kingdom&lt;ref name=description&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/sc-cs/arm2_e.cfm |title=Ceremonial and Canadian Symbols Promotion – The arms of Canada (page 2)|publisher=Canadian Heritage |date=23 June 2008 |accessdate=21 November 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924072609/http://www.pch.gc.ca/PROGS/CPSC-CCSP/sc-cs/arm2_e.cfm |archivedate=24 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the addition of maple leaves in the base and the reference to the French royal arms in the fourth quarter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/sc-cs/symboles-histoire-symbols-stories/symbole_canada_symbols-eng.pdf|title=Symbols of Canada|year=2008|publisher=Canadian Heritage|accessdate=20 November 2008|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proclamation also established white and red as the [[national colours of Canada]].

In 1931, with the passage of the Statute of Westminster, Canada and other Dominions became fully sovereign from the United Kingdom. This had the effect of elevating the Canadian coat of arms, which had been granted as deputed arms for particular uses in a colony, to the status of the royal arms of the King in right of the country, for general purposes throughout the country. They thus replaced the British coat of arms, which had previously been arms of general purpose throughout the British Empire, in court rooms and on government buildings to represent the ruling monarch. This change can be seen in the Great Seal of Canada of George VI, where the royal arms of Canada replaced the British arms, and is even more evident in the Great Seal of Canada for [[Elizabeth II]], where the title has been redefined as ''Queen of Canada''.&lt;ref name=Swann&gt;{{cite book|last=Swann|first=Conrad|title=Canada Symbols of Sovereignty: An investigation of the arms and seals borne from the earliest times to the present in connection with public authority in and over Canada. along with consideration of some connected flags|chapter=Chapter I, Arms of dominion and sovereignty and public authority|location=Toronto|publisher= University of Toronto Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are the coat of arms of the Queen of Canada.

By 1957, the arms were redrawn by [[Alan Beddoe]] so as to have red leaves and to change the royal crown from one of a Tudor design to one more resembling [[St. Edward's Crown]], as preferred by Queen Elizabeth II.&lt;ref name=RHSC/&gt; To mark the 1982 [[patriation]] of the Canadian constitution, which finally ended the last vestiges of British authority over Canada, a [[McGill University]] student named Bruce Hicks proposed to [[Secretary of State (Canada)|Secretary of State]] [[Gerald Regan]] that the motto of the [[Order of Canada]] be placed around the shield in order to bring these royal arms into line with other royal arms, many of which have been displayed in Canada during French, Scottish, and English colonisation, where those countries' highest national order of honour appears around the shield of the arms (the British arms displayed the [[Order of the Garter]], the Scottish [[Royal coat of arms of Scotland|royal arms]] the [[Order of the Thistle]], and the royalist [[National Emblem of France|arms of the French Regime]] the [[Order of the Holy Spirit]] and [[Order of Saint Michael]]).&lt;ref name=Hicks&gt;{{cite book|last=Hicks|first=Bruce|title=The Campaign to Change the Royal Arms of Canada (Hogtown Heraldry 12:4)}}&lt;/ref&gt; While unsuccessful in this first attempt, Hicks continued his campaign and was joined by a number of other amateur and professional heraldists. As a journalist in the parliamentary press gallery in Ottawa in the late 1980s and early 90s, Hicks strategically recast the change as something worth doing to commemorate the 25th Anniversary of the Order of Canada in 1992, an idea that was endorsed by the Advisory Committee on the Order of Canada.&lt;ref name=McCreery&gt;{{cite book|last=McCreery|first=Christopher|title=The Order of Canada: Its Origins, History and Development|isbn=0-8020-3940-5|location=Toronto|publisher=University of Toronto Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It took until 1994 for the Queen to approve the new design for general use, though the [[Canadian Heraldic Authority]] began to allow for its limited use beginning in 1987, where the arms were used to represent the Queen personally on letters patent granting new arms for distinguished Canadians.&lt;ref name=hansard/&gt; These letters patent carried the shield from the royal arms along with the annulus behind the shield bearing the motto of the [[Order of Canada]]—''Desiderantes meliorem patriam''. As soon as royal approval was forthcoming, the full achievement was redesigned for use by the federal government within the [[Federal Identity Program]].&lt;ref name=RHSC/&gt; The present design of the arms of Canada was drawn by [[Cathy Bursey-Sabourin]], Fraser Herald at the Canadian Heraldic Authority.&lt;ref name=Poster&gt;{{cite book|last=Canadian Heritage|title=The Arms of Canada (Ottawa: Government of Canada)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2008, Member of Parliament [[Pat Martin]] introduced a [[Motion (democracy)|motion]] into the [[House of Commons of Canada]] calling on the government to amend the coat of arms to incorporate symbols representing Canada's [[First Nations]], [[Inuit]], and [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/coat-of-arms-ignores-aboriginal-people-mp-says-1.748913 |title=Coat of arms ignores aboriginal people, MP say |date=20 June 2008 |publisher=CBC |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622224734/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/manitoba/story/2008/06/20/coat-arms.html |archive-date=22 June 2008 |dead-url=no |access-date=20 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AthenaSömek1.jpg|thumb|Athena Relief of Sömek]]
The '''Athena relief of Sömek''' is a Greco-Roman [[rock relief]], located some two kilometres north of the village of [[Sömek, Silifke|Sömek]] in [[Silifke]] district of [[Mersin province]] in Turkey, near the valley of the [[Limonlu Çayı|Limonlu]] river, the ancient Lamos. In antiquity, the river formed the border between "Rugged [[Cilicia]]" (Kilikia Tracheia) in the west and "Flat Cilicia" (Kilikia Pedias) in the east.

== Description ==
[[File:AthenaSömek3.jpg|thumb|Right pilaster with symbols and candelabrum]]
The relief is carved in the living rock at a height of some 1.5 metres above the ground. It has a total height of 1.3 metres. In a niche finished with a conch-shaped top, the image of a woman is found, who can be identified as the goddess [[Athena]] thanks to the inscription, among other things. On both sides the niche is formed from blocky [[pilaster]]s, topped by wide capitals. The goddess is dressed in a [[peplos]], the ''apoptygma'', or upper layer, of which is bound by a girdle at the waist. On the lower part, the robe is tightly fitted to her body, such that her calves are clearly visible underneath. The material covers up her ankles and feet, at the sides of it wrinkle lines go from it to the ground.
[[File:AthenaSömek2.jpg|thumb|left|Inscription]]
The right arm of the figure is raised and holds a lance. Her left, pointing down to the ground, holds a shield on edge. The lance rests on a column, which connects directly to the left pilaster. A snake winds around the lance and column, with its lower end reaching along the ground to Athena's feet. The head and mane of a bridled horse can be seen above the shield and left arm of the goddess and its hindquarters disappear behind her right arm. On the right pilaster there is a star, a crescent moon and a thunderbolt to be seen. Between the moon and the thunderbolt, traces of a servered head can be made out. Similar traces are found to the left of the left pilaster, which is itself undecorated. To the right of the righthand limit of the image, a symbol has been engraved, consisting of a stand with two crescent moons on top and a ball with star. Serra Durugönül, who investigated the Cilician rock reliefs in the 1980s, thought this was a candelabrum, that is a cult object, to be interpreted as a simplified depiction of a [[Judaism|Jewish]] [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]].

Between the lance on the left and the female figure an inscription of 13 lines is engaved in a narrow field. In it the goddess is referred to as ΑΘΗΝΑ ΚΡΙΣΟΑ (Athena Krisoa);. The [[epithet]] ΚΡΙΣΟΑ, derived from a place name, indicates a local variant of the divinity, but the place connected with the epithet cannot yet be located. It would certainly have been found in the north of Rough Cilica, however.  The same epithet shows up in another inscription in the area and in both inscriptions Athena is also referred to as ΟΡΕΙΑ (Oreia, meaning "mountaindweller")&lt;ref&gt;On the cult of Athena Oreia, which is attested only in Cilicia, see Emanuela Borgia: ''Il culto di Athena Oreia in Cilicia.'' In: Michel Mazoyer (Hrsg.): ''La campagne antique: espace sauvage, terre domestiquée.'' Paris 2003, {{ISBN|2-7475-4977-1}}, S. 73–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretation and Dating ==
The depiction of the goddess corresponds to the [[Athena Parthenos]] type, modelled on [[Phidias]]' free-standing statue in the [[Parthenon]] on the [[Athens|Athenian]] [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]]. Numerous imitations of this statue were made even in ancient times - another one has also been found in Cilicia. Similarities with Phidias' original include, above all, the clothing, the shield and the column standing on the left. In the original statue, this was a support of the right hand, in wehich Athena held [[Nike (goddess)|Nike]]. Even though this no longer has a function, since this statue is carved in relief and doesn't hold Nike, the artist was unwilling to omit this characteristic attribute.

Particularly on account of the type of clam-shell vault of the relief, Durugönül identified two possible dates for the creation of the relief. The first would be the time of the Emperors [[Claudius]] and [[Nero]] in the 1st century, the second would be the period after [[Hadrian]] in the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD.  She inclines to the second, dating the relief to the 2nd century, on the basis of comparison with other rock reliefs of [[Asia Minor]], among which is that of a moongod at [[Sumatar Harabesi]] in [[Osrhoene]], which an inscription dates after 165.

[[File:Den tyske ordens skjold.svg|thumb|right|Emblazonment of the Order of Teutonic Knights.]]
[[File:Teuton flag.svg|thumb|right|Emblazonment of the Order's Grand Master.]]
The '''''Banderia Prutenorum''''' is a manuscript of 48 [[parchment]] sheets, 18.6 by 29.3&amp;nbsp;cm (7.3 by 11.5&amp;nbsp;inches), composed by [[Jan Długosz]] and illuminated by Stanisław Durink, listing 56 ''vexillae'', or [[banner]]s, of the Order of the [[Teutonic Knights]]. The title means ''Blazons of the Prussians''.&lt;ref&gt;According to ''Webster's Third New International Dictionary'', [[Gothic language|Gothic]] has ''bandwa'', "sign", from which Germanic [http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE36.html *bandwa-], "sign", is reconstructed. From this comes [[Late Latin]] ''banderia'', which Webster's hypothesizes has a Latin formative suffix, -arium. It could as well be from a Germanic plural. Banner comes from it, but the earlier meaning was not the cloth but the signs. [[Blazon]] has a similar origin from a different but synonymous root, [http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE50.html *bhel-], at least in the sense of "sign." In [[Middle English]] it has the connotation of shield, but this also is a secondary development. Heraldry originates with the Roman army, who put their unit signs on shields but not flags. ''Banderia'' therefore imitate the shield blazons in cloth. Royal and national "blazons" go beyond the original intent, which was only unit identification, and are therefore a later development.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Prutenorum'' is the [[genitive]] plural of ''Pruteni'', [[Old Prussians|Prussians]].

In Polish the name is ''Chorągwie Pruskie''. ''Chorągwie'' can mean ''banner'', ''standard'', or ''regiment''. The heraldic term [[blazon]] in English is probably the exact meaning.

==Historical circumstances of the Banderia==
The work describes the [[gonfalon]]s, or battle flags,&lt;ref&gt;The original Germanic [http://www.bartleby.com/61/96/G0189600.html *gundfanon-] meant "battle-flag". According to ''Webster's Third New International Dictionary'', this descends through [[Old High German]] ''gunfano'', "[[war flag]]" to [[Middle French]] and modern English gonfanon, a very rare word, and through [[Italian language|Italian]] ''gonfalone'' to English [[gonfalon]], synonymous with gonfanon. The modern terms have ceased to mean battle flags except when historians use them to refer to battle flags.&lt;/ref&gt; collected from the field after the [[Battle of Grunwald]] in 1410 AD. This battle was a major confrontation between the Teutonic Order and the allied forces of [[Poles]] and [[Lithuanians]], whom the Order was trying to conquer. At that time, the Order had succeeded in subjecting or eliminating the western Balts, including the Prussians; however, the Teutonic Knights were decisively defeated by the joint forces of the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland]] and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania under the command of the Polish King [[Władysław II Jagiełło]].

At the end of the battle, the major officers of the Order lay dead on the field beside the standards under which they had fought. Some units escaped with their standards. The Banderia does not describe all the order's flags. The flags were collected and stored at [[Wawel Cathedral]] in [[Cracow]]. They are known to have been there in 1603, after which they disappeared. They have been recreated, starting in the 1900. In October 2009, as part of the preparations for the battle's anniversairy, Polish scholars and artists in Kraków have finished reconstructing all known standards.&lt;ref name=mp&gt;{{pl icon}} Magdalena Piwnicka, ''Znaki świetnego zwycięstwa'', Focus - Historia, Nr 7-8. 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
It was probably the Polish historian, [[Jan Długosz]], who commissioned the painter, Stanisław Durink of [[Cracow]], to illustrate the flags in 1448. Długosz then wrote the [[Latin]] descriptions. The work thus has the format of a catalog, with an [[Illuminated manuscript|illumination]] and Latin entry for each flag.

The flag is decorated with a heraldic blazon identifying the ''comturia'', or district, from which the soldiers of that unit came. The blazon might appear in any circumstances, such as in a [[coat of arms]] or on a shield, or in any conspicuous place. Its function was that of identification. The rules of heraldry were undoubtedly followed.

The title raises a few questions of language and society. In it a Polish scholar and historian is calling the conquerors of the Prussians by that very name, even though at the beginning of their conquest they found the name odious to them. Old Prussian speakers still lived in substantial numbers in east Prussia. As they were not excluded from military service, some must have fought for the order, and yet they are not distinguished from the Germans in any way.

''Banderium'' is in origin neither Latin nor Polish, but comes from the Germanic. The place names also are in their Germanic forms rather than their Polish ones. Why Długosz, a Polish historian, chose to use the Germanicized Prussian Latin is not clear.

==Location of the manuscript==
By some miracle, the manuscript survived World War II, even though it was given to [[Malbork]] castle by the Nazis for political purposes. After the war it showed up at a London auction house and was brought to its current location in the library of [[Jagiellonian University]].

==Notes on the work==
In the scholarly Latin of manuscript terminology, a ''[[recto]]'' page is "on the right side". The ''[[verso]]'' or "turned side" (the other side of the page) is therefore a left-hand page. This terminology has nothing to do with Długosz.

Durink states the width (''latitudo'') and length (''longitudo'') of each flag in units he calls ''ulne'' (classical ''ulnae''). These must be [[cubit]]s rather than [[ell]]s; i.e., one ''ulna'' is 18&amp;nbsp;inches by today's standard ell. The flags are generally longer than they are wide.

The '''Birds Mosaic''' is a mosaic floor that was discovered in [[Caesarea]], [[Israel]].

==Discovery==
[[File:Caesarea-Maritima-2-234.jpg|200px|thumb|right|General view of the mosaic. In the middle are cisterns.]]
The mosaic was discovered in 1950 during a military exercise, and after five years was covered in sand to prevent deterioration. Archaeologist [[Shmuel Yeivin]] was the first to publish about it, and described it as a church due to the apse located in the east of the building. Since no pillars were found, he proposed that the church was without a roof. But in 1985 archaeologist [[Ronny Reich]] concluded that the site was the central part of a villa, rather than a church.

In 2004, the [[Israel Antiquities Authority]] removed the 70 cm thick dirt layer covering the mosaic, restored and strengthened it, and prepared it for visitors. The site was opened to the public in October 2005. Entrance to the site is free, and it is possible to walk on the mosaic.

==The site==

The mosaic floor belongs to a [[Byzantine]] palace that was built in the end of the 6th century or beginning of the 7th century, and which lay outside the walls of [[Caesarea Maritima|ancient Caesarea]]. The floor covered the central courtyard of the palace, which was led to by a portico on the west side. Surrounding it was a colonnade, rooms, and additional courtyards with mosaic floors. The built area of the palace was about 1500 square meters, and the entire settlement covered about 3 [[dunam]]s. It belonged to a wealthy Christian family, but no indications of its identity have been found. The building had an additional story which also had mosaic floors, parts of which collapsed when the palace was destroyed by fire, apparently during the [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|Arab conquest]] in 640. The wooden beams of the second floor were burned, and parts of its mosaic were found on the floor of the first story.
===The mosaic===
The mosaic takes up an area of 16 by 14.5 meters. It includes a frame decorated with fruit trees bearing large and beautiful fruit. Between the trees are large mammals in states of movement. The mammals include lions, leopards, bears, ibex, dogs, elephants, gazelle, oxen, wild boar, horse, and goat.

The center of the mosaic (surrounded by the frame) consists of 120 round medallions populated by large colorful birds, which give the mosaic its name. The medallions form 12 rows, with different kinds of birds in each row - [[peacocks]], [[storks]], [[pelicans]], [[herons]], [[pheasants]], grey-headed [[swamphen]], [[duck]], [[flamingo]], [[guineafowl]], [[ostrich]], [[rock partridge]] - all of them facing to the left. The sequence of birds is such that the same species is repeated along a diagonal in the medallion array.

Under the mosaic is a plastered cistern, to which drained rainwater from the entire complex. In the northwest corner of the site was a reservoir which received its water from a well. The complex was too high to receive water from Caesarea's aqueduct, so it needed an independent water supply.

===Table===
Another, unique, finding at the site was a table cover in the shape of the letter D, tiled with squares and triangles. The table was made with the "glass-gold" method - two layers of glass with a gold layer between it, and figures of crosses and flowers in the gold layer. When the palace was burned, the table overturned and was burned, while the cover was preserved on the floor. This cover was removed from the site for preservation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2822">The '''Black Arts Council''' (BAC) was an organization founded in 1968 to advocate for African-American artists and support their community.  Founded by [[Cecil Fergerson]] and Claude Booker (black art preparators who worked at the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]], or LACMA), the organization comprised African-American artists, staff members, and other city residents who aimed to promote African-American art in Los Angeles.  When the Black Arts Council was founded in 1968, every LACMA board member was white.&lt;ref name=cooks&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=sxHCWUnRGyQC&amp;pg=PA87#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Cooks].&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization grew to over 1,000 members in two years.&lt;ref name=Holmes&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holmes|first1=Emory|title=A Pit Bull in the World of Fine Art|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/feb/14/magazine/tm-7907|accessdate=14 December 2014|work=Los Angeles Times|date=1999-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It not only pressured LACMA to organize exhibitions for African-American artists, but also did extensive work supporting artists outside the museum.&lt;ref name=Whos&gt;{{cite web|title=Two Centuries of Black American Art at LACMA: Who's Who|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|url=http://www.lacma.org/whos-who|website=LACMA|publisher=LACMA|accessdate=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BAC organized student field trips to art exhibits, gave lectures at schools, and curated art exhibitions at various community locations and events.&lt;ref name="Whos" /&gt;

The BAC's advocacy produced results in the form of two LACMA exhibitions: ''Three Graphic Artists: Charles White, [[David Hammons]], and Timothy Washington'' in 1971, and ''Panorama'' in 1972, featuring [[Noah Purifoy]],  [[John Outterbridge]], and [[Betye Saar]].&lt;ref name=Sirmans&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sirmans|first1=Franklin|title=Remembering Cecil Fergerson (1931–2013)|url=http://unframed.lacma.org/2013/09/23/remembering-cecil-fergerson-1931-2013|website=LACMA Unframed|accessdate=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These exhibits paved the path for LACMA's 1976 exhibition ''[[Two Centuries of Black American Art]]'', which traveled to the [[High Museum of Art]] in Atlanta, the [[Dallas Museum of Art|Dallas Museum of Fine Arts]], and the [[Brooklyn Museum]].&lt;ref name="Sirmans" /&gt;  

The BAC ceased activities in 1974 following Booker's death.&lt;ref name="Whos" /&gt;

==Portraits==
The artist, initially unidentified, was eventually revealed to be Conor Casby, a school teacher in his thirties from Claremorris, [[County Mayo]].&lt;ref name=could_be_charged/&gt; The first portrait was surreptitiously hung in the [[National Gallery of Ireland]] on 7 March 2009.&lt;ref name=teacher_questioned/&gt; Casby is said to have entered the National Gallery carrying a shoulder bag,&lt;ref name=exposed_to_ridicule/&gt; and located a free space for his portrait and its caption among other portraits of prominent Irish people such as [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]], [[W. B. Yeats]], and [[Bono]].&lt;ref name=exposed_to_ridicule/&gt; Casby then left the building unnoticed by security.&lt;ref name=exposed_to_ridicule/&gt; It was reported as having read: &lt;blockquote&gt;Brian Cowen, Politician 1960–2008. This portrait, acquired uncommissioned by the National Gallery, celebrates one of the finest politicians produced by Ireland since the foundation of the state. Following a spell at the helm of the Department of Finance during a period of unprecedented prosperity, Brian Cowen inherited the office of Taoiseach in 2008. Balancing a public image that ranges from fantastically intelligent analytical thinker to Big Ignorant Fucker from Offaly, the Taoiseach proves to be a challenging subject to represent.&lt;ref name=exposed_to_ridicule/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The National Gallery called gardaí after it discovered the unauthorised painting. It has claimed that it had been hanging in public view for no more than twenty minutes before it was removed,&lt;ref name=could_be_charged&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/7964096.stm|title=Cowen artist 'could be charged'|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=25 March 2009|accessdate=27 March 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302230238/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/7964096.stm|archivedate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; contradicting the ''[[Sunday Tribune]]'''s claim that it hung for over an hour.&lt;ref name=exposed_to_ridicule/&gt;

The following day, 8 March, Casby hung a second painting of Cowen in the [[Royal Hibernian Academy]] (RHA). A woman attempted to buy the RHA portrait before it was removed.&lt;ref name=exposed_to_ridicule/&gt;&lt;ref name=stunt_story_nut_hammer&gt;{{cite news|first=Ken |last=Foxe |url=http://www.tribune.ie/article/2009/mar/29/a-stunt-a-story-a-nut-and-a-hammer/ |title=A stunt, a story, a nut and a hammer |newspaper=[[Sunday Tribune]] |date=29 March 2009 |accessdate=29 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331022003/http://www.tribune.ie/article/2009/mar/29/a-stunt-a-story-a-nut-and-a-hammer/ |archivedate=31 March 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the RHA painting, he is holding a pair of blue and white underpants in his left hand.&lt;ref name=exposed_to_ridicule/&gt; In the other, he is clutching a [[toilet paper|toilet roll]].&lt;ref name=exposed_to_ridicule/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/7960997.stm|title=Naked taoiseach paintings removed|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=24 March 2009|accessdate=27 March 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302230406/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/7960997.stm|archivedate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=radio_station_inquiry/&gt;

==Media reports==
''Sunday Tribune'' reporter Ken Foxe was contacted by a source at the National Gallery on 9 March and was the first to break the story of Cowen's portraits. Subsequently, "Topsy Campbell" (a pseudonym for Casby) sent [[camera phone]] photographs of the paintings on display.&lt;ref name=stunt_story_nut_hammer/&gt; The incidents were first reported in the ''Tribune'' of 22 March.&lt;ref name=stunt_story_nut_hammer/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ken|last=Foxe|url=http://www.tribune.ie/news/home-news/article/2009/mar/22/cowen-hung-out-to-dry-in-national-gallery-hijack/#image_1|title=Cowen hung out to dry in National Gallery hijack|newspaper=[[Sunday Tribune]]|date=22 March 2009|accessdate=1 April 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327191317/http://www.tribune.ie/news/home-news/article/2009/mar/22/cowen-hung-out-to-dry-in-national-gallery-hijack/#image_1|archivedate=27 March 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===RTÉ===
On 23 March, [[state broadcaster]] [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] ran a report on the hangings at the end of the ''[[RTÉ News: Nine O'Clock|Nine O'Clock News]]''. The report by Tadhg Enright displayed the paintings, obtained an appraisal (of zero) from an art expert, and mentioned that Cowen was "not thought to have posed for the anonymous artist".&lt;ref name=before_complaint&gt;{{cite news|first=Ronan|last=McGreevy|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/0326/1224243451815.html|title=Cowen not consulted before complaint to RTÉ|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|date=26 March 2009|accessdate=1 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report was not used on subsequent newscasts. On 24 March, the Nine O'Clock News included an apology "for any personal offence caused to Mr Cowen or his family or for any disrespect shown to the office of Taoiseach by [the prior] broadcast."&lt;ref name=could_be_charged/&gt;&lt;ref name=radio_station_inquiry&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2009/0325/breaking38.htm|title=Gardaí visit radio station in Cowen painting inquiry|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|date=25 March 2009|accessdate=28 March 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302230609/http://www.irishtimes.com/news/garda%C3%AD-visit-radio-station-in-cowen-painting-inquiry-1.838054|archivedate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original item was removed from the online archives at [[RTÉ.ie]], and the apology added.&lt;ref name=radio_station_inquiry/&gt;

===Today FM===
On 24 March, ''[[The Ray D'Arcy Show]]'' on commercial radio station [[Today FM]], covered the story. Producer [[Will Hanafin]] revealed that a friend of the artist had e-mailed photographs of a similarly styled painting to him in January, a caricature of the Taoiseach urinating in a full frontal nude pose. This painting has not been displayed publicly.&lt;ref name=producer_reaction/&gt; A Garda detective visited the station requesting the emails.&lt;ref name=could_be_charged/&gt; The Garda was said to have been "sheepish and apologetic" about the visit but indicated that he had received an order from "on high" to initiate an investigation.&lt;ref name=producer_reaction/&gt; Hanafin refused to comply with the Garda request and, being told that a [[search warrant]] would be sought,&lt;ref name=could_be_charged/&gt;&lt;ref name=radio_station_inquiry/&gt; labelled the entire affair as "crazy".&lt;ref name=producer_reaction&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.examiner.ie/ireland/idqlqleysn/|title=Today FM producer brands reaction 'crazy'|newspaper=[[Irish Examiner]]|date=26 March 2009|accessdate=28 March 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302224032/http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/idqlqleysn/|archivedate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abroad===
The incident was covered by foreign newspapers, including ''[[The Times]]'' of London.&lt;ref name=exposed_to_ridicule&gt;{{cite news|first=David|last=Sharrock|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article5971027.ece|title=Brian Cowen is exposed to ridicule by art gallery guerrilla|newspaper=[[The Times]]|location=London|date=25 March 2009|accessdate=27 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also covered in [[Canada]].&lt;ref name=cbc/&gt;

===Online===
Blogs and [[social network service]]s such as Twitter were reported to be popular outlets for members of the general public to express their dissatisfaction at the attempted censorship and apology of RTÉ.&lt;ref name=radio_station_inquiry/&gt; A YouTube video of the original RTÉ news report had received more than three thousand views within twenty-four hours.&lt;ref name=radio_station_inquiry/&gt; The affair was nicknamed "Picturegate"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconrepublic.com/news/article/12591/digital-life/picturegate-has-web-in-uproar|title=Irish internet in uproar over Picturegate censorship|work=Silicon Republic|date=26 March 2009|accessdate=26 March 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302230815/http://www.siliconrepublic.com/news/article/12591/digital-life/picturegate-has-web-in-uproar|archivedate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Cowengate"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cearta.ie/2009/03/cowengate-and-freedom-of-expression/|title=Cowengate and Freedom of Expression|work=cearta.ie|date=26 March 2009|accessdate=26 March 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302230929/http://www.cearta.ie/2009/03/cowengate-and-freedom-of-expression/|archivedate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in online discussions.

==Garda investigation==
The Garda investigation was said to have taken six hours. The possible crimes were offending [[decency]], [[Hate speech#Ireland|incitement to hatred]], and [[criminal damage]] for nailing the painting to the wall&lt;ref name=could_be_charged/&gt;&lt;ref name=radio_station_inquiry/&gt; (though it has also been reported that paintings were hung without the use of nails)&lt;ref name=cbc&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/artdesign/story/2009/03/27/cowen-nudes.html?ref=rss|title=Artist behind naughty nudes of Irish PM emerges|work=CBC News|date=27 March 2009|accessdate=27 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigators telephoned Casby and he entered Pearse Street Garda Station where he was interviewed for two hours, admitted to having hung the two paintings and was subsequently released.&lt;ref name=teacher_questioned&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0325/cowenb.html|title=Teacher questioned over Cowen paintings|publisher=[[RTÉ News]]|date=25 March 2009|accessdate=27 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He gave gardaí five more portraits of other politicians, including [[Michael McDowell (politician)|Michael McDowell]].&lt;ref name=could_be_charged/&gt;&lt;ref name=stunt_story_nut_hammer/&gt; A file was prepared for the [[Director of public prosecutions#Ireland|director of public prosecutions]], but it is expected that no charges will be brought.&lt;ref name=could_be_charged/&gt; Casby expressed his desire to "draw an end" to the matter by auctioning the paintings for charity.&lt;ref name=could_be_charged/&gt;

==Political reaction==
The incidents attracted comment from politicians.

The RTÉ News report was criticised as being in bad taste by [[Fianna Fáil]] [[Seanad Éireann|Senators]] [[Maria Corrigan]] and [[Mary O'Rourke]] and [[Teachta Dála|TDs]] [[M. J. Nolan]] and [[Michael Kennedy (Dublin politician)|Michael Kennedy]]. [[Fine Gael]] TD [[Michael W. D'Arcy]] called it the "most distasteful report I have seen on RTÉ in years".&lt;ref name=before_complaint/&gt; Kennedy urged consideration for the feelings of Cowen's wife and children, and called on [[Director-General of RTÉ]] [[Cathal Goan]] to resign, but did not advocate charging the artist.&lt;ref name=producer_reaction/&gt;

Some suggested the government had put pressure on RTÉ to withdraw the report and apologise, or on Today FM to co-operate with the Garda. The station received several complaints that the report was in bad taste, including one from the government press secretary, Eoghan Ó Neachtain, who claimed he was acting on his own initiative.&lt;ref name=radio_station_inquiry/&gt; [[Fine Gael]]'s [[Enda Kenny]]&lt;ref name="Ceann Comhairle exasperated as Kenny fails to see the bigger picture"&gt;{{cite news|first=Michael|last=O'Regan|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/0327/1224243552769.html|title=Ceann Comhairle exasperated as Kenny fails to see the bigger picture|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|date=27 March 2009|accessdate=27 March 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302231103/http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/oireachtas/ceann-comhairle-exasperated-as-kenny-fails-to-see-the-bigger-picture-1.731374|archivedate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Charles Flanagan]] called it a restriction on [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]].&lt;ref name=teacher_questioned/&gt;&lt;ref name=opposition_pressure&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0326/cowenb.html|title=Opposition slams Govt over portrait pressure|publisher=[[RTÉ News]]|date=26 March 2009|accessdate=28 March 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302231227/http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0326/115596-cowenb/|archivedate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Liz McManus]] of the [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]] criticised RTÉ for "bow[ing] to political pressure".&lt;ref name=opposition_pressure/&gt; RTÉ claimed the decision to withdraw the report was taken by RTÉ executives, and that Ó Neachtain's complaint was received after the late-night ''[[RTÉ News on Two|News on Two]]'' had already been broadcast without the report.&lt;ref name=radio_station_inquiry/&gt;

Some criticised the Garda investigation as a waste of resources. Fine Gael's [[Frances Fitzgerald (Irish politician)|Frances FitzGerald]] said it was "over the top"; [[Rónán Mullen]] defended it as appropriate.&lt;ref name=opposition_pressure/&gt; Labour's [[Joan Burton]] said "While I sympathise with the Taoiseach and his family, the public has noticed that it took gardaí six months to [[Anglo Irish Bank hidden loans controversy|go into the Anglo Irish Bank]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tribune.ie/news/home-news/article/2009/mar/29/it-took-gardai-six-months-to-go-into-anglo-irish-r/ |title='It took Gardaí six months to go into Anglo Irish': reaction to cowengate |date=29 March 2009 |newspaper=[[Sunday Tribune]] |accessdate=1 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402180945/http://www.tribune.ie/news/home-news/article/2009/mar/29/it-took-gardai-six-months-to-go-into-anglo-irish-r/ |archivedate= 2 April 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''British National Opera Company''' presented opera in English in London and on tour in the British provinces between 1922 and 1929. It was founded in December 1921 by singers and instrumentalists from [[Thomas Beecham|Sir Thomas Beecham]]'s [[Beecham opera company]] (1915–1920), which was disbanded when financial problems over buying [[Thomas_Beecham#The_Bedford_Estate|The Bedford Estate]] forced Beecham to withdraw from the music scene for a short period. The new venture was financed by the issue of 40,000 preference shares at £1 each.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 13 July 1921, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Among the musicians who met at the inaugural meeting of the new enterprise at the [[Queen's Hall]] were [[Alexander Mackenzie (composer)|Sir Alexander Mackenzie]], [[Charles Villiers Stanford|Sir Charles Stanford]], [[Harry Plunket Greene]], [[Aylmer Buesst]] and [[William Henry Hadow|Sir Henry Hadow]]. The new company bought the entire assets of the Beecham company, comprising the scenery, costumes, scores, instruments and performing rights for 48 operas.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 27 September 1921, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Nellie Melba 1.jpg|right|150px|thumbnail|[[Nellie Melba]], who appeared with the company at Covent Garden]]The company's first performance was ''[[Aida]]'' at [[Bradford]] in February 1922, and received excellent notices.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 7 February 1922, p. 8 and ''The Manchester Guardian'', 10 February 1922, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; For much of its existence the company toured in the provinces, but also had short seasons at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] (1922–1924) and then at [[Her Majesty's Theatre|His Majesty's Theatre]].&lt;ref name=ency&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O76-BritishNationalOperaCmpny.html BNOC on encyclopedia.com]&lt;/ref&gt; For the 1923 Covent Garden season [[Nellie Melba|Dame Nellie Melba]] emerged from retirement to sing with the company. She gave her services free of charge, to support the company. She did not, however, feel equal to relearning her old roles in English translation, and she sang in Italian while the rest of the company sang in the vernacular.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 4 January 1923, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

The British National Opera Company was a pioneer of broadcast opera, with excerpts from ''[[The Magic Flute]]'' broadcast live from the [[Royal Opera House]] by the [[BBC|British Broadcasting Company]] in January 1923, less than a year after the foundation of both the BBC and the opera company.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[The Times]]'', 9 January 1923, p. 8 and ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'', 10 January 1923, p. 10. However, [[Harold Rosenthal]] in ''The New Grove Dictionary of Opera'' states that the BNOC gave "the first broadcast in Europe of a complete opera" from "the company's matinée performance of [[Hänsel und Gretel (opera)| Hänsel und Gretel]] at Covent Garden on 6 January 1923", but this conflicts not only with the ''Times'' and ''Guardian'' reports, but with the BBC's schedules: daily broadcasts did not begin until 5.00 p.m, too late for a relay of a matinée.&lt;/ref&gt;

The company's first artistic director was [[Percy Pitt]], who had been music director with the Grand Opera Syndicate and who later worked as Director of Music for the [[BBC]]. His successor in 1924 was [[baritone]] [[Frederic Austin]], who in 1920 arranged the music for a revival of ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'' at the [[Lyric Theatre (Hammersmith)]].&lt;ref name=divine&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.divine-art.com/AS/BNOC.htm# |title=BNOC on Divineart.com |access-date=3 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091118081729/http://www.divine-art.com/AS/BNOC.htm# |archive-date=18 November 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Company had a wide repertory, which included works by [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]], [[Italian opera]] and several English works, including [[Ralph Vaughan Williams|Vaughan Williams]]'s ''[[Hugh the Drover]]'' and [[Gustav Holst]]'s ''[[The Perfect Fool]]'' and ''[[At the Boar's Head]]''.&lt;ref name=ency/&gt; The ''New Grove Dictionary of Opera'' singled out the company's staging of the ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring]]'', ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'', ''[[Parsifal]]'' and "a notable production in English of ''[[Pelléas and Mélisande]]'' with [[Maggie Teyte]]."&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

British National Opera Company employed most of the leading British and British-based singers and conductors of that time, including conductors [[John Barbirolli]], [[Adrian Boult]], Aylmer Buesst, [[Hamilton Harty]], [[Gervase Hughes]] and [[Malcolm Sargent]], and singers [[Agnes Nicholls]], [[Florence Austral]], [[Joseph Hislop]], [[Edward Johnson (tenor)|Edward Johnson]], [[Dinh Gilly]], [[Harold Williams (baritone)|Harold Williams]], [[Norman Allin]], [[Robert Radford]], [[Dora Labbette]], [[Walter Widdop]], [[Frank Mullings]], [[Herbert Heyner]] and [[Heddle Nash]], among others.&lt;ref name=divine/&gt; In 1924, Beecham joined the company at His Majesty's for ''[[Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 19 July 1924, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was short of money throughout its existence, and the resumption of international opera seasons at Covent Garden deprived the BNOC of its lucrative London seasons which had in the first years subsidised its provincial tours.&lt;ref&gt;''The Manchester Guardian'', 2 July 1929, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; The company ceased to exist in 1929 following a tax demand for £17,000 which forced it to go into voluntary liquidation.&lt;ref name=divine/&gt; Its last performances were ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'' and ''[[Pagliacci]]'' at the [[Golders Green Hippodrome]] in London, on 16 April 1929, in a season in which the conductors included Beecham, Barbirolli and [[Eugène Goossens, fils|Eugène Goossens]]. The company effectively re-formed as the [[Covent Garden English Opera Company]] in September 1929, with Barbirolli as its musical director, and continued under that name until 1938.&lt;ref name=grove&gt;Rosenthal, Harold, [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/04014?q=%22first+broadcast%22+of+an+opera&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=14&amp;_start=1#firsthit "British National Opera Company"], ''New Grove Dictionary of Opera''.

'''Building information modeling ''' ('''BIM''') is a process involving the generation and management of digital representations of physical and functional characteristics of places. '''Building information models''' ('''BIMs''') are files (often but not always in proprietary formats and containing proprietary data) which can be extracted, exchanged or networked to support decision-making regarding a building or other built asset. Current BIM software is used by individuals, businesses and government agencies who plan, design, construct, operate and maintain diverse [[hard infrastructure|physical infrastructure]]s, such as water, refuse, electricity, gas, communication utilities, roads, railways, bridges, ports and tunnels.

== BIM origins and elements==
The concept of BIM has existed since the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Charles |last1=Eastman |first2=David |last2=Fisher |first3=Gilles |last3=Lafue |first4=Joseph |last4=Lividini |first5=Douglas |last5=Stoker |first6=Christos |last6=Yessios |date=September 1974 |title=An Outline of the Building Description System |publisher=Institute of Physical Planning, Carnegie-Mellon University |url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED113833}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Eastman1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eastman|first1=Chuck|last2=Tiecholz|first2=Paul|last3=Sacks|first3=Rafael|last4=Liston|first4=Kathleen|title=BIM Handbook: a Guide to Building Information Modeling for owners, managers, designers, engineers, and contractors|date=2008|publisher=John Wiley|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|isbn=9780470185285|edition=1st|pages=xi-xii}}&lt;!--|accessdate=15 June 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Eastman2&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eastman|first1=Chuck|last2=Tiecholz|first2=Paul|last3=Sacks|first3=Rafael|last4=Liston|first4=Kathleen|year = 2011 | title =  BIM Handbook: A Guide to Building Information Modeling for Owners, Managers, Designers, Engineers and Contractors | location = Hoboken, New Jersey|publisher=John Wiley|edition=2nd |pages=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term 'building model' (in the sense of BIM as used today) was first used in papers in the mid-1980s: in a 1985 paper by Simon Ruffle eventually published in 1986,&lt;ref&gt;Ruffle S. (1986) "Architectural design exposed: from computer-aided-drawing to computer-aided-design" Environments and Planning B: Planning and Design 1986 March 7 pp 385-389. [http://epb.sagepub.com/content/13/4/385.abstract Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; and later in a 1986 paper by Robert Aish&lt;ref&gt;Aish, R. (1986) "Building Modelling: The Key to Integrated Construction CAD" CIB 5th International Symposium on the Use of Computers for Environmental Engineering related to Building, 7–9 July.&lt;/ref&gt; - then at [[GMW Architects|GMW Computers Ltd]], developer of [[RUCAPS]] software - referring to the software's use at London's Heathrow Airport.&lt;ref&gt;cited by Laiserin, Jerry (2008), Foreword to Eastman, C., ''et al'' (2008), ''op cit'', p.xii&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'Building Information Model' first appeared in a 1992 paper by G.A. van Nederveen and F. P. Tolman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0926-5805(92)90014-B |title=Modelling multiple views on buildings |year=1992 |last1=Van Nederveen |first1=G.A. |last2=Tolman |first2=F.P. |journal=Automation in Construction |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=215–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the terms 'Building Information Model' and 'Building Information Modeling' (including the acronym "BIM") did not become popularly used until some 10 years later. In 2002, [[Autodesk]] released a [[white paper]] entitled "Building Information Modeling,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laiserin.com/features/bim/autodesk_bim.pdf|title=Autodesk (2002). Building Information Modeling. San Rafael, CA, Autodesk, Inc.|author=|date=|website=laiserin.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other software vendors also started to assert their involvement in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Laiserin, J. (2002) "[http://www.laiserin.com/features/issue15/feature01.php Comparing Pommes and Naranjas]", ''The Laiserin Letter'', December 16, 2002.{{unreliable source?|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By hosting contributions from Autodesk, [[Bentley Systems]] and [[Graphisoft]], plus other industry observers, in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;Laiserin, J. (2003) "[http://laiserin.com/features/bim/index.php The BIM Page]", ''The Laiserin Letter''.{{unreliable source?|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jerry Laiserin helped popularize and standardize the term as a common name for the digital representation of the building process.&lt;ref&gt;Laiserin, in his foreword to Eastman, et al (2008, ''op cit'') disclaimed he had coined the term, adding "it is my opinion that the historical record ... shows that Building Information Modeling was not an innovation attributable solely to any individual or entity." (p.xiii)&lt;/ref&gt;  Facilitating exchange and interoperability of information in digital format had previously been offered under differing terminology by Graphisoft as "Virtual Building", Bentley Systems as "Integrated Project Models", and by Autodesk or Vectorworks as "Building Information Modeling".

The pioneering role of applications such as RUCAPS, [[Sonata (building design software)|Sonata]] and [[Reflex (building design software)|Reflex]] has been recognized by Laiserin&lt;ref&gt;Laiserin, J. (2003) "[http://laiserin.com/features/issue17/feature02.php LaiserinLetterLetters]" (see Laiserin's comment to letter from John Mullan), ''The Laiserin Letter'', January 06 2003.{{unreliable source?|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the UK's [[Royal Academy of Engineering]].&lt;ref name="RAEng-Ingram"&gt;{{cite web|title=Prince Philip Medal for engineer behind revolution in Building Information Modelling (22 June 2016)|url=http://www.raeng.org.uk/news/news-releases/2016/june/prince-philip-medal-for-engineer-behind-revolution|website=Royal Academy of Engineering|publisher=RAEng|accessdate=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Graphisoft had been developing such solutions for longer than its competitors, Laiserin regarded its [[ArchiCAD]] application as then "one of the most mature BIM solutions on the market."&lt;ref&gt;Laiserin, J. (2003) "[http://www.laiserin.com/features/issue19/feature01.php Graphisoft on BIM]", ''The Laiserin Letter'', January 20, 2003.{{unreliable source?|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following its launch in 1987, ArchiCAD became regarded by some as the first implementation of [[Building Information Modeling|BIM]],&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;Lincoln H. Forbes, Syed M. Ahmed,  (2010) ''Modern Construction: Lean Project Delivery and Integrated Practices'', CRC Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cinti Luciani, S. Garagnani, R. Mingucci (2012) "BIM tools and design intent. Limitations and opportunities", in K. Kensek, J. Peng, ''Practical BIM 2012 - Management, Implementation, Coordination and Evaluation'', Los Angeles&lt;/ref&gt; as it was the first CAD product on a personal computer able to create both 2D and 3D geometry, as well as the first commercial BIM product for personal computers.&lt;ref name=Forbes /&gt;&lt;ref name=Quirk&gt;{{cite web|last1=Quirk|first1=Vanessa|title=A Brief History of BIM|url=http://www.archdaily.com/302490/a-brief-history-of-bim|website=Arch Daily|date=7 December 2012|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M.

==Definition==
The US National Building Information Model Standard Project Committee has the following definition:

:''Building Information Modeling (BIM) is a digital representation of physical and functional characteristics of a facility. A BIM is a shared knowledge resource for information about a facility forming a reliable basis for decisions during its life-cycle; defined as existing from earliest conception to demolition.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalbimstandard.org/faq.php#faq1 |title=Frequently Asked Questions About the National BIM Standard-United States - National BIM Standard - United States |publisher=Nationalbimstandard.org |accessdate=17 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016190503/http://www.nationalbimstandard.org/faq.php#faq1 |archivedate=16 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional building design was largely reliant upon two-dimensional [[technical drawings]] (plans, elevations, sections, etc.). Building information modeling extends this beyond [[3D modeling|3D]], augmenting the three primary spatial dimensions (width, height and depth) with time as the fourth dimension ([[4D BIM|4D]])&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-01&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.structuremag.org/article.aspx?articleID=1234|title=4D BIM or Simulation-Based Modeling|publisher=structuremag.org|date=|accessdate=29 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120528051608/http://structuremag.org/article.aspx?articleID=1234|archivedate=28 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cost as the fifth ([[5D BIM|5D]]).&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-02&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cadsoft-consult.com/blogs/architecture/2009/09/ashrae-introduction-to-bim-4d-and-5d/|title= ASHRAE Introduction to BIM, 4D and 5D |publisher=cadsoft-consult.com |date= |accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
More recently there are also references to a sixth dimension (6D) representing building environmental and sustainability aspects, and a seventh dimension (7D) for through-life facility management, although there are conflicting definitions ([[6D BIM]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Theory of Evolution BIM 3D-7D|url=https://bimestimate.eu/en/the-theory-of-evolution-bim-3d-7d/|accessdate=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=BIM 3D, 4D, 5D, 6D, 7D|url=http://www.bimpanzee.com/bim-3d-4d--5d--6d---7d.html|accessdate=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
BIM therefore covers more than just geometry. It also covers spatial relationships, light analysis, geographic information, and quantities and properties of building components (for example, manufacturers' details).

BIM involves representing a design as combinations of "objects" – vague and undefined, generic or product-specific, solid shapes or void-space oriented (like the shape of a room), that carry their geometry, relations and attributes. BIM design tools allow extraction of different views from a building model for drawing production and other uses. These different views are automatically consistent, being based on a single definition of each object instance.&lt;ref name = "Eastman, C"&gt;{{cite web |last=Eastman |first=Chuck |date=August 2009 |title=What is BIM? |url=http://bim.arch.gatech.edu/?id=402}}&lt;/ref&gt; BIM software also defines objects parametrically; that is, the objects are defined as parameters and relations to other objects, so that if a related object is amended, dependent ones will automatically also change.&lt;ref name = "Eastman, C"/&gt; Each model element can carry attributes for selecting and ordering them automatically, providing cost estimates as well as material tracking and ordering.&lt;ref name = "Eastman, C"/&gt;

For the professionals involved in a project, BIM enables a virtual information model to be handed from the design team ([[architect]]s, [[landscape architect]]s, [[surveying|surveyor]]s, [[civil engineering|civil]], [[structural engineering|structural]] and [[building services]] [[engineer]]s, etc.) to the main contractor and subcontractors and then on to the owner/operator; each professional adds discipline-specific data to the single shared model. This reduces information losses that traditionally occurred when a new team takes 'ownership' of the project, and provides more extensive information to owners of complex structures.

==BIM throughout the project life-cycle==
Use of BIM goes beyond the planning and design phase of the project, extending throughout the building life cycle, supporting processes including [[cost management]], [[construction management]], [[project management]] and [[facilities management|facility operation]].

===Management of building information models===
Building information models span the whole concept-to-occupation time-span. To ensure efficient management of information processes throughout this span, a BIM manager (also sometimes defined as a [[Virtual design and construction|virtual design-to-construction]], VDC, project manager – VDCPM) might be appointed. The BIM manager is retained by a design build team on the client's behalf from the pre-design phase onwards to develop and to track the object-oriented BIM against predicted and measured performance objectives, supporting multi-disciplinary building information models that drive analysis, schedules, take-off and logistics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/channelView.do?pageTypeId=17109&amp;channelPage=/ep/channel/gsaOverview.jsp&amp;channelId=-24291]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091112145341/http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/channelView.do?pageTypeId=17109&amp;channelPage=%2Fep%2Fchannel%2FgsaOverview.jsp&amp;channelId=-24291|date=November 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senaatti.fi/document.asp?siteID=2&amp;docID=588|title=Senate Properties modeling guidelines|publisher=Gsa.gov|accessdate=17 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226194436/http://www.senaatti.fi/document.asp?siteID=2&amp;docID=588|archivedate=26 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Companies are also now considering developing BIMs in various levels of detail, since depending on the application of BIM, more or less detail is needed, and there is varying modeling effort associated with generating building information models at different levels of detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.autcon.2010.11.027 |title=Analysis of modeling effort and impact of different levels of detail in building information models |year=2011 |last1=Leite |first1=Fernanda |last2=Akcamete |first2=Asli |last3=Akinci |first3=Burcu |last4=Atasoy |first4=Guzide |last5=Kiziltas |first5=Semiha |journal=Automation in Construction |volume=20 |issue=5 |pages=601–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===BIM in construction management===
Participants in the building process are constantly challenged to deliver successful projects despite tight budgets, limited manpower, accelerated schedules, and limited or conflicting information. The significant disciplines such as [[Architectural engineering|architectural]], [[Structural engineering|structural]] and [[mechanical, electrical, and plumbing|MEP]] designs should be well coordinated, as two things can’t take place at the same place and time. Building Information Modeling aids in collision detection at the initial stage, identifying the exact location of discrepancies.  
   
The BIM concept envisages virtual construction of a facility prior to its actual physical construction, in order to reduce uncertainty, improve safety, work out problems, and simulate and analyze potential impacts.&lt;ref name = "Smith 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Deke |last1=Smith |year=2007 |title=An Introduction to Building Information Modeling (BIM) |journal=Journal of Building Information Modeling |url=http://www.wbdg.org/pdfs/jbim_fall07.pdf |pages=12–4}}{{Unreliable source?|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sub-contractors from every trade can input critical information into the model before beginning construction, with opportunities to pre-fabricate or pre-assemble some systems off-site. Waste can be minimised on-site and products delivered on a just-in-time basis rather than being stock-piled on-site.&lt;ref name = "Smith 2007"/&gt;

Quantities and shared properties of materials can be extracted easily. Scopes of work can be isolated and defined. Systems, assemblies and sequences can be shown in a relative scale with the entire facility or group of facilities. BIM also prevents errors by enabling conflict or 'clash detection' whereby the computer model visually highlights to the team where parts of the building (e.g.:structural frame and building services pipes or ducts) may wrongly intersect.

===BIM in facility operation===
BIM can bridge the information loss associated with handling a project from design team, to construction team and to building owner/operator, by allowing each group to add to and reference back to all information they acquire during their period of contribution to the BIM model. This can yield benefits to the facility owner or operator.

For example, a building owner may find evidence of a leak in his building.  Rather than exploring the physical building, he may turn to the model and see that  a water [[valve]] is located in the suspect location.  He could also have in the model the specific valve size, manufacturer, part number, and any other information ever researched in the past, pending adequate computing power. Such problems were initially addressed by Leite and Akinci when developing a vulnerability representation of facility contents and threats for supporting the identification of vulnerabilities in building emergencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000171 |title=Formalized Representation for Supporting Automated Identification of Critical Assets in Facilities during Emergencies Triggered by Failures in Building Systems |year=2012 |last1=Leite |first1=Fernanda |last2=Akinci |first2=Burcu |journal=Journal of Computing in Civil Engineering |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dynamic information about the building, such as sensor measurements and control signals from the building systems, can also be incorporated within BIM software to support analysis of building operation and maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1061/41052(346)10 |chapter=Requirements and Evaluation of Standards for Integration of Sensor Data with Building Information Models |title=Computing in Civil Engineering |year=2009 |last1=Liu |first1=Xuesong |last2=Akinci |first2=Burcu |isbn=978-0-7844-1052-3 |pages=95–104 |editor1-first=Carlos H. |editor1-last=Caldas |editor2-first=William J. |editor2-last=O'Brien}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been attempts at creating information models for older, pre-existing facilities. Approaches include referencing key metrics such as the [[Facility Condition Index]] (FCI), or using [[3D scanner|3D laser-scanning]] surveys and [[photogrammetry]] techniques (both separately or in combination) to capture accurate measurements of the asset that can be used as the basis for a model. Trying to model a building constructed in, say 1927, requires numerous assumptions about design standards, building codes, construction methods, materials, etc., and is therefore more complex than building a model during design.

One of the challenges to the proper maintenance and management of existing facilities is understanding how BIM can be utilized to support a holistic understanding and implementation of [[Facility management|building management]] practices and “[[Total cost of ownership|cost of ownership]]” principles that support the full life cycle of a building.&amp;nbsp; An [[American National Standards Institute|American National Standard]] entitled ''APPA 1000 – Total Cost of Ownership for Facilities Asset Management'' incorporates BIM to factor in a variety of critical requirements and costs over the [[Life-cycle assessment|life-cycle]] of the building, including but not limited to: replacement of energy, utility, and safety systems; continual maintenance of the building exterior and interior and replacement of materials; updates to design and functionality; and recapitalization costs.

=== BIM in land administration and cadastre ===
BIM can potentially offer some benefit for managing stratified [[cadastre|cadastral]] spaces in urban built environments. The first benefit would be enhancing visual communication of interweaved, stacked and complex cadastral spaces for non-specialists. The rich amount of spatial and semantic information about physical structures inside models can aid comprehension of cadastral boundaries, providing an unambiguous delineation of ownership, rights, responsibilities and restrictions. Additionally, using BIM to manage cadastral information could advance current land administration systems from a 2D-based and analogue data environment into a 3D digital, intelligent, interactive and dynamic one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Atazadeh|first=Behnam|last2=Kalantari|first2=Mohsen|last3=Rajabifard|first3=Abbas|last4=Ho|first4=Serene|last5=Ngo|first5=Tuan|date=2016-03-01|title=Building Information Modelling for High-rise Land Administration|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tgis.12199/abstract|journal=Transactions in GIS|language=en|pages=n/a–n/a|doi=10.1111/tgis.12199|issn=1467-9671}}&lt;/ref&gt; BIM could also unlock value in the cadastral information by forming a bridge between that information and the interactive lifecycle and management of buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rics.org/Global/Land_Journal_March-April_2016.pdf#page24|title=Filling the space|author1=Behnam Atazadeh |author2=Mohsen Kalantari |author3=Abbas Rajabifard |author4=Tom Champion |date=23 February 2016|website=RICS Land Journal|publisher=Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==BIM software==
The first software tools developed for modelling buildings emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and included workstation products such as Chuck Eastman's Building Description System and GLIDE, [[RUCAPS]], [[Sonata (building design software)|Sonata]], Reflex and [[Gable CAD|Gable 4D Series]]. The early applications, and the hardware needed to run them, were expensive, which limited widespread adoption. ArchiCAD's Radar CH, released in 1984 was the first modelling software made available on a personal computer.&lt;ref name=Quirk /&gt;

Due to the complexity of gathering all the relevant information when working with BIM on a building project some companies have developed software designed specifically to work in a BIM framework. These packages differ from architectural drafting tools such as [[AutoCAD]] by allowing the addition of further information (time, cost, manufacturers' details, sustainability and maintenance information, etc.) to the building model.

There is a BIM module in open source CAD software [[FreeCAD]].

===Non-proprietary or openBIM standards===
BIM is often associated with [[Industry Foundation Classes]] (IFCs) and [[aecXML]] – data structures for representing information. IFCs have been developed by [[buildingSMART]] (the former International Alliance for Interoperability), as a neutral, non-proprietary or open standard for sharing BIM data among different software applications (some proprietary data structures have been developed by CAD vendors incorporating BIM into their software).

Poor software interoperability has long been regarded as an obstacle to industry efficiency in general and to BIM adoption in particular. In August 2004 a US National Institute of Standards and Technology ([[NIST]]) report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gallaher |first1=Michael P. |last2=O'Connor |first2=Alan C. |last3=Dettbarn |first3=John L. |last4=Gilday |first4=Linda T. |date=August 2004 |title=Cost Analysis of Inadequate Interoperability in the U.S. Capital Facilities Industry |doi=10.6028/NIST.GCR.04-867 |publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology |page=iv}}&lt;/ref&gt; conservatively estimated that $15.8 billion was lost annually by the U.S. capital facilities industry due to inadequate interoperability arising from "the highly fragmented nature of the industry, the industry’s continued paperbased business practices, a lack of standardization, and inconsistent technology adoption among stakeholders".

An early example of a nationally approved BIM standard is the AISC ([[American Institute of Steel Construction]])-approved CIS/2 standard, a non-proprietary standard with its roots in the UK.

====Malaysia====
BIM implementation is targeted towards BIM Stage 2 by the year 2020 led by the Construction Industry Development Board (CIDB Malaysia). Under the Construction Industry Master Plan 2016-2020,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CITP|url = http://www.citp.my/|website = www.citp.my|access-date = 2016-02-12|last = CITP}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is hoped more emphasis on technology adoption across the project life-cycle will induce higher productivity.

====Singapore====
The Building and Construction Authority (BCA) has announced that BIM would be introduced for architectural submission (by 2013), structural and M&amp;E submissions (by 2014) and eventually for plan submissions of all projects with gross floor area of more than 5,000 square metres by 2015. The BCA Academy is training students in BIM.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bca.gov.sg/publications/BuildSmart/others/buildsmart_11issue9.pdf BuildSmart]'' (BCA magazine), December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

====South Korea====
Small BIM-related seminars and independent BIM effort existed in South Korea even in the 1990s. However, it was not until the late 2000s that the Korean industry paid attention to BIM. The first industry-level BIM conference was held in April, 2008, after which, BIM has been spread very rapidly. Since 2010, the Korean government has been gradually increasing the scope of BIM-mandated projects. McGraw Hill published a detailed report in 2012 on the status of BIM adoption and implementation in South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://analyticsstore.construction.com/index.php/2012-business-value-of-bim-in-korea-smartmarket-report-english.html|title=Lee, G., J.

====United Arab Emirates====
Dubai Municipality issued a circular (196) in 2014 mandating BIM use for buildings of a certain size, height or type. The one page circular initiated strong interest in BIM and the market responded in preparation for more guidelines and direction. In 2015 the Municipality issued another circular (207) titled 'Regarding the expansion of applying the (BIM) on buildings and facilities in the emirate of Dubai' which made BIM mandatory on more projects by reducing the minimum size and height requirement for projects requiring BIM. This second circular drove BIM adoption further with several projects and organizations adopting UK BIM standards as best practice. In 2016, the UAE's Quality and Conformity Commission set up a BIM steering group to investigate statewide adoption of BIM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constructionweekonline.com/article-36590-bim-summit-2015-calls-for-greater-co-operation/|title= BIM Summit 2015 calls for greater co-operation|publisher=ConstructionWeekOnline.com|accessdate= 6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Italy====
Through the new D.l. 50, in April 2016 Italy has included into its own legislation several European directives including 2014/24/EU on Public Procurement. The decree states among the main goals of public procurement the "rationalization of designing activities and of all connected verification processes, through the progressive adoption of digital methods and electronic instruments such as Building and Infrastructure Information Modelling".&lt;ref&gt;D.lgs. 50/2006, art. 38 com. 1 lett. h&lt;/ref&gt; A norm in 8 parts is also being written to support the transition: UNI 11337-1, UNI 11337-4 and UNI 11337-5 were published in January 2017, with five further chapters to follow within a year.

In early 2018 the Italian Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport issued a decree creating a governmental BIM Mandate compelling public client organisations to adopt a digital approach by 2025, with an incremental obligation which will start on 1 January 2019.&lt;ref name="Ciribini-21Mar2018"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ciribini|first1=Angelo|last2=De Giuda|first2=Giuseppe|last3=Valaguzza|first3=Sara|title=UK PROCUREMENT FRAMEWORK INFORMS ITALY’S MOVE TO MANDATE BIM|url=http://www.bimplus.co.uk/people/uk-procurement-framework-informs-italys-move-manda/|accessdate=22 March 2018|work=BIM Plus|date=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lithuania====
Lithuania is moving towards adoption of BIM infrastructure by founding a public body "Skaitmeninė statyba" (Digital Construction), which is managed by 13 associations. Also there is a BIM work group established by Lietuvos Architektų Sąjunga (a Lithuanian architects body). The initiative intends Lithuania to adopt BIM, Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) and National Construction Classification as standard. An international conference "Skaitmeninė statyba Lietuvoje" (Digital Construction in Lithuania) has been held annually since 2012.

====The Netherlands====
On 1 November 2011, the Rijksgebouwendienst, the agency within the [[Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment|Dutch Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment]] that manages government buildings, introduced the Rgd BIM Standard,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rgd.nl/onderwerpen/diensten/bouwwerk-informatie-modellen-bim/rgd-bim-norm/#c16783|title=Vastgoed van en voor het Rijk|publisher=Rgd.nl|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which it updated on 1 July 2012.

====Norway====
In Norway BIM has been used increasingly since 2008. Several large public clients require use of BIM in open formats (IFC) in most or all of their projects. The Government Building Authority bases its processes on BIM in open formats to increase process speed and quality, and all large and several small and medium-sized contractors use BIM. National BIM development is centred around the local organisation, buildingSMART Norway which represents 25% of the Norwegian construction industry.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Created in 2015 to promote the adoption of BIM in Portugal and its normalisation, the Technical Committee for BIM Standardisation, CT197-BIM, has created the first strategic document for construction 4.0 in Portugal, aiming to align the country's industry around a common vision, integrated and more ambitious than a simple technology change.&lt;ref name="BIMplus-4Dec2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Aguiar Costa|first1=Antonio|title=Construction 4.0 in Portugal|url=http://www.bimplus.co.uk/people/con2st6ruction-40-portu5gal/|accessdate=6 December 2016|work=Construction Manager: BIM+|date=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Russia====

The Russian government has approved a list of the regulations that provide the creation of a legal framework for the use of information modeling of buildings in construction.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

====Slovakia====
The BIM Association of Slovakia, "BIMaS", was established in January 2013 as the first Slovakian professional organisation focused on BIM. Although there are neither standards nor legislative requirements to deliver projects in BIM, many architects, structural engineers and contractors, plus a few investors are already applying BIM. A Slovakian implementation strategy created by BIMaS and supported by the Chamber of Civil Engineers and Chamber of Architects has yet to be approved by Slovakian authorities due to their low interest in such innovation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bimas.sk BIMaS.sk], BIMaS website. Accessed: 4 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spain====
A July 2015 meeting at Spain’s Ministry of Infrastructure [Ministerio de Fomento] launched the country’s national BIM strategy, making BIM a mandatory requirement on public sector projects with a possible starting date of 2018.&lt;ref name=BIMplusSpain&gt;{{cite news|last1=Knutt|first1=Elaine|title=Spain launches BIM strategy with pencilled-in 2018 mandate|url=http://www.bimplus.co.uk/news/spain-launches-bim-strategy-pencilled-2018-mandate/|accessdate=20 August 2015|work=Construction Manager: BIMplus|date=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a February 2015 BIM summit in Barcelona, professionals in Spain's [[Autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous community]] of [[Catalonia]] established a BIM commission (ITeC) to drive the adoption of BIM in the region.&lt;ref name="ITeC"&gt;{{cite web|title=La Comissió Construïm el Futur (transl: The Commission Building the Future)|url=https://itec.cat/serveis/bim/comissio-construim-el-futur/|website=ITeC|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Switzerland====
Since 2009 through the initiative of buildingSmart Switzerland, then 2013, BIM awareness among a broader community of engineers and architects was raised due to the open competition for [[Basel]]'s Felix Platter Hospital&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.felixplatterspital.ch/fileadmin/pdf/Neubau/Gesamtleistungswettbewerb_Felix_Platter_Spital_simap.pdf]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110135358/http://www.felixplatterspital.ch/fileadmin/pdf/Neubau/Gesamtleistungswettbewerb_Felix_Platter_Spital_simap.pdf|date=November 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; where a BIM coordinator was sought. BIM has also been a subject of events by the Swiss Society for Engineers and Architects, SIA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sia.ch/de/der-sia/berufsgruppen/technik/jahrestagung-2013|title=jahrestagung 2013 - sia - schweizerischer ingenieur- und architektenverein|work=sia - schweizerischer ingenieur- und architektenverein|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====

In May 2011 UK Government [[Chief Construction Adviser to UK Government|Chief Construction Adviser]] [[Paul Morrell]] called for BIM adoption on UK government construction projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenbs.com/roundtable/|title=BIM Roundtable Discussion|publisher=Thenbs.com|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morrell also told construction professionals to adopt BIM or be "Betamaxed out".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bdonline.co.uk/news/adopt-bim-or-be-betamaxed-out-says-morrell/5018263.article|title=Adopt bim or be 'Betamaxed out' says Morrell|work=Building Design|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2011 the UK government published its BIM strategy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ktn.innovateuk.org/web/modernbuiltktn/articles/-/blogs/new-construction-strategy?ns_33_redirect=%2Fweb%2Fmodernbuiltktn%2Farticles|title=Modern Built Environment - innovateuk|publisher=Ktn.innovateuk.org|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; announcing its intention to require collaborative 3D BIM (with all project and asset information, documentation and data being electronic) on its projects by 2016. Initially, compliance will require building data to be delivered in a vendor-neutral '[[COBie]]' format, thus overcoming the limited interoperability of BIM software suites available on the market. The UK Government [[BIM Task Group]] led the government's BIM programme and requirements,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bimtaskgroup.org/|title=BIM Task Group - A UK Government Initiative|publisher=Bimtaskgroup.org|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; including a free-to-use set of UK standards and tools that define 'level 2 BIM'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://toolkit.thenbs.com/articles/the-level-2-bim-package|title=The level-2 BIM package|publisher=BIM Task Group|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2016, the UK Government published a new central web portal as a point of reference for the industry for BIM Level 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bim-level2.org/ |title=BIM Level 2|publisher=BSI Group|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BIM Task Group continues to develop BIM adoption within the government departments.

Outside of government, industry adoption of BIM from 2016 has been led by the UK BIM Alliance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ukbimalliance.org/|title=UK BIM Alliance|first=WebCider Business|last=Solutions|date=|website=ukbimalliance.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; formed to champion and enable the implementation of BIM Level 2 by 2020, and to connect and represent organisations, groups and individuals working towards digital transformation of the UK's built environment industry. Established as an independent, not-for-profit, collaboratively-based organisation, the UK BIM Alliance's structure has been developed around an executive team&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ukbimalliance.org/about-us/executive-team/|title=UKBIMA Executive Team|first=WebCider Business|last=Solutions|date=|website=ukbimalliance.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and three core activity areas: engagement, programme and operations (internal support and secretariat functions).

[[National Building Specification]] (NBS), owned by the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (RIBA), publishes research into BIM adoption in the UK. There have now been six annual surveys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenbs.com/topics/BIM/articles/puttingTheIintoBIM.asp|title=Putting the 'I' into BIM|publisher=Thenbs.com|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenbs.com/topics/bim/articles/nbsNationalBimSurvey_2012.asp|title=NBS National BIM Report 2012|publisher=Thenbs.com|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenbs.com/topics/BIM/articles/nbsNationalBimSurvey_2013.asp|title=NBS National BIM Report 2013|publisher=Thenbs.com|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenbs.com/topics/bim/articles/nbs-national-bim-report-2014.asp|title=NBS National BIM Report 2014|publisher=Thenbs.com|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenbs.com/topics/BIM/articles/nbs-national-bim-report-2015.asp|title=NBS National BIM Report 2015|publisher=Thenbs.com|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NBS2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thenbs.com/knowledge/national-bim-report-2016|title=NBS National BIM Report 2016|publisher=Thenbs.com|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The April 2016 survey of 1,000 UK construction professionals revealed that BIM adoption had increased from 13% in 2010 to 54% in 2015.&lt;ref name="NBS2016" /&gt;

===North America===

====Canada====
Several organizations support BIM adoption and implementation in Canada: the Canada BIM Council (CANBIM, founded in 2008),&lt;ref name="Canada BIM Council"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canbim.com/ |title=Canada BIM Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Institute for BIM in Canada]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibc-bim.ca/ |title=Institute for BIM in Canada (IBC)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[buildingSMART Canada]] (the Canadian chapter of [[buildingSMART]] International).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buildingsmartcanada.ca/ |title=buildingSMART Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States of America====
The [[Associated General Contractors of America]] and US contracting firms have developed various working definitions of BIM that describe it generally as:

:''an object-oriented building development tool that utilizes 3-D modeling concepts, information technology and software interoperability to design, construct and operate a building project, as well as communicate its details.''{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Although the concept of BIM and relevant processes are being explored by contractors, architects and [[real estate developers|developers]] alike, the term itself has been questioned and debated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aecbytes.com/newsletter/2004/issue_5.html|title=AECbytes Archived Articles|publisher=Aecbytes.com|accessdate=17 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021134606/http://www.aecbytes.com/newsletter/2004/issue_5.html|archivedate=21 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with alternatives including [[Virtual Building Environment]] (VBE) and virtual design and construction (VDC) also considered. Unlike some countries such as the UK, the US has not adopted a set of national BIM guidelines, allowing different systems to remain in competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.architectmagazine.com/technology/setting-a-standard-in-building-information-modeling_o|title=Setting a Standard in Building Information Modeling (Architect Magazine)|last=Shapiro|first=Gideon Fink|date=May 2, 2014|website=www.architectmagazine.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BIM is seen to be closely related to [[Integrated Project Delivery]] (IPD) where the primary motive is to bring the teams together early on in the project.&lt;ref&gt;AIA, C.C., A working Definition: Integrated Project Delivery. 2007, McGraw Hill Construction{{page needed|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A full implementation of BIM also requires the project teams to collaborate from the inception stage and formulate model sharing and ownership contract documents.

The [[American Institute of Architects]] has defined BIM as "a model-based technology linked with a database of project information",{{ref|definition}} and this reflects the general reliance on database technology as the foundation. In the future, structured text documents such as [[specifications]] may be able to be searched and linked to regional, national, and international standards.

===Africa===

====Nigeria====
BIM has the potential to play a vital role in the Nigerian AEC sector. In addition to its potential clarity and transparency it may help promote standardization across the industry. For instance, Utiome&lt;ref&gt;Utiome, Erezi, Drogemuller, Robin, &amp; Docherty, Michael (2014). [http://eprints.qut.edu.au/76076/ "BIM-based lifecycle planning and specifications for sustainable cities of the future : a conceptual approach"]&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that, in conceptualizing a BIM-based knowledge transfer framework from industrialized economies to urban construction projects in developing nations, generic BIM objects can benefit from rich building information within specification parameters in product libraries, and used for efficient, streamlined design and construction. Similarly, an assessment of the current 'state of the art' by Kori&lt;ref&gt;Kori, S. (2013). Toward Adoption of Building Information Modelling in the Nigeria AEC industry. MSc, University of Salford, Manchester.&lt;/ref&gt; found that medium and large firms were leading the adoption of BIM in the industry. Smaller firms were less advanced with respect to process and policy adherence.
There is little or less adoption of BIM in the built environment due to resistive nature of construction industry to changes or new ways of doing things. Till now, Nigerian construction industry is still working with the 2D conventional CAD system in services and structural designs, although the production could be in 3D system. There is virtually 0% utilization of 4D and 5D systems.

====South Africa====
The South African BIM Institute, established in May 2015, aims to enable technical experts to discuss digital construction solutions that can be adopted by professionals working within the construction sector. Its initial task was to promote the SA BIM Protocol.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biminstitute.org.za/&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no mandated or national best practice BIM standards or protocols in South Africa. Organisations implement company-specific BIM standards and protocols at best (there are isolated examples of cross-industry alliances).{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

===Oceania===

====Australia====
In February 2016, Infrastructure Australia recommended: "Governments should make the use of Building Information Modelling (BIM) mandatory for the design of large-scale complex infrastructure projects. In support of a mandatory rollout, the Australian Government should commission the Australasian Procurement and Construction Council, working with industry, to develop appropriate guidance around the adoption and use of BIM; and common standards and protocols to be applied when using BIM.”&lt;ref name="BIMCrunchFeb2016"&gt;{{cite news|title=Infrastructure Australia recommend BIM mandate for large-scale projects|url=http://bimcrunch.com/2016/02/infrastructure-australia-recommend-bim-mandate-for-large-scale-projects/|accessdate=16 August 2016|work=BIM Crunch|date=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New Zealand====
In 2015, many projects in the rebuilding of [[Christchurch]] were being assembled in detail on a computer using BIM well before workers set foot on the site. The New Zealand government started a BIM acceleration committee, as part of a productivity partnership with the goal of 20 per cent more efficiency in the construction industry by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;''New Zealand Herald'', Tuesday 14 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anticipated future potential==
BIM is a relatively new technology in an industry typically slow to adopt change. Yet many early adopters are confident that BIM will grow to play an even more crucial role in building documentation.&lt;ref name=kensek2&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kensek|first1=Karen|last2=Noble|first2=Douglas|year = 2014 | title =  Building Information Modeling:  BIM in Current and Future Practice | location = Hoboken, New Jersey|publisher=John Wiley|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents claim that BIM offers:
#Improved visualization
#Improved productivity due to easy retrieval of information
#Increased coordination of construction documents
#Embedding and linking of vital information such as vendors for specific materials, location of details and quantities required for estimation and tendering
#Increased speed of delivery
#Reduced costs

BIM also contains most of the data needed for [[building performance]] analysis.&lt;ref name=Kensek1&gt;{{cite book|last=Kensek|first=Karen|year = 2014 | title = Building Information Modeling | location = Hoboken, New York|publisher=Routledge|edition=1st |pages=152–162}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building properties in BIM can be used to automatically create the input file for [[building performance simulation]] and save a significant amount of time and effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rahmani Asl|first=Mohammad|author2=Saied Zarrinmehr|author3=Wei Yan|title=Towards BIM-based Parametric Building Energy Performance Optimization|journal=ACADIA 2013|url=http://cumincad.scix.net/cgi-bin/works/Show?acadia13_101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, automation of this process reduce errors and mismatches in the building performance simulation process.

[[Green Building XML]] (gbXML) is an emerging schema, a subset of the Building Information Modeling efforts, focused on green building design and operation. gbXML is used as input in several energy simulation engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gbxml.org/|title=Welcome - Green Building XML Schema|publisher=Gbxml.org|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the development of modern computer technology, a large number of building performance simulation tools are available. When choosing which simulation tool to use, the user must consider the tool's accuracy and reliability, considering the building information they have at hand, which will serve as input for the tool. Yezioro, Dong and Leite&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.enbuild.2007.04.014 |title=An applied artificial intelligence approach towards assessing building performance simulation tools |year=2008 |last1=Yezioro |first1=Abraham |last2=Dong |first2=Bing |last3=Leite |first3=Fernanda |journal=Energy and Buildings |volume=40 |issue=4 |pages=612–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed an artificial intelligence approach towards assessing building performance simulation results and found that more detailed simulation tools have the best simulation performance in terms of heating and cooling electricity consumption within 3% of mean absolute error.

Explorations are underway to pair computer network users' personal, private and public authentication choices, geographic mapping systems and evolving cloud computing security architecture models, together, to offer customers of geospatial securitization services intuitive new ways to organize their personal, private and public applications and storage.  For individuals, businesses and government authorities who generate and manage building information, new ways to discover, share and work on data, within the context of particular places on earth, will be offered.  David Plager, AIA, conjectures that today's web will give way to tomorrow's geo-web where data will be structured first by place (e.g. a postal address) and then by space (Personal (one user), Private (a group of users) and Public (all users)).{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

===BIM-GIS integration===
#Industrial Foundation Class (IFC) and City Geography Markup Language (CityGML) are two primary and popular standards for BIM-[[GIS]] integration.
#BIM provides improved solutions for satisfying user requirements with BIM-GIS integration supported by spatio-temporal analysis.&lt;ref name=song&gt;{{cite journal|last=Song|first=Yongze|author2=Xiangyu Wang|title=Trends and Opportunities of BIM-GIS Integration in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction Industry: A Review from a Spatio-Temporal Statistical Perspective|journal=ISPRS Int. J. Geo-Inf.|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/6/12/397}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Building information science===
BIM will develop as building information science involving systematic theories, concepts, methods, technologies, applications and management for the digitization, visualization, quantitative analysis and decision-making of whole project life cycles in the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry.&lt;ref name=song /&gt;

}}

A '''Caganer''' ({{IPA-ca|kəɣəˈne}}) is a [[figurine]] depicted in the act of [[defecation]] appearing in [[nativity scene]]s in [[Catalonia]] and neighbouring [[Traditions of Catalonia|areas with Catalan culture]] such as [[Andorra]], [[Valencian Community|Valencia]], and [[Northern Catalonia]] (in southern [[France]]). It is most popular and widespread in these areas, but can also be found in other areas of [[Spain]] ([[Region of Murcia|Murcia]]), [[Portugal]], and southern [[Italy]] ([[Naples]]).

The name "El Caganer" literally means "the crapper" or "the shitter". Traditionally, the [[figurine]] is depicted as a peasant, wearing the traditional Catalan red cap (the [[barretina]]) and with his trousers down, showing a bare backside, and defecating.

== Origins ==
The exact origin of the Caganer is unknown, but the tradition has existed since at least the 18th century.&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12059969|title=A traditional Nativity scene, Catalan-style|journal=BBC News|date=23 December 2010|accessdate=23 December 2010|last1=Rainsford|first1=Sarah}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the society [http://www.amicsdelcaganer.cat/castella/figura/figuracaganer.htm Amics del Caganer] (Friends of the Caganer), it is believed to have entered the nativity scene by the late 17th or early 18th century, during the Baroque period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amicsdelcaganer.cat/catala/figura/figuracaganer.htm Amics del Caganer (Friends of the Caganer)]. Consulted 23 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Garske/&gt;  An [[Iberians|Iberian]] [[votive deposit]] was found near Tornabous in the [[Urgell (comarca)|Urgell]] depicting a holy Iberian warrior defecating on his [[falcata]]. This led to a brief altercation between the [[Institut d'Estudis Catalans]] and the Departament d'Arqueologia in the Conselleria de Cultura of the [[Generalitat de Catalunya]] as to whether the find can be regarded as a proto-caganer (which would place the origin of this tradition far earlier than previously thought) or just a representation of a pre-combat ritual.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

== Tradition ==
In [[Catalonia]], as well as in the rest of  [[Spain]] and in most of [[Italy]] and Southern [[France]], traditional Christmas decorations often consist of a large model of the city of Bethlehem, similar to the [[Nativity scene]]s of the English-speaking world but encompassing the entire city rather than just the typical manger scene. This ''pessebre'' is often a reproduction of a pastoral scene—a traditional Catalan ''masia'' (farmhouse) as the central setting with the child in a manger, and outlying scenes including a washerwoman by a river, a woman spinning, shepherds herding their sheep or walking towards the manger with gifts, the Three Wise Men approaching on camel back, a scene with the angel and shepherds, the star pointing the way, etc. Commonly materials such as moss will be used to represent grass, with cork used to represent mountains or cliffs. Another variant is to make the setting oriental, with the Wise Men arriving by camel and the figures dressed accordingly.

The caganer is a particular and highly popular feature of modern Catalan nativity scenes. It is believed to have entered the nativity scene by the late 17th or early 18th century, during the Baroque period.&lt;ref name="amicsdelcaganer.cat"&gt;[http://www.amicsdelcaganer.cat/catala/figura/figuracaganer.htm ''El Caganer'', by Jordi Arruga and Josep Mañà. (Barcelona: Alta Fulla, 1992), reproduced on the website Amics del Caganer (Friends of the Caganer)]. Consulted 23 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Eminent folklorist [[Joan Amades]] called it an essential piece and the most popular figure of the nativity scene. It can also be found in other parts of southwestern [[Europe]], including [[Region of Murcia|Murcia]], the region just south of the [[Valencian Community|Valencia]] in [[Spain]] (where they are called ''cagones''), [[Naples]] (''cacone'' or ''pastore che caca'') and [[Portugal]] (''cagões'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amicsdelcaganer.net/his6.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081215171316/http://www.amicsdelcaganer.net/his6.htm |archivedate=2008-12-15 |df= }} Amics del Caganer&lt;/ref&gt; There is a sculpture of a person defecating hidden inside the cathedral of [[Ciudad Rodrigo]], [[Province of Salamanca]], though this is not part of a nativity scene.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.histocat.cat/pdf/pessebre.pdf Jordi Bilbeny, ''Les arrels precristianes del pessebre de Nadal'' (The Pre-Christian Roots of the Nativity Scene)]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (article in Catalan).

A tradition in Catalonia is to have children find the hidden figure.

* The Caganer, by creating feces, is [[fertilize|fertilizing]] the Earth. According to the ethnographer [[Joan Amades]], it was a "customary figure in nativity scenes [pessebres] in the 19th century, because people believed that this deposit [symbolically] fertilized the ground of the nativity scenes, which became fertile and ensured the nativity scene for the following year, and with it, the health of body and peace of mind required to make the nativity scene, with the joy and happiness brought by Christmas near the hearth. Placing this figurine in the nativity scene brought good luck and joy and not doing so brought adversity."&lt;ref name="amicsdelcaganer.cat"/&gt;
* Many modern caganers represent celebrities and authority figures. By representing them with their pants down, the caganer serves as a leveling device to bring the mighty down.&lt;ref&gt;Erickson, Brad. Les virtuts cíviques del caganer. Caramella: Revista de música i cultura popular No. 25, pp. 47-50 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;
* As to the charge of blasphemy, as Catalan anthropologist Miguel Delgado has pointed out, the grotesque, rather than a negation of the divine may actually signify an intensification of the sacred, for what could be more grotesque than the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, a bloody public torture and execution as the defining moment in the story of Christianity?&lt;ref&gt;Delgado Ruiz, Manuel. 2001. Luces iconoclastas: Anticlericalism, espacio, y ritual en la España contemporánia, Ariel Antropología. Barcelona: Editorial Ariel.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In his essay ''Les virtuts cìviques del caganer'' ("The Civic Virtues of the Defecator"), American anthropologist Brad Erickson argues that Catalans use the caganer to process and respond to contemporary social issues such as immigration and the [[Caganer#Controversy surrounding Barcelona's civility ordinance|imposition of public civility regulations]].&lt;ref&gt;Erickson, Brad. Les virtuts cìviques del caganer. Caramella: Revista de música i cultura popular. No. 25, pp. 47-50 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

Further opinions:&lt;ref&gt;The following opinions are translated from [http://www.amicsdelcaganer.cat/catala/figura/figuracaganer.htm ''El Caganer'', by Jordi Arruga and Josep Mañà. (Barcelona: Alta Fulla, 1992), reproduced on the website Amics del Caganer (Friends of the Caganer)]. Consulted 23 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "The caganer was the most mischievous and out-of-place character of the pessebre's [otherwise] idyllic landscape; he was the "Other", with everything that entails, and as the "Other", was accepted, in a liberal vein, as long as he did not aim to occupy the foreground. The caganer represented the spoilsport that we all have inside of us, and that's why it is not surprising that it was the most beloved figure among the children and, above all, the adolescents, who were already beginning to feel rather like outsiders at the family celebration." {{ill|Agustí Pons|ca}}
* "The caganer is a hidden figure and yet is always sought out like the lost link between transcendence and contingency. Without the caganer, there would be no nativity scene but rather a liturgy, and there would be no real country but just the false landscape of a model." [[Joan Barril]]
* "The caganer seems to provide a counterpoint to so much ornamental hullabaloo, so much emotive treacle, so much contrived beauty." {{ill|Josep Murgades|ca}}
* "The caganer is, like so many other things that have undergone the filtering of a great many generations, a cult object; with the playful, aesthetic and superficial devotion that we feel towards all the silly things that fascinate us deep down." {{ill|Jordi Soler|es|Jordi Soler (escritor)}}

== Local reactions ==
The practice is tolerated by the [[Catholic]] church within the areas where the Caganer is popular. Although the tradition generally has popular support, opinion is divided as to whether it is wholly appropriate and not all nativity scenes in Catalonia include caganers.

== Similar traditions ==
The Caganer is not the only defecating character in the Catalan Christmas tradition&amp;mdash;another is the ''[[Tió de Nadal]]'', which also makes extensive use of the image of fecal matter (it is a log, i.e. tió which, having been "fed" for several weeks, is told to defecate on Christmas Eve and "magically" produces candy for children, a candy that has supposedly come from its bowels). Other mentions of feces and defecation are common in Catalan folklore: indeed, a popular Catalan saying for use before a meal is ''menja bé, caga fort i no tinguis por a la mort!''  ("Eat well, shit heartily, and don't be afraid of death!"). In his book ''Barcelona'', architecture critic and locale historian [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]] gives a good introduction to this earthy tradition.

The Caganer can also be found in other European cultures, either as an import or a minor local tradition:
*In France: ''Père la Colique'' ("Father [[Cholic]]").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cavi.univ-paris3.fr/phalese/aragon/perelacolique.htm Reference to this figure on the website: Centre de recherches Hubert de Phalèse - Université de la Sorbonne Nouvelle - Paris III] (in [[French language|French]]).

Possible translations of the caganer concept into other languages include:
*In the [[Dutch language|Dutch]]/[[Flemish]]: ''Kakkers / Schijterkes'' ("Pooper"/"Little Pooper")
*In [[German language|German]]: ''Choleramännchen'' or ''Hinterlader'' ("Little Cholera Man" or "Breech-loader")

== Traditional vs. modern portrayals ==
[[File:Caganers.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Modern caricature caganers for sale]]
The traditional caganer is portrayed as a Catalan [[peasant]] man (i.e. a farmer or shepherd) wearing a typical hat called a ''[[barretina]]'' &amp;mdash; a red stocking hat with a black band. At least since the late 1970s, the figure of a traditional Catalan peasant woman was also added, wearing traditional garb including the long black hairnet.

The Catalans have modified this tradition a good deal since the 1940s. In addition to the traditional caganer design, one can easily find other characters assuming the Caganer position, such as [[nun]]s, [[devil]]s, [[Santa Claus]], celebrities, athletes, historical figures, politicians, Spanish royalty, [[UK|British]] royalty,&lt;ref name="BBC News"/&gt; and other famous people past and present. Just days after his election as US president in 2008, a "pooper" of [[Barack Obama]] was made available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://au.truveo.com/Obama-pooper-get-one-this-xmas/id/286101039 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206081335/http://au.truveo.com/Obama-pooper-get-one-this-xmas/id/286101039 |archivedate=2008-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== At markets and exhibits ==
Caganers are easiest to find before Christmas in holiday markets, like the one in front of the [[Cathedral of Santa Eulalia]], which has many tables of Caganers. Every year new figures are created, and some people collect them. Caganers are the focal point of at least one association ([http://www.amicsdelcaganer.cat/angles/index.htm Els Amics del Caganer, i.e. Friends of the Caganer]), which puts out a regular bulletin ([http://www.amicsdelcaganer.cat/catala/caganofil/caganofil.htm "El Caganòfil"]), and have even been featured in art exhibits.

In recent years a urinating statue, or Pixaner, has also appeared, but it has not taken root or gained any serious popularity.

== Controversy surrounding Barcelona's civility ordinance ==
[[File:Pessebre a la plaça de Sant Jaume - caganer.JPG|thumb|The caganer in the 2011 official nativity scene in Barcelona's [[Plaça de Sant Jaume]]]]
In 2005, the Barcelona city council provoked a public outcry by commissioning a nativity scene which did not include a caganer. The local government was reported to have countered these criticisms by claiming that the Caganer was not included because a civility ordinance&lt;ref&gt;Suñé, Ramon. 2006a. La nueva ordenanza del civismo impera desde hoy en Barcelona. La
Vanguadia, January 25.&lt;/ref&gt; had made [[public defecation]] and [[public urination]] illegal, meaning that the caganer was now setting a bad example.&lt;ref&gt;Caganer, Amics del. 2005. Nova polèmica amb la figura del Caganer 2005 [cited. Available from http://www.amicsdelcaganer.org/index1.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Barcelona's Christmas Crapper Canned | publisher=Scoop | url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL0512/S00250.htm | date=2005-12-25 | first=Jeremy | last=Rose }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many saw this as an attack on Catalan traditions. One writer of a letter to the editor asserted, "A nativity scene without a caganer is not a nativity scene."&lt;ref&gt;Castells, E. 2005. La ausencia de 'caganer' en el pesebre de Sant Jaume enfrenta a los políticos. La Vanguardia de Barcelona, 30/11/2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  A second writer offered a win-win solution. He suggested including the caganer but also placing a figure of a police officer with a pen and clipboard next to him, writing a ticket for the infraction. The writer said this would achieve three objectives: respect tradition, comply with the ordinance and educate the public about how it is being reinforced, and finally, demonstrate how important it is to respect the law.&lt;ref&gt;Giménez, Joaquín. 2005. Multa al 'caganer'. La Vanguardia de Barcelona, 29/11/2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the head of Parks and Gardens publicly denied prohibiting the caganer in the first place, saying that it was the artistic decision of the artist commissioned by the city to design and install the pessebre.&lt;ref&gt;Castells, E. 2005. La ausencia de 'caganer' en el pesebre de Sant Jaume enfrenta a los políticos.
La Vanguardia de Barcelona, 30/11/2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Following a campaign against the caganer's absence called ''Salvem el caganer'' (Save the caganer), and widespread media criticism, the 2006 nativity restored the caganer, who appeared on the northern side of the nativity near a dry riverbed.

A '''charrette''' (American pronunciation: {{IPAc-en|ʃ|ɑː|ˈ|ɹ|ɛ|t|}}), often Anglicized to '''charette''' or '''charet''' and sometimes called a '''design charrette''', is an intense period of [[design]] or [[planning]] activity.

==Origins of the term "charrette"==
The word ''charrette'' is [[French language|French]] for "[[cart]]" or "[[chariot]]." Its use in the sense of design and planning arose in the 19th century at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] in [[Paris]], where it was not unusual at the end of a term for teams of student architects to work right up until a deadline, when a charrette would be wheeled among them to collect up their scale models and other work for review. Their continued working furiously to apply the finishing touches came to be referred to as working ''en charrette'', "in the cart."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bonda|first=Penny|title=Sustainable Commercial Interiors|year=2007|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|page=29|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=smbC2VdZE5MC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Émile Zola]] depicted such a scene of feverish activity, a ''nuit de charrette'' or "charrette night," in ''[[L'Œuvre]]'' (serialized 1885, published 1886), his fictionalized account of his friendship with [[Paul Cézanne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gendrat|first=Aurélie|title=Émile Zola, L'Œuvre|year=1999|publisher=Bréal|page=56|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y5bLDsrgErkC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term evolved into the current design-related usage in conjunction with working right up until a deadline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The NCI Charrette System|url=http://www.charretteinstitute.org/charrette.html|publisher=Charrette Institute|accessdate=February 12, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131126100645/http://www.charretteinstitute.org/charrette.html|archivedate=November 26, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--In the 16th, 17th, and 18th century when travel took long periods, a ''charrette'' referred to long carriage rides{{cn}}, in which politicians and policy makers would be sequestered together in order to collaborate in solving a set problem over the duration of their journey. This origin is most similar to the current usage of the word in the design world.--&gt;

==Charrettes in general==

The word ''charrette'' may refer to any collaborative session in which a group of [[designers]] drafts a solution to a design problem.

While the structure of a charrette varies, depending on the design problem and the individuals in the group, charrettes often take place in multiple sessions in which the group divides into sub-groups.  Each sub-group then presents its work to the full group as material for further [[dialogue]]. Such charrettes serve as a way of quickly generating a design solution while integrating the aptitudes and interests of a diverse group of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govanpartick.com/what.html|title=Govan Partick Charrette|website=www.govanpartick.com|accessdate=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the structure of charrettes may vary, the general idea of a charrette is to create an innovative atmosphere in which a diverse group of stakeholders can collaborate to "generate visions for the future".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-007-7031-7_2|title=The Design Charrette|last=Roggema|first=Rob|date=2014|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=9789400770300|editor-last=Roggema|editor-first=Rob|pages=15–34|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-94-007-7031-7_2#page-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compare this term with [[workshop]].

==Specific cases of charrette==
Charrettes take place in many disciplines, including [[land use planning]], or [[urban planning]].  In planning, the charrette has become a technique for consulting with all [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]].  This type of charrette (sometimes called an enquiry by design) typically involves intense and possibly multi-day meetings, involving [[municipal]] officials, [[real estate developer|developer]]s, and residents.  A successful charrette promotes joint ownership of solutions and attempts to defuse typical confrontational attitudes between residents and developers.  Charrettes tend to involve small groups, however the residents participating  may not represent all the residents nor have the [[moral authority]] to represent them.  Residents who do participate get early input into the planning process.   For developers and municipal officials charrettes achieve community involvement, may satisfy [[Public consultation|consultation]] criteria, with the objective of avoiding costly legal battles.  Other uses of the term "charrette" occur within an academic or [[profession]]al setting, whereas urban planners invite the general public to their planning charrettes.  Thus most people (unless they happen to be design students) encounter the term "charrette" in an urban-planning context.

In fields of [[design]] such as [[architecture]], [[landscape architecture]], [[industrial design]], [[interior design]], [[interaction design]], or [[graphic design]], the term ''charrette'' may refer to an intense period of work by one person or a group of people prior to a deadline. The period of a charrette typically involves both focused and sustained effort. The word "charrette" may also be used as a verb, as in, for example, "I am charretting" or "I am on charrette [or: en charrette]," simply meaning I am working long nights, intensively toward a deadline.

An example of a charrette occurred in Florida in 1973 when the future residents of the [[Miccosukee Land Co-op]] in Tallahassee traveled by auto caravan to Orlando and spent the weekend at the offices of the King Helie Planning Group of Orlando (sleeping on the floor) working with its staff to develop the community's land use plans; features desired by individual members and acceptable to the group included a perfectly circular lot, a huge treehouse lot, and streets named after Beatles songs (such as "The Long and Winding Road". "Penny Lane", "Abbey Road"). A more recent example, from [[New College of Florida]], is their Master Plan Design Charrettes that took place over a week in 2005 involving students, alumni, administrators, professors, area residents, and local government staff members as well as architects, designers, and planners from Moule &amp; Polyzoides, The Folsom Group, the Florida House Institute for Sustainable Development, Hall Planning &amp; Engineering, and Biohabitats in a process to make long-range suggestions for the campus layout, landscaping, architecture, and transportation corridors of the master plan for its campus.

In some cases, a charrette may be held on a recurring basis, such as the annual charrette held by the Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning department at Utah State University. Each February, the faculty choose a site in partnership with communities and groups throughout Utah, and hold an intense 5-day design charrette focusing on particular issues in that community or region. The charrette begins with a field visit, followed by all-day work sessions accompanied by project stakeholders and volunteer landscape architects and other professionals, and overseen by senior and graduate level students. The final work is then presented to the community. Charrettes such as these offer students and professionals the opportunity to work together in a close setting on real-world design scenarios, and often provide communities with tens of thousands of dollars of design work for free.

The Schools of Architecture at [[Rice University]] and at the [[University of Virginia]] call the last week before the end of classes ''Charrette''.&lt;ref name="Kemmer2008"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Suzanne Kemmer |title=Charrette: Neologisms |url=https://neologisms.rice.edu/index.php?a=term&amp;d=1&amp;t=11504 |website=neologisms.rice.edu |publisher=Rice University |accessdate=16 September 2018 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20180916151329/https://neologisms.rice.edu/index.php?a=term&amp;d=1&amp;t=11504 |archivedate=September 16, 2018 |location=Houston, Texas |language=en |date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maital2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shlomo Maital|title=Innovate Your Innovation Process: 100 Proven Tools|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2-exDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA103|year=2016|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-981-4759-95-3|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the final deadline time (assigned by the school), all students must put their "pencils down" and stop working. Students then present their work to fellow students and faculty in a [[critique]]d presentation.

Many municipalities around the world develop long-term city plans or visions through multiple charrettes - both communal and professional.  Notable successes on the west coast of Canada include the city of [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]] {{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}, as well as the District of Tofino. Tofino won an Award of Excellence in Planning after a successful multi-day charrette.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityspaces.ca/project/tofino-downtown-vitalization-plan/|title=Award-Winning Tofino Downtown Vitalization Plan -|publisher=|accessdate=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''City Music Society''' was formed in [[London]], United Kingdom, in 1943. It was influenced by lunchtime concerts organised by [[Hilda Bor]] at the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]] and by [[Myra Hess]] at the [[National Gallery (London)|National Gallery]]. The driving force in the Society's foundation was [[Ivan Sutton]], with help and encouragement by Bor, who became its Vice-President, and from [[Edric Cundell]], Principal of the [[Guildhall School of Music]], who served as its first President. It was described in an obituary of Sutton as "one of the City of London's most remarkable institutions".&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19960628/ai_n14046811 Obituary: Ivan Sutton] ''[[The Independent]]'', June 28, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first event, a lecture by Cundell, took place in December 1943 at the Guildhall School, shortly followed by the first concert, a performance by the [[Morley College Choir]], in January 1944. After subsequent Society concerts at the [[Chartered Insurance Institute]] and the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]], Sutton succeeded in convincing the [[Goldsmiths' Company]] to allow the use of its hall for a series of three evening concerts in the autumn of 1946. In the autumn of 1947 the lunchtime concerts moved from the Guildhall School to the [[Bishopsgate Institute]] where the opening concert by [[Louis Kentner]] attracted a capacity audience. Since then evening concerts at Goldsmith's Hall and Tuesday lunchtime concerts at [[Bishopsgate Institute]] have provided the regular framework within which the work of the Society has evolved.
The Society, at present, stages around 26 concerts per year and has over 2000 lunchtime and early evening concerts to its credit. It completed its 60th-anniversary season in April 2004. As well as featuring well-established musicians, the Society's policy has always attempted to invite outstanding young professional artists who are at the beginning of their careers to perform at its concerts, many of whom have since attained international status. Furthermore, over the years the Society has commissioned many new works - on average one every three years - from a wide and diverse range of British composers, including [[Roger Smalley]], [[Nicholas Maw]], [[Diana Burrell]], [[Richard Rodney Bennett]], [[Elizabeth Maconchy]], [[Phyllis Tate]], [[Robin Holloway]], [[John McCabe (composer)|John McCabe]], [[Geoffrey Burgon]], [[Peter-Paul Nash]], [[Kevin Volans]] and [[Michael Berkeley]].

'''Conservation and restoration of objects made from plastics'''  is an activity dedicated to the [[Conservation (cultural heritage)|conservation]] of objects of historical and personal value made from [[plastics]]. When applied to [[cultural heritage]] this activity is generally undertaken by a [[conservator-restorer]]. Within museum collections there are a variety of artworks and artifacts that are composed of [[plastic]] material whether they are [[Synthetic plastic|synthetic]] or semi-synthetic; these were created for a range of uses from artistic, to technical, to domestic use. Plastics have become an integral component of life and many plastic objects have become staple icons or objects worth preserving for the future.  Although relatively new material for museum collections, plastics having originated in the 19th century, they are deteriorating at an alarming rate, risking the loss not only of the objects themselves, but through their deterioration processes they place objects within their vicinity at risk too.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Plastics are made of synthetic, semi-synthetic and organic material, all of which are susceptible to degradation, with their respective off-gassing being harmful to the objects nearby in museum collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|pmc=2874019|title=Our Plastic Age|last=Thompson|first=Richard|date=2009|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent changes in plastic manufacturing, as a result of environmental concerns, towards [[biodegradable plastics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://response.restoration.noaa.gov/about/media/what-you-can-do-keep-plastic-out-ocean.html|title=What You Can Do to Keep Plastic out of the Ocean {{!}} response.restoration.noaa.gov|website=response.restoration.noaa.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; have a potentially negative effect upon the long term stability of such objects within museum collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Madden|first=Odile|date=Spring 2014|title=Preserving Plastics: An Evolving Material, a Maturing Profession spring 2014.

== Identification and composition of plastics  ==
All plastics vary by the type of polymer used to create it, these polymers are what conservators look to in order to divide plastics into groupings that could best help create a preservation or restoration plan. Groupings are important as some plastics can be dangerous or even flammable thus it is key to identify these plastics in order to best understand how to store and care for them.

== Identifying plastics ==
Identification of plastic in a collection is extremely important because all plastics release a harmful toxin or gas that can damage nearby objects and by being able to identity the most harmful plastics a preservation plan can be set into place to slow down the effects and protect other objects.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Plastics are identified in three ways including looking for its trade name, trademark or patent number. Identifying plastic is done in order to  check what the plastic is composed of as different makers and depending on the year are different material could have been used to make the plastic.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2010|title=Care and Identification of Objects Made from Plastic|url=https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/08-04.pdf|journal=Conserve O Gram|volume=|pages=|via=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If there is no marker to identify the type of plastic used then it can be identified by using various types of data analyzed using [[Spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] technology like, [[Optical spectrometer|Optical Spectroscopy]], [[Raman spectroscopy|Raman]] and [[Near-infrared spectroscopy|near-infared spectroscopy]] along with [[mass spectrometry]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Other forms of identification include [[elemental analysis]], thermal analysis to decipher the composition of plastics.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Once the composition is found it is best to determine if the plastic in the collection will be considered Malignant or not.

[http://www.modip.ac.uk/ MoDiP], the Museum of Design in plastics,  has created a guide to plastic objects that includes the objects  manufacturing date,  manufacturing process along with its typical characteristics such as feel and smell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.modip.ac.uk/resources/curators_guide/A-Z_plastics|title=A - Z of plastics materials {{!}} Museum of Design in Plastics, MoDiP|website=www.modip.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is important because if an object in the collection that is listed here differs from smell or touch then it could be the object has begun to deteriorate. It is also encouraged that if one has an object not listed then they should contact MoDiP to include it to the list.

== Common plastics ==
These are plastics that are still capable of degradation but its effects are not as harmful to nearby objects.The list below is of chemical compositions that make up common plastics found in museum collections:
* Cellulose Esters&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/newsletters/29_1/preserving.html|title=Preserving Plastics: An Evolving Material a Maturing Profession (Feature)|website=www.getty.edu|access-date=2018-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Plasticized PVC,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ([[Polyvinyl chloride|Polyvinyl Chloride]], PVC)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.creativemechanisms.com/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-pvc-plastic|title=Everything You Need To Know About PVC Plastic|last=Staff|first=Creative Mechanisms|access-date=2018-04-04|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These are plastics that will age faster if left untreated and have a higher potential or off-gassing or release a toxin that can damage surrounding objects.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; To determine if objects are considered malignant proper identification of the object will be necessary.  
* [[Polyvinyl chloride|Poly(Vinyl Chloride)]]
* [[Cellulose nitrate|Cellulose Nitrate]]
* [[Cellulose acetate|Cellulose Acetate]]
* [[Vulcanization|Vulcanized Rubber]] 
* [[Bioplastic|Biodegradable plastics]]

[[Bioplastic|Biodegradable plastics]] have become an issue because as plastic is used in many everyday objects the push to create biodegradable plastics has been on the rise. This causes an issue for conservators because these object will ultimately degrade as their composition is designed to as there is an increase in plastic waste.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is these biodegradable plastics that can be prove to be difficult and museums will need to provide research for these items quickly to slow done their deterioration.

== Deterioration ==
Perhaps the most difficult part about plastic deterioration is that one cannot visibly see what types of chemical reactions are occurring inside the polymer or even identity the type of plastic until it is too late. Typically all plastics will give off a distinct odor, leak toxins, or will begin to shrink or crack in some way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/blog/network/identification-of-plastics-by-looking-touching-and-smelling|title=Identification of plastics by looking, touching and smelling|work=Blog|access-date=2018-04-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although deterioration will inevitably happen it is important to know  the causes of it and be able to mitigate it.

=== Causes of deterioration  ===
The cause of deterioration regarding plastics can be linked to age, chemical composition, storage, and improper handling of the objects. Conservators are in place to slow down the processes of deterioration by considering the 4 leading caused of deterioration:

# '''Age'''-  when plastics were first manufactured in the 19th century they were composed of semi-organic material, thus these over the years these objects have deteriorated due to lack of research and improper handling of these plastics.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Without enough time to care for objects the older objects have deteriorated. 
# '''Chemical''' - Depending on the objects' chemical composition, conservators can understand how it will react overtime. Other chemical reactions come from heat, oxygen, light, liquids, additives and biological attacks as these can cause a reaction in the polymer to speed up deterioration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Chemical reactions are also caused by objects coming into contact with water and oxygen.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  
# '''Storage-'''  When objects are improperly stored is when contamination and deterioration can occur. This often occurs when temperature or relative humidity fluctuate in the storage area as this causes the polymers to react to the environment and will begin to deteriorate and possible contaminate surrounding objects. Storage should also be thought of as when an object is on exhibit as this is when the object is on display with lights and its temperature and humidity can fluctuate, being able to create a plan to adjust the exhibit case while on display can help prevent any damage.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
# '''Improper handling''' - This is due in part to improper cleaning techniques when using water or solvents on material that do not support those cleaning methods.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Also when handling the objects human error can occur that can cause abrasions or scratches.

=== Types of deterioration  ===
Understanding the different types of plastic chemical degradation as this helps determine what not to expose plastics to  As the polymers that are composed of the plastics can deteriorate easily by changes in temperature, water or light it is important to understand how these affect the polymers. Listed below are the chemical reactions that occur with the deterioration of the polymer's structure.

* '''Photo-oxidative degradation''' refers to plastic object degrading by being exposed to UV and Visible Light although the type of wavelength that will damage the plastic depends on the composition of the polymer.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Singh|first=Balijit|date=2007|title=Mechanistic Implications of Plastic Degradation|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141391007003539|journal=Polymer Degradation and Stability|volume=93|pages=561–584|via=ScienceDirect}}&lt;/ref&gt; In General however, plastic will be affected by light and it is best practice to keep plastic away from light sources as much as possible. 
* '''[[Thermal degradation of polymers|Thermal degradation]]''' affects the whole unit of the polymer that the object is composed of and is affected by the temperature and amount of light the object is exposed to.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; 
* '''Ozone-Induced degradation''' will deteriorate saturated and  unsaturated polymers when the polymer is exposed to "ozone in the air" will speed the process of deterioration.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; A test is conducted to see if the objects has been exposed by taking small samples and analyzed using an [[FTIR]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;
* '''[[Catalysis|Catalytic Degradation]]''' Mainly focuses on plastic waste polymers as they are transformed into hydrocarbons
* '''[[Biodegradation]]''' is when the surface or the strength of the plastic changes, these properties allow it to decompose or mineralize by carbon dioxide and water.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;
* '''Decomposition of Hydroperoxides''' is when metal and metal ions are found on the plastic material as this can also lead to the deterioration of the object&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2012|title=Physical and Chemical processes leading to deterioration  of original properties of plastic|url=http://popart-highlights.mnhn.fr/wp-content/uploads/4_Degradation/2_Physical_and_chemical_processes/4_2_PhysicalAndChemicalProcessesLeadingToDeterioration.pdf|journal=Processes Leading to the Deterioration of Plastics|volume=|pages=|via=POPART}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}Additional effects of deterioration

For plastics composed of [[Cellulose acetate|Cellulose Acetate]] the  most common sign of  deterioration condition is when it this type is exposed to water, it will give off a smell of vinegar ([[Vinegar syndrome]]),  its surface will have  a white powder residue  and it will begin to shrink.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Cellulose Acetate butyrate and Cellulose butyrate will produce [[butyric acid]] which has a "vomit odor".&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

[[Polyvinyl chloride|Poly(Vinyl Chloride]]) will most likely cause a blooming effect, white spores, on the surface that if it comes into contact with other surrounding material it will contaminate it.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== Preventative care  ==
=== Handling ===
Safety gloves such as those made of Nitrile can help prevent toxins entering the skin when handling plastic objects.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; As plastics can ooze or off-gas material that may or may not be visible to the naked eye wearing gloves other than cotton is recommended.

=== Storage environment ===
Proper storage of plastics can help slow down the degrading process of plastics. Plastics are currently stored with a RH Level of 50% with the storage temperature at 18 degrees Celsius with no light coming into contact with the objects.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shashoua|first=Yvonne|date=2014|title=A Safe Space Storage Strategies for Plastics|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/newsletters/29_1/storage.html|journal=Conservation Perspectives|volume=29|pages=|via=http://getty.edu/conservation/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the composition of each plastic material can be different it is difficult to determine one unifying storage care plan ,thus  understanding the composition of the plastic can help determine their preferred climate levels.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Keeping plastics at a stable low temperature or considering placing these objects either in cold storage or in oxygen impermeable bags helps slow degradation.

Monitoring plastics in their storage environment is done by keeping track of their status and condition by using log entries on Excel spreadsheets or another format. To monitoring their temperature environment this is done using data loggers which track hourly changes in temperature. These methods can help strengthen a plan of preventative care as monitoring their status along with temperature can help connect any changes that occur.

=== Long-term storage equipment ===
Adsorbents such as "activated carbon, silica gel and zeolites"  are used as they can help with the gasses that are released from plastics as this material can help slow down the degrading process.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These absorbents can also be used when the object is on display to prevent and off-gassing that could occur, so these can be used on exhibit and long-term storage. Absorbents along with acid-free boxes and silica gel can help slow down the process of degradation and [[Cellulose acetate film|vinegar syndrome]] which is common in film, Lego and artwork. A yearly check up of plastic objects can help monitor the condition of plastic objects as well as the condition of the surrounding objects to ensure they have not been contaminated.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Objects composed of Cellulose Nitrate  benefit from cold storage as they are sensitive to increases in temperature.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

'''[http://www.gaylord.com/Preservation/Conservation-Supplies/Wrapping%2C-Lining-%26-Support-Materials/Marvelseal%26%23174%3B-360-Barrier-Film-%2850-ft-%29/p/M3650 Oxygen Impermeable bags]''' are used as they absorb all the oxygen in the bag.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; With no oxygen to trigger the event of deterioration that is used for some plastics the process may be slowed down.

== Conservation   ==
The process of conservation and restoration of plastics requires an understanding of composition of the plastic and an appreciation for the possible methods of restoring plastics and their limitations, as well as an appreciation for the post-treatment preventive care of the object.

=== Cleaning ===
The process of cleaning plastics is done through the use of solvents or using modern technology after identifying the polymers that make up the composition of the plastic. Cleaning can still be done using water or solvents however,  solvents run the risk of physically damaging the object.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://popart-highlights.mnhn.fr/wp-content/uploads/5_Active_conservation/1_Conservation_of_plastics_in_collections/5_1_Introduction.pdf|title=Studies in Active Conservation of Plastic Artefacts in Museums|last=Shashoua|first=Yvonne|publisher=POPART|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spot test can be performed if uncertain how the object will react to water or solvents.

Light cleaning on the object is possible, but if cleaning requires a heavy hand then the use of  an Erbium: YAG Laser could assist in cleaning tougher scratches or abrasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/eryag-laser|title=Er:YAG laser - an overview {{!}} ScienceDirect Topics|website=www.sciencedirect.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Scratch removal ===
Within the field of contemporary art, where the finish is part of the artists intent the removal of scratches plays a far greater role than it would with social-historical artifacts, as such conservators have undertaken, and scientifically investigated, a variety of methods of scratch removal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laganà|first=Ana|date=2014|title=Looking through Plastics: Investigating options for the treatment of scratches, abrasions, and losses in cast unsaturated polyester works of art|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/our_projects/education/cons_plastics/related_mats.html|journal=COM-CC 17th Triennial Conference Preprints,|volume=|pages=|via=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/our_projects/science/art_LA/paper_2014_icom_cc.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Filling ===
Fillings are used if the object has suffered considerable damage. The process of filling depends on the objects chemical composition consisting  of- refractive indexes, transparency, low viscosity, and its compatibility with the rest of the object.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/blog/conservation-journal/the-use-of-lasers-in-the-conservation-of-museum-objects-made-from-plastics|title=The use of lasers in the conservation of museum objects made from plastics|work=Blog|access-date=2018-03-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''corporate design''' (CD) is the official graphical [[design]] of the [[logo]] and name of a [[company]] or institution used on [[letterhead]]s, envelopes, forms, folders, [[brochure]]s, etc. The [[Corporate identity|house style]] is created in such a way that all the elements are arranged in a distinctive design and pattern.

This includes dictating what ink [[pantone]]s should be used in the coloring, and what [[typeface]]s.

Governments may have corporate designs as well. On June 2, 1999, the German federal cabinet introduced a corporate design for the flag of Germany.&lt;ref name="design-literatur"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://styleguide.bundesregierung.de/Webs/SG/DE/Print-Styleguide/Basiselemente/Farben/Primaerfarben/primaerfarben.html |title=Primärfarben |work=Corporate Design Documentation |author=Federal Government of Germany |date=17 December 2007 |accessdate=2008-02-26 |language=de |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915085300/http://styleguide.bundesregierung.de/Webs/SG/DE/Print-Styleguide/Basiselemente/Farben/Primaerfarben/primaerfarben.html |archivedate=15 September 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term 'corporate design' is not the name of a specific design profession.

Corporations do have special design needs based on their behaviors. They communicate their mission, objectives, needs, and product information -- with users, clients, or members; with suppliers, distributors, service providers; with the surrounding community and the media; with financial institutions and other corporations, and with the state. They create, acquire, modify, organize and distribute large amounts of information and raw data, as well as goods and services. (Sometimes the goods or services are themselves information. For example, ''The Yellow Pages'', or ''The New York Times''.)

A designer whose client is a corporation will include the logo and other elements of the corporate brand as a way to standardize and unify all communication between company and audience, whether in print or online. Scenarios that includes human-computer interactions take place through software and hardware user interfaces that are also branded and designed with the [[corporate culture]] in mind. (Examples of user scenarios: update the Web site, transfer funds, document procedures, control security, operate machinery, plan projects, conduct virtual meetings, check inventory, fill an order, or ship a product.)

These interactions are increasingly taking place through Web sites, through mobile devices and at dedicated terminals, and may include sound, video, animation and user feedback mechanisms. A savvy designer will create designs that can be adapted to all of these applications.

'''Design Studies''' is an [[Discipline (academia)|academic discipline]] that pursues a critical understanding of [[design]] and its effects through analytical and practical modes of inquiry. Its origins can be traced to [[design history]] where the field first got its start&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buchanan|first1=Richard|title=Design Research and the New Learning|journal=Design Issues|date=2001|volume=17,|issue=4|pages=3–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; before slowly expanding to include larger themes and more varied subject matters. In that light, Victor Margolin, one of the founders of the discipline in the US, proposes Design Studies as a term that comprises various design researches and relates them to one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Margolin|first1=Victor|title=Design History or Design Studies: Subject Matter and Methods|journal=Design Issues|date=1995|volume=11|issue= 1|pages=4–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a highly interdisciplinary field, Design Studies references many scholarship paradigms and focuses on how design knowledge is developed, articulated and communicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cross|first1=Nigel|title=Design Research: A Disciplined Conversation|date=1999|volume=15|issue=02|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It therefore incorporates an expansive set of evolving methodologies and theories that are drawn from key thinkers and theorists from the field itself (such as [[Victor Margolin]], Clive Dilnot, and [[Richard Buchanan (academic)|Richard Buchanan]]), but also from several related fields such as, the [[humanities]] ([[literature]], [[art]], [[Visual Studies|visual studies]], [[cultural studies]]), the [[social science]]s ([[anthropology]], [[political science]]s, and [[sociology]]), the [[science]]s ([[engineering]], [[Materials science|material]] studies, [[neurology]], [[technology]] studies). Design Studies also generates scholarly work in the fields of [[architecture]], [[urban planning]] and [[Urban policy|policy]], and spatial studies. Design Studies not only considers objects, places and systems, it investigates their meanings, contexts, possibilities and consequences.

Design Studies recognizes that design, as a practice, is merely one facet of a much larger paradigm. It examines, probes, and questions the role of design in shaping past and present personal and cultural values, especially in light of how they shape the future. The subjects of Design Studies are inherently fluid while being anchored to a core body of work and scholarship that revolves around broader themes such as [[ethics]], environmental sustainment, and [[social sustainability]].

The American author, editor and educator Susan Yelavich, encapsulates the terrain of Design Studies as embracing "two broad perspectives—one that focuses inward on the nature of design and one that looks outward to the circumstances that shape it, and conversely, the circumstances design changes, intentionally or not."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://adht.parsons.edu/designstudies/double_profile_of_design_studie/|title=The Double Profile of Design Studies - Design Studies|website=adht.parsons.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== History of Design Studies ===
The history of the field of Design Studies can be traced to the early 1960s in England. In 1962, a “Conference on Design Methods” held in London led to the emergence of the [[Design Research Society]], bringing together academics and practitioners who shared interests in new approaches to the process of designing.&lt;ref name="Forty Years of Design Research"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cross|first1=Nigel|title=Forty Years of Design Research|journal=Design Studies|date=2007|volume=28|issue=1|pages=1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=https://www.designresearchsociety.org/cpages/about|website=Design Research Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, a series of conferences were held that helped continue the development of the [http://www.drs2016.org/222/ Design Methods Movement (DMM)]— a product of the post-war optimism of the 1950s, cancelled in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cross, Margolin|first1=Nigel, Victor|title=A History of Design Methodology, Design Methodology and Relationships with Science|date=1993|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This movement focused on the comparison between science and design and tried to determine methods that distinguished design as an important academic field apart from the realm of art and art history. However, in 1980 at the Design Research Society’s [https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/005784314 Design:Science:Method] conference concluded that there was not much for design to learn from science, instead, science had something to learn from design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cross, Margolin|first1=Nigel, Victor|title=A History of Design Methodology, Design Methodology and Relationships with Science|date=1993|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this point, design became a discipline of study “based on the view that design has its own things to know and its own ways of knowing them.” This stance was promulgated in the first issue of ''[https://www.journals.elsevier.com/design-studies Design Studies]'' with the launch of a series of articles in its pages called “Design as a Discipline''.''”&lt;ref name="Forty Years of Design Research"/&gt; (''[https://www.journals.elsevier.com/design-studies Design Studies, The Interdisciplinary Journal of Design Research]'' as it is now known, was first published as Design Studies 1, no.1 in July 1979. Produced by the publisher Reed Elsevier known since 2015 as [[Elsevier]]). The series began with [[L. Bruce Archer|Bruce Archer]], and his 1979 essay, “Whatever became of Design Methodology?”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Archer|first1=Bruce|title=Whatever Became of Design Methodology?|journal=Design Studies|date=1979|volume=1|issue=1|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his accompanying article from the same issue titled "The Three Rs," Archer places [[Design]] with a capital D as a third extreme in an education triangle with the [[Science]]s and [[Humanities]] situating design, though not exclusively, within acts of configuration, composition, meaning, value, and purpose in man-made phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Archer|first1=Bruce|title=The Three Rs|journal=Design Studies|date=1979|volume=1|issue=1|pages=17–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Debates about the discipline of design and design research continued through the 1980s and were significantly reignited in 1995 when [[Victor Margolin]], an American scholar who contributed to the development of design history, argued for a new approach to “Design Studies.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Margolin|first1=Victor|title=Design History or Design Studies: Subject Matter and Methods|journal=Design Issues|date=1995|volume=11|issue= 1|page=14|doi=10.2307/1511610}}&lt;/ref&gt; Margolin referred to the "dynamic crossings of intellectual boundaries" when describing the interdisciplinary nature of intellectual practice at the time. He felt that early design historians should question "whether design history as it [had] been constituted...[was] a viable enterprise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Margolin|first1=Victor|title=Design History or Design Studies: Subject Matter and Methods|journal=v|date=1995|volume=11|issue= 1|pages=4–15|doi=10.2307/1511610}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gooding, J. V., “Design History in Britain From the 1970's to 2012: Context, Formation and Development, Ph.D. Dissertation University of Northumbria, Newcastle (January 2012) p. 200-203&lt;/ref&gt;

Margolin defines design studies as a field of inquiry that addresses how we make and use products and how we have done so in the past. These products compromise the domain in the artificial. Design studies addresses ideas of product conception and planning, production, form, distribution, and use. It considers these topics in the present as well as in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Margolin|first1=Victor|title=The Politics of the Artificial: essays on design and design studies|date=2002|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Margolin's position triggered counter arguments about how to characterize the study of design. A battle in print began with his article titled, “Design history or design studies: subject matter and methods” published in the international journal ''Design Studies (Design Studies was the journal of the [[Design Research Society]], founded in the UK in 1966; the journal itself has been in publication since 1979).'' This controversial topic had resonance in Britain where [[Adrian Forty]]’s response appeared in the pages of the ''[[Journal of Design History]]'', in which he argued in favor of research that led to the understanding of quality judgements defining good design "as an entirely legitimate field for design historical research."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=DEBATE: A Reply to Victor Margolin|journal=Journal of Design History|date=1 January 1993|volume= 6|issue= 2|pages=131–132}}&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of this debate was made clear by the fact that it was reprinted in a special issue of ''[[Design Issues]]'' in 1995 where it refocused attention on "some of the controversies and problems that surround the seemingly simple task of telling the history of design."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buchanan, Doordan &amp; Margolin|first1=Richard, Dennis, Victor|title=Introduction|journal=v|date=Spring 1995|volume=11|issue= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shift from Design History to Design Studies started to occur as the research and approaches to the field began to focus on broader questions of meaning, authority and power, in other words, with the dynamics surrounding and enabling the practice of design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whiteley|first1=Nigel|title=Design History or Design Studies|date=1995|volume=1|issue= 1|pages=38–42|doi=10.2307/1511614}}&lt;/ref&gt; The realization came that Design History is only “but one component of what goes on in studying design, and to claim that all that is going on now could use the umbrella term 'design history’ is not tenable.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whiteley|first1=Nigel|title=Design History or Design Studies|date=1995|volume=1|issue= 1|page=40|doi=10.2307/1511614}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new field of Design Studies would now include not only design history, but also allow for a dialogue about “issues of product conception and planning, production, form, distribution, and use” in a historical and contemporary context.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=== Foundational Figures ===
[[L. Bruce Archer]]. (1922-2005) was a British mechanical engineer and later Professor of [[Design Research]] at the [[Royal College of Art]] who championed research in design, and helped to establish design as an academic discipline. Archer trained a generation of design researchers, showing them how the procedures of scholarly research based on well-founded evidence and systematic analysis were as applicable in design as in the more traditional academic subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Archer|first1=Bruce|title=A View of the Nature of Design Research Design:Science:Method|date=1981|publisher=Westbury House|location=Guildford}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967 he helped to found the cross-disciplinary [[Design Research Society]].&lt;ref&gt;Archer, Bruce, ‘A View of the Nature of Design Research’, in Jacques, R and Powell, J (eds), Design:Science:Method, Westbury House, Guildford, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reyner Banham]]. (1922-1988) Banham’s ''[https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/theory-and-design-first-machine-age Theory and Design in the First Machine Age]'' and his journalistic articles written for ''New Society'' have been described by the British writer and design historian [[Penny Sparke]] as representing a major “shift in how material culture was seen.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, S.

[[Richard Buchanan (academic)|Richard Buchanan]]. American professor of design, management, and information systems and editor of the journal [[Design Issues]]. He is well known for “extending the application of design into new areas of theory and practice, writing, and teaching as well as practicing the concepts and methods of interaction design.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Faculty and Research|url=https://weatherhead.case.edu/faculty/Richard-Buchanan|website=weatherhead.case.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a co-editor of ''Discovering Design: Explorations in Design Studies'' with Victor Margolin, he brought together the fields of psychology, sociology, political theory, technology studies, rhetoric, and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Margolin|first1=Victor|title=Discovering design explorations in design studies.

[[Richard Coyne]]. Professor at the [[University of Edinburgh]] and author of several books on the implications of information technology and design particularly as developed by Coyne's colleague [[Adrian Snodgrass]] in the 1990s, and with whom he co-authored the book ''Interpretation in Architecture: Design as a Way of Thinking''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Richard Coyne|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Coyne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nigel Cross]]. (born 1942) Cross is a British academic, design researcher and educator who focuses on design’s intellectual space in the academic sphere. He is a Professor of Design Studies in the Department of Design and Innovation, Faculty of Technology, at the UK's Open University, and Editor-in-Chief of Design Studies, the international journal of Design Research. With his 1982 journal article “Designerly Ways of Knowing” in ''Design Studies'', Cross argues that Design has its own intellectual and practical culture as a basis for education, contrasting it with cultures of Science and Arts and Humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cross|first1=Nigel|title=Designerly ways of knowing|journal=Design Studies|volume=3|issue=4|pages=221–7|doi=10.1016/0142-694X(8290040-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally educated as a fine artist, Dilnot later began studying social philosophy and the sociology of culture with Polish sociologist [[Zygmunt Bauman]]. Dilnot has worked on the history, theory, and criticism of the visual arts in their broadest terms. His teaching and writing have focused on design history, photography, [https://doi.org/10.1386/jwcp.1.2.177_1 criticism], and theory. Dilnot’s most significant contribution to design scholarship is a study of ethics in relation to design, and the role of design's capabilities in creating a humane world in his book, ''Ethics?

[https://artdesign.unsw.edu.au/about-us/our-staff/professor-cameron-tonkinwise Cameron Tonkinwise]. An Australian academic, Cameron Tonkinwise has a background in philosophy, with a particular emphasis on Heidegger's genealogy of thought and its informing design practice. Having worked closely with Tony Fry at the [http://www.changedesign.org/ Ecodesign Foundation] in the 1990s, Tonkinwise later headed initiatives in sustainability at Parsons, The New School, and later became chair of design studies at Carnegie Mellon University, where he set up the [https://design.cmu.edu/content/phd PhD programs] in [http://transitiondesign.net/ Transition Design] and Design Studies. Cameron's primary area of research is sustainable design and designing for socio-technical transitions - in particular, he focuses on the design of systems that lower societal materials intensity, primarily by decoupling use and ownership, i.e systems of shared use.

[[Adrian Forty]]: (born 1948) was Professor of Architectural History at The Bartlett, The Faculty of the Built Environment at University College London. Forty believed that the drive to define a new field, the field of Design Studies, was unnecessary due to the fact that the field of Design History had not exhausted all of its possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Forty|first1=Adrian|title=Debate: A Reply to Victor Margolin|journal=Design Issues|date=1995|volume=''11|issue= 1|pages=16–18|doi=10.2307/1511611}}&lt;/ref&gt; His book ''Objects of Desire''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/26320994|title=Objects of desire : design and society since 1750|last=Forty|first=Adrian,|date=1992|publisher=Thames and Hudson|year=|isbn=0500274126|location=New York, N.Y.|pages=|oclc=26320994}}&lt;/ref&gt; explores how consumer goods relate to larger issues of social processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Objects of desire : design and society since 1750|last1=Forty|first1=Adrian|date=1992|publisher=Thames and Hudson|year=|isbn=0500274126|location=New York, N.Y.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tony Fry]] is a British design theorist and philosopher who writes on the relationship between design, [[unsustainability]], and politics. Fry has taught design and [[Culture theory|cultural theory]] in Britain, the United States, Hong Kong and Australia.

[[John Heskett]] (1937-2014) In the late 1970s, Heskett became a prominent member of a group of academics based in several of Britain's art schools (then part of the polytechnics) who helped develop the discipline of design history and theory, later to become subsumed under the broader banner of Design Studies. In subsequent years, as design became a global practice increasingly valued by corporations and governments alike, design history became, along with design pedagogy, one of the nation's most successful academic exports. Heskett brought his deep knowledge of economics, politics and history to the project and worked alongside scholars from other disciplines to communicate the meaning and function of that increasingly important concept, "design", both past and present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sparke|first1=Penny|title=John Heskett obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/mar/12/john-heskett|website=the guardian|accessdate=October 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Victor Margolin]] (DS-History) Considered one of the founders of Design Studies, Victor Margolin is Professor Emeritus of Design History at the University of Illinois, Chicago. He is a co-editor of the academic design journal, ''Design Issues'', and is the author, editor, or co-editor of a number of books including ''Design Discourse'', ''Discovering Design'', ''The Idea of Design'', ''The Designed World'', and ''The Politics of the Artificial''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CMU Design Lecture Series: How do you Design the Future|url=http://www.design.cmu.edu/designthefuture/victor-margolin/|accessdate=Oct 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ahmed Ansari, Danah Abdulla, Ece Canli, Mahmoud Keshavarz, Matthew Kiem, Pedro Oliveira, Luiza Prado, and Tristan Schultz who make up the ''[http://www.decolonisingdesign.com/ Decolonising Design Group]'', “Coloniality is not an abstract concept nor is it a subject to be examined from a comfortable distance. It is something that affects our communities, our countries and our peoples every single day. It is a continuous process of domination and violence to which we are submitted. It demeans our knowledge, subjugates our bodies, and renders our lives arduous.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Decolonising Design, A Statement on the Design Research Society Conference 2016|url=http://www.decolonisingdesign.com/statements/2016/drs2016statement/#more-1|website=Decolonising Design|accessdate=November 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Established via their online blog “[http://www.decolonisingdesign.com/ Decolonising Design],” this collective of design researchers, academics, and practitioners working in and with the fields of Design Studies and Design Research firmly believe that “decolonisation is imperative for survival.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Decolonising Design, A Statement on the Design Research Society Conference 2016|url=http://www.decolonisingdesign.com/statements/2016/drs2016statement/#more-1|website=Decolonising Design|accessdate=November 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Decolonising Design Group's effort was born from their frustrations with academia during the events that led up to their withdrawal from the 2016 Design Research Society Conference and driven by their desire to engage in a profound debate of the colonial ethos of design and research. The collective believes it is, “not sufficient for design studies and design research to simply include a greater ‘diversity of perspectives’ as a means to delay and offset demands for radical systemic change.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Decolonising Design, A Statement on the Design Research Society Conference 2016|url=http://www.decolonisingdesign.com/statements/2016/drs2016statement/#more-1|website=Decolonising Design|accessdate=November 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the purpose of transforming the agenda of design studies and design research, the group organized a symposium on decolonization titled “Intersectional Perspectives on Design, Politics &amp; Power” which was held at the School of Arts and Communication, Malmö University, Sweden on 14–15 November 2016. For these [relatively] young academics, the field of design studies is not “geared towards delivering the kinds of knowledge and understanding that are adequate to addressing the systemic problems that arise from the coloniality of power.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Editorial Statement|url=http://www.decolonisingdesign.com/statements/2016/editorial/#more-1|website=Decolonising Design|accessdate=November 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They argue that design history and design research tends to have the most influence from the triad of Western Europe, North America, and Japan.&lt;ref name="Design studies: a reader"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Turner|first1=Matthew|title=Design studies: a reader|date=2009|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford:|pages=20–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect tends to be in line with the notion that history is written by the victors and thus design history is written by the economically powerful.&lt;ref name="Design studies: a reader"/&gt; They point to concurrent histories outside of the western context. For instance, Hong Kong has a unique system of design that was established prior to the economic growth of the Pearl River delta which can be found in the continuities of design in product types and styles, manufacturing and printing companies, and families of artist-designers.&lt;ref name="Design studies: a reader"/&gt; Or in Cuba for instance, where the origins of design was influenced by the crisis of “modern movement ideology and the ideologies oh how to escape underdevelopment.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Design studies: a reader|date=2009|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1847882363|pages=25–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; These countries lie on the periphery of the westernized view of design history and design studies and in some instances may have suffered in their adaptation of European modernity. As such, [[Gui Bonsiepe]], a German designer, teacher, and writer, suggested that “Decolonization in all its manifestations, economic, technological and cultural, should be the goal of project activity in the periphery.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Design studies: a reader|date=2009|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1847882363|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The need for understanding design as a global and multicultural phenomenon is also argued by Jonathan M. Woodham, [[Victor Margolin]], and Anna Calvera in Denise Whitehouse’s collection of essays.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite book|title=Design studies: a reader|date=2009|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1847882363|pages=54–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together their aim is to “create a theoretical narrative that brings intellectual logic to the multiple stories of how different countries… have negotiated the process of Westernization and the idea of design according to their specific economic, geographical, political, and cultural circumstances.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

As Whitehouse points out, “While many countries produce local histories of design, the output is uneven and often driven by nationalist and trade agendas.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Academic groups like the Japanese [http://www.designhistoryforum.org/ Design History Forum] and [http://www.ub.edu/icdhs/ The International Committee for Design History and Studies (ICDHS)] draw together both western and non-western, post-communist, postcolonial, Asian, and Southern Hemisphere, “to remap the scope and narrative concerns of design history.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

== Approaches and Scope ==
Design Studies thinks ambitiously about design, beyond its professional enclaves, and studies the significance and consequences of design activity in the modern world. It looks at design as a complex and multifarious activity and examines the forces that design exerts in, and on, the world—forces design sets in motion but does not control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yelavich|first1=Susan|title=What Is/Are Design Studies?|url=http://adht.parsons.edu/designstudies/what-is-are-design-studies/|website=|accessdate=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field of Design Studies views design as both the embodiment of the imminent future (by virtue of behaviors it triggers and resources it depletes) and as a means of envisioning alternative futures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yelavich|first1=Susan|title=What Is/Are Design Studies?|url=http://adht.parsons.edu/designstudies/what-is-are-design-studies/|accessdate=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because Design Studies is interdisciplinary (moving between disciplines), multi-disciplinary (utilizing multiple disciplines in its process and methods) and transdisciplinary (combining disciplines in creating new disciplinary structures),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=NC State|title=What is Design Studies, Anyway?|url=https://design.ncsu.edu/design-studies/|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  its approaches and scopes are not constrained by any boundaries of academic disciplines. It is promiscuous and draws on the knowledge of philosophy, sociology, anthropology, literature, cultural theory, politics and the sciences to ask questions of what is design, and how can we comprehend its acting in the world by analyzing its possibilities and limits.

As an organized field of study, Design Studies is substantiated by its own academic and professional discourse and theoretical perspectives concerning the ways we think about design—its nature, purpose, agency, configuration, engagement, deployment, place, responsibilities, ethics, politics, problems, environment, sustainment, potentialities and alternative futures. It focuses on describing the why, the how and the what of design. It does not limit its inquiry to prescriptive definitions of what design is supposed to be, but instead it aims to understand (and study) the possibilities of what design can achieve and uses varied methodologies to explore the delineations and synergies between academic inquiry, critical theory and design practice. Its scholars explore the coherent structures and intellectual parameters of how design is encountered in the world, as well as analyze which different modes of contemporary practice are rethinking design to propose and realize alternative futures.

== Subject(s) of Design Studies ==
As an organized field of study, Design Studies is a discipline concerned with design as a practice and as an intervention in the world. It is substantiated by its own academic and professional discourses and theoretical perspectives concerning ways to think about design—its nature, purpose, agency, configuration, engagement, deployment, place, responsibilities, ethics, politics, problems, environment, sustainment, potentialities and alternative futures. It does not limit its inquiry to prescriptive definitions of what design is supposed to be, but instead it aims to understand (and study) the possibilities of what design can achieve by using various methodologies to analyze the delineations and synergies between academic inquiry, design practice and critical theory.

Design Studies analyzes how different modes of contemporary practice are rethinking design to propose and realize alternative futures using approaches such as those conventions listed under [[design]] as well as:
* [[Aesthetics]]: Aesthetics in design refers to the visual attractiveness, in the context of beauty and taste, of a product. Studies have proven that creating good aesthetics in a product lead to better usability and user experience.

== Issues and Concepts in Design Studies ==
Design Studies asks us to think about the meaning of design. It studies the influence of designers and the effects design has on citizens and the environment.&lt;ref name="Design studies : a reader"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/268792485|title=Design studies : a reader|date=2009|publisher=Berg|others=Clark, Hazel., Brody, David Eric.|isbn=9781847882363|edition=English|location=Oxford|oclc=268792485}}&lt;/ref&gt; Victor Margolin distinguishes a degree in Design from a degree in Design Studies by saying that “the former is about producing design, while the latter is about reflecting on design as it has been practiced, is currently practiced, and how it might be practiced.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.drs2016.org/009/|title=Design Research: What is it? What is it for?|website=DRS2016|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Design Studies urges to rethink design as a process, as a practice, and as a generator or products and systems that gives lives meaning and sustains our economic and political systems. Design thinking invites to explore the complexities inherent to the task of thinking about design.&lt;ref name="Design studies : a reader"/&gt; Design Studies is concerned with the relationship between design and gender, design and race, and design and culture. It studies issues such as ethics, sustainment (social and environmental) and works with concepts such as agency and the artificial.

=== Issues ===

==== Ethics ====
Design has the capacity of structuring life in certain ways and thus design should result in the greater good for individuals and society but it doesn’t always do so. Ethics deals with how our actions affect others. Design Studies sees ethics as central to design. Tony Fry, a leading figure in Design Studies claims, “Design is quintessentially an ethical process but despite this recognition that ethics is integral to design in many ways, design ethics remains ‘massively underdeveloped and even in its crudest forms remains marginal within design education.” It is important to involve ethics in the design process, especially as the world we inhabit is increasingly becoming artificial.&lt;ref name="Design studies : a reader"/&gt;

Clive Dilnot’s essay, [https://www.amazon.com/Design-Studies-Reader-Hazel-Clark/dp/1847882366 ''Ethics in Design –'' ''Ten Questions'']'','' explores why we need ethics in design, what is the relationship between design and ethics. Dilnot writes that ethics should as a responsibility, as the ability of the designer to address the public as citizens and not as consumers or as the infusing of “humane intelligence” into the made environment, assume the possibility of truly human – humane, sustainable ways or making and remaking the world.&lt;ref name="Design studies : a reader"/&gt;

==== Sustainment: Environmental and Social ====

=== Concepts ===
==== The Artificial ====
Clive Dilnot goes further and clarifies that the artificial is by no means confined to technology. Today, it is combination of technical systems, the symbolic realm, including mind and the realm of our transformations and transmutations of nature. He gives the example of a [[genetically modified tomato]] that is neither purely natural nor purely artificial. It belongs rather to the extended realms of living things that are, as human beings ourselves are, a hybrid between these conditions – Neither nature nor the artificial nor the human are today pure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/858895940|title=Design as future-making|others=Yelavich, Susan,|isbn=9780857858399|location=London|oclc=858895940}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Design Studies scholars also reference sociologist [[Bruno Latour]] when investigating the dynamics of the artificial. Latour's concept of [[Actor–network theory|Actor-Network Theory]] (ANT) portrays the social as an interdependent network of human individual actors and actants, which are non-human, non-individual entities. ANT aims at accounting for the very essence of societies and natures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Latour|first=Bruno|date=1996|title=On actor-network theory: A few clarifications|jstor=40878163|journal=Soziale Welt|volume=47|issue=4|pages=369–381|doi=10.2307/40878163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Agency ====
Design plays a constitutive role in everyday life. We engage design with all of our senses – The things we see and read, the objects we use, and the places we inhabit are all designed. These products (all artificial because they are catalyzed by people) constitute an increasingly large part of the world. The built environment is the physical infrastructure that enables behavior, activity, routines, habits, and rituals, which affect our agency. Jamer Hunt defines the built environment as the combination of all design work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/51931174|title=Strangely familiar : design and everyday life|date=2003|publisher=Walker Art Center|others=Blauvelt, Andrew, 1964-, Walker Art Center., Carnegie Museum of Art., Musée de l'Hospice Comtesse.|isbn=9780935640755|edition=1st|location=Minneapolis, Minn.|oclc=51931174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research Methods  ==
=== Design Ethnography  ===

This form of research requires the scholar to partake in the use of, or observe others use, a designed object or system. Design-based Ethnography has become a common tool where design is observed as a social practice. It describes a process in which a researcher will partake in traditional observant style ethnography, and observe potential users complete activities that can inform design opportunities and solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://designobserver.com/article.php?id=5467|title=Design's Ethnographic Turn|work=Design Observer|access-date=2017-11-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other ethnographic techniques used by Design Studies scholars would fall more in line with anthropologists usage of the method. These techniques are observant and [[Participant observation|participant ethnography]]. The observant style requires the scholar to observe in an unobtrusive manner. Observations are recorded and further analyzed. The participant style requires the scholar to partake in the activities with their subject. This tactic enables the scholar to record what they see, but also what they themselves experience.

=== Actor-Network Theory  ===

While it remains a broader theory or concept Actor-Network theory can be used by Design Studies scholars as a research framework. When using this method, scholars will assess a designed object and consider the physical and nonphysical interactions which revolve around the object. The scholar will analyze what the object’s impact is on psychological, societal, economical, and political worlds. This widened viewpoint allows the researcher to explore and map out the objects many interactions, identify its role within the network, and in what ways it is connected to stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;Callon M. (1986) The Sociology of an Actor-Network: The Case of the Electric Vehicle. In: Callon M., Law J., Rip A. (eds) Mapping the Dynamics of Science and Technology. Palgrave Macmillan, London&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Semiotics, Rhetorical Analysis, and Discourse Theory  ===

Design Studies scholars may also analyze or research a designed object or system by studying it in terms of images and their various meanings. Based in [[representation (arts)|representation]] and meaning-making, semiotics as pertinent design as an act of communication between the designer, the thing, and the user or users. This concept branches out into a rhetorical analysis of the designed thing. Scholars such as [[Richard Buchanan (academic)|Richard Buchanan]], argue that design can be studied in such a way due to the existence of a design argument.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buchanan|first=Richard|date=1985|title=Declaration by Design: Rhetoric, Argument, and Demonstration in Design Practice|url=|journal=Design Issues|volume=2|pages=4–22|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The design argument is made up by the designer, the user, and the applicability to “practical life.”&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  The scholar would pull these segments apart and thoroughly analyze each component and their interactions. Finally, [[discourse analysis]] or a [[Foucauldian discourse analysis]] can be adopted by the Design Studies scholar to further explore the above components. A Foucauldian approach specifically will analyze the power structures put in place, manipulated by, or used within a designed thing or object. This process can be particularly useful when the scholar intends to understand if the designed thing has agency or enables others to have agency.

A '''dome''' (from [[Latin]]: ''domus'') is an architectural element that resembles the hollow upper half of a [[sphere]]. The precise definition has been a matter of controversy. There are also a wide variety of forms and specialized terms to describe them. A dome can rest upon a [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] or [[Tholobate|drum]], and can be supported by [[column]]s or [[Pier (architecture)|piers]] that transition to the dome through [[squinch]]es or [[pendentive]]s. A [[Roof lantern|lantern]] may cover an [[oculus]] and may itself have [[Cupola|another dome]].

Domes have a long architectural lineage that extends back into [[prehistory]] and they have been constructed from mud, snow, stone, wood, brick, concrete, metal, glass, and plastic over the centuries. The symbolism associated with domes includes [[Funerary art|mortuary]], [[Celestial sphere|celestial]], and governmental traditions that have likewise developed over time.

Domes have been found from early [[Mesopotamia]], which may explain the form's spread. They are found in Persian, [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]], Roman, and Chinese architecture in the [[Ancient history|Ancient world]], as well as among a number of contemporary [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] building traditions. Dome structures were popular in [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] and medieval [[Islamic architecture]], and there are numerous examples from Western Europe in the [[Middle Ages]]. The [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] architectural style spread from Italy in the [[Early modern period]]. Advancements in mathematics, materials, and production techniques since that time resulted in new dome types. The domes of the modern world can be found over religious buildings, legislative chambers, sports stadiums, and a variety of functional structures.

== Etymology ==
The English word "dome" ultimately derives from the Latin ''domus'' ("house") from ancient Greek δόμος (dómos), which, up through the Renaissance, labeled a revered house, such as a ''Domus Dei'', or "House of God", regardless of the shape of its roof. This is reflected in the uses of the Italian word ''duomo'', the German/Icelandic/Danish word ''dom'' ("cathedral"), and the English word ''dome'' as late as 1656, when it meant a "Town-House, Guild-Hall, State-House, and Meeting-House in a city." The French word ''dosme'' came to acquire the meaning of a [[cupola]] vault, specifically, by 1660. This French definition gradually became the standard usage of the English ''dome'' in the eighteenth century as many of the most impressive Houses of God were built with monumental domes, and in response to the scientific need for more technical terms.{{sfn|Smith|1950|p=5}}

== Terminology ==
[[File:Arc truefalserp.jpg|thumb|right|Comparison of a generic "true" arch (left) and a corbel arch (right)]]
A dome is a rounded vault made of either curved segments or a [[Surface of revolution|shell of revolution]], meaning an [[arch]] rotated around its central vertical axis.{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=301}} The terminology used has been a source of controversy, with inconsistency between scholars and even within individual texts, but the term "dome" may be considered a "blanket-word to describe an hemispherical or similar spanning element."{{sfn|Dodge|1984|p=265-266}} A half-dome or [[semi-dome]] is a semi-circular shape often used, especially in [[apse]]s.

Sometimes called "false" domes, [[Corbel arch|corbel]] domes achieve their shape by extending each horizontal layer of stones inward slightly farther than the lower one until they meet at the top.{{sfn|Huerta|2007|p=212}} A "false" dome may also refer to a wooden dome.{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=302}} "True" domes are said to be those whose structure is in a state of compression, with constituent elements of wedge-shaped [[voussoir]]s, the joints of which align with a central point. The validity of this is unclear, as domes built underground with corbelled stone layers are also in compression from the surrounding earth.{{sfn|Wright|2009|p=179-180, 188}} The Italian use of the term ''finto'', meaning "false", can be traced back to the 17th century in the use of vaulting made of reed mats and gypsum mortar.{{sfn|Nobile|Bares|2015|p=4}}

As with arches, the "springing" of a dome is the level from which the dome rises. The top of a dome is the "crown". The inner side of a dome is called the "intrados" and the outer side is called the "extrados".{{sfn|Dumser|2010|p=436}} The "haunch" is the part of an arch that lies roughly halfway between the base and the top.{{sfn|Fleming|Honour|Pevsner|1991|p=203}}

The word "[[cupola]]" is another word for "dome", and is usually used for a small dome upon a roof or [[turret]].{{sfn|Fleming|Honour|Pevsner|1991|p=114}} "Cupola" has also been used to describe the inner side of a dome.{{sfn|Technical|1872|p=252}}

Drums, also called [[tholobate]]s, are cylindrical or polygonal walls with or without windows that support a dome. A [[tambour]] or [[Roof lantern|lantern]] is the equivalent structure over a dome's oculus, supporting a [[cupola]].{{sfn|Ching|2011|p=63}}

== Characteristics ==

=== Internal forces ===
A masonry dome produces [[thrust]]s down and outward. They are thought of in terms of two kinds of forces at right angles from one another. Meridional forces (like the [[Meridian (geography)|meridians]], or lines of longitude, on a globe) are [[Compression (physics)|compressive]] only, and increase towards the base, while hoop forces (like the lines of [[latitude]] on a globe) are in compression at the top and [[Tension (physics)|tension]] at the base, with the transition in a hemispherical dome occurring at an angle of 51.8 degrees from the top.{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=242}} The thrusts generated by a dome are directly proportional to the weight of its materials.{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=301}} Grounded hemispherical domes generate significant horizontal thrusts at their haunches.{{sfn|Robison|1991|p=395}}

Unlike voussoir arches, which require support for each element until the [[Keystone (architecture)|keystone]] is in place, domes are stable during construction as each level is made a complete and self-supporting ring.{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=302}} The upper portion of a masonry dome is always in compression and is supported laterally, so it does not collapse except as a whole unit and a range of deviations from the ideal in this shallow upper cap are equally stable.{{sfn|Gye|1988|p=141-142}} Because voussoir domes have lateral support, they can be made much thinner than corresponding arches of the same span. For example, a hemispherical dome can be 2.5 times thinner than a semicircular arch, and a dome with the profile of an [[Gothic architecture#Equilateral arch|equilateral arch]] can be thinner still.{{sfn|Fernández|Hernández-Ros|1989}}

The optimal shape for a masonry dome of equal thickness provides for perfect compression, with none of the tension or bending forces against which masonry is weak.{{sfn|Robison|1991|p=395}} For a particular material, the optimal dome geometry is called the funicular surface, the comparable shape in three dimensions to a [[catenary]] curve for a two-dimensional arch.{{sfn|Rovero|Tonietti|2012|p=183}}{{sfn|Blockley|2014|p=22}} The pointed profiles of many Gothic domes more closely approximate this optimal shape than do hemispheres, which were favored by Roman and Byzantine architects due to the circle being considered the most perfect of forms. Adding a weight to the top of the pointed dome, such as the heavy cupola at the top of [[Florence Cathedral]], changes the optimal shape to perfectly match the actual pointed shape of the dome.{{sfn|Larson|Tyas|2003|p=32, 38}}

The outward thrusts in the lower portion of a hemispherical masonry dome can be counteracted with the use of chains incorporated around the circumference or with external buttressing, although cracking along the meridians is natural.{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=242}} For small or tall domes with less horizontal thrust, the thickness of the supporting arches or walls can be enough to resist deformation, which is why drums tend to be much thicker than the domes they support.{{sfn|Gye|1988|p=142}}

=== Zone of transition ===
[[File:Pendentive and Dome.png|thumb|right|A compound dome (red) with pendentives (yellow) from a sphere of greater radius than the dome.]]
[[File:مسجد_سالن_اجلاس_بین_المللی_اصفهان.jpg|thumb|An example of quadrangular to circle transition – The mosque of [[Isfahan]] international conference center]]
When the base of the dome does not match the plan of the supporting walls beneath it (for example, a dome's circular base over a square [[Bay (architecture)|bay]]), techniques are employed to bridge the two.{{sfn|Fleming|Honour|Pevsner|1991|p=127}} One technique is to use corbelling, progressively projecting horizontal layers from the top of the supporting wall to the base of the dome, such as the corbelled triangles often used in Seljuk and Ottoman architecture.{{sfn|Arun|2006|pp=304-305}} The simplest technique is to use diagonal [[Lintel (architecture)|lintels]] across the corners of the walls to create an [[octagon]]al base. Another is to use arches to span the corners, which can support more weight.{{sfn|Nuttgens|1997|p=123}} A variety of these techniques use what are called "[[squinch]]es".{{sfn|Ward|1915|p=2}} A squinch can be a single arch or a set of multiple projecting nested arches placed diagonally over an internal corner.{{sfn|Fleming|Honour|Pevsner|1991|p=127, 419}} Squinches can take a variety of other forms, as well, including trumpet arches and [[Niche (architecture)|niche]] heads, or half-domes.{{sfn|Ward|1915|p=2}}

The invention of [[pendentives]] superseded the squinch technique.{{sfn|Nuttgens|1997|p=123}} Pendentives are triangular sections of a sphere, like concave [[spandrel]]s between arches, and transition from the corners of a square bay to the circular base of a dome. The curvature of the pendentives is that of a sphere with a diameter equal to the diagonal of the square bay.{{sfn|Fleming|Honour|Pevsner|1991|p=127, 329}} The precise definition of "pendentive" has been a source of contention among academics, including whether or not corbelling is permitted under the definition and whether or not the lower portions of a sail vault should be considered pendentives.{{sfn|Dodge|1984|p=271-276, 279}}

Domes with pendentives can be divided into two kinds: ''simple'' and ''compound''.{{sfn|Catholic}} In the case of the ''simple dome'', the pendentives are part of the same sphere as the dome itself; however, such domes are rare.{{sfn|Fletcher|p=}} In the case of the more common ''compound dome'', the pendentives are part of the surface of a larger sphere below that of the dome itself and form a circular base for either the dome or a drum section.{{sfn|Catholic}}

=== Acoustics ===
Because domes are concave from below, they can reflect sound and create echoes.{{sfn|Kayili|p=9}} A dome may have a "[[whispering gallery]]" at its base that at certain places transmits distinct sound to other distant places in the gallery.{{sfn|Ching|2011|p=63}} The half-domes over the apses of Byzantine churches helped to project the [[chant]]s of the clergy.{{sfn|Ousterhout|2008a|p=13}} Although this can complement music, it may make speech less intelligible, leading [[Francesco Giorgi]] in 1535 to recommend vaulted ceilings for the choir areas of a church, but a flat ceiling filled with as many coffers as possible for where preaching would occur.{{sfn|Baumann|Haggh|1990|p=208-209}}

Cavities in the form of jars built into the inner surface of a dome may serve to compensate for this interference by diffusing sound in all directions, eliminating echoes while creating a "divine effect in the atmosphere of worship." This technique was written about by [[Vitruvius]] in his [[De architectura|''Ten Books on Architecture'']], which describes bronze and earthenware resonators.{{sfn|Kayili|p=9}} The material, shape, contents, and placement of these [[Resonator|cavity resonators]] determine the effect they have: reinforcing certain frequencies or absorbing them.{{sfn|Baumann|Haggh|1990|p=202}}

=== Materials ===
The earliest domes in the Middle East were built with mud-brick and, eventually, with baked brick and stone. Domes of wood allowed for wide spans due to the relatively light and flexible nature of the material and were the normal method for domed churches by the 7th century, although most domes were built with the other less flexible materials. Wooden domes were protected from the weather by roofing, such as copper or lead sheeting.{{sfn|Peterson|1996|p=68}} Domes of cut stone were more expensive and never as large, and timber was used for large spans where brick was unavailable.{{sfn|Mainstone|2001|p=121}}

Roman concrete used an aggregate of stone with a powerful mortar. The aggregate transitioned over the centuries to pieces of fired clay, then to Roman bricks. By the sixth century, bricks with large amounts of mortar were the principle vaulting materials. [[Pozzolana]] appears to have only been used in central Italy.{{sfn|MacDonald|1958|p=2-3, 7}} Brick domes were the favored choice for large-space monumental coverings until the [[Industrial Age]], due to their convenience and dependability.{{sfn|Kuban|1987|p=73}} [[Tie (engineering)|Ties]] and chains of iron or wood could be used to resist stresses.{{sfn|Giustina|2003|p=1037}}

The new building materials of the 19th century and a better understanding of the forces within structures from the 20th century has opened up new possibilities. Iron and steel beams, steel cables, and pre-stressed concrete have eliminated the need for external buttressing and enabled far thinner domes. Whereas earlier masonry domes may have had a radius to thickness ratio of 50, the ratio for modern domes can be in excess of 800. The lighter weight of these domes has not only permitted far greater spans, but also allowed for the creation of large movable domes over modern sports stadiums.{{sfn|Denny|2010|p=139}}

Experimental rammed earth domes were made as part of work on [[sustainable architecture]] at the [[University of Kassel]] in 1983.{{sfn|Minke|2012|p=57-59, 127}}

=== Symbolism ===
{{Main|Symbolism of domes}}
According to E. Baldwin Smith, from the [[Later Stone Age|late Stone Age]] the dome-shaped tomb was used as a reproduction of the ancestral, god-given shelter made permanent as a venerated home of the dead. The instinctive desire to do this resulted in widespread domical mortuary traditions across the ancient world, from the [[stupa]]s of [[India]] to the [[Beehive tomb|tholos tombs]] of [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]]. By Hellenistic and Roman times, the domical tholos had become the customary cemetery symbol.{{sfn|Smith|1950|p=51-53}}

Domes and tent-canopies were also associated with the heavens in Ancient Persia and the Hellenistic-Roman world. A dome over a square base reflected the geometric symbolism of those shapes. The circle represented perfection, eternity, and the heavens. The square represented the earth. An octagon was intermediate between the two.{{sfn|Grupico|2011|p=3, 8}} The distinct symbolism of the heavenly or cosmic tent stemming from the royal audience tents of [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] and Indian rulers was adopted by Roman rulers in imitation of [[Alexander the Great]], becoming the imperial [[baldachin]]. This probably began with [[Nero]], whose "[[Domus Aurea|Golden House]]" also made the dome an essential feature of palace architecture.{{sfn|Smith|1950|p=53}}

The dual sepulchral and heavenly symbolism was adopted by [[Early Christianity|early Christians]] in both the use of domes in architecture and in the [[Ciborium (architecture)|ciborium]], a domical canopy like the baldachin used as a ritual covering for relics or the [[Altar#Christianity|church altar]]. The celestial symbolism of the dome, however, was the preeminent one by the [[Christian era]].{{sfn|Smith|1950|p=53-56, 79}} In the early centuries of Islam, domes were closely associated with royalty. A dome built in front of the mihrab of a mosque, for example, was at least initially meant to emphasize the place of a prince during royal ceremonies. Over time such domes became primarily focal points for decoration or the direction of prayer. The use of domes in mausoleums can likewise reflect royal patronage or be seen as representing the honor and prestige that domes symbolized, rather than having any specific funerary meaning.{{sfn|Grabar|1963|p=195, 197}} The wide variety of dome forms in medieval Islam reflected dynastic, religious, and social differences as much as practical building considerations.{{sfn|Peterson|1996|p=68}}

== General types ==

=== Beehive dome ===
{{see also|Beehive tomb}}

Also called a ''corbelled dome'',{{sfn|Höcker|2000|p=181, 183}} or ''false dome'',{{sfn|Dror|2011|p=163}} these are different from a 'true dome' in that they consist of purely horizontal layers. As the layers get higher, each is slightly [[cantilever]]ed, or [[corbel]]ed, toward the center until meeting at the top. A monumental example is the Mycenaean [[Treasury of Atreus]] from the late [[Bronze Age]].{{sfn|Wright|2009|p=188}}

=== Braced dome ===

A single or double layer [[space frame]] in the form of a dome,{{sfn|Makowski|1962|p=62}} a ''braced dome'' is a generic term that includes ''ribbed'',{{sfn|Chen|Lui|2005|p=24-18}} ''[[Johann Wilhelm Schwedler#Schwedler cupola|Schwedler]]'',{{sfn|Chen|Lui|2005|p=24-18}}  ''three-way grid'',{{sfn|Chen|Lui|2005|p=24-18}}  ''lamella'' or ''Kiewitt'',{{sfn|Chen|Lui|2005|p=24-18, 24-19}}  ''lattice'',{{sfn|Ramaswamy|Eekhout|2002|p=141}} and ''[[Geodesic dome|geodesic]] domes''.{{sfn|Chen|Lui|2005|p=24-2, 24-18}} The different terms reflect different arrangements in the surface members. Braced domes often have a very low weight and are usually used to cover spans of up to 150 meters.{{sfn|Saka|2007|p=595}} Often prefabricated, their component members can either lie on the dome's surface of revolution, or be straight lengths with the connecting points or nodes lying upon the surface of revolution. Single-layer structures are called ''frame'' or ''skeleton'' types and double-layer structures are ''truss'' types, which are used for large spans. When the covering also forms part of the structural system, it is called a ''stressed skin'' type. The ''formed surface'' type consists of sheets joined together at bent edges to form the structure.{{sfn|Makowski|1962|p=62}}

=== Cloister vault ===
{{Main|Cloister vault}}

Called ''domical vaults'' (a term sometimes also applied to sail vaults)&lt;!-- this is an inconsistency in the sources, which is acknowledged by Dodge, 1984, page 273--&gt;,{{sfn|Moffett|Fazio|Wodehouse|2003|p=}}{{sfn|Dodge|1984|p=273}} ''polygonal domes'',{{sfn|Newman|Pevnser|1972|p=527}} ''coved domes'',{{sfn|Dien|2007|p=80}} ''gored domes'',{{sfn|Ward|1915|p=9}} ''segmental domes''{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=303}} (a term sometimes also used for saucer domes), ''paneled vaults'',{{sfn|Dodge|1984|p=268}} or ''pavilion vaults'',{{sfn|Sear|1983|p=79}} these are domes that maintain a polygonal shape in their horizontal cross section. The earliest known examples date to the first century BC, such as the [[Tabularium]] of Rome from 78 BC. Others include the Baths of Antoninus in [[Carthage]] (145–160) and the [[Palatine Chapel, Aachen|Palatine Chapel at Aachen]] (13th – 14th century).{{sfn|Como|2013|p=320}} The most famous example is the Renaissance octagonal dome of Filippo Brunelleschi over the Florence Cathedral. [[Thomas Jefferson]], the third president of the United States, installed an octagonal dome above the West front of his plantation house, [[Monticello]].{{sfn|Kern}}

=== Compound dome ===

Also called ''domes on pendentives''{{sfn|Karydis|2012|p=362-363}} or ''pendentive domes''{{sfn|Hassan|Mazloomi|2010|p=105}} (a term also applied to sail vaults), compound domes have pendentives that support a smaller diameter dome immediately above them, as in the Hagia Sophia, or a drum and dome, as in many Renaissance and post-Renaissance domes, with both forms resulting in greater height.{{sfn|Catholic}}

=== Crossed-arch dome ===

One of the earliest types of ribbed vault, the first known examples are found in the [[Mosque–Cathedral of Córdoba|Great Mosque of Córdoba]] in the 10th century. Rather than meeting in the center of the dome, the ribs characteristically intersect one another off-center, forming an empty polygonal space in the center. Geometry is a key element of the designs, with the octagon being perhaps the most popular shape used. Whether the arches are structural or purely decorative remains a matter of debate. The type may have an eastern origin, although the issue is also unsettled. Examples are found in Spain, North Africa, Armenia, Iran, France, and Italy.{{sfn|Fuentes|Huerta|2010|p=346-352}}

=== Ellipsoidal dome ===

The ''[[Ellipsoid|ellipsoidal]] dome'' is a surface formed by the rotation around a vertical axis of a [[Ellipse|semi-ellipse]]. Like other "rotational domes" formed by the rotation of a curve around a vertical axis, ellipsoidal domes have circular bases and horizontal sections and are a type of "circular dome" for that reason.{{sfn|Arun|2006|p=304}}

=== Geodesic dome ===

{{Main|Geodesic dome}}
''Geodesic domes'' are the upper portion of geodesic spheres. They are composed of a framework of triangles in a [[polyhedron]] pattern.{{sfn|Langmead|Garnaut|2001|p=131}} The structures are named for [[geodesic]]s and are based upon geometric shapes such as [[icosahedron]]s, [[octahedron]]s or [[tetrahedron]]s.{{sfn|Langmead|Garnaut|2001|p=131}}{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=302}} Such domes can be created using a limited number of simple elements and joints and efficiently resolve a dome's internal forces. Their efficiency is said to increase with size.{{sfn|Ambrose|Tripeny|2011|p=36}} Although not first invented by [[Buckminster Fuller]], they are associated with him because he designed many geodesic domes and patented them in the United States.{{sfn|Denny|2010|p=140}}

=== Hemispherical dome ===

The ''hemispherical dome'' is a surface formed by the rotation around a vertical axis of a [[semicircle]]. Like other "rotational domes" formed by the rotation of a curve around a vertical axis, hemispherical domes have circular bases and horizontal sections and are a type of "circular dome" for that reason. They experience vertical compression along their meridians, but horizontally experience compression only in the portion above 51.8 degrees from the top. Below this point, hemispherical domes experience tension horizontally, and usually require buttressing to counteract it.{{sfn|Arun|2006|p=304}} According to E. Baldwin Smith, it was a shape likely known to the Assyrians, defined by Greek theoretical mathematicians, and standardized by Roman builders.{{sfn|Smith|1950|p=8, 9}}

''Bulbous domes'' bulge out beyond their base diameters, offering a profile greater than a hemisphere.{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=302}} An ''onion dome'' is a greater than hemispherical dome with a pointed top in an [[ogee]] profile.{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=302}} They are found in the [[Near East]], [[Middle East]], Persia, and India and may not have had a single point of origin. Their appearance in northern Russian architecture predates the [[Mongol invasion of Rus'#The age of Tatar rule|Tatar occupation of Russia]] and so is not easily explained as the result of that influence.{{sfn|Hamilton|1983|p=42}} They became popular in the second half of the 15th century in the [[Low Countries]] of Northern Europe, possibly inspired by the finials of [[minaret]]s in Egypt and Syria, and developed in the 16th and 17th centuries in the Netherlands before spreading to Germany, becoming a popular element of the baroque architecture of Central Europe. German bulbous domes were also influenced by Russian and Eastern European domes.{{sfn|Born|1944|p=220-221}} The examples found in various European architectural styles are typically wooden.{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=302}} Examples include Kazan Church in [[Kolomenskoye]] and the [[Royal Pavilion|Brighton Pavilion]] by [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]].{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=302}} In Islamic architecture, they are typically made of masonry, rather than timber, with the thick and heavy bulging portion serving to buttress against the tendency of masonry domes to spread at their bases. The Taj Mahal is a famous example.{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=302}}

=== Oval dome ===

An ''oval dome'' is a dome of [[oval]] shape in plan, profile, or both. The term comes from the Latin ''ovum'', meaning "egg". The earliest oval domes were used by convenience in corbelled stone huts as rounded but geometrically undefined coverings, and the first examples in Asia Minor date to around 4000 B.C. The geometry was eventually defined using combinations of circular arcs, transitioning at points of tangency. If the Romans created oval domes, it was only in exceptional circumstances. The Roman foundations of the oval plan [[St. Gereon's Basilica, Cologne|Church of St. Gereon in Cologne]] point to a possible example. Domes in the Middle Ages also tended to be circular, though the church of [[Santo Tomás de las Ollas]] in Spain has an oval dome over its oval plan. Other examples of medieval oval domes can be found covering rectangular bays in churches. Oval plan churches became a type in the [[Renaissance]] and popular in the [[Baroque]] style.{{sfn|Huerta|2007|p=231}} The dome built for the basilica of [[Vicoforte]] by Francesco Gallo was one of the largest and most complex ever made.{{sfn|Bagliani|2009}} Although the ellipse was known, in practice, domes of this shape were created by combining segments of circles. Popular in the 16th and 17th centuries, oval and elliptical plan domes can vary their dimensions in three axes or two axes. {{sfn|Escrig|Cobreros|Valcarcel|1997|pp=355-356}} A sub-type with the long axis having a semicircular section is called a Murcia dome, as in the Chapel of the Junterones at [[Murcia Cathedral]]. When the short axis has a semicircular section, it is called a Melon dome.{{sfn|Escrig|Cobreros|Valcarcel|1997|p=358}}

=== Paraboloid dome ===
A ''[[paraboloid]] dome'' is a surface formed by the rotation around a vertical axis of a sector of a parabola. Like other "rotational domes" formed by the rotation of a curve around a vertical axis, paraboloid domes have circular bases and horizontal sections and are a type of "circular dome" for that reason. Because of their shape, paraboloid domes experience only compression, both radially and horizontally.{{sfn|Arun|2006|p=304}}

=== Sail dome ===

Also called ''sail vaults'',{{sfn|Fleming|Honour|Pevsner|1991|p=127, 463}} ''handkerchief vaults'',{{sfn|Fleming|Honour|Pevsner|1991|p=462}} ''domical vaults'' (a term sometimes also applied to cloister vaults)&lt;!-- this is an inconsistency in the sources, which is acknowledged by Dodge, 1984, page 273--&gt;,{{sfn|Dodge|1984|p=273}} ''pendentive domes''{{sfn|Dodge|1984|p=274}} (a term that has also been applied to compound domes), ''Bohemian vaults'',{{sfn|Burckhardt|1987|p=58}} or ''Byzantine domes'', this type can be thought of as [[pendentives]] that, rather than merely touching each other to form a circular base for a drum or compound dome, smoothly continue their curvature to form the dome itself. The dome gives the impression of a square sail pinned down at each corner and billowing upward.{{sfn|Fleming|Honour|Pevsner|1991|p=127}} These can also be thought of as saucer domes upon pendentives.{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=303}} Sail domes are based upon the shape of a hemisphere and are not to be confused with elliptic parabolic vaults, which appear similar but have different characteristics.{{sfn|Arun|2006|p=304}}

=== Saucer dome ===

Also called ''segmental domes''{{sfn|Dodge|1984|p=263}} (a term sometimes also used for cloister vaults), or ''calottes'',{{sfn|Fleming|Honour|Pevsner|1991|p=127}} these have profiles of [[Circular segment|less than half a circle]]. Because they reduce the portion of the dome in tension, these domes are strong but have increased radial thrust.{{sfn|Dodge|1984|p=263}} Many of the largest existing domes are of this shape.

Masonry saucer domes, because they exist entirely in compression, can be built much thinner than other dome shapes without becoming unstable. The trade-off between the proportionately increased horizontal thrust at their abutments and their decreased weight and quantity of materials may make them more economical, but they are more vulnerable to damage from movement in their supports.{{sfn|Gye|1988|p=142-143}}

=== Umbrella dome ===

Also called ''gadrooned'',{{sfn|Yaghan|2003|p=69}} ''fluted'',{{sfn|Yaghan|2003|p=69}} ''organ-piped'',{{sfn|Yaghan|2003|p=69}} ''pumpkin'',{{sfn|Fleming|Honour|Pevsner|1991|p=127}} ''melon'',{{sfn|Fleming|Honour|Pevsner|1991|p=127}} ''ribbed'',{{sfn|Yaghan|2003|p=69}} ''parachute'',{{sfn|Fleming|Honour|Pevsner|1991|p=127}} ''scalloped'',{{sfn|Krautheimer|1980|p=121, 132}} or ''lobed'' domes,{{sfn|Ward|1915|p=116-117}} these are a type of dome divided at the base into curved segments, which follow the curve of the [[Multiview orthographic projection#Elevation|elevation]].{{sfn|Fleming|Honour|Pevsner|1991|p=127}} "Fluted" may refer specifically to this pattern as an external feature, such as was common in [[Mamluk architecture|Mamluk Egypt]].{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=302}} The "ribs" of a dome are the radial lines of masonry that extend from the crown down to the springing.{{sfn|Dumser|2010|p=436}} The central dome of the [[Hagia Sophia]] uses the ribbed method, which accommodates a ring of windows between the ribs at the base of the dome. The central dome of [[St. Peter's Basilica]] also uses this method.

== History ==

=== Early history and simple domes ===
{{Main|History of early and simple domes}}
[[File:Apache Wickiup, Edward Curtis, 1903.jpg|thumb|left|Apache wigwam, by Edward S. Curtis, 1903]]
Cultures from [[Prehistory|pre-history]] to modern times constructed domed dwellings using local materials. Although it is not known when the first dome was created, sporadic examples of early domed structures have been discovered. The earliest discovered may be four small dwellings made of [[Mammoth]] tusks and bones. The first was found by a farmer in [[Mezhirich]], Ukraine, in 1965 while he was digging in his cellar and archaeologists unearthed three more.{{sfn|Hitchcock}} They date from 19,280 – 11,700 BC.{{sfn|Palmer|Pettitt|Bahn|2005|p=24}}

In [[Modern history|modern times]], the creation of relatively simple dome-like structures has been documented among various indigenous peoples around the world. The [[wigwam]] was made by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] using arched branches or poles covered with grass or hides. The [[Efé people]] of central Africa construct similar [[Hut (dwelling)|structures]], using leaves as shingles.{{sfn|Wilkie|Morelli|2000}} Another example is the [[igloo]], a shelter built from blocks of compact snow and used by the [[Inuit]] people, among others. The [[Himba people]] of [[Namibia]] construct "desert igloos" of [[wattle and daub]] for use as temporary shelters at seasonal cattle camps, and as permanent homes by the poor.{{sfn|Crandall|2000|p=34-35}} Extraordinarily thin [[Musgum mud huts|domes of sun-baked clay]] 20 feet in diameter, 30 feet high, and nearly parabolic in curve, are known from [[Cameroon]].{{sfn|Creswell|1915a|p=155}}

The historical development from structures like these to more sophisticated domes is not well documented. That the dome was known to early [[Mesopotamia]] may explain the existence of domes in both [[China]] and [[Western World|the West]] in the first millennium BC.{{sfn|Hill|1996|p=69}} Another explanation, however, is that the use of the dome shape in construction did not have a single point of origin and was common in virtually all cultures long before domes were constructed with enduring materials.{{sfn|Smith|1950|p=6}}

Corbelled stone domes have been found from the [[Neolithic|Neolithic period]] in the [[ancient Near East]], and in the Middle East to Western Europe from antiquity. {{sfn|Leick|2003|p=64}}{{sfn|Mainstone|2001|p=116}} The kings of [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid Persia]] held audiences and festivals in domical tents derived from the nomadic traditions of central Asia.{{sfn|Smith|1950|p=81-82}} Simple domical mausoleums existed in the Hellenistic period.{{sfn|Grabar|1963|p=194}} The remains of a large domed circular hall in the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] capital city of [[Nisa, Turkmenistan|Nyssa]] has been dated to perhaps the first century AD, showing "...the existence of a monumental domical tradition in Central Asia that had hitherto been unknown and which seems to have preceded Roman Imperial monuments or at least to have grown independently from them."{{sfn|Grabar|1963|p=192}} It likely had a wooden dome.{{sfn|Ashkan|Ahmad|2009|p=99}}

[[File:Sheikh Lotfallah Esfahan.JPG|thumb|right|Sheikh Lotfallah Mosque, [[Isfahan]], [[Iran]].]]
[[Iranian architecture|Persian architecture]] likely inherited an architectural tradition of dome-building dating back to the earliest Mesopotamian domes.{{sfn|Spiers|1911|p=957}} Due to the scarcity of wood in many areas of the [[Iranian plateau]], domes were an important part of [[vernacular architecture]] throughout Persian history.{{sfn|O'Kane|1995}} The Persian invention of the [[squinch]], a series of concentric arches forming a half-cone over the corner of a room, enabled the transition from the walls of a square chamber to an octagonal base for a dome in a way reliable enough for large constructions and domes moved to the forefront of Persian architecture as a result.{{sfn|Creswell|1915a|p=148}} Pre-Islamic domes in Persia are commonly semi-elliptical, with pointed domes and those with conical outer shells being the majority of the domes in the Islamic periods.{{sfn|Ashkan|Ahmad|2009|p=113}}

The area of north-eastern Iran was, along with Egypt, one of two areas notable for early developments in Islamic domed mausoleums, which appear in the tenth century.{{sfn|Grabar|1963|p=192-194}} The [[Samanid Mausoleum]] in [[Transoxiana]] dates to no later than 943 and is the first to have squinches create a regular octagon as a base for the dome, which then became the standard practice. Cylindrical or polygonal plan tower tombs with conical roofs over domes also exist beginning in the 11th century.{{sfn|O'Kane|1995}}

The [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq Turks]] built tower tombs, called "Turkish Triangles", as well as cube mausoleums covered with a variety of dome forms. Seljuk domes included conical, semi-circular, and pointed shapes in one or two shells. Shallow semi-circular domes are mainly found from the Seljuk era. The double-shell domes were either discontinuous or continuous.{{sfn|Ashkan|Ahmad|2009|p=102, 104, 105, 113}} The domed enclosure of the [[Jameh Mosque of Isfahan]], built in 1086-7 by [[Nizam al-Mulk]], was the largest masonry dome in the Islamic world at that time, had eight ribs, and introduced a new form of corner squinch with two quarter domes supporting a short barrel vault. In 1088 Tāj-al-Molk, a rival of Nizam al-Mulk, built another dome at the opposite end of the same mosque with interlacing ribs forming five-pointed stars and pentagons. This is considered the landmark Seljuk dome, and may have inspired subsequent patterning and the domes of the Il-Khanate period. The use of tile and of plain or painted plaster to decorate dome interiors, rather than brick, increased under the Seljuks.{{sfn|O'Kane|1995}}

Beginning in the [[Ilkhanate]], Persian domes achieved their final configuration of structural supports, zone of transition, drum, and shells, and subsequent evolution was restricted to variations in form and shell geometry. Characteristic of these domes are the use of high drums and several types of discontinuous double-shells, and the development of triple-shells and internal stiffeners occurred at this time. The construction of tomb towers decreased.{{sfn|Ashkan|Ahmad|2009|p=105, 110}} The 7.5 meter wide double dome of [[Soltan Bakht Agha Mausoleum]] (1351–1352) is the earliest known example in which the two shells of the dome have significantly different profiles, which spread rapidly throughout the region.{{sfn|Ashkan|Ahmad|2009|p=106}} The development of taller drums also continued into the Timurid period.{{sfn|O'Kane|1995}} The large, bulbous, fluted domes on tall drums that are characteristic of 15th century Timurid architecture were the culmination of the Central Asian and Iranian tradition of tall domes with glazed tile coverings in blue and other colors.{{sfn|Peterson|1996|p=68}}

The domes of the [[Safavid dynasty]] (1501–1732) are characterized by a distinctive bulbous profile and are considered the last generation of Persian domes. They are generally thinner than earlier domes and are decorated with a variety of colored glazed tiles and complex vegetal patterns, and they were influential on those of other Islamic styles, such as the Mughal architecture of India.{{sfn|Ashkan|Ahmad|2009|p=102, 108–109}} An exaggerated style of onion dome on a short drum, as can be seen at the [[Shah Cheragh]] (1852–1853), first appeared in the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar period]]. Domes have remained important in modern mausoleums, and domed [[Ab anbar|cisterns]] and [[Yakhchal|icehouses]] remain common sights in the countryside.{{sfn|O'Kane|1995}}

=== Chinese domes ===
[[File:Model of the Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb.jpg|thumb|left|Model of the [[Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb Museum|Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb]] (25 AD – 220 AD).]]
Very little has survived of ancient [[Chinese architecture]], due to the extensive use of timber as a building material. Brick and stone vaults used in tomb construction have survived, and the corbeled dome was used, rarely, in tombs and temples.{{sfn|Kuiper|2011|p=266-267}} The earliest true domes found in Chinese tombs were shallow cloister vaults, called ''simian jieding'', derived from the Han use of [[barrel vault]]ing. Unlike the cloister vaults of western Europe, the corners are rounded off as they rise.{{sfn|Dien|2007|p=79-80}}

A model of a tomb found with a shallow true dome from the late [[Han Dynasty]] (206 BC – 220 AD) can be seen at the Guangzhou Museum (Canton).{{sfn|Needham|Gwei-Djen|1962|p=167}} Another, the [[Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb Museum|Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb]], found in Hong Kong in 1955, has a design common among Eastern Han Dynasty (25 AD – 220 AD) tombs in South China: a barrel vaulted entrance leading to a domed front hall with barrel vaulted chambers branching from it in a cross shape. It is the only such tomb that has been found in Hong Kong and is exhibited as part of the [[Hong Kong Museum of History]].{{sfn|lcsd|2014}}{{sfn|Tsan-wing|Kin-wah|2001|p=294}}

During the [[Three Kingdoms]] period (220–280), the "cross-joint dome" (''siyuxuanjinshi'') was developed under the [[Eastern Wu|Wu]] and [[Jin Dynasty (265-420)|Western Jin]] dynasties south of the [[Yangtze River]], with arcs building out from the corners of a square room until they met and joined at the center. These domes were stronger, had a steeped angle, and could cover larger areas than the relatively shallow cloister vaults. Over time, they were made taller and wider. There were also corbel vaults, called ''diese'', although these are the weakest type.{{sfn|Dien|2007|p=79}} Some tombs of the [[Song Dynasty]] (960–1279) have beehive domes.{{sfn|Needham|Gwei-Djen|1962|p=167}}

[[File:Giovanni Paolo Panini - Interior of the Pantheon, Rome - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|Painting by [[Giovanni Paolo Pannini]] of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in Rome.]]
Roman domes are found in [[Thermae|baths]], villas, palaces, and tombs. [[Oculus|Oculi]] are common features.{{sfn|Lehmann|1945|p=247, 254–255}} They are customarily hemispherical in shape and partially or totally concealed on the exterior. To buttress the horizontal thrusts of a large hemispherical masonry dome, the supporting walls were built up beyond the base to at least the haunches of the dome, and the dome was then also sometimes covered with a conical or polygonal roof.{{sfn|Smith|1950|p=9}}

Domes reached monumental size in the Roman [[Roman Empire|Imperial period]].{{sfn|Lehmann|1945|p=249}} Roman baths played a leading role in the development of domed construction in general, and monumental domes in particular. Modest domes in baths dating from the 2nd and 1st centuries BC are seen in [[Pompeii]], in the [[Frigidarium|cold rooms]] of the Terme Stabiane and the Terme del Foro.{{sfn|Lehmann|1945|p=249}}{{sfn|Winter|2006|p=130}} However, the extensive use of domes did not occur before the 1st century AD.{{sfn|Lancaster|2005|p=49}} The growth of domed construction increases under [[Nero|Emperor Nero]] and [[Flavian dynasty|the Flavians]] in the 1st century AD, and during the 2nd century. Centrally-planned halls become increasingly important parts of palace and palace villa layouts beginning in the 1st century, serving as state banqueting halls, audience rooms, or throne rooms.{{sfn|Krautheimer|1986|p=77}} The [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], a temple in Rome completed by [[Hadrian|Emperor Hadrian]] as part of the [[Baths of Agrippa]], is the most famous, best preserved, and largest Roman dome.{{sfn|Lehmann|1945|p=255}} Segmented domes, made of radially concave wedges or of alternating concave and flat wedges, appear under Hadrian in the 2nd century and most preserved examples of this style date from this period.{{sfn|Lancaster|2005|p=46, 50}}

In the 3rd century, Imperial mausoleums began to be built as domed rotundas, rather than as [[tumulus]] structures or other types, following similar monuments by private citizens.{{sfn|Johnson|2009|p=}} The technique of building lightweight domes with interlocking hollow ceramic tubes further developed in North Africa and Italy in the late third and early fourth centuries.{{sfn|McClendon|2005|p=16}} In the 4th century, Roman domes proliferated due to changes in the way domes were constructed, including advances in [[Centring|centering]] techniques and the use of brick [[Rib vault|ribbing]].{{sfn|Lancaster|2005|p=161}} The material of choice in construction gradually transitioned during the 4th and 5th centuries from stone or concrete to lighter brick in thin shells.{{sfn|Krautheimer|1986|p=238}} Baptisteries began to be built in the manner of domed mausoleums during the 4th century in Italy. The octagonal [[Lateran Baptistery|Lateran baptistery]] or the baptistery of the Holy Sepulchre may have been the first, and the style spread during the 5th century.{{sfn|Smith|1950|p=56}} By the 5th century, structures with small-scale domed cross plans existed across the Christian world.{{sfn|Krautheimer|1986|p=239}}

With the end of the [[Western Roman Empire]], domes became a signature feature of the church architecture of the surviving [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman]] — or "Byzantine" — Empire.{{sfn|Spiers|1911|p=958}} 6th-century church building by the [[Justinian I|Emperor Justinian]] used the domed cross unit on a monumental scale, and his architects made the domed brick-vaulted central plan standard throughout the Roman east. This divergence with the Roman west from the second third of the 6th century may be considered the beginning of a "Byzantine" architecture.{{sfn|Krautheimer|1986|p=203, 242}} Justinian's [[Hagia Sophia]] was an original and innovative design with no known precedents in the way it covers a basilica plan with dome and semi-domes. Periodic earthquakes in the region have caused three partial collapses of the dome and necessitated repairs.{{sfn|Freely|Çakmak|2004|p=90-93, 95–96}}

"Cross-domed units", a more secure structural system created by bracing a dome on all four sides with broad arches, became a standard element on a smaller scale in later Byzantine church architecture.{{sfn|Ousterhout|2008b|p=358}}{{sfn|Ousterhout|2008a|p=202}} The [[Cross-in-square]] plan, with a single dome at the crossing or five domes in a quincunx pattern, became widely popular in the [[Middle byzantine art#Periods|Middle Byzantine period (c. 843–1204)]].{{sfn|Krautheimer|1986|p=340}}{{sfn|Darling|2004|p=xliii}}{{sfn|Ousterhout|2008b|p=358}} It is the most common church plan from the tenth century until the [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453.{{sfn|Rosser|2011|p=137}} Resting domes on circular or polygonal drums pierced with windows eventually became the standard style, with regional characteristics.{{sfn|Krautheimer|1986|p=379}}

In the Byzantine period, domes were normally hemispherical and had, with occasional exceptions, windowed drums. All of the surviving examples in Constantinople are ribbed or pumpkin domes, with the divisions corresponding to the number of windows. Roofing for domes ranged from simple ceramic tile to more expensive, more durable, and more form-fitting lead sheeting. Metal clamps between stone cornice blocks, metal tie rods, and metal chains were also used to stabilize domed construction.{{sfn|Ousterhout|2008a|p=214}} The technique of using double shells for domes, although revived in the Renaissance, originated in Byzantine practice.{{sfn|Wittkower|1963|p=185}}

=== Arabic and Western European domes ===
{{Main|History of Medieval Arabic and Western European domes}}
[[File:Dome of the Rock Temple Mount.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Dome of the Rock]] in [[Jerusalem]]]]
The Syria and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] area has a long tradition of domical architecture, including wooden domes in shapes described as "conoid", or similar to pine cones. When the [[Arab Muslims|Arab Muslim]] forces [[Muslim conquest of Syria|conquered the region]], they employed local craftsmen for their buildings and, by the end of the 7th&amp;nbsp;century, the dome had begun to become an architectural symbol of [[Islam]].{{sfn|Smith|1950|p=43}} In addition to religious shrines, such as the [[Dome of the Rock]], domes were used over the audience and throne halls of [[Umayyad]] palaces, and as part of porches, pavilions, fountains, towers and the [[caldarium|calderia]] of baths. Blending the architectural features of both Byzantine and Persian architecture, the domes used both pendentives and squinches and were made in a variety of shapes and materials.{{sfn|Arce|2006|p=209}} Although architecture in the region would decline following the movement of the capital to Iraq under the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]] in 750, mosques built after a revival in the late 11th century usually followed the Umayyad model.{{sfn|Bloom|Blair|2009|p=111-112}} Early versions of bulbous domes can be seen in mosaic illustrations in Syria dating to the Umayyad period. They were used to cover large buildings in Syria after the eleventh century.{{sfn|Born|1944|p=208}}

Italian church architecture from the late sixth century to the end of the eighth century was influenced less by the trends of Constantinople than by a variety of Byzantine provincial plans.{{sfn|Krautheimer|1986|p=402}} With the [[Charlemagne#Imperial coronation|crowning]] of [[Charlemagne]] as a [[Holy Roman Emperor|new Roman Emperor]], Byzantine influences were largely replaced in a revival of earlier Western building traditions. Occasional exceptions include examples of early quincunx churches at [[Milan]] and near [[Cassino]].{{sfn|Krautheimer|1986|p=402}} Another is the [[Palatine Chapel in Aachen|Palatine Chapel]]. Its domed octagon design was influenced by Byzantine models.{{sfn|Dupré|2001|p=5}}{{sfn|Bullough|1991|p=57, 89}} It was the largest dome north of the Alps at that time.{{sfn|Langmead|Garnaut|2001|p=60}} [[Venice]], [[Southern Italy]] and [[Sicily]] served as outposts of Middle Byzantine architectural influence in Italy.{{sfn|Krautheimer|1986|p=405}}

The [[Cathedral–Mosque of Córdoba|Great Mosque of Córdoba]] contains the first known examples of the crossed-arch dome type.{{sfn|Fuentes|Huerta|2010|p=346-347}} The use of corner squinches to support domes was widespread in Islamic architecture by the 10th and 11th centuries.{{sfn|Krautheimer|1986|p=340}} After the ninth century, mosques in North Africa often have a small decorative dome over the mihrab. Additional domes are sometimes used at the corners of the mihrab wall, at the entrance bay, or on the square tower minarets.{{sfn|Kuban|1985|p=2-4}} Egypt, along with north-eastern Iran, was one of two areas notable for early developments in Islamic mausoleums, beginning in the 10th century.{{sfn|Grabar|1963|p=194}} Fatimid mausoleums were mostly simple square buildings covered by a dome. Domes were smooth or ribbed and had a characteristic Fatimid "keel" shape profile.{{sfn|Kuiper|2011|p=165}}

Domes in [[Romanesque architecture]] are generally found within [[Crossing (architecture)|crossing tower]]s at the intersection of a church's [[nave]] and [[transept]], which conceal the domes externally.{{sfn|Stephenson|Hammond|Davi|2005|p=172}} They are typically octagonal in plan and use corner squinches to translate a square bay into a suitable octagonal base.{{sfn|Fletcher|p=}} They appear "in connection with basilicas almost throughout Europe" between 1050 and 1100.{{sfn|Porter|1928|p=48}} The [[Crusades]], beginning in 1095, also appear to have influenced domed architecture in Western Europe, particularly in the areas around the [[Mediterranean Sea]].{{sfn|Jeffery|2010|p=72}} The [[Knights Templar]], headquartered at the site, built a series of centrally planned churches throughout Europe modeled on the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, with the Dome of the Rock also an influence.{{sfn|Howard|1991|p=65, 67}} In southwest France, there are over 250 domed Romanesque churches in the [[Périgord]] region alone.{{sfn|Stewart|2008|p=202}} The use of pendentives to support domes in the [[Aquitaine]] region, rather than the squinches more typical of western medieval architecture, strongly implies a Byzantine influence.{{sfn|Moffett|Fazio|Wodehouse|2003|p=}} Gothic domes are uncommon due to the use of [[rib vault]]s over naves, and with church crossings usually focused instead by a tall [[steeple (architecture)|steeple]], but there are examples of small octagonal crossing domes in cathedrals as the style developed from the Romanesque.{{sfn|Stephenson|Hammond|Davi|2005|p=174}}

Star-shaped domes found at the [[Moors|Moorish]] palace of the [[Alhambra]] in Granada, Spain, the [[Alhambra#Hall of the Abencerrajes|Hall of the Abencerrajes]] (c. 1333–91) and the Hall of the two Sisters (c. 1333–54), are extraordinarily developed examples of [[muqarnas]] domes.{{sfn|Stephenson|Hammond|Davi|2005|p=174}} In the first half of the fourteenth century, stone blocks replaced bricks as the primary building material in the dome construction of [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Egypt]] and, over the course of 250 years, around 400 domes were built in Cairo to cover the tombs of Mamluk [[sultan]]s and [[emir]]s.{{sfn|Cipriani|Lau|2006|p=696, 698}} Dome profiles were varied, with "keel-shaped", bulbous, [[ogee]], stilted domes, and others being used. On the drum, angles were [[chamfer]]ed, or sometimes stepped, externally and triple windows were used in a tri-lobed arrangement on the faces.{{sfn|Hillenbrand|1994|p=318}} Bulbous cupolas on minarets were used in Egypt beginning around 1330, spreading to Syria in the following century.{{sfn|Born|1944|p=209}} In the fifteenth century, pilgrimages to and flourishing trade relations with the [[Near East]] exposed the [[Low Countries]] of northwest Europe to the use of bulbous domes in the architecture of the [[Orient]] and such domes apparently became associated with the city of Jerusalem. Multi-story spires with truncated bulbous cupolas supporting smaller cupolas or crowns became popular in the sixteenth century.{{sfn|Born|1944|p=209-213}}

=== Russian domes ===
[[File:Onion domes of Cathedral of the Annunciation.JPG|thumb|left|[[Gilding|Gilded]] onion domes of the [[Cathedral of the Annunciation, Moscow|Cathedral of the Annunciation]], [[Moscow Kremlin]].]]
[[File:RedSquare SaintBasile (pixinn.net).jpg|thumb|[[Saint Basil's Cathedral]] (1555–61) in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]]. Its distinctive [[onion dome]]s date to the 1680s.]]
The multidomed church is a typical form of Russian church architecture that distinguishes Russia from other Orthodox nations and Christian denominations. Indeed, the earliest Russian churches, built just after the [[Christianization of Kievan Rus']], were multi-domed, which has led some historians to speculate about how Russian pre-Christian pagan temples might have looked. Examples of these early churches are the 13-domed wooden [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod]] (989) and the 25-domed stone [[Desyatinnaya Church]] in [[Kiev]] (989–996). The number of domes typically has a symbolical meaning in [[Russian architecture]], for example 13 domes symbolize [[Christ]] with 12 [[Apostles]], while 25 domes means the same with an additional 12 Prophets of the [[Old Testament]]. The multiple domes of Russian churches were often comparatively smaller than [[Byzantine]] domes.{{sfn|Kies}}{{sfn|skypalace}}

The earliest stone churches in Russia featured Byzantine style domes, however by the [[Early Modern era]] the [[onion dome]] had become the predominant form in traditional [[Russian architecture]]. The [[onion dome]] is a dome whose shape resembles an [[onion]], after which they are named. Such domes are often larger in diameter than the [[drum (architecture)|drum]]s they sit on, and their height usually exceeds their width. The whole bulbous structure tapers smoothly to a point. Though the earliest preserved Russian domes of such type date from the 16th century, illustrations from older chronicles indicate they have existed since the late 13th century. Like [[tented roofs]]—which were combined with, and sometimes replaced domes in Russian architecture since the 16th century—onion domes initially were used only in wooden churches. Builders introduced them into stone architecture much later, and continued to make their carcasses of either of wood or metal on top of masonry drums.{{sfn|Zagraevsky}}

Russian domes are often [[gilding|gilded]] or brightly painted. A dangerous technique of chemical [[gilding]] using [[mercury (element)|mercury]] had been applied on some occasions until the mid-19th century, most notably in the giant dome of [[Saint Isaac's Cathedral]]. The more modern and safe method of [[gold]] [[electroplating]] was applied for the first time in gilding the domes of the [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]] in [[Moscow]], the [[List of tallest Orthodox churches|tallest Eastern Orthodox church]] in the world.{{sfn|galteh}}

=== Ottoman domes ===
[[File:Selimiye Mosque, Dome.jpg|thumb|left|Selimiye Mosque dome in Edirne, Turkey]]

The rise of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and its spread in [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] and the [[Balkans]] coincided with the decline of the [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk Turks]] and the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Early Ottoman buildings, for almost two centuries after 1300, were characterized by a blending of Ottoman culture and indigenous architecture, and the pendentive dome was used throughout the empire.{{sfn|Hassan|Mazloomi|Omer|2010|p=125-127}} The Byzantine dome form was adopted and further developed.{{sfn|Peterson|1996|p=68}} Ottoman architecture made exclusive use of the semi-spherical dome for vaulting over even very small spaces, influenced by the earlier traditions of both [[Byzantine Anatolia]] and [[Central Asia]].{{sfn|Kuban|1987|p=75}} The smaller the structure, the simpler the plan, but mosques of medium size were also covered by single domes.{{sfn|Kuban|1987|p=93-94}} The earliest Ottoman mosques were single oblong rooms with either simple tiled pitched roofs of wood or a wooden interior dome. Most of these wooden domes have been lost to fires and replaced by flat ceilings. The earliest masonry domes covered square single room mosques, the archetype of Ottoman architecture.{{sfn|Freely|2011|p=19-20}} Examples include the Mosque of Orhan Gazi in [[Gebze]] and [[Karagöz Bey Mosque]] in [[Mostar]].{{sfn|Hassan|Mazloomi|2010|p=107}} This domed-square unit is the defining element of the three basic Ottoman mosque plans: the single unit mosque, multi-unit mosque, and eyvan (or "[[iwan]]") mosque.{{sfn|Freely|2011|p=20}}

The multi-unit mosque uses several domed-squares of similar size along the length of a mosque, or across its width, or both, with the central dome sometimes larger than the others.{{sfn|Freely|2011|p=20}} A style common in the [[Ottoman architecture#Bursa Period .281299.E2.80.931437.29|Bursa period]], and known as the "Bursa type", is like a duplication of the single-domed square, with one long space divided by an arch into two square bays that are each covered by a dome. A variation of this type has the room covered by one dome and one semi-dome, with additional side chambers. A multi-domed style derived from [[Seljuk architecture]] is that of the [[Bursa Grand Mosque|Ulu Camii]], or Great Mosque, which consists of a number of domes of the same size supported by pillars.{{sfn|Freely|2011|p=20-21}}

The eyvan mosque type (the eyvan being derived from Seljuk architecture) uses domed-square units in a variety of sizes, heights, and details, with only the possible pair of side units being similar sizes.{{sfn|Freely|2011|p=20}}

Early experiments with large domes include the domed square mosques of [[Çine]] and [[Mudurnu]] under [[Bayezid I]], and the later domed "zawiya-mosques" at Bursa. The [[Üç Şerefeli Mosque]] at Edirne developed the idea of the central dome being a larger version of the domed modules used throughout the rest of the structure to generate open space. This idea became important to the Ottoman style as it developed.{{sfn|Kuban|1987|p=75}}

The [[Bayezid II Mosque|Beyazidiye Mosque]] (1501–1506) in Istanbul begins the [[Ottoman architecture#Classical period .281437.E2.80.931703.29|Classical period]] in Ottoman architecture, in which the great [[Mosques commissioned by the Ottoman dynasty|Imperial Mosques]], with variations, resemble the former Byzantine basilica of [[Hagia Sophia]] in having a large central dome with semi-domes of the same span to the east and west.{{sfn|Freely|2011|p=21-22}} Hagia Sophia's central dome arrangement is faithfully reproduced in three Ottoman mosques in Istanbul: the Beyazidiye Mosque, the [[Kılıç Ali Pasha Complex|Kılıç Ali Pasha Mosque]], and the [[Süleymaniye Mosque]].{{sfn|Kuban|1987|p=84}} Three other Imperial mosques in Istanbul also add semi-domes to the north and south, doing away with the basilica plan: [[Şehzade Mosque|Şehzade Camii]], [[Sultan Ahmed Mosque|Sultan Ahmed I Camii]], and [[New Mosque (Istanbul)|Yeni Cami]].{{sfn|Freely|2011|p=22}} The peak of this classical period, which lasted into the 17th century, came with the architecture of [[Mimar Sinan]]. {{sfn|Freely|2011|p=21}} In addition to large Imperial mosques, he produced hundreds of other monuments, including medium-sized mosques such as the [[Mihrimah Sultan Mosque (Edirnekapı)|Mihrimah]], [[Sokollu Mehmed Pasha Mosque (Kadırga)|Sokollu]], and [[Rüstem Pasha Mosque]] and the [[Türbe|tomb]] of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]].{{sfn|Kuban|1987|p=91}} Süleymaniye Mosque, built in Constantinople (modern [[Istanbul]]) from 1550 to 1557, has a main dome 53&amp;nbsp;meters high with a diameter of 26.5&amp;nbsp;meters. At the time it was built, the dome was the highest in the [[Ottoman Empire]] when measured from sea level, but lower from the floor of the building and smaller in diameter than that of the nearby Hagia Sophia.

Another Classical domed mosque type is, like the [[Little Hagia Sophia|Byzantine church of Sergius and Bacchus]], the domed polygon within a square. Octagons and hexagons were common, such as those of [[Üç Şerefeli Mosque]] (1437–1447) and [[Selimiye Mosque]] in Edirne.{{sfn|Freely|2011|p=22-23}} The [[Selimiye Mosque]] was the first structure built by the Ottomans that had a larger dome than that of the Hagia Sophia. The dome rises above a square bay. Corner semi-domes convert this into an octagon, which muqarnas transition to a circular base. The dome has an average internal diameter of about 31.5 meters, while that of Hagia Sophia averages 31.3 meters.{{sfn|Kuban|1987|p=89}} Designed and built by architect Mimar Sinan between 1568 and 1574, when he finished it he was 86 years old, and he considered the mosque his masterpiece.

The first large Imperial Mosque of Istanbul in the imported Baroque style was the [[Nuruosmaniye Mosque]] (1748–1755). One of the finest was the [[Laleli Mosque]] of 1759–1764.{{sfn|Freely|2011|p=23}}

=== Italian Renaissance domes ===
{{Main|History of Italian Renaissance domes}}
[[File:Santa Maria del Fiore.jpg|thumb|left|[[Florence Cathedral|The Cathedral]] of [[Florence]] with [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]]'s dome, Italy]]
[[Filippo Brunelleschi]]'s octagonal brick domical vault over [[Florence Cathedral]] was built between 1420 and 1436 and the lantern surmounting the dome was completed in 1467. The dome is 42 meters wide and made of two shells.{{sfn|Schütz|2002|p=356–357}} The dome is not itself Renaissance in style, although the lantern is closer.{{sfn|Frankl|Crossley|2000|p=213}} A combination of dome, drum, pendentives, and barrel vaults developed as the characteristic structural forms of large Renaissance churches following a period of innovation in the later fifteenth century.{{sfn|Betts|1993|p=5}} Florence was the first Italian city to develop the new style, followed by Rome and then Venice.{{sfn|Nuttgens|1997|p=181}} Brunelleschi's domes at [[Basilica of San Lorenzo, Florence|San Lorenzo]] and the [[Pazzi Chapel]] established them as a key element of Renaissance architecture.{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=304}} His plan for the dome of the Pazzi Chapel in Florence's [[Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence|Basilica of Santa Croce]] (1430–52) illustrates the Renaissance enthusiasm for geometry and for the circle as geometry's supreme form. This emphasis on geometric essentials would be very influential.{{sfn|Stephenson|Hammond|Davi|2005|p=175–176}}

''[[De Re Aedificatoria]]'', written by [[Leon Battista Alberti]] around 1452, recommends vaults with coffering for churches, as in the Pantheon, and the first design for a dome at St. Peter's Basilica in Rome is usually attributed to him, although the recorded architect is [[Bernardo Rossellino]]. This would culminate in [[Bramante]]'s 1505–06 projects for a wholly new [[St. Peter's Basilica]], marking the beginning of the displacement of the Gothic ribbed vault with the combination of dome and barrel vault, which proceeded throughout the sixteenth century.{{sfn|Betts|1993|p=5–7}} Bramante's initial design was for a Greek cross plan with a large central hemispherical dome and four smaller domes around it in a [[quincunx]] pattern. Work began in 1506 and continued under a succession of builders over the next 120 years.{{sfn|Nuttgens|1997|p=184}} The dome was completed by [[Giacomo della Porta]] and [[Domenico Fontana]].{{sfn|Nuttgens|1997|p=184}} The publication of [[Sebastiano Serlio]]'s treatise, one of the most popular architectural treatises ever published, was responsible for the spread of the oval in late Renaissance and Baroque architecture throughout Italy, Spain, France, and central Europe.{{sfn|Huerta|2007|p=230–232}}

The [[Villa Capra "La Rotonda"|Villa Capra]], also known as "La Rotunda", was built by [[Andrea Palladio]] from 1565 to 1569 near [[Vicenza]]. Its highly symmetrical square plan centers on a circular room covered by a dome, and it proved highly influential on the [[Georgian architecture|Georgian architects]] of 18th century England, architects in Russia, and architects in America, [[Thomas Jefferson]] among them. Palladio's two domed churches in Venice are [[Church of San Giorgio Maggiore|San Giorgio Maggiore]] (1565–1610) and [[Il Redentore]] (1577–92), the latter built in thanksgiving for the end of a bad outbreak of [[Bubonic plague|plague]] in the city.{{sfn|Nuttgens|1997|p=187–189}} The spread of the Renaissance-style dome outside of Italy began with central Europe, although there was often a stylistic delay of a century or two.{{sfn|Melaragno|1991|p=73}}

=== South Asian domes ===

[[File:Taj Mahal 2012.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Taj Mahal]] in [[Agra]], [[India]] built by [[Shah Jahan]].]]
[[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent|Islamic rule over northern and central India]] brought with it the use of domes constructed with stone, brick and mortar, and iron dowels and cramps. Centering was made from timber and bamboo. The use of iron cramps to join together adjacent stones was known in pre-Islamic India, and was used at the base of domes for hoop reinforcement. The synthesis of styles created by this introduction of new forms to the [[Hindu temple architecture|Hindu tradition]] of [[Post and lintel|trabeate]] construction created a distinctive architecture.{{sfn|Tappin|2003|p=1941, 1943–1944}} Domes in pre-Mughal India have a standard squat circular shape with a lotus design and bulbous finial at the top, derived from Hindu architecture. Because the Hindu architectural tradition did not include arches, flat corbels were used to transition from the corners of the room to the dome, rather than squinches.{{sfn|Peterson|1996|p=68}} In contrast to Persian and Ottoman domes, the domes of Indian tombs tend to be more bulbous.{{sfn|Nuttgens|1997|p=157}}

The earliest examples include the half-domes of the late 13th century [[tomb of Balban]] and the small dome of the tomb of Khan Shahid, which were made of roughly cut material and would have needed covering surface finishes.{{sfn|Tappin|2003|p=1944, 1946–1947}} Under the [[Lodi dynasty]] there was a large proliferation of tomb building, with octagonal plans reserved for royalty and square plans used for others of high rank, and the first double dome was introduced to India in this period.{{sfn|Tappin|2003|p=1948}} The first major [[Mughal architecture|Mughal building]] is the domed [[Humayun's Tomb|tomb of Humayun]], built between 1562 and 1571 by a Persian architect. The central double dome covers an octagonal central chamber about 15 meters wide and is accompanied by small domed [[Chhatri|chattri]] made of brick and faced with stone.{{sfn|Tappin|2003|p=1944, 1948–1949}} [[Chhatri|Chatri]]s, the domed kiosks on pillars characteristic of Mughal roofs, were adopted from their Hindu use as [[cenotaph]]s.{{sfn|Peterson|1996|p=200}} The fusion of Persian and Indian architecture can be seen in the dome shape of the [[Taj Mahal]]: the bulbous shape derives from Persian Timurid domes, and the [[finial]] with lotus leaf base is derived from Hindu temples.{{sfn|Peterson|1996|p=68}} The [[Gol Gumbaz]], or ''Round Dome'', is one of the largest masonry domes in the world. It has an internal diameter of 41.15 meters and a height of 54.25 meters.{{sfn|Tappin|2003|p=1949-1950}} The dome was the most technically advanced built in the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]].{{sfn|Michell|Zebrowski|1987|p=15}} The last major Islamic tomb built in India was the [[Tomb of Safdarjung|tomb of Safdar Jang]] (1753–54). The central dome is reportedly triple-shelled, with two relatively flat inner brick domes and an outer bulbous marble dome, although it may actually be that the marble and second brick domes are joined everywhere but under the lotus leaf finial at the top.{{sfn|Tappin|2003|p=1950-1951}}

[[File:St Paul's Cathedral Dome from One New Change - Square Crop.jpg|thumb|left|The dome of [[St Paul's Cathedral]] in London]]
In the early sixteenth century, the lantern of the Italian dome spread to Germany, gradually adopting the bulbous cupola from the Netherlands.{{sfn|Born|1944|p=214-215}} Russian architecture strongly influenced the many bulbous domes of the wooden churches of [[Bohemia]] and [[Silesia]] and, in [[Bavaria]], bulbous domes less resemble Dutch models than Russian ones. Domes like these gained in popularity in central and southern Germany and in Austria in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, particularly in the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque style]], and influenced many bulbous cupolas in Poland and Eastern Europe in the Baroque period. However, many bulbous domes in eastern Europe were replaced over time in the larger cities during the second half of the eighteenth century in favor of hemispherical or stilted cupolas in the French or Italian styles.{{sfn|Born|1944|p=218-220}}

The construction of domes in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries relied primarily on empirical techniques and oral traditions rather than the architectural treatises of the times, which avoided practical details. This was adequate for domes up to medium size, with diameters in the range of 12 to 20 meters. Materials were considered homogeneous and rigid, with compression taken into account and elasticity ignored. The weight of materials and the size of the dome were the key references. Lateral tensions in a dome were counteracted with horizontal rings of iron, stone, or wood incorporated into the structure.{{sfn|Fusco|Villanni|2003|p=580-581}}

Over the course of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, developments in mathematics and the study of [[statics]] led to a more precise formalization of the ideas of the traditional constructive practices of arches and vaults, and there was a diffusion of studies on the most stable form for these structures: the [[catenary]] curve.{{sfn|Bagliani|2009}} [[Robert Hooke]], who first articulated that a thin arch was comparable to an inverted hanging chain, may have advised Wren on how to achieve the crossing dome of [[St. Paul's Cathedral]]. Wren's structural system became the standard for large domes well into the 19th century.{{sfn|Mark|Billington|1989|p=314-315}} The ribs in [[Guarino Guarini]]'s San Lorenzo and Il Sidone were shaped as [[catenary arch]]es.{{sfn|Nuttgens|1997|p=210}} The idea of a large oculus in a solid dome revealing a second dome originated with him.{{sfn|Wittkower|1999|p=48}} He also established the oval dome as a reconciliation of the longitudinal plan church favored by the liturgy of the Counter-Reformation and the centralized plan favored by idealists.{{sfn|Earls|1971|p=128}} Because of the imprecision of oval domes in the [[Rococo]] period, drums were problematic and the domes instead often rested directly on arches or pendentives.{{sfn|Earls|1971|p=135-36}}

In the eighteenth century, the study of dome structures changed radically, with domes being considered as a composition of smaller elements, each subject to mathematical and mechanical laws and easier to analyse individually, rather than being considered as whole units unto themselves.{{sfn|Bagliani|2009}} Although never very popular in domestic settings, domes were used in a number of 18th century homes built in the [[Neoclassical architecture|Neo-Classical]] style.{{sfn|Palmer|2009|p=92-93}} In the United States, most public buildings in the late 18th century were only distinguishable from private residences because they featured cupolas.{{sfn|Allen|2001|p=13}}

[[File:Eden Project geodesic domes panorama.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.8|[[Geodesic dome]]s of the [[Eden Project]] in United Kingdom]]
The [[Historicism (art)|historicism]] of the 19th century led to many domes being re-translations of the great domes of the past, rather than further stylistic developments, especially in sacred architecture.{{sfn|Stephenson|Hammond|Davi|2005|p=190}} New production techniques allowed for [[cast iron]] and [[wrought iron]] to be produced both in larger quantities and at relatively low prices during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Russia, which had large supplies of iron, has some of the earliest examples of iron's architectural use.{{sfn|Gayle|Gayle|1998|p=13-14, 18, 26}} Excluding those that simply imitated multi-shell masonry, metal framed domes such as the elliptical dome of [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London (57 to 67 meters in diameter) and the circular dome of the [[Halle au Blé (Paris)|Halle au Blé]] in Paris may represent the century's chief development of the simple domed form.{{sfn|Mainstone|2001|p=241}} Cast-iron domes were particularly popular in France.{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=304}}

The practice of building rotating domes for [[Observatory|housing large telescopes]] was begun in the 19th century, with early examples using papier-mâché to minimize weight.{{sfn|Lippincott|2008|p=26}} Unique glass domes springing straight from ground level were used for [[Greenhouse|hothouses]] and [[winter garden]]s.{{sfn|Kohlmaier|Von Sartory|1991|p=126-127}} Elaborate covered [[Arcade (architecture)|shopping arcades]] included large [[glazing (window)|glazed]] domes at their cross intersections.{{sfn|Coleman|2006|p=32}} The large domes of the 19th century included [[Convention center|exhibition buildings]] and functional structures such as [[Gas holder|gasometers]] and [[Motive power depot|locomotive sheds]].{{sfn|Kohlmaier|Von Sartory|1991|p=126}} The "first fully triangulated framed dome" was built in Berlin in 1863 by [[Johann Wilhelm Schwedler]] and, by the start of the 20th century, similarly triangulated frame domes had become fairly common.{{sfn|Mainstone|2001|p=171}}{{sfn|Dimčić|2011|p=8}} [[Vladimir Shukhov]] was also an early pioneer of what would later be called [[gridshell]] structures and in 1897 he employed them in domed exhibit pavilions at the All-Russia Industrial and Art Exhibition.{{sfn|Dimčić|2011|p=8}}

Domes built with steel and concrete were able to achieve very large spans.{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=304}} In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Guastavino family, a father and son team who worked on the eastern seaboard of the United States, further developed the masonry dome, using [[Guastavino tile|tiles]] set flat against the surface of the curve and fast-setting [[Portland cement]], which allowed mild steel bar to be used to counteract tension forces.{{sfn|Mainstone|2001|p=129}} The thin domical shell was further developed with the construction by [[Walther Bauersfeld]] of two [[planetarium]] domes in [[Jena]], Germany in the early 1920s. They consisting of a triangulated frame of light steel bars and mesh covered by a thin layer of concrete.{{sfn|Mainstone|2001|p=134}} These are generally taken to be the first modern architectural [[Thin-shell structure|thin shells]].{{sfn|Bradshaw|Campbell|Gargari|Mirmiran|Tripeny|2002|p=693}} These are also considered the first [[geodesic dome]]s.{{sfn|Langmead|Garnaut|2001|p=131}} Geodesic domes have been used for radar enclosures, greenhouses, housing, and weather stations.{{sfn|Langmead|Garnaut|2001|p=131-132}} Architectural shells had their heyday in the 1950s and 1960s, peaking in popularity shortly before the widespread adoption of computers and the [[finite element method]] of [[structural analysis]].{{sfn|Bradshaw|Campbell|Gargari|Mirmiran|Tripeny|2002|p=693-694, 697}}

The first permanent [[Air-supported structure|air supported]] membrane domes were the [[Radome|radar domes]] designed and built by Walter Bird after World War II. Their low cost eventually led to the development of permanent versions using teflon-coated fiberglass and by 1985 the majority of the domed stadiums around the world used this system.{{sfn|Bradshaw|Campbell|Gargari|Mirmiran|Tripeny|2002|p=701-702}} [[Tensegrity]] domes, patented by Buckminster Fuller in 1962, are [[membrane structure]]s consisting of radial trusses made from steel cables under tension with vertical steel pipes spreading the cables into the truss form. They have been made circular, elliptical, and other shapes to cover stadiums from Korea to Florida.{{sfn|Levy|Salvadori|2002|p=322-323}} Tension membrane design has depended upon computers, and the increasing availability of powerful computers resulted in many developments being made in the last three decades of the 20th century.{{sfn|Bradshaw|Campbell|Gargari|Mirmiran|Tripeny|2002|p=700, 703}} The higher expense of rigid large span domes made them relatively rare, although rigidly moving panels is the most popular system for sports stadiums with [[retractable roof]]ing.{{sfn|Charlier}}{{sfn|Friedman|Farkas|2011|p=49}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3161">'''"Genre-busting"''' is a term used occasionally in reviews of written work, music and visual art and refers to the author or artist's ability to cross over two or more established styles. For instance, in writing, to combine the horror [[genre]] with a [[Western (genre)|western]] or [[hard-boiled]] detective story with [[science fiction]]. In music the term may refer to a song combining styles or defying classification.

The sound of the term calls to mind other uses of "buster" such as "crime buster", "[[Gangbusters]]", "[[Ghostbusters]]", "[[No. 617 Squadron RAF|Dambusters]]", etc.

Creative people don't always feel comfortable working within an established category. So genre-busting within the publishing world has become a type of [[literary fiction]]. The publisher [[Atticus Books]] has gone so far as to declare, on their website: ''"We specialize in genre-busting literary fiction—i.e., titles that fall between the cracks of genre fiction and compelling narratives that feature memorable main characters."''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://atticusbooksonline.com/about |title=Atticus Books (about) |publisher=atticusbooksonline.com |accessdate=2012-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Video Movie Guide 1998'' stated in its foreword, "In past years, reviews in VMG have been broken down into genre categories. Now, by popular demand, we are listing all movies together in alphabetical order.... So many movies today mix genres... and there are no clear-cut categories anymore."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=Mick|last2=Porter|first2=Marsha|title=Video Movie Guide 1998|date=October 1997|isbn=978-0345424235|pages=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interviewed in ''Mustard'' comedy magazine in 2005, writer [[Alan Moore]] said: "I mean, this is probably a bad thing to say to someone from a comedy magazine, but I don't like genre. I think that genre was made up by some spotty clerk in [[WH Smiths]] in the 1920s to make his worthless fucking job a little easier for him: "it'd be easier if these books said what they were about on the spine."" going on to say: "In the novel I'm writing, Jerusalem, there's an awful lot of funny stuff, and there's supernatural stuff; there's stuff in the prologue that's as good as [[Stephen King]] and it's just a description of my brother walking through a block of flats. It's horror. And there's social history, there's political stuff. Why not mix it all together? Because that's what life is actually like. We laugh, we cry, you know, we buy the t-shirt." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|url=http://www.mustardweb.org/04/page15.htm |title=The Mustard Interview |publisher=mustardweb.org |date=January 2005 |accessdate=2012-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her works were newly discovered in the late 1990s and were later exhibited at the [[Jewish Museum Vienna|Jewish Museum]] in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]].&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite book|title=Die Welt der Ili Kronstein = the world of Ili Kronstein : Werke 1938-1943|date=2000|publisher=Juedisches Museum Wien, 2000.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Ili was born in 1897 to Sigmund (Zsiga) Neumann and Emma Deutsch in Budapest, [[Austria-Hungary]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Her younger sisters were born in 1899 (Margit (Manci)) and in 1903 (Klara (Klari)). Around 1908, Sigmund's textile mill went out of business and he emigrated to [[Trieste]], [[Italy]] with his family. There, Ili became proficient in Italian and developed an appreciation for Italy and its inhabitants. She showed artistic skill during childhood, but her work was discouraged by Sigmund. The family returned to Budapest, and Ili was removed from school when she was 16, as she needed to concentrate on getting ready for marriage and the middle-class lifestyle that accompanied it. During this period of her life, she volunteered for several years in nursery schools for poor children.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==Later life and artistic influences==

Ili married Robert Kronstein in 1919, despite original disapproval from Sigmund and Emma. She moved with Robert to [[Vienna]], Austria-Hungary and he purchased a pharmacy there. In 1920, the couple had its first daughter, [[Gerda Lerner|Gerda]], and in 1925 its second daughter, Nora (named after Nora Helmer from [[A Doll's House|Henrik Ibsen's ''A Doll's House'']]). Ili and Robert's marriage was tense and contradictory. Much of the riffs in the marriage stemmed from Ili's longing to branch out and meet fascinating and enlightened people. The couple moved to a larger apartment during her first pregnancy. Ili's mother-in-law lived with them, and she disapproved of Ili's artistic and nonconformist attitudes. Following the birth of Nora, both Ili and Robert agreed to live together in the same home as friends (not husband and wife), and "he continued to support her throughout their lives."&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Kronstein was then free to evolve artistically while being financially secure. She experimented with defining herself both as a person and as an artist for many years. She became a [[book binder]] and, after this, a German (her second language) writer. Kronstein started to diligently develop her artistry in the early 1930s, first as a graphic artist. Initially, Kronstein was significantly influenced by [[Egon Schiele]]'s work, but later she was influenced by the artist-teacher [[Johannes Itten]]. She learned from Itten either at his School of Living and Art in [[Berlin, Germany]] or over the duration of one of his frequent visits to Vienna. Over the course of 1934 to 1936, Kronstein informally taught Gerda art lessons which mirrored Itten's methodology and viewpoints. Later, Itten's philosophies guided Kronstein's work; the counsel she provided for Nora (she went on to become an artist); and the description (in print) of a painting class that she had planned, which encompasses "practice exercises" and philosophical ideology (for instance, the relationship among breathing exercises, yoga, and art).&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Kronstein developed herself as an artist though study of the "old masters[']" art when she travelled to Italy and other places periodically. She additionally educated herself on "[[Japanese brush painting|Japanese classical brush painting]]," and was interested in [[Impressionist]] artwork, especially [[Paul Cézanne]]. She also took interest in literary, cinematic, and artistic [[German Expressionism]].&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Kronstein rented an art studio in 1933&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; with help from Robert's economic support. There, she worked many days and nights at her work, while running a salon as well. She featured her "graphic work, portraits and landscapes" at her own exhibits. Her evolution as an artist was stunted by the [[Anschluss]] (1938). Not long after, Robert moved to [[Vaduz]] in [[Liechtenstein]] (Robert founded another pharmacy there in 1933.)
During a [[Nazi]] street raid, Ili was coerced to scrub the sidewalk. Gerda and Ili were held in jail for six weeks (April 1938) "as hostages for Robert." Prior to their release, it was required that Ili declare in writing that she and her children would leave Austria immediately, however, three months passed before they could leave Austria to reunite with Robert. At first, Kronstein felt free spirited, as she had just escaped from Nazi influence. However, that positivity was replaced by "restlessness and unhappiness," because she resented "the uncultured provincialism of Vaduz" and she did not have a studio. During this time, Nora attended a Swiss boarding school, and Gerda went to [[Zürich]], [[Switzerland]] in hopes to attain a visa to the [[United States|U.S.]] Kronstein then left Vaduz and visited in Zürich periodically. In Zürich, she roomed with Gerda in a "cheap, small room," consumed food moderately, but took relish in the cultural resources. In 1938,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; both Ili and Gerda were held in jail as foreigners and [[deportation]] to Germany was a threatened upon them. Robert managed to change their deportation location to Liechtenstein.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Kronstein left Liechtenstein, and stayed for a brief time in [[Paris]], France. She then left for [[southern France]]. There, her artistic creativity blossomed. She started working with colors, and her works gained more depth. During this time, her style bordered [[cubism]] and [[Abstraction (art)|abstraction]]. She spent time in [[Nice, France|Nice]] and befriended inspirational artists who taught her valuable lessons. In this circle of inspirations was [[Latvians|Latvian]] painter [[Rudolf Ray-Rapaport]], and he and Kronstein became close friends.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

The Kronsteins still planned to emigrate, but, in June 1941, Ili's application for a [[U.S. visa]] got denied. In the past, she was confined in [[Gurs internment camp]] for six weeks alongside ten thousand refugees, both Jews and anti-Fascists. Also in Gurs was [[Charlotte Salomon]] and [[Hannah Arendt]]. In Gurs, Kronstein showed "remarkable courage, good humor and resourcefulness," despite dwindling health. In late 1940, Kronstein endured [[paralysis]] of her right arm. Later on in 1945, Kronstein was diagnosed with [[multiple sclerosis]]. Over the course of the year 1941, she could not work for extended amounts of time, however, she still drew until she could no longer grip a pencil. Following Ray-Rapaport's immigration to the U.S. in 1942, Kronstein went to Liechtenstein and later to Switzerland in order to receive treatment for her illnesses. She was paralyzed yet mentally attentive and spent her last four years of life in private care in Zürich. She died at the age of fifty-one on April 22, 1948.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

'''Immersive design''' describes the activity of a new generation of designers who work inclusively across all story-driven media, from [[film]] and [[interactive media]] to live audience environments. Immersive designers deal simultaneously with virtual and dimensional environments and who and what they contain; and with time-based [[narrative]] and story space.

[[Alex McDowell]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://websoles.com/ Design News - Reviewing fmx/08 Which Happened In Stuttgart, Germany - TAXI Design Network&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313055923/http://websoles.com/ |date=March 13, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vfxworld.com/?sa=adv&amp;code=3631a5a1&amp;atype=news&amp;id=23257 &gt;&gt; VFXWorld / News &lt;&lt;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; coined the phrase 'immersive design' in 2007 in order to frame a new discussion around a design discipline that uniquely addresses story-based media within the context of digital and virtual technologies. Together McDowell and museum director [[Chris Scoates]] co-directed [http://5dconference.com/ 5D | The Future of Immersive Design] conference in Long Beach 2008, laying the groundwork for immersive design to be a distinct [[design|design philosophy]] and thus be subject to wider scrutiny, development and promotion. 5D has since become a forum and community representing a broad range of cross-media designers with its intent based in education, cross-pollination and the development of an expanding knowledge base.

Having only been actively promoted as a [[design|design philosophy]] to be discussed internationally in recent years, immersive design is very much in its infancy, but as a term it has already been appropriated for the purposes of describing design for narrative media and the process of [[Worldbuilding]].  The rapid rise and recognition of transmedia and virtual production emphasises the need for immersive design as the single most fluid cross-media discipline.

==Characteristics==
The immersive design process attempts to describe two simultaneous entwined tasks:
* To design intact worlds that are coherent, have an interior logic, contain history, geography, surface, metaphor, respond to and drive narrative, and allow an audience to be fully immersed in both environment and story. By definition an immersive designer is engaged in the embedding of story into environment, whether for passive or interactive media, in virtual or physical worlds. 
* To put in place a non-linear immersive design process that provides a fully collaborative, often digital and virtual production environment for creators and the work that they are creating.

Many in the industry believe that it is recent developments in technology that have enabled both of these aspects of immersive design to exist; technology consisting of design tools that create a virtual workspace (an intuitive three-dimensional design language and vision) that allows for non-linear workflows, broadening the opportunity of what can be created. However, others argue that both of these aspects have always existed, believing that recent developments in technology have simply allowed these aspects to fit more easily into conventional mainstream production workflow. In relation to this, [[Alex McDowell]] has commented that "It is probably true to say that the designer has always harnessed the best tools available, but that the potential of design tools based in digital technology and allowing for the interaction and manipulation of dimensional space fundamentally advances the craft." {{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

One issue within the philosophical discussion of immersive design is how much immersive design should define itself by new technology, and by doing so, whether it narrows down its own possibilities as well as broadening them. [[Alex McDowell]] expanded on this by commenting "What is clear is that technology will keep changing, and that the designer must become increasingly adept and adaptative while remaining focused on the creative intent." {{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

The [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word for symbol is ''ot'', which, in early Judaism, denoted not only a sign, but also a visible religious token of the relation between [[God]] and man.

Jewish lore links the symbol to the "[[Seal of Solomon]]", the magical signet ring used by [[King Solomon]] to control demons and spirits. Jewish lore also links the symbol to a magic shield owned by King David that protected him from enemies.

==Shabbat and circumcision==
{{Judaism}}
The Shabbat, according to Ezekiel 20:12 is God's sign ("ot") between Him and His people. It states, "Moreover also I gave them my shabbats, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD that sanctify them."  The Shabbat was instituted on the seventh day of creation for all mankind, and God did three things as our example in Genesis 2:1-3... 1) He rested from all work, 2) He blessed the Shabbat, and 3) God sanctified the seventh day, which means He set it apart for only Holy use.  The ten commandments in Exodus 20:8-12 explain further that, "six days shall you labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is the Shabbat of the Lord your God, in that day you shall do no work".

==The Tabernacle and the sacrifices==

{{Main|Tabernacle (Judaism)|Korban}}

According to the [[Hebrew Bible]], while the [[Israelites]] were living in the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] for forty years, they built a Tabernacle ({{lang-he|משכן}} [[transliteration|translit]]: ''mishkan'', "Place of [Divine] dwelling"); this was viewed as the abode of the Shekhinah (the presence of YHWH) on Earth, and the place where the priests could minister to God on behalf of the nation of Israel.

The Hebrew for priest is ''Kohen''; the ''Kohanim'' (plural) mediated between God and man by offering sacrifices, and by other services in the Temple. The leader of them the ''Kohen Gadol'', the high priest.

The vestments of the high priest were interpreted in three ways. The explanation of Philo is as follows ("Vita Mosis," iii. 209): His upper garment was the symbol of the ether, while the blossoms represented the earth, the [[pomegranate]]s typified running water, and the [[bell (instrument)|bell]]s denoted the music of the water. The [[ephod]] corresponded to heaven, and the stones on both shoulders to the two hemispheres, one above and the other below the earth. The six names on each of the stones were the six signs of the [[zodiac]], which were denoted also by the twelve names on [[Priestly breastplate|the breastplate]]. The miter was the sign of the crown, which exalted the high priest above all earthly kings.

[[Josephus]]' explanation is this:&lt;ref&gt;"Ant." iii. 7, § 7&lt;/ref&gt; The coat was the symbol of the earth, the upper garment emblemized heaven, while the bells and pomegranates represented thunder and lightning. The [[ephod]] typified the four elements, and the interwoven gold denoted the glory of God. The breastplate was in the center of the ephod, as the earth formed the center of the universe; the [[girdle]] symbolized the ocean, the stones on the shoulders the sun and moon, and the jewels in the breastplate the twelve signs of the zodiac, while the miter was a token of heaven.

The [[Talmud|Jerusalem Talmud]]&lt;ref&gt;Menachot vii. 1&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Midrash]] ''Leviticus Rabbah'' (x.) give the following interpretation: The coat symbolized atonement for murder or for the sin of wearing mixed garments, and the undergarment typified atonement for unchastity. The miter denoted atonement for pride, and the belt for theft or trickery. The breastplate represented atonement for any perversion of the Law, the ephod for idolatry, and the robe for slander.

==The symbolic values of numbers==
{{See also|Significance of numbers of Judaism|Hebrew numerology}}

The number [[3 (number)|three]] was the symbol of holiness and love. The Holy of Holies occupied one-third, and the Holy Place two-thirds, of the entire Temple. The tapestries were ten times three [[ell]]s in length, and there were three vessels each for the altar of burnt offering, the altar of incense, and the Ark. The candlestick had twice three arms (besides the shaft, which also held a lamp), and each arm had three knobs. The blessing of the priest consisted of three sections,&lt;ref&gt;Num. vi. 24, 25&lt;/ref&gt; and in the invocation of God the word "holy" was repeated thrice.

The symbolism of the number [[4 (number)|four]] was based on the contemplation of the quaternity as found in the universe, which included both heaven and earth&lt;ref&gt;comp. Job xxxvii. I Copied from wikipedia3; Isa. xi. 12; Ezek. vii. 2; I Chron. ix. 24; Dan. viii. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;  The number four connoted [[heaven]] as the throne of God.

The Holy of Holies was in the form of a [[Cube (geometry)|cube]], and the Holy Place was a double cube in length. All the vessels of the Temple in Jerusalem (except the candlestick) were rectangular. According to Ezekiel i. 26-28, the number four symbolized the divine revelation, while in the view of Philo it was the number of complete harmony.&lt;ref&gt;"De Opificio Mundi," pp.&amp;nbsp;13–15&lt;/ref&gt;

The number [[5 (number)|five]] typified semicompletion. The dimensions of the curtain of the Holy of Holies were four ells by five; the altar in the court covered a surface of five square ells; and there were five pillars at the entrance to the Tabernacle.

The number [[6 (number)|six]] symbolizes imperfection.

The number [[7 (number)|seven]] was the general symbol for all association with God, and was the favorite religious number of Judaism, typifying the covenant of holiness and sanctification, and also all that was holy and sanctifying in purpose. The candlestick had seven lamps, and the acts of atonement and purification were accompanied by a sevenfold sprinkling. The establishment of the Sabbath, the [[shmita|Sabbatical year]], and the year of jubilee was based on the number seven, as were the periods of purification and of mourning.
The number 7 is the Divine number of completion.

The number [[8 (number)|eight]] symbolizes new beginnings. According to [[Kaballah]] in the [[Zohar]] the number eight signifies this because the eighth day was the first day after creation when God returned to work; the week began again.

The number [[10 (number)|ten]] symbolized absolute completeness. The court to the Tabernacle was ten times ten ells long, and five times ten ells wide, and in the Holy of Holies the [[Ten Commandments]] were preserved.

The number [[12 (number)|twelve]], being the product of three and four, typified the union of the people with God.&lt;ref name="Maude-1862"&gt;[[#MAUDE 1862|Maude 1862]]: p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=8oMEAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=%22union%20of%20the%20people%20with%20god%22%20israel&amp;pg=PA509#v=onepage&amp;q=%22union%20of%20the%20people%20with%20god%22%20israel&amp;f=false 509]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|1|Kings|18:31-38|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Genesis|32:24-30|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the table were twelve loaves of show-bread, and the breastplate of the priest contained twelve precious stones as emblems of the [[twelve tribes of Israel]], which camped round about the Sanctuary.

The number [[13 (number)|thirteen]] symbolizes the principles of faith and God's mercy.

The number [[18 (number)|eighteen]] is considered significant because the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word for "life" is חי (''[[Chai (symbol)|chai]]''), which has a [[gematria|numerical value]] of 18.

The number [[26 (number)|twenty six]] symbolizes God's name.

==Metals and minerals==
[[Gold]] was the symbol of the divine or celestial light, the glory of God.&lt;ref&gt;Zech. vi. 11; Dan. xi. 21&lt;/ref&gt; [[Silver]] was the emblem of moral innocence and of holiness.&lt;ref&gt;Isa. i. 22; Jer. vi. 30&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brass]] symbolized hardness, strength, and firmness.&lt;ref&gt;Lev. xxvi. 19; Jer. xv. 12; Job xl. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Brass was a substitute for gold, and iron for silver.&lt;ref&gt;Isa. lx. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Salt]] was declared to be necessary in every meal-offering, in which it takes the place of the blood in the animal sacrifices.&lt;ref&gt;Lev. ii. 13; but comp. Ezek. xliii. 24&lt;/ref&gt; In the Talmud salt symbolizes the [[Torah]], for as the world cannot exist without salt, so it can not endure without the Torah.&lt;ref&gt;Soferim xv. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colors==

The Israelites used an [[indigo]]-colored dye called ''tekhelet''; this dye was likely made from snail ''[[murex trunculus]]''. This dye was very important in both Jewish and non-Jewish cultures of this time, and was used by royalty and the upper-class in dyeing their clothing, sheets, curtains, etc. This dye is known as [[Tyrian purple]].

In the Torah the Israelites are commanded to dye one of the threads of their [[tallit]] (prayer shawl) with tekhelet; when they look at this dye they will think of the blue sky, and of the God above them in Heaven. Tekhelet corresponds to the color of the divine revelation (Midrash Numbers Rabbah xv.) [[Blue in Judaism]] has thus had an important significance throughout the history of Jewish culture up to the present. Blue was also associated with the ten commandments. When Moses and the elders went up the mount Sinai, they saw God standing on a Sapphire pavement (Blue) and the tables of the law were made of THE stone (i.e. Sapphire) and thus the blue on their garments was to be a permanent reminder of the law of God.

"Argaman" was the symbol of power, and of glory,&lt;ref&gt;Isa. lx. 6; Judges viii. 26&lt;/ref&gt; so that [[Alexander Balas]] robed Jonathan in purple,&lt;ref&gt;I Macc. x. 20&lt;/ref&gt; which was especially used to designate royal dignity.&lt;ref&gt;I Macc. x. 20, xi. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

"Tola'at" and "shani" ("[[scarlet (color)|scarlet]]," "[[crimson]]") symbolized blood, and thus frequently typified life, although this color often designated sin, as well as joy and happiness.&lt;ref&gt;Gen. xxxviii. 28; Josh. ii. 18, 21; Jer. iv. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

Purification from sin was also symbolized by purple.&lt;ref&gt;Lev. xvi. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

"Shesh" ([[white]]) was the symbol of physical and intellectual purity, being the true color of light, without any modification.&lt;ref&gt;Cant. v. 10; Dan. iv. 10, 14, 20; Zech. xiv. 5&lt;/ref&gt; White also symbolizes death.  In some cases, it can also symbolize life.

Yellow has an association with an anti-Semitic forced identification mark (see [[Yellow badge]]).

==Festivals and holy days==
[[File:2nd century Rome gold goblet shows Jewish ritual objects.jpg|thumb|Jewish ritual objects shown on a gold goblet (2nd century CE) excavated in Rome]]
The Torah delineates three [[pilgrimage]] festivals, [[Passover]], [[Shavuot]] (The Feasts of Weeks) and [[Sukkot]] (Tabernacles). Each of these was tied to the agricultural cycle of the Israelites, and was also given a theological symbolism.

[[Passover]] celebrated the rebirth of nature, and symbolized the origin of the Jewish people.

The eating of bitter herbs symbolized the miseries of the [[The Exodus#Bondage in Egypt|Egyptian bondage]]. In the evenings four cups of wine were drunk, to symbolize the four world-kingdoms.&lt;ref&gt;Talmud Yerushalmi Pesachim 37c; Midrash Gen. Rabbah lxxx&lt;/ref&gt; People eating during the Passover meal reclined, in the style of free rich aristocrats, to represent their liberation from [[slavery]].

A discussion of the meaning of [[Shavuot]] (the Feast of Weeks) and of [[Sukkot]], the Feast of [[Tabernacle (Judaism)|Tabernacles]], is found in the entries on those subjects.

A discussion of symbolism inherent in [[Rosh Hashanah]] (The New Year) and [[Yom Kippur]] (the Day of Atonement) is found in the entries on those subjects. The Day of Atonement was considered the most holy day of the entire year, and was regarded as the symbol of the complete atonement of the people and of their absolution from their sins committed against God.

==Symbolic visions of the Prophets==
[[Jeremiah (prophet)|Jeremiah]] beheld an [[almond]]-tree as a token of the speedy fulfillment of the word of God.

[[Amos (prophet)|Amos]] saw a basket of summer fruit as a symbol of the approaching end of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Amos viii. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahijah the Shilonite tore Jeroboam's mantle into twelve pieces, to typify the division of the kingdom of Israel,&lt;ref&gt;I Kings xi. 30&lt;/ref&gt; and Zedekiah made horns of iron to encourage Ahab to engage in war with Ramoth-gilead.&lt;ref&gt;I Kings xxii. 11&lt;/ref&gt; King Joash, at the command of the prophet Elisha, shot arrows from the open window into the air, to symbolize the destruction of his enemies.&lt;ref&gt;II Kings xiii. 15-19&lt;/ref&gt;

Isaiah walked naked and barefoot to show how the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] and [[People of Ethiopia|Ethiopians]] would be treated when taken captive by the Assyrians,&lt;ref&gt;Isa. xx. 2&lt;/ref&gt; while Jeremiah wore a [[yoke]] upon his neck to induce the nations to submit to the King of Assyria.&lt;ref&gt;Jer. xxvii. 2-4, 10-12&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ezekiel]] was commanded to inscribe the names of certain tribes upon separate pieces of wood, to show that God would reunite those tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Ezek. xxxvii. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Leningrad Codex Carpet page e.jpg|thumb|The Star of David in the oldest surviving complete copy of the [[Masoretic text]], the [[Leningrad Codex]], dated 1008.]]

==On tombstones==
Some common themes appear on many Jewish tombstones. Two hands with outspread fingers indicated that the dead man was descended from priestly stock (''[[Kohen|Kohanim]]'') who blessed the people in this fashion, and a jug was carved on the tombstones of the [[Levite]]s as an emblem of those who washed the priest's hands before he pronounced the blessing.

Some gravestones show a tree with branches either outspread or broken off, symbolizing the death of a young man or an old man respectively; or they have a cluster of [[grape]]s as an emblem of Israel.

The [[Star of David]] (''Magen David'') occurs frequently.

Sometimes figures symbolized the name of the deceased, as the figure of a lion for Loeb, a wolf for Benjamin, and a rose for the name Bluma/Blume.

==Influence on Christian symbols==
The influence of Judaism upon [[Christian symbolism]] as early as the 2nd and 3rd centuries A.D., is apparent both in painting and in sculpture, the most frequent motives being those that occur in the [[Mishnah]] as formulas for prayer on fast-days. The prayer beginning with the words "Mi she-'anah," which was included in the [[selihah]] at an early date, was adopted in the Christian ritual as the litany "Libera domine." This litany was figuratively used in a certain sequence as a symbol, for the sacrifice of [[Isaac]] was regarded as a symbol of the [[crucifixion]] of [[Jesus]], since the early religions, and the act of sacrifice emblemized the death on the cross.

Abraham was represented as the symbol of the power of faith and Isaac as the sacrificed redeemer. The ascension of [[Elijah]] was believed to typify the [[ascension of Jesus Christ]], who was regarded by Christian symbolism as an analogue to Elijah, although this ascension was also taken as a type of the general [[resurrection]] from the dead. Job sitting among the ashes was the symbol of patience and of the power of resistance of the flesh; and [[Hananiah, Azariah, and Mishael|Hananiah]], [[Meshach|Mishael]], and [[Abednego|Azariah]] in the fiery furnace typified steadfastness in persecution and faith in the aid of God. Christian [[sarcophagi]] contained artistic representations of the fall of man, [[Noah]] and the ark, scenes from the life of [[Moses]] in three variations, [[Joshua]], [[David]], and [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]].

==The land of Zion==
{{Main|Land of Israel}}

[[Zion]] is a Biblical term that refers to [[Jerusalem]], and is the source for the modern term [[Zionism]].

[[File:Correggio_MadonnaSzentFerenccel.jpg|thumb|''Madonna and Child with St Francis'']]
'''''Madonna and Child with St Francis''''' or '''''Madonna of St Francis''''' is a 1514-1515 painting by [[Correggio]], now held in the [[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister]] in [[Dresden]], Germany. It shows [[Francis of Assisi]], with the stigmata, prostrating himself before an enthroned Madonna and Child - the work's theme is the intercession of the Madonna, which was promoted by the [[Franciscans]] after the definition of the dogma of the [[Immaculate Conception]] in 1473. Francis is supported by [[Anthony of Padua]], whilst on the right are [[Catherine of Alexandria]] and [[John the Baptist]] and on the base of the Madonna's throne is a small [[grisaille]] image of [[Moses]] with the tablets of the law. Catherine's wheel bears the painter's signature "Antonivs de Alegri F.[ecit]".

==History==
The contract for the work (Correggio's first major commission) was signed by the artist on 30 August 1514, with the consent of his still-unmarried father, and of brother Girolamo Cattania, the guardian of the Franciscan convent in the town of [[Correggio, Emilia-Romagna]], whose church was dedicated to St Francis. The work was probably meant as the high altarpiece for the convent church - that altar was site of the Da Correggio family vault. He was paid for it on 4 April 1515, showing how fast he produced it - these two records provide the first documentary evidence of his career. 

Just before 1638 the painting was confiscated by [[Francesco I d'Este]] and taken to the [[Ducal Palace of Modena|Palazzo Ducale]] in [[Modena]], where it hung alongside five other Correggios seized from the duchy's territory. In 1746 the impoverished [[Francesco III d'Este]] tried to raise some money by selling the hundred most famous works in the [[Galleria Estense]], including the six Correggios, to [[Augustus III of Saxony]].

'''Music-on-demand''' is a music distribution model conceived with the growth of two-way computing, telecommunications and the [[Internet]] in the early 1990s. Primarily, high-quality music is made available to purchase, access and play back using software on the [[Apple Macintosh]], [[Microsoft Windows]], set-top boxes and mobile devices from an available distribution point, such as a computer host or server located at a telephone, cable TV or wireless data center facility.

In 1992, [[computer modem]] speeds were limited to less than 28 thousand bits per second (28 kbit/s), compared with uncompressed music on [[compact disc]] (CD) that required 150 thousand [[bytes]] per second.  As a result, additional [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] is required to accommodate delivering audio at CD quality standards: 16-bit frame, 44.1 [[kHz]] [[sampling rate]], stereophonic (two channel audio).  This prompted telephony, [[CATV]], cellular and satellite providers to consider changing standards, assisting in creating the [[information superhighway]], in terms of building higher capacity for existing telecommunications [[infrastructure]]s.

Early attempts at designing and developing music-on-demand technology, in accordance with the laws of the United States such as the [[Audio Home Recording Act|Home Recording Act of 1992]], include [[Access Media Network]] (AMN) by inventor [[Dale Schalow]].  Schalow, born in Virginia, was an independent audio engineer and programmer in Los Angeles, California, who helped record albums and music scores for [[David Bowie]], [[Tin Machine]], [[Cypress Hill]], [[House of Pain]], [[Beastie Boys]], [[Interscope Records|Interscope]], and [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Brothers]].  A [[multiplexed]] music-on-demand model was deployed using [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] audio sampling devices, Apple IIci, the [[Kermit (protocol)|KERMIT]] computer file transfer protocol, and [[SCSI]] storage systems by Schalow to validate processing 16-bit multi-channel audio from [[Point-to-point (telecommunications)|point-to-point]] in a professional recording studio environment, including his own independently operated '''Dascha''' company and '''38 Fresh Recordings'''.  The model conceived was introduced by Schalow to Apple Computer in 1992 after he submitted an entry into the "I Changed the World" contest, essentially describing how an Apple computer helped shape and change the world forever based upon its usage.  Apple acknowledged the "Accessible Music Network" (AMN) by awarding Schalow Honorable Mention and sending him a simple gray T-shirt with the Apple logo on it.  Stand-alone software created by AMN for consumer-based access was then developed for the [[Microsoft Windows]] computer operating system, as well as set-top box design prototypes conceptualized with 3D prototype imaging that required a telephone connector located next to a [[coaxial]] cable TV connector to converge low speed data uplinking with high speed downloading interactive communications.

Presently, music-on-demand is still the center of controversy with a focus on illegal music downloading, [[peer-to-peer]] file swapping and the lag of legislation for rapidly changing technology on the Internet.  Record labels represented by the [[RIAA]], as well as publishers and songwriters, have vigorously defended copyrighted materials and have been successful in enforcing current laws for protecting their intellectual property.  As of 2006, the new music industry has seen a rapid growth in overall revenues for legal digital music sales that has resulted in hitting and surpassing one billion dollars annually.

[[File:Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Opera Company.jpg|thumb|300px|right|National Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Opera Company poster]]
The '''National Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Opera Company''' (formerly the '''Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Opera Company''') is an English professional repertory company that performs [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s [[Savoy opera]]s.  Founded in 1995 to perform at the [[International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival]], the company generally stages three or four productions each summer, giving up to 16 performances in [[Harrogate]], North Yorkshire, and also touring. 

The company performs full-scale productions of the Gilbert and Sullivan works, with orchestra, using period settings and costumes. Since 2010, in addition to its performances at the festival, the company has generally performed one or more of its productions in an additional venue either before or after the festival. Since 2014, it has toured some of its productions to multiple British cities in repertory, giving up to 42 performances on tour.

==Background==
The [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] performed [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s [[Savoy Opera]]s continuously, year-round, for over a century, closing in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, pp. 49–50; Joseph, p. 358. Between 1988 and 2003, a seasonal company used the name D'Oyly Carte. See Bradley, pp. 54–68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skow, John. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,921136,00.html 1982 "Music: Final Curtain for D'Oyly Carte"]. ''Time'' magazine, 8 March 1982, accessed 7 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Until the Gilbert and Sullivan copyrights expired in 1961, no other professional theatre or opera companies were allowed to present the Savoy Operas in Britain, although professional companies performed the operas in North America, Australia and elsewhere, and numerous amateur Gilbert and Sullivan companies performed around the world. After 1961 other professional groups began to perform the operas in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, chapters four and six&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hewett&gt;Hewett, Ivan.

''The Telegraph'', 2 August 2009, accessed 14 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, the [[International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival]] was founded by Ian and his son Neil Smith partly to fill the gap left by the closure of D'Oyly Carte, and it has been held every August since then in England.&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;Lee, Bernard.

==History and description==

===Productions at the Gilbert and Sullivan Festival===
In 1995, the operators of the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival formed an opera company to provide festivalgoers with professional productions of the Savoy operas.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, Ted.

'''Omayra Sánchez Garzón''' (August 28, 1972&amp;nbsp;– November 16, 1985) was a 13-year-old Colombian girl killed in [[Armero]], [[Tolima Department|Tolima]], by the [[Armero tragedy|1985 eruption]] of the [[Nevado del Ruiz]] volcano. Volcanic debris mixed with ice to form massive [[lahar]]s (volcanically induced [[mudflow]]s, [[landslide]]s, and [[debris flow]]s) that rushed into the river valleys below the mountain, killing nearly 23,000 people and destroying Armero and 13 other villages.

After a lahar demolished her home, Sánchez was pinned beneath the debris of her house, where she remained trapped in water for three days. Her plight was documented as she descended from calmness into agony. Her courage and dignity touched journalists and relief workers, who put great efforts into comforting her. After 60 hours of struggling, she died, likely as a result of either [[gangrene]] or [[hypothermia]]. Her death highlighted the failure of officials to respond correctly to the threat of the volcano, contrasted with the efforts of volunteer rescue workers to reach and treat trapped victims, despite inadequate supplies and equipment.

A photograph of Sánchez taken by the photojournalist [[Frank Fournier]] shortly before she died was published in news outlets around the world.  It was later designated the [[World Press Photo of the Year]] for 1985. Sánchez has remained a lasting figure in popular culture, remembered through music, literature, and commemorative articles.

== Background ==
{{main article|Armero tragedy}}
On November 13, 1985, the [[Nevado del Ruiz]] volcano erupted. At 9:09 pm of that night, [[pyroclastic flow]]s exploding from the crater melted the mountain's icecap, forming lahars (volcanic mudflows and debris flows) which cascaded into river valleys below. One lahar, consisting of three pulses, did most of the damage. Traveling at {{convert|6|m|ft|0|sp=us}} per second, the first pulse enveloped most of the town of [[Armero]], killing up to 20,000 people; the two later pulses weakened buildings. Another lahar killed 1,800 people in nearby [[Chinchiná, Caldas|Chinchiná]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martí|Ernst|2005|p=291}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total 23,000 people were killed and 13 villages in addition to Armero were destroyed.&lt;ref name=MWJ&gt;{{cite news |title=Rescuers in Colombia refuse to give up hunt for survivors |date=November 18, 1985 |work=[[Milwaukee Journal]] |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Armero aftermath Marso.jpg|left|thumb|Formerly in the center of this area, the town of Armero was buried by thick volcanic mudflows in 1985.]]

Loss of life was exacerbated by the authorities' failure to take costly preventive measures in the absence of clear signs of imminent danger.&lt;ref name=Fielding/&gt; There had been no substantial eruption of the volcano since 1845, which contributed to complacency; locals called the volcano the "Sleeping Lion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=BBC:On this day: November 13: 1985: Volcano kills thousands in Colombia |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/13/newsid_2539000/2539731.stm | work=[[BBC News Online]]
|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=November 13, 1985 |accessdate=September 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1985, as earthquakes and [[phreatic eruption]]s rocked the area around the volcano, officials began planning for evacuation. A hazard map was prepared in October;{{#tag:ref|This was the first hazard map ever prepared for a [[List of volcanoes in Colombia|Colombian volcano]].&lt;ref name="Vil5" /&gt;|group=nb}} it highlighted the danger from falling ash and [[volcanic rock|rock]] near [[Murillo, Tolima|Murillo]], [[Santa Isabel, Tolima|Santa Isabel]], and [[Líbano, Tolima|Líbano]], as well as the threat of lahars in [[Mariquita, Tolima|Mariquita]], [[Armero-Guayabal|Guayabal]], Chinchiná, and Armero.&lt;ref name=MGueri&gt;{{cite web |url=http://desastres.unanleon.edu.ni/pdf/2004/octubre/PDF/ENG/DOC4377/doc4377-contenido.pdf |title=Eruption of El Ruiz Volcano, Colombia |last=Gueri |first=Miguel |date=October 2004 |publisher=[[National Autonomous University of Nicaragua]]-León. p. 50 |accessdate=July 22, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724143331/http://desastres.unanleon.edu.ni/pdf/2004/octubre/PDF/ENG/DOC4377/doc4377-contenido.pdf |archivedate=July 24, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The map was poorly distributed to those at highest risk: many survivors had never heard of it, though several major newspapers had featured it.&lt;ref name="Vil5"&gt;{{harvnb|Villegas|2003|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry Villegas of the Colombian Institute of Mining and Geology stated that the maps clearly demonstrated Armero would be affected by the lahars, but had "met with strong opposition from economic interests."&lt;ref name="Villegas6" /&gt; He said that the short time between the map's preparation and the eruption hindered timely distribution.&lt;ref name="Villegas6"&gt;{{harvnb|Villegas|2003|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Colombian Congress criticised scientific and [[civil defense]] agencies for scaremongering, and the government and army were preoccupied with the [[Colombian armed conflict (1964–present)|guerrilla campaign]] in [[Bogotá]], the national capital, which was then at its height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/volcanowatch/2009/09_10_29.html |author=Hawaiian Volcano Observatory |title=Lessons Learned from the Armero, Colombia Tragedy |date=November 29, 2009 |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] |accessdate=July 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The death toll was increased by the lack of early warnings,&lt;ref name=Fielding&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2001/volcanohelltrans.shtml |title=Volcano Hell Transcript |last=Fielding |first=Emma |work=[[BBC Television]] |publisher=[[BBC]] |accessdate=September 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; unwise land use, as villages were built in the likely path of lahars,&lt;ref name=Touret2004/&gt; and the lack of preparedness in communities near the volcano.&lt;ref name=Fielding/&gt; Colombia's worst natural disaster,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Staff |title=World News Briefs |url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/Newsbriefs/9511/11-14/index.html |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=November 14, 1995 |accessdate=September 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Armero tragedy]] (as it came to be known) was the second-deadliest volcanic disaster of the 20th century (surpassed only by the 1902 eruption of [[Mount Pelée]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/hazard/stratoguide/nevadofact.html |title=Nevado del Ruiz&amp;nbsp;– Facts and Figures |publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] |last=Staff |accessdate=September 3, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925165636/http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/hazard/stratoguide/nevadofact.html |archivedate=September 25, 2008 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the fourth-deadliest eruption recorded since 1500 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/LivingWith/VolcanicFacts/deadly_eruptions.html|title=Deadliest Volcanic Eruptions Since 1500 A.D.|last=Topinka |first=Lyn |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] |accessdate=September 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its lahars were the deadliest in volcanic history.&lt;ref name=Huggel2007/&gt;

== Life ==
Omayra Sánchez lived in the neighborhood of Santander&lt;ref name="Sangre" /&gt; with her parents Álvaro Enrique, a rice and [[sorghum]] collector, and María Aleida, along with her brother Álvaro Enrique&lt;ref name=DG/&gt; and aunt María Adela Garzón.&lt;ref name="Sangre"&gt;{{harvnb|Barragán|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lp/&gt;  Prior to the eruption, her mother had traveled to Bogotá on business.&lt;ref name="SA" /&gt; The night of the disaster, Omayra and her family were awake, worrying about the ashfall from the eruption, when they heard the sound of an approaching lahar.&lt;ref name="Sangre" /&gt; After it hit, Omayra became trapped under her home's concrete and other debris and could not free herself. When rescue teams tried to help her, they realized that her legs were trapped under her house's roof.&lt;ref name=DG&gt;{{cite news |title=Trapped Girl, 13, Dies |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, Jr.]] |date=November 17, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SA" /&gt; Sources differ as to the degree to which Sánchez was trapped. Zeiderman (2009) said she was "trapped up to her neck",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zeiderman|2009|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Barragán (1987) said that she was trapped up to her waist.&lt;ref name="Sangre" /&gt;

For the first few hours after the mudflow hit, she was covered by concrete but got her hand through a crack in the debris. After a rescuer noticed her hand protruding from a pile of debris, he and others cleared tiles and wood over the course of a day. Once the girl was freed from the waist up, her rescuers attempted to pull her out, but found the task impossible without breaking her legs in the process. Each time a person pulled her, the water pooled around her, rising so that it seemed she would drown if they let her go, so rescue workers placed a tire around her body to keep her afloat. Divers discovered that Sánchez's legs were caught under a door made of bricks, with her aunt's arms clutched tightly around her legs and feet.&lt;ref name="Sangre" /&gt;

== Death ==
{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#F5F6CE |salign=left| quote = Colombia and half of the world remained with the bitter sensation that Omayra Sánchez could have been able to continue living after remaining for almost 60 hours trapped from head to toe amidst the rubble of Armero. Her face, her words, and her courage, which streamed throughout the world on television and were a heartbreaking image in the largest newspapers and magazines of the United States and Europe, remained a testimony of accusation against those who could have at the very least made the tragedy less serious.

Despite her predicament, Sánchez remained relatively positive: she sang to [[Germán Santa María Barragán]], a journalist who was working as a volunteer,&lt;ref name="SA" /&gt; asked for sweet food, drank soda,&lt;ref name="Sangre" /&gt; and agreed to be interviewed. At times, she was scared, and prayed or cried.&lt;ref name=JSOURCE&gt;{{cite news |publisher=[[Canadian Journalism Foundation]] |work=Canadian Journalism Project |last=Lacey |first=Dana |title=Why We Don't Cover Pakistan |date=August 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the third night, Sánchez began [[hallucination|hallucinating]], saying that she did not want to be late for school,&lt;ref name=picp/&gt; and mentioned a maths exam.&lt;ref name="SA"&gt;{{harvnb|Barragán|1994|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Near the end of her life, Sánchez's eyes reddened, her face swelled, and her hands whitened. At one point she asked the people to leave her so they could rest. Hours later the workers returned with a pump and tried to save her, but her legs were bent under the concrete as if she was kneeling, and it was impossible to free her without severing her legs. Lacking the surgical equipment to save her from the effects of an amputation, the doctors present agreed that it would be more humane to let her die.&lt;ref name="Sangre" /&gt; In all, Sánchez suffered for nearly three nights (roughly 60 hours) before she died at approximately 10:05 A.M.&lt;ref name="Sangre" /&gt; on November 16 from exposure,&lt;ref name=picp&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4231020.stm |title=Picture power: Tragedy of Omayra Sanchez |date=September 30, 2005 |work=[[BBC News Online]] | publisher= [[BBC]] |accessdate=September 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; most likely from [[gangrene]] or [[hypothermia]].&lt;ref name=JSOURCE/&gt;

Her brother survived the lahars; her father and aunt died. Her mother expressed her feelings about Omayra's death: "It is horrible, but we have to think about the living&amp;nbsp;... I will live for my son, who only lost a finger."&lt;ref name=DG/&gt;&lt;ref name=lp&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=TX5WAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=QEENAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3684,440325 |title=Ordeal Ends in Death |work=[[Leader-Post]] |publisher=Postmedia Network Inc. |date=November 18, 1985 |accessdate=April 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the public became aware of Sánchez's situation through the media, her death became a symbol of the failure of officials to properly assist victims who could have been saved.&lt;ref name="ZA13" /&gt; Controversy broke out after descriptions of the shortages were released in newspapers, disproving what officials had previously indicated: that they had used the best of their supplies. Volunteer relief workers said that there was such a lack of resources that supplies as basic as shovels, cutting tools, and stretchers ran out. The rescue process was impeded by large crowds and disorganization. An unnamed police officer said that the government should have depended on human resources to alleviate the problems and that the system of rescue was disorganized.&lt;ref name=S-N&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fbdQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3RMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5678,7662718&amp; |title=Colombian officials defend rescue effort; lack of equipment blamed |work=[[Star-News]] |publisher=Bob Gruber |date=November 24, 1985 |accessdate=November 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colombia's Minister of Defense, Miguel Uribe, said he "understood criticism of the rescue effort",&lt;ref name=S-N/&gt; but said that Colombia was "an undeveloped country" that did not "have that kind of equipment."&lt;ref name=S-N/&gt;

== Photograph ==
Frank Fournier, a French reporter who landed in Bogotá on November 15, took a photograph of Sánchez in her final days, titled "The Agony of Omayra Sánchez".&lt;ref name=ottawa&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Mq8yAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=me8FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3433,3016148 |title=Ottawa Man Third |date=February 7, 1986 |accessdate=April 19, 2011 |work=[[Ottawa Citizen]] |publisher=James Orban}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he reached Armero at dawn on the 16th, a farmer directed him to Sánchez, who by then had been trapped for nearly three days and was near-deserted. Fournier later described the town as "very haunting," with "eerie silence" punctuated by screaming.&lt;ref name=picp/&gt; He said that he took the photograph feeling that he could only "report properly on the courage and the suffering and the dignity of the little girl" in his attempt to publicize the disaster's need for relief efforts,&lt;ref name=picp/&gt; feeling otherwise "powerless".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zeiderman|2009|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, there was international awareness of the disaster. Sánchez was one of the victims at the center of the associated controversy over responsibility for the destructive aftermath. The image captured international attention. According to an unnamed BBC reporter, "Many were appalled at witnessing so intimately what transpired to be the last few hours of Omayra's life."&lt;ref name=picp/&gt; After the photo was published in ''[[Paris Match]],'' many accused Fournier of being "a vulture." He responded, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I felt the story was important for me to report and I was happier that there was some reaction; it would have been worse if people had not cared about it.&amp;nbsp;... I believe the photo helped raise money from around the world in aid and helped highlight the irresponsibility and lack of courage of the country's leaders." &lt;ref name=picp/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The picture later won the [[World Press Photo of the Year]] for 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PEYsAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=2s4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6813,1694667 |title=World Photo Award |date=February 7, 1986 |accessdate=April 19, 2011 |work=[[Spartanburg Herald-Journal]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
The Armero catastrophe came shortly after the [[19th of April Movement|M-19]] guerrilla group's raid and subsequent [[Palace of Justice siege]] on November 6, worsening an already chaotic situation. After Sánchez's death, blame for it and for the Armero tragedy fell on the Colombian government for its inaction and general indifference to warning signs prior to the volcano's eruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geology.sdsu.edu/how_volcanoes_work/Nevado.html |title=Nevado del Ruiz (1985) |last=Camp |first=Vic |publisher=[[San Diego State University]] |date=March 31, 2006 |accessdate=September 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nevado del Ruiz volcano is still active, according to the Volcano Watch Center in Colombia. Melting only 10 percent of the ice would produce mudflows with a volume of up to {{convert|200000000|m3|cuft|sigfig=3|sp=us}}—similar to the mudflow that destroyed Armero in 1985.&lt;ref name=Huggel2007&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Huggel |first1=Cristian |last2=Ceballos |first2=Jorge Luis |last3=Pulgarín |first3=Bernardo |last4=Ramírez |first4=Jair |last5=Thouret |first5=Jean-Claude |title=Review and reassessment of hazards owing to volcano–glacier interactions in Colombia |year=2007 |volume=45 |journal=Annals of Glaciology |pages=128–136 |url=http://www.igsoc.org/annals/45/a45A019.pdf |doi=10.3189/172756407782282408 |format=pdf |accessdate=April 20, 2011 |bibcode = 2007AnGla..45..128H }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such [[lahar]]s can travel up to {{convert|100|km|mi|0|sp=us}} along river valleys in a few hours.&lt;ref name=Huggel2007/&gt; Estimates show that up to 500,000 people living in the Combeima, Chinchiná, Coello-Toche, and Guali valleys are at risk, and 100,000 of these are considered to be at high risk.&lt;ref name=Thouret&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Thouret |first1=Jean-Claude |last2=Murcia |first2=A |last3=Salinas |first3=R. |last4=Parra |first4=E. |last5=Cepeda |first5=H. |last6=Cantagrel |first6=J-M. |title=Stratigraphy and quaternary eruptive history of the Ruiz-Tolima volcanic massif, Colombia.

The site was commemorated as a memorial with [[Christian cross]]es and a small monument to Sánchez.&lt;ref name=TJ&gt;{{cite news|title=Survivors of avalanche relive tragedy through TV movie |last=Johnson |first=Tim |date=September 18, 1997 |work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] |publisher=[[Journal Communications]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years following the eruption, Sánchez has been repeatedly commemorated, especially in newspapers like ''El Tiempo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zeiderman|2009|pp=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many victims of the disaster were commemorated, but Sánchez in particular has attracted lasting attention in popular poetry, novels, and music.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zeiderman|2009|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a [[punk rock]] band formed in Chile in 2008 named themselves Omayra Sánchez; they express their "discontent that they feel with the negligence on the part of the people who in this day and age run the world".&lt;ref name="ZA13"&gt;{{harvnb|Zeiderman|2009|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Adiós, Omayra: La catástrofe de Armero'' (1988), written by [[Eduardo Santa]] as a response to the eruption, depicts the girl's last days of life in detail and cites her in its introduction as an eternal symbol of the catastrophe.&lt;ref name="ZA13" /&gt; In ''No Morirás'' (1994), Germán Santa María Barragán writes that of all the horrors he saw at Armero, nothing was more painful than seeing the face of Omayra Sánchez under the ruins of her house.&lt;ref name="SA" /&gt; [[Isabel Allende]]'s [[short story]], "And of Clay Are We Created" ("De barro estamos hechos"), is told from the perspective of a reporter who tries to help a girl trapped under the fireplace of her ruined home. Allende later wrote, "Her [Sánchez's] big black eyes, filled with resignation and wisdom, still pursue me in my dreams. Writing the story failed to exorcise her ghost."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Correas de Zapata |Sayers Peden|2002|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To try to prevent repetition of such a disaster, the government of Colombia created the ''Oficina Nacional para la Atención de Desastres'' (National Office for Disaster Preparedness), now known as the ''Dirección de Prevención y Atención de Desastres'' (Directorate for Disaster Prevention and Preparedness).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dnp.gov.co/PortalWeb/Programas/ViviendaAguaDesarrolloUrbanoAmbiente/Gesti%C3%B3ndelRiesgo/Direcci%C3%B3ndePrevenci%C3%B3nyAtenci%C3%B3ndeDesastres.aspx |title=Dirección de Prevención y Atención de Desastres — DPAD |date=June 24, 2010 |publisher=Departamento Nacional de Planeación, República de Colombia |accessdate=September 1, 2010 |language=Spanish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002214757/http://www.dnp.gov.co/PortalWeb/Programas/ViviendaAguaDesarrolloUrbanoAmbiente/Gesti%C3%B3ndelRiesgo/Direcci%C3%B3ndePrevenci%C3%B3nyAtenci%C3%B3ndeDesastres.aspx |archivedate=October 2, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; All Colombian cities were directed to plan for natural disasters.&lt;ref name=Touret2004&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Touret |first1=Jean-Claude |last2=Laforge |first2=Christophe |title=Hazard Appraisal and Hazard-Zone Mapping of Flooding and Debris Flowage in the Rio Combeima Valley and Ibague City, Tolima Department, Colombia |journal=GeoJournal |year=1994 |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=407–413 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/j7h51t87x7201375 |accessdate=August 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''"Power of Women"''' (''Weibermacht'' in German) is a medieval and Renaissance artistic and [[literary topos]], showing "heroic or wise men dominated by women", presenting "an admonitory and often humorous inversion of the male-dominated sexual hierarchy".&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;  It was defined by [[Susan L. Smith]] as "the representational practice of bringing together at least two, but usually more, well-known figures from the Bible, ancient history, or romance to exemplify a cluster of interrelated themes that include the wiles of women, the power of love, and the trials of marriage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Babinsky|first=Elen L.|year=1997|title=Rev. of Smith, ''The Power of Women'' |journal=[[American Society of Church History |Church History]] |volume=66 |issue=2 |pages=340–341 |doi=10.2307/3170688 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=2298424}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Smith argues that the topos is not simply a "straightforward manifestation of medieval antifeminism"; rather, it is "a site of contest through which conflicting ideas about gender roles could be expressed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Susan L.|editor=Margaret Schaus|title=Women and Gender in Medieval Europe: An Encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aDhOv6hgN2IC&amp;pg=PA845 |year=2006|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-0415969444 |pages=844–845}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''c.f.'' Nurse p. 1, who characterises it as arising from the complex religious and social turmoil provoked by the European Reformation of the sixteenth century.&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith argues the topos originates in classical literature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Millett |first=Bella |date=22 September 1997 |title=Rev. of Smith, ''The Power of Women'' |journal=[[Medium Aevum]] |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+Power+of+Women%3A+A+%27Topos%27+in+Medieval+Art+and+Literature.-a020331549}}&lt;/ref&gt; and finds it in medieval texts such as ''[[Aucassin et Nicolette]]'', ''[[The Consolation of Philosophy]]'', the ''[[Roman de la Rose]]'', and the ''[[Canterbury Tales]]''.&lt;ref name=Harp208&gt;Harp p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;  The topos was attacked by [[Christine de Pizan]] around 1400, who argued that if women wrote these accounts their interpretations would be different from those of men.&lt;ref name= Wolfthal&gt;Wolfthal p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

In the visual arts, images are found in various media, mainly from the 14th century onwards, and becoming increasingly popular in the 15th century. By then the frequently recurring subjects include [[Judith beheading Holofernes]], [[The tale of Phyllis and Aristotle|Phyllis riding Aristotle]], [[Samson in popular culture#Art|Samson and Delilah]], [[Salome]] and her mother [[Herodias]], [[Jael]] killing [[Sisera]], [[Bathsheba]] bathing in sight of [[David]], the idolatry of [[Solomon]], [[Virgil in his basket]], as well as many depictions of witches, and genre images of wives dominating their husbands. The last group came to be called the '''battle for the trousers'''.&lt;ref&gt;Salomon, 87; "''strijd om de broek''" in sixteenth century Netherlandish literature and printmaking.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph (patriarch)|Joseph]] and [[Potiphar|Potiphar's wife]] and [[Lot (biblical person)#Lot and his daughters|Lot and his Daughters]] were somewhat late joiners to the group, but increasingly popular later on.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, pp. 147–148, Nos 20–32 (Judith), 87–110, 120–125; Ainsworth, pp. 59–66; Salomon, pp. 87–88; Hall, 41–42&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tomyris]], the [[Scythian]] queen who defeated [[Cyrus the Great]] and abused his corpse, was painted by Rubens and several Italians.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 305&lt;/ref&gt;

These scenes, mostly shown in consistent compositions involving just two persons and visually distinctive actions, were easily recognisable and seem to have also been represented dramatically in entertainments of various sorts, whether as short scenes or [[tableaux vivants]].&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, 461&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not clear who first coined the term ''Weibermacht'', but it had evidently gained currency in the sixteenth century [[Northern Renaissance]] in Germany and the Low Countries.&lt;ref&gt;Nurse p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visual arts==

In early images from the Gothic period genre subjects or "classical" ones such as ''Phyllis Riding Aristotle'' and ''Virgil in his Basket'', in fact both medieval legendary accretions, were more popular than the biblical ones predominating later. They often appear on the same pieces as the [[Assault on the Castle of Love]], as on a [[Casket with Scenes of Romances (Walters 71264)|casket in Baltimore]]. This and similar subjects of [[courtly love]] mostly survive on ivory objects for female use, such as caskets or mirror-cases. It shows ladies defending a castle against men, generally unsuccessfully.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:A woman defends her castle.jpg|But not always]]. More typically the only real resistance is Cupid firing arrows.&lt;/ref&gt; These images are essentially light-hearted romantic fantasy given a comic treatment; such scenes were sometimes staged as light relief at [[tournament]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Sherman Loomis|Loomis, Roger Sherman]], "The Allegorical Siege in the Art of the Middle Ages", ''American Journal of Archaeology'', Vol. 23, No. 3 (Jul.–Sep., 1919), pp.&amp;nbsp;255–269,[https://www.jstor.org/stable/497460 JSTOR (free)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Power of Women theme is especially popular in [[Northern Renaissance]] art from the sixteenth century, which depicts "images drawn from historical, mythological, and biblical sources that illustrate women's power over men, specifically as a result of their sexual attractiveness".&lt;ref&gt;Salomon, 87&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the stories involve the killing of the male, and this and their religious context effectively remove much of the comic potential of the group, but by no means the erotic possibilites exploited by many artists.

The question of the attitudes shown towards violence by women in the cause of virtue is perhaps best seen in the figure of [[Jael]], whose killing of Sisera by hammering a tent peg into his head makes an especially graphic image. According to some feminist critics, depictions of her turned hostile in the Renaissance, and like Judith she is certainly grouped with "bad" figures such as Herodias and Delilah. Yet she was included, with Judith and Esther, as one of [[Hans Burgkmair]]'s "Drei Gut Judin" ("Three Good Jewesses") trio of Biblical heroines in his ''Eighteen Worthies'', adding nine women to the traditional male [[Nine Worthies]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell, 29&amp;ndash;39, No 1; Wolfthal, Diane (October 2000).

[[File:Artemisia Gentileschi - Giuditta decapita Oloferne - Google Art Project-Adjust.jpg|thumb|left|260px|[[Artemisia Gentileschi]], ''[[Judith Slaying Holofernes (Artemisia Gentileschi)|Judith killing Holofernes]]'', version in Florence, 1621]]

The Power of Women subjects are seen in painting and other media, but [[old master print|prints]] were their special home. [[Lucas van Leyden]] made two sets of [[woodcut]]s known as ''[[Lucas van Leyden|The Large and Small Power of Women]]''. The subjects featured include [[Adam and Eve]], Samson and Delilah, King Solomon, [[Herod the Great|Herod]] and Herodias, Jael and Sisera, and, less usually, [[Jezebel]] and [[Ahab|King Ahab]]. The woodcuts have somewhat static compositions, and it has been suggested that they draw from [[tableaux vivants]] of the scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, pp. 119, 153, Large: Nos 90, 96, 100; Small: Nos 66, 92; Snyder, 461-462. The small set, of 1516&amp;ndash;19 included the scenes with Eve, Jael, Delilah, Solomon, Jezebel and Herodias, the large set of c. 1512 added Virgil and the legend of the ''[[Bocca della Verità]]'' or "Mouth of Truth" in Rome. The ''Aristotle and Phyllis'' of c. 1515 is in the same format but may be a later addition. Since no museum has a full set on the same paper they may have been sold mainly singly.&lt;/ref&gt; Another set by [[Hans Burgkmair]] (1519) is known as the ''Liebestorheiten'' or ''Follies of Love''.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, p. 160, Nos 94, 97. This set contains: ''Samson and Delilah'', Bathsheba and David, The Idolatry of Solomon, and Phyllis riding Aristotle.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time there was also an interest, often among the same artists, in women from similar settings who were powerless, or only able to escape their situations by suicide, such as [[Susanna (Book of Daniel)|Susanna]], [[Dido of Carthage]], [[Lucretia]], and [[Verginia]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Nos 1&amp;ndash;14&lt;/ref&gt; The story of [[Esther]] lay somewhere between these two extremes.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Nos 1, 15, 16&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Little Masters]] were among those artists greatly interested in both groups. The treatment of both groups, especially in prints, was often frankly erotic, and these groups took their place alongside female saints and lovers both mythological and realistic in the common treatments of women in art. Interest in such themes spread to Italy, affecting [[Venice]] first, and the subjects became common in Late Renaissance Italian painting, and even more so during the Baroque, perhaps culminating in the work of [[Artemisia Gentileschi]], who painted nearly all the biblical Power of Women subjects, most more than once. While her choice of subjects is assumed to be driven by her difficult life, [[Cristofano Allori]]'s best known work, ''Judith with the Head of Holofernes'', uses as models his former mistress for [[Book of Judith|Judith]], with her mother as the maid, and a self-portrait for the head of [[Holofernes]].&lt;ref&gt;Lucy Whitaker, Martin Clayton, ''The Art of Italy in the Royal Collection; Renaissance and Baroque'', p.270, Royal Collection Publications, 2007, {{ISBN|9781902163291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Northern painting, the Cranachs were the first artists to paint the subjects often.&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; In 1513 [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] decorated the nuptial bed of [[John, Elector of Saxony]] with a set of scenes including ''The Idolatry of Solomon'' as well as ''[[Hercules]] and [[Omphale]]'' (see below) and the ''[[Judgement of Paris]]''. The respective sons of the patron and artist, [[John Frederick I, Elector of Saxony]] and [[Lucas Cranach the Younger]], generated another set of paintings, now in the [[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister]].&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility has been raised that some of the Cranach workshop's many ''Judith''s are portraits of ladies at the Saxon court;&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth, pp. 63&amp;ndash;66&lt;/ref&gt; some other paintings of Jael certainly are portraits.

===Themes and context===
[[File:Lucas van Leyden Arisztotelész és Phyllis.jpg|thumb|left|''Phyllis Riding Aristotle'', [[Lucas van Leyden]]]]
Several of these subjects contain a part-comical element of [[role reversal]] in a society that was essentially patriarchal, above all the "quintessential image from the Power of Women topos, ''Phyllis Riding Aristotle''."&lt;ref&gt;Russell, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; The story of Phyllis and Aristotle dates from the early 13th century (when the ''Lai d'Aristote'' was written) and became the subject of popular poems, plays and moralizing sermons.&lt;ref&gt;Boitani &amp; Torti p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; The theme was first analysed by [[Natalie Zemon Davis]] in 1975,&lt;ref&gt;"Women on Top" in her ''Society and Culture in Early Modern France: Eight Essays, Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 1975''&lt;/ref&gt; who concluded that the "overall functions" of these reversals was that "they afforded an expression of, and an outlet for, conflicts about authority within the system; and they also provided occasions by which the authoritarian current in family, workshop, and political life could be moderated by the laughter of disorder and paradoxical play. Accordingly they served to reinforce hierarchical structure".&lt;ref&gt;Natalie Zemon Davis, "Women on Top", quoted by Russell, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; The role reversal subject of [[Hercules]] and [[Omphale]] did not fit the main Power of Women trope, as Hercules' period serving Omphale was not caused by interaction between them, and they later married. It became popular from the 16th century, and the Cranach family painted many versions showing Omphale and her ladies dressing Hercules in drag.&lt;ref&gt;For a long analysis of the theme, see Rosenthal, Lisa, "Hercules' Distaff", especially p. 128 ff, in ''Gender, Politics, and Allegory in the Art of Rubens'', 2005, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0521842441}}, 9780521842440, [https://books.google.com/books?id=tIa0iUVpGbcC&amp;pg=PA128 Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Phyllis Riding Aristotle'' was painted on the walls of several German [[town hall]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Russell, p. 150; Parshall, pp. 234-235&lt;/ref&gt; though the design [[Albrecht Dürer]] made for [[Nuremberg]], as part of a Power of Women cycle, was never carried out.&lt;ref&gt;Foister p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Some sets of prints have ornamental borders that suggest they were intended to be pasted to walls, as many larger prints were. While many of the smaller prints were probably mostly seen by male collectors and their friends, these paintings and wall-mounted prints "must have been intended to entertain or amuse both men and women".&lt;ref&gt;Russell, p. 150; Parshall, pp. 234&amp;ndash;235. Dürer's [[watercolour]] design is in the [[Morgan Library]] ([[:File:Albrecht Dürer - Design for Decoration of the Town Hall of Nuremberg.jpg|see Commons image]]), and has roundels with Bathsheba and David, [[Samson and Delilah (disambiguation)|Samson and Delilah]], and Phyllis riding Aristotle.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the Florentine [[Otto prints]], essentially designed for a female audience, show women triumphing over men, though most show pacific scenes of lovers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=756921&amp;partId=1 example, British Museum]. This collection, in the [[British Museum]] is the pattern book of a workshop probably making inserts for small boxes of sweet delicacies such as were given to the guests at weddings.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other large prints intended for walls, where Power of Women subjects are especially common, adopt a different type of composition from the small prints with a few figures, showing large and well-populated panoramic scenes where the key figures can be hard to pick out. ''David and Bathsheba'' or Salome's story are set amid wide townscapes, and Judith kills Holofernes in a corner of a huge battle scene in front of a walled city.&lt;ref&gt;Bartrum, p. 154, Nos. 96, 158, 160; Parshall, pp. 234-235&lt;/ref&gt;

The association of witchcraft specifically and almost exclusively with women was a novelty of the late 15th century, for which the book ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'' (1486) remains an emblem, though its significance has been questioned. The interpretation of the many images of witches has been the subject of considerable scholarly interest in recent decades, and many differing interpretations have been put forward. As well as allowing scope for imaginative fantasy, an erotic element is clear, above all in the work of [[Hans Baldung Grien]], the artist most associated with the subject. The seriousness with which either the artist or their audience took the reality of witchcraft has been questioned; to some extent these seem to have been the [[horror movie]]s of their day.&lt;ref&gt;Zika, Charles, "Images of Witchcraft in Early Modern Europe", in Levack, Brian P. (ed), ''The Oxford Handbook of Witchcraft in Early Modern Europe and Colonial America'', 2013, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0199578168}}, 9780199578160, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Lum96_FPZp0C&amp;pg=PA143 Google Books]; Russell, pp. 14, 147&amp;ndash;148, Nos 103&amp;ndash;105; Harbison, Craig.

This is an excerpt from the original script of ''[[Natural Born Killers]]'' by [[Quentin Tarantino]].]] --&gt;
'''Screenwriting''', also called '''scriptwriting''', is the art and craft of writing [[Screenplay|scripts]] for [[mass media]] such as [[feature film]]s, [[television production]]s or [[video game]]s. It is often a [[freelance]] profession.

[[Screenwriter]]s are responsible for researching the story, developing the narrative, writing the script, screenplay, dialogues and delivering it, in the required format, to development executives. Screenwriters therefore have great influence over the creative direction and emotional impact of the screenplay and, arguably, of the finished film. Screenwriters either pitch original ideas to producers, in the hope that they will be optioned or sold; or are commissioned by a producer to create a screenplay from a concept, true story, existing screen work or literary work, such as a novel, poem, play, comic book, or short story.

==Types==
The act of screenwriting takes many forms across the entertainment industry. Often, multiple writers work on the same script at different stages of [[Script development|development]] with different tasks. Over the course of a successful career, a screenwriter might be hired to write in a wide variety of roles.

Some of the most common forms of screenwriting jobs include:

===Spec script writing===
[[Spec script]]s are feature film or [[Television program|television show]] scripts written on speculation of sale, without the commission of a [[film studio]], [[production company]] or TV network. The content is usually invented solely by the screenwriter, though spec screenplays can also be based on established works or real people and events. The spec script is a Hollywood sales tool. The vast majority of scripts written each year are spec scripts, but only a small percentage make it to the screen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/movies/267279_screenplay07.html The Great American Screenplay now fuels wannabe authors&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] from seattlepi.nwsource.com&lt;/ref&gt; A spec script is usually a wholly original work, but can also be an [[Film adaptation|adaptation]].

In television writing, a spec script is a sample teleplay written to demonstrate the writer's knowledge of a show and ability to imitate its style and conventions. It is submitted to the show's producers in hopes of being hired to write future episodes of the show. Budding screenwriters attempting to break into the business generally begin by writing one or more spec scripts.

Although writing spec scripts is part of any writer's career, the [[Writers Guild of America]] forbids members to write "on speculation". The distinction is that a "spec script" is written as a sample by the writer on his or her own; what is forbidden is writing a script for a specific producer without a contract. In addition to writing a script on speculation, it is generally not advised to write camera angles or other directional terminology, as these are likely to be ignored. A director may write up a shooting script himself or herself, a script that guides the team in what to do in order to carry out the director's vision of how the script should look. The director may ask the original writer to co-write it with him or her, or to rewrite a script that satisfies both the director and producer of the film/TV show.

Spec writing is also unique in that the writer must pitch the idea to producers. In order to sell the script, it must have a killer title, good writing, and a great logline. A logline is one sentence that lays out what the movie is about. A well written logline will convey the tone of the film, introduce the main character, and touch on the primary conflict. Usually the logline and title work in tandem to draw people in, and it is highly suggested to incorporate irony into them when possible. These things, along with nice, clean writing will hugely impact whether or not a producer picks up the spec script.

=== Commissioned screenplay ===
A commissioned screenplay is written by a hired writer. The concept is usually developed long before the screenwriter is brought on, and often has multiple writers work on it before the script is given a [[Green-light|green light]].

===Feature assignment writing===
Scripts written on assignment are screenplays created under contract with a [[Movie studio|studio]], production company, or producer. These are the most common assignments sought after in screenwriting. A screenwriter can get an assignment either exclusively or from "open" assignments. A screenwriter can also be approached and offered an assignment. Assignment scripts are generally adaptations of an existing idea or property owned by the hiring company,&lt;ref&gt;Lydia Willen and Joan Willen, ''How to Sell your Screenplay'', pg 242. Square One Publishers, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; but can also be original works based on a concept created by the writer or producer.

===Rewriting and script doctoring===
Most produced films are rewritten to some extent during the development process. Frequently, they are not rewritten by the original writer of the script.&lt;ref&gt;Skip Press, ''The Ultimate Writer's Guide to Hollywood'', pg xiii. Barnes and Noble Books, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Many established screenwriters, as well as new writers whose work shows promise but lacks marketability, make their living rewriting scripts.

When a script's central premise or characters are good but the script is otherwise unusable, a different writer or team of writers is contracted to do an entirely new draft, often referred to as a "page one rewrite". {{anchor|polish}}When only small problems remain, such as bad dialogue or poor humor, a writer is hired to do a "polish" or "punch-up".

Depending on the size of the new writer's contributions, [[screen credit]] may or may not be given. For instance, in the American film industry, credit to rewriters is given only if 50% or more of the script is substantially changed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wga.org/subpage_writersresources.aspx?id=171-screen credits policy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} from wga.org&lt;/ref&gt; These standards can make it difficult to establish the identity and number of screenwriters who contributed to a film's creation.

When established writers are called in to rewrite portions of a script late in the development process, they are commonly referred to as [[script doctor]]s. Prominent script doctors include Christopher Keane, [[Steve Zaillian]], [[William Goldman]], [[Robert Towne]], [[Mort Nathan]], Quentin Tarantino and Peter Russell.&lt;ref&gt;Virginia Wright Wetman. "Success Has 1,000 Fathers (So Do Films)". ''[[The New York Times]]''. May 28, 1995. Arts section, p.16.&lt;/ref&gt; Many up-and-coming screenwriters work as ghost writers.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===Television writing===
A freelance television writer typically uses spec scripts or previous credits and reputation to obtain a contract to write one or more episodes for an existing television show. After an episode is submitted, rewriting or polishing may be required.

A staff writer for a TV show generally works in-house, writing and rewriting episodes. Staff writers&amp;mdash;often given other titles, such as [[story editor]] or [[Television producer|producer]]&amp;mdash;work both as a group and individually on episode scripts to maintain the show's tone, style, characters, and plots.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvwriter.com/faq/faq.htm TV Writer.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929034952/http://www.tvwriter.com/faq/faq.htm |date=2007-09-29 }} from tvwriter.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Television show creators write the [[television pilot]] and [[Bible (screenwriting)|bible]] of new television series. They are responsible for creating and managing all aspects of a show's characters, style, and plots. Frequently, a creator remains responsible for the show's day-to-day creative decisions throughout the series run as [[showrunner]], [[head writer]] or story editor.

====Writing for daily series====
The process of writing for [[soap opera]]s and [[telenovela]]s is different from that used by [[prime time]] shows, due in part to the need to produce new episodes five days a week for several months. In one example cited by [[Jane Espenson]], screenwriting is a "sort of three-tiered system":&lt;ref name="jane"&gt;[http://www.janeespenson.com/archives/00000588.php 08/13/2008: Soapy Scenes], from "Jane in Progress" a blog for aspiring screenwriters by Jane Espenson&lt;/ref&gt;
:a few top writers craft the overall [[story arc]]s. Mid-level writers work with them to turn those arcs into things that look a lot like traditional episode outlines, and an array of writers below that (who do not even have to be local to Los Angeles), take those outlines and quickly generate the dialogue while adhering slavishly to the outlines.

Espenson notes that a recent trend has been to eliminate the role of the mid-level writer, relying on the senior writers to do rough outlines and giving the other writers a bit more freedom. Regardless, when the finished scripts are sent to the top writers, the latter do a final round of rewrites. Espenson also notes that a show that airs daily, with characters who have decades of history behind their voices, necessitates a writing staff without the distinctive voice that can sometimes be present in prime-time series.&lt;ref name="jane"/&gt;

====Writing for game shows====

Game shows feature live contestants, but still use a team of writers as part of a specific format.&lt;ref name="WGA"&gt;[http://www.wga.org/content/default.aspx?id=2630 05/15/2010: Writers Guild of America, Reality &amp; Game Show Writers]&lt;/ref&gt; This may involve the slate of questions and even specific phrasing or dialogue on the part of the host. Writers may not script the dialogue used by the contestants, but they work with the producers to create the actions, scenarios, and sequence of events that support the game show's concept.

===Video game writing===
{{Main|Video game writing}}
With the continued development and increased complexity of video games, many opportunities are available to employ screenwriters in the field of [[video game design]]. Video game writers work closely with the other game designers to create characters, scenarios, and dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;Skip Press, ''The Ultimate Writer's Guide to Hollywood'', pg207. Barnes and Noble Books, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories on writing a screenplay==
{{Literature}}
Fundamentally, the screenplay is a unique literary form. It is like a musical score, in that it is intended to be interpreted on the basis of other artists' performance, rather than serving as a finished product for the enjoyment of its audience. For this reason, a screenplay is written using technical jargon and tight, spare prose when describing stage directions. Unlike a [[novel]] or [[short story]], a screenplay focuses on describing the literal, visual aspects of the story, rather than on the internal thoughts of its characters. In screenwriting, the aim is to evoke those thoughts and emotions through subtext, action, and [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]].&lt;ref&gt;Trottier, David: "The Screenwriter's Bible", pg4. Silman James, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several main screenwriting theories help writers approach the screenplay by systematizing the structure, goals and techniques of writing a script. The most common kinds of theories are structural. Screenwriter William Goldman is widely quoted as saying "Screenplays are structure".

===Three-act structure===
{{Main article|Three-act structure}}
The three acts are setup (of the location and characters), confrontation (with an obstacle), and resolution (culminating in a climax and a dénouement). Usually, in a two-hour film, the first and third acts both typically last around 30 minutes, with the middle act lasting roughly an hour, but today many films start from the confrontation point and then goes to the setup act or they might even start at the last act and then go back to the start.

In ''[[Writing Drama]]'', French writer and director [[Yves Lavandier]] shows a slightly different approach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clown-enfant.com/leclown/eng/drama/livre.htm#1STRUC Excerpt on the three-act structure] from Yves Lavandier's ''Writing Drama''&lt;/ref&gt; As do most theorists, he maintains that every human action, whether fictitious or real, contains three logical parts: before the action, during the action, and after the action. But since the climax is part of the action, Yves Lavandier maintains that the second act must include the climax, which makes for a much shorter third act than is found in most screenwriting theories.

Besides the three-act structure, it is also common to use a four- or five-act structure in a screenplay, though certain screenplays may include as many as twenty separate acts.

=== The Hero's Journey ===
The hero's journey, also referred to as the [[monomyth]], is an idea formulated by noted mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]]. The central concept of the monomyth is that a pattern can be seen in stories and myths across history. Campbell defined and explained that pattern in his book ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'' (1949).

Campbell's insight was that important myths from around the world, which have survived for thousands of years, all share a fundamental structure. This fundamental structure contains a number of stages, which include
#'''a call to adventure''', which the hero has to accept or decline,
#'''a road of trials''', on which the hero succeeds or fails,
#'''achieving the goal (or "boon")''', which often results in important self-knowledge,
#'''a return to the ordinary world''', which again the hero can succeed or fail, and
#'''application of the boon,''' in which what the hero has gained can be used to improve the world.

Later, screenwriter [[Christopher Vogler]] refined and expanded the hero's journey for the screenplay form in his book, ''[[The Writer's Journey: Mythic Structure for Writers]]'' (1993).

=== Syd Field's Paradigm ===
In his book ''Screenplay'' [[Syd Field]] posited a new theory, which he called the Paradigm. Field noticed that in a 120-page screenplay, Act Two was notoriously boring, and was also twice the length of Acts One and Three. He also noticed that an important dramatic event usually occurred at the middle of the picture, which implied to him that the middle act was actually two acts in one. So the Three Act Structure is notated 1, 2a, 2b, 3, resulting in [[Aristotle]]'s Three Acts divided into four pieces.

Field also introduced the idea of [[plot point|Plot Points]] into screenwriting theory. Plot Points are important structural functions that happen in approximately the same place in most successful movies, like the verses and choruses in a popular song. In subsequent books, Field has added to his original list, and students of his like Viki King and Linda Seger have added to the list of Plot Points. Here is a current list of the major Plot Points that are congruent with Field's Paradigm:

'''Opening Image''': The first image in the screenplay should summarize the entire film, especially its tone. Often, writers go back and redo this as the last thing before submitting the script.

'''Exposition''': Provides some background information to the audience about the plot, characters' histories, setting, and theme.

'''[[Inciting Incident]]''': Also called the catalyst, this is the point in the story when the Protagonist encounters the problem that will change their life. This is when the detective is assigned the case, where Boy meets Girl, and where the Comic Hero gets fired from his cushy job, forcing him into comic circumstances.

'''Plot Point 1''': The last scene in Act One, Plot Point 1 is a surprising development that radically changes the Protagonist's life, and forces him to confront the Opponent. In ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', this is when [[Luke Skywalker|Luke]]'s family is killed by the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Empire]]. He has no home to go back to, so he joins the [[Rebel Alliance|Rebels]] in opposing [[Darth Vader]].

'''Pinch 1''': A reminder scene at about 3/8 the way through the script (halfway through Act 2a) that brings up the central conflict of the drama, reminding us of the overall conflict. For example, in ''Star Wars'', Pinch 1 is the [[Imperial stormtrooper|Stormtroopers]] attacking the [[Millennium Falcon]] in [[Mos Eisley]], reminding us the Empire is after the stolen plans to the [[Death Star]] [[R2-D2]] is carrying and Luke and [[Obi-Wan Kenobi|Ben Kenobi]] are trying to get to the Rebel Alliance (the main conflict).

'''Midpoint''': An important scene in the middle of the script, often a reversal of fortune or revelation that changes the direction of the story. Field suggests that driving the story towards the Midpoint keeps the second act from sagging.

'''Pinch 2''': Another reminder scene about 5/8 through the script (halfway through Act 2b) that is somehow linked to Pinch 1 in reminding the audience about the central conflict. In ''Star Wars'', Pinch 2 is the Stormtroopers attacking them as they rescue the [[Princess Leia|Princess]] in the Death Star. Both scenes remind us of the Empire's opposition, and using the Stormtrooper attack [[motif (literature)|motif]] unifies both Pinches.

'''Plot Point 2''': A dramatic reversal that ends Act 2 and begins Act 3, which is about confrontation and resolution. Sometimes Plot Point 2 is the moment when the Hero has had enough and is finally going to face the Opponent. Sometimes, like in ''[[Toy Story]]'', it's the low-point for the Hero, and he must bounce back to overcome the odds in Act 3.

'''Showdown''': About midway through Act 3, the Protagonist will confront the Main Problem of the story and either overcome it, or come to a tragic end.

'''Resolution''': The issues of the story are resolved.

'''Tag''': An epilogue, tying up the loose ends of the story, giving the audience closure. This is also known as [[denouement]]. In general, films in recent decades have had longer denouements than films made in the 1970s or earlier.

===The sequence approach===
The sequence approach to screenwriting, sometimes known as "[[Sequence (filmmaking)|eight-sequence structure]]", is a system developed by [[Frank Daniel]], while he was the head of the Graduate Screenwriting Program at [[University of Southern California|USC]]. It is based in part on the fact that, in the early days of cinema, technical matters forced screenwriters to divide their stories into sequences, each the length of a reel (about ten minutes).&lt;ref&gt;Gulino, Paul Joseph: "Screenwriting: The Sequence Approach", pg3. Continuum, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sequence approach mimics that early style. The story is broken up into eight 10-15 minute sequences. The sequences serve as "mini-movies", each with their own compressed three-act structure. The first two sequences combine to form the film's first act. The next four create the film's second act. The final two sequences complete the resolution and dénouement of the story. Each sequence's resolution creates the situation which sets up the next sequence.

==Dialogue and description==

===Imagery===
Imagery can be used in many metaphoric ways. In ''[[The Talented Mr. Ripley (film)|The Talented Mr. Ripley]]'', the title character talked of wanting to close the door on himself sometime, and then, in the end, he did. [[Pathetic fallacy]] is also frequently used; rain to express a character feeling depressed, sunny days promote a feeling of happiness and calm. Imagery can be used to sway the emotions of the audience and to clue them in to what is happening.

Imagery is well defined in ''[[City of God (2002 film)|City of God]]''. The opening image sequence sets the tone for the entire film. The film opens with the shimmer of a knife's blade on a sharpening stone. A drink is being prepared, The knife's blade shows again, juxtaposed is a shot of a chicken letting loose of its harness on its feet. All symbolising 'The One that got away'. The film is about life in the favelas in Rio - sprinkled with violence and games and ambition.

===Dialogue===
Dialogue can be very important to the film industry, because there are no written words to explain the characters or plot; it all has to be explained through dialogue and imagery.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} [[Bollywood]] and other Indian film industries use separate dialogue writers in addition to the [[screenplay writer]]s.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

===Plot===
{{See also|Act structure}}
While the story is what will be told (narrative); the plot is how the story will be told (narration). This vocabulary is not indisputable for sometimes in literature stories and plots are used exactly the other way around.

==Screenwriting education==
A number of American universities offer specialized [[Master of Fine Arts]] and undergraduate programs in screenwriting, including [[USC School of Cinematic Arts|USC]], [[DePaul University]], [[AFI Conservatory|American Film Institute]], [[Loyola Marymount University]], [[Chapman University]], [[Tisch School of the Arts|NYU]], [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]],  [[Boston University]] and the [[University of the Arts (Philadelphia)|University of the Arts]]. In Europe, the United Kingdom has an extensive range of MA and BA Screenwriting Courses including [[London College of Communication]], [[Bournemouth University]], [[Edinburgh University]], and [[Goldsmiths, University of London|Goldsmiths College (University of London)]]. 

Some schools offer non-degree screenwriting programs, such as the [[TheFilmSchool]], The International Film and Television School Fast Track, and the UCLA Professional / [http://writers.uclaextension.edu/ Extension Programs in Screenwriting].

[[New York Film Academy]] offers both degree and non-degree educational systems with campuses all around the world.

Many screenwriters choose to pursue screenwriting independently with free online educational resources such as ScreenCraft, Keanewords, NoFilmSchool, Film Daily, [[The Black List]], [[John August]] and Craig Mazin's [[Scriptnotes]] podcast, and Julie Gray's Just Effing Entertain Me.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gray|first1=Julie|title=Just Effing Entertain Me|date=2013|publisher=Julie Gray|isbn=9781304404831|quote=A comprehensive guide to screenwriting with proven methods to help you test your ideas BEFORE you write your script, outlining tricks that make every page fascinating, chapters on character development, dialogue, theme}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Julie Gray|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/julie-gray/|publisher=Huffington Post|quote=A Hollywood refugee living in the Middle East, Julie Gray has authored two books and is working on a memoir.

== History ==
The first true screenplay is thought to be from [[George Melies]]' 1902 film ''[[A Trip to the Moon]]''. The movie is silent, but the screenplay still contains specific descriptions and action lines that resemble a modern-day script. As time went on and films became longer and more complex, the need for a screenplay became more prominent in the industry. The introduction of movie theaters also impacted the development of screenplays, as audiences became more widespread and sophisticated, so the stories had to be as well. Once the first non-silent movie was released in 1927, screenwriting became a hugely important position within Hollywood. The "studio system" of the 1930s only heightened this importance, as studio heads wanted productivity. Thus, having the "blueprint" (continuity screenplay) of the film beforehand became extremely optimal. Around 1970, the "spec script" was first created, and changed the industry for writers forever. Now, screenwriting for television (teleplays) is considered as difficult and competitive as writing is for feature films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://screenwritingfacts.weebly.com/history.html|title=History|website=The Art of Screenwriting|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portrayed in film==
Screenwriting has been the focus of a number of films:

* ''[[Crashing Hollywood (1931 film)|Crashing Hollywood]]'' (1931)&amp;mdash;A screenwriter collaborates on a gangster movie with a real-life gangster. When the film is released, the mob doesn’t like how accurate the movie is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0030022/ | title=Internet Movie Database listing of Crashing Hollywood}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Sunset Boulevard (1950 film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'' (1950)&amp;mdash;Actor [[William Holden]] portrays a hack screenwriter forced to collaborate on a screenplay with a desperate, fading [[silent film]] star, played by [[Gloria Swanson]].
*''[[In a Lonely Place]]'' (1950)&amp;mdash;[[Humphrey Bogart]] is a washed up screenwriter who gets framed for murder.
* ''[[Paris, When it Sizzles]]'' (1964)&amp;mdash;[[William Holden]] plays a drunk screenwriter who has wasted months partying and has just two days to finish his script. He hires [[Audrey Hepburn]] to help.
* ''[[Barton Fink]]'' (1991)&amp;mdash;[[John Turturro]] plays a naïve New York playwright who comes to Hollywood with high hopes and great ambition. While there, he meets one of his writing idols, a celebrated novelist from the past who has become a drunken hack screenwriter (a character based on [[William Faulkner]]).
* ''[[Mistress (1992 film)|Mistress]]'' (1992)&amp;mdash;In this comedy written by [[Barry Primus]] and [[J. F. Lawton]], [[Robert Wuhl]] is a screenwriter/director who's got integrity, vision, and a serious script - but no career. [[Martin Landau]] is a sleazy producer who introduces Wuhl to [[Robert De Niro]], [[Danny Aiello]] and [[Eli Wallach]] - three guys willing to invest in the movie, but with one catch: each one wants his mistress to be the star.
* ''[[The Player (film)|The Player]]'' (1992)&amp;mdash;In this satire of the Hollywood system, [[Tim Robbins]] plays a movie producer who thinks he’s being blackmailed by a screenwriter whose script was rejected.
* ''[[Adaptation (film)|Adaptation.]]'' (2002)&amp;mdash;[[Nicolas Cage]] portrays real-life screenwriter [[Charlie Kaufman]] (as well as his fictional brother, Donald) as Kaufman struggles to adapt an esoteric book ([[Susan Orlean]]’s real-life nonfiction work ''[[The Orchid Thief]]'' ) into an action-filled Hollywood screenplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.chasingthefrog.com/reelfaces/adaptation_intview4.php| title=Interview with Charlie Kaufman| publisher=chasingthefrog.com| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810022733/http://chasingthefrog.com/reelfaces/adaptation_intview4.php| archivedate=2007-08-10| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Dreams on Spec]]'' (2007)&amp;mdash;The only documentary to follow aspiring screenwriters as they struggle to turn their scripts into movies, the film also features wisdom from established scribes like [[James L. Brooks]], [[Nora Ephron]], [[Carrie Fisher]], and [[Gary Ross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jul/18/entertainment/et-scriptland18 | title=Producers, writers face huge chasm: Compensation for digital media and residuals for reuse of content are major issues as contract talks begin |journal=Los Angeles Times |date= July 18, 2007 |author=Jay A. Fernandez}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Seven Psychopaths]]'' (2012)&amp;mdash;In this satire, written and directed by [[Martin McDonagh]], [[Colin Farrell]] plays a screenwriter who is struggling to finish his screenplay ''Seven Psychopaths'', but finds unlikely inspiration after his best friend steals a Shih Tzu owned by a vicious gangster.
* ''[[Trumbo (2015 film)|Trumbo]]'' (2015)&amp;mdash;Highly successful Hollywood screenwriter [[Dalton Trumbo]], played in this [[biopic]] by [[Bryan Cranston]], is targeted by the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] for his socialist views, sent to federal prison for refusing to cooperate, and [[House Un-American Activities Committee#Hollywood blacklist|blacklisted]] from working in Hollywood, yet continues to write and subsequently wins two Academy Awards while using pseudonyms.

==Copyright protection==

===United States===
In the [[United States]], completed works may be [[copyright]]ed, but ideas and plots may not be. Any document written after 1978 in the U.S. is automatically copyrighted even without legal [[Register of Copyrights|registration]] or notice. However, the [[Library of Congress]] will formally register a screenplay. U.S. Courts will not accept a lawsuit alleging that a defendant is infringing on the plaintiff's copyright in a work until the plaintiff registers the plaintiff's claim to those copyrights with the Copyright Office.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/411- 17 USC 411 (United States Code, Title 17, Section 411)]&lt;/ref&gt; This means that a plaintiff's attempts to remedy an infringement will be delayed during the registration process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ01.pdf U.S. Copyright Office Circular 1]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in many infringement cases, the plaintiff will not be able recoup [[attorney fees]] or collect [[statutory damages for copyright infringement]], unless the plaintiff registered before the infringement began.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/412- 17 USC 412]&lt;/ref&gt; For the purpose of establishing evidence that a screenwriter is the author of a particular screenplay (but not related to the legal copyrighting status of a work), the Writers Guild of America registers screenplays. However, since this service is one of record keeping and is not regulated by law, a variety of commercial and non-profit organizations exist for registering screenplays. Protection for teleplays, formats, as well as screenplays may be registered for instant proof-of-authorship by third-party assurance vendors, such as the [http://www.creatorsvault.com/ Creators Vault].

There is a line of [[precedent]] in several states (including California and New York) that allows for "idea submission" claims, based on the notion that submission of a screenplay (or even a mere pitch for one) to a studio under very particular sets of factual circumstances could potentially give rise to an implied contract to pay for the ideas embedded in that screenplay, even if an alleged derivative work does not actually infringe the screenplay author's copyright.&lt;ref name="Biederman"&gt;{{cite book|title=Law and Business of the Entertainment Industries|date=November 2006|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780275992057|pages=313–327|author=Donald E. Biederman|edition=5th|author2=Edward P. Pierson |author3=Martin E. Silfen |author4=Janna Glasser |author5=Charles J. Biederman |author6=Kenneth J. Abdo |author7=Scott D. Sanders }}&lt;/ref&gt; The unfortunate [[side effect]] of such precedents (which were supposed to protect screenwriters) is that it is now that much harder to break into screenwriting. Naturally, motion picture and television production firms responded by categorically declining to read ''all'' unsolicited screenplays from unknown writers;&lt;ref name="Rosman"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rosman|first1=Kathleen|title=The Death of the Slush Pile|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703414504575001271351446274|accessdate=27 January 2015|work=Wall Street Journal|publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company|date=22 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; accepting screenplays only through official channels like talent agents, managers, and attorneys; and forcing screenwriters to sign broad [[legal release]]s before their screenplays will be actually accepted, read, or considered.&lt;ref name="Biederman" /&gt; In turn, agents, managers, and attorneys have become extremely powerful gatekeepers on behalf of the major film studios and media networks.&lt;ref name="Rosman" /&gt; One symptom of how hard it is to break into screenwriting as a result of such case law is that in 2008, [[Universal Studios]] resisted construction of a bike path along the [[Los Angeles River]] next to its studio lot because it would worsen their existing problem with desperate amateur screenwriters throwing copies of their work over the studio wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hymon|first1=Steve|author2=Andrew Blankstein|title=Studio poses obstacle to riverfront bike path|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-bikelane27feb27-story.html|accessdate=27 January 2015|work=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tribune Company|date=27 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SenorTembloresCuzcoMerced2010.jpg|thumb|250px|Señor de los Temblores]]
The '''Señor de los Temblores''' (Lord of the Earthquakes), known in [[Quechuan languages|Quechua]] as '''Taytacha Temblores''', is a statue of the [[crucifixion of Jesus]] from [[Cusco Cathedral]] in [[Cusco]], [[Peru]]. The image is popularly believed to have placated any further disaster caused by the 1650 earthquake.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Defining Latin American Art|author=Chaplik, D.|date=2005|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|isbn=9780786417285|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LsNPAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=2014-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became the [[patron saint]] of Cusco,&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Taytacha Temblores: patrón jurado del Cuzco|author=E, V.E.V.|date=1991|publisher=Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología CONCYTEC|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JPcQAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=2014-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of the most well-known images in Peru. It was probably created in Peru by native artists around 1570, and is made of mixed materials, including sticks, plaques of agave fiber, and plaster. The black color is not the original tone but was created by the buildup of soot from candles and oil lamps, and pigment and pollen from the red ''ñuk'chu'' flowers that are showered on the statue when it is taken in procession on Holy Monday.&lt;ref&gt;Maya Stanfield-Mazzi, ''Object and Apparition: Envisioning the Christian Divine in the Colonial Andes'' (Tucson: University of Arizona Press, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

He is a professor at the Institute for Sociology and Philosophy at the [[University of Ljubljana]]  and international director of the [[Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities]] of the [[University of London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbk.ac.uk/bih/aboutus/staff/zizek|title=Slavoj Zizek - International Director — The Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities, Birkbeck, University of London|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He works in subjects including [[continental philosophy]], [[political theory]], [[cultural studies]], [[psychoanalysis]], [[film criticism]], [[Marxism]], [[Hegelianism]] and [[theology]].

In 1989, Žižek published his first English text, ''[[The Sublime Object of Ideology]]'', in which he departed from traditional [[Marxist]] theory to develop a [[materialist]] conception of [[ideology]] that drew heavily on [[Lacanian psychoanalysis]] and [[Hegelian idealism]].&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Slavoj-Zizek|title=Slavoj Zizek - Slovene philosopher and cultural theorist|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"&gt;"Slavoj Žižek," by Matthew Sharpe, The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, {{ISSN|2161-0002}}, http://www.iep.utm.edu/zizek/. 27 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; His early theoretical work became increasingly eclectic and political in the 1990s, dealing frequently in the critical analysis of disparate forms of popular culture and making him a popular figure of the academic [[leftism|left]].&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kirk Boyle.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Žižek was born in [[Ljubljana]], [[SR Slovenia]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], into a middle-class family.&lt;ref name="mladina.si"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mladina.si/tednik/200442/clanek/nar-kdo_je_kdaj--ursa_matos/ |trans-title=Who's When: Slavoj Žižek.

His mother Vesna, native of the [[Gorizia Hills]] in the [[Slovenian Littoral]], was an accountant in a state enterprise. His parents were [[Atheism|atheists]].&lt;ref name="mladina.si"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Slovenski biografski leksikon'' (Ljubljana: [[Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts|SAZU]], 1991), XV. edition&lt;/ref&gt; He spent most of his childhood in the coastal town of [[Portorož]], where he was exposed to Western film, theory and popular culture.&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name=slovenskapomlad&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slovenskapomlad.si/2?id=20 |title=Slovenska pomlad: Slavoj Žižek (Webpage run by the National Museum of Modern History in Ljubljana) |publisher=Slovenskapomlad.si |date=29 September 1988 |accessdate=4 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003180230/http://www.slovenskapomlad.si/2?id=20 |archivedate=3 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  When Slavoj was a teenager his family moved back to Ljubljana where he attended [[Bežigrad High School]].&lt;ref name=slovenskapomlad/&gt; In the 1960s and early 1970s, Slavoj encountered western philosophy in [[Zagreb]]. {{Citation needed|reason=cba to source it, goes into this here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqmOkBK7lFA|date=April 2017}}

===Education===
In 1967, during an era of [[liberalization]] in [[Titoism|Titoist]] Yugoslavia, Žižek enrolled at the [[University of Ljubljana]] and studied philosophy and sociology.&lt;ref name="lacan.com"&gt;Tony Meyers [http://www.lacan.com/zizekchro1.htm Slavoj Zizek - His Life] lacan.com, from: Slavoj Zizek, London: Routledge, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

He had already begun reading French [[Structuralism|structuralists]] prior to entering university, and in 1967 he published the first translation of a text by [[Jacques Derrida]] into Slovenian.&lt;ref name="mladina.si 42"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.mladina.si/tednik/200442/clanek/nar-kdo_je_kdaj--ursa_matos/ |title= Tednik, številka 42, Slavoj Žižek |publisher= Mladina.Si |date= 24 October 2004 |accessdate= 13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mladina.si 42"/&gt; 
An early influence at university, [[Božidar Debenjak]], taught the philosophy of [[German idealism]] and introduced the thought of the [[Frankfurt School]] to Slovenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://dpu.mirovni-institut.si/9letnik/debenjak.php |title= Delavsko-punkerska univerza |publisher= Dpu.mirovni-institut.si |date= 22 February 1999 |accessdate= 13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debenjak's reading of Marx's ''[[Das Kapital]]'' from the perspective of Hegel's '' [[The Phenomenology of Spirit|Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' influenced many future Slovenian philosophers, including Žižek.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.mladina.si/tednik/200904/dr__bozidar_debenjak__filozof |title= Tednik, številka 04, Dr. Božidar Debenjak, filozof |publisher= Mladina.Si |date= 6 February 2009 |accessdate= 13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Žižek frequented the circles of dissident intellectuals, including the [[Martin Heidegger|Heideggerian]] philosophers [[Tine Hribar]] and [[Ivo Urbančič]],&lt;ref name="mladina.si 42"/&gt; and published articles in alternative magazines, such as ''[[Praxis School|Praxis]]'', ''Tribuna'' and ''Problemi'', which he also edited.&lt;ref name=slovenskapomlad/&gt; In 1971 he accepted a job as an assistant researcher with the promise of tenure, but was dismissed after his Master's thesis was denounced by the authorities of being "non-Marxist".&lt;ref name="p37"&gt;Žižek's response to the article "Če sem v kaj resnično zaljubljena, sem v življenje Sobotna priloga Dela, p. 37 (19.1. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from the University of Ljubljana in 1981 with a [[Doctor of Arts]] in Philosophy for his dissertation entitled ''The Theoretical and Practical Relevance of French Structuralism''.&lt;ref name="lacan.com"/&gt;

He spent the next few years undertaking [[national service]] in the [[Yugoslav army]] in [[Karlovac]].&lt;ref name="lacan.com"/&gt;

===Career===
During the 1980s, Žižek edited and translated [[Jacques Lacan]], [[Sigmund Freud]], and [[Louis Althusser]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dskp-drustvo.si/prevajalci.php |title=Prevajalci&amp;nbsp;– Društvo slovenskih književnih prevajalcev |publisher=Dskp-drustvo.si |accessdate=7 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105042135/http://www.dskp-drustvo.si/prevajalci.php |archivedate=5 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He used Jacques Lacan's work to interpret [[Hegelianism|Hegelian]] and Marxist philosophy.

In 1985, Žižek completed a second doctorate ([[Doctor of Philosophy]] in [[psychoanalysis]]) at the [[University of Paris VIII]]&lt;ref name="lacan.com"/&gt; under [[Jacques-Alain Miller]] and [[François Regnault]].

He wrote the introduction to Slovene translations of [[G. K. Chesterton]]'s and [[John Le Carré]]'s detective novels.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} 
In 1988, he published his first book dedicated entirely to [[film theory]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} He achieved international recognition as a [[Social theory|social theorist]] with the 1989 publication of his first book in English, ''The Sublime Object of Ideology''.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Žižek has been publishing in journals such as ''[[Lacanian Ink]]'' and ''[[In These Times]]'' in the United States, the ''[[New Left Review]]'' and ''[[The London Review of Books]]'' in the United Kingdom, and with the Slovenian [[Social liberalism|left-liberal]] magazine ''[[Mladina]]'' and newspapers ''[[Dnevnik (Ljubljana)|Dnevnik]]'' and ''[[Delo]]''. He also cooperates with the Polish leftist magazine ''[[Krytyka Polityczna]]'', regional southeast European left-wing journal ''[[Novi Plamen]]'', and serves on the editorial board of the psychoanalytical journal ''Problemi''.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Žižek is a series editor of the [[Northwestern University Press]] series Diaeresis that publishes works that "deal not only with philosophy, but also will intervene at the levels of ideology critique, politics, and art theory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diaeresis series page|url=http://www.nupress.northwestern.edu/content/diaeresis|website=Northwestern University Press|publisher=Northwestern University Press|accessdate=28 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===
In the late 1980s, Žižek came to public attention as a columnist for the alternative youth magazine ''[[Mladina]]'', which was critical of Tito's policies, Yugoslav politics, especially the [[militarization]] of society. He was a member of the [[Communist Party of Slovenia]] until October 1988, when he quit in protest against the [[JBTZ trial]] together with 32 other Slovenian intellectuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slovenskapomlad.si/1?id=103 |title=Skupinski protestni izstop iz ZKS |date=28 October 1998 |publisher=Slovenska Pomlad |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003180147/http://www.slovenskapomlad.si/1?id=103 |archivedate=3 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1988 and 1990, he was actively involved in several political and [[civil society]] movements which fought for the [[democratization]] of Slovenia, most notably the [[Committee for the Defence of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.slovenskapomlad.si/1?id=31&amp;aofs=3 |title=Odbor za varstvo človekovih pravic |date=3 June 1998 |publisher=Slovenska Pomlad |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003180306/http://www.slovenskapomlad.si/1?id=31&amp;aofs=3 |archivedate=3 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Slovenian presidential election, 1990|first free elections]] in 1990, he ran as the [[Liberal Democracy of Slovenia|Liberal Democratic Party]]'s candidate for Slovenian presidency (an office formally abolished in the [[Constitution of Slovenia|1991 constitution]]).{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Despite his activity in liberal democratic projects, Žižek has remained committed to the communist ideal and has been critical of right-wing circles, such as nationalists, [[Conservatism|conservatives]], and [[Classical liberalism|classical liberals]] both in Slovenia and worldwide. He wrote that the [[Cankar Hall|convention center]] in which nationalist [[Slovene writers]] hold their conventions should be blown up, adding, "Since we live in the time without any sense of irony, I must add I don't mean it literally."&lt;ref name="Interview_part_two"&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/6FZv9WUfX?url=http://www.delo.si/zgodbe/sobotnapriloga/slavoj-zizek-bog-daj-da-bi-ciniki-na-oblasti-res-vedeli-kaj-pocnejo.html Interview] with Žižek – part two, [[Delo]], 2 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, he jokingly made the following comment in May 2013, during [[Subversive Festival]]: "If they don't support [[SYRIZA]], then, in my vision of the democratic future, all these people will get from me [is] a first-class one-way ticket to [a] [[gulag]]." In response, the right-wing [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] party claimed Žižek's comments should be understood literally, not ironically.&lt;ref name="Mionis interview"&gt;{{cite news |title=Israel must fight to keep neo-Nazis out of Greece's government |author=Sabby Mionis |url=http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/israel-must-fight-to-keep-neo-nazis-out-of-greece-s-government-1.416802 |newspaper=Haaretz |date=6 March 2012 |accessdate=6 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_20/05/2013_499789 |title=Slovenian philosopher Zizek proposes 'gulag' for those who do not support SYRIZA |date=20 May 2013 |accessdate=20 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2008 interview with [[Amy Goodman]] on ''[[Democracy Now!]]'', he described himself as a "communist in a qualified sense," and in another appearance in October 2009 he described himself as a "radical leftist."&lt;ref name="democracynow.org"&gt;[http://www.democracynow.org/2008/3/11/everybody_in_the_world_except_us ''Democracy Now!'' television program online transcript], 11 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="http"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2009/10/15/slovenian_philosopher_slavoj_zizek_on_the |title=Slovenian Philosopher Slavoj Zizek on Capitalism, Healthcare, Latin American "Populism" and the "Farcical" Financial Crisis |publisher=Democracynow.org |accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year Žižek appeared in the [[Arte]] documentary ''[[Marx Reloaded]]'' in which he defended the idea of communism.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

In 2013, he corresponded with imprisoned Russian activist and [[Pussy Riot]] member [[Nadezhda Tolokonnikova]].&lt;ref name="Guardian, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova of Pussy Riot's prison letters to Slavoj Žižek"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nadezhda Tolokonnikova of Pussy Riot's prison letters to Slavoj Žižek|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/15/pussy-riot-nadezhda-tolokonnikova-slavoj-zizek}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote|text=All hearts were beating for you as long as you were perceived as just another version of the liberal-democratic protest against the authoritarian state.

Just before the [[2017 French presidential election]], Žižek stated that one could not choose between [[Emmanuel Macron|Macron]] and [[Marine Le Pen|Le Pen]], arguing that the [[neoliberalism]] of Macron just gives rise to [[neo-fascism|neofascism]] anyway. This was in response to many on the left calling for support for Macron to prevent a Le Pen victory.&lt;ref&gt;Žižek, Slavoj (3 May 2017).

===Public life===
[[File:Slavoj Žižek 2011.jpg|alt=|thumb|left|Žižek speaking in 2011]]

In 2003, Žižek wrote text to accompany [[Bruce Weber (photographer)|Bruce Weber]]'s photographs in a catalog for [[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch]]. Questioned as to the seemliness of a major intellectual writing ad copy, Žižek told ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', "If I were asked to choose between doing things like this to earn money and becoming fully employed as an American academic, kissing ass to get a tenured post, I would with pleasure choose writing for such journals!"&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, Joshua. "The Examined Life: Enjoy Your Chinos!", ''[[The Boston Globe]]''. 6 July 2003. H2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Žižek and his thought have been the subject of several documentaries. The 1996 ''[[Liebe Dein Symptom wie Dich selbst!]]'' is a German documentary on him. In the 2004 ''[[The Reality of the Virtual]]'', Žižek gave a one-hour lecture on his interpretation of Lacan's tripartite thesis of the imaginary, the symbolic, and the real.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} ''[[Zizek!]]'' is a 2005 documentary by [[Astra Taylor]] on his philosophy. The 2006 ''[[The Pervert's Guide to Cinema]]''  and 2012 ''[[The Pervert's Guide to Ideology]]''  also portray Žižek's ideas and cultural criticism. ''[[Examined Life]]'' (2008) features Žižek speaking about his conception of [[ecology]] at a garbage dump. He was also featured in the 2011 ''[[Marx Reloaded]]'', directed by [[Jason Barker]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

''[[Foreign Policy (magazine)|Foreign Policy]]'' named Žižek one of its 2012 [[FP Top 100 Global Thinkers|Top 100 Global Thinkers]] "for giving voice to an era of absurdity."&lt;ref name="The FP Top 100 Global Thinkers"/&gt;

===Impact===

His [[Slavoj Žižek bibliography|body of writing]] spans dense theoretical polemics, academic tomes, and accessible introductory books; in addition, he has taken part in various film projects, including two documentary collaborations with director [[Sophie Fiennes]], ''[[The Pervert's Guide to Cinema]]'' (2006) and ''[[The Pervert's Guide to Ideology]]'' (2012). His work has impacted both academic and widespread public audiences (see for example his commentary in the 2003 Abercrombie and Fitch Quarterly).

Hundreds of academics have addressed aspects of Žižek's work in professional papers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?num=50&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;c2coff=1&amp;q=slavoj+zizek&amp;btnG=Search |title=Google Scholar search for Zizek |publisher=Google Scholar |accessdate=4 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2007, the ''[[International Journal of Žižek Studies]]'' was established for the discussion of his work.

# Against [[Karl Marx]]'s concept of ideology as described in ''[[The German Ideology]]'', [[false consciousness]] prevents people from seeing how things really are. Building upon Althusser, ideology is thoroughly unconscious and functions as a series of justifications and [[Spontaneous order|spontaneous]] socio-symbolic rituals which support virtual authorities.
# [[The Real]] is not experienced as something which is ordered in a way that gives satisfactory meaning to all its parts in relation to one another. Instead the Real is experienced as through the lens of hegemonic systems of representation and reproduction, while resisting full inscription into ordering system ascribed to it. This in turn may lead subjects to experience the Real as generating political resistance.

Drawing on Lacan's notion of the barred subject, the [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]] is a purely negative [[entity]], a void of negativity (in the Hegelian sense), which allows for the flexibility and reflexivity of the Cartesian [[Cogito ergo sum|cogito]] (transcendental subject).&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sinnerbrink2008&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sinnerbrink|first=Robert|title=The Hegelian 'Night of the World': Žižek on Subjectivity, Negativity, and Universality|journal=International Journal of Žižek Studies|year=2008|volume=2|issue=2|url=http://zizekstudies.org/index.php/ijzs/article/view/136|accessdate=17 August 2012|issn=1751-8229|quote=This extraordinary analysis of the transcendental imagination, critique of Heidegger, and rereading of Hegelian 'night of the world,' together contribute to a reassertion of the radicality of the 'Cartesian subject'—that thoroughly repudiated theoretical spectre which nonetheless continues to 'haunt Western academia' (1999: 1–5). This unorthodox reading of the Hegelian 'night of the world'—the radical negativity that haunts subjectivity—is developed further in an explicitly political direction, which helps explain a critique of the 'Fukuyamaian' consensus, shared both by moral-religious conservatives and libertarian 'postmodernists', that global capitalism remains the 'unsurpassable horizon of our times'.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though consciousness is opaque (following Hegel), the epistemological gap between the In-itself and For-itself is immanent to reality itself;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Umbr(a): The Object|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=k7QbBAAAQBAJ|publisher = Umbr(a) Journal|date = 2013-01-01|isbn = 9780979953965|first = Tom|last = Eyers|first2 = Graham|last2 = Harman|first3 = Adrian|last3 = Johnston|first4 = Guy Le|last4 = Gaufey|first5 = Todd|last5 = McGowan|first6 = Duane|last6 = Rousselle|first7 = Jelica Šumič|last7 = Riha|first8 = Rado|last8 = Riha}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kant's antinomies|antinomies]] of Kant, [[quantum physics]], and [[Alain Badiou]]'s 'materialist' principle that 'The One is Not', point towards an inconsistent ("Barred") Real itself (that Lacan conceptualized prior).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Less Than Nothing: Hegel and the Shadow of Dialectical Materialism|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=FAqM5rxWWKwC|publisher = Verso Books|date = 2012-05-22|isbn = 9781844679027|first = Slavoj|last = Zizek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there are multiple Symbolic interpretations of the Real, they are not all relatively "true". Two instances of the Real can be identified: the abject Real (or "real Real"), which cannot be wholly integrated into the symbolic order, and the symbolic Real, a set of signifiers that can never be properly integrated into the horizon of sense of a subject. The truth is revealed in the process of transiting the contradictions; or the real is a "minimal difference", the gap between the infinite judgement of a [[reductionism|reductionist]] materialism and experience as lived,&lt;ref&gt;Zizek, On Belief&lt;/ref&gt; the "Parallax" of dialectical antagonisms are inherent to reality itself and [[dialectical materialism]] (contra [[Friedrich Engels]]) is a new materialist Hegelianism, incorporating the insights of Lacanian psychoanalysis, set theory, quantum physics, and contemporary continental philosophy.

===Political thought and the postmodern subject===
Žižek argues:
* The state is a system of regulatory institutions that shape our behavior. Its power is purely symbolic and has no normative force outside of collective behavior. In this way, the term ''the law'' signifies society's basic principles, which enable interaction by prohibiting certain acts.&lt;ref&gt;Žižek, ''For They Know Not What They Do''&lt;/ref&gt;
* Political decisions have become depoliticized and accepted as natural conclusions. For example, controversial policy decisions (such as reductions in social welfare spending) are presented as apparently "objective" necessities. Although governments make claims about increased citizen participation and democracy, the important decisions are still made in the interests of [[Capital (economics)|capital]]. The [[two-party system]] dominant in the United States and elsewhere produces a similar illusion.&lt;ref&gt;''A Plea for Intolerance''&lt;/ref&gt; It is still necessary to engage in [[Political particularism|particular]] conflicts – such as labor disputes – but the trick is to relate these individual events to the larger struggle. Particular demands, if executed well, might serve as ''metaphorical condensation'' for the system and its injustices. The real political conflict is between an ordered structure of society and those without a place in it.&lt;ref name="Ticklish Subject&amp;nbsp;— Politics"&gt;{{cite book|last=Žižek|first=Slavoj|title=The Ticklish Subject: the absent centre of political ontology|year=1999|publisher=Verso|location=London|isbn=9781859848944|chapter=Political Subjectivization and Its Vicissitudes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In stark contrast to the intellectual tenets of the European "universalist Left" in general, and those [[Jürgen Habermas]] defined as postnational in particular, pro-sovereignty and pro-independence processes opened in Europe are good.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dropbox.com/s/cihuwrieedr8s1j/44101916-LAPIKO-TXOSTENAK-ZIZEK.pdf Žižek: "The force of universalism is in you Basques, not in the Spanish state", Interview in ''ARGIA'' (27 June 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] subject is cynical toward official institutions, yet at the same time believes in conspiracies. When we lost our shared belief in a single power, we constructed another of the [[Big Other|Other]] in order to escape the unbearable freedom that we faced.&lt;ref&gt;Žižek, ''Looking Awry: an Introduction to Jacques Lacan through Popular Culture''&lt;/ref&gt; It is not enough to merely know that you are being lied to, particularly when continuing to live a normal life under capitalism. For example, that despite people being aware of ideology, they may continue to act as automata, mistakenly believing that they are thereby expressing their radical freedom. Although one may possess a self-awareness, just because one understands what one is doing does not mean that one is doing the right thing.&lt;ref name=YouMay1999&gt;{{cite journal|last=Žižek|first=Slavoj|title=You May!|journal=London Review of Books|date=18 March 1999|volume=21|issue=6|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v21/n06/slavoj-zizek/you-may|accessdate=20 August 2012|quote=But the notion is undermined by the rise of what might be called 'Post-Modern racism', the surprising characteristic of which is its insensitivity to reflection&amp;nbsp;– a neo-Nazi skinhead who beats up black people knows what he's doing, but does it anyway.

* Religion is not an enemy but rather one of the fields of struggle. [[Atheism]] is good. Religious fundamentalists are in a way no different from "godless Stalinist Communists". They both value divine will and salvation over moral or ethical action.&lt;ref&gt;Žižek, Slavoj.

==Criticism==
There are two main themes of critique of Žižek's ideas: his failure to articulate an alternative or program in the face of his denunciation of contemporary social, political, and economic arrangements, and his lack of rigor in argumentation.&lt;ref name="ViolentVisions"/&gt;

===Ambiguity and unclear alternatives===
Žižek's philosophical and political positions are not always clear, and his work has been criticized for a failure to take a consistent stance.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, Gabriel (2011). [http://www.alpineanarchist.org/r_anarchist_hypothesis.html The Anarchist Hypothesis, or Badiou, Žižek, and the Anti-Anarchist Prejudice] Alpine Anarchist. Retrieved 4 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; While he has claimed to stand by a revolutionary Marxist project,  his lack of vision concerning the possible circumstances which could lead to successful revolution makes it unclear what that project consists of. According to John Gray and John Holbo, his theoretical argument often lacks grounding in historical fact, which makes him more provocative than insightful.&lt;ref name="ViolentVisions"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gray|first=John|title=The Violent Visions of Slavoj Žižek|journal=New York Review of Books|date=12 July 2012|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2012/jul/12/violent-visions-slavoj-zizek/|accessdate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Holbo-2004&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holbo|first=John|title=On Žižek and Trilling|journal=Philosophy and Literature|date=1 January 2004|volume=28|issue=2|pages=430–440|doi=10.1353/phl.2004.0029|quote=...an unhealthy anti-liberal is one, like Z+iz=ek, who ticks and tocks in unreflective revulsion at liberalism, pantomiming that he is de Maistre (or Abraham) or Robespierre (or Lenin) by turns, lest he look like Mill.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Holbo-CT-2010&gt;{{cite news|last=Holbo|first=John|title=Zizek on the Financial Collapse&amp;nbsp;– and Liberalism|url=http://crookedtimber.org/2010/12/17/zizek-on-the-financial-collapse-and-liberalism/|accessdate=21 August 2012|newspaper=Crooked Timbers|date=17 December 2010|quote=To review: Zizek does this liberal = neoliberal thing. Which is no good. And he doesn't even have much to say about economics. And Zizek does this liberal = self-hating pc white intellectuals thing. Which is no good.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Scruton]] has written in "Fools, Frauds and Firebrands: Thinkers of the New Left", "To summarize Žižek's position is not easy: he slips between philosophical and psychoanalytical ways of arguing, and is spell-bound by [[Lacan]]'s gnomic utterances. He is a lover of paradox, and believes strongly in what [[Hegel]] called 'the labour of the negative' though taking the idea, as always, one stage further towards the brick wall of paradox".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Scruton |first=Roger |date=2015 |title=Fools, Frauds and Firebrands: Thinkers of the New Left |publisher=Bloomsbury |page=256 |isbn=1408187337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Žižek's refusal to present an alternative vision has led critics to accuse him of using unsustainable Marxist categories of analysis and having a 19th-century understanding of class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Slavoj Zizek responds to his critics|last=Žižek|first=Slavoj|work=[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]]|date=July 3, 2012|url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2012/07/slavoj-zizek-responds-to-his-critics/|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Ernesto Laclau]] argued that "Žižek uses class as a sort of ''[[deus ex machina]]'' to play the role of the good guy against the multicultural devils."&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Judith, Ernesto Laclau and Slavoj Žižek ''Contingency, Hegemony, Universality: Contemporary Dialogues on the Left''. Verso. London, New York City 2000. pp. 202–206&lt;/ref&gt; The use of such analysis, however, is not systematic and draws on critical accounts of [[Stalinism]] and [[Maoism]], as well as [[post-structuralism]] and Lacanian [[psychoanalysis]].&lt;ref name=VanAuken&amp;Haig-2010&gt;{{cite news|title=Zizek in Manhattan: An intellectual charlatan masquerading as "left"|url=http://www.wsws.org/articles/2010/nov2010/zize-n12.shtml|accessdate=21 August 2012|newspaper=World Socialist Web Site|date=12 November 2010|author=Bill Van Auken|author2=Adam Haig}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Žižek does not agree with critics who claim he believes in a historical necessity:
&lt;blockquote&gt;There is no such thing as the Communist [[big Other]], there's no historical necessity or [[teleology]] directing and guiding our actions. (In [[Slovene language|Slovene]]: "''Ni komunističnega velikega Drugega, nobene zgodovinske nujnosti ali teleologije, ki bi usmerjala in vodila naša dejanja''".)&lt;ref name="Interview_part_two"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his book ''Living in the End Times'', Žižek suggests that the criticism of his positions is itself ambiguous and multilateral: &lt;blockquote&gt;[...] I am attacked for being anti-Semitic ''and'' for spreading [[Zionism|Zionist]] lies, for being a covert Slovene nationalist ''and'' unpatriotic traitor to my nation, for being a crypto-Stalinist defending terror ''and'' for spreading Bourgeois lies about Communism... so maybe, just maybe I am on right path, the path of fidelity to freedom."&lt;ref&gt;Slavoj Žižek. "Living in the End Times".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Unorthodox style and scholarship===
Critics complain of a theoretical chaos in which questions and answers are confused and in which Žižek constantly recycles old ideas which were scientifically refuted long ago or which in reality have quite a different meaning than Žižek gives to them.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. David Bordwell, "Slavoj Žižek: Say Anything", DavidBordwell.net blog, April 2005.[http://www.davidbordwell.net/essays/zizek.php]; Philipp Oehmke, "Welcome to the Slavoj Zizek Show". ''Der Spiegel Online (International edition)'', 7 August 2010 [http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/the-most-dangerous-philosopher-in-the-west-welcome-to-the-slavoj-zizek-show-a-705164.html]; [[Jonathan Rée]], "Less Than Nothing by Slavoj Žižek&amp;nbsp;– review. A march through Slavoj Žižek's 'masterwork'". ''The Guardian'', 27 June 2012.[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jun/27/less-than-nothing-slavoj-zizek-review]&lt;/ref&gt; Harpham calls Žižek's style "a stream of nonconsecutive units arranged in arbitrary sequences that solicit a sporadic and discontinuous attention."&lt;ref&gt;Harpham [http://www.uchicago.edu/research/jnl-crit-inq/issues/v29/v29n3.harpham1.html "Doing the Impossible: Slavoj Žižek and the End of Knowledge"]&lt;/ref&gt; O'Neill concurs: "a dizzying array of wildly entertaining and often quite maddening rhetorical strategies are deployed in order to beguile, browbeat, dumbfound, dazzle, confuse, mislead, overwhelm, and generally subdue the reader into acceptance."&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, [http://www.film-philosophy.com/vol5-2001/n17oneill "The Last Analysis of Slavoj Žižek"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Such presentation has laid him open to accusations of misreading other philosophers, particularly [[Jacques Lacan]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]. Žižek carries over many concepts from Lacan's teachings into the sphere of political and social theory, but has a tendency to do so in an extreme deviation from its psychoanalytic context.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Parker, ''Slavoj Žižek: A Critical Introduction'' (Pluto Press: London and Sterling, 2004) p.78-80. For example, Žižek's appropriation of Lacan's discussion of [[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]] in his 1959/1960 seminar, ''The Ethics of Psychoanalysis''. In this seminar, Lacan uses Antigone to defend the claim that "the only thing of which one can be guilty is of having given ground relative to one's desire" (Slavoj Žižek, ''The Metastases of Enjoyment'', Verso: London, 1994; p.&amp;nbsp;69). However, as Parker notes, Antigone's act (burying her dead brother in the knowledge that she will be buried alive) was never intended to effect a revolutionary change in the political status quo; yet, despite this, Žižek frequently cites Antigone as a paradigm of ethico-political action.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, according to some critics, Žižek's conflation of Lacan's unconscious with Hegel's unconscious is mistaken. Noah Horwitz, in an effort to dissociate Lacan from Hegel, interprets the Lacanian unconscious and the Hegelian unconscious as two totally different mechanisms. Horwitz points out, in Lacan and Hegel's differing approaches to the topic of speech, that Lacan's unconscious reveals itself to us in [[parapraxis]], or "slips-of-the-tongue". We are therefore, according to Lacan, alienated from language through the revelation of our desire (even if that desire originated with the Other, as he claims, it remains peculiar to us). In Hegel's unconscious, however, we are alienated from language whenever we attempt to articulate a particular and end up articulating a universal. For example, if I say 'the dog is with me', although I am trying to say something about this particular dog at this particular time, I actually produce the universal category 'dog', and therefore express a generality, not the particularity I desire. Hegel's argument implies that, at the level of sense-certainty, we can never express the true nature of reality. Lacan's argument implies, to the contrary, that speech reveals the true structure of a particular unconscious mind.&lt;ref&gt;Noah Horwitz, "Contra the Slovenians: Returning to Lacan and away from Hegel" (''Philosophy Today'', Spring 2005, pp.&amp;nbsp;24–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a very negative review of Žižek's magnum opus ''Less than Nothing'', the British political philosopher [[John Gray (philosopher)|John Gray]] attacked Žižek for his celebrations of violence, his failure to ground his theories in historical facts, and his ‘formless radicalism’ which, according to Gray, professes to be communist yet lacks the conviction that communism could ever be successfully realized. Gray concluded that Žižek's work, though entertaining, is intellectually worthless: 'Achieving a deceptive substance by endlessly reiterating an essentially empty vision, Žižek's work amounts in the end to less than nothing.'&lt;ref name="ViolentVisions"/&gt;

===Accusations of self-plagiarism in 2014===
Žižek's tendency to recycle portions of his own texts in subsequent works resulted in the accusation of [[self-plagiarism]] by ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 2014, after Žižek published 
an op-ed in the magazine which contained portions of his writing from an earlier book.&lt;ref name="Newsweek"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/slavoj-zizek-self-plagiarized-new-york-times-269221|title=Slavoj Žižek On 'Self Plagiarism' in The New York Times: What's the Big Deal?|date=10 September 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Žižek expressed perplexity at the harsh tone of the denunciation, emphasizing that the recycled passages in question only acted as references from his theoretical books to supplement otherwise original writing.&lt;ref name="Newsweek"/&gt;

On 11 July 2014, American weekly newsmagazine ''[[Newsweek]]'' reported that in an article published in 2006 Žižek plagiarized substantial passages from an earlier review that first appeared in the journal ''[[American Renaissance (magazine)|American Renaissance]]'', a publication condemned by the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] as the organ of a "white nationalist hate group."&lt;ref name="American_Renaissance_Plagiarism"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/did-marxist-philosophy-superstar-slavoj-zizek-plagiarize-white-nationalist-journal-258433 |title= Did Marxist Philosophy Superstar Slavoj Žižek Plagiarize a White Nationalist Journal?|work= Newsweek |date=11 July 2014 |accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in response to the allegations, Žižek stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;When I was writing the text on Derrida which contains the problematic passages, a friend told me about [[Kevin B. MacDonald|Kevin Macdonald's]]  theories, and I asked him to send me a brief resume. The friend send [sic] it to me, assuring me that I can use it freely since it merely resumes another's line of thought. Consequently, I did just that – and I sincerely apologize for not knowing that my friend's resume was largely borrowed from Stanley Hornbeck's review of Macdonald's book. [...] As any reader can quickly establish, the problematic passages are purely informative, a report on another's theory for which I have no affinity whatsoever; all I do after this brief resume is quickly dismissing Macdonald's theory as a new chapter in the long process of the destruction of Reason. In no way can I thus be accused of plagiarizing another's line of thought, of "stealing ideas". I nonetheless deeply regret the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dean|first1=Michelle|title=Slavoj Žižek Sorta Kinda Admits Plagiarizing White Supremacist Journal|url=http://gawker.com/slavoj-zizek-sorta-kinda-admits-plagiarizing-white-supr-1604590014|website=Gawker.com|publisher=Gawker Online|accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Chomsky===
[[Noam Chomsky]] is critical of Žižek saying Žižek is guilty of "using fancy terms like polysyllables and pretending you have a theory when you have no theory whatsoever,"  and also said that Žižek’s theories never go "beyond the level of something you can explain in five minutes to a twelve-year-old."&lt;ref&gt;Springer, Mike (28 June 2013).

{{Refimprove|date=March 2012}}
A '''sound-alike''' is a recording intended to imitate the sound of a popular record, the style of a popular [[recording artist]], or a current musical trend; the term also refers to the artists who perform on such recordings. In the [[voice-over]] world, it may also refer to those who recreate the voice and vocal mannerisms of a given celebrity's vocal performance (see also [[impersonator]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ciccarelli, Stephanie [http://blogs.voices.com/voxdaily/2006/08/sound_alikes_voice_actors.html "Sound Alikes: Not your Average Job Description"], ''Voices.com'', August 9, 2006, accessed February 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sound-alikes are usually made as budget copies or "[[wiktionary:knockoff|knockoffs]]" of popular recordings. The cost of writing and recording a new song that sounds similar to a popular song is usually negligible compared to the cost of royalties for playing the original recording or the [[Music licensing|licensing]] fees to record a [[cover version]]. If the sound-alike recording is dissimilar enough to avoid infringing the original writer's [[copyright]], the user of a sound-alike can evoke the spirit of a song, or sometimes make listeners believe that the work being played has been recorded by a particular artist, without the expense of engaging a highly paid artist. 

A [[cover version]] is sometimes referred to as a sound-alike, but in the stricter sense, a sound-alike must contain differences that are significant enough to suggest to a listener that those recording the song sought to perform a work different from the work to which it sounds similar. A recording intended as an interpretation of a work is not a sound-alike; it is a cover version, for which many countries require licensing for any performance or distribution. 

Sound-alike recordings have been used in movie [[soundtrack]]s and radio and television [[television advertisement|commercials]] since their origin, while sound-alike artists have long recorded [[jingle]]s and other musical material for commercial use. 

Sounds-alikes have sometimes been the subject of litigation. In the 1980s, singer [[Bette Midler]] sued over a sound-alike version of her recording of "[[Do You Wanna Dance?]]" being used in a commercial which sounded too close to the original. "[[Old Cape Cod]]" was the subject of a 1990 lawsuit subsequent to a sound-alike version of the [[Patti Page]] hit which was featured in a 1989 commercial for [[American Savings Bank]]. Page sued the advertising agency responsible for the commercial, alleging the commercial implied that Page, herself, endorsed the bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Patti Page Sues Over Sound-Alike Commercial|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-01-09/local/me-115_1_asher-gould |accessdate=18 February 2013|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=9 January 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guitarist [[Carlos Santana]] sued over a commercial [[music bed]] which closely imitated his playing and arranging style. 

Sound-alike [[album]]s have also long been issued by small, budget-minded record companies, as a way to cash in on the popular artists, movies or [[show tunes]] from hit plays currently in style. [[Lou Reed]] began his recording career working for one such company, [[Pickwick Records]], but years later became a star in his own right, as an original performer. Other such companies were [[Hit Records]] of [[Nashville, Tennessee]] and [[Embassy Records]] of the [[United Kingdom]]. [[Bell Records]] of [[New York City]] also issued sound-alike budget records in the 1950s. [[Madacy Entertainment]] also releases sound-alike albums under the title [[The Countdown Singers]]; [[Drew's Entertainment]] currently releases sound-alikes through the name "The Hit Crew". 

Sound-alike albums have been known to chart. In 1971, the sound-alike album ''[[Top of the Pops, Volume 18]]'' reached No. 1 on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. [[Stars on 45 (song)|A medley of sound-alike recordings of Beatles songs]] recorded by the [[Stars on 45]] reached number one on several national charts in 1981. On February 3, 2012, a sound-alike version of the [[will.i.am]] track "[[T.H.E. (The Hardest Ever)]]" by "Kings of Pop" was available for download before the release of the original, and entered the UK Singles chart at number 40, the first cover to do so. Other sound-alike covers of "[[Whistle (Flo Rida song)|Whistle]]" by [[Flo Rida]] and "[[Payphone (song)|Payphone]]" by [[Maroon 5]] have also entered the [[top 40]]. 

Many of these sound-alike versions of popular songs available on download sites continue to generate strong download sales prior to the release of the original song.

{{Culture of South Africa}}
'''South African art''' is the [[visual art]] produced by the people inhabiting the territory occupied by the modern country of [[South Africa]]. The oldest art objects in the world were discovered in a South African cave. Archaeologists have discovered two sets of art kits thought to be 100,000 years old at a cave in South Africa. The findings provide a glimpse into how early humans produced and stored [[ochre]] – a form of paint – which pushes back our understanding of when evolved complex cognition occurred by around 20,000 – 30,000 years. Also, dating from 75,000 years ago, they found small drilled snail shells could have no other function than to have been strung on a string as a necklace. South Africa was one of the cradles of the human species. 

The scattered tribes of [[Khoisan]] and [[San people|San]] peoples moving into South Africa from around 10000 [[Anno Domini|BC]] had their own art styles seen today in a multitude of cave paintings.&lt;ref name="South African art"&gt;{{cite web|title=South African art|url=http://www.southafrica.info/about/arts/art.htm#.Vw5td8d6FlI|website=www.southafrica.info|accessdate=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were superseded by [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] and [[Nguni people|Nguni]] peoples with their own vocabularies of art forms. 

In the present era, traditional tribal forms of art were scattered and re-melded by the divisive policies of [[apartheid]]. New forms of art evolved in the mines and [[townships]]: a dynamic art using everything from plastic strips to bicycle spokes. In addition to this, there also is the [[Dutch people|Dutch]]-influenced [[folk art]] of the [[Afrikaner]] Trek [[Boer]]s and the urban white artists earnestly following changing European traditions from the 1850s onwards, making for an eclectic mix which continues to evolve today.

== Paleolithic Rock Art==
[[File:Karoo sandstone with bushmen paintings.jpg|thumb|Sandstone with bushmen rock paintings, [[Karoo System]], ([[Amathole Mountains]], South Africa)]]

The pre-Bantu peoples migrating southwards from around the year 30,000 [[Anno Domini|BC]] were nomadic hunters who favoured caves as dwellings. Before the rise of the Nguni peoples along the east and southern coasts and central areas of Africa these nomadic hunters were widely distributed. It is thought they entered South Africa at least 10 years ago. They have left lots of signs of life, people toilets and rocks ('[[Bushmen|Bushman]]' paintings) depicting hunting, domestic and magic-related art.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|title=Paleolithic Period|url=http://www.britannica.com/event/Paleolithic-Period|website=Britannica|accessdate=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a stylistic unity across the region and even with more ancient art in the [[Tassili n'Ajjer]] region of northern Africa, and also in what is now desert [[Chad]] but was once a lush landscape.

The figures are dynamic and elongate, and the colours (derived probably from earthen and plant pigments and possibly also from insects) combine ochreous red, white, grey, black, and many warm tones ranging from red through to primary yellow. Common subjects include hunting, often depicting with great accuracy large animals which no longer inhabit the same region in the modern era, as well as: warfare among humans, dancing, domestic scenes, multiple images of various animals, including giraffes, antelope of many kinds, and snakes. The last of these works are poignant in their representation of larger, darker people and even of white hunters on horseback, both of whom would supplant the 'Bushman' peoples.
 
Many of the 'dancing' figures are decorated with unusual patterns and may be wearing masks and other festive clothing. Other paintings, depicting patterned quadrilaterals and other symbols, are obscure in their meaning and may be non-representational. Similar symbols are seen in [[shaman]]istic art worldwide. This art form is distributed from Angola in the west to [[Mozambique]] and [[Kenya]], throughout [[Zimbabwe]] and South Africa and throughout [[Botswana]] wherever cave conditions have favoured preservation from the elements.

==Contemporary Art in South Africa==

The [[contemporary art]] scene in South Africa is as diverse and vibrant as the population and cultures in the country. Contemporary artists in South Africa have adopted new media technologies to produce varied and creative bodies of work, as seen in the work of [[Dineo Seshee Bopape]] and CUSS Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williams-Wynn|first1=Christopher|last2=McCulloch|first2=Samantha|title=Between the Archive and the Real: Contemporary Digital Art and South Africa|journal=[[Third Text]]|year=2016|issn=0952-8822|doi=10.1080/09528822.2016.1213959|via=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their art gives insight into the pressing issues of South African society. On a global scale, contemporary South African art is relevant and sought-after. A charcoal and oil on canvas work by leading South African contemporary artist [[William Kentridge]] was sold on auction for R3,5&amp;nbsp;million in London in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contemporary South African Artists|url=http://www.southafrica.net/za/en/articles/entry/article-southafrica.net-contemporary-south-african-artists|publisher=South Africa.net|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art 21, Inc|url=http://www.art21.org/artists/william-kentridge|website=Art 21|accessdate=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4876">The '''Symphony''' is an [[orchestra]]l composition in four movements by the American composer [[Christopher Theofanidis]].  It was commissioned by the [[Atlanta Symphony Orchestra]], which premiered the work under the conductor [[Robert Spano]] in April 2009.  The piece is dedicated to Robert Spano "in admiration and friendship."&lt;ref name="Score"&gt;[[Christopher Theofanidis|Theofanidis, Christopher]] (2009). [http://www.theofanidismusic.com/programnotes_Symphony_09.html Symphony: Program Note by the Composer]. Retrieved February 6, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
The Symphony has a duration of roughly 35 minutes and is composed in four numbered [[Movement (music)|movements]].  The first movement has a duration of roughly 12 minutes; in the program notes, Theofanidis described it and the fourth movement as "the big pillars of the piece, both emotionally and in scale."  The second movement has a duration of roughly 8 minutes and was described by the composer as "quite lyrical, but not slow."  The third movement is a brief [[scherzo]]-[[ritornello]] with a duration of only about 4 minutes.  The final movement has a duration of roughly 10 minutes; the composer described its relation to the opening movement, writing:{{quote|The first movement and last movement both hinge on two contrasting types of energies—in the first movement, the feeling is joyous but occasionally takes turns into a slightly out-of-control version of itself.  The last movement is quite dark and monolithic in character, but is occasionally tormented by flashes of light and beauty.  I saw these two movements as mirror opposites of each other.  The first is mostly quite fast, the last has a certain breadth and grandeur with some occasional faster music.&lt;ref name="Score" /&gt;}}

==Reception==
Reviewing a 2011 recording of the Symphony, Jeff Dunn of the ''San Francisco Classical Voice'' wrote, "Listeners will find [Theofanidis's] Texas toast of a Symphony No. 1 an instantly engaging experience."  He added, "Throughout, the music will keep you upright in your seat and as happy as if you'd just watched another ''[[The Bourne Identity (2002 film)|Bourne Identity]]'' action flick. Whether you'll want to immerse yourself in further hearings, however, is a matter of taste."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dunn |first=Jeff |title=A New "American" Symphony - Christopher Theofanidis: Symphony No. 1 |work=San Francisco Classical Voice |date=July 5, 2011 |url=https://www.sfcv.org/reviews/a-new-american-symphony |accessdate=February 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pierre Ruhe of ''ArtsATL'' opined, "There's much to admire, from its earnestness and craftsmanship to its engagement with a large canvas. Theofanidis' symphony takes a [[Gustav Mahler|Mahlerian]] view that the orchestra can express everything, which is filtered through symphonic Hollywood, from [[John Williams]] to [[Tan Dun]], with a heavy use (or overuse) of percussion for grandiose effect."&lt;ref name="ArtsATL"&gt;{{cite web |last=Ruhe |first=Pierre |title=ASO CD review: Lieberson's "Neruda Songs" and a Theofanidis symphony |work=ArtsATL |date=July 8, 2011 |url=http://www.artsatl.com/2011/07/cd-review-liebersons-neruda-songs-and-a-theofanidis-symphony-on-aso-media/ |accessdate=February 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Joshua Kosman of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' also praised the work, writing:{{quote|Theofanidis' great knack is to write music out of fairly familiar harmonic and rhythmic building blocks, yet have it come out sounding fresh and provocative. Aside from the lack of a slow movement, the four-movement structure of his First Symphony is traditional - it's bolstered by two large and energetic outer movements, with scherzo-like interludes in between. The opening, which seems to be channeling memories of Scottish bagpipes, is the symphony's most fascinating movement, built around two crisply delineated themes that fall gratefully on the ear. Theofanidis spices up his tonal harmonies with enough surprises to keep things moving, and the orchestral writing is first rate; only the square-cut phrasing, with most gestures returning in predictable groups of four, wears thin.&lt;ref name="SFC"&gt;{{cite web |last=Kosman |first=Joshua |title=CD review: Christopher Theofanidis, 'Symphony No. 1' |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=July 3, 2011 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/music/article/CD-review-Christopher-Theofanidis-Symphony-No-2365875.php |accessdate=February 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Recording==
A recording of the symphony, performed by Robert Spano and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, was released through the orchestra's label ASO Media on June 28, 2011.&lt;ref name="ArtsATL" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SFC" /&gt;

[[File:Taste bud.svg|thumb|right|Taste bud]]
'''Taste''', '''gustatory perception''', or '''gustation'''&lt;ref&gt;[[Adjectival form]]: [[wikt:gustatory|gustatory]]&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the five traditional [[sense]]s that belongs to the '''gustatory system'''.

Taste is the sensation produced when a substance in the mouth [[biochemistry|reacts chemically]] with [[taste receptor]] cells located on [[taste bud]]s in the [[oral cavity]], mostly on the [[tongue]]. Taste, along with smell ([[olfaction]]) and [[trigeminal nerve]] stimulation (registering texture, pain, and temperature), determines [[flavor]]s of [[food]] and/or other substances. Humans have taste receptors on taste buds (gustatory calyculi) and other areas including the upper surface of the [[tongue]] and the [[epiglottis]].&lt;ref name=kids&gt;[http://kidshealth.org/kid/talk/qa/taste_buds.html What Are Taste Buds?] kidshealth.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dNhFLnc6NRkC&amp;lpg=PA201&amp;ots=D2KQ-D740L&amp;dq=taste%20bud%20concentrated&amp;pg=PA201#v=onepage&amp;q=taste%20bud%20concentrated&amp;f=false Human biology (Page 201/464)] Daniel D. Chiras. Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[gustatory cortex]] is responsible for the perception of taste.

The tongue is covered with thousands of small bumps called [[lingual papillae|papillae]], which are visible to the naked eye.  Within each papilla are hundreds of taste buds.&lt;ref name = Schacter169&gt;{{cite book|last=Schacter|first=Daniel|title=Psychology Second Edition|year=2009|publisher=Worth Publishers|location=United States of America|isbn=978-1-4292-3719-2|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exception to this is the [[filiform papillae]] that do not contain taste buds. There are between 2000 and 5000&lt;ref name="Boron, W.F. 2003"&gt;Boron, W.F., E.L. Boulpaep. 2003. Medical Physiology. 1st ed. Elsevier Science USA.&lt;/ref&gt; taste buds that are located on the back and front of the tongue.  Others are located on the roof, sides and back of the mouth, and in the throat. Each taste bud contains 50 to 100 taste receptor cells.

The sensation of taste includes five established basic tastes: [[sweetness]], [[sourness]], [[Taste#Saltiness|saltiness]],  [[Bitter (taste)#Bitterness|bitterness]], and [[umami]].&lt;ref name=Kean&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kean|first1=Sam|title=The science of satisfaction|journal=Distillations Magazine|date=Fall 2015|volume=1|issue=3|pages=5|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/the-science-of-satisfaction|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0072592/|title= How does our sense of taste work?|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=6 January 2012 |website= PubMed |accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific experiments have demonstrated that these five tastes exist and are distinct from one another.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} Taste buds are able to distinguish between different tastes through detecting interaction with different molecules or ions. Sweet, savory, and bitter tastes are triggered by the binding of molecules to [[G protein-coupled receptors]] on the [[cell membrane]]s of taste buds. Saltiness and sourness are perceived when [[alkali metal]] or [[hydrogen]] [[ions]] enter taste buds, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Human Physiology: An integrated approach 5th Edition -Silverthorn, Chapter-10, Page-354&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic tastes contribute only partially to the sensation and flavor of food in the mouth—other factors include [[Odor|smell]],&lt;ref name=kids/&gt; detected by the [[olfactory epithelium]] of the nose;&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/nosek.html Smell - The Nose Knows] washington.edu, Eric H.

Rosenthal. Springer, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; temperature, detected by [[thermoreceptor]]s; and "coolness" (such as of [[menthol]]) and "hotness" ([[pungency]]), through [[chemesthesis]].

As taste senses both harmful and beneficial things, all basic tastes are classified as either aversive or appetitive, depending upon the effect the things they sense have on our bodies.&lt;ref name=aa&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=two-great-tastes-not-great-together Why do two great tastes sometimes not taste great together?] scientificamerican.com.

Among [[human]]s, taste perception begins to fade around 50 years of age because of loss of tongue papillae and a general decrease in [[saliva]] production.&lt;ref name="SeidelBall2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Henry M Seidel|author2=Jane W Ball|author3=Joyce E Dains|title=Mosby's Guide to Physical Examination|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j7HSCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA303|date=1 February 2010|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=978-0-323-07357-8|page=303|authormask=|trans-title=|format=|origyear=|oclc=|doi=|bibcode=|id=|quote=|laysummary=|laydate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans can also have distortion of tastes through [[dysgeusia]].

==Basic tastes==
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2016}}
Taste in the gustatory system allows humans to distinguish between safe and harmful food, and to gauge foods’ nutritional value. [[Digestive enzyme]]s in saliva begin to dissolve food into base chemicals that are washed over the papillae and detected as tastes by the taste buds. The tongue is covered with thousands of small bumps called [[lingual papillae|papillae]], which are visible to the naked eye.  Within each papilla are hundreds of taste buds.&lt;ref name="Schacter169"/&gt; The exception to this are the [[filiform papillae]] that do not contain taste buds. There are between 2000 and 5000&lt;ref name="Boron, W.F. 2003"/&gt; taste buds that are located on the back and front of the tongue.  Others are located on the roof, sides and back of the mouth, and in the throat. Each taste bud contains 50 to 100 taste receptor cells.

[[Bitter (taste)|Bitter]] foods are generally found unpleasant, while [[sour]], [[saltiness|salty]], [[sweet]], and [[umami]] tasting foods generally provide a pleasurable sensation.  The five specific tastes received by [[taste receptor]]s are saltiness, sweetness, bitterness, sourness, and ''[[umami|savoriness]]'', often known by its Japanese term "umami" which translates to ‘delicious’. As of the early twentieth century, Western physiologists and psychologists believed there were four basic tastes: sweetness, sourness, saltiness, and bitterness. At that time, savoriness was not identified,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ikeda | first=Kikunae | title=New Seasonings | journal=Chemical Senses |origyear=First published 1909 | year= 2002 | volume=27 | issue=9 | pages= 847–849 |url=http://chemse.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/27/9/847|format=PDF|accessdate=30 December 2007 | doi=10.1093/chemse/27.9.847 | pmid=12438213}}&lt;/ref&gt; but now a large number of authorities recognize it as the fifth taste.

One study found that both salt and sour taste mechanisms detect, in different ways, the presence of [[sodium chloride]] (salt) in the mouth, however, acids are also detected and perceived as sour.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Lindemann | first=Bernd | title=Receptors and transduction in taste| journal=Nature |date=13 September 2001 | volume=413 |pages= 219–225|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v413/n6852/pdf/413219a0.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=30 December 2007 | doi=10.1038/35093032| pmid=11557991 | issue=6852}}&lt;/ref&gt; The detection of salt is important to many organisms, but specifically mammals, as it serves a critical role in ion and water [[homeostasis]] in the body.  It is specifically needed in the mammalian [[kidney]] as an osmotically active compound which facilitates passive re-uptake of water into the blood.{{citation needed|reason=Which studies purport this?|date=September 2016}} Because of this, salt elicits a pleasant taste in most humans.

Sour and salt tastes can be pleasant in small quantities, but in larger quantities become more and more unpleasant to taste. For sour taste this is presumably because the sour taste can signal under-ripe fruit, rotten meat, and other spoiled foods, which can be dangerous to the body because of bacteria which grow in such media. Additionally, sour taste signals [[acids]], which can cause serious tissue damage.

The bitter taste is almost universally unpleasant to humans. This is because many [[nitrogenous]] [[organic compound|organic molecules]] which have a [[pharmacology|pharmacological]] effect on humans taste bitter. These include [[caffeine]], [[nicotine]], and [[strychnine]], which respectively compose the stimulant in [[coffee]], addictive agent in [[cigarettes]], and active compound in many [[pesticides]]. It appears that some psychological process allows humans to overcome their innate aversion to bitter taste, as caffeinated drinks are widely consumed and enjoyed around the world. Many common medicines have a bitter taste if chewed; the gustatory system apparently interprets these compounds as poisons. In this manner, the unpleasant reaction to the bitter taste is a last-line warning system before the compound is ingested and can do damage.

Sweet taste signals the presence of [[carbohydrates]] in solution. Since carbohydrates have a very high calorie count ([[saccharides]] have many bonds, therefore much energy), they are desirable to the human body, which evolved to seek out the highest calorie intake foods. They are used as direct energy ([[sugars]]) and storage of energy ([[glycogen]]). However, there are many non-carbohydrate molecules that trigger a sweet response, leading to the development of many artificial sweeteners, including [[saccharin]], [[sucralose]], and [[aspartame]]. It is still unclear how these substances activate the sweet receptors and what adaptational significance this has had.

The [[umami|savory]] taste (known in Japanese as "umami") was identified by Japanese chemist [[Kikunae Ikeda]] of [[University of Tokyo|Tokyo Imperial University]], which signals the presence of the [[amino acid]] [[L-glutamate]], triggers a pleasurable response and thus encourages the intake of [[peptides]] and [[proteins]]. The amino acids in proteins are used in the body to build muscles and organs, transport molecules ([[hemoglobin]]), [[antibodies]], and the organic catalysts known as [[enzymes]]. These are all critical molecules, and as such it is important to have a steady supply of amino acids, hence the pleasurable response to their presence in the mouth.

In [[Asia]]n countries within the sphere of mainly [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]] and [[Indian cuisine|Indian]] cultural influence, [[pungency]] (piquancy or hotness) had traditionally been considered a sixth basic taste.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; In 2015, researchers suggested a new basic taste of fatty acids called fat taste,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keast|first=Russell SJ|last2=Costanzo|first2=Andrew|date=2015-02-03|title=Is fat the sixth taste primary?

===Sweetness===

Sweetness, usually regarded as a pleasurable sensation, is produced by the presence of [[sugar]]s and a few other substances. Sweetness is often connected to [[aldehyde]]s and [[ketone]]s, which contain a [[carbonyl group]]. Sweetness is detected by a variety of [[G protein coupled receptor]]s coupled to the [[G protein]] [[gustducin]] found on the [[taste bud]]s. At least two different variants of the "sweetness receptors" must be activated for the brain to register sweetness. Compounds the brain senses as sweet are thus compounds that can bind with varying bond strength to two different sweetness receptors. These receptors are T1R2+3 (heterodimer) and T1R3 (homodimer), which account for all sweet sensing in humans and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zhao |first=Grace Q. |author2=Yifeng Zhang |author3=Mark A.

For [[lactose]] it is 30 millimoles per liter, with a sweetness index of 0.3,&lt;ref name=" textbookofmedicalphysiology8thed" /&gt; and [[5-Nitro-2-propoxyaniline]] 0.002 millimoles per liter. “Natural” sweeteners such as [[saccharide]]s activate the GPCR, which releases [[gustducin]]. The gustducin then activates the molecule [[adenylate cyclase]], which catalyzes the production of the molecule [[cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]], or adenosine 3', 5'-cyclic monophosphate. This molecule closes potassium ion channels, leading to depolarization and neurotransmitter release. Synthetic sweeteners such as [[saccharin]] activate different GPCRs and induce taste receptor cell depolarization by an alternate pathway.

===Sourness===
{{Redirect|Sour}}[[File:Signal Transaction of Taste; Sour &amp; Salty.svg|thumb|The diagram depicts the signal transduction pathway of the sour or salty taste. Object A is a taste bud, object B is a taste receptor cell within object A, and object C is the neuron attached to object B. I. Part I is the reception of hydrogen ions or sodium ions. 1.

Sourness is the taste that detects [[acid]]ity. The sourness of substances is rated relative to dilute [[hydrochloric acid]], which has a sourness index of 1. By comparison, [[tartaric acid]] has a sourness index of 0.7, [[citric acid]] an index of 0.46, and [[carbonic acid]] an index of 0.06.&lt;ref name=" textbookofmedicalphysiology8thed" /&gt;&lt;ref name=McLaughlin&amp;Margolskee/&gt;

Sour taste is detected by a small subset of cells that are distributed across all taste buds in the tongue. Sour taste cells can be identified by expression of the protein [[PKD2L1]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/08/060823184824.htm| title=Biologists Discover How We Detect Sour Taste |publisher=Sciencedaily.com |date=24 August 2006 |accessdate=4 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this gene is not required for sour responses. There is evidence that the protons that are abundant in sour substances can directly enter the sour taste cells through apically located ion channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title= A proton current drives action potentials in genetically identified sour taste cells|author1=Rui Chang, Hang Waters  |author2=Emily Liman  |lastauthoramp=yes | journal= Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A|date= 2010 | volume=107 | issue=51 | pages=22320–22325 | pmc= 3009759

It has also been proposed that weak acids such as acetic acid, which is not fully dissociated at physiological pH values, can penetrate taste cells and thereby elicit an electrical response. According to this mechanism, intracellular hydrogen ions inhibit potassium channels, which normally function to hyperpolarize the cell.
By a combination of direct intake of hydrogen ions (which itself depolarizes the cell) and the inhibition of the hyperpolarizing channel, sourness causes the taste cell to fire action potentials and release neurotransmitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The K+ channel KIR2.1 functions in tandem with proton influx to mediate sour taste transduction | author=Ye, W., Chang, R.

The most common food group that contains naturally sour foods is [[fruit]], such as [[lemon]], [[grape]], [[Orange (fruit)|orange]], [[tamarind]], and sometimes [[melon]]. [[Wine]] also usually has a sour tinge to its flavor, and if not kept correctly, [[milk]] can spoil and develop a sour taste.

Many of these candies contain citric acid or [[malic acid]].

===Saltiness===
{{Redirect|Saltiness|the saltiness in the water|Salinity}}
The simplest receptor found in the mouth is the [[sodium chloride]] (salt) receptor. Saltiness is a taste produced primarily by the presence of [[sodium ion]]s. Other ions of the [[alkali metals]] group also taste salty, but the further from sodium, the less salty the sensation is.  A [[sodium channel]] in the taste cell wall allows sodium [[cation]]s to enter the cell. This on its own depolarizes the cell, and opens [[voltage-dependent calcium channel]]s, flooding the cell with positive calcium ions and leading to [[neurotransmitter]] release. This sodium channel is known as an [[epithelial sodium channel]] (ENaC) and is composed of three subunits. An ENaC can be blocked by the drug [[amiloride]] in many mammals, especially rats. The sensitivity of the salt taste to amiloride in humans, however, is much less pronounced, leading to conjecture that there may be additional receptor proteins besides ENaC to be discovered.

The size of [[lithium]] and [[potassium]] ions most closely resemble those of sodium, and thus the saltiness is most similar. In contrast, [[rubidium]] and [[caesium]] ions are far larger, so their salty taste differs accordingly.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} The saltiness of substances is rated relative to sodium chloride (NaCl), which has an index of 1.&lt;ref name=" textbookofmedicalphysiology8thed" /&gt;&lt;ref name=McLaughlin&amp;Margolskee /&gt; Potassium, as [[potassium chloride]] (KCl), is the principal ingredient in [[salt substitute]]s and has a saltiness index of 0.6.&lt;ref name=" textbookofmedicalphysiology8thed" /&gt;&lt;ref name=McLaughlin&amp;Margolskee/&gt;

Other [[Valence (chemistry)|monovalent]] [[cations]], e.g. [[ammonium]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), and [[divalent]] cations of the [[alkali earth metal]] group of the [[periodic table]], e.g. calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;), ions generally elicit a bitter rather than a salty taste even though they, too, can pass directly through ion channels in the tongue, generating an [[action potential]]. But the chloride of calcium is saltier and less bitter than potassium chloride, and is commonly used in pickle brine instead of KCl.

===Bitterness===

Part III is the response of the taste cell. 6. This leads to increased levels of Ca+. 7. The neurotransmitters are activated. 8. The signal is sent to the neuron.]]

Bitterness is the most sensitive of the tastes, and many perceive it as unpleasant, sharp, or disagreeable, but it is sometimes desirable and intentionally added via various [[bittering agent]]s. Common bitter foods and beverages include [[coffee]], unsweetened [[Hot chocolate|cocoa]], South American [[Mate (beverage)|mate]], [[bitter gourd]], [[Olive (fruit)|olives]], [[Peel (fruit)|citrus peel]], many plants in the family [[Brassicaceae]], [[dandelion]] greens, wild [[chicory]], and [[escarole]].

Drayna |title=Natural selection and molecular evolution in PTC, a bitter-taste receptor gene |journal=Am J Hum Genet |volume=74 |year=2004 |pages=637–646 |doi=10.1086/383092|pmid=14997422 |issue=4 |pmc=1181941}}&lt;/ref&gt; This genetic variation in the ability to taste a substance has been a source of great interest to those who study genetics.

Gustducin is made of three subunits. When it is activated by the GPCR, its subunits break apart and activate [[phosphodiesterase]], a nearby enzyme, which in turn converts a precursor within the cell into a secondary messenger, which closes potassium ion channels.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Also, this secondary messenger can stimulate the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] to release Ca2+ which contributes to depolarization. This leads to a build-up of potassium ions in the cell, depolarization, and neurotransmitter release. It is also possible for some bitter tastants to interact directly with the G protein, because of a structural similarity to the relevant GPCR.

===Savoriness===
{{Main| Umami}}

Savory, or savoriness is an [[appetite|appetitive]] taste&lt;ref name=aa/&gt; and is occasionally described by its Japanese name, [[umami]]&lt;ref&gt;

Some savory taste buds respond specifically to glutamate in the same way that "sweet" ones respond to sugar. Glutamate binds to a variant of [[G protein coupled receptor|G protein coupled glutamate receptors]].&lt;ref name="Lindemann B 99–100"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lindemann B |title=A taste for umami |journal=Nature Neuroscience |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=99–100 |date=February 2000  |pmid=10649560 |doi=10.1038/72153}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chaudhari N, Landin AM, Roper SD 113–9"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chaudhari N, Landin AM, Roper SD |title=A metabotropic glutamate receptor variant functions as a taste receptor |journal=Nature Neuroscience |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=113–9 |date=February 2000  |pmid=10649565 |doi=10.1038/72053}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that the amino acid L-glutamate bonds to a type of GPCR known as a metabotropic glutamate receptor ([[Metabotropic glutamate receptor 4|mGluR4]]).  This causes the G-protein complex to activate a secondary receptor, which ultimately leads to neurotransmitter release. The intermediate steps are not known.

==Measuring relative tastes==
Measuring the degree to which a substance presents one basic taste can be achieved in a subjective way by comparing its taste to a reference substance.

'''Sweetness''' is subjectively measured by comparing the threshold values, or level at which the presence of a dilute substance can be detected by a human taster, of different sweet substances.&lt;ref name=Tsai2007&gt;{{citation |date=14 May 2007 |author=Tsai, Michelle |title=How Sweet It Is?

==Functional structure==
[[File:1402 The Tongue.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Taste buds and papillae of the tongue]]

In the human body a [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] refers to a form of energy which elicits a physiological or psychological action or response. [[Sensory receptors]] are the structures in the body which change the stimulus from one form of energy to another. This can mean changing the presence of a chemical, sound wave, source of heat, or touch to the skin into an electrical [[action potential]] which can be understood by the brain, the body’s control center. Sensory receptors are modified ends of sensory [[neurons]]; modified to deal with specific types of stimulus, thus there are many different types of sensory receptors in the body. The neuron is the primary component of the nervous system, which transmits messages from sensory receptors all over the body.

Taste is a form of [[chemoreception]] which occurs in the specialised [[taste receptor]]s in the mouth. To date, there are five different types of taste receptors known: salt, sweet, sour, bitter, and umami. Each receptor has a different manner of [[sensory transduction]]: that is, of detecting the presence of a certain compound and starting an action potential which alerts the brain. It is a matter of debate whether each taste cell is tuned to one specific tastant or to several; Smith and Margolskee claim that "gustatory neurons typically respond to more than one kind of stimulus, [a]lthough each neuron responds most strongly to one tastant". Researchers{{who|date=September 2016}} believe that the brain interprets complex tastes by examining patterns from a large set of neuron responses. This enables the body to make "keep or spit out" decisions when there is more than one tastant present. "No single neuron type alone is capable of discriminating among stimuli or different qualities, because a given cell can respond the same way to disparate stimuli."{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} As well, [[serotonin]] is thought to act as an intermediary hormone which communicates with taste cells within a taste bud, mediating the signals being sent to the brain. Receptor molecules are found on the top of [[microvilli]] of the taste cells.

;Sweetness
Sweetness is produced by the presence of [[sugar]]s, some proteins, and a few other substances.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} It is often connected to [[aldehyde]]s and [[ketone]]s, which contain a [[carbonyl group]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Sweetness is detected by a variety of [[G protein-coupled receptor]]s coupled to a [[G protein]] that acts as an intermediary in the communication between taste bud and brain, [[gustducin]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/04/science/how-the-taste-bud-translates-between-tongue-and-brain.html?pagewanted=all How the Taste Bud Translates Between Tongue and Brain] nytimes.com, 4 August 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; These receptors are T1R2+3 (heterodimer) and T1R3 (homodimer), which account for sweet sensing in humans and other animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Zhao GQ, Zhang Y, Hoon MA, etal |title=The receptors for mammalian sweet and umami taste |journal=Cell |volume=115 |issue=3 |pages=255–66 |date=October 2003  |pmid=14636554 |doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(03)00844-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Saltiness
Saltiness is a taste produced best by the presence of [[ion|cations]] (such as {{chem|Na|+}}, {{chem|K|+}} or {{chem|Li|+}})&lt;ref name=ion/&gt; and is directly detected by cation influx into glial like cells via leak channels causing depolarisation of the cell.&lt;ref name=ion/&gt;

Other [[Valence (chemistry)|monovalent]] [[cations]], e.g., [[ammonium]], {{chem|NH|4|+}}, and [[divalent]] cations of the [[alkali earth metal]] group of the [[periodic table]], e.g., calcium, {{chem|Ca|2+}}, ions, in general, elicit a bitter rather than a salty taste even though they, too, can pass directly through [[ion channel]]s in the tongue.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Further sensations and transmission==
The tongue can also feel other sensations not generally included in the basic tastes. These are largely detected by the [[somatosensory]] system. In humans, the sense of taste is conveyed via three of the twelve cranial nerves.  The [[facial nerve]] (VII) carries taste sensations from the anterior two thirds of the [[tongue]], the [[glossopharyngeal nerve]] (IX) carries taste sensations from the posterior one third of the tongue while a branch of the [[vagus nerve]] (X) carries some taste sensations from the back of the oral cavity.

The [[trigeminal nerve]] (cranial nerve V) provides information concerning the general texture of food as well as the taste-related sensations of peppery or hot (from [[spices]]).

===Pungency (also spiciness or hotness)===
{{Main|Pungency|Scoville scale}}

Substances such as [[ethanol]] and [[capsaicin]] cause a burning sensation by inducing a trigeminal nerve reaction together with normal taste reception. The sensation of heat is caused by the food's activating nerves that express [[TRPV1]] and [[TRPA1]] receptors. Some such plant-derived compounds that provide this sensation are capsaicin from [[chili pepper]]s, [[piperine]] from [[black pepper]], [[gingerol]] from [[ginger root]] and [[allyl isothiocyanate]] from [[horseradish]]. The [[pungency|piquant]] ("hot" or "spicy") sensation provided by such foods and spices plays an important role in a diverse range of cuisines across the world—especially in equatorial and sub-tropical climates, such as [[Cuisine of Ethiopia|Ethiopian]], [[peruvian cuisine|Peruvian]], [[Hungarian cuisine|Hungarian]], [[Indian cuisine|Indian]], [[Cuisine of Korea|Korean]], [[Indonesian cuisine|Indonesian]], [[Cuisine of Laos|Lao]], [[Malaysian cuisine|Malaysian]], [[Mexican cuisine|Mexican]], [[New Mexican cuisine|New Mexican]], [[Singaporean cuisine|Singaporean]], [[Southwest China|Southwest Chinese]] (including [[Szechuan cuisine]]), [[Vietnamese cuisine|Vietnamese]], and [[Cuisine of Thailand|Thai]] cuisines.

This particular sensation, called [[chemesthesis]], is not a taste in the technical sense, because the sensation does not arise from taste buds, and a different set of nerve fibers carry it to the brain. Foods like chili peppers activate nerve fibers directly; the sensation interpreted as "hot" results from the stimulation of somatosensory (pain/temperature) fibers on the tongue. Many parts of the body with exposed membranes but no taste sensors (such as the nasal cavity, under the fingernails, [[Cornea|surface of the eye]] or a wound) produce a similar sensation of heat when exposed to hotness agents. [[Asia]]n countries within the sphere of, mainly,  [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]], [[Indian cuisine|Indian]], and [[Japanese cuisine|Japanese]] cultural influence, often wrote of [[pungency]] as a fifth or sixth taste.

===Coolness===
Some substances activate cold [[trigeminal]] receptors even when not at low temperatures. This "fresh" or "minty" sensation can be tasted in [[peppermint]], [[spearmint]], [[menthol]], ethanol, and [[camphor]]. Caused by activation of the same mechanism that signals cold, [[TRPM8]] ion channels on [[neuron|nerve cells]], unlike the actual change in temperature described for sugar substitutes, this coolness is only a perceived phenomenon.

===Numbness===
Both Chinese and [[Toba Batak people|Batak Toba]] cooking include the idea of 麻 (''má'' or ''mati rasa''), a tingling numbness caused by spices such as [[Sichuan pepper]]. The cuisines of [[Sichuan]] province in China and of the Indonesian province of [[North Sumatra]] often combine this with [[chili pepper]] to produce a 麻辣 ''málà'', "numbing-and-hot", or "mati rasa" flavor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gernot-katzers-spice-pages.com/engl/Zant_pip.html|title=Spice Pages:  Sichuan Pepper (Zanthoxylum, Szechwan peppercorn, fagara, hua jiao, sansho 山椒, timur, andaliman, tirphal)|first=Gernot|last=Katzer|website=gernot-katzers-spice-pages.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sensations although not taste fall into a category of [[Chemesthesis]].

===Astringency===
Some foods, such as unripe fruits, contain [[tannins]] or [[calcium oxalate]] that cause an astringent or puckering sensation of the mucous membrane of the mouth. Examples include [[tea]], [[red wine]], [[rhubarb]], some fruits of the genus ''[[Syzygium]]'', and unripe [[persimmon]]s and [[banana]]s.

Less exact terms for the astringent sensation are "dry", "rough", "harsh" (especially for wine), "tart" (normally referring to sourness), "rubbery", "hard" or "styptic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peleg|first1=Hanna|last2=Gacon|first2=Karine|last3=Schlich|first3=Pascal|last4=Noble|first4=Ann C|title=Bitterness and astringency of flavan-3-ol monomers, dimers and trimers|journal=Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture|date=June 1999|volume=79|issue=8|pages=1123–1128|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199906)79:8&lt;1123::AID-JSFA336&gt;3.0.CO;2-D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When referring to wine, ''dry'' is the opposite of ''sweet,'' and does not refer to astringency. Wines that contain tannins and so cause an astringent sensation are not necessarily classified as "dry", and "dry" wines are not necessarily astringent.

In the Indian [[Ayurveda|Ayurvedic tradition]], one of the six tastes is astringency (''kasaaya'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ayurshop.com/diet/rasas.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008083229/http://www.ayurshop.com/diet/rasas.html|date=8 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Sinhala Language|Sinhala]] and [[Sri Lankan English]] it is referred to as ''kahata''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mirisgala.net/Updates/SL_English_Updates_K.html|title=Sri Lankan English - Updates K|website=www.mirisgala.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Tamil it is referred to as thuvarppu.

===Metallicness===
A metallic taste may be caused by food and drink, certain medicines or [[amalgam (dentistry)|amalgam]] dental fillings. It is generally considered an off flavor when present in food and drink. A metallic taste may be caused by [[Galvanic cell|galvanic]] reactions in the mouth. In the case where it is caused by dental work, the dissimilar metals used may produce a measurable current.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toothbody.com/art-battery-in-your-mouth.php|title=Is there a Battery in your Mouth? |publisher=www.toothbody.com |accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some artificial sweeteners are perceived to have a metallic taste, which is detected by the [[TRPV1]] receptors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Riera |first1=Céline E. |last2=Vogel |first2=Horst |last3=Simon |first3=Sidney A. |last4=le Coutre |first4=Johannes |title=Artificial sweeteners and salts producing a metallic taste sensation activate TRPV1 receptors. |date=2007 |journal=American Journal of Physiology |volume=293 |number=2 |pages=R626-R634 |doi=10.1152/ajpregu.00286.2007 |pmid=17567713 |url=http://ajpregu.physiology.org/content/293/2/R626 |accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many people consider [[blood]] to have a metallic taste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Willard|first=James P.|year=1905|title=Current Events|journal=Progress: A Monthly Journal Devoted to Medicine and Surgery|volume=4|pages=861–68|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6xygAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA862}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Monosson|first=Emily|title=Evolution in a Toxic World: How Life Responds to Chemical Threats|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vqtrn8iwtecC&amp;pg=PA49|year=2012|publisher=Island Press|isbn=9781597269766|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; A metallic taste in the mouth is also a symptom of various medical conditions, in which case it may be classified under the symptoms [[dysgeusia]] or [[parageusia]], referring to distortions of the sense of taste,&lt;ref name=goldstein&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldstein|first=E.

Other possible fat taste receptors have been identified. [[G protein-coupled receptor]]s [[GPR120]] and [[Free fatty acid receptor 1|GPR40]] have been linked to fat taste, because their absence resulted in reduced preference to two types of fatty acid ([[linoleic acid]] and [[oleic acid]]), as well as decreased neuronal response to oral fatty acids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Proposed alternate names to fat taste include oleogustus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Running |first1=Cordelia A. |last2=Craig |first2=Bruce A. |last3=Mattes |first3=Richard D. |date=3 July 2015 |title=Oleogustus: The Unique Taste of Fat |url=http://chemse.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/07/02/chemse.bjv036.abstract?sid=f45a0d90-7258-44e9-ac06-35ffde1b9bb1 |journal=Chemical Senses |publisher= |volume=40 |issue=6 |pages= 507–516|doi=10.1093/chemse/bjv036 |accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and pinguis,&lt;ref name="Reed 353S–360S"/&gt; although these terms are not widely accepted. The main form of fat that is commonly ingested is [[triglycerides]], which are composed of three fatty acids bound together. In this state, triglycerides are able to give fatty foods unique textures that are often described as creaminess. But this texture is not an actual taste. It is only during ingestion that the fatty acids that make up triglycerides are hydrolysed into fatty acids via lipases. The taste is commonly related to other, more negative, tastes such as bitter and sour due to how unpleasant the taste is for humans. Richard Mattes, a co-author of the study, explained that low concentrations of these fatty acids can create an overall better flavor in a food, much like how small uses of bitterness can make certain foods more rounded. However, a high concentration of fatty acids in certain foods is generally considered inedible.&lt;ref name="Purdue"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2015/Q3/research-confirms-fat-is-sixth-taste-names-it-oleogustus.html |title=Research confirms fat is sixth taste; names it oleogustus |last1=Neubert |first1=Amy Patterson |date=23 July 2015 |website=Purdue News |publisher=[[Purdue University]] |access-date=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; To demonstrate that individuals can distinguish fat taste from other tastes, the researchers separated volunteers into groups and had them try samples that also contained the other basic tastes. Volunteers were able to separate the taste of fatty acids into their own category, with some overlap with savory samples, which the researchers hypothesized was due to poor familiarity with both. The researchers note that the usual "creaminess and viscosity we associate with fatty foods is largely due to triglycerides", unrelated to the taste; while the actual taste of [[fatty acids]] is not pleasant. Mattes described the taste as "more of a warning system" that a certain food should not be eaten.&lt;ref name="oleogustus"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://doi.org/10.1186/2044-7248-4-5|title=Is fat the sixth taste primary?

There are few regularly consumed foods rich in fat taste, due to the negative flavor that is evoked in large quantities. Foods whose flavor to which fat taste makes a small contribution include olive oil and fresh butter, along with various kinds of vegetable and nut oils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Feldhausen |first=Teresa Shipley |date=31 July 2015 |title=The five basic tastes have sixth sibling: oleogustus |url=https://www.sciencenews.org/article/five-basic-tastes-have-sixth-sibling-oleogustus |newspaper=[[Science News]] |access-date=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heartiness (''kokumi'')===
Some Japanese researchers refer to the ''kokumi'' of foods. This sensation has also been described as mouthfulness,&lt;ref name="foodprot"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Hettiarachchy |editor1-first=Navam S. |editor2-last=Sato |editor2-first=Kenji |editor3-last=Marshall |editor3-first=Maurice R. |title=Food proteins and peptides: chemistry, functionality interactions, and commercialization |date=2010 |publisher=CRC |location=Boca Raton, Fla. |isbn=9781420093414 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-h8UEImN7SAC&amp;pg=PA290&amp;dq=kokumi |accessdate=26 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|290}} and appears to be related to a number of {{nowrap|[[alpha and beta carbon|γ]]-[[dextrorotation and levorotation|L]]-[[glutamic acid|glutamyl]] peptides}}, which activate a [[calcium-sensing receptor]] which is also sensitive to [[glutathione]].&lt;ref name="foodprot"/&gt;

===Temperature===
Temperature can be an essential element of the taste experience. Food and drink that—in a given culture—is traditionally served hot is often considered distasteful if cold, and vice versa. For example, alcoholic beverages, with a few exceptions, are usually thought best when served at room temperature or chilled to varying degrees, but soups—again, with exceptions—are usually only eaten hot. A cultural example are [[soft drinks]]. In North America it is almost always preferred cold, regardless of season.

===Starchiness===
A 2016 study suggested that humans can taste [[starch]] (specifically, a [[glucose]] [[oligomer]]) independently of other tastes such as sweetness. However, no specific chemical receptor has yet been found for this taste.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lapis|first=Trina J.|last2=Penner|first2=Michael H.|last3=Lim|first3=Juyun|date=23 August 2016|title=Humans Can Taste Glucose Oligomers Independent of the hT1R2/hT1R3 Sweet Taste Receptor|url=https://nature.berkeley.edu/garbelottoat/wp-content/uploads/lapis-etal-2106.pdf|journal=Chemical Senses|language=en|pages=bjw088|doi=10.1093/chemse/bjw088|issn=0379-864X|pmid=27553043|volume=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Alexa J.|last1=Pullicin|first2=Michael H.|last2=Penner|first3=Juyun|last3=Lim|title=Human taste detection of glucose oligomers with low degree of polymerization|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0183008|journal=PLOS ONE|date=29 August 2017|issn=1932-6203|pages=e0183008|volume=12|issue=8|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0183008|bibcode=2017PLoSO..1283008P}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2104244-there-is-now-a-sixth-taste-and-it-explains-why-we-love-carbs/|title=There is now a sixth taste – and it explains why we love carbs|last=Hamzelou|first=Jessica|date=2 September 2016|website=[[New Scientist]]|publisher=|language=en-US|access-date=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[greater petrosal nerve|greater petrosal]], [[lesser palatine nerve|lesser palatine]]  and [[zygomatic nerve]]s all synapse here. The greater petrosal, carries soft palate taste signals to the facial nerve. The lesser palatine sends signals to the [[nasal cavity]]; which is why spicy foods cause nasal drip. The zygomatic sends signals to the [[lacrimal nerve]] that activate the [[lacrimal gland]]; which is the reason that spicy foods can cause tears. Both the lesser palatine and the zygomatic are [[maxillary nerve]]s (from the [[trigeminal nerve]]).

The [[special visceral afferent]]s of the [[vagus nerve]] carry taste from the [[epiglottis|epiglottal]] region of the tongue.

The lingual nerve (trigeminal, not shown in diagram) is deeply interconnected with chorda tympani in that it provides all other sensory info from the ⅔ of the tongue.&lt;ref&gt;Mu, Liancai, and Ira Sanders.

==Other concepts==
===Taste as a philosophical concept===
{{See also|Philosophy of perception}}

Taste can be objective in terms of the five tastes (sweet, salt, sour, bitter, and savory) but it can also be subjective in terms of what we deem "good" and "bad." Taste is "subjective, objective, and qualitative".&lt;ref name="Schehr, Lawrence R. 2001"&gt;Schehr, Lawrence R., and Allen S. Weiss. French Food: On the Table, on the Page, and in French Culture. New York: Routledge, 2001. 228-41. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of it being a philosophical concept, taste is hard to define because it is essentially subjective when pertaining to the personal preferences of individuals i.e. "'de gustibus non est disputandum' (there is no disputing taste)".&lt;ref name="Schehr, Lawrence R. 2001"/&gt; We cannot tell someone they do not ''think'' something tastes good because we do not agree, and vice versa. In order to evaluate taste in this context, we must explore all the ways in which taste can be defined. According to Alan Weiss, taste fulfills the purpose of six functions: taste is the tool in which we use to define flavor; it is also flavor and how we categorize flavor (sweet or salty); it is the preference, we as the tastemakers, place on specific flavors and our demand for those flavors; it is whether we choose to like or dislike a certain taste and therefore allow it into our general society of acceptable tastes or exile it; it is the value in which we place on certain taste (one might believe one's taste in Bach or Rothko earns one capital); and lastly, with good judgement comes good taste and therefore, one with expressively good taste are expected to have good judgement, just as those in bad taste are expected to be in bad judgement &lt;ref&gt;Schehr, Lawrence R., and Allen S. Weiss. French Food: On the Table, on the Page, and in French Culture. New York: Routledge, 2001. 228-41. Print.).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supertasters===
{{Main|Supertaster}}

A supertaster is a person whose sense of taste is significantly more sensitive than average. The cause of this heightened response is likely, at least in part, due to an increased number of [[fungiform papillae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bartoshuk L. M. |author2=Duffy V. B. | year = 1994 | title = PTC/PROP tasting: anatomy, psychophysics, and sex effects." 1994 | url = | journal = Physiol Behav | volume = 56 | issue = 6| pages = 1165–71 | doi=10.1016/0031-9384(94)90361-1 | pmid=7878086|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that supertasters require less fat and sugar in their food to get the same satisfying effects. However, contrary to what one might think, these people actually tend to consume more salt than the average person. This is due to their heightened sense of the taste of bitterness, and the presence of salt drowns out the taste of bitterness. (This also explains why supertasters prefer salted cheddar cheese over non-salted.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gardner|first=Amanda|title=Love salt?

===Aftertaste===
{{Main|Aftertaste}}

Aftertastes arise after food has been swallowed. An aftertaste can differ from the food it follows. [[Medicine]]s and tablets may also have a lingering aftertaste, as they can contain certain artificial flavor compounds, such as [[aspartame]] (artificial sweetener).

===Acquired taste===
{{Main|Acquired taste}}

An acquired taste often refers to an appreciation for a food or beverage that is unlikely to be enjoyed by a person who has not had substantial exposure to it, usually because of some unfamiliar aspect of the food or beverage, including bitterness, a strong or strange odor, taste, or appearance.

==Clinical significance==
Patients with [[Addison's disease]], pituitary insufficiency, or [[cystic fibrosis]] sometimes have a hyper-sensitivity to the five primary tastes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK385/|title=Clinical Methods: The History, Physical, and Laboratory Examinations|last=Walker|first=H. Kenneth|year=1990|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disorders of taste===
* [[ageusia]] (complete loss of taste)
* [[hypogeusia]] (reduced sense of taste)
* [[dysgeusia]] (distortion in sense of taste)
* [[hypergeusia]] (abnormally heightened sense of taste)

==History==
In [[The Western world|the West]], [[Aristotle]] postulated in [[Circa|c.]] 350 [[BCE]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/soul.html On the Soul] Aristotle. Translated by J. A. Smith. The Internet Classics Archive.&lt;/ref&gt; that the two most basic tastes were sweet and bitter.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QPnxaraJ7LQC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;lpg=PA193&amp;dq=Aristotle+basic+taste+de+anima&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=e-LTAl5jY7&amp;sig=XLE0M7LktCrr7Pf9wChJUZsW5yY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3DuUTPXpIZT4swPVnYTBCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=succulent&amp;f=false Aristotle's De anima (422b10-16)] Ronald M. Polansky. Cambridge University Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the first to develop a list of basic tastes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_GMeW9E1IB4C&amp;pg=PA165&amp;lpg=PA165&amp;dq=Aristotle+basic+taste&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=klU5I_B_b3&amp;sig=4MpIEs5i1PxK122afPa-v3UjV50&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fzqUTNH5AYj2tgOoofHACg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Aristotle%20basic%20taste&amp;f=false Origins of neuroscience: a history of explorations into brain function (Page 165/480)] Stanley Finger. Oxford University Press US, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ayurveda]], an ancient [[India]]n healing science, has its own tradition of basic tastes, comprising [[sweetness|sweet]], [[salt]]y, [[sour]], [[Pungency|pungent]], bitter &amp; [[astringent]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=s2hsBJAp5fYC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Ayurvedic%20balancing%3A%20an%20integration%20of%20Western%20fitness%20with%20Eastern%20wellness&amp;pg=PA25#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20six%20tastes&amp;f=false Ayurvedic balancing: an integration of Western fitness with Eastern wellness (Pages 25-26/188)] Joyce Bueker. Llewellyn Worldwide, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ancient Chinese regarded [[spiciness]] as a basic taste.

==Research==
The [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] for the basic tastes of bitter, sweet and savory have been identified. They are [[G protein-coupled receptor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Bachmanov | first1 = AA. | last2 = Beauchamp | first2 = GK. | title = Taste receptor genes. | journal = Annu Rev Nutr | volume = 27 | issue =  1| pages = 389–414 | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.nutr.26.061505.111329 | PMID = 17444812 | pmc=2721271}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cells that detect sourness have been identified as a subpopulation that express the protein [[PKD2L1]]. The responses are mediated by an influx of protons into the cells but the receptor for sour is still unknown. The receptor for [[amiloride]]-sensitive attractive salty taste in mice has been shown to be a sodium channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Chandrashekar J, Kuhn C, Oka Y, etal |title=The cells and peripheral representation of sodium taste in mice |journal=Nature |volume=464 |issue=7286 |pages=297–301 |date=March 2010 |pmid=20107438 |pmc=2849629 |doi=10.1038/nature08783 |url=|bibcode=2010Natur.464..297C }}&lt;/ref&gt;
There is some evidence for a sixth taste that senses fatty substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Laugerette F, Passilly-Degrace P, Patris B, etal |title=CD36 involvement in orosensory detection of dietary lipids, spontaneous fat preference, and digestive secretions |journal=The Journal of Clinical Investigation |volume=115 |issue=11 |pages=3177–84 |date=November 2005  |pmid=16276419 |pmc=1265871 |doi=10.1172/JCI25299}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Abumrad NA |title=CD36 may determine our desire for dietary fats |journal=The Journal of Clinical Investigation |volume=115 |issue=11 |pages=2965–7 |date=November 2005  |pmid=16276408 |pmc=1265882 |doi=10.1172/JCI26955}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last=Boring |first=Edwin G. | title=Sensation and Perception in the History of Experimental Psychology | publisher=Appleton Century Crofts |year=1942 | page= 453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, researchers found bitter [[taste receptor]]s in lung tissue, which cause airways to relax when a bitter substance is encountered.  They believe this mechanism is evolutionarily adaptive because it helps clear lung infections, but could also be exploited to treat [[asthma]] and [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Deshpande | first1 = D.

{{refbegin}}

'''a.''' {{Note label|a|a|none}} It has been known for some time that these categories may not be comprehensive. In Guyton's 1976 edition of ''Textbook of Medical Physiology'', he wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;On the basis of physiologic studies, there are generally believed to be at least four ''primary'' sensations of taste: ''sour'', ''salty'', ''sweet,'' and ''bitter''. Yet we know that a person can perceive literally hundreds of different tastes. These are all supposed to be combinations of the four primary sensations...However, there might be other less conspicuous classes or subclasses of primary sensations",&lt;ref name=Guyton1976&gt;{{citation |title=Textbook of Medical Physiology |last=Guyton |first=Arthur C. |authorlink=Arthur Guyton |year=1976|edition=5th |page=839|publisher=W.B. Saunders|location=Philadelphia|isbn=0-7216-4393-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''b.''' {{Note label|b|b|none}} Some variation in values is not uncommon between various studies. Such variations may arise from a range of methodological variables, from sampling to analysis and interpretation. In fact there is a "plethora of methods"&lt;ref name=Macbeth&amp;MacClancy2004&gt;{{citation |year=2004 |editor=Macbeth, Helen M. |editor2= MacClancy, Jeremy |chapter=plethora of methods characterising human taste perception |pages=87–88|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZLQTSqfB5igC&amp;pg=PA88 |title=Researching Food Habits: Methods and Problems |series=The anthropology of food and nutrition |volume=Vol. 5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZLQTSqfB5igC |place=New York |publisher=Berghahn Books |isbn=9781571815446|accessdate=15 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the taste index of 1, assigned to reference substances such as sucrose (for sweetness), hydrochloric acid (for sourness), quinine (for bitterness), and sodium chloride (for saltiness), is itself arbitrary for practical purposes.&lt;ref name=Guyton&amp;Hall2006&gt;{{citation |year=2006 |last=Guyton |first=Arthur C |authorlink=Arthur Guyton |last2=Hall |first2=John E. |title=Guyton and Hall Textbook of Medical Physiology |page=664 |edition=11th |publisher=Elsevier Saunders |location=Philadelphia |isbn=0-7216-0240-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some values, such as those for maltose and glucose, vary little. Others, such as aspartame and sodium saccharin, have much larger variation. Regardless of variation, the perceived intensity of substances relative to each reference substance remains consistent for taste ranking purposes. The indices table for McLaughlin &amp; Margolskee (1994) for example,&lt;ref name=" textbookofmedicalphysiology8thed" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McLaughlin&amp;Margolskee1994"&gt;{{cite journal |date=November–December 1994 |author1=McLaughlin, Susan|author2= Margolskee, Rorbert F |title=The Sense of Taste|journal= [[American Scientist]] |volume=82 |issue=6 |pages=538–545}}&lt;/ref&gt; is essentially the same as that of Svrivastava &amp; Rastogi (2003),&lt;ref name=Svrivastava&amp;Rastogi2003&gt;{{Citation |year=2003 |author1=Svrivastava, R.C.  |author2=Rastogi, R.P  |lastauthoramp=yes |chapter=Relative taste indices of some substances |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hIyM_o4YFZ4C&amp;pg=PA274 |title=Transport Mediated by Electrical Interfaces |series=Studies in interface science |volume=18 |place=Amsterdam, Netherlands |publisher=Elsevier Science |isbn=0-444-51453-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hIyM_o4YFZ4C |accessdate=12 September 2010 |postscript=&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Taste indices of table 9, p.274 are select sample taken from table in Guyton's ''Textbook of Medical Physiology'' (present in all editions)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guyton &amp; Hall (2006),&lt;ref name=Guyton&amp;Hall2006/&gt; and Joesten ''et al.'' (2007).&lt;ref name=JoestenEal2007/&gt; The rankings are all the same, with any differences, where they exist, being in the values assigned from the studies from which they derive.

As for the assignment of 1 or 100 to the index substances, this makes no difference to the rankings themselves, only to whether the values are displayed as whole numbers or decimal points. Glucose remains about three-quarters as sweet as sucrose whether displayed as 75 or 0.75.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12479">'''Teaching stories''' is a term used to describe narratives that have been deliberately created as vehicles for the transmission of wisdom. Whilst it is a term that has been used in a number of religious and other traditions, Shah's use of it was in the context of [[Sufi]] teaching and learning, within which this body of material has been described as the "most valuable of the treasures in the human heritage".&lt;ref name="Lessing1"&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=20 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The range of teaching stories is enormous, including anecdotes, accounts of meetings between teachers and pupils, biographies, [[myths]], [[fairy tales]], [[fables]] and [[jokes]]. Such stories frequently have a long life beyond the initial teaching situation and (sometimes in deteriorated form) have contributed vastly to the world's store of [[folklore]] and [[literature]].

==Function==
It is the teaching function of teaching stories that characterises them rather than any other categorisation, however much they may have other uses. Shah likened the Sufi story to a peach:

:"A person may be emotionally stirred by the exterior as if the peach were lent to you. You can eat the peach and taste a further delight ... You can throw away the stone – or crack it and find a delicious kernel within. This is the hidden depth."

Thus these narratives also often have a wide circulation outside of any instructional function, where they frequently have cultural significance and entertainment value, or contain a moral answer or solution of some kind, or are put to use to reinforce belief. What makes them distincively teaching stories however is something different: they are likely to be open-ended, depending on the individual members of their audience for a variety of interpretations. Their purpose is ultimately to change the thinking process itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hardin |first1=Shields Nancy |date=October 1977|title= The Teaching Story and Doris Lessing|journal= Twentieth Century Literature |volume=23 |pages= 314–25 |doi=10.2307/441260}}&lt;/ref&gt; They put at the disposal of those who know them an instrument for measuring themselves, the world and situations that they encounter.&lt;ref&gt;from Learning from Stories, A lecture by Idries Shah before a live audience in 1976 available as audio to download at {{cite web |url=http://ishk.net/sufis/shahaudio.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328085109/http://ishk.net/sufis/shahaudio.html |archivedate=2010-03-28 |df= }}. Accessed March 20, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It is for this reason that the reading, rereading, discussion and interpretation of narratives in a group setting became a significant part of the activities in which the members of Shah's study circles engaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

He would say: ‘that person only wants a guru’, or ‘this person can’t be taught, because he isn’t ready yet to learn’. Those whom he accepted were directed to Sufi teaching-stories and other writing by the great masters – among them Omar Khayyam, Jalaluddin Rumi, Hakim Sanai, El Ghazali and Saadi of Shiraz."&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Doris Lessing]]:
:"A real teaching story, whether thousands of years old, or new, goes far beyond the parables that are still part of our culture. A parable has a simple message: this means that. But in a Sufi teaching story, there may be layers of meaning, some of them not to be verbalized. Current ways of "teaching" literature in schools and universities may make it difficult for literary people to approach Sufi literature as it should be: Sufis do not pull apart a tale to find its meaning, but cite the case of the child who has dismantled a fly and, left with a heap of wings, a head, legs, asks "Where is the fly?" In other words, a student learns to use the mind in ways unfamiliar to us. They "soak themselves" in the material. They ignore the analytical approach, and the practice of memorizing and regurgitating. The meaning of a Sufi tale comes through contemplation, and may take years."&lt;ref name="Lessing1" /&gt;

==Folktales==
Shah described many of the [[Folklore|folktales]] widely dispersed across the world as teaching stories, writing in the introduction to one such tale, [[The Three Princes of Serendip#The lost camel|The Lost Camel]], collected in his ''[[World Tales]]'':

:"Most of the instrumental and interpretative function of the folktale have tended to be overlooked in the literature, which still usually concentrates upon origins, upon fragmentary beliefs enshrined in the tales, and upon the light which is cast by plots and treatments on the attitudes of the people among whom the story is told."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | pages = 336
  | isbn = 0-86304-036-5}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 

Without denying the entertainment or moral value in the stories, Shah emphasised that there is in such tales an often hidden dimension of instruction. Stories, such as those from the [[Thousand and One Nights]] and other collections of traditional myths and folktales, are considered to fall into this category. Modern examples (although maybe not generally recognized as such) are some of the stories that have been retold and adapted by [[Disney animated feature film source material#From folk tales, fairy tales or legends|Disney]]. These tales have been adapted and laid out in the simplest form of their wisdom, making them easily accessible for children in particular. As [[Robert Ornstein]] has written:

:"On the surface teaching stories often appear to be little more than fairy or folk tales. But they are designed to embody - in their characters, plots and imagery - patterns and relationships that nurture a part of the mind that is unreachable in more direct ways, thus increasing our understanding and breadth of vision, in addition to fostering our ability to think critically."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2002/02-147.html|title= Robert Ornstein To Speak at Library of Congress on Afghan "Teaching-Stories" and the Brain|date= October 16, 2002 |publisher= Library of Congress|accessdate=17 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fables==
Though a "moral" is appended to many fables, for instance [[Aesop's Fables|the fables]] of [[Aesop]], Shah insisted that there were levels of meaning hidden in them that lay beyond the merely didactic:
:"The fables of all nations provide a really remarkable example of this, because, if you can understand them at a technical level, they provide the most striking evidence of the persistence of a consistent teaching, preserved sometimes through mere repetition, yet handed down and prized simply because they give a stimulus to the imagination or entertainment for the people at large."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ishk.net/teaching-stories/ | title = The Teaching Story: Observations on the Folklore of Our "Modern" Thought | first = Idries| last = Shah| accessdate = 2017-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nasrudin stories ==
Shah published four books of tales of the [[Mulla Nasrudin]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Exploits of the Incomparable Mulla Nasrudin'', {{ISBN|0-86304-022-5}}, ''The Subtleties of the Inimitable Mulla Nasrudin'', {{ISBN|0-86304-021-7}}, ''[[The Pleasantries of the Incredible Mulla Nasrudin]]'', {{ISBN|0-86304-023-3}} and ''The World of Nasrudin'', {{ISBN|0-86304-086-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; These stories are known throughout the [[Muslim world]]. Superficially, most of the stories may be told as jokes. They are told and retold endlessly in the teahouses and caravanserais of Asia and can be heard in homes and on the radio. But it is inherent in a Nasrudin story that it may be understood at many levels. There is the joke, but there is also the structure of the tale that functions as an analogy or metaphor for some aspect of human nature or learning.

{{quotation|A friend came to visit Nasrudin at home bringing a duck, and Nasrudin had it cooked to share with him. The next week someone called by, claiming to be the cousin of the man who had brought the duck. Nasrudin fed him. The week after that someone came claiming to be the friend of the cousin of the man who had brought the duck. Nasrudin fed him too. This continued, with the connection to the friend with the duck becoming more and more remote each time. Finally, when the next friend-of-cousin-of-friend-of-man-with-duck arrived, Nasrudin heated water up in a pot and then served it to the new guest. 
&lt;br /&gt;
"What's this?" said the man, tasting the hot water.
&lt;br /&gt;
"This," said Nasrudin, "is the soup of the soup of the soup of the duck."}}

==Worldwide dispersal and diffusion==
It is impossible to say how far back in time teaching stories go. Shah's collection ''[[World Tales]]'' includes the [[Tale of Two Brothers]], an [[ancient Egypt]]ian story from around the 12th century BC. [[Jataka tales]] from India as far back as the 3rd century BC have travelled westwards via the [[Panchatantra]] and have long been recognised as having a teaching function. An example is [[The Tiger, the Brahmin and the Jackal]] which made its first appearance In Europe some 900 years ago in [[Petrus Alphonsi]]'s collection of tales, the ''Disciplina Clericalis'' (which, according to E.L. Ranelagh,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Ranelagh
  | first = E.L.
  | title = The Past we Share
  | publisher = Quartet Books Ltd
  | year = 1979
  | location = London, Melbourne, New York
  | page = 165
  | isbn = 0-7043-2234-X}} A cleric here could mean an educated layman as well as an ecclesiastic.&lt;/ref&gt; could be translated as "a course of study for the reader").

The [[blind men and an elephant]] is a well-known tale that has been used among [[Jainism|Jainists]], [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] and [[Hinduism|Hindus]] in India, as well as by [[Persian people|Persian]] Sufi writers [[Sanai]] of [[Ghazni]], [[Attar of Nishapur]] and [[Rumi]]. Shah's ''[[Tales of the Dervishes]]'', a collection of narratives gathered from classical [[Sufi]] texts and oral sources spanning a period from the 7th to the 20th centuries, gives Sanai's version.

Parallels with other religious traditions are obvious, wherever narratives are used instructionally rather than to generate or perpetuate belief or conformity. Examples might be [[Zen]] [[koan]]s,  Hasidic tales, and the [[parables]] of [[Jesus]]. Sometimes, as in The Tiger, the Brahmin and the Jackal or The Blind men and an elephant, versions of the same story are put to use.

*The [[Pancatantra]]
*Narratives from Sufi writers, to name a few: [[Sanai]], [[Attar of Nishapur|Attar]], [[Rumi]], [[Saadi (poet)|Saadi]], [[Amir Khusrow]]
*Stories from the ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'' such as [[The Franklin's Tale]], [[The Pardoner's Tale]] and [[The Merchant's Tale]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2756">"'''The Flail From Heaven'''" (German: ''Der Dreschflegel vom Himmel'') is a [[Grimm's Fairy Tales|Brothers Grimm fairy tale]] collected by the [[Brothers Grimm]]. Since the second edition published in 1819, it has been recorded as Tale no. 112.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://myweb.dal.ca/barkerb/fairies/grimm/112.html |title=Grimm / Tale112 |publisher=Myweb.dal.ca |date=2003-05-30 |accessdate=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is [[Aarne–Thompson]] type  AT 1889K, ''A Rope Made of Chaff''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grimmstories.com/en/grimm_fairy-tales/classification |title=Grimm - Classification (Aarne-Thompson) |publisher=Grimmstories.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The tale begins with a peasant tilling his fields with a pair of oxen. Inexplicably, while in the field, the oxen's horns grew to an extraordinary size; an effect that prevented the peasant from returning home with them. Fortunately, the peasant was able to sell the oxen to a nearby butcher. The butcher, having no currency on him, bartered a measure of turnip-seed with the peasant, offering should the peasant return to him with the measure of [[rapeseed]] he would exchange a [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] [[thaler]] for each seed. The peasant returned home with the seed, however, he lost one seed out of the bag on the way. The next day, the butcher paid him per agreement minus the one missing seed. On his way back from the butcher, the peasant passed where he dropped the seed and saw it had sprouted into a tree which reached up to the heavens. The peasant climbed the tree and, reaching the top, spied angels [[threshing]] oats. While he was viewing the angels, the tree began to shake; someone below was cutting down the tree. To save himself from being falling from the tree, the peasant wove a length of rope from the oat [[chaff]] that lay in piles. Before descending he stole a [[Hoe (tool)|hoe]] and a [[flail]] which were lying in the heavenly fields. He descended the rope only to find himself at the bottom of deep pit. Using the hoe, he carved a flight of steps and walked up and out of the pit. The peasant kept the flail as proof of his adventure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanliterature.com/author/brothers-grimm/fairy-tale/the-flail-from-heaven |title=The Flail From Heaven - The Brothers Grimm |publisher=Americanliterature.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Lacemaker''''' is a painting by the [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch artist]]  [[Johannes Vermeer]] (1632–1675), completed around 1669–1670 and held in the [[Louvre]], Paris. The work shows a young woman dressed in a yellow shawl, holding up a pair of bobbins in her left hand as she carefully places a pin in the pillow on which she is making her bobbin lace. At 24.5&amp;nbsp;cm x 21&amp;nbsp;cm (9.6 in x 8.3 in), the work is the smallest of Vermeer's paintings,&lt;ref name="B66"&gt;Bonafoux, 66&lt;/ref&gt; but in many ways one of his most abstract and unusual.&lt;ref name="H0538"&gt;Huerta (2005), 38&lt;/ref&gt; The [[canvas]] used was cut from the same bolt as that used for ''[[A Young Woman Seated at the Virginals]]'', and both paintings seem to have had identical dimensions originally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Canvas matches in Vermeer: a case study in the computer analysis of canvas supports  |url=http://people.ece.cornell.edu/johnson/LiedtkeMMJ.pdf|first1=Walter|last1=Liedtke|authorlink1=Walter Liedtke|first2=C.

The girl is set against a blank wall, probably because the artist sought to eliminate any external distractions from the central image. As with his ''[[The Astronomer (painting)|The Astronomer]]'' (1668) and ''[[The Geographer]]'' (1669), that the artist likely undertook careful study before he executed the work; the art of lacemaking is portrayed closely and accurately.&lt;ref name="W114"&gt;Wheelock, 114&lt;/ref&gt; Vermeer probably used a ''[[camera obscura]]'' while composing the work: many optical effects typical of photography can be seen, in particular the blurring of the foreground.&lt;ref name="B66" /&gt; By rendering areas of the canvas as out-of-focus, Vermeer is able to suggest [[depth of field]] in a manner unusual of Dutch [[Baroque painting]] of the era.&lt;ref&gt;Huerta (2003), 46&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Lacemaker'', the artist presents in an abstract manner the various elements which compose the girl's face and body and the pattern of the material on which she is working. The girl's hands, the curls of her hair and the T-cross which form her eyes and nose are all described in an abstract manner unusual for the era in which Vermeer worked. In addition, the red and white of the lace is shown as spilling from the sewing cushion with physical properties suggesting a near liquid form.&lt;ref name="H0538" /&gt; The blurring of these threads contrasts sharply with the precision of the lace she is shown working on.&lt;ref name="B66" /&gt;

[[File:"The Lace-Maker" by Caspar Netscher.jpg|left|thumb|''[[The Lace Maker]]'' (1662) by [[Caspar Netscher]]. Although this work shares with Vermeer a sense of quiet solitude, it hints at sexual overtones unvisited by the later artist&lt;ref name="B66" /&gt;]]

Vermeer's painting is often compared to a 1662 canvas of the same name (but two words) by the Dutch portrait and genre painter [[Caspar Netscher]]. However, Vermeer's work is very different in tone. In the earlier work, both the girl's shoes and the mussel shells near her feet have sexual connotations.&lt;ref name="B66" /&gt; In addition, the discarded shoes in Netscher's painting are unlikely to be the girl's own, hinting again at a sexual overtone.&lt;ref&gt;Nash, John. ''Vermeer''. Scala, 1991. {{ISBN|1-870248-63-5}}. See extract: "[http://www.essentialvermeer.com/cat_about/lacemkr.html]".&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the art historian [[Lawrence Gowing]],
:"The achievement of Vermeer's maturity is complete. It is not open to extension: no universal style is discovered. We have never the sense of abundance that the characteristic jewels of his century gives us, the sense that the precious vein lies open, ready to be worked. There is only one 'Lacemaker': we cannot imagine another. It is a complete and single definition."&lt;ref&gt;Gowing, 55&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Three Musicians''''' is an [[oil painting]] by [[Diego Velázquez]] (1599-1660),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsbestpaintings.net/artistsandpaintings/artist/59/|title=Diego Velázquez|publisher=www.worldsbestpaintings.net|accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsbestpaintings.net/artistsandpaintings/artist/59/|title=Velázquez|publisher=www.worldsbestpaintings.net|accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Spanish Baroque painter considered one of the great Spanish [[Realism (visual art)|naturalists]]. It depicts three young men grouped around a dinner table playing music. It is painted in [[chiaroscuro]], a Baroque painting technique that made use of the contrast between light and dark shadows to achieve a sense of volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://art-painting-gallery.com/BigPic.asp?id=717|title=The Three Musicians|publisher=art-painting-gallery.|accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Google&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/u/0/asset-viewer/the-three-musicians/VgG9uyYlMjQ8DQ?hl=en|title=The Three Musicians |publisher=Google Art Institute|accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting==
''The Three Musicians'' is one of Velázquez's earliest works, from his early [[Seville]] period. It is one of approximately ten paintings in the [[bodegón]] style that Velázquez created before 1622, while living in Seville. Its subject is similar to that of another painting, ''[[The Farmers' Lunch]]''. In this painting three young men are grouped around a table eating, drinking and playing music, with strong contrasts of light and darkness around the figures. The light falls from the left, creating sharp shadows and intense highlights. Two men with stringed instruments are singing while the third, the youngest, has an instrument of his own under his arm and a glass of wine in his hand; he displays the glass with a mocking smile, pointing out the wine that inspires the musicians. In the background can be seen a monkey with a pear in hand. The monkey emphasizes the grotesque nature of the scene.

A loaf of bread on a napkin, a glass of wine, and a piece of cheese with a knife stuck into it give Velázquez the opportunity to study the different textures. An interesting feature of ''The Three Musicians'' is the variety of issues raised, such as whether it is a [[genre painting|genre representation]] or whether behind the supposedly everyday scene there are hidden layers of meaning, which can make the picture readable as an allegory, giving it a different interpretation.&lt;ref name=Google /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://art-painting-gallery.com/BigPic.asp?id=717|title=The Three Musicians|publisher=art-painting-gallery.|accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''View of Paris from Vincent's Room in the Rue Lepic''''' ({{lang-nl|Gezicht op de daken van Parijs}}) is a painting by [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Post-Impressionism|post-impressionist]] artist [[Vincent van Gogh]].

==1887 paintings==
In 1887 van Gogh lived with his brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]] in an apartment in [[Montmartre]], which is located on Montmartre hill above the city of [[Paris]]. This afforded him a beautiful view of the Paris skyline, which he painted several times.&lt;ref name=VGM231&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=1757&amp;collection=621&amp;lang=en |title=Roofs in Paris, 1886 |year=2005–2011 |work=Permanent Collection |publisher=Van Gogh Museum |accessdate=2011-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two of the paintings were made in 1887.  The second painting ''View from Vincent's Window''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghgallery.com/catalog/Painting/704/View-of-Paris-from-Vincent's-Room-in-the-Rue-Lepic.html |title=View of Paris from Vincent's Room in the Rue Lepic (F341a)|year=2011 |work=Van Gogh Paintings |publisher=Van Gogh Gallery |accessdate=2011-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; was made from a similar vantage point of ''View of Paris from Vincent's Room in the Rue Lepic''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghgallery.com/catalog/Painting/703/View-of-Paris-from-Vincent's-Room-in-the-Rue-Lepic.html |title=View of Paris from Vincent's Room in the Rue Lepic (F341)|year=2011 |work=Van Gogh Paintings |publisher=Van Gogh Gallery |accessdate=2011-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==1886 painting==
An earlier painting was made of the view from his window titled ''Roofs of Paris'' or ''View of Roofs and Backs of Houses''.  Van Gogh had become aware of Impressionism soon after arriving in Paris, but it took a while before he assimilated the knowledge into his work.  This early view of his window reflects the dark colors he had been accustomed to using, subdued browns and grays for the roofs and the backs of the houses. In it Van Gogh appears to focus primarily in the color graduations of the houses and rooflines.&lt;ref name=VGM231/&gt;

'''Visual arts in Israel''' refers to [[Plastic arts|plastic art]] created in the [[Land of Israel]]/[[Palestine region]], from the later part of the 19th century until today, or art created by [[List of Israeli artists|Israeli artists]]. Visual art in [[Israel]] encompasses a wide spectrum of techniques, styles and themes reflecting a dialogue with [[Jewish art]] throughout the ages and attempts to formulate a national identity.&lt;ref name="forward.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/articles/3689/a-century-of-israeli-art-on-view-in-berlin/|title=A Century of Israeli Art, on View in Berlin|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Bonfils, Félix (1831-1885) - 613 - Joueurs de violon bedouins.jpg|thumb|[[Félix Bonfils]]&lt;br /&gt;''Beduin violin players'', 1880s]]
[[File:19th century embroidery.jpg|thumb|Temple mount map and buildings, late 19th century&lt;br /&gt;embroidery&lt;br /&gt;private collection.]]

Early art in the Land of Israel was mainly [[decorative art]] of a religious nature (primarily [[Jewish]] or [[Christian]]), produced for religious [[pilgrims]], but also for export and local consumption. These objects included decorated tablets, embossed soaps, rubber stamps, etc., most of which were decorated with [[Motif (textile arts)|motifs]] from [[graphic arts]].&lt;ref&gt;Yona Fischer, ''Art and Artisan in the Land of Israel in the 19th Century'' (1979, Israel Museum) (in Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; In the Jewish settlements artists worked at [[gold smithing]], silver smithing, and embroidery, producing their works in small crafts workshops. A portion of these works were intended to be amulets. One of the best known of these artists, [[Moshe Ben Yitzhak Mizrachi]] of Jerusalem made Shiviti (or Shivisi, in the Ashkenazic pronunciation, meditative plaques used in some Jewish communities for contemplation over God's name) on glass and amulets on parchments, with motifs such as the Sacrifice of Isaac, the [[Book of Esther]], and views of the [[Temple Mount]] and the [[Western Wall]].&lt;ref&gt;Haviva Peled, "Seven Artists", in Fischer (1979).&lt;/ref&gt; Objects of applied art were produced also at the "[[Torah ve-Melakhah]]" ("Torah and Work") school founded in 1882 by the [[Alliance Israélite Universelle]].&lt;ref&gt;Gideon Ofrat, "First Starts: Torah and Work", in [http://www.openu.ac.il/zmanim/zmanim103/download/zmanim103-ofrat.pdf ''Zmanim''], 103, Summer 2008 (in Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; This school opened departments for the production of art objects in [[Neoclassicism|Neo-Classical]] and [[Baroque]] styles, produced by combining manual labor with modern machines.

A large body of artistic work was produced by European artists, primarily Christian painters, who came to document the sites and landscapes of the "[[Holy Land]]". The motive behind these works was [[Oriental studies|orientalist]] and religious and focused on documentation – first of the [[painting]] and later of the [[photography]] – of the holy sites and the way of life in the [[Orient]], and on the presentation of exotic people.&lt;ref&gt;Yehoshua Ben Arie, ''Artists and art of the Land of Israel in the 19th Century'' (1992, Yad Yitzhak Ben-Zvi)&lt;/ref&gt; Photographs of the Holy Land, which also served as the basis for paintings, focused on documenting structures and people in full daylight, due to the limitations of photography at that time.&lt;ref&gt;P.A. Parry, ''Jerusalem 1861: Impressions'' (1978, Ariel)&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore an ethnographic approach is in evidence in the photographs, which present a static and stereotypical image of the figures they depict. In the photographs of the [[France|French]] photographer [[Felix Bonfils]] such as, for example in his prominent photographs of the Holy Land in the last decades of the 19th century, we even see an artificial desert background, in front of which his figures are posed At the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, local photographers began to appear, the most important of whom is [[Khalil Raad]], who focused on an ethnographic description of the reality of the Holy Land, in large part colonialistic. In addition there were other photographers, many of them Armenian, who worked as commercial photographers in the Land of Israel and neighboring countries.

In the 1920s, many Jewish painters fleeing pogroms in Europe settled in Tel Aviv.&lt;ref name="forward.com"/&gt;

==Art of "The Land of Israel", 1906–1932==

===Bezalel===
[[File:Ehad haam school3.jpg|thumb|"Hebron", homemade glazed tiles made at the ceramics workshop at Bezalel.]]

Until the beginning of the 20th century no tradition of fine arts existed in the Land of Israel although European artists came as visitors and painted the "Holy Land". Artists and craftsmen of Judaica objects and other applied arts made up the majority of artists working in the Land of Israel. Although the “Bezalel School of Arts and Crafts,” known as "[[Bezalel]]", was not the first art school established in the Jewish settlement, its importance in setting the boundaries of the tradition of [[modern art]] in the Land of Israel was very great indeed, and it is customary to view its establishment as the beginning of Israeli art. The school was founded in 1906 by [[Boris Schatz]] with the support of heads of Jewish and [[Zionist]] institutions. At Bezalel emphasis was placed on objects of [[applied art]] with a metaphysical dimension.

At the art school the influence of European [[Art Nouveau]] was in evidence, in addition to other social movements such as the British "[[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]]" movement. In the logo of the quarterly magazine "''Yalkut Bezalel''", designed by [[Ze'ev Raban]], we see within the ornate frame [[cherub]]s with a painter and a sculptor on each side and a lamp maker and a rug weaver next to them. Under the illustration is the caption "Work is the fruit; art is the bud; art without a soul is like prayer without conviction".&lt;ref&gt;Yael Granot, "Bezalel and the Ben Shemen Jewelers' Community" in Nurit Canaan-Kedar, ''Art and Artisans, Roots and Boundaries'' (2003, Tel Aviv Faculty of the Arts)&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside the art school, within its different tracks, studios opened for the production of [[jewelry]], tapestries, paintings and Jewish ceremonial objects that were sold in Jerusalem shops.  Schatz's vision included the idea of cross pollination between the various parts of the institution. "There is a practical side to the study of art", Schatz wrote, "The school always needs new drawings for the rugs and silver artifacts. Thus we need a series of artists who have absorbed the prevailing spirit of the school within their art, having studied with the expert teacher who embodies this spirit".&lt;ref&gt;Granot in Canaan-Kedar (2003), p.129&lt;/ref&gt;

In the art created in Bezalel during this period Jewish and religious motifs dominate, for example, descriptions of the holy places, scenes from the Diaspora, etc. The works are decorative and heavily engraved in the "Eastern" style. The descriptions sought a connection between the Biblical period, the Return to Zion [from the Babylonian exile] and the Hasmonean Kingdom of Israel [140-37 BC], and the Zionist aspirations for the development of a Jewish settlement, driven by ideological and Zionist sentiments. The artists did this by borrowing historical motifs they perceived as "Jewish" motifs and designs they perceived as "Eastern". Typography occupied a central place in their designs. Sometimes the text even became the main element in their compositions.&lt;ref&gt;Chaya Benjamin, ''Bezalel of Jerusalem: From the Allen B. Slipka Collection of the Israel Museum'' (2008, Israel Museum, Jerusalem)&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of Schatz himself consisted mostly of small-scale sculptures of Jewish subjects, as well as reliefs and memorial plaques in honor of various Zionist leaders. His most famous sculpture is Mattathias (1894), which was influenced by [[Renaissance]] sculpture and in particular by the sculpture of [[Donatello]]. A different spirit entirely brought [[Samuel Hirszenberg]] (1865–1908), to the institution to join the Bezalel teaching staff. Hirszenberg brought European academic painting to Bezalel, and painted Jewish subjects within this framework. The artist Ze'ev Raban created many graphic works in the spirit of Art Nouveau, also known as "[[Jugendstil]]" ["Youth Style" in [[German language|German]]]. The subjects of these works were "Orientalist" landscapes of the Holy Land and figures from the Bible drawn in the Neoclassical style. Among other well-known artists who taught at Bezalel were [[Ephraim Moses Lilien]], [[Meir Gur-Arieh]], [[Arnold Lachovsky|Arnold (Aaron) Lachovsky]], [[Erich Goldberg|Erich (Arie) Goldberg]], [[Adolph (Avraham) Berman]], [[Shmuel Levi]] (Ophel), and others.

Due to financial difficulties and political infighting the school closed in 1929. The museum, which housed many works of art, remained in the Bezalel building. This collection eventually served as the basis for the Art Wing of the [[Israel Museum]] in Jerusalem.

===Land of Israel modernism movement===
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 224 Tel Hai Lion Sculpture פסל הארי השואג בתל חי.JPG|thumb|[[Avraham Melnikov]]&lt;br /&gt;The Roaring Lion, 1928–1934&lt;br /&gt;[[Tel Hai]]]]

At the beginning of the 20th century some of the Bezalel students began to rebel against the rigid artistic tradition that was followed in the institution and turned to more "subjective" art. this Period often called The "[[Tower of David Period]]". One of the most prominent of these artists was the sculptor [[Avraham Melnikov]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/of-stone-and-schizophrenia-1.360707 Of stone and schizophrenia], ''[[Haaretz]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Melnikov suggested a different formal approach, culled from within the art of the Ancient East. This approach was offered as a replacement for the European art forms that dominated Bezalel during the reign of Schatz and Lilien.

The monument "The Roaring Lion" which Melnikov erected at [[Tel Hai]], designed in the "Assyrian-Mesopotamian" style, reflected Melnikov's aesthetic ideal. "For many generations", Melnikov asserted, "the Jews were cut off from the figurative tradition in art; there are many ways to express artistic taste, but the taste that was in fashion was European art based on Greek and Roman culture, and as long as Athens was the inspiration for art in Europe, the Jew was instinctively excluded from it".&lt;ref&gt;''Haaretz'', 18 December 1925&lt;/ref&gt;

Other young artists offered alternative artistic approaches, turning to modern art, of which Schatz and Melnikov strongly disapproved. This showed up also in the exhibitions they organized. In 1920, for example, the "Hebrew Artists Association" was formed; it organized the annual exhibition, and during the years 1923 to 1928 held an "Exhibition of Land of Israel Artists" in the [[Tower of David]] in Jerusalem's Old City, organized by [[Joseph Zaritsky]], [[Shmuel Levi|Shmuel (Ophel) Levy]], Melnikov, and others. In these exhibitions art in the "Bezalel Art" style were exhibited next to art influenced by the European Post-Impressionist and Expressionist styles. Other exhibitions of Modern Art were held in the hut attached to the [[Ohel theater]] in Tel Aviv between 1926 and 1929.

Another organization of Israel artists was called "Egged" (The Amalgamation) and included artists such as [[Arieh (Leo) Lubin]], [[Pinchas Litvinovsky]], [[Sionah Tagger]], [[Chana Orloff]], Yossef Zaritsky, [[Haim Gliksberg]], [[Reuven Rubin]], [[Arieh Allweil]], and [[Nachum Gutman]]. Some of its members, like Orloff and Tagger, displayed influences from French [[Cubism]] in their works. The group held an exhibition in 1929 in an apartment on [[Allenby Street]] in Tel Aviv, opposite the [[Mograbi Theater]]. Another exhibition of modern art was held in 1930 in the Tel Aviv Museum and was called "The Beginnings of Modernism in Israeli Painting, 1920-1930".

To a significant extent the modern painters began to create a "Hebrew" version of [[Post-Impressionism|Post-Impressionist]] painting using a palette of light colors, an attraction to expressive brushstrokes, and a tendency toward naïve, flat painting. In addition to traditional subjects such as portraits, many artists depicted the Land of Israel in landscapes that added a romantic perspective to their subjects. This style of these works is sometimes called the "Land of Israel School".

Among the artists identified with this style, the artist Nachum Gutman stands out. Gutman painted many depictions of the city of Tel Aviv, but also of the Land of Israel's Arab citizens, many of whom he met with in Jaffa. His famous painting "Resting at Noon" (1926) depicts Fellahin (Arab farmers) resting in the field from their day's labor. An examination of Gutman's style in these years shows a tendency toward the simplification of forms, in the tradition of expressive painting, and toward the use of strong colors. Some critics feel that this naïve style of painting reveals Gutman's romantic approach towards the landscapes of the Land of Israel and its Arab inhabitants.

This approach is also typical of other artists of this period. Sionah Tagger, for example, created a description of the "Railway Crossing at Herzl Street" (1920) in an expressive style that emphasized the modernity of the new Hebrew city. [[Israel Paldi]] (Feldman) depicted scenes of the half-empty country in a palette of bright shades and colors. Another artist, [[Abel Pann]], expressed this romantic approach by focusing on subjects from the Bible depicted in illustrations that were fantastic in style.

Reuven Rubin also frequently depicted the Jewish existence in the Land of Israel. For example in "Sophie, Bukharin Jewess" (1924) and "Dancers from Miron" (1926) his tendency towards flatness and a decorative style stand out, showing the influence of modern art and even of [[Art Nouveau]]. In "First Fruits" (1923) Rubin presents figures typical of the 1920s, interwoven with a powerful and fantastic element. As in other works of his from this period, in "First Fruits" he shows a worldview that combines Zionism and Orientalism in one basket; thus, he depicts Jews and Arabs, pioneer couples and immigrants from Yemen and Bedouin shepherds in their native dress holding round fruit: a pomegranate, oranges, a watermelon, and bunch of bananas. And next to them local animals: goats and a camel.

In spite of his distance from the center of artistic activity in the Land of Israel, the works of [[Hermann Struck]], who immigrated to Israel in 1922, when he was already a mature artist with a worldwide reputation, also display some of the iconographic characteristics of visual art in the young Land of Israel. Palm trees and empty landscapes are central themes of his work. Along with paintings of the city of Jerusalem and its residents the special Land of Israel light, which so preoccupied its young artists, is translated in his prints into a sharp contrast which emphasizes the dark images on the light background.

===Armenian ceramic art===
[[File:Rockefeller Museum fountain2.jpg|thumb|[[Rockefeller Museum]]]]

In 1919 the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]] government extended an invitation to a group of [[Armenians|Armenian]] artists, survivors of the Armenian genocide, to renovate the tiles of the [[Dome of the Rock]]. This experiment reflected the British interest in traditional art in the spirit of the [[Arts and Crafts Movement|Arts and Crafts]] Movement. Armenian [[ceramic art]] began in the 15th century in the Turkish cities of [[Iznik]] and [[Kutahya]], but the encounter with ancient Land of Israel art and with Christian motifs gave rise to a unique artistic synthesis.

The central artist during these first years was [[David Ohannessian]] (1884–1953), who specialized in decorative ceramics for structures and monuments, many of them at the invitation of the British government. Among the principal works Ohannessian created in Jerusalem were: tiles for the [[American Colony Hotel]] (1923), the fountain base for [[St. John's Ophthalmic Hospital]], the domed entry of the [[Rockefeller Museum]], etc. Among the motifs appearing in his decorations are cypress trees, tulips, and grapevines, all of which are typical of traditional [[Ottoman art]].&lt;ref&gt;Nurit Canaan-Kedar, ''Armenian Ceramics in Jerusalem'' (Yad Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, Jerusalem, 2002), pp.29-52&lt;/ref&gt; As he transplanted his art to Jerusalem and continued to develop it, he added images inspired by the local traditions and Armenian illuminated manuscripts—frequently using the Bird Mosaic in objects and tile panels.

The artists [[Megherdich Karakashian]] and [[Neshan Balian]], who in 1922 left Ohannessian's studio and founded a joint workshop, developed an independent style in which figurative images foreign to traditional Turkish art appeared. For example the two of them used imagery from ancient mosaics found in the Land of Israel, such as the Bird Mosaic from a 6th-century Armenian chapel or the mosaic from [[Khirbat al Mafjar]]. Often these images were imbued with a Christian theological interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Kenaan-Kedar (2002), pp.53–91.&lt;/ref&gt; Their joint workshop remained active until 1964, when [[Stepan Karakashian]] and [[Marie Balian]], the heirs of the founding artists, set up two independent workshops that both used designs that had been developed in the past and created some new ones of their own.

The return of Jewish artists from Europe in the 1930s to Mandatory Palestine gave rise to a variety of influences from modern art on art in the Land of Israel. At the same time it should be noted that these influences did not motivate the artists toward [[Avant garde]] and abstract art in their painting and sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;For a distinction between avant garde in an artistic and in a political sense, see Peter Berger, '''Theory of the Avant Garde''' (Rasling, Tel Aviv).&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the strongest influences were French art and German art. Gideon Efrat claimed that these influences created two different trends in the plastic arts. While the "Parisian" influence was expressed in a "dynamic softness that melts heavy structures", German art and the "[[New Objectivity]]" (Neue Sachlichkeit) which brought with it a static and sculptured monumentality.&lt;ref&gt;Gideon Efrat, "Anorexia Artistica" in ''Washington Crosses the Jordan'' (Sifria Zionit, Jerusalem, 2008), p.67.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most typical influence of the European avant garde is evident in international architectural styles in the Land of Israel, brought by architects who were graduates of the "[[Bauhaus]]". The considerable influence of [[French realism]] can also be found in the works of a group of artists who were influenced by the trend towards realism of French sculptors of the beginning of the 20th century, such as [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Aristide Maillol]], and others. This symbolic message in content and form appears also in the works of artists of the Land of Israel group, such as [[Moses Sternschuss]], [[Rafael Chamizer]], [[Moshe Ziffer]], [[Joseph Constant]] (Constantinovsky), and [[Dov Feigin]], most of whom studied at some point in France.

One sculptor who was influenced by Cubism was [[Zeev Ben Zvi]] who, in 1928, after completing his studies at Bezalel, went to study in France. Upon his return he served for a short period as a teacher of sculptor at Bezalel, and at the "New Bezalel". In 1932 Ben Zvi had his first exhibit at the national antiquities museum, "Bezalel", and a year later he had an exhibit at the [[Tel Aviv Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Haim Gimzu, ''Ben-Zvi the Sculptor'' (Hazvi, Tel Aviv, 1955).&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of making use of [[Cubism]] as a means of subverting the artistic object, Ben Zvi's sculptures use Cubism as a means of intensifying the feeling of monumentality of the image. In the work of artists such as [[Chana Orloff]] and [[Shalom Sebba]] as well, the Cubist language in which they shaped their works did not lead them to abandon the realism and the boundaries of traditional representation. In his well-known work, "The Fleece" (1947), for example, Sebba used the Cubist language to intensify the monumentality of his images, while using angles of observation inspired by photography.

Even more striking avant garde trends began to appear in the work of the Jewish photographers, most of whom were influenced by the German avant garde and the expressionists of the 1920s and 1930s. Photography in the land of Israel developed under the encouragement and guidance of the Zionist establishment, under the auspices of groups such as the Jewish National Fund, which commissioned photographs that would spread the Zionist message. Artists such as {{ill|Zoltan Kluger|he|זולטן קלוגר}}, [[Yaakov Rosner|Yaakov (Jack) Rosner]], and others, documented the Zionist enterprise and the Jewish settlement, sometimes using photographic angles, compositions, and views which took their inspiration from Soviet Communism in Russia. Other photographers sought to use these techniques for artistic or commercial photography.

[[Helmar Lerski]] created photographic portraits in typical expressionist style, expressed in his use of light and in the angle of the photograph. In 1936 Larski created 175 photographs of man, which attempted to encompass his personality in its entirety, using a technique called "metamorphosis by means of light"; this technique made use of mirrors, and he even taught it in workshops on the roof of his home in Tel Aviv.
Another artist, [[Alfons Himmelreich]], created advertising photographs which emphasized industrial commercialism by using a distortion of the usual standards, close ups, and light for emphasis, as a designer of commercialism. Among the photographers who worked in a more artistic tradition were Richard Levy (Ereel), who created photomontages of semi-abstract figures; [[Tim (Nahum) Gidal]], and the sisters [[Charlotte Meyer|Charlotte]] and [[Gerda Meyer]], who specialized in architectural photography.&lt;ref&gt;Rona Sela (editor), ''Photography in the Land of Israel in the 1930s and 1940s'' (Kibbutz Hameuchad, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

The intensification of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute influenced the works of Arab photographers with a developed political consciousness, such as [[Ali Zaarur]], [[Chalil Rissas]], and others. They acted on their own or as agents of various information agencies, and created photographs in journalistic style. Only from the 1990s did researchers begin to investigate these works as part of historiography, and as the visual representation of the past, with political, ideological, and nationalistic goals in mind.&lt;ref&gt;Sela (2000), pp. 40-67.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canaanite movement===

In 1943 the poet [[Yonatan Ratosh]] (1908–1981) published "Epistle to Hebrew Youth", the proclamation, the manifesto, the first written communication of "[[Canaanism|The Caananites]]", a literary and artistic movement that had been active for some time. In this essay Ratosh called on [[Hebrew]] speaking youth to become a buffer against [[Judaism]]. He declared that between the youth that had settled in the Land of Israel and the Jews of the Diaspora there was no true connection. This became the characteristic cry of the Caananites, whose members proposed a return to the mythological past, in order to create a Hebrew–speaking nation with an independent identity.

The visual expression of this aspiration was the use of archaic forms and styles, under the influence of Fertile Crescent art. This tendency reflected, to a significant degree, the interest in primitive art and sculpture that was prevalent in Europe at the beginning of the 20th century. Often this pro-Archaic style was an expression of symbolism.

One of the most significant artists of the "Canaanite" movement was the sculptor [[Itzhak Danziger]]. He returned to the Land of Israel in 1938 after studying in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and demonstrated a new national outlook in his work which, in contrast to what was acceptable in Europe, was full of sensuality and Eastern exoticism. This art fit the feelings and sense of identity of much of the population of the Jewish settlement in the Land of Israel. The dream of Danziger's contemporaries, writes [[Amos Keinan]] after Danziger's death, was "to unite with the land of Israel and the earth of which it is composed, to create a specific image with recognizable signs, something that is from here and is us, and to embed in history the mark of that something special that is us".&lt;ref&gt;Amos Kenan, "Greater Israel", ''Yedioth Aharonot'', 19 August 1977 (in Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to nationalism, his sculptures demonstrated an expressionist-symbolist style similar in spirit to British sculpture of the same period.

Danziger opened a sculpture studio in the yard of his father's hospital in Tel Aviv, and there he critiqued and taught young sculptors such as [[Benjamin Tammuz]], [[Kosso Eloul]], [[Yechiel Shemi]], [[Mordechai Gumpel]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Tammuz, ''The Story of Israeli Art'' (Masada Publishing, 1980), p. 134 (in Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to his students, his studio became a popular meeting place for artists from other fields as well. In this studio Danziger created his first significant works, the sculptures "[[Nimrod]]" (1939) and "[[Shabazia]]" (1939). When "Nimrod" was unveiled it became the focus of an important dispute in Land of Israel cultural circles; the sculpture depicts the figure of Nimrod, the Biblical hunter according to Jewish religious literature, as a lean youth, naked and uncircumcised, a sword clutched in his hand and a falcon on his shoulder. The sculpture harked back to the earlier cultures of the Assyrians, the Egyptians, and the Greeks, while at the same time it showed similarities to the European sculpture of the time. The sculpture expressed a combination of homoerotic beauty and pagan idolatry. This combination was at the center of criticism in religious circles in the Jewish settlement. The criticism against "Nimrod" and the Canaanites was heard not only in religious circles, which objected to the pagan and idolatrous aspects of the work, but also in secular circles among those who objected to the rejection of "Jewishness". To a significant extent "Nimrod" intensified a dispute that had existed prior to its appearance. At the same time other voices called it the new model for the "New Jewish Man".  The newspaper Boker [Morning] wrote in 1942 that "Nimrod is not just a sculpture. It is flesh of our flesh, spirit of our spirit. It is a milestone and it is a monument. It is the apotheosis of the vision and daring and youthful rebellion that distinguishes an entire generation…Nimrod will be young forever".&lt;ref&gt;Cited in: Sara Breitling-Semel, "Agrippas vs. Nimrod", Kav, 9, 1999 (in Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of the fact that Danziger later had his reservations about "Nimrod" as a model for Israeli culture, many artists adopted the "Canaanite" style and point of view in their sculpture. Figures resembling idols and images in "primitive" style appeared in Israeli art until the 1970s. Furthermore the influence of the Canaanite movement was evident in the art of the "New Horizons" group.&lt;ref&gt;See: Gideon Efrat, "The Secret Caananite Character of 'New Horizons'", Art Visits (2005) (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Avant Garde: the 1950s and 1960s==
In the 1950s and 1960s Israeli artists began exploring the idiom of the Avant-garde current in Europe and the United States. Immigrant artists brought trends to Israel, and influential Israeli artists spent stints in Europe, especially in France. Some of these artists sought a universal style, while others sought to develop a uniquely Israeli avant-garde, in the spirit of nationalistic socialism and Zionism.&lt;ref&gt;See: Galia Bar-Or, Gideon Efrat, ''The First Decade: Hegemony and Multiciplicity'' (Museum of Art Ein Harod, 2008) (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Horizons===

[[File:Feigin ein harod.JPG|thumb|[[Dov Feigin]]&lt;br /&gt;Growth, 1959&lt;br /&gt;Ein Harod Mueeum of Art]]

The germination of the "New Horizons" ("Ofakim Hadashim") movement can be found in a group of artists who mounted an exhibition in Tel Aviv's Habima national theater in December 1942, under the name "the Group of Eight", But the group crystallized into the dominant artistic movement only after the founding of the state in 1948. Members of the school included [[Arie Aroch]], [[Zvi Meirowitch]], [[Avraham Naton]] (Natanson), [[Avigdor Stematsky]] and [[Yehezkel Streichman]]. The work of sculptor [[Dov Feigin]] also appeared in the catalog of the 1942 exhibition, though it was not displayed. In February 1947 five of the original members of the group joined [[Joseph Zaritsky]] for an exhibit called "The Group of Seven" at the [[Tel Aviv Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;Gila Blass, ''New Horizons'' (Reshefim Publishers, Tel Aviv, 1980), pp. 16-17 (in Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the group stated that "The group is based in modernism, especially French, yet seeks a unique style that expresses our own reality".&lt;ref&gt;''Davar Ha-Shavua'', 12 February 1947.&lt;/ref&gt;

For these artists, this was not only a statement of philosophy, but a practical work plan. Zaritsky, who served as chairman of the League of Painters and Sculptors in the Land of Israel, opposed the league's philosophy of equality among artists. In 1948, at the time of the opening of the artists' house that was to become the League's permanent home, he was delegated to select works for the Bienniale in Venice. His selections caused such an outrage among the members that he was ousted from his position. He walked out with a group of artists, and founded an alternative movement, the "New Horizons". On 9 November 1948, the Tel Aviv Museum of Art opened the first exhibit bearing the movement's name. Among the artists showing were Pinchas Abramovich, [[Marcel Janco]], [[Aharon Kahana]], [[Yohanan Simon]], [[Avshalom Okashi]] and [[Moshe Castel]], as well as movement founders Zaritsky, Streichman and Feigin.

The group sought a style that reflected the striving for Zionism and Modernism. This style was largely dictated by the leading artists of the group – Zaritsky, Stematsky Mairovich and Streichman. In practice, this style was a variant of European modernism. The style has been called "lyrical abstract", but in fact, there was little purely abstract art, but rather works rooted in the local visual landscape. This essentially figurative style was pushed toward the abstract by bold brush strokes, and a strong use of bright colors typical of the "Land of Israel" style, reflecting the strong Mediterranean light. Formats were generally rather small, and the style was similar to European abstract art before the second World War, akin to the art of Wassily Kandinsky, and unlike the abstract art prevalent in the United States at the time.

For example, in his series "Yehiam" (1949–1952), Zaritsky depicts scenes from the establishment of Kibbutz Yehiam in northern Israel. The early paintings in this series (mostly watercolors) depict the natural landscapes of the region, while the later paintings are (mostly oil) abstractions of these earlier scenes. This progression, contends art critic and curator Mordecai Omer, reflects Zaritsky's belief that external visual reality is the basis of artistic originality.&lt;ref&gt;Mordechai Omer, Zaritzky (Tel Aviv Museum, Tel Aviv, 1984), p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zvi Mairovich, a prominent members of Okakim Hadashim he painted in the abstract lyric style but unlike his colleagues Mairovich was more inclined to a German rather than a French pallette. Hs bold use of black and reds particularly in the gouaches. The big breakthrough was in oil pastels, that only he made in large format. Using a deep space photo surface rather than a flat paper was pioneering moment.

Others in the group, however, deviated from this style. Marcel Janco, of international fame for his involvement in the Dada movement in Europe in the 1930s, did not adopt this approach to abstraction; rather his art uses European Cubist and Expressionist styles to create a Jewish-Zionist narrative. Moshe Castel, also, went through a transformation during the 1950s from abstraction to expressionism characteristic of the Canaanist movement.

In the field of sculpture, the group introduced new media. [[Yechiel Shemi]], Dov Feigin, and, after a sojourn in Britain, [[Itzhak Danziger]], introduced welded steel as a new medium. This new form freed these artists from the figurative character of stone and wood carving, for a more purely abstract oeuvre. Here, too, however, there is frequent reference to the Canaanite figurativeness and symbolism.

Indeed, during the 1950s, the "New Horizons" group tended more and more toward the abstract, and away from reliance on the figurative. Zaritsky led this shift, which was rooted in what he saw as a guiding ideology. Some members of the group, however, rejected this ideology, and eventually quit the movement. These included Janco, [[Alexander Bogen]], Aharon Kahana and Yehiel Simon.&lt;ref&gt;See: Gila Blass, ''New Horizons'', pp. 64–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Realism and Social art===
While the abstract and secular works of the New Horizons group had profound influence on the course of art in Israel, they were nonetheless considered at the time to be on the fringes of mainstream art, which was mostly figurative and often bearing explicit Jewish and Zionist messages. This explicitly nationalist trend in Israeli art was denounced by its opponents as "regionalism".&lt;ref&gt;Yona Fischer, Tamar Manor-Friedman, ''The Birth of Now: The 1960s in Israeli Art'' (Ashdod Museum of Art, 2008), p. 10 (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; New Horizon critics, who maintained that art was international and universal, were opposed by the ideology of the Bezalel School at the time. [[Mordechai Ardon]], head of Bezalel, wrote in 1954, "Every artist, like every citizen, must serve his country in heart and in soul".&lt;ref&gt;Cited in: Galia Bar-Or, Gideon Efrat, ''The First Decade: Hegemony and Multiciplicity'' (Museum of Art Ein Harod, 2008), p. 21 (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; Artists like [[Simon Zabar]], [[Moshe Gat]], and [[Ruth Schloss]] created works that reflected national social tensions, a clearly socialist political slant, and glorification of the worker. Others, like Naftali Bezem and Miron Sima, [[Moshe Bromberg]] (Bar-Am) depicted the dramatic events of the period – World War II and the Holocaust. Their works were explicitly Jewish, while adopting the styles of the European avant-garde of the early 20th century.

The quest for a connection between the artist and society is reflected also in the monumental works on the walls of public buildings that were commissioned beginning in the 1950s. Examples include the mosaics of Mordechai Gumpel on the walls of public buildings in Petach Tikva, Holon and elsewhere, that depict Jewish settlers building the nation, in a style drawing much on the Canaanists; or Yohanan Simon's mural of kibbutz youth at Kibbutz [[Gan Shmuel]], showing youth living the socialist dream.&lt;ref&gt;See: Galia Bar-Or, Gideon Efrat, ''The First Decade: Hegemony and Multiciplicity'' (Museum of Art Ein Harod, 2008), pp. 22-23 (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

New Horizons artists, too, despite their avowed adherence to a philosophy of universality, often expressed in their works sentiments of nationalism, Zionism, and socialism. For example, Zaritsky, one of the leading ideologues of the universalist school, produced series of paintings focusing on Israeli kibbutzim – his series "Yehiam", and a similar series on Naan (a kibbutz in central Israel), 1950–1952. Both these series include abstractions of the Israeli landscape. Zvi Mairovich one of the founders of New Horizons produced a series of large oil paintings called Mizpe Ramon focousing on the Israeli deseret. Sculptor Dov Feigin produced "Wheat Sheaves" in 1956, and Dadaist Janco painted "Soldiers", "Air raid Alarms" and "Maabarot" (jerry-built communities housing new Jewish immigrants in the 1950s). Some of the New Horizons artists belonged to the "Center for Advanced Culture" run by the Socialist-Zionist youth movement "[[Hashomer Hatzair]]".&lt;ref&gt;See: Gila Blass, New Horizons, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; This activity culminated in the founding of the artists' village [[Ein Hod]] by a group of artists headed by Marcel Janco. There, Janco hoped to found a new socialist and artistic utopia.

Mordechai Ardon's work stands out from that of other New Horizons artists for dealing with the mystical and historical, rather than concentrating on the present. His canvases often depict episodes from Jewish history, from Biblical scenes to the Holocaust. For example, his painting "Gate of Light" (1953), shows the tree of life, a symbol of great Biblical and Kabbalistic meaning, within a surrealistic landscape reminiscent of the work of Paul Klee and others.

Ever since, surrealism has played a significant role in Israeli art, and some of its most gifted and influential proponents include artists like [[Zeev Kun]], [[Samuel Bak]], [[Baruch Elron]], Joel Tal-Mor, as well as [[Yosl Bergner]].

===Abstract art after New Horizons===
During the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, the work of the [[New Horizons group]] influenced new artistic trends in Israel. Some artists, like [[Yechiel Shemi]] and [[Aviva Uri]], continued the work of the group after it dissolved, mostly working in a non-objective abstract mode.

New Horizons' last exhibit was in 1963. A number of young artists joined the exhibit, including [[Raffi Lavie]], [[Moshe Kupferman]] and [[Igael Tumarkin]]. In 1964, a new group of about 30 artists formed, called "Tazpit" ("Outlook"), This group carried the torch of abstract art into the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;See: Gila Blass, New Horizons, pp. 95-96.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Zvi Mairovich Panda 1971.jpg|thumb|Zvi Mairovich Panda, oil pastel/paper 39 x 39&amp;nbsp;cm 1971]]
One of the artists on the fringe of the "New Horizons" group who developed a new style was [[Arie Aroch]]. In contrast to the ideal of the rest of the group, Aroch's works showed, in addition to lyric abstraction, a tendency toward substantive content. For example, "Red House (How Are Things at Home?)" (1960),&lt;ref&gt;For an iconographic analysis of this painting, see: Gideon Efrat, "The Aftermath of Arie Aroch's 'Red House'", Studio: Journal of Art, 62, May 1995, p. 35 (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; "Sarajevo Manuscript" (1966), and others hinted at content of Jewish historical significance along with the influence of the [[Pop Art]] of the time. In his works "The High Commissioner" (1966) and "Agripas Street" (1964), for instance, the many interpretations these works received included widespread perception of them as historical paintings in which Judaism and Jewish tradition are given a place of prominence.&lt;ref&gt;Cf, Sarit Shapiro, Paths of Wandering: Migrations, Journeys, and Transitions in Contemporary Israeli Art (The Israel Museum, 1991), p. 62; David Gintan, "The High Commissioner", Ha-Midrashah, 3, 2000, pp. 200-249 (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; These paintings in particular, and Aroch's work in general, are generally viewed as the antithesis of the "Caananite" approach seen, for example, in Itzhak Danziger's early works.&lt;ref&gt;See: Sara Breitling-Semel, "Agrippas vs. Nimrod", Kav, 9, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aviva Uri]] created expressive abstract drawings with motifs and images that called to mind birds, circus images, and landscapes. Another artist, Lea Nikel, painted highly colored abstracts in the style of French art of that period. [[Avigdor Arikha]] also painted in Israel during those years according to the principles outlined by the "New Horizons" group. Arikha painted large works in dark colors until he emigrated to Europe, where he began to produce small figurative paintings.
Abstract art merged with conceptual art in Israel in the 1960s and 1970s.

[[Moshe Kupferman]], who had studied painting with [[Chaim Atar]] (Aptaker), Zaritsky,  [[Alexander Bogen]] and others developed an identifiable style characterized by reduced use of color, and by a process of erasing and wiping the drawing over and over until it formed an expressive grid. For many years Kupferman refused to identify his works with any external themes, in spite of critics' attempts to label his paintings a reaction to the Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;Exceptions to this are the works "With beers, beers, and more beers" (1982), influenced by the Sabra and Shatilla Massacre, drawings in memory of Emil Greenzweig (1983), and the group of late works "Fraction and Time", exhibited at Kibbutz Lohamei HaGeta'ot.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, his works have been described as a phenomenological process: as layers constructed in a dialectical process which accrues "life experience as the layers accumulate".&lt;ref&gt;See: Sara Breitling-Semel, "Painting in a Time of Bankruptcy" (1983), In: Yona Fischer, ''Moshe Kupferman: Paintings, Works on Paper, 1963–1984'' (The Israel Museum, Jerusalem, 1984), p.11 (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Local Art Between Wars, 1967–1982==
[[File:He Walked through the Fields.jpg|thumb|[[Yigal Tumarkin]]&lt;br /&gt;''He Walked through the Fields'', 1967]]

Until the 1970s, mainstream Israeii art dealt with a broad artistic and personal spectrum but, for the most part, ignored political issues. Even artists who portrayed cultural or Jewish content in their works were considered anachronistic by the artistic establishment of the time.&lt;ref&gt;See: Yona Fischer, Tamar Manor-Friedman, The Birth of Now: The 1960s in Israeli Art (Ashdod Museum of Art, Ashdod, 2008), p. 76 (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s American artistic influences began to reach Israel, especially abstract expressionism, pop art, and later, even the art pauvre of conceptual art. In addition to bringing new artistic forms, these influences also introduced a direct engagement with political and social issues. Events of [[The Six-Day War]] and [[The Yom Kippur War]] intensified these influences and led to a variety of politically charged artistic expressions which became the trademark of an entire generation of younger artists. Under the influence of American conceptual art, there even developed among Israeli artists a tendency to emphasize the dimension of artistic creativity, that is, the "ars poetica" discourse, and how it is perceived by the viewer of art within society. In this spirit, artistic activity in Israel was often seen to be part of the country's social-political reality.

===Art of Protest===
Among the first artists who began to express these artistic influences in their works was the sculptor and painter [[Igael Tumarkin]], whose art expressed engagement with burning political issues. At the encouragement of [[Yona Fischer]] and [[Sam Dubiner]], Tumarkin returned to Israel in 1961 from East Berlin, where he had been the set manager of the Berliner Ensemble theater company, under the direction of [[Berthold Brecht]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf, Yigal Tumarkin, "Danziger in the Eyes of Yigal Tumarkin", in Studio, 76, October–November 1996, pp. 21-23 (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; His early works, such as "Panic Over Trousers" (1961) were created as expressive assemblages. His sculpture "Take Me Under Your Wings"(1964–65) (the first line in the well-known poem by [[Hayyim Nahman Bialik]]), for example, Tumarkin created a sort of steel casing with rifle barrels sticking out of it. The sculpture's mixture of nationalism, lyricism, and even eroticism became Tumarkin's hallmark in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;See Ellen Ginton, "The Eyes of the State: Visual Art in a State Without Borders" (Tel Aviv Museum, Tel Aviv, 1988), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; This technique can be seen also in his famous sculpture "He Walked in the Fields" (1967) (the same name as [[Moshe Shamir]]'s famous story), which protested against the image of the "mythological Sabra"; Tumarkin strips off his "skin" and exposes his torn innards from which weapons and ammunition protrude and his stomach, which contains a round bomb that looks suspiciously like a uterus. During the 1970s Tumarkin's art evolved to include new materials influenced by "[[Earth Art]]", such as dirt, tree branches, and pieces of cloth. In this way Tumarkin sought to sharpen the focus of his political protest against what he saw as the one-sided approach of Israeli society toward the Arab-Israeli conflict.

After the Six-Day War Israeli art started to gravitate away from describing war and its symbolic content.&lt;ref&gt;See: Yona Fischer, Tamar Manor-Friedman, ''The Birth of Now: The 1960s in Israeli Art'' (Ashdod Museum of Art, Ashdod, 2008), p. 78 (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; Tumarkin's sculpture still dealt with it, but began to express it in a variety of more abstract ways.

==="Want of Matter"===
[[File:Raffi Lavie~B83 0006.jpg|thumb|[[Raffi Lavie]]&lt;br /&gt;Untitled, 1969&lt;br /&gt;[[Israel Museum]], Jerusalem]]
[[File:Michal Na'aman, Anal, Banal, Canal, (etc.), 1976, photographs and Letraset on plywood, 52.5X40.5 cm.jpg|thumb|[[Michal Na'aman]]&lt;br /&gt;Anal, Banal, Canal, 1978&lt;br /&gt;[[Tel Aviv Museum of Art]]]]

In the mid-1960s a group called "[[10+]]" appeared on the scene. This group, led by the artist [[Raffi Lavie]], sought an alternative to the "lyric abstraction" of the New Horizons group. The most important innovations of this school were importing [[pop art]] and avant garde art into Israel, developing an unpolished style, and combining photography, Readymade, and collage. Among the many artists in the group were [[Buky Schwartz]], [[Ziona Shimshi]], [[Pinchas Eshet]], [[Tuvia Beeri]], [[Uri Lifschit]]z, and others. Since it ostensibly lacked a clear ideology, the group focused on organizing a series of exhibits in galleries that tried to emphasize the idea of the blurring of distinctions between different kinds of media in contemporary art. In addition, the group was a pioneering force in the introduction of [[video art]] into Israel. Although "10+" officially disbanded in 1970, the members of the group carried on its spirit and its style, taking their final form from a group that revolved around the art school "The College" (ha-Midrashah). The esthetic principle of this group came to be called "The Want of Matter".

The theoretical underpinning of this group was established by the curator [[Sara Breitberg-Semel]], in the exhibit "The Want of Matter: A Quality in Israeli Art", which took place in March 1986 in the Tel Aviv Museum. The roots of this style could be found, according to her, in the wide acceptance of European and American art in Israel, especially Pop Art, Art pauvre, and Conceptual Art. These influences were expressed by the use of industrial materials, such as plywood, industrial paint, collages and assemblages, etc. Another element, which in Breitberg-Semel's opinion was no less central, was the "non-aesthetic" approach, the roots of which could allegedly be found in the Jewish tradition of talmudic studies, which places text, and not form, at the center of culture.

According to Breitberg-Semel, "The Want of Matter" began with the painting of the "[[New Horizons]]" group. The members of this group developed a style that came to be called the "lyrical abstract", within the framework of which the painters created an abstracted form of reality with expressionistic overtones. The works of their followers, [[Aviva Uri]] and [[Arie Aroch]], used a national aesthetic model called "The Want of Matter", utilizing materials in their art that were compatible with their ascetic outlook and combining abstraction with an implied iconography.

Visually, "[[Want of Matter]]" style distilled its characteristics from these diverse influences, preferring painting to three-dimensional sculpture. Overall, this style can be summed up as focusing on the use of low-cost materials identified with the establishment of Israel, such as plywood, cardboard, collages photographs arranged as collages, industrial paints, and writing and scribbling within the work. The use of these materials gave an intentionally humble appearance to the surface of the paintings, a look which was meant to add a dimension of criticism by the artists toward Israeli society.

In an article accompanying "The Want of Matter" exhibition, Breitberg-Semel focuses on Raffi Lavie as a typical representative of this style. Lavie's work "typifies the Tel Aviv spirit", which is European-Zionist modernism mixed with neglect and abandonment. Over the years the image of Raffi Lavie himself, dressed in sloppy short pants and rubber flip-flops, intentionally "native" and "Sabra" in his appearance, was displayed as the expression of this problematic aesthetic approach.&lt;ref&gt;Michal Heiman's photographs documented Lavie in his wanderings around town and presented him in typical situations. The artist Doron Rabina described the national image of the artist: "The end of a summer day. Rafi goes into the cafeteria, sweat is trickling down his temples, and his shirt is so wet it's stuck to his body. I couldn't help thinking, 'There goes a master'"; See: Doron Rabina, "The Drawing Itself". Ha-Midrasha, 1, 1999, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; Lavie's paintings, which include "childish" scribble, collages of magazine pictures, posters advertising Tel Aviv cultural events, stickers with the words "head" or "geranium" printed on them, and most recognizably, sawed-off sheets of plywood painted chalky white,&lt;ref&gt;This format became fixed predominantly from the end of the 1980s.&lt;/ref&gt; came to epitomize "The Want of Matter" style.

In addition to crystallizing a clear visual language, Lavie was careful to keep the discussion of his work on a formalist level. In interviews he consistently avoided all interpretation of his work outside the sphere of its "artistic language" in modernist form. In spite of clear iconographic imagery in his work, Lavie insisted that these images were of no historical importance. Furthermore, according to Lavie and Breitberg-Semel, the use of collages and other materials that lacked the "halo" of artistic approval, were meant to undercut and undermine the significance of the visual images.&lt;ref&gt;See: Sarit Shapiro, This Isn't a Cactus, It's a Geranium (The Israel Museum, Jerusalem, 2003), pp. 18-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Lavie's students continued the formalist approach in their art, consistently relating to the modernist tradition, but in their works visual images began to appear which made it difficult to maintain Lavie's didactic separation of form and "content".&lt;ref&gt;Michal Neeman, "Kindly Don't Read What's Written Here", 2, 1999, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yair Garbuz]]'s connection with Lavie dates from the time he was a very young man. For a number of years Lavie was Garbuz's private teacher. [44] Later Garbuz went from being a pupil to being a senior teacher in "The College". Garbuz's work from these years combines characteristics of the Zionist ethos, as reflected in popular culture, with political and social criticism. His two-dimensional works from the 1970s include a mix of newspaper photos, documentary photographs, texts and other objects, combined in compositions that have no clear hierarchy. Some of his works, such as "The Evenings (Arabs) Pass By Quietly" (1979) and "The Arab Village in Israel Very Much Resembles the Life of our Forefathers in Ancient Times" (1981), criticized stereotypes rampant in Israeli society. In his installation " If not a Giant Then at Least in His Garden" (1981), Garbuz created an environment saturated with photographic images, some of which are enlarged and turned into sculptures in space. Between the images are photographs of new immigrant transit camps and development towns, of a father reading the newspaper Davar to his daughter, etc. In the background a recording of a toy whistle can be heard creating the noise of a "toy forest".&lt;ref&gt;See: Yair Garbuz, In All Probability, the Train Will Pass Through Here Soon (Am Oved Publishing, Tel Aviv, 2000), p. 275. (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michal Na'aman]]'s works of the 1970s used photography to create collages. In these works Na'aman created images which emphasized the inadequacy of descriptive language and vision, and in this way, showed the possibility for different and imaginative interpretations of visual representations. The practical implications of a debate or of an axiomatic phrase demonstrated for her the failure of descriptive language.&lt;ref&gt;Sara Breitling-Semel, "Michal Neeman: What Did She Do Here?", Studio, 40, January 1993, p. 48. (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; Against the background of the visual dimension of "The Want of Matter" Style, texts written in commercial style&lt;ref&gt;Kits of stick-on letters for various graphic uses.&lt;/ref&gt; or in handwriting appeared, reflecting the semiotic collapse of image presentation. Examples of this approach can be found in "The Loyal Fish and the Bird" (1977) or "The Message According to the Bird" (1977), in which Na'aman merges fish and bird images into hybrid monsters. In other works, such as her series "The Blue Retouching" (1975) we see a protest against society's accepted moral and esthetic principles.

In spite of clear feminist connections, in [[Yehudit Levin]]'s works, we see a more personal and less intellectual approach than in the works of other students of Raffi Lavie. Many of Levin's works are made of plywood and were constructed at the end of the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s. In these works Levin created compositions of sawed and painted plywood, often accompanied by photographs leaning up against the wall. The names of these works, such as "Bicycle" (1977) or "The Princess in the Palace" (1978), suggest a domestic connection. Even though these works are three-dimensional, their main interest lies in the complex connection between the drawing and the visible area of the work. The work "bursts out " of its frame and spreads out into space.

===Post-conceptual art in the 1970s===
[[File:Tel aviv campos 012.JPG|thumb|[[Benni Efrat]]&lt;br /&gt;''Energy'', 1969&lt;br /&gt;[[Tel Aviv University]], Tel Aviv-Yaffo]]

Conceptual Post-Minimalist Installation artists [[Avital Geva]], [[Joshua Neustein]], [[Micha Ullman]], [[Buky Schwartz]], [[Benni Efrat]], [[Zvi Goldstein]], [[Yochevet Weinfeld]], [[Adina Baron]], [[Nahum Tevet]], [[Or Ner]], [[Michael Gitlin]], [[Pinhas Cohen Gan]] discarded the conventions of taste, the heroics of authenticity, and provincial narrative. By sheer force and power of evading ‘taste’ while yet remaining in the context of art, art could be redefined, its field expanded and the artist liberated to achieve unique existence and value. (see Clement Greenberg)

The axioms of that 1970s group were indifference to Zionist aesthetics; a general distaste for regionalism, national myths, and individual heroics. Avital Geva’s Exchange of Cultures brought Arab Villagers and Kibbutzniks to exchange books with one another. To define a purpose for art, he moved his activity into the Greenhouse to grow vegetables and fish ponds with resistant students, to make art an educational tool.

Ullman’s Berlin Library created a standard for memorial sculpture. His negative space sculptures were often made by digging under ground. Buky Schwartz made perspective correction and earliest video art in the country. Neustein (in collaboration with Marx and Batlle) made the first environmental work. The Jerusalem River Project 1971 was a sound river at the edge of the Judean desert. Boots at Bet Omanim Jerusalem was an agglomeration –five truck loads- of army boots left by various armies in the region, piled into random heaps.

[[File:NeusteinAshCityBneBrak.jpg|thumb|Joshua Neustein, ''Ash City Bne Brak'', Herzeliyah Museum, 2000]]
Joshua Neustein's five Ash Cities were geographic ambivalences realized in five museums in the USA, Germany, Poland and Israel. The Ash cities were on-the-floor relief maps made with tons of ashes and a chandelier.

Efrat's ''Ararat Express'' 1986 is a procession of horses passed through the streets. Each horse carried a television set on its saddle. A documentary film projected on the television screens showed throngs of people displaced by disaster, famine or war, wandering.

Efrat, Neustein and Gitlin also produced methodical, basic, severe graphics that re-defined the materials, tools and viewer's roles. Efrat's double silks and shadow pieces dealt with the concrete aspect of pictorial surfaces. Neustein's torn paper works, Erased Drawings, Magnetic Fields, Steel Wool, Carbon Copy Drawings adhered to unity and even uniformity of making objects or images. He transformed drawing into a three-dimensional practice Yigal Zalmona, Josef Maschek, Robert Pincus Witten and other international critics called that type of art "epistemic abstraction". Gitlin hacked plywood boards with the strategy devised by Neustein of removal and replacement. Gitlin's sculptures, however, were more architecturally oriented. Nahum Tevet's work summarized by James Trainor: The basic building blocks that comprise Tevet's formal vocabulary of sculptural units, for both his small wall works and the large, sprawling, encyclopedically heroic sculptural installations, are simple, verging on the Platonically archetypal—the table, the chair, the box, the boat hull, the rectilinear plane, the book-like block, the framework armature, etc. As Sarit Shapira wrote: In any possible context, they identify as mutants of a territory, or as agents of de-territorialization. The quasi-modeled arrangement of these works presents what is not a model of a given production mechanism of objects, or what will always distinguish itself from such a model; at most, this is a model-proposal for a mechanism of objects that does not yet exist. For this purpose, Tevet replicates his items in limited series (the number of items replicated in each work is also limited, as is the number of times that Tevet replicates entire works or major parts of them), thus distancing them from any automatic and motoric—that is, obedient and “blind”—reproductive mechanism.

These dozen artists were not an organized movement, there was no manifesto but rather there were strong opinions and an ideology, a timely kinship that found a common desire for a collective agenda. Sometimes they were referred to as Post Minimal, or Conceptual, to elaborate Israeli visual culture and escape hegemony by a single group. Their hallmark public exposures were in five shows: Concept + Information 1971 (Musag + Informazia), Beyond Drawing 1974, The Kibbutz Ashdod exhibition Mikum Kivun 1978, the 1970s Tel Aviv Museum 2008 "Art and Language", 2006 Tel Aviv Museum "Eyes of the Nation" by Ellen Ginton 2008.

[[File:Levitation.JPG|thumb|[[Buky Schwartz]]&lt;br /&gt;Levitation, 1976]]
The perception of "The Want of Matter" as the "center" of Israeli art that grew up in the wake of Breitberg-Semel's influence, pushed many artists to the side of that center. [[Gideon Ofrat]], who in those years was not only an art critic and independent curator, but also a partner in various artistic initiatives, set up in opposition to the "Tel Aviv School", "The New Jerusalem School", a term whose origin lay in a Christian metaphysical interpretation of the city of Jerusalem. The central difference between the definition of this group and the "Tel Aviv School", according to [[Ariella Azoulay]]'s interpretation, lay in the difference in the way they defined the status of art in relation to public space. While the Tel Aviv School tended to create its art within traditional definitions, the "Jerusalem" artists sought to establish an eruv (a ritual enclosure) between art and life.&lt;ref&gt;Ariela Azoulay, Training for Art: A Criticism of Museum Economics (HaKibbutz HaMeuhad, Tel Aviv, 1999), pp. 163-164. (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; A different interpretation, formulated by [[Itamar Levy]], saw in these two approaches two dialectical concepts which opposed "conceptuality" to "picturesqueness", universal abstraction to specific locality.&lt;ref&gt;See: Itamar Levy, "Memories of the Seventies", Studio, 40, January 1993, pp. 12-15. (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

Another trait of this artistic school is the influence of conceptual art and innovative media such as the installation and the performance or display. It is worth noting that at this time the boundaries between all these types of media were blurred, and the use of terms like "activity" and "concept", instead of terms like "installation" and "display", which were coined only in 1976, referred more to the intentions of the artist than to the final artistic result. Photography as well, which from the 1970s also began to be a means of expression for artists, was seen as a tool for combining images in conceptual art, and as a means for documenting installations and displays.&lt;ref&gt;See: Rona, Sela (Curator), 90 70 90 (Tel Aviv Museum, Tel Aviv, 1994). (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, and in distinction from American art of the time, only a small amount of the art created in Israel represented conceptual art that was entirely minimilistic or "concrete, " that is, art the entire reason for being of which was to negate the definition of art as representation or imitation.&lt;ref&gt;See Adi Engelman (Curator), The Michael Adler Collection and Israeli Post-Minimalism in the 1970s and in Contemporary Art (Herzliya Museum of Contemporary Art, Herzliya, 2008). (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; Among the artists whose work in part did represent this approach were [[Benni Efrat]], [[Buky Schwartz]], [[Michael Gitlin]], and others.

Ellen Ginton, in her article "The Eyes of the Nation: Visual Art in a Country Without Boundaries " (1998) presented the art of the 1970s as a response to the political and social problems of Israel during that period. Artistic formalism is perceived not only as a framework for social and political content, but in addition, according to Itamar Levy's formulation, every element in an artistic work is perceived both as a design activity and an ideological concept.&lt;ref&gt;See: Itamar Levy, "Memories of the Seventies", Studio, 40, January 1993, p. 13. (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; Ginton claimed that these political expressions, which increased in intensity after the political and social crisis that followed the Young Kippur War, continued until the 1980s, at which time most artists abandoned these subversive artistic practices and returned to more traditional artistic activity.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Ginton, "The Eyes of the State: Visual Art in a State Without Borders" (Tel Aviv Museum, Tel Aviv, 1988). (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Place", "Concept" and "Action"===

One of the first projects carried out in Israel under the banner of [[Conceptual Art]] was implemented by the sculptor [[Joshua Neustein]]. In 1970, Neustein was collaborated with [[Georgette Batlle]] and [[Gerard Marx]] to create "The Jerusalem River Project". In this installation, in East Jerusalem in the dry wadi in the [[Abu Tor]] neighborhood between the St. Clair Monastery and Nachal Kidron (the Kidron Brook), taped water sounds were projected out of speakers. The imaginary river not only created an artistic environment outside the boundaries of the museum, but also hinted ironically at the concept of messianic redemption that appeared after the Six-Day War in the spirit of the [[Book of Ezekiel]] (Chapter 47) and the [[Book of Zechariah]] (Chapter 14).&lt;ref&gt;See: Ellen Ginton, ''The Eyes of the State: Visual Art in a State Without Borders'' (Tel Aviv Museum, Tel Aviv, 1988), 26–32. (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

This work also can be viewed as an indication of the growing number of artists who could be found out in the middle of the Israeli landscape, under the influence of the American trend toward "[[Land Art]]". Many of these works expressed a dialectical and ambiguous relationship with the Iandscapes of the "Land of Israel" and the "Orient", which in turn expressed increasing political criticism. In many works that included metaphysical and ritual aspects, the development and influence of Caananite sculpture and the abstraction of the "New Horizons" school can be clearly seen.

In the art of [[Yitzhak Danziger]], whose work had been dealing with local landscapes for years, the conceptual aspect of the Israeli variation of "Land Art" was expressed. Danziger felt that there was a need for reconciliation and improvement in the damaged relationship between man and his environment. This belief led him to plan projects which combined the rehabilitation of sites with ecology and culture. The "repair" of the landscape as an artistic event was developed by Danziger in his project "The Rehabilitation of the Nesher Quarry", on the northern slopes of the Carmel Mountains. This project was created as a collaboration between Danziger, Zeev Naveh the ecologist, and Joseph Morin the soil researcher, which attempted to create, using various technological and ecological means, a new environment among the fragments of stone left in the quarry. "Nature should not be returned to its natural state", Danziger contended. "A system needs to be found to re-use the nature which has been created as material for an entirely new concept".&lt;ref&gt;In: The Rehabilitation of Nesher Quarry (Israel Museum, Jerusalem, 1972). (In Hebrew). Yona Fischer, In: Yitzhak Danziger, ''Place'' (HaKibbutz HaMeuhad, Tel Aviv, 1982). (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; After the first stage of the project, the attempt at rehabilitation was put on display in 1972 in an exhibit at the Israel Museum.

Another example of this kind of experiment was created in 1977 at a ceremony in which 350 [[oak]] saplings were planted in the [[Golan Heights]] to create a space immortalizing the fallen soldiers of the [[Egoz Combat Unit]]. Danziger suggested that the emphasis of this monument be placed on the view itself and on the creation of a site that differed from the functional quality of a memorial. This concept was implemented by using the ideas behind Bedouin and Palestinian ritual sites throughout the Land of Israel, sites in which trees are used alongside the graves of revered leaders as a ritual focus and, in Danziger's words, "bright swatches of cloth in blue and green are hung from the branches […] Driven by a spiritual need, people come to hang these pieces of fabric on the branches and to make a wish"&lt;ref&gt;Amnon Barzel, "Landscape As a Work of Art" (an interview with Yitzhak Danziger), ''Haaretz'', 22, 7, 1977. (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972 a  group of young artists who were in touch with Danziger and influenced by his ideas created a group of activities that became known as "Metzer-Messer" in the area between Kibbutz Metzer and the Arab village Meiser in the north west section of the Shomron. [[Micha Ullman]], with the help of youth from both the kibbutz and the village, dug a hole in each of the communities and implemented an exchange of symbolic red soil between them. Moshe Gershuni called a meeting of the kibbutz members and handed out the soil of Kibbutz Metzer to them there, and [[Avital Geva]] created in the area between the two communities an improvised library of books recycled from Amnir Recycling Industries.&lt;ref&gt;See: Ellen Ginton, ''The Eyes of the State: Visual Art in a State Without Borders'' (Tel Aviv Museum, Tel Aviv, 1988), pp. 88–89. (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; Another artist influenced by Danziger's ideas was Igael Tumarkin who, at the end of the 1970s, created a series of works entitled, "Definitions of Olive Trees and Oaks", in which he created temporary sculpture around trees. Like Danziger, Tumarkin also related in these works to the life forms of popular culture, particularly in Arab and Bedouin villages, and created from them a sort of artistic-morphological language, using "impoverished" bricolage methods. Some of the works related not only to coexistence and peace, but also to the larger Israeli political picture. In works such as "Earth Crucifixion" (1981) and "Bedouin Crucifixion" (1982), Tumarkin referred to the ejection of Palestinians and Bedouins from their lands, and created "crucifixion pillars"&lt;ref&gt;See: Yigal Tsalmona, ''Onward: The East in Israeli Art'' (Israel Museum, Jerusalem, 1998), p. 82–83. For documentation on the varied sculptural activities of Tumarkin, see: Yigal Tumarkin, ''Wood, Stone, and Cloth in the Wind'' (Masada Publishers, Tel Aviv, 1981). (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; for these lands.

Another group that operated in a similar spirit, while at the same time emphasizing Jewish metaphysics, was the group known as the "Leviathians", presided over by [[Avraham Ofek]], [[Michail Grobman]], and [[Shmuel Ackerman]]. The group combined conceptual art and "land art" with Jewish symbolism. Of the three of them Avraham Ofek had the deepest interest in sculpture and its relationship to religious symbolism and images. In one series of his works Ofek used mirrors to project Hebrew letters, words with religious or cabbalistic significance, and other images onto soil or man-made structures. In his work "Letters of Light" (1979), for example, the letters were projected onto people and fabrics and the soil of the Judean Desert. In another work Ofek screened the words "America", "Africa", and "Green card" on the walls of the Tel Hai courtyard during a symposium on sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;See: Benjamin Tammuz, ''The Story of Israeli Art'' (Masada Publishers, Tel Aviv, 1980), pp. 238–240. Also: Gideon Efrat, ''Beit Avraham Ofek'' (Museum of Art, Ein Harod, 1986), p. 35. (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identity and the Body===
[[File:Gideon Gechtman hasifa 005.jpg|thumb|[[Gideon Gechtman]]&lt;br /&gt;Exposure (Installation view), 1975]]

The landscape as a space for [[performance]] and expressions of [[gender]], which occupied center stage in American art of this period, never caught on in Israel as it did in the [[United States]]. [[Ilana Tannenbaum]] claimed that, in contrast to artists worldwide, the works of Israeli artists were restrained in their artistic language and tended to be reductionist with regard to forms.&lt;ref&gt;See: Ilana Tannenbaum, "The Israeli Connection: Between the Private Entity and the National Entity", ZERO video written in light, live broadcast, The Projected Image – The First Decade. (Haifa Museum of Art, Haifa, 2006) (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; In the works of many Israeli artists, such as [[Moshe Gershuni]], [[Tamar Getter]], and others, the relationship to the body was assimilated into sociopolitical significance. In her work "Letter to Beuys" (1974), for example, Getter wrote a fictitious letter to the artist Joseph Beuys. The letter included three different biographies and asked Beuys to make her a coat and shoes.

In his work "Via Dolorosa" (1973), [[Motti Mizrachi]], who walked on crutches, created a series of photographs documenting his walking along the route of the [[Via Dolorosa]] on crutches while carrying a large portrait of himself on his back. The works of [[Gideon Gechtman]] during this period dealt with the complex relationship between art and the life of the artist, and with the dialectic between artistic representation and real life.&lt;ref&gt;See: Gideon Efrat, ''"The Heart of Things", Gideon Gechtman, Works, 1971–1986'' (Stavit Publishing House, 1986, unnumbered pages. (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; In the exhibition "Exposure" (1975), Gechtman described the ritual of shaving his body hair in preparation for heart surgery he had undergone, and used photographed documentation like doctors' letters and x-rays which showed the artificial heart valve implanted in his body. In other works, such as "Brushes" (1974–1975), he uses hair from his head and the heads of family members and attaches it to different kinds of brushes, which he exhibits in wooden boxes, as a kind of box of ruins (a reliquary). These boxes were created according to strict minimalistic esthetic standards.

===Political art===
After the Yom Kippur War there was a palpable intensifying of protest in Israeli art against everything that was perceived as Israeli militarism or its relationship with the Palestinians, the dominant medium for which was the performance.

One of the leading artists in this protest movement was [[Pinchas Cohen Gan]], who created a number of works of a political nature during these years. In his work "Touching the Border" (7 January 1974), four iron missiles, with Israeli demographic information written on them, were sent to Israel's border. The missiles were buried at the spot where the Israelis carrying them were arrested. In "Performance in a Political Camp in Jericho", which took place on February 10, 1974 in the northeast section of the city of [[Jericho]] near [[Khirbat al-Mafjar]] (Hisham's Palace), Cohen created a link between his personal experience as an immigrant and the experience of the Palestinian immigrant, by building a tent and a structure that looked like the sail of a boat, which was also made of fabric. At the same time Cohen Gan set up a conversation about "Israel 25 Years Hence", in the year 2000, between two refugees, and accompanied by the declaration, "A refugee is a person who cannot return to his homeland".&lt;ref&gt;See: Ellen Ginton, ''The Eyes of the State: Visual Art in a State Without Borders'' (Tel Aviv Museum, Tel Aviv, 1988), pp. 141-152. (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

The artists [[Gabi Klasmer]] and [[Sharon Keren]] ("Gabi and Sharon") gave a number of performances of a political nature and based on current events in public places in Jerusalem. On April 24, 1973 the two of them drew airplanes, tanks, and soldiers on the streets of Jerusalem, accompanied by the caption, "Who needs a parade?" On the same day the two of them showed up at the Medal of Courage and Medal of Valor ceremony at the Jerusalem Theater swathed in bandages and decked out in military medals.

[[Efrat Natan]] created a number of performances dealing with the dissolution of the connection between the viewer and the work of art, at the same time criticizing Israeli militarism after the Six-Day War. Among her important works was "Head Sculpture", in which Natan consulted a sort of wooden sculpture which she wore as a kind of mask on her head. Natan wore the sculpture the day after the army's annual military parade in 1973, and walked with it to various central places in Tel Aviv. The form of the mask, in the shape of the letter "T", bore a resemblance to a cross or an airplane and restricted her field of vision".&lt;ref&gt;See: Ilana Tannenbaum, "The Israeli Connection: Between the Private Entity and the National Entity", ZERO video written in light, live broadcast, The Projected Image – The First Decade. (Haifa Museum of Art, Haifa, 2006). (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

A blend of political and artistic criticism with poetics can be seen in a number of paintings and installations that Moshe Gershuni created in the 1970s. For Gershuni, who began to be famous during these years as a conceptual sculptor, art and the definition of esthetics was perceived as parallel and inseparable from politics in Israel. Thus, in his work "A Gentle Hand" (1975–1978), Gershuni juxtaposed a newspaper article describing abuse of a Palestinian with a famous love song by [[Zalman Shneur]] (called: "All Her Heart She Gave Him" and the first words of which are "A gentle hand", sung to an Arab melody from the days of the [[Second Aliyah]] (1904–1914). Gershuni sang like a muezzin into a loudspeaker placed on the roof of the Tel Aviv Museum. In another work, "Who Is a Zionist and Who Is Not?" (1979) Gershuni wrote these words on the walls of a gallery with pinkish-red pastels. In these works the minimalist and conceptualist ethics served as a tool for criticizing Zionism and Israeli society.&lt;ref&gt;Irit Segoli, "My Red is Your Precious Blood", Studio, 76, October–November 1996, pp. 38-39. (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NeusteinStillLifeOnTheBorder.jpg|thumb|Joshua Neustein, "Still Life On The Border", Tel-Hai, Israel, 1983]]

===The 1980s in Israeli Art===
[[File:Nahum Tevet, Jemmáin, 1986, Coll. Kunsthalle, Manheim.jpg|thumb|[[Nahum Tevet]]&lt;br /&gt;Jemmáin, 1986&lt;br /&gt;Kunsthalle, Manheim]]

Most of the artists who worked in the 1970s as conceptualist artists in a variety of media changed their style in the 1980s and returned for the most part to the medium of painting. This, under the influence of European and American art, was characterized during those years by a mixture of styles all grouped under the accepted esthetic of minimalism, including the American "[[Neo-Geo]]" style, the "Pop Art" style of artists such as [[Jeff Koons]], and the fashionable expressive style, also known as "[[Bad Painting]]", of artists such as [[George Baselitz]] and [[Julian Schnabel]], which defined the post modernist spirit in art around the world.

These international trends filtered into Israeli art, which reflected the attempt to undercut the values of contemporary Israeli society. In the art of this decade, especially toward its end, a discourse of identities developed, a discourse that was incompatible with the institutional hegemony; narrative painting returned and regained its status among local artists, intentionally combining the post modernist use of "the high" and "the low" in all aspects of the implementation and themes of works of art.&lt;ref&gt;See Ilana Tannenbaurm, Check-post: The 1980s in Israeli Art (Haifa Museum of Art, Haifa, 2008). (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

The expressive style in painting was adopted in Israel by a great many artists. [[Michal Na'aman]], who created collages and other conceptual art in the 1970s, moved to large scale paintings with psychological and psychoanalytic overtones. [[Moshe Gershuni]] moved from conceptual and minimalistic sculpture to painting full of [[Impasto]] (thickly laid on paint) in which he combined [[Homoeroticism|homoerotic]] symbolism with images of soldiers with Jewish associations, such as verses from the Bible and from other Judeo-Christian sources. Another prominent aspect of art in those years was the use of references to the [[Holocaust]] and to Jewish culture in Europe. Gershuni's painting techniques included applying paint with his hands, without using a brush, transforming the act of painting into a sort of solo performance.

In parallel to the expressionist approach, other artists worked in a more formalist approach. The painter [[Diti Almog]] exhibited large paintings with textile motifs, such as buttons, shirt fabrics, etc. The works are abstract and decorative in style. The gap between the calculated, formalist (formal) approach and the use of everyday themes was a result of the feminist approach that derived from it. In the works of painters such as [[Isaac Golombek]] and [[Nahum Tevet]] this preoccupation with deconstructing the personal narrative by dealing in a formalistic way with the relationship between form and content, is also very much in evidence.

If in the 1970s Israeli art is full of social and political messages, art in the 1980s is more concerned with "protest". This attribute is especially evident in the second half of the 1980s, under the influence of events such as the [[1982 Lebanon War]] and the outbreak of [[First Intifada]]. The painter [[David Reeb]], for example, painted works of a clear political nature, such as "Green Line With Green Eyes" (1987), which showed the borders of Israel without the land that was conquered in the [[Six-Day War]], beyond the green line, combined with portraits of Arabs with their face covered and the coastline of the [[Tel Aviv]] beach. Another painter, [[Tsibi Geva]], created oriental figures, drawn in an expressive-naïve style, combined with captions like "Here is Arara" or "Umm Al-Fahm".

[[Larry Abramson]] presented a critical view of Israeli [[Zionism]] in his series of abstract paintings entitled "Tsoba". from which fragments of the Arab village that sat on the site of Kibbutz Tzuba until the War of Independence peek through. This series was created as a counterpoint to the abstract paintings of the same name by [[Jossef Zaritsky]], in which he "erased", as it were, all remnants of the Arab village.

Artistic photography gained status during this period, emerging from the place it had occupied for many years as a negligible area of art. A large number of artists returned from studying photography in the United States, among them [[Avi Ganor]], [[Oded Yedaya]], [[Yigal Shem Tov]], [[Simcha Shirman]], [[Deganit Berest]], etc. At the Museum of Art [[Ein Harod]] in the mid-1980s, a Biennale of Israeli Photography was held, presenting Israeli photography for the first time in a museum setting on a large scale.

In the press as well photography sometimes acquired a new aspect, as staged photography, in the works of photographers such as [[Micha Kirshner]]. In his portraits, Kirshner used artistic devices such as makeup, lighting, and composition in an attempt to create the desired effect on the way his subjects would be socially perceived. In his portrait of the model Tami Ben-Ami (1982), Kirshner emphasized the artificiality of the public image of the model, and on the gap between this image and the private person.

[[Performance art]] also began to develop. The most important group functioning in this area was named "Shelter 209", after the number of the Tel Aviv bomb shelter in which they performed. Members of this group were Danny Zackheim, Tamar Raban, and Anat Shen. Another group, the "[[Zik Group]]", created images of large-scale cockroaches, which burned up in complex ceremonies that included ritual elements.

===The 1990s and After===
[[File:Adi Ness, Last Supper.jpg|thumb|[[Adi Ness]]&lt;br /&gt;Untitled (The Last Supper), 1999&lt;br /&gt;[[Israel Museum]], Jerusalem]]
[[File:Sigalit Landau the country 5.jpg|thumb|[[Sigalit Landau]]&lt;br /&gt;The Recorder of Days and Fruit, 2002&lt;br /&gt;(from "The Country")]]

The 1990s brought an openness to contemporary trends in international art. Among the elements responsible for this were the monthly journal 'Studio', edited by [[Sara Breitberg-Semel]], which exposed the Israeli public to contemporary international art; the opening of new galleries that displayed Israeli art of the times; the increase in exhibitions featuring collaboration between Israeli artists and foreign artists; and the strengthening of peripheral museums (such as the [[Herzliya Museum]], which changed its policies during these years). This trend was echoed in the official art establishment with the founding of the "[[Art Focus]]" project (1994), which aspired to be a biennale of international art, and in other projects during the 2000s (decade).

As part of the international influence, there was a significant growth in the artistic and commercial importance of various types of media, such as photography, installations, and video performance art. New technologies like online video editing and image file processing in graphic programs, made the use of these media easier for Israeli artists. Another trend of the 1990s was a return to realistic figurative painting, that is, painting created by looking at the object being painted. The painter [[Israel Hershberg]] was the leader of this trend and even opened a painting school in order to train young artists in this kind of painting.

In the works of local sculptors of the 1990s can be seen a tendency towards large and detailed installations. Often they demonstrated a kind of protest against social values by using artistic symbols. Michal Rovner used the medium of video art to create rich and complex textures which were composed of images of people and which produced a primitive-primeval effect. [[Guy Ben-Ner]] created videos whose narratives dismantle the institution of family by using comic, ars poetica effects.

In works such as "Temple Mount" (1995) or "Country" (2002), [[Sigalit Landau]] created environments rich in objects with an expressive appearance that reflected her interest in transitional situations and in social-political criticism. Social criticism can be seen also in the works of [[Ohad Meromi]], who exhibited works that combined "primitive" images with modernist values. In his work "The Clinic" (1999), Meromi presented traditional local architectures and confronted them with primitive or foreign images. In his work "The Boy From South Tel Aviv" (2001), for example, Meromi created a huge statue of a black figure standing in front of what looks like a road block.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imj.org.il/exhibitions/2008/realtime/Meromi_e.htmlOhad|title=Meromi in the online exhibition "Real Time"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even the older generation of sculptors turned to historical narrative of a more personal nature and to reflection on the nature of art. [[Philip Rantzer]], for example, created sculptures and installations that recreated his childhood experience of being a new immigrant and a stranger in Israel. [[Penny Yassour]] created works that invoked the memory of the Holocaust, along with other personal experiences. Nahum Tevet created sculptural constructions that strove to reflect viewer perceptions, memory, the object, and the work of art. [[Gideon Gechtman]] emphasized this connection through a variety of means. In his exhibition "Yotam" (1999), Gechtman displayed a series of works connected to the death of his son, within a framework of works relating to post modernist means of replication and reproduction.

In the field of painting as well we see an attempt to criticize society using the language of art. [[Nurit David]] and [[Meira Shemesh]], for example, created figurative paintings reflecting the failed attempt at family perfection and artistic perfection. The artist [[Tal Matzliach]] created decorative paintings the significance of which was to show the lack of sexual adequacy. [[Tsibi Geva]] continued his work from the 1980s with imagery such as "Keffiyah" and "Biladi", which juxtapose American abstract art with local images.

The tendency toward the preoccupation with central symbols can be seen primarily among the artists who thought of themselves as representatives of a minority group within Israeli society. The artist Assam Abu Shakra, for example, made use of the symbol the "Sabra" which Israelis thought of as a Zionist symbol, as part of a process for establishing an Israeli Arab identity. Another artist, Sharif Waked, created in his series "Jericho First" (2002) a metamorphosis of the image of the hunter in the floor mosaic in Khirbat al Mafjar, north of Jericho, as a means of political criticism.

The photographer [[Adi Nes]] used photographs of Israeli soldiers, posed in various existential situations, combining them with images of homoerotic significance and of death. In the untitled photograph (1999) that has come to be known as "The Last Supper", soldiers sit around a table in a tableau reminiscent of "The Last Supper" of Leonardo da Vinci.
