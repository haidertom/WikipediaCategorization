[[File:Marc, Franz - Pferde in Landschaft.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Franz Marc]]'s ''Pferde in Landschaft'', one of the artworks discovered in the Gurlitt collection (probably 1911, [[gouache]] on coloured paper).]]

In February 2012, the [[Prosecutor|District Prosecutor]] of Augsburg confiscated 121 framed and 1,285 unframed artworks found in an apartment in [[Schwabing]], [[Munich]] in the course of an investigation into possible tax evasion.&lt;ref name=BBC24818541/&gt; The apartment was rented to  Cornelius Gurlitt, the son of celebrated art historian, dealer, and war profiteer, [[Hildebrand Gurlitt]], and grandson of the art historian [[Cornelius Gurlitt (art historian)|Cornelius Gurlitt]].  Some of the paintings were immediately suspected of having been [[Nazi plunder|looted]] by the [[Nazi]]s during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. The collection is largely undamaged and of remarkable quality. It contains [[Old Masters]] as well as [[Impressionist]], [[Cubist]], and [[Expressionist]] paintings by artists including [[Claude Monet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Franz Marc]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Otto Dix]], and [[Max Liebermann]], among many others. Although German authorities seized the entire collection, Gurlitt was not detained. Not until 3 November 2013 did the magazine ''[[Focus (German magazine)|Focus]]'' report the find.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt; News of the discovery was reported worldwide.&lt;ref name="Smale"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/05/arts/design/trove-of-apparently-nazi-looted-art-found-in-munich-apartment.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=0 |title= Report of Nazi-Looted Trove Puts Art World in an Uproar |last=Smale |first=Alison |date=4 November 2013 |website= |publisher=''The New York Times'' |access-date= 18 March 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gurlitt initially refused to cooperate with investigators. He retained several dozen additional suspect paintings, kept not in Munich but in his home in Salzburg, Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26133532 |title=Nazi loot probe: More art found at Gurlitt Austria home, BBC News, 11 February 2014 |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2014-02-11 |accessdate=2014-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 2014, an agreement was reached whereby the collection confiscated in Munich was to be returned to Gurlitt in exchange for his co-operation with a government-led task force charged with returning stolen pieces to the rightful owners.&lt;ref name="DWdr 20140407"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dw.de/p/1BdMb |publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]] |date=7 April 2014 |accessdate=16 April 2014 |last=R |first=D |title=Gurlitt reaches deal with German authorities over vast trove of art}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Gurlitt died on 6 May 2014.&lt;ref name="Cornelius Gurlitt - obituary"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/10811916/Cornelius-Gurlitt-obituary.html |title=Cornelius Gurlitt - obituary |publisher=Telegraph |date=6 May 2014 |accessdate= 28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His will bequeathed all his property to the [[Museum of Fine Arts Bern]], Switzerland, after all legitimate claims of ownership against it had been evaluated.&lt;ref name="BBC 7 May 2014"&gt;{{cite news|title='Nazi art' hoarder Gurlitt makes Swiss museum sole heir|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27306269|accessdate=7 May 2014|newspaper=BBC News|date=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.artnet.com/in-brief/will-germany-keep-gurlitts-trove-from-the-swiss-14647#.U2ujUaPvmMk.facebook |title=Artnet news, Alexander Forbes, '&amp;#39;Will Germany Keep Gurlitt’s Trove from the Swiss?'&amp;#39; |publisher=News.artnet.com |date=2014-05-08 |accessdate=2014-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

In 1930 art collector Hildebrand Gurlitt was removed as director of the museum in [[Zwickau]] because he exhibited contemporary artists. After the Nazis came to power, he was stripped of his new job as director of [[Kunstverein Hamburg]], because his grandmother was a Jew.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lichtblau |first=Eric |url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/n/nazi_policies_toward_jews_and_minorities/ |title='&amp;#39;Nazi Policies Toward Jews and Minorities'&amp;#39;, NY Times, 18 November 2013 |publisher=Topics.nytimes.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He moved the family to [[Dresden]] and built a prosperous business as an art dealer, specializing in modern art.&lt;ref name="Cornelius Gurlitt - obituary"/&gt;

Hildebrand was appointed as a dealer for the [[Führermuseum]] in [[Linz]], Austria.{{Clarify|date=March 2016|reason= vague. Appointed when?  by whom?}}  On instructions from [[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Reich Minister of Propaganda]] [[Joseph Goebbels]], [[Hermann Göring]] personally appointed a Commission for the Exploitation of Degenerate Art.{{Clarify|date=March 2016|reason= vague. Created when?}}  The Commission in turn appointed a series of dealers approved by the official Nazi confiscation service, the [[Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce|ERR]], to handle the marketing of these art assets. Four men who had been dealing in modern art for years were chosen: Karl Buchholz, Ferdinand Möller, Bernhard A. Böhmer and Hildebrand Gurlitt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-fo7jn3WTDsC&amp;printsec=frontcover | title= The Rape of Europa: The Fate of Europe's Treasures in the Third Reich and the Second World War| publisher=Random House LLC | author=Nicholas, Lynn H. |date = 1995 |accessdate=22 December 2009 | page=24 | isbn=9780307739728}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were instructed to sell these artworks abroad for foreign currency.  Hildebrand's extensive network of European and North American art contacts were invaluable in this.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Göring used the funds raised to grow his personal art collection, though the four men did not always report to the Commission all proceeds of their sales.&lt;ref name=BJParis&gt;{{cite web|last=Feliciano |first=Hector |url=http://www.bonjourparis.com/story/the-lost-museum/ |title=The Lost Museum |publisher=Bonjour Paris |accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the works of so-called "degenerate art" that the Commission sold off were many paintings stolen from noted French art dealer [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]].

[[File:Sworn Statement Dr. H. Gurlitt 1945.pdf|thumb|1945 statement by [[Hildebrand Gurlitt]] to Allied authorities, describing his dealings before and during the war and listing art in his possession]]

In May 1940 the Reich Propaganda Ministry sold to Gurlitt 200 paintings, including Chagall's ''The Walk'', Picasso's ''Farming Family'', and Nolde's ''Hamburg Harbour,'' for the small sum of 4,000 Swiss francs.&lt;ref name=Telg10439168/&gt;  Hildebrand similarly acquired 115 additional works of "degenerate art" in 1941.&lt;ref name=Telg10439168/&gt; It is estimated that, at his height, he had a personal trading collection of more than 1500 art objects.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nicholas"/&gt;

Gurlitt used his position to sell art to domestic collectors, most notably to [[Bernhard Sprengel]], whose collection forms the core of the [[Sprengel Museum]] in Hannover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://derstandard.at/1216918696497/Entartete--Kunstgeschaefte | title=Entartete Kunstgeschäfte | work=Der Standard | date=6 August 2008 | accessdate=3 November 2013 | language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Captured with his wife and twenty boxes of art in Aschbach ([[Schlüsselfeld]]) in June 1945, Gurlitt claimed that the art was part of his personal collection, and that most of his collection and all of his records had been destroyed during the [[bombing of Dresden in World War II|bombing of Dresden]] in February 1945.&lt;ref name="Suddeutsche"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/kultur/depot-mit-nazi-raubkunst-in-muenchen-der-verwerter-und-sein-sohn-1.1809631 | title=Depot mit Nazi-Raubkunst in München | work=Süddeutsche.de | date=3 November 2013 | accessdate=3 November 2013 | author=Mazzoni, Ira |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; He painted himself as a victim of Nazi persecution due to his Jewish heritage, and on those grounds he was released.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;
 
[[File:Liebermann, Max - Zwei Reiter am Strand - Gurlitt.jpg|thumb|[[Max Liebermann]]'s ''[[Two Riders on the Beach]]'' in the Gurlitt collection and subject to a claim by the descendants of the original Jewish owner]]

Although suspicious of his story, in December 1950 US investigators returned 206 items to Gurlitt, including [[Max Liebermann]]'s ''[[Two Riders on the Beach]]'', [[Otto Dix]]'s self-portrait, an allegorical painting by [[Marc Chagall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2493980/Nazi-art-loot-German-dealer-quizzed-U-S-military-just-war.html#ixzz2k9BmfvdM|title=How U.S. military quizzed German dealer of £1bn Nazi art loot just after the war|last=Enoch |first=Nick|work=[[Daily Mail]]|date=9 November 2013|accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gurlitt continued trading artworks until his death in 1956.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nicholas"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-fo7jn3WTDsC&amp;printsec=frontcover | title=The Rape of Europa: The Fate of Europe's Treasures in the Third Reich and the Second World War | publisher=Random House LLC | author=Nicholas, Lynn H. | date=22 December 2009 | page=24 | isbn=9780307739728}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cornelius Gurlitt (28 December 1932 – 6 May 2014) was a German [[Private collection|art collector]], son  of [[Hildebrand Gurlitt]]. He grew up in the [[Dammtor]] district of Hamburg with his sister Renate, who was born there in 1935. His great-grandmother was Jewish, which caused his father to be labelled as a "quarter-Jew" under the [[Nuremberg Laws|Nazi race laws]] in the ''Volkszählung vom 17. Mai 1939'', or so-called "German Minority Census" of 1939.&lt;ref&gt;This "German Minority Census" is available in digital form at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum Resource Center in Washington D.C. and at the German Federal Archives in Berlin-Lichterfelde. An unsourced copy of the database was published online by the [http://www.heartwebsite.org/ArchivalResearch.aspx Holocaust Era Assets and Restitution Taskforce] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109175142/http://www.heartwebsite.org/ArchivalResearch.aspx |date=2013-11-09 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery by German customs authorities==

==Initial legal handling of the Gurlitt case==
On 5 November 2013, Reinhard Nemetz, the head of the prosecutors' office in [[Augsburg]], said that 121 framed and 1,258 unframed works had been seized from the apartment of Cornelius Gurlitt in early March 2012,&lt;ref name=BBC24818541/&gt; including unregistered works by Chagall, Dix, Liebermann, and Matisse.&lt;ref name=BBC24818541&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24818541|title=Nazi trove in Munich contains unknown works by masters|publisher=BBC News|date=5 November 2013|accessdate=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The art historian who first examined the collection, [[Meike Hoffmann]], claimed in print in 2010 that "not a single one" of these works was ever acquired by Hildebrand Gurlitt. Dr. Meike Hoffmann wishes to remark that this controversy derives from a misreading of her book on Bernhard A. Böhmer. In her book, the art historical term ‘Bildwerke’ is used. The term refers only to sculptures, which indeed Hildebrand Gurlitt did not take from the ‘Degenerate Art’ Confiscation. Of course, Meike Hoffmann has never questioned the fact that Hildebrandt Gurlitt dealt with other kinds of artworks from the ‘Degenerate Art’ Confiscation.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman's book (in German) ''Ein Händler "entarteter" Kunst: Bernhard A.

Speaking to ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' magazine in November 2013, Cornelius insisted that his father had obtained the works legally and stated that he would not voluntarily return any of them to previous owners.&lt;ref name=BBCSpiegel&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24977814|title=Nazi-looted art: German collector says he owns pictures |date=17 November 2013|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Spiegel interview"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/spiegel-interview-with-cornelius-gurlitt-about-munich-art-find-a-933953.htm | title=Interview with a Phantom: Cornelius Gurlitt Shares the Secrets of His Pictures | work=Der Spiegel | date=17 November 2013 | accessdate=18 November 2013 | author=Gezer, Õzlem}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feeling threatened by the intense media attention, Gurlitt's brother-in-law offered 22 works in his possession to the police for safekeeping.&lt;ref name=Telg10439168&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/10439168/Art-dealer-paid-Nazis-just-4000-Swiss-Francs-for-masterpieces.html|title=Art dealer paid Nazis just 4,000 Swiss Francs for masterpieces|last=Barnett |first=Louise|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=10 November 2013|accessdate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCStuttgart&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24910093|title=German police check new art haul near Stuttgart |date=12 November 2013|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2013, ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' revealed that they had received a letter from Gurlitt telling them that "the name Gurlitt may not appear in your magazine." Gurlitt then told two reporters from the ''[[Paris Match]]'', who confronted him in a Munich supermarket, that "Applause from the wrong side is the worst thing there is." ''Der Spiegel'' found this comment "puzzling."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/cornelius-gurlitt-reporter-spueren-den-kunstsammler-in-muenchen-auf-a-932755.html ''Der Spiegel''], 11 November 2013 (in German).&lt;/ref&gt;

''Portrait of a woman'' by [[Henri Matisse]] was directly traceable to the collection of [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]], a Jewish art dealer from Paris who had represented [[Matisse]] and [[Picasso]] and who had been forced to leave his collection behind when he fled France.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news|last=Oltermann|first=Philip|title=German police recover 1,500 modernist masterpieces 'looted by Nazis'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/03/nazis-looted-modernist-masterpieces-germany-police|accessdate=3 November 2013|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When approached by ''Focus'', Rosenberg's granddaughter, French television presenter [[Anne Sinclair]], who had been fighting for decades for the return of the art dealer's paintings, stated that she knew nothing of the existence of the painting.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2486251/Discovered-Billion-pound-art-collection-seized-Nazis-ordered-destroyed-discovered-rotting-food-dishevelled-Munich-apartment.html#ixzz2jbOnohDE|title=£1billion art collection seized by Nazis found in shabby Munich apartment|author=Hall, Alan|work=[[Daily Mail]]|date=3 November 2013|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recovery efforts for ''Portrait of a woman'' were immediately undertaken on behalf of the Rosenberg heirs by [[Art Recovery Group|Christopher A.

It is believed the work was sold to a collector in Florida in 2002.

One of the last pieces that Cornelius Gurlitt sold was ''The Lion Tamer'' by Max Beckmann. After a settlement, initiated by the Lempertz auction house in Cologne, was reached between Gurlitt and the heirs of [[Alfred Flechtheim]], it was auctioned off for nearly £750,000.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt; Another work was reportedly sold in 1990 through the [[Bern]]-based gallery of [[Eberhard Kornfeld]].&lt;ref name="Suddeutsche"/&gt;

In March 2014, a BBC reporter was granted access to one of the locations where 238 of the seized works were stored. He viewed works such as [[Monet]]'s ''[[Waterloo Bridge (painting)|Waterloo Bridge]]'' (1903) and others by [[Picasso]], [[Cezanne]], [[Liebermann]], [[Renoir]], [[Courbet]], and [[Manet]].&lt;ref name="BBC 20140326"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26746697 |title=Cornelius Gurlitt: One lonely man and his hoard of stolen Nazi art |last=Evans |first=Stephen |publisher=[[BBC News Magazine]] |date=26 March 2014 |accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 April 2014, a month before Gurlitt's death, an agreement was reached whereby the seized artwork was to be returned to Gurlitt in exchange for his co-operation with the government-led task force charged with determining which of the pieces was stolen and returning them to the rightful heirs.&lt;ref name="DWdr 20140407"/&gt;

===Schwabinger (Gurlitt) Art Trove Task Force===
An entity called the Schwabinger Kunstfund or Gurlitt Task Force was created to research the provenance of the paintings in the Gurlitt trove. However, after several years of operations under the direction of Ingeborg Berggreen-Merkel it was widely criticized for having few results and little visibility.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dw.com/en/task-force-investigating-art-trove-inherited-from-nazi-collector-achieved-embarrassing-results/a-18876659&lt;/ref&gt;

Berggreen-Merkel was accused of visiting the severely ill Gurlitt at his hospital bed and persuading him to sign over the ownership of his collection, allegedly as the only way to prevent Gurlitt from getting sued from various interest groups, Jewish or other. In early 2014 Gurlitt designated the Kunstmuseum as his sole heir. A few weeks earlier, Berggreen-Merkel had met with the President of the Museum's Foundation Council, Christoph Schäublin. One year later, her taskforce was dissolved. "We are disappointed," said Ronald Lauder, president of the World Jewish Congress.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.taskforce-kunstfund.de/en/chronology.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tagesspiegel.de/kultur/gurlitt-und-die-folgen-des-schwabinger-kunstfunds-kunstmuseum-bern-tritt-gurlitt-erbe-an/11021442.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/kultur/Laesst-sich-Bern-die-grosse-GurlittAusstellung-wegschnappen-/story/31357598&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death of Gurlitt, and after==
Cornelius Gurlitt died on 6 May 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Nazi art' hoarder Cornelius Gurlitt, 81, dies|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-27298832|work=BBC|accessdate=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his will, written on his deathbed, Gurlitt named the [[Museum of Fine Arts Bern]] in Switzerland as his sole heir.&lt;ref name="BBC 7 May 2014" /&gt;  People close to Gurlitt told an American newspaper that he decided to give the collection to a foreign institution because he felt that Germany had treated him and his father badly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/swiss-museum-close-to-accepting-nazi-era-art-bequest-1416443643 |title= Swiss Museum Close to Accepting Trove of Nazi Art|last1= Lane|first1= Mary M.|date= November 20, 2014|publisher= ''The Wall Street Journal'' |access-date= 13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legacy included the paintings Gurlitt had kept in Salzburg, paintings which German authorities had not confiscated because their remit did not extend to property held in Austria. Gurlitt's decision created further controversy over the appropriateness of the museum accepting this bequest. The will stipulated that the museum would be required to research the provenance of the paintings and make restitution as appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, p. A12.&lt;/ref&gt; The museum decided to accept those works which are not legally the property of previous Nazi-era owners, or their heirs, and has entered into a joint-agreement with German and Swiss authorities about the handling of this bequest.

Gurlitt's family (cousins) also entered the discussion, raising questions about the legality of the will, based on his state of mind at the time. Gurlitt's cousin, Uta Werner, filed a claim of inheritance on the artwork. Werner's lawyer, Wolfgang Seybold, argued that Gurlitt's relatives were the rightful heirs. Seybold supported his argument with the opinion of psychiatrist and lawyer Helmut Hausner, who stated that Gurlitt suffered from [[schizoid personality disorder]], delusions, and dementia when he wrote the will bequeathing his collection to the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Die 'Causa Gurlitt': Leichtgradig Kompliziert|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/kunst/der-fall-gurlitt/die-causa-gurlitt-leichtgradig-kompliziert-13273066.html|work=Franffurter Algemeine|accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that a number of artworks will be returned to Gurlitt's estate, as he would have been considered the rightful owner unless the heirs of previous owners could prove that he obtained them through unlawful means.&lt;ref name="Welt"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.welt.de/kultur/kunst-und-architektur/article121499967/Wie-Picassos-in-einer-vermuellten-Wohnung-landeten.html | title=Wie Picassos in einer vermüllten Wohnung landeten | work=Die Welt | date=3 November 2013 | accessdate=4 November 2013 | author=Dittmar, Peter | language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; German authorities estimate that around 590 pieces need further investigation to determine whether they were confiscated under the Nazi regime, and a further 380 have been definitively identified as confiscated by the Nazis as "degenerate art".&lt;ref name="Schwabing art trove"&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.lostart.de/Content/02_Aktuelles/2013/13-11-15%20PM%20Taskforce_EN.html?nn=9848 | title=Schwabing art trove: Provenance of treasures to be researched alongside criminal proceedings – suspicious works being publicised at lostart.de | publisher=the Bavarian State Ministry of Justice, the Bavarian State Ministry of Education, Science and the Arts, the Federal Ministry of Finance and the Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and the Media | date=11 November 2013 | accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art objects continued to surface after Gurlitt's death. In July 2014, a new discovery was made in his Munich apartment: two sculptures, possibly the work of [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]] and [[Edgar Degas|Degas]].&lt;ref name=sculptures&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-28464629 |title=Possible Rodin and Degas works found at Gurlitt home |publisher=BBC |date=24 July 2014 |accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September, a landscape by Claude Monet was discovered in a suitcase Gurlitt had left in a hospital where he stayed.&lt;ref name=suitcase&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-29085509 |title=Cornelius Gurlitt: Monet found in art hoarder's suitcase |publisher=BBC |date=5 September 2014 |accessdate=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal issues==
German newspapers questioned the prosecutor's right to seize the collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Voss |first=Julia |date=17 November 2013 |title=Münchner Kunstfund: Wo bleibt der Rechtsstaat? |newspaper=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]] |url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/kunstmarkt/muenchner-kunstfund-wo-bleibt-der-rechtsstaat-12668607.html |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/kunst/der-fall-gurlitt/schwabinger-kunstfund-politische-strafjustiz-12678004.html ''Politische Strafjustiz''] (in German) in the ''Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung'', 25 November 2013, by Volker Rieble.&lt;/ref&gt; Property rights in cases of works of art acquired during the Nazi period are highly complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dittmar |first=Peter |date=7 November 2013 |title=Verbrechen lohnt sich |newspaper=Jüdische Allgemeine |url=http://www.juedische-allgemeine.de/article/view/id/17492 |language=de}}. This article refers in particular to works of ''[[degenerate art]]'', whose confiscation had been formalized by a Nazi law. ''Gesetz über Einziehung von Erzeugnissen entarteter Kunst'' (Act on the Confiscation of Works of Degenerate Art) of 31 May 1938&lt;/ref&gt; After the war the Nazi law legalizing possession of stolen works of ''[[degenerate art]]'' was deliberately upheld by the [[Allied Control Council]] in order that the trade in artworks could continue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geschkult.fu-berlin.de/e/khi/forschung/entartete_kunst/dossier/Broschuere_Heuer.pdf?1347697442 Heuer, Carl-Heinz (undated).

Unlike in Austria,&lt;ref&gt;''Kunstrückgabegesetz 1998'' (''Art Return Law 1998'') See the [[:de:Restitution (Österreich)#Kunstrückgabegesetz 1998|German Wikipedia entry]] for details.&lt;/ref&gt; there is no law in effect in Germany requiring the return of Nazi-looted art, as long as the items in question can be proven to have been, at any point in time, legally acquired. As signatories of the [[Wiedergutmachung|1998 Washington Agreement]], Germany agreed that all of its public institutions would check their inventories for Nazi-looted goods and return them if found. However, this is on a strictly voluntary basis and, 15 years later, very few museums and libraries&lt;ref&gt;The [http://raubgut.zlb.de/index.php/About/Index_en Central and Regional Library of Berlin] is the only library in Germany to have full-time staff devoted to the search for Nazi-looted cultural goods.&lt;/ref&gt; have done so. Individuals are under no legal requirement whatsoever to return Nazi-looted art. A failure on the part of the German government to return the rightful possessions of Cornelius Gurlitt might have been a violation of his property rights as guaranteed in the German constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/2013/48/gurlitt-kunstwerke-raubkunst/seite-1 ''Fluch des Schatzes''] (''Curse of the Treasure'') in ''Der Zeit'', 21 November 2013 (in German). ''“German museums are accordingly, albeit rather hesitantly, searching for looted art in their collections, and from time to time works are returned. This is cumbersome, mostly unspectacular and takes far too long, but it is still the right way. But Cornelius Gurlitt is a private person, and therefore the principles of the Washington Agreement do not apply to his artworks. He cannot be forced, and it appears the government wants to seize the works, which is hardly possible in the face of the constitution.”''&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 December 2013, prominent German art historian [[Sibylle Ehringhaus]], who was one of the first experts to view the artworks in the spring of 2012, gave an interview in the newspaper ''[[Augsburger Allgemeine]]'', demanding the immediate return of the complete collection to Gurlitt. However, she had looked at the works very briefly and had not researched their [[provenance]] because, as she stated in the interview, "Cornelius Gurlitt commissioned neither myself nor anyone else" to perform such research. Chief Prosecutor Reinhard Nemetz vehemently denied her appeal, yet apparently failed to cite any concrete legal grounds for the seizure.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/bayern/Interview-Kunstexpertin-fordert-Rueckgabe-aller-Bilder-an-Gurlitt-id27983722.html Interview: Kunstexpertin fordert Rückgabe aller Bilder an Gurlitt], ''Augsburger Allgemeine'', 4 December 2012 (in German) or a [https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4590360/Ehringhaus_Gurlitt.pdf translation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304001010/https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4590360/Ehringhaus_Gurlitt.pdf |date=4 March 2016 }} of the article in English.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/bayern/Augsburger-Staatsanwaltschaft-weist-Vorwuerfe-der-Kunstexpertin-zurueck-id27992202.html Augsburger Staatsanwaltschaft weist Vorwürfe der Kunstexpertin zurück] ''Augsburger Allgemeine'', 5 December 2012 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 November 2014, the German jurist [[Jutta Limbach]], the head of the Limbach Commission on Nazi-looted art, confirmed the opinion of the German ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' newspaper that the Bavarian "State Prosecutor used an incorrect application of the tax liability law to seize" the artworks of Cornelius Gurlitt.&lt;ref&gt;''Süddeutsche Zeitung'', ''Ein Bild lässt sich abhangen, Schuld nicht'' (in German; English: "A picture may be taken down, but not the guilt"), interview by Heribert Prantl and Kia Vahland, 20 November 2014, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the artworks have been returned to the heirs of the legitimate owners, notably a portrait by Matisse restored to the heirs of French art dealer [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]]. Another major painting from the collection, ''[[Two Riders on the Beach]]'' (1901), by [[Max Liebermann]], was returned to the heirs of the German-Jewish industrialist and art collector David Friedmann,&lt;ref&gt;Eddy, Melissa (May&amp;nbsp;15, 2015).

==Swiss museum's acceptance of Gurlitt's estate==
On 24 November 2014, the Museum of Fine Arts in [[Bern]] agreed to accept the Gurlitt estate.

==History==

Two Burial places of the ancient graves in Wahi Pandhi are sited along the both banks of Narri or Nalli hilly torrent are locally called roman’s graves. The both necropolises can be counted of different periods.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The awning of Smail Fakir is sole monument of the desert of [[Kachho]] which is constructed with heavy carved pillars without any material. The Ceiling stones of canopy are expertly engraved with gorgeous Sun like structure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The graves are built with yellowish stone blocks. It seems no any material was used for fitting stone slabs together with. Many memorial names and other inscriptions are inscribed on stones to be belied in Kufi or [[Persian language]] script.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is believed that these belong to the invading period of Alexander the great and some scholars are of the opinion that these ancient graves belong to [[Baloch (surname)]] tribe but question arises that which Baloch tribe had tradition to keep corpse in open or columned graves with carved  stone slabs .Bherumal Maharchan Adwani considers the graves of Zoroastrians. In Sindh, invasion of Persia [[Iran]] can be traced from Daruish-1.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Zoroastrianism|title=Zoroastrianism {{!}} Definition, Beliefs, Founder, &amp; Facts|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-04-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 637 AD, during the battle of Qadisia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?historyid=ab71|title=HISTORY OF ZOROASTRIANISM|website=www.historyworld.net|access-date=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Muslims invaded Persia.

==Plot==
At [[CERN]], Father Silvano and Dr. Vittoria Verna create three canisters of [[antimatter]]. Silvano is murdered, and one of the canisters is stolen. The [[Roman Catholic Church]] mourn the sudden death of [[Pope]] Pius XVI, and prepare for the [[papal conclave]] to elect his successor in [[Vatican City]]. Father Patrick McKenna, the [[Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church|Camerlengo]], takes control of the Vatican. Four of the “preferiti”, the favoured candidates to be Pope, are kidnapped by a man claiming to represent the [[Illuminati]]. He sends the Vatican a warning, claiming he will murder each of the cardinals from 8pm to midnight, where the stolen antimatter will explode and destroy the city, hidden somewhere within.

American [[symbologist]] Professor [[Robert Langdon]] is brought to the Vatican to help. He deduces that the four cardinals will be murdered on the four altars of the “Path of Illumination”, in locations relevant to the [[classical elements]]. McKenna gives Langdon access to the [[Vatican Secret Archives]] to research the altars, against the wishes of Commander Richter, head of the [[Swiss Guard]]. He and Vittoria examine [[Galileo Galilei]]’s [[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems|banned book]], following clues to the [[Chigi Chapel]], accompanied by Ernesto Olivetti and Claudio Vincenzi of the [[Corps of Gendarmerie of Vatican City]]. They find Cardinal Eber dead, branded with the ambigrammatic word “Earth”.

The second, Cardinal Lamassé, is murdered in [[St. Peter’s Square]], his lungs punctured and branded with “Air”. Vittoria suspects the Pope was actually murdered via overdose, she and McKenna confirming this by secretly inspecting his body. Langdon, Olivetti, and Vincenzi eventually identify the [[Santa Maria della Vittoria, Rome|Santa Maria della Vittoria]] as the altar of fire, finding Cardinal Guidera burning to death, branded with “Fire”. The assassin appears, killing Olivetti and Vincenzi, before escaping to drown Cardinal Baggia in the [[Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi]]. Langdon and civilians intervene, rescuing Baggia, who tells Langdon the preferiti were held in [[Castel Sant’Angelo]].

Richter confiscates Dr. Silvano’s journals, Vittoria convinced that he is a conspirator. Langdon, Vittoria, and the police storm Castel Sant’Angelo. Langdon and Vittoria find the assassin’s lair, discovering five brands, the last meant for McKenna. The assassin escapes, claiming his contractors are “men of God”. Guided to a car by his unseen contractor, the assassin dies [[Car bomb|when the vehicle explodes]] upon ignition. Langdon and Vittoria find a secret passageway leading to the Vatican, warning the Swiss Guard of McKenna’s fate. They find Richter hovering over a branded McKenna. He, and Archbishop Simeon, an alleged conspirator, are killed. Langdon retrieves a key from the dying Richter’s hand.

The antimatter container is found in [[Saint Peter's tomb]], but will detonate in five minutes, the cold temperature preventing its battery from being charged in time. McKenna flees the Vatican with the canister, piloting a [[helicopter]] into the sky, then parachutes out seconds before the antimatter detonates. McKenna is hailed as a hero, with calls for him to be elected as Pope. 

Langdon and Vittoria retrieve Silvano’s journals from Richter’s office, finding he kept tabs on the Pope with hidden security cameras. They find footage of Richter confronting McKenna, revealing the Camerlengo is the mastermind behind the attacks. The Pope had invited Silvano to publicly present the antimatter as proof of a divine power, bridging the gap between religion and science. Considering such a claim blasphemy, McKenna orchestrated the Pope’s death, and the Illuminati assassin, then plotted to be elected as Pope. The footage is shown to the papal conclave. McKenna, realising he has been exposed, commits suicide via [[self-immolation]].

The Vatican announces McKenna died from injuries from his parachute landing, and Baggia is elected as Pope Luke I. Cardinal Strauss, the Pope’s new Camerlengo, gives Langdon the “Diagramma Veritatis” as thanks for his help, and to complete his scholarly work on Galileo. The new Pope gives Langdon and Vittoria a thankful nod, before stepping out on the balcony to greet the crowd below.

==Production==

===Development===
In 2003, Sony Pictures acquired the film rights to ''[[Angels &amp; Demons]]'' along with ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' in a deal with author [[Dan Brown]]. In May 2006, following the release of [[The Da Vinci Code (film)|the 2006 film adaptation of ''The Da Vinci Code'']], Sony Pictures hired screenwriter [[Akiva Goldsman]], who wrote the film adaptation of ''The Da Vinci Code'', to adapt ''Angels &amp; Demons''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Michael Fleming |url=http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=features2006&amp;content=jump&amp;jump=story&amp;dept=cannes&amp;nav=NCannes&amp;articleid=VR1117943968&amp;cs=1 |title=Brown's "Angels" flies to bigscreen |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=May 23, 2006 |accessdate=December 20, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filming was originally to begin in February 2008 and was originally going to be released on December 19, 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Michael Fleming | title=Howard moves fast with "Code" sequel |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=October 24, 2007 |url=http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=print_story&amp;articleid=VR1117974685&amp;categoryid=1236 |accessdate=October 31, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; but because of the [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike]], the film was pushed back for May 15, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Tatiana Siegel |title="Da Vinci" prequel hit by strike |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=November 16, 2007 |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117976189.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 |accessdate=November 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Koepp]] rewrote the script before shooting began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Tatiana Siegel |title=Koepp hopes to keep "Town" rolling |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=June 11, 2008 |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117988832.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 |accessdate=October 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Director [[Ron Howard]] chose to treat ''Angels &amp; Demons'' as a sequel to the previous film, rather than a [[prequel]], since many had read the novel after ''The Da Vinci Code''. He liked the idea that Langdon had been through one adventure and become a more confident character.&lt;ref name="empire"&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Ian Freer]] |title=Critical Mass |work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] |date = May 2009|pages=69–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Howard was also more comfortable taking liberties in adapting the story because the novel is less popular than ''The Da Vinci Code''.&lt;ref name="arrested"&gt;{{cite news|author=Edward Douglas |title=Ron Howard on Arrested Development and Angels &amp; Demons |work=ComingSoon.net |date=November 13, 2008 |url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=50497 |accessdate=November 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Producer [[Brian Grazer]] said they were too "reverential" when adapting ''The Da Vinci Code'', which resulted in it being "a little long and stagey." This time, "Langdon doesn't stop and give a speech. When he speaks, he's in motion."&lt;ref name="faster"&gt;{{cite news|author=Scott Bowles |title=First look: "Angels &amp; Demons" will fly faster than "Da Vinci" |work=[[USA Today]] |date=October 17, 2008 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2008-10-27-angels-demons_N.htm?loc=interstitialskip |accessdate=October 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Howard concurred "it's very much about modernity clashing with antiquity and technology vs. faith, so these themes, these ideas are much more active whereas the other one lived so much in the past. The tones are just innately so different between the two stories."&lt;ref name=arrested/&gt;

===Differences between novel and film===
* In the novel, the papal conclave attracts relatively little public attention. In the wake of the huge international interest in the [[Papal conclave, 2005|2005 election]] of [[Pope Benedict XVI]], this was judged to be out of date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Hanks| first = Tom| author2 = interviewed by Charlie Rose| title = A conversation about the film "Angels and Demons"| publisher = PBS television (transcript)| date = May 13, 2009| url = http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/10294#frame_top| accessdate = June 12, 2009| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090517111531/http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/10294#frame_top| archivedate = May 17, 2009| deadurl = yes| df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character of CERN Director Maximillian Kohler does not appear in the film. The Italian Camerlengo Carlo Ventresca is changed to the Irish Patrick McKenna, portrayed by [[Ewan McGregor]]. The [[Boeing X-33]] that takes Langdon from the United States to Geneva and then to Rome is absent in the film. In the novel, Commander Olivetti is the commander of [[Swiss Guard]], and his second in command is Captain Rocher, whereas in the film, Richter is the head of the Swiss Guard. In the novel, the Assassin contacts members of the BBC in order to influence how they present the story of his activities, but this does not happen in the film. The character Leonardo Vetra is named Silvano Bentivoglio in the film, is not related to Vittoria and his death scene is changed. Vittoria is a love interest for Langdon in the novel while there is no attraction present in the film. In the novel Camerlengo Carlo Ventresca is revealed to be the late pope's biological son, while in the film he is his adoptive son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What's the Difference between Angels and Demons the Book and Angels and Demons the Movie|url=http://thatwasnotinthebook.com/diff/angels_and_demons_book_2000_vs_angels_and_demons_movie_2009|publisher=thatwasnotinthebook.com|accessdate=18 Oct 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the film, the Camerlengo briefly acknowledges Langdon's involvement in some events of the [[The Da Vinci Code (film)|previous film]] when in the book it does not, as the events in ''The Da Vinci Code'' are yet to take place. This is due to the fact the first novel in the film series was adapted to film after the second book rather than in the order of first-to-last. 
* In the book, the assassin has Middle Eastern looks whereas in the movie he is portrayed by a Danish actor. In the film, he is killed by a car bomb, whereas in the book he falls from a balcony at the top of the [[Castel Sant Angelo]] and breaks his back on a pile of marble cannonballs which eventually kills him.
* In the novel, Vittoria is kidnapped, whereas in the film, she accompanies Langdon almost everywhere. In the book, all four preferiti are killed by the assassin and eventually the high elector, Cardinal Saverio Mortati, is elected as the new pope, whereas in the film, the fourth preferito, Cardinal Baggia, is saved by Langdon and is elected the new pope. The high elector, renamed Cardinal Strauss, becomes the Camerlengo to the new pope.
* In the book, the fifth brand is one that incorporates all four words from the previous four, whereas in the film, the fifth brand is the crossed keys, symbolic of the Papacy.
* The means by which the heroes discover the location of the bomb is significantly different. In the book, the Camerlengo feigns a religious vision from god, telling him where to find the bomb. In the film, he feeds Langdon a clue to the bomb's location by branding himself with an upside-down version of the papal keys, which Langdon successfully deduces is a metaphor for [[Saint Peter]], the first pope, who was crucified upside-down.
* In the book, Langdon stows away on the Camerlengo's helicopter, and just before the antimatter explosion, jumps out using a makeshift parachute, and lands on [[Isola Tiberina]], whose mythical healing powers heal the injuries he incurs from the fall. In the film, Langdon does not get on the helicopter.
* In the book's closing scenes, a Swiss Guard hands Langdon the fifth brand, the Illuminati diamond, as a gift. In the film, the new Camerlengo hands over Galileo's book to Langdon.

===Filming===
[[Principal photography|Shooting]] began on June 4, 2008, in Rome under the [[title ruse|fake working title]] ''Obelisk''.&lt;ref name="stop"&gt;{{cite news|author=Elisabetta Povoledo |title=Dan Brown Tourists: Next Stop, Rome? |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 24, 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/24/movies/24ange.html?ref=movies |accessdate=August 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The filmmakers scheduled three weeks of exterior location filming because of a predicted [[2008 Screen Actors Guild strike]] on June 30.

[[File:Angels&amp;DemonsPantheon.JPG|thumb|Ayelet Zurer and Tom Hanks outside the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]]]]
Howard hated that the Writers Guild strike forced him to delay shooting the film until summer. However, the quick shoot allowed him to refine the [[naturalism (theatre)|naturalism]] he had employed on his previous film ''[[Frost/Nixon (film)|Frost/Nixon]]'', often using handheld cameras to lend an additional energy to the scenes.

Hanks interrupted filming of one scene in order to help Australian bride Natalia Dearnley get through the crowds to her wedding on time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=815244 Hanks saves Aussie bride], [[Nine News]]. Published May 19, 2009. Retrieved September 13, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; McGregor said the Pope's funeral was the dullest sequence to film, as they were just walking across staircases. Then, "Someone started singing '[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]' [and] it became the funeral theme tune."&lt;ref name="empire"/&gt;

When recreating the interior of [[St. Peter's Basilica]], production designer Allan Cameron and visual effects supervisor Angus Bickerton recognized the {{cvt|80|ft|m}} tall soundstages were only half the size of the real church. They rebuilt the area around and the crypts beneath [[St. Peter's baldachin]], including the bottoms of the columns and [[Saint Peter]]'s statue, and surrounded it with a 360 degree greenscreen so the rest could be built digitally. Cameron had twenty crew members, posing as members of the public, photograph as much as they could inside the [[Sistine Chapel]], and had artists sketch, photograph and enlarge recreations of the paintings and mosaics from the photographs. Cameron chose to present the Sistine Chapel as it was before [[Restoration of the Sistine Chapel frescoes|the restoration of its frescoes]], because he preferred the contrast the smoky, muted colors would present with the cardinals. Although the chapel was built to full size, the [[Sala Regia (Vatican)|Sala Regia]] was made smaller to fit inside the stage.&lt;ref name="location"&gt;{{cite web|title=On Location |work=Official website |url=http://www.angelsanddemons.com/site/entry.php#location |accessdate=March 25, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216204925/http://angelsanddemons.com/site/entry.php |archivedate=February 16, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Saint Peter's Square]] and the [[Piazza Navona]] sets were built on the same [[backlot]]; after completion of scenes at the former, six weeks were spent converting the set, knocking down the Basilica side and excavating {{cvt|3+1/2|ft|m|0}} of tarmac to build the fountain. As there had been filming at the real Piazza Navona, the transition between it and the replica had to be seamless. To present the [[Santa Maria del Popolo]] undergoing renovation, a police station in Rome opposite the real church was used for the exterior; the scaffolding would hide that it was not the church. Cameron built the interior of Santa Maria del Popolo on the same set as the recreated [[Santa Maria della Vittoria, Rome|Santa Maria della Vittoria]] to save money; the scaffolding also disguised this. The film's version of Santa Maria della Vittoria was larger than the real one, so it would accommodate the cranes used to film the scene. To film the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon's]] interior, two [[aedicula]]e and the tomb of [[Raphael]] were rebuilt to scale at a height of {{cvt|30|ft|m|0}}, while the rest was greenscreen. Because of the building's symmetrical layout, the filmmakers were able to shoot the whole scene over two days and [[redress]] the real side to pretend it was another.&lt;ref name=location/&gt; The [[second unit]] took photographs of the [[Large Hadron Collider]] and pasted these in scenes set at [[CERN]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Perkins|first1=Ceri|title=ATLAS gets the Hollywood treatment|url=http://atlas-service-enews.web.cern.ch/atlas-service-enews/2007-8/news_07-8/news_angelphoto.php|website=ATLAS e-News|publisher=CERN|accessdate=24 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
===Box office===
Overseas, ''Angels &amp; Demons'' maintained the #1 position for the second weekend as well even with the release of ''[[Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian]]'', which opened at #2. The film opened with $46 million at the domestic box office. ''The Da Vinci Code'' had opened domestically to $77.1 million, but the sequel's opening met Columbia's $40–50 million prediction, since the film's source material was not as popular as its predecessor's. Within more than a month, the film grossed $478,869,160 worldwide, making it the largest-grossing film of 2009 until it was surpassed by ''[[Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title="Angels &amp; Demons" flies high at box office (Reuters) |work=[[Yahoo!

===Catholic Church response===
''[[CBS News]]'' interviewed a priest working in [[Santa Susanna]], who stated the Church did not want their churches to be associated with scenes of murder. A tour guide also stated most priests do not object to tourists who visit out of interest after reading the book, a trend which will continue after people see the film. "I think they are aware that it's... a work of fiction and that it's bringing people into their churches."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fans Line Up For "Angels &amp; Demons" Tours |work=[[CBS News]] |date=June 19, 2008 |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/06/19/earlyshow/leisure/boxoffice/main4193975.shtml |accessdate=June 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grazer deemed it odd that although ''The Da Vinci Code'' was a more controversial novel, they had more freedom shooting its film adaptation in London and France.&lt;ref name="faster"/&gt; Italian authorities hoped the filmmakers corrected the location errors in the novel, to limit the amount of explaining they will have to do for confused tourists.&lt;ref name=stop/&gt;

[[William A. Donohue]], president of the [[Catholic League (U.S.)|Catholic League]], did not call for a boycott, but requested that Catholics inform others about anti-Catholic sentiments in the story. "My goal... is to give the public a big FYI: Enjoy the movie, but know that it is a fable. It is based on malicious myths, intentionally advanced by Ron Howard." A Sony executive responded that they were disappointed Donohue had not created attention for the film closer to its release date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Tatiana Siegel |title=Catholic controversy doesn't bug Sony |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=March 6, 2009 |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118000940.html |accessdate=March 18, 2009| archiveurl= https://archive.is/20120915115313/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118000940.html| archivedate= September 15, 2012 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Howard criticized Donohue for prejudging the film, responding that it could not be called anti-Catholic since Langdon protects the Church, and because of its depiction of priests who support science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Ron Howard]] |title=Angels &amp; Demons: It's A Thriller, Not A Crusade |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=April 20, 2009 |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ron-howard/iangels-demonsi-its-a-thr_b_189053.html |accessdate=April 21, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090422180718/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ron-howard/iangels-demonsi-its-a-thr_b_189053.html| archivedate= April 22, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official Vatican newspaper ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'' called the film "harmless entertainment", giving it a positive review and acknowledging that "the theme is always the same: a sect versus the Church, [but] this time, the Church is on the side of the good guys."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Demons "harmless", says Vatican |work=[[BBC News Online]] |date=May 7, 2009 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8037538.stm |accessdate=May 7, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090510131825/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8037538.stm| archivedate= May 10, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/5290910/Angels-and-Demons-Vatican-breaks-silence-to-review-film.html |title=Angels and Demons: Vatican breaks silence to review film |date=May 7, 2009 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=May 7, 2009 | location=London | first=Anita | last=Singh| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090509005352/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/5290910/Angels-and-Demons-Vatican-breaks-silence-to-review-film.html| archivedate= May 9, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beforehand, it had stated it would not approve the film, while ''[[La Stampa]]'' reported the Vatican would boycott it. However, it also quoted [[Velasio de Paolis|Archbishop Velasio De Paolis]] as saying a boycott would probably just have the "[[Streisand effect|boomerang effect]]" of drawing more attention to ''Angels &amp; Demons'' and making it more popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Eric J.

Introvigne also criticizes the Illuminati mythology that is treated as historical fact.

====Banned in Samoa====
In [[Samoa]], the film was banned by film censor Lei'ataua Olo'apu. Olo'apu stated that he was banning the film because it was "critical of the Catholic Church" and so as to "avoid any religious discrimination by other denominations and faiths against the Church." The ''Samoa Observer'' remarked that Olo'apu himself is Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.samoaobserver.ws/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=8309:chief-censor&amp;catid=1:latest-news&amp;Itemid=50 "Chief censor bans movie Angels and Demons"], ''Samoa Observer'', May 21, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The Censorship Board had previously banned the film ''The Da Vinci Code'',&lt;ref name="RNZI_24194"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=24194 |title=Samoa’s government censor bans Da Vinci Code film |date=May 21, 2006 |work=[[Radio New Zealand International]] |accessdate=September 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; for being "contradictory to Christian beliefs."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radioaustralianews.net.au/stories/200904/2557247.htm?desktop "Samoa bans 'Milk' film"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219112942/http://www.radioaustralianews.net.au/stories/200904/2557247.htm?desktop |date=February 19, 2012 }}, ABC Radio Australia, April 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Merge to|Cryptolect|discuss=Talk:Cant (language)#Merge to Cryptolect|date=September 2017}} 
An '''argot''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|ˈ|ɑr|ɡ|oʊ}}; from [[French language|French]] ''argot'' {{IPAc-fr|a|r|ˈ|ɡ|o}} '[[slang]]') is a [[Cant (language)|secret language]] used by various groups—e.g., schoolmates, outlaws, colleagues, gay people ([[Polari]]) among many others—to prevent outsiders from understanding their conversations. The term ''argot'' is also used to refer to the informal specialized vocabulary from a particular field of study, occupation, or hobby, in which [[word sense|sense]] it overlaps with [[jargon]]. The discipline of medicine has been referred to as having its own argot which includes abbreviations, acronyms, and "technical colloquialisms".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hukill|first=Peter B.|last2=H.|first2=A. L.|last3=Jackson|first3=James L.|date=1961|title=The Spoken Language of Medicine: Argot, Slang, Cant|jstor=453853|journal=American Speech|volume=36|issue=2|pages=145–151|doi=10.2307/453853}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author [[Victor Hugo]] was one of the first to research and compile terms from criminal argot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/rschwart/hist255/popcorn/convicts2.html | title=Interesting Facts about Convicts of France in the 19th Century | author=Schwartz, Robert M. |publisher=Mt. Holyoke University}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1862 novel ''[[Les Misérables]],'' he refers to that argot as both "the language of the dark" and "the language of misery."

The earliest known record of the term ''argot'' in this context was in a 1628 document. The word was probably derived from the contemporary name ''les argotiers'', given to a group of thieves at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Guiraud, Pierre, ''L'Argot. Que sais-je?'', Paris: PUF, 1958, p. 700&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the strictest definition, an ''argot'' is a proper language with its own grammar and style. But such complete secret languages are rare because the speakers usually have some public language in common, on which the argot is largely based. Such argots are mainly versions of another language, with a part of its vocabulary replaced by words unknown to the larger public; ''argot'' used in this [[word sense|sense]] is [[synonym]]ous with ''[[cant (language)|cant]]''. For example, ''argot'' in this sense is used for systems such as ''[[verlan]]'' and ''[[louchébem]]'', which retain French syntax and apply transformations only to individual words (and often only to a certain subset of words, such as nouns, or semantic content words).&lt;ref name="valdman"&gt;{{cite journal
 | last = Valdman
 | first = Albert
 | title = La Langue des faubourgs et des banlieues: de l'argot au français populaire

 | date = May 2000
 | jstor = 399371|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such systems are examples of ''argots à clef'', or "coded argots."&lt;ref name="valdman"/&gt;

Specific words can go from argot into common speech or the other way. For example, modern [[French language|French]] ''[[wikt:loufoque|loufoque]]'' 'crazy, goofy', now common usage, originates in the ''[[louchébem]]'' transformation of Fr. ''[[wikt:fou|fou]]'' 'crazy'.

"Piaf" is a Parisian argot word for "bird, [[sparrow]]". It was taken up by singer [[Edith Piaf]] as her stage name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/06/25/french-blues| title=French Blues| author=Judith Thurman| date=June 25, 2007| accessdate=May 5, 2015| publisher=[[The New Yorker]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Art Directors Club of New York''' is an organization for art directors in [[New York City]]. It was founded in 1920, and has grown as an industry group, promoting art directors' work through exhibitions and awards, including the annual DESI award for design excellence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = History|url = http://adcglobal.org/about/history/|website = ADC • Global Awards &amp; Club|accessdate = 2016-01-02|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Art Directors Club of New York (sometimes referred to as  the "ADC") was founded in 1920 by Louis Pedlar and [[Earnest Elmo Calkins]]. With Fred Lamb, Calkins had organized the first advertising art exhibits in New York City in 1908,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bird|first=Harry Lewis|title=This Fascinating Advertising Business|origyear=1947|year=2008|publisher=Bobbs-Merrill, reprinted by Wildside Press|isbn=9781434475541|pages=308}}&lt;/ref&gt; and saw a need for an organization that would “dignify the field of business art in the eyes of artists”, emphasizing his belief that “artistic excellence is vitally necessary to successful advertising”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.adcglobal.org/adc/history/|publisher=Art Directors Club of New York|accessdate=April 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1947, the Club's work was being credited with a gradual increase in advertising art standards throughout the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bird|first=Harry Lewis|title=This Fascinating Advertising Business|origyear=1947|year=2008|publisher=Bobbs-Merrill, reprinted by Wildside Press|isbn=9781434475541|pages=309}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Graphic Design, Referenced: A Visual Guide to the Language, Applications, and History of Graphic Design|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=EwPu8I6D5y4C|publisher = Rockport Publishers|date = 2011-12-01|isbn = 9781592537426|first = Bryony Gomez|last = Palacio|first2 = Armin|last2 = Vit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921, the club hosted their first juried exhibition with original work from over 250 contributors. The exhibition organized by Calkins and opened with an inaugural dinner on March 2, 1921. The awards that evening went to: Fred R. Cruger for black and white illustration; W.E. Hoitland for painting; and Rene Clark for poster design.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Advertising &amp; Selling with the Advertising News|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=RtFBAQAAMAAJ|publisher = Advertising &amp; Selling Company|date = 1921-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = THE WORLD OF ART:; French Paintings and American Prints|url = http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1921/03/20/112676937.html?pageNumber=35|website = timesmachine.nytimes.com|accessdate = 2016-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Art Directors Club was restrictive in its membership during its early years. Women were not admitted until 1942. George Olden, an art director with the [[Columbia Broadcasting Company]], was the first African-American member, having been elected to the Club in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=JET|date=3 April 1952|volume= 1|issue= 23|pages=37|publisher=Johnson Publishing Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Art Directors' Club includes art directors working in film and ''[[New media]]''. 

=== Logo ===
The first logo was an interpretation of [[Albrecht Dürer|Albrecht Dürer’s]] signature. In 2009, ADC rebranded with the help of [[Trollbäck + Company]]. The new logo moved away from a monogram and introducing a word mark in bold hues. In 2014, they updated their logo with a monogram created by [[Sid Lee]] that references historical ADC monograms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Brand New: New Logo and Identity for ADC by Sid Lee|url = http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_adc_by_sid_lee.php#.VogZFpMrLMU|website = www.underconsideration.com|accessdate = 2016-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = New Art Directors Club Logo Comes in Colors, Primed for ‘Pimping’|url = http://www.adweek.com/fishbowlny/new-art-directors-club-logo-comes-in-colors-primed-for-pimping/278747|website = www.adweek.com|accessdate = 2016-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==

=== ADC Annual Awards ===
Earnest Elmo Calkins organized the first juried exhibition in 1921. The ADC evolved this exhibition into its ADC Annual Awards that receives up to 11,000 entries from around the world.

[[Image:edinburgh fringe festival.jpg|thumb|[[Edinburgh Festival Fringe|Edinburgh Fringe]], [[Scotland]], a notable arts festival]]
An '''arts festival''' is a [[festival]] that can encompass a wide range of art genres including music, dance, film, fine art, literature, poetry etc. and isn't solely focused on "visual arts." Arts festivals may feature a mixed program that include music, literature, comedy, children's entertainment, science, or street theatre, and are typically presented in venues over a period of time ranging from as short as a day or a weekend to a month.&lt;ref name="KorzaMagie1989"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pam Korza|author2=Dian Magie|title=The Arts Festival Work Kit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uOrR9uPZ-IgC|year=1989|publisher=Arts Extension Service|isbn=978-0-945464-02-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each event within the program is usually separately ticketed.

Arts festivals are largely curated by an artistic director who handles the organizations' artistic direction and can encompass different genres, including [[fringe festivals|fringe theater festivals]] that are open access, making arts festivals distinctive from greenfield festivals, which typically are weekend camping festivals such as [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury]], and Visual Arts Festivals, which concentrate on the visual arts.

Another type of arts festivals are music festivals, which are outdoor musical events usually spanning a weekend, featuring a number of bands and musical genres including pop, rock, heavy-metal, and more. Since the 1960s, world-music festivals have become popular in a variety of countries. The most well-recognized music festival was [[Woodstock]], which took place in 1969 in Bethel, New York. It was attended by 400,000 people and featured performances by The Who, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and the Grateful Dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Hutchinson Unabridged Encyclopedia with Atlas and Weather Guide|last=|first=|publisher=Helikon|year=2016|isbn=|edition=1|location=Abington UK|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=40 years after Woodstock, a more harmonious society|last=14 August 2009|first=|date=|work=USA TODAY|access-date=5 November 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Probably the two oldest arts festivals are located in England. The [[Three Choirs Festival]] in the West of England was established as a "yearly musical assembly" by 1719.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.3choirs.org/about/three-choirs-history-festival-anthony-boden.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091215092316/http://www.3choirs.org/about/three-choirs-history-festival-anthony-boden.html |date=15 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The other is the [[Norfolk and Norwich Festival]] which first took place in 1772.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norwich.gov.uk/internet_docs/docs/Unitary_Council/AnnexB.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621211721/http://www.norwich.gov.uk/internet_docs/docs/Unitary_Council/AnnexB.pdf |date=21 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest arts festival in England today is the [[Brighton Festival Fringe]].

Leading arts festivals include the [[Edinburgh Festival]] in [[Edinburgh]], [[Adelaide Festival of Arts]] in [[Adelaide]], the [[Biennale of Sydney]], [[Festival d'Avignon]] in [[Avignon]], France,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first=Robyn |last=Archer |authorlink=Robyn Archer |title=Putting Festivals in their Place |booktitle=Keynote address to the British Festivals Association conference |date=October 2006 |location=Cardiff }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[TIMF|Tongyeong International Music Festival]] in [[Tongyeong]], Korea and Sanskruti Arts Festival, Upvan, India. One-off arts festivals have included the Liverpool08 [[European Capital of Culture]] in 2008.

In the summer of 1793, revolutionary France was invaded by foreign armies which resulted in the destruction of all signs of royalty. During this time, French citizens sang, danced, and theaters as well as indoor music multiplied. By 1793, two dozen new venues for music and drama had been established, as a result of the end of restrictive monopolies that previously ruled. Art dealings were rapidly increasing and as a flood of paintings were for sale, this reduced artists to near impoverishment. Therefore, as a result, this called for an attempt to replace the old system of the arts with a new one. This gave rise to festivals that were used not only as an artistic outlet, but also for political protest against the old government system. These festivals often included religious symbolism, political messages and embodied the spirit of liberty, equality and fraternity. In 1792, The "Festival of Liberty" included a Declaration of the rights of man, busts of Voltaire, Rousseau, and Franklin, a hymn to liberty, women in white carrying chains, and a large chariot with a seated statue of liberty &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/45304719|title=The invention of art : a cultural history|last=1934-|first=Shiner, L.

==Types of arts festivals==
{{See also|:Category:Arts festivals by type}}

===Arts festival===
{{Main|:Category:Arts festivals}}
An Arts Festival is an umbrella-term for a festival that focuses on multiple art genres including fine art (painting, drawing, pottery), music, photography, film, and other visual styles &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wisegeek.net/what-is-an-art-festival.htm|title=What Is an Art Festival? (with pictures)|work=wiseGEEK|access-date=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fringe festival]]s are a type of arts festival, often focusing on many arts but sometimes focusing on a specific art such as theater more than others.&lt;ref name="KorzaMagie1989"/&gt; Some subgenres of an arts festival include art fairs, theater festivals, dance festivals, film festivals, music festivals (pop festivals) and more. {{Main|:Category:Art festivals|:Category:Art fairs}}

===Art Fair===
An '''art fair''' is a subgenre of arts festival that focuses on [[visual art]] specifically, or specific fields of visual art such as [[List of new media art festivals|new media art festivals]]. Other subgenres of art festivals are termed [[:Category:Photography festivals|photography festivals]] or [[:Category:Street art festivals|street art festivals]], for example. Typically, an art fair has a wide range of artists, art dealers, collectors, and curators who buy or sell artwork in a venue, or gallery, that is open to the public. Some items for sale include photography, paintings, drawings, metalwork, handcrafted items and pottery.

Festivals of visual arts are also not to be confused with '''commercial art fairs'''. Artists participate in the most important of such festival exhibitions by invitation, and these exhibitions (e.g. the [[Venice Biennale]]) are organised by internationally recognized curators chosen by a committee of peers. Conversely art fairs are market-oriented shows where art dealers exhibit and sell the work of the artists they represent.

===Theater festival===
{{expand section|date=December 2015}}
{{Main|:Category:Dance festivals}}The first drama festival was in 543BC, at the Athenian Great Dionysia. At the drama festivals, playwrights and poets competed to have their plays performed, and the actors competed to win the title for best performance. The performances were given in semi-circular auditorium cut into hillsides and capable of seating 10,000–20,000 people. The stage consisted of a dancing floor, an orchestra, dressing room and scene-building area, known as a skene. The actors were typically men who wore masks appropriate to the characters they represented, and each might play several parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/46471972|title=Chambers dictionary of world history|date=2000|publisher=Chambers|others=Lenman, Bruce., Anderson, Trevor.|isbn=0550130004|location=Edinburgh|oclc=46471972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film festival===
{{Main|:Category:Theatre festivals}}
{{expand section|date=December 2015}}
[[Film festival]]s are organized events, usually staged by universities, private organizations, local governments, or arts associations, that show films in cinemas or screening venues and provide filmmakers a chance to get notable recognition among fellow film enthusiasts. Films can include international and domestic releases and can even be on a specific film-maker, genre or subject matter. Film festivals are typically annual events and can feature full-length or short films.

One of the most notable Film Festivals is the [[Sundance Film Festival]], which originated from [[Salt Lake City]] in 1984 as part of the Sundance Institute organization and was founded by Robert Redford. To this date, it is one of the largest independent cinema festivals in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sundance Film Festival|last=Myers|first=Alice|publisher=Salem Press Encyclopedia|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poetry festival===
Poetry festivals are organized events staged by poetry and literature groups, local arts associations, private organizations and others that showcase contemporary poetry and provide a chance for poets to meet each other, celebrate poetry, critique each other's work and debate poetic issues. Poets can include international, national and local writers, and can include a specific theme. They are often held in a particular location over set dates. In contrast to literary festivals, poetry festivals put poetry centre stage. Poetry Festivals are typically annual events. Festivals established for more than 10 years in the UK include the festivals at Aldeburgh,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aldeburghpoetryfestival.org/|title=Aldeburgh Poetry Festival-You Will Enjoy Poetry In Its Entire Forms|author=|date=|website=Aldeburgh Poetry Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ledbury&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.poetry-festival.co.uk/|title=Ledbury Poetry Festival 29th June to 8th July 2018|website=Ledbury Poetry Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Torbay,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torbaypoetryfestival.co.uk/|title=Torbay Festival of Poetry|author=|date=|website=www.torbaypoetryfestival.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Stanza Poetry festival in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stanzapoetry.org/festival|title=StAnza Festival 2018|website=StAnza, Scotland's Poetry Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt; In India, a number of popular poetry festivals and in Northeast India, Guwahati Grand Poetry festival and Assam Arts Biennale, which began in 2018, are the first of its kind in the region.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21832">[[File:Jeff Koons Shankbone 2009 Vanity Fair.jpg|thumb|Jeff Koons in 2009]]'''''Banality''''' is a series of [[sculpture]]s by American artist [[Jeff Koons]].  The works were unveiled in 1988 and have become controversial for their use of copyrighted images.  Several editions of the sculptures have sold at auction for millions of dollars.

==Series details==

The series consists of a number of large sculptures inspired by [[Hummel figurines]] and has been described as [[kitsch]].  They were designed to convey the emotion of "lying in the grass and taking a deep breath".&lt;ref name="Bader"&gt;{{cite news|author=Bader, Graham|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0268/is_1_47/ai_n35574129/?tag=content;col1|title=Jeff Koons: Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago|website=ArtForum|publisher=FindArticles.com|date=September 2008|accessdate=November 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When it was first unveiled, the series was simultaneously on show at three different galleries - at the [[Sonnabend Gallery]] in [[New York City]], at the Donald Young Gallery in [[Chicago]] and at the [[Galerie Max Hetzler]] in [[Cologne]]&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Haden-Guest: ''True Colors. The Real Life of the Art World''. Atlantic Monthly Press, New York 1998, {{ISBN|0871137259}}, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; - possible because several editions of each sculpture were made.  Koons promoted his works by taking out four advertisements in the major trade magazines.  Each of the full-page features depicted different parts of Koons' reputed persona:
#A propagator of the banal: Koons is shown alongside two pigs - published in ''[[Flash Art]]''
#A bad influence on future generations: he is in a classroom with lots of children, a blackboard contains the slogans "Exploit the Masses" and "Banality as Savior" - published in ''[[Artforum]]''
#A [[gigolo]]: he is standing in front of a boudoir-style tent - published in ''[[Flash Art]]''
#A ladies man: he is with a [[Shetland pony]] and several women in bikinis - published in ''[[Arts Magazine]]'' and ''[[Art in America]]''

The advertisements were the first time that Koons was featured in his own work, exploiting the reputation that the media and his critics had propagated.&lt;ref name="tateetc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/tateetc/issue1/article5.htm|title=Lives of the Artists|author=Gingeras, Alison M.|work=Tate etc. Issue 1|date=Summer 2004|accessdate=November 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artwelove.com/artist/-id/2099d2d1|title=Jeff Koons|publisher=artwelove.com|accessdate=November 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several sculptures from the series have been adjudged to have broken copyright laws.  Koons has defended his works on numerous occasions but the courts have repeatedly rejected his claims of [[fair use]] by [[parody]].&lt;ref name="ASOPA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asopa.com/publications/2000winter/law.htm |title=Art &amp; LAW: Derivative Works And Copyright • Painting from Another's Photograph |author=Fergus, Mary Ann |date=Winter 2000 |accessdate=November 6, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027210406/http://www.asopa.com/publications/2000winter/law.htm |archivedate=October 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lawbook"&gt;{{cite book|title=Law, ethics, and the visual arts|author1=Merryman, John Henry|author2=Elsen, Albert Edward|author3=Urice, Stephen K.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_8AddekkdZ8C&amp;pg=PA566&amp;lpg=PA566|pages=566–567}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="owe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.owe.com/legalities/legalities30.htm|title=Legalities 30: Jeff Koons and Copyright Infringement|author=Kattwinkel, Linda Joy|publisher=OWE|accessdate=November 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constituent sculptures==
Most of the sculptures are made of [[porcelain]]; three editions of each were produced in addition to the artist's proof.&lt;ref name="ADMSP"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/admsp/sets/72157626107321283/detail/|title=Jeff Koons: Banality|work=Altos del Mar Sculpture Park|publisher=[[Flickr]]|date=March 9, 2011|accessdate=November 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most notable pieces are detailed below.

A smiling brown bear wearing a striped T-shirt has his arm around a shorter policeman who is looking up at the animal.

''Fait d'Hiver'' depicts a woman lying on her back in the snow.  The upper torso and head of the woman are featured in the sculpture, her breasts exposed beneath a sparsely-knitted dress.  A pig and two penguins stand near to her head, adding the kitsch element that is thematic throughout the collection.  The catalogue colourfully described the work as a "Walt Disney version of an erotic fantasy ... juxtaposing a strong sexual element with the saccharine sweetness of decorative knicknacks".  It went on to say that the "disturbing combination identifies a primal hunger at the heart of American consumerism".&lt;ref name="cityreview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecityreview.com/f01pcon1.html|title=Contemporary Art, Part I|author=Horsley, Carter B.|publisher=The City Review|date=November 12, 2001|accessdate=November 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Koons based the design of the woman on a photograph of porn actress [[Ilona Staller]] that featured in ''[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]]''.&lt;ref name="cityreview" /&gt;  He had not met Staller at the time but went on to have a very public relationship with her, using her as a muse for many subsequent works.&lt;ref name="tateetc" /&gt;

''Pink Panther'' is a 41-inch tall porcelain sculpture featuring [[Jayne Mansfield]] holding the cartoon character [[Pink Panther (character)|Pink Panther]].  Mansfield is sculpted from the waist up and is partly clothed, her breasts being exposed;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F05EEDF173EF932A25750C0A9679D8B63&amp;pagewanted=all|title=INSIDE ART; MoMA to Acquire Cy Twombly Works|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|author=Vogel, Carol|date=March 11, 2011|accessdate=November 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; her right hand covers her nearly-exposed breast.  The Pink Panther is shown in full, his chin over the left shoulder of Mansfield.

Inspired by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s painting, ''[[St. John the Baptist (Leonardo)|St. John the Baptist]]'', Koons' sculpture was made in the same pose but he also added a pig and a bird into the saint's arms.

One edition of the sculpture was set to go on show at the Wright Exhibition Space in [[Seattle]] in February 2004, but it was discovered to have a sizeable crack along the arm.  Bought in 1991 for US$150,000, the damage is expected to have reduced the resale price of the piece, though none of the editions have been sold at auction since.  Patricia Leavengood, a sculpture conservation specialist, partly restored the damage and reduced the visibility of the crack.  She noted, however, that "When it cracked, part of it slid forward and can't be moved back into place&amp;nbsp;... Porcelain wasn't meant to exist at this size.

''String of Puppies'' is a porcelain sculpture depicting a man and a woman sat on a bench holding eight blue puppies.  The inspiration came from a photograph by [[Art Rogers]] entitled ''Puppies''.  Koons found the picture on a postcard and, when he gave it to his assistants with instructions on how to model the sculpture, he asked that as much detail be copied as possible.  He requested a few changes to the original, asking for the puppies to be blue with exaggerated noses, and for flowers to be added to the hair of the man and woman.  The three editions of the sculpture were sold for a total of $367,000.&lt;ref name="ASOPA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lawbook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rogers"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9102865469766650757&amp;q=rogers+v.+koons&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,5|title=Rogers v.

Upon discovering that his picture had been copied, [[Rogers v. Koons|Rogers sued Koons]] and the Sonnabend Gallery for [[copyright infringement]]. Koons admitted to having copied the image intentionally and, in 1992, the court found "[[substantial similarity]]" between the two works and that Koons acted in a "willful and egregious" manner.

''Wild Boy and Puppy'' is a porcelain sculpture featuring a yellow cartoon dog, a "wild boy" with red spiky hair, and a bumblebee in a basket.  The cartoon dog is a clear replica of [[Odie]] from the ''[[Garfield]]'' comic strip by [[Jim Davis (cartoonist)|Jim Davis]] with only minimal changes.  In 1993, [[United Feature Syndicate, Inc.]] sued Koons for his unsanctioned use of Odie, successfully arguing that he had breached copyright law.  Koons had defended himself in other cases using the parody argument but could not do so here—he testified to being unaware of the source of the character and therefore could not have directed the parody at the comic.&lt;ref name="owe" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4976164098054376167|title=United Feature Syndicate, Inc. v.

Communism alongside [[Marxism-Leninism]] were officially banned in [[Indonesia]] following the aftermath of [[30 September Movement|30 September coup attempt]] and the subsequent [[Indonesian mass killings of 1965-1966|anti-communist killings]],  by adoption of ''TAP MPRS'' no. 25/1966 in 1966 and ''Undang Undang'' no. 27/1999 in 1999, which are still in force. The law does not explicitly declare a ban on symbols of Communism, but [[Indonesian police]] frequently use the law to arrest people displaying it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.detik.com/berita/3206373/ini-penjelasan-kapolri-soal-lambang-palu-arit-yang-dilarang-di-indonesia Police chief explanation on banned hammer and sickle symbol in Indonesia] (in Indonesian)&lt;/ref&gt; Some of its violators were people with no knowledge of symbols of Communism, in which cases the authorities frequently freed them with only minor punishment or small fine applied.&lt;ref&gt;[http://regional.kompas.com/read/2016/07/10/19380351/pakai.kaus.bergambar.palu.arit.seorang.petani.ditangkap.polisi Farmer arrested after wearing shirt with hammer and sickle] (in Indonesian)&lt;/ref&gt; However, displaying such symbols in an attempt to intentionally propagate Communist or Marxist-Leninist ideas are an extremely severe offence, even considered as [[treason]] against the country and could be punished by up to 20 years of prison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://m.hukumonline.com/pusatdata/detail/lt50768a41ad5ab/node/657/tap-mprs-no-xxv_mprs_1966-tahun-1966-pembubaran-partai-komunis-indonesia,-pernyataan-sebagai-organisasi-terlarang-diseluruh-wilayah-negara-republik-indonesia-bagi-partai-komunis-indonesia-dan-larangan-setiap-kegiatan-untuk-menyebarkan-atau-mengembangkan-faham-atau-ajaran-komunis_marxisme-leninisme Explanations on banning communism and Marxism-Leninism in Indonesia] (in Indonesian)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wirantaprawira.de/law/criminal/security/index.html Undang Undang no.27/1999, laws on Communism and Marxism-Leninism] (Indonesian)&lt;/ref&gt; This makes Indonesia a country with a very strict [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] policy compared to other countries that also practiced anti-communism.

Other [[socialist]] and [[left-wing]] related symbols, while not officially prohibited by law (as [[democratic socialism]] itself remained acceptable in the country) are still widely condemned by the Indonesian people and considered as being closely related to Communism in general. These include the [[red star]], the [[socialist heraldry]], the [[red flag (politics)|red flag]], and anthems or slogans such as ''[[The Internationale]]'' and "[[Workers of the world, unite!]]". Despite this, ''The Internationale'' was still remained in use during [[International Labour Day]].

In addition, since the [[Transition to the New Order|New Order regime]] was established in 1967, the [[hammer and sickle]] has become [[social stigma|stigmatized]] in the country, which itself is very similar to how [[Nazi symbolism]] is treated in the West in general. As such, displaying the symbol in public, even without any political intentions, is still regarded as highly offensive. Because of this, Indonesians are usually prone to report those who displayed the symbol in public to the authorities.

Indonesia is the first country in the world to introduce a ban on Communist symbols, not including the [[Axis powers|Axis countries]] during [[World War II]].

In April 2017, Indonesian police detained a [[Malaysians|Malaysian]] tourist at a hotel in [[Mataram (city)|Mataram]] for wearing a T-shirt with an image of the hammer and sickle symbol. The tourist was not aware that Communist symbols were banned in Indonesia. The police seized the T-shirt and released the tourist after giving him a warning.&lt;ref name="Malaysian detained in Indonesia for wearing T-shirt with communist symbol"&gt;{{cite|title = Malaysian detained in Indonesia for wearing T-shirt with communist symbol|url = http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/malaysian-detained-in-indonesia-for-wearing-t-shirt-with-communist-symbol|publisher = The Straits Times|date = 14 April 2017|accessdate = 17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, a Russian tourist was confronted by locals and reported to the police in [[Bali]] for flying a Soviet [[Banner of Victory]] to commemorate [[Victory Day]].

===United States===
During the [[First Red Scare|Red Scare of 1919–20]] in the [[United States]], many states passed laws forbidding the display of [[red flag (politics)|red flag]]s, including [[Minnesota]], [[South Dakota]], [[Oklahoma]],&lt;ref&gt;Zechariah Chafee, Jr., ''Freedom of Speech'' (NY: Harcourt, Brace and Howe, 1920), 180ff., Appendix V&lt;/ref&gt; and [[California]].  In ''[[Stromberg v. California]]'', the United States Supreme Court held that such laws are unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;''Stromberg v. California'', 283 U.S. 359 (1931).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moldova===
In 2009, such a ban was proposed in [[Moldova]] by parliamentarian Oleg Serebryan,&lt;ref name=pola/&gt; and the law came into effect in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/foreign-news/article/moldova-ban-on-use-of-communist-symbols/|title=Moldova: Ban on Use of Communist Symbols - Global Legal Monitor|date=28 November 2012|website=www.loc.gov|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitutional Court of Moldova found it unconstitutional.&lt;ref name=khpg/&gt;  

=== Ukraine ===
In 2015 the Verkhovna Rada passed a [[Ukrainian decommunization laws|law banning communist and nazi symbols]].  Earlier, in 2012, the city of [[Lviv]] in [[Western Ukraine]] banned the public display of Communist symbols.&lt;ref name="runei" /&gt; On December 2015, all communist parties were officially banned in Ukraine.

=== Estonia ===
On November 30, 2006, [[Estonia]]n government signed the draft law to ban politically motivated display of Soviet and Nazi symbols in public places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/1073110.html|title=Estonia Proposes Ban On Soviet, Nazi Symbols|website=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 24, 2007 it was passed in the first reading by the parliament. The bill specifies those symbols: the flags, coats of arms, other attributes, and slogans of the USSR, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Germany's [[Nazi Party]], and its SS organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamestown.org/single/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=32427&amp;no_cache=1#.VrGgU_krKM8 "Moscow stung by Estonian ban on totalitarianism's symbols"], ''Eurasia Daily Monitor'', Vol. 4, Issue 19, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; However, it eventually failed the parliamentary committee on the grounds of [[freedom of speech]]. {{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

=== Lithuania ===
[[Lithuania]] banned Soviet and Nazi symbols in 2008 (Article 188&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; of the Code of Administrative Offences) under the threat of a fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/europe/7459976.stm | work=BBC News | title=Lithuanian ban on Soviet symbols | date=2008-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Article 5 of the Law on Meetings prohibits meetings involving Nazist and Soviet imagery.&lt;ref&gt;Joint amicus curiae brief, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, the laws were in effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltictimes.com/audi_featuring_soviet_symbols_banned_from_entering_lithuania/|title=Audi featuring Soviet symbols banned from entering Lithuania|website=www.baltictimes.com|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Latvia ===
In June 2014, the [[Latvia]]n parliament approved a ban on the display of Soviet and Nazi symbols at all public events. The ban involves flags, anthems, uniforms, Nazi ''[[hakenkreuz]]'' and the Soviet [[hammer and sickle]].&lt;ref name="Latvia Bans Soviet, Nazi Symbols"&gt;{{citation|title = Latvia Bans Soviet, Nazi Symbols|url = http://en.ria.ru/russia/20130621/181788657/Latvia-Bans-Soviet-Nazi-Symbols.html|publisher = RIA Novosti|date = 21 Jun 2013|accessdate = 14 Sep 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Georgia ===
In [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] a ban was introduced in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/foreign-news/article/georgia-ban-on-soviet-symbols-proposed/|title=Georgia: Ban on Soviet Symbols Proposed - Global Legal Monitor|date=8 December 2010|website=www.loc.gov|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it failed to define the applicable sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dfwatch.net/georgia-to-enforce-ban-on-communist-symbols-44753-23804|title=Georgia to enforce ban on communist symbols|date=31 October 2013|publisher=|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, there was a proposal to amend the ban,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-27272993/communist-symbols-to-be-banned-in-georgia|title=Communist symbols to be banned in Georgia|date=4 May 2014|publisher=|accessdate=17 August 2017|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; however as of 2015, the law remained inactive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gcssi.org/wp2/?p=5618|title="Decommunization of Georgia: causes, excuses and permanent interference."|publisher=|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Czech Republic===
In 1991, in [[Czechoslovakia]] the criminal code was amended with w § 260 which banned propaganda of movements which restricted human rights and freedoms, citing Nazism and Communism. Later the specific mentions of these were removed citing their lack of clear legal definition. However the law itself was recognized as constitutional.&lt;ref name=khpg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislationline.org/documents/id/17873 "Joint amicus curiae brief for the Constitutional Court of Moldova on the compatibility with European standards"], p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2005, there was a petition in the [[Czech Republic]] to ban the promotion of Communism and in 2007, there was a proposed amendment to the law to ban Communist symbols. Both attempts failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expats.cz/prague/article/politics/communists-in-czech-politics/|title=Communists in Czech Politics|publisher=|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Joint amicus curiae brief, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Poland ===
In 2009, in [[Poland]]&lt;ref name=pola&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rt.com/politics/poland-bans-communist-symbols/|title=New Polish law equates Communist and Nazi symbols|publisher=|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; § 2 to 4 were added to Article 256, which ban "fascist, communist or other totalitarian symbols" unless used "as part of artistic, educational, collecting or academic activity." On July 19, 2011, the [[Constitutional Tribunal of Poland]] found this ban unconstitutional due to the violation of [[freedom of expression]].&lt;ref&gt;Joint amicus curiae brief, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2017, Poland updated its "[[decommunization]]" legislation to include Soviet propaganda monuments, prompting negative reactions from the Russian government.&lt;ref name="Russia warns Poland not to touch Soviet WW2 memorials"&gt;{{cite|title = Russia warns Poland not to touch Soviet WW2 memorials|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-40775355|publisher = BBC News|date = 31 July 2017|accessdate = 2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hungary ===
[[Hungary]] had a law (Article 269/B of the Criminal Code (2000)) that banned the use of symbols of fascist and communist dictatorships.&lt;ref name=khpg&gt;{{cite web|url=http://khpg.org/en/index.php?id=1430564974|title=Analysis of the Law on Prohibiting Communist Symbols - Human Rights in Ukraine|publisher=|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hungarian Criminal Code 269 / B. § 1993&lt;/ref&gt; The same year the Constitutional Court upheld the law when it was challenged, claiming that the involved restriction of the [[freedom of expression]] was justified.&lt;ref&gt;Joint amicus curiae brief, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2008 the [[European Court of Human Rights]] considered the challenge of Attila Vajnai who was charged with a misdemeanor for use of the [[red star]] and declared the Hungarian law to be in violation of the freedom of expression. The Court recognized the gross violations by the Nazi and Communist regimes; however, it noted that modern Hungary is a stable democracy with negligible chance of dictatorship, therefore restrictions on the freedom of expression have no justification in the country in the form of a "clear, pressing and specific social need".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politics.hu/20080709/european-court-overturns-hungarian-prohibition-on-communist-star/|title=European court overturns Hungarian prohibition on "communist" star|publisher=|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the law was annulled in 2013 by the Constitutional Court, citing the lack of precise definition and the European Court of Human Rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/emergingeurope/2013/02/20/hungary-court-annuls-ban-on-fascist-communist-symbols/|title=Hungary Court Annuls Ban on Fascist, Communist Symbols|first=Veronika|last=Gulyas|date=20 February 2013|publisher=|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2017, Prime Minister [[Viktor Orbán]] introduced a draft law that outlaws merchandise featuring symbols like the Nazi swastika or the communist five-pointed red star, including the one used by the Dutch brewing company [[Heineken International|Heineken]].&lt;ref name="Hungary threatens to ban Heineken's red star as 'communist'"&gt;{{cite|title = Hungary threatens to ban Heineken's red star as 'communist'|url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/24/hungary-threatens-to-ban-heineken-star-logo-as-communist|publisher = The Guardian|date = 24 March 2017|accessdate = 29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Romania ===
[[Romania]]n Law 51/1991, Art.3 considers the following as threats to national security: "initiating, organizing, committing or supporting in any way totalitarian or extremist actions of a communist, fascist, legionary or of any other racist, antisemitic, revisionist, separatist nature that can endanger in any way the unity and territorial integrity of Romania, and inciting actions that can endanger the rule of law". However, symbols are not mentioned in the Law.

=== Bulgaria ===
In [[Bulgaria]], lawmakers have voted on 24 November 2016 to make the public display of communist symbols illegal. The law, known as the "Criminal Nature of the Communist Regime", requires that signs and items created during the Communist regime glorifying the former Communist party and its leaders be removed from public places. A ban is introduced on putting such signs in public places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bta.bg/en/c/DF/id/1466614|title=Parliament Passes Amendments to Act Declaring the Criminal Nature of the Communist Regime in Bulgaria|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.euscoop.com/en/2017/9/7/protests-for-removal-of-soviet-monument|title=New protests for the removal of the statue of the Soviet Army in Sofia|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.calvertjournal.com/news/show/7304/bulgaria-bans-public-display-of-communist-symbols|title=Bulgaria bans public display of communist symbols|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mongolia ===
In 2012, [[Mongolia]] has removed the last statue of [[Vladimir Lenin]] in its capital, [[Ulaanbaatar]]. No law on decommunization in the country will be planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-19940437|title=Mongolian capital removes Lenin|date=14 October 2012|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2018|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Croatia===
The use of fascist and communist symbols is currently under review in [[Croatia]], one of the discussions being the banning of the [[red star]], a symbol used by the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] during the [[Croatian War of Independence]].&lt;ref name="Croatia to Review Use of Fascist, Communist Symbols"&gt;{{cite|title = Croatia to Review Use of Fascist, Communist Symbols|url = http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/croatian-govt-forms-dealing-with-past-council-03-02-2017|publisher = Balkan Insight|author = Sven Milekic|date = 2 March 2017|accessdate = 8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Albania===
[[Albania]]'s Institute for Communist Crimes (ICC) proposed a ban on [[Cinema of Albania|communist-era films]], sparking negative reactions from the public.&lt;ref name="Proposed Ban on Albanian Communist Films Sparks Backlash"&gt;{{cite|title = Proposed Ban on Albanian Communist Films Sparks Backlash|url = http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/initiative-to-ban-albanian-communist-movies-couse-backlash-03-15-2017#sthash.CjsDtU7P.dpuf|publisher = Balkan Insight|author = Fatjona Mejdini|date = 16 March 2017|accessdate = 1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
The [[Flag of East Germany]] was outlawed as an unconstitutional and criminal symbol in West Germany and West Berlin, where it was referred to as the {{lang|de|Spalterflagge}} (secessionist flag) until the late 1960s, when the ban was lifted.

===South Korea===
Similarly, the [[flag of North Korea]] is prohibited in [[South Korea]] as an unconstitutional symbol though some exceptions exist.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-games-asian-northkorea-flag/seoul-reminds-citizens-of-north-korea-flag-ban-idUSKBN0H708Z20140912&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aroundtherings.com/site/A__62654/Title__South-Korea-Makes-Olympic-Exception-for-North-Korean-Flag/292/Articles|title=South Korea Makes Olympic Exception for North Korean Flag|website=aroundtherings.com|accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==European Union==
In January 2005, [[Vytautas Landsbergis]], backed by  Member of the [[European Parliament]] from Hungary, [[Jozsef Szajer]], urged a ban on the Communist symbols in the [[European Union]], in addition to [[Nazi symbols]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltictimes.com/news/articles/11858/|title=Estonian MEP supports ban of communist symbols|website=www.baltictimes.com|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2005, the [[European Commission]] rejected calls for a proposed Europe-wide ban on Nazi symbols to be extended to cover Communist Party symbols as well. However this rejection did not rule out the individual states having their own laws in this respect.&lt;ref&gt;JOINT AMICUS CURIAE BRIEF, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4248425.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Europe - EU rejects Communist symbol ban|website=news.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2013, a group of MEPs including Landsbergis addressed a letter to the President of the European Parliament, in which they requested a ban of symbols of totalitarian regimes.

In his 1999 Matthews lecture at [[Birkbeck College]], [[Tom Shippey]] discussed bibliophobia in the [[Middle Ages]].  This arose when the literate professions, such as the clergy and [[beadle]]s, would exploit and terrify the [[illiterate]] masses by their command of texts such as religious and legal documents.  He illustrated this with examples from Anglo-Saxon literature such as ''[[The Pardoner's Tale]]''.&lt;ref name=TS&gt;{{citation |title=Bibliophobia: hatred of the book in the Middle Ages |first=Tom |last=Shippey |authorlink=Tom Shippey |publisher=Birkbeck College |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Pan-African|right}}
'''Black orientalism''' is an intellectual and cultural movement found primarily within [[African-American]] circles. While similar to the general movement of [[Orientalism]] in its negative outlook upon [[Western Asia]]n - especially Arab - culture and religion, it differs in both its emphasis upon the role of the [[Arab slave trade]] and the [[Coolie]] slave trade in the historic dialogue between [[sub-Saharan Africa]] and the [[Arab world|Arab]] - and greater [[Muslim world|Muslim]] - world, as well as a lack of colonial promotion over the Middle East region as was promoted by European orientalism in the same region. The term "black orientalism" was first used by Kenyan academic [[Ali Mazrui]] in his critique of [[Henry Louis Gates, Jr.]]'s documentary ''Wonders of the African World''. Supporters of this movement include writers such as [[Chinweizu Ibekwe|Chinweizu]].

==Black orientalism and Afrocentrism==
Black orientalism, prior to its appropriation by religious Christian black nationalists, was formulated within the context of [[Afrocentrism]]; Jackson later wrote that it was [[Molefi Kete Asante]] who formed the base of its black orientalism:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Adoption of Islam is as contradictory to the [[African diaspora|Diasporan]] Afrocentricity as [[Christianity]] has been. Christianity has been dealt with admirably by other writers, notably [[Maulana Karenga|Karenga]]; but [[Islam]] within the African- American community ha [sic] yet to come under Afrocentric scrutiny. Understand that this oversight is due more to a sympathetic audience than it is to the perfection of Islam for African-Americans. While the [[Nation of Islam]] under the leadership of [[Elijah Muhammad]] was a transitional nationalist movement, the present emphasis of [[Islam in the United States|Islam in America]] is more cultural and religious.  --Molefi Kete Asante, ''Afrocentricity'' (1988)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reaction by Muslim writers==
The term "black orientalism" was first used by Kenyan academic [[Ali Mazrui]] in his Internet critique of [[Henry Louis Gates, Jr.]]'s documentary ''Wonders of the African World''. Mazrui had criticized the film for having markedly deemphasized the history of Islam in Africa, to the point where the history of Nigeria - half of whose population is Muslim - was all but absent from the general coverage by the documentary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.h-net.org/~africa/sources/mazruigates2.htm ''Black Orientalism? Further Reflections on "Wonders of the African World" by Henry Louis Gates, Jr.''], by Ali Mazrui, November 11, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was later used by [[Sherman Jackson]] in an article for ''[[Islamica Magazine]]'', which criticized Black orientalism as a backlash from the oft-conservative Christian [[African studies]] scholars who have seen [[African American Muslims|Black Islam]] as a political threat of sorts. The article was later included in his book ''Islam and the Blackamerican''.

The neighborhood is bounded by [[Brooklyn Bridge Park]] to the north, the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] to the west, [[Brooklyn Heights]] to the south and Vinegar Hill to the east. Dumbo is part of [[Brooklyn Community Board 2]].

The area was originally a [[ferry]] landing, characterized by 19th- and early 20th-century industrial and warehouse buildings, [[Sett (paving)|Belgian block]] streets, and its location on the East River by the imposing anchorage of the Manhattan Bridge. The entirety of Dumbo was bought by developer [[David Walentas]] and his company Two Trees Management in the late 20th century, and remade into an upscale residential and commercial community—first becoming a haven for art [[Art museum|galleries]], and currently a center for technology [[Startup company|startups]].

The large community of tech startups earned DUMBO the nickname of "the center of the Brooklyn Tech Triangle". In that time, Dumbo had become Brooklyn's most expensive neighborhood, as well as New York City's fourth-richest community overall; this is owing in part to its large concentration of technology [[Startup company|startups]], its close proximity to Manhattan, and its large number of former industrial buildings that have been converted into spacious [[luxury real estate|luxury]] residential [[lofts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Nonko | first=Emily | title=The 8 Most Expensive Neighborhoods in New York City | website=New York.com | date=January 27, 2015 | url=http://www.newyork.com/articles/real-estate/the-most-expensive-neighborhoods-in-new-york-city-75971 | accessdate=November 7, 2015 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151029075613/http://www.newyork.com/articles/real-estate/the-most-expensive-neighborhoods-in-new-york-city-75971/ | archivedate=October 29, 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The neighborhood is the corporate headquarters for e-commerce retailer [[Etsy]] and home furnishing stores company [[West Elm]].

==History==
The area has been known variously as Rapailie, Olympia, and Walentasville.&lt;ref name="DumboNYC"&gt;{{cite web |title=About Dumbo |url=http://dumbonyc.com/about |work=Dumbo NYC, Brooklyn |publisher=DumboNYC.com |accessdate=December 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Olympia" name came from [[Comfort Sands|Comfort]] and [[Joshua Sands (politician)|Joshua Sands]], who bought the land in 1787&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Olympia Settlement in Early Brooklyn|last = |first = |publisher = |year = 1929|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and were planning to develop the land as a summer place for New Yorkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Dictionary of American Biography|last = Johnson|first = Allen|publisher = Charles Scribner’s Sons|year = 1964|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 341–342}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the 18th and 19th centuries, the area now known as Dumbo was considered part of [[Vinegar Hill, Brooklyn|Vinegar Hill]].&lt;ref name="HISTORICAL DISTRICTS 1966"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1966|title=HISTORICAL DISTRICTS|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/20780654|journal=Real Property, Probate and Trust Journal|volume=1|issue=3|pages=204–211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1890s, the western portion of the neighborhood was known as [[Fulton Landing]], after the [[ferry]] stop that connected it to Manhattan before the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] opened. At that time, it was primarily a manufacturing district, with warehouses and factories that made machinery, paper boxes and [[Brillo]] soap pads. The area has been known variously as Rapailie, Olympia, and Walentasville.&lt;ref name="DumboNYC"/&gt; The [[cardboard box]] was invented in the Robert Gair building on Washington Street by Robert Gair, a Scottish emigrant; because of Gair's fame, the area was known as Gairsville for a long time.&lt;ref name="DumboNYC"/&gt; The Gair building is now home to [[Etsy]].&lt;ref name="usa"/&gt;&gt;

The [[Jay Street Connecting Railroad]] ran through Dumbo's waterfront from circa 1904–1906 through 1957. It ran from rail yards beneath the Manhattan and Brooklyn Bridges to buildings near the waterfront in Dumbo and Vinegar Hill. At the height of operations, it had spurs into several buildings, a [[car float bridge]] on Bridge Street, and a yard with capacity of 120 cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Jay Street Terminal / Jay Street Connecting Railroad | website=TrainWeb.org | date=November 30, 2017 | url=http://members.trainweb.com/bedt/indloco/jst.html | access-date=November 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYPress-JSC-2003&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nypress.com/the-jay-street-connecting-railroad/|title=The Jay Street Connecting Railroad|first=William|last=Bryk|date=April 22, 2003|work=NY Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tracks were abandoned in 1959,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=RAIL LINE TO END ITS BROOKLYN RUN; Jay Street Connecting Road Allowed to Discontinue Operations in Harbor | website=The New York Times | date=April 16, 1959 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1959/04/16/archives/rail-line-to-end-its-brooklyn-run-jay-street-connecting-road.html | access-date=November 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the railroad's tracks are still visible on streets in Dumbo.&lt;ref name=NYPress-JSC-2003/&gt;

With the [[deindustrialization]] of New York City, Dumbo began to become primarily residential; artists and other young homesteaders seeking relatively large and inexpensive [[loft apartment]] spaces for studios and homes began moving there in the late 1970s.&lt;ref name="nyt2007-12-25"/&gt; The acronym "Dumbo" arose in 1978, when new residents coined it in the belief such an unattractive name would help deter developers.&lt;ref name="nyt2007-12-25"/&gt;

Near the end of the 20th century, as property became more and more expensive in Manhattan, Dumbo became increasingly [[gentrification|gentrified]]. Even so, the acronym 'Dumbo' was largely unknown as late as 1997, and the area itself was very inclusive, serving mainly as an enclave for artists located along the [[East River]] and under the [[Manhattan Bridge]]. At this stage there were still many air conditioner repair shops, auto shops, and "seedy back alleys and wharves"; and, because the neighborhood was still gentrifying from its industrial past, it lacked even a bookstore, coffee shop, or [[Self-service laundry|laundromat]].&lt;ref name="nyt 19971010"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE3DC153CF933A25753C1A961958260&amp;pagewanted=all "As It Turns Artistic, A Noirish Enclave Steps Into the Light"].

An '''essay mill''' (also '''term paper mill''') is a business that allows customers to commission an original piece of writing on a particular topic so that they may commit [[academic fraud]]. Customers provide the company with specific information about the essay, including: a page length, a general topic, and a time frame with which to work. The customer is then charged a certain amount per page.&lt;ref name="Bartlett" /&gt; The similar '''essay bank''' concept is a company from which students can purchase pre-written but less expensive essays on various topics, at higher risk of being caught. Both forms of business are under varying legal restraints in some jurisdictions.

==History==
The idea behind term paper mills can be dated back to the mid-nineteenth century in which "paper reservoirs" were located in the basements of fraternity houses. Otherwise known as "fraternity files," these essay banks were practices in which students shared term papers and submitted work that had been done by other students.&lt;ref name="Stavisky"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stavisky |first=Leonard Price |title=Term Paper 'Mills', Academic Plagiarism, and State Regulation |journal=Political Science Quarterly |date=1973 |pages=445–461}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=August 2015|reason=volume, issue, and month missing, so source cannot be verified.}} These essay banks inspired the commercialization of [[ghostwriter|ghostwritten]] essay-writing practices. As early as the 1950s, advertisements were circulating college campus that described services that included ghostwritten work for [[Doctoral dissertation|dissertations]], [[Master's thesis|theses]], and [[term paper]]s.&lt;ref name="Stavisky" /&gt;

In conjunction with this practice, the changing attitudes of students in the 1960s and 1970s started to stray away from diligent and engaged course work because they saw an emphasis on the benefits of community involvement. A new focus on activities outside of the classroom took away from time to focus on class work, thus promoting these writing services throughout college campuses.&lt;ref name="Stavisky" /&gt;

Soon, actual businesses were providing custom-written essays for students in exchange for compensation. They were located near college campuses.&lt;ref name="Pemberton"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pemberton|first=Michael |title=Threshold of Desperation: Winning the Fight Against Term Paper Mills |journal=Writing Instructor |date=March 1992 |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=143–152 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One could walk into a building and peruse pricing pamphlets,  speak to someone directly to place an order, or possibly make a selection from a vault of recycled research papers stored in the basement of these businesses.&lt;ref name="Stavisky" /&gt;

==Products and services==
"Essay mill" companies hire university students, graduates, and professional writers to ghostwrite essays and term papers, and solicit business from university and college students by posting advertisements. Until the early 1990s, most essay mill companies were 'bricks and mortar' businesses offering their services by mail-order or from offices located in university or college towns.&lt;ref name="Pemberton" /&gt; By the 2000s, most essay mill businesses have switched to an [[e-commerce]] business model, soliciting business and selling essays using an Internet website.  Companies often provide free sample essays on popular topics to attract Internet searches.

To obtain an essay, a customer usually submits a form that describes the assignment that he or she wants completed, how many pages it needs to be, and when it needs to be completed by. On the opposite end of the transaction, the employee searches through requests until he or she finds something that sparks their interest. A writer will take anything that they know they can write something that will be quick and hit the page requirement. It does not matter if the writer has previous knowledge about the subject; if it is easy to research, he or she will get the job done.&lt;ref name="Bartlett" /&gt;

Depending on how much a student pays an essay mill, a student can receive a number of different products. The most expensive of these products would be a full-written essay (or even a dissertation) that a student can turn in. Requested papers can follow specific guidelines laid out by the student including the use of a certain amount of sources, a preselected topic, and the receiving of specific grade by the student. Some students may request to receive a high mark on a purchased essay in order to boost their Grade Point Average (GPA), while some may deliberately order an essay that will give them a "C" in order to reduce suspicion of academic fraud. One of the cheaper options an essay mill might offer is just a detailed outline of information a student should include in an essay that a student will write themselves. Due to the nature of this type of transaction, purchasing an outline is very hard for schools to catch as a form of an academic dishonesty.

Similar to essay mills, an '''essay bank''' is a company where students can go to purchase pre-written essays.  Due to the nature of essay bank essays, students may find themselves more likely to be caught for committing academic dishonesty. As a result of this, essay bank essays in general may cost less than those from essay mills.

==Legal status==

Although essay mills and the students who use them are considered unethical by many educational professionals, they do not violate copyright law; the mill is the legal copyright holder of the papers, and the papers are licensed to paying students for limited use.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}  The mill may, however, hold the student legally responsible in the case where they redistribute the paper to other students without the permission of the mill.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} In informal settings where students exchange papers without any formal licensing or transfer of copyright, copyright violation may occur, but it is unlikely that the students will press charges, since they would incriminate themselves by doing so.{{Citation needed|reason=Parts of this paragraph seem to express a legal opinion. Whose opinion is it?|date=May 2014}}

In some countries, essay mills are legally allowed to operate because of the way in which they describe their services.  Essay mills state that the papers that they produce are not intended to be submitted for credit, but rather to be used by the customer to generate ideas to his or her own paper.  When asked if their services are considered cheating, one online company states that, "No, it’s not.  Dealing with us is pretty much like going to the library, where we would be acting as a helpful librarian helping you get enough material for a good grade. We are only offering you to make use of our take on your assignment and the results of our research on your paper's topic."  The company is not responsible if the customer submits the essay verbatim for credit because that goes against the company’s terms of use.

While there is no federal law against the operation of essay mills, there are over a dozen individual states in the US that have their own laws against them.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}  The first major legal battle against an essay mill came in 1972 in the case of ''State of New York v. {{sic|hide=y|reason=Yes, it's "Saksniit", not "Saksnitt", etc.|Saksniit}}''.&lt;ref name="NY vs. Saksniit"&gt;Decision, [http://www.leagle.com/decision/197262369Misc2d554_1483.xml/STATE%20OF%20NEW%20YORK%20v.%20SAKSNIIT State of New York v. Saksniit] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304063159/http://www.leagle.com/decision/197262369Misc2d554_1483.xml/STATE%20OF%20NEW%20YORK%20v.%20SAKSNIIT |date=March 4, 2016 }}, 69 Misc.2d 554 (1972). New York State Supreme Court, Special Term, New York County. April 18, 1972. Via Leagle.com. Accessed: August 12, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  This case involved the state challenging an essay mill's business with reference to the New York Education Law.  The law "condemns the obtaining of a degree by fraudulent means or 'aiding and abetting' another to do the same."&lt;ref name="Jeffes &amp; Janosik"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jeffes|first1=Errin J. |last2=Janosik|first2=Steven M. |title=The Courts' Response to Student Cheating with the Help of Term Paper Mills: Implications for Student Affairs Administrators |journal=College Student Affairs Journal |volume=21 |issue=2 |date=2002 |page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state claimed that the students were using the term papers they purchased for credit and even though the company stated that the essays they wrote were for research purposes only, their advertising scheme encouraged otherwise by boasting about grades.&lt;ref name="NY vs. Saksniit" /&gt; The court determined that the disclaimers did not sufficiently protect the company because their encouragement of cheating and plagiarism hurt the educational system.  The ruling called for the company to cease business in the State of New York.&lt;ref name="Jeffes &amp; Janosik" /&gt; Several other legal battles have been fought since and have largely resulted in the punishment of the term paper writers rather than the students purchasing them.

California Education Code Section 66400 "penalizes the preparation or sale of term papers, thesis, or dissertations for compensation ...." The law is applicable when the preparer/seller knew or should have known that the recipient would submit the paper for academic credit.  State residents or academic institutions "acting for the interest of itself, its students, or the general public" can file suit against offenders for "any relief as is necessary."&lt;ref name="Mocello"&gt;{{cite web |last=Mocello |first=Marie |title=Essay Mills 101: Selling College Term Papers Online May Be a Crime |work=Yahoo Contributor Network: Yahoo Voices |date=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|certain=y|date=August 2015|reason=User-generated content.}}{{dead link|date=August 2015|reason=YCN/YV doesn't even exist any more; see http://searchengineland.com/panda-strikes-yahoo-voices-yahoo-contributor-network-closing-195698}} This law differs from that of New York in various ways, including holding the vendor responsible even if it claims that the paper was not intended to be turned in for credit, if the court concludes that it should have known that it would, or if the claim is not credible. For example, while some essay mills state that their products are not intended to be submitted for credit, they may also boast of the high grades that their papers have received.

The 2011 Florida Statutes Section 877.17 states that it is a second degree [[misdemeanor]] to "sell, offer to sell, or advertise for sale" a "written, recorded, pictorial, artistic, or other assignment" to another for submission "unaltered to a substantial degree."&lt;ref name="Mocello" /&gt; In the state of Florida, second degree misdemeanors are punishable by up to sixty days in prison.

==Criticism and controversy==
The [[academic community]] has criticized essay mill companies for helping students to commit academic fraud.

Some essay mills have defended themselves against criticism by claiming that they are selling pre-written examples which students can use as guidelines and models for the student's own work. In 2002, a UK-based essay mill called Elizabeth Hall Associates required students purchasing essays to sign a disclaimer stating that "any material provided by Elizabeth Hall Associates [is] on the understanding that it is a guidance model only."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Major|first=Lee Elliot |title=Web of Deceit |url= https://www.theguardian.com/education/2002/jan/08/highereducation.students |accessdate=May 15, 2014 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=8 January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other essay mills claim that they are "scholarly publishing houses" that provide students with essays that the student can then cite in the student's own work.

Students from different academic backgrounds have used essay mills.  Many prestigious universities and colleges have caught their students turning in papers they bought from essay mills.&lt;ref name="Bartlett" /&gt;  The University of California, San Diego caught 600 students cheating in one year.  One of the forms of cheating was turning in papers bought from essay mills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Ruff|first1=Bob|last2=Costello|first2=Carol |title=Educating America: Cheating on Papers is a Booming Web Business |work=American Morning Blogs |publisher=CNN |url= http://am.blogs.cnn.com/2009/12/30/cheating-on-papers-is-a-booming-web-business |ps=&lt;!--This is an official CNN blog, subject to editorial control, not a primary source.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using term paper mills brings up some ethical controversies.  Some people view essay mills as unethical while others view it as completely moral.  People view essay mills as [[ethical]] for different reasons.  Some customers indicate that they use essay mills as a form of proof reading.  Essay mill writers will read their writing only to make comments and feedback about content and grammar mistakes.  They also turn to essay mills to insure that all citations are correct.&lt;ref name="Bartlett" /&gt;  Some customers claim that they turn to essay mills because society has put too much pressure on students to achieve academic success. GPAs and grades are greatly stressed in schools which causes students to worry and make them feel like they cannot meet their deadlines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Ethics in Computing |website=ethics.csc.ncsu.edu |publisher=North Carolina State University |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |url= http://ethics.csc.ncsu.edu/commerce/termpapers/study.php |accessdate=August 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to get the paper handed in on time, students seek out term paper mills.  Essay mills have been compared to business situations.  Certain students and customers view term paper mills as equivalent to companies outsourcing labor.  [[Outsourcing]] labor is a norm for businesses which insinuates that the use of term paper mills should be socially acceptable.&lt;ref name="Bartlett" /&gt;

Conversely, there are people who view purchasing essays from essay mills as unethical: it is a form of cheating and plagiarism because one person is taking credit of another individual’s work.  Academic institutions are concerned about how essay mills affect learning.  Students who use essay mills do not go through the process of gathering research, which is a learning experience in itself.  Some professors, such as Dan Ariely, a professor of psychology and behavioral economics at Duke University and the author of ''The (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty'', worry about the message term paper mills send to students.  He believes the existence of essay mills validates slacking off.  Ariely has come across essay mills use plagiarism-encouraging language on their websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Ariely |first=Dan |title=Essay Mills – A Coarse Lesson on Cheating |work=Los Angeles Times |date=June 2012 |url= http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jun/17/opinion/la-oe-ariely-cheating-20120617}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students generally know that using essay mill services is not right; according to a study conducted Patrick Scanlon and David Neumann, 90% of students surveyed admitted that the practice is unethical. However, the same study showed that students believe around 20% of their peers frequently use these online services.&lt;ref name="Scanlon &amp; Neumann"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scanlon|first1=Patrick |last2=Neumann|first2=David |title=Internet Plagiarism among College Students |journal=Journal of College Student Development |date=2002 |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=374–386}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many customers believe that when they are ordering an essay [[online]], that they are going to be receiving one from their own country; however, this is not always the case, as many essay mill companies are hosted around the world.&lt;ref name="Bartlett"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bartlett |first=Thomas |title=Cheating Goes Global as Essay Mills Multiply |journal=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |date=March 2009 |url= http://chronicle.com/article/Cheating-Goes-Global-as-Essay/32817/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only are many of the essay mill companies hosted overseas, but many of the writers for these companies do not have graduate degrees, and have learned English as their second language.&lt;ref name="Bartlett" /&gt;

Having essay mills set up overseas allows for the owners of these companies to make high profits by paying wages in low-wage countries while selling the work of their employees in high-wage countries. A 2009 article in [[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] stated that overseas writers only get paid between $1 and $3 per page out of the $20 to $30 US-customers pay per page.&lt;ref name="Bartlett" /&gt; Compared to American writers that work for essay mills, this is a very low rate. Another article in ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'' from 2010 interviewed an American essay mill writer, who stated that he makes half of what the paper sells for.&lt;ref name="Dante"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dante |first=Ed |title=The Shadow Scholar |journal=The Chronicle of Higher Education |date=November 2010 |url= http://chronicle.com/article/The-Shadow-Scholar/125329/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even in the US, the amount that writers get paid can vary. Some American writers are only able to bring in around $1,000 per month in their highest paying months which can make some writers have to take up a second job.&lt;ref name="Bartlett" /&gt; Other American writers are more successful when working for essay mills. Some of the better writers are able to make up to $5,000 per month.&lt;ref name="Dante" /&gt;

==Strategies for combating academic fraud==
Universities and colleges have developed several strategies to combat this type of [[academic misconduct]]. Some professors require students to submit electronic versions of their term papers, so that the text of the essay can be compared by anti-plagiarism software (such as [[Turnitin]]) against databases of known "essay mill" term papers.

Other universities have enacted rules allowing professors to give students [[oral examination]]s on papers which a professor believes to be ghostwritten; if the student is unfamiliar with the content of an essay that  he has submitted, or its sources, then the student can be charged with academic fraud, a violation of the rules by which a student agrees to be bound when he enters a university or college program.

When a student is charged with academic fraud, his case is typically heard by a quasi-judicial administrative committee, which reviews the evidence. For students who are found guilty, the punishments range from a grade of zero on the specific assignment, to failure in the course in which the plagiarism occurred, to (in extreme or repeated cases) suspension or expulsion from the institution. In some cases, students who have committed academic fraud may also have academic honors, degrees, or awards revoked.

The '''Fahai Temple''' ({{zh|c={{linktext|法|海|寺}}|p={{linktext|Fǎ|hǎi| Sì}}}}; {{lang|sa|धर्म समुद्र विहार}} ''{{IAST|Dharma Samudra Vihāra}}'') is [[Ming Dynasty]] [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] temple located at the foot of Cuiwei Mountain, about two kilometers to the north-east of Moshikou, [[Shijingshan District]], [[Beijing]], [[China]].

==History==
Construction of the Fahai Temple started in 1439 during the [[Ming dynasty]] and was completed in 1443.

==Frescoes==
The most distinguishing part of Fahai Temple is the Ming dynasty frescoes. The total area of the frescoes is 236.7 square meters. Comparing with other famous frescoes in China, such as the Yongle Palace frescoes and the [[Dunhuang]] frescoes, Fahai Temple's well-preserved frescoes are also notable in the depiction of figures, subtlety of patterns and the craft methods.

The '''Foundation for Contemporary Arts''' ('''FCA'''), is a nonprofit based foundation in [[New York City]] that offers financial support and recognition to contemporary performing and visual artists through awards for artistic innovation and potential.  It was established in 1963 as the Foundation for Contemporary Performance Arts by artists [[Jasper Johns]], [[John Cage]], and others.

FCA was founded on the principle of "Artists for Artists" support as visual artists united to sponsor performance artists through grants funded by the sale of donated artworks.  The first benefit exhibition was at the Allan Stone Gallery in 1963. Among contributors to the Foundation's first benefit exhibition were [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Elaine de Kooning]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]], [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], and [[Andy Warhol]].&lt;ref name=Granted2013&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/04/22/granted|title=Granted|website=The New Yorker|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its establishment, FCA has awarded more than 2,500 non-restrictive grants to individual artists and art organizations through its seven grant programs: ''Grants to Artists'', ''Emergency Grants'', the biennial ''John Cage Award'', the biennial ''Merce Cunningham Award'', the annual ''Robert Rauschenberg Award'', the annual ''Ellsworth Kelly Award'', and the annual ''Dorothea Tanning Award''.

FCA is located at 820 [[Greenwich Street]] in the [[West Village]] neighborhood of New York City.

== History ==
In late 1962, [[John Cage]], [[Jasper Johns]], and [[Robert Rauschenberg]] wanted to help [[Merce Cunningham Dance Company]] finance a season on Broadway. Each donated an artwork to be sold to cover the loss that would be incurred but realized that the sales might generate a bit more than would be needed. Asked what should happen to the excess, Cunningham remarked that other performers "are in the same boat" and should be helped.&lt;ref name=Granted2013 /&gt; Cage and Johns expanded the idea by establishing the Foundation for Contemporary Performance Arts.  They invited other artists to contribute works to an exhibition at the Allan Stone Gallery, which opened February 25, 1963 — and firmly established the Foundation's roots in the community of artists.&lt;ref name=Artists1963&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1963/03/09/artists-for-artists|title=Artists for Artists|website=The New Yorker|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lee Bontecou]], [[Elaine de Kooning]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Alex Katz]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]], Marisol, [[Barnett Newman]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[James Rosenquist]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Elaine Sturtevant]], and [[Andy Warhol]] were among the sixty-seven artists who contributed to this landmark show. With proceeds from the exhibition, the Foundation began making grants to individual artists.&lt;ref name=aboutpage&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foundationforcontemporaryarts.org/about|title=Foundation for Contemporary Arts|website=www.foundationforcontemporaryarts.org|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During its first year, FCA made grants to composers [[Earle Brown]] and [[Morton Feldman]] and underwrote a concert of their music presented at [[The Town Hall (New York City)|Town Hall]] in New York. Additional grants went to [[Judson Memorial Church]], the [[Paper Bag Players]], choreographers [[Trisha Brown]], [[Lucinda Childs]], [[Meredith Monk]], [[Yvonne Rainer]], and [[Twyla Tharp]]; and composers [[Philip Glass]], [[Steve Reich]], and [[La Monte Young]].&lt;ref name=aboutpage /&gt;

== Grant programs ==
=== Grants to Artists ===
Grants to Artists are unrestricted, annual $40,000 awards made to provide recipients with the financial means to engage in their choice of artistic endeavors. Recipients are selected from confidential nominations. FCA invites dozens of artists and arts professionals to anonymously propose one exceptional individual, collective, or performing group. Then, FCA’s Directors, together with an advisor in each discipline, select grantees based on the merit and imaginativeness of their work and the impact such support might have at this point in their careers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/arts-and-culture/reviews/g182/rauschenberg-foundation/?slide=2|title=Lasting Assets|date=2013-03-01|newspaper=Town &amp; Country Magazine|language=en|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emergency Grants ===
Emergency Grants are awarded on an ongoing basis to emerging artists and collectives throughout the United States who are in need of timely, urgent support. Emergency Grants provides quick, grassroots support to artists who have unexpected expenses when projects are close to completion or sudden opportunities to present work to the public.  Requests are reviewed monthly by a volunteer panel of established artists.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Emergency Grants typically ranging from $200 to $2,500.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foundationforcontemporaryarts.org/grant_programs/immediate_needs.html "Emergency Grants." Foundation for Contemporary Arts.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== John Cage Award ===
The John Cage Award is a biennial $50,000 grant made in recognition of outstanding achievements in contemporary arts.  It was established in 1992 in memory of the late composer, one of FCA’s founders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foundationforcontemporaryarts.org/grants/john-cage-award|title=Foundation for Contemporary Arts|website=www.foundationforcontemporaryarts.org|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Merce Cunningham Award ===
The Merce Cunningham Award is a biennial grant made in recognition of outstanding achievement in the arts that reflects the creativity and spirit of choreographer, [[Merce Cunningham]], an artist involved in the founding of FCA. It was established in 2015 with an endowment gift from the Merce Cunningham Trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artnews.com/2015/01/05/merce-cunningham-trust-awards-grants-to-baryshnikov-arts-center-foundation-for-contemporary-arts/|title=Merce Cunningham Trust Awards Grants to Baryshnikov Arts Center, Foundation for Contemporary Arts {{!}} ARTnews|website=www.artnews.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Robert Rauschenberg Award ===
The Robert Rauschenberg Award is an annual $40,000 grant made to a visual or performing artist in honor of Rauschenberg's legacy of innovation, risk-taking, and experimentation. It was established in 2013 with a $720,000 gift from the [[Robert Rauschenberg Foundation]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vogel|first1=Carol|title=Bronzino Painting to be Auctioned at Christie's|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/21/arts/design/bronzino-painting-to-be-auctioned-at-christies.html|accessdate=2017-02-01|work=The New York Times|issue=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ellsworth Kelly Award ===

[[File:Mungomacaroni.gif|thumb|''A Mungo Macaroni'' engraving by Matthew and Mary Darly (1772)]]
'''Julius Soubise''' (1754 – August 25, 1798) was a freed [[British African-Caribbean community|Afro-Caribbean]] [[slave]] who became a well-known [[fop]] in late eighteenth century [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]]. The satirized depiction of Soubise, ''A Mungo Macaroni'', is a relic of [[intersectionality]] between race, class, and gender in eighteenth century London. His life of luxury as a free man of color allowed him to excel in elite activities such as fencing and made him notorious in London’s social scene as an exception to norms.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/462914558|title=Slaves to fashion : black dandyism and the styling of black diasporic identity|last=1970-|first=Miller, Monica L.,|date=2009|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=9780822391517|location=Durham|oclc=462914558}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was renamed after a French duke, [[Charles, Prince of Soubise|Charles de Rohan]], by the Duchess&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

In the collected letters of the famous freed slave [[Ignatius Sancho]], Letter XIIII (dated October 11, 1771) is addressed to Soubise, whom Sancho encourages to consider his lucky position as an unusually privileged black person and so live a more seemly life.&lt;ref name="LETTERS"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Letters of the Late Ignatius Sancho, an African|author=Ignatius Sancho (ed.

However, on July 15, 1777, Soubise fled Britain for [[India]].&lt;ref name="Unchained" /&gt; Historical accounts dispute whether he was sent away simply to amend his debauchery or to evade a rape accusation from a maid of the Duchess’.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Duchess died two days after his departure.

Soubise became socially prominent enough to become the subject of several caricatures. Most notably, Soubise is attributed as the muse for ''A Mungo Macaroni'' (published September 10, 1772), part of a famous 1771–1773 satirical series of engravings depicting fashionable young men, published by [[Matthew Darly|Matthew]] and [[Mary Darly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Spaces of Modernity: London's Geographies 1680–1780|author=Miles Ogborn|publisher=Guilford Press|year=1998|isbn=1-57230-365-4|page=[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1572303654&amp;id=tCp_X–AUQ6MC&amp;pg=PA134&amp;lpg=PA134&amp;ots=q7Re8y1YNt&amp;dq=%22mungo+macaroni%27&amp;sig=kFZz7PyBcHvEZXDhSOwldu8ynJk 134]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LETTERS" /&gt; The term "[[Maccaroni (fashion)|macaroni]]" was a contemporary name for a fashionable young man, a [[dandy]], while "Mungo" was a name of an officious slave from the 1769 [[comic opera]] ''[[The Padlock]]'' by [[Isaac Bickerstaffe]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/723453913|title=The Cambridge companion to British theatre, 1730-1830|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|others=Moody, Jane, 1967-2011., O'Quinn, Daniel, 1962-|isbn=9781139001656|location=Cambridge|oclc=723453913}}&lt;/ref&gt; In previous contexts, use of the term “mungo” was often aimed towards luxury slaves, an application of the character to those treated theatrically like elite’s pets. Applying the epithet to Soubise in combination with “macaroni” was intended to mock the identity he had assumed for himself.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/462914558|title=Slaves to fashion : black dandyism and the styling of black diasporic identity|last=1970-|first=Miller, Monica L.,|date=2009|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=9780822391517|location=Durham|oclc=462914558}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Austin (caricaturist)|William Austin]]'s well-known [[Satire|satirical]] print, ''The Duchess of Queensbury and Soubise'' (published May 1, 1773) shows the pair engaged in a fencing match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Reminiscences of Henry Angelo|author=Henry Angelo|publisher=Ayer Publishing|year=1972&lt;!--; first published 1904--&gt;|isbn=0-405-18118-3|page=[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0405181183&amp;id=8zeYeoVD5kQC&amp;pg=PA350&amp;lpg=PA350&amp;ots=PFJeRVu_F7&amp;dq=soubise+angelo&amp;sig=4NNzvZwHrK7hAYdB55ZXpn-6KPs#PPA350,M1 350]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hyde" /&gt;  Austin’s engraving was based on illustrations of fencing compiled by the Angelo fencing dynasty, combined with accounts of Soubise from [[Henry Charles Angelo the Younger|Henry Angelo]]’s memoir.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Charles W.

== Arts and Education ==
In his work as an actor, Soubise is suggested to have had runs in the role of [[Othello]] as well as the character Mungo from ''[[The Padlock]],'' characters historically most often played by white actors in [[blackface]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, such reports come from [[Hicky's Bengal Gazette|Hicky's Bengal Gazette,]] which could have posited this satirically to mock his Soubise's status. Soubise was strongly associated with these characters throughout his time in the elite social sphere, labeled by others because he was a black actor, punctuated by his depiction in ''A Mungo Macaroni''.

Soubise received instruction in the privileged accomplishments of riding and fencing, taught by fencing master Domenico Angelo per Duchess Douglas’ connections.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He was also known as an amateur violinist,&lt;ref name="UKNA" /&gt; singer and actor – he was taught oration by the famous actor [[David Garrick]].&lt;ref name="Hyde" /&gt;

== Fashion ==
Soubise’s styles were likened to other fops of the time, often characterized by the French influence he also granted his namesake&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2J6S9QbpxI0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=Julius%20Soubise&amp;f=false|title=The Limits of the Human: Fictions of Anomaly, Race and Gender in the Long Eighteenth Century|last=Nussbaum|first=Felicity|date=2003-05-15|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521016421|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. ''A Mungo Macaroni'' depicts Soubise sporting a luxurious hat, ruffles, a cane, and an adorned sword.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=1637545&amp;partId=1&amp;searchText=macaronis&amp;page=1|title=A Mungo Macaroni / Macaronies, Characters, Caricatures &amp;c by MDarly. [1772] (Vol.4)|website=British Museum|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was known to wear large powdered wigs, fine fabrics such as silk, and styles fitted tight to his body. There are also accounts of him wearing diamond-buckled shoes with red heels.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Such styles meant Soubise and other fops were associated with effeminacy and excess, supported by the caricatures, but Soubise also assumed a unique black identity that could be associated with extravagance.

'''''Les Soirées de Médan''''' ("Evenings at Médan") is a collection of six [[short stories]] by six different writers associated with [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalism]], first published in 1880.&lt;ref&gt;Maupassant: ''Oeuvres de Maupassant, tome 1 : Contes et nouvelles, romans'' (Robert Laffont, 1988)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/topic/Les-Soirees-de-Medan Britannica.com]&lt;/ref&gt; All the stories concern the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. The contents of the book are as follows:

*''L'Attaque du moulin'' ("The Attack on the Mill") by [[Émile Zola]]
*''[[Boule de Suif]]'' ("Ball of Tallow") by [[Guy de Maupassant]]
*''Sac au dos'' ("Backpack") by [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]]
*''La Saignée'' ("Bloodshed") by [[Henri Céard]]
*''L'Affaire du Grand 7'' ("The Affair of the Great 7") by [[Léon Hennique]]
*''Après la bataille'' ("After the Battle") by [[Paul Alexis]]

The collection took its title from Zola's house at [[Médan]], near [[Paris]], where writers would meet for literary dinners. The authors were often referred to collectively as the "Médan group". The aim of the collection was to promote the ideals of Naturalism, by treating the events of the Franco-Prussian War in a realistic and often unheroic way, in contrast to officially approved patriotic views of the war.

By far the most famous story in the collection is ''[[Boule de Suif]]'', which immediately launched the career of the young [[Guy de Maupassant]].

Zola's story became the basis for an [[L'attaque du moulin|opera of the same name]] by [[Alfred Bruneau]].

This is a list of the [[:Category:Penthouse Pets|model]]s who have appeared in the American edition of ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'' magazine and were either named '''Pet of the Month''' or '''Pet of the Year''' from September 1969 to present.&lt;ref name=official&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.PenthouseMagazine.com |title=''Penthouse'' magazine Official site, Penthouse Pets|publisher=PenthouseMagazine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.penthouse.com |title=Penthouse|publisher=Penthouse.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Pets of the Year''' names are in '''bold''' type and are typically featured in the January issue of the year for which they are selected. Unlike ''[[Playboy]]'', it may be several years before a model becomes "Pet of the Year" after their initial [[centerfold]]. No model was selected in 1985.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13254">'''Martin Foss''' (1889–1968) was a German-born American philosopher, professor, and scholar.

==Life and career==
'''Martin Foss''' was born in [[Berlin]], [[Imperial Germany|Germany]], in 1889 and studied philosophy and law at German and French universities. He married Hilde Schindler, and they had two children, Oliver Foss, a painter, and the composer [[Lukas Foss]]. The Jewish family left Germany in 1933 when [[Adolf Hitler]] came into power, and for the next four years Martin Fuchs commuted secretly between [[Paris]] and Berlin. With the help of the [[Quaker]] community in the [[United States]], the family was able to immigrate to the U.S. in 1937. The Quakers provided initial shelter for the family and advised Martin to change the family name from Fuchs to Foss. (It is unknown why the name was not changed to Fox, which is what "Fuchs" means.) Martin subsequently became an American citizen. He taught philosophy at [[Haverford College]], where he retired as [[professor emeritus]], as well as at [[Temple University]].&lt;ref name="Axinn"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Axinn|first1=Sidney|title=Sacrifice and Value: A Kantian Interpretation|date=October 2010|publisher=Lexington Books|location=Lanham. MD|isbn=9780739140536|pages=ix|url=https://rowman.com/isbn/0739140558|accessdate=21 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died of a heart attack at the age of 79, while he was running to catch a plane at [[Heathrow Airport]].

Martin Foss taught and wrote during a time when [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] dominated and influenced many thinkers, such as [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Ortega y Gasset]], and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. [[Existentialism]] was also popular, but his view of existence was based more on the views of [[Medieval]] thinkers such as [[Cusanus]]. Foss was considered to be an [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] philosopher. He was a student of [[Max Scheler]], whose works had a significant influence on his ideas about ethics, value and love.

Martin Foss's book, ''Symbol and Metaphor in Human Experience'', was listed as one of the “Most Neglected Books of the Past 25 Years” by ''The American Scholar'' in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://neglectedbooks.com/?page_id=50 |title=The Neglected Books Page » American Scholar 1956 |publisher=[[The Neglected Books Page]] |date=1998-08-28 |accessdate=2011-06-27}} The American Scholar Journal, 1956. Publisher: Phi Beta Kappa Society.&lt;/ref&gt; Other writers have cited his work as being "far-reaching," "seminal," and "ahead of its time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FSg3S7sETawC&amp;pg=PA22 |title=Myth and Symbol: Critical Approaches and Applications |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |year= 1963|accessdate=2011-06-27|first=N.|last=Frye |author2=Knights, L. |location=Lincoln, Nebraska|display-authors=etal|isbn=0803250657 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the academic treatise, ''The Faces of Reason: An Essay on Philosophy and Culture in English Canada, 1850-1950'', authors Leslie Armour and Elizabeth Trott state that Martin Foss may be considered a greater philosopher than Martin Heidegger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IVYNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA15 |title=The Faces of Reason: An Essay on Philosophy and Culture in English Canada  |publisher=Wilfrid Laurier University Press |year= 1981|accessdate=2011-06-27|first=L. |last=Armour|author2=Trott, E.|location = Waterloo, Ontario, Canada|isbn=9780889201071  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Martin Heidegger]] has clearly had far greater recognition and impact, Martin Foss's work deserves renewed attention.

==Professor Martin Foss==
Professor Foss was highly regarded by his Haverford College students as written in their class of 1948 yearbook dedication:&lt;ref&gt;Haverford College - The 1948 Record (Yearbook) https://archive.org/details/recordofclass1948have/&lt;/ref&gt;

"Soon after his arrival on the Haverford campus, Dr. Martin Foss impressed his unique personality on the students who were lucky enough or foresighted enough to take one of his courses. In his own inimitable manner, Dr. Foss graphically developed the neophytes into thinking students. By driving home his points with emotional style so characteristic of him and him alone. Dr. Foss instilled a love of his subject into all of us who studied under him. No other professor in recent memory has so often been imitated in campus skits with such friendly satire. Dr. Foss' own brand of "Phil-Foss-ophy" has, of necessity, been responsible for such well-known phrases as "Yes, my dear, but you see..." and "the stream of life, the flux". Standing fast to his views on any particular subject Dr. Foss will fall back on his two favorite philosophers, Kant and Aristotle, to back him up. A man with such deep scholarly convictions and great love for his chosen profession could not help but make a profound impression on the students of Haverford, and it is with the deepest gratitude and respect that we dedicate the 1948 RECORD to Martin Foss, teacher, scholar, and friend."

==Philosophy==
Martin Foss’s work deals with the “large” issues of life—love, death, and creative rebirth. His writings on [[art]] and [[creative process]] are particularly noteworthy, offering a missing perspective in that genre. His texts reach far beyond [[philosophy]], and have been used in academic [[depth psychology]], [[theology]], and art programs, as well as philosophy programs.

Foss's perspective on Greek [[tragedy]] is important and unprecedented. His views on tragedy as religious drama give new meaning to the word "[[religion]]."

===Culture, meaning and destiny===
In his seminal book ''Symbol and Metaphor In Human Experience,'' for which he is primarily known, Foss explains the difference between the Self as a maker of things and the creative process of personality. The germ of this distinction is developed as well in another of his books, ''Death, Sacrifice, and Tragedy'', which explores in more detail the meanings of Greek and [[Shakespearean]] tragedies. In Foss’s view, the significance of Greek tragedy involves the discovery of the "creative and dynamic personality and man's sacrificial and intercessional nature."

He writes: ''"life in its core is a perpetual conversion from a lower sphere to a higher one, destroying the lower for the sake of realizing the higher, and this creative destruction, the sacrificial action, conveys to life its essential character, which is sacramental."''

The theme of death, sacrifice, and tragedy is the basis for his view of [[ethics]] which supplants the modern [[humanism|humanist]] perspective that is limited to pragmatic man using his environment solely for fulfilling the needs and desires of the body. This use of the environment for practical expediency is a sphere which man and the animal have in common. It is the world of order and the making of things for their various uses. But beyond the physical world, Foss argues that man is a citizen of another world as well, a world that is hidden but disclosed. This world is the sphere of value "where no things, no accomplishments, no possessions as such count, but where works and achievements manifest a loving communion and nothing else." In Foss’s view, the purpose of human life is to serve this spiritual, transcendent world which rises before man as the meaning and destiny of his life. Through sacrifice and the creative process of personality, man is lifted into this world of intensive reality which shapes his destiny.

Foss contrasts this concept of creation with the commonly accepted ethic of [[utilitarianism]] that is prevalent in modern societies. He writes that an ethics of utilitarianism enables a "rational organization of a collective ritual of law," and he defines rituals of law as symbolic reductions that are finite and relative (i.e., not the source of absolute ethical values). Stuck in this deficient sphere, man desires a more meaningful life, which involves seeking the higher realm of creation. Foss refers to this choice as "man under destiny." It is not an easy way of living, since one must accept the [[sacrament]]al nature of life and the communion of Love as the source of one's direction in life.

=== Consciousness ===
While other great thinkers in the early 20th century such as [[Carl Jung]] and [[Sigmund Freud]] concentrated their research on defining the human unconscious, Martin Foss took on its natural counterpoint, consciousness. The main premise of consciousness was that it wasn’t a static object of humanity comprehendible only by philosophers and theologians.  Consciousness is a process whose partner is life. Foss wrote “we are here in a realm where consciousness has not an object, not a content detached from itself, but is aware merely of its own drive and destiny”.&lt;ref&gt;Foss, Martin. (1949). Symbol and Metaphor in Human Experience. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Consciousness contains all the potential of human existence.  “Consciousness is real, is being; it may be potential being, but even as potential it is in a process of realization in which no distinction can be made between that which is but could also not be (matter or mere possibility) and that which essentially and necessarily is (form)”.  By attaching the conditionality of potential to his definition of consciousness, Foss essentially said that human beings have no limitations on what they can be, perceive, and create.  An idea existing only in the mind is as real as what is perceived via the physical senses.

===Martin Foss and other philosophers===
Foss's work diverges in important ways from that of [[Carl Jung]]. Both scholars were writing in parallel (during the same period of time) about similar concepts, although Foss highlights the creative process as the central element of life in a way that Jung does not. Jung's definition of the [[symbol]] is very different from Foss's. In Jung's view, a symbol has great meaning, deriving from the [[collective unconscious]]. Contrary to Jung, Foss uses the term "symbol" to refer to that which is man-made and static (Jung uses the term "sign" to denote something static). Foss uses the term "[[metaphor]]" to denote the universal creative process that underlies human life and consciousness. In Foss's view, the metaphoric process of life is a continuous, ongoing creative force that is always working to "move beyond" (and destroy) the static state of the symbol. The metaphoric wants to create anew. One might compare Jung's concept of the "collective unconscious" to Foss's concept of the metaphoric, but again, Jung makes no real acknowledgement of life as an ongoing creative process in the way that Foss does. Foss provides a fascinating and important theory for how change happens in life—a theory that has been unmatched by no other philosopher. Perhaps one reason that their work was not referenced by the other, is because Jung was writing in the field of psychology, while Foss was a philosopher.

His writings can also be compared with the writings of Martin Heidegger and [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]], both of whom are well known for their views on [[process philosophy]] which describes the universe as a process, rather than a fixed state.

'''Milton Resnick''' (1917-2004) was an American artist noted for abstract paintings that coupled scale with density of incident. It was not uncommon for some of the largest paintings to weigh in excess three hundred pounds, almost all of it pigment.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Ellen Abell, Phd. Chair, Department of Visual Arts, Dowling College. Essay, "Milton Resnick: Living a Second Life in Art," appearing in 2006 in the catalog "Milton Resnick: The Life of Paint," published by the Anthony Giordano Gallery, Dowling College, Oakdale, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; He had a long and varied career, lasting about sixty-five years. He produced at least eight hundred canvases and eight thousand works on paper and board.&lt;ref&gt;As of 2016, the Milton Resnick and Pat Passlof Foundation owns 8003 paintings on board and paper, and 402 on canvas, only forty of which are dated before 1980. The rest are in public and private collections—Geoffrey Dorfman, Trustee, Milton Resnick and Pat Passlof Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt;

He also wrote poetry on a nearly daily basis for the last thirty years of his life. He was an inveterate reader, riveting speaker and gifted teller of tales, capable of conversing with college audiences in sessions that might last three hours.

During his lifetime he was represented by the following galleries: Poindexter Gallery, Howard Wise Gallery, Max Hutchinson, and [[Robert Miller (art dealer)|Robert Miller]].
  
Paintings held in public collections include: ''New Bride'', 1963 [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]], Washington, D.C., ''Mound'', 1961 [[National Gallery of Art]], Washington, D.C., ''Saturn'', 1976 [[National Gallery of Canada]], Ottawa, Ontario, ''Elephant'', 1977 Milton Resnick and Pat Passlof Foundation, New York, ''Earth'', 1976 [[Museum of Modern Art]], NYC, ''Wedding'', 1962 [[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York, ''Pink Fire'', 1971 [[National Gallery of Australia]], Canberra, and ''Untitled'', 1982 [[Whitney Museum of American Art]], New York, along with many pictures of comparable quality in smaller collections — public and private — make for some, an effective case for Resnick as an exponent of the sublime.

His remaining estate is held in trust by the Milton Resnick and Pat Passlof Foundation. Beginning in 2017, the centenary of his birth, the Foundation plans to open his former residence and studio, at 87 Eldridge Street in Manhattan as a public exhibition space to showcase his work, that of his wife Pat Passlof, and other [[Abstract Expressionist]] painters.

Milton Resnick's estate is represented by Cheim &amp; Read, New York.

== Childhood ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2016}}
Milton Resnick was born of Jewish parentage in the village of [[Bratslav]], now in the Ukraine. His given name was Rachmiel.&lt;ref&gt;{{wikicite|reference=Oral Interview conducted 7/13/88 by Cynthia Nadelman for the Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, Washington DC. (part one, page 4).|ref=nadleman1988-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both his parents came from wealthy families: the Resnicks builders and the Mutchniks flour merchants. In the immediate aftermath of the Russian Revolution, Bratslav was repeatedly terrorized by Cossack gangs and the town—like so many others—decimated. Under duress, Resnick's father abandoned his business and property, and emigrated along with his wife's family to America in 1922. They settled in Brooklyn where Milton Resnick lived for the next ten years.

Disobeying his father, the boy left home at seventeen to become an artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nadleman|1988-07-13|ref=nadleman1988-07-13}}, part one, pages 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to survive he sold his blood, modeled, and worked at the [[American Artists School]], 131 West 14th Street, as the elevator boy, in exchange for tuition. In 1938 Resnick met [[Willem de Kooning]], likely introduced to him by his sweetheart, [[Elaine de Kooning|Elaine Fried]]. She married de Kooning in 1943. Resnick was enrolled in the [[Federal Art Project]] of the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] in 1939. He became immersed in the art world after meeting many of the artists at Stewart's cafeteria, where they would congregate after collecting their WPA checks. Drafted into the army in 1940, he served in Iceland, Normandy, Northern Europe and the Rhineland. In 1945 at the age of twenty-eight, Resnick was finally discharged from the armed forces. Willem De Kooning, a faithful friend, had stored some of his art for that period. The rest was lost.

== Early Years: Abstract Expressionism ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2016}}
Resnick spent two years painting in Paris (August 1946 – 1948). His studio, at 21 Rue de Seine, was fortuitously located for engaging post-war French art. There he befriended the artist [[Wols]], who lived next door. He also met Giacometti, Gruber, as well as dealers Katia Granoff and Pierre Loeb. He observed Artaud, Matisse, Picasso, and Derain at close range, and spent an afternoon with Brancusi in his studio. John Graham visited him there several times.&lt;ref&gt;Oral Interview conducted  7/20/88 by Cynthia Nadelman for the Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, Washington DC., (part two, pgs. 14-16, and pg. 26). "Out Of the Picture: Milton Resnick and the New York School," by Geoffrey Dorfman, Midmarch Arts Press, 2003, Interview with the artist, page 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Resnick was one of the founding members of the artist's club, known simply as 'The Club,' in 1949. It became known as the den of what was later to be called the Abstract Expressionists. Other founding members included [[Franz Kline]], Willem de Kooning, [[Ad Reinhardt]], and [[Jack Tworkov]]. The Club became famous, a venue for intellectuals and luminaries like [[Dylan Thomas]], [[Hannah Arendt]], [[John Cage]], [[Joseph Campbell]], [[Buckminster Fuller]], [[Paul Goodman]], [[William Barrett (philosopher)|William Barrett]], [[Edgar Varese]] and the young [[Pierre Boulez]]. In 1951 he participated in the [[9th Street Art Exhibition]], the first of many organized group exhibitions of Abstract Expressionism in New York City.

After a 1949 debut exhibit at [[Charles Egan Gallery]] was cancelled, due to a dispute over missing paintings, Resnick did not have a solo show until 1955. As a consequence, his reputation was compromised for several decades. Labeled a second generation Abstract Expressionist, his immersion in the Abstract Expressionist idiom directly after the war remained unacknowledged.

Resnick's public reputation increased through the late 1950s and early 1960s. With the new decade, his work, previously characterized by muscular, sometimes chunky interlocking forms that seemed to function as a byproduct of a generalized aggressive attack, began to be replaced with a less fraught, loose and dispersive handling of paint. His paintings simultaneously began to assume a massive size, the largest of which, 'Swan' (1961) reached 25 feet in length.

In 1961 he married [[Pat Passlof]], an accomplished painter and former private pupil of de Kooning. For the greater part of their forty-four year long marriage, they lived apart but nearby each other.

== Maturity ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2016}}
[[File:Milton Resnick, Night, oil on canvas.jpg|thumb|Night, oil on canvas, 93 x 104 inches, 1977]]

With the rise of [[Pop Art]] and [[Op Art|optical painting]], not to mention [[Neo-Dada]] and [[Conceptual art|Conceptualism]], Resnick withdrew somewhat from the art world. Increasingly tending his own garden, he turned inward and began to produce—in complete disregard and perhaps defiance—the dense and rigorous all-over abstractions that would make his reputation.&lt;ref&gt;"Milton Resnick: Paintings 1945 &amp;ndash; 1985," published by Contemporary Arts Museum, Houston, Texas, Essay by Linda L. Cathcart, page 10.&lt;/ref&gt; An indefatigable worker, these paintings often took months to accomplish before they were realized to his satisfaction.

In 1971 he was awarded a large scale exhibition featuring paintings from 1958 to 1970 at the Fort Worth Art Center Museum in Texas. It traveled to the Milwaukee Art Center later that year. In 1985 the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston mounted a retrospective exhibition. He also taught during these years, serving in a visiting capacity at several universities, but never joined any faculty.

In 1976 he bought a synagogue on the lower East Side of Manhattan—an earlier one being turned over to his wife—and lived and worked in it until his death in 2004.

== Later life ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2016}}
In the 1980s along with many canvases, he painted more than one hundred and forty small abstractions on stiff planks of cardboard.&lt;ref&gt;As of 1016, one hundred and twenty six of these boards still reside with the Milton Resnick and Pat Passlof Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986 he started to introduce into his pictures proto-human figures often in a cruciform or slingshot gestalt, and nearly interchangeable with his sign for a tree. They remained largely abstract in feeling and tone. No inviting space beckons the viewer nor compromises the quite distinctive agitation of the surface that, along with a preference for mineralized color, characterizes much of Resnick's work for the last forty years of his life.

He also painted numerous strange hermetic insignia's. The X, a sign of negation, frequently decomposed into two elbows that often didn't align properly.  The attitude towards symmetry and order remained light-heartedly derisive. He always maintained that ideas and narratives were just grist for his mill; nothing more. Content had no significance to him other than to provide an occasion to paint. He didn't generate ideas but made use of them as a subject if it pleased him to.&lt;ref&gt;Oral Interview conducted 10/11/88 by Cynthia Nadelman for the Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, Washington DC (part three, pgs, 26, 31).&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the late work was painted on rag or mold made paper, often with acrylic or gouache. His written poetry became increasingly important to him in the last ten years of his life.

Milton Resnick took his life in March 2004.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11341">'''Minus Space''' is an art gallery located in [[Dumbo, Brooklyn]], NY. It specializes in [[abstract art]] and [[reductive art]].

==History==
Minus Space began as an online [[curator]]ial and critical project presenting reductive and [[conceptual art|concept based art]]. Reductive art includes [[geometric abstraction]], artwork that deals with repetition, [[monochrome painting|monochrome]] or limited color, [[serial art|seriality]].&lt;ref name=brennan&gt;''Neighborhood Beat'': Profile on Minus Space &amp; Michael Brennan, BCAT / Brooklyn Community Access Television, January 25, February 14, February 19, and February 23, 2007, Episode 31&lt;/ref&gt; and [[minimalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Kalm, James. "A Boom Grows in Brooklyn", ''The Brooklyn Rail'', July 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also characterized by the use of plain-spoken materials, precise craftsmanship and intellectual rigor.&lt;ref name=ps1&gt;''Minus Space: The Art of Reduction'', P.S. 1 Newspaper, Fall / Winter 2008, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
It was launched as an online curatorial project in August 2003 by Brooklyn [[artist]]s Matthew Deleget and Rossana Martinez, and gradually developed into a showcase for dozens of artists.&lt;ref&gt;Maine, Stephen. “Dateline Brooklyn”, ''Artnet Magazine'', April 15, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; They began by putting portfolios and curating exhibitions online. Minus Space published interviews of artists, reviews and critical essays. At this point project was only online, literally ''minus space''.&lt;ref name=brennan/&gt;

Minus Space then started to produce physical exhibitions in their Brooklyn project space.&lt;ref name=brennan/&gt; These included one person shows of [[abstract painting]], [[installation art|installations]] and [[performance art]].&lt;ref name=mshome&gt;Minus Space, home page. 17 June 2008. &lt;www.minusspace.com/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In addition they began to curate exhibitions nationally and internationally at [[university|universities]], galleries, [[artist-run space]]s and nonprofit spaces located in [[Manhattan]]; [[St. Mary's City, Maryland]]; [[Sydney|Sydney, Australia]];&lt;ref name=brennan/&gt; [[Houston, Texas]];&lt;ref name=ml&gt;''Machine Learning'', exhibition catalog, The Boyden Gallery of St. Mary's College of Maryland, The Painting Center, Gallery Sonja Roesch and Minus Space, 2007. inside cover.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brussels|Brussels, Belgium]].&lt;ref name=mshome/&gt;

Minus Space opened their initial gallery space at 98 Fourth Street in Gowanus in April 2006.&lt;ref name=maine&gt;Maine, Stephen. “The Reductive Expands: Minus Space will move from 175 feet in Gowanus to a Dumbo loft”, Artcritical, September 12, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2011, they relocated to a gallery-filled building at 111 Front Street in Dumbo.&lt;ref name=maine/&gt;

[[Hyperallergic]] selected the Minus Space exhibition 'Roberta Allen: Works from the 1970s" as "Best of 2014: Top 10 Brooklyn Art Shows."&lt;ref&gt;Best of 2014: Our Top 10 Brooklyn Art Shows, Hyperallergic, December 23, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exhibitions and curatorial projects ==
In 2008, [[MoMA PS1]] exhibited ''''Minus Space – The Art of Reduction'', a survey of 54 artists from 14 countries affiliated with Minus Space. The exhibition was curated by [[Phong Bui]], [[publisher]] of the [[Brooklyn Rail]] and P.S. 1 curatorial advisor. The exhibition marked the 5th anniversary of Minus Space.&lt;ref&gt;Minus Space, home &lt;www.minusspace.com/index.htm#projectspace&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 Minus Space also curated an exhibit to ''re-present'' abstract [[shaped canvas]] paintings as new, made by Mark Dagley first shown with [[Tony Shafrazi]] Gallery 20 years earlier in 1987. Most of the exhibition of was painted in [[William S. Burroughs]] Bunker in the [[Bowery]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;''Mark Dagley'', exhibition catalog, Minus Space, Abaton Book Company, 2008. p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

They curated a traveling exhibition ''[[Machine Learning]]'' which was shown at the Boyden Gallery of [[St. Mary's College of Maryland]], The Painting Center in New York City, Gallery Sonja Roesch in Houston, TX in 2007 and 2008.&lt;ref name=ml/&gt;  The title of the exhibition was inspired by a subfield of [[artificial intelligence]] concerned with the design and development of [[algorithms]] that allow computers to ''learn''. Machine learning algorithms recognize patterns within massive sets of data. Real world applications include the [[internet]] [[Web search engine|search engine]]. This exhibition examined new pattern painting in the information age.&lt;ref&gt;''Machine Learning'', p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Minus Space organized the group exhibition, Escape from New York, which originated at Sydney Non Objective, [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], in 2007, later traveled to [[Curtin University]] in [[Perth]] in 2008, Project Space Spare Room, [[RMIT University]] in Melbourne in 2009, and then to The Engine Room, [[Massey University]], [[Wellington, New Zealand]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;SNO. &lt;www.sno.org.au/s/SNO_30_catalog.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Minus Space exhibited [[album covers]] designed by [[Josef Albers]] along with ephemera and documentation from the Josef and Anni Albers Foundation demonstrating the record jackets as firsthand projects in abstract [[applied art]].&lt;ref&gt;Masheck, Joseph. “Albers’ Record Jackets: Doing an Artful Job”, The Brooklyn Rail, December 2009/January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Minus Space exhibited a collection of vintage issues of [[Life (magazine)]] representing the magazine’s historical coverage of modern art, including the 1949 article, “[[Jackson Pollock]]: Is he the greatest living painter in the United States?,” alongside works by the artist [[Loren Munk]] addressing both the history of [[New York School (art)]] and the field of [[art criticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Panero, James. “Gallery Chronicle,” The New Criterion, January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Minus Space organized, in collaboration with artist John Zinsser, a large survey exhibition examining the history and legacy of gallerist Julian Pretto (1945-1995) and his downtown New York galleries, active during the mid-1970s through the mid-1990s. The exhibition featured the work of more than 40 national and international artists in an array of different media, including painting, drawing, sculpture, installation, video, and poetry. &lt;ref&gt; Russeth, Andrew. "Julian Pretto Gallery at Minus Space," Gallerist / The New York Observer, October 1, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Museum Planning Area''' is a [[Planning Areas of Singapore|planning area]] located in the [[Central Area, Singapore|Central Area]] of the [[Central Region, Singapore|Central Region]] of [[Singapore]]. The area plays a "bridging role" between the [[Orchard Road|Orchard]] area and the [[Downtown Core]], which necessitates proper transport networks for vehicles, pedestrians and public transport. Due to the sheer size of green areas in the district, the [[Urban Redevelopment Authority]] (URA) has designated it a 'green lung' in the Central Area. However, the Museum Planning Area is also home to cultural and commercial activities. Around 65% of the area is available for future development, making it a hotbed for new infrastructure and buildings.

Museum planning area is bounded by the planning areas of [[Newton, Singapore|Newton]] and [[Rochor]] to the north, the [[Downtown Core]] to the southeast, [[Singapore River]] to the south, [[River Valley, Singapore|River Valley]] to the west and [[Orchard, Singapore|Orchard]] to the northwest.

==History==
{{see|History of Singapore}}
Ten [[National Monuments of Singapore|national monuments]] are located within the Museum Planning Area, namely the [[Armenian Church, Singapore|Armenian Church]], the [[Cathedral of the Good Shepherd]], [[Cathay Building]] (now [[The Cathay]]), the [[Central Fire Station, Singapore|Central Fire Station]], the [[House of Tan Yeok Nee]], the [[MacDonald House]], the [[Old Tao Nan School]] ([[Peranakan Museum]]), the [[National Museum of Singapore]], the [[Old Hill Street Police Station]] and the [[Singapore Art Museum]]/[[Former Saint Joseph's Institution]]. The area is home to significant events such as the [[Battle of Singapore]] and [[MacDonald House bombing]]. Other historical sites include:

*[[YMCA Building (Singapore)|YMCA Building]]
*[[National Theatre (Singapore)|National Theatre]]
*[[United Chinese Library]]

==Geography==
{{see|Geography of Singapore}}
The Museum Planning Area is bordered by [[Rochor]] to the northeast, the [[Downtown Core]] to the southeast, the [[Singapore River Planning Area|Singapore River Area]] to the southwest, [[River Valley, Singapore|River Valley]] to the west and [[Newton, Singapore|Newton]] and [[Orchard Road|Orchard]] to the northwest. The area is roughly bounded by [[Hill Street, Singapore|Hill Street]], [[River Valley, Singapore|River Valley Road]], [[Clemenceau Avenue]] and [[Bras Basah Road]]. It is the smallest urban planning area, with an area of 83 hectares. 

Parks and [[Public space|open space]]s take up a third of the area of the Museum Planning Area, and include [[Fort Canning]], [[Istana Park]] and [[Bras Basah Park]], which can be used for [[recreation]]al purposes. Collectively, these places will form the so-called 'green lung' of the Central Area. [[Terrace (building)|Terraces]] have been proposed to allow for "a more prominent and convenient access" to the Fort Canning area.

==Institutions==
The Museum Planning Area is Singapore's "[[institution]]al hub", with 11% of land set aside for institutional use and reserve sites to be safeguarded for future institutions. The many museums in the area, which give the Museum District its name, include the [[National Museum of Singapore]], the [[Singapore Art Museum]], the [[Asian Civilisations Museum]], the [[National Archives of Singapore]] and the [[Singapore Philatelic Museum]].

The [[Art in Singapore|arts scene]] is vibrant in the area, with [[The Substation]], the [[Singapore Calligraphy Centre]], the [[YMS Arts Centre]] and the [[Singapore Dance Ensemble]] all located within its boundaries. Scattered throughout the area are [[place of worship|places of worship]] such as churches, mosques, [[Hindu temple]]s and synagogues. The [[Registry of Marriages]] and the sprawling [[Singapore Management University]] campus are also located in the area.

==Residential development==
Despite its prime location, [[Residential area|residential]] projects were only allocated 1% of the land area, and the Museum Planning Area was criticised for lacking residential zoning. Due to the lack of residents, there were fears that the area would become a "[[ghost town]]" at night. Furthermore, the concept of living within the Central Area had gained popularity, and up-market skyscraper [[condominium]]s could be built. The greenery of the Museum Planning Area could provide a peaceful environment for living. 

The URA replied that several plots of land had been sold for residential-commercial mixed use, and that more housing developments were to be planned and constructed. The URA emphasised the importance of the area as a transition between the central business district and shopping areas, as well as the green, pedestrian-friendly nature of the URA's plan for the area.

==Commercial development==
The Museum Planning Area is home to various shopping malls, including [[Park Mall (Singapore)|Park Mall]], [[Plaza Singapura]], [[The Cathay]], [[Singapore Shopping Centre]] and [[The Atrium @ Orchard]]. More vacant land will be set aside for commercial uses, especially around [[Dhoby Ghaut MRT Station]] and [[Bras Basah MRT Station]]. These will be properly integrated and connected with the respective stations.

Hotels in the area include [[Bayview Hotel Singapore]] and [[Hotel Rendezvous]]. Furthermore, a hotel development at the foot of Fort Canning Hill near the junction of [[Clemenceau Avenue]] and [[River Valley, Singapore|River Valley Road]] is in the planning stages, and is meant to be a retreat from urban living "amidst lush greenery". Other developments are planned on reserved sites near Fort Canning, but details have not been released.

==Transport==
[[Image:CC2BrasBasah.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Bras Basah MRT Station]] ]]
{{see|Transport in Singapore}}

The Museum Planning Area is served by four [[Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)|Mass Rapid Transit]] (MRT) Stations: [[Dhoby Ghaut MRT Station|Dhoby Ghaut]], [[Bras Basah MRT Station|Bras Basah]], [[Fort Canning MRT Station|Fort Canning]] and [[Bencoolen MRT Station|Bencoolen]] The [[North South MRT Line|North South Line]] and the [[North East MRT Line|North East Line]] can only be accessible from Dhoby Ghaut while the [[Circle MRT Line|Circle Line]] can be accessible from both and the [[Downtown MRT Line|Downtown Line]] can be accessible from Fort Canning and Bencoolen. The [[Central Expressway, Singapore|Central Expressway's]] [[Chin Swee Tunnel]] also passes under the area. 

===Roads===
====Improvements====
Several changes to the road network in the area will be implemented, including the construction of [[Fort Canning Tunnel]] and the realignment of [[Stamford Road]] and [[Handy Road]]. The rationale for the improvements is increased traffic from [[Marina Centre]] and relieving the [[traffic congestion]] along [[Orchard Road]]. Furthermore, a new road network has been put in place to ensure smooth traffic flow after the full development of land around the MRT Stations.

====Major roads====
*[[Armenian Street, Singapore|Armenian Street]]
*[[Bras Basah Road]]
*[[Central Expressway, Singapore|Central Expressway]]
*[[Clemenceau Avenue]]
*[[Fort Canning Tunnel]]
*[[Hill Street, Singapore|Hill Street]]
*[[Orchard Road]]
*[[Queen Street, Singapore|Queen Street]]
*[[River Valley, Singapore|River Valley Road]]
*[[Stamford Road]]
*[[Victoria Street, Singapore|Victoria Street]]

===Pedestrian linkages===
The [[Development Guide Plan]] for the Museum Planning Area envisages "a comprehensive pedestrian network linking developments, parks and open spaces". New [[Esplanade|promenade]]s and [[pedestrian malls]] are planned for the area to enhance and connect existing [[sidewalk]]s. A web of [[Tunnel|underpasses]] and covered walkways will link [[Orchard]], the [[Singapore River]], [[Raffles City]] and [[Marina Centre]].

{{The Works of Aristotle}}
'''''On Colors''''' (Greek Περὶ χρωμάτων; Latin ''De Coloribus'') is a treatise attributed to [[Aristotle]]&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Jonathan (1984).  ''The Complete Works of Aristotle'' (2 Vols.), Princeton University Press, pp. 1219-1228 (V 1).  {{ISBN|0-691-01650-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but sometimes ascribed to [[Theophrastus]] or [[Strato of Lampsacus|Strato]]. The work outlines the theory that all [[colors]] (yellow, red, purple, green, and blue) are derived from mixtures of black and white. ''On colors'' had a pronounced impact on subsequent [[Color Theory|color theories]] and remained influential until [[Isaac Newton]]'s experiments with light refraction.

== Arts ==
In the [[performing arts]], a performance generally comprises an event in which a performer or group of performers present one or more [[Work of art|works of art]] to an [[audience]]. In instrumental music (and in drama), performance is typically described as "play".&lt;ref&gt;[[Andreas Dorschel]], ''Music as Play.'' In: Paulo de Assis (ed.), ''Virtual Works – Actual Things: Essays in Musical Ontology.'' Leuven University Press, Leuven 2018 (Orpheus Institute Series), pp. 115–133. [https://orpheusinstituut.be/nl/publicaties/virtual-works-actual-things/ pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt; Usually the performers participate in [[rehearsal]]s beforehand. 

An effective performance is determined by achievement skills and competency of the performer - level of skill and knowledge. Spencer and McClelland in 1994 defined competency as "a combination of motives, traits, self-concepts, attitudes, cognitive behavior skills (content knowledge)" that helps a performer to differentiate themselves superior from average performers.&lt;ref name="ShippmannAsh2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shippmann|first1=Jeffery S.|last2=Ash|first2=Ronald A.|last3=Batjtsta|first3=Mariangela|last4=Carr|first4=Linda|last5=Eyde|first5=Lorraine D.|last6=Hesketh|first6=Beryl|last7=Kehoe|first7=Jerry|last8=Pearlman|first8=Kenneth|last9=Prien|first9=Erich P.|last10=Sanchez|first10=Juan I.|title=THE PRACTICE OF COMPETENCY MODELING|journal=Personnel Psychology|volume=53|issue=3|year=2000|pages=703–740|issn=0031-5826|doi=10.1111/j.1744-6570.2000.tb00220.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; A performance may also describe the way in which an [[actor]] performs. In a solo capacity, it may also refer to a [[mime artist]], [[comedian]], [[Evocation|conjurer]], or other entertainer.

== Performance state ==

Williams and Krane found the following characteristics define an ideal performance state:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Haff , G. Gregory|author2=Triplett , N.

* Absence of [[fear]]
* Not thinking about the performance
* Adaptive focus on the activity
* A sense of effortlessness and belief in confidence or [[self-efficacy]]
* A sense of personal control
* A distortion of time and space where time does not affect the activity

Other related factors are motivation to achieve success or avoid failure, task relevant attention, positive self-talk and cognitive regulation to achieve [[automaticity]]. Performance is also dependent on adaptation of eight areas: Handling crisis, managing stress, creative problem solving, knowing necessary functional tools and skills, agile management of complex processes, interpersonal adaptability, cultural adaptability, and physical fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Frank J. Landy|author2=Jeffrey M.

Theatrical performances, especially when the audience is limited to only a few observers, can lead to significant increases in the performer's heart rate above his or her baseline heart rate. This increase takes place in several stages relative to the performance itself, including anticipatory activation (one minute before the start of subject's speaking role), confrontation activation (during the subject's speaking role, at which point their heart rate peaks) and release period (one minute after the conclusion of the subject's speech).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baldwin|first1=Sandra|title=Effect of Speakers' Sex and Size of Audience on Heart-Rate Changes During Short Impromptu Speeches|journal=Psychological Reports|date=1980|volume=46|issue=1|pages=123–130|pmid=7367532|doi=10.2466/pr0.1980.46.1.123}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same physiological reactions can be experienced in other mediums, such as instrumental performance. When experiments were conducted to determine whether there was a correlation between audience size and heart rate (an indicator of anxiety) of instrumental performers, the researcher's findings ran contrary to previous studies, showing a positive correlation rather than a negative one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Studer|first1=Regina|title=Psychophysiological Activation During Preparation, Performance, and Recovery in High- and Low-Anxious Music Students|journal=Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback|date=2014|volume=39|issue=1|pages=45–57|doi=10.1007/s10484-014-9240-2|pmid=24477850}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Radical cheerleading''' is a performative style of political activism, derived from mainstream [[cheerleading]]. Radical cheerleading combines elements of peaceful protest or [[non-violent direct action]] with theatrical elements including costuming, spectacle and choreographed dance. Radical cheerleading was created by sisters Cara, Aimee and Colleen Jennings in Miami, Florida, in 1996.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; It grew to become an international movement with squads in the United States, Canada and Europe. Radical cheerleaders create and adapt [[Cheering|cheers]] that promote [[feminism]] and [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] ideals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_nyHS4WyUKEC&amp;lpg=PT158&amp;ots=h1VYipd5FH&amp;dq=radical%20cheerleaders&amp;pg=PT158#v=onepage&amp;q=radical%20cheerleaders&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of Gender and Society|last=Grindstaff|first=Laura Anne|publisher=SAGE|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4129-0916-7|location=Los Angeles|page=126|chapter=Cheerleading: The Gender Politics of Contemporary Cheerleading}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Subculture ==
Over time, radical cheerleading developed into a subculture apart from [[cheerleading]]. To understand how radical cheerleading became a culture of its own, it is important to consider the impacts of mainstream cheerleading.

Mainstream cheerleading reached new heights of popularity in the 1990s, as it transformed from a form of entertainment to being understood as an athletic sport. The first Cheerleading World Championship took place in 2001, asserting cheerleading as a competitive sport. Still, cheerleaders were (and often still are) consistently stereotyped as unintelligent, ditzy, and promiscuous, as opposed to true athletes. Regular cheerleaders are often hypersexualized and defined by an idealized female body type. Author Christine Ro writes, "the popular image of cheerleading was still very much of the minimally dressed female cheerleader on the sidelines of a male sports event. This was the image radical cheerleaders seized upon in order to subvert gender messages while serving up peppy support for social justice causes."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bitchmedia.org/article/hey-hey-ho-ho-where-did-radical-cheerleaders-go|title=HEY HEY! HO HO! WHERE DID RADICAL CHEERLEADERS GO?|last=Ro|first=Christine|date=August 10, 2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radical cheerleaders reclaimed the identity of the cheerleader and re-shaped mainstream cheerleading to include all bodies, as opposed to certain bodies. They transformed cheerleading from a sideshow into the main event. They shifted the focus of cheerleading from sexualized spectacle to the promotion of larger ideas, like civilian empowerment and political awareness. In these ways, radical cheerleading developed into a distinct culture of its own.

== Gender non-conformity ==
Mainstream cheerleading is marked by heteronormativity.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} In contrast, gender non-conformity is a foundation upon which the subculture of radical cheerleading developed. Since its creation, radical cheerleading has been a movement open to all: participants may be male, female, [[transgender]], non-binary or non-gender identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ncXeMQUMtPgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=usJqypZj99&amp;dq=%22radical%20cheerleading%22&amp;pg=PA36#v=onepage&amp;q=%22radical%20cheerleading%22&amp;f=false|title=Cheerleader!: An American Icon|last=Adams|first=Natalie Guice|last2=Bettis|first2=Pamela|publisher=Palgrave|year=2003|isbn=978-1-4039-6184-6|location=New York|pages=36–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, radical cheerleaders subvert gender norms through costuming and aesthetics. According to author and radical cheerleader Jeanne Vaccaro, the movement was responsible for "cultivating a queer sensibility."&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The subculture’s inclusion of non-gender-conforming individuals creates a space for all bodies, which in turn creates a uniquely accepting community. This is more than just an open-door policy, but an identifying characteristic of the subculture of radical cheerleading, just as relevant to the movement as the leftist messages it asserts.

== Aesthetics ==
Radical cheerleaders reappropriate the aesthetics of cheerleading, sometimes in an ironic fashion. Radical cheerleaders dress in diverse ways. Radical cheerleading is often marked by a DIY aesthetic, with handmade costumes and props. Some radical cheerleaders make [[Pom-pom|pom-poms]] using garbage bags by folding them in half, tying off one side with a rubber band and then cutting strips from the other end. 

Every squad has a unique aesthetic of its own. The Dirty Southern Belles, from Memphis, Tennessee, wear the colors pink and black to cheer for gay pride. The Pirate Cheerleaders, a squad from Milwaukee, wear black skirts with white pleats, and shirts with pirate logos when performing at basement punk shows. The New Paltz Rads, a squad from the State University of New York at New Paltz, sport signature colors black and red.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/were-here-we-cheer-get-used-it-136589|title=We're Here!

== Notable demonstrations ==
[[File:S15 Radical Cheerleading 1.jpg|thumb]]
Radical cheerleaders often perform at political [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]], festivals and other feminist events, where they lead protest chants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aR5uGYkTj5UC&amp;lpg=PA127&amp;ots=HVwsoN399_&amp;dq=%22radical%20cheerleading%22&amp;pg=PA127#v=onepage&amp;q=%22radical%20cheerleading%22&amp;f=false|title=Alternative Media and Politics of Resistance: A Communication Perspective|last=Atkinson|first=Joshua D.|publisher=Peter Lang|year=2010|isbn=978-1-4331-0517-3|location=New York|pages=126–128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radical cheerleading is used at demonstrations to promote political messages in a media-friendly, people-friendly way. Radical cheerleaders may also perform on stage at music venues, to bring political issues (as well as entertainment) to an unsuspecting crowd. Chicago's Lickity Split radical cheerleaders frequently used this tactic.

A notable radical cheerleading appearance was at the [[March for Women's Lives]] in [[Washington, DC]] on April 25, 2004. The participants' aim was to raise awareness about the lack of access low-income women have to [[abortion]] clinics.

Another remarkable demonstration took place at a Taco Bell restaurant in Auburn, Alabama in 2001, where radical cheerleaders gathered to protest for fair wages. Dubbed the "Taco Bell Protest," participants explained to police that the purpose of their demonstration was to protest the business relationship between corporate Taco Bell and the Six L's Packing Company, Inc., a firm that pays employees low wages with zero benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/news/gimme-an-a-6323520|title=Gimme an A!|last=Roe|first=Amy|date=August 2, 2001|work=Broward Palm Beach New Times|access-date=April 2, 2016|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Taco Bell Protest serves as an encapsulating example of all that radical cheerleading stands for: peaceful (if not disruptive) demonstration, DIY construction of protest tools/props, an anti-capitalist agenda, and a demand for fair wages, a classic feminist ideal. 

Radical cheerleaders demonstrated at the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The Resistin' Radicatz, a radical cheerleading squad, performed at the 2004 Million Worker March.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Cheer content ==
Cheers are usually written from scratch or by rewriting the words of popular and historic songs. The first radical cheer book was published in 1997.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

An example of a radical cheer, led by creator Cara Jennings, performed at the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York:

{{Quote|Sound off! I don’t wanna work anymore! What did you say? I said the system doesn’t work anymore! What did you say? I said STOMP, smash the state, Let's liberate, Acknowledge me or go to hell, another womyn to rebel, let's liberate, Stomp, smash the state, let's liberate, organize and raise some hell, act up, unite and rebel!&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;}}

An example of a cheer performed by the Radical Teen Cheer Squad: "We're teens, we're cute, we're radical to boot! We're angry, we're tough, and we have had enough!"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Media ==
While the subculture has received some attention from the media, radical cheerleading receives less media attention than mainstream cheerleading.

In ''Give Me An F: Radical Cheerleading and Feminist Performance'', radical cheerleader and Author Jeanne Vaccaro describes the process of archiving radical cheerleading through the examination of cheers, zines, photographs and personal testimony from fellow radical cheerleader Mary Xmas.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/hawksites.newpaltz.edu/dist/1/2245/files/2018/01/Vaccaro_Radical-Cheerleaders-and-Feminist-Performance-289w2x9.pdf|title=Give Me an F: Radical Cheerleading and Feminist Performance|last=Vaccaro|first=Jeanne|date=January 2018|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180419120655/https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/hawksites.newpaltz.edu/dist/1/2245/files/2018/01/Vaccaro_Radical-Cheerleaders-and-Feminist-Performance-289w2x9.pdf|archive-date=April 19, 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=April 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a speech at the National Women's Studies Association in 2004, feminist magazine director [[Lisa Jervis]] placed radical cheerleading within a tradition of playful feminist comment on popular culture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In August 2004 the New York City Radical Cheerleaders completed ''Don't Let the System Get You Down—Cheer Up'', a video documentary of the Radical Cheerblock at the March for Women's Lives. The video was released in time to celebrate and honor and inspire the hundreds of radical cheerleaders who converged in New York to protest the Republican National Convention.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Responses ==
Radical cheerleading is a style of performance, and is inherently defined by the element of spectacle. Responses within the media have ranged from positive to negative. Sheila Noone, the editorial director of ''American Cheerleader'' magazine, commented that cheerleaders are involved in an "uphill battle" towards gaining respect,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; asserting that radical cheerleading makes this even more difficult. In contrast, Lauren Jack, member of Harvard University's Cheerleading squad, made the statement that cheerleading is "all about trying to get everyone else excited about your causes, so it's perfect for political activism."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Renaissance art''' is the painting, sculpture and decorative arts of the period of European history, emerging as a distinct style in Italy in about 1400, in parallel with developments which occurred in [[Renaissance philosophy|philosophy]], [[Renaissance literature|literature]], [[Renaissance music|music]], and [[Renaissance science|science]]. Renaissance art, perceived as the noblest of ancient traditions, took as its foundation the art of [[Classical antiquity]], but transformed that tradition by absorbing recent developments in the art of Northern Europe and by applying contemporary scientific knowledge. Renaissance art, with [[Renaissance Humanism|Renaissance Humanist philosophy]], spread throughout Europe, affecting both artists and their patrons with the development of new techniques and new artistic sensibilities. Renaissance art marks the transition of Europe from the medieval period to the [[Early Modern]] age.
[[File:Sandro Botticelli - La nascita di Venere - Google Art Project - edited.jpg|thumb|450px|[[Sandro Botticelli]], ''[[The Birth of Venus]]'', c. 1485. [[Uffizi]], [[Florence]]]]
In many parts of Europe, Early Renaissance art was created in parallel with [[Gothic art|Late Medieval art]].
Renaissance art, painting, sculpture, architecture, music, and literature produced during the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries in Europe under the combined influences of an increased awareness of nature, a revival of classical learning, and a more individualistic view of man. Scholars no longer believe that the Renaissance marked an abrupt break with medieval values, as is suggested by the French word renaissance, literally “rebirth.” Rather, historical sources suggest that interest in nature, humanistic learning, and individualism were already present in the late medieval period and became dominant in 15th- and 16th-century Italy concurrently with social and economic changes such as the secularization of daily life, the rise of a rational money-credit economy, and greatly increased social mobility.
The influences upon the development of Renaissance men and women in the early 15th century are those that also affected Philosophy, Literature, Architecture, Theology, Science, Government, and other aspects of society. The following list presents a summary, dealt with more fully in the main articles that are cited above.
* Classical texts, lost to European scholars for centuries, became available. These included Philosophy, Prose, Poetry, Drama, Science, a thesis on the Arts, and Early Christian Theology.
* Simultaneously, Europe gained access to advanced mathematics which had its provenance in the works of Islamic scholars.
* The advent of movable type [[printing]] in the 15th century meant that ideas could be disseminated easily, and an increasing number of books were written for a broad public.
* The establishment of the [[Medici]] Bank and the subsequent trade it generated brought unprecedented wealth to a single Italian city, [[Florence]].
* [[Cosimo de' Medici the Elder|Cosimo de' Medici]] set a new standard for patronage of the arts, not associated with the church or monarchy.
* [[Humanism|Humanist]] philosophy meant that man's relationship with humanity, the universe and with God was no longer the exclusive province of the Church.

In Italy in the late 13th and early 14th centuries, the sculpture of [[Nicola Pisano]] and his son [[Giovanni Pisano]], working at [[Pisa]], [[Siena]] and [[Pistoia]] shows markedly classicising tendencies, probably influenced by the familiarity of these artists with ancient Roman [[Sarcophagus|sarcophagi]]. Their masterpieces are the pulpits of the Baptistery and [[Pisa Cathedral|Cathedral of Pisa]]. 

Contemporary with Giovanni Pisano, the Florentine painter [[Giotto]] developed a manner of figurative painting that was unprecedentedly naturalistic, three-dimensional, lifelike and classicist, when compared with that of his contemporaries and teacher [[Cimabue]]. Giotto, whose greatest work is the cycle of the ''Life of Christ'' at the [[Arena Chapel]] in [[Padua]], was seen by the 16th century biographer [[Giorgio Vasari]] as "rescuing and restoring art" from the "crude, traditional, Byzantine style" prevalent in Italy in the 13th century.

===Early Netherlandish art, 1425–1525===
{{main article|Early Netherlandish painting}}
[[File:El Descendimiento, by Rogier van der Weyden, from Prado in Google Earth.jpg|thumb|left|[[Rogier van der Weyden]], ''[[The Descent from the Cross (Rogier van der Weyden)|The Descent from the Cross]]'' (c. 1435), oil on oak panel, {{convert|220|×|262|cm|0|abbr=on}}. [[Museo del Prado]], Madrid]]
The painters of the [[Netherlands (terminology)|Low Countries]] in this period included [[Jan van Eyck]], his brother [[Hubert van Eyck]], [[Robert Campin]], [[Hans Memling]], [[Rogier van der Weyden]] and [[Hugo van der Goes]]. Their painting developed partly independently of Early Italian Renaissance painting, and without the influence of a deliberate and conscious striving to revive antiquity. 

The style of painting grew directly out of medieval painting in [[tempera]], on panels and [[illuminated manuscript]]s, and other forms such as [[stained glass]]; the medium of [[fresco]] was less common in northern Europe.  The medium used was [[oil paint]], which had long been utilised for painting leather ceremonial shields and accoutrements, because it was flexible and relatively durable. The earliest Netherlandish oil paintings are meticulous and detailed like tempera paintings. The material lent itself to the depiction of tonal variations and texture, so facilitating the observation of nature in great detail.  

The Netherlandish painters did not approach the creation of a picture through a framework of linear perspective and correct proportion. They maintained a medieval view of hierarchical proportion and religious symbolism, while delighting in a realistic treatment of material elements, both natural and man-made. Jan van Eyck, with his brother [[Hubert van Eyck|Hubert]], painted ''[[Ghent Altarpiece|The Altarpiece of the Mystical Lamb]]''. It is probable that [[Antonello da Messina]] became familiar with Van Eyck's work, while in Naples or Sicily. In 1475, Hugo van der Goes' ''[[Portinari Altarpiece]]'' arrived in Florence where it was to have a profound influence on many painters, most immediately [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] who painted an altarpiece imitating its elements.

A very significant Netherlandish painter towards the end of the period was [[Hieronymus Bosch]], who employed the type of fanciful forms that were often utilized to decorate borders and letters in illuminated manuscripts, combining plant and animal forms with architectonic ones. When taken from the context of the illumination and peopled with humans, these forms give Bosch's paintings a surreal quality which have no parallel in the work of any other Renaissance painter. His masterpiece is the triptych ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]''.

Although both the Pisanos and Giotto had students and followers, the first truly Renaissance artists were not to emerge in Florence until 1401 with the competition to sculpt a set of [[Florence Baptistry#Lorenzo Ghiberti|bronze doors]] of the Baptistery of [[Florence Cathedral]] which drew entries from seven young sculptors including [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]], [[Donatello]] and the winner, [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]]. Brunelleschi, most famous as the architect of the dome of Florence Cathedral and the Church of San Lorenzo, created a number of sculptural works, including a lifesized Crucifix in [[Santa Maria Novella]], renowned for its naturalism. His studies of perspective are thought to have influenced the painter [[Masaccio]]. [[Donatello]] became renowned as the greatest sculptor of the Early Renaissance, his masterpieces being his Humanist and unusually erotic statue of [[David (Bible)|David]], one of the icons of the Florentine republic, and his great monument to [[Gattamelata]], the first large equestrian bronze to be created since Roman times.

The contemporary of Donatello, [[Masaccio]], was the painterly descendant of Giotto and began the Early Renaissance in Italian Painting in 1425, furthering the trend towards solidity of form and naturalism of face and gesture that Giotto had begun a century earlier.  From 1425-28, Masaccio completed several panel paintings but is best known for the fresco cycle that he began in the [[Brancacci Chapel]] with the older artist [[Masolino]] and which had profound influence on later painters, including [[Michelangelo]]. Masaccio's developments were carried forward in the paintings of [[Fra Angelico]], particularly in his frescos at the Convent of San Marco in Florence.

The treatment of the elements of perspective and light in painting was of particular concern to 15th-century Florentine painters. [[Uccello]] was so obsessed with trying to achieve an appearance of perspective that, according to Vasari, it disturbed his sleep. His solutions can be seen in his masterpiece set of three paintings, the [[Battle of San Romano]] which is believed to have been completed by 1460. [[Piero della Francesca]] made systematic and scientific studies of both light and linear perspective, the results of which can be seen in his fresco cycle of ''[[The History of the True Cross]]'' in [[San Francesco, Arezzo]].

In [[Naples]], the painter [[Antonello da Messina]] began using oil paints for portraits and religious paintings at a date that preceded other Italian painters, possibly about 1450. He carried this technique north and influenced the painters of [[Venice]]. One of the most significant painters of Northern Italy was [[Andrea Mantegna]], who decorated the interior of a room, ''the [[Camera degli Sposi]]'' for his patron [[Ludovico III Gonzaga|Ludovico Gonzaga]], setting portraits of the family and court into an illusionistic architectural space.

The end period of the Early Renaissance in Italian art is marked, like its beginning, by a particular commission that drew artists together, this time in cooperation rather than competition. [[Pope Sixtus IV]] had rebuilt the Papal Chapel, named the [[Sistine Chapel]] in his honour, and commissioned a group of artists, [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Pietro Perugino]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] and [[Cosimo Rosselli]] to decorate its wall with fresco cycles depicting ''the Life of Christ'' and ''the Life of Moses''. In the sixteen large paintings, the artists, although each working in his individual style, agreed on principals of format, and utilised the techniques of lighting, linear and atmospheric perspective, anatomy, foreshortening and characterisation that had been carried to a high point in the large Florentine studios of Ghiberti, Verrocchio, Ghirlandaio and Perugino.

===Early Renaissance in France, 1375–1528===
The artists of France, (including duchies such as [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]]) were often associated with courts, providing illuminated manuscripts and portraits for the nobility as well as devotional paintings and altarpieces.  Among the most famous were the [[Limbourg brothers]], Flemish illuminators and creators of the [[Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]]. [[Jean Fouquet]], painter of the royal court, visited Italy in 1437 and reflects the influence of Florentine painters such as [[Paolo Uccello]]. Although best known for his portraits such as that of [[Charles VII of France]] Fouquet also created illuminations, and is thought to be the inventor of the portrait miniature. There were a number of artists at this date who painted famed altarpieces, that are stylistically quite distinct from both the Italian and the Flemish. These include two enigmatic figures, [[Enguerrand Quarton]] to whom is ascribed the ''Pieta of Villeneuve-lès-Avignon'', and [[Jean Hey]], otherwise known as "the Master of Moulins" after his most famous work, ''the Moulins Altarpiece''. In these works realism and close observation of the human figure, emotions and lighting are combined with a Medieval formality, which includes gilt backgrounds.

===High Renaissance in Italy, 1495-1520===
{{main article|High Renaissance|Italian Renaissance painting}}
[[File:Creación de Adám.jpg|thumb|Michelangelo, (c. 1511) ''[[The Creation of Adam]]'', from the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]]]]
The "universal genius" [[Leonardo da Vinci]] was to further perfect the aspects of pictorial art (lighting, linear and atmospheric perspective, anatomy, foreshortening and characterisation) that had preoccupied artists of the Early Renaissance, in a lifetime of studying and meticulously recording his observations of the natural world. His adoption of oil paint as his primary media meant that he could depict light and its effects on the landscape and objects more naturally and with greater dramatic effect than had ever been done before, as demonstrated in the ''[[Mona Lisa]]''. His dissection of cadavers carried forward the understanding of skeletal and muscular anatomy, as seen in the unfinished ''St Jerome''.  His depiction of human emotion in ''The Last Supper'', completed 1495-1498, set the benchmark for religious painting.

The art of Leonardo's younger contemporary [[Michelangelo]] took a very different direction. Michelangelo, in neither his painting nor his sculpture demonstrates any interest in the observation of any natural object except the human body. He perfected his technique in depicting it, while in his early twenties, by the creation of the enormous marble statue of ''David'' and the group ''the Pieta'', in [[St Peter's Basilica]], Rome. He then set about an exploration of the expressive possibilities of the human anatomy. His commission by [[Pope Julius II]] to paint the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]] resulted in the supreme masterpiece of figurative composition, which was to have profound effect on every subsequent generation of European artists&lt;ref&gt;https://www.laetitiana.co.uk/2014/07/introduction-to-renaissance-movement.html&lt;/ref&gt;.  His later work, ''The Last Judgement'', painted on the altar wall of the Sistine Chapel between 1534 and 1541 shows a Mannerist (also called Late Renaissance) style with generally elongated bodies which took over from the High Renaissance style between 1520 and 1530.

Standing alongside Leonardo and Michelangelo as the third great painter of the High Renaissance was the younger [[Raphael]], who in a short life span painted a great number of lifelike and engaging portraits, including those of Pope Julius II and his successor [[Pope Leo X]], and numerous portrayals of the Madonna and Christ Child, including the [[Sistine Madonna]].  His death in 1520 at age 37 is considered by many art historians to be the end of the High Renaissance period, although some individual artists continued working in the High Renaissance style for many years thereafter.

In Northern Italy the High Renaissance is represented by the latter works of [[Giovanni Bellini]], especially religious paintings, which include several large altarpieces of a type known as "[[Sacred Conversation]]" which show a group of saints around the enthroned Madonna. His contemporary [[Giorgione]], who died at about the age of 32 in 1510, left a small number of enigmatic works, including ''[[The Tempest (painting)|The Tempest]]'', the subject of which has remained a matter of speculation. The earliest works of [[Titian]] date from the era of the High Renaissance, including a massive altarpiece ''[[Assumption of the Virgin (Titian)|The Assumption of the Virgin]]'' which combines human action and drama with spectacular colour and atmosphere.  Titian continued painting in a generally High Renaissance style until near the end of his career in the 1570s, although he increasingly used colour and light over line to define his figures.

===German Renaissance art===

{{main article|German Renaissance}}
German Renaissance art falls into the broader category of the Renaissance in Northern Europe, also known as the [[Northern Renaissance]]. 
Renaissance influences began to appear in German art in the 15th century, but this trend was not widespread. Gardner's ''Art Through the Ages'' identifies [[Michael Pacher]], a painter and sculptor, as the first German artist whose work begins to show Italian Renaissance influences. According to that source, Pacher's painting, ''St. Wolfgang Forces the Devil to Hold His Prayerbook'' (c.1481), is Late Gothic in style, but also shows the influence of the Italian artist, [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gardner|first1=Helen|last2=De la Croix|first2=Horst|last3=Tansey|first3=Richard G|title=Art Through the Ages|date=1975|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|location=New York|isbn=0-15-503753-6|page=555|edition=6th|ref=Gardner|chapter=The Renaissance in Northern Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Artisans, such as engravers, became more concerned with aesthetics rather than just perfecting their craft. Germany had master engravers, such as [[Martin Schongauer]], who did metal engravings in the late 1400s. Gardner relates this mastery of the graphic arts to advances in printing which occurred in Germany, and says that metal engraving began to replace the woodcut during the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gardner|first1=Helen|last2=De la Croix|first2=Horst|last3=Tansey|first3=Richard G|title=Art Through the Ages|date=1975|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|location=New York|isbn=0-15-503753-6|pages=555–556|edition=6th|ref=Gardner|chapter=The Renaissance in Northern Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some artists, such as [[Albrecht Dürer]], continued to do woodcuts. Both Gardner and Russell describe the fine quality of Dürer's woodcuts, with Russell stating, in ''The World of Dürer'', that Dürer "elevated them into high works of art."&lt;ref name="The World of Dürer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Russell|first1=Francis|title=The World of Dürer|date=1967|publisher=Time Life Books, Time Inc.|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the 1500s, Renaissance art in Germany became more common as, according to Gardner, "The art of northern Europe during the sixteenth century is characterized by a sudden awareness of the advances made by the Italian Renaissance and by a desire to assimilate this new style as rapidly as possible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gardner|first1=Helen|last2=De la Croix|first2=Horst|last3=Tansey|first3=Richard G|title=Art Through the Ages|date=1975|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|location=New York|isbn=0-15-503753-6|pages=556–557|edition=6th|ref=Gardner|chapter=The Renaissance in Northern Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the best known practitioners of German Renaissance art was Albrecht Dürer (1471–1528). Dürer's fascination with classical ideas led him to Italy to study art. Both Gardner and Russell recognized the importance of Durer's contribution to German art in bringing Italian Renaissance styles and ideas to Germany.&lt;ref name="The World of Dürer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Art Through the Ages"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gardner|first1=Helen|last2=De la Croix|first2=Horst|last3=Tansey|first3=Richard G|title=Art Through the Ages|date=1975|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|location=New York|isbn=0-15-503753-6|pages=561|edition=6th|chapter=The Renaissance in Northern Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russell calls this "Opening the Gothic windows of German art,"&lt;ref name="The World of Dürer"/&gt; while Gardner calls it Dürer's "life mission."&lt;ref name="Art Through the Ages"/&gt; Importantly, as Gardner points out, Dürer "was the first northern artist who fully understood the basic aims of the southern Renaissance,"&lt;ref name="Art Through the Ages"/&gt; although his style did not always reflect that. The same source says that [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] (1497–1543) successfully assimilated Italian ideas while also keeping "northern traditions of close realism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gardner|first1=Helen|last2=De la Croix|first2=Horst|last3=Tansey|first3=Richard G|title=Art Through the Ages|date=1975|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|location=New York|isbn=0-15-503753-6|pages=564|edition=6th|chapter=The Renaissance in Northern Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is contrasted against Dürer's tendency to work in "his own native German style"&lt;ref name="Art Through the Ages"/&gt; instead of combining German and Italian styles.
Other important artists of the German Renaissance were [[Matthias Grünewald|Grünewald]], [[Albrecht Altdorfer]], and [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gardner|first1=Helen|last2=De la Croix|first2=Horst|last3=Tansey|first3=Richard G|title=Art Through the Ages|date=1975|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|location=New York|isbn=0-15-503753-6|pages=557|edition=6th|chapter=The Renaissance in Northern Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Britain==
Britain was very late to develop a Renaissance style and most [[artists of the Tudor court]] were imported foreigners, usually from the [[Low countries]], including [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], who died in England.  One exception was the [[portrait miniature]], which artists including [[Nicholas Hilliard]] developed into a distinct genre, well before it became popular in the rest of Europe. [[Renaissance_in_Scotland#Art|Renaissance art in Scotland]] was similarly dependent on imported artists, and largely restricted to the court.

==Themes and symbolism==
[[File:Magnificatio.jpg|thumb|[[Sandro Botticelli]], ''[[Magnificat Madonna]]'', 1480–81, tempera on panel, [[Uffizi]], [[Florence]]]]
Renaissance artists painted a wide variety of themes. Religious [[altarpiece]]s, [[fresco]] cycles, and small works for private devotion were very popular. For inspiration, painters in both Italy and northern Europe frequently turned to [[Jacobus de Voragine]]'s ''[[Golden Legend]]'' (1260), a highly influential source book for the lives of [[saint]]s that had already had a strong influence on Medieval artists. The rebirth of classical antiquity and [[Renaissance humanism]] also resulted in many [[Mythology|Mythological]] and [[history painting]]s. [[Ovidian]] stories, for example, were very popular. Decorative [[Ornament (architecture)|ornament]], often used in painted architectural elements, was especially influenced by classical Roman motifs.

==Techniques==
* The use of [[proportion (architecture)|proportion]] – The first major treatment of the painting as a window into space appeared in the work of [[Giotto di Bondone]], at the beginning of the 14th century.  True linear perspective was formalized later, by [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] and [[Leon Battista Alberti]].  In addition to giving a more realistic presentation of art, it moved Renaissance painters into composing more paintings.
* [[Foreshortening]] – The term foreshortening refers to the artistic effect of shortening lines in a drawing so as to create an illusion of depth.
* [[Sfumato]] – The term sfumato was coined by Italian Renaissance artist, Leonardo da Vinci, and refers to a fine art painting technique of blurring or softening of sharp outlines by subtle and gradual blending of one tone into another through the use of thin glazes to give the illusion of depth or three-dimensionality. This stems from the Italian word sfumare meaning to evaporate or to fade out. The Latin origin is fumare, to smoke.
* [[Chiaroscuro]] – The term chiaroscuro refers to the fine art painting modeling effect of using a strong contrast between light and dark to give the illusion of depth or three-dimensionality. This comes from the Italian words meaning light (chiaro) and dark (scuro), a technique which came into wide use in the Baroque Period.

'''Samahang Makasining (Artist Club)''' (also known as '''Makasining''' or simply '''Artist Club''') is a widespread art organization in different universities and municipalities and also the largest collegiate semi-fraternity in the Philippines. It is organized to promote art awareness among the youth and develop their innate talents. It also aims to provide art community service, art related youth development, and social development opportunities for college students&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blographics.wordpress.com/2009/12/01/lakbay-turo2|title=Lakbay Turo|publisher=BlogGraphics|date=December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Philippines. It is composed not only of young aspirant artists but also of national art professionals, environmentalists, students and out-of-school youths. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neust.edu.ph/index.php?martcon=38&amp;ac=view&amp;_show=neust|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617100940/http://www.neust.edu.ph/index.php?martcon=38&amp;ac=view&amp;_show=neust|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-06-17|title=Student Organization|publisher=NEUST Website|date=2001|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; established in 1982. The [[Indigenous games]] or ''[[Laro ng Lahi]]'' was coined and popularized by this group&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpLQunmssd8|title=Lovely day Laro ng Lahi|publisher=GMA 7 Lovely day|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://makasining.org/?page=laro|title=LARO NG LAHI (Filipino Indigenous Games) Project|publisher=Makasining &amp; NCCA|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="laronglahiruffa"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDgZlIyNibU|title=(Laro ng Lahi) ABS-CBN Ruffa and Ai|publisher=ABS-CBN Ruffa and Ai|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the help of [[National Commission for Culture and the Arts]] (NCCA).&lt;ref name="laronglahiruffa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="laronglahipdf1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Terminal_Report_Sulyap_III_2003_Laro_ng_Lahi.pdf|accessdate=2009-05-25|title=Laro ng Lahi|publisher=Samahang Makasining (Artist Club), Inc.|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only organization who uses a unique officer structure for their chapters. Grand Artist is the equivalent of the President, Auxiliary Grand artist as Committee chair or as Vice President, Master Artist as Junior Adviser and Grand Master Artist as Adviser. It is also broadly consists of three main recognized level groups; 1) College Student level group, 2) Alumni/Municipal/Professional Level and 3) Mixed Probationary level group.

==History==
Established by a mere student organization in [[Central Luzon State University]] (CLSU)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tutsea.com.ph/organisations/2823/samahang-makasining-inc|title=Samahang Makasining (Artist Club), Inc.|publisher=ltutsea|date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; known as CLSU Artist Club which was founded on February 12, 1982. Starting by the [[Constancio Padilla National High School]] (CPNHS Young Artist Club) to be the first high school chapter founded on September 7, 1994. Then on September 5, 1995, the [[Nueva Ecija University of Science and Technology]] (NEUST Artist Club) in Cabanatuan City became the first College/University chapter. Founded also in that same year were the [[Ilocos Sur Polytechnic State College]] (ISPSC Artist Club) and [[Tarlac College of Agriculture]] (TCA Artist Club). 

In 1998 the Samahang Makasining (Artist Club) was officially registered at the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) as a non-profit organization. The group has been also recognized and affiliated to the [[National Commission for Culture and the Arts]] (NCCA) on the same year (1998).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://112.199.66.15/cultural_%20mapping/cultural_mapping.php?i=5|publisher=National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA)|title=Cultural mapping|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the SEC registration, the [[Pantabangan]] Municipal Chapter was founded and established on November 20, 1999, being the first Municipal/Professional level of the group. 

The organization has extended and opened the horizon to all interested artists. The [[Philippine Rice Research Institute|Philippine Rice Research Institute (PhilRice)]] Chapter became the first national agency professional level members founded on November 7, 2003. On November 29, 2008, that was 11 years passed, the University of Southern Mindanao (USM Artist Club) was founded and became the first University chapter in Mindanao area. There are now 42 chapters nationwide as of 2014.

=== The members ===
The members often use brother or sister for their members. The others called the members as '''Makasining''' (Filipoino term for pro-artist) or sometimes the members within the club use the word '''Kasining''' (Filipino term co-artist).

== Ritual and symbolism ==
The [[candle]] is a symbolic object for the group. It is a symbol of new born artist for the organization, while the candle [[light]] symbolizes the artist's life, knowledge and education. The Makasining describes itself as an "Art educator of the Universe, one of the great messengers".

'''Symmetry in the Quran''' is the belief held by some [[Muslim]]s, that the word and verse structure of the [[Quran]] exhibits such complicated [[symmetry]] that it could be neither [[Randomness|random placements]], nor the intentional work of man, but rather  proof of "the will of God".&lt;ref&gt;Statistical Profile of Holy Quran and Symmetry of Makki and Madni Surras, Muhammad Khyzer Bin Dost &amp; Munir Ahmad Pakistan Journal of Commerce and Social Sciences Vol.1 2008&lt;/ref&gt; There are many examples of such symmetry. Using a program called QuranCode &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/heliwave/QuranCode|title=QuranCode is a numerical and similarity research tool for the ever-revealing Book (القرءان الكريم) which is Readable (قرءان) despite being encrypted. |first=Ali |last=Adams |date=9 January 2018|publisher=|via=GitHub}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other analysis programs, scholars have found many patterns.

An example is that [[Al-Insan|chapter 76, called Al-Insan]], has 247 words, and three mentions of the word silver. The middle word of the chapter is word number 124, which is the word "silver". It is in a verse that is the middle verse of the chapter (verse 16 of 31), and it is the third of five words of the verse. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.7ameem.com/news.php?id=649&amp;catID=4|title=Numerical Analysis of Holy Quran: Silver in Surat AlInsan|website=www.7ameem.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of this symmetry is caused by the [[19 (number)#Islam|significance of the number 19 in Islam]]. It is claimed that if all the numbers mentioned in the Quran are added up, their sum is 162,146, which is 19 times 6534; That there are 114 (19 times 6) [[Surah]]s; that [[Muhammad's first revelation]] consists of a verse that has 19 words and 76 (4 times 19) letters.&lt;ref&gt;The Qurʼan: An Encyclopedia, edited by Oliver Leaman, page 465&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symmetry in Quranic linguistics ==
Another aspect of the Quran's symmetry, which was discovered using [[Linguistics|linguistic]] computer searching [[algorithm]]s (Quran Corpus, an [[open-source software]]), includes the number of times certain words and their forms are used in the whole Quran. Some of these symmetrical patterns include:

*Muslims [[Salah|pray 5 times every day]]. The word 'prayers' (صلوات) is used in the Quran exactly 5 times: [[Al-Baqara|2]]:157, 2:238, [[At-Tawba|9]]:99, [[Al-Hajj|22]]:40, and [[Al-Mu'minoon|23]]:9.{{fact|date=January 2017}}
*There are 12 months in a year. The word ‘month’ and all its forms are used in the Quran exactly 12 times: 2:185:1, 2:185:16, [[Saba (surah)|34]]:12:4, 34:12:6, 2:194:1, 2:194:3, [[Al-Qadr (surah)|97]]:3, 2:217, 9:36, [[Al-Ahqaf|46]]:15, [[Al-Ma'ida|5]]:2 and 5:97.{{fact|date=January 2017}}
*The Quran says there are [[seven heavens]] above us, sometimes described as seven layers (23:17). We are in the lowest of these layers (دنيا), so the Quran is basically saying that there are six layers "above" the one we are in. The phrase ‘seven heavens’ is used in the whole Quran exactly seven times: 2:29, [[Fussilat|41]]:12, [[At-Talaq|65]]:12, [[Al-Mulk|67]]:3, [[Nuh (surah)|71]]:15, [[Al-Isra|17]]:44, and 23:86. {{fact|date=January 2017}}
*Muslims [[Circumambulation|circumambulate]] around the [[Qibla]], which is the [[Kaaba]], seven times during pilgrimage. The word ‘Qibla’ is used in the whole Quran exactly seven times: 2:142:8, 2:143:15, 2:144:8, 2:145:10, 2:145:14, 2:145:18, and [[Yunus (surah)|10]]:87:12.{{fact|date=January 2017}}

'''Tank Man''' (also known as the '''Unknown Protester''' or '''Unknown Rebel''') is the nickname of an unidentified man who stood in front of a column of tanks on June 5, 1989, the morning after the [[People's Liberation Army at Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Chinese military had suppressed]] the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]] by force. As the lead tank maneuvered to pass by the man, he repeatedly shifted his position in order to obstruct the tank's attempted path around him. The incident was filmed and smuggled out to a worldwide audience. Internationally, it is considered one of the most iconic images of all time.&lt;ref name="bare_url"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/03/behind-the-scenes-tank-man-of-tiananmen/ | work=The New York Times | first=Patrick | last=Witty | title=Behind the Scenes: Tank Man of Tiananmen | date=June 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FloorSpeech"&gt;[[Joe Pitts|Pitts, Joe]].

 | last = Corless | first = Kieron | title = Time In – Plugged In – Tank Man | magazine= Time Out | date = May 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inside China, the image and the events leading up were subject to heavy state censorship, and as a result they are being forgotten.

There is no reliable information about the identity or fate of the man; the story of what happened to the tank crew is also unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SACHK-W4o1E&amp;t=4m28s |title=Photographer Jeff Widener |work=BBC interview |date=2014|edition= Video}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At least one witness has stated that "Tank Man" was not the only person who had opposed the tanks during the protest.  Shao Jiang, who was a student leader, said: "I witnessed a lot of the people standing up, blocking the tanks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1UUS1ZGAi4&amp;t=1m22s |title=Shao Jiang interview |work=Amnesty International|edition= Video posted for 25th anniversary|accessdate= May 28, 2014 }} Those interviewed include photographer Stuart Franklin with ''Magnum'' for TIME, who was on the 5th floor balcony of the Beijing Hotel.&lt;/ref&gt;  Tank Man is unique in that he is the only one who was photographed and recorded on video.

==Incident==
The incident took place at the north edge of [[Tiananmen Square]], along [[Chang'an Avenue]], on June 5, 1989, two days after the Chinese government's violent crackdown on the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen protests]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Makinen |first=Julie |date=4 June 2014 |title=Tiananmen Square mystery: Who was 'Tank Man'? |url=http://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-china-tiananmen-square-tank-man-20140603-story.html |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |access-date=16 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The man stood in the middle of the wide avenue, directly in the path of a column of approaching [[Type 59 tank|Type 59]] tanks. Stuart Franklin, who was on assignment for ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' magazine, told the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]],'' "At some point, shots were fired and the tanks carried on down the road toward us, leaving Tiananmen Square behind, until blocked by a lone protester."&lt;ref name="bare_url"/&gt; He wore a white shirt and black trousers, and he held two shopping bags.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Langely|first=Andrew|title=Tiananmen Square: Massacre Crushes China's Democracy Movement|publisher=Compass Point Books|year=2009|page=45|isbn=978-0-7565-4101-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the tanks came to a stop, the man gestured towards the tanks with one of the bags. In response, the lead tank attempted to drive around the man, but the man repeatedly stepped into the path of the tank in a show of [[nonviolent action]].&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;[http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,988169,00.html The Unknown Rebel] ''Time'' Magazine profile, 13 April 1998. Retrieved 10 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; After repeatedly attempting to go around rather than crush the man, the lead tank stopped its engines, and the armored vehicles behind it seemed to follow suit. There was a short pause with the man and the tanks having reached a quiet, still impasse.

Having successfully brought the column to a halt, the man climbed onto the hull of the buttoned-up lead tank and, after briefly stopping at the driver's hatch, appeared in video footage of the incident to call into various ports in the tank's turret. He then climbed atop the turret and seemed to have a short conversation with a crew member at the gunner's hatch. After ending the conversation, the man descended from the tank. The tank commander briefly emerged from his hatch, and the tanks restarted their engines, ready to continue on.  At that point, the man, who was still standing within a meter or two from the side of the lead tank, leapt in front of the vehicle once again and quickly re-established the man–tank standoff.

Video footage shows two figures in blue pulling the man away and disappearing with him into a nearby crowd; the tanks continued on their way.&lt;ref name=Time/&gt; Eyewitnesses are unsure who pulled him aside. [[Charlie Cole (photographer)|Charlie Cole]], who was there for ''[[Newsweek]]'', said it was the Chinese government [[Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau|PSB]] (the police),&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4313282.stm Picture Power:Tiananmen Standoff] BBC News. Last updated October 7, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Jan Wong]], who was there for ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', thought that the men who pulled him away were concerned bystanders. In April 1998, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' included the "Unknown Rebel" in a feature titled "[[Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Iyer |first=Pico |title=The Unknown Rebel |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,988169,00.html |journal=Time |date=13 April 1998 |access-date=16 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2016, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' included Jeff Widener's photograph in "Time 100: The Most Influential Images of All Time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Time 100: The Most Influential Images of All Time |url=http://100photos.time.com|journal=Time |date=6 November 2016 |access-date=19 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identity and fate==
Little is publicly known of the man's identity or that of the commander of the lead tank. Shortly after the incident, the British tabloid ''[[Sunday Express]]'' named him as '''Wang Weilin''' ({{lang|zh-hans|王维林}}), a 19-year-old student&lt;ref&gt;"[http://articles.latimes.com/1990-06-03/news/mn-819_1_man-tank-pictures Man who defied tanks may be dead]", ''[[Los Angeles Times]],'' June 3, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; who was later charged with "political hooliganism" and "attempting to subvert members of the [[People's Liberation Army]]."&lt;ref&gt;Munro, Robin; Spiegel, Mickey (1994). ''Detained in China and Tibet: a directory of political and religious prisoners''. Asia Watch Committee. p. 194. {{ISBN|978-1-56432-105-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this claim has been rejected by internal [[Communist Party of China]] documents, which reported that they could not find the man, according to the Hong Kong-based [[Information Centre for Human Rights and Democracy|Information Center for Human Rights]].&lt;ref name=times30&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article6390782.ece|title=Identity of Tank Man of Tiananmen Square remains a mystery |last=Macartney|first=Jane|date=May 30, 2009|work=The Times |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; One party member was quoted as saying, "We can’t find him. We got his name from journalists. We have checked through computers but can’t find him among the dead or among those in prison."&lt;ref name=times30/&gt; Numerous theories have sprung up as to the man's identity and current whereabouts.&lt;ref name="Wang Weilin by tank file"&gt;{{zh icon}} [http://appledaily.atnext.com/template/apple/art_main.cfm?iss_id=20060602&amp;sec_id=4104&amp;subsec_id=11866&amp;art_id=5986243 Wang Weilin by tank file], ''Apple Daily'', June 2, 2006, p. A1. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221173327/http://appledaily.atnext.com/template/apple/art_main.cfm?iss_id=20060602&amp;sec_id=4104&amp;subsec_id=11866&amp;art_id=5986243 |date=February 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several conflicting stories about what happened to him after the demonstration. In a speech to the President's Club in 1999, [[Bruce Herschensohn]], former deputy special assistant to [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]], reported that he was [[Execution (legal)|executed]] 14 days later; other sources say he was executed by [[firing squad]] a few months after the Tiananmen Square protests.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt; In ''[[Red China Blues: My Long March from Mao to Now]]'', [[Jan Wong]] writes that she believes from her interactions with the government press that they have "no idea who he was either" and that he's still alive somewhere on the mainland. Another theory is that he escaped to [[Taiwan]] and remains employed there as an archaeologist in the [[National Palace Museum]]. This was first reported by the [[Yonhap|Yonhap news agency]] in [[South Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/tiananmen-square-what-happened-to-tank-man-9483398.html|title=Tiananmen Square 25th anniversary: What happened to Tank Man?|date=2014-06-04|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-12-11|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[government of the People's Republic of China]] has made few statements about the incident or the people involved. In a 1990 interview with [[Barbara Walters]], then-[[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|CPC General Secretary]] [[Jiang Zemin]] was asked what became of the man. Jiang first stated (through an interpreter), "I can't confirm whether this young man you mentioned was arrested or not," and then replied in English, "I think never killed"{{sic}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tankman/etc/transcript.html|title=''Frontline'': ''The Tank Man'' transcript|accessdate=June 30, 2008|date=April 11, 2006|work=Frontline|publisher=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government also argued that the incident evidenced the "humanity" of the country's military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Higgins|first=Andrew|title=Tycoon prods Taiwan closer to China|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/tycoon-prods-taiwan-closer-to-china/2012/01/20/gIQAhswmFQ_story.html|accessdate=January 31, 2012|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=January 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2000 interview with [[Mike Wallace]], [[Jiang Zemin]] said, "He was never arrested." He then stated, "I don't know where he is now." He also emphasized that the tank stopped and did not run the young man down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/chinas-leader-talks-to-60-minutes/|title=China's Leader Talks To 60 Minutes|date=August 31, 2000|work=cbsnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International notability and censorship==
[[File:Intersection of East Chang'an Avenue and Nanheyan Street, Beijing, 2014.jpg|right|thumb|The intersection in 2014, viewed from a different angle|alt=A wide street blocked off by white guardrails with a large tree at the left in front of it and part of a brick building on the right in the rear. At the extreme left is an intersection with traffic lights]]
Internationally, the image of the lone man in front of the tank has come to symbolize the events at Tiananmen Square in 1989&lt;ref name=times30/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTNewPhoto"/&gt; and is widely considered one of the most iconic images of all time.&lt;ref name="bare_url"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FloorSpeech"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Corless2006"/&gt;

A [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] interview of six experts noted that the memory of the Tiananmen Square protests appears to have faded in China, especially among younger Chinese people, due to government censorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tankman/themes/legacy.html|title=Legacy of June Fourth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Images of the protest on the Internet have been [[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China|censored in China]].&lt;ref name=times30/&gt; When undergraduate students at Peking University, which was at the center of the incident, were shown copies of the iconic photograph 16 years afterwards, they were "genuinely mystified."&lt;ref name=frontlineinterview&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tankman/interviews/wong.html|title=The Tank Man: Interview: Jan Wong |accessdate=August 12, 2010|date=April 11, 2006|work=Frontline|publisher=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the students said that the image was "artwork." It is noted in the documentary ''[[Frontline (US TV series)|Frontline]]: The Tank Man'' that he whispered to the student next to him "89," which led the interviewer to surmise that the student may have concealed his knowledge of the event.

It has been suggested that the "Unknown Rebel," if still alive, never made himself known as he is unaware of his international recognition due to Chinese media suppression of events relating to government protest.&lt;ref name=times30/&gt;

At and after the events in the square, the PSB treated members of the international press roughly, confiscating and destroying all the film they could find, and forced the signing of confessions to offences such as photography during martial law, punishable by long imprisonment.&lt;ref name="BBCnews"/&gt;

==Photographic versions==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:TankMan.JPG|thumb|300px|"Tank Man", far off in the background to the left of the leader, prepares to face down the row of incoming tanks. This photograph, taken by Terril Jones, was only released in 2009.]] --&gt;

Five photographers (one of whom did not share his material for 20 years) managed to capture the event on film that was not later confiscated by the PSB.&lt;ref name="NYTimeretrospect"&gt;Witty, Patrick (June 3, 2009). [http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/03/behind-the-scenes-tank-man-of-tiananmen/ Behind the Scenes: Tank Man of Tiananmen], ''New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; On June 4, 2009, the fifth photographer released an image of the scene taken from ground level.&lt;ref name="NYTNewPhoto"&gt;Witty, Patrick (June 4, 2009). [http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/04/behind-the-scenes-a-new-angle-on-history/?hp Behind the Scenes: A New Angle on History] ''[[The New York Times]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

The widest coverage of the event and one of the best-known photographs of the event appearing in both ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazines, was documented by [[Stuart Franklin]]. He was on the same balcony as [[Charlie Cole (photographer)|Charlie Cole]], and his roll of film was smuggled out of the country by a French student, concealed in a box of tea.&lt;ref name="NYTimeretrospect" /&gt;

The most-used photograph of the event was taken by [[Jeff Widener]] of the [[Associated Press]], from a sixth-floor balcony of the [[Beijing Hotel]], about half a mile (800&amp;nbsp;meters) away from the scene. Widener was injured and suffering from the flu. The image was taken using a [[Nikon FE2]] camera through a Nikkor [[Telephoto lens|400mm 5.6 ED-IF lens]] and [[Nikon TC-301|TC-301]] teleconverter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/06/02/world/main5057008.shtml|title="Tank Man": The Picture That Almost Wasn't|last=Alfano |first=Sean |date=June 4, 2009|publisher=[[CBS News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Widener running out of film, a friend (by the name of Kirk)  hastily obtained a roll of Fuji 100 ASA color negative film, allowing him to make the shot.&lt;ref name="bare_url"/&gt; Though he was concerned that his shots were no good, his image was syndicated to many newspapers around the world&lt;ref name="NYTimeretrospect" /&gt; and was said to have appeared on the front page of all European papers.&lt;ref name="urlNew York Times"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/03/behind-the-scenes-tank-man-of-tiananmen/ |title=Behind the Scenes: Tank Man of Tiananmen |author=Patrick Witty |date=June 3, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5shP0U7jv?url=http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/03/behind-the-scenes-tank-man-of-tiananmen/ |archivedate=September 12, 2010 |accessdate=September 12, 2010 |work=The New York Times |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also nominated for the Pulitzer prize but did not win. Nevertheless, his photograph has widely been known as one of the most iconic photographs of all time.&lt;ref name="bare_url"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FloorSpeech"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Corless2006"/&gt;

[[File:Tankman new longshot StuartFranklin.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Wider shot by Stuart Franklin showing column of tanks approaching Tank Man, who is shown near the lower-left corner.]]
Charlie Cole, working for ''[[Newsweek]]'' and on the same balcony as Stuart Franklin, hid his roll of film containing Tank Man in a Beijing Hotel toilet, sacrificing an unused roll of film and undeveloped images of wounded protesters after the [[Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau|PSB]] raided his room, destroyed the two aforementioned rolls of film and forced him to sign a confession to photography during martial law, an imprisonable offence. Cole was able to retrieve the roll and have it sent to ''Newsweek''.&lt;ref name="NYTimeretrospect" /&gt; He was awarded the 1990 [[World Press Photo]] of the Year&lt;ref name="WorldPressPhoto"&gt;[https://www.worldpressphoto.org/collection/photo/1990/world-press-photo-year/charlie-cole] World Press Photo&lt;/ref&gt; and the picture was featured in ''Life''{{'s}} "[[100 Photographs that Changed the World|100 Photographs That Changed the World]]" in 2003.

On June 4, 2009, in connection with the 20th anniversary of the protests, Associated Press reporter, Terril Jones, revealed a photo he had taken showing the Tank Man from ground level, a different angle from all of the other known photos of the Tank Man. Jones wrote that he was not aware of what he had captured until a month later when printing his photos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=Terril|year=2009|title=Tank Man|journal=Pomona College Magazine|volume=41|issue=1 |url=http://pomona.edu/Magazine/PCMFL09/FStankman.shtml|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306041054/http://pomona.edu/Magazine/PCMFL09/FStankman.shtml|archivedate=March 6, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arthur Tsang Hin Wah of [[Reuters]] took several shots from room 1111 of the Beijing Hotel,&lt;ref name="HKPPA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://translate.google.com.hk/translate?hl=zh-TW&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;prev=_t&amp;sl=zh-CN&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://thehousenews.com/society/%25E5%259B%259E%25E5%2588%25B0%25E5%25A1%25B5%25E5%259C%259F%25E4%25BA%25BA%25E9%2596%2593-%25E6%259B%25BE%25E9%25A1%25AF%25E8%258F%25AF%25E8%25A8%25AA%25E8%25AB%2587/|title=Arthur Tsang Hin Wah interview, March 20, 2013|work=google.com.hk}}&lt;/ref&gt; but only the shot of Tank Man climbing the tank was chosen.&lt;ref name="NYTimeretrospect" /&gt; It was not until several hours later that the photo of the man standing in front of the tank was finally chosen. When the staff noticed Widener's work, they re-checked Tsang's negative to see if it was of the same moment as Widener's. On March 20, 2013, in an interview by the Hong Kong Press Photographers Association (HKPPA), Wah told the story and added further detail. He told HKPPA that on the night of June 3, 1989, he was beaten by students while taking photos and was bleeding. A "foreign" photographer accompanying him suddenly said, "I am not gonna die for your country," and left. Wah returned to the hotel. When he decided to go out again, the [[Chinese public security bureau|public security]] stopped him, so he stayed in his room, stood next to the window and eventually witnessed the Tank Man and took several shots of the event.&lt;ref name="HKPPA" /&gt;

In addition to the photography, video footage of the scene was recorded and transmitted across the globe. [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC) cameraman [[Willie Phua]], [[CNN]] cameraman Jonathan Schaer and [[NBC]] cameraman Tony Wasserman appear to be the only television cameramen who captured the scene.&lt;ref name="Shooting the 'tank man' of Tiananmen Square"&gt;{{cite web|title=Capturing Asia|url=http://www.bobwurth.com/capturing-asia.html|website=Books and Essays by Bob Wurth on the Asia Pacific Region|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Willie Phua 7.30 report ABC"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkck39jSV-M&amp;t=4m51s Willie Phua on Australia Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) 7.30 Report].

After seeing Chinese tanks crush vehicles and people on June 3, many journalists and photographers believed the protests had already reached their peak, causing many to leave the area before the "tank man" incident occurred.&lt;ref name="BBCnews"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4313282.stm Picture Power: Tiananmen Standoff]. [[BBC News]]. October 7, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OiGZgm93j8 Photojournalist on Tiananmen Square tank standoff]. [[CNN]]. May 19, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In [[Tom Clancy]]'s 2000 novel ''[[The Bear and the Dragon]]'', the Chinese authorities apprehend and execute Tank Man, then bill the surviving family for the cost of the pistol round expended to shoot him in the back of the head.

A similar scene is depicted in the music video for ''[[Club Foot (song)|Club Foot]]'' (2004) by the English rock band [[Kasabian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/91923534 |author=Kasabian |title=Club Foot feat. Dinara Drukarova|website=Vimeo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tank Man is briefly referenced in the 2007 film ''[[Superbad (film)|Superbad]]''.

The music video for "[[Refuse/Resist]]" by the thrash/death metal band [[Sepultura]] features brief footage of the Tank Man.

A fictionalized version of the fates of both the Tank Man and a soldier in the tank is told in [[Lucy Kirkwood]]'s 2013 play ''[[Chimerica (play)|Chimerica]]'', which premiered at the Almeida Theatre from May 20, 2013 to July 6, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hitchings|first=Henry|title=Chimerica, Almeida Theatre – theatre review |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/goingout/theatre/chimerica-almeida-theatre--theatre-review-8635490.html|accessdate=June 16, 2015|work=London Evening Standard|date=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 4, 2013, [[Sina Weibo]], China's most popular microblog, blocked terms whose English translations are "today", "tonight", "[[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|June 4]]", and "big yellow duck". If these were searched for, a message appeared stating that, in accordance with relevant laws, statutes, and policies, the results of the search could not be shown. The censorship occurred because a [[Photo manipulation#Photoshopping|photoshopped]] version of Tank Man, in which [[rubber ducks]] replaced the tanks, had been circulating around [[Twitter]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Didi Kirsten Tatlow|title=Censored in China: ‘Today,’ ‘Tonight’ and ‘Big Yellow Duck’|url=http://rendezvous.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/04/censored-in-china-today-tonight-and-big-yellow-duck/|work=International New York Times IHT Rendezvous|date=June 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;—a reference to [[Florentijn Hofman]]'s [[Rubber Duck (sculpture)|''Rubber Duck'']] sculpture, which at that time was floating in Hong Kong's [[Victoria Harbour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2013/06/04/fools-errand-why-china-censors-rubber-duckies-on-tiananmen-anniversary/|date=June 4, 2013|title=Fool's Errand: Why China Censors Rubber Duckies On Tiananmen Anniversary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Footage of Tank Man is included in the 2014 film adaptation of [[Lois Lowry|Lowis Lowry]]'s ''[[The Giver]]'', during a montage intended to give the protagonist strength.

A 2017 novel published by Random House Mondadori, [https://www.penguinrandomhousegrupoeditorial.com/foreign-rights-catalogue/la-quimera-del-hombre-tanque/ La quimera del Hombre Tanque] fictionalizes a second, hypothetical encounter between the two protagonists of the iconic photo of 1989. Aiming at social reconciliation, a group of Chinese leaders tries to broadcast on TV, a quarter of a century after the incident, a peaceful encounter between Tank Man and the tank commander.&lt;ref&gt;Víctor Sombra, Barcelona 2017 {{ISBN|978-84-3973292-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Death of General Warren at the Battle of Bunker's Hill, June 17, 1775''''' refers to several [[oil painting|oil paintings]] completed in the early 19th century by the American artist [[John Trumbull]] depicting the death of [[Joseph Warren]] at the June 17, 1775 [[Battle of Bunker Hill]], during the [[American Revolutionary War]].  Warren, an influential [[Massachusetts]] physician and politician, had been commissioned as a general but he served in the battle as a volunteer private.  He was killed during or shortly after the storming of the [[redoubt]] atop [[Breed's Hill]] by [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] troops.  

The paintings are iconic images of the American Revolution. Trumbull painted several versions, including the one held by the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]] (dated between 1815 and 1831). This was commissioned by the Warren family and passed down through the family before being acquired by the museum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/the-death-of-general-warren-at-the-battle-of-bunker-s-hill-17-june-1775-34260], ''[[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Another, larger version (dated 1834) is held by the [[Wadsworth Atheneum]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pubhist.com/w13399]&lt;/ref&gt;  Trumbull sold the engraving rights for both this painting and ''[[The Death of General Montgomery in the Attack on Quebec, December 31, 1775]],'' which resulted in a highly successful subscription release that greatly enhanced his career.

==Event==
Artist [[John Trumbull]] (1756&amp;ndash;1843) was in the colonial army camp at [[Roxbury, Massachusetts]] on June 17, 1775, the day of the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]].  He watched the battle unfold through field glasses, and later decided to depict one of its central events.&lt;ref name=T137&gt;Tamarkin, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Joseph Warren]], a [[Massachusetts]] politician and member of the colony's [[Committee of Safety (American Revolution)|Committee of Safety]], volunteered to serve under Colonel [[William Prescott]] in the defense of the [[redoubt]] which the colonists had constructed on top of [[Breed's Hill]].  This redoubt was the target of three British attacks, of which the first two were repulsed.  The third attack succeeded, in part because the defenders had run out of ammunition.  Warren was struck by a musket or pistol ball during the evacuation of the redoubt, and killed instantly.

==Description==
[[File:Self Portrait by John Trumbull circa 1802.jpeg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Self-portrait of Trumbull]]
The central focus of the painting is Warren's body, dressed in white, and [[John Small (British Army officer)|John Small]], a British major, dressed in a scarlet uniform (holding a sword in his left hand).&lt;ref name="Key to the Battle of Bunker's Hill"&gt;{{cite web|title=Key to the Battle of Bunker's Hill|url=http://www.americanrevolution.org/bunkey.html|publisher=americanrevolution.org|accessdate=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small, who had served with colonial general [[Israel Putnam]] during the [[French and Indian War]], is shown preventing a fellow British soldier from bayoneting Warren. Trumbull wanted to express the poignancy in the conflict of men who had earlier served together.

On the far right of the painting is a colonial officer, [[Thomas Grosvenor (American Revolution)|Thomas Grosvenor]], with a black man holding a [[musket]] behind him.  The black man was long thought to be [[Peter Salem]], a freed slave who served in the cause of American independence. Later research identified him as a slave belonging to Grosvenor.&lt;ref name=T137/&gt;

The foreground is littered with bodies from both sides of the conflict, and the background includes clusters of colonial and British troops carrying flags. [[Boston Harbor]] is also visible in the distance. The sky is partially obscured by smoke rising from [[Charlestown, Massachusetts|Charlestown]], which had been torched by the British.

In describing the painting for a catalogue of his works, Trumbull explained why he chose to emphasize the British Major Small's role, saying that Small, whom he had met in London, "was equally distinguished by acts of humanity and kindness to his enemies, as by bravery and fidelity to the cause he served."&lt;ref&gt;Tamarkin, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Oasis'' is a short [[Satire|satirical]] novel by American writer [[Mary McCarthy (author)|Mary McCarthy.]] Published by [[Random House]] in 1949, it is McCarthy's second novel. Described by McCarthy as a [[Philosophical fiction|“conte philosophique,”]]&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, Nicholas. "Social Utopia: Hannah Arendt and Mary McCarthy’s The Oasis." Pg. 45&lt;/ref&gt; it tells the story of a group of embattled intellectuals, their quest to establish a Utopian community in the mountains of New England, and their failure to surmount ideological and personal differences for the greater good of the commune. Doubling as a [[roman à clef]], ''The Oasis'' borrows heavily from McCarthy's experiences and frustrations with the short lived [[European-American Group,]] and serves more broadly as a critique of the “abstract idealism of intellectuals”&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs-Abrams, Sabrina. "The Liberal Cauldron: Satire of the Postwar Intellectual." Mary McCarthy: Gender, Politics, and the Postwar Intellectual. Pg. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; and their inability to enact actual change.

== Plot ==
Set in the near future following 1949, ''The Oasis'' depicts a group of fifty radical and liberal [[Intellectual|intellectuals]] who venture into the mountains of New England to create a shared living commune (aptly named, “[[Utopia]]”). Already present in Utopia's formation, however, is a deep ideological schism between two rivaling factions: the cynical Realists and self-righteous Purists. The Realists, led by the embittered former [[Marxism|Marxist]] William Taub, anticipate the experiment to end in little more than a summer vacation, awaiting Utopia's eventual demise, while the Purists, led by the magazine editor Macdougal Macdermott, are hesitant to perform any action that could contradict their radical, [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] beliefs.

The first challenge presented to both factions is whether or not they will admit the Lockman family, led by the exuberant, blue-blooded Joe Lockman, into Utopia. Macdermott, who regards Lockman as a “philistine,”&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, Mary. The Oasis. Pg. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; eventually grants the Lockmans his approval for fear that he might otherwise appear elitist. The acceptance of the Lockmans, however, calls forth the larger question, “Was it to follow that anyone could be admitted to Utopia?”&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy. Pg. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the first night in Utopia, it is the Realist leader Taub, not Macdermott, that finds Lockman to be a nuisance, put on edge by Lockman's bombastic spirit and hunting rifle. The next morning, Katy Norell, one of Utopia's more vocal Purists, burns herself and ruins the commune's breakfast while cooking. Most likely an honest mishap, the incident is quickly politicized and blamed on Lockman by the Realists. Following the mishap, Katy's husband, Preston, publicly scolds Katy for ruining breakfast, demonstrating the immense strain that communal living has taken on the residents of Utopia.

That night, the Realists convene a communal meeting, conspiring to exile Joe and assert their dominance over the Purists. When they are given the floor, however, both Taub and his followers are unable to articulate what it is they want or on what grounds they wish to expel Joe. The meeting ends with the Purists laughing at Taub. Macdermott dismisses the Realists as “revolutionary nihilists,” explaining, “They don’t know what they want… They’re so conservative they’re afraid of their own thoughts.”&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy. Pg. 105-106.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a short “lyrical period” of peace, prosperity, and basking in the [[pastoral]] quaintness of the commune, the Utopians begin to question the purpose of their project, and whether or not their mission serves a greater good. Katy Norell laments not living up to the expectations of Monteverdi, the ideological “Founder” of the commune and champion of the Purists’ beliefs. They consider creating a “United States of Europe in Exile,” a mission to bring [[Refugee|refugees]] displaced by [[World War II]] to America in order to create more small-scale communities like their own. However, the plan falls apart almost as quickly as it is proposed. Grand ambitions to contact congressmen, trade unionists, and newspapers dissolve into an effort to make a simple pamphlet, but this idea is also abandoned.

One day, the Taubs, Katy, and other members of the commune go strawberry picking on the outskirts of Utopia, only to find that a group of locals have beaten them to the site. When the Utopians ask the locals to leave some berries for them, the Utopians are rudely dismissed. Seeing their dismay, Joe Lockman fires blanks from his gun in order to ward the intruding locals away from Utopia. Lockman then insists everyone in Utopia padlock their front doors, prompting a commune-wide philosophical debate on the implications of privatizing property in Utopia. The discussion prompted by the intruders’ arrival grows broader and broader, with Katy and Taub disagreeing on whether Utopia can survive such a shake up. Katy, drunk, ends up lying in the grass in order to take in the pastoral setting, while Jim Haines, a “[[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]]-esque” magazine editor who is revered by all Utopians, begins to pack up his car to leave the commune, confirming Katy's worst suspicions that, “Ultimately, Utopia would fail.”&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy. Pg. 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characters ==
'''William Taub-''' Based on [[Philip Rahv]], McCarthy's ex-lover and editor at [[Partisan Review|''The Partisan Review'',]] Taub is the leader of the Realist faction of Utopia. As the victim of the book's most “outrageous satire,”&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs-Abrams, Pg. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Taub is depicted as cowardly, lazy, self-centered, and villainous, amounting to a “not especially flattering depiction”&lt;ref&gt;Sumner, George. “Nicola Chiaromonte, the Politics Circle, and the Search for a Postwar ‘Third Camp.’”&lt;/ref&gt; of the jaded [[Anti-Stalinist left|anti-Stalinist.]] Convinced that the “potency of history” will prove the “failure of socialism,”&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, Mary. The Oasis. Pg. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Taub is fixated on seeing Utopia fail.

'''Macdougal Macdermott-''' Serving as a stand-in for [[Dwight Macdonald]] (a friend of McCarthy's and the founder of the magazine ''[[Politics (magazine 1944–1949)|politics]]''), Macdermott is the leader of the Purist faction. Though Macdonald is not lampooned to the same degree that Rahv is, the character of Macdermott is hot-tempered, blindly committed to being consistent in his libertarian views, and susceptible to being roped into Taub's political chess match.

'''Joe Lockman-''' A “[[Capitalism|capitalist]] monad” who “sets the purists’ symbolic tests,” Joe’s impulsive nature pushes the ideological imperatives of both the Realists and the Purists to their limits.&lt;ref&gt;Wilford, Hugh. “An Oasis: The New York Intellectuals in the Late 1940s.” Pg. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; He represents the layman, the non-intellectual, and the growing professional class that is discovering the merits of [[Modernism|modernist]] thought and expression.

'''Katy Norell-''' A libertarian idealist dedicated to the purist faction and stuck in a fractious marriage, Katy resembles McCarthy in 1949 more closely than any other character in ''The Oasis''. Katy provides the book’s strongest feminine perspective and feminist argument, “reveal[ing] much remains to be learned about women’s rights in [Utopia].”&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs-Abrams, Pg. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Large sections of ''The Oasis'' hold little narrative distance from Katy, as the reader sees the mission of the commune fall apart through Katy's eyes towards the end of the novel.

'''Jim Haines-''' A handsome magazine editor whose departure from Utopia portends the beginning of the end of Utopia.

'''Susan Hapgood-''' A novelist and follower of the Realist faction who dotes on Taub, Susan is perhaps meant to represent the younger McCarthy, or perhaps [[Elizabeth Hardwick (writer)|Elizabeth Hardwick]], McCarthy's friend and fellow novelist.

'''Harold Sidney-''' Based on [[William Phillips (editor)|William Phillips]], a co-editor of ''The Partisan Review'' with Philip Rahv, Sidney is Taub's second-in-command. Though less capricious than Taub, he is equally conniving, and, when the time comes for him to speak out against Lockman, Macdermott, and the Purists, he is also equally inept.

'''Leo Raphael-''' Inspired by discussion of the commune's greater purpose, Leo proposes that the Utopians refocus their energies on a United States of Europe in Exile, in which the commune can act as a model for European refugees who wish to escape the threat of communism and settle in America.

'''Monteverdi, “the Founder”-''' Based on [[Nicola Chiaromonte]]. While he does not make any actual appearance in Utopia, the Founder is seen as a sort of prophet by the Purists, his absence leaving them directionless.

== Publishing History ==
''The Oasis'' was originally published as an ongoing series under the name ''A Source of Embarrassment'' by the British literary magazine [[Horizon (magazine)|''Horizon''.]]&lt;ref&gt;Grumbach, Doris. The Company She Kept: Mary McCarthy, Herself and Her Writings. Pg. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; It was published by Random House in 1949. Though its initial circulation was limited, the novel was reissued by [[Melville House Publishing|Melville House]] in 2013 as part of its “Neversink Library” series.

== Historical Background ==
Following the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|bombing of Hiroshima]] in the summer of 1945, which McCarthy referred to as a “watershed, a dividing line,”&lt;ref&gt;Sumner. Pg. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; many of the [[The New York Intellectuals|New York Intellectuals]]—a group, which included McCarthy, of contributors to ''politics'', ''Partisan Review'', and other preeminent New York writers and thinkers—became alarmed by the rapidly escalating [[nuclear arms race]] between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. As many of the New York Intellectuals were formerly avowed [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] Communists,&lt;ref&gt;Wilford. Pg. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; the group became attracted to the idea of retreating from society at large and participating in small-scale communal living. Concerning the period immediately following the war, McCarthy would later remark: “It seemed possible still, utopian but possible, to change the world on a small scale.”&lt;ref&gt;Sumner. Pg. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

That summer, McCarthy and her fellow New York Intellectuals, under the guidance of activist Nicola Chiaromonte, established the European-American Group (EAG) in an effort to create “human-scaled, grassroots, transnational communities of dialogue and solidarity.” This effort towards small-scale living, however, was short lived. Soon after its founding, the EAG disbanded “due to a lack of internal consensus about its goals,” as “the Macdonald-McCarthy-Chiaromonte faction” failed to find common ground with the so-called “''Partisan Review'' Boys,” Philip Rahv and William Phillips.&lt;ref&gt;Sumner. Pg. 57-58.&lt;/ref&gt; As Hugh Wilford contends in his historio-literary analysis of ''The Oasis'', “An Oasis: The New York Intellectuals in the Late 1940s,” the dissolution of the EAG marked the beginning of the cooptation of [[Old Left]] holdouts such as McCarthy and her contemporaries into a larger liberal, post-World War II consensus. In fact, many members of the EAG would become key figures in the creation of the [[Congress for Cultural Freedom]] (CCF), a front organization designed by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] for the purposes of winning the [[Cultural Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilford. Pg. 221-222.&lt;/ref&gt; Only a few years later, in the spring of 1949, McCarthy—along with Dwight Mcdonald, Elizabeth Hardwick, [[Sidney Hook]], and other former EAG members—would help disrupt a communist conference held at the [[Waldorf Astoria New York|Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.]]&lt;ref&gt;Grumbach. Pg. 147-148.&lt;/ref&gt; Foreseeing this eventual shift, McCarthy spent her final days in the EAG documenting the group's failures through her writing of ''The Oasis''.&lt;ref&gt;Sumner. Pg. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Analysis ==
''The Oasis'' has been described as “an imaginative inquiry into the causes of radical failure,”&lt;ref&gt;Wilford. Pg. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; a satirical critique of the limitations of intellectual debate and the ability for intellectuals to enact actual change, as well as a condemnation of communal and political organization in general. For the latter reason, much has been written on the relationship between ''The Oasis'' and the philosophy of McCarthy's longtime friend, historian [[Hannah Arendt]]. In “Social Utopia: Hannah Arendt and Mary McCarthy’s ''The Oasis'',” Nicholas Spencer argues that both Arendt and McCarthy are wary of the propensity of political groups towards “altruistic fervor” and injecting their “personal conduct” with “general objectivity”.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer. Pg. 52-53.&lt;/ref&gt; Since neither believes that the convictions of political groups can withstand social and personal pressure enacted by the individuals that compose these groups, both favor a “solitude over solidarity” model. Both Arendt and McCarthy view the role of the group as “anesthetic,” and believe that an individual's “yielding” to facts in the service of “self-alteration” is a superior method of self-improvement than group organizing. This ideology is mirrored by and made manifest in McCarthy's unremitting prose, most evidently in ''The Oasis''.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Deborah. “The Virtues of Heartlessness: Mary McCarthy, Hannah Arendt, and the Anesthetics of Empathy.”&lt;/ref&gt;

Reception of ''The Oasis'' has been historically mixed. Response to the novel's earliest incarnation, in ''Horizon'' magazine, was generally positive.&lt;ref&gt;Gornick, Vivian. “The Company They Kept.” The New Yorker.&lt;/ref&gt; American critics, however, were less kind. In a tepid review published by ''[[The New York Times]]'', critic Donald Barr wrote, “readers outside [McCarthy’s] circle can get little from ''The Oasis'' except a vague sense of defamatory brilliance and a few fine scenes.”&lt;ref&gt;Barr, Donald. “Failure in Utopia.” The New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Hannah Arendt looked favorably on ''The Oasis'', calling it “a gem,”&lt;ref&gt;Grumbach. Pg. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; many of McCarthy's closest friends were offended by the novel, most notably those who were implicated in the book's plot. Dwight Macdonald called the book “vicious, malicious, and nasty,” while [[Diana Trilling]] labeled McCarthy “a thug.”&lt;ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.mhpbooks.com/books/oasis/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saul Bellow]] found Rahv's portrayal to be a “stupid caricature,”&lt;ref&gt;Wilford. Pg. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; with Rahv himself threatening to sue McCarthy for [[Defamation|libel]].&lt;ref&gt;Spencer. Pg. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Oasis'' has experienced something of a resurgence in recent years. Melville House reissued the book in 2013 as part of its Neversink Library series, which “champions books from around the world that have been overlooked, under appreciated, looked askance at, or foolishly ignored.”&lt;ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.mhpbooks.com/series/the-neversink-library/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the book has experienced an upswing in scholarly interest over the past thirty years. In her preface to the 2013 edition of ''The Oasis'', [[Vivian Gornick]] wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;“many American critics… pronounced [''The Oasis''] brilliant but heartless. They were wrong. The book is not heartless. It is not out for blood. True, irony inevitably means some fundamental sympathy is being withheld, but the irony here is not savage. Its deliciously witty sentence structure is rooted in the heartfelt disappointment of a moralist whom the reader feels has really wanted the good (that is, the genuine) in our midst to prevail.”&lt;ref&gt;Gornick. “The Company She Kept.”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''The Reading''''' is an oil painting by French painter [[Édouard Manet]], [[circa]] 1865 - 1873.&lt;ref name="Feist"&gt;{{cite book |last=Feist |first=Peter H. |year=2006 |chapter=Salida a escena de una nueva generación |publisher=Taschen |edition=Walther, Ingo H. |title=El impresionismo |language=Spanish |place=Colonia |pages=48,77 |isbn=978-3-8228-5052-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The painting was first exhibited in 1880 in one of the regular solo exhibitions mounted by Manet in his workshop. The picture was also part of the great posthumous exhibition of Manet's work in 1884, a year after his death.

The work first belonged to the private collection of [[Winnaretta Singer]], Princess Edmond de Polignac, where it remained until 1944, after the death of the Princess. It was offered as a gift to the French State and deposited in the [[Musée du Louvre]]. In 1947, it was transferred to the [[Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume]], a showroom located in the [[Jardin des Tuileries]] and which  belongs to the Louvre. It remained there until 1986, when, with the creation of the Musée d'Orsay, it was brought to this museum, like the rest of the collection of Impressionist paintings in the Louvre. It can currently be seen in the [[Musée d'Orsay]], in room 31 of level 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Notice de l'œuvre |url=http://www.musee-orsay.fr/es/colecciones/catalogo-de-obras/notice.html?no_cache=1&amp;nnumid=000706&amp;cHash=1356382807 |publisher=Musée d'Orsay |language=French |accessdate=2 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
The painting depicts the artist's wife, Suzanne Manet (born Suzanne Leenhoff), seated, and their son, Leon, standing and reading a book. Leon was a recurrent model for Manet who portrayed him in several pictures, such as ''The Lunch'', ''The [[Boy Carrying a Sword]]'' and ''The Bubbles of Soap''.

In this work the white woman's dress dominates, and the sofa and curtains are treated with broad strokes of high brightness, in counterpoint to the dark tone of the belt and collar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= VV.AA. |title=Historia del arte: El realismo. El impresionismo |year= 2005 |publisher= Salvat / El País |isbn= 84-471-0336-6 |page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Peter H. Feist, in this painting "Manet reacts more sensitive than usual, and looks especially to shades of white that are offered to his eyes".&lt;ref name="Feist"/&gt;

'''''The Tournament''''' is a major 1812 painting by [[Pierre Révoil]], who presented it to the [[Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon]] (which still owns it) sometime before 1815. It shows the final moments of a legend of [[Bertrand Du Guesclin]], when he reveals his identity after competing anonymously in a [[tournament]] and beating all comers.

The '''UCLA School of the Arts and Architecture''' ('''UCLA Arts''') is a professional school at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]].  Through the four degree-granting departments, it provides a range of course offerings and programs. Additionally, there are eight centers located within the school.
[[Image:UCLA Glorya Kaufman Hall.jpg|thumb|right|Glorya Kaufman Hall at the School of Arts and Architecture]]

==History==
In 1919, UCLA's leadership demonstrated an early commitment to offer students opportunities to explore the arts by the establishment of an art gallery and a music department. But in 1939 the College of Applied Arts was founded with the addition of a Department of Art, followed by the College of Fine Arts in 1960, with degrees available in art, dance, music, and theater arts.

Following academic restructuring in the late 1980s, the [[UC Regents]] formally approved the establishment of two schools: the School of the Arts and the [[UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television|School of Theater, Film and Television]]. In 1994 architecture and urban design joined the School of the Arts, which became the School of the Arts and Architecture (UCLA Arts).

Brett Steele was appointed dean of the School of the Arts and Architecture in 2017.

The '''Wylye Hoard''' is a hoard of [[bronze age]] jewellery, discovered by [[metal detector]]ists in a cultivated field, north-east of the village of [[Wylye, Wiltshire]], England, in 2012. In February 2014, it was declared treasure, under the terms of the [[Treasure Act 1996]].

== Discovery ==

Two members of the "West London Archaeological Searchers", a metal-detecting group, Stuart Gullick and Michael Barker, found the hoard on 4 November 2012.&lt;ref name="Sanigar"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sanigar |first1=Jon |title=The Wylye Hoard Excavation Report|url=http://wiltshireafg.weebly.com/uploads/1/5/5/1/15516698/the_wylye_valley_hoard_excavation_report.pdf |publisher=Wiltshire Archaeology Field Group |accessdate=21 December 2017 |date=2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site was a hilltop location, close to the [[River Wylye]].&lt;ref name="PAS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Record ID: WILT-038191 - Bronze Age Hoard|url=https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/538672|website=The Portable Antiquities Scheme|accessdate=21 December 2017}} [[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50px]] This article contains quotations from this source, which is available under the [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/  Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0)] license.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Composition ==

The find consists of 41 copper alloy objects split across two deposits or concentrations of finds, with a small number of finds found a short distance away. All the objects are of a similar typo-chronology and are likely to represent a single hoard comprising 31 'ornaments', 8 'tools' and 4 'other' or unidentified objects.&lt;ref name="PAS" /&gt;

The artefacts were recovered by the finders from two deposits in close proximity (c.2-3m apart), with two pits subsequently identified by a local amateur archaeology group (the Wiltshire Archaeology Field Group) on 10 November 2012. There was, however, no opportunity to independently date the pit cuts. The first deposit appears to have been a closed deposit, with the finders noting that the torcs were 'stacked' on top of one another within the pit (verbal communication). The second deposit is likely to have been disturbed by agricultural operations as the objects were dispersed across a small area.&lt;ref name="PAS" /&gt;

== Inquest ==

An inquest was held by the Salisbury coroner in February 2014 at which the hoard was declared to be treasure.&lt;ref name="BBC-26141084"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jewellery hoard declared treasure|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-26141084|website=BBC News|accessdate=21 December 2017|date=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After valuation by the [[Treasure Valuation Committee]], the hoard was acquired by Salisbury &amp; South Wiltshire Museum (since renamed [[The Salisbury Museum]]).&lt;ref name="PAS" /&gt;

== Excavation ==

An archaeological excavation of the site was subsequently undertaken by the Wiltshire Archaeology Field Group..&lt;ref name="Sanigar" /&gt; No further objects were found.&lt;ref name="Sanigar" /&gt;
