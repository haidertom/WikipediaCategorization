      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3414">The '''Arts and Humanities Data Service''' ('''AHDS''') was a [[United Kingdom]] national service aiding the discovery, creation and preservation of digital resources in and for research, teaching and learning in the [[arts]] and [[humanities]]. It was established in 1996 and ceased operation in 2008 (although the website and related digital collections are still accessible).

Organised via a Managing Executive at [[King's College London]] and five AHDS Centres, hosted by various UK Higher Education Institutions, the AHDS was funded until the end of March 2008 by the [[Joint Information Systems Committee]] and the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]] (AHRC).  

However, in March 2007 the AHRC decided to cease funding for the AHDS beyond March 2008. As a result, the AHDS is now advising AHRC applicants to ensure their projects include a budget for the costs of preservation and sustainability (whether with the AHDS or another service).

Following the demise of AHDS, and the cessation of the [[Methods Network]], the [[Centre for e-Research (CeRch)]] was established at [[King's College London]] in 2008. The Centre's aims are to facilitate interdisciplinary, institutional, national and international collaboration.

The five subject-based AHDS Centres are:

*[[AHDS Archaeology]] — [[University of York]]
*[[AHDS History]] — [[University of Essex]]
*[[AHDS Literature, Languages and Linguistics]] — [[Oxford University]]
*[[AHDS Performing Arts]] — [[Humanities Advanced Technology and Information Institute|HATII]] at the [[University of Glasgow]]
*[[AHDS Visual Arts]] — [[University for the Creative Arts]] (Farnham campus)

Specific areas of work that the Arts and Humanities Data Service covers include:

*[[digital preservation]] — including a series of [http://ahds.ac.uk/preservation/ahds-preservation-documents.htm preservation handbooks] detailing specific preservation issues with various digital file formats and information on its [http://ahds.ac.uk/preservation/repository.htm digital repository]
*Advice on [[digitization]] — including a series of [http://ahds.ac.uk/creating/case-studies/ case studies] of existing digitization projects, [http://ahds.ac.uk/creating/information-papers/ information papers] on specific issues in digitization, and longer [http://ahds.ac.uk/creating/guides Guides to Good Practice] dealing with digitization topics in particular arts and humanities disciplines
*Online collections created by universities and museums in the UK. These include:
**[http://ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/ An online catalogue] with details of collections held within the archive
**[http://www.ahds.rhul.ac.uk/ahdscollections/ Designing Shakespeare] — 40 years of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespearian]] performance in [[London]] and [[Stratford-upon-Avon|Stratford]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11984">'''Black Theatre Workshop''' is a professional not-for-profit theatre company based in [[Montreal]], and is Canada's oldest Black theatre company in [[Quebec]].

==History==

Black Theatre Workshop was incorporated in 1972 but has roots going back to the [[Trinidad and Tobago]] Drama Committee. [[The Drama Committee was created by Clarence Bayne and Arther Goddard, both of whom were the founders of the Trinidad and Tobago Association and wrote its first Constitution and bylaws]]. [[Dr Bayne invited a number of professional Black Trinidadian artists resident in Montreal in the late sixties (1968) to conduct Black Workshops as part of the activities of the Drama Committee]]. [[It was the Black Workshops under the auspices of the Trinidad and Tobago Association that produced the first professional play of the BTW, written by Professor Lorris Elliott, and named "How Now Black Man". Dr. Bayne was appointed by the Trinidad and Tobago Association to be the Executive Producer of that production and to represent the Association's interest. Except for a brief absence from the company 1970-1972, Dr, Bayne continued to hold  the position of Executive producer and president of the company  for early the formative years of the company between 1973-4 to 1990]]. He negotiated the first professional grant from Canada Council with matching funds from the Multicultural Directorate (Ottawa) that launched the company as a professional theatre company in 1984, making it eligible for funding from all three level of the cultural funding agencies]] &lt;ref&gt;Le Black Theatre Workshop de MOntreal: un nouveau bilan by Clarence Bayne, L'Annuaire theatral 29, Methods en question,  Printemps 2001,  pp 141-155.&lt;/ref&gt;.  The Black Theatre Workshop company is committed to reflecting Black culture and community by developing and providing visibility for Black Canadian artists; and the creation of a Black Canadian theatre and literature. Black Theatre Workshop is an award-winning English-speaking theatre company. [[ Its first play "How Now Black Man" was produced  in 1970 under the name '''Black Workshop''']] at the [[Centaur Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadianencyclopedia.ca/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0012088 Canadian Encyclopedia.]&lt;/ref&gt; But Black [Theatre] [[ Workshop defacto existed from July 17 1968]]. 

Over the years the [[theatre]] has had many artistic directors including[[ Dr.]] Clarence Bayne, [[Errol Sitahal]], Terry Donald, Dwight Bacquie, [[Lorena Gale]], Don Jordan, Winston Sutton, Fleurette Fernando, Nancy Delva, Kate Bligh and Rachael Van Fossen, and [[Tyrone Benskin]]. Since August 2011, the Artistic Director has been Quincy Armorer. He is a graduate of the Theatre Department at Concordia University and also studied at the Birmingham Conservatory for Classical Theatre at the Stratford Festival.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nac-cna.ca/en/bio/quincy-armorer]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==

Black Theatre Workshop's mission is to encourage and promote the development of a Black and Canadian Theatre, rooted in a [[literature]] that reflects the creative will of Black Canadian writers and artists, and the creative collaborations between Black and other artists. Black Theatre Workshop aims to promote and produce Black theatre that educates, entertains and delights its audiences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blacktheatreworkshop.ca/about/who-we-are/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and merits==

Then Executive Director Dr. Clarence Bayne secured a [[Canada Council]] grant in 1976 and contributed new plays for the theater, including The Black Experience, Bonanza 70 and Martin Luther King Who?.

It has also received a Trail Blazer Award (Black History Month Round Table Award) in recognition of its exceptional dedication to the development of the community by promoting cultural diversity, educational awareness and social consciousness.


 
== Dr. Clarence Bayne Community Service Award ==

This award has been created by the Black Theatre Workshop in recognition of and to   honour of the exceptional   dedication and contributions of  Dr Clarence  Bayne to Black arts and culture in Canada; and his tireless  work in the development  of the Black community in Quebec and Canada.  He is an exemplary model of selfless devotion to community and commitment to the creation of a truly  just, equitable and sustainable multicultural  society in Canada.  His contributions span some sixty years and addresses  a wide range of issues and problems  affecting the full participation,  growth and development of  Blacks in Canadian societies.  The Workshop truly believes that his life achievements serve as a guide and motivator to successor generations of Black community leaders. 

Dr. Clarence Bayne is a founding past President of the National Black Coalition of Canada; a founder of the Black Community Council of Quebec; a founder and  member of the Board of Directors of the Queen Elizabeth Health Complex; a collaborator in the creation of the Monkland Community Center (NDG); a founder of the Montreal CEDEC.  He is the Founding Director of the Institute for Community Entrepreneurship  and Development (ICED) , Concordia University, Montreal.  He is a founding member of the Quebec Board of Black Educators and Founding President of the Black Studies Center, Montreal. He is   a founder and Senior Editor in Chief of the International Journal for Community Development and Management Sciences; a Full   professor Emeritus  in the Department of Supply Chain and Business Technology Management. JMSB, Concordia University.  He is widely published in the field of social economy and community development.
   
A crowning achievement is that he is the founder and sitting member and past president of the Black Theatre Workshop of Montreal.  For his selfless volunteer work Dr. Bayne has received  a vast number of awards from numerous community organizations and public institutions; national and international governments: several Governor General Awards including the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Award; The Trinidad and Tobago Commemorative Award on the 50th Anniversary of  the Independence of Trinidad and Tobago; The Black History Month Laureate Award and a special mention  as a member of the community group that spear-headed the naming of February Black History Month in Montreal; a Seniors Montreal Award; The Community Contact Award  as one of  19 Top Contributors to the Black Community of Montreal;  and the prestigious Martin Luther King life time Achievement Award (Black Theatre Workshop).  Dr Bayne is also a published Black poet,essayist, and social critic whose writings appear in several academic journals and publications.
  
Thus,  against this background  and the critical importance of Dr Bayne’s contributions to the creation and development of  Black theatre and culture in Montreal and Canada, making the srts a critical factor in community development  and the building of a better society, the Black Theatre Workshop at each Vision Celebration shines the spot light on volunteerism and community building, by presenting the Dr. Clarence Bayne Community Service Award to someone who demonstrates exemplary selflessness, persistence,  and creative drive in working for the betterment of our community and the creation of a better Canada.

The '''Regional Center for the Promotion of Books in Latin America and Caribbean''' '''(CERLALC)''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish:]] ''Centro Regional para el Fomento del Libro en América Latina y el Caribe''''',''' {{lang-pt|Centro Regional para o Fomento do Livro na América Latina e no Caribe}}) is an [[intergovernmental organization]] sponsored by [[UNESCO]]. The organization's headquarters are located in [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]]. Its main goal is to foster favorable conditions for the development of reading communities in [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]].

CERLALC has 21 member states and the organization aims its activities toward  book production and distribution; the promotion of reading and writing, the training of the actors of the book-publishing process and the stimulation and protection of intellectual creation. In this regard, it provides technical assistance in the formulation of public policies, generates knowledge, disseminates specialized information, develops and promotes training processes and promotes spaces for dialogue and cooperation.

== History ==
The establishment of CERLALC was part of [[UNESCO]]’s program for the promotion of books, which took place during UNESCO’s 14th general conference in Paris, in 1966. The original project included the creation of four centres for the promotion of book production in the world: Latin America, Asia, Africa and the Arab States. The result of this conference was the beginning of one of the most successful experiences in regional integration projects around the book.

On September 7th, 1967, the Colombian government requested UNESCO that the multilateral approaches for book promotion be extended to Latin America in the Program and Budget for the years 1969-1970. The request included the creation of a regional centre for the promotion of books in Latin America as a focal point for efforts aimed at promoting the free circulation and growth of regional book production and distribution.

Through Act 0253 of February 20th, 1970, the Colombian government gave authorization to four local organizations to create the first board of directors of the centre. These organizations were [[Instituto Caro y Cuervo]], Instituto Colombiano de Cultura, Colcultura , Instituto Colombiano para el Fomento de la Educación Superior, [[ICFES]] and Servicio Nacional de Aprendizaje, [[National Training Service (Colombia)|SENA]]. The national organization was named Centro Regional para el Fomento del libro en América Latina, CERLAL. (The second “C” letter was added at a later date). The Ministers of Education and Foreign Affairs, along with the National Planning Department of Colombia, were also part of this board.

On March 3, 1970, the founding act was signed, while decree 2290 established the bylaws of CERLALC as a national organism. Following this, On April 23, 1971, in Bogotá, the Colombian government and UNESCO signed an international cooperation agreement whereby Colombia committed to transforming the organization created in 1970 into a Regional Centre. This instrument allowed the addition of all Spanish-speaking countries. The Colombian congress gave its approval through Law 27 of 1971. Gradually, in the first four years, several countries of the region joint the regional project. These active countries members  have been: Argentina, Bolivia, Brasil, Costa Rica, Chile, Ecuador, Panamá, Paraguay, República Dominicana, Uruguay and Venezuela.

The Agreement of International Cooperation between UNESCO and the Colombian government that governs until today, was signed in Paris on August 1, 1984 and ratified in Colombia by Law 65 of November 20, 1986. In this international agreement, the reach of the centre was extended to other geographic and linguistic areas, including the Caribbean region (Hence the second “C” letter) and to the countries of the Lusitanian Hispanic linguistic unit, even those outside geographical Latin America.

== Milestones ==

* During the 14th session of UNESCO's General conference, the working framework for strengthening book production and traffic throughout developing worlds was formalized. There was an expert assembly convened by UNESCO in 1969, advising the creation in Bogotá, of a Center for the Promotion of the Book in Latin America, helping as a focal point for cooperation to promote the free circulation and growth of production and regional distribution of books.
* In April 23, 1971 the Colombian government and UNESCO signed a mutual international cooperation agreement through which the Colombian government's pledge to turn the local Center, created in 1970, into a regional Center, was approved. When the restructuring was completed, the institution was entirely open to form any bond with all Spanish-speaking countries.
* On the same year, the first actions to promote the Center were undertaken, starting with several training and formation programs focused on publishing production, production seminars and seminars about production and distribution of books. In the same way, the Center, alongside with ALALC (Asociación Latinoamericana de Libre Comercio, the predecessor company to ALADI), developed some activities about information and regional integration.
* In 1975, the growth of the Latin American cooperation network reached an extension of 13 member states. The starting countries were Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Spain, Panama, Paraguay, Dominican Republic, Uruguay, and Venezuela. The network helped create book policies developed by Argentina and Colombia and supported by CERLALC. Additionally, the approach of the integration organisms helped enhance the common market of books, a blueprint for ISBN implementation, along with a number of co-edition and bibliographic database projects.
* In January 1977, the Colombian government and UNESCO renewed the agreement signed in 1971. It would be extended until December 31, 1982.
* In February 1979, in a seminar about Children's book publishing, there was a proposal, which suggested the creation and design of a Latin American co-edition publishing program, focused on children and young adults. The main purpose was to bring a new outreach for regional cultural diversity and broaden the quality of the bid sideways to save costs.
* In August of that same year, during the first Latin American co-edition assembly, the idea grew larger and, in March 1982, the group published its first edition of “Cuentos, mitos y leyendas de América Latina” with a print-run of 20.000 copies.
* In 1982, Cerlal reached an agreement with the International Standard Book Number (ISBN) to promote the use of this identifier in Latin America. The only available agencies were in Mexico (1977) and Brazil (1978), therefore the creation of agencies was encouraged in several countries such as Argentina (1982), Costa Rica (1983), Colombia (1984), Venezuela (1984), Ecuador (1986), Chile(1986), Cuba(1989) Uruguay(1990) and Peru (1995).
* Between 1984 and 1985, the Latin America Traveling Exhibition of Illustrations and Books for Children and Young People was introduced to the public. The CERLALC lead the way to garner greater attention and visibility over children's books, especially illustrated books. This presentation spread the work of graphic illustrators working in the area, increased awareness on the topic in the countries, and inspired the creation of academic programs on illustration.
* In 1988, CERLALC organized a first ISBN agencies meeting in Latin America. In this meeting, all beneficiary countries who had received support, were given a practical seminar on ISBN.
* In 1991, the first ISBN assigning software in Latin America was developed. Following this, in coordination with the ISBN agencies of Venezuela and Colombia, the first version of the Integrated Administration program of ISBN Agencies (PAII) was created.
* In 1993, the Guayaquil type law was drafted and, through this Book law, actions were pursued to promote publishing industries, granting tax exemptions and public purchases. Likewise, this law promoted the intellectual creation, reading promotion, and defense of copyright. It is important to mention this text became a mechanism for the homogenization of the national book legislations standing as an example of standards to Ibero-American lawmakers.
* In August 1994, CERLALC gathered a general meeting, all of the copyright chair holders from the main Latin America universities were invited at the request of UNESCO. In this meeting, UNESCO gave the attending professors relevant information about the UNITWIN program hosted by UNESCO chairs, to set up a network of university lecturers on copyright in the region. On 1995, began the implementation of UNITWIN UNESCO chair program on copyright and related rights in Latin America.
* In 1998, during the 8th Ibero-American Conference of Heads of State and Governments, the Ibero-American Integrated Sales book directory, or ''Repertorio Integrado de Libros en Venta en Iberoamérica'' (RILVI) was created. The main purposes were to collect all the relevant data about the ISBN records and titles linked to national ISBN agencies. The CERLALC was the promoter and main creator of the first regional inventory of editorial offers. On 2010, RILVI stopped being a summit feature program and was turned into a permanent CERLALC activity.
* In 1998, the Ibero-American Cooperation Program on Public Libraries or ''Programa Iberoamericana de Cooperación en materia de Bibliotecas Públicas'' (PICBIP) was created. During the same year, in November, in Cartagena de Indias was held the Ibero-American Encounter of National Managers of Public Libraries. The General Directorate of Books, Archives and Libraries of the Ministry of Education and Culture of Spain, organized and hosted this event, with the sponsorship of the Spanish Agency for International Cooperation or ''Agencia Española de Cooperación Internacional'' (AECI)  and the help of CERLALC. The main goal of this encounter was to start a steady funding mechanism to exchange data, experiences and allow the development of joint actions.
* In 2003, the XIII Summit of Ibero-American Presidents and Heads of State approved the Ibero-American Reading Plan (ILIMITA) at Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia.
* In September 2004, the first Meeting of National Reading Managers was held in Cartagena. In this meeting, the first white paper was presented to the 21 states of Ibero-America. This document included the reading political agenda, which included eleven main concerns about public reading policies. Note should also be taken on the presented recommendations to reach the settled goals, the actions and methods to promote reading throughout an integral perspective which involves the state-will and also to promote a stronger cooperation of different stakeholders on this subject.
* In 2006, the National Network of Reading Plans (Redplanes) was created by a group of entities and people concerned with supporting the search for strategies to streamline policy formulation, and its translation into concrete actions in favor of written culture.
* Also in 2006, a General Experts Assembly was held to discuss the implementation of public policies on copyright. The results of this event, organized by CERLALC, were included in the publication “Diagnosis of copyright in Latin America”. This document outlined the institutional reality of copyright in the region. Also, it highlighted the importance of having an observatory in charge to promote the measurement of the economic impact of creative industries in the region. The results showed that these industries were a key factor for the dissemination of specialized information on copyright. Therefore, it led to the subsequent creation of the Ibero-American Copyright Observatory (ODAI).
* In 2007, the RISBN software was developed. It was a partnership work between CERLALC and the Colombian Book Chamber to develop a software which provided an ease of request to ISBN online. This program would work with all available minimum metadata generated by ONIX.
* In 2010, CERLALC via Ibero-American Copyright Observatory, and a partnership with British council, published two documents named “Creative economy: An introductory guide” and “A practical guide to map the creative industries”. These documents remarked the importance of cultural goods and services in minimizing the impact of political polarization and economic inequality. Simultaneously, these documents gave general guidelines about public policies to measure the impact of creative industries on gross domestic product and job creation, as well as designing promotional strategies for industries protected by copyright in local economies.
* In 2011, a law model, consulted with a group of Ibero-American experts, was presented, its purpose was to give all Latin American countries a mechanism to achieve a formulation for the new book, reading culture and libraries laws. Also, this law model would help deal with the components of the sector in a balanced way, as well as making progress in the construction of reading societies.
* In 2011, the Ibero-American Cooperation Program in Public Libraries (PICBIP) evaluated the overall balance of its first decade, the results showed that the project's scope was limited. Following these results, the Iberbibliotecas Program was created, to contribute to the development and strengthening of public libraries in Latin America.
* In June 2013,CERLAC convened the Intergovernmental Panel “''Nueva Agenda por el libro y la lectura: Recomendaciones para Políticas Públicas en Iberoamerica''”  wherein were presented the further roads to action and suggestions to the local governments regarding book policies. Deputies from 17 states, members and agents from UNESCO, composed this panel during this event, CERLALC identified the most pressing needs of the region to accompany the implementation of the new agenda for books and reading.
* Between 2014 and 2015, there was an important online training course taken by 6.000 educative agents charged with tending to early childhood. The purpose of this course was the promotion of reading, children's literature, art, culture and expressive language skills. This training course was under the framework “''Fiesta de la Lectura''”, sponsored by Instituto Colombiano de Bienestar Familiar (ICBF), whose main aim was to guarantee the conditions for the development of communicative, expressive and reading skills in children from 0 to 6 years of age.
* In November 2015, CERLALC invited five Latin American subject experts on the early childhood sector. These special guests discussed topics related to education, reading culture, and comprehensive care regarding this children population. The attending experts were Eva Janovitz (Mexico), María Emilia López (Argentina), Patricia Pereira Leite (Brazil), Evelio Cabrejo (Colombia) and Yolanda Reyes (Colombia). The discussion highlighted once again the importance of several key aspects for making small children active subjects of practices around written and oral language. As a result, they established the main theoretical guidelines to promote the creation of the Ibero-American Observatory of Culture and Education for the Early Childhood (OPI).
* In 2016, the exhibition “''Contra Viento y Marea''” was held. In it, 150 successful projects from different Latin-American countries were collected. These projects presented government initiatives for the promotion of reading and democratic access to books between the end of the 19th century and the first decade of the 2000s. Besides this, CERLALC celebrated the 30th anniversary of the International Book Fair of Guadalajara, with Latin-America as a guest of honour at the book fair. The second edition of “''Contra Viento y Marea''” was held within the framework of the 30th celebration of Bogotá's Book Fair, 2017.
* In 2017, the VI Meeting of the Ibero-American Network of Policy Makers and Reading Plans was held. During the event, agents from 15 ''Redplanes'' member countries met with regional teams of institutions linked to the National Reading Plan of Chile. The Valparaíso Declaration emerged from this meeting; it reaffirms the importance of strengthening regulatory, legislative and budgetary frameworks to guarantee the continuity of the plans.
* In 2018, the Colombian government implemented a statute to safeguard orphaned literary works. They took into account the basis of a proposal by the CERLALC, presented in 2015 and endorsed by the Centre of academic and political spaces in 2018. The amendment to Law 23 of 1982 on copyright and related rights, made through Law 1915 of 2018, is a tool of special value for promoting the development of libraries in Colombia and implementing new strategies to promote access to a wide diversity of contents for users.

== Action lines ==
To fulfil its main statements, CERLALC leads and supports local and regional actions in the following plans of action.

* '''Consultancy and technical help:'''  The Cerlalc offers a wide variety of services related to its member states. Among these services, it is possible to find design, upgrade and achievement of the publishing industrial policies, libraries systems, reading promotion and copyright.
* '''Investigation:''' The specialized knowledge creation is primarily deemed to inform and follow the consecution of public policies in the Ibero-American region. It also helps to foster strategic decisions with private, public and the civil society sectors around the development of reading societies.
* '''Formation:''' Cerlalc has set the backbone to promote the reading societies throughout programs which fulfill the vital need of technical help in the state members. These programs turn around the reading promotion, libraries and copyright. Besides, these courses, on-site and virtual, are a reliable option to reach general and specific objectives on joint projects.
* '''Publishing:'''The publishing activities are en route to give visibility and dissemination to the researches carried by the Center and its experts' advisors. In addition to the above,  the main focus of these projects is to build an international inventory, in order to develop thinking and the actors' labor of the region and the world.
* '''Projects:''' The articulation of these permanent programs requires cooperation between different sectors in Ibero-American societies. These programs integrate the public and private sectors to achieve the specific objectives that promote knowledge management closely aligned with the center's mission objectives and specialized programs. Cerlalc coordinates the Latin American Observatory of Culture and Early Childhood Education and exercises the functions of the Technical Unit of the Ibero-American Program of Public Libraries (Iberbibliotecas).

'''''Cricket''''', also called '''''Cricket (Hearts and Wickets)''''', is a short musical written by [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] and [[Tim Rice]]. It was commissioned for [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth]]'s 60th birthday celebration, and was first performed at [[Windsor Castle]] on 18 June 1986.

Several of the tunes from the show were later used for ''[[Aspects of Love]]'', so the work was dropped from public performance or recording.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webspace.webring.com/people/oc/camillofan/cricket/musical.html ''Cricket'' – The Musical] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727062109/http://webspace.webring.com/people/oc/camillofan/cricket/musical.html |date=27 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=citron355&gt;Citron, Stephen.

==History==
After their collaboration on ''[[Evita (musical)|Evita]]'' in 1978, composer [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] and lyricist [[Tim Rice]] took what was originally intended to be a temporary break from their illustrious theatrical partnership. They did not work together again until the request for this ''pièce d'occasion'' came up, and ''Cricket'' ended up being their final original musical.

[[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|Prince Edward]], the Queen's youngest son, commissioned a short musical from Lloyd Webber and Rice for his mother's 60th birthday celebration.&lt;ref&gt;Snelson, John. [https://books.google.com/books?id=RRFx7fFsi0AC&amp;pg=PA223&amp;dq=%22a+commission+from+Prince+Edward,+The+Queen's+youngest+son%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PsqDT7etIImriAKar4WABg&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22a%20commission%20from%20Prince%20Edward%2C%20The%20Queen's%20youngest%20son%22&amp;f=false ''Andrew Lloyd Webber'']. Yale University Press, 2009. p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; The game of [[cricket]] was Tim Rice's favourite pastime – he had a cricket field on the grounds of his home and had his own cricket team&lt;ref&gt;Citron, Stephen. ''Sondheim and Lloyd-Webber: The New Musical.'' Oxford University Press, 2001. p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; – and Rice had a particular passion for this new comic musical about England's national sport. Rice used actual cricket-related names for his characters, boosting the light-hearted feeling of the piece. He and Lloyd Webber created a 25-minute tongue-in-cheek "musicalette" for the Queen.

''Cricket'' is entirely [[sung-through]], with no spoken dialogue.

==Summary==
Set against the backdrop of the semi-fictional [[Headingley Stadium#Headingley_Carnegie_Cricket_Ground|Headingley Cricket Club]]'s matches, the comic and slightly melodramatic plot of ''Cricket'' has star player Donald torn between his team and his girlfriend Emma – as she decides to abandon watching cricket for what appears to be a far more exciting life at the race track with the caddish Vincent.

The leads in the cast are Donald, Emma, Emma's father, Vincent, and a West Indian [[Fast bowling|fast-bowler]] from the opposing team named Winston B. Packer. The musical's chorus are the rest of the cricket players.

==Synopsis==
The show begins during a match of Headingley Cricket Club. The game is watched by the Earl of Headingley, his daughter Emma Kirkstall-Lane, and Vincent St. Leger. The Earl and the cricketers sing the praises of cricket. ("The Summer Game")

Emma intends to marry Headingley player Donald Hobbs. And at the moment, even though he is Emma's father, the Earl is more approving of Donald than of Emma, because he feels his daughter is not supportive enough of Donald's cricketing. Emma loves Donald, but she thinks he neglects her somewhat for his cricket playing, and she wants more time together. She feels that she will be forever secondary in Donald's eyes until he retires from cricket. ("As the Seasons Slip Fruitlessly By")

Vincent, who is devoted to horse races, overhears Emma, and offers his own rather self-interested solution: leaving for the races in lieu of the cricket match. Emma is reluctant at first, but decides that maybe Vincent is right, and runs off with him. ("The Sport of Kings") The opposing team's [[Fast bowling|fast bowler]], Winston B. Packer, sings about how wonderful it is to be able to hit batsmen when they miss – and he injures several batsmen during the course of the song. ("The Art of Bowling")

While Donald is batting, he sees Emma leave with Vincent. He's hurt and truly torn – does he stay and bat to help his team win and lose Emma, or does he leave and try to get her back? In the end, sportsmanship prevails: Donald cannot let his team down. But he has been hit a few times during the song, and is suddenly levelled. As he lies dazed on the ground, lines from various people and various moments of the game bombard him – Winston, Emma, Vincent, his team. ("All I Ask of Life")

During the tea interval, Emma returns, dejected, feeling Vincent has deceived her. Not only has she lost all of her money, but she has lost Donald as well. She blames herself, and doesn't see how anyone will ever love her again. ("Fools Like Me")

Donald and the cricketers return to the game after the interval, but Donald ignores Emma. The Earl, however, lets fly at Emma and Vincent. Because of Emma's gambling debts, the Earl has lost his reputation and is in financial distress. Vincent tries to speak, but the Earl turns his attention, and wrath, onto him. The Earl is a powerful member of the [[Jockey Club]], and bans Vincent from all racing events for life. Vincent turns to Emma for sympathy, but she accuses him of deceiving her and getting her into trouble with her father. ("A Ban for Life")

Vincent and Emma's conversation is cut off by a scream. Wittering has been injured and can no longer continue in the game. Headingley CC needs 10 more runs to win, but there is no one to take Wittering's place alongside Donald. The Earl laments the bad day for Headingley. ("Wittering's Final Innings") Vincent suddenly speaks up and says he will take Wittering's place. ("The Making of St. Leger") He joins Donald and the game continues – to the amazement of the cricketers, who believed Vincent had no redeeming qualities. Vincent is beaten up badly during the game, but keeps playing.

Donald's and Vincent's scores win the game and they are both proclaimed heroes. The Earl is so impressed by Vincent's bravery (and recovery of a vital match!) that he withdraws the horse-racing ban. And Donald tells Emma he will play less cricket and spend more time with her. She wonders, could they go to the horse races? Vincent says he will spend Sundays playing cricket. Winston vows to try [[Spin bowling|slow bowling]]. And to top it all off, Wittering is feeling better. ("The Final Stand")

Donald and Emma finish making up, and vow to stay together with a sweeping love ballad which ends in a crescendo that everyone joins into, proclaiming the triumph of the cricket metaphor for life and love. ("One Hot Afternoon")

==Productions==
The show debuted as planned on 18 June 1986 at Windsor Castle, directed by [[Trevor Nunn]] and starring [[Ian Charleson]], [[Sarah Payne (actor)|Sarah Payne]], and [[John Savident]]. The musicians were members of [[Colosseum II]] and others – the ensemble that had first performed Lloyd Webber's ''[[Variations (Andrew Lloyd Webber album)|Variations]]''. The men's vocal group [[Cantabile (group)|Cantabile]] played the cricketers' chorus.

The Windsor Castle performance was quite spirited and amusing, and was very well received. Two more performances followed. One was at Lloyd Webber's [[Sydmonton Festival]] on 15 July 1986. The last performance was in November 1986 at Tim Rice's favourite charity, the [[Lord's Taverners|Lord's Taverners Ball]], where Rice played the cricketer Wittering, dressed in his own Heartaches Cricket Club&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heartaches.co.uk/ Heartaches Cricket Club]&lt;/ref&gt; uniform.

A segment of the original rehearsals of ''Cricket'' was televised on the Andrew Lloyd Webber instalment of ''[[The South Bank Show]]'', which aired on 15 November 1986. The segment featured Sarah Payne and Alvin Stardust rehearsing "As the Seasons Slip Fruitlessly By" and "The Sport of Kings".

There have been no further performances of the musical.

==Original cast==

*[[Ian Charleson]] – Donald Hobbs, devoted cricketer for Headingley Cricket Club
*[[Sarah Payne (actor)|Sarah Payne]] – Emma Kirkstall-Lane, Donald's girlfriend
*[[John Savident]] – the Earl of Headingley, Emma's father, the solicitous patron of the Headingley Cricket Club, and a Steward of the [[Jockey Club]]
*[[Alvin Stardust]] – Vincent St. Leger, a caddish fellow who spends his time betting at horse races
*[[George Harris (actor)|George Harris]] – Winston B. Packer, a lethal [[fast bowling|fast bowler]] originally from the [[West Indies]]
*[[Cantabile (group)|Cantabile]] – Chorus of cricketers
*[[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|HRH Prince Edward]] – Wittering, the gallant last [[batsman]] for Headingley Cricket Club

==After 1986==
Lloyd Webber used at least five of the tunes from ''Cricket'' in his musical ''[[Aspects of Love]]'' (1989).&lt;ref name=citron355 /&gt; This meant that ''Cricket'', which had been extremely well received, was a dead item, a fact that greatly distressed Tim Rice. The piece could thus never be expanded into a full theatrical musical.&lt;ref name=citron355 /&gt; Lloyd Webber used other tunes from ''Cricket'' in ''[[Sunset Boulevard (musical)|Sunset Boulevard]]''.

The ''Cricket'' libretto was published in '''A Breathless Hush ...': The MCC Anthology of Cricket Verse'' (2004). ''Cricket'' has not been recorded for commercial release, although a non-commercial instrumental demo studio album was recorded on solo piano in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[http://castalbumcollector.com/recordings/6803 ''Cricket'' demo recording] at CastAlbumCollector.com&lt;/ref&gt; The performance rights for the piece have not yet been made available.

The men's vocal group [[Cantabile (group)|Cantabile]] recorded "The Summer Game", featuring [[Tim Rice]] singing as the Earl, on their 2011 CD ''Songs of Cricket''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B005BAKU3Q ''Songs of Cricket''] – CD by [[Cantabile (group)|Cantabile]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hugo van der Goes Death of the Virgin.jpg|thumb|340px|''The Death of the Virgin'', c 1472–80. 147.8cm x 122.5cm. [[Groeningemuseum]], [[Bruges]].]]
'''''The Death of the Virgin''''' is an oil on oak panel by the [[Early Netherlandish painting|Flemish]] painter [[Hugo van der Goes]]. Completed c 1472–80, it shows the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] on her deathbed surrounded by the [[Twelve Apostles]]. The scene is borrowed from [[Jacobus de Voragine]]'s thirteenth-century "Legenda aurea"&lt;ref&gt;The Legenda aurea were translated to Dutch around that time as "Passionael" or "die gulden Legende"&lt;/ref&gt; which relates how the apostles were brought, at Mary's request, on clouds by angels to a house near [[Mount Zion]] to be with her in her final three days.&lt;ref name="C250"&gt;Campbell, 250&lt;/ref&gt; On the third day Jesus appeared above her bed in a halo of light surrounded by angels to accept her soul at the point when his name was finally mentioned.&lt;ref name="Rm"&gt;"[http://www.rijksmuseum.nl/catalogue/sk-a-3467.html The death of the Virgin]". [[Rijksmuseum]]. Retrieved 14 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later he reappeared to accept her body.

==History and description==
''Death of the Virgin'' was almost certainly painted on commission and along with his ''[[:File:Hugo van der goes monforte altarpiece detail 01.jpg|Monforte]]'' and ''[[Portinari Altarpiece|Portinari]]'' altarpieces is one of van der Goes most important works. It is likely one of his last paintings finished before he died. According to art historian [[Till-Holger Borchert]], the panel "belongs to the most impressive and artistically mature achievements of [[Early Netherlandish painting]]".&lt;ref name="TH161"/&gt; According to [[Lorne Campbell (art historian)|Lorne Campbell]], the painting is van der Goes' "most idiosyncratic masterpiece".&lt;ref name="C252"&gt;Campbell, 252&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary is shown lying in a blue robe with a white headdress on a timber bed with her head resting on a white pillow against a headboard. Her skin is thin and pallid, her hands clasped in prayer. She is surrounded by the twelve apostles who crowd around her bed. Peter is dressed in the white robes of a priest and holds a candle which in the then contemporary ritual will be handed to the dying woman. Above her Christ appears in a halo of light, holding his arms open to receive Mary's soul,&lt;ref&gt;In some earlier depictions her soul is represented as a small child&lt;/ref&gt; while his palms are open to display the [[Holy Wounds|wounds]] sustained at [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Calvary]]. With this gesture, Christ identifies himself as both [[Redeemer (Christianity)|redeemer]] and conqueror of death.&lt;ref name="TH161"&gt;Borcher, 161&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Death'' marks a break in van der Goes style; line has become more important, setting is eliminated and the image lacks depth and is tightly contracted with only the bed, door and the body of the Virgin giving spatial indicators.&lt;ref name="SK"&gt;Koslow, Susan. "[http://profkoslow.com/publications/DeathoftheVirgin.html The Impact of the Modern Devotion on Hugo van der Goes's Death of the Virgin]". College of Art Association of America, Washington D.C., 1978. Retrieved 14 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It is renowned for not showing the apostles either in the traditional idealised manner nor as conventional figure types, but instead representing each as a unique individual, displaying their grief through a range of expressions and gestures, from sorrow and despair, to empathy and compassion. Because the artist has not used traditional representation it is difficult to identify each apostle.&lt;ref&gt;Borcher, 161-2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Het sterfbed van Maria Rijksmuseum SK-A-3467.jpeg|thumb|left|300px|c 1500 copy of the Berlin work attributed to the [[Master of the Amsterdam Death of the Virgin]], a follower of van der Goes. [[Rijksmuseum]], Amsterdam.]]
The work is the best known and famous of one of a number of paintings after the death of Mary attributed to van der Goes or followers. Some art historians, including Friedrich Winkler (1964), believe he painted at least three versions, although it is generally accepted that preparatory sketches made for the Bruges work were later copied reproduced as paintings by late 15th century followers. Two similar paintings in the [[Berlin State Museums]], the [[National Gallery]], London, are attributed as "after van der Goes". They are usually thought to be later versions of a pen on paper drawing in the [[Herzog Anton Ulrich Museum]], [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]], probably a copy of an original preparatory sketch by van der Goes.&lt;ref name="C250"/&gt; These works are similar to the Bruges paintings, but show the image in reverse.&lt;ref group="notes"&gt;The London painting is likely in turn a copy again of the Berlin work. See Campbell, 250&lt;/ref&gt; Infra-red photography shows that the composition was planned a highly detailed manner before the underdrawing was applied. Art historian Lorne Campbell writes, "it is possible that the Brunswick drawing reflects one of his earliest ideas for the Bruges painting and that the Berlin, Prague and London pictures echo, however distantly, a later stage in his development of the Bruges composition.&lt;ref name="C251"&gt;Campbell, 251&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Martin Schongauer The Death of the Virgin.jpg|210px|thumb|[[Martin Schongauer]], ''The Death of the Virgin'', engraving, early 1470s.]]
The painting has been the subject of intense debate as to its date and meaning. Van der Goes spent the final years of his life submerged in depression. A number of art historians, including [[Max Jakob Friedländer|Max Friedländer]], view the work as painted c. 1480 when the artist first began to display signs of mental suffering and thus view it as an expression of his illness. The artist's late life—he died in either 1482 or 1483—susceptibility to depression and insanity was discovered in 1863 in a chronicle by his contemporary Gaspar Ofhuys, who recorded a night in 1480 when van der Goes began to excitedly talk about how he was a doomed, lost soul and attempted to commit suicide and had to be forcibly held down.

This account greatly added to the painting's value in the eyes of late-19th-century painters. [[Vincent van Gogh]] mentions van der Goes three times in his letters, first in 1873 to his brother Theo, and on two more occasions when he wrote that he identified with the portrait of van der Goes in [[Emile Wauters]]'s emotionally rendered 1872 painting ''Hugo van der Goes Undergoing Treatment at the Red Cloister''.&lt;ref name="SK"/&gt; Art historian [[Erwin Panofsky]] described van der Goes as "the first artist to live up to a concept unknown to the Middle Ages but cherished by the European mind ever after, the concept of a genius both blessed and cursed with his diversity from ordinary human beings." Panofsky goes on to describe how the work's flatness represents an "irrationality of space, light, colour, [the] expression of the artist's mental illness".&lt;ref name ="R124"&gt;Ridderbos, Bernhard. "Early Netherlandish paintings: rediscovery, reception and research". Los Angeles: Getty Publishing, 2005. 124. {{ISBN|0-89236-816-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other art historians, including Dirk de Vos and Susan Koslow, reject this thesis and argue that a wholly individualised conception of the scene would not have been acceptable to the painting's commissioners. In their view the pared down and contracted manner of the work is due to a desire to "stress the solemnity of the event and its miraculous nature, van der Goes may have decided that material richness would be distracting and indecorous."&lt;ref name ="R124"/&gt;

Van der Goes was a highly progressive and original artist, but at the same time heavily influenced by both contemporary and predecessor artists. Inspiration for this work can be detected in [[Petrus Christus]]' c 1457–67 ''Death of the Virgin''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Petrus_Christus_Death_of_the_Virgin.jpg|title=English: Death of the Virgin|first=Petrus|last=Christus|publisher=|via=Wikimedia Commons}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="C252" /&gt; and by works attributed to the workshop of [[Rogier van der Weyden]].&lt;ref name="B162"&gt;Borcher, 162&lt;/ref&gt; The painting bears striking similarity to [[Martin Schongauer]]'s c 1470–75 engraving of the same name, especially in its overall tone and mood, the depiction of Mary and the representation of the apostles seated to Mary's left. Yet there are significant differences; the bed in Schongauer's engraving is canopied and the distribution of the apostles is very different in the two works. The Schongauer is dated to at latest 1475, and it is a matter of significant and at times harsh and divisive critical debate as to which work came first (see above).&lt;ref name="B162"/&gt;

'''''Della mercatura e del mercante perfetto''''' written by [[Benedetto Cotrugli]] around 1400 was the first [[bookkeeping]] [[manuscript]] and trade manual.&lt;ref name="item 1441"&gt;[[#Anzovin|Anzovin, 2000]], p. 36, item 1441&lt;/ref&gt; The title has been translated in English by the alternate names of ''Of commerce and the perfect merchant'',&lt;ref name="item 1441"/&gt; ''On merchantry and the perfect merchant'',&lt;ref name="Zubrinic"&gt;[http://www.croatianhistory.net/etf/et22a1.html History of Croatian Science, 15th-19th centuries]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''On trade and the perfect dealer.''&lt;ref name="Financial Essay"&gt;[http://www.oxbridgewriters.com/essays/accounting/financial-accounting-accountants.php Essay title - Financial Accounting And Accountants]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Several historians show that, since the manuscript was written in 1458, it is the oldest known manuscript on the [[double-entry bookkeeping system]], and, as such, predates [[Luca Pacioli]]'s book by at least 36 years.&lt;ref name="Zubrinic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Financial Essay"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AccountingHistory"&gt;[http://www.promonegocios.net/contabilidad/historia-contabilidad.html Accounting History]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.croatianhistory.net/etf/siesc2.html SIESC 2007 in CROATIA]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chapter XIII"&gt;''In Chapter XIII of the 1st book is called "order to keep " the records marketable '. There are only very vague rules, and the author observes: "..... narrating everything here wanting to '1 minute 'treatment would be too verbose et almost impossible to express it, "that without the living voice, writing can hardly be impa" rare. " However, one can easily argue that Benedict Cotrugli want to talk about the double entry. He says that the scriptures remind you credit, debt, cost of goods, profits and losses and any other cenda ago, adds that the merchant must hold the memorial, the newspaper, and the notebook with its own alphabet, which devesi entered in the log, what to do, the Whole capital and bring everything to your file. 'S work of the merchant Ragusin was not amended in the audience, Luca Pacioli is no longer the first exhibitor of record keeping.'' [[#Alfieri|Alfieri, 1891]], p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely thought that the reason why Luca Pacioli (1445–1517) received credit as the father of accounting is because Cotrugli's work was not officially published until 1573.&lt;ref&gt;[http://html.rincondelvago.com/evolucion-historica-de-la-contabilidad.html Historical evolution of accounting]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://paciolicode.com/ 3.

The first English translation of the Libro de l'arte de la mercatura (The Book of the Art of Trade) edited by Carlo Carraro and Giovanni Favero, with a foreword by Niall Ferguson, Professor of History at Harvard University, has been published by Palgrave Mcmillan in 2017, based on the critical edition of the original manuscripts made by Vera Ribaudo, University of Venice, published on May 2016 by Edizioni Cà Foscari, Venice. 

== Manuscript content ==
The manuscript contains four books. The first is of the origin, form, and essence of being a [[merchant]]. The second talks of a merchant's religious commitment. The third is of moral virtues and policies. The fourth is administration of his home and family, and his economic matters.&lt;ref name="Chapter XIII"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hangers|Hangers, 1803]], p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the manuscript merchandising was regarded as an art. The "Perfect Merchant" or "Perfect Dealer" was a man of culture motivated  
to good moral conduct and honest transactions to everyone he encountered. He had to be very sensitive to local interests in places where he conducted business. He had to know how to assess the political situation and the customary laws in order to successfully conduct his business. Kotruljević wrote in his bookkeeping and merchandising trade manual that not only must a merchant be a [[bookkeeper]]-[[accountant]], but that he must also be a good writer, a [[rhetorician]] and a [[Intellectual#Men of letters|man of letters]] being diplomatic all the while.&lt;ref name="conduct"&gt;[http://www.cliffordawright.com/caw/food/entries/display.php/topic_id/30/id/123/ Markets of the Mediterranean]&lt;/ref&gt;

He contrasted the "Perfect Merchant" to sailors and soldiers by saying that they were many times naive of these points. He said they were of such dull mind that when they would drink in a tavern and buy bread at a market they often had [[grandiose delusions|delusions of grandeur]] and were not very diplomatic.&lt;ref name="conduct"/&gt;

'''Didacticism''' is a philosophy that emphasizes instructional and informative qualities in [[literature]] and other types of [[art]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/2940819/Whats_Wrong_with_Didacticism What’s Wrong with Didacticism?] Academia.edu, Retrieved 30 Oct 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://coursesite.uhcl.edu/HSH/Whitec/terms/D/didactic.htm Didactic Literature or Didacticism], [[University of Houston–Clear Lake]], Retrieved 30 Oct 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The term has its origin in the [[Ancient Greek]] word διδακτικός (''didaktikos''), "related to [[education]] and teaching", and signified learning in a fascinating and intriguing manner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://repository.upenn.edu/dissertations/AAI8315998/ RELIGIOUS AWAKENING STORIES IN LATE MEDIEVAL JAPAN: THE DYNAMICS OF DIDACTICISM], Retrieved 30 Oct 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Didactic art was meant both to entertain and to instruct. Didactic plays, for instance, were intended to convey a moral theme or other rich truth to the audience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://literarydevices.net/didacticism/ Didacticism in Morality Plays], Retrieved 30 Oct 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uncp.edu/home/canada/work/allam/general/glossary.htm#d Glossary of Literary Terms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103044158/http://www.uncp.edu/home/canada/work/allam/general/glossary.htm |date=2013-11-03 }}, The University of North Carolina at Pembroke, Retrieved 30 Oct 2013&lt;/ref&gt; An example of didactic writing is [[Alexander Pope]]'s ''[[An Essay on Criticism]]'' (1711), which offers a range of advice about critics and criticism. An example of didactism in music is the chant ''[[Ut queant laxis]]'', which was used by [[Guido of Arezzo]] to teach [[Solfège|solfege]] syllables.

Around the 19th century the term ''didactic'' came to also be used as a criticism for work that appears to be overburdened with instructive, factual, or otherwise educational information, to the detriment of the enjoyment of the reader (a meaning that was quite foreign to Greek thought). [[Edgar Allan Poe]] called didacticism the worst of "heresies" in his essay ''[[The Poetic Principle]]''.

==Examples==
Some instances of didactic literature include:
* ''[[Works and Days]]'', by [[Hesiod]] (c.&amp;nbsp;700 BC) 
* ''[[On Horsemanship]]'', by [[Xenophon]] (c.&amp;nbsp;350 BC)

{{no footnotes|date=July 2018}}
'''Enfleurage''' is a process that uses odorless fats that are solid at room temperature to capture the [[fragrance | fragrant]] compounds exuded by [[plants]]. The process can be "cold" enfleurage or "hot" enfleurage.

== Process ==
There are two types of processes:
*In '''cold enfleurage''', a large framed plate of glass, called a chassis, is smeared with a layer of animal fat, usually [[lard]] or [[tallow]] (from [[pork]] or [[beef]], respectively), and allowed to set. Botanical matter, usually [[petals]] or whole [[flower]]s, is then placed on the fat and its scent is allowed to diffuse into the fat over the course of 1–3 days. The process is then repeated by replacing the spent botanicals with fresh ones until the fat has reached a desired degree of fragrance saturation. This procedure was developed in southern France in the 18th century for the production of high-grade concentrates.
*In '''hot enfleurage''', solid fats are heated and botanical matter is stirred into the fat. Spent botanicals are repeatedly strained from the fat and replaced with fresh material until the fat is saturated with fragrance. This method is considered the oldest known procedure for preserving plant fragrance substances.

In both instances, once the fat is saturated with fragrance, it is then called the "enfleurage [[pomade]]".  The enfleurage pomade was either sold as it was, or it could be further washed or soaked in [[ethyl alcohol]] to draw the fragrant molecules into the alcohol.  The alcohol is then separated from the fat and allowed to evaporate, leaving behind the [[Absolute (fragrance)|absolute]] of the botanical matter. The spent fat is usually used to make [[soaps]] since it is still relatively fragrant.

== Other fragrance extraction methods ==
{{See also|Fragrance extraction}}
The enfleurage fragrance extraction method is one of the oldest. It is also highly inefficient and costly but was the sole method of extracting the fragrant compounds in delicate flowers such as [[jasmine]] and [[tuberose]], which would be destroyed or [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denatured]] by the high temperatures required by methods of fragrance extraction such as [[steam distillation]]. The method is now superseded by more efficient techniques such as [[solvent extraction]] or [[supercritical fluid extraction]] using liquid [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) or similar compressed gases.

'''Eyedrum Art &amp; Music Gallery''' is a [[non-profit]] [[art space]] and [[Music venue|venue]] in [[Atlanta]], Georgia, founded by American painter [[Woody Cornwell]] and musician and journalist Marshall Avett, and focused on [[contemporary art]] and [[experimental music]] ranging from contemporary [[chamber music]] and [[sound sculpture]] to [[drone music|drone noise music]] and [[art rock]]. Until January 1, 2011, the organization was located in the [[Old Fourth Ward]] district, and had three art gallery spaces and one space for music and performance. It hosted approximately 180 events yearly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.ajc.com/inside-access/2009/09/27/eyedrum-revitalized-new-leadership-more-community-support-planned-capital-campaign-maybe-a-new-space/ article] in [[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]&lt;/ref&gt; Established in 1998, Eyedrum is one of the longest-running art and performance spaces in Atlanta managed by volunteers.

Eyedrum often organizes events in collaboration with community partners, including the annual Listening Machines events with [[Georgia Institute of Technology]], [[Henry W. Grady High School]] art department, and The [[Film Love]] series of art films. Besides visual art exhibitions and performances it also hosts films, lectures, and other related activities. It hosts a monthly [[improvised music|improvisation night]] focused on exploration of experimentation in music and sound. In the past the music arm of the organization hosted the [[Table of the Elements]] Festival and [[the Rogue Independent Music Festival]]. Live performances from various acts such as [[Ken Lockie]], [[Hubcap City]], [[Bill Taft]], and [[Tunnels]] were recorded at Eyedrum and later released as live albums. 

Eyedrum Art &amp; Music Gallery is the parent organization of an arts journal ''Eyedrum Periodically''. Published quarterly and online, the magazine offers literary works (poetry, fiction, and essays), visual arts, and works in sound and multimedia in accordance with a succession of themes. Submitting artists may interpret these themes both literally and figuratively. Themes for the first year of publication included "Im/Permanence," "Monsters," In the Streets," and "Drones." The journal is administered by Founding Editor Colleen M. Payton (aka Miriam C. Jacobs), while each issue is managed individually, as are Eyedrum's gallery curations and performance events, by a revolving Lead Editor. Lead editors for the first year, along with Payton, include Hester L. Furey and [[Bill Taft]]. The magazine publishes an annual print edition, ''Best of Eyedrum Periodically''.

Eyedrum's structure is unique in that it is an all-volunteer organization with no paid staff. The board of directors is a working board, with members meeting monthly and handling virtually every aspect of running the space, including programming, promotions, accounting, fundraising, and janitorial duties.

'''Filipino American Theater''' ranges from topics such as [[Filipino people|Filipino]]/[[Filipino-American]] history to modern Filipino issues. The themes for these works were mostly influenced by the Spanish colonial rule as well as the [[American settlement in the Philippines|American colonization]]. 

Philippine theater is composed of pre-colonial performance traditions as well as colonial influences from Spain and the USA. 

Some common subject matter tackled by Filipino theater focuses on the [[History of the Philippines (1898–1946)|historical background of the Philippines]] and the relationship between the [[Philippines]] and the [[United States]]. Some Filipino American productions provides personal, societal and cultural perspective from the past to now. 

==Themes in Filipino American theater==

Some themes for Filipino-American theatrical works are focused on the historical background of the country such as the [[Philippine–American War|Filipino-American War]], [[Martial law|Martial Law]] and the dawn of Filipino independence. 

==Influences in the development of Philippine theater==
The earliest form of theatrical work started with indigenous theater which mainly performs “rituals”. Although these rituals may seem purely cultural, there is also a huge religious influence over these rituals and to this day they are still practiced by specific groups. Other than tribal rituals there are also tribal dances that are practiced depict significant tribal activities within the community.

During the Spanish colonial rule within 1565 to 1898, Filipinos never failed to find a way to cope with this regime.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During the colonization of Spain, [[Christianity]] heavily influenced the lives of [[Filipinos]] which lead to religious pieces and performances throughout the country. One form influenced by [[Spain]] is called ''komedya'' which varies between two themes: the secular and the religious.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, a play called ''Tibag'' which talks about the search of Elena and Constantino for the Cross of Christ is still performed in some towns.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another religious form is the ''sinakulo'' or commonly called the [[Passion of Jesus|passion of Christ]] which is usually performed during the [[Lent|Lenten season]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Between 1878 or 1879 another form of performance called ''sarsuwela'' was introduced to Filipinos.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tiongson|first=Nicanor G.|date=Jun 8, 2009|title=Dulaan, an Essay on Philippine Theater|url=http://nlpdl.nlp.gov.ph:81/CC01/NLP00VM052mcd/v7/v1.pdf|journal=Cultural Center of the Philippines|volume=|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main theme of ''sarsuwela'' revolves around the love story between different social classes which made the dramatization more interesting.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ''Dalagang Bukid'' (''1919)'', was the most popular piece of ''sarswela'' within the culture.

During the 19th century, Spain introduced ''drama'' which is a play that is usually done within one act. ''Drama'' mainly focuses on the contemporary lives of Filipinos. ''Drama'' had three subgroups which included: (1) melodrama which aimed to make people cry, (2) comedy which aimed for people to laugh and (3) drama simboliko which taught the audience some symbolism within the storyline.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==American influences in the development of Philippine theater==
From 1901 to 1946, the American colonial regime affected Filipino theater.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; On November 4, 1901 the Sedition Act was enacted in the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ww6XgU2dxZ0C&amp;pg=PA221&amp;lpg=PA221&amp;dq=seditious+and+subversive:+theater+of+war&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4n4X_btyEV&amp;sig=4k8ESfTXkMpn9bX4FfPo5PRQZVs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjCxrDb2rrTAhUk_4MKHU_yBG0Q6AEIMDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=seditious&amp;f=false|title=Narrating Race: Asia, (Trans) Nationalism, Social Change|last=Goh|first=Robbie B. H.|date=2011-01-01|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=9401207089|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this law it was prohibited for any type of media or speech to go against the United States.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}  

During the 1930s Filipinos were exposed to western theater and western classics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During this time, Filipinos adapted to American culture and to American theatrical standards. One influence from the occupation is the development of the performance form called ''bodabil''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which is the vernacular equivalent of "vaudeville." Bodabil is more of a mixture of songs and other type of performances that were popular in the United States. 

==Filipino American theater groups==
One Filipinos American theater company is Ma-Yi Theater Company, started in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crienahouse.com/single-post/2016/10/24/Contribution-of-Filipinos-to-American-Theater-Part-2-Legit-Theater|title=Contributions of Filipinos to American Theater, Part 2: Legit Theater|last=House|first=Criena|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1991 the National Asian American Theater Co., Inc (NAATCO) was founded and is also a company that involves Filipino American plays and Filipino American casts. Another organization that organizes Filipino playwrights is Sining Bayan.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Filipino American Productions==

Sining Bayan has staged the play "Isuda Ti Muna/They Who Were First" in 1973. It mainly encircles the lives of Filipino agricultural workers in central California. The following year ''Mindanao'' (1974) came out in which talks about the land rights if Filipino Muslims and farmers in Mindanao.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Asian American Playwrights|last=Liu|first=Miles Xian|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=343}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976 a play called ''Tagatupad'' came out with a focus on the struggles of antieviction laws within the working class Filipino community.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; One of the most controversial plays within this time called ''[[Ann Arbor Hospital Murders|The Frame Up of Narciso and Perez]] (1979)'' basically focuses on the murder of Narciso and Perez’ patients at a Veterans Administration Hospital.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Within the same year, ''Visions of a War bride (1979)'' focused on a Filipina that came to the United States as a war bride.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Years later ''Ti Mangyuna (1981)'' led by a collaboration between the KDP and ILWU Local 142 of Hawaii headlined throughout the community.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; With its goal to educate the audience about labor-union drive’s. 

In 1990 ''[[Dogeaters]]'' by Jessica Hagedorn was published which works well as a playwright.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Puro Arte|last=San Pablo Burns|first=Lucy Mae|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Dogeaters]]'' talks about political and cultural issues within that time.

== Issues in the Filipino American Theater Community ==
When the first group of Filipinos joined the theater community they also received a lot of backlash. One of the most common instances are racial issues. One of the most popular plays that had a lot of Filipino actors, ''Miss Saigon,'' had the issue of casting a white actor for an Asian role (113).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Puro Arte|last=San Pablo Burns|first=Lucy Mae|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this, it exposed the history of yellow face within the theater community. 

Another issue that was faced due to ''Miss Saigon'' was when it had its own production in the Philippines. [[JV Ejercito|J.V Ejercito]], the owner of the production of ''Miss Saigon'', became a member of the Philippine congress. J.V Ejercito’s background stirred up controversies since his father [[Joseph Estrada]] was still in power when the production was going on.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The public implied that the production gained it money not through profit but through politics and free enterprise.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Puro Arte|last=San Pablo Burns|first=Lucy Mae|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the production of ''Miss Saigon'', the international work force for Filipinos was also rising. Filipinos were seen as Little Brown Fucking Machines (LBFM) my military men thus giving Filipinos the roles of prostitutes within plays.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Because of ''Miss Saigon'', Filipinos were then seen as maids and domestic helpers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Puro Arte|last=San Pablo Burns|first=Lucy Mae|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Filipino American Productions in Universities ==
Pilipino Cultural Night (PCN) is an event mostly organized by students in which they express cultural aspects through theatrical mediums. It was established in 1972 to celebrate the Filipino American community at California State University.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lbpcnwebmaster.wixsite.com/lbpcn|title=Long Beach Pilipino Cultural Night|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; California State University had their first PCN with the theme: “Anyong Pilipino: Portrait of the Pilipino”.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Around the 1980s, PCN incorporated folklore dance to theatrical narratives.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Day the Dancers Stayed: Performing the Filipino/American Diaspora|last=Gonzalves|first=Theodore S.|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the University of Hawai’i, the Fil-Am club sponsored an event called Gabi ng Pilipino (Filipino Night).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; It featured popular dance and musical presentations from late 1970’s to mid-1980’s.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

'''''Finding Dawn''''' is a 2006 [[documentary film]] by [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] filmmaker [[Christine Welsh]] looking into the fate of an estimated 500 [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Canadian Aboriginal]] women who have been [[Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women|murdered or have gone missing]] over the past 30 years.&lt;ref name="CSWS"/&gt;

==Subject==
The film begins with the story of Dawn Crey: one of 60 women, a third of them Aboriginal, who have disappeared from [[Vancouver]]'s [[Downtown Eastside]] over a 20-year period. Crey's remains were among those found on the property of British Columbia serial killer [[Robert Pickton]].&lt;ref name="Herizons"&gt;{{cite journal|last=O'CONNOR |first=JENNIFER|date=Winter 2009 |title=FINDING DAWN|journal=Herizons|publisher=Bnet|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_7554/is_200901/ai_n32313401/?tag=content;col1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Georgia Straight"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.straight.com/article/metis-filmmaker-christine-welsh-can-be-proud-of-her-showing-at-the-amnesty-international-film-festival|title=Métis filmmaker Christine Welsh can be proud of her showing at the Amnesty International Film Festival|date=November 9, 2006|work=[[Georgia Straight]]|accessdate=26 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not enough of Dawn's DNA was found to list her as one of the murder victims at the trial. The film introduces viewers to Dawn sister and brother, and their involvement in the annual [[Women’s Memorial March]] in Vancouver.&lt;ref name="CM"&gt;{{cite journal|last=de Vos|first=Gail |date=January 11, 2008 |title=FINDING DAWN|journal=Canadian Materials|publisher=Manitoba Library Association|volume= XIV |issue= 10|url=http://www.umanitoba.ca/outreach/cm/vol14/no10/findingdawn.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film then focuses on BC's Highway 16, known as the [[Highway of Tears murders|Highway of Tears]], which runs between [[Prince Rupert, British Columbia]] and [[Prince George, British Columbia]], looking at the fate of Ramona Wilson.&lt;ref name="CM"/&gt; Wilson was one of nine women&amp;nbsp;– all but one of them Native&amp;nbsp;– who have gone missing or been murdered on that stretch of road since the 1990s.

Welsh also filmed in [[Saskatoon]], where a woman named Daleen Kay Bosse disappeared in 2004. She went missing in May but a criminal investigation didn't begin until the following January.&lt;ref name="Herizons"/&gt; In the film, Daleen’s parents and friends talk about their difficulty in getting Saskatoon police to take Daleen’s disappearance seriously.&lt;ref name="CM"/&gt;

Native rights activists [[Janice Acoose]] and [[Fay Blaney]] are interviewed in the film.&lt;ref name="Herizons"/&gt;

Christine Welsh has produced, written and directed films for more than 30 years. She is an associate professor at the [[University of Victoria]], where she teaches courses in indigenous women’s studies and [[indigenous cinema]].&lt;ref name="CSWS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csws.uoregon.edu/?p=1097 |title=Acclaimed Feminist Filmmaker To Screen "Finding Dawn" |last= |first= |date= |publisher=[[University of Oregon]] |work=[[Center for the Study of Women in Society]] |accessdate=26 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508140428/http://csws.uoregon.edu/?p=1097 |archivedate=8 May 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ganjifa''', '''Ganjapa''' or '''Gânjaphâ''',&lt;ref&gt;Many different spellings and transliterations can be found, such as Ganjafa, Ghendgifeh, Gunjeefa, [[Ganjapa]], Kanjifa, Kanjifah and so on. In arabic, the spellings كنجفة or جنجفة or غنجفه can be found. The [[Persian language|Persian]] word is ''ganjifeh'' (گنجفه). In Hindi the term is गंजीफा.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[card game]] or type of [[playing card]]s that are most associated with Persia and India. After Ganjifa cards fell out of use in Iran before the twentieth century, India became the last country to produce them.&lt;ref&gt;At the start of the 21st Century production in India was still ongoing in the town of [[Sawantvadi]] in the west, and [[Odisha]] in the east for example. See Abram (2003: 53) and Crestin-Billet (2002: 189).&lt;/ref&gt; The form prevalent in Odisha is [[Ganjapa]].

==Description==
Ganjifa cards are circular or rectangular,&lt;ref&gt;A rectangular example dated to around 1770 is held in the collection of the Bibliothèque Nationale de France. See http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b55007315w/f13.item&lt;/ref&gt; and traditionally hand-painted by [[artisan]]s. The game became popular at the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] court, and lavish sets were made, from materials such as precious stone-inlaid ivory or tortoise shell (''darbar kalam''). The game later spread to the general public, whereupon cheaper sets (''bazâr kalam'') would be made from materials such as [[wood]], [[palm tree|palm leaf]], stiffened cloth or pasteboard. Typically Ganjifa cards have coloured backgrounds, with each suit having a different colour. Different types exist, and the designs, number of suits, and physical size of the cards can vary considerably. With the exception of Mamluk Kanjifa and the Chads of Mysore, each suit contains ten [[Pip (counting)|pip cards]] and two [[face card|court cards]], the king and the [[vizier]] or minister. The backs of the cards are typically a uniform colour, without patterning.

==History==

===Etymology===
The earliest origins of the cards remain uncertain, but Ganjifa cards as they are known today are believed to have originated in [[Persia]]. The first syllable is attributed to the Persian word 'ganj' meaning treasure. Gen. [[Albert Houtum-Schindler|Houtum-Schindler]] suggested to [[Stewart Culin]] that the last two syllables in the word 'Ganjifa' may be derived from the Chinese chi-p'ai, meaning playing cards &lt;ref&gt;(Culin p928)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andy Pollett covers this line of argument on http://a_pollett.tripod.com/cards25.htm (retrieved 03/01/2015).&lt;/ref&gt; In a related passage [[William Andrew Chatto|Chatto]] explains that an early Chinese term was 'ya-pae', meaning 'bone ticket', and that the term 'che-pae' came later, meaning literally 'paper ticket'(1848: 58). These different terms could account for the different spellings and pronunciations of 'Ganjifa'. Rolf Zimmermann goes further in his 2006 article, and suggests that the first syllable of the word Ganjifa could come from 'Han' as in [[Han Chinese]], and thus 'Ganjifa' would mean 'han-chi-pai', or '[[Chinese playing cards]]'.&lt;ref&gt;(Retrieved from Szent István tér on 03/01/2015)&lt;/ref&gt; These remain unproved theories, but the 18th century traveller [[Carsten Niebuhr]] claimed to have seen Arabian merchants in Bombay playing with Chinese cards.&lt;ref&gt;(Niebuhr 1774: 173)&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century [[Johann Ludwig Burckhardt|Jean Louis Burckhardt]] visited Mecca and wrote that 'cards are played in almost every Arab coffee-house (they use small Chinese cards)'.&lt;ref&gt;(Burckhardt 1829: 377)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ganjifa became popular in [[India]] under the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperors in the 16th century. The term has been used at times in many countries throughout the Middle East and western Asia. In Kuwait, the word 'Janjifah' has become a general term and so is applied to the internationally known [[French playing cards|French deck]].&lt;ref&gt;In Arabic and Persian, there exists also the more general word for playing cards, 'waraq' ( ورق ). This word can be found in texts that may refer to Ganjifa cards. For example in the 16th century work, the Humayun-namah, about the Mughal emperor [[Humayun]], this term 'waraq' is used. The text describes a gambling game that was played during celebrations upon Humayun's return to [[Kabul]] in 1545. The game involved twelve players, each with twenty cards. Refer Beveridge (1902: 178, or 77 in the Persian section of the book).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arabic sources and surviving cards===
[[File:Mamluk kanjifah cards.png|thumb|320px|Four Mamluk playing cards]]
Despite the significance of Persia in the history of ganjifa cards, the very earliest known text reference ([[Ibn Taghribirdi]]) and card specimens ([[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk era]]) are from Egypt.

An exhibition in the British museum in 2013 noted "Playing cards are known in Egypt from the twelfth century AD. Ganjafeh was a popular card game in Iran and the Arab world." For example, the word 'kanjifah' ( كنجفة ) is written in the top right corner of the king of swords, on the Mamluk Egyptian deck witnessed by [[Leo Aryeh Mayer|L.A. Mayer]] in the [[Topkapı Palace]] museum. The Mamluk cards are difficult to date with any certainty, but Mayer estimated these cards to be from the 15th century.  The piece of playing card collected by [[Edmund de Unger]] may be from the period of the 12-14th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;(Mayer 1971: 9); See also the discussion on the [[Playing card#Early history|early history of playing cards]].&lt;/ref&gt; The term Kanjifah can be found in the 1839 Calcutta edition of the [[One Thousand and One Nights]], in Arabic, at the end of night 460. The first known reference can be found in a 15th-century Arabic text, written by the Egyptian historian [[Ibn Taghribirdi]] (died 1470). In his history of Egypt he mentions how the Sultan Al-Malik Al-Mu'ayyad played kanjafah for money when he was an emir.&lt;ref&gt;The text is described in English by [[Richard Ettinghausen]], in his article "Further Comments on Mamluk Playing Cards". The quote refers to the work of [[Ibn Taghribirdi]], called "Nujum al-zahira fi muluk Misr wa'l-Qahira". Ettinghausen notes that the reference comes in the section describing events from the year 820H or 1417-1418 AD (1984: 1194). The original Arabic text can be found online at https://books.google.com/books?id=QCvC39URTY4C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=editions%3Ae0XIWB1KOVMC&amp;pg=PT535 (Google E-book) or http://shamela.ws/browse.php/book-11988/page-4536 . The relevant passage begins " ...  وأخذ فى إصلاح أمر البلاد ".&lt;/ref&gt;

The cards used by the Mamluks most likely entered Italy and Spain during the 1370s.&lt;ref name="Dummett"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dummett|first1=Michael|title=The Game of Tarot|date=1980|publisher=Duckworth|location=London|pages=33–64|ref=Dummett}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1895, [[William Henry Wilkinson]] pointed out the similarities between [[Spanish playing cards|Spanish]] and [[Italian playing cards]] and [[Chinese playing cards#Money-suited cards|Chinese money-suited cards]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, W.H. (1895) [http://www.gamesmuseum.uwaterloo.ca/Archives/Wilkinson/Wilkinson.html Chinese Origin of Playing Cards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302040523/http://www.gamesmuseum.uwaterloo.ca/Archives/Wilkinson/Wilkinson.html |date=2016-03-02 }}. The American Anthropologist, Volume VIII, pp. 61-78.&lt;/ref&gt; He was unaware of the existence of the Mamluk cards since Mayer did not make his discovery until 1939. The similarities between the Latin European cards and Chinese money-suited cards become more apparent when the Mamluk Kanjifa is described. Looking at the actual games played with Ganjifa cards, Andrew Leibs points out that the cards are divided into strong and weak suits, and in one set the order of the numerical cards is reversed, so that the order runs King, Vizier, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 the weakest. This feature can also be found in the old games of [[Tarot card games|Tarot]], [[Ombre]], and [[Spoil Five|Maw]] played in Europe, and the Chinese money-suited card game of '[[Madiao]]'. He suggests these games may have a common ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;(2004: 130)&lt;/ref&gt;

Kanjifa consists of 52 cards divided into four suits:
*'''Coins''': This suit is in reverse order like in Chinese money-suited card games of [[Madiao]] and [[Khanhoo]] as well as in Tarot, Ombre, and Maw. The high ranking cards of this suit have blue panels (king, viceroy, second viceroy, 1, 2, 3).&lt;ref&gt;Gjerde, Tor. [http://cards.old.no/1500-mamluk/ Mamluk cards, ca. 1500] at Historical playing cards. Retrieved 23 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Polo-sticks''': Very likely originated from the Chinese suit of Strings. This suit is also in reverse order as indicated by the blue panels. This suit was converted into cudgels (Spain) or batons (Italy) as polo was too obscure in Europe.
*'''Cups''': The cups are called [[Tumen (unit)|tuman]], a Turkic, Mongol, and Jurchen word meaning "[[myriad]]". In China, there is a suit of myriads ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|万}}}}). Wilkinson proposed that European cups were created by flipping the Chinese character. In Italy and Spain, this suit was inverted but in the Mamluk deck the blue panels are only found in the three court cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pollett|first1=Andrea|title=Tuman, or the Ten Thousand Cups of the Mamluk Cards|journal=[[The Playing-Card]]|date=2002|volume=31|issue=1|pages=34–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Swords''': This suit is in the logical order with blue panels on the king, viceroy, second viceroy, 10, 9, and 8. Andrea Pollett proposes that it originates from the Chinese suit of Tens ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|十}}}}).&lt;ref&gt;Pollett, Andrea. [http://a_pollett.tripod.com/cardsc.htm  Relations between eastern and western cards] at Andy's Playing Cards. Retrieved 23 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Ettinghausen]] speculated that importation of European cards killed off manufacturers in Egypt and the Levant. Trade continued after the conquest of these regions by the Ottomon Turks in 1517. They were also mentioned by [[Ibn Hajar al-Haytami]]. The lack of references or cards after the 16th century is likely due to the Ottomans taking a harder stance against cards and gambling which would last until the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Dummett" /&gt;

===Persian sources===
[[File:Ganjifa p16 Researches into the history of playing cards.jpg|thumb|Images of cards from the collection of [[Francis Douce]], shown by [[Samuel Weller Singer]]. The figure on horseback on the card in the top right corner appears to be holding an object marked " برات ", meaning 'bill' or 'cheque' in Persian.]]
The earliest Persian reference is found in [[Ahli Shirazi]]'s (died 1535) poem, 'Rubaiyat-e-Ganjifa', there is a short verse for each of the 96 cards in the 8-suited pack, showing that the Persians had the same suits and ranks as the Mughals.&lt;ref&gt;See Farsi wikipedia article [[:fa:رباعیات گنجفه]], or for the full text refer to Shirazi &amp; Rabbani (1965:668-684). The poem is also mentioned in the bibliography of [[Katip Çelebi]] page 832.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Austrian National Library]] possess eight [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] lacquer paintings from the 16th-century that mimic ganjifeh cards. Despite being produced around the same time as Shirazi's poem, they do not match his description.&lt;ref&gt;They depict a mounted vizier playing polo with two assistants, 10 archers, 8 merchants, 8 farmers, 2 bulls, 3 lions, 10 lions, and 2 genii or demons. It is not known if they are purely artwork or supposed to represent a standard pattern of cards. See: Zimmerman, Rolf. [http://www.altacarta.com/deutsch/research/ZentralAsien.html Die verschollenen Spielkarten Zentralasiens] at altacarta.com. Retrieved 31 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Shah [[Abbas II of Persia|Abbas II]] (r 1642-66) banned ganjifeh and the game decline precipitously with no known rules surviving into the present.&lt;ref name="Mann"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mann|first1=Sylvia|title=All Cards on the Table|date=1990|publisher=Deutsches Spielkarten-Museum|location=Leinfelden|page=183|ref=Mann}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the eighteenth or nineteenth centuries, the game of [[As-Nas]] became more popular.&lt;ref&gt;The collection of the Fournier playing cards museum in Vittoria, Spain, contains As-Nas cards dated to the 18th and 19th centuries. The Cary playing card collection (Yale University) contains various Iranian cards, spanning a period from 1800 to 1905 (estimated dates). All the cards are of the [[As-Nas]] type, rather than the older 8-suited variety.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1895, General [[Albert Houtum-Schindler]] described ganjifeh and As-Nas with the following comments:&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by [[Stewart Culin]]&lt;/ref&gt;

:"The word ganjifeh is in Persian now only employed for European playing-cards (four suits, ace to ten; three picture cards each suit), which, however, are also called ''rarak i âs'' - ''rarak i âsanâs'' - or simply ''âs'', from the game ''âs'' or ''[[As-Nas|âsanâs]]''. From travellers to Persia in the seventeenth century we know that a set of ganjifeh consisted of ninety or ninety-six cards in eight suits or colors.&lt;ref&gt;See for example [[Jean-Baptiste Tavernier]] (1676: 626), and [[Jean Chardin]] (1811: 451).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Dummett]] noted the differences between Mamluk kanjifa and Safavid ganjifeh and postulated that there was an earlier ancestor. This ur-ganjifeh would be similar to kanjifa but with only two court cards, the king and the viceroy/vizier. The second viceroy rank found in the kanjifa pack is not based on any historical title and may be a Mamluk invention. According to his hypothesis, the Chinese money-suited pack entered Persia where the Persians added three new ranks: the 10, viceroy, and king to make a 48-card pack. He suggests the Persians eventually changed most of the Chinese suits to fit their culture while the Mamluks were more conservative with the suits. The addition of new suits in both Persia and India was to make the game more challenging as memory is the most important skill in the eponymous [[trick-taking game]].&lt;ref name="Dummett" /&gt; Chinese money-suited cards copied their pips directly from Chinese banknotes. In 1294, [[Gaykhatu]] began printing an imitation of [[Chao (currency)|Yuan banknotes]] in Iran although these were withdrawn quickly after merchants rejected them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eliyahu Ashtor|Ashtor, Eliyahu]]. (1976) A Social and Economic History of the Near East in the Middle Ages. Londen: W. Collins &amp; Co. Ltd. p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 17th century, the money-suited deck had acquired a new card depicting a Persian merchant.&lt;ref&gt;Lo, Andrew (2000), The Late Ming Game of Ma Diao, [[The Playing-Card]] (XXIX, No. 3), pp. 115–136, The [[International Playing-Card Society]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early history in India===
Rudolf von Leyden suggested that the Ganjifa cards may have been brought by the first Mughals from their ancestral homeland in Inner Asia.&lt;ref&gt;(article 'The Search for Ganjifa' in The India Magazine, June 1983, p28. Retrieved from http://kreedaakaushalya.blogspot.fr/2010/01/search-for-ganjifa.html on 02/01/2015)&lt;/ref&gt; A key reference comes from an early 16th-century biography of [[Babur|Bâbur]], the founder of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] dynasty. In his work the [[Baburnama]], [[Babur]] notes in the year 933H (1527) that he had a pack of Ganjifa cards sent to Shah Hassan. This took place in the month of Ramzan, on the night he left Agra to travel to nearby Fatehpur Sikri (Uttar Pradesh, India).&lt;ref&gt;See Beveridge (1922: 584)&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest surviving rules date to around 1600 in India.&lt;ref name="Asian"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hopewell|first1=Jeff|authorlink1=Ganjifa: The Traditional Cards of India|editor1-last=Mackenzie|editor1-first=C|editor2-last=Finkel|editor2-first=I|title=Asian Games: The Art of Contest|date=2004|publisher=[[Asia Society]]|location=New York|pages=241–251|ref=Asian}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Edward Terry (author)|Edward Terry]] visited India in the first quarter of the seventeenth century, he saw ganjifa cards often.&lt;ref&gt;See Terry (1777:190), or weblink https://books.google.com/books?id=79gRAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA190#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; Modern ganjifa is usually round but rectangular cards were more common during the 18th-century and from records Persian ganjifeh was always rectangular. Its circular shape must have been an Indian innovation.

While Mughal ganjifa had the same suits and ranks as Safavid ganjifeh, a 10-suited deck, the Dashavatara Ganjifa, was created to appeal to Hindus in the seventeenth century.&lt;ref name="Asian" /&gt; Some historical decks have had more than 30 suits.

===Competition from Western style cards===
In countries such as India and Persia, the traditional hand-made Ganjifa cards lost market share to Western-style printed cards, which came to dominate in the 20th century. This decline has several aspects.

* Improvements in printing techniques and machinery allowed manufacturers in Europe and elsewhere to improve their output and further expand their export of playing cards. Manufacturers introduced steam powered machines, [[lithography]] and later [[Offset printing]] during the 19th century. For example, the town of Turnhout in Belgium was a centre of playing cards manufacture. The Turnhout manufacturer Brepols installed steam powered equipment in 1852, lithographic printing of playing cards in 1862, and began offset printing in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Autenboer &amp; Cremers, pages 23-25&lt;/ref&gt; In the period around 1900 the French manufacturer Camoin&lt;ref&gt;See also French wikipedia article [[:fr:Jean-Baptiste Camoin]]&lt;/ref&gt; exported cards to North Africa, and the Middle East as far as the Persian Gulf.&lt;ref&gt;p81-2, Cartes à jouer &amp; tarots de Marseille: La donation Camoin&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian market was so significant for the Belgian manufacturer 'Biermans' that a factory was established in Calcutta in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;Autenboer &amp; Cremers, page 27&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938 playing card exports from the US to India totalled some 888,603 packs, and 60,344 packs were exported to Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of the Census pages 642-3&lt;/ref&gt; For the Ottoman Empire some European manufacturers produced cards with specific designs, known as 'cartes turques' and 'cartes orientales'. These were essentially 4-suited European style designs, but the aces featured scenic prints adapted to the target market.&lt;ref&gt;Autenboer &amp; Cremers, page 18, and on p.22 an example is shown from the Turnhout manufacturer Glénisson, from the second half of the 19th Century. The ace has a double-headed design, with a scene of the modern city of Istanbul on one end, and a scene of the historic city on the other, when it was called [[Constantinople]]. The titles are written using the Arabic alphabet.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ganjifa cards were less suited to Western card games. The invention of games such as [[Euchre]], [[History of contract bridge|Bridge]], [[History of poker|Poker]], and [[Rummy]] can be seen as significant events and Western style playing cards are best suited to these games. In Iran, the game of As-Nas largely fell out of fashion by around 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Article from the Brooklyn Museum website, consulted 15/11/2014 "As nas became popular under the Qajars and continued to be played until the end of World War II, when it lost favor to games such as poker, rummy, and bridge.". Link: http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/objects/169352/Playing_Cards_for_the_Game_of_Nas&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, a version of the French game [[Belote]] became popular, under the name [[Baloot]] ( بلوت ). With regards to India, European style cards were introduced during the colonial period, with demand coming from the wealthier classes.&lt;ref&gt;Crestin Billet (2002:188)&lt;/ref&gt; Some cards were imported, some were made by hand using traditional techniques, and others were made by Indian industrialists. The [[Cary Collection of Playing Cards]] (Yale University) has a deck of Indian-made bridge cards dated to around 1935, for example.&lt;ref&gt;Yale University, Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Cary Playing Cards Database. Record ID: 1064 Catalog Number: IND2. Maker: Ravi-Varma F.A.L. Works, Malavli-Lonavla; Karamchand Ambalal &amp; Co., Bangri Bazar, Bombay 3. Date of Manufacture: 1935(circa). Title: ZENITH 515 BRIDGE PLAYING CARDS&lt;/ref&gt;
* Taxes on playing cards. States used taxes on playing cards to generate revenue, and required specific stamps or wrappers on packs of cards. Such arrangements can create barriers for smaller manufacturers producing cards by hand. The Ottoman Empire introduced taxes on playing cards in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;Autenboer &amp; Cremers, page 26&lt;/ref&gt;
* Playing cards monopolies. In many countries state monopolies were established to control imports and production. Such monopolies tend to standardise card designs, or create conditions that better suit larger manufacturers that can win government contracts or meet the necessary conditions. In Iran, the monopoly was set up following the Foreign Trade Monopoly Act of 1931. The British playing card manufacturer [[De La Rue]] was commissioned to provide cards during the 1930s. The cards featured indexing in [[Persian language|Persian]] and court card images that evoked Persian history. Nonetheless the cards used Western style suits, and so the commissioning of the cards reinforced the position of Western-style 4-suited printed cards.

By the 21st-century, the only place with a significant community of ganjifa makers and players is [[Odisha]] in the east of India. They use [[ganjapa]], the local variation known for abstract and highly stylized suit symbols and extra suits.

* '''Moghul Ganjifa'''&lt;ref&gt;For more information and images refer to pattern sheet 67 of the International Playing Card Society (website: http://www.i-p-c-s.org). Link to pattern sheet viewed 16/11/2014: http://i-p-c-s.org/pattern/sawmog.html&lt;/ref&gt; is played in some parts of [[Odisha]] with 96 cards in 8 suits of 12 cards each; each suit is distinctively coloured and comprises ten pip cards from 1 to 10 and two court cards, a vizier and a king. This is the type of pack described by [[Ahli Shirazi]]. The suits featured are: slaves (ḡolām, غلام ); crowns (tāj, تاج ) swords (šamšīr, شمشير ); 'red' gold coins (zar-e sorḵ, زر سرخ ); harps (čang, چنگ ); bills of exchange (barāt, برات ); white gold coins (zar-e safīd, زر سفيد ); and cloth (qomāš قماش ). When referring to the king of a suit, he uses the term 'emir', shortened to 'mir' ( میر ) in the titles, but the term 'padishah' ( پادشاه ) in the text of the verses. He describes a card with one suit symbol simply as a 'one', that is to say he does not the term 'ace'.&lt;ref&gt;Shirazi &amp; Rabbani (1965:668-684)&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 10 suits of 12 cards each; the suits correspond to the [[Dashavatara|ten avatars]] of [[Vishnu]].  The order of the suits (from lowest to highest) is: [[Matsya]] (fish), [[Kurma|Kuchha]] (turtle), [[Varaha]] (boar), Narsingha(lion, or half-man, half-lion), [[Vamana]] (Vishnu as a dwarf, [[kamandalu|round vessel]] symbols on cards), [[Parashurama]] (axes), [[Rama]] (bows and arrows), [[Krishna]] (round plates shown), [[Buddha in Hinduism|Buddha]] (conch shells), [[Kalki|Kalanki]] (swords).&lt;ref&gt;Description based on booklet supplied with a set of cards from Sawantwadi Lacquerwares, The Palace, Sawantwadi 416510 Maharashtra, India.&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrieved 30/1/2015. http://odisha.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/2010/Jan/engpdf/39-43.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It is closely associated with the [[Ganjapa]] tradition of [[Odisha]] and usually has eight, ten, or twelve suits.
* '''Rashi Ganjifa''' is a 12 suited Indian deck, with suit symbols derived from the 12 signs of the [[zodiac]]. It appears to be limited to the 18th and 19th centuries.

* '''Naqsh Ganjifa''' For playing Naqsh, shorter Indian decks exist, with 48 cards. There is only one suit which is quadruplicated. The suit symbols used for the run of 12 cards vary from one pack to the next. These decks are associated with [[gambling]] or play during the festival season in India.
* '''Mysore Chad Ganjifa.''' [[Mysore#Culture|Mysore]] was a centre for Ganjifa card making, encouraged by the ruler [[Krishnaraja Wadiyar III]] in the mid-19th century. He devised a series of complex Ganjifa games, some requiring as many as 18 different suits, permanent [[trump (card games)|trump]]s, and [[Wild card (card games)|wild cards]]. A typical Chad suit had twelve numeral and six court cards, and packs had as many as 360 cards. They never achieved mass appeal and are quite obscure, possibly played only within his royal palace if at all.&lt;ref&gt;Refer to articles by Mr. Kishor N. Gordhandas, such as 'Cards of Honour', in the Mysore based Deccan Herald newspaper, Sunday 6/4/2008, online version http://archive.deccanherald.com/Content/Apr62008/finearts2008040561212.asp (retrieved 02/01/2015); 'Playing cards of Mysore' http://kishorcards.tripod.com/05mysore/mysore1to7.htm (retrieved 25/3/2015); also 'Mysore Palace Playing cards', http://www.craftrevival.org/CraftArtDetails.asp?CountryCode=India&amp;CraftCode=003665 (retrieved 02/01/2015).&lt;/ref&gt; The games are described in the work called the [[Sritattvanidhi]], in the section 'Kautuka nidhi', and colour illustrations show designs for the cards.
* '''Akbar's Ganjifa.''' The 16th-century Mughal emperor [[Akbar]] played using a 12 suited deck, which is described in detail in the [[Ain-i-Akbari]]. The suits were horses, elephants, foot soldiers, forts, treasures, warriors in armour, boats, women, divinities, genii, wild beasts, and snakes. No specimens are known to have survived.&lt;ref&gt;[[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak]] (1873: 306). Google book: https://books.google.com/books?id=_Isx7NqZZHEC&amp;pg=PA306&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Mamluk Kanjifa.''' Very few such cards are known or exist. The [[Playing card#Egypt|examples]] found by [[Leo Aryeh Mayer]] are understood to have four suits: cups, coins, swords, and polo-sticks. Each suit has three court cards, the king (malik), the first vizir (na'ib malik), and the second vizir (na'ib thani). The court cards have no figurative imagery, but they feature calligraphed inscriptions and richly decorated backgrounds. The term 'Kanjifa' appears in Arabic on the king of swords. They directly inspired the Latin-suited playing cards of [[Italian playing cards|Italy]] and [[Spanish playing cards|Spain]].
* '''French suited Ganjifa'''. Hybrids exist that combine Indian or Persian imagery with the hearts, diamonds, spades, and clubs symbols of the French suit system.&lt;ref&gt;Refer to IPCS pattern sheet 68.

==Games==

===Ganjifa===
This is a [[trick-taking game]], played individually. This is the game most commonly associated with ganjifa cards, each player playing for him or herself. The objective is to win the most cards by taking tricks. At least three players are required. In some games 4 players play individually, and it is also possible to play in pairs. The rules vary, but generally the following apply:

:In the simplest form of the game there is no concept of a '[[trump (card games)|trump]] suit' that beats cards in other suits.&lt;ref&gt;A variant is possible where the 'lead suit' as described below is the trump suit.&lt;/ref&gt; A trick can only be won by a card of the same suit. When a player is not in position to win a trick there is no obligation to [[follow suit|follow the suit]] led.

:In all cases the King ('mir' or 'shah') is always the strongest card in each suit, followed by the Vizier. However, in half the suits the numerical cards rank in logical order from 10 strongest (just below the Vizier), down to 1 (weakest), and the other suits the order of the numerical cards is reversed, with the ace strongest (just below the Vizier), and the 10 weakest, thus giving the order K,V,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.&lt;ref&gt;This feature of a reversed order in the number cards of half the suits can be found in some European games, notably [[Ombre]], [[Spoil Five|Maw]], and [[Tarot card games|most games]] played with [[Tarot]] cards. For the game of Ombre see the rules given by Peter Arnold, for example (2010:88), and Chatto points out this similarity between the rules of Ganjifa and those of Ombre (1848:45). An Italian account explains how this feature of Ombre also applied to the game played with the [[Minchiate]] tarot cards (Brunetti 1747:16)(direct link https://books.google.com/books?id=x_1dAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA16 ). The suits of cups (coppe) and coins (denari) are those with the reversed order of the number cards. In France this inverted order did feature for a time in the game of [[French Tarot]], at least in some regions, although it has now disappeared from the modern standard rules. The book 'Tarot, Jeu et Magie' points to two literary sources that mention this feature, from the 18th and 19th centuries (1984:122-124)(link, text in French, http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6532698n ).&lt;/ref&gt; If playing with a Moghul type pack, the suits with the 'reverse order' numerical cards are barat, zar-e zorkh, qomash, and chang (bills, red gold coins, cloth, and harps) in India; in Iran, zar-e safīd (white coins) were inverted instead of the red coins. In Dashavtar packs the suits with reversed cards are the first avatars, Matsya, Kutchha, Varaha, Nrusinha and Waman (fish, turtle, boar, lion and round vessel symbols).

:Before the start of play stakes are agreed if the game is being played for money. At the end of the round the losing player pays this stake value, multiplied by the difference in number of tricks taken between the winner and the loser.

====Dealing====
:Players draw cards at the beginning to determine who will deal. Traditionally players would sit on a sheet or large cloth on the floor, and the cards are mixed face down in the middle of the cloth, rather than shuffled in the manner of Western cards.

:The deal and the order of the play follows an anti-clockwise direction. The dealer deals out all the cards. According to custom cards may be dealt in batches of four, rather than individually. Some accounts stipulate that the first batch and last batch dealt to each player are dealt face up.&lt;ref&gt;These are the rules given by Shrikrisna Maudranalay, and also those in the account by Chatto (1848: 42)&lt;/ref&gt;

:Players should sort their cards into suits and put them in order. For convenience, due to the large number of cards, players often separate any low value pip cards and keep them to the side, keeping only the more valuable cards in hand. When discarding during play these low value cards are used indifferently.

====Play====
:During the game players must try to keep track of the cards that have been played. The highest outstanding cards left in play in each suit are called 'hukm', corresponding to the Persian word " حکم ".&lt;ref&gt;[[Court piece|Hukm (or Hokm)]] is the name of a card game played in modern Iran. It is of the same general family of games as the ganjifa trick taking game. Play is to the right (counterclockwise), cards are dealt in batches, and as in ganjifa, the player that leads the game is one that receives a high card (in the case of Hokm, an ace). Refer to http://www.pagat.com/whist/hokm.html&lt;/ref&gt;

:The player to lead is the one holding the King in a certain suit. This 'lead suit' varies according to the type of pack, and also according to whether the game is played during the day (between sunrise and sunset) or during the night. With a Moghul pack the lead suits are zar-e zorkh (red gold coins, or figuratively 'suns') by day, and zar-e safid (white gold coins or figuratively 'moons') by night. If playing with Dashavtar cards the lead suits are Rama by day, and Krishna by night. The player holding the King in this lead suit begins by playing two cards at once - the King and another low card. The other players cannot win, and so they each discard two low cards which are won by the player who led the game. This player then leads again. At this point accounts of the game rules differ. The rules below on gameplay are based on the description by John McLeod.&lt;ref&gt;Online post by John McLeod (webmaster of card game rules site www.pagat.com) on the newsgroup rec.games.playing-cards on March 25, 1997, in reply to a thread entitled "Ganjifa, Classic Indian card game", started by James Kilfiger on March 22, 1997. The newsgroup can be browsed for example via google: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rec.games.playing-cards . Direct weblink to post, retrieved February 8, 2015: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/rec.games.playing-cards/ganjifa/rec.games.playing-cards/m3h8xA9rLh4/5Im7ud3hQJYJ . For comparison, other accounts can be found, such as Sally Wilkins (2002: 194-195); the booklet given with sets of cards by Sawandwadi Lacquerwares, written by Maudranalay; Chatto (1848:41-43), who quotes from an article from the 'Calcutta Magazine' (1815); and an article by Kishor Gordhandas, retrieved on Feb. 8, 2015: http://kishorcards.tripod.com/08handed/handed1to6.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

:Rules govern which leads are possible. Players must lead as follows, in order of priority: 1) If the lead player has a continuous series of winning cards in a suit, then this sequence must be led, with the exception of the last card in the sequence which is kept for later. 2) The next possibility is a move called 'deni'. This is possible when a player lacks the hukm in a given suit, but has the second highest outstanding card. In this case the player may lead a low card in that suit, and call for the hukm. The opponent with the hukm then wins the trick but the player that made the 'deni' move retains the lead, which is the advantage of making this move. If the player with the hukm also holds the third highest card in the suit, he may play this card as well, and it is said that the deni is doubled. In this case everyone plays a second card and the player with the hukm wins two tricks. However the lead still returns to the player who made the deni move. 3) When a leader cannot make either of the two leads described above, he then leads out any remaining hukm cards, all at once, a move called 'utari'.&lt;ref&gt;Noted by Wilkins (2002: 195). Compare also the definition given by Maudranalay, page 16.&lt;/ref&gt; In McLeod's account this is the only option available to a player at this stage, so a player would need to lead any hukms they might have, and then pass the lead as described next in step 4. However in the rules given by Wilkins there is a second option, whereby the player can instead simply lead a low card or non-winning card of his choosing to pass the lead.&lt;ref name="Wilkins 2002:195"&gt;Wilkins (2002:195)&lt;/ref&gt; 4) If a player has no further valid options for leading cards, he gives up the lead by shuffling his hand, and placing the cards face down. The player to his right then selects the card that he must lead, for example by saying 'fourth from the top' or pointing to a card if they are spread out. The lead then passes to the player who wins the trick, who then follows the same sequence of possible leads as described above.

:In some accounts there is an end phase or secondary phase to the game, in which the leading rules are simplified or changed. According to McLeod, when the players get down to the last 12 cards, steps 1 and 2 described above are skipped, and a player starts by leading out all his hukms directly. After doing so, the player must try to lead a card from a suit named by his right-hand neighbour. If he cannot lead this suit the lead is passed as described in step 4 above, with the player's cards shuffled and placed face down. In Wilkins' account, there is also a second phase to the game, which applies when all the players have held and lost the lead once. From this point onwards hukm cards are played individually instead of in batches. Furthermore, in this second phase, if a player leads a low card, it is played face down and the player can freely choose the suit which must be followed.&lt;ref name="Wilkins 2002:195"/&gt;

:The round continues until all the cards have been played. At this point the players can count their tricks and decide any payments or forfeits that must be paid. However in the rules described by Chatto there a final round played using the cards won in tricks. This is a challenging game called 'Ser-k'hel'. Players shuffle their tricks, and the winner of the last trick plays one trick blind against a player of his choice. The winner of this trick then challenges the player to his right in the same way.&lt;ref&gt;Chatto (1848:43)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Following rounds====
:In some accounts losing players are disadvantaged when starting the next round. One possibility is that players are required to use the cards won in tricks for playing with in the following round. Players who are short on cards have to buy cards from other players to make up the difference.&lt;ref&gt;See Chatto (1848:43)&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, cards can be shuffled and distributed equally, but losing players are required to exchange cards with winning players. The losing player must give cards at random, without looking at them, and the winning player is allowed to return low value cards, sorted from his hand. The number of cards exchanged is the difference in the number of tricks won in the last round.&lt;ref name="Wilkins 2002:195"/&gt;

:The total number of rounds played may vary. In Chatto's account a full game is made up of four rounds. In the version described by Maudranalay, there is no fixed number of rounds, rather the game must continue round after round until a losing player (presumably meaning a player who lost the previous round of gameplay) beats the card led by another player on the last trick of the round.&lt;ref&gt;Maudranalay, page 16.&lt;/ref&gt; This last lead card is called the 'akheri', from a word for 'last' (which exists in persian and arabic ( آخر ). In Wilkin's account, this event has a different significance. Wilkins writes that if a player beats the akheri card, he is exempted from paying any forfeit money going into the next round.&lt;ref name="Wilkins 2002:195"/&gt;

:An adaptation is possible if players use the international 52 card pack. In this case the game is for three players only, and the 2 of diamonds is removed so that players each receive 17 cards each. The lead suit is always spades. In an account about gameplay in northern India (before the creation of Pakistan), Shurreef writes that the King is referred to as 'Badshah' (corresponding to the Persian term 'Padishah'), the queen as 'Bibia' (Persian term 'Bibi'), and the Jack as the 'Ghulam', meaning 'slave'.&lt;ref&gt;Shurreef (1999:336).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Partnership Ganjifa===
Played in partnerships (two against two). Some call this game 'Dugi'.&lt;ref&gt;See IPCS paper 'Ganjifa - the traditional playing cards of India', by Jeff Hopewell, p63. The name 'Dugi' is used in Digapahandi (Orissa)&lt;/ref&gt; In this game the order of the suits and the cards is the same as for the individual ganjifa trick taking game described above, however the aim of the game is for one partnership to win all the tricks. The partnership dealt the King in the lead suit has to take on this challenge. It is possible to determine the lead suit by the day or night rule as above, or by cutting cards. The following game rules are taken from an account by John McLeod&lt;ref&gt;Online post by John McLeod (webmaster of card game rules site www.pagat.com) on the newsgroup rec.games.playing-cards on March 25, 1997, in reply to a thread entitled "Ganjifa, Classic Indian card game", started by James Kilfiger on March 22, 1997. The newsgroup can be browsed for example via google: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rec.games.playing-cards . Direct weblink to post, retrieved February 8, 2015: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/rec.games.playing-cards/ganjifa/rec.games.playing-cards/m3h8xA9rLh4/5Im7ud3hQJYJ&lt;/ref&gt;

:The partners taking on the challenge to win all the tricks can decide between themselves who will take on the lead. Before starting, the lead king can be passed from one partner to another in exchange for another card of the same suit.

:When leading, a player must lead all the 'hukms' that they have in hand (these are the highest cards remaining in a given suit, that are sure to win). Players must follow suit if they are able to do so. If this is not possible, the leading player names another suit, and they must discard their highest card in that suit. If they do not have any cards in the suit named, then they may discard any other card.

:When a player who has the lead has no hukms, he may ask his partner which suit he should lead. Thus the partner can indicate a suit in which he has a hukm, so that the partnership can keep the lead. If the partner names a suit that the leader does not have in hand, the leader must decide himself which card to lead, without asking for more guidance.

:If the opponents succeed in winning a single trick then they win the game.

===Naqsh===
This game can be played with any pack of cards, including the Mughal types, and the shorter 48 card decks. European style packs can be used by removing the jacks. Each suit therefore has two court cards, and ten numeral cards. The game has some similarities with [[Blackjack]]. In Naqsh the 'Mir' (or King) is given a value of 12 points, and the second court card, the 'Ghodi' (or Vizir, Cavalier or Queen) is worth 11. The other cards are worth their pip values, including the ace which has a value of 1. Several players can play the game. Mr. Gordhandas suggests 5-7 players, with 6 being the ideal number. The aim is to achieve a total value of 17 with the first two cards dealt, or the nearest number below this total. Players with low value cards can continue to draw further cards to try to improve their total. Variations can be played where 21 is a target total (but only if made with a King and a 9, or a Vizier and a ten), or where different winning combinations are accepted such as pairs, triples and so on. The game is suited to gambling.&lt;ref&gt;Based on article by Mr. Kishor Gordhandas: http://www.craftrevival.org/CraftArtDetails.asp?CountryCode=india&amp;CraftCode=003675 retrieved 3/1/2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hortus Deliciarum, Der Tanz um das goldene Kalb.JPG|thumb|''[[The Adoration of the Golden Calf]]'' – Picture from the [[Hortus deliciarum]] of [[Herrad of Landsberg]] (12th century)]]
According to the [[Bible]], the '''golden calf''' (עֵגֶּל הַזָהָב '' ‘ēggel hazāhāv'') was an [[Idolatry|idol]] (a [[cult image]]) made by the [[Israelites]] during [[Moses]]' absence, when he went up to [[biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]]. In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], the incident is known as ''ḥēṭ’ ha‘ēggel'' (חֵטְא הַעֵגֶּל) or "The Sin of the Calf". It is first mentioned in {{bibleref2|Exodus|32:4}}.

[[Bull worship]] was common in many cultures. In Egypt, whence according to the [[The Exodus|Exodus narrative]] the Hebrews had recently come, the [[Apis (Egyptian mythology)|Apis Bull]] was a comparable object of worship, which some believe the Hebrews were reviving in the wilderness;&lt;ref&gt;The early Christian ''[[Apostolic Constitutions]]'', [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume VII/Constitutions of the Holy Apostles/Book VI/Sec. IV|vi. 4]] (c. 380), mentions that "the law is the decalogue, which the Lord promulgated to them with an audible voice, before the people made that calf which represented the Egyptian Apis."&lt;/ref&gt; alternatively, some believe the God of Israel was associated with or pictured as a calf/bull deity through the process of [[religious assimilation]] and [[syncretism]]. Among the Egyptians' and Hebrews' neighbors in the [[ancient Near East]] and in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], the [[aurochs]], the wild bull, was widely worshipped, often as the [[Bull (mythology)|Lunar Bull]] and as the creature of [[El (god)|El]].

==In the Book of Exodus==

[[File:The Worship of the Golden Calf (Filippino Lippi).jpg|thumb|right|''The Worship of the Golden Calf'' by [[Filippino Lippi]] (1457–1504)]]
When [[Moses]] went up into [[Biblical Mount Sinai]] to receive the [[Ten Commandments]] ({{bibleref|Exodus|24:12-18|9}}), he left the Israelites for [[forty days and forty nights]]. The Israelites feared that he would not return and demanded that [[Aaron]] make them "gods" to go before them ({{bibleref|Exodus|32:1|9}}). Aaron gathered up the Israelites' golden earrings and ornaments, constructed a "molten calf" and they declared: "These ''[be]'' thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt." (Exodus 32:4)

Aaron built an [[altar]] before the calf and proclaimed the next day to be a feast to the {{LORD}}. So they rose up early the next day and "offered [[Korban Olah|burnt-offerings]], and brought [[Slaughter offering|peace-offerings]]; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play." (Exodus 32:6) God told Moses what the Israelites were up to back in camp, that they had turned aside quickly out of the way which God commanded them and he was going to destroy them and start a new people from Moses. Moses besought and pleaded that they should be spared ({{bibleverse||Exodus|32:11-14|HE}}), and God "repented of the evil which He said He would do unto His people."

Moses went down from the mountain, but upon seeing the calf, he became angry and threw down the two [[Tablets of Stone]], breaking them. Moses burnt the golden calf in a fire, ground it to powder, scattered it on water, and forced the Israelites to drink it. When Moses asked him, Aaron admitted collecting the gold, and throwing it into the fire, and said it came out as a calf ({{bibleverse||Exodus|32:21-24|HE}}).

===Exclusion of the Levites and mass execution===
{{main|Levite}}
The Bible records that the [[tribe of Levi]] did not worship the golden calf. When Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said: 'Whosoever is on the {{LORD}}'s side, let him come unto me.' And all the [[Levite|sons of Levi]] gathered themselves together unto him. And he said unto them: 'Thus saith the {{LORD}}, the God of Israel: Put ye every man his sword upon his thigh, and go to and fro from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour.' And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses; and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men. ({{bibleverse||Exodus|32:26-28|HE}})

==Other mentions in the Bible==
[[File:Tissot Moses Destroys the Tables of the Ten Commandments.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Moses destroying the tables (watercolor circa 1896–1902 by [[James Tissot]])]]
The golden calf is mentioned in {{bibleref2|Nehemiah|9:16–21|NIV}}.
{{quote|
"But they, our ancestors, became arrogant and stiff-necked, and they did not obey your commands. They refused to listen and failed to remember the miracles you performed among them. They became stiff-necked and in their rebellion appointed a leader in order to return to their slavery. But you are a forgiving God, gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and abounding in love. Therefore you did not desert them, even when they cast for themselves an image of a calf and said, 'This is your god, who brought you up out of Egypt', or when they committed awful blasphemies. "Because of your great compassion you did not abandon them in the wilderness. By day the pillar of cloud did not fail to guide them on their path, nor the pillar of fire by night to shine on the way they were to take. You gave your good Spirit to instruct them. You did not withhold your manna from their mouths, and you gave them water for their thirst. For forty years you sustained them in the wilderness; they lacked nothing, their clothes did not wear out nor did their feet become swollen."}}

The language suggests that there are some inconsistencies in the other accounts of the Israelites and their use of the calf. As the version in Exodus and 1&amp;nbsp;Kings are written by [[Deuteronomist]]ic historians based in the southern kingdom of Judah, there is a proclivity to expose the Israelites as unfaithful. The inconsistency is primarily located in Exodus&amp;nbsp;32:4 where "gods" is plural despite the construction of a single calf. When Ezra retells the story, he uses the single, capitalized God.&lt;ref&gt;Coogan, 2009, pg.&amp;nbsp;116–117.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, a more biblically conservative view offers a tenable explanation accounting for the discrepancy between "gods" in Exodus&amp;nbsp;32 and "God" in Nehemiah&amp;nbsp;9:18. In both instances, the Hebrew ''[[elohim]]'' is used.  Since ancient Hebrew failed to distinguish ''elohim'' God (known as the majestic plural) from ''elohim'' gods, Biblical translations are either determined by (a)&amp;nbsp;context or (b)&amp;nbsp;adjacent verb(s). In the original account in Exodus&amp;nbsp;32, the verb is in the 3rd&amp;nbsp;person plural. In Nehemiah&amp;nbsp;9, the verb connected to ''elohim'' is singular. For the JEDP (i.e. Deuteronomistic) theorist, this inconsistency is confirmatory since the theory maintains a roughly equivalent date for the composition of Exodus and Nehemiah. More conservative scholarship would argue that these two texts were composed about 1000&amp;nbsp;years apart: Exodus (by Moses) ''circa'' 1500&amp;nbsp;BCE, and Nehemiah ''circa'' 500&amp;nbsp;BCE. The biblically conservative framework would therefore account for the verbal inconsistency from Exodus to Nehemiah as an evolution in the use of language over the approximate millennium separating the two books.

==Jeroboam's golden calves at Bethel and Dan==
{{main|Jeroboam}}
[[Image:Worshiping the golden calf.jpg|thumb|right|Worshiping the Golden Calf]]
According to {{bibleref2|1 Kings|12:26–30|NIV}}, after [[Jeroboam]] establishes the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|northern Kingdom of Israel]], he contemplates the sacrificial practices of the Israelites.
{{quote|
Jeroboam thought to himself, "The kingdom will now likely revert to the house of David. If these people go up to offer sacrifices at the temple of the {{LORD}} in Jerusalem, they will again give their allegiance to their lord, Rehoboam king of Judah. They will kill me and return to King Rehoboam." After seeking advice, the king made two golden calves. He said to the people, "It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem. Here are your gods, Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt." One he set up in Bethel, and the other in [[Dan (ancient city)|Dan]]. And this thing became a sin; the people came to worship the one at Bethel and went as far as Dan to worship the other.}}

His concern was that the tendency to offer sacrifices in Jerusalem, which is in the southern [[Kingdom of Judah]], would lead to a return to King [[Rehoboam]]. He makes two golden calves and places them in [[Bethel]] and [[Dan (ancient city)|Dan]]. He erects the two calves in what he figures (in some interpretations) as substitutes for the ''[[cherub]]im'' built by [[King Solomon]] in [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;Coogan, pg. 117, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Elliott Friedman]] says "at a minimum we can say that the writer of the golden calf account in Exodus seems to have taken the words that were traditionally ascribed to Jeroboam and placed them in the mouths of the people." Friedman believes that the story was turned into a [[polemic]], exaggerating the throne platform decoration into idolatry, by a family of priests sidelined by Jeroboam.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Richard Elliott "Who Wrote the Bible?" 1987 pp 72–3&lt;/ref&gt;

The declarations of Aaron and Jeroboam are almost identical: 
* 'These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt' (Exod 32:4, 8);
* 'Behold your gods, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt (1 Kings 12:28)
After making the golden calf or golden calves both Aaron and Jeroboam celebrate festivals. Aaron builds an altar and Jeroboam ascends an altar (Exod 32:5–6; 1 Kings 12:32–33).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harvey|first1=John E.|title=Retelling the Torah: the Deuteronomistic historian's use of Tetrateuchal Narratives|date=2004|publisher=T &amp; T Clark International|location=New York; London|page=2|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/retelling-the-torah-the-deuteronomistic-historians-use-of-tetrateuchal-narratives/oclc/276852204}}: "The subsequent declarations of Aaron's people and Jeroboam are almost identical: 'These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt' (Exod 32:4, 8); 'Behold your gods, O Israel, who brought you up from the land ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewish views==
[[File:Book of Exodus Chapter 33-8 (Bible Illustrations by Sweet Media).jpg|thumb|The Levites killed about 3,000 Israelites who worshipped the Golden Calf (1984 illustration by Jim Padgett)]]
In ''[[Legends of the Jews]]'', the Conservative rabbi and scholar [[Louis Ginzberg]] wrote that the worship of the golden calf was the disastrous consequence for Israel who took a mixed multitude in [[The Exodus|their exodus]] from Egypt. Had not the mixed multitude joined them, Israel would not have been misled to worship this molten idol. The form of calf itself came from a magical virtue of an ornament leaf with the image of the bull which is made by [[Aaron]].&lt;ref name=Ginzberg&gt;Ginzberg, Louis (1909). ''The Legends of the Jews Volume III : The Golden Calf'' (Translated by Henrietta Szold) Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society&lt;/ref&gt;

The devotion of Israel to this worship of the calf was partly explained by a circumstance at [[Crossing the Red Sea|passing through the Red Sea]], when they beheld the most distinct creature about the Celestial Throne which is the resemblance of ox, then they thought it was an ox who had helped God in their journey from Egypt.&lt;ref name=Ginzberg/&gt; After seeing [[Hur (Bible)|Hur]] son of [[Miriam]] who was carelessly murdered by the people following his rebuke of their ingratitude action to God, [[Aaron]] was willing rather to take a sin upon himself to make an idol than to cast the burden of an evil deed upon the people if they commit so terrible sin of killing a priest and prophet among them.&lt;ref name=Ginzberg/&gt;

Also there would be among the Israelites no [[priestly caste]], and the nation would have been a nation of priests only if Israel had not sinned through worshiping the golden calf that the greater part of the people lost the right to priesthood, except the [[tribe of Levi]] as the only tribe who remained faithful to God and did not partake in this sinful deed.&lt;ref&gt;Ginzberg, Louis (1909) ''The Legends of the Jews Volume III : The Revelations in the Tabernacle'' (Translated by Henrietta Szold) Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islamic narrative==
{{tone|section|date=April 2012}}
{{See also|Moses in Islam|Islamic view of Aaron}}
{{Musa|related}}
The incident of the worship of the golden calf is narrated in the [[Quran]] and other Islamic literature. The Quran narrates that after they refused to enter the promised land, God decreed that as punishment the Israelites would wander for forty years. Moses continued to lead the Israelites to [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]] for divine guidance. According to Islamic literature, God ordered Moses to [[fasting|fast]] for thirty days, and upon near completion of the thirty days, Moses ate a scented plant to improve the odour of his mouth. God commanded Moses to fast for ten more days, before receiving the guidance for the Israelites. When Moses completed the fasts, he approached God for guidance. During this time, Moses had instructed the Israelites that Aaron (''[[Harun]]'') was to lead them. The Israelites grew restless, since Moses had not returned to them, and after thirty days, a man the Quran names [[Samiri (Islamic figure)|Samiri]] raised doubts among the Israelites. Samiri claimed that Moses had forsaken the Israelites and ordered his followers among the Israelites to light a fire and bring him all the jewelry and gold ornaments they had.&lt;ref name="M. Th Houtsma 136"&gt;{{cite book|title=First encyclopaedia of Islam: 1913-1936|author=M. Th Houtsma|page=136|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=sP_hVmik-QYC&amp;pg=PA136&amp;dq=golden+calf+islam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=u5j2T4DfD4S0-QaextDwBg&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samiri fashioned the gold into a golden calf along with the dust on which the angel Gabriel had trodden, which he proclaimed to be the God of Moses and the God who had guided them out of Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Prophets, Their Lives and Their Stories|author=Abdul-Sahib Al-Hasani Al-'amili|page=354|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9YyYS_hjKpEC&amp;pg=PA356&amp;dq=the+prophets+their+lives+and+their+stories+punishment+of+the+golden+calf&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4pf2T962PMbO-gaKgPHHBg&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAw}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a sharp contrast between the Quranic and the biblical accounts of the prophet Aaron's actions. The Quran mentions that Aaron attempted to guide and warn the people from worshipping the golden calf. However, the Israelites refused to stop until Moses had returned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Stories of the Prophets - قصص الانبياء|author=IslamKotob, Sayyed Abul Hasan Ali Nadwi|page=115|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mXlHIskrYXEC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;dq=prophets+stories+islam+musa+the+torah&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Zpv2T6LpEom8-QbZsrjcBg&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The righteous separated themselves from the pagans. God informed Moses that he had tried the Israelites in his absence and that they had failed by worshipping the golden calf.

Returning to the Israelites in great anger, Moses asked Aaron why he had not stopped the Israelites when he had seen them worshipping the golden calf. The Quran reports that Aaron stated that he did not act due to the fear that Moses would blame him for causing divisions among the Israelites. Moses realized his helplessness in the situation, and both prayed to God for forgiveness [http://al-quran.info/#7:150 (Qur'an 7:167-174]). Moses then questioned Samiri for the creation of the golden calf; Samiri justified his actions by stating that he had thrown the dust of the ground upon which Gabriel had tread on into the fire because his [[soul]] had suggested it to him.&lt;ref name="M. Th Houtsma 136"/&gt; Moses informed him that he would be banished and that they would burn the golden calf and spread its dust into the sea. Moses ordered seventy delegates to repent to God and pray for forgiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Stories of the Prophets - قصص الانبياء|author=IslamKotob, Sayyed Abul Hasan Ali Nadwi|page=113|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=mXlHIskrYXEC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;dq=prophets+stories+islam+musa+the+torah&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Zpv2T6LpEom8-QbZsrjcBg&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The delegates traveled alongside Moses to Mount Sinai, where they witnessed the speech between him and God but refused to believe until they had witnessed God with their sight. As punishment, God struck the delegates with lightning and killed them with a violent earthquake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Al-Islam: Inception to Conclusion|author=Iftikhar Ahmed Mehar|page=123|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=O0gypGNaj3kC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;dq=golden+calf+islam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9p32T7_iF8j0-gb7wcTaBg&amp;ved=0CF4Q6AEwBw}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moses prayed to God for their forgiveness. God forgave and [[Resurrection|resurrected]] them and they continued on their journey.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

In the Islamic view, the calf-worshipers' sin had been [[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]] ({{lang-ar|شرك}}), the sin of [[idolatry]] or [[polytheism]]. Shirk is the deification or worship of anyone or anything other than [[God in Islam|Allah]], or more literally the establishment of "partners" placed beside God, a most serious and unforgivable sin, with the calf-worshipers' being ultimately forgiven being a mark of special forbearance by Allah.

==Criticism and interpretation==
{{One source|section|date=April 2015}}
Despite a seemingly simplistic façade, the golden calf narrative is complex. According to [[Michael Coogan]], it seems that the golden calf was not an idol for another god, and thus a [[false god]].&lt;ref name=coogan115&gt;{{cite book |author=Coogan, M. |title=A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: The Hebrew Bible in its context |year=2009 |page=115 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; He cites {{bibleverse||Exodus|32:4-5|HE}} as evidence:
{{quote|He [Aaron] took the gold from them, formed it in a mold, and cast an image of a calf; and they said, "These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt!" When Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation and said, "Tomorrow shall be a festival to the {{Lord}} ([[Yahweh]])."}} Importantly, there is a single calf in this narrative. While the people refer to it as representative of the "gods", this is a possessive form of the word Elohim ({{hebrew|אֱלֹהֶיךָ}} ''elo'hecha'', from {{hebrew|אֱלֹהִים}}), which is a name of God as well as general word for "gods". While a reference to singular god does not necessarily imply Yahweh worship, the word usually translated as 'lord' is Yahweh {{Hebrew|יהוה}} in the original, so at least it can't be ruled out.&lt;ref name=coogan115 /&gt;  It should also be noted that "in the chronology of the narrative of the Ten Commandments" the commandment against the creation of graven images had not yet been given to the people when they pressed upon Aaron to help them make the calf, and that such behavior was not yet explicitly outlawed.&lt;ref name=coogan115 /&gt;

Another understanding of the golden calf narrative is that the calf was meant to be the pedestal of Yahweh. In Near Eastern art, gods were often depicted standing on an animal, rather than seated on a throne.&lt;ref name=coogan115 /&gt; This reading suggests that the golden calf was merely an alternative to the [[ark of the covenant]] or the [[cherubim]] upon which Yahweh was enthroned.&lt;ref name=coogan115 /&gt;

The reason for this complication may be understood as
:(1) a criticism of Aaron, as the founder of one priestly house that rivaled the priestly house of Moses, and/or
:(2) as "an attack on the northern kingdom of Israel."&lt;ref name=coogan115 /&gt;
The second explanation relies on the "sin of [[Jeroboam]]," who was the first king of the northern kingdom, as the cause of the northern kingdom’s fall to Assyria in 722&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref name=coogan115 /&gt; Jeroboam’s "sin" was creating two calves of gold, and sending one to [[Bethel]] as a worship site in the south of the Kingdom, and the other to [[Dan (ancient city)|Dan]] as a worship site in the north, so that the people of the northern kingdom would not have to continue to go to Jerusalem to worship (see 1&amp;nbsp;Kings&amp;nbsp;12:26–30). According to Coogan, this episode is part of the Deuteronomistic history, written in the southern [[Kingdom of Judah]], after the fall of the northern kingdom, which was biased against the northern kingdom.&lt;ref name=coogan115 /&gt; Coogan maintains that Jeroboam was merely presenting an alternative to the [[cherubim]] of the Temple in Jerusalem, and that calves did not indicate non-Yahwehistic worship.&lt;ref name=coogan115 /&gt;

The [[documentary hypothesis]] can be used to further understand the layers of this narrative: it is plausible that the earliest story of the golden calf was preserved by [[Elohist|E]] (Israel source) and originated in the Northern kingdom. When E and [[Jahwist|J]] (Judah source) were combined after the fall of northern kingdom, "the narrative was reworked to portray the northern kingdom in a negative light," and the worship of the calf was depicted as "polytheism, with the suggestion of a sexual orgy" (see Exodus&amp;nbsp;32:6). When compiling the narratives, [[Priestly source|P]] (a later Priest source from Jerusalem) may have minimized Aaron’s guilt in the matter, but preserved the negativity associated with the calf.&lt;ref name=coogan115 /&gt;

Alternatively it could be said that there is no golden calf story in the J source, and if it is correct that the Jeroboam story was the original as stated by Friedman, then it is unlikely that the golden calf events as described in Exodus occurred at all. Friedman states that the smashing of the [[Ten Commandments]] by [[Moses]] when he beheld the worship of the golden calf, is really an attempt to cast into doubt the validity of Judah's central shrine, the [[Ark of the Covenant]]. "The author of E, in fashioning the golden calf story, attacked both the Israelite and Judean religious establishments." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Friedman, Richard Elliott |title=Who Wrote the Bible? |year=1987 |page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As to the likelihood that these events ever took place, on the one hand there are two versions of the ten commandments story, in E (Exodus&amp;nbsp;20) and J (Exodus&amp;nbsp;34), this gives some antiquity and there may be some original events serving as a basis to the stories. The Golden Calf story is only in the E version and a later editor added in an explanation that God made a second pair of tablets to give continuity to the J story.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Richard Elliott. 2003. ''The Bible with Sources Revealed'', p&amp;nbsp;177.&lt;/ref&gt; The actual Ten Commandments as given in Exodus&amp;nbsp;20 were also inserted by the redactor who combined the various sources.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Richard Elliott. 2003. ''The Bible with Sources Revealed'', p&amp;nbsp;153.&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeologists [[Israel Finkelstein]] and [[Neil Asher Silberman]] say that while archaeology has found traces left by small bands of hunter-gatherers in the Sinai, there is no evidence at all for the large body of people described in the Exodus story: "The conclusion – that Exodus did not happen at the time and in the manner described in the Bible – seems irrefutable ... repeated excavations and surveys throughout the entire area have not provided even the slightest evidence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Finkelstein, Israel |author2=Silberman, Neil Asher |year=2001 |title=The Bible Unearthed |page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As adoration of wealth===
A metaphoric interpretation emphasizes the "gold" part of "golden calf" to criticize the pursuit of wealth. This usage can be found in Spanish&lt;ref name="DRAE"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltObtenerHtml?LEMA=becerro&amp;SUPIND=0&amp;CAREXT=10000&amp;NEDIC=No#becerro_de_oro. |title=becerro de oro |website=[[Diccionario de la Real Academia Española]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; where [[Mammon]], the Gospel personification of idolatry of wealth, is not so current.

'''Haerlempjes''' refer to a specific [[genre]] of [[landscape painting]] that includes a view of [[Haarlem]] (formerly spelled ''Haerlem''). It is used most often to refer to [[Jacob van Ruisdael]]'s panoramic views of the city, but the term is derived from mentions in Haarlem archives as a type of painting included in household inventories.&lt;ref name=Haerlem&gt;'Woonplaats op een hoogte', Haerlem Jaarboek (1994), Historische Werkgroep Haerlem, pp 23-34&lt;/ref&gt; The [[diminutive]] suffix "pje" would denote a small, cabinet-sized painting, but even the largest landscapes may be referred to as ''Haerlempjes'' today.
==Background==
[[File:Situatie schets van dolhuys ten tijde van beleg van haarlem.JPG|thumb|View of Haarlem from the North during the [[siege of Haarlem]], historical print from 1628]]

In his biography of [[Albert van Ouwater]], [[Karel van Mander]] claimed that ''It is said from the mouths of the oldest painters, that landscape painting originated in Haarlem''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/mand001schi01_01/mand001schi01_01_0186.php "Daer wort oock gheseyt en getuyght, uyt de monden der oudtste Schilders, dat te Haerlem is van oudts ontstaen, en begonnen de beste en eerste maniere van Landtschap te maken."] in Van Mander's [[Schilder-boeck]] in the [[Digital Library for Dutch Literature]]&lt;/ref&gt; Van Mander was writing in 1604 for his Haarlem-sponsored [[Schilder-boeck]], and his was one of many initiatives to rebuild the city and glorify its history. After his book was published, the city attracted several landscape painters in the 1620s, including [[Esaias van de Velde]], [[Jan van Goyen]] and the Ruisdael brothers [[Salomon van Ruysdael|Salomon]] and [[Isaack van Ruisdael|Isaack]].

Haarlem is a bustling city today that makes up part of the [[Randstad]] area of the Netherlands, so it helps when looking at these old paintings to orient oneself according to old maps.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Hobbyists love to look at older Haarlem cityscapes and pick out features such as steeples and boats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haarlemopdekaart.nl/ Website for 2014 exhibition] by North Holland Archives showing Haarlem skyline photos superimposed on a map&lt;/ref&gt; For paintings traditionally called Haerlempjes, such features have been proven to be based more on historical accuracy rather than artist fantasy.&lt;ref name=Biesboer&gt;''Topografische identificatie van een aantal Haerlempjes van Jacob van Ruisdael'', by [[Pieter Biesboer]], published in: ''Textiel aan het Spaarne : Haarlem : van linnen damast tot zijden linten'', Textielcommissie Nederland, Amsterdam, 1997 {{ISBN|978-90-800872-1-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though fantasy cityscapes were popular in the Netherlands throughout the 17th-century, these seem to be more often pastiches of southern harbours or italianate landscapes, rather than places that artists had conceivably visited. Today, for example, it is assumed that Jacob van Ruisdael worked in [[View of Bentheim Castle|Bentheim]] because he painted many accurate views of the castle there. However, he often painted such castle views situated in a fantasy landscape on a mountain top, though the castle is in fact situated in low rolling countryside. In Haarlem, though he painted many ''dunescapes'' of the [[Kennemerland]] area, he never turned those dunes into mountains.
==Early views of Haerlem==
Most travellers visiting Haarlem in the middle of the 17th-century were on their way from [[The Hague]] to [[Amsterdam]] and saw the city from the [[Spaarne]] river, as most intercity travel was by [[trekschuit]] or sailing ship. Thus many early cityscapes are taken from the point of view of the river traveller.

==Dunescapes==
[[File:Landscape with a Sandy Road by Jan Steen Frans Hals Museum os 2011-13.jpg|thumb|Even the genre painter [[Jan Steen]] produced some dune landscapes in Haarlem in the 1640s, though it is unknown whether he painted any ''Haerlempjes'']]
The popularity of such river-based cityscapes were offset by another type of landscape with dunes or windmills that included a Haarlem cityscape on the horizon.

==Panoramas of Haerlem==
[[File:View of Haarlem with Bleaching Grounds c1665 Ruisdael.jpg|thumb|''[[View of Haarlem with Bleaching Fields]],'' viewpoint somewhat higher in the air than the highest point of ''Het Kopje'', by Jacob van Ruisdael, c.1665]]
[[File:Jacob van Ruisdael - Bleaching Fields to the North-Northeast of Haarlem.jpg|thumb|So-called ''Bleaching Fields to the North-Northeast of Haarlem'', actually showing bleaching fields in Heemstede to the south of Haarlem, by Jacob van Ruisdael, 1670s]]
[[File:Cornelis van Noorde - View of the Kleverlaan near Bloemendaal - 1763.jpg|thumb|This watercolor from 1763 by [[Cornelis van Noorde]] shows how high the dunes of Bloemendaal used to be. This is a view of the Kleverlaan from the perspective of the Huis ter Kleef. "Clercq and Beeck", still owned by the De Clercq family a century later, is here on the left.]]
It wasn't until the 1650s that the production of the panoramic views began that were later copied by others. Perhaps the most famous is Ruisdael's view of Haarlem bleaching fields from the north-east, which is why many assumed that all Haerlempjes were painted from the same perspective, not realizing that the entire area is relatively flat and so they were painted from an imaginary point somewhere up in the air, and not from a mountaintop. There is a high dune in [[Bloemendaal]] called ''Het Kopje'' and there used to be a ridge of high dunes in [[Heemstede]] that were later slowly removed by sand-barges for use in building foundations for the mansions in the Amsterdam expansion known today as the [[Canals of Amsterdam]]. On older maps, the ''Sant-vaert'' is clearly marked where such barges once travelled. That canal still exists today and forms the modern border between Haarlem and Heemstede, and is called the ''Crayenestervaart''.

In 1997 [[Pieter Biesboer]] wrote a short article explaining the viewpoints of some of these paintings based on old maps, most notably the ''Bleaching Fields to the North-Northeast of Haarlem'' in the collection of the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]].&lt;ref name=Biesboer/&gt; This painting, despite its title, does not show Haarlem from the north at all, but shows Haarlem from the south, from an imaginary point somewhere above the old dune ridge near the street known as the ''Blekersvaart'' in Heemstede, probably close to the ''Dorstige Kuil'', an inn favored by artists in the 17th century. The church in the painting clearly shows the curved side of the choir on the right rather than the left.&lt;ref name=Biesboer/&gt; Biesboer noticed also that this painting displays many more trees, which is logical because the park [[Haarlemmerhout]] is situated there.&lt;ref name=Biesboer/&gt;

In the same article a few other paintings are mentioned, including a Ruisdael view of Haarlem bleaching fields in the collection of the [[Montreal Museum of Fine Arts]], which shows the ruins of [[Huis ter Kleef]], also shown from the same perspective in a painting in the [[musée Jacquemart-André]].&lt;ref name=Biesboer/&gt; He was able to trace the bleachery ''Clercq and Beeck'' situated on the Kleverlaan shown in the right foreground in this painting to one owned by [[Lucas de Clercq]], whose portrait was painted by [[Frans Hals]].&lt;ref name=Biesboer/&gt; This scene of Clercq and Beeck was painted again by Ruisdael with some more detail in the version located in the [[Mauritshuis]].&lt;ref name=Biesboer/&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The painting from the Mauritshuis is the same view of Beeck and Clercq as the painting in the Rijksmuseum, while the one in the [[Gemäldegalerie]] of the same general view seems between those and the one in Montreal:

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[File:Rembrandt 237.jpg|thumb|''The [[Goldweigher's Field]]'', by [[Rembrandt]], 1650-1651]]
Though not all of these panoramic paintings show [[bleachfield]]s, these bleacheries were often also mentioned on maps, and served as easy points of orientation for those looking down on the landscape from high dunes. Possibly some of these paintings were commissioned by the bleacheries themselves for use in Haarlem shops where goods were sold and exchanged. Lucas de Clercq lived in Haarlem during the winter and on his Clercq and Beeck estate in the summer months. Even Rembrandt made a sketch of bleaching fields, though these were only identified as such a few centuries after the fact.

The ''Haerlempjes'' seemed to become popular not only in Haarlem, but were sold everywhere, and even various books were produced containing prints of such views of Haarlem by the Roghman family and others.

'''Heritage Preservation''' is an [[United States|American]] [[non-profit organization]] founded in 1973. Its mission is to preserve the nation’s heritage for future generations through innovative leadership, education, and programs.

==History==
[[List of dates in the history of art conservation|In 1973]], the National Conservation Advisory Council was organized in November, funded by the National Museum Act of the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. The NCAC surveyed national needs and became the National Institute for the Conservation of Cultural Property in 1982, and changed its name again to Heritage Preservation in 1997.&lt;ref name="AIC Bulletin 1974"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gilbert|first=Edward R.|title=National Conservation Advisory Council|journal=Bulletin of the American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works|year=1974|volume=14|series=Papers Presented at the Second Annual Meeting. American Institute for the Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works, Inc.|issue=2|pages=154–159|jstor=3179333}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Secretary of Interior Journal - Spring 1978"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berry|first=Betty|title=Writer-Editor, National Register Division|journal=11593 - Information Related to the Responsibilities of the Secretary of the Interior|year=1978|volume=Special Energy Issue|issue=Spring|pages=1–3|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/11593/Special-Energy-Issue.pdf|accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

One of its first major projects was called [[Save Outdoor Sculpture!]] (SOS!). Initiated in 1989, the project is a community-based effort to identify, document, and conserve outdoor [[sculpture]] in the United States. By fostering awareness and appreciation, SOS! aims to advocate proper care of a nationwide public resource.  The [[Smithsonian Museum of American Art]] has become an active partner in the SOS! Project.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian American Art Museum website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Research Programs|url=http://americanart.si.edu/research/programs/sos/|work=Smithsonian American Art Museum Website|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project may be viewed as a precursor of community-generated or “crowd-sourced” social media-driven initiatives.

The '''Hove amber cup''' is a [[Bronze Age]] cup that was discovered in a great [[round barrow]] mound which was crudely excavated in 1856, in [[Hove]], [[East Sussex]], [[England]], and is now in [[Hove Museum and Art Gallery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brighton-hove-rpml.org.uk/HistoryAndCollections/collectionsthemes/hovelocalhistorygallery/Pages/hoveambercup.aspx The Hove amber cup] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027000939/http://brighton-hove-rpml.org.uk/HistoryAndCollections/collectionsthemes/hovelocalhistorygallery/Pages/hoveambercup.aspx |date=2010-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found during the construction of [[Palmeira Square]].  The barrow was of exceptional size and quality, suggesting a date in the mid-Bronze Age. The Hove amber cup is one of only two found in Britain; the other was in [[Dorset]]. However, the two are not of the same style of craftsmanship.

Dated to around 1250 BCE, the amber cup was found in a [[Wessex culture]] grave in a coffin made from a treetrunk. Also in the coffin were a skeleton, a Camerton (Wessex culture) type dagger, a [[Sharpening stone|whetstone]] and a small axe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harding|first=A. F.|title=European Societies in the Bronze Age|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521367295|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EbIVASSe9jcC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;dq=Hove+amber+cup+dagger&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8yr7T4C5O6qx0AX1o72_Ag&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Hove%20amber%20cup%20dagger&amp;f=false|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been associated with a small group of other "unstable" cups with round bottoms, made of precious materials and found in north-western Europe.  Most are in gold, but also silver, amber and [[shale]]. The [[Ringlemere Cup]] and [[Rillaton Cup]] are the two British gold cups.  The amber would have come from the [[Baltic region]], and the group suggest early trade links between Britain and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Needham et al., full catalogue entry at pp. 97-99&lt;/ref&gt;

==Original account==
According to the original description by Barclay Philips, 
{{Quote|In the earth with which the coffin was filled were numerous small fragments of carious bone, apparently charred, some of which were picked out; and about the centre, as if, said one of the men, they had rested on the breast of the body interred, were found the following curious relics: —

An Amber Cup, hemispherical in shape, rather deep in proportion to its width, with a " lip " or " nick," and ornamented merely with a band of fine lines running round the outside, about half an inch from the top. There is one handle, large enough for the insertion of a finger, ornamented with a fillet on each side of the surface, which is flat, similar to that on the cup itself. From the fact of the rim not being perfectly round, and the band before mentioned not passing over the space within the handle, and its being marked off with a line at each end, seemingly cut across, we may conjecture it to have been made and carved by hand. There are two small chips in the rim.

That on the left of the handle is fresh, and was caused by the man who found the cup accidentally striking it, as he told me, with his spade, when he first came upon it ; that on the right is not so large, but is ancient, as is shown by its appearance. The cup is perfectly smooth inside and out, excepting where the earth in which it was buried still adheres to the surface ; but since its exhumation the amber has cracked slightly in every part. On the cup being lifted by the handle, this broke into two pieces, having received a blow from the workman's spade, but fortunately the fragments fit very exactly, and I have therefore easily repaired it.

The following are the dimensions of the cup, which I have carefully measured, expressed in inches and decimal parts: — &lt;br /&gt;
External diameter, 3.5 inches; internal, 3.35. &lt;br /&gt;
Height, 2.5 ; depth, 2.4. &lt;br /&gt;
Internal diameter at and below band, 3'; width of lip, '125. &lt;br /&gt;
Distance of band from upper rim of lip, .5; width of band of six fillets, .3. &lt;br /&gt;
Width of handle at upper and lower end, 1.5 in centre,"6. &lt;br /&gt;
Thickness of handle, '2; depth of handle from upper surface of insertion between lip and fillet to surface below, 1'4. &lt;br /&gt;
Projection of handle from surface of cup to outer surface of handle, .85; average thickness of cup, .2.

According to these measurements I find, by calculation, that the capacity of the cup is a little more than half a pint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Philips|first=Barclay|title=Discovery of a Tumulus at Hove, near Brighton, Containing an Amber Cup, &amp;c|journal=Sussex Archaeological Collections|year=1857|volume=IX|pages=119–125|url=https://archive.org/details/sussexarchaeolog09suss}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

'''''I'll Be Gone in the Dark: One Woman's Obsessive Search for the Golden State Killer''''' is a [[true crime]] book by [[Michelle McNamara]] about the [[Golden State Killer]]. The book was released [[wikt:posthumously|posthumously]] on February 27, 2018, nearly two years after McNamara's death.

McNamara became interested in the Golden State Killer case and wrote an article for ''[[Los Angeles (magazine)|Los Angeles]]'' magazine about the serial killer in 2013. She then signed a book deal with [[HarperCollins]] and began to work on a book about the case.

McNamara herself coined the moniker "Golden State Killer"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://time.com/4316653/patton-oswalt-remembers-michelle-mcnamara/ |title = Patton Oswalt Remembers His Wife, Michelle McNamara: 'She Steered Her Life With Joyous, Wicked Curiosity' |author =  |date =  |website = Time |accessdate = April 30, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to refer to the serial killer/rapist who had previously been referred to by various other names (e.g., Original Night Stalker, East Area Rapist, and the Diamond Knot Killer).&lt;ref name="Footsteps"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.lamag.com/citythinkblog/in-the-footsteps-of-a-killer/ |title = In the Footsteps of a Killer |last1 = McNamara |first1 = Michelle |date = February 27, 2013 |website = Los Angeles |archive-url = https://archive.today/20171020222155/http://www.lamag.com/longform/in-the-footsteps-of-a-killer/ |archive-date = October 20, 2017 |dead-url = yes |access-date = October 7, 2015 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

McNamara died in her sleep on April 21, 2016, at the age of 46.  At the time of her death, she had been in the middle of her hunt for the killer, and her book was unfinished.  Crime writer Paul Haynes, investigative journalist Billy Jensen, and McNamara's widower [[Patton Oswalt]] helped finish the book after McNamara’s death.

The book {{ndash}} McNamara's [[debut novel|debut]] {{ndash}} was released on February 27, 2018 (almost two years after her death) and reached the top of [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]] for non-fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Canfield |first1 = David |title = Michelle McNamara's posthumous I'll Be Gone in the Dark is a No. 1 best-seller |url = http://ew.com/books/2018/03/07/michelle-mcnamara-ill-be-gone-in-the-dark-no-1-best-seller/ |work = Entertainment Weekly |date = March 7, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book remained on the list for fifteen weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/2018/06/24/hardcover-nonfiction/ |title=''New York Times'' Best-Sellers: Hardcover Nonfiction |work=The New York Times |access-date=July 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jan Bogumił Rosen''' (16 October 1854 in [[Warsaw]] – 8 November 1936 in Warsaw) was a Polish painter of Jewish ancestry, known primarily for his battle scenes. His son was the muralist and mosaicist, [[Jan Henryk de Rosen]].

== Biography ==
He was born to a wealthy Jewish family that had converted to [[Calvinism]]. Later, he  became  a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]]. As with many artists, he displayed an early talent for drawing and received his first lessons from [[Franciszek Kostrzewski]].&lt;ref name="P"&gt;[http://www.pinakoteka.zascianek.pl/Rosen/Index.htm Biographical notes] @ Pinakoteka.&lt;/ref&gt; 

From 1872 to 1875, he studied at the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich]], then took private lessons at the school of battle painter [[Józef Brandt]].&lt;ref name="P" /&gt; His next four years were spent at the [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]] in Paris with [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] and [[Isidore Pils]].&lt;ref name="A"&gt;[http://www.agraart.pl/nowe/artists/rosen-jan-polska-agra-art-aukcje-obrazy-antyki.html Biographical notes] @ Agra Art.&lt;/ref&gt;

He lived successively in Munich, Paris and [[Lausanne]] then, having a wife and newborn son to support, he settled in Russia in 1891, where he became a [[court painter]] to [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]]; after the Tsar purchased his painting of [[Grand Duke Konstantin Pavlovich of Russia|Grand Duke Konstantin Pavlovich]] reviewing the Polish cavalry.&lt;ref name="P" /&gt; In 1907 he made a trip to North Africa, followed by a visit to Scandinavia in 1908. He did not return to Poland until 1921, after the [[Polish-Soviet War]].&lt;ref name="A" /&gt;

He is best known for battle scenes, especially from the [[Napoleonic Wars]], but also did  several works on the [[November Uprising]] prior to and after his residency in Russia.&lt;ref name="A" /&gt; Horses were among his favorite motifs and he was known for the attention he paid to precise details in his uniforms and weapons. Some critics, however, thought his paintings were only good for teaching history.&lt;ref name="P" /&gt;

The '''''Life of Castruccio Castracani''''' (Italian: ''Vita di Castruccio Castracani'') is a short work by [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]. It is made in the form of a short biographical account of the life of the medieval [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] [[condottiere]], [[Castruccio Castracani]], who lived in and ruled [[Lucca]].
[[File:Serravalle Pistoiese - Panorama.JPG|350px|right|thumb|A view of [[Serravalle Pistoiese]], which is set upon a hill with some sides being quite steep. Machiavelli describes an attack by the [[Lucca]]n forces of Castracani on the ridge of this town, that successfully caught [[Florence|Florentine]] forces by surprise.]]
The book is thought to have been written during a visit to Lucca in 1520. It was dedicated to Zanobi Buondelmonti and Luigi Alamanni. The former was also one of the two men to whom the ''Discourses on Livy'' was dedicated. Both, along with Machiavelli, are considered members of the so-called [[Orti Oricellari]] group.

Despite being in the form of a biography the sayings of Castracani are generally considered to have been fabricated by Machiavelli. It is therefore sometimes compared to his more well-known works including ''[[The Prince]]'', the ''[[Discourses on Livy]]'', and the ''[[The Art of War (Machiavelli)|Art of War]]''.

A distinct section of sayings appears at the end of the work, after Castracani's life has ended. [[Leo Strauss]], in 1958, analyzed the various speeches attributed to Castracani in this work and found that they had mostly come from classical Roman and Greek sources, including most significantly several that had been attributed to [[Democritus]] by [[Diogenes Laertius]].

Machiavelli treats Castracani as a person whose aim was to unite Tuscany, but who failed because, as Machiavelli has the dying Castracani tell his heir "[[Fortuna|Fortune]], who is admitted to be arbiter of all human things, did not give me so much judgement that I could early understand her, nor so much time that I could overcome her". This proposal that leaders can overcome the arbiter of all things is a common theme in Machiavelli's better known political works such as ''The Prince''.

By treating Castracani as a founder, almost, of a new state, Machiavelli used him as an example of the most important type of prince according to his other writings. In fact Machiavelli opens with a passage that treats prophets as the highest type of secular prince.

{{quotation|...the larger part, of those who in this world have done very great things, and who have been excellent among the men of their era, have in their birth and origin been humble and obscure, or at least have been beyond all measure afflicted by Fortune. Because all of them either have been exposed to wild beasts or have had fathers so humble that, being ashamed of them, they have made themselves out sons of [[Jove]] or some other god. Who these are, since many of them are known to everybody, would be boring to repeat and little acceptable to readers...{{harvcoltxt|Machiavelli|1958|p=533}}}}

Castracani was found as a baby left in a field, Machiavelli reports.

Machiavelli ends by touching upon another theme found in his other works, which is that Italy in his time was weak.

{{quotation|...because when living he was inferior neither to [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip of Macedon]], [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]'s father, nor to [[Scipio Africanus|Scipio of Rome]], he died at the age of both; without doubt he would have surpassed both if instead of Lucca he had had for his native country [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]] or [[Ancient Rome|Rome]].{{harvcoltxt|Machiavelli|1958|p=559}}}}

'''''Lithuanian Girl with Palm Sunday Fronds''''' is an 1844 oil on canvas painting by the Polish-Lithuanian artist [[Kanuty Rusiecki]] in the [[Lithuanian Art Museum]].&lt;ref name=museum&gt;[https://www.limis.lt/greita-paieska/perziura/-/exhibit/preview/20000001505144 painting record] on library website&lt;/ref&gt;

This painting shows a girl holding grasses and willow fronds on [[Palm Sunday]]. She is standing in front of a Baroque church and wearing traditional dress. Rusiecki was at the peak of his fame in Vilnius when he painted this picture. He specialized in portraits, but is also known for genre works that placed the local heritage in a monumental setting. This painting became so popular that it is considered today a symbol of the [[Lithuanian National Revival|Lithuanian 19th-century Romantic movement]].

The painting is similar to earlier work, but less obviously symbolic:

'''''Lydia Crocheting in the Garden at Marly''''' is an [[oil on canvas]] painting by [[Mary Cassatt]] created in 1880. It is in the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].

==Early history and creation==
Mary Cassatt's family had come to visit her at [[Marly-le-Roi]] in the summer of 1880 where the painter was living with her sister Lydia. Lydia, who suffered from [[Bright's disease]], had moved from Philadelphia to live with Cassatt after she had relocated to Paris. At the time, unmarried women did not live alone, but as Lydia's disease progressed, she was no longer able to travel. The remainder of the family joined the sisters in the summer of 1880 and Cassatt's work at that time shifted to images depicting home life. Lydia became a frequent subject of Cassatt's work until her death in 1882.{{sfn|Weinberg|2009|p=229}} Typically, Cassatt avoided [[plein air]] painting, though this work captures the sunlight, evidencing that it was painted in the garden.{{sfn|The Metropolitan Museum of Art|2016}}

==Later history and display==
The painting was first shown at the Sixth Impressionist Exhibition, in [[Paris]] with eleven other works by Cassatt in 1881.{{sfn|Clement|Houzé|Erbolato-Ramsey|2000|p=25}} In 1893, the painting was listed in the inventory of the art dealer [[Paul Durand-Ruel]]. By the following year, [[Peter Arrell Browne Widener]], a Philadelphia collector, had obtained the work. Later, Cassatt's brother [[Alexander Cassatt]] reacquired the painting and it remained in the family until Mrs. Gardner Cassatt donated it to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in 1965.{{sfn|Weinberg|2009|p=229}}{{sfn|The Metropolitan Museum of Art|2016}}

==Description and interpretation==
Immediately following the [[American Civil War]], paintings of women in the presence of elegant gardens became popular. Following this tradition, the work depicts Lydia in the garden, crocheting, though the painting distinctly sets Lydia apart from the blossoms.{{sfn|Farr|Carter|2009|pp=78-79}} Painted in an [[Impressionist]] style, the greenhouse and orderly rows of plants are behind Lydia,{{sfn|Weinberg|2009|p=229}}{{sfn|Marter|2011|p=415}} who is shown as occupied and seemingly unaware of the garden at her back.{{sfn|Farr|Carter|2009|p=79}} Her pale face and pallid complexion are offset by the tartan and lace-cuffed garment she wears. Lydia appears to be enjoying her time in the sunshine beneath her lace bonnet and gloves.{{sfn|Weinberg|2009|p=229}}{{sfn|Davey|2008|p=157}} ''Lydia Crocheting in the Garden at Marly'', along with ''Lydia Seated in the Garden with a Dog in Her Lap'' and ''Katherine Cassatt Reading to Her Grandchildren'' remain some of her finest pictures from this period of her career.{{sfn|McCullough|2012|p=393}}

The '''Magicians Association of Korea''' (variously also translated as the '''DPRK Magicians Association''' or the '''Korea Magic Association of DPRK''') is the national [[magic (illusion)|magicians']] association of [[North Korea]].

== History ==

Though [[Kim Jong-Il]] had made efforts to develop magic on a [[Juche]] basis in 1971,&lt;ref name="newmagic" /&gt; it was not until 2001 that a dedicated nationwide magicians' society was established.  The Magicians Association of Korea was founded on 24 October of that year, with headquarters in [[Pyongyang]] and ten branches across Korea.  Its goal is to contribute to the development of performance magic in the DPRK, and to foster cooperation with magicians and magicians' organizations abroad.&lt;ref name="founded" /&gt;

In 2002, the association was making arrangements to join the [[International Jugglers' Association]],&lt;ref name="newmagic" /&gt; and it was admitted to the [[Fédération Internationale des Sociétés Magiques]] in 2012.&lt;ref name="fism" /&gt;

== Activities ==

The association has developed magic acts for performance in the DPRK and abroad.

[[Image:Kaigetsudo Ando Yasunori - Bijin.jpg|upright|right|thumb|A ''[[bijinga]]'' hanging scroll painting by [[Kaigetsudō Ando]].]]
'''''Nikuhitsu-ga''''' (肉筆画) is a form of [[Japanese painting]] in the ''[[ukiyo-e]]'' art style. The [[woodblock printing in Japan|woodblock prints]] of this genre have become so famous in the West as to become almost synonymous with the term "ukiyo-e", but most ''ukiyo-e'' artists were painters as well as printmakers, with much the same style and subjects. Some turned to painting at the end of a career in prints, while some, like [[Miyagawa Chōshun]] and a number of the artists of the [[Kaigetsudō school]], never made prints and only worked in paintings.

Though advances in printing technology advanced over the course of the [[Edo period]] (1603–1868), allowing for the production of more and more elaborate and colorful prints, the medium of painting always allowed a greater degree of freedom to the artist, and involved a much larger product in any case; the paintings of many ''ukiyo-e'' artists survive today and are known for their bright colors, attention to detail, and bold brush strokes.

[[File:Caton Woodville - Battle of Kandahar.jpg|thumb|right|The 9th Queen's Royal Lancers during Sir Frederick Roberts' march to Kandahar 1879 by Orlando Norrie]]

'''Orlando Norie''' (1832–1901), artist of military subjects, perhaps the most prolific painter of the British army in the 19th century along with [[Richard Simkin]]. It has been estimated that Norie alone painted well over 5,000 pictures. Although his family were of [[Scottish people|Scottish]] descent, they had moved to the continent, and Orlando was born in [[Bruges]], [[Belgium]] on 15 January 1832. He spent most of his working life in [[Dunkirk]] where he painted many scenes, primarily in watercolor by the firm of [[Rudolf Ackermann]].
 
His work was first recognised in the autumn of 1854 when his print of the [[Battle of the Alma]] was advertised. This was followed by prints of the [[Battle of Inkerman]] and the [[Battle of Balaclava]], all for Ackermann's. This company's Eclipse Sporting and Military Gallery served as an outlet for many of the artist's watercolors. Norie was viewed as the natural successor to [[Henry Martens]], and Ackermann's were so pleased with his work that they occasionally profiled him in exhibitions, one of which was staged in 1873 to showcase his pictures of the recent Autumn Manoeuvres held in September and October 1871 around [[Aldershot]] and the [[Surrey]] heaths. 

A watercolour painting depicting the [[Battle of Fuentes de Oñoro]] 5 May 1811, by Orlando Norie (1832-1901) is in the collection of the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] &lt;ref&gt;Kamille Parkinson, PhD 'An Impressive Art Collection at RMCC' (Kingston, E-veritas, 25 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

His grave is in the old cemetery of Dunkirk adjacent to the Commonwealth War cemetery. Today, many of his pictures can be seen in British regimental museums and clubs.

A '''panel painting''' is a painting made on a flat panel made of [[wood]], either a single piece, or a number of pieces joined together. Until [[canvas]] became the more popular support medium in the 16th century, it was the normal form of support for a painting not on a wall ([[fresco]]) or [[vellum]], which was used for [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] in [[illuminated manuscript]]s and paintings for the framing.

==History==
[[File:Fayum Portrait of a Boy (detail).jpg|thumb|left|Boy from [[Al-Fayum]], 2nd century CE (a [[Fayum mummy portraits|mummy portrait]]). Encaustic on wood—note the cracks.]]
Panel painting is very old; it was a very prestigious medium in Greece and Rome, but only very few examples of ancient panel paintings have survived. A series of 6th century BC painted tablets from [[Pitsa panels|Pitsa]] ([[Greece]]) represent the oldest surviving Greek panel paintings. Most classical Greek paintings that were famous in their day seem to have been of a size comparable to smaller modern works - perhaps up to a half-length portrait size.  However, for a generation in the second quarter of the fifth-century BC there was a movement, called the "new painting" and led by [[Polygnotus]], for very large painted [[frieze]]s, apparently painted on wood, decorating the interiors of public buildings with very large and complicated subjects containing numerous figures at least half life-size, and including battle scenes. We can only attempt to imagine what these looked like from some detailed literary descriptions and vase-paintings that appear to echo their compositions.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 103-104 (illus. 105)&lt;/ref&gt;  The first century BC to third century AD [[Fayum mummy portraits]], preserved in the exceptionally dry conditions of Egypt, provide the bulk of surviving panel painting from the [[Roman Empire|Imperial Roman period]] - about 900 face or bust portraits survive.  The [[Severan Tondo]], also from Egypt (about 200AD) is one of the handful of non-funerary Graeco-Roman specimens to survive. Wood has always been the normal support for the [[Icon]]s of [[Byzantine art]] and the later [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] traditions, the earliest of which (all in [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]]) date from the 5th or 6th centuries, and are the oldest panel paintings which seem to be of the highest contemporary quality.  [[Encaustic painting|Encaustic]] and [[tempera]] are the two techniques used in antiquity. Encaustic largely ceased to be used after the early Byzantine icons.

Although there seem from literary references to have been some panel paintings produced in Western Europe through the centuries between [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] period, and Byzantine icons were imported, there are next to no survivals in an unaltered state.  In the 12th century panel painting experienced a revival because of new liturgical practices—the priest and congregation were now on the same side of the altar, leaving the space behind the altar free for the display of a holy image—and thus altar decorations were in demand. The earliest forms of panel painting were [[dossal]]s (altar backs), altar fronts and [[crucifixes]]. All were painted with religious images, commonly the Christ or the Virgin, with the saints appropriate to the dedication of the church, and the local town or diocese, or to the donor.  [[Donor portrait]]s including members of the donor's  family are also often shown, usually kneeling to the side.  They were for some time a cheaper alternative to the far more prestigious equivalents in metalwork, decorated with gems, [[Tooth enamel|enamel]]s, and perhaps ivory figures, most of which have long been broken up for their valuable materials.  Painted panels for altars are most numerous in Spain, especially [[Catalonia]], which is explained by the poverty of the country at this time, as well as the lack of Reformation [[iconoclasm]].&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 263&lt;/ref&gt;

The 13th and 14th centuries in Italy were a great period of panel painting, mostly [[altarpiece]]s or other religious works. However, it is estimated that of all the panel paintings produced there, 99.9 percent have been lost.  The vast majority of [[Early Netherlandish painting]]s are on panel, and these include most of the earliest [[portrait]]s, such as those by [[Jan van Eyck]], and some other secular scenes.  However, one of the earliest surviving oils on [[canvas]] is a French ''Madonna with angels'' of about 1410 in the [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin]], which is very early indeed for oil painting also.  In these works the frame and panel are sometimes a single piece of wood, as with [[Portrait of a Man (Self Portrait?)]] by van Eyck ([[National Gallery, London]]), where the frame was also painted, including an inscription done illusionistically to resemble carving.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 216&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Meister des Frankfurter Paradiesgärtleins 001.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Frankfurt]] ''[[Paradiesgärtlein]]'', a German panel painting from ''circa'' 1410]]

By the 15th century with the increased wealth of Europe, and later the appearance of humanism, and a changing attitude about the function of art and patronage, panel painting went in new directions. Secular art opened the way to the creation of chests, painted beds, birth trays and other furniture.  Many such works are now detached and hung framed on walls in museums.  Many double-sided wings of altarpieces (see picture at top) have also been sawn into two one-sided panels.

Canvas took over from panel in Italy by the first half of the 16th century, a change led by [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]] and the artists of Venice (which made the finest canvas at this point, for sails).  In the [[Netherlands]] the change took about a century longer, and panel paintings remained common, especially in Northern Europe, even after the cheaper and more portable canvas had become the main support medium.  The young [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] and many other painters preferred it for the greater precision that could be achieved with a totally solid support, and many of his most important works also used it, even for paintings over four metres long in one dimension.  His panels are of notoriously complicated construction, containing as many as seventeen pieces of wood (''Het Steen'', [[National Gallery, London]]).   For smaller [[cabinet painting]]s, copper sheets (often old [[printmaking]] plates) were another rival support, from the end of the 16th century, used by many artists including [[Adam Elsheimer]].  Many Dutch painters of the [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Golden Age]] used panel for their small works, including [[Rembrandt]] on occasion.  By the 18th century it had become unusual to paint on panel, except for small works to be inset into furniture, and the like.  But, for example, The National Gallery in London has two [[Goya]] portraits on panel.

Many other painting traditions also painted, and still paint, on wood, but the term is usually only used to refer to the Western tradition described above.

==Panel construction and preparation==
[[File:Angelsatmamre-trinity-rublev-1410.jpg|thumb|right|Russian [[icon]] by [[Andrey Rublev]], early 15th century, on a three piece panel. The raised edges are probably gesso rather than wood]]
The technique is known to us through [[Cennino Cennini]]'s ''The Craftsman's Handbook'' (''Il libro dell' arte'') published in 1390, and other sources.  It changed little over the centuries.  It was a laborious and painstaking process:
*A carpenter would construct a solid wood piece the size of the panel needed. Usually a radial cut piece was preferred (across rather than along the length of the tree; the opposite of most timber cuts), with the outer sapwood excluded. In Italy it was usually seasoned poplar, willow or linden. It would be planed and sanded and if needed, joined with other pieces to obtain the desired size and shape.
*The wood would be coated with a mixture of animal-skin glues and resin and covered with linen (the mixture and linen combination was known as a "size"); this might be done by a specialist, or in the artists studio.
*Once the size had dried, layer upon layer of [[gesso]] would be applied, each layer sanded down before the next applied, sometimes as many as 15 layers, before a smooth hard surface emerged, not unlike ivory.  This stage was not necessarily done after the 16th century, or darker grounds were used.

==Painting techniques==
Once the panel construction was complete, the design was laid out, usually in charcoal.

The usual ancient painting technique was [[encaustic painting|encaustic]], used at Al-Fayum and in the earliest surviving Byzantine icons, which are at the Saint Catherine's Monastery. This uses heated wax as the medium for the pigments.

This was replaced before the end of first millennium by [[tempera]], which uses an egg-yolk medium.  Using small brushes dipped in a mixture of pigment and egg-yolk, the paint was applied in very small, almost transparent, brushstrokes. Thin layers of paint would be used to create volumetric forms.

By the beginning of the 15th century, [[oil painting]] was developed. This was more tolerant, and allowed the exceptional detail of Early Netherlandish art. This used a very painstaking multi-layered technique, where the painting, or a particular part of it, had to be left for a couple of days for one layer to dry before the next was applied.

==Conservation and scientific analysis==
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 071.jpg|thumb|left|''Landscape with rainbow'' 94 x 123 cm, 1636-8. A large [[Rubens]] panel painting, with a panel made out of many pieces]]
Wood panels, especially if kept with too little humidity, often warp and crack with age, and from the 19th century, when reliable techniques were developed, many have been [[Transfer of panel paintings|transferred to canvas or modern board supports]].

Wood panel is now rather more useful to art historians than canvas, and in recent decades there has been great progress in extracting this information - and many fakes discovered and mistaken datings corrected.  Specialists can identify the tree species used, which varied according to the area where the painting was made.  [[Radiocarbon dating|Carbon-dating]] techniques can give an approximate date-range (typically to about a range of about 20 years), and [[dendrochronology]] sequences have been developed for the main source areas of timber for panels.  Italian paintings used local or sometimes [[Dalmatia]]n wood, most often [[Populus|poplar]], but including [[chestnut]], [[walnut]], [[oak]] and other woods.  The Netherlands ran short of local timber early in the 15th century, and most Early Netherlandish masterpieces are Baltic [[oak]], often [[Poland|Polish]], cut north of [[Warsaw]] and shipped down the [[Vistula]], across the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] to the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 29&lt;/ref&gt;  Southern German painters often used [[pine]], and [[mahogany]] imported into Europe was used by later painters, including examples by [[Rembrandt]] and Goya.

In theory, dendro-chronology gives an exact felling date, but in practice allowances have to be made for a seasoning period of several years, and a small panel may be from the centre of the tree, with no way of knowing how many rings outside the panel there were.  So dendro-chronological conclusions tend to be expressed as a "terminus post quem" or an earliest possible date, with a tentative estimate of an actual date, that may be twenty or more years later.

The  so-called ''Panel Paintings Initiative'' is a multi-year project in collaboration between the Getty Conservation Institute, the [[Getty Foundation]], and the [[J. Paul Getty Museum]]. The Panel Paintings Initiative is a response to the growing recognition that significant collections of paintings on wood panels may be at risk in coming decades due to the waning numbers of conservators and craftspeople with the highly specialized skills required for the conservation of these complex works of art.&lt;ref&gt;More information on the objectives of the project can be found on [http://www.getty.edu/conservation/education/panelpaintings/ The Getty website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of wood==
Artists would typically use wood native to the region. [[Albrecht Dürer]] (1471–1528), for example, painted on [[Populus|poplar]] when he was in Venice and on oak when in the Netherlands and southern Germany. [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452–1519) used [[oak]] for his paintings in France; Hans Baldung Grien (1484/5–1545) and [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Hans Holbein]] (1497/8–1543) used oak while working in southern Germany and England. In the Middle Ages, spruce and lime were used in the Upper Rhine and often in Bavaria. Outside of the Rhineland, softwood (such as pinewood) was mainly used. Of a group of twenty Norwegian altar frontals from the Gothic period (1250–1350) fourteen were made of fir, two of oak, and four of pine (Kaland 1982). Large altars made in Denmark during the fifteenth century used oak for the figures as well as for the painted wings. Lime was popular with [[Albrecht Altdorfer]] (ca. 1480–1538), [[Baldung Grien]], [[Christoph Amberger]] (d. 1562), Dürer, and [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] (1472–1553). Cranach often used [[beech]] wood—an unusual choice. In Northern Europe, poplar is very rarely found, but [[walnut]] and [[chestnut]] are not uncommon. In the northeast and south, coniferous trees such as [[spruce]], and various types of [[fir]], and [[pine]] have been used. Fir wood is shown to have been used in the Upper and Middle Rhine, [[Augsburg]], [[Nuremberg]], and [[Saxony]]. Pinewood was used mainly in [[County of Tyrol|Tirol]] and beech wood only in [[Saxony]]. However, in general, oak was the most common substrate used for panel making in the [[Low Countries]], northern Germany, and the [[Rhineland]] around [[Cologne]]. In France, until the seventeenth century, most panels were made from oak, although a few made of walnut and poplar have been found.

The oak favored as a support by the painters of the northern school was, however, not always of local origin. In the seventeenth century about four thousand full-grown oak trees were needed to build a medium-sized merchant ship; thus, imported wood was necessary. Oak coming from Königsberg as well as [[Gdańsk]] is often found among works by Flemish and Dutch artists from the 15th through the 17th centuries - the origin can be established by the patterns of [[growth ring]]s. In the last decade of the seventeenth century, [[Wilhelmus Beurs]], a Dutch writer on painting techniques, considered oak to be the most useful wooden substrate on which to paint. However, exceptions are seen rather early in the seventeenth century: sometimes walnut, [[pear]]wood, [[cedar wood|cedarwood]], or Indian woods were used. [[Mahogany]] was already in use by a number of painters during the first decades of the seventeenth century and was used often in the Netherlands in the nineteenth century. Even so, when canvas or copper was not used, the main oeuvre of the northern school was painted on oak panels.&lt;ref&gt;Wadum pp.149-177&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Paper Heart''''' is a 2009 American [[romantic comedy]] film starring [[Charlyne Yi]] and [[Michael Cera]] as fictionalized versions of themselves based on their rumored relationship, though Yi has said they never dated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/charlyne-yi-admits-relationship-paper-heart-co-star-michael-cera-article-1.398380 New York Daily News]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/07/movies/07paper.html?_r=0 The New York Times review]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/02/movies/02itzk.html The New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

The plot for the film is based on Charlyne Yi's original idea of a documentary, which Nick Jasenovec suggested would be accentuated with a fictional storyline.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Last Call with Carson Daly]]'' episode 1036&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]'' episode 94&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
[[File:JakeJohnsonCharlyneYiNickJasenovecByPhilKonstantin.jpg|thumb|left|Jake Johnson, Charlyne Yi, and Nick Jasenovec]]
The film follows Charlyne as she embarks on a quest across America to make a documentary about a subject she does not understand: love. As she and her good friend (and director) Nick search for answers and advice about love, Charlyne talks with friends, strangers, scientists, bikers, romance novelists, and children. They each offer diverse views on modern romance, as well as various answers to the age-old question: does true love really exist?

Shortly after filming begins, Charlyne meets a boy after her own heart: Michael Cera. As their relationship develops on camera, her pursuit to discover the nature of love takes on a fresh new urgency.

The overview of recent developments in '''public art practices in Korea''' (1999–2005) [[Public art]] practices from the last 5 years or so in [[Korea]] can be narrowed down to three major issues. The first issue is the dispute over the Art Decoration Law for buildings, which is the national cultural policy that mandates acquisition of public sculptures. The second is proliferation of gigantic-scale public art projects led by local governments. The third issue is new genre public art works that pursue activist ideals and social engagement. In this article, the Flying City and Oasis Project’s practices will be mainly discussed based on receiving major attention from the mass media and art field. These three issues not only reflect changes in Korean society but also make up characteristics of Korean public art practices.

==Public artwork sites in public spaces ==

Public sculpture sites in public spaces take up the majority of Korean public art practices in terms of number. The proliferation and popularity of public sculptures originated from the establishment of the Art Decoration Law for buildings when the Korean government was hosting the [[Olympic Games]] in 1988. The law mandates that an owner of a new building must earmark 0.7% of the construction cost to artworks for public view. The increasing level of urban population and the buildings constructed due to urban development resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of public sculptures. However, questions have been raised over the artistic quality over these works, especially because most of the public sculptures remain in [[modernism|modernist]] style, which was the mainstream at the time the law was first established. Disregarding communication with the public audience, these sculptures function merely as decoration of the spaces. Furthermore, only a handful of artists were repeatedly commissioned and even subcontracted to foundries resulting in more problems in the production and dissemination of public sculptures.

As such, these shortcomings stirred up more heated disputes coinciding with elevated levels of interest in public art, and led to the birth of the [[Public Art Council]] established in 2002 that opposes the current policies. The Public Art Council raised questions on the extent that current public art practices have provided artistic satisfaction to the public, who the actual audience is, and how relevant the works are to the lives of residents near the art sites. These issues concerning public good were the foundation of the argument by the Public Art Council demanding to raise the quality of public art. Furthermore, it suggested to the government an alternative policy to create a fund drawn from the building owners’ mandated expense when a new building is built by the Art Decoration Law for Buildings. Then the governing body of the fund would allocate money from the fund for operation in selection of artists, maintenance and conservation of the art works. Now the [[Korean Ministry of Culture and Tourism]] is seriously considering the suggestion to establish a new law. In light of the fact that Koreans spend 11.5 billion [[Korean won]] a year for Public Art (1997 Survey by Korean Culture and Tourism Policy Institute), the Public Art Association expects that a new policy can provide a larger number of artists with new jobs and other career benefits.

==Local government-led public art projects==

When civilian government came into power in Korea in the 1990s it introduced the Local Government Act. This made it possible for regional governments to act more freely and independently from the central government. This was followed by speedy development in small local cities. From its establishment local governments understood the importance of cultural projects in promoting the images of their regions and therefore commenced public art projects even though most of these projects turned out to be sculpture gardens. Recently, the direction of local government-led cultural projects has slightly changed towards large-scale public art projects coinciding with nationwide interest in concerns for the environment. The [[Anyang, Gyeonggi|Anyang]] City Government took the initiative in supporting the Supplementary Space Stone &amp; Water and Saving Our Anyang River Network to co-organize the Anyang River Project, FLOW, which is interconnected with the city’s urban development project, environmental improvement project, and beautification plan. At the event, murals were placed along various locations around the Anyang River as the center, photograph exhibitions were posted on billboards, and art objects were presented. In addition, the Anyang city government started a 21 billion Korean won (20 million US dollars) scaled multiyear plan to turn the whole city into an art park. The Anyang Public Art Project has been established in November 2005 as the first annual project.

The [[Seoul]] Metropolitan Government also kicked off a project in 2002 that restored the [[Chunggye River]], located between City hall and [[Shindab]], which was formerly covered over with a concrete-covered freeway overpass. The freeway was razed and the project was completed on October 1, 2005 after spending 1.5 trillion Korean won (1.4 billion US dollars) by the city government. This project is one of the steps of the city’s long term project to promote a higher quality of life for Seoul residents and to provide better [[environmentally friendly]] urban development planning. The inauguration events included performance, concerts, and an exhibition with 50 murals and installations along the river.

==New genre public art==

It was from around the year 2000 when new genre public art first appeared, emphasizing the site of public art and the collaborative working process with the residents of local communities, building on the foundation of the direct relationship between the local environment and the artwork. As this genre emerged it performed distinct activities in the [[Korean art]] field. Korea’s new genre of public art has shown aggressive tendencies in its social engagement. Two major artist groups - the urban research group Flying City, and the Oasis Project, are typical examples of art involving these social philosophies in art practices.

First, the urban research group Flying City was formed with Jeon Yongseok, Jang Jongkwan, and Kim Gisoo. They have conducted research on the impact that rapid industrialization has had on the city of Seoul since right after the [[Korean War]]. The area along the Chunggye River in particular, is the heart of post-war industrialization as well as the most historical site where they carried out series of public art projects.

Among them, Mental Map (2001–2003) was an investigation of the influence on the unconscious level. Here, the Flying City interviewed the residents in the area and asked them to create a psychological map in addition to drawing future maps of the area in which they would like to live. The Chunggye River is also the area that supported the very foundation of the development of Seoul’s industrialization due to its concentration of hardware stores, garment shops, and electronic appliance stores. It is even said that there is no brand of goods in the world that has not been copied and sold along Chunggye-river. People have also been known to say that a space satellite could be assembled because one could collect and buy all the necessary parts sold in this area.

Flying City recently organized the Chunggye Mini Expo Project that introduced machine parts manufacturing stores in the area. In this project they studied the co-relationships between and among stores and then created a diagram to visualize their studies. They also turned the stores into temporary exhibition spaces by displaying actual mockups they created to sell and writing anecdotes about the mockups on their show windows encouraging the audience to visit the stores.

Kyongju Park, who is participating in the exhibition, Publicly Speaking, traveled to six major cities of Korea staging a migrant workers election campaign performance that urged a change of perspectives in the ways people regard 350,000 [[migrant worker]]s. At the same time, she surveyed Koreans on their reaction to the situation of migrant workers running for government. She also set up an [[Internet Broadcasting|internet broadcasting]] company for migrant workers.

Jihye Kim’s work at her exhibition, Invitation to Pyunghwa New City, presents the story of [[Pyongtaek]] city residents threatened with eviction from their homes due to the expansion plans of the Humphrey US military base. This area in Pyongtaek was once known as Daechoo-ri before the base moved in. Together with the town residents who have been living in the area from its time as Daechoo-ri, the artist organized a gathering and sang a Daechoo [[Boy Scout]]s anthem to call attention to the era when boys in the city were able to play ball games at the playgrounds which were the former sites that are currently occupied by the U.S. military base.

==The Oasis Group==
Oasis is the name of an artists’ group created by Kim Kang and Kim Younhoan as well as the name of a squat project. The group introduced the concept of “[[squatting]]” to Korea and worked actively with the mission of rejuvenating abandoned or decommissioned buildings. They have been trying to occupy the Korean Federation of Art Organizations (KFAO) building since winter 2004. This building was about 90% complete when construction was suspended and was left unfinished for the past 7 years despite the fact that the KFAO received combined grants of 22 billion Korean won (21.5 million US dollars) from both the ministry of Culture and Tourism and the [[Korean Culture and Art Foundation]] (KCAF).

The Oasis Group started to occupy the building by cleaning the site and playing on it, only to be stopped by an army of policemen. Later on, Oasis put on an advertisement announcing that office spaces in the 25 storey-high KFAO building were available for rent on the market and made a call for applicants. Oasis and 400 applicants to the office spaces then organized continuous concerts, exhibitions and performance demonstrations in front of the building requesting permission to use the vacant spaces as studios. Their request resulted in huge media coverage on the lack of accountability in KFAO’s mismanagement of the building as well as the two government cultural agencies that never followed up on the grants they provided to the KFAO.

KFAO sued the Oasis Group in court and Kim Younhoan and Byunghwan Lee from the group were fined 500,000 Korean won. Even during the trial process the group organized one-person performances and demonstrations in front of the office of the MCT. Later many art professionals participated in the art demonstrations. The number of participants and the level of attention and interest in this issue grew to unprecedented levels, more than any other project organized by an artist group. The group’s activities differentiated themselves by the complexity and diversity in their programming as well as their administrational efficiency during the office space distribution performance. The level of organization and efficiency has been compared to standards executed by larger-scaled NGOs.

However, the Oasis group actually occupied the building for only a few days. More attention should be given to the many art related rallies and cultural demonstrations against the KCAF and MCT that were organized by this group. This has shown their focus on their activities as cultural activism that urged reforms of cultural administration practices. .

==Characteristics==

The criticism by public art associations on the mismanagement of the Art Decoration Law for buildings, the Oasis group and their criticism of the funding administration practices by the MCT and KCAF, Jihye Kim’s Daechoo-ri Project dealing with the right-of-residence issue between the US military base and the native residents, and Kyongju Park’s performances on migrant workers eligibility in running for election to government posts, can all be considered as cultural activist work dealing with societal and political issues. They also have in common in their approach to their works sophistication in the level of organization and highly skilled administration and networking abilities.

In terms of members, the majority of these groups participated in the Minjung art movement in the 1980s when democratization of Korea began. For that reason, many people tend to associate the current public art practices with [[Minjung art]]. Minjung Art can be categorized as an activist movement committed to exposing the misdeeds committed by dictatorial regimes in power at the time. The work of Minjung Art eventually helped bring into motion changes in Korean social conditions. Arousal of public opinion, for example, seems to be one of their common approaches to successful execution of their projects.

Oasis employed this approach through organizing performances lasting over a month and accompanied by the introduction of an activist measure called squatting. Public art associations held numerous roundtables and symposia on the Art Decoration law to bring attention to the controversy over whether the true ownership of public art pieces lies between owner of the building or the residents of the building and its surrounding areas. Although public art associations must resolve the controversy that their methods could violate the rights of private ownership, their controversy indicates that civil society has come into Korea.

The demand of reform in administrative practices against the government’s funding agencies shows that such movements only come from the premise based on the political climate in which the government is forced to remain tuned to public opinion. One of the attributes of Korean public art practices can be stated as the majority of artists who are succeeding the socially engaging spirit of Minjung are now taking contemporary approaches focusing on finding resolutions for current social issues as the country’s political climate changes.

'''Purple''' is a [[France|French]] fashion, art and culture magazine founded in 1992.

==History==
In 1992, Elein Fleiss and [[Olivier Zahm]] started the magazine ''Purple Prose'' as a reaction against the superficial glamour of the [[1980s in fashion|1980s]]; much as a part of the global counterculture at the time, inspired by magazines like ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]],'' ''[[Ray Gun (magazine)|Ray Gun]],'' ''Nova'', and ''Helmut Newton's Illustrated'', but with the aesthetics of what usually is referred to as [[History of fashion design#1990s|anti-fashion]]. Based on their personal interests and views; ''Purple'' was, and in a sense still is, made much in the same spirit of the [[fanzine]]. The magazine became associated with the "realism" of the new fashion photography of the 1990s, with names like [[Juergen Teller]], [[Terry Richardson]], [[Wolfgang Tillmans]], and [[Mario Sorrenti]].&lt;ref&gt;Zahm, Olivier; Purple Anthology 1992/2006; Purple Fashion, Fall Winter 2008/09; Purple Institute, Paris 2008; p.68-69&lt;/ref&gt;

In the introduction of the ''Purple Anthology'', Zahm writes:
{{cquote|[...] We launched Purple Prose in the early 1990s without any means, and without any experience, because we wanted to make a magazine that was radically different. We wanted to support the artists around us that noone else supported, much less talked about. [..] It would be a form of opposition of our own, different from the critical jargon of the generation of '68. [..] From a visual standpoint, we represented the break from '80s imagery (like Richard Avedon's photography for Versace, for example). From an artistic standpoint, the artists of the early '90s were rising up against art as capital fetish [..]. In saying that Purple is the portrait of a generation, I mean it's a portrait of those who embody their times. At the same time, it's a portrait of myself and Elein Fleiss, our ideas, our lives, and our aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;Zahm, Olivier and Fleiss, Elein; ''Purple Anthology: Art Prose Fashion Music Architecture Sex''; Rizzoli 2008; {{ISBN|0-8478-3020-9}} {{ISBN|9780847830206}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2004 it  divided into '''''Purple Fashion''''' published by Purple Institute based in Paris and New York, and '''''Purple Journal''''', published by Les Editions Purple, based in Paris. On February 16 the first installation of ''Purple Fashion'''s new web site was launched.

The art director of Purple Prose and ''Purple Fashion'' was [[Christophe Brunnquell]] until 2006, when he was succeeded by [[M/M Paris]].

===Offspring publications===
Fleiss and Zahm's collaboration has resulted in many side projects:

*Purple Prose – published from October 1992 to winter 1998 (13 issues).
*''Purple Fiction'' – a literary magazine published between 1995 and 1998 (4 issues).
*''Purple Fashion'' – published between 1995 - 1998 (4 issues), and 2004 - (present).
*''Purple Sexe'' – a magazine devoted to sexuality, published between winter 1998 and 2001 (8 issues). The magazine was reborn as a one-off appendix for Purple Fashion Fall/Winter 2008/09, dedicated to Italian porn star [[Rocco Siffredi]].
*''Purple'' – a fusion of Purple Prose, Fiction, Fashion, and Sexe; published between summer 1998 and 2003 (16 issues).
*Purple Books – a publishing house (1998–2001)
*Purple Gallery – a Parisian art gallery
*''Purple Journal'' – a cultural magazine published 2004 - (present) in a French and an English version.

Since 2004, Purple is divided in two different publications; '''Purple Fashion''' magazine (edited by Zahm and published by ''Purple Institute'') and '''Purple Journal''' (edited by Fleiss and Sébastien Jamain, published by ''Les Editions Purple'').

A '''query letter''' is a formal letter sent to [[magazine]] editors, [[literary agents]] and sometimes [[publishing|publishing houses]] or companies. Writers write query letters to propose writing ideas.

For example, a standard requested format for a manuscript query letter to a literary agent could be approximately 200 - 400 words, expressing the following information:
* The topic of the work
* A short description of the plot
* A short bio of the author
* The target audience
The literary agent would then decide whether to contact the author and request to see the manuscript, based on the contents of the query letter. In this sense, the query letter is an author's first step towards getting his/her manuscript published.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3011">{{Italic title}}'''''Questions sur les Miracles''''', also known as '''''Lettres sur les Miracles''''' (''Questions/Letters on miracles'') is a publication by the French philosopher and author [[Voltaire]], written in 1765 and first published as a series of imagined letters by various people.&lt;ref name="gay"/&gt;

== Content ==
''Questions sur les Miracles'' starts with [[theology|theological]] questions, but moves on to repeat some of the defences of democracy and free expression that Voltaire had proposed in his earlier ''[[Idées républicaines]]'':&lt;ref name="gay"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gay|first1=Peter|title=Voltaire's Politics: The Poet as Realist|date=1959|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=New Jersey|page=215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Let us uphold the liberty of the press, it is the basis of all other liberties; through it we enlighten each other."&lt;ref name="gay"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The letters [[satire|satirically]] express Voltaire's criticisms of the English biologist [[John Needham]] who had promoted the idea of [[spontaneous generation]], of the French philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], and of the authorities at [[Geneva]] who had resisted greater democracy.&lt;ref name="Aldridge"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aldridge|first1=A. Owen|title=Voltaire and the Century of Light|date=1975|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=New Jersey|page=335}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="besterman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Besterman|first1=Theodore|title=Voltaire|date=1969|publisher=Longmans|location=London|isbn=0582112168|pages=447–448}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voltaire uses [[irony]] and [[sarcasm]] to convey his sceptical opinion on [[miracle]]s; one letter poses that miracles are authentic and, with exaggerated optimism, hopes that priests will manifest them. "We even hope that not only will these learned men work miracles, but that they will hang all those who do not believe in them. Amen!"&lt;ref name="besterman"/&gt; Voltaire thought that the alleged [[miracles of Jesus]] were best seen as moral lessons interpreted for a wide audience, rather than as real events.&lt;ref name="philips"/&gt;

One surviving copy has extensive notes by Voltaire on just the first letter, suggesting that he intended to revise the book into the form of a treatise rather than series of letters, but never completed this.&lt;ref name="philips"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Philips|first1=Edith|title=Some Changes Contemplated by Voltaire in His "Questions sur les Miracles"|journal=Modern Philology|date=February 1931|volume=28|issue=3|jstor=433669}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Saint Agnes''''' is a painting currently exhibited at the [[National Art Museum of Catalonia]].

== Description ==
A three-quarter length depiction of [[Agnes of Rome]] shows the saint in direct communication with God.  Her head is slightly raised, her mouth half open, and the fingers of her hand are spread open over her heart while with her other hand she caresses the Mystic Lamb.  Her neckline shifts sideways to reveal part of her shoulder, the highest degree of eroticism in the work of Stanzione.&lt;ref name=MNAC&gt;Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya: Guide, Barcelona: MNAC, 2005, P. 180-181&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The work was attributed to [[Massimo Stanzione]] in 1954 by José Milicua,&lt;ref name="MNAC" /&gt; who viewed it in the collection of Tomás Harris at that time.&lt;ref name=Milicua&gt;Caravaggio i la pintura realista europea / comissari José Milicua; coordinació científica María Margarita Cuyás. Barcelona: MNAC, 2005. Traducció a l'anglès p. 431-433&lt;/ref&gt;  The work made its way to the collection of Santiago Espona who bequested it to the [[Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya]] in November 1958.&lt;ref name="Milicua" /&gt;

== Analysis ==

In attributing this painting to Stanzione, José Milicua offers comparisons between this painting and another portrayal of the same saint by Stanzione which belonged to the Laliccia Collection in [[Naples]] which makes use of the same model and is differentiated only by a slight turn of the model's head.  In both paintings, Stanzione has dispensed with the halo and palm leaf, omissions that are common in Neapolitan painting of the 1600s.  Although lacking the traditional external signs of sainthood, her status as one of God's elect is evidenced in the raised head and upturned eyes, an open mouth, and the hand with fingers spread over the heart.  The block of stone closing off a corner of the composition is a device commonly used in Neapolitan painting of this century.  However, in the case of Saint Agnes, the stone block also serves to represent the altar on which the [[Agnus Dei]], or sacrificial lamb is placed.&lt;ref name="Milicua" /&gt;

Stuck to the back of the canvas are some lines of poetry in English in praise of [[Saint Agnes]], cut from printed matter which looks like it might be from the nineteenth century or earlier.&lt;ref name="Milicua" /&gt;

'''Secondary liability''', or indirect infringement, arises when a party materially contributes to, facilitates, induces, or is otherwise responsible for directly infringing acts carried out by another party. The US has statutorily codified secondary liability rules for [[trademarks]] and [[patents]], but for matters relating to [[copyright]], this has solely been a product of case law developments. In other words, courts, rather than Congress, have been the primary developers of theories and policies concerning secondary liability.

==Early case law==
Secondary liability in copyright has come about with case-by-case decisions. In other words, there has not been any real or consolidated theory. Furthermore, patent and copyright cases have tended to cross-cite each other. Examples of this are cases such as ''Kalem Co. v. Harper Brothers''&lt;ref name=kalem&gt;''Kalem Co. v. Harper Brothers'', [http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/US/222/222.US.55.26.html 222 U.S. 55] (1911).&lt;/ref&gt; (the producer of the movie [[Ben Hur (1907 film)]] didn't himself infringe, but was responsible for making and commercially distributing the infringing film), ''Shapiro, Bernstein and Co. v. H.L. Green Co.''&lt;ref name=shapiro&gt;''Shapiro, Bernstein and Co. v. H.L. Green Co.'', [http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/316/316.F2d.304.294.27979.html 316 F.2d 304] (1963).&lt;/ref&gt; (a booth in a department store that sold infringing sound recordings and the store was ultimately held liable), and the so-called "dance hall" cases (the operator of an entertainment establishment was held liable because he had effective control of the premises ''and'' obtained a direct financial benefit derived from charging entrance fees to the public).&lt;ref name=dreamland&gt;''Dreamland Ball Room v. Shapiro, Bernstein &amp; Co.'', [http://secondreporter.eu5.org/36f2354.html 36 F. 2d 354] (7th Cir. 1929).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Copyright Act of 1790]] did not provide a formal definition of infringement, stating only that “any person or persons who shall print or publish any manuscript, without the consent and approbation of the author or proprietor thereof... shall be liable to suffer and pay to the said author or proprietor all damages occasioned by such injury.” Furthermore, the [[Copyright Act of 1909]] simply provided that any person who “shall infringe the copyright in any work protected under the copyright laws of the United States… shall be liable” for various remedies.

Despite the fact that the [[Copyright Act of 1909]] did not explicitly establish liability for acts committed by a party different than the direct infringer, several cases decided under this Act set forth the guidelines under which a party may be deemed secondarily liable. Examples of the gradual recognition by courts of copyright liability extending to those who contribute to or vicariously profit from the infringing acts of others are ''Fishel v. Lueckel''&lt;ref name=fishel&gt;''Fishel v. Lueckel'', [http://secondreporter.eu5.org/53f499.html 53 F. 499] (1892).&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Kalem Co. v. Harper Brothers''.&lt;ref name=kalem /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert P. Merges, Peter S. Menell, and Mark A. Lemley (2007). ''Intellectual Property in the New Technological Era'', p. 572, Aspen Publishers, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kinds of secondary liability==
There are generally two kinds of secondary [[Legal liability|liability]] developed by courts – [[vicarious liability]] and [[contributory liability]]. Although the line between these categories of liability is blurry, a precondition for all forms of secondary liability is the underlying act (or acts) of infringement. However, unlike contributory infringement, knowledge is not an element of vicarious liability. [https://www.law.cornell.edu/ecourse/cases/netcom.htm 907 F. Supp. 1361, **36, citing 3 NIMMER ON COPYRIGHT § 12.04{A}{1}, at 12-70] (1995)

Some academics have classified the active inducement adopted in ''[[MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd.]]'' as a new type of secondary liability because it is based on express acts of inducement and not on a mere failure to act;&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Samuelson,[http://www.mttlr.org/volthirteen/samuelson.pdf ''Three Reactions to MGM v. Grokster''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706021534/http://www.mttlr.org/volthirteen/samuelson.pdf |date=2010-07-06 }}, 13 Mich. Telecomm. Tech. L. Rev. (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; furthermore, the specific intent to bring about infringing acts is another important factor in this analysis.

===Vicarious liability===
One of the theories widely accepted as a basis for liability in copyright infringement cases is vicarious liability.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Gorman and Jane C. Ginsburg (2009). ''Copyright Cases and Materials'', Foundation Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;
The concept of vicarious liability was developed in the Second Circuit as an extension of the [[common law]] doctrine of [[agency (law)|agency]] – ''respondeat superior'' (the responsibility of the superior for the acts of their subordinate). Pursuant to this doctrine, courts recognized that employers should be liable for the infringing acts of their employees under traditional master-servant principles. An example of this is ''M. Witmark &amp; Sons v. Calloway''.&lt;ref name=Witmark&gt;''M. Witmark &amp; Sons v. Calloway'', [http://secondreporter.eu5.org/22f2d412.html 22 F. 2d 412, 415 ] (1927).&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond the master-servant context, however, courts have extended liability to those who profit from infringing activity when an enterprise has the right and ability to prevent the infringement. Under ''Dreamland Ball Room v. Shapiro, Bernstein &amp; Co.'',&lt;ref name=dreamland/&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;“[T]he owner of a dance hall at whose place copyrighted musical compositions are played in violation of the rights of the copyright holder is liable, if the playing be for the profit of the proprietor of the dance hall. And this is so even though the orchestra be employed under a contract that would ordinarily make it an independent contractor.”&lt;/blockquote&gt; By contrast, courts did not extend liability to landlords who leased premises to a direct infringer for a fixed rental and did not participate directly in organizing or soliciting the infringing activity. For example, ''Deutsch v. Arnold'',&lt;ref name=Deutsch&gt;''Deutsch v. Arnold'', [http://secondreporter.eu5.org/98f2d686.html 98 F. 2d 686] (1938).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Fonovisa v. Cherry Auction''&lt;ref name=fonovisa&gt;''Fonovisa v. Cherry Auction'', [http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/76/76.F3d.259.94-15717.html 76 F. 3d 259] (9th Cir. 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; (extending liability to the operator of a swap meet who repeatedly leased booth space to concessionaires selling infringing tapes).&lt;ref&gt;[[Julie E. Cohen]], Lydia Pallas Loren, [[Ruth L. Okediji]], and [[Maureen A. O'Rourke]] (2006). ''Copyright in a Global Information Economy'', p. 481, Aspen Publishers, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

The landmark case on vicarious liability for sales of counterfeit recordings is ''[[Shapiro, Bernstein and Co. v. H.L. Green Co.]]''&lt;ref name=shapiro /&gt; In ''Shapiro'', the court was faced with a copyright infringement suit against the owner of a chain of department stores where a concessionaire was selling counterfeit recordings. The ''Shapiro'' court ultimately imposed liability, even though the defendant was unaware of the infringement, reasoning that the store proprietor had the power to cease the conduct of the concessionaire, and because the proprietor obtained direct financial benefit from the infringement.

===Contributory liability===
{{main article|Contributory copyright infringement}}

Contributory liability or [[Contributory Copyright Infringement|contributory infringement]] has been widely defined as a form of liability on the part of someone who is not directly infringing but nevertheless is making contributions to the infringing acts of others. Material contributions to the act (or enabling thereof), as well as knowledge of the act itself, are key elements of contributory liability. Additionally, in the course of performing such material contributions, the parties know that they are materially infringing copyrighted content.

Contributory liability is rooted in the [[tort]] theory of enterprise liability. Contributory liability holds the third party liable for the primary act based on the third party's relationship with the actual harm - either by enabling or by benefiting from it. As the court stated in ''[[Gershwin Publ’g Corp. v. Columbia Artists Mgmt.]]'': “one who, with knowledge of the infringing activity, induces, causes, or materially contributes … may be held liable as a contributory infringer.”&lt;ref name=Gershwin&gt;''Gershwin Publ’g Corp. v. Columbia Artists Mgmt.'', [http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/443/443.F2d.1159.606.35260.html 443 F. 2d 1159] (2d Cir. 1971).&lt;/ref&gt;

Not long after the passage of the [[1976 Copyright Act]], the scope of contributory infringement liability was tested in a case in which the copyright owners claimed that the sale of a recording device – the VCR - illegally contributed to infringement. In ''[[Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.]]''&lt;ref name=sony&gt;''Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.'', [http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/US/464/464.US.417.81-1687.html 464 U.S. 417] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919165747/http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/US/464/464.US.417.81-1687.html |date=2008-09-19 }} (1984).&lt;/ref&gt; was established a variant on contributory liability claims with respect to technologies. When Universal City Studios initially sued Sony for making and selling the [[Betamax]], the theory was that Sony materially contributed to acts of infringement performed by users of the Betamax, and knew or had reason to know that the technology would be used for infringing purposes. The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held that, even though material contributions and knowledge of the infringement are generally sufficient to establish secondary liability, in the case of infringing technology, contributory liability cannot be imposed unless the technology lacks substantial non-infringing uses. As the Court phrased the ''Sony'' exception with regard to new technologies: "The sale of copying equipment, like the sale of other articles of commerce, does not constitute contributory infringement if the product is widely used for legitimate, unobjectionable purposes. Indeed, it need merely be capable of substantial noninfringing uses."&lt;ref name=sony /&gt;

Regarding [[internet]] communications, sometimes the most promising remedy is only available from the standpoint of the internet intermediary (e.g. delete the post, take down the link). In fact, the internet is a special field for secondary liability, because the open architecture of the internet facilitates many communications and users need intermediaries in order to access and contact each other's services.

The question of whether [[Internet service provider]]s (ISPs) should be held liable for the actions of network users is unresolved.&lt;ref&gt;See K. A. Taipale, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=712101 ''Secondary Liability on the Internet: Towards a Performative Standard for Constitutive Responsibility''], Center for Advanced Studies Working Paper No. 04-2003 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; As to copyright, however, ISPs remain liable, in all territories, as primary, direct infringers of copyright for the copies they make on behalf of their customers, so the issue of additional secondary liability is less significant. An ISP's direct liability arises from the ISP's own actions, not the actions of another party. The confusion arises from the fact that two parties are directly liable in the usual case of internet infringement: the ISP and the ISP's customer. In legal terms, they are joint tortfeasors. This is because they both independently commit all of the acts necessary to establish liability under the copyright laws of most jurisdictions. In situations truly involving secondary liability, the party whose secondary liability is claimed has at least not committed one element required for an infringement action. This situation is not present in the usual ISP situation, as the ISP is always in the position of making copies (without authorization of the rights owner), so it is irrelevant that someone else has infringed the same copyright earlier in time. The ISP's liability is direct, not derivative. It is based on the ISP's own actions, not on someone else's.

Recent statutes in the United States ([[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] of 1998) and the [[European Union]] have provided significant, though not total, immunity from primary copyright liability that, in the absence of those statutes, would exist for ISPs.&lt;ref&gt;See D. Panethiere,''The Basis for Copyright Infringement Liability: The Law in Common Law Jurisdictions'', 13 [[European Intellectual Property Review]] 26 (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[DMCA]] states four safe harbors:
(a) Transitory network communications
(b) System caching
(c) Information storage and
(d) Information location tools.&lt;ref name=17usc512&gt;''[http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/512.html 17 U.S.C. §512]''&lt;/ref&gt; 
The last three have so called “notice &amp; take down” rules for specificity in notice of infringement, counter-notice and put-back and liability if false notice has been given.

In order to be eligible for the safe harbor provisions, it is required that the service provider has adopted and reasonably implemented a policy to terminate the accounts of repetitive infringers. In addition, ISPs must accommodate and not interfere with standard technical measures used by copyright owners to protect their works.&lt;ref name="17usc512"/&gt;

As to trademarks, in the absence of statutory guidance, courts have extended both types of secondary liability (vicarious and contributory) to third parties, including in some circumstances ISPs. Here, too, the question whether ISPs will be held liable for the acts of their infringing customers will depend on the degree of the ISP's knowledge and involvement in the specific infringing activity.&lt;ref&gt;See Jane Coleman, [http://www.secondarytrademarkinfringement.com/?p=95 ''Secondary Trademark Infringement: A Short Treatise on Contributory and Vicarious Infringement in Trademark''] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120913081422/http://www.secondarytrademarkinfringement.com/?p=95 |date=2012-09-13 }} (Revised, Sept. 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secondary liability in the future?==
Future treatment of secondary liability by US courts is uncertain. Some cases and commentators have argued for broadening secondary liability through [[cost-benefit analysis]], multi-factor balancing tests, or simply basing it on technical designs or [[business models]].&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Samuelson, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1002676 ''Preliminary Thoughts on Copyright Reform''], Utah Law Review (2007); UC Berkeley Public Law Research Paper No. 1002676.&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed EU directive would make aiding and abetting infringement a basis for liability.
In light of the above, it is permissible to conclude that there is no consensus on this issue.

[[Image:US map-South.PNG|right|thumb|300px|16 states and Washington, D.C. are defined as the Southern region of the United States by the Census Bureau. The 11 states in solid red are always considered part of the South. The inclusion of some of the 6 states in stripes is sometimes disputed. The Census Bureau does not include Missouri as belonging to the Southern region, but parts of that state are culturally more Southern than Delaware, another striped state which the Census Bureau includes in the Southern region.]]Art from [[Southern United States]], or '''southern art,''' includes [[southern expressionism]], [[folk art]], and [[modernism]]. Residents of the American South created works of art starting in 1607, however it was not until the early 1960s that southern art became recognized as a distinct genre.

The [[Ogden Museum of Southern Art]] in [[New Orleans]] houses the largest single collection of Southern art. In 1992, the [[Morris Museum of Art]] opened in [[Augusta, Georgia]], with a focus on Mid-Twentieth Century American Southern art.

==History==

The core of the American South consists of the eleven states that formed the [[Confederate States of America]]: [[Virginia]], [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Florida]], [[Alabama]], [[Mississippi]], [[Tennessee]], [[Arkansas]], [[Louisiana]], and [[Texas]]. Beyond these eleven states, there is some dispute as to which of the following six states should also be included: [[Oklahoma]], [[Missouri]], [[Kentucky]], [[West Virginia]], [[Maryland]], and [[Delaware]].

Of these six "border" states, Delaware and Oklahoma probably have the weakest claim to be included in the American South. Though a slave-holding state until the end of the [[American Civil War]], Delaware never seceded, and today is culturally closer to the urban Mid-Atlantic states of [[Pennsylvania]] and [[New Jersey]].

Oklahoma was a sparsely populated territory at the time of the Civil War, and though it contributed a regiment to the [[Confederate Army]], it never was home to the kind of [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] life typical of the American South.

In 1975, [[Southern Arts Federation]] (SAF) was founded with funding from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] to support and promote arts and culture in the Southeast.

Residents of the American South created works of art starting with the original settlement of [[Jamestown, Virginia]] in 1607. However, it was not until the early 1960s that art from the American South became recognized as a distinct genre. Collector Roger H. Ogden focused exclusively on the art of the region, and his donation of that collection to the Ogden Museum can be considered the first official recognition of the genre.

Southern art is more widely recognized as a distinct genre compared to the [[regional art]] of other geographic [[region]]s of the [[United States of America]]. This is a consequence of the unique role the American South played in the history of the United States. [[Slavery]], though legal in every one of the thirteen original [[colonies]], flourished and grew as an institution in the early 19th century in the American South, while it died out in the North. Political issues surrounding slavery caused the [[American Civil War]], and that conflict and its resolution defined the United States and American culture today more than any single event in history. For that reason, Southern art is an important element in the story of the United States of America.

[[Rowan Nathaniel House]] offers a fine example of Southern art. He was a Mississippi native whose artwork frequently portrayed southern life, in particular, that of former slaves and their role in the south of the early 20th century.

==Movements==
[[Image:Edward Hicks - Peaceable Kingdom.jpg|right|thumb|300px|example of folk art by Edward Hicks]]
Numerous movements are included in this broad category, including [[Southern expressionism]], [[folk art]], and [[modernism]].

[[Image:Southernexpress.jpg|left|thumb|300px|example of Southern expressionism by Catherine Clark Ellis]]
These movements are connected by the commonality of the Southern cultural experiences that formed the perceptions of the artists.

While [[Antebellum era|antebellum]] Southern [[portrait painting|portraiture]] has little in common visually with modern Southern expressionism, it is considered Southern art because it was created by Southern artists and its subjects were residents of the American South.

'''''Sunlight and Shadow: The Newbury Marshes''''' (c. 1871-1875) is an [[oil on canvas]] [[landscape art|landscape]] by [[Martin Johnson Heade]] acquired by the [[National Gallery of Art]] in 2010. Heade probably became acquainted with the [[salt marsh]]es near the mouth of the [[Merrimack River]] at [[Newbury, Massachusetts|Newbury]] and [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]] in 1859 through Bishop [[Thomas March Clark]]. ''Sunlight and Shadow'' is one of the earliest of Heade's one hundred plus depictions of [[wetland]]s.  

The National Gallery writes: "[Heade] depicted the tides, meteorological phenomena, and other natural forces that shaped the appearance of the swamp and showed how the land was used for hunting, fishing, and the harvesting of naturally occurring [[salt hay]] ... the painting's primary motif, sunlight and shadow, seen, for instance, in its intricate cloud shadows and the subtle movement from light to dark across the body of the haystack, informs and unites all its visual elements."

[[Henri Dutilleux]]'s '''Symphony No. 1''' was written in 1951. 

A composition from the composer's relatively early period, it is Dutilleux's first purely orchestral composition. It is written in a very classical form (four movements), but its language is rather free.  It is orchestrated for 85 instrumentalists.  The premiere took place at the [[Théâtre des Champs-Élysées]] on 7 June 1951, with [[Roger Désormière]] conducting the [[Orchestre National de France]].

==Structure==

The symphony lasts approximately half an hour.  It is written in four movements:

# ''Passacaglia''
# ''Scherzo molto vivace''
# ''Intermezzo''
# ''Finale con variazioni''

==Music==

This symphony demonstrates Dutilleux's attachment to the use of [[variation form]], which is found in the outer two movements.  The use of a [[passacaglia]] as a symphonic first movement is extremely rare. It consists of 35 repetitions of a four-bar bass motif, shown in the opening four bars by the double basses.  The second movement was defined by Dutilleux&lt;ref name="Ashgate Publishing, Ltd"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Henri Dutilleux|author2=Claude Glayman|title=Henri Dutilleux: Music—mystery and Memory: Conversations with Claude Glayman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NVVL66P9ycYC&amp;pg=PA33|accessdate=26 May 2013|year=2003|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-0899-8|pages=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an 'original and energetic scherzo', and very 'virtuosic and demonstrative'.  In the third movement, he develops a process that he uses more extensively in several later compositions: the main theme is not presented immediately at the beginning, but hidden in a slow evolution of themes (reverse variation).  The finale starts with a majestic percussion display, before returning to a calmer atmosphere.

The symphony was a big step for Dutilleux's career, as it demonstrated his mastery of orchestration. In 1955 it was awarded the UNESCO Mozart Medal in the inaugural edition of the [[International Rostrum of Composers]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2032">[[Wilhelm Furtwängler]]'s '''Symphony No. 3 in C-sharp minor''' was written between 1951 and 1954. It is in four movements:

# Largo
# Allegro
# Adagio  
# Allegro assai

At first, the four movements had programmatic headings: "Disaster," "Under compulsion to life," "Beyond" and "The conflict continues."&lt;ref&gt;Gottfried Kraus, liner notes to Orfeo d'Or CD C 406 961 B, translated to English by Lionel Salter. In the German original, Kraus gives the headings as "Das Verhängnis," "Im Zwang zum Leben," "Jenseits" and "Der Kampf geht weiter."&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his death, Furtwängler was still working on the last movement. In 1956, Joseph Keilberth conducted the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] in the première of the first three movements. Elisabeth Furtwängler did not allow the Finale to be performed until much later (a piece more complete than, say, the Finale of Bruckner's [[Symphony No. 9 (Bruckner)|Symphony No. 9]]). [[Yehudi Menuhin]] conducted the public premiere of the whole piece in 1986, four years after a transmitted BBC studio performance with the BBC Symphony Orchestra conducted by Brian Wright.&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Salter's translation identifies this as January 25, 1956, "the centennial of Furtwängler's birth," but that's actually two years after his death. The German original says January 25, 1986, "Furtwänglers 100. Geburstag."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discography==
To complement Furtwängler's own recording of his [[Symphony No. 2 (Furtwängler)|Symphony No. 2]] with the [[Berlin Philharmonic]], the Orfeo label recorded [[Wolfgang Sawallisch]] for this one with the Bayerisches Staatsorchester. Sawallisch's recording does not include the Finale, but [[Alfred Walter]]'s and [[George Alexander Albrecht]]'s do (conducting the RTBF Symphony Orchestra on Marco Polo and the [[Staatskapelle Weimar]] on Arte Nova, respectively).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2854">The '''Symphony No. 3''' of [[Douglas Lilburn]] was completed in 1961, in response to a [[sabbatical]] from [[Victoria University of Wellington]].  It was given its [[premiere]] the following year, and published by [[Faber Music]] (and co-published by [[G. Schirmer Inc.|Schirmer]]) around 1968.&lt;ref&gt;It was reprinted in 1976 by Price Milburn of [[Wellington]], and again in 1997, by [[Wai-te-ata Music Press]] (also of Wellington) (as part of a substantial Lilburn edition, publishing many of his works, including his as yet unpublished works, and continuing posthumously). See for some information e.g. {{OCLC|2406388}} (Schirmer/Faber), {{OCLC|152392072}} (Milburn reprint), and {{OCLC|57582720}} for the 1997 reprint.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[symphony]] was described by Lilburn as "a harsh, didactic personalised piece of searching rhetoric", and, indeed, of all his compositions, this is the one with the greatest [[twelve-tone technique|twelve-tone]] influence. It is a one-movement work in five sections, marked ''[[Tempo|Moderato]]-[[Tempo#Italian_tempo_markings|Vivace]]-[[Tempo#Italian_tempo_markings|Allegro]]-[[Andante (tempo)|Andante]]-Allegro'', and is shorter than his other symphonies, typically lasting some fifteen minutes in performance.

Unlike with his other symphonies, Lilburn provided a synopsis for this work:&lt;blockquote&gt;The first [episode], introductory, develops an idea heard from a solo [[bassoon]].  The second is an Allegro set going by solo [[trumpet]].  This reverts to the mood of the introduction until the [[Snare drum|side drum]] decides on another Allegro.  The fourth section is a slower one, again launched by trumpet and concerned with some dialogue for [[brass instruments|brass]].  This also returns briefly to the introduction, and the final section is in the nature of a fragmented [[coda (music)|coda]].&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in the liner notes to the Naxos edition&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The opening statement of the symphony contains a three-note rising figure which directly recalls ''[[Sings Harry]]'', Lilburn's [[song cycle]] to words of [[Denis Glover]], and some critics have identified Harry, and Lilburn's identification with the character, as the true subject of the symphony.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hoskins, writing in the liner notes to the Naxos edition&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Third Symphony'' was among Lilburn's last purely [[Acoustic music|acoustic]] compositions; soon after its completion he turned his attention to [[electronic music]], in which field he spent the remainder of his career.

Several recordings of the symphony exist.

[[Ferdinand Ries]] wrote his '''Symphony No. 7''' in [[A minor]], [[Opus number|Op]]. 181, during the spring and summer of 1835, 12 years after the composition of his Symphony No. 6 and the Sinfonie WoO 30 (Often referred to as Symphony No. 8). This is the last symphony that Ries wrote. It is Beethovian in style, and specifically influenced by Beethovens's [[Symphony No. 7 (Beethoven)|seventh]], [[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|sixth]] ("Pastorale"), and [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|third]] ("Eroica") symphonies.

This symphony is written in four movements and is scored for 2 Flutes, 2 Oboes, 2 Clarinets, 2 Bassoons, 4 Horns, 2 Trumpets, 3 Trombones (Alto, Tenor, and Bass), Timpani, and Strings.

==Movements==

# [[Allegro (music)|Allegro]] con spirito
# [[Larghetto]] con moto
# [[Scherzo]] Allegro non troppo
# [[Tempo#Basic tempo markings|Largo]] – Finale: Allegro vivace

==Composition History==
Supposedly, this symphony was a compositional commission, as Ries wrote to his brother, Joseph Ries on 9 March 1835: 
"I now want to write a symphony, which is ordered for Vienna." 
Ries appeared to have hopes about this symphony. The past few years for Ries were not the most uplifting for Ries. On 20 April Ries again wrote to his brother Joseph: 
"From my symphony, which I have in work, I promise myself a lot." So, we can see that Ries planned had a very substantial composition in mind when he wrote to his brother.
In early July Ries wrote to his brother to inform his about the beginning of the composition of the finale:
"From Vienna, a company lover has ordered a symphony with me, I am at the last Allegro, it will not be bad, I can tell you."

On 24 July he returned to the Viennese publisher Trentsensky &amp; Vieweg with the score. The score was sold to the publisher SA Steiner, whose owner was Tobias Haslinger on 31 August. 

In 1835, Haslinger played a key role in the organization of a symphony competition, whose publicity he hoped for in the sales opportunities of his publishing products. In order to participate in this contest the composers had been invited to submit their symphonies anonymously, but with a motto of identification, "to the kk court and private art and music therapy of Mr. Tobias Haslinger in Vienna frankly", as it is called in the official tender text published in various German-language music magazines. The winners waved a prize of 50 ducats and performances of the award-winning work in the prestigious Viennese Concerts spirituels . 

Haslinger acquired the symphony by Ries with the intention of submitting it as a competition contest in order to bring a prize-winning work to the market, in the case of a prize. The copy of the symphony, which had been sent to Vienna, received a new title without the composer's name, but with the motto "I have done my own." The fact that the work was actually submitted is confirmed by the publication of keys and foreign exchange of the 57 symphonies, which were recorded in December 1835; There appears as No. 15 a symphony in A minor with the motto " I have done my own." Ries himself does not seem to have asked for his consent and only afterwards has been informed of his involuntary participation in the competition; On 16 June 1836, he wrote to Joseph Ries:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"A new symphony will soon be released. You will remember that a company lover in Vienna ordered a symphony in Vienna last summer. I am now, to my great surprise, that Haslinger, who has always given me so bad a position, that I could never sell him a MS Wanted: / this Sinf: bought from these lovers to themselves and also entered the price work for symphonies. What you do not experience!"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The hope of the publication of the symphony was in vain; In January 1836 the jury had already announced the prize-winner, Franz Lachner, and some of the mention of particularly worthy compositions [8 ]; The symphony of Ries was not among them [9 ]; And Haslinger may no longer had been interested in its publication. This last symphony by Ferdinand Ries remained unpublished until 1982&lt;ref&gt;Ferdinand Ries, ''Three Symphonies'' ed. by Cecil Hill, ''The Symphony, 1720-1840, Series C, German: Manheim, South Germany, North Germany'' vol. 12, New York: Garland, 1982. {{ISBN|9780824038175}}&lt;/ref&gt;; Nothing is known about a performance. Ries himself seems to have refrained from his initial optimism with regard to the work.

This symphony was not published in Ries's time and no performances are known. The only recording of this work served as its world premiere.

Ries's symphonies were numbered, on the whole, in order, not of composition, but of publication and/or first performance in England. The publisher Schuberth also applied op.181 to Ries's ''Introduction et Rondeau à la Zingaresco'' for piano published in 1838.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hofmeister.rhul.ac.uk/2008/content/monatshefte/1838_01.html#hofm_1838_01_0007_14 Op.181 Introduction and Rondeau].&lt;/ref&gt; The 1860s Abschrift parts (manuscript copy) held at the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin use Op.181 to describe the symphony.

A '''Tour Accountant''' is responsible for the financial operations of a large scale [[concert tour]]. Normally, a Tour Accountant will report to both the [[Tour Manager]] (for all matters regarding tour financial operations), and to the Artist Manager/Business Manager (for overall financial reporting).

From a tour perspective, the Tour Accountant will normally: handle periodic financial transactions (either with Artist Management, or promoter), including per diem draw, wire transfers of both direct (Promoter &gt; Artist Management) and indirect (Promoter &gt; Tour Accountant &gt; Artist Management; usually box office receipts collected at settlement by Tour Accountant) funds, per diem distribution, hotel settlement, currency exchange (international tours), negotiate all local tax issues (concerning Artist earnings in each individual local market), and constantly work to clear up any "grey areas" during the advance, that have the potential to affect show settlement. Although normally, tour members will be paid by either Artist Management/Business Management, or accounting firm, the Tour Accountant will act as the "conduit" between the parties, while the tour is operating.

If a tour is not large enough to warrant utilizing a Tour Accountant, the [[Tour Manager]] will normally assume his/her responsibilities, as listed above. Generally, the only exception to this is if Artist Management travels with tour, and opts to handle the aforementioned.

The path to becoming a Tour Accountant usually involves either advancement through the ranks (a great deal of experience with a specific Artist, or Artist Management company), or via a more traditional route (secondary, post secondary education &amp; degree, followed by employment with either Artist Management company, or specialized Entertainment Accounting company).

{{Italic title}}
'''''True at First Light''''' is a book by American novelist [[Ernest Hemingway]] about his 1953–54 East African [[safari]] with his fourth wife [[Mary Hemingway|Mary]], released posthumously in his centennial year in 1999. The book received mostly negative or lukewarm reviews from the popular press and sparked a literary controversy regarding how, and whether,  an author's work should be reworked and published after his death. Unlike critics in the popular press, Hemingway scholars generally consider ''True at First Light'' to be complex and a worthy addition to his [[Canon (fiction)|canon]] of later fiction.

In a two-day period in January&amp;nbsp;1954, Hemingway and Mary were in two plane crashes in the African bush. He was reported dead by the international press, arriving in [[Entebbe]] to face questions from reporters.  The severity of his injuries was not completely known until he returned to Europe months later. Hemingway spent much of the next two years in [[Havana]], recuperating and writing the manuscript of what he called 'the Africa book',  which remained unfinished at the time of his suicide in July, 1961. In the 1970s, Mary donated it along with his other manuscripts to the [[John F. Kennedy Library]].  The manuscript was released to Hemingway's son [[Patrick Hemingway|Patrick]] in the mid-1990s. Patrick edited the work to half its original length to strengthen the underlying storyline and emphasize the fictional aspects. The result is a blend of [[memoir]] and fiction.

In the book, Hemingway explores conflict within a marriage, the conflict between the European and native cultures in Africa, and the fear a writer feels when his work becomes impossible. The book includes descriptions of his earlier friendships with other writers and digressive ruminations on the nature of writing.

==Background==
Hemingway went on [[safari]] to Africa in 1933 with his second wife [[Pauline Pfeiffer|Pauline]] and always intended to return. That visit inspired Hemingway's "[[The Snows of Kilimanjaro (short story)|Snows of Kilimanjaro]]" published in ''[[The Green Hills of Africa]]'', well-known parts of the Hemingway canon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mellow|1992|pp=337–340}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two decades later in 1953, having finished writing'' [[The Old Man and the Sea]]'', he planned a trip to Africa to visit his son [[Patrick Hemingway|Patrick]] who lived in [[Tanganyika]]. When ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'' magazine offered to send him to Africa, paying $15,000 for expenses, $10,000 for rights to a 3500 word piece about the trip, and [[Earl Theisen]] as official photographer to go with him, he quickly accepted.  Hemingway and [[Mary Hemingway|Mary]] left Cuba in June, traveling first to Europe to make arrangements and leaving from Venice to Tanganyika a few months later.&lt;ref name= "Mellow582ff"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mellow|1992|pp=582–588}}&lt;/ref&gt; They arrived in August, and  Hemingway was thrilled to be deputized as an honorary ranger, writing in a letter, "due to emergency ([[Mau Mau]] rebellion) been acting game ranger".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Baker|1981|p= 825}}&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Philip Percival]], Hemingway's safari guide in 1933, joined the couple for the four-month expedition; they traveled from the banks of the [[Salengai]], where Earl Theisen photographed Hemingway with a herd of elephants, to the [[Kimana Swamp]], the [[Rift Valley Province|Rift Valley]] and then on to visit Patrick in central Tanganyika.&lt;ref name="Baker pp331-333"&gt;{{Harvnb|Baker|1972|pp=331–333}}&lt;/ref&gt; After visiting Patrick at his farm, they settled for two months on the north slopes of [[Mt. Kilimanjaro]]. During this period Percival left their camp to return to his farm, leaving Hemingway as [[game warden]] with local scouts reporting to him. Hemingway was proud to be a game warden and believed a book would come of the experience.&lt;ref name="Reynoldsp270ff"/&gt;

[[File:Ernest Hemingway Kenya safari 1954.png|thumb|alt=photograph of Ernest Hemingway relaxing in a camp chair at the fishing camp in Africa| [[Ernest Hemingway|Hemingway]] at a fishing camp, February&amp;nbsp;1954. His hand and arms are burned from a recent brushfire, and his hair is burned from the plane crashes a few weeks earlier.]]
On January&amp;nbsp;21 Hemingway chartered a sightseeing flight of the [[Congo Basin]] as a late Christmas present to Mary; two days later, on their way to photograph [[Murchison Falls]] from the air, the plane hit an abandoned utility pole and crashed, with the passengers sustaining minor injuries. That night they camped in the bush waiting for a response to their distress call. The crash site was seen by a passing airliner that reported no survivors, and the news of Hemingway's death was telegraphed around the world.&lt;ref name="Reynoldsp270ff"&gt;{{Harvnb|Reynolds|2000|pp=270–276}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The next day they were found and picked up by a [[Bush flying|bush pilot]], but his [[de Havilland]] caught fire during take-off, crashed and exploded, which left Hemingway with a concussion, scalp wound, double-vision, intermittent hearing in his left ear, a crushed vertebra, ruptured liver, spleen and kidney, and burns. The explosion burned their passports,  "thirty rolls of exposed film, three pairs of Ernest's bifocals, all of their money, and their $15,000 letter of credit." The group traveled to [[Entebbe]] by road, where journalists from around the world had gathered to report his death.&lt;ref name="Reynoldsp270ff"/&gt; On January&amp;nbsp;26 Hemingway briefed and joked with the reporters, and spent the next few weeks in [[Nairobi]] recuperating and reading his obituaries.&lt;ref name= "Mellow582ff"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper = The New York Times|url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA071EF93C5E107B93C4AB178AD85F408585F9&amp;scp=7&amp;sq=ernest+hemingway+africa+plane&amp;st=p |title=Hemingway out of the Jungle; Arm Hurt; He says Luck Holds; Hemingway Quips over his ordeal|date=26 January 1954|accessdate = 2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his recuperation Hemingway immediately prepared the piece for ''Look''. The magazine paid him an additional $20,000 for an exclusive about the plane crashes. Biographer Michael Reynolds writes that the piece, "ran for twenty magazine pages spread out over two issues", with the first issue bearing a publication date of 26&amp;nbsp;January.&lt;ref name="Reynoldsp270ff"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sc.edu/library/spcoll/amlit/hemmagazines/hem.html |title=Hemingway and the Magazines |author=Weaver, John B.  |publisher=University of South Carolina |accessdate=2011-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of his injuries, Hemingway joined Patrick and his wife on a planned fishing trip in February,  but he was irascible and difficult to get along with.&lt;ref name= "Mellow582ff"/&gt; When a bushfire broke out, Hemingway fell into the fire while helping extinguish the flames, burning himself on his legs, front torso, lips, left hand and right forearm.&lt;ref name="Meyers pp505-507"&gt;{{Harvnb|Meyers|1985| pp=505–507}}&lt;/ref&gt; Months later in [[Venice]], Hemingway was diagnosed with two cracked [[Intervertebral disc|discs]], a kidney and liver rupture, a [[dislocated shoulder]] and a broken skull.&lt;ref name= "Mellow582ff"/&gt;

As soon as Hemingway returned to [[Finca Vigía]] in Cuba, he began work on a book about the safari, wanting to write while it was still vivid in his memory.  He quickly wrote 10,000 words, despite his pain (eventually the manuscript grew to about 800 pages).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Baker|1972|pp=335–336}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reynolds|2000|p=366}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1954, Hemingway wrote in a letter, "At present I work at about 1/2 the capacity I should but everything is better all the time."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Baker|1981|p= 837}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, three months later in late December he wrote in a letter: "This has been sort of a rough year&amp;nbsp;.... We call this 'black-ass' and one should never have it.  But I get tired of pain sometimes, even if that is an ignoble feeling."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Baker|1981|p= 843}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost a year later in October 1955, he declared: "Am passed 650 pages in the book. Am trying to write now like a good sorcer's (sic) apprentice&amp;nbsp;... always start to write as an apprentice. By the end of the book you are a master but if you commence as master in writing anyway, you end as a bloody bore."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Baker|1981|p= 847}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two months later, Hemingway was bedridden with kidney disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Baker|1981|p= 851}}&lt;/ref&gt; By January 1956, he acknowledged, in a letter written on the second anniversary of the accidents,  he was having trouble remembering the trip.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Baker|1981|p= 853}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1956, Hemingway agreed to work on the filming of ''[[The Old Man and the Sea (1958 film)|The Old Man and the Sea]]'' and abandoned work on the Africa book.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt;  He wrote to his editor, "I found it impossible to resume writing on the Africa book."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Baker|1981|p= 868}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hemingway put the manuscript in a safe-deposit box in Havana, although after the 1959  [[Cuban revolution]] he feared the manuscript lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reynolds|2000|p=354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==
The book is set in mid-20th century [[Kenya Colony]] during the [[Mau Mau Uprising|Mau-Mau]] rebellion. In his introduction to ''True at First Light'',  Patrick Hemingway describes the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] and [[Kamba people|Kamba]] tribes at the time of the Mau-Mau rebellion. He explains that if the Kamba had joined the rebellion, Ernest and Mary Hemingway "would have then stood a good chance of being hacked to death in their beds as they slept by the very servants they so trusted and thought they understood."&lt;ref name ="PH9"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hemingway, Patrick|1999|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book takes place in December while the narrator, Ernest, and  his wife, Mary, are in a safari camp in the Kenyan highlands on the flank of Mt. Kilimanjaro, where they find themselves temporarily at risk when a group of Mau-Mau rebels escape from jail.

[[File:Ernest and Mary Hemingway on safari, 1953-54.jpg|thumb|left|alt= photograph of a man and woman with a brush covered hut in the background|The main characters in the book were based on [[Ernest Hemingway|Ernest]] and [[Mary Welsh Hemingway|Mary Hemingway]], pictured here at their safari camp in 1953.]]
The blend of travel memoir and fiction opens with the white hunter Philip Percival leaving the safari group to visit his farm, handing control of the camp to Ernest, who is worried about being attacked and robbed,  because there are guns, alcohol, and food in the camp. Deputized as an assistant game warden, he makes daily rounds in the [[game reserve]], and maintains communication with the local tribes. He is accompanied by two African game scouts, Chungo and Arap Meina and, for a period, the district game warden G.C (Gin Crazed). Other camp members include Keiti, who runs the camp, the safari cook, Mbebia, and two stewards, Nguili and Msembi.

For six months Mary has been tracking a large black-maned lion, determined to finish the hunt by Christmas. In subsequent chapters, Ernest worries that Mary is unable to kill the lion for various reasons: she is too short to see the prey in the tall grass; she misses her shots with other game; and he thinks she is too soft-hearted to kill the animal. During this period, Ernest becomes entranced with Debba, a woman from a local village, whom the others jokingly refer to as his second wife. From her and the villagers  he wants to learn tribal practices and customs.

When Mary's lion is finally killed at the book's halfway mark, the local ''shamba''  (village) gathers for a ''ngoma'' (dance). Because she has dysentery, Mary leaves for Nairobi to see a doctor; while she is gone Ernest kills a leopard, after which the men have a protracted ''ngoma''. When Mary returns from Nairobi, she asks Ernest for an airborne sightseeing tour of the Congo Basin as a Christmas present.

Ernest describes his close relationships with the local men; indulges in memories of previous relationships with writers such as [[George Orwell]], and [[D.H. Lawrence]]; and satirizes the role of organized religion. Subjects as diverse as the smell of the pine woods in [[Michigan]], the nature of [[Parisian café]]s, and the quality of [[Georges Simenon|Simenon]]'s writing are treated with [[stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] digressions.

The back of the book includes a section titled "Cast of Characters", a [[Swahili language|Swahili]] [[glossary]], and the editor's acknowledgments.

== Publication history ==
[[File:Ernest Hemingway with sons Patrick and Gregory with kittens in Finca Vigia, Cuba.jpg|thumb|Ernest Hemingway in [[Finca Vigia|Cuba]] with his sons [[Patrick Hemingway|Patrick]] and [[Gregory Hemingway|Gregory]] in 1946. Patrick edited his father's African manuscript in the 1990s to become ''True at First Light''.]]
The ownership of Hemingway's manuscripts is complicated.  Two books have been published from the African book manuscript: ''True at First Light'', edited by Patrick Hemingway, and ''[[Under Kilimanjaro]]'', edited by scholars Robert Lewis and [[Robert E. Fleming|Robert Fleming]].  In 1965 Mary Hemingway established the Hemingway Foundation, and in the 1970s she donated her husband's papers to the [[John F. Kennedy Library]]. A group of Hemingway scholars met in 1980 to assess the donated papers when they formed the Hemingway Society, "committed to supporting and fostering Hemingway scholarship". After Mary Hemingway's 1986 death, Hemingway's sons [[John Hemingway|John]] and Patrick asked the Hemingway Society to take on the duties of the Hemingway Foundation; in 1997 the Hemingway Estate and the Hemingway Society/Foundation agreed  to a two-part publishing plan for the African book.  An abridged trade publication of ''True at First Light'' was to be published in 1999, to be edited by Patrick Hemingway;  the Hemingway Foundation would then  oversee the reworking of the entire text,  to be published as ''Under Kilimanjaro''.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2006|pp=78–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Of ''Under Kilimanjaro'', the editors claim "this book deserves as complete and faithful a publication as possible without editorial distortion, speculation, or textually unsupported attempts at improvement".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.kentstateuniversitypress.com/2010/under-kilimanjaro/ |title=An American Literary Treasure |publisher=Kent State University Press |accessdate=2011-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1970s, portions of the manuscript had been serialized in ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' and anthologized.&lt;ref name=Blumenthal&gt;Blumenthal, Ralph. [https://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/24/books/a-new-book-by-hemingway-blend-of-life-and-fiction-tells-of-african-bride.html?pagewanted=all A New Book By Hemingway; Blend of Life and Fiction Tells of African Bride] ''The New York Times''. 14 August 1998. Retrieved 2010-02-09&lt;/ref&gt; Mary Hemingway approved the segments published by ''Sports Illustrated'': segments described by Patrick Hemingway as a  "straight account of a shooting safari". In a 1999 talk presented at the annual Oak Park Hemingway Society dinner, Patrick Hemingway admitted  ownership of Ernest Hemingway's manuscripts had "a rather tortuous history". Access to the Africa manuscript—and to other Hemingway material—required a lawsuit and an eventual agreement with the Hemingway Society.&lt;ref name="Seefeldt"&gt;{{Harvnb|Seefeldt|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner's]] requested a book of fewer than 100,000 words. Patrick Hemingway worked for two years with the 200,000-word manuscript—initially converting to an electronic format, and then editing out superfluous material. He strengthened the storyline, and eliminated long descriptive passages with disparaging remarks about family members and living persons. He explains the manuscript was a draft lacking "ordinary housekeeping chores" such as character names. The cuts made, he said, maintained the integrity of the story and "the reader is not deprived of the essential quality of the book".&lt;ref name=Seefeldt/&gt;

''True at First Light'' was published on July&amp;nbsp;7,&amp;nbsp;1999 with a print run of 200,000. For the publicity campaign, Patrick Hemingway appeared on the ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today Show]]'' on the day of publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Maryles|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book became the main selection for the [[Book of the Month Club]] (BOMC), was serialized in the ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'', and rights were sold for translations to Danish, French, German, Icelandic, Italian, Norwegian, Polish, Spanish, and Swedish.&lt;ref name=PW&gt;{{Harvnb|Steinberg|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Audiobook|sound recording]] was released in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://catalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?Search_Arg=true+at+first+light&amp;Search_Code=GKEY%5E*&amp;PID=JG6ZCZZQgxvpBf4QZEtMYFzwvpE&amp;SEQ=20100226111623&amp;CNT=25&amp;HIST=1 |title=Library of Congress Online Catalog |publisher=Library of Congress |accessdate=2010-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|style="text"-align: left;"|—Ernest Hemingway's  [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] for ''True at First Light'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hemingway, Ernest|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|}
In ''The New York Times'' James Woods described ''True at First Light'' as a travel journal that became a "fanciful memoir" and then a novel of sorts.&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wood|first=James|newspaper = The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/07/11/reviews/990711.11woodlt.html |title=The Lion King|date=11 July 1999|work= |accessdate=2010-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patrick Hemingway believed adamantly the manuscript was more than a journal.&lt;ref name= "PH9"/&gt; He emphasized the storyline because, as he explains, "the essential quality of the book is an action with a love interest". He tightened the hunting scenes, and to honor his father's statement to the reader that "where I go, you go" he emphasized the mid-20th century Africa scenes and "the real relation between people&amp;nbsp;... on that continent".  Although he fictionalized the storyline, Patrick Hemingway said of the characters, "I knew every single one&amp;nbsp;... very well indeed".&lt;ref name=Seefeldt/&gt;  Hemingway scholar Robert Fleming (who reworked the manuscript  as ''Under Kilimanjaro'') considers Patrick Hemingway's editing essentially to be correct because he believes the work shows evidence of an author unable to "turn off the mechanism that produces fiction". The marital conflict is where Fleming believes  the book took "a metafictional turn".&lt;ref name=Fleming/&gt; The published book is marketed as fiction.&lt;ref name= "PH9"/&gt;

Fleming considers ''True at First Light'' similar to Hemingway's ''[[Green Hills of Africa]]'' and ''[[A Moveable Feast]]''—a book that presents a primary topic as a backdrop interspersed with internal dialogue. Unlike the other two books, ''True at First Light'' is without a preface  "indicating the intentions of the author or dictating how he intended to have the book read". Fleming thinks Hemingway regarded ''Green Hills of Africa''  as experimental and ''A Moveable Feast'' as fiction.&lt;ref name=Fleming/&gt; Rose Marie Burwell, author of  ''Hemingway: The Postwar Years and the Posthumous Novels'', believes Hemingway enjoyed writing the "strange combination of memoir and fiction".  She thinks in the fictional aspects of ''True at First Light'' he is free to imagine a second wife and to jettison his Protestant background.&lt;ref name = Burwell/&gt;

== Themes ==
Hemingway is "most definitely on vacation" in ''True at First Light'' writes Fleming;&lt;ref name=Fleming/&gt; and Burwell sees an author who is willingly and happily enjoying a vacation, behaving  childishly, blissfully unaware of the effect his behavior has on the members of camp. The impression is of a man seeking to delve into cultural conflicts in Africa, which takes a fictional turn in the Debba storyline. Mary is characterized as a nag whereas the character of the writer is presented as "placid, mature, and loving", immersing himself in native culture.&lt;ref name = Burwell/&gt;

Burwell and Fleming say the book's subtext is about aging, as symbolized by the writer's attraction to the younger fertile woman, and Hemingway used fertility imagery to symbolize "the aging writer's anxiety about his ability to write".&lt;ref name=Fleming/&gt;&lt;ref name = Burwell/&gt;  The images of the old elephant symbolize the aging and unproductive writer, and Burwell approves Patrick Hemingway's decision to retain those pieces of the manuscript.&lt;ref name=Burwell/&gt; Hemingway scholar Hilary Justice writes the work shows an emphasis on "the writer not writing",  which for Hemingway would have been a fate worse than aging. Thus, she says, ''True at First Light'' invokes a paradox with "an aging writer for whom writing is becoming increasingly difficult in the moment of writing about the not-writing author".&lt;ref name = "Justice"&gt;{{Harvnb|Justice|1999|pp=39–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing, for Hemingway, had always been difficult. He revised his work endlessly and stuck to the practice of writing "one true sentence" and stopping each writing session when he still had more to write. Tom Jenks, editor of an earlier posthumously published book ''[[The Garden of Eden]]'', says Hemingway shows the worst of his writing in ''True at First Light'': presenting himself as a "self-pitying, self-indulgent, self-aggrandizing" persona in a book that is no more than a mass of fragmentary material. Jenks thinks Hemingway is simply aimlessly writing and the plot lacks the tension notable in his earliest works such as'' [[The Sun Also Rises]]''. However, he thinks Hemingway had good material to work with and some skeletal thematic structures show promise.&lt;ref name = "Jenks"&gt;{{Harvnb|Jenks|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''True at First Light'' shows the nature of mid-20th century conflict in Africa. [[Scramble for Africa|Colonialism]] and [[British Empire|imperialism]] pressured African tribes and wildlife.&lt;ref name=Seefeldt/&gt; Hemingway shows an awareness of the political future and turmoil in Africa according to Patrick Hemingway, who, although he lived in [[Tanzania]] (formerly Tanganyika) for decades, was surprised at the degree of perception apparent in his father's mid-century writing about Africa.&lt;ref name=Seefeldt/&gt; Hemingway scholar Anders Hallengren notes the thematic similarities in Hemingway's posthumous fiction, particularly in the final books. The genesis of ''True at First Light'' was an African insurrection, also symbolically depicted in ''The Garden of Eden'': "The conviction and purposefulness of the Maji-Maji in ''The Garden of Eden'', corresponds to the Kenyan Mau-Mau context of the novel ''True at First Light''&amp;nbsp;".&lt;ref name="Hallengren"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1954/hemingway-article.html |title=A Case of Identity: Ernest Hemingway |author=Hallengren, Anders |work= |publisher=Nobelprize.org |accessdate=2010-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''The Hemingway Review'', Robert Gajdusek says the clash of cultures is "massively active" in the book, with Hemingway exploring tribal practices; Christianity and Islam are juxtaposed against native religions; and the Mary/Debba triangle is symbolic of the white "Memsahib and the native girl".&lt;ref name ="G99"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gajdusek|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to his first African book, ''Green Hills of Africa'',  Hemingway embeds in ''True at First Light'' digressions and ruminations about the nature of writing, with particular attention to [[James Joyce]] and [[D.H. Lawrence]].&lt;ref name=Fleming/&gt; Patrick Hemingway explains his father was interested in D.H. Lawrence's belief that each region of the world "should have its own religion"—apparent when the male character invents his own religion.&lt;ref name=Seefeldt/&gt; Mary's intent to decorate a tree for Christmas mystified the native camp members, and Hemingway seemed to realize that Africa was a place without an influential and established religion—a place where religion could be redefined.&lt;ref name ="G99"/&gt;

== Reception ==
[[File:Hemingway 1953-1954 safari.png|thumb|Hemingway with a [[Cape buffalo]] in Africa in 1953. The publication of ''True at First Light'' began to shift critics emphasis away from the image of the "white man with a gun" in his works.&lt;ref name = "delGizzo"/&gt;]]
Although it was listed on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/09/05/bsp/besthardfiction.html|newspaper = The New York Times|title=Best Sellers Plus |date=5 September 1999  |accessdate=2011-03-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the book received poor reviews from the popular press, although better reviews from Hemingway scholars. In a pre-publication review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', Ralph Blumenthal said that ''True at First Light'' was not as good as Hemingway's earlier [[Biography in literature|autobiographical fiction]], and he questioned whether Hemingway would have wanted his "reputation and last printed words entrusted solely to any editor, even a son". Blumenthal wondered about the autobiographical aspects of the work: the relationship between Hemingway and Debba; the background of the ''Look'' magazine photoshoot; the safari itself; and the subsequent plane accidents.&lt;ref name= "Blumenthal"/&gt; In the 1999 ''The New York Times'' review, James Wood claimed Hemingway knew ''True at First Light'' was not a novel though the editors billed it as one. He believes Hemingway's later work became a parody of the earlier work.&lt;ref name="Wood"/&gt;  ''True at First Light'' represents the worst of Hemingway's work according to a review in ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;ref name="GuardianCampbell"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/1999/jul/04/featuresreview.review10|title=Rogue Hemingway|author=Campbell, Jim|newspaper = The Guardian|date=4 July 1999  |accessdate=2010-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christopher Ondaatje]] writes in ''[[The Independent]]'' that the existence of a Hemingway industry tends to overshadow his posthumous work. He considers Hemingway's African stories to be among his best although the posthumous work about Africa has been disregarded or overlooked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Christopher |last=Ondaatje |title= Bewitched by Africa's strange beauty|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/christopher-ondaatje--bewitched-by-africas-strange-beauty-633122.html |newspaper= The Independent | date=30 October 2001 |accessdate=2010-03-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In her piece for ''[[Nation]]'',  [[Brenda Wineapple]] describes the book as "poignant but not particularly good". However, she points out that it "reminds us of Hemingway's writing at its most touching, acute and beautiful best".&lt;ref name=Wineapple&gt;{{Harvnb|Wineapple|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review in ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' is much the same saying the  "old Hemingway magic flashes sporadically, like lightning, but not often enough".&lt;ref name= PW/&gt;

Hemingway scholars think the work is more complicated and important than a cursory read suggests. With the publication of ''True at First Light'' critics saw a more humane and empathetic Hemingway, and began to shift their emphasis away from the image of the "white man with a gun."&lt;ref name = "delGizzo"&gt;{{Harvnb|del Gizzo|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Fleming considers ''True at First Light''  to be part of the Hemingway canon declaring,  "This is a more complicated book than it appears to be, and Hemingway deserves far more credit for it than the reviewers of the popular press have given it. Serious critics dealing with the late works would be advised not to ignore it".&lt;ref name="Fleming"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fleming|1999|pp=28–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gadjusek praises the prose style, which he says is a new direction in Hemingway's writing; he also believes, despite the editing, the book is cohesive and whole with well-ordered themes.&lt;ref name ="G99"/&gt;  Burwell considers the edits to the manuscript generally well-done, though she laments losses that she thinks contribute to some of the subtexts in the book.&lt;ref name = Burwell&gt;{{Harvnb|Burwell|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biographer Kenneth Lynn criticized Hemingway's sons for editing the manuscript but of Hemingway he says the "memoirist is being totally, indeed helplessly honest,"&lt;ref name="Lynn"/&gt; and Gray concedes the publication of the book "underscores Hemingway's courage as a writer".&lt;ref name= "Time"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gray, Paul |title=Where's Papa |journal=Time Magazine |volume=154 |issue=1|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,991412,00.html|accessdate=2010-04-13 | date= 5 July 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite what he considers poor workmanship in the book, Wood considers Hemingway even at his worst a compelling writer and he says the literary estate should be left alone to save the literary influence.&lt;ref name="Wood"/&gt;

== Publication controversy ==

Many reviewers and writers were critical of the manner in which Patrick Hemingway edited the work. Paul Gray  titled his review of the book  "Where's Papa?", answering with the opening sentence, "He's hard to find in his fifth posthumous work", pointing directly to Patrick Hemingway's editing of the manuscript.&lt;ref name= "Time"/&gt; Lynn thinks Hemingway would have been "outraged by his sons' refusal to honor his judgment that the manuscript was unworthy of publication" and was outraged that  "Patrick Hemingway declares that his two brothers, Jack and Gregory, share his belief that 'this job was worth doing'&amp;nbsp;".&lt;ref name="Lynn"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lynn|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Burwell also wonders  whether Hemingway wanted the Africa book published, pointing to  his statement, "I think maybe it would be better to wait until I'm dead to publish it", although she concedes that works by [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]], [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], and [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]] were unfinished and published posthumously.&lt;ref name=Burwell/&gt; During the final two decades of his life, Hemingway had published two novels but since his death, works continue to be published. Writing in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' in 1998, [[Joan Didion]] was extremely critical of the Hemingway family and estate for  commercializing and profiting from his reputation and writing rather than protecting his legacy.  "The publication of unfinished work is a denial of the idea that the role of the writer in his or her work is to make it", she wrote, adding that ''True at First Light'' should not have been "molded" and published.&lt;ref name= "NewYorker"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Didion, Joan |title= Last Words |journal=The New Yorker |url = http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1998/11/09/1998_11_09_074_TNY_LIBRY_000016772 |accessdate=2011-03-21 | date= 9 November 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''True at First Light'' was published in Hemingway's centennial year, to a marketing campaign that attracted criticism.   Hemingway's sons licensed the family name and released that year items such as [[Thomasville Furniture Industries|Thomasville]] furniture with labels showing the Hemingway lifestyle—"the Pamplona Sofa and the Kilimanjaro Bed"&lt;ref name= "Time"/&gt;—and the [[Hemingway Ltd.]] brand, which Lynn describes as "tastefully chosen fishing rods, safari clothes, and (surely the ultimate triumph of greed over taste) shotguns".{{refn|On July&amp;nbsp;2, 1961 Hemingway killed himself by shooting himself in the head with his shotgun.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Meyers|1985|p=580}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}}&lt;ref name="Lynn"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Time"/&gt;

The [[United States]] '''Truth in Video Game Rating Act (S.3935)''' is a [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] introduced by then Senator [[Sam Brownback]] (R-KS) on September 26, 2006. The act would require the [[ESRB]] to have access to the full content of and hands-on time with the games it was to rate, rather than simply relying on the video demonstrations submitted by developers and publishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Senate Proposes New ESRB Legislation | url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=11030 | work=[[Gamasutra]] | accessdate=September 27, 2006 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311010442/http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=11030 | archive-date=2007-03-11 | dead-url=no | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill makes no considerations for [[mod (computer gaming)|mods]], [[Mod (computer_gaming)#Total_conversion|total conversion]]s, [[user generated content]], [[procedurally generated content]], unused disc space, blocked/disabled out portions of code, player behavior in online games, and various other factors out of the control of the developers (such as how the player decides to play the game).

This bill was unacted upon during its original session and was reintroduced by Senator Brownback on February 14, 2007 under the same title "the Truth in Video Game Rating Act" with a new session number (S.568). The bill remained in the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation and expired at the end of the 110th Congress without further action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=S.568 - 110th Congress (2007-2008): Truth in Video Game Rating Act|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/senate-bill/568/committees|accessdate=1 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170801084307/https://www.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/senate-bill/568/committees|archive-date=2017-08-01|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tyrant Books''' is an independent book publisher based in Rome, Italy and New York, New York. It was created in 2009 by Giancarlo DiTrapano as an offshoot of the acclaimed NY Tyrant Magazine, also founded by DiTrapano, in 2006.  

==History==
Tyrant Books was created to publish books worthy of acclaim but less suited to large publishing houses, often because they are incendiary or [[avant garde]].  Giancarlo DiTrapano is quoted in the [[Los Angeles Review of Books]] as saying, “It would have taken forever for me to do anything I wanted to do [working for a traditional publishing house], but I had a little money, so I started a press.”  In 2006 he founded New York Tyrant Magazine, which published “writers the big houses refused to touch,” including [[Brian Evenson]], [[Noy Holland]], [[Michael Kimball]], [[Gary Lutz]], [[Rachel B. Glaser]], [[Scott McClanahan]], [[Sam Lipsyte]], [[Padgett Powell]], [[Breece D’J Pancake]] and [[Gordon Lish]] and more. The magazine had immediate success and generated a following for the Tyrant brand, which benefitted Tyrant Books when it formed. The magazine was put on hiatus until December 2016, when it was brought back as an online journal, with Jordan Castro as the editor.&lt;ref name="LA"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bible|first1=Michael|title=He Offered Me Cocaine: An Interview with Giancarlo DiTrapano of Tyrant Books|url=https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/he-offered-me-cocaine-an-interview-with-giancarlo-ditrapanao-of-tyrant-books/|agency=LA Review of Books|date=September 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="Titles"&gt;{{cite web|title=NY Tyrant Titles|url=https://nytyrant.com/collections/titles|website=NY Tyrant}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://magazine.nytyrant.com/&lt;/ref&gt;  In recent years, New York Tyrant Magazine has published a diverse roster of writers, including [[Clancy Martin]], [[John Haskell (author)|John Haskell]], [[Gordon Lish]], [[Ryūnosuke Akutagawa]], [[Blake Butler]], [[Lydia Davis]], [[Tao Lin]], [[Noah Cicero]], [[Ariana Reines]], and [[Sheila Heti]]. 

In 2009, 500 copies of the novella “Baby Leg” by [[Brian Evenson]] were published, marking the beginning of the transition to book publishing for Tyrant.  It was followed by Eugene Marten’s “Firework” (2010), which is scheduled for re-release in 2017, and [[Michael Kimball]]’s “Us” (2011).&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Slayton Joslin|first1=Jay|title=Interview: Giancarlo DiTrapano, Publisher at Tyrant Books, June 7, 2016|url=http://culturedvultures.com/interview-giancarlo-ditrapano-publisher-tyrant-books/|website=Cultured Vultures}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Tyrant Books partnered with [[Fat Possum Records]].  The publisher’s most successful book to date is “Preparation for the Next Life” by [[Atticus Lish]], winner of the [[PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction|2015 PEN/Faulkner Prize]] for fiction, which had sold 15,000 copies as of January 2015.  The publications are distributed through Consortium Book Sales and Distribution.&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maloney|first1=Jennifer|title=How ‘Preparation for the Next Life’ Became a Big Hit for Tyrant|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-preparation-for-the-next-life-became-a-big-hit-for-tyrant-1421351378|agency=WSJ|date=January 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Merger with Fat Possum Records==
In 2013 DiTrapano met Matthew Johnson, owner of Fat Possum Records, while interviewing him for [[Playboy]].  The profile of Johnson, who was recording the last of the Mississippi Hill Country musicians, did not happen, but Johnson and DiTrapano became friends.  Johnson developed an interest in saving the publishing house, which was struggling financially. Johnson became 50% owner and took over the business aspects of Tyrant Books while DiTrapano was freed to exclusively find and develop manuscripts.  DiTrapano quotes Johnson in the Wall Street Journal as saying, “You’re a great editor but a terrible businessman”, and he responded, “I know”.&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt;

==Preparation for the Next Life==

The first book to be published after the merger was the wildly successful “Preparation for the Next Life” by Atticus Lish (2014). Lish is the son of [[Gordon Lish]], well known author and editor. A book of drawings by Lish (“Life is with People”) was published by Tyrant Books in 2011, and after the merger with Fat Possum DiTrapano asked Lish if he had any fiction. He emailed DiTrapano the manuscript, which took five years to write&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/22/books/atticus-lishs-long-route-to-preparation-for-the-next-life.html&lt;/ref&gt;, and accepted a $2000 advance&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-preparation-for-the-next-life-became-a-big-hit-for-tyrant-1421351378&lt;/ref&gt;.  Initially only 3,500 paperback copies of “Preparation for the Next Life” were printed.  When the success of the book became apparent, 10,000 more copies were ordered, and in the meantime were printed on demand from [[Amazon.com|Amazon]].  As of January 2015, there were 33,500 copies in print&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wvfocus.com/2015/07/storybook-ending/&lt;/ref&gt;. The success of the book, which won the [[PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction|PEN/Faulkner Prize for Fiction]] in 2015, has contributed greatly to the reputation of Tyrant Books, allowing operations to continue and attracting serious submissions.&lt;ref name="interview" /&gt;

[[Image:Images d'Epinal.jpg|thumb|Old commercial signal pointing to the Imagerie d'Épinal location]]
'''Épinal prints''' were prints on popular subjects rendered in bright sharp colours, sold in [[France]] in the 19th century.  They owe their name to the fact that the first publisher of such images &amp;mdash; [[Jean-Charles Pellerin]] &amp;mdash; having been born in [[Épinal]], named the printing house he founded in 1796, ''[[Imagerie d'Épinal]].'' 

The expression ''image d'Épinal'' has become proverbial in French and refers to an emphatically traditionalist and naïve depiction of something, showing only its good aspects.

The prints were also a regular point of comparison for criticizing paintings by Courbet - notably his Burial at Ornans and Peasants of Flagey Returning from the Fair - and Manet.  Acknowledging the proximity of some of Manet's works, like his Fifer, Zola turned the comparison into praise.
