      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12064">In eukaryotic cells, an '''aggresome''' refers to an aggregation of [[misfolded proteins]] in the cell, formed when the protein-degradation system of the cell is overwhelmed. Aggresome formation is a highly regulated process which possibly serves to organize misfolded proteins into a single location.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |vauthors=Corboy MJ, Thomas PJ, Wigley WC |title=Aggresome formation |journal=Methods Mol. Biol. |volume=301 |issue= |pages=305–27 |year=2005 |pmid=15917642 |doi=10.1385/1-59259-895-1:305 |url=|isbn=978-1-59259-895-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biogenesis ==

Correct [[Protein folding|folding]] requires [[protein]]s to assume one particular structure from a [[constellation]] of possible but incorrect conformations. The failure of [[Peptide|polypeptides]] to adopt their proper structure is a major threat to cell function and [[Cell (biology)|viability]]. Consequently, elaborate systems have evolved to protect cells from the deleterious effects of [[misfolded proteins]].

Cells mainly deploy three mechanisms to counteract misfolded proteins: up-regulating [[Chaperone (protein)|chaperones]] to assist protein refolding, [[proteolytic]] degradation of the misfolded/damaged proteins involving ubiquitin–proteasome and autophagy–lysosome systems, and formation of detergent-insoluble aggresomes by transporting the misfolded proteins along [[microtubules]] to a region near the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]]. Intracellular deposition of misfolded protein aggregates into ubiquitin-rich [[cytoplasmic]] inclusions is linked to the [[pathogenesis]] of many diseases. Functional blockade of either degradative system leads to an enhanced aggresome formation. Why these aggregates form despite the existence of cellular machinery to recognize and degrade misfolded protein, and how they are delivered to cytoplasmic inclusions, are not known.

Aggresome formation is accompanied by redistribution of the intermediate filament protein vimentin to form a cage surrounding a pericentriolar core of aggregated, ubiquitinated protein. Disruption of microtubules blocks the formation of aggresomes. Similarly, inhibition of proteasome function also prevents the degradation of unassembled [[Presenilin 1|presenilin-1]] (PSE&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) molecules leading to their aggregation and deposition in aggresomes. Aggresome formation is a general response of cells which occurs when the capacity of the proteasome is exceeded by the production of aggregation-prone misfolded proteins.

Typically, an aggresome forms in response to a cellular stress which generates a large amount of misfolded or partially [[denatured protein]]: [[hyperthermia]], overexpression of an insoluble or [[mutant protein]], etc.  The formation of the aggresome is largely believed to be a protective response, sequestering potentially [[cytotoxic]] aggregates and also acting as a staging center for eventual autophagic clearance from the cell.

An aggresome forms around the [[microtubule organizing center]] in [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] cells, adjacent to or enveloping the cell's [[centrosome]]s. [[Polyubiquitination]] tags the protein for retrograde transport via HDAC6 binding and microtubule-based motor protein, [[dynein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Johnston | first1 = J.A. | last2 = Ward | first2 = C.L. | last3 = Kopito | first3 = R.R. | year = 1998 | title =Aggresomes: A Cellular Response to Misfolded Proteins | url = | journal = J.

[[Mediator (coactivator)|Mediator]]s such as p62 are believed to be involved in aggresome formation in sequestering omega-somes, which bind and increase the size of the aggresome. The aggresome is eventually targeted for [[autophagic]] clearance from the cell. Some pathological proteins, such as [[alpha-synuclein]], cannot be degraded and cause the aggresomes to form inclusion bodies (in [[Parkinsons Disease]], [[Lewy bodies]]) which contribute to neuronal dysfunction and death.&lt;ref&gt;Finger, pp. 43–50&lt;/ref&gt;

== Triggering aggresome formation ==
Abnormal polypeptides that escape proteasome-dependent degradation and aggregate in cytosol can be transported via microtubules to an aggresome, a recently discovered organelle where aggregated proteins are stored or degraded by autophagy. Synphilin 1, a protein implicated in Parkinson disease,was used as a model to study mechanisms of aggresome formation. When expressed in naïve HEK293 cells, synphilin 1 forms multiple small highly mobile aggregates. However, proteasome or Hsp90 inhibition rapidly triggered their translocation into the aggresome, and surprisingly, this response was independent on the expression level of synphilin 1. Therefore, aggresome formation, but not aggregation of synphilin 1, represents a special cellular response to a failure of the proteasome/chaperone machinery. Importantly, translocation to aggresomes required a special aggresome-targeting signal within the sequence of synphilin 1, an ankyrin-like repeat domain. On the other hand, formation of multiple small aggregates required an entirely different segment within synphilin 1, indicating that aggregation and aggresome formation determinants can be separated genetically. Furthermore, substitution of the ankyrin-like repeat in synphilin 1 with an aggresome-targeting signal from huntingtin was sufficient for aggresome formation upon inhibition of the proteasome. Analogously, attachment of the ankyrin-like repeat to a huntingtin fragment lacking its aggresome-targeting signal promoted its transport to aggresomes. These findings indicate the existence of transferable signals that target aggregation-prone polypeptides to aggresomes.

== Human disease ==
Accumulation of misfolded proteins in proteinaceous inclusions is common to many age-related [[neurodegenerative]] diseases, including [[Parkinson's disease]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[Huntington's disease]], and [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]]. In cultured cells, when the production of misfolded proteins exceeds the capacity of the chaperone refolding system and the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway, misfolded proteins are actively transported to a cytoplasmic juxtanuclear structure called an aggresome. Whether aggresomes are benevolent or noxious is unknown, but they are of particular interest because of the appearance of similar inclusions in protein deposition diseases. Evidence shows that aggresomes serve a cytoprotective function and are associated with accelerated turnover of mutant proteins. Experiments show that mutant androgen receptor (AR), the protein responsible for X-linked spinobulbar muscular atrophy, forms insoluble aggregates and is toxic to cultured cells. Mutant AR was also found to form aggresomes in a process distinct from aggregation. Molecular and pharmacological interventions were used to disrupt aggresome formation, revealing their cytoprotective function. Aggresome-forming proteins were found to have an accelerated rate of turnover, and this turnover was slowed by inhibition of aggresome formation. Finally, it is shown that aggresome-forming proteins become membrane-bound and associate with lysosomal structures. Together, these findings suggest that aggresomes are cytoprotective, serving as cytoplasmic recruitment centers to facilitate degradation of toxic proteins.

===Proteins implicated in aggresome formation===

Histone deacetylase 6 is the protein that, in the deacetylase adaptor protein function, forms Lewy bodies (the regular wild-type protein localized to inclusion bodies). No mutation associated with disease has been linked to this protein.

Parkin is the protein that, in the protein ligase function, forms Lewy bodies (the regular wild-type protein localized to inclusion bodies). Parkinson's disease has been linked to this protein when there is a protein.

Ataxin-3 is the protein that, in the deubiquitinating enzyme function, forms SCA type-1 and 2 DRPLA intranuclear inclusions (the regular wild-type protein localized to inclusion bodies). SCA type-3 has been linked to this protein when there is a protein.

Dynein motor complex is the protein that, in the retrograde microtubule motor function, forms an unknown protein (the regular wild-type protein localized to inclusion bodies). Motor neuron degeneration has been linked to this protein when there is a protein.

Ubiquilin-1 is the protein that, in the protein turnover, intracellular trafficking function, forms Lewy bodies and neurofibrillary tangles (the regular wild-type protein localized to inclusion bodies). Alzheimer’s disease (potential risk factor) has been linked to this protein when there is a protein.

===Cystic fibrosis===

Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an inefficiently folded integral membrane protein that is degraded by the cytoplasmic ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Overexpression or inhibition of proteasome activity in transfected human embryonic kidney or Chinese hamster ovary cells leads to the accumulation of stable, high molecular weight, detergent-insoluble, multi-ubiquitinated forms of CFTR. Undergraded CFTR molecules accumulate at a distinct pericentriolar aggresome.

== Role of the aggresome pathway in cancer ==
There is emerging evidence that inhibiting the aggresome pathway leads to accumulation of misfolded proteins and apoptosis in tumor cells through autophagy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rodriguez-Gonzalez |first1=A |title=Role of the aggresome pathway in cancer: targeting histone deacetylase 6-dependent protein degradation. |journal=Cancer Res |date=April 2008 |volume=15 |issue=68 |pages=2557–60 |pmid=18413721 |doi=10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-5989 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the obstruction came, Allen ran away, avoiding collisions as it went. It used following internal [[Knowledge representation|representation]], and every sonar return represented a repulsive force with, and inverse square drop off in strength. Direction of its move was obtained by sum of the repulsive forces (suitably thresholded). It possessed an additional reflex which halted it whenever it was moving forward, and something was directly in its path.&lt;ref name=Brooks1990/&gt;

''"The first level layer of control (second layer), when combined with zeroth, imbues the robot with the ability to wander around aimlessly without hitting obstacles."''&lt;ref name="brooks"/&gt; Owing to the second layer, Allen could randomly wander about every 10 seconds. It used simple [[heuristic]], which was coupled with the instinct to shun barriers by [[Euclidean vector|vector]] addition. ''"The summed vector suppressed the more primitive obstacle avoidance vector, but the obstacle avoidance behaviour still operated, having been subsumed by the new layer, in its account of the lower level's repulsive force. Additionally, the halt reflex of the lower level operated autonomously and unchanged."''&lt;ref name=Brooks1990/&gt;

The third layer made the robot try to explore. Allen could look for distant places (with its sonars), then tried to reach them. ''"This layer monitored progress through odometry, generating a desired heading which suppressed the direction desired by the wander layer. The desired heading was then fed into a vector addition with the instinctive obstacle avoidance layer. The physical robot did not therefore remain true to the desires of the upper layer. The upper layer had to watch what happened in the world, through odometry, in order to understand what was really happening in the lower control layers, and send down correction signals."''&lt;ref name=Brooks1990/&gt;

[[File:White Mountain CA.JPG|right|thumb|[[White Mountain Peak|White Mountain]], an alpine environment at {{convert|4300|m|ft|-3}} in [[California]], USA.]]

'''Alpine climate''' is the average [[weather]] ([[climate]]) for the regions above the [[tree line]]. This climate is also referred to as a '''mountain climate''' or '''highland climate'''.

==Definition==

There are multiple definitions of alpine climate.

One simple definition is the climate which causes trees to fail to grow due to cold. According to the [[Holdridge life zone]] system, alpine climate occurs when the mean [[biotemperature]] of a location is between {{convert|1.5|and|3|C|F}}, which prevents tree growth. Biotemperature is defined as the mean temperature, except all temperatures below {{convert|0|C|F}} are treated as {{convert|0|C|F}}, because plants are dormant below freezing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lugo|first1=A. E.|title=The Holdridge life zones of the conterminous United States in relation to ecosystem mapping|journal=Journal of Biogeography|date=1999|volume=26|pages=1025–1038|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Herman_Shugart/publication/227649905_The_Holdridge_life_zones_of_the_conterminous_United_States_in_relation_to_ecosystem_mapping/links/00b49515b1408efd9c000000.pdf|accessdate=27 May 2015|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2699.1999.00329.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Köppen climate classification]], the alpine climate is part of "Group E", along with the [[polar climate]], where no month has a mean [[temperature]] higher than {{convert|10|C|F}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=McKnight|first1=Tom L|last2=Hess|first2=Darrel | year=2000 | chapter=Climate Zones and Types: The Köppen System |  title=Physical Geography: A Landscape Appreciation | pages=235–7 | location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey | publisher=Prentice Hall | isbn=0-13-020263-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause==
The temperature profile of the atmosphere is a result of an interaction between [[radiation]] and [[convection]]. Sunlight in the [[visible spectrum]] hits the ground and heats it. The ground then heats the air at the surface. If [[radiation]] were the only way to transfer heat from the ground to space, the [[greenhouse effect]] of gases in the atmosphere would keep the ground at roughly {{convert|333|K|C F}}, and the temperature would decay exponentially with height.&lt;ref name=goodywilson&gt;{{cite book|first1=Richard M.|last1=Goody|first2=James C.G.|last2=Walker|title=Atmospheres|chapter=Atmospheric Temperatures|chapterurl=http://lasp.colorado.edu/~bagenal/3720/GoodyWalker/AtmosCh3sm.pdf|publisher=Prentice-Hall|year=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, when air is hot, it tends to expand, which lowers its density. Thus, hot air tends to rise and transfer heat upward. This is the process of [[convection]]. Convection comes to equilibrium when a parcel of air at a given altitude has the same density as its surroundings. Air is a poor conductor of heat, so a parcel of air will rise and fall without exchanging heat. This is known as an [[adiabatic process]], which has a characteristic pressure-temperature curve. As the pressure gets lower, the temperature decreases. The rate of decrease of temperature with elevation is known as the [[adiabatic lapse rate]], which is approximately 9.8&amp;nbsp;°C per kilometer (or 5.4&amp;nbsp;°F per 1000&amp;nbsp;feet) of altitude.&lt;ref name=goodywilson/&gt;

Note that the presence of water in the atmosphere complicates the process of convection. Water vapor contains latent [[heat of vaporization]]. As air rises and cools, it eventually becomes [[Dew point|saturated]] and cannot hold its quantity of water vapor. The water vapor condenses (forming [[cloud]]s), and releases heat, which changes the lapse rate from the [[dry adiabatic lapse rate]] to the [[moist adiabatic lapse rate]] (5.5&amp;nbsp;°C per kilometre or 3&amp;nbsp;°F per 1000&amp;nbsp;feet).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meteorologytraining.tpub.com/14312/css/14312_47.htm |title=Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate |publisher=tpub.com |accessdate=2016-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603041448/http://meteorologytraining.tpub.com/14312/css/14312_47.htm |archivedate=2016-06-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The actual lapse rate, called the [[environmental lapse rate]], is not constant (it can fluctuate throughout the day or seasonally and also regionally), but a normal lapse rate is 5.5&amp;nbsp;°C per 1,000&amp;nbsp;m (3.57&amp;nbsp;°F per 1,000&amp;nbsp;ft).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The temperature continues to drop until the [[tropopause]], at {{convert|11000|m|ft}}, where it does not decrease further. However, this is higher than the highest [[summit]].

==Distribution==
Although this climate classification only covers a small portion of the Earth's surface, alpine climates are widely distributed. For example, 
The [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], the [[Cascade Mountains]], the [[Rocky Mountains]], the [[Appalachian Mountains]], and the summit of [[Mauna Loa]] in the [[United States]], the [[Alps]], the [[Trans-Mexican volcanic belt]],  the [[Snowy Mountains]] in [[Australia]], the [[Pyrenees]], [[Cantabrian Mountains]] and [[Sierra Nevada (Spain)|Sierra Nevada]] in Spain, the [[Andes]], the [[Himalayas]], the [[Tibetan Plateau]], [[Gansu]], and [[Qinghai]] in China, the [[Eastern Highlands]] of Africa, high elevations in the [[Atlas Mountains]] and the central parts of [[Borneo]] and [[New Guinea]].

The lowest altitude of alpine climate varies dramatically by latitude. If alpine climate is defined by the tree line, then it occurs as low as {{convert|650|m|ft}} at 68°N in Sweden,&lt;ref name=korner&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Körner|first1=Ch|year=1998|title=A re-assessment of high elevation treeline positions and their explanation|journal=Oecologia|volume=115|pages=445–459|doi=10.1007/s004420050540|issue=4|url=http://culter.colorado.edu/~kittel/TreelineLat_Koerner98.pdf|bibcode=1998Oecol.115..445K}}&lt;/ref&gt; while on [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] in Africa, the alpine climate and the tree line are met at {{convert|3950|m}}.&lt;ref name=korner/&gt;

==Monthly variability==

The variability of the alpine climate throughout the year depends on the latitude of the location. For tropical locations, such as the summit of Mauna Loa, the temperature is roughly constant throughout the year:

'''Anna L. Peterson''' (born 1963) is an American scholar of [[religious studies]] who is currently a [[professor]] in the Department of Religion at the [[University of Florida]], where she has worked since 1993. Her research variously concerns [[religion in Latin America]] and [[ethics]]—including [[religious ethics]], [[Christian ethics]], [[environmental ethics]], [[animal ethics]] and [[social ethics]]. She is the author of five monographs: ''Martyrdom and the Politics of Religion'' ([[State University of New York Press]], 1997); ''Being Human'' ([[University of California Press]], 2001); ''Seeds of the Kingdom'' ([[Oxford University Press]], 2001); ''Everyday Ethics and Social Change'' ([[Columbia University Press]], 2009); and ''Being Animal'' (Columbia University Press, 2013).

==Career==
Peterson studied at [[Williams College]] (1981–1983) before going on to receive a [[religious studies]] [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] from the [[University of California at Berkeley]] (1983–1985). She then studied at the [[University of Chicago Divinity School]] from 1986 to 1991. She received an [[Master of Arts|MA]] in 1987, and a [[doctorate|PhD]] in Ethics and Society in 1991. Her doctoral [[thesis]] was supervised by Robin Lovin.&lt;ref name="CV"&gt;Peterson, Anna L. [http://sites.clas.ufl.edu/religion/files/2012/11/Peterson-CV1.pdf CV]. Accessed 24 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ufl"&gt;"[http://people.clas.ufl.edu/annap/ Anna L. Peterson]". [[University of Florida]]. Accessed 24 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; She became an [[assistant professor]] in religious studies at [[St. Norbert College]] in 1991, where she remained until 1993, when she took up the position of assistant professor at the [[University of Florida]] Department of Religion.&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt; In 1997, her ''Martyrdom and the Politics of Religion'' was published with [[State University of New York Press]]. The book blends [[theology]], [[social history]] and [[ethnographic]] [[anthropology]] to explore ideas of [[Catholic]] [[martyrdom]] in the [[Salvadoran Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Flora, Cornelia. (1998). "''Martyrdom and the Politics of Religion: Progressive Catholicism in El Salvador's Civil War''. By Anna L. Peterson". ''Journal of Church and State'' '''40''' (3): 696–7. {{Doi|10.1093/jcs/40.3.696}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She became an [[associate professor]] in 1998, and spent two years as a [[visiting fellow]] at the [[Wesleyan University]] Department of Religion.&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt; 2001 saw the publication of her ''Being Human'', a book about [[environmental ethics]] from the perspective of [[religious ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, Susan J. (2002). "[http://jpe.library.arizona.edu/volume_9/0602armstrong.html ''Being Human: Ethics, Environment, and Our Place in the World'']". ''[[Journal of Political Ecology]]'' '''9''' (2). {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, she became a [[full professor]].&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;

Peterson has published a number of books while a full professor at Florida. ''Seeds of the Kingdom'', a comparative study of United States [[Amish]] farming communities and of El Salvador's refugee communities, appeared in 2005. Both groups examined, Peterson argues, attempt to build [[utopian]] Christian communities.&lt;ref&gt;McKanan, Dan (2007). "Anna L Peterson, ''Seeds of the Kingdom''". ''[[The Journal of Religion]]'' '''87''' (2): 295–7. {{doi|10.1086/513230}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Everyday Ethics and Social Change'' was published in 2009. In this book, Peterson argues that humans should the extend ethical values dominant in interpersonal relationships, such as love, to differently structure currently instrumental societal and political relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Rita (2010). "''Everyday Ethics and Social Change''". ''[[Environmental Ethics (journal)|Environmental Ethics]]'' '''32''' (4): 421–4. {{doi|10.5840/enviroethics201032445}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 2011 saw the publication of ''Working Toward Sustainability: Ethical Decision-Making in a Technological World'', a textbook which Peterson co-authored with Charles J. Kibert, Martha C. Monroe, Richard R. Plate and Leslie Paul Thiele.&lt;ref&gt;Kibert, Charles J., Martha C. Monroe, Anna L. Peterson, Richard R. Plate and Leslie Paul Thiele (2012). ''Working Toward Sustainability''. Hoboken, New Jersey: John Wiley and Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013's ''Being Animal'', Peterson critiques the separation of environmental and [[animal ethics]]. Though frequently thought irreconcilable, Peterson argues that the separation can be blamed on a weak understanding of nature, humans, and animals, as well as the relationships between them.&lt;ref&gt;Woodhall, Andrew (2015). "Anna L. Peterson: ''Being Animal: Beasts &amp; Boundaries in Nature Ethics''". ''[[Ethical Theory and Moral Practice]]'' '''18''' (4): 877–9. {{Doi|10.1007/s10677-015-9560-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selected bibliography==
In addition to her books, Peterson has written over twenty articles published in [[peer review]]ed [[academic journals]] and scholarly [[edited collections]], as well as various [[review articles]], [[book reviews]] and [[encyclopedia]] articles.&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;

During mating, males will try to inseminate as many females as possible, however, the more times a female's [[abdomen]] is punctured, the less likely she is to survive.&lt;ref name="Siva-Jothy et al."&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2002.2260| title = A matter of taste: Direct detection of female mating status in the bedbug| journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences| volume = 270| issue = 1515| pages = 649–52| year = 2003| last1 = Siva-Jothy | first1 = M.

D. | pmid=12769466 | pmc=1691276}}&lt;/ref&gt; Females that possess traits to avoid multiple matings will be more likely to survive, resulting in a change in [[morphology (biology)|morphology]]. In males, [[genitalia]] is relatively simple and more likely to vary among generations compared to [[female genitalia]]. This results in a new trait that females have to avoid in order to survive.

Additionally, sexual antagonistic co-evolution can be the cause of rapid evolution, as is thought to be the case in [[seminal proteins]] known as Acps in species of ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]''.  While Acps facilitate the mutually beneficial outcome of increased progeny production, several Acps have detrimental effects on female fitness as they are toxic and shorten her lifespan.  This leads to antagonistic co-evolution, as the female must evolve in order to defend herself.  When female ''Drosophila melanogaster'' are experimentally prevented from co-evolving with males, males rapidly adapt to the static female [[phenotype]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/381232a0| pmid = 8622764| title = Sexually antagonistic male adaptation triggered by experimental arrest of female evolution| journal = Nature| volume = 381| issue = 6579| pages = 232–4| year = 1996| last1 = Rice | first1 = W. R. }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This male adaptation leads to a reduction in female survivorship, which is mediated by an increased rate of remating and increased toxicity of Acps in seminal fluid.  Because non-reproductive proteins don’t feel the same evolutionary pressure as Acps, they aren’t evolving nearly as quickly.  Consistent with the arms race theory, DNA analyses reveal a two-fold increase in Acp divergence relative to non-reproductive proteins &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF00173190| title = High divergence of reproductive tract proteins and their association with postzygotic reproductive isolation in Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila virilis group species| journal = Journal of Molecular Evolution| volume = 41| issue = 6| year = 1995| last1 = Civetta | first1 = A. | last2 = Singh | first2 = R. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.131568198| title = Evolutionary EST analysis identifies rapidly evolving male reproductive proteins in Drosophila| journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences| volume = 98| issue = 13| pages = 7375| year = 2001| last1 = Swanson | first1 = W.

==Female co-evolution==
For many females, [[reproduction]] can be very dangerous and disadvantageous as in the case of [[Bed bug (insect)|bed bug]]s mentioned previously. Therefore, females who possess traits where they can lessen the impacts of male behavior are the ones who will survive and go on to reproduce. There are many ways a female can "defend" herself to the onslaught of potential mates.

===Spermatheca/pseudospermatheca===

Females have a very complex and an extremely variable [[reproductive system]], commonly known as a [[spermatheca]]. Some species do not have a spermatheca in the traditional sense, but do possess [[pseudospermatheca]]. Both forms play an essential role in [[sperm storage]] and [[fertilization]]. In the family [[Tingidae]], pseudospermatheca are located at the base of the [[oviduct]] and are hypothesized to have functioned as spermatheca at one point in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/jmor.10811| title = Functional morphology of the female reproductive apparatus of ''Stephanitis'' pyrioides(Heteroptera, Tingidae): A novel role for the pseudospermathecae| journal = Journal of Morphology| pages = NA| year = 2009| last1 = Marchini | first1 = D. | last2 = Bene | first2 = G. D. | last3 = Dallai | first3 = R. }}&lt;/ref&gt; They now serve as storage units for [[sperm]], where a female can introduce the stored sperm to her [[Egg (biology)|egg]]s when she finds it optimal. It is this factor that has put females in the driver seat of evolution. These organs give females the ability to pick and choose which sperm they will use to fertilize their eggs. Males now have another factor they need to overcome. In the case of ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', females will mate multiple times and then expel the excess sperm that she does not need. However, neither the first or second mate know if it his sperm that was dispelled, because at any postcopulatory moment a female can store the sperm of more than one male.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1187096| pmid = 20299550| title = Resolving Mechanisms of Competitive Fertilization Success in Drosophila melanogaster| journal = Science| volume = 328| issue = 5976| pages = 354–7| year = 2010| last1 = Manier | first1 = M. K.| last2 = Belote | first2 = J. M.| last3 = Berben | first3 = K. S.| last4 = Novikov | first4 = D.| last5 = Stuart | first5 = W. T.| last6 = Pitnick | first6 = S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enzymes secreted by females===

[[Enzyme]]s secreted by female [[reproductive tract]]s may also play a role in sexual antagonistic coevolution with males. In [[Drosophila]] species, a large group of enzymes known as [[serine protease]]s have been associated with female sperm storage organs (most notably, the spermatheca) through [[DNA sequencing|genetic sequencing]] and analysis.  It is hypothesized that these [[protease]]s break down various proteins in male [[seminal fluid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00493.x| pmid = 18752616| title = An Evolutionary Expressed Sequence Tag Analysis of Drosophila Spermatheca Genes| journal = Evolution| volume = 62| issue = 11| pages = 2936–47| year = 2008| last1 = Prokupek | first1 = A. | last2 = Hoffmann | first2 = F. | last3 = Eyun | first3 = S. I. | last4 = Moriyama | first4 = E. | last5 = Zhou | first5 = M. | last6 = Harshman | first6 = L. }}&lt;/ref&gt; This would result in females choosing for males that can overcome these [[digestive enzyme]]s, whether through [[genetic variation]] or physiological ability to produce greater quality or quantity of sperm.

===Behavior===

Before a male even has to begin worrying if the female will use his sperm or not, he must mate with her, which can be a problem within itself. Potential mates often play a game of persistence and resistance. In the case of [[water strider]]s (genus [[Gerris]]) males will harass females and try to grasp them by chasing and lunging at them. Females can be extremely evasive and often fend off these aggressive attacks. Even when a female is finally grasped she continues to struggle. However, this type of avoidance is very costly to a female, so she ends up having to balance the cost of [[mating]] and the cost of resistance.&lt;ref name="Rowe et al."/&gt;

==Male co-evolution==
Like females, males have developed responses to counter [[evolution]]ary adaptations of the opposite sex.  Responses in insects can vary in both genitalia and sperm structures, along with variations in behavior.

===Spiny genitalia===
{{see also|Penile spines}}
Male genitalia evolve more rapidly and divergently in animals. [[Spiny genitalia]] can aid in male-male competition. In [[seed beetle]]s, spiny genitalia help with anchor during copulation and allow a rapid passage to the female’s reproductive tract, thus overcoming female barriers to sperm. Females suffer costs as a result of injuries, but males do not benefit directly from harm inflicted on their mates. Damage, such as [[scarring]], increases in the female tract with the number of matings. In seed beetles, a positive correlation exists between the degree of harmfulness of the male’s genitalia and the thickness or reinforcement of the wall of the [[bursa copulatrix]] in the female’s reproductive tract. As a result, females’ connective tissue in the copulatory tract increased in thickness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0701170104| title = Coevolution between harmful male genitalia and female resistance in seed beetles| journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences| volume = 104| issue = 26| pages = 10921| year = 2007| last1 = Ronn | first1 = J.| last2 = Katvala | first2 = M.| last3 = Arnqvist | first3 = G. | pmid=17573531 | pmc=1904142}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, females with a thicker copulatory tract correlated positively to the amount of scarring, suggesting that scarring is a poor measure of costs for females. Females have evolved in other ways such as investing in [[immunocapacity]] to help with trauma associated during copulation.

===Copulation===

Male bed bugs have a unique way to copulate called traumatic insemination. Males use their [[intromittent organ]] to stab and inseminate females through their [[abdominal wall]] even though females contain a genital tract. Male bed bugs can also adjust their [[ejaculate]] volume and time of copulation through the presence of ejaculate(s) in females to conserve sperm and determine paternity outcomes.&lt;ref name="Siva-Jothy et al."/&gt; Females have evolved a [[paragenital system]] to counter traumatic inseminations. The paragenital system contains a [[mesospermalege]] where sperm is deposited. The sperm migrates through the blood to the sperm storage site and oviducts, and then to the ovaries to fertilize eggs. Female bed bugs have also evolved physiological by the presence of [[Phagocyte|phagocytic cells]] in the mesospermalege that ingest sperm after mating.

===Development time===

Selection on [[development time]] is often sexually antagonistic. In seed beetles, populations differed in development time and growth rate between sexes. [[Population fitness]] is not significant to either body size or growth rate, but variation in development time was significantly related to population fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2009.2026| title = Sexual conflict and the gender load: Correlated evolution between population fitness and sexual dimorphism in seed beetles| journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences| volume = 277| issue = 1686| pages = 1345| year = 2009| last1 = Arnqvist | first1 = G.| last2 = Tuda | first2 = M. | pmid=20031994 | pmc=2871940}}&lt;/ref&gt; In females, genes associated with long development time lead to high [[fecundity]] and mate immediately upon [[eclosion]]. Males have shorter development time and emerge early ([[protandry]]) resulting in greater fertilization opportunities.

===Sperm tail length===

Competition between differing male [[phenotype]]s also exists at the [[microscale]] level. It has been found in ''Drosophila'' that there is a positive correlation between the length of male sperm tails and the size of the [[seminal receptacle]] found in females.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1076968| pmid = 12424377| title = Sperm-Female Coevolution in Drosophila| journal = Science| volume = 298| issue = 5596| pages = 1230–3| year = 2002| last1 = Miller | first1 = G. T.| last2 = Pitnick| first2 = S}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been found that females with larger seminal receptacles “choose” sperm with long tails over sperm with short tails. Although females seem to “favor” this trait, no reproductive advantage for long tails has been found except for better correspondence to females with large seminal receptacles.This discrimination is reminiscent of the [[Fisherian runaway]] model, as females may choose for long tails based solely on inherited desirability, and would want to pass on that trait, which would improve the sexual success of their male progeny. This also could be an example of the “good genes” model of [[sexual selection]], as correlations have been found between sperm tail length and the physiological condition of the male.

[[Cognitive science]] and [[Theoretical linguistics|linguistic theory]] have played an important role in providing empirical research into the [[writing process]] and serving the teaching of composition. As composition theories, there is some dispute concerning the appropriateness of tying these two schools of thought together into one theory of [[Composition studies|composition]]. However, their empirical basis for research and ties to the process theory of composition and cognitive science can be thought to warrant  some connection.

==Theoretical construct==
The cognitive theory of composition (hereafter referred to as “cognitive theory”) can trace its roots to psychology and cognitive science. [[Lev Vygotsky]]'s and [[Jean Piaget]]'s contributions to the theories of cognitive development and developmental psychology could be found in early work linking these sciences with composition theory (see [[Ann E. Berthoff]]).  [[Linda Flower]] and [[John Hayes (cognitive scientist)|John Hayes]] published “A Cognitive Process Theory of Writing” in 1981, providing the groundwork for further research into how thought processes influence the writing process.

[[Linguistics|Linguistic]] theories of composition found their roots in the debate surrounding [[grammar]]'s importance in composition pedagogy.&lt;ref&gt;Hartwell, Patrick. "Grammar, Grammars, and the Teaching of Grammar." [[College English]] 47.2 (1985): 105-127. Rpt. in Cross-talk in Comp Theory: A Reader. Victor Villanueva. Urbana, IL: National Council of Teachers of English, 1997. 153-166.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars, such as [[Janet Emig]], [[Patrick Hartwell]], [[Martha J. Kolln]], Robert Funk, [[Stephen Witte]], and [[Lester Faigley]] continued this line of thought around the same time that a cognitive theory of composition was being developed by Flower and Hayes. These scholars, like scholars researching cognitive-oriented composition theory, focused on research providing insight into the writing process, but were also committed to providing pedagogical advancements addressing deficiencies, trends, and insights gained from their linguistic research.

==Research==

===Cognitive Theory===
A cognitive theory is focused on gaining insight into the writing process through the writer’s thought processes. Composition theorists have attacked the problem of accessing writers’ thoughts in various ways. Flower and Hayes’  essay, “A Cognitive Process Theory of Writing” sought to outline the writer’s choice-making throughout the writing process, and how those choices constrained or influenced other choices down the line.&lt;ref&gt;Flower, Linda, and John R. Hayes. "A Cognitive Process Theory of Writing." College Composition and Communication 32.4 (1981): 365-387. Rpt. in Cross-talk in Comp Theory: A Reader. Victor Villanueva. Urbana, IL: National Council of Teachers of English, 1997. 153-166.&lt;/ref&gt; Other research has focused on capturing the cognitive processes of writers during the writing process through note-taking or speaking aloud,&lt;ref&gt;Penrose, Anne M., and Barbara M. Sitko. Hearing Ourselves Think: Cognitive Research in the College Writing Classroom. New York: Oxford University Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; while some early research by Birdwell, Nancrow, and Ross was done with computers to record writers’ keystrokes during the writing process.

===Applied Linguistics===
Linguistic composition theory has traditionally focused on sentence and paragraph-level composition, with the goal of providing instructors insights into the way students write at various proficiency levels. Stephen Witte and Lester Faigley&lt;ref&gt;Faigley, Lester, and Stephen P. Witte. "Coherence, Cohesion, and Writing Quality." College Composition and Communication 32.2 (1981): 2-11. Rpt. in Cross-talk in Comp Theory: A Reader. Victor Villanueva. Urbana, IL: National Council of Teachers of English, 1997. 153-166.&lt;/ref&gt; utilized detailed [[syntactic]] analysis to redefine the importance of [[cohesion (linguistics)|cohesion]] and [[coherence (linguistics)|coherence]] in judging writing quality. Paul Rodgers&lt;ref&gt;Rodgers, Paul Jr. C. "A Discourse-centered Rhetoric of the Paragraph." College Composition and Communication 17.1 (1966): 2-11. Rpt. in Cross-talk in Comp Theory: A Reader. Victor Villanueva. Urbana, IL: National Council of Teachers of English, 1997. 153-166.&lt;/ref&gt; and Richard Braddock&lt;ref&gt;Braddock, Richard. "The Frequency and Placement of Topic Sentences in Expository Prose." Research in the Teaching of English 8.3 (1974): 2-11. Rpt. in Cross-talk in Comp Theory: A Reader. Victor Villanueva. Urbana, IL: National Council of Teachers of English, 1997. 153-166.&lt;/ref&gt; focused on paragraph structure, in separate studies, in order to dispel common misjudgments about the importance of traditional paragraph structure.

Applied linguistics, specifically [[English as a foreign or second language|EFL/ESL]] studies, has played a large role in development linguistic theories of composition. Liz Hamp-Lyons’ research in ESL/EFL [[writing assessment]] is valuable in informing ESL composition pedagogy. [[Paul Kei Matsuda]],&lt;ref&gt;Matsuda, Paul Kei. "Composition Studies and ESL Writing: A Disciplinary Division of Labor." College Composition and Communication 50.4 (1999): 699-721.&lt;/ref&gt;  has illustrated the deficiency in ESL composition research, and recent compilations by Matsuda and others&lt;ref&gt;Matsuda, Paul Kei, Michelle Cox, and Jay Jordan. Second-language Writing in the Composition Classroom: A Critical Sourcebook. New York: Bedford / St. Martin's, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; have attempted to bridge the gap between ESL instruction and composition theory by presenting pedagogical, theoretical, and assessment frameworks in the ESL composition classroom.

==Pedagogy==
Cognitive and linguistic theories of composition are heavily tied to [[process theory]]. Cognitive and linguistic theories have been instrumental in providing respected empirical research to the field of [[Composition studies|composition theory]], but tend to stay away from making pedagogical suggestions. Instead, research in these fields is typically intended to inform process theory by providing data analysis regarding the writing process, and by bringing scientific research to the field.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42141">'''Communication privacy management''' ('''CPM'''), originally known as '''communication boundary management''', is a systematic research theory designed to develop an evidence-based understanding of the way people make decisions about revealing and concealing private information. CPM theory suggests that individuals maintain and coordinate privacy boundaries (the limits of what they are willing to share) with various communication partners depending on the perceived benefits and costs of information disclosure. It was first developed by [[Sandra Petronio]] in 1991.

Petronio uses a boundary [[metaphor]] to explain the privacy management process. '''[[#Private boundaries|Privacy boundaries]]''' draw divisions between private information and public information. This theory argues that when people disclose private information, they depend on a [[#Rule-based management system|rule-based management system]] to control the level of accessibility. An individual's privacy boundary governs his or her
[[self-disclosure]]s. Once a disclosure is made, the negotiation of privacy rules between the two parties is required. A
distressing sense of "[[#Boundary turbulence|boundary turbulence]]" can arise when
clashing expectations for privacy management are identified. Having the mental image of protective boundaries is central to understanding the five core principles of Petronio's CPM:

(1) People believe they own and have a right to control their private information. (2) People control their private information through the use of personal privacy rules. (3) When others are told or given access to a person's private information, they become co-owners of that information. (4) Co-owners of private information need to negotiate mutually agreeable privacy rules about telling others. (5) When co-owners of private information don't effectively negotiate and follow mutually held privacy rules, boundary turbulence is the likely result.

== Background ==
Petronio's communication privacy management (CPM) theory is built on Altman's dialectical
conception of privacy as a process of opening and closing a boundary to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Communication Privacy Management in Electronic Commerce|last = |first = |date = 2001|journal = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Altman and Taylor's [[social penetration theory]] focused on [[self-disclosure]] as the primary way to develop close relationships. However, openness is only part of the story. We also have a desire for privacy. When Petronio first developed this theory in 1991, it was called ''communication boundary management''. In 2002, she renamed it to ''communication privacy management'', underscoring private disclosure as the main thrust of the theory.

==Assumptions==
* Humans are choice-makers
* Humans are rule-makers and rule-followers
* Humans' choices and rules are based on a consideration of others as well as the self
* Relational life is characterized by change

==Theory elements==

=== Private information ===
[[File:CPM Basic Suppositions.png|thumb|230x230px]]
The content of concealing and revealing is private information. Petronio favored the term "private information" over the term "self-disclosure" because there are many [[caveat lector|caveats]] inherent to private information disclosure that are not present with self-disclosure.&lt;ref name="Petronio 20022"&gt;Petronio, S. (2002). Boundaries of Privacy: Dialectics of Disclosure. Albany, NY: SUNY Press.
&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, the motivations behind sharing are many, including but not limited to: sharing a burden, righting a wrong, and influencing others.&lt;ref name="Petronio 19912"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Petronio | first1 = S | year = 1991 | title = Communication boundary management: A theoretical model of managing disclosure of private information between married couples | url = | journal = Communication Theory | volume = 1 | issue = 4| pages = 311–335 | doi=10.1111/j.1468-2885.1991.tb00023.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since private information can be about yourself or others, the decision as to what is private and whom to share it with plays a part when taking the idea of boundaries into consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Matthews|first1=Alicia|last2=Derlega|first2=Valerien|last3=Morrow|first3=Jennifer|title=What is Highly Personal Information and How Is It Related to Self-Disclosure Decision-Making?|journal=Communication Research Reports|date=Aug 20, 2006|volume=23|issue=2|pages=85–92|doi=10.1080/08824090600668915}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision to share is ultimately left up to the process of the privacy rule management system which combines rules for coordination of information, characteristics of disclosure, and attributes of the nature of boundaries.

=== Private boundaries ===
To understand CPM theory it is important to follow the metaphor of the [[Personal boundaries|boundary]]. Private boundaries are the division between private information and public information.&lt;ref name="Petronio, et al. 19982"&gt;Petronio, S., Ellmers, N., Giles, H., Gallois, C. (1998). (Mis)communicating across boundaries: Interpersonal and intergroup considerations. Communication Research, 25, 571–595.
&lt;/ref&gt; When private information is shared, there will be a '''collective boundary'''. When private information remains with an individual and is not disclosed, the boundary is called a '''personal boundary'''. An individual's private information is protected by their boundaries. The permeability of these boundaries are ever-changing. Boundaries can be relatively permeable (easy to cross) or relatively impregnable (rigid and difficult to cross).
[[File:Personal and Collective Boundaries.jpg.png|thumb|Personal and collective boundaries]]

=== Control and ownership ===
Communication privacy management theory understands information (as well as boundaries) as something that is owned, and each owner must decide whether or not they are willing to have a confidant, i.e. a co-owner, to that information. In some cases, it is preferable for the owner to have another person share the private information, though this may not be the case for the confidant. [[Concurrent estate|Co-ownership]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;of information is characterized by two things: heavy responsibility and a knowledge of the rules for a particular disclosure. However, ownership can be felt to different degrees, and the understanding of disclosure rules can be different from owner to owner. Also, the act of sharing is coupled along with the realization that boundaries have expanded and that they may never return to their original state. It is the responsibility of co-owners to decide and make clear if, when, and how information can or should be shared with others.&lt;ref name="Petronio, Durham 20082"&gt;Petronio, S., &amp; Durham, W.T. (2008). Communication privacy management theory. In L.A. Baxter &amp; D.O. Braithwaite (Eds.), Engaging theories in interpersonal communication: Multiple perspectives (pp. 309-322). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rule-based management system===
[[File:Three processes.jpg.png|thumb|right]]

As the framework for understanding the decisions people make about private information, this system allows for management on the individual and collective levels through three processes: privacy rule characteristics, boundary coordination, and boundary turbulence.

=== Management dialectics ===
[[File:Boundaries in a Life Span.png|thumb|224x224px]]
Petronio's understanding and argument of privacy management rests on the idea that a dialectic exists wherever the decision is made to disclose or conceal private information. Thus, costs and benefits must be weighed and consideration must be given to how such information will be owned, used, and spread.&lt;ref name="Petronio, Rierson 2009"&gt;Petronio, S., &amp; Reierson, J. (2009). Regulating the Privacy of Confidentiality: Grasping the Complexities through Communication Privacy Management Theory. Uncertainty, Information Management, and Disclosure Decisions: Theories and Applications. 365–383.&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of [[dialectic]] that Petronio borrows from can be found in Leslie Baxter and Barbara Montgomery's theory of [[relational dialectics]], wherein various approaches to the contradictory impulses of relational life are discussed. The theory focuses on the idea that there are not only two contradictory stances within a relationship, but that at any given moment decisions are weighed using multiple viewpoints.&lt;ref name="Baxter, Montgomery 1996"&gt;Baxter, L.A., &amp; Montgomery, B. (1996). Relating Dialogues and dialectics: New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rule-based management system ==
Petronio views boundary management as a rule based process, not an individual decision. This rule-based management system allows for management on the individual and collective levels. This system depends on three privacy rule management to regulate the process of revealing and concealing private information: privacy rule characteristics, boundary coordination, and boundary turbulence.

===Privacy rule characteristics===
The characteristics of privacy rules are divided into two sections, attributes and development. Privacy rule attributes refer to how people obtain rules of privacy and understand the properties of those rules.&lt;ref name="Petronio 1991"&gt;Petronio, S. (1991). Communication boundary management: A theoretical model of managing disclosure of private information between married couples. [[Communication Theory (journal)|Communication Theory]], 1, 311–335.&lt;/ref&gt; This is normally done through social interactions where the boundaries for rules are put to the test. Rules are set in different social situations which dictate the type of disclosure that should be made, for example, the difference between disclosure at a family member's birthday party versus an office event at work. Petronio asserts that each situation will come with its own set of rules for managing privacy that are learned over time. The development of privacy rule characteristics has to do with the criteria implemented to decide if and how information will be shared.&lt;ref name="Petronio 20072"&gt;Petronio, S. (2007). Translational Research Endeavors and the Practices of Communication Privacy Management. Journal of Applied Communication Research, 35, 218-222.
&lt;/ref&gt; Communication privacy management theory general lists those criteria as the following:

Decision Criteria

Example
|-
|''Cultural ''
|core 
|Disclosure depends on the norms for privacy and openness in a given culture.
|The United States favors more openness in relational communication than does Japan
|-
|''Gender''
|core 
|Privacy boundaries are sculpted differently by men and women based on socialization, which leads to difference in how rules are understood and operated in
|American women are socialized to be more disclosive than men
|-
|''Context ''
|catalyst
|Shaped by issues of physical and social environments that factor in whether or not information will be shared
|If we're in a traumatic situation (e.g., we've survived an earthquake together), we'll develop new rules
|-
|''Motivation ''
|catalyst
|Owners of information can form certain bonds that lead to disclosure, or conversely the express interest in forming bonds may cause private information to be shared. Motivations for sharing can include reciprocity or self-clarification.
|If you have disclosed a great deal to me, out of reciprocity, I might be motivated to disclose to you
|-
|''Risk/benefit ratio ''
|catalyst
|Owners of private information evaluate risks relative to the benefits of disclosure or maintaining information private. 
|Our rules are influenced by our assessment of the ratio of risks to benefits of disclosing
|}
With these five criteria, personal and group privacy rules are developed, but disclosure of private information necessitates the inclusion of others within the boundary of knowledge, which demands an understanding between parties for how to coordinate ownership of knowledge.

===Boundary coordination===
An individual's private information is protected by the individual's boundaries. The permeability of these boundaries are ever-changing, and allow certain parts of the public access to certain pieces of information belonging to the individual. Once private information is shared, co-owners must coordinate the boundaries of privacy and disclosure based on boundary permeability, boundary linkage, and boundary ownership.&lt;ref name="Petronio 1991" /&gt; Petronio describes this mutual boundary coordination by co-owners as drawing the same borders on a map around a shared piece of information.&lt;ref name="Petronio 20072"/&gt; By no means is this an easy process considering that each owner will approach the information from distinct viewpoints and referencing their personal criteria for privacy rule development.  
*'''''Boundary permeability''''' refers to the nature of the invisible divisions that keep private information from being known outside of an individual or particular group. When private information is kept with one owner, the boundaries are said to be thick because there is less possibility for information to make its way out into the public sphere. Once information is shared to one or more persons, the boundaries for that private information expand, become more permeable, and are considered ''thin''.&lt;ref name="Petronio, Durham 20082"/&gt;
*'''''Boundary linkage''''' has to do with how owners are connected when they build associations through a boundary. For example, doctors and patients are linked to each other in such a way that private information is passed within their boundaries constantly. These linkages can be strong or weak depending on how information was shared or whether a co-owner wanted to know or was prepared to learn a new piece of information. Case in point, the link between an organization and a spy meant to infiltrate the organization is weak because the two are not coordinated on how information will be maintained private or disclosed.&lt;ref name="Caughlin, Afifi 2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Caughlin | first1 = J.P. | last2 = Afifi | first2 = T.D. | year = 2004 | title = When is topic avoidance unsatisfying? Examining moderators of the association between avoidance and dissatisfaction | url = | journal = Human Communication Research | volume = 30 | issue = 4| pages = 479–513 | doi=10.1093/hcr/30.4.479}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Boundary ownership''''' refers to the responsibilities and rights each person has over the control of the spread of information that they [[Ownership|own]]. When working to mutually create the boundary of privacy it is key for all parties to have a clear understanding of whether information should be shared, who it should be shared with, and when it should be shared.&lt;ref name="Petronio 1991" /&gt; A simple example of this is the planning of a surprise birthday party; all those involved in planning must agree on how the information about the party will be spread so as not to ruin the surprise. As new guests are invited, they become an owner of the information and are bound to the rules of privacy maintenance, or else the surprise could be ruined.

===Boundary turbulence===
Often, boundaries are not coordinated as well as they should be to maintain the level of privacy or exposure desired by owners – this leads to problems known as boundary turbulence. The coordination of shared boundaries is key to avoiding over-sharing. When the boundaries are unclear, owners may come into conflict with one another. [[Clear-air turbulence|Turbulence]] among co-owners is caused when rules are not mutually understood by co-owners and when the management of private information comes into conflict with the expectations each owner had,&lt;ref name="Petronio 20022"/&gt; which can happen for a number of reasons.

Boundary turbulence can be caused by mistakes, such as an uninvited party overhearing private information (causing weak boundary linkage) or a disclosure an owner might make under the influence of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] or other [[drug]]s. Disclosure to a new party was not the intent, but, when it happens, other co-owners can feel that their expectations of maintaining boundaries have been violated.

In addition, boundary turbulence occurs when a co-owner intentionally breaks the coordinated boundary of privacy to disclose private information.&lt;ref name="Afifi 2003"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Afifi | first1 = T. D. | year = 2003 | title = Feeling caught" in stepfamilies: managing boundary turbulence through appropriate communication privacy rules | url = | journal = Journal of Social and Personal Relationships | volume = 20 | issue = 6| pages = 729–755 | doi=10.1177/0265407503206002}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of such intentional disclosure would be a daughter revealing to a doctor that her father is indeed an active smoker when the father has told the doctor that he no longer smokes after his heart surgery. The daughter in this case must weigh the risks of breaking the family privacy boundary against the benefits of the doctor being better informed of her father's condition.

Lastly, boundary turbulence can also occur when there have not been pre-existing rules for a situation. For example, with the emergence of [[social media]] and, in particular, [[Facebook]], boundary rules had not been established. As parents began to join Facebook and [[Friending|"friend"]] their children, the children felt turbulence. There was a perception of privacy invasion between the parent-child relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kanter |first1=M. |last2=Robbins |first2=S. |title=The Impact of Parents "Friending" Their Young Adult Child on Facebook on Perceptions of Parental Privacy Invasions and Parent-Child Relationship Quality |journal=Journal of Communication |date=2012 |page=900 of 917 |doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2012.01669.x |volume=62|issue=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cases of boundary turbulence, co-owners of information can feel that their expectations have been violated and lose trust in other co-owners. In these cases, the goal of each party is to reduce turbulence by reestablishing and coordinating boundaries.&lt;ref name="Petronio, et al. 19982" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Afifi 2003" /&gt; It should be noted, however, that turbulence doesn't always have a negative outcome, there has been studies which show that turbulence within relationships can lead to stronger and improved relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McLaren|first1=R.M.|title=Emotions, Communicative responses, and relational consequences of boundary turbulence|journal=Journal of Social and Personal Relationships|date=August 2013|volume=30|issue=5|pages=606–626|doi=10.1177/0265407512463997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory applications ==
Communication privacy management can be applied across different contexts, primarily include: (1) family communication, with a particular focus on parental privacy invasions, (2) online social media, (3) health, and (4) relational issues,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Brief Status Report on Communication Privacy Management Theory|last = |first = |date = 2013|journal = Journal of Family Communication|accessdate = |doi = 10.1080/15267431.2013.743426|pmid = |volume=13 |pages=6–14|last1 = Petronio|first1 = Sandra}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (5) work environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miller | first1 = Seumas | last2 = Weckert | first2 = John | year = 2000 | title = Privacy, the Workplace and the Internet | url = | journal = Journal of Business Ethics | volume = 28 | issue = 3| pages = 255–65 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family communication===

Specific applications of CPM highlight family privacy management. Research focused on secrets and topic avoidance, such as questions of concealment to [[Stepfamily|stepfamily members]] feeling caught, and parents-adolescent conversations about sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = 'Feeling caught' in stepfamilies: Managing boundary turbulence through appropriate communication privacy rules|last = Afifi|first = T.D.|date = 2003|journal = Journal of Social and Personal Relationships|accessdate = |doi = 10.1177/0265407503206002|pmid =|volume=20|issue = 6|pages=729–755}}&lt;/ref&gt; Family privacy research over the decades are also inspired specifically by the chapter of parental privacy invasion. For example, work by Hawk and his colleagues explore perceived parental invasions from the view of adolescents in reaction to such issues as control attempts, solicitation of information, and conflict outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Brief Status Report on Communication Privacy Management Theory|last = Petronio|first = Sandra|date = 2013|journal = Journal of Family Communication|accessdate = |doi = 10.1080/15267431.2013.743426|pmid =|volume=13|pages=6–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another way that family communication uses CPM is with child bearing or the lack thereof; whom childless-couples choose to disclose to that they voluntarily do not want children is another way CPM has been explored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Durham|first1=Wesley|title=The Rules-Based Process of Revealing/Concealing the Family Planning Decisions of Voluntarily Child-Free Couples: A Communication Privacy Management Perspective|journal=Communication Studies|date=May 21, 2008|volume=59|issue=2|pages=132–147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pregnancy loss due to [[miscarriage]] could be a unique CPM case in the family setting as couples often manage this information jointly as they decide whether to share the miscarriage with people outside the dyad. The research found that couples frame miscarriage as a shared but distinct experience and that both members exert rights of ownership over the information. Couples' privacy rules centered on issues of social support and others' need to know about the loss. Even though couples described their privacy rules as implicitly understood, they also recalled having explicit conversations to develop rules. We discuss how the management of co-owned information can improve communication and maintain relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=6&amp;sid=738c24b7-e7cd-414e-a7c6-b864903d0734%40sessionmgr4009&amp;hid=4114&amp;bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPWlwLHVpZCZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=100015365&amp;db=ufh|title=Co-ownership of Private Information in the Miscarriage Context|last=Bute, J.

===Online social media===

Recent researchers apply CPM to investigate privacy management for online [[blog]]ging, Facebook usage and [[online dating]]. Further, there have been investigations into parental behavior that is enacted through online social media; specifically when parents 'friend' their children and the management of privacy that ensues from that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kanter|first1=Maggie|last2=Robbins|first2=Stephanie|title=The Impact of Parents "Friending" Their Young Adult Child on Facebook on Perceptions of Parental Privacy Invasions and Parent–Child Relationship Quality|journal=Journal of Communication|date=October 2012|volume=62|issue=5|pages=900–917|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2012.01669.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Privacy practices in social network sites often appear paradoxical, as content-sharing behavior stands in conflict with the need to reduce disclosure-related harms. Some study explore privacy in social network sites as a contextual information practice, managed by a process of boundary regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Friends Only: Examining a Privacy-Enhancing Behavior in Facebook|last = Fred Stutzman, Jacob Kramer-Duffield|first = |date = April 2010|journal = |accessdate = |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar research has been done on the perceptions of teachers' disclosures on Facebook and their impact on credibility. The relevance and valence of disclosures were compared between disclosures made in the classroom and those made on Facebook and were found to be significantly different. Students' perceptions of teacher credibility were shown to decrease as relevance of disclosures increased and as negativity increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&amp;sid=738c24b7-e7cd-414e-a7c6-b864903d0734%40sessionmgr4009&amp;hid=4114&amp;bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPWlwLHVpZCZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#db=ufh&amp;AN=101487383|title=Perceptions of Teachers’ Disclosures on Facebook and their Impact on Credibility|last=Coffelt, T. A., Strayhorn|first=J., &amp; Tillson, L. D|date=2014|website=|publisher=Kentucky Journal of Communication|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another popular SNS Twitter was examined as well. In the research, Twitter was regarded as an onion with multiple privacy layers. The research found out that there were significant differences at the descriptive and inferential levels among the multiple dimensions of private information, including daily lives, social identity, competence, socio-economic status, and health. Private information regarding daily lives and entertainment was disclosed easily and located at the outermost layer of the disclosure onion. In contrast, health-related private information was concealed and located within the innermost layer of the disclosure onion. What's more, there were significant differences among current Twitter users, nonusers, and dropouts with regard to personality traits and privacy concerns about Twitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&amp;sid=95546c19-b61c-4971-9aaf-7eea06c2bcb6%40sessionmgr4008&amp;hid=4114&amp;bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPWlwLHVpZCZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=90180338&amp;db=ufh|title=The roles of virtual identity discrepancy and personality traits in communication privacy management on Twitter|last=Jin, Seung|first=A Annie|date=2013|website=|publisher=New Media &amp; Society|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young people especially highschool and college students are an important part of SNS users. A recent study examined college students' privacy concerns and impacts on their Twitter usage behaviors. Regression analyses concluded that Control and Boundary Rules of Private Information on Twitter significantly predict daily minutes spent on Twitter accounts. However, the same CPM variables did not predict college students' other Twitter usage behaviors (e.g., weekly inquiries and total months of using Twitter). This shows the intricate connection between students' privacy concern and their usage behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?sid=9b8072d1-acbd-46d4-9d13-ec29624248db%40sessionmgr105&amp;vid=0&amp;hid=115&amp;bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPWlwLHVpZCZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#db=ufh&amp;AN=118972200|title=Exploring the Relationship between Privacy Concerns and Social Media Use among College Students: A Communication Privacy Management Perspective|last=YANG, K. C.|first=PULIDO, A.|date=2016|website=|publisher=Intercultural Communication Studies|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health communication ===

Informed by principles of CPM, health communication research using CPM to explore health privacy issues has become a growth area. Earlier study investigated physician disclosure of medical mistakes. Recently there have been a number of studies focused on ways that privacy issues influence patient care, confidentiality and control over ownership, choices about disclosure, for instance, with stigmatized health-related illness such as [[HIV/AIDS]], about [[e-health]] information, and the [[digitization]] of healthcare.

One recent study about how [[overweight]] and [[obese]] individuals handle their personal history after they become a normal weight. The result shows that the vast majority of participants perceived more benefits from disclosing their larger identity than risks, regardless of weight-loss method.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Romo|first=Lynsey K|title=How Formerly Overweight and Obese Individuals Negotiate Disclosure of Their Weight Loss|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&amp;sid=b31b1607-b9a5-4eef-a969-8e138716da4d%40sessionmgr4008&amp;hid=4207&amp;bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPWlwLHVpZCZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=116509531&amp;db=aph|journal=Health Communication|volume=31|issue=9|pages=1145–1154|doi=10.1080/10410236.2015.1045790}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using CPM, ''Celebrity Health Narratives &amp; the Public Health'' offers the "first extensive look at celebrity health sagas, this book examines the ways in which their stories become our stories, influencing public perception and framing dialog about wellness, disease and death. These private-yet-public narratives drive fund-raising, reduce stigma and influence policy. Celebrities such as [[Mary Tyler Moore]], [[Robin Roberts (newscaster)|Robin Roberts]], [[Michael J. Fox]], and [[Christopher Reeve]]—as well as 200 others included in the study—have left a lasting legacy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mcfarlandbooks.com/book-2.php?id=978-0-7864-7971-9|title=McFarland - a leading independent publisher of academic and nonfiction books|website=www.mcfarlandbooks.com|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship issues===

Many studies emphasize the use of CPM in relationships because of the concepts of disclosure and boundaries. Not only romantic relationships, but also friendships are a factor when thinking of CPM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McBride|first1=Chad|last2=Bergen|first2=Karla|title=Communication Research: Becoming a Reluctant Confidant: Communication Privacy Management in Close Friendships|journal=Texas Speech Communication Journal|date=2008|volume=33|issue=1|pages=50–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Briefly, work on conflict and topic avoidance, considering the relational impact of privacy turbulence, students and faculty relationships, and workplace relationships have all produced useful information that opens new doors regarding CPM-based research.

The mobile phone and its impact on romantic relationships is a good example. After investigating mobile phone usage rules that are negotiated by adolescents and young adults in romantic relationships, findings are that the negotiation of rules is a crucial part of young adult relationships while enhancing trust and fostering harmony were important factors in the rule development process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1080/02500167.2016.1140666|pages= 56–74|title= Mobile communication privacy management in romantic relationships: A dialectical approach|journal= Communicatio|volume= 42|year= 2016|last1= Ngcongo|first1= Mthobeli}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CPM also appears in the friendship. The study intended to addresses the issue of whether personal traits and predispositions can predict the tendencies to either reveal or conceal secrets shared in confidence by a best friend suggested that a combination of several traits could successfully distinguish those who revealed secrets from those who did not. Significant discriminators included tendency to gossip and depth of disclosure. Implications of the study and suggestions for future research are discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?sid=cd2e4976-6af1-4f4e-984f-f0a0953a3789%40sessionmgr103&amp;vid=0&amp;hid=115&amp;bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPWlwLHVpZCZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=97239961&amp;db=ufh|title=A Profile of Those Likely to Reveal Friends' Confidential Secrets|last=Bello, R. S|first=Brandau-Brown|date=2014|website=|publisher=Communication Studies|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although privacy violations can be uncomfortable and disruptive, they have the potential for positive outcomes in relationships if addressed. Using CPM theory as a framework, a study surveyed a community sample of 273 adults to examine their retrospective accounts of privacy violations in personal relationships. Results showed that less than half of the sample offered explicit rules for information management, and the majority of participants blamed the confidant for the privacy turbulence. Findings indicated that people often do not share similar information with the violator in the future, but if they do, less than half offer explicit privacy rules during the privacy recalibration process. Confrontation efficacy was positively associated with initiating a conversation about the privacy turbulence and that people who engaged in privacy recalibration were more likely to report forgiveness and relational improvement and less likely to report relational damage than those individuals who did not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=2&amp;sid=7f9fc8cf-95ac-4800-b9e5-28c8506b72a3%40sessionmgr107&amp;hid=115&amp;bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPWlwLHVpZCZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=103187596&amp;db=ufh|title=Privacy Recalibration in Personal Relationships: Rule Usage Before and After an Incident of Privacy Turbulence|last=Steuber, Keli Ryan|first=Rachel M.

===Work environments===

CPM has become very applicable in the workplace as personal mobile devices have increasingly been allowed to be brought to work. The concept of [[Bring your own device|Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)]] has stirred conversation on the concept of privacy, security and boundaries between employee and employer. Companies have had to take measures to further secure their network or even decide whether they want to have employee access personal accounts (i.e. email) or devices while on the job. By the same token, some employees argue that companies should not be able to track what is being done on their personal devices or even on company computers even if they are in the work place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Seumas|last2=Weckert|first2=John|title=Privacy, the Workplace and the Internet|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|date=December 2000|volume=28|issue=3|pages=255–265|doi=10.1023/a:1006232417265}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=K.W.|last2=Voas|first2=J.|last3=Hurlburt|first3=G.F.|title=BYOD: Security and Privacy Considerations|journal=IT Professional|date=Sep–Oct 2012|volume=14|issue=5|pages=53–55|doi=10.1109/mitp.2012.93}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Even before stepping foot into the workplace, much can be said about CPM and interviewing. How much we decide to reveal within an interview and the boundaries we have in that situation is directly related to CPM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hackney|first1=Michael|last2=Kleiner|first2=Brian|title=Conducting an Effective Selection Interview|journal=Work Study|date=1994|volume=43|issue=7|doi=10.1108/eum0000000004009|pages=8–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even interviewing within a job (as a cop, for example) requires a certain sensitivity to people's boundaries and how much private information they are willing to reveal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Powell|first1=Martine|last2=Wright|first2=Rebecca|last3=Clark|first3=Susan|title=Improving the Competency of Police Officers in Conducting Investigative Interviews with Children|journal=Police Practice &amp; Research|date=2010|volume=11|issue=3|pages=211–226|doi=10.1080/15614260902830070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intercultural communication ===
Several studies tested CPM within intercultural contexts.  For instance, a study that examined intercultural privacy management between foreign English teachers and Japanese co-workers uncovered cultural premises. This "study highlights four cultural premises that garner intercultural privacy management between foreign English language teachers (ELTs) and Japanese coworkers (JCWs) in Japan. The analysis revealed that ELTs: (a) expected not to be a "free space" for privacy inquisition by JCWs, and (b) expected voluntary reciprocity in (egalitarian) workplace relationships. JCWs viewed: (a) privacy inquisitions as acts of kindness/caring and (b) soliciting help from a supervisor as providing opportunities for better care. This study calls for attention to intercultural privacy management and enhances CPM's cultural criteria."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simmons|first=Nathaniel|date=2016-08-24|title=Cultural discourses of privacy: Interrogating globalized workplace relationships in Japan|journal=Journal of International and Intercultural Communication|volume=0|pages=1–18|doi=10.1080/17513057.2016.1142601|issn=1751-3057}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Within the same context, foreign English teachers "employed the following management strategies: (a) withdrawal, (b) cognitive restructuring, (c) independent control, (d) lying, (e) omission, (f) avoidance, and (g) gaijin smashing. Japanese co-workers defined privacy as information that should be hidden and managed such information by: (a) drawing clear boundaries by not talking or changing contexts, and (b) being pre-emptive by demarcating privacy boundaries early on within a relationship."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nathaniel|first=Simmons,|date=2012-01-01|title=Tales of Gaijin: Health Privacy Perspectives of Foreign English Teachers in Japan|url=http://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/kaleidoscope/vol11/iss1/3/|journal=Kaleidoscope: A Graduate Journal of Qualitative Communication Research|volume=11|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nathaniel|first=Simmons,|date=2014-01-01|title=Negotiating Boundaries in a Globalized World: Communication Privacy Management between Foreign English Teachers and Japanese Co-workers in Japan|url=https://etd.ohiolink.edu/pg_10?0::NO:10:P10_ACCESSION_NUM:ohiou1400259896}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related theories ==
There are a few communication theories that are worth noting after understanding CPM in more depth.

[[Expectancy violations theory]] discusses the importance of personal space, [[Territoriality (nonverbal communication)|territoriality]] and the expectations individuals have of another's non verbal communication. Though dealing with physical proximity, we can see the relation between expectancy violations theory and CPM as it pertains to privacy and how close we allow another to come to us. Both physical and intimate proximity requires boundaries to be crossed or permeated.

[[Social penetration theory]] explains how two individuals grow in intimacy and move from one level to the next in their relationships. The popular idea behind social penetration is that individual are like onions; they have layers and as you go deeper, the more intimate you become. For this intimacy to occur, we can safely say that private information needs to be shared and exchanged. As one does this, boundaries are permeated and become co-owned.

Finally, [[coordinated management of meaning]] explains how people establish rules for both creating and interpreting meaning. Similar to CPM, coordinated management of meaning has stages were coordination is achieved, not achieved, or partially achieved. Similarly you can have boundary ownership, boundary turbulence or boundary linkage. Moreover, in order to achieve meaning there needs to be an exchange of information between individuals to decipher. This exchange of private information falls directly into CPM.

==Academic integration==
Communication privacy management theory utilizes a socio-cultural communication tradition within an interpersonal context, and employs both a positivistic and interpretive approach to knowing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Values ===

Altman speaks to the values of this theory as it advances our thinking by incorporating different "levels" or combinations of participants in communication processes (Altman 2002). Whereas earlier research and theorizing on privacy-disclosure focused on dyads or individuals, a most complicated set of dynamics has been carefully enunciated by Petronio. Petronio also describes communication within families and between family members and outsiders, within and outside work and social groups, and between many combinations of individuals, dyads, and others within and across social boundaries. In addition, her analysis of privacy-disclosure "turbulence", or breaches of desired communication patterns, is articulate and systematic.&lt;ref name="Afifi 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Petronio, Martin 1986"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Petronio | first1 = S. | last2 = Martin | first2 = J.N. | year = 1986 | title = Ramifications of revealing private information: A gender gap | url = | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychology | volume = 42 | issue = 3| pages = 499–506 | doi=10.1002/1097-4679(198605)42:3&lt;499::aid-jclp2270420317&gt;3.0.co;2-i}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Petronio, Martin, Litlefield 1984"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Petronio | first1 = S.

=== Criticism ===
Some researchers have questioned whether CPM theory truly is dialectical in nature.  It has argued that CPM takes a dualistic approach, treating privacy and disclosure as independent of one another and able to coexist in tandem rather than in the dynamic interplay characteristic of dialectics. This accusation of dualistic thinking might result from the theory's use of the terms ''balance'' and ''equilibrium'' in the early versions of CPM theory. Petronio argues that CPM is not focused on balance in the psychological sense. "Instead, [CPM] argues for coordination with others that does not advocate an optimum balance between disclosure and privacy. As an alternative, the theory claims there are shifting forces with a range of privacy and disclosure that people handle by making judgments about the ''degrees'' [emphasis in original] of privacy and publicness they wish to experience in any given interaction" (pp.&amp;nbsp;12–13). Thus, Petronio argues that it is legitimate to call CPM theory dialectical in nature.

A '''country''' is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in [[political geography]]. A country may be an independent [[sovereign state]] or part of a larger state,&lt;ref&gt;Jones, J. (1964). ''What Makes a Country? Human Events'', '''24'''(31), 14.&lt;/ref&gt; as a non-[[sovereignty|sovereign]] or formerly sovereign [[political division]], or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated [[nation|people]] with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the [[League of Nations]] in 1937 and reaffirmed by the [[United Nations]] in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise{{clarify|date=April 2017}} of legal jurisdiction.{{CN|date=March 2018}}

''Countries'' can refer both to sovereign states and to other political entities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|FCA|912|1997|litigants=Tjhe Kwet Koe v Minister for Immigration &amp;amp; Ethnic Affairs |date=8 September 1997 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; while other times it can refer only to [[State (polity)|states]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geography.about.com/cs/politicalgeog/a/statenation.htm| title=Geography: Country, State, and Nation |accessdate=2008-11-12 |last=Rosenberg |first=Matt}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the ''[[CIA World Factbook]]'' uses the word in its "Country name" field to refer to "a wide variety of dependencies, areas of special sovereignty, [[uninhabited islands]], and other entities in addition to the traditional countries or independent states".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/docs/notesanddefs.html#T |title=The World Factbook |publisher=CIA|accessdate=2012-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup id=Note_1&gt;[[#Notes|[Note 1]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

==Etymology and usage==
&lt;!-- ''Basically a country has a particular boundary on the surface of the earth through which one country can be separated from the other.'' Removed this addition: "Do not seek narrowly to define the word country without first considering the range of dictionary definitions such as OED and Chambers (British); Macquarie (Australian); Webster (American)." --&gt;

The word ''country'' comes from [[Old French]] ''contrée'', which derives from [[Vulgar Latin]] (''terra'') ''contrata'' ("(land) lying opposite"; "(land) spread before"), derived from ''contra'' ("against, opposite"). It most likely entered the English language after the [[Norman invasion of England|Franco-Norman invasion]] during the 11th century.

In English the word has increasingly become associated with political divisions, so that one sense, associated with the [[indefinite article]] – "a country" – through misuse and subsequent conflation is now a [[synonym]] for state, or a former [[sovereign state]], in the sense of sovereign territory or "district, native land".&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], Country&lt;/ref&gt; Areas much smaller than a political state may be called by names such as the [[West Country]] in England, the [[Black Country]] (a heavily industrialized part of England), "[[Constable Country]]" (a part of [[East Anglia]] painted by [[John Constable]]), the "big country" (used in various contexts of the [[American West]]), "coal country" (used of parts of the US and elsewhere) and many other terms.&lt;ref name="oed"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| editor = John Simpson, Edmund Weiner | encyclopedia = Oxford English Dictionary| edition = 1971 compact | publisher = Oxford University Press| location = Oxford, England| isbn = 978-0198611868}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The equivalent terms in French and other [[Romance language]]s (''[[Pays (France)|pays]]'' and variants) have not carried the process of being identified with political sovereign states as far as the English "country", instead derived from, [[pagus]], which designated the territory controlled by a medieval [[count]], a title originally granted by the Roman Church. In many European countries the words are used for sub-divisions of the national territory, as in the [[States of Germany|German Bundesländer]], as well as a less formal term for a sovereign state. France has very many "pays" that are officially recognised at some level, and are either [[natural region]]s, like the [[Pays de Bray]], or reflect old political or economic entities, like the [[Pays de la Loire]].

A version of "country" can be found in the modern [[French language]] as ''contrée'', based on the word ''cuntrée'' in [[Old French]],&lt;ref name="oed" /&gt; that is used similarly to the word "pays" to define non-state regions, but can also be used to describe a political state in some particular cases. The modern Italian ''contrada'' is a word with its meaning varying locally, but usually meaning a [[Ward (country subdivision)|ward]] or similar small division of a town, or a village or hamlet in the countryside.

==Sovereignty status==
{{See also|List of sovereign states}}

The term "country" can refer to a [[sovereign state]]. There is no universal agreement on the number of "countries" in the world since a number of states have [[List of states with limited recognition|disputed sovereignty status]]. There are [[List of sovereign states|206 sovereign states]], of which 193 states are members of the [[United Nations]], two states have observer status at the U.N. (the [[Holy See]] and [[State of Palestine|Palestine]]), and 11 other states are neither a member or observer at the U.N. All are defined as states by [[declarative theory of statehood]] and [[constitutive theory of statehood]]. The latest proclaimed state is [[South Sudan]] in 2011.

Although not sovereign states, [[England]], [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]] are [[Countries of the United Kingdom|countries]] (depending on context), which collectively form the [[United Kingdom]]—a sovereign state that is commonly, but erroneously referred to as a country. The United Kingdom is a Union of four separate countries brought about by a series of International treaties and legislated for by several Acts of Union, the first of which being the [[Acts of Union 1707]] in both the English and Scottish parliaments. While a political Union was created, Scotland and England retained a distinct church, legal system and education system, as a result, the issue of Sovereignty is different in the two countries, in Scotland Sovereignty lies with the people, whereas in England Sovereignty lies with Parliament and the Monarch. [[Lord President of the Court of Session|Lord President]] ([[Thomas Cooper, 1st Baron Cooper of Culross|Lord Cooper]] stated that "the principle of the unlimited sovereignty of Parliament is a distinctively English principle which has no counterpart in Scottish Constitutional Law", and that legislation contrary to the Act of Union would not necessarily be regarded as constitutionally valid. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Loveland|first1=Ian|title=Constitutional Law, Administrative Law, and Human Rights: A Critical Introduction|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=2015|isbn=978-0198709039|pages=43–47|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=y7S6BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA43#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Doherty|first1=Michael|title=Public Law|date=2016|publisher=Rutledge|isbn=978-1317206651|pages=198–201|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=065TDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA198#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barnett|first1=Hilaire|title=Constitutional &amp; Administrative Law|date=2014|publisher=Rutledge|isbn=978-1317446224|pages=119–123|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tzScBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA119#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lib of Congress"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/uk.php|title=Legal Research Guide: United Kingdom|publisher=[[Law Library of Congress]]|date=2009-07-23|accessdate=2013-03-29|quote=The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is the collective name of four countries, England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.

The [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]], a sovereign state, comprises four separate countries: Netherlands, Aruba, Curaçao, and Sint Maarten.

The degree of autonomy of non-sovereign countries varies widely. Some are possessions of sovereign states, as several states have overseas territories (such as [[French Polynesia]] or the [[British Virgin Islands]]), with citizenry at times identical and at times distinct from their own. Such territories, with the exception of distinct [[dependent territories]], are usually listed together with sovereign states on lists of countries, but may nonetheless be treated as a separate "[[country of origin]]" in international trade, as [[Hong Kong]] is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thuytiencrampton.com/2010/07/07/made-in-the-british-crown-colony/|title=Made In The British Crown Colony|work=Thuy-Tien Crampton|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407075644/http://thuytiencrampton.com/2010/07/07/made-in-the-british-crown-colony/|archivedate=2014-04-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.delcampe.net/page/item/id,41342017,var,MATCHBOX-LABEL-MADE-IN-HONG-KONG,language,E.html#.Uzrl3vmSwZg|title = Matchbox label, made in Hong Kong|work = delcampe.net|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://archive.today/20140401162502/http://www.delcampe.net/page/item/id,41342017,var,MATCHBOX-LABEL-MADE-IN-HONG-KONG,language,E.html%23.UzroWH3LfK5#.Uzrl3vmSwZg|archive-date = 1 April 2014|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contractortalk.com/f40/carrhart-made-hong-kong-27324/|title=Carrhart Made In Hong Kong?|work=ContractorTalk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cultural studies''' is a field of theoretically, politically, and empirically engaged cultural analysis that concentrates upon the political dynamics of contemporary culture, its historical foundations, defining traits, conflicts, and contingencies.&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2010. Beware of contingency. Environment and planning D: Society and Space, 28(3), pp.388-396. http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1068/d2310?journalCode=epda &lt;/ref&gt; Cultural studies researchers generally investigate how cultural practices relate to wider systems of [[power (social and political)|power]] associated with or operating through social phenomena, such as [[ideology]], [[class structure]]s, [[nationality|national formations]], [[ethnicity]], [[sexual orientation]], [[gender]], and generation.  Cultural studies views cultures not as fixed, bounded, stable, and discrete entities, but rather as constantly interacting and changing sets of practices and processes.&lt;ref&gt;"Cultural studies" is not synonymous with either "[[area studies]]" or "[[ethnic studies]]," although there are many cultural studies practitioners working in both area studies and ethnic studies programs and professional associations (e.g. [[American studies]], [[Asian studies]], [[African-American studies]], [[Latino studies|Latina/o Studies]], [[European studies]], [[Latin American studies]], etc.).&lt;/ref&gt; The field of cultural studies encompasses a range of theoretical and methodological perspectives and practices. Although distinct from the discipline of [[cultural anthropology]] and the interdisciplinary field of [[ethnic studies]], cultural studies draws upon and has contributed to each of these fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/cultural-studies|title=cultural studies {{!}} interdisciplinary field|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-06-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural studies was initially developed by British academics in the late 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, and has been subsequently taken up and transformed by scholars from many different disciplines around the world.  Cultural studies is avowedly and even radically interdisciplinary and can sometimes be seen as antidisciplinary. A key concern for cultural studies practitioners is the examination of the forces within and through which socially organized people conduct and participate in the construction of their everyday lives.&lt;ref&gt;Pain, R. and Smith, S. eds., 2008. Fear: Critical geopolitics and everyday life. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Cultural Studies as a field of research is not concerned with the linguistically uncategorized experiences of individuals, or, in a more radical approach, holds that individual experiences do not exist, being always the result of a particular social-political context.

Cultural studies combines a variety of politically engaged critical approaches drawn including [[semiotics]], [[Marxism]], [[feminist theory]], [[ethnography]], [[critical race theory]], [[post-structuralism]], [[postcolonialism]], [[social theory]], [[political theory]], [[history]], [[philosophy]], [[literary theory]], [[Media influence|media theory]], [[film studies|film/video studies]], [[communication studies]], [[political economy]], [[translation studies]], [[museum studies]] and [[art history|art history/criticism]] to study cultural phenomena in various societies and historical periods. Cultural studies seeks to understand how meaning is generated, disseminated, contested, bound up with systems of power and control, and produced from the social, political and economic spheres within a particular social formation or conjuncture. Important theories of [[cultural hegemony]] and [[Structure or agency|agency]] have both influenced and been developed by the cultural studies movement, as have many recent major communication theories and agendas, such as those that attempt to explain and analyze the cultural forces related to processes of [[globalization]].

During the rise of [[neo-liberalism]] in Britain and the US, cultural studies both became a global movement, and attracted the attention of many conservative opponents both within and beyond universities for a variety of reasons.  Some left-wing critics associated particularly with Marxist forms of political economy also attacked cultural studies for allegedly overstating the importance of cultural phenomena.  While cultural studies continues to have its detractors, the field has become a kind of a worldwide movement that is to this day associated with a raft of scholarly associations and programs, annual international conferences, publications and students and practitioners from [[Taiwan]] to [[Amsterdam]] and from [[Bangalore]] to [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]].&lt;ref&gt;Bérubé, Michael (2009), [http://chronicle.com/article/Whats-the-Matter-With/48334 "What's the Matter with Cultural Studies?"], ''The Chronicle of Higher Education''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cultstud.org/index.php?s=resources "Cultural Studies Associations, Networks and Programs"], extensive, but incomplete, list of associations, networks and programs as found on the website for the Association of Cultural Studies, Tampere, Finland.&lt;/ref&gt;  Somewhat distinct approaches to cultural studies have  emerged in different national and regional contexts such as the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Latin America, Asia, Africa and Italy.

==Characteristics==
In his 1994 book, ''Introducing Cultural Studies'', [[Ziauddin Sardar]] lists the following five main characteristics of cultural studies:&lt;ref&gt;Sardar, Ziauddin and Van Loon, Borin (1994). ''Introducing Cultural Studies.'' New York: Totem Books&lt;/ref&gt;

*The aim of cultural studies is to examine cultural practices and their relation to [[power (sociology)|power]]. For example, a study of a [[subculture]] (such as white working class youth in London) would consider their social practices against those of the dominant culture (in this example, the middle and upper classes in London who control the political and financial sectors that create policies affecting the well-being of white working class youth in London).
*The objective of cultural studies includes understanding culture in all its complex forms and analyzing the social and political context in which culture manifests itself.
*Cultural studies is a site of both study/analysis and political criticism/action. (For example, not only would a cultural studies scholar study an object, but s/he would connect this study to a larger, progressive political project.)
*Cultural studies attempts to expose and reconcile constructed divisions of [[knowledge]] that purport to be grounded in nature.
*Cultural studies has a commitment to an ethical evaluation of modern [[society]] and to a [[Radicalization|radical]] line of political action.

==History==
As Dennis Dworkin writes,&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, Dennis. ''Cultural Marxism in Post-War Britain: History, the New Left, and the Origins of Cultural Studies'' (Durham and London: Duke University Press, 1997), p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; "a critical moment" in the beginning of cultural studies as a field was when [[Richard Hoggart]] used the term in 1964 in founding the [[Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies]] (CCCS) at the [[University of Birmingham]] in the UK, which was to become home for the development of the intellectual orientation that has become known internationally as the "Birmingham School" of cultural studies.&lt;ref&gt;see also Corner, John (1991), "Postscript: Studying Culture—Reflections and Assessment: An Interview with Richard Hoggart." ''Media, Culture and Society'', Vol. 13, No. 2, April.&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Birmingham School|CCCS]] at the university thus became the world's first institutional home of cultural studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/historycultures/departments/history/research/projects/cccs/about.aspx|title=About the Birmingham CCCS - University of Birmingham|website=www.birmingham.ac.uk|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoggart appointed [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] as his assistant, and Hall was effectively directing [[The Birmingham School|CCCS]] by 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Ioan Davies, "British Cultural Marxism," ''International Journal of Politics, Culture and Society'' 4(3) (1991): 323-344, p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt; Hall formally assumed the directorship of [[The Birmingham School|CCCS]] in 1971, when Hoggart left Birmingham to become Assistant Director-General of [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Hoggart, An Idea and Its Servants: UNESCO from Within.  Newark, NJ: Transaction Publishers, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, the field of cultural studies became closely associated with Hall's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morley &amp; Chen (eds.)|title=Stuart Hall: Critical Dialogues in Cultural Studies|date=1996|publisher=Routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gilroy, Grossberg and McRobbie (eds.)|title=Without Guarantees: In Honour of Stuart Hall|date=2000|publisher=Verso|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1979, Hall left Birmingham to accept a prestigious chair in Sociology at the Open University in the UK, and Richard Johnson took over the directorship of the Centre.

In the late 1990s, "restructuring" at the [[University of Birmingham]] led to the elimination of [[The Birmingham School|CCCS]] and the creation of a new Department of Cultural Studies and Sociology (CSS) in 1999.  Then, in 2002, the University of Birmingham's senior administration abruptly announced the disestablishment of CSS, provoking a substantial international outcry.  The immediate reason for disestablishment of the new department was an unexpectedly low result in the UK's [[Research Assessment Exercise]] of 2001, though a dean from the university attributed the decision to "inexperienced ‘macho management.’"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Webster|first1=Frank|title=Cultural Studies and Sociology at, and After, the Closure of the Birmingham School|journal=Cultural Studies|date=2004|volume=18|issue=6|page=848}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The RAE, a holdover initiative of the [[Margaret Thatcher]]-led UK government of 1986,  determines research funding for university programs.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, Polly (2002), [http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/socialsciences/story/0,,745058,00.html "Birmingham's cultural studies department given the chop"], ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are numerous published accounts of the history of cultural studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Turner|first1=Graeme|title=British Cultural Studies: An Introduction|date=2003|publisher=Routledge|location=London|edition=Third}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hartley|first1=John|title=A Short History of Cultural Studies|date=2003|publisher=Sage|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|1980|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stuart Hall's directorship of CCCS at Birmingham===
Beginning in 1964, after the initial appearance of the founding works of British Cultural Studies in the late 1950s, [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]]'s pioneering work at [[The Birmingham School|CCCS]], along with that of his colleagues and postgraduate students including [[Paul Willis (cultural theorist)|Paul Willis]], [[Dick Hebdige]], David Morley, Charlotte Brunsdon, John Clarke, [[Richard Dyer]], Judith Williamson, Richard Johnson, Iain Chambers, Dorothy Hobson, Chris Weedon, Tony Jefferson, Michael Green and [[Angela McRobbie]], gave shape and substance to the field of cultural studies.  Many cultural studies scholars employed [[Marxist]] methods of analysis, exploring the relationships between cultural forms ([[Base and superstructure (Marxism)|the superstructure]]) and that of the political economy ([[Base and superstructure (Marxism)|the base]]).  By the 1970s, the work of [[Louis Althusser]] radically rethought the Marxist account of "base" and "superstructure" in ways that had a significant influence on the "Birmingham School."  Much of the work done at [[The Birmingham School|CCCS]] studied youth subcultural expressions of antagonism toward "respectable" middle-class British culture in the post-WWII period.  Also during the 70s, the politically formidable British working classes were in decline.  Britain's manufacturing industries were fading and union rolls were shrinking.  Yet millions of working class Britons backed the rise of [[Margaret Thatcher]].  For Stuart Hall and his colleagues, this shift in loyalty from the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] had to be explained in terms of cultural politics, which they had been tracking even before Thatcher's victory.  Some of this work was presented in the cultural studies classic, ''Policing the Crisis'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hall, Critcher, Jefferson, Clarke &amp; Roberts|title=Policing the Crisis: Mugging, the State, and Law and Order|date=1978|publisher=Holmes &amp; Meier Publishers, Inc.|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in other later texts such as Hall's ''The Hard Road to Renewal: Thatcherism and the Crisis of the Left''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hall|first1=Stuart|title=The Hard Road to Renewal: Thatcherism and the Crisis of the Left|date=1988|publisher=Verso|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''New Times: The Changing Face of Politics in the 1990s''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hall &amp; Jacques (eds.)|title=New Times: The Changing Face of Politics in the 1990s|date=1991|publisher=Verso|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To trace the development of British Cultural Studies, see, for example, the work of [[Richard Hoggart]], [[E. P. Thompson]], [[Raymond Williams]], [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]], [[Paul Willis (cultural theorist)|Paul Willis]], [[Angela McRobbie]], [[Paul Gilroy]], David Morley, Charlotte Brunsdon, [[Richard Dyer]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://uniteyouthdublin.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/john_storey_what_is_cultural_studies_a_readerbookzz-org.pdf|title=What is Cultural Studies?|last=Storey|first=John|date=1996|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural studies in the late-1970s and beyond===
By the late 1970s, scholars associated with [[The Birmingham School]] had firmly placed questions of gender and race on the cultural studies agenda, where they have remained ever since.  Also by the late 1970s, cultural studies had begun to attract a great deal of international attention.  It spread globally throughout the 1980s and 90s.  As it did so, it both encountered new conditions of knowledge production, and engaged with other major international intellectual currents such as poststructuralism, postmodernism and postcolonialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abbas &amp; Erni (eds.)|title=Internationalizing Cultural Studies: An Anthology|date=2005|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Malden, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The wide range of cultural studies journals now located throughout the world, as shown below, is one indication of the globalization of the field.

==Developments outside the UK==
In the US, prior to the emergence of British Cultural Studies, several versions of cultural analysis had emerged largely from pragmatic and liberal-pluralist philosophical traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Lindlof &amp; Taylor, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;60.&lt;/ref&gt; However, when British Cultural Studies began to spread internationally in the late 1970s, and to engage with feminism, poststructuralism, postmodernism and race in the late 70s and 1980s, critical cultural studies (i.e., Marxist, feminist, poststructuralist, etc.) expanded tremendously in US universities in fields such as communication studies, education, sociology and literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grossberg|Nelson|Treichler|1992|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warren &amp; Vavrus (eds.)|title=American Cultural Studies|date=2002|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Urbana Champaign, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hartley &amp; Pearson (eds.)|title=American Cultural Studies: A Reader|date=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Cultural Studies (journal)|Cultural Studies]]'', the flagship journal of the field, has been based in the US since its founding editor, [[John Fiske (media scholar)|John Fiske]], brought it there from Australia in 1987.

A thriving cultural studies scene has existed in [[Australia]] since the late 1970s, when several key CS practitioners emigrated there from the UK, taking British Cultural Studies with them, after [[Margaret Thatcher]] became Prime Minister of the UK in 1979.  A school of cultural studies known as "cultural policy studies" is one of the distinctive Australian contributions to the field, though it is not the only one.  Australia also gave birth to the world's first professional cultural studies association (now known as the Cultural Studies Association of Australasia) in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frow &amp; Morris (eds.)|title=Australian Cultural Studies: A Reader|date=1993|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Urbana Champaign, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Turner (ed.)|first1=Graeme|title=Nation, Culture, Text: Australian Cultural and Media Studies|date=1993|publisher=Routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cultural studies journals based in Australia include ''[[International Journal of Cultural Studies]]'', ''[[Continuum: Journal of Media &amp; Cultural Studies]]'' and ''Cultural Studies Review''.

In [[Canada]], cultural studies has sometimes focused on issues of [[technology and society]], continuing the emphasis in the work of [[Marshall McLuhan]], [[Harold Innis]], and others.  Cultural studies journals based in Canada include ''Topia: Canadian Journal of Cultural Studies''.

In Africa, [[human rights]] and [[Third World]] issues are among the central topics treated.  Cultural Studies journals based in Africa include the ''[[Journal of African Cultural Studies]]''.

In [[Latin America]], cultural studies has drawn on thinkers such as [[José Martí]], [[Ángel Rama]] and other Latin American figures, in addition to the Western theoretical sources associated with cultural studies in other parts of the world.  Leading Latin American cultural studies scholars include [[Néstor García Canclini]], [[Jésus Martín-Barbero]], and [[Beatriz Sarlo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sarto, Ríos &amp; Trigo (eds.)|title=The Latin American Cultural Studies Reader|date=2004|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham, NC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Irwin &amp; Szurmuck (eds.)|title=Dictionary of Latin American Cultural Studies|date=2012|publisher=University Press of Florida|location=Gainesville}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the key issues addressed by Latin American cultural studies scholars are [[decoloniality]], [[urban culture]]s, and [[postdevelopment theory]].  Latin American cultural studies journals include the ''Journal of Latin American Cultural Studies''.

Even though cultural studies developed much more rapidly in the UK than in continental Europe, there is a significant cultural studies presence in countries such as France, Spain and Portugal.  The field is relatively undeveloped in Germany, probably due to the continued influence of the [[Frankfurt School]], which is now often said to be in its third generation, which includes notable figures such as [[Axel Honneth]].  Cultural studies journals based in continental Europe include the ''[[European Journal of Cultural Studies]]'', the ''Journal of Spanish Cultural Studies'', ''[[French Cultural Studies]]'', and ''Portuguese Cultural Studies''.

In Germany, the term ''cultural studies'' specifically refers to the field in the Anglo-sphere especially British Cultural Studies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=GEkqO--HndgC&amp;pg=PA314&amp;lpg=PA314&amp;dq=cultural+studies+in+deutschen+Kontext&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MGHZhanE3M&amp;sig=QHeWMp6GMLv_WNbX3evkxYhTGcY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj2756p493QAhUGtRQKHRQSDxgQ6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=cultural%20studies%20in%20deutschen%20Kontext&amp;f=false|title=Normativität: Über die Hintergründe sozialwissenschaftlicher Theoriebildung|last=Ahrens|first=Johannes|last2=Beer|first2=Raphael|last3=Bittlingmayer|first3=Uwe H.|last4=Gerdes|first4=Jürgen|date=2011-02-10|publisher=Springer-Verlag|isbn=9783531930107|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; to differentiate it from the German [[:de:Kulturwissenschaft|Kulturwissenschaft]] which developed along different lines and is characterized by its distance from political science. However, Kulturwissenschaft and cultural studies are often used interchangeably, particularly by lay persons.

Throughout Asia, cultural studies has boomed and thrived since at least the beginning of the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chen &amp; Huat (eds.)|title=The Inter-Asia Cultural Studies Reader|date=2007|publisher=Routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cultural studies journals based in Asia include ''[[Inter-Asia Cultural Studies]]''. In India the Centre for Study of Culture and Society, Bangalore and the Department of Cultural Studies at The English and Foreign Languages University Hyderabad at two major institutional spaces for Cultural Studies.

==Issues, concepts and approaches==

===Marxism, feminism, race and culture===
As noted above, Marxism has been an important influence upon cultural studies. Those associated with [[The Birmingham School|CCCS]] initially engaged deeply with the [[structuralism]] of [[Louis Althusser]], and later in the 1970s turned decisively toward [[Antonio Gramsci]]. Cultural studies has also embraced the examination of race, gender, and other aspects of identity, as is illustrated, for example, by a number of key books published collectively under the name of [[The Birmingham School|CCCS]] in the late 1970s and early 80s, including ''Women Take Issue: Aspects of Women's Subordination'' (1978), and ''The Empire Strikes Back: Race and Racism in 70s Britain'' (1982).

===Gramsci and hegemony===
To understand the changing political circumstances of class, politics and culture in the United Kingdom, scholars at [[The Birmingham School]] turned to the work of [[Antonio Gramsci]], an Italian thinker, writer and communist party leader of the 1910s, 20s and '30s.  Gramsci had been concerned with similar issues: why would Italian laborers and peasants vote for fascists?  What strategic approach is necessary to mobilize popular support in more progressive directions?  Gramsci modified [[classical Marxism]], and argued that culture must be understood as a key site of political and social struggle.  In his view, capitalists used not only brute force (police, prisons, repression, military) to maintain control, but also penetrated the everyday culture of working people in a variety of ways in their efforts to win popular "consent."  It is important to recognize that for Gramsci, historical leadership, or "hegemony," involves the formation of alliances between class factions, and struggles within the cultural realm of everyday common sense.  Hegemony was always, for Gramsci, an interminable, unstable and contested process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hall|first1=Stuart|author-link1=Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|title=Gramsci's Relevance for the Study of Race and Ethnicity |journal=Journal of Communication Inquiry|date=June 1986|volume=10|issue=2 |pages=5–27|doi=10.1177/019685998601000202 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Scott Lash]] writes:
{{quote|text=In the work of Hall, Hebdige and McRobbie, popular culture came to the fore... What Gramsci gave to this was the importance of consent and culture.  If the fundamental Marxists saw power in terms of class-versus-class, then Gramsci gave to us a question of ''class alliance''. The rise of cultural studies itself was based on the decline of the prominence of fundamental class-versus-class politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lash|2007|pp=68–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Edgar and Sedgwick write:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The theory of [[hegemony]] was of central importance to the development of British cultural studies [particularly [[The Birmingham School]]. It facilitated analysis of the ways subordinate groups actively resist and respond to political and economic domination.  The subordinate groups needed not to be seen merely as the passive dupes of the dominant class and its ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Edgar &amp; Sedgewick, 165.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Structure and agency===
The development of hegemony theory in cultural studies was in some ways consonant with work in other fields exploring [[Structure and agency|agency]], a theoretical concept that insists on the active, critical capacities of subordinated peoples (e.g. the working classes, colonized peoples, women).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Giddens|first1=Anthony|title=The Constitution of Society: Outline of the Theory of Structuration|date=1984|publisher=Polity Press|location=Malden, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As Stuart Hall famously argued in his 1981 essay, "Notes on Deconstructing 'the Popular'," "ordinary people are not cultural dopes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Guins &amp; Cruz (eds.)|title=Popular Culture: A Reader|date=2005|publisher=Sage|location=London|pages=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Insistence on accounting for the agency of subordinated peoples runs counter to the work of traditional structuralists.  Some analysts have however been critical of some work in cultural studies that they feel overstates the significance of or even romanticizes some forms of popular cultural agency.

Cultural studies often concerns itself with agency at the level of the practices of everyday life, and approaches such research from a standpoint of radical contextualism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grossberg|first1=Lawrence|title=Cultural Studies in the Future Tense|date=2010|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham, NC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, cultural studies rejects universal accounts of cultural practices,  meanings, and identities.

Judith Butler, an American feminist theorist whose work is often associated with cultural studies, wrote that

&lt;blockquote&gt;the move from a [[Structuralism|structuralist]] account in which capital is understood to structure social relations in relatively homologous ways to a view of hegemony in which power relations are subject to repetition, convergence and rearticulation brought the question of temporality into the thinking of structure. It has marked a shift from a form of [[Althusser]]ian theory that takes structural totalities as theoretical objects to one in which the insights into the contingent possibility of structure inaugurate a renewed conception of hegemony as bound up with the contingent sites and strategies of the rearticulation of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Butler|first1=Judith|title=Further Reflections on Conversations of Our Time|journal=Diacritics|date=1997|volume=27|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Globalization===
In recent decades, as capitalist culture has spread throughout the world via contemporary forms of [[globalization]], cultural studies has generated important analyses of local sites and practices of negotiation with and resistance to Western hegemony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Appadurai|first1=Arjun|title=Modernity at Large: Cultural Dimensions of Globalization|date=1996|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural consumption===
Cultural Studies criticizes the traditional view of the passive consumer, particularly by underlining the different ways people ''read,'' receive and interpret cultural texts, or appropriate other kinds of cultural products, or otherwise participate in the production and circulation of meanings. On this view, a consumer can appropriate, actively rework or challenge the meanings circulated through cultural texts. In some of its variants, then, cultural studies has thus shifted the analytical focus from (traditional understandings of) production to consumption, which is nevertheless understood as a form of production (of meanings, of identities, etc.) in its own right. [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]], [[John Fiske (media studies)|John Fiske]], and others have been influential in these developments.

A special 2008 issue of the field's flagship journal, ''Cultural Studies'', examined "Anti-Consumerism" from a variety of cultural studies angles.  As Jeremy Gilbert noted in his contribution to this issue, cultural studies must grapple with the fact that “we now live in an era when, throughout the capitalist world, the overriding aim of government economic policy is to maintain consumer spending levels. This is an era when ‘consumer confidence’ is treated as the key indicator and cause of economic effectiveness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gilbert|first1=Jeremy|title=Against the Commodification of Everything|journal=Cultural Studies|date=2008|volume=22|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The concept of "text"===
Cultural studies, drawing upon and developing [[semiotics]], uses the concept of ''[[wikt:text|text]]'' to designate not only written language, but also [[television program]]s, [[film]]s, [[photography|photograph]]s, [[fashion]], [[hairstyle]]s, and so forth; the texts of cultural studies comprise all the meaningful artifacts of culture. This conception of textuality derives especially from the work of the pioneering and influential semiotician, [[Roland Barthes]], but also owes debts to other sources, such as [[Juri Lotman]] and his colleagues from [[Tartu–Moscow School]]. Similarly, the field widens the concept of "culture." "Culture," for a cultural studies researcher, includes not only  traditional [[high culture]] (the culture of [[Ruling class|ruling]] [[social group]]s),&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin, Mikhail 1981. ''The Dialogic Imagination.'' Austin, TX: UT Press, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; but also everyday meanings and practices, which have, as noted above, become a central focus of cultural studies.  Cultural studies even approaches sites and spaces of everyday life, such as pubs, living rooms, gardens and beaches, as "texts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fiske, Hodge and Turner|title=Myths of Oz: Reading Australian Popular Culture|date=1987|publisher=Boston|location=Allen &amp; Unwin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jeff Lewis (professor)|Jeff Lewis]] summarized much of the work on textuality and textual analysis in his cultural studies textbook and a post-9/11 monograph on media and terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Lewis (2008) Cultural Studies, Sage, London; Jeff Lewis, (2005) Language Wars: The Role of Media and Culture in Global Terror and Political Violence, Pluto, London.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lewis, 'textual studies' use complex and difficult heuristic methods and require both powerful interpretive skills and a subtle conception of politics and contexts. The task of the cultural analyst, for Lewis, is to engage with both knowledge systems and texts, and observe and analyse the ways the two interact with one another.  This engagement represents the critical dimensions of the analysis, its capacity to illuminate the hierarchies within and surrounding the given text and its discourses.

==Academic reception==
Cultural studies has evolved through the confluence of various disciplines—anthropology, media and communication studies, literary studies, education, geography, philosophy, sociology, politics and others. While some have accused certain areas of cultural studies of meandering into political relativism and a kind of empty version of "postmodern" analysis, others hold that at its core, cultural studies provides a significant conceptual and methodological framework for cultural, social and economic critique.  This critique is designed to "deconstruct" the meanings and assumptions that are inscribed in the institutions, texts and practices that work with and through, and produce and re-present, culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|2008|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2015}} Thus, while some scholars and disciplines like to dismiss cultural studies for its methodological openness and rejection of disciplinarity, its core strategies of critique and analysis have had a profound influence throughout the more progressive and critical areas of the social sciences and humanities. Cultural studies work on forms of social differentiation, control and inequality, identity, community-building, media, and knowledge production, for example, has had a substantial impact. Moreover, the influence of cultural studies has become increasingly evident in areas as diverse as [[translation studies]], health studies, international relations, development studies, computer studies, economics, archaeology, and neurobiology, as well as across the range of disciplines that initially shaped the emergence of cultural studies, including literature, sociology, communication studies, and anthropology.

Cultural studies has also diversified its own interests and methodologies, incorporating a range of studies on media policy, democracy, design, leisure, tourism, warfare and development. While certain key concepts such as ideology or discourse, class, hegemony, identity and gender remain significant, cultural studies has long engaged with and integrated new concepts and approaches such as deconstruction and postmodernism. The field thus continues to pursue political critique through its engagements with the forces of culture and politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|During|2007|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2015}}

The Blackwell ''Companion to Cultural Studies'', edited by leading cultural studies scholar Toby Miller, contains essays that analyze the development of cultural studies approaches within each of a wide range of disciplines across the contemporary social sciences and humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Miller|2006|p=index}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary scholars===
Many cultural studies practitioners work in departments of English or Comparative Literature.  Nevertheless, some traditional literary scholars such as Yale professor [[Harold Bloom]] have been outspoken critics of cultural studies. On the level of methodology, these scholars dispute the theoretical underpinning of the movement's critical framework.

Bloom stated his position during the September 3, 2000 episode of [[C-SPAN]]'s ''[[Booknotes]]'', while discussing his book ''How to Read and Why'':

{{quote|text=[T]here are two enemies of reading now in the world, not just in the English-speaking world. One [is] the lunatic destruction of literary studies...and its replacement by what is called cultural studies in all of the universities and colleges in the English-speaking world, and everyone knows what that phenomenon is. I mean, the...now-weary phrase 'political correctness' remains a perfectly good descriptive phrase for what has gone on and is, alas, still going on almost everywhere and which dominates, I would say, rather more than three-fifths of the tenured faculties in the English-speaking world, who really do represent a treason of the intellectuals, I think, a 'betrayal of the clerks'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Read and Why|url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?157968-1/read|publisher=C-SPAN|accessdate=April 19, 2017|date=September 3, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Marxist literary critic [[Terry Eagleton]] is not wholly opposed to cultural studies, but has criticised aspects of it and highlighted what he sees as its strengths and weaknesses in books such as ''After Theory'' (2003). For Eagleton, literary and cultural theory have the potential to say important things about the "fundamental questions" in life, but theorists have rarely realized this potential.

===Sociologists===
Cultural studies has also had a substantial impact on sociology.  For example, when Stuart Hall left [[The Birmingham School|CCCS]] at Birmingham, it was to accept a prestigious professorship in Sociology at the Open University in Britain.  The subfield of cultural sociology, in particular, is disciplinary home to many cultural studies practitioners.  Nevertheless, there are some differences between sociology as a discipline and the field of cultural studies as a whole.  While sociology was founded upon various historic works purposefully distinguishing the subject from [[philosophy]] or [[psychology]], cultural studies has explicitly interrogated and criticized traditional understandings and practices of disciplinarity.  Most CS practitioners think it is best that cultural studies neither emulate disciplines nor aspire to disciplinarity for cultural studies. Rather, they promote a kind of radical interdisciplinarity as the basis for cultural studies.

One sociologist whose work has had a major influence upon cultural studies is [[Pierre Bourdieu]].  Bourdieu's work makes innovative use of statistics and in-depth interviews.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Harker, Cheleen Mahar, Chris Wilkes (eds), ''An Introduction to the Work of Pierre Bourdieu: The Theory of Practice''. Houndmills: Macmillan, 1990, pp. 68-71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bourdieu|first1=Pierre|title=Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste|date=1984|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, although Bourdieu's work has been highly influential within cultural studies, and although Bourdieu regarded his work as a form of science, cultural studies has never embraced the idea that it should aspire toward "scientificity," and has marshalled a wide range of theoretical and methodological arguments against the fetishization of "scientificity" as a basis for cultural studies.

Two sociologists who have been critical of cultural studies, [[Chris Rojek]] and [[Bryan S. Turner]], argue in their article, "Decorative sociology: towards a critique of the cultural turn", that cultural studies, particularly the flavor championed by Stuart Hall, lacks a stable research agenda, and privileges the contemporary reading of texts, thus producing an ahistorical theoretical focus. Many, however, would argue, following Hall, that cultural studies has always sought to avoid the establishment of a fixed research agenda; this follows from its critique of disciplinarity.  Moreover, Hall and many others have long argued against the misunderstanding that textual analysis is the sole methodology of cultural studies, and have practiced numerous other approaches, as noted above.  Rojek and Turner also level the accusation that there is "a sense of moral superiority about the correctness of the political views articulated" in cultural studies&lt;ref&gt;Rojek, Chris, and Bryan Turner, "Decorative sociology: towards a critique of the cultural turn." ''The Sociological Review'' 48.4 (2000): 629-648.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physicist Alan Sokal===
{{Main article|Sokal affair}}
In 1996, physicist [[Alan Sokal]] expressed his opposition to cultural studies by [[Sokal affair|submitting a hoax article]] to a cultural studies journal, ''[[Social Text]]''. The article, which was crafted as a parody of what Sokal referred to as the "fashionable nonsense" of [[postmodernism]], was accepted by the editors of the journal, which did not at the time practice peer review. When the paper appeared in print, Sokal published a second article in a self-described "academic gossip" magazine, ''[[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]'', revealing his hoax on ''[[Social Text]]''. Sokal stated that his motivation stemmed from his rejection of contemporary critiques of scientific rationalism:

{{quote|text="Politically, I'm angered because most (though not all) of this silliness is emanating from the self-proclaimed Left. We're witnessing here a profound historical ''volte-face''. For most of the past two centuries, the Left has been identified with science and against obscurantism; we have believed that rational thought and the fearless analysis of objective reality (both natural and social) are incisive tools for combating the mystifications promoted by the powerful -- not to mention being desirable human ends in their own right. The recent turn of many "progressive" or "leftist" academic humanists and social scientists toward one or another form of epistemic relativism betrays this worthy heritage and undermines the already fragile prospects for progressive social critique. Theorizing about "the social construction of reality" won't help us find an effective treatment for AIDS or devise strategies for preventing global warming. Nor can we combat false ideas in history, sociology, economics and politics if we reject the notions of truth and falsity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/lingua_franca_v4/lingua_franca_v4.html "A Physicist Experiments With Cultural Studies"], [[Alan Sokal]], English translation of article from ''Lingua Franca'', 1996. Physics.nyu.edu.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Founding works==
Hall and others have identified some core originating texts, or the original "curriculum", of the field of cultural studies:
* [[Richard Hoggart]]'s ''[[The Uses of Literacy]]''
* [[Raymond Williams]]' ''[[Culture and Society]]'' and ''[[The Long Revolution]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|1980|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18827">'''Debt-for-nature swaps''' are financial transactions in which a portion of a [[developing nation]]'s foreign debt is forgiven in exchange for local investments in environmental conservation measures.

==History==
The debt-for-nature swaps concept was first conceived by [[Thomas Lovejoy]] of the [[World Wildlife Fund]] in 1984 as an opportunity to deal with the problems of developing-nation indebtedness and its consequent deleterious effect on the environment.&lt;ref name=Visser&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Visser |first1=Dana R. |first2=Guillermo A. |last2=Mendoza |year=1994 |title=Debt-for-Nature Swaps in Latin America |journal=Journal of Forestry |volume=92 |issue=6 |pages=13–6 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/openurl?genre=article&amp;issn=0022-1201&amp;volume=92&amp;issue=6&amp;spage=13&amp;epage=16&amp;aulast=Visser }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of the [[Latin American debt crisis]] that resulted in steep reductions to the environmental conservation ability of highly indebted nations, Lovejoy suggested that ameliorating debt promoting conservation could be done at the same time. Since the first swap occurred between [[Conservation International]] and Bolivia in 1987, many national governments and conservation organizations have engaged in debt-for-nature swaps. Most swaps occur in tropical countries, which contain many [[biodiversity|diverse species]] of flora and fauna.&lt;ref name=Reilly&gt;{{cite book |last1=Reilly |first1=William |year=2006 |chapter=Using International Finance to Further Conservation: The First 15 Years of Debt-for-Nature Swaps |pages=197–214 |chapterurl={{Google books|HuPwt987R7gC|page=197|plainurl=yes}} |title=Sovereign Debt at the Crossroads: Challenges and Proposals for Resolving the Third World Debt Crisis |editor1-first=Chris |editor1-last=Jochnick |editor2-first=Fraser A. |editor2-last=Preston |isbn=978-0-19-803752-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, countries that have engaged in debt-for-nature swaps typically have several threatened or endangered species, experience rapid [[deforestation]], and have relatively stable, often democratic, political systems.&lt;ref name=Deacon&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3147074 |jstor=3147074 |title=The Structure of an Environmental Transaction: The Debt-for-Nature Swap |journal=Land Economics |volume=73 |issue=1 |pages=1–24 |year=1997 |last1=Deacon |first1=Robert T |last2=Murphy |first2=Paul }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1987, debt-for-nature agreements have generated over US$1 billion for conservation in developing countries.&lt;ref name=Sheikh&gt;{{cite web |first=Pervaze A. |last=Sheikh |date=March 30, 2010 |title=Debt-for-Nature Initiatives and the Tropical Forest Conservation Act: Status and Implementation |url=https://www.cbd.int/financial/debtnature/g-inventory2010.pdf |publisher=Congressional Research Service }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
The financing mechanism for debt-for-nature swaps is an agreement among the funder(s), the national government of the debtor country, and the conservation organization(s) using the funds.  The national government of the indebted country agrees to a payment schedule on the amount of the debt forgiven, usually paid through the nation’s central bank, in local currency or bonds. The process is shown in Figure 1.
Participation in debt-for-nature swaps has been restricted primarily to countries where the risk of default on debt payments is high.&lt;ref name=Greiner&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.landusepol.2006.07.001 |title=Supporting on-farm biodiversity conservation through debt-for-conservation swaps: Concept and critique |journal=Land Use Policy |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=458–71 |year=2007 |last1=Greiner |first1=Romy |last2=Lankester |first2=Allyson }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these circumstances, the funder can purchase the debt at well below its [[face value]].

==Types==
In a '''commercial debt-for-nature swap''' or '''three-party debt-for-nature swap''', a [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO) acts as the funder/donor and purchases debt titles from commercial banks on the [[secondary market]]. Since the late 1980s, organizations such as [[Conservation International]], [[The Nature Conservancy]], and the [[World Wildlife Fund]] have participated in international debt-for-nature swaps. The NGO transfers the debt title to the debtor country, and in exchange the country agrees to either enact certain environmental policies or endow a government bond in the name of a conservation organization, with the aim of funding conservation programs.In total, recorded third-party debt-for-nature swaps have generated nearly US$140 million in conservation funding from 1987-2010 (see Table 1).&lt;ref name=Sheikh /&gt;

'''Bilateral debt-for-nature swaps''' take place between two governments. In a bilateral swap, a creditor country forgives a portion of the public bilateral debt of a debtor nation in exchange for environmental commitments from that country.&lt;ref name=Deacon /&gt; An example of a bilateral swap occurred when the U.S. Government, under the Enterprise for the Americas Initiative, forgave a portion of Jamaica's official debt obligations and allowed the payments on the balance to go into national funds that finance environmental conservation. These funds established the Environmental Foundation of Jamaica in 1993. '''Multilateral debt-for-nature swaps''' are similar to bilateral swaps but involve international transactions of more than two national governments. Recorded bilateral and multilateral debt-for-nature swaps have generated nearly US$900 million in total conservation funding from 1987-2010 (see Table 1).&lt;ref name=Sheikh /&gt; A closely related form of debt swap is a debt-for-efficiency swap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1057/ejdr.2013.34 |title=Financing the Clean Development Mechanism through Debt-for-Efficiency Swaps?

===Funders===
[[Nature Conservancy]], [[Leonardo DiCaprio|Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation]], Oak Foundation and [[Global Environment Facility]] have previously provided funds to pay to the debts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.undp.org/content/sdfinance/en/home/solutions/debt-for-nature-swaps.html{{full citation needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.leonardodicaprio.org/ldf-supports-first-ever-debt-for-nature-swap-in-seychelles/{{full citation needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
Debt for nature swaps have often been described as agreements in which all parties benefit and that there are no disadvantages. The benefits to the debtor country, creditor, and conservation organizations are outlined below.

===For debtors===
Through a debt-for-nature swap, a debtor country reduces its total outstanding external debt. The debtor country is able to buy back part of its debt in more favorable terms and pay for conservation initiatives rather than debt service.&lt;ref name="Potier"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0264-8377(91)90034-G |title=Debt-for-nature swaps |journal=Land Use Policy |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=211–3 |year=1991 |last1=Potier |first1=Michael }}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to higher international purchasing power for the debtor country.&lt;ref name="Cassimon"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2010.10.001 |title=The pitfalls and potential of debt-for-nature swaps: A US-Indonesian case study |journal=Global Environmental Change |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=93–102 |year=2011 |last1=Cassimon |first1=Danny |last2=Prowse |first2=Martin |last3=Essers |first3=Dennis }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, some argue that converting outstanding debts in USD to local currency debts lowers the long-term debt burden on developing countries.&lt;ref name=Sheikh /&gt;&lt;ref name=Greiner /&gt; Additionally, debt-for-nature terms enable long-term planning and funding.&lt;ref name=Greiner /&gt;

If the country is interested in funding conservation, debt-for-nature swaps provide an additional source of funds for that purpose. In contrast to [[debt-for-equity swap]]s, debt-for-nature swaps do not compromise national sovereignty since no property exchange takes place.&lt;ref name=Potier /&gt;

Environmental benefits to the debtor country include but are not limited to:
* promoting [[sustainable development|responsible resource use]]
* helping to preserve [[biodiversity]] 
* maintaining [[ecosystem services]]
* reducing [[deforestation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1573-7861.2011.01245.x |title=Do Commercial Debt-for-Nature Swaps Matter for Forests? A Cross-National Test of World Polity Theory |journal=Sociological Forum |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=381–410 |year=2011 |last1=Shandra |first1=John M |last2=Restivo |first2=Michael |last3=Shircliff |first3=Eric |last4=London |first4=Bruce }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investment in conservation also demonstrates economic returns. For example, Costa Rica has put debt-for-nature funds to good use in establishing and improving parks and preserves, and it has seen marked improvements in tourism, improved water quality, and increased energy output even in the short term.&lt;ref name=Potier /&gt;

===For creditors===
Creditors see debt-for-nature swaps as a method to rid themselves of high-risk claims. By selling the debt claim, they can re-invest the proceeds from the sale in higher-performing ventures. Creditors faced with low-performance loans may also seek to limit their exposure, that is, to avoid further lending to debtor countries until their loans are serviced.&lt;ref name=Greiner/&gt;

===For conservation organizations===
Debt-for-nature agreements are a long-term source of funding for conservation initiatives, so both international organizations acting as donors and local organizations using funds are able to further their goals of conservation. The donor organizations also purchase the debt at a value below its face value and usually redeem it above its market value. In this way, swaps are thought to generate conservation funds at a discount.&lt;ref name=Greiner /&gt;

==Decline==
The decline in the number of debt-for-nature swaps in recent years likely results in part from the higher prices of commercial debt in secondary markets.&lt;ref name=Cassimon /&gt;&lt;ref name=Resor&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Resor |first1=J.P. |year=1997 |title=Debt-for-nature swaps: a decade of experience and new directions for the future |journal=Unasylva |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/w3247e/w3247e06.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1980s and early 1990s, conservation organizations could purchase relatively large debt obligations on the secondary market at highly discounted rates. During this period, conservation organizations and national governments negotiated swaps at a rate of approximately five agreements per year. Since 2000, the number of swap agreements has dropped to about two per year.&lt;ref name=Sheikh /&gt;
Additionally, other agreements for [[debt restructuring]] and cancellation, such as the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative, lower a developing country’s debt obligation by much more than the relatively small contribution debt-for-nature swaps make.&lt;ref name=Sheikh /&gt;
Also, debt-for-nature swaps have undergone thorough critique by skeptics; these criticisms may have contributed to the decline of the debt-for-nature financing mechanism.

==Criticism==

===Overstated financial benefits===
Debt-for-nature swaps produce only minor debt reductions and generate far less funding than the face value of the debt purchased in the secondary market.&lt;ref name=Cassimon /&gt; The amount of public debt relieved by debt-for-nature swaps, even in the countries that participate in swaps regularly, accounts for less than 1% of total external debt.&lt;ref name=Didia&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00213624.2001.11506382 |title=Debt-for-Nature Swaps, Market Imperfections, and Policy Failures as Determinants of Sustainable Development and Environmental Quality |journal=Journal of Economic Issues |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=477–86 |year=2016 |last1=Didia |first1=Dal }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also, if the indebted country does not engage in conservation in the absence of a debt-for-nature agreement, the swap may not provide the indebted country a [[welfare economics|social welfare improvement]] or any [[fiscal space]] in the national budget.&lt;ref name=Cassimon /&gt;&lt;ref name=Garvie&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Garvie |first1=Devon A. |year=2002 |title=When are Debt for Nature Swaps Welfare—Improving? |journal=International Review of Economics and Business |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=165–73 |url=http://econ.queensu.ca/faculty/garvie/mini/garviedfns.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The government of the indebted country is still responsible for payment of the debt, albeit to a conservation organization rather than to the creditor. Also, the funds produced through the agreement may replace other forms of aid, debt assistance, or conservation funding.

===Misdirection of funds===
Critics of debt-for-nature swaps argue that they do not generate funds where the needs are greatest.&lt;ref name=Didia /&gt; Early in the history of debt-for-nature swaps, nearly three-quarters of the total funds generated went to Costa Rica, while other countries with needs equal to or exceeding those of Costa Rica did not receive any.&lt;ref name=Kraemer&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/107049659300200203 |title=Policy Responses to Tropical Deforestation: Are Debt-for-Nature Swaps Appropriate? |journal=The Journal of Environment &amp; Development |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=41–65 |year=2016 |last1=Kraemer |first1=Moritz |last2=Hartmann |first2=Jörg }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil, for example, has had limited involvement in debt-for-nature swaps though it has experienced rapid deforestation.&lt;ref name=Sheikh /&gt;

===Environmental degradation and external debt===
Research has shown that debt relief alone does not spur environmental conservation. Though debt shows a positive correlation with deforestation levels, most researchers believe that highly indebted countries lack political institutions and enforcement structures that would limit [[environmental degradation]].&lt;ref name=Didia /&gt; Heavily indebted countries may engage in high levels of deforestation due to shortsighted policies.&lt;ref name=Bhattarai&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0305-750X(01)00019-5 |title=Institutions and the Environmental Kuznets Curve for Deforestation: A Crosscountry Analysis for Latin America, Africa and Asia |journal=World Development |volume=29 |issue=6 |pages=995–1010 |year=2001 |last1=Bhattarai |first1=Madhusudan |last2=Hammig |first2=Michael }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some suggest that the solutions to environmental degradation are effective political institutions, democracy, property rights, and market structures,&lt;ref name=Didia /&gt; and this development theory matches many of the principles of the [[Washington Consensus]]. Others suggest that primarily wealth creation and increased income have a positive impact on environmental conservation.&lt;ref name=Bhattarai /&gt; This approach considers an environmental [[Kuznets curve]], by which environmental degradation increases, reaches a tipping point, then decreases as income or wealth increases.

===Insufficient funding of environmental protection===
Ultimately, the responsibility of conservation lies with the local non-governmental organization implementing the protection measures. Debt-for-nature swaps are only effective when the conservation organizations are respected by local residents, have a good financial management capacity, and have a good relationship with government and other non-governmental organizations.&lt;ref name=Potier /&gt;&lt;ref name=Resor /&gt;

===Impacts on the poor===
Debt for nature swaps are usually actioned by an indebted nation's elite, not the peasantry who may traditionally have owned or at least used the land in question. Land rights are often expressed in different ways and ownership takes many forms. Some early debt-for-nature swaps tended to overlook the people living on the land set aside for conservation.&lt;ref name=Choudry&gt;{{cite web |last=Choudry |first=Aziz |date=October 2003 |title=Conservation International: Privatizing Nature, Plundering Biodiversity |work=Seedling |url=https://www.grain.org/es/article/entries/406-conservation-international-privatizing-nature-plundering-biodiversity }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent swaps have sought to include local residents, especially indigenous peoples, in the decision making process and the management of lands.&lt;ref name=Reilly /&gt; Although "seeking" to include does not mean that local residents have been included. Reports of recent debt swap cases in Madagascar, for instance, indicate local resentment towards conservation projects.&lt;ref name=Eurozine&gt;http://www.eurozine.com/articles/2008-02-28-bloch-en.html{{full citation needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Donata Premeru''' (born June 4, 1934 in [[Yugoslavia]]) is a [[musicologist]], [[broadcasting|broadcaster]], [[Lyricist|music writer]], [[journalist]], [[lecturer]] and historian of Arts.

==Biography and career==
After graduation at [[Musicology and History of Arts in Zagreb]] ([[Croatia]]), she did postgraduate studies of Early and Contemporary Music at [[London University]] ([[UK]]). Donata started as student lecturer and broadcaster at [[Radio Zagreb]] and continued as Music Editor of Stereorama programme on [[Radio Belgrade]]. In 1965 she was invited to start the Radio Beograd Third Programme (music section) as its first musicologist, and in 1983 its first stereo weekend Music Programme [[Stereorama]], which was closed down in November 2015, while celebrating the 50th anniversary of its III Programme.

One of the most acclaimed broadcasts of her ''Music Matters'' (''Muzika s povodom''), often thematically or in cycles: "European Cities of Culture 1985-2012"; "Early Music Centers in the 17th and 18th-century – from Venice to Mannheim"; "Entartete Musik series"; "Tragically Ended Careers of Young Musicians"; "Contemporary Music Scene Worldwide; Women Composers 2000-2012 (more than 200 names)"; "Unknown/Forgotten Composers of the 20th Century"; "Romantic Piano Concertos"; "Composers of the 21st Century"; "Dialogues – between Early and Contemporary Music"; "Notable Anniversaries"; "Writers in Music"; "Accordion on the classical music scene XIX-XXI century"; "Music written for film"; etc.

The composer, writer and artist [[Dušan Radić]] (1929-2010) in his book ''Tragovi balkanske vrleti-vreme-život-muzika'' (2007) dedicated a whole section (p.&amp;nbsp;107-114) to Donata Premeru and her broadcast programme ''Music Matters''. For after 20 years of his absence from the musical scene, she interrupted this silence and invited him in her radio programme regarding his 75th birthday on April 10, 2004. In 2016, book ''Film and Music – Temptations of great composers'' – based on 14 radio programmes – was published with her guest, [[Borislav Stojkov]].

An '''electric gate''' is an entrance [[gate]] which can be opened and closed via an electric powered [[Mechanism (engineering)|mechanism]].

==Electric Gate Options==
[[File:Sliding electric gate-001.JPG|thumb|A sliding electric gate with electric motor and backup battery in case of mains failure. Note also the Infrared obstacle [[sensor]] located on the wall to prevent the gate from closing while a vehicle or other obstacle is in the way.]]
The most popular electric gates for residential properties are swing gates, but these are not the only option available.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===Articulated===
Articulated gate openers can be used for gates with wide posts allowing opening in small spaces. An easy system for DIY installers  as they are simple to install but not as aesthetically pleasing as other motor designs. Also known as Crank arm operators, they are the main type of automation system sold in France, where low aluminium gates are often used.

===Underground===
Under-gate Jack operators usually control the gate by directly moving the pivot point of each gate leaf. This makes the unit ideal cosmetically and also allows for up to 180 degrees of leaf swing as required. However controlling the pivot point of the gate, is like opening a door by twisting the hinge, and as so is very difficult due to the loads needed at that point. This is highlighted with snap, as the gate has to change direct, as soon as it can. For this reason they are recommend as only suitable for ‘Domestic’ systems in a low risk of abuse environment. Another major consideration with the use of under-gate units is that of water immersion/ingress and warranty voidance. If the water table is high or the drainage of the unit’s foundation box inadequate throughout the systems life, then water ingress and unit failure is increased.

Ram or link arm units are usually simpler to install and maintain, they are visible to otherwise ignorant abuse and as they fix down along each gate leaf, they also have an obvious and sometimes major, mechanical advantage over Jacks. Therefore, Rams are far more suitable on Multi-user &amp; commercial systems. Also the manual release is always above ground, making it often more user friendly in operation.

===Sliding===
If space is an issue or the driveway behind the gates is on a steep incline, a better option would be a sliding gate. Sliding gates are also very popular in a commercial environment.
Sliding gates are also used for cantillever gate systems.

==Electric Gate History==
The first commercial electric gate systems were hydraulic and designed for reliability and ease of use. The cost of the hydraulic systems however meant that other companies started producing more affordable electromechanical alternatives.  Hydraulic motors are the preferred choice on large and heavy gates as they can generate high levels of torque, electromechanical systems designed for lower usage domestic installations because they can be produced more cost effectively. A number of larger manufacturers now produce both hydraulic and electromechanical systems providing unbiased choice for customers.

==The Electric Gate Motor==
The backbone of any electric gate, whether automatic or not, is the electric gate motor, two distinct motor types exist hydraulic, or electromechanical. This is the electric device which actually enables the electric gate to open and close without having to manually push the gate. All types of electric gates and barriers make use of a motor of some kind. There are many different kinds of electric gate motors offered by a number of automation companies most located in Italie .

==Electric Gate Safety==
The safety of an automated gate is an important consideration, in the European Union, automated gate safety is specified by a series of European Normalisations. An automated gate that has not been fitted with safety in mind can potentially become a major hazard particularly to untrained users. Various safety devices are available to make sure that your gates meet the highest of European or American safety standards.

==Gate and Security==
Electric gates alone, however solid and imposing they may be, cannot guarantee a completely [[secure environment]] electric locks, are often needed to boost the locking effectiveness of the gate motors. Electric gates are recommended to be used in combination with other security features to install a full [[Burglar alarm|security system]]. A few of these features are closed circuits with [[Closed-circuit television|security cameras]], additional gates in conjunction with the main gate, electronic keycards and keypads, [[security guard]]s.

Aside from the additional security features that should go with parking barrier gates, electric security gates often offer safety features like [[sensors]] that determine when there is an obstruction to prevent the electronic gate from swinging into a vehicle or closing on somebody's [[hands]]. To prevent the electronic gates from being damaged by irresponsible drivers driving fast [[speed bump]]s are also commonly placed before gate entrances to slow down vehicles.

==Safety Regulations in Europe==
All installations must meet with the Machinery directive 2006/42/EC with EN13241-1 being the regulations concerning gates. The installer of the gate is responsible for the conformity to regulation, not the manufacturer. The two main EN regulations that then apply are EN 12453 which describes the safety levels that should be observed when installing a gate and EN12445 which describes the testing method that must be undertaken. 
The major points are the maximum amount of force at certain test points. Example - a maximum of 400N of force can be applied in the last 50, 300 and 500&amp;nbsp;mm of travel of a gate, after the initial impact the force must drop to 150N within 0.75 of a second and reduce to 25N within 5 seconds.  During the mid travel of a gate the allowable force is 1400N. 
A full risk assessment of the gates must take place with all crush, cutting points shown to the client with appropriate protection devices offered, a recommended maintenance program should also be provided. Finally the installer must confirm that all electrical equipment fitted has the European CE mark all the time.

To conform to these regulations the gate system must be checked with a calibrated force tester and the full results kept in a technical file for 7 years. If the gate is not tested it does not comply.
Most gate kits can be fitted with safety equipment so that these limits are achieved and so cover that part of EN13241-1.

Two recent incidents in the UK when children were killed by sliding gates have resulted in the UK Health and Safety department issuing a Gate Safety Bulletin.&lt;ref name="Safety-bulletin"&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/safetybulletins/electricgates2.htm Electric Gate Safety]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elena Ramírez Parra''' (born 1972) is a Spanish botanist who won a [[L'Oréal-UNESCO Awards for Women in Science]] in 2010. She studies the negative effects that produce [[environmental stress]] (drought, salinity of the soil, excess radiation, presence of [[heavy metals]] and the high and low temperatures). Her goal is to improve harvests.

==Life==
Ramírez studied biological sciences at the [[Autonomous University of Madrid]] and a doctorate in [[molecular biology]] from the same university (2000).

She became a senior researcher at the Centre for Plant Biotechnology and Genomics (Centro de Biotecnología y Genómica de Plantas, CBGP) of the National Instituto Nacional de Investigación y Tecnología Agraria y Alimentaria (INIA) and the [[Technical University of Madrid]] (UPM), studying the negative effects that produce environmental stress in plants.&lt;ref name=cbgp&gt;{{cite web|title=GENETIC AND MOLECULAR ANALYSIS OF CROP NATURAL VARIATION IN FRUIT QUALITY TRAITS |url=http://www.cbgp.upm.es/en/analisis_natural.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her investigation characterises the mechanisms that plants use to respond to external stresses like drought, soil salinity, heavy metals and extreme temperatures. She tries to create a generation of new varieties that will improve harvests.&lt;ref name="lo"&gt;[http://www.culturabiotec.com/2011/02/prada/ La investigación “se viste de Prada”], 2011, culturabiotec.com, Retrieved 13 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In the course of her career, she has published many scientific articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Elena_Ramirez-Parra|title=Elena Ramirez-Parra - Dr. - Instituto Nacional de Investigación y Tecnología Agraria y Alimentaria, Madrid - INIA - CBGP- Centre of Biotechnology and Genomics in Plants|last2=|first2=|date=|website=ResearchGate|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cbgp /&gt;

In November 2010, she was awarded, with four scientists ([[Isabel Lastres Becker]], [[Ana Briones Alonso]], [[Mercedes Vila]] and [[María Antonia Herrero]]), the [[L'Oréal-UNESCO Awards for Women in Science]]. This endowment of €15000 is to reward the work of women scientists younger than 40.&lt;ref name="lo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pais"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://elpais.com/sociedad/2010/11/18/actualidad/1290034810_850215.html|title=Cinco científicas de la vida españolas reciben las becas L'Oréal-Unesco|first=|last=M.R.E|date=18 November 2010|publisher=|via=elpais.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, 251 million tubes of [[toothpaste]] were sold in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;FoodIndustryMagazine. (n.d.). Toothpaste unit sales in U.S. supermarkets in 2014 and 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; A single tube holds roughly 170 grams of toothpaste, so approximately 43 kilotonnes of toothpaste get washed into the water systems annually.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Brar S, Verma M, Tyagi R, Surampalli R (2009). Engineered Nanoparticles in Wastewater and Wastewater Sludge - Evidence and Impacts. Waste Management, 30: 504-520.&lt;/ref&gt; Toothpaste contains [[silver nanoparticle|silver nanoparticle&lt;nowiki/&gt;s]], also known as nanosilver or AgNPs, among other compounds.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Each tube of toothpaste contains approximately 91&amp;nbsp;mg of silver nanoparticles, with approximately 3.9 tonnes of silver nanoparticles entering the environment annually.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Silver nanoparticles are not entirely cleared from the water during the wastewater treatment process, possibly leading to detrimental environmental effects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Silver nanoparticles in toothpaste ==
[[Silver nanoparticle]]s are used for catalyzing chemical reactions, Raman imaging, and antimicrobial sterilization.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Choi, O., Deng, K. K., Kim, N. J., Ross, L., Jr., Surampalli, R. Y., &amp; Hu, Z. (2008). The inhibitory effects of silver nanoparticles, silver ions, and silver chloride colloids on microbial growth. Water Res, 42(12), 3066-3074.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with its antimicrobial properties, its low mammalian cell toxicity makes these particles a common addition to consumer products.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Washing textiles embedded with silver nanoparticles results in the oxidation and transformation of metallic Ag into [[Silver chloride|AgCl]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Silver nanoparticles have different physicochemical characteristics from the free silver ion, Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and possess increased optical, electromagnetic, and catalytic properties.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Particles with one dimension of 100&amp;nbsp;nm or less can generate reactive oxygen species. Smaller particles less than 10&amp;nbsp;nm may pass through cellular membranes and accumulate within the cell.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Silver nanoparticles were also found to attach to cellular membranes, eventually dissipating the proton motive force, leading to cell death.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

Silver nanoparticles that are larger than the openings of membrane [[Ion channel|channel proteins]] can easily clog channels, leading to the disruption of membrane permeability and transport.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, the antimicrobial effectiveness of silver nanoparticles has been shown to decrease when dissolved in liquid media.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The free silver ion are potentially toxic to bacteria and planktonic species in the water.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The positively charged silver ion can also attach to the negatively charged cell walls of bacteria, leading to deactivation of cellular enzymes, disruption of membrane permeability, and eventually, cell lysis and death.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, its toxicity to microorganisms is not overtly observed since the free silver ion is found in low concentrations in wastewater treatment systems and the natural environment due to its complexation with ligands such as [[chloride]], [[sulfide]], and [[thiosulfate]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
[[File:Silver_Nanoparticle_Interactions_in_Wastewater_Treatment_Systems.png|thumb|400px|Some occurrences of interactions of AgNPs in wastewater treatment systems are depicted.]]

=== Wastewater treatment ===
A majority of silver nanoparticles in consumer products go down the drain and are eventually released into sewer systems and reach wastewater treatment plants.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Kaegi, R., Voegelin, A., Sinnet, B., Zuleeg, S., Hagendorfer, H., Burkhardt, M., &amp; Siegrist, H. (2011).		Behavior of metallic silver nanoparticles in a pilot wastewater treatment plant. Environmental

Science Technology, 45(9), 3902-3908. doi:10.1021/es1041892.&lt;/ref&gt; Primary screening and grit removal in [[wastewater treatment]] does not completely filter out [[silver nanoparticle]]s, and coagulation treatment may lead to further condensation into wastewater sludge.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The secondary wastewater treatment process involves suspended growth systems which allow bacteria to decompose organic matter within the water.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Any [[silver nanoparticle]]s still suspended in the water may collect on these microbes, potentially killing them due to their antimicrobial effects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After passing through both treatment processes, the silver nanoparticles are eventually deposited into the environment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A majority of the submerged portions of wastewater treatment plants are anoxic and rich in sulfur.&lt;ref name=":19"/&gt; During the wastewater treatment process, silver nanoparticles either remain the same, are converted into free silver ions, complex with ligands, or agglomerate.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Hou, L., Li, K., Ding, Y., Li, Y., Chen, J., Wu, X., &amp; Li, X. (2012). Removal of silver nanoparticles in simulated wastewater treatment processes and its impact on COD and NH4 reduction. Chemosphere, 87(3), 248-252. doi:&lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2011.12.042&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Silver nanoparticles can also attach to wastewater [[biosolids]] found in both the sludge and the effluent.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Silver ions in wastewater are removed efficiently because of their strong complexation with chloride or sulfide.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Brown, J. (2017). Impact of Silver Nanoparticles on Wastewater Treatment. Nanotechnologies for Environmental Remediation: Applications and Implications (pp. 255-267). Cham: Springer International Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A majority of the silver found in wastewater treatment plant [[Effluent sewer|effluent]] is associated with reduced sulfur as organic [[Thiol|thiol groups]] and inorganic sulfides.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Silver nanoparticles also tend to accumulate in [[activated sludge]], and the dominant form of the silver found in sewage sludge is [[Silver sulfide|Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Therefore, most of the silver found in wastewater treatment plants is in the form of silver nanoparticles or silver precipitates such as [[Silver sulfide|Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S]] and [[Silver chloride|AgCl]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The amount of silver precipitate formed depends on silver ion release, which increases with increasing [[Oxygen saturation|dissolved oxygen]] concentration and decreasing pH.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Hou, L., Li, K., Ding, Y., Li, Y., Chen, J., Wu, X., &amp; Li, X. (2012). Removal of silver nanoparticles in simulated wastewater treatment processes and its impact on COD and NH4 reduction. Chemosphere, 87(3), 248-252. doi:&lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2011.12.042&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Silver ions account for approximately 1% of total silver after silver nanoparticles are suspended in aerated water.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In anoxic wastewater treatment environments, silver ion release is therefore often negligible, and most of the silver nanoparticles in wastewater remain in the original silver nanoparticle form.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The presence of natural organic matter can also decrease oxidative dissolution rates and therefore the release rate of free silver ions.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The slow oxidation of silver nanoparticles may enable new pathways for its transfer into the environment.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Transformation in the environment ===
The silver nanoparticles that pass through wastewater treatment plants undergo transformations in the environment through changes in [[Particle aggregation|aggregation]] state, [[Redox|oxidation]] state, [[precipitation]] of secondary phases, or [[sorption]] of organic species.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Laglera L, Tovar-Sanchez A (2012). Direct recognition and quantification by volammetry of thiol/thioamide mixes in seawater. Talanta, 89: 496-504.&lt;/ref&gt; These transformations can result in the formation of [[Colloid|colloidal solutions]]. Each of these new species potentially have toxic effects which have yet to be fully examined.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Most silver nanoparticles in products have an organic shell structure around a core of Ag&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This shell is often created with carboxylic acids functional groups, usually using citrate, leading to stabilization through adsorption or covalent attachment of organic compounds.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In seawater, [[glutathione]] reacts with [[Citric acid|citrate]]&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; to form a [[thioester]] via [[ester]]ification.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Sidenius U, Skonberg C, Olsen J, Hansen S (2003). In vitro reactivity of carboxylic acid-CoA thioesters with glutathione. Chemical Research in Toxicology, 17: 75-81.&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Citrate_and_glutathione_reaction.png|thumb|Esterification reaction of citrate and glutathione]]

Thioesters exhibit electrosteric repulsive forces due to [[amine]] functional groups and their size, which prevents aggregation. These electrostatic repulsive forces are weakened by [[counterion]]s in solution, such as [[Ca²⁺|Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]] found in seawater. Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions are naturally found in seawater due to the weathering of [[Calcareous|calcareous rocks]], and allow for [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]] of the oxide-coated particle at low [[electrolyte]] concentrations.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;Li X, Lenhart J, Walker H (2010). Dissolution-Accompanied Aggregation Kinetics of Silver Nanoparticles. Langmuir, 26 (22): 16690-16698.&lt;/ref&gt; 

This leads to the aggregation of silver nanoparticles onto thioesters in seawater.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; When aggregation occurs, the silver nanoparticles lose microbial toxicity, but have greater exposure in the environment for larger organisms.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; These effects have not been completely identified, but may be hazardous to an organism’s health via biological magnification.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

On the surface where O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is present in much greater quantities than chloride or sulfur, silver reacts to form a silver oxide surface layer.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Choi O, Cleunger T, Deng B, Surampalli R, Ross L, Hu Z (2009).

Silver speciation in wastewater effluent, surface waters and pore waters. Environmental Toxicology Chemistry 18 (12): 2667-2673.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S is not the only source of sulfur that Ag will readily bind to. [[Organosulfur compounds]], which are produced by aquatic organisms, form extremely stable sulfide complexes with silver.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Silver outcompetes other metals for the available sulfide, leading to an overall decrease in bioavailable sulfur in the community.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Thus, the formation of Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S limits the amount of bioavailable sulfur and contributes to a reduction in toxicity of silver nanoparticles to [[nitrifying bacteria]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

==== Effect on bacteria ====
Silver nanoparticles are experimentally shown to inhibit [[autotroph]]ic nitrifying bacterial growth (86±3%) more than Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions (42±7%) or AgCl [[colloid]]s (46±4%).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Silver nanoparticle-inhibited [[heterotroph]]ic growth (55±8%) in ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' is best observed at lower concentrations, between 1.0 uM and 4.2 uM.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This is less than Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions (~100%), but greater than AgCl colloids (66±6%).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The actual cause of these results is undetermined as growth conditions and cell properties differ between nitrifying bacteria and [[heterotroph]]ic ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Within toothpaste, Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions have been shown to have a stronger effect on [[gram-negative bacteria]] than on [[gram-positive bacteria]].&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;Junevičius J, Žilinskas J, Česaitis K, Česaitienė G, Gleiznys D, Maželienė D (2015). Antimicrobial activity of silver and gold in toothpastes: A comparative analysis. Stomatologija, Baltic Dental and Maxillofacial Journal, 17 (1): 9-12.&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison to other nanoparticles, such as gold, silver tends to have a broader antimicrobial effect, which is another reason why it is incorporated into so many products.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is less effective on gram-positive bacteria due to the thick layer of peptidoglycan around them that gram-negative species lack.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Approximately half of the [[peptidoglycan]] wall is composed of [[teichoic acid]]s linked by [[phosphodiester bond]]s, which results in an overall negative charge in the peptidoglycan layer.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;Vollmer W, Blanot D, Pedro M (2007). Peptidoglycan structure and architecture. Federation of European Microbiological Societies, 32: 149-167.&lt;/ref&gt; This negative charge may trap the positive Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and prevent them from entering the cell and disrupting the flow of electrons.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

==== Toxicology in aquatic environments ====
The most environmentally relevant species of these nanoparticles are silver chloride within marine ecosystems and organic thiols within terrestrial ecosystems. Once Ag&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; enters the environment, it is oxidized to Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;Su-juan Y, Yong-guang Y, Jing-fu L (2013). Silver nanoparticles in the environment. Environmental Science, 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the potential species formed in seawater, such as Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S and [[Silver carbonate|Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], AgCl is the most thermodynamically favored due to its stability, solubility, and the abundance of Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; in seawater.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;  Research has shown that partially oxidized nanoparticles may be more toxic than those that are freshly prepared.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

It was also found that Ag dissolutes more in solution when the pH is low and [[bleaching]] has occurred.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; This effect, coupled with [[ocean acidification]] and increasing coral reef bleaching events, leads to a compounding effect of Ag accumulation in the global marine ecosystem.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; These free formed Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions can accumulate and block the regulation of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ion exchange within the gills of fish, leading to blood [[acidosis]] which is fatal if left unchecked. Additionally, fish can accumulate Ag through their diet. [[Phytoplankton]], which form the base level of aquatic food chains, can absorb and collect silver from their surroundings.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;Fabrega J, Luoma S, Tyler C, Galloway T, Lead J (2011). Silver nanoparticles: Behaviour and effects in the aquatic environment. Environment International, 37 (2): 517-531.&lt;/ref&gt; 

As fish eat phytoplankton, the silver accumulates within their circulatory system, which has been shown to negatively impact embryonic fish, causing spinal cord deformities and [[Heart arrhythmia|cardiac arrhythmia]].&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; The other class of organisms heavily affected by silver nanoparticles is [[Bivalvia|bivalves]].&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Filter feeding bivalves accumulate nanoparticles to concentrations 10,000 times greater than was added to seawater, and Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions are proven to be extremely toxic to them.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; 

The base of complex food webs consists of microbes, and these organisms are most heavily impacted by nanoparticles.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; These effects cascade into the problems that have now reached an observable scale.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;Lannig G, Eilers S, Pörtner H, Sokolova I and Bock C. (2010). Impact of Ocean Acidification on Energy Metabolism of Oyster, Crassostrea gigas — Changes in Metabolic Pathways and Thermal Response. Marine Drugs 8: 2318-2339.&lt;/ref&gt; As global temperatures rise and oceanic pH drops, some species, such as oysters, will be even more susceptible to the negative impacts of nanoparticles as they are stressed.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

[[Image:fmrockc.jpg|right|thumb|200px|An element of rock under stress]]

'''Fault mechanics''' is a field of study that investigates the behavior of [[geologic fault]]s.

Behind every good [[earthquake]] is some weak rock.  Whether the rock remains weak becomes an important point in determining the potential for bigger earthquakes.

On a small scale, fractured rock behaves essentially the same throughout the world, in that the [[angle of friction]] is more or less uniform (see [[Fault friction]]).  A small element of rock in a larger mass responds to [[stress (physics)|stress]] changes in a well defined manner:  if it is squeezed by differential stresses greater than its strength, it is capable of large deformations.  A band of weak, fractured rock in a competent mass can deform to resemble a classic [[geologic fault]].  Using [[seismometer]]s and [[earthquake location]], the requisite pattern of micro-earthquakes can be observed.

[[Image:fmcracks.jpg|Penny|left|thumb|200px|Penny-shape cracks in rock]]

For earthquakes, it all starts with an embedded [[penny]]-shaped crack as first envisioned by Brune.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1987/A1987J040600001.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  As illustrated, an earthquake zone may start as a single crack, growing to form many individual cracks and collections of cracks along a fault.  The key to fault growth is the concept of a "following force", as conveniently provided for [[interplate earthquake]]s, by the motion of tectonic plates.  Under a following force, the seismic displacements eventually form a topographic feature, such as a mountain range.

[[File:Fault mechanics creating a ridge.jpg|ridge|right|thumb|200px|Following forces forming a mountain range]]

[[Intraplate earthquakes]] do not have a following force, and are not associated with mountain building.  Thus, there is the puzzling question of how long any interior active zone has to live.  For, in a solid stressed plate, every seismic displacement acts to relieve (reduce) stress; the fault zone should come to equilibrium; and all seismic activity cease.  One can see this type of arching "lockup" in many natural processes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.exploratorium.edu/ronh/adventure/arches.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, the [[seismic zone]] (such as the [[New Madrid Fault Zone]]) is ensured eternal life by the action of water.  As shown, if we add the equivalent of a giant funnel to the crack, it becomes the beneficiary of stress corrosion (the progressive weakening of the crack edge by water).&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20051217222420/http://www.nire.go.jp/annual/1998/28.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  If there is a continuing supply of new water, the system does not come to equilibrium, but continues to grow, ever relieving stress from a larger and larger volume.

[[Image:fmwater.jpg|water|left|thumb|200px| Fresh water continually being injected]]

Thus the prerequisite for a continuing seismically active interior zone is the presence of water, the ability of the water to get down to the fault source (high [[Permeability (fluid)|permeability]]), and the usual high horizontal interior stresses of the rock mass.  All small earthquake zones have the potential to grow to resemble New Madrid or [[Charlevoix]].&lt;ref&gt;

'''Film preservation''', or '''film restoration''', describes a series of ongoing efforts among film historians, archivists, museums, [[cinematheque]]s, and [[non-profit organization]]s to rescue decaying [[film stock]] and preserve the images which they contain. In the widest sense, preservation nowadays assures that a movie will continue to exist in as close to its original form as possible.&lt;ref name="McGreevey, Tom 1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Yeck|first=Joanne L.|title=Our Movie Heritage|year=1997|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ [u.a.]|isbn=0813524318|author2=Tom McGreevey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years the term "preservation" was synonymous with "duplication" of film. The goal of a preservationist was to create a durable copy without any significant loss of [[image quality|quality]]. In more modern terms, film preservation now includes the concepts of handling, duplication, storage, and access. The archivist seeks to protect the film and share the content with the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Film Preservation Guide: The Basics for Archives, Libraries, and Museums|year=2004|publisher=National Film Preservation Foundation|location=[[San Francisco]]|isbn=0974709905|url=http://www.filmpreservation.org/preservation-basics/the-film-preservation-guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film preservation is not to be confused with film [[Revisionism (fictional)|revisionism]], in which long-completed films are subjected to [[outtake]]s never previously seen being inserted, newly inserted music scores or sound effects being added, black-and-white film being [[Film colorization|colorized]] or converted to [[Dolby]] stereo, or minor [[film editing|edits]] and other cosmetic changes being made.

By the 1980s, it was becoming apparent that the collections of motion picture heritage were at risk of becoming lost. Not only was the preservation of [[Nitrocellulose#Nitrate film|nitrate film]] an ongoing problem, but the discovery that safety film, used as a replacement for the more volatile nitrate stock, was beginning to be affected by a unique form of decay known as "[[Cellulose acetate film#Decay and the "vinegar syndrome"|vinegar syndrome]]", and color film manufactured, in particular, by [[Eastman Kodak]], was found to be at risk of fading. At that time, the best known solution was to duplicate the original film onto a more secure medium.

90 percent of all American [[silent films]] made before 1929 and 50 percent of American [[sound film]]s made before 1950 are [[lost films]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Dave Kehr|Kehr, Dave]]|title=Film Riches, Cleaned Up for Posterity |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/15/movies/15restore.html|quote=It’s bad enough, to cite a common estimate, that 90 percent of all American silent films and 50 percent of American sound films made before 1950 appear to have vanished forever.|work=[[New York Times]]|date=14 October 2010|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although institutional practices of film preservation date back to the 1930s,&lt;ref&gt;Houston, P. (1994). Keepers of the frame: the film archives. British Film Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; the field received an official status only in 1980, when UNESCO recognized "moving images" as an integral part of the world's cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13139&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html UNESCO, Recommendation for the Safeguarding and Preservation of Moving Images] at UNESCO.org, 27 October 1980.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Nitratedecomp.png|thumb|320px|An extreme example of nitrate decomposition.]] --&gt;
The great majority of films made in the [[silent film|silent]] era are now considered [[lost films|lost]] forever. Movies of the first half of the 20th century were filmed on an unstable, highly flammable [[Nitrocellulose|cellulose nitrate]] [[film base]], which required careful storage to slow its inevitable process of decomposition over time. Most films made on nitrate stock were not preserved; over the years, their negatives and prints crumbled into powder or dust. Many of them were recycled for their silver content, or destroyed in studio or vault fires. The largest cause, however, was intentional destruction. As film preservationist Robert A. Harris explains, "Most of the early films did not survive because of wholesale junking by the studios. There was no thought of ever saving these films. They simply needed vault space and the materials were expensive to house."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hart|first=Martin|title=Robert A. Harris Presentation on Film Preservation|url=http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/rah.htm|publisher=American WideScreen Museum|date=February 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Silent film]]s had little or no commercial value after the advent of sound films in the 1930s, and as such, they were not kept. As a result, preserving the now rare silent films has been a high priority amongst [[History of film|film historians]].

Because of the fragility of [[film stock]], proper preservation of film usually involves storing the original negatives (if they have survived) and prints in climate-controlled facilities. The vast majority of films were not stored in this manner, which resulted in the widespread decay of film stocks.

The problem of film decay is not limited to films made on [[Nitrocellulose|cellulose nitrate]]. Film industry researchers and specialists have found that color films (those made in the processes which replaced [[Technicolor]]) are also decaying at an increasingly rapid rate. A number of well-known films only exist as copies of original [[film production]]s or exhibition elements because the originals have decomposed beyond use. [[Cellulose acetate film]], which was the initial replacement for nitrate, has been found to suffer from "[[Cellulose acetate film#Decay and the "vinegar syndrome"|vinegar syndrome]]". The ongoing preservation of color films is now presented with an issue, as low temperatures, which inhibit color fading, actually increase the effects of vinegar syndrome, while higher (normal room) temperatures cause color fading.{{dubious | August 2018 |reason=Vinegar syndrome article says the opposite.|date=August 2018}}{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Film decay as an art form===
In 2002, filmmaker [[Bill Morrison (director)|Bill Morrison]] produced ''[[Decasia]]'', a film solely based on fragments of old unrestored nitrate-based films in various states of decay and disrepair, providing a somewhat eerie aesthetic to the film. The film was paired together with a soundtrack composed by [[Michael Gordon (composer)|Michael Gordon]], and performed by his orchestra.  The footage used was from old newsreel &amp; archive film, and was obtained by Morrison from several sources, such as the [http://www.sc.edu/library/newsfilm/ Fox Movietone Newsfilm Archives] at the [[University of South Carolina]], and the archives of the [[Museum of Modern Art]].

==Preservation through careful storage==
[[File:PackardHumanities Institute, Santa Clarita.jpg|thumb|right|[[Packard Humanities Institute]], Santa Clarita, [[Nitrate film]] Film Vault]]
The "preservation" of film usually refers to physical storage of the film in a [[HVAC|climate-controlled]] vault, and sometimes to the actual repair and copying of the film element. Preservation is different from "restoration", as restoration is the act of returning the film to a version most faithful to its initial release to the public and often involves combining various fragments of film elements.

Film is best preserved by proper protection from external forces while in storage along with being under controlled temperatures.&lt;ref name="McGreevey, Tom 1997"/&gt; For most film materials, the [[Image Permanence Institute]] finds that storing film media in frozen temperatures, with RH between 30% and 50%, greatly extends its useful life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Film Preservation Guide: The Basics for Archives, Libraries, and Museums|last=|first=|publisher=The National Film Preservation Foundation|year=2004|isbn=0974709905|location=|pages=61|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These measures inhibit deterioration better than any other methods and is a cheaper solution than replicating deteriorating films.

==Preparing a film for preservation and restoration==

In most cases, when a film is chosen for preservation or restoration work, new prints are created from the [[original camera negative]] or the ''composite restoration negative'' which is often made from a combination of elements for general screening.

The composite restoration negative is a compilation of duplicated sections of the best remaining material, recombined to approximate the original configuration of the original camera negative at some time in the film's release cycle, while the [[original camera negative]] is the remaining, edited, film negative that passed through the camera on the set. This original camera negative may, or may not, remain in original release form, depending upon number of subsequent re-releases after the initial release for theatrical exhibition.

In traditional photochemical restorations, image polarity considerations must be observed when recombining surviving materials and the final, lowest generation restoration master may be either a duplicate negative or a [[fine grain master positive]].

Preservation elements, such as fine-grain master positives and duplicate printing negatives, are generated from this restoration master element to make both duplication masters and access projection prints available for future generations.

==Film as archival medium==

Film preservationists would prefer that the film images, whether restored through photochemical or digital processes, be eventually transferred to other film stock, because no digital media exists that has proven truly archival because of rapidly evolving and shifting data formats, while a well-developed and stored, modern film print can last upwards of 100 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://twitchfilm.com/2012/09/jason-gorbers-cineruminations-70mm-4k-and-the-master-split-personality.html |title=twitchfilm.com. Jason Gorber's Cineruminations: 70mm, 4K, and THE MASTER's Split Personality Jason Gorber |access-date=2014-04-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140217215841/http://twitchfilm.com/2012/09/jason-gorbers-cineruminations-70mm-4k-and-the-master-split-personality.html |archive-date=2014-02-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While some in the archival community feel that conversion from film to a digital image results in a loss of quality that can make it more difficult to create a high-quality print based upon the digital image, digital imaging technology has become increasingly advanced to the point where 8K scanners can capture the full resolution of images filmed at as high as 65mm.&lt;ref name="postmagazine.com"&gt;[http://www.postmagazine.com/Publications/Post-Magazine/2012/November-1-2012/Sound-Picture-Restoration.aspx postmagazine.com, Issue: November 1, 2012, Sound &amp; Picture Restoration, By: Christine Bunish]&lt;/ref&gt; 70mm IMAX has a resolution of 18K, which is the upper necessary limit for film capture in full resolution.&lt;ref&gt;[[Image resolution]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Of course, having an intermediate digital stage, followed by forming a new film master by lasering the digital results onto new film stock does represent an extra generation. So would an intermediate film master that was restored frame-by-frame by hand. The choice of film vs. digital restoration will be driven by the amount, if any, of restoration required, the taste and skill set of the restorer, and the economics of film restoration vs. digital restoration.

==Digital as archival medium==

Digital scanners {{as of|2014|lc=y}} can capture images as large as 65mm in full resolution.&lt;ref name="postmagazine.com"/&gt; That is the typical image size on a traditional (as opposed to the IMAX process) 70mm film which used a portion of the film surface for its multitrack magnetic sound stripe. A 70mm print of a two and a half hour film {{as of|2012|lc=y}} ran upwards of $170,000. A hard disk capable of storing such a movie is a few hundred dollars. An archival optical disk will be less. The problem of having to transfer the data as new generations of equipment come along will continue, however, until true archival standards are put in place.

==Digital film preservation==

In the context of film preservation the term "[[digital preservation]]" highlights the use of digital technology for the transfer of films from 8mm to 70mm in size to digital [[digital media|carriers]], as well as all practices for ensuring the longevity and access to [[Digitizing|digitized]] or [[Born-digital|digitally born]] film materials. On purely technical and practical terms, digital film preservation stands for a domain specific subset of [[digital curation]] practices. Extensive technical literature on the subject can be found at the online library of the Presto Centre Project.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.prestocentre.org/ Presto Centre Project web site]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[aesthetic]] and [[ethical]] implications of the use of digital technology for film preservation are major subjects of debate. For instance, the senior curator of [[George Eastman House]] Paolo Cherchi Usai has decried the shift from analogue to digital preservation of film as ethically unacceptable, arguing, on philosophical terms, that the medium of film is an essential ontological precondition for the existence of cinema.&lt;ref&gt;Usai, Paolo Cherchi (2001) "The death of cinema: history, cultural memory and the digital dark age" British Film Institute&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the senior curator of [[EYE Film Institute Netherlands]] Giovanna Fossati has discussed the use of digital technologies for the restoration and preservation of film in a more optimistic way as a form of [[Remediation (Marxist theory)|remediation]] of the cinematic medium, and has positively reflected on digital technologies' ability to broaden restoration possibilities, improve quality, and reduce costs.&lt;ref&gt;Fossati, Giovanna (2009) "From grain to pixel: the archival life of film in transition." Amsterdam University Press&lt;/ref&gt; According to the cinema scholar Leo Enticknap, the views held by Usai and Fossati could be seen as representative of the two poles of the digital debate in film preservation.&lt;ref&gt;Enticknap, Leo (2012). "Dossier: Materiality and the Archive." The Velvet Light Trap, (70), 63-64&lt;/ref&gt; It should be kept in mind, however, that both Usai and Fossati's arguments are highly complex and nuanced, and likewise, the debate about the utility of digital technologies in film preservation is complex and continually evolving.

==Advancements==
In 1935, New York's [[Museum of Modern Art]] began one of the earliest institutional attempts to collect and preserve motion pictures, obtaining original negatives of the [[American Mutoscope and Biograph Company|Biograph]] and Edison companies, and the world's largest collection of [[D. W. Griffith]] films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MoMA.org {{!}} The Collection {{!}} Film and Media |url=http://www.moma.org/collection/depts/film_media/ |work=[[The Museum of Modern Art]] |accessdate=23 June 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207232551/http://www.moma.org/collection/depts/film_media/ |archivedate=February 7, 2006 |deadurl=unfit }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, [[Henri Langlois]] founded the [[Cinémathèque Française]] in Paris, which would become the world's largest international film collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cinematheque.fr/data/document/expositionpermanente.pdf |title=Passion Cinéma |access-date=2006-05-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060627162200/http://www.cinematheque.fr/data/document/expositionpermanente.pdf |archive-date=2006-06-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For thousands of early silent films stored in the [[Library of Congress]], mostly between 1894 and 1912, the only existing copies were printed on [[paper print|rolls of paper]] submitted as copyright registrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/mopic/earlymps.html#pape |title=Early Motion Pictures Free of Copyright Restrictions in the Library of Congress |publisher=Library of Congress |date=31 August 2010|accessdate=14 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For these, an [[optical printer]] was used to copy these images onto safety film stock, a project that began in 1947 and continues today.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The Library hosts the National Film Preservation Board, whose National Film Registry annually selects 25 U.S. films "showcasing the range and diversity of American film heritage."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/about-this-program Library of Congress-LOC Film preservation]&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[George Eastman House International Museum of Photography and Film]] was chartered in 1947 to collect, preserve and present the history of photography and film, and in 1996 opened the Louis B. Mayer Conservation Center, one of only four film conservation centers in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eastmanhouse.org/inc/the_museum/history.php |title=Museum History · George Eastman House |publisher=Eastmanhouse.org |accessdate=14 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006120017/http://eastmanhouse.org/inc/the_museum/history.php |archivedate=October 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Film Institute]] was founded in 1967 to train the next generation of filmmakers and preserve the American film heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=American Film Institute|url=http://www.afi.com/about/history.aspx|title=History of AFI|publisher=Afi.com|accessdate=14 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its collection now includes over 27,500 titles.

In 1978, [[Dawson City]], [[Yukon Territory]], Canada, a construction excavation inadvertently found a forgotten collection of more than 500 discarded films from the early 20th century that were buried in and preserved in the [[permafrost]].&lt;ref&gt;Kula, S. (1979). Rescued from the Permafrost: The Dawson Collection of Motion Pictures. ''Archivaria,'' No. 8, Summer 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;  This fortunate discovery was shared and moved to the United States' [[Library of Congress]]&lt;ref&gt;Shepard, R. (1990, Sept. 3). Expanding Archives: Library of Congress Is Not Just Books. ''The New York Times.''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Library and Archives Canada]] for transfer to safety stock and archiving.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/about-us/preservation/Pages/preservation.aspx The Library and Archives Canada Preservation Centre]&lt;/ref&gt; However, to move such highly flammable material such a distance ultimately required assistance from the [[Canadian Armed Forces]] to make the delivery to [[Ottawa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morrison|first1=Bill|title=Dawson City: Frozen Time|date=2016|publisher=KinoLorber|page=1:53:45|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story of this discovery as well as excerpts of these films can be seen in the 2016 [[documentary film]], ''[[Dawson City: Frozen Time]]''.

Another high-profile restoration by staff at the [[British Film Institute]]'s [[National Film and Television Archive]] is the [[Mitchell and Kenyon]] collection, which consists almost entirely of [[actuality film]]s commissioned by traveling fairground operators for showing at local fairgrounds or other venues across the UK in the early part of the twentieth century. The collection was stored for many decades in two large barrels following the winding-up of the firm, and was discovered in [[Blackburn]] in the early 1990s. The restored films now offer a unique social record of early 20th-century British life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bfi.org.uk/archive-collections/about-bfi-national-archive About the BFI National Archive] at British Film Institute official web site&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual preservationists who have contributed to the cause include [[Robert A. Harris]] and [[James Katz]] (''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'', ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]'', and several [[Alfred Hitchcock]] films), Michael Thau (''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]''), and [[Kevin Brownlow]] (''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]'' and ''[[Napoléon (1927 film)|Napoleon]]'').  Other organizations, such as the [[UCLA Film and Television Archive]], have also preserved and restored films; a major part of UCLA's work includes such projects as ''[[Becky Sharp (film)|Becky Sharp]]'' and select [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]/[[Famous Studios]] and [[Warner Bros.]] cartoons whose credits were once altered due to rights taken over by different entities.

==Studio efforts==
In 1926 [[Will H. Hays|Will Hays]] asked for [[film studio]]s to preserve their films by storing them at 40 degrees at low humidity in an [[Eastman Kodak]] process, so that "schoolboys in the year 3,000 and 4,000 A.D. may learn about us".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnston|first=Alva| authorlink = Alva Johnston|title=Films Put on Ice for Fans yet Unborn|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=24 October 1926|quote=Will Hays has sent a call to the motion-picture companies to search their vaults for ancient films of all kinds and for news reels of possible historic interest. The most important of these are to be treated by a process developed in the Eastman laboratories for making films immortal.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 1970s, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], aware that the original negatives to many of its Golden Age films had been destroyed in a fire, began a preservation program to restore and preserve all of its films by using whatever negatives survived, or, in many cases, the next best available elements (whether it be a fine-grain master positive or mint archival print). From the onset, it was determined that if some films had to be preserved, then it would have to be ''all'' of them.  In 1986, when [[Ted Turner]] acquired MGM's library (which by then had included [[Warner Bros.]]' pre-1950,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schickel|first=Richard| authorlink = Richard Schickel|title=You Must Remember This: The Warner Bros. Story|year=2008|publisher=Running Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=076243418X|author2=Perry, George}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Warner Bros. retained a pair of features from 1949 that they merely distributed, and all short subjects released on or after September 1, 1948, in addition to all cartoons released in August 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; MGM's pre-May 1986, and a majority of the [[RKO Radio Pictures]] catalogs), he vowed to continue the preservation work MGM had started. [[Time Warner]], the current owner of [[Turner Entertainment]], continues this work today.

The cause for film preservation came to the forefront in the 1980s and early 1990s when such famous and influential film directors as [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[Martin Scorsese]] contributed to the cause. Spielberg became interested in film preservation when he went to view the master of his film ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]],'' only to find that it had badly decomposed and deteriorated—a mere fifteen years after it had been filmed. Scorsese drew attention to the film industry's use of color-fading film stock through his use of black-and-white film stock in his 1980 film ''[[Raging Bull]]''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}  His film, ''[[Hugo (film)|Hugo]]'' included a key scene in which many of film pioneer [[Georges Méliès]]' silent films are melted down and the raw material recycled as shoes; this was seen by many movie critics as "a passionate brief for film preservation wrapped in a fanciful tale of childhood intrigue and adventure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McCarthy|first=Todd| authorlink =Todd McCarthy|title=Hugo: Film Review |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movie/hugo/review/263209|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=23 June 2013|date=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scorsese's concern about the need to save motion pictures of the past led him to create [[The Film Foundation]], a non-profit organization dedicated to film preservation, in 1990. He was joined in this effort by fellow film makers who served on the foundation's board of directors—[[Woody Allen]], [[Robert Altman]], [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[Clint Eastwood]], [[Stanley Kubrick]], [[George Lucas]], [[Sydney Pollack]], [[Robert Redford]], and [[Steven Spielberg]]. In 2006, [[Paul Thomas Anderson]], [[Wes Anderson]], [[Curtis Hanson]], [[Peter Jackson]], [[Ang Lee]], and [[Alexander Payne]] were added to the board of directors of The Film Foundation, which is aligned with the [[Directors Guild of America]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

By working in partnership with the leading film archives and studios, The Film Foundation has saved nearly 600 films, often restoring them to pristine condition. In many cases, original footage that had been excised—or [[censorship|censored]] by the [[Production Code]] in the U.S.—from the original negative, has been reinstated. In addition to the preservation, restoration, and presentation of classic cinema, the foundation teaches young people about film language and history through ''The Story of Movies'', an educational program claimed to be "used by over 100,000 educators nationwide".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.storyofmovies.org/common/11041/aboutFoundation.cfm?clientID=11041 About the Foundation] at storyofmovies.org&lt;/ref&gt;

In the age of [[digital television]], [[high definition television]] and [[DVD]], film preservation and restoration has taken on commercial as well as historical importance, since audiences demand the highest possible picture quality from digital formats.  Meanwhile, the dominance of [[home video]] and ever-present need for [[television broadcasting]] content, especially on [[specialty channel]]s, has meant that films have proven a source of long-term revenue to a degree that the original artists and studio management before the rise of these media never imagined. Thus media companies have a strong financial incentive to carefully archive and preserve their complete library of films.

==Video Aids to Film Preservation==
The group Video Aids to Film Preservation (VAFP) became active on the Internet in 2005.

The VAFP site was funded as part of a 2005 [[Institute of Museum and Library Services]] (IMLS) grant to the [[Folkstreams]] project. The purpose of the site is to supplement already existing film preservation guides provided by the [[National Film Preservation Foundation]] with video demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Video Aids to Film Preservation|url=http://www.folkstreams.net/vafp/#content|work=Folkstreams|accessdate=23 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The preservation guides provided by the origination, while thoroughly depicting accurate methods of preservation, are mostly text-based. The films and clips are copyrighted under the [[Creative Commons]] license, which allows anyone to use these clips with attribution—in this case, attribution to the VAFP site and to the author of the clip and his company.

==Obstacles in restoration==
Regardless of the age of the print itself, damage may occur if stored improperly. Damage to the film (caused by tears on the print, curling of the film base due to intense light exposure, temperature, humidity, etc.) all significantly raise the difficulty of the preservation process. Many films simply do not have enough information left on the film to piece together a new master, although careful digital restoration can produce stunning results by gathering bits and pieces of buildings from adjacent frames for restoration on a damaged frame, predicting entire frames based on the characters' movements in prior and subsequent frames, etc. As time goes on, this digital capability will only improve, but it will ultimately require sufficient information from the original film to make proper restorations and predictions.

Cost is another obstacle. In 2014, Martin Scorsese's non-profit The Film Foundation, dedicated to film presentation, estimated the average cost of photochemical restoration of a color feature with sound at $50,000 to $100,000 dollars, with digital 2K or 4K restoration at "several hundred thousand dollars."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.film-foundation.org film-foundation.org FAQ http://www.film-foundation.org/faq]&lt;/ref&gt; The degree of physical and chemical damage of film influences the incentive to preserve, i.e. as the business perspective states that once a film is no longer "commercially" viable, it stops generating profit and becomes a financial liability. While few films would not benefit from digital restoration, the high cost of restoring films digitally still prevents the method from being as broadly applied as it might be.

Demand for new media, digital cinema, and constantly-evolving consumer digital formats keeps evolving and shifting. Film restoration facilities must keep pace to maintain audience acceptance. Classic films today must be in near-mint condition if they are to be reshown or resold, with the demand for perfection only rising as theaters move from 2K to 4K projection and consumer media continues its shift from SD to HD to UltraHD and beyond.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Digital restoration steps==

Once a film is inspected and cleaned it is transferred via [[telecine]] or a [[motion picture film scanner]] to a [[magnetic tape data storage|digital tape]] or [[hard disk drive|disk]], and the audio is synced to create a new [[audio mastering|master]].

The main defects needing restoration:
* Dirt/dust
* Scratches, tears/[[movie projector#Light source|burned frames]]
* Color fade, color change
* Excessive [[film grain]] (a copy of an existing film has all of the film grain from the original as well as the film grain in the copy)
* Missing scenes and sound (censored or edited out for re-release)
* Shrinkage&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Linear and "across the web" (width), as well as localized puckering around large (1 to 2) perforation film cement splices, most common in silent and very early sound films. Highly shrunken film (1.5% or higher), must be copied on modified equipment or the film will most likely be damaged. In the case of inflammable nitrate film, this could prove to be dangerous, as the film can jam in the duplicator and become idle. Some methods of duplication have illumination sources with enough heat to ignite the film if exposed to the light source for a long period of time.&lt;/ref&gt;
Modern, digital film restoration takes the following steps:
&lt;ol type+"1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expertly clean the film of dirt and dust.
&lt;li&gt;Repair all film tears with clear polyester tape or splicing cement.
&lt;li&gt;Scan each frame into a digital file.
&lt;li&gt;Restore the film frame by frame by comparing each frame to adjacent frames. This can be done somewhat by computer algorithms with human checking of the result.
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fix frame alignment ("jitter" and "weave"), or the misalignment of adjacent film frames due to movement of film within the sprockets. This corrects the issue where the holes on each side of a frame are distorted over time. This causes frames to slightly be off center.
&lt;li&gt;Fix color and lighting changes. This corrects flickering and slight color changes from one frame to another due to aging of the film.
&lt;li&gt;Restore areas blocked by dirt and dust by using parts of images in other frames.
&lt;li&gt;Restore scratches by using parts of images in other frames.
&lt;li&gt;Enhance frames by reducing film grain noise. Film foreground/background detail about the same size as the film grain or smaller is blurred or lost in making the film. Comparing a frame with adjacent frames allows detail information to be reconstructed since a given small detail may be split between more film grains from one frame to another.
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

== Photochemical restoration steps ==

Modern, photochemical restoration follows roughly the same path as digital:
# Extensive research is done to determine what version of the film can be restored from the existing material. Often, extensive efforts are taken to search out alternative material in film archives located around the world.
# A comprehensive restoration plan is mapped that allows preservationists to designate elements as "key" elements upon which to base the polarity map for the ensuing photochemical work. Since many alternative elements are actually salvaged from release prints and duplication masters (foreign and domestic). Care must be taken to plot the course at which negative, master positive and release print elements arrive back at a common polarity (i.e., negative or positive) for assembly and subsequent printing.
# Test prints are struck from existing elements to evaluate contrast, resolution, color (if color) and sound quality (if audio element exists).
# Elements are duplicated using the shortest possible duplication path to minimize analog [[generation loss|duplication artifacts]], such as the build-up of contrast, grain and loss of resolution.
# All sources are assembled into a single master restoration element (most often a duplicate negative).
# From this master restoration element, duplication masters, such as composite fine grain masters, are generated to be used to generate additional printing negatives from which actual release prints can be struck for festival screenings and DVD mastering.
&lt;!-- (This paragraph is practically commentary, please reword to meet Wikipedia standards or remove altogether.)
Another important issue presented is that films of the nineteenth century are deteriorating. Negating internal processes, external factors such as wars and floods could destroy these collections permanently. The argument presented is that if films can be restored and made accessible for public consumption, then active efforts to take advantage of this extraordinary invention should continue. The fact is that at the risk of sounding technology determinist, there will be a solution to the preservation of film and digital format. Cyberspace is developing exponentially one must place it in the context where it is constant to changes in society. For every different medium there has been an exposure of meeting the demands of the audience. If the demands of the audience are to be met then surely a backup of this success is needed and will be sought i.e. an appropriate storage medium. In the next century, film archives may not exist.--&gt;

==Education==

The practice of film preservation is more craft than science. Until the early 1990s there were no dedicated academic programs in film preservation. Practitioners had often entered the field through related education (e.g. library or archival science), related technical experience (e.g. film lab work), or driven by sheer passion for working with film.&lt;ref&gt;Lukow, Gregory. [http://www.amianet.org/sites/all/files/ed_training_careers.pdf "Education Training and Careers in Moving Image Preservation"]. (AMIA, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last two decades universities globally began offering graduate degrees in film preservation and film archiving, which are often taught conjointly (the latter focusing more on skills related to the description, cataloguing, indexing and broadly speaking management of film and media collections).

The recent years rapid incursion of digital technologies in the field has somewhat redefined the vocational scope of film preservation. In response, the majority of graduate programs in film preservation have begun offering courses on digital film preservation and digital film and media collection management.

'''Food engineering''' is a multidisciplinary field which combines [[Food microbiology|microbiology]], applied [[physical sciences]], [[chemistry]] and engineering for food and related industries.  Food engineering includes, but is not limited to, the application of [[agricultural engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]] and [[chemical engineering]] principles to food materials. Food engineers provide the technological knowledge transfer essential to the [[cost-effective]] production and [[commercialization]] of food products and services. Physics, chemistry, and mathematics are fundamental to understanding and engineering products and operations in the [[food industry]].&lt;ref name="intro"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0123985307 | title=Introduction to Food Engineering (5th ed.) | publisher=Academic Press |author1=Singh , R Paul |author2=Dennis R. Heldman | year=2013 | pages=1 | isbn=978-0123985309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Food engineering encompasses a wide range of activities. Food engineers are employed in food processing, food machinery, [[packaging]], [[ingredient]] manufacturing, instrumentation, and control. Firms that design and build food processing plants, consulting firms, government agencies, [[pharmaceutical]] companies, and [[health-care]] firms also employ food engineers. Specific food engineering activities include:

*  drug/food products;
* design and installation of food/biological/pharmaceutical production processes;
* design and operation of environmentally responsible waste treatment systems;
* marketing and technical support for manufacturing plants.

==Topics==
In the development of food engineering, one of the many challenges is to employ modern tools, technology, and knowledge, such as computational materials science and [[nanotechnology]], to develop new products and processes. Simultaneously, improving quality, safety, and security remain critical issues in food engineering study. New packaging materials and techniques are being developed to provide more protection to foods, and novel preservation technology is emerging. Additionally, [[process control]] and [[process automation|automation]] regularly appear among the top priorities identified in food engineering. Advanced monitoring and control systems are developed to facilitate automation and flexible food manufacturing. Furthermore, [[energy saving]] and minimization of environmental problems continue to be important food engineering issues, and significant progress is being made in [[waste management]], efficient utilization of energy, and reduction of effluents and emissions in food production.

Typical topics include:food people
* Advances in classical unit operations in engineering applied to food manufacturing
* Progresses in the transport and [[Food storage|storage]] of liquid and solid foods
* Developments in heating, chilling and [[frozen foode|freezing]] of foods
* Advanced mass transfer in foods
* New chemical and biochemical aspects of food engineering and the use of kinetic analysis
* New techniques in dehydration, thermal processing, non-thermal processing, [[Food extrusion|extrusion]], liquid food concentration, membrane processes and applications of membranes in food processing
* Shelf-life, electronic indicators in [[inventory management]], and sustainable technologies in food processing
* Modern [[Food packaging|packaging]], cleaning, and sanitation technologies.
* Development of sensors systems for quality &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=García|first1=MR|last2=Cabo|first2=ML|last3=Herrera|first3=JR|last4=Ramilo-Fernández|first4=G|last5=Alonso|first5=AA|last6=Balsa-Canto|first6=E|title=Smart sensor to predict retail fresh fish quality under ice storage.|journal=Journal of Food Engineering|date=March 2017|volume=197|pages=87–97|doi=10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2016.11.006|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309897138|hdl=10261/141204}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=García|first1=MR|last2=Vilas|first2=C|last3=Herrera|first3=JR|last4=Bernárdez|first4=M|last5=Balsa-Canto|first5=E|last6=Alonso|first6=AA|title=Quality and shelf-life prediction for retail fresh hake (Merluccius merluccius).|journal=International Journal of Food Microbiology|date=2 September 2015|volume=208|pages=65–74|pmid=26058006|doi=10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2015.05.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and safety assessment &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mabrook|first1=M.F.|last2=Petty|first2=M.C.|title=Effect of composition on the electrical conductance of milk|journal=Journal of Food Engineering|date=2003|volume=60|issue=3|pages=321–325|doi=10.1016/S0260-8774(03)00054-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Damez|first1=J.L.|last2=Clerion|first2=S.|last3=Abouelkaram|first3=S.|last4=Lepetit|first4=J.|title=Beef meat electrical impedance spectroscopy and anisotropy sensing for non-invasive early assessment of meat ageing|journal=Journal of Food Engineering|date=2008|volume=85|issue=1|pages=116–122|doi=10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2007.07.026}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rehman|first1=M.|last2=Abu Izneid|first2=J.A.|last3=Abdullha|first3=M.Z.|last4=Arshad|first4=M.R.|title=Assessment of quality of fruits using impedance spectroscopy|journal=International Journal of Food Science &amp; Technology|date=2011|volume=46|issue=6|pages=1303–1309|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2621.2011.02636.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harker|first1=F.R.|last2=Forbes|first2=S.K.|title=Ripening and development of chilling injury in persimmon fruit: An electrical impedance study|journal=New Zealand Journal of Crop and Horticultural Science|date=1997|volume=25|issue=2|pages=149–157|doi=10.1080/01140671.1997.9514001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6756">In [[live sound mixing]], '''gain before feedback''' ('''GBF''') is a practical measure of how much a [[microphone]] can be amplified in a [[sound reinforcement system]] before causing [[audio feedback]]. In [[audiology]], GBF is a measure of [[hearing aid]] performance. In both fields the amount of [[gain (electronics)|gain]] is measured in [[decibel]]s at or just below the point at which the sound from the [[speaker driver]] re-enters the microphone and the system begins to ring or feed back. '''Potential acoustic gain''' ('''PAG''') is a calculated figure representing gain that a system can support without feeding back.&lt;ref name=Shure2007&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shure.com/idc/groups/public/documents/webcontent/us_pro_mics_for_music_sound_ea.pdf |title=Microphone Techniques: Live Sound Reinforcement |publisher=[[Shure]] |work=Shure Educational Publication |page=36 |date=December 2007 |accessdate=May 2, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303041801/http://www.shure.com/idc/groups/public/documents/webcontent/us_pro_mics_for_music_sound_ea.pdf |archivedate=March 3, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Live sound==
In live sound mixing, GBF is dependent on a wide variety of conditions: the pickup pattern (polar pattern) of the microphone, the frequency response of the microphone and of the rest of the sound system, the number of active microphones and loudspeakers, the acoustic conditions of the environment including reverberation and echo, and the relative positions of the microphones, the loudspeakers, the sound sources and the audience. Each doubling of the number of open microphones (NOM) reduces the PAG by 3&amp;nbsp;dB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shurenotes.com/how34/article.html |title=How-to: Miking Acoustic Instruments |quote=Every time the number of microphones doubles, the Potential Acoustic Gain of the sound system decreases by 3&amp;nbsp;dB. |publisher=[[Shure]] |work=Shure Notes for Houses of Worship |number=34 |accessdate=May 2, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722025212/http://www.shurenotes.com/how34/article.html |archivedate=July 22, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Directional microphones are used in live sound to maximize GBF. Directional microphones with [[Cardioid microphone|cardioid]] and hypercardioid pickup patterns are designed with reduced sensitivity to the rear (cardioid) or to an angle between the side and the rear (hypercardioid).&lt;ref name=Shure2007/&gt; Such microphones are aimed such that their pickup pattern is weakest in the direction of the loudspeakers. This is especially useful in the presence of [[Foldback (sound engineering)|foldback monitors]] (stage wedges). Directional loudspeaker systems may also be used to increase GBF.&lt;ref name=HyperPhysicsPAG&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/audio/pagi.html |title=Increasing Potential Acoustic Gain |last=Nave |first=Carl R. "Rod" |publisher=[[Georgia State University]] |work=HyperPhysics |accessdate=May 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=Gary D. Davis, Ralph Jones, Yamaha International Corporation |title=The sound reinforcement handbook |page=52 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d7ft6F8ZUdcC&amp;pg=PA52 |publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation |year=1989 |isbn=0-88188-900-8 |edition=2 |series=Recording and Audio Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The distance from the sound source to the microphone is a critical element of GBF. Greater GBF is obtained with the performer closer to the microphone; an instance of the [[inverse-square law]]. If the performer reduces the distance to the microphone by half, the PAG is increased by 6&amp;nbsp;dB while the environmental sounds remain relatively the same.&lt;ref name=HyperPhysicsPAG/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shure2007/&gt;

The sound system operator can use [[Equalization (audio)|equalization]] to change the frequency response of a microphone or loudspeakers system to increase GBF. The frequency which first begins ringing or feeding back is identified by the operator, and a [[notch filter]] or [[parametric filter]] is engaged to reduce the overall level of that frequency.&lt;ref name=HyperPhysicsPAG/&gt; This process is repeated several times to identify and reduce the level of further feedback frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prosoundweb.com/article/lose_the_feedback_improving_gain_before_feedback_in_worship/P1/ |title=Lose The Feedback: Improving Gain Before Feedback in Worship |last=Hargraves |first=Kent |date=April 28, 2011 |work=StudyHall |publisher=ProSoundWeb |accessdate=May 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[graphic equalizer]] can be used for the same purpose but with somewhat less precision. Automatic [[feedback suppressor]]s automate and speed the process of identifying and reducing feedback frequencies.&lt;ref name=Rane2005&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rane.com/note158.html |title=Understanding Acoustic Feedback &amp; Suppressors |publisher=[[Rane Corporation]] |work=RaneNote |number=158 |last=Troxel |first=Dana |date=October 2005 |accessdate=May 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small amount of [[pitch shift]] applied to the signal can increase GBF, as can the addition of a few milliseconds of [[straight delay]]. The latter will increase the number of feedback frequencies while reducing the frequency range within which they occur, but it will slow the rate at which feedback grows. In practice, adding straight delay to a signal improves GBF.&lt;ref name=Rane2005/&gt;

==Hearing aid==
A hearing aid incorporates a miniature microphone and a very small speaker driver, and various conditions may increase or decrease the amount of gain that can be applied to the microphone [[audio signal|signal]] before the system feeds back. A well-fitted hearing aid has more GBF than one that is loose. The shape of the [[earmold]] is a factor, with larger and heavier designs capable of delivering greater GBF. Hearing aid designs deliver gain in increasing steps depending on the severity of the patient's hearing loss; the range spans from 10&amp;nbsp;dB to 65&amp;nbsp;dB of gain. To prevent feedback with the highest amounts of gain, such designs require the tightest-fitting earmolds with no venting, and the deepest penetration of the [[ear canal]] to place the speaker driver as close as practical to the [[eardrum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7mSTZtvMckkC&amp;pg=PA243 |pages=242–243 |last=Valente |first=Michael |title=Hearing aids: standards, options, and limitations |publisher=Thieme |year=2002 |edition=2 |isbn=1-58890-103-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kendo]] originated in Japan, but is today practiced worldwide.

The size and depth of kendo skill varies widely from country to country. Some countries have few kendo practitioners, while Japan has several million.

Generally, kendo has stronger traditions in countries with strong historical ties to Japan, like [[Korea]] and [[Taiwan]], as well as countries with large Japanese immigrant communities such as the United States, Canada and [[Brazil]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} While the term kendo is used all over the world, the term [[Kumdo]] is used in Korea.

==International Organisations==

The following international organisations administer, manage, promote, or have an interest in the development of [[kendo]].

*The [[International Kendo Federation]] (FIK) is the international federation of most national and regional kendo organisations. The FIK was established in 1970 to provide a link between the [[All Japan Kendo Federation]] and the developing international kendo community. Seventeen national or regional federations were the founding affiliates. The number of affiliated and recognised organisations has increased over the years to 57 (as of May 2015)2.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kendo-fik.org/ International Kendo Federation (FIK)]&lt;/ref&gt;

:FIK affiliated national and regional kendo organisations are listed on the FIK [http://www.kendo-fik.org/english-page/english-page2/IKF-affiliates/IKF-affiliates.htm website].

:The FIK has conducted the [[World Kendo Championship]]s, every three years since it was established. The international competition is contested by individual and team representatives of the FIK affiliates.

*[[Dai Nippon Butoku Kai]] (DNBK) was established in [[Kyoto]], Japan, in 1953, .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnbk.org/history.cfm Dai Nippon Butoku Kai (DNBK)]&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the new axiom of DNBK stresses preservation of classical martial arts tradition and the promotion of education and community service through martial arts training.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnbk.org/history.cfm Dai Nippon Butoku Kai (DNBK) History]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[International Martial Arts Federation]] (IMAF) was established in Kyoto, Japan, in 1952. Among the objectives of IMAF are the expansion of interest in Japanese martial arts, the establishment of communication, friendship, understanding and harmony among member chapters, the development of the minds and bodies of members, and the promotion of global understanding and personal growth.
*[[Zen Nihon Sōgō-Budō Renmei]] (ZNSBR) The organization known as the Zen Nihon Sōgō-Budō Renmei (All Japan [Comprehensive] Budō Federation or SōBuRen) has as its mission the preservation of all Japanese martial arts. This includes (pre-Meiji) Nihon koryū bujutsu/bugei and (post-Meiji) gendai budō. We operate under the protection of the Japanese Imperial House as an entity that protects Japanese culture. The organization was created by Suzuki Masafumi-kanchō in 1969. After the passing of its founder, Ishikawa Takashi-kanchō, Toyama-ryū iaidō hanshi 9th dan and jūkendo hanshi 9th dan, replaced him as President of the Zen Nihon Sōgō-Budō Renmei.

===Africa===
*[[South Africa]] The [http://www.sakf.co.za/ South Africa Kendo Federation]. The SAKF and [[Tunisia]] The [http://www.tun-kf.org/ Tunisian Kendo League]. The TKL are the only two federations recognized by The International Kendo Federation (FIK) in Africa, but there is also kendo activity in [[Mozambique]], [[Madagascar]] and [[Malawi]].

Kendo was introduced to [[Malawi]] in 1992 when a Japanese volunteer took on a group of local children as his students. The [https://www.facebook.com/KendoAssociationOfMalawi Kendo Association of Malawi] was formed in 1999 and has seen significant growth in recent years. The Kendo Association of [[Malawi]] works closely with the Embassy of Japan in Malawi to promote kendo as a sport and to encourage cultural exchange and interaction between the peoples of the two nations. The majority of the Kendo Associations activities take place in [[Blantyre]] and [[Lilongwe]], with some activity in [[Mzuzu]]. The Association holds regular weekly practice sessions in each city, and holds at least two local tournaments each year which are patronized by all manner of people including Embassy officials and Japanese expatriates and their families.

The major challenge that the Kendo Association of [[Malawi]] faces is that of resources, as kendo equipment tends to be expensive, and funding is often difficult to secure. However, the Embassy of Japan and well wishers have been a great help in this regard, donating all manner of equipment and resource.

Although there is a great interest in tournaments of all levels, a challenge that continues to face kendo players in [[Malawi]] is a lack of opportunity to compete at a regional and international level. This hinders the progress and development of players and stunts the growth of the sport. It is currently not possible to test for [[Dan rank]] within [[Malawi]], and as of March 2014 there are less than 10 Malawians who have obtained [[Dan rank]] in kendo.

===Europe===
The [[European Kendo Federation]] (EKF) is member of [[International Kendo Federation]] (FIK), which 35 countries/regions belong to, also promotes jodo and iaido.  European kendo championships have been held since 1974. Championships are held every year that there is no world championship. Some national organisations are affiliated to EKF, while other organisations are independent of EKF.

===South America===
In South America, the practice of Kendo has existed since the arrival of Japanese immigrants as early as 1908.  Since then and with Brazil as its centre, kendo has spread over South America. Now kendo practitioners and kendo federations exist in many countries in South America such as: Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Uruguay, Aruba and Chile.

At the December 2006 meeting of the International Kendo Federation (FIK) held in Taiwan, the South American Kendo Confederation (CSK) was discussed and voted upon, as a result the Confederation was admitted as an FIK affiliate.

Argentina, Aruba, Chile, Brazil and Venezuela are affiliated with the FIK. The next South American Kendo championships will be held in Mexico during 2011.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4890">This is a glossary of levelling terms. Levelling is a surveying method used to find relative height, one use of which is to ensure ground is level during construction, for example, when excavating to prepare for laying a foundation for a house.

== Levelling terms ==

* [[Automatic level]] &amp;ndash; variant of the dumpy level, that makes use of a compensator that ensures that the line of sight remains horizontal once the operator has roughly leveled the instrument. The surveyor sets the instrument up quickly and doesn't have to relevel it carefully each time he sights on a rod on another point. It also reduces the effect of minor settling of the tripod. Three adjustment screws are used to level the instrument.
{{anchor|Back sight}} &lt;!-- redirects lead to this anchor, please do not remove. --&gt;
* [[Back sight]] (BS) – short for "back sight reading", the first staff reading taken by the surveyor after the levelling instrument is set up and levelled. B.S is generally taken on the point of known reduced level as on the benchmark or a change point.&lt;ref&gt;Surveying Volume 1 by Prof. C.L Kochher. Retrieved on 27 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Benchmark (surveying)]] – fixed reference point of known elevation with respect to which RL of other points is determined. Benchmarks can be arbitrary or permanent, the former is used for calculation of reduced levels for small survey works and the latter is used to calculate the elevations of significantly important locations and points. Arbitrary benchmarks are assumed to be equal to 100 meters generally and then the elevations with respect to assumed benchmark is determined. It is commonly practiced by engineering students. For GTS surveys of the country, surveyors use permanent benchmarks to calculate the elevations of different points.&lt;ref&gt;Surveying Volume 1 by Prof C.L Kochher. Retrieved on 28 October 2014. Page no. 218&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Datum surface]] – reference plane with respect to which RL of the other survey points is determined. The datum surface may be real or imaginary location with a nominated elevation of zero.  The commonly used datum is mean sea level.&lt;ref&gt;Surveying Volume 1 by Dr. B.C Punmia and Ashok Kumar Jain. Retrieved on 27 October 2014 &lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Dumpy level]] &amp;ndash; optical instrument used to establish or check points in the same horizontal plane. It is used in surveying and building with a vertical staff to measure height differences and to transfer, measure and set heights. Also called a builder's level or leveling instrument.
{{anchor|Fore sight}} &lt;!-- redirects lead to this anchor, please do not remove. --&gt;
* [[Fore sight (surveying)|Fore sight]] (FS) – short for "fore sight reading", the last staff reading taken before changing the instrument to the other position. It is the staff reading taken on point whose RL is to determined. This sight is considered as negative and deduced from Height of Instrument to determine RL of the point.
{{anchor|Intermediate sight}} &lt;!-- redirects lead to this anchor, please do not remove. --&gt;
* [[Intermediate sight]]s – all readings taken between back sight and fore sight. These are the points whose RL is determined by the method already mentioned above in FS. Also called inter-sight readings.
* [[Laser level]] &amp;ndash; control tool consisting of a laser beam projector that can be affixed to a tripod, and which projects a fixed red or green beam along the horizontal and/or vertical axis. A rotary laser level is a more advanced laser level in that it spins the beam of light fast enough to give the effect of a complete 360 degree horizontal or vertical plane, thus illuminating not just a fixed line, but a horizontal plane.
* [[Levelling]] – measurement of geodetic height using an optical levelling instrument and a level staff or rod having a numbered scale. Common levelling instruments include the spirit level, the dumpy level, the digital level, and the laser level.
* [[Levelling staff]] &amp;ndash; specialized measuring stick or vertical staff used with the dumpy level, held by a second person while the operator of the level looks through it and takes readings off of the staff. Also call a rod.
* [[Reduced level]] (RL) –  equating elevations of survey points with reference to a common assumed datum. The elevation is positive or negative according as point lies above or below datum.
* [[Spirit level]] &amp;ndash; instrument designed to indicate whether a surface is horizontal (level) or vertical (plumb). While used by surveyors, different types of spirit levels may be used by carpenters, stonemasons, bricklayers, other building trades workers, millwrights and other metalworkers, and in some photographic or videographic work.

Contemporary typographers view typography as a craft with a very long [[history]] tracing its origins back to the first punches and dies used to make [[Seal (device)|seal]]s and [[currency]] in [[Ancient history|ancient times]]. The basic elements of typography are at least as old as [[civilization]] and the earliest [[writing system]]s&amp;mdash;a series of key developments that were eventually drawn together into one, systematic craft.

__TOC__

==Medieval design roots==
[[File:Gutenberg bible Old Testament Epistle of St Jerome.jpg|thumb|top|200px|First page of the first volume of the [[Gutenberg Bible]], printed with an early [[textualis|textur]] typeface c. 1455. In this copy the [[decorative]] colored initials were [[calligraphy|hand-lettered]] separately by a scribe.]]

Typography, type-founding and typeface design began as closely related crafts in mid-15th-century Europe with the introduction of [[movable type]] [[Printing press|printing]] at the junction of the medieval era and the [[Renaissance]]. Handwritten letterforms of the mid-15th century embodied 3000&amp;nbsp;years of evolved letter design, and were the natural models for letterforms in systematized typography. The scribal letter known as ''[[textualis|textur]]'' or ''textualis'', produced by the strong [[Gothic art|gothic]] spirit of [[blackletter]] from the hands of German area scribes, served as the model for the first text types.

[[Johannes Gutenberg]] employed the [[scribe]] [[Peter Schöffer]] to help design and cut the letterpunches for the first typeface&amp;mdash;the [[D-K type]] of 202 characters used to print the first printed books in Europe. A second typeface of about 300 characters designed for the [[Gutenberg Bible|42-line Bible]] c. 1455 was probably cut by the goldsmith Hans Dunne with the help of two others&amp;mdash;Götz von Shlettstadt and [[Hans von Speyer]].

Cultural tradition ensured that German typography and type design remained true to the gothic/blackletter spirit; but the parallel influence of the humanist and neo-classical typography in Italy (the second country where movable type printing was done) catalyzed textur into four additional sub-styles that were distinct, structurally rich and highly disciplined: [[Bastarda]], [[Fraktur (typeface sub-classification)|fraktur]], [[Rotunda (script)|rotunda]], and [[Schwabacher]].

The rapid spread of movable type printing across Europe produced additional Gothic, half-Gothic and Gothic-to-Roman transitional types. [[Johann Bämler]]'s Schwabacher, [[Augsburg (typeface)|Augsburg]] appeared in 1474. The half-Gothic Rotunda type of [[Erhard Ratdolt]] c. 1486 was cut to suit [[Venice|Venetian]] taste. In 1476 [[William Caxton]], having learned his craft on the Continent, printed the first books in England with a so-called Bâtarde type (an early Schwabacher design), but soon abandoned it.

The early printers of Spain were Germans who began by printing in up-to-date roman types but soon gave these up and adopted Gothic typefaces based on the letterforms of Spanish manuscripts. [[Valencia]] in the Kingdom of Aragon was the location of the first press, established in 1473. From there printers moved to other cities to set up presses. Roman types were used by the printers of Salamanca for their editions of classical authors. Printing in Portuguese began at Lisbon in 1495 (the first book printed in Portugal was a Hebrew book printed in 1489).&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, S. H. (1961) ''Five Hundred Years of Printing''. Harmondsworth: Penguin; pp. 94, 96, 98&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical revival==
In [[Italy]] the heavy gothic styles were soon displaced by ''Venetian'' or "old style" Latin types, also called [[Antiqua (typeface class)|antiqua]]. The [[Roman square capitals|inscriptional capitals]] on [[ancient Rome|Roman]] buildings and [[monument]]s were structured on a [[Euclidean geometry|euclidean]] [[geometry|geometric]] scheme and the [[Classical order|discrete component-based model]] of [[classical architecture]]. Their structurally perfect design, near-perfect execution in stone, balanced angled stressing, contrasting thick and thin strokes, and incised [[serif]]s became the typographic ideal for [[Western culture|western civilization]]. The best-known example of Roman [[Roman square capitals|inscriptional capitals]] exists on the base of Trajan's Column, inscribed c. 113.

[[File:Trajan inscription duotone.jpg|thumb|center|580px|'''[[Roman square capitals|Roman inscriptional capitals]]''' on the base of '''[[Trajan's Column]]''', c. 113.]]

In their enthusiastic [[Neoclassicism|revival of classical culture]], Italian scribes and [[Humanism|humanist]] scholars of the early 15th century searched for ancient lower case letters to match the Roman inscriptional capitals. Practically all of the available manuscripts of classical writers had been rewritten during the [[Carolingian Renaissance]], and with a lapse of three hundred years since the widespread use of this style, the humanist scribes mistook [[Carolingian minuscule]] as the authentic writing style of the ancients. Dubbing it ''lettera antica'', they began by copying the minuscule hand almost exactly, combining it with Roman capitals in the same manner as the manuscripts they were copying.&lt;ref name="nesbitt"&gt;Nesbitt, Alexander ''The History and Technique of Lettering'' (c) 1957, [[Dover Publications|Dover Publications, Inc.]] {{ISBN|0-486-20427-8}}  {{OCLC|654540}}. The Dover edition is an abridged and corrected republication of the work originally published in 1950 by Prentice-Hall, Inc. under the title ''Lettering: The History and Technique of Lettering as Design''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Carolingian sample.png|thumb|center|538px|'''Sample of Carolingian writing''' from the [[Carolingian Gospel Book (British Library, MS Add. 11848)|Carolingian Gospel Book produced between 820 and 830 AD]]]]

Upon noticing the stylistic mismatch between these two very different letters, the scribes redesigned the small Carolingian letter, lengthening ascenders and descenders, and adding incised serifs and finishing strokes to integrate them with the Roman capitals. By the time [[movable type|moveable type]] reached Italy several decades later, the humanistic writing had evolved into a consistent model known as [[Humanist minuscule|humanistic minuscule]], which served as the basis for type style we know today as Venetian.&lt;ref name="nesbitt"/&gt;

==Transition from humanistic minuscule to roman type==
The classically endowed city of [[Rome]] attracted the first printers known to have set up shop outside Germany, [[Arnold Pannartz and Konrad Sweynheim]], closely followed by the brothers [[Johann and Wendelin of Speyer]] (de Spira), and the Frenchman [[Nicolas Jenson]]. The sequence of appearance and production dates for types used by these printers have yet to be established with certainty; all four are known to have printed with types ranging from textur Gothic to fully developed romans inspired by the earlier humanistic writing, and within a few years the center of printing in Italy shifted from Rome to [[Venice]].

Some time before 1472 in Venice, Johann and Wendelin issued material printed with a half-Gothic-half-roman type known as "Gotico-antiqua". This design paired simplified Gothic capitals with a rationalized humanistic minuscule letter set, itself combining Gothic minuscule forms with elements of Carolingian, in a one step forward, half step back blending of styles.

Around the same time (1468) in Rome, Pannartz and Sweynheim were using another typeface that closely mimicked humanistic minuscule, known as "Lactantius". Unlike the rigid fractured forms of Speyer's half-Gothic, the Lactantius is characterized by smoothly rendered letters with a restrained organic finish. The Lactantius '''a''' departed from both the Carolingian and Gothic models; a vertical backstem and right-angled top replaced the diagonal Carolingian structure, and a continuous curved stroke replaced the fractured Gothic bowl element.

For details on the evolution of lower case letterforms from Latin capitals, see [[Latin alphabet]].

==Development of roman type==
&lt;!-- "Whiteletter" in "Broadside (music)" links directly to this section. Please don't change the heading without doing the link as well—thanks. --&gt;[[Nicolas Jenson]] began printing in Venice with his original roman font from 1470. Jenson's design and the very similar roman types cut by [[Francesco Griffo]] c. 1499 and Erhard Ratdolt c. 1486 are acknowledged as the definitive and [[archetype|archetypal]] roman faces that set the pattern for the majority of western text faces that followed.

The Jenson roman was an explicitly typographic letter designed on its own terms that declined to imitate the appearance of hand-lettering. Its effect is one of a unified cohesive whole, a seamless fusion of style with structure, and the successful convergence of the long progression of preceding letter styles. Jenson adapted the structural unity and component-based modular integration of Roman capitals to humanistic minuscule forms by masterful [[Abstraction|abstract]] stylization. The carefully modelled [[serifs]] follow an artful [[logic]] of [[asymmetry]]. The [[ratio]] of extender lengths to letter bodies and the distance between lines results in balanced, harmonious body of type. Jenson also mirrors the ideal expressed in renaissance painting of carving up space (typographic "white space") with figures (letters) to articulate the relationship between the two and make the white space dynamic.

[[File:Jenson 1475 venice laertius.png|center|thumb|600px|'''[[Nicolas Jenson]]'s roman type''' used in Venice c. 1470. Later "old style" or Venetian book romans such as [[Aldus Manutius|Aldines]], and much later [[Bembo]], were closely based on Jenson.]]

The name "roman" is customarily applied uncapitalized to distinguish early Jenson and Aldine-derived types from classical Roman letters of antiquity. Some parts of Europe call roman "antiqua" from its connection with the humanistic "lettera antica"; "medieval" and "old-style" are also employed to indicate roman types dating from the late 15th century, especially those used by [[Aldus Manutius]] (Italian: Manuzio). Roman faces based on those of Speyer and Jenson are also called Venetian.

==Italic type==
The humanist spirit driving the Renaissance produced its own unique style of formal writing, known as "cursiva humanistica". This slanted and rapidly written letter evolved from humanistic minuscule and the remaining Gothic current cursive hands in Italy, served as the model for ''[[cursive]]'' or italic typefaces. As books printed with early roman types forced humanistic minuscule out of use, cursiva humanistica gained favor as a manuscript hand for the purpose of writing. The popularity of cursive writing itself may have created some demand for a type of this style. The more decisive catalyst was probably the printing of pocket editions of [[Latin literature|Latin classics]] by Aldus Manutius.

The "Aldino" italic type, commissioned by Manutius and cut by Francesco Griffo in 1499, was a closely spaced condensed type. Griffo's punches are a delicate translation of the Italian cursive hand, featuring letters of irregular slant angle and uneven height and vertical position, with some connected pairs (''[[Ligature (typography)|ligature]]s''), and unslanted small roman capitals the height of the lower case '''t'''. The fame of Aldus Manutius and his editions made the Griffo italic widely copied and influential, although it was not the finest of the pioneer italics. The "Aldino" style quickly became known as "italic" from its Italian origin.

Around 1527 the Vatican chancellery scribe [[Ludovico Arrighi]] designed a superior italic type and had the punches cut by Lauticio di Bartolomeo dei Rotelli. The more modular structure of Arrighi's italic and its few ligatures made it less a copy of the cursive hand than Griffo's. Its slightly taller roman capitals, a gentler slant angle, taller ascenders and wider separation of lines gave the elegant effect of refined handwriting.

[[File:Arrighi italic.png|center|thumb|600px|'''Italic type''' designed by Ludovico Arrighi, c. 1527. This elegant design inspired later French italic types.]]

Surviving examples of 16th-century Italian books indicate the bulk of them were printed with italic types. By mid-century the popularity of italic types for sustained text setting began to decline until they were used only for in-line citations, block quotes, preliminary text, emphasis, and abbreviations. Italic types from the 20th century up to the present are much indebted to Arrighi and his influence on French designers.

Swiss art historian [[Jakob Burckhardt]] described the classically inspired Renaissance ''modello'' of dual case roman and cursive italic types as "The model and ideal for the whole western world". Venetian pre-eminence in type design was brought to an end by the political and economic turmoil that concluded the Renaissance in Italy with the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|sack of Rome in 1527]].

==Renaissance Germany and Switzerland==
Soon after 1500, roman typefaces began to gain popularity north of the Alps for printing of Latin literature.  [[Johann Froben]] of [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]] set up his press in 1491, and by about 1519 (when he printed [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus]]'s famous edition of the Greek [[New Testament]]) he had established a set of standards for humanistic printing which were widely copied throughout the German-speaking world and also in [[Spain]] and, to a lesser extent in England.  His principal type is wholly roman in the shape of the characters but retains an echo of gothic influence in the angled serifs and the way the thick and thin strokes are organized; it was coupled with mated sets of woodcut initials (often designed by distinguished artists) and with two larger sizes of uppercase letters for use in title pages and headings—Froben was the first to use such 'display faces' consistently, breaking away from the Italian tradition in which title pages and headings tended to be set in the same size as the main text.  By using these large faces, Froben developed the title page as a fully organized artistic whole. Froben's italic face is based on that of Aldus but more even and uniform in effect.  These Swiss books are the first to have been designed in every detail as printed artifacts rather than as adaptations of manuscript technique.

After about 1550 this Swiss/German tradition was gradually overwhelmed by French influence.  Towards the end of the 16th century, the [[Wechel]] family of [[Frankfurt]], previously based in Paris, was producing fine books which used French typefaces in conjunction with heavy but resplendent woodcut ornaments to achieve a splendid page effect;  but soon after 1600 there was a general, marked decline in the quality of both skill and materials, from which German printing did not recover until the 20th century.

==16th century France==
Typography was introduced to France by the German printers Martin Crantz, Michael Freyburger and Ulrich Gering, who set up a press in [[Paris]] in 1470, where they printed with an inferior copy of the Lactantius type. Gothic types dominated in France until the end of the 15th century, when they were gradually supplanted by roman designs. [[Jodocus Badius Ascensius]] (Josse Bade) in partnership with [[Henri Estienne]] established a press in Paris in 1503. Printing with undeveloped Roman and half-Gothic types, the French pair were too occupied meeting the demand for Humanistic and classical texts to design any original types of their own. French books nonetheless began to follow the format established by Italian printers, and [[Lyon]] and Paris became the new centers of activity. Eventually, the French government fixed a standard height for all type, to ensure that different batches could be used together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Diderot|first1=Denis|title=Encyclopédie ou Dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers|date=1765|location=Paris|pages=Vol. 8, p. 73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===De Colines, Estienne, and Augereau===
After their 1494 invasion of Italy the French were greatly influenced by Renaissance culture, and later set about converting French culture from Gothic to neo-classical. The required phonetic and orthographic changes to French language hindered the evolution of type design in France until the late 1520s. At the end of this period roman types introduced by [[Robert Estienne]], [[Simon de Colines]] and Antoine Augereau began a phase of type design with a distinctly French character. Robert Estienne carried on the establishment of his father Henri Estienne, who had died in 1520. Simon de Colines had been the elder Estienne's assistant, married his widow, and set up his own press.

The de Colines roman of 1531 resembled Griffo's 1499 roman but did not copy it closely. Narrower forms and tighter letter fit; '''a''' with low angled bowl; elevated triangular stem serifs on '''i''', '''j''', '''m''', '''n''' and '''r'''; flattened [[baseline (typography)|baseline]] serifs, delicately modeled [[Ascender (typography)|ascender]] serifs and graceful, fluid lines characterize the French style. Robert Estienne's roman of 1532 was similar to the de Colines face, which Estienne complemented with a fine italic type based on that of Arrighi. The craftsmen who cut the punches for the romans used by Estienne and de Colines remain unidentified. In 1532 Antoine Augereau cut the punches for a roman type very close to Estienne's. The lower cases of the Estienne and Augereau types became the basis for post-Renaissance old style typography, and were copied by French typographers for the next 150&amp;nbsp;years.

===Garamond===
[[File:GaramondSpecimenA.svg|right|thumb|200px|'''Garamond type''' revival by [[Robert Slimbach]].]]

The svelte French style reached its fullest refinement in the roman types attributed to the best-known figure of French typography&amp;mdash;[[Claude Garamond]] (also Garamont). In 1541 [[Robert Estienne]], printer to the king, helped Garamond obtain commissions to cut the sequence of Greek fonts for King [[Francis I of France]], known as the "[[grecs du roi]]". A number of roman faces used in Garamond's publishing activities can be positively attributed to him as punch-cutter. From the dates of their appearance, and their similarity to romans used by Estienne, [[Christoffel Plantijn]] and the printer André Wechel, the types known as "Canon de Garamond" and "Petit Canon de Garamond" shown on a specimen sheet issued by the Egenolff-Berner foundry in 1592 are generally accepted as [[Garamond|Claude Garamond's final roman types]].

===Robert Granjon===
[[File:Evangelium Sanctum Domini Nostri Jesu Christi in Arabic 1590 with Arabic types of Robert Grandjon Rome Typographia Medicea.jpg|thumb|left|''Evangelium Sanctum Domini Nostri Jesu Christi'' in [[Arabic]], 1590, with Arabic types of Robert Grandjon, ''[[Typographia Medicea]]'', [[Rome]].]]
[[Robert Granjon]] worked in the second half of the 16th century, mainly at Lyon, but was also recorded at Paris, Rome and [[Antwerp]]. He is still famous because of his [[Civilité]] types, imitating French gothic cursive calligraphy.  His main contribution was an italic type known as "Parangon de Granjon". Italic type design had apparently become corrupted since the Arrighi and Aldine models. Granjon's italic had a greater slant angle, slanted roman capitals, and reduced weight and rigor. These qualities and its contrasting thick and thin strokes gave it a dazzling appearance that made it difficult to read. It was nevertheless the main influence for italic type design until the Arrighi model was revived in 1920.

In the 16th century, Western printers also developed Oriental types, such as [[François Savary de Brèves]] or Robert Granjon, usually with the objective of proselytizing the Catholic faith.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/vatican/orient.html Rome Reborn: The Vatican Library &amp; Renaissance Culture/ Orient to Rome]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transition to modern type: 17th and 18th century==
[[Baroque]] and [[rococo]] aesthetic trends, use of the pointed-pen for writing, and steel [[engraving]] techniques effected a gradual shift in typographic style. Contrast between thick and thin strokes increased. Tilted stressing transformed into vertical stressing; full rounds were compressed. Blunt bracketed serifs grew sharp and delicate until they were fine straight lines. Detail became clean and precise.

Transitional roman types combined the classical features of lettera antiqua with the vertical stressing and higher contrast between thick and thin strokes characteristic of the true modern romans to come.

The roman types used c. 1618 by the Dutch printing firm of [[House of Elzevir|Elzevir]] in [[Leyden]] reiterated the 16th-century French style with higher contrast, less rigor and a lighter page effect. After 1647 most Elzevir faces were cut by the highly regarded Christoffel van Dyck, whose precise renditions were regarded by some experts at the time as finer than Garamond's.

===Fell types===
[[File:Fell english roman thumb.png|thumb|200px|right|Specimen of '''Fell type''' English roman, quoting [[Cicero]]'s [[In_Catilinam#Oratio_in_Catilinam_Prima_in_Senatu_Habita|First Oration against Catiline]].]]

From mid-16th century until the end of the 17th, interference with printing by the British Crown thwarted the development of [[type foundry|type founding]] in England&amp;mdash;most type used by 17th-century English printers was of Dutch origin. The lack of material inspired Bishop of Oxford [[John Fell (clergyman)|Doctor John Fell]] to purchase punches &amp; matrices from Holland c. 1670&amp;ndash;1672 for use by the [[Oxford University Press]]. The so-named Fell types, presumed to be the work of Dutch [[punchcutting|punchcutter]] Dirck Voskens, mark a noticeable jump from previous designs, with considerably shorter extenders, higher stroke contrast, narrowing of round letters, and flattened serifs on the baseline and descenders. The design retained a retrogressive old-style irregularity, smooth modeling from vertical to horizontal, and angled stressing of rounds (except a vertically stressed '''o'''). Fell capitals were condensed, even-width, with wide flattened serifs; all characteristics of the definitive modern romans of the late 18th century. Fell italic types were distinguished by high contrast matching the Fell romans; wider ovals; a split-branching stroke from the stems of '''m n r''' and '''u'''; and long, flat serifs&amp;mdash;prefiguring modern. They repeated the non-uniform slant of French models, and the capitals included swash '''J''' and '''Q''' forms.

An open-source digitisation of the Fell Types has been released by designer and engineer Igino Marini.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marini|first1=Igino|title=The Fell Types|url=http://iginomarini.com/fell/|accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Caslon===
[[File:Caslon english roman thumb.png|thumb|200px|right|'''[[Caslon|Caslon English roman]]''', from a sample issued by the Caslon foundry and quoting the same text. Compare against the Fell type.]]
The first major figure in English typography is reckoned by type historians to have ended the monopoly of Dutch type founding almost single-handedly. The gun engraver-turned-punchcutter [[William Caslon]] spent 14&amp;nbsp;years creating the [[Caslon|stable of typefaces on the specimen sheet issued in 1734]]. The complete canon included roman, italic, Greek, Hebrew, Arabic ''etc.'' Caslon's Great Primer roman and English roman were retrogressive designs that very closely followed the Fell types and the roman of Miklós (Nicholas) Kis c. 1685 falsely attributed to [[Anton Janson]]. Like the Fells, Caslon's slightly bracketed serifs and old-style irregularity gave it a homely charm&amp;mdash;its precise cut and perpendicularity place it firmly in the 18th century however. Caslon's italic structures follow the Fell italics, but at a condensed width and with conventional branching from stems.

William Caslon's prodigious output was influential worldwide. Caslon type and its imitations were used throughout the expanding [[British empire]]. It was the dominant type in the [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]] for the second half of the 18th century. Caslon marks the rise of England as the center of typographic activity.

===Fleischmann===
[[Joan Michaël Fleischman]] (1701&amp;ndash;1768) was born in [[Nürnberg]] where he trained as a punchcutter. He found employment with Dutch type founders in Holland and settled there c. 1728. At the Enschedé foundry in [[Haarlem]] he cut punches for a large amount of material. Some time after 1743 he produced a distinguished roman design&amp;mdash;related to the preceding transitional types but departing from them. It prefigured modern romans with sparse transaxial modeling joining the vertical stressing to hairline thins, and ball-ends. Fleischmann borrowed from the general mode of Phillipe Grandjean’s and Louis Simonneau’s "[[Romain du Roi]]," commissioned by [[Louis XIV]] in 1692&lt;ref name="meggs58"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Meggs | first = Philip B. | authorlink = Philip B. Meggs | title = A History of Graphic Design | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. | year = 1998 | location =  | edition = Third | pages = 108–109 | isbn = 978-0-471-29198-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the Imprimerie Royale, but did not imitate that face. Fleischmann's capitals were a new variety; an even-width scheme, compressed rounds, all-vertical stressing, and triangular beak ends of '''E F L T''' and '''Z''', all characteristics prefiguring the "classical" moderns of [[Bodoni]] and [[Didot (typeface)|Didot]]. Fleischmann's italic bore some resemblance to Granjean's but had longer ascenders and followed the established Dutch structures for '''h v''' and '''w'''.

Fleischmann was held in great esteem by his contemporaries, his designs exerting a decisive influence in the last quarter of the 18th century. Renowned French punchcutter [[Pierre Simon Fournier]] (1712–1768), confessed to having copied Fleischmann's design, and was first to dub "contrast" types like the Fells, Caslon and Fleischmann "modern". Fournier's rococo-influenced designs&amp;mdash;Fournier and Narcissus&amp;mdash;and his Modèles des Caractères (1742) continued the romaine du roi style and adapted it for his own modern age. Like Baskerville, his italics were inspired by handwriting and the engraved lettering known as [[copperplate_script | copperplate]] hand. Fournier also published a two volume ''Manuel Typographique'', in which he recorded much European typographic history, and introduced the first standardized system of type size measurement&amp;mdash;the "point".

===Baskerville===
[[File:basker specimen.jpg|right|thumb|200px|'''The [[Baskerville]] typeface''' designed by John Baskerville.]]
The roman and italic types of [[John Baskerville]] c. 1772 appeared later than Fleischman's but are considered transitional and partly retrogressive with a return to lower contrast, smooth transaxial modeling, finely modeled bracketed serifs, and long stems. The exquisite design and finish of Baskerville's roman however, combining elegance and strength, was modern. His roman design, and especially his italic, were rococo-influenced. His designs did not visibly quote any previous types. They were informed by his prior experience as a writing master and the influences of his time. The types of Joseph Fry, Alexander Wilson, and John Bell closely followed Baskerville, and through his correspondence with European type founders Baskerville's influence penetrated most of western Europe. Baskerville was a meticulous artist who controlled all aspects of his creation, devising more accurate presses, blacker inks and paper sealed with hot rollers to ensure crisp impressions. Of particular note, the lower storey of his lowercase g does not fully close. Derivatives of Baskerville are often identified thus. A modern revival of Baskerville, a font called [[Mrs Eaves]], is named after Baskerville's wife who was the widow of Richard Eaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Penney|first=Chris|title=Dr B T Davis's bequest|journal=Research Libraries Bulletin|issue=6|page=21|issn=1355-9877|url=http://www.special-coll.bham.ac.uk/rlb_autumn98.pdf|accessdate=2008-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern romans===
[[File:Bodoni mt thumb ls.png|thumb|200px|right|'''[[Facsimile]] of sample''' published with genuine [[Bodoni]] types by the Officina Bodoni in 1925. The font shown is the digital Bodoni [[Monotype]] c. 1999.]][[File:AFDidotSpecimen.svg|right|thumb|200px|'''Didot type''' Revival designed in 1991 by Adrian Frutiger for [[Mergenthaler Linotype Company|Linotype foundry]].]]
True modern romans arrived with the types of the Italian [[Giambattista Bodoni]] and the French [[Didot family|Didot]]s. Completing trends begun by the Fell types, Fleischman, Fournier and Baskerville, the so-called "classical" modern romans eschewed [[chirography|chirographic]] and organic influences, their synthetic [[Symmetry|symmetric]] geometry answering to a rationalized and reformed classical model driven by the [[Cartesian coordinate system|strict cartesian grid]] philosophy of [[René Descartes]] and the predictable clockwork universe of [[Isaac Newton]].

The "classical" appellation of modern romans stems from their return to long ascenders and descenders set on widely spaced lines, and a corresponding light page effect reminiscent of old-style&amp;mdash;occurring at a time of classical revival.

Bodoni was foremost in progressing from rococo to the new classical style. He produced an italic very close to Baskerville's, and a French cursive script type falling in between italic type and joined scripts. The roman types of [[Didot family#François-Ambroise Didot|Francois Ambroise Didot]] and son [[Firmin Didot]] closely resemble the work of Bodoni, and opinion is divided over whether the Didots or Bodoni originated the first modern romans. At any rate the Didots' mathematical precision and vanishing of rococo design reflected the "enlightenment" of post-revolution France under [[Napoleon]]. Francois Ambroise also designed "maigre" and "gras" types corresponding to later condensed and expanded font formats.

The Spanish designer [[Joaquín Ibarra]]'s roman was influenced by Baskerville, Didot and Bodoni, but hewn nearer to old-style and used in the same classical manner, including spaced capitals. In England modern romans resembling Bodoni's were cut for the printer [[William Bulmer]] c. 1786 by the punchcutter William Martin, who had been apprenticed to Baskerville and influenced by him. Martin's italic mirrored the open-tail '''g''' and overall finesse of Baskerville's.

In Britain and the United States, modern romans (emerging around 1800 and totally dominant by the 1820s) took a somewhat more rounded, less geometrical form than the designs of Didot and Bodoni; an obvious difference is that in Anglo-American faces the upper-case C has only one serif (at the top) whereas in European designs it has two.

== 19th and 20th century typography ==
&lt;!-- E.g., Art deco and art nouveau fonts --&gt;

===Industrialization===
The 19th century brought fewer stylistic innovations. The most notable invention was the rise of typefaces with strengthened serifs. Forerunners were the so-called [[Slab serif|Egyptienne]] fonts, which were used already at the beginning of the 19th century. Their name likely comes from the enthusiasm of the Napoleonic era for the orient, which in turn was started by Napoleon's [[French Invasion of Egypt (1798)|invasion in Egypt]]. In fact slab-serif fonts (''e.&amp;thinsp;g.'' [[Clarendon (typeface)|Clarendon]] from 1845) were newspaper fonts, whose serifs were strengthened in order to prevent damage during the printing process. Stylistically the serif fonts of the mid-19th century appeared very robust and otherwise had more or less neo-classical design features, which changed during the course of time: By the application of the slab serif design feature and by appending serifs to more and more typefaces, an independent intermediate group of heterogeneous fonts emerged during the 20th century. Meanwhile, the slab serifs are listed as an independent group in most typeface classifications&amp;mdash;besides both main groups '''serif''' and '''sans serif'''.

Slab-serif and sanserif types were rarely used for continuous bodies of text; their realm was that of advertisements, title-pages and other attention-catching pieces of print. By about 1820, most western countries were using modern romans and italics for continuous texts. This remained true until the 1860s, when so-called 'old style' faces&amp;mdash;a largely English-speaking phenomenon&amp;mdash;came into use. These went to the opposite extreme from the modern faces; 'thick' strokes were attenuated, and serifs at the end of thin strokes (as in C, E, L and T) were narrow and angled whereas in modern faces they were broad and vertical or nearly so. All the upper-case characters were somewhat 'condensed' (narrowed). Old style faces remained popular until about 1910.

Above all the 19th century was innovative regarding technical aspects. Automatic manufacturing processes changed the print as well as the graphical illustrations. The illustration of printed matters could be considerably standardised due to the [[lithography]] technique invented by [[Alois Senefelder]]. Finally, another invention was [[photography]], whose establishment at the end of the 19th century led to the first [[halftone|halftoning]] and reproduction procedures. The step-by-step development of a modern mass society provided a growing demand of printed matters. Besides the traditional letterpress beginnings of a newspaper landscape as well as a broad market for publications, advertisements, and posters of all kinds appeared. The challenges had changed: since printing and typography had been a straightforward craft for centuries, it now had to face the challenges of an industry-ruled mass society.

===Hot type and phototypesetting in the 20th century===
[[File:Monotype-machine.jpg|thumb|left|[[Monotype Corporation|Monotype]] machine]]
[[File:exlibris-1921.png|thumb|left|[[Bookplate|Exlibris]], 1921]]
The 90 years between 1890 and 1980 coined typography until now. The craft of printing became an industry, and the typography became a part of it as well. Both stylistically and technologically this epoch was really tumultuous. The significant developments were the following:
*The fabrication and application of typefaces more and more were affected by industrial '''manufacturing processes'''. Significant incidents were the invention of the [[Hot metal typesetting|hot type]] machine by [[Ottmar Mergenthaler]] ([[Linotype machine]], 1886) and [[Tolbert Lanston]] ([[Monotype Corporation|Monotype machine]], 1887) and a few decades later the emergence of [[phototypesetting]]. The result: Compilation and typographical design of the text could be more and more controlled by keyboards in contrast to manual typesetting.
*A result of the industrialisation process was the unimagined '''number and distribution of new typefaces'''. Whether [[Digital data|digital]] variants of ''Garamond'' and ''Bodoni'' or new contemporary type designs like ''[[Futura (typeface)|Futura]]'', ''[[Times Roman|Times]]'', and ''[[Helvetica]]'', nearly all currently used typefaces have their origin either in the following and ongoing [[Typesetting#Digital era|digital typesetting era]] or are based on designs of this epoch. The basis was the appearance of large [[type foundry|type foundries]] and type manufacturers. The result: Successful typefaces could quickly gain the status of a trademark&amp;mdash;and therefore were able to assign a unique "[[brand]]ing" to products or publications.
*Besides the traditional typography of books '''[[graphic design]]''' became a more or less independent branch. The tensions between those two branches significantly determined the stylistic development of 20th century's typography.

===Art nouveau and New Book Art===
[[File:Typeface-eckmann.jpg|thumb|right|[[Eckmann (typeface)|Eckmann]], 1901.]]
Since [[impressionism]] the modern art styles were reflected in graphic design and typography too. Since 1890 the [[Art nouveau]] became popular. Its floral ornaments, the curved forms, as well as the emphasis on graphical realisation inspired the type designers of the start of the 20th century. A popular art nouveau font was the ''[[Eckmann (typeface)|Eckmann]]'' designed by graphic artist [[Otto Eckmann]]. Furthermore, the influence of art nouveau was expressed in a lot of book illustrations and [[Bookplate|exlibris]] designs.

Altogether the return to the roots of book art become stronger around the start of the 20th century. It was initiated by British typographer, socialist, and [[private press]] publisher [[William Morris]] as well as by the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], which refers to him. Essentially this movement initiated three things: a return to the antiqua-models of the Renaissance, clarity and simplicity of book illustrations, and straightforward technical processes during the production of printed matters. An immediate consequence of the Arts and Crafts Movement was the establishment of the private press movement, which more or less was committed to Morris' ideals, and whose remains partially are still present today. An established meeting point of this scene in Germany for example is the [[Mainzer Minipressen-Messe]], which actually is held every two years.

Especially the [[New Book Art]] movement, which formed in the decade before [[World War I]], was influenced by the Arts and Crafts Movement. The young type designers of the pre-war era, among them [[Fritz Helmuth Ehmcke]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Kleukens]], rejected both the late typographical classicism and the ornaments of the popular Art nouveau. The new ideal became a tidy and straightforward book typography, which dedicated itself to the ideas of the Renaissance. [[Walter Tiemann]] in Leipzig, [[Friedrich Hermann Ernst Schneidler]] in Stuttgart, and [[Rudolf Koch]] in Offenbach as instructors were the mentors of this kind of typography. They stayed influential in the field of book typesetting until a long time after the end of [[World War II]].

The '''ISRO Propulsion Complex''' ('''IPRC'''), located at [[Mahendragiri]] of [[Tamil Nadu]], is an [[Indian Space Research Organisation]] centre involved in testing, assembling, and integrating propulsion systems and stages that are developed at ISRO's [[Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre]]s. Formerly, IPRC was known as LPSC, Mahendragiri, functioning under [[Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre|LPSC]], Valiamala in [[Thiruvananthapuram]] of [[Kerala]]. It was elevated as an independent centre and renamed as IPRC with effect from February 1, 2014.&lt;ref name="ISRO"&gt;http://www.isro.gov.in/isrocentres/iprc.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/lpsc-at-mahendragiri-elevated/article5641468.ece&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2014-02-01/science/46897203_1_mahendragiri-vikram-sarabhai-space-centre-gslv&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
In 2010, Superintendent of Public Schools for Bertie County, Chip Zullinger (1951-2014) had been hired to address the school district's serious shortcomings.&lt;ref name="indie"/&gt;  After completing four large architectural projects with designer Emily Pilloton (author of the 2009 book ''Design Revolution'') and architect Matt Miller,&lt;ref name="indie"/&gt; Zullinger invited the two to create a high school curriculum.

Pilloton and Miller described the curriculum, ultimately named '''''Studio H''''', as [[Industrial arts|shop class]] for the 21st century, where the design process could address the community's problems and its own sense of possibility. Named after its focus on "humanity, habitats, health and happiness,"&lt;ref name="variety"&gt;{{cite news

Pilloton and partner Miller, worked with 10 (initially 13)&lt;ref name="the.only"/&gt; high school students at Bertie Early College High School through the year-long,  full-scale design/build curriculum &amp;mdash; following six design rules: there is no design without critical action; we work 'with' not 'for;' we start locally and scale globally; create systems, not stuff; document, share and measure; and finally build.  The students began the school year&lt;ref name="cowpies"/&gt;&lt;ref name="day_one"&gt;{{cite news

The project team and the community had identified a new farmer's market as a viable and desirable community project, and under the leadership of Pilloton and Miller the students focused on developing design and construction skills: critical thinking, research (e.g., analyzing Buckminster Fuller's [[Dymaxion House]]), sketching, and drafting, along with welding and real-world construction trades. Pilloton and Miller in turn completed construction documents and specifications, worked with a structural engineer and filed for construction permits &amp;mdash; while also preparing and conducting three hours of daily classroom instruction.&lt;ref name="daily"&gt;{{cite news

The film backtracks to tell the story of Matt Miller and his thesis project from the Cranbrook Academy, where he designed and constructed along with classmate Thomas Gardner a 900 sf, two-story infill house.&lt;ref name="house"&gt;{{cite news

Together the Project H team identified student Stevie Mizelle's preliminary concept model to develop further, subsequently completing construction of the farmer's market to approximately 75% before the school year ended.  The design features a large wood platform for vendor booths with vertical wood trusses supporting a rectilinear roofed canopy with wood slats designed to filter and control solar glare; a main floor at the same height above grade as a pickup truck bed, allowing vendors to back up to the "loading dock" at each vendor stall and walk their goods directly off their truck into their booth; and a long ramp at the front to allow pedestrian accessibility and to provide a symbolic front porch for visitors.&lt;ref name="studioh2"&gt;{{cite news

Early in the school year, Pilloton and Miller chose to continue with the project after Zullinger, their prime backer, was dismissed by the school board, and the board became unwilling to underwrite the curriculum and withdrew their offered salaries.&lt;ref name="indie"/&gt; Pilloton and Miller continued to work with the students and subsequently completed construction of the farmer's market after the school year ended.  The Windsor Super Market opened in October 2011.

Students featured in ''Studio H'' were Erick Bowen, Rodecoe Dunlow, Kerron Hayes, Anthony Johnson, Stevie Mizelle, Cameron Perry, Cj Robertson, Jamesha Thompson, Colin White and Alexia Williams.  The film also features County Commissioner Ron Wesson as well as volunteer Eric Wandmacher (friend of Pilloton and Miller) and Superintendent of Public Schools, Chip Zullinger.&lt;ref name="IMDB"&gt;{{cite news

==Background==

{{quote box |quote =  
My goal in going in to Bertie County was not to go in and just design for them, but to really teach their kids about the design process and do something for the community with their high school students. That, in a way, transcends a lot of this social design movement stuff ... and hopefully [it's] the next phase of what that movement can be.|source= —Matthew Miller'' &lt;ref name="daily"/&gt;}}

Prior to one-year '''''Studio H''''' curriculum in Bertie County, Pilloton and Miller had completed four architectural projects with the school board, as backed by Superintendent Zullinger: four playgrounds, three computer labs, a weight room for the football team, and a county-wide graphic campaign.&lt;ref name="indie"/&gt; Friction on the school board developed with another Zullinger-backed project, "Connect Bertie," a project to bring free county-wide internet connectivity by paying an outside entity, [[Century Link]], to provide the internet services at a cost of $2 million annually.  The tension culminated with Zullwinger's dismissal, followed a reversal of the dismissal and then acceptance of his resignation.  Without his support and the offered salaries, Zullwinger's departure directly threatened the Studio H project.&lt;ref name="zull"&gt;{{cite news

Other tensions arose, and in a 2013 interview, Pilloton identified a racially and politically charged context that surrounded the curriculum and the project &amp;mdash; describing Bertie County as a place where "hundreds of years of slavery and institutionalized racism is very much still alive and kicking."&lt;ref name="indie"/&gt; On release of the film, Pilloton and Miller said "they said they still believe it was fear of change – not lack of money in a budget that topped $30 million – that ultimately led to the board's decision."&lt;ref name="fear of change"&gt;{{cite news

Pilloton had grown up near [[Mt. Tamalpais]], California, attributing the German toy ''Quadro'' with inspiring her interest in design.&lt;ref name="indie"/&gt;  She later studied at the [[College of Environmental Design, UC Berkeley]] and the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], during a period when there was no curriculum but when there was a 100,000 sf shop class.&lt;ref name="indie"/&gt;

Matt Miller was born in [[West Virginia]] and has architecture degrees from the [[University of Tennessee]] and [[Cranbrook Academy of Art]].  He has taught architecture and design at the [[Rhode Island School of Design]], the [[College of Creative Studies]], and UC Berkeley &amp;mdash; and worked with [[Architecture for Humanity]].  Miller was the first student at the Cranbrook Academy to design and also build his thesis project (along with classmate Thomas Gardner): a 900 sf, two-story block infill house&lt;ref name="house"/&gt; at 2126 Pierce Street in [[Poletown East, Detroit|Poletown, Detroit]].  The house, ultimately abandoned,&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt; had a construction budget of $60,000 and used all-volunteer labor along with carefully selected materials (e.g., concrete block and rubber membrane roofing) to keep costs down.&lt;ref name="house"/&gt;

==Reception==
As of mid-2014, the film had received a rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] of 81% favorable critic response and 100% favorable audience response.&lt;ref name="RT"&gt;{{cite news
  | title = If You Build It
  | publisher = Rottentomatoes.com
  | url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/if_you_build_it/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Architectural Record]]'' called the film "A document of America at its most vulnerable."&lt;ref name="film82"/&gt; ''The New York Times'' reviewer Nicolas Rapold said "the movie's biggest weakness comes with its tendency to film people telling us what's going on rather than having us observe."&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news

==Follow up==
Pilloton and Miller, who had been a couple, split up&lt;ref name="daily"/&gt; some time after the period depicted in the documentary.  Matthew Miller is now the lead design/build instructor at '''''(co)studio''''', a public high school program in [[Carbondale, Colorado]].  Pilloton continues to direct Studio H, which is now in its fourth year, at the at REALM Charter School in [[Berkeley, California]].&lt;ref name="indie"/&gt;

Studio H has grown to include more than 200 students,&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;{{cite news

At a point early in the film, student Stevie Mizelle &amp;mdash; whose preliminary design for the farmer's market was ultimately selected by the team for design development &amp;mdash; joked: "school, I hate it, my dad hated it, my granddaddy hated it. I'm carrying on a tradition."  He currently studies animal behavior at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, NC, making Dean's List his freshman year.&lt;ref name="daily"/&gt;  He was the first male relative in his immediate family to graduate from high school, attributing his graduation to his work with Studio H.&lt;ref name="daily"/&gt;

The '''International Centre for Geohazards (ICG)''' is a Norwegian, multidisciplinary research and educational institute, hosted at the [[Norwegian Geotechnical Institute]] (NGI). According to the institute's website,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geohazards.no International Centre for Geohazards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302114513/http://www.geohazards.no/ |date=2008-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ICG's research activities focus on the assessment, prevention and mitigation of [[geohazard]]s, in which the latter is defined as ''a geological state that represents or has the potential to develop further in a situation leading to damage or uncontrolled risk''. From this definition, it becomes clear that geohazards are widespread, both spatially and temporally, and are always related to geological conditions and processes in both offshore, coastal and onshore environments.

The International Centre for Geohazards was established in 2002, and is a collaboration between the [[Norwegian Geotechnical Institute]], [[NORSAR]], the [[University of Oslo]], and the [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]] in Trondheim.

The '''international date line&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In this article, the convention used is to capitalize "Date Line" (or "International Date Line") when it refers to the ''standard'' [[International Date Line]], but to use small letters to refer to possible construct(s) under Jewish law.&lt;/ref&gt;  in Judaism''' is used to demarcate the change of one calendar day to the next in the [[Hebrew calendar|Jewish calendar]]. The Jewish calendar defines days as running from sundown to sundown rather than midnight to midnight. So in the context of Judaism, an international date line demarcates when the line of sundown moving across the Earth's surface stops being the sundown ending and starting one day and starts being the sundown ending and starting the following day.

However, the conventional [[International Date Line]] is a relatively recent geographic and political construct whose exact location has moved from time to time depending on the needs of different interested parties. While it is well-understood why the conventional date line is located in the Pacific Ocean, there are not really objective criteria for its exact placement within the Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;See the [[International Date Line|main article]] for details.&lt;/ref&gt; In that light, it cannot be taken for granted that the conventional International Date Line can (or should) be used as a date line under Jewish law. In practice, within Judaism the ''[[Jewish law|halakhic]]'' date line is similar to, but not necessarily identical with, the conventional Date Line, and the differences can have consequences under religious law.

==Location of the date line==

===Theoretical basis for the discussion===
Many of the opinions about the ''halakhic'' date line are structured as a response to the question of what days someone should observe as [[Shabbat]] and [[Jewish holidays]]. Shabbat occurs every seven days at any location on earth. It is normally thought to occur on Saturday—or more precisely, from Friday at sundown to Saturday at nightfall. But if the ''halakhic'' date line is not identical to the conventional Date Line, it is possible that what is Saturday with respect to the conventional Date Line is not Saturday with respect to the ''halakhic'' date line, at least in some places.

There are several opinions regarding where exactly the ''halakhic'' date line should be according to Jewish law, and at least one opinion that says that no ''halakhic'' date line really exists.&lt;ref name=kashrus/&gt;&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt;&lt;ref name="taarich"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Taplin |first1=Rabbi Yisroel |authorlink1=Yisroel Taplin |title=Sefer Taarich Yisroel |date=1998–1999 |location=Lakewood, NJ |url=http://www.datelineinhalacha.com/dateline_in_halacha.html |language=Hebrew|postscript=,}} which is summarized in English at {{cite web |title=Kitzur Taarich Yisroel: The Dateline in Halacha |url=http://www.datelineinhalacha.com/dateline_in_halacha.html |website=www.datelineinhalacha |accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=map&gt;[http://www.star-k.org/articles/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IDL_Map.pdf The International Dateline in Halacha (Star-K)(map)], 170 kB&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|90}}'''1. ''90 degrees east of Jerusalem.''''' The concept of a ''halakhic'' date line is mentioned in the ''[[Baal HaMeor]],'' a 12th-century Talmudic commentary,&lt;ref name=kashrus&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.star-k.org/articles/kashrus-kurrents/493/a-travelers-guide-to-the-international-dateline/ |last=Heber|first=Rabbi Dovid|title=A Traveller's Guide To The International Dateline |publisher=Star-k.org |accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rabbeinu Zecharya Halevi, ''Baal Hameor'', Tractate Rosh Hashana, 20b&lt;/ref&gt; which seems to indicate that the day changes in an area where the time is six hours ahead of [[Jerusalem]] (90 degrees east of Jerusalem, about 125.2°E, a line now known to run through [[Australia]], the [[Philippines]], [[China]] and [[Russia]]). This line, which he refers to as the ''K'tzai Hamizrach'' (the easternmost line), is used to calculate the day of [[Rosh Hashanah]], the Jewish New Year. According to some sources it is alluded to in both the [[Babylonian Talmud]] ([[Rosh Hashanah (tractate)|Rosh Hashanah]] and [[Eruvin (Talmud)|Eruvin]]) and in the [[Jerusalem Talmud]].  The ''[[Kuzari]]'' of [[Yehuda Halevi]], also a 12th-century work, seems to agree with this ruling.

Later decisors like the ''[[Chazon Ish]]'' (twentieth century) fundamentally agree with this ruling. However, they recognize practical issues associated with the pure use of a line of longitude for this purpose. As an example, 125.2°E passes directly through Dongfeng Street in [[Changchun]], China.&lt;ref&gt;To be precise, at a point 1.11 km east of Xihu Rd. See [https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=43.84%2C125.2#map=12/43.8400/125.1999 location on OpenStreetMaps.]&lt;/ref&gt; If this line of longitude were used strictly, people could simply avoid Shabbat altogether by crossing the street. To prevent that, the Chazon Ish rules{{refn|Cited in Taplin&lt;ref name="taarich /&gt; at footnote 16 of the web page.}}&lt;ref name="RJJ"&gt;This is rejected by the [[Yitzchok Zev Soloveitchik|Brisker Rav]] (see {{cite journal|last1=Pahmer|first1=David|title=The International Date Line and Related Issues|journal=RJJ Journal of Halacha and Contemporary Society|date=1990|volume=XXI|pages=60–83|url=http://download2.yutorah.org/1991/1053/735807.pdf|accessdate=27 April 2016|postscript=}} at page 69), who rules that the use of this meridian is absolute.&lt;/ref&gt; that the contiguous land masses to the east of that line of longitude are considered secondary (''tafel'') to the land masses west of that line. As a result, he rules that the date line runs along 125.2°E when over water, but curves around the eastern coast of mainland Asia and Australia. By this view, Russia, China and Australia are west of the date line and observe Shabbat on local Saturday. [[Japan]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Tasmania]] are east of the date line and should observe Shabbat on local Sunday, as defined by the conventional International Date Line. By this view, the Philippines and [[Indonesia]] would have portions west of the line and portions east of the line.&lt;ref name=kashrus/&gt;&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt;

'''2. ''180 degrees east of Jerusalem.''''' Rabbi [[Yechiel Michel Tucazinsky]] ruled that the International Date Line is 180 degrees east of Jerusalem.  That would mean that the date line, rather than being near 180°, would be at 144.8°W.  By this view, places east of the conventional International Date Line but west of 144.8°W—[[Alaska]], [[Hawaii]] and a variety of archipelagos in the Pacific—would observe Shabbat on the local Friday instead of the local Saturday.

It is possible (but not certain) under this view to apply the principal of ''tafel'' described above as well. In that event, mainland Alaska would be east of the date line, but the [[Aleutian Islands]] would be west of the date line.&lt;ref name=kashrus/&gt;&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt;

'''3. ''Mid-Pacific.''''' A variety of decisors{{refn|''Inter alia,'' Rabbis David Shapira, B. Rabinowitz Thumim, the ''Atzei Sodeh,'' and the ''Alai Yonah.'' These decisors do not necessarily rule identically to each other.&lt;ref name=kashrus/&gt;&lt;ref name=chabad&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shurpin|first1=Rabbi Yehuda|title=The Sabbath, the International Date Line and Jewish Law|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1736567/jewish/|website=Chabad.org|publisher=Chabad-Lubavitch|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} rule that the date line runs in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, close to (but not necessarily the same as) the conventional International Date Line. According to this point of view, all of the major populated areas of the Pacific (such as New Zealand, Japan, Alaska and Hawaii) observe Shabbat on local Saturday (that is, consistent with the conventional International Date Line). Only certain Pacific islands, generally having few or no permanent Jewish residents, might not observe Shabbat on local Saturday.&lt;ref name=map/&gt;

'''4. ''Following local custom/There is no fixed date line.''''' According to Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Kasher]], there is no clear tradition or Talmudic source dictating any of the preceding opinions as binding. For that reason, and consistent with a [[History of responsa in Judaism|responsum]] of the [[Radbaz]], Rabbi Kasher starts with the default law that a Jew not knowing the proper day for Shabbat should count days from the last time s/he observed Shabbat, and that every seven days is Shabbat. In his view, established Jewish communities are presumed to have fixed their calendars according to this principle. Therefore, Shabbat in an established community is whatever day the community has established. Rabbi [[Isser Zalman Meltzer]] and Rabbi [[Zvi Pesach Frank]] apparently agree with this position.&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt;&lt;ref name=gewirtz&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gewirtz|first1=William L.|title=Zemannim: On the Introduction of New Constructs in Halakhah|journal=The Torah U-Madda Journal|date=2012–13|volume=16|pages=153–172|jstor=23596060}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|155}} This position does not in and of itself require a formal date line to be established, and Rabbi Kasher does not seem to think that it is necessary to do so. But the ''de facto'' result of this position is consistent with the conventional International Date Line, at least anywhere there is an established Jewish community.&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt;{{refn|Rabbi Shurpin&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt;{{rp|Note 14}} and Gewirtz&lt;ref name=gewirtz/&gt;{{rp|Note 4}} provide treatments as to how [[International Date Line#Historical alterations|changes in the location of the International Date Line]] might affect its use as a ''de facto'' standard in Jewish Law.}}

===Practical rulings===
In practice, the conventional International Date Line (or another mid-Pacific line near it) is the ''de facto'' date line under Jewish law, at least for established Jewish communities. The communities of Japan,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jccjapan.or.jp/ Jewish Community of Japan], [http://www.jcckobe.org/ Jewish Community of Kansai]&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chc.org.nz/ Canterbury Hebrew Congregation], [http://ahc.org.nz/category/events/ Auckland Hebrew Congregation]&lt;/ref&gt; Hawaii,&lt;ref&gt;[http://sofmaarav.org/ Congregation Sof Maarav], [http://www.mauijews.org/#!events/c17et Jewish Congregation of Maui]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[French Polynesia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harris|first1=Andrew|title=Shabbat in Tahiti paradise|url=http://www.jewishnews.net.au/shabbat-in-tahiti-paradise/14535|accessdate=27 April 2016|work=The Australian Jewish News|date=July 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; all observe Shabbat on local Saturday ''(i.e.,'' Friday night until Saturday night). No known Jewish community observes Shabbat on a day other than local Saturday.&lt;ref name=jta&gt;The one arguable exception is [[Samoa]], which moved from the east side of the International Date Line to the west side around New Year's Day 2012. The [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]] located one relatively observant Jewish individual living on Samoa, who said at the time that he would follow the lead of local [[Seventh-Day Adventist]] churches and light Shabbat candles on Saturday night. (See {{cite news|last1=Soclof|first1=Adam|title=Samoa time warps into Shabbat|url=http://www.jta.org/2012/01/03/the-archive-blog/samoa-time-warps-into-shabbat|accessdate=27 April 2016|agency=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|date=3 January 2012|postscript=.)}} However, the practice of a single individual may not be sufficient to establish a community practice in Jewish law.&lt;/ref&gt; However, that practical conclusion is reached in two different ways, resulting in somewhat different practice patterns in each case.

'''''Following local custom/There is no fixed date line.''''' As noted above, according to this point of view, Shabbat is simply observed on the date previously established as Shabbat by the local community—uniformly, local Saturday&lt;ref name=jta/&gt;—without any need for any further observance. This appears to be the default practice for residents of such places as Japan, New Zealand and Hawaii. At minimum, it is difficult to find evidence of other practices by residents of those areas.&lt;ref name=worker&gt;See, as an anecdotal example, {{cite web|title=The international dateline and halacha|url=http://jewishworker.blogspot.com/2005/09/international-dateline-and-halacha.html|website=The Jewish Worker|accessdate=27 April 2016|postscript=;}} search the page for "NZ".&lt;!--This is a blog, and the pertinent comment was in the responses, not in the blog post itself. As a source, it doesn't really qualify as a RS, and it is intended to be illustrative, rather than definitive. But there is little in the way of reliable evidence, which is not surprising given that one is essentially trying to prove a negative.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Taken to a fully logical conclusion, ''no fixed date line'' means that anyone in a location without an established tradition of which day is Shabbat should always depend on his own personal count of days. It is not clear whether this can currently apply to someone traveling on his or her own to an island in the Western Pacific without an established tradition. (See, for example, Rabbi Shurpin {{refn|name=chabad}} at the end of the section "The Samoa issue".) However, it seems clear that at minimum one construes an "established community" relatively broadly. So while Japan, for example, has only a scattered handful of synagogues, their uniform practice of observing Shabbat on Saturday seems sufficient to fix Saturday as the established day for Shabbat anywhere in Japan.}}

'''''Establishment of a date line by a majority among three halakhic positions.''''' The travelers' guide of the [[Star-K]] kosher supervision service, compiled according to the rulings of its rabbinic administrator, Rabbi [[Moshe Heinemann]], uses the following approach,&lt;ref name=kashrus/&gt; which is also cited by others. According to this approach, the [[#90|first three numbered sections above]] constitute three valid, parallel, ''halakhic'' rulings. Shabbat is consequently fully observed on whichever day is consistent with the majority view among those opinions (two out of three). However, out of respect to the minority view of the third ruling, and with an eye toward not desecrating Shabbat, [[Melacha|Torah-level prohibitions]] are to be avoided on the day consistent with the minority view, although that day is otherwise considered a weekday. According to this rule, practice is as follows: 
* In New Zealand and Japan, the local Saturday is Shabbat according to the majority opinion (sections 2 and 3 above), and it should therefore be fully observed as Shabbat. However, since according to the minority opinion (section 1 above), Shabbat is on the local Sunday, one should not perform any Torah-level Shabbat prohibitions on Sunday. Nevertheless, on Sunday, one should pray the regular weekday prayers, donning [[tefillin]] during morning prayers.
* In Hawaii and French Polynesia, the local Saturday is Shabbat according to majority opinion (sections 1 and 3 above), and it should therefore be fully observed as Shabbat. However, since according to the minority opinion (section 2 above), Shabbat is on the local Friday, one should not perform any Torah-level Shabbat prohibitions on Friday. Friday prayers are weekday prayers, and preparation for Shabbat must be done with an eye to avoiding Torah-level Shabbat prohibitions.&lt;ref name=kashrus/&gt; 
* In principle, a zone of pure doubt exists in approximately the area of 169°W–177°E,&lt;ref name=map/&gt; including places like [[Tonga]], Samoa and [[American Samoa]]. The rulings of the ''Mid-Pacific'' group above are not perfectly consistent in this area,&lt;ref name=kashrus/&gt; so there is no possibility of an unambiguous "two out of three" consensus here. Rabbi Dovid Heber of the Star-K suggests that in such locations one might need to observe Shabbat fully for two days every week.&lt;ref name="heber2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Heber|first1=Rabbi Dovid|title=How to Keep This Shabbos in Samoa? STAR-K Tells Us How (Samoa &amp; Tokelau To Cross International Date Line)|url=http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/headlines-breaking-stories/113307/how-to-keep-this-shabbos-in-samoa-star-k-tells-us-how-samoa-tokelau-to-cross-international-date-line.html|website=The Yeshiva World News|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Star-K's international kosher supervision staff follows this approach, and there is evidence that some other travelers also do.&lt;ref name=worker/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Dateline|url=http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.culture.religion.jewish.avodah/26561|website=avodah@aishdas.com|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authorities suggesting this approach often advise travelers to avoid the zone of doubt entirely near weekends, or to consult with a competent rabbinical authority directly.&lt;ref name=heber2/&gt;

==Crossing the halakhic date line==
The issues discussed in the previous section apply ''per se'' to individuals or communities in fixed locations. However, the act of crossing the date line (wherever it may be drawn) introduces a number of additional issues under Jewish law. Questions potentially affected include:&lt;ref name=kashrus/&gt;
{{div col}}
*Crossing the line into or out of Shabbat or a holiday, or a [[Ta'anit|rabbinic fast day]], while already aboard an airplane or a ship
*Determining what prayers to say (and when) while in transit
*Lighting candles on [[Hanukkah]]
*[[Counting of the Omer]], and consequently fixing the day for [[Shavuot]]
*[[Niddah|Counting days until relations are permitted following menstruation]]
*Fixing the date for [[Brit Milah]], [[Pidyon Haben]] or [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah]]
{{div col end}}
In some cases, crossing the date line (wherever it may be drawn) has a specific impact on practice or prohibitions under Jewish law. In others, an individual's count of days (by the experience of sunset and sunrise) is the determining factor, regardless of the crossing of the date line. Details around specific questions, cases and rulings of Jewish law are beyond the scope of this article.{{refn|See Taplin&lt;ref name="taarich" /&gt;, which covers these questions in some detail. The author notes that there are consensus opinions about some—but not all—of these issues.}}

==Considerations for astronauts==
Before Israeli astronaut [[Ilan Ramon]] flew on the [[Space Shuttle Columbia|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'']] in 2003, he decided (after consultation with rabbis) to observe Shabbat according to time in his last residence, [[Kennedy Space Center|Cape Canaveral]], since he would be crossing the date line and observing sunset many times per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Ask the rabbi: Shabbat in space|date=18 January 2003|website=ohr.edu|publisher=[[Ohr Somayach, Jerusalem]]|url=https://ohr.edu/explore_judaism/ask_the_rabbi/ask_the_rabbi/637|accessdate=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|work=[[Jewish Virtual Library]]|title=Ilan Ramon|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/ilan-ramon|date=February 2, 2003|accessdate=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=standard /&gt; [[Judith Resnik]], the first American Jewish astronaut in space, lit (electronic) Shabbat candles according to the time in [[Johnson Space Center|Houston, TX]], her home and the location of [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|Mission Control]].&lt;ref name=standard&gt;{{cite web|title=Jewish Astronauts|author=Warren Boroson|date=26 January 2015|website=Jewish Standard|url=http://jewishstandard.timesofisrael.com/jewish-asttronauts/|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:N2 Lichen.jpg|thumb|right|Crustose lichens on a wall]]

'''Lichen morphology''' includes [[lichen growth forms]] used to group lichens by "vegetative" [[thallus]] types, and forms of "non-vegetative" reproductive parts. Some lichen thalli have the aspect of leaves (foliose lichens); others cover the [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]] like a crust (crustose lichens) (''illustration, right''), others such as the genus ''[[Ramalina]]'' adopt shrubby forms (fruticose lichens), and there are gelatinous lichens such as the genus ''[[Collema]]''.&lt;ref name=Smith1929&gt;{{cite book |author=Smith, A.L. |year=1929 |title=Lichens |publisher=Cambridge University Press |series=Cambridge Botanical Handbooks |isbn=0-916422-33-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the form of a lichen is determined by the [[DNA|genetic material]] of the fungal partner, association with a photobiont is required for the development of that form.  When grown in the laboratory in the absence of its photobiont, a lichen fungus develops as an undifferentiated mass of [[hypha]]e. If combined with its photobiont under appropriate conditions, its characteristic form emerges, in the process called [[morphogenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;Brodo, Sharnoff &amp; Sharnoff, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; In a few remarkable cases, a single lichen fungus can develop into two very different lichen forms when associating with either a green algal or a cyanobacterial symbiont. Quite naturally, these alternative forms were at first considered to be different species, until they were found growing in a conjoined manner.

There is evidence to suggest that the lichen symbiosis is [[parasitism|parasitic]] or [[commensalism|commensalistic]], rather than [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]].&lt;ref name=Ahmadjian&gt;Ahmadjian 1993&lt;/ref&gt; The photosynthetic partner can exist in nature independently of the fungal partner, but not vice versa. Furthermore, photobiont cells are routinely destroyed in the course of [[nutrient]] exchange. The association is able to continue because reproduction of the photobiont cells matches the rate at which they are destroyed.&lt;ref name=Ahmadjian/&gt;

Under magnification, a section through a typical foliose lichen [[Thallus (tissue)|thallus]] reveals four layers of interlaced fungal filaments. The uppermost layer is formed by densely agglutinated fungal hyphae building a protective outer layer called the [[Cortex (botany)|cortex]], which can reach several hundred μm in thickness.&lt;ref name=Budel1996&gt;{{cite journal| author = Büdel, B.|author2=Scheidegger, C. | year = 1996| title = Thallus morphology and anatomy| journal = Lichen Biology| pages = 37–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; This cortex may be further topped by an epicortex 0.6-1μm thick in some Parmeliaceae, which may be with or without pores, and is secreted by cells—it is not itself cellular.&lt;ref name=Budel1996/&gt; In lichens that include both green algal and cyanobacterial symbionts, the cyanobacteria may be held on the upper or lower surface in small pustules called [[cephalodium|cephalodia]]. Beneath the upper cortex is an algal layer composed of algal cells embedded in rather densely interwoven fungal hyphae. Each cell or group of cells of the photobiont is usually individually wrapped by hyphae, and in some cases penetrated by an [[haustorium]]. Beneath this algal layer is a third layer of loosely interwoven fungal hyphae without algal cells. This layer is called the [[wikt:medulla|medulla]]. Beneath the medulla, the bottom surface resembles the upper surface and is called the [[lower cortex]], again consisting of densely packed fungal hyphae. The lower cortex of [[foliose]] lichens often bears rootlike fungal structures known as [[rhizines]], which serve to attach the thallus to the substrate on which it grows. Lichens also sometimes contain structures made from fungal [[metabolite]]s, for example crustose lichens sometimes have a [[polysaccharide]] layer in the cortex. Although each lichen thallus generally appears homogeneous, some evidence seems to suggest that the fungal component may consist of more than one genetic individual of that species. This seems to also be true of the photobiont species involved.

A [[podetium]] (plural [[podetia]]) is a lichenized stem-like structure of an [[apothecium]] rising from the primary body of the thallus.&lt;ref name=ASLGPZ&gt;[http://www.lichens.lastdragon.org/faq/glossary3.html Alan Silverside's Lichen Glossary (p-z), Alan Silverside]&lt;/ref&gt; Since it is part of the reproductive tissue, it is not considered part of the thallus.&lt;ref name=ASLGPZ/&gt; The podetium may be branched, and sometimes cup-like. It usually bears the [[pycnidia]] or [[apothecia]] or both.

'''''Living Witchcraft: A Contemporary American Coven''''' is a [[sociology|sociological]] study of an American [[coven]] of [[Wicca]]ns who operated in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] during the early 1990s. It was co-written by the sociologist Allen Scarboro, psychologist Nancy Campbell and literary critic Shirley Stave and first published by [[Praeger Publishers|Praeger]] in 1994. Although largely sociological, the study was interdisciplinary, and included both insider and outsider perspectives into the coven; Stave was an initiate and a practicing Wiccan while Scarboro and Campbell remained non-initiates throughout the course of their research.

The trio became friends after meeting at an academic seminar devoted to the study of religion held at [[Emory University]], Atlanta in 1990. Stave subsequently revealed herself to the group as a Wiccan, a member of a [[new religious movement]] that interested Scarboro and Campbell, and together the three decided to undertake a study of the Wiccan coven to which Stave belonged. This, the Ravenwood coven, met in the local area, where it was led by a High Priestess named Lady Sintana. Learning of their proposals, Lady Sintana gave them her permission to attend the coven's rituals, classes and open houses and also to interview its members.

Divided into three parts, ''Living Witchcraft'' offers a sociological investigation of a coven of Wiccans located in Atlanta known as Ravenwood.

==Background==

===Wicca in the United States===

Contemporary Paganism, which is also referred to as Neo-Paganism, is an [[umbrella term]] used to identify a wide variety of [[new religious movement|modern religious movements]], particularly those influenced by or claiming to be derived from the various [[Paganism|pagan]] beliefs of pre-modern Europe.&lt;ref name="Carpenter 1996 40"&gt;[[#Car96|Carpenter 1996]]. p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lew04|Lewis 2004]]. p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The religion of Pagan Witchcraft, or [[Wicca]], was developed in England during the first half of the 20th century and is one of several pagan religions. The figure at the forefront of Wicca's early development was the English occultist [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]] (1884&amp;ndash;1964), the author of ''[[Witchcraft Today]]'' (1954) and ''[[The Meaning of Witchcraft]]'' (1959) and the founder of a tradition known as [[Gardnerian Wicca]]. Gardnerian Wicca revolved around the veneration of both a [[Horned God]] and a [[Mother Goddess]], the celebration of eight seasonally-based festivals in a [[Wheel of the Year]] and the practice of magical rituals in groups known as [[coven]]s. Gardnerianism was subsequently brought to the U.S. in the early 1960s by an English initiate, [[Raymond Buckland]] (1934&amp;ndash;), and his then-wife Rosemary, who together founded a coven on [[Long Island]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]] pp. 205&amp;ndash;252.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cli06|Clifton 2006]]. pp. 24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., new variants of Wicca developed, including [[Dianic Wicca]], a tradition founded in the 1970s which was influenced by [[second wave feminism]], emphasized female-only covens, and rejected the veneration of the Horned God. One initiate of both the Dianic and Gardnerian traditions was a woman known as [[Starhawk]] (1951&amp;ndash;) who went on to found her own tradition, [[Reclaiming (Neopaganism)|Reclaiming Wicca]], as well as publishing ''[[The Spiral Dance|The Spiral Dance: a Rebirth of the Ancient Religion of the Great Goddess]]'' (1979), a book which helped spread Wicca throughout the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]]. pp. 340&amp;ndash;351&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cli06|Clifton 2006]]. pp. 122&amp;ndash;123&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic fieldwork into Wicca===

Prior to the authors' work, several American researchers working in the field of [[Pagan studies]] had separately published investigations of the Pagan community in both the United States and the United Kingdom. The first of these had been the practicing Wiccan, journalist and political activist [[Margot Adler]] in her ''[[Drawing Down the Moon (book)|Drawing Down the Moon: Witches, Druids, Goddess-Worshippers, and Other Pagans in America Today]]'', which was first published by [[Viking Press]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Adl79|Adler 1979]].&lt;/ref&gt; A second study was produced by the anthropologist [[Tanya Luhrmann|Tanya M. Luhrmann]] in her ''[[Persuasions of the Witch's Craft|Persuasions of the Witch's Craft: Ritual Magic in Contemporary England]]'' (1989), in which she focused on both a Wiccan coven and several ceremonial magic orders that were then operating in London.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Luh89|Luhrmann 1989]].&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time as Scarboro, Campbell and Stave were undertaking their research, the American anthropologist and practicing Wiccan Loretta Orion was also undertaking an investigation into the Pagan movement in the East Coast and Midwest of the United States. Orion's work would come to be published as ''[[Never Again the Burning Times|Never Again the Burning Times: Paganism Revisited]]'' by Waveland Press in 1995, although would be heavily criticized in reviews written by both Luhrmann and T.O. Beidelman, both of whom were of the opinion that Orion's Pagan beliefs had clouded her critical interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;See [[#Ori95|Orion 1995]], and also [[#Bei95|Beidelman 1995]] and [[#Luh96|Luhrmann 1996]].&lt;/ref&gt; The sociologist [[Helen A. Berger]] of the [[West Chester University of Pennsylvania]] had also been undertaking fieldwork among the Wiccan community of [[New England]] during that decade, having developed an interest in researching the subject in 1986. The results of Berger's 11 years of research would come to be published by the [[University of South Carolina Press]] in 1999 as ''[[A Community of Witches|A Community of Witches: Contemporary Neo-Paganism and Witchcraft in the United States]]'', to predominantly positive academic reviews.&lt;ref&gt;See [[#Ber99|Berger 1999]], and also [[#Fol99|Foltz 1999]], [[#Gla99|Glazier 1999]], [[#Kos99|Kostarelos 1999]], [[#Sch00|Schnurbein 2000]] and [[#Nei00|Neitz 2000]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scarboro, Campbell, Stave and their research===

The project that resulted in ''Living Witchcraft'' originated at a seminar led by Robert Detweiler, a professor at [[Emory University]]'s Graduate Institute of the Liberal Arts. Sponsored by the [[Dana Foundation]], the seminar took place in Autumn 1990, and involved six professors from various U.S. colleges meeting together in Atlanta to share their research into various different aspects of religion and discuss conceptions of [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|duality between the mind and the body]].&lt;ref name="Scarboro ix"/&gt; One of the academics attending the seminar, Shirley "Holly" Stave, a literary critic and untenured faculty member at Emory, soon admitted to the group that she was a practicing Wiccan, and told them of her belief that her religion could provide "a way of reuniting mind and body."&lt;ref name="Scarboro ix"/&gt; Stave later explained to the group that she felt "moved" by "Spirit" to inform them of her own spiritual beliefs, in spite of the discrimination that this could bring upon her in the largely Christian state of Georgia. She also felt that in helping to educate others about Wiccan beliefs, it would ultimately help to prevent the misinformation and persecution that many Wiccans faced.&lt;ref name="Scarboro x"&gt;[[#Scar94|Scarboro, Campbell and Stave 1994]]. p. x.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the other academics attending the seminar were already familiar with the Wiccan movement. Allen Scarboro, then studying the [[sociology of religion]], had previously undertaken magico-religious practices with two Native American shamans, and had a basic knowledge of various new religious movements including Wicca, while Nancy Campbell, an academic psychologist, had previously attended the rituals of a feminist Wiccan group. Wanting to learn more about the faith, Scarboro and Campbell approached Stave, asking her if they could witness any of the rituals performed by her coven, which was known as Ravenwood. After gaining the permission of the coven's High Priestess, Lady Sintana, they attended the group's [[Sabbat]] rite at [[Hallowmas]], later deciding that they wanted to undertake research into the group for an interdisciplinary project, imagining that it would result in an extended [[academic paper]].&lt;ref name="Scarboro x"/&gt;

Agreeing to their proposals, the only two constraints that Lady Sintana imposed on the researchers was that Scarboro and Campbell, the two non-initiates, could not "observe, know, or report the text for the circle-building procedures that immediately precede and prepare the energy circle for rituals", and that they also could not attend initiation rituals or learn the text for the Ravenwood initiation rites. These things, Lady Sintana maintained, were secrets that only those initiated into the coven could know.&lt;ref name="Scarboro xi-xii"&gt;[[#Scar94|Scarboro, Campbell and Stave 1994]]. pp. xi&amp;ndash;xii.&lt;/ref&gt; In putting together their [[research design]], the trio were aided by Robin Ingalls, a student with a background in psychology and spirituality who was studying at [[Georgia State University]], while another student, Gilbert Bond, who was then studying at Emory University's Graduate Institute of Liberal Arts, also aided them in their research.&lt;ref name="Scarboro xii"&gt;[[#Scar94|Scarboro, Campbell and Stave 1994]]. p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt; The group began their project in October 1990, having gathered most of their data by June 1991, by which time they had also written early drafts for several chapters of what would later come to be published as ''Living Witchcraft'' in 1994.&lt;ref name="Scarboro xii"/&gt;

==Synopsis==

===Part I: Ravenwood: A Living Atlanta Coven===
The first part of ''Living Witchcraft'' was devoted to describing the ritual activities which members of the Ravenwood coven took part in.&lt;ref name="Scarboro 1-2"&gt;[[#Scar94|Scarboro, Campbell and Stave 1994]]. pp. 1&amp;ndash;2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments==

===Insider/outsider dichotomy===
Regarding their approach to fieldwork, the authors noted that they had given "serious consideration" to whether Stave, being a practicing Wiccan, could be [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] in her participation in the study. However, as they later noted, "poststructural theoretical perspective[s]" had shown that "pure objectivity is never possible", and that the "context of each researcher &amp;ndash; gender, race, socioeconomic level, sexual orientation, one's biography as a whole &amp;ndash; shapes that person's understanding."&lt;ref name="Scarboro xi"&gt;[[#Scar94|Scarboro, Campbell and Stave 1994]]. p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than aiming to achieve a positivist objectivity, they instead focused on achieving what American anthropologist [[Clifford Geertz]] (1926&amp;ndash;2006) referred to as a "[[thick description]]" in his book ''The Interpretation of Cultures'' (1973). This "thick description" approach would not only present the Wiccans themselves in a manner that they would recognize, but also related what a "non-Witch, specifically a thinking, reflective, non-Witch, would experience were she or he to participate in rituals and classes at Ravenwood."&lt;ref name="Scarboro xi"/&gt;

==Reception and recognition==

===Academic reviews===
The anthropologist [[Tanya Luhrmann]] (1959&amp;ndash;) of the [[University of California, San Diego]], published a review of both ''Living Witchcraft'' and Loretta Orion's ''[[Never Again the Burning Times]]'' (1995) in the ''Journal of Anthropological Research''. Noting that ''Living Witchcraft'' was "as sympathetic to the practice" of Wicca as Orion's study, she believed however that it had the advantage of being "written from the more distanced stand of the participant-observer as understood in mainstream anthropology." In focusing in on one particular coven rather than trying to provide a broader study of the Wiccan movement, Luhrmann felt that ''Living Witchcraft'' had provided a study which was "unusual and fascinating and remarkably rich in its detail." She proceeded to note that in her opinion, the "eye-opening" feature of the book was its examination of what life was like for public Witches living in the [[Deep South]], a predominantly conservative and Christian part of the United States. In summing up her review, Luhrmann stated that "witchcraft remains an important study for anthropological research, if only because so many people have such peculiar ideas about it."&lt;ref name="Luhrmann 1996"&gt;[[#Luh96|Luhrmann 1996]].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5934">[[File:Balancedbeam.jpeg|right|thumb|200px|Beam balanced around a fulcrum]]

A [[simple machine]] that exhibits [[mechanical advantage]] is called a '''mechanical advantage device''' - e.g.:

* [[Lever]]: The [[Beam (structure)|beam]] shown is in static equilibrium around the [[wikt:fulcrum|fulcrum]]. This is due to the [[Moment (physics)|moment]] created by vector force ''"A"'' counterclockwise (moment ''A''*a) being in equilibrium with the moment created by vector force ''"B"'' clockwise (moment ''B''*b). The relatively low vector force ''"B"'' is translated in a relatively high vector force ''"A"''. The force is thus increased in the ratio of the forces ''A : B'', which is equal to the ratio of the distances to the fulcrum ''b : a''. This ratio is called the mechanical advantage. This idealised situation does not take into account friction.
* [[Wheel and axle]] motion (e.g. [[screwdriver]]s, [[doorknob]]s): A wheel is essentially a lever with one arm the distance between the axle and the outer point of the wheel, and the other the radius of the axle. Typically this is a fairly large difference, leading to a proportionately large mechanical advantage.  This allows even simple wheels with wooden axles running in wooden blocks to still turn freely, because their [[friction]] is overwhelmed by the rotational force of the wheel multiplied by the mechanical advantage.
* A [[block and tackle]] of multiple [[pulley]]s creates mechanical advantage, by having the flexible material looped over several pulleys in turn. Adding more loops and pulleys increases the mechanical advantage.
* [[Screw]]: A screw is essentially an [[inclined plane]] wrapped around a cylinder. The run over the rise of this inclined plane is the mechanical advantage of a screw.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, pp. 69–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pulleys==

[[File:Four pulleys.svg|thumb|450px|Examples of rope and pulley systems illustrating mechanical advantage.]]

Consider lifting a weight with rope and pulleys. A rope looped through a pulley attached to a fixed spot, e.g. a barn roof rafter, and attached to the weight is called a ''single pulley''.  It has a mechanical advantage (MA) = 1 (assuming frictionless bearings in the pulley), moving no mechanical advantage (or disadvantage) however advantageous the change in direction may be.

A ''single movable pulley'' has an MA of 2 (assuming frictionless bearings in the pulley).  Consider a pulley attached to a weight being lifted. A rope passes around it, with one end attached to a fixed point above, e.g. a barn roof rafter, and a pulling force is applied upward to the other end with the two lengths parallel.  In this situation the distance the lifter must pull the rope becomes twice the distance the weight travels, allowing the force applied to be halved.  Note: if an additional pulley is used to change the direction of the rope, e.g. the person doing the work wants to stand on the ground instead of on a rafter, the mechanical advantage is not increased.

By looping more ropes around more pulleys we can construct a block and tackle to continue to increase the mechanical advantage. For example, if we have two pulleys attached to the rafter, two pulleys attached to the weight, one end attached to the rafter, and someone standing on the rafter pulling the rope, we have a mechanical advantage of four. Again note: if we add another pulley so that someone may stand on the ground and pull down, we still have a mechanical advantage of four.

Here are examples where the fixed point is not obvious:
* A velcro strap on a shoe passes through a slot and folds over on itself. The slot is a movable pulley and the MA = 2.
* Two ropes laid down a ramp attached to a raised platform. A barrel is rolled onto the ropes and the ropes are passed over the barrel and handed to two workers at the top of the ramp. The workers pull the ropes together to get the barrel to the top. The barrel is a movable pulley and the MA = 2. If there is enough friction where the rope is pinched between the barrel and the ramp, the pinch point becomes the attachment point.  This is considered a fixed attachment point because the rope above the barrel does not move relative to the ramp. Alternatively the ends of the rope can be attached to the platform.

==Screws==

The theoretical mechanical advantage for a screw can be calculated using the following equation:&lt;ref&gt;United States Bureau of Naval Personnel, p. 5-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;MA = \frac{\pi d_m}{l}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:''d&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' = the mean diameter of the screw thread
:''l'' = the [[lead (engineering)|lead]] of the screw thread

Note that the actual mechanical advantage of a screw ''system'' is greater, as a screwdriver or other screw driving system has a mechanical advantage as well.

* [[Inclined plane]]: MA = length of slope ÷ height of the slope

The '''mind''' is a set of [[cognition|cognitive]] faculties including [[consciousness]], [[perception]], [[thought|thinking]], [[judgement]], [[language]] and [[memory]]. It is usually defined as the faculty of an entity's thoughts and consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/mind|title=mind – definition of mind in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2017-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It holds the power of imagination, recognition, and appreciation, and is responsible for processing feelings and emotions, resulting in attitudes and actions.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

There is a lengthy tradition in [[philosophy of mind|philosophy]], [[religion]], [[psychology]], and [[cognitive science]] about what constitutes a mind and what are its distinguishing properties.

One open question regarding the nature of the mind is the [[mind–body problem]], which investigates the relation of the mind to the physical [[brain]] and nervous system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Older viewpoints included [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] and [[idealism]], which considered the mind somehow non-physical.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mindware|last=Clark|first=Andy|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-19-982815-9|location=198 Madison Avenue, New York, 10016|pages=14, 254–256|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern views often center around [[physicalism]] and [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]], which hold that the mind is roughly identical with the brain or [[Reductionism|reducible]] to physical phenomena such as [[neuron|neuronal activity]]&lt;ref&gt;Smart, J.J.C., "The Mind/Brain Identity Theory", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2011 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2011/entries/mind-identity/]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=December 2016}}, though dualism and idealism continue to have many supporters. Another question concerns which types of [[being]]s are capable of having minds (New Scientist 8 September 2018 p10).{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} For example, whether mind is exclusive to humans, possessed also by some or all [[animals]], by all [[life|living things]], whether it is a strictly definable characteristic at all, or whether mind can also be a property of some types of [[artificial intelligence|human-made machines]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Whatever its nature, it is generally agreed that mind is that which enables a being to have [[subjectivity|subjective]] [[awareness]] and [[intentionality]] towards their environment, to [[perceive]] and respond to [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]] with some kind of [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]], and to have consciousness, including thinking and [[feeling]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The concept of mind is understood in many different ways by many different cultural and religious traditions. Some see mind as a property exclusive to humans whereas others ascribe properties of mind to non-living entities (e.g. [[panpsychism]] and [[animism]]), to animals and to [[deity|deities]]. Some of the earliest recorded speculations linked mind (sometimes described as identical with [[soul]] or [[spirit]]) to theories concerning both [[life after death]], and [[cosmology|cosmological]] and [[Nature (philosophy)|natural]] order, for example in the doctrines of [[Zoroaster]], [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]], Plato, [[Aristotle]], and other ancient [[Greek philosophy|Greek]], [[Indian philosophy|Indian]] and, later, [[Islamic psychological thought|Islamic]] and medieval European philosophers.

Important philosophers of mind include [[Plato]], [[Patanjali]], [[René Descartes|Descartes]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], [[John Locke|Locke]], [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]], [[David Hume|Hume]], [[Kant]], [[Hegel]], [[Schopenhauer]], [[John Searle|Searle]], [[Daniel Dennett|Dennett]], [[Jerry Fodor|Fodor]], [[Thomas Nagel|Nagel]], and [[David Chalmers|Chalmers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2016/01/20-most-important-philosophers-of-mind-since-wwii.html | title=20 "Most Important" Philosophers of Mind since WWII}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists such as [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] and [[William James|James]], and [[computer science|computer scientists]] such as [[Alan Turing|Turing]] and [[Hilary Putnam|Putnam]] developed influential theories about the nature of the mind. The possibility of nonbiological minds is explored in the field of [[artificial intelligence]], which works closely in relation with [[cybernetics]] and [[information theory]] to understand the ways in which information processing by nonbiological machines is comparable or different to mental phenomena in the human mind.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The mind is also portrayed as the [[Stream of consciousness (psychology)|stream of consciousness]] where sense impressions and mental phenomena are constantly changing&lt;ref name=Karunamuni2017&gt;{{cite journal |author= Karunamuni N, Weerasekera R. |title= Theoretical Foundations to Guide Mindfulness Meditation: A Path to Wisdom |journal= Current Psychology |date=Jun 2017 | doi= 10.1007/s12144-017-9631-7|url= http://mindrxiv.org/mfs63/ |type= Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Aggregates&gt;{{cite journal|author= Karunamuni N.D.|title=The Five-Aggregate Model of the Mind|journal=SAGE Open|volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=215824401558386|date=May 2015 | url= http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/spsgo/5/2/2158244015583860.full.pdf | doi=10.1177/2158244015583860}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The original meaning of [[Old English]] ''[[:wikt:gemynd|gemynd]]'' was the faculty of [[memory]], not of thought in general.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} Hence ''call to mind'', ''come to mind'', ''keep in mind'', ''to have mind of'', etc. The word retains this sense in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/mind|title=mind – definition of mind in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2017-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Old English]] had other words to express "mind", such as ''[[:wikt:hyge|hyge]]'' "mind, spirit".{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The meaning of "memory" is shared with [[Old Norse]], which has ''[[Muninn|munr]]''. The word is originally from a [[PIE]] verbal root ''{{PIE|*men-}}'', meaning "to think, remember", whence also Latin'' [[:wikt:mens#Latin|mens]]'' "mind", Sanskrit ''[[:wikt:मनस्|{{IAST|manas}}]]'' "mind" and Greek [[:wikt:μένος|μένος]] "mind, courage, anger".

The generalization of ''mind'' to include all mental faculties, thought, [[Volition (psychology)|volition]], feeling and memory, gradually develops over the 14th and 15th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=mind|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com|access-date=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
The attributes that make up the mind are debated. Some psychologists argue that only the "higher" intellectual functions constitute mind, particularly reason and [[memory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Başar|first1=Erol|title=Brain body mind oscillations in scope of uncertainty principle|date=2010|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-1441961365|page=5|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NAbMHo-ux58C&amp;pg=PA5&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;dq=Some+psychologists+argue+that+only+the+%22higher%22+intellectual+functions+constitute+mind,+particularly+reason+and+memory#v=onepage&amp;q=Some%20psychologists%20argue%20that%20only%20the%20%22higher%22%20intellectual%20functions%20constitute%20mind%2C%20particularly%20reason%20and%20memory&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this view the emotions — [[love]], [[hate]], [[fear]], and [[joy]] — are more ''primitive ''or subjective in nature and should be seen as different from the mind as such. Others argue that various rational and emotional states cannot be so separated, that they are of the same nature and origin, and should therefore be considered all part of it as mind.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

In popular usage, ''mind ''is frequently synonymous with ''thought'': the private conversation with ourselves that we carry on "inside our heads."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Israel|first1=Richard|last2=North|first2=Vanda|title=Mind Chi Re-wire Your Brain in 8 Minutes a Day ; Strategies for Success in Business and Life|date=2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Chichester|isbn=978-1907321375|page=12|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VCP63CWtVqIC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=mind+is+frequently+synonymous+with+thought:#v=onepage&amp;q=mind%20is%20frequently%20synonymous%20with%20thought%3A&amp;f=false|accessdate=18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus we "make up our minds," "change our minds" or are "of two minds" about something. One of the key attributes of the mind in this sense is that it is a private sphere to which no one but the owner has access. No one else can "know our mind." They can only interpret what we consciously or unconsciously communicate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Masters|first1=Frances|title=Harness your Amazingly Creative Mind|url=http://www.thefusionmodel.com/harness-amazingly-creative-mind/|website=www.thefusionmodel.com|accessdate=18 April 2015|date=2014-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mental faculties==
{{See also|Nous|Reason|Modularity of mind|Mental process}}

Broadly speaking, mental faculties are the various functions of the mind, or things the mind can "do".

[[Thought]] is a mental act that allows humans to make sense of things in the world, and to represent and interpret them in ways that are significant, or which accord with their needs, attachments, goals, commitments, plans, ends, desires, etc. Thinking involves the [[symbol]]ic or [[semiotic]] mediation of [[idea]]s or data, as when we form [[concept]]s, engage in [[problem solving]], reasoning, and making [[choice|decisions]]. Words that refer to similar concepts and processes include [[deliberation]], [[cognition]], [[idea]]tion, [[discourse]] and [[imagination]].

Thinking is sometimes described as a "higher" [[cognitive]] function and the analysis of thinking processes is a part of [[cognitive psychology]]. It is also deeply connected with our capacity to make and use [[tools]]; to understand [[causality|cause and effect]]; to recognize patterns of significance; to comprehend and [[world disclosure|disclose]] unique contexts of experience or activity; and to respond to the world in a meaningful way.

[[Memory]] is the ability to preserve, retain, and subsequently recall, knowledge, information or experience. Although memory has traditionally been a persistent theme in [[philosophy]], the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries also saw the study of memory emerge as a subject of inquiry within the paradigms of [[cognitive psychology]]. In recent decades, it has become one of the pillars of a new branch of science called [[cognitive neuroscience]], a marriage between cognitive psychology and [[neuroscience]].

[[Imagination]] is the activity of generating or evoking novel situations, [[image]]s, ideas or other [[qualia]] in the mind. It is a characteristically [[Subjectivity|subjective]] ''activity'', rather than a direct or passive experience. The term is technically used in [[psychology]] for the process of reviving in the mind [[perception|percepts]] of objects formerly given in sense perception. Since this use of the term conflicts with that of ordinary [[language]], some psychologists have preferred to describe this process as "[[wikt:Imaging|imaging]]" or "[[wikt:Imagery|imagery]]" or to speak of it as "reproductive" as opposed to "productive" or "constructive" imagination. Things imagined are said to be seen in the "[[mind's eye]]". Among the many practical functions of imagination are the ability to project possible futures (or histories), to "see" things from another's perspective, and to change the way something is perceived, including to make decisions to respond to, or enact, what is imagined.

[[Consciousness]] in mammals (this includes humans) is an aspect of the mind generally thought to comprise qualities such as [[subjectivity]], [[sentience]], and the ability to [[perception|perceive]] the relationship between [[Personal identity|oneself]] and one's [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. It is a subject of much research in [[philosophy of mind]], [[psychology]], [[neuroscience]], and [[cognitive science]]. Some philosophers divide consciousness into [[phenomena]]l consciousness, which is subjective experience itself, and access consciousness, which refers to the global availability of information to processing systems in the brain.&lt;ref name="Bl"&gt;Ned Block: "On a Confusion about a Function of Consciousness" in: ''The Behavioral and Brain Sciences'', 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Phenomenal consciousness has many different experienced qualities, often referred to as [[qualia]]. Phenomenal consciousness is usually consciousness ''of'' something or ''about'' something, a property known as [[intentionality]] in philosophy of mind.

==Mental content==
Mental contents are those items that are thought of as being "in" the mind, and capable of being formed and manipulated by mental processes and faculties. Examples include [[thought]]s, [[concept]]s, [[memories]], [[emotion]]s, [[percept]]s and [[intention]]s. Philosophical theories of mental content include [[internalism]], [[externalism]], [[direct and indirect realism|representationalism]] and [[intentionality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/content-narrow/ | title=Narrow Mental Content | publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memetics===
[[Memetics]] is a theory of mental content based on an analogy with [[Darwinian evolution]], which was originated by [[Richard Dawkins]] and [[Douglas Hofstadter]] in the 1980s. It is an [[evolutionary model]] of cultural [[information transfer]]. A [[meme]], analogous to a [[gene]], is an idea, belief, pattern of behaviour (etc.) "hosted" in one or more individual minds, and can reproduce itself from mind to mind. Thus what would otherwise be regarded as one individual influencing another to adopt a belief, is seen memetically as a meme reproducing itself.

==Relation to the brain==
{{See also|Cognitive neuroscience}}

In animals, the [[brain]], or ''encephalon'' ([[Greek (language)|Greek]] for "in the head"), is the control center of the [[central nervous system]], responsible for [[thought]]. In most animals, the brain is located in the head, protected by the [[skull]] and close to the primary sensory apparatus of [[Visual perception|vision]], [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]], [[equilibrioception]], [[taste]] and [[olfaction]]. While all [[vertebrate]]s have a brain, most [[invertebrate]]s have either a centralized brain or collections of individual [[ganglion|ganglia]]. Primitive animals such as [[sponge]]s do not have a brain at all. Brains can be extremely complex. For example, the [[human brain]] contains around 86 billion [[neuron]]s, each linked to as many as 10,000 others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Whishaw|first=Bryan Kolb, Ian Q.|title=An Introduction to Brain and Behavior|year=2010|publisher=Worth Publishers|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7167-7691-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zIBEEP2b1MIC|edition=3rd |accessdate=11 May 2012|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sherwood|first=Lauralee|title=Fundamentals of Human Physiology|year=2011|publisher=Brooks/Cole Cengage Learning|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=978-0-8400-6225-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jl4rLDuewo4C|edition=4th |accessdate=11 May 2012|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Understanding the relationship between the brain and the mind&amp;nbsp;– [[mind–body problem]] is one of the central issues in the history of [[philosophy]]&amp;nbsp;– is a challenging problem both philosophically and scientifically.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Smith Churchland, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hAeFMFW3rDUC ''Neurophilosophy: toward a unified science of the mind-brain''], MIT Press, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; There are three major philosophical schools of thought concerning the answer: dualism, materialism, and idealism. [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Dualism]] holds that the mind exists independently of the brain;&lt;ref&gt;Hart, W.D. (1997): [https://books.google.com/books?id=GFtVBGAn5-YC&amp;pg=PA265&amp;dq=dualism+%22The+mind-body+problem+is+the+question+how+the+mind+is+attached+to+the+body%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=VKuFTtvlNYSN4gTVrf20Dw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=dualism%20%22The%20mind-body%20problem%20is%20the%20question%20how%20the%20mind%20is%20attached%20to%20the%20body%22&amp;f=false ‘Dualism’, pp. 265–267] in S. Guttenplan (ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=GFtVBGAn5-YC ''A Companion to the Philosophy of Mind''], Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; [[materialism]] holds that mental phenomena are identical to neuronal phenomena;&lt;ref name="DicPhil"&gt;A.R. Lacey, ''A Dictionary of Philosophy'', 1996&lt;/ref&gt; and [[idealism (philosophy)|idealism]] holds that only mental phenomena exist.&lt;ref name="DicPhil"/&gt;

Through most of history many philosophers found it inconceivable that cognition could be implemented by a physical substance such as brain tissue (that is neurons and synapses).&lt;ref&gt;[[#refChurchland|''Neurophilosophy'']], Ch. 6&lt;/ref&gt; [[Descartes]], who thought extensively about mind-brain relationships, found it possible to explain reflexes and other simple behaviors in [[The Description of the Human Body|mechanistic terms]], although he did not believe that complex thought, and language in particular, could be explained by reference to the physical brain alone.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refDescartes|Descartes, ''Description of the human body'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most straightforward scientific evidence of a strong relationship between the physical brain [[matter]] and the mind is the impact physical alterations to the brain have on the mind, such as with [[traumatic brain injury]] and [[psychoactive drug]] use.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBoake|Boake and Diller, 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Patricia Churchland]] notes that this drug-mind interaction indicates an intimate connection between the brain and the mind.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refChurchland|''Neurophilosophy'']], Ch. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the philosophical questions, the relationship between mind and brain involves a number of scientific questions, including understanding the relationship between mental activity and brain activity, the exact mechanisms by which drugs influence [[cognition]], and the [[neural correlates of consciousness]].

Theoretical approaches to explain how mind emerges from the brain include [[connectionism]], [[computationalism]] and [[Bayesian brain]].

==Evolutionary history of the human mind==
The [[evolution of human intelligence]] refers to several theories that aim to describe how human [[intelligence]] has [[evolution|evolved]] in relation to the evolution of the [[human brain]] and the [[origin of language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harnad, S.R., Steklis, H.D., &amp; Lancaster, J.E.|title=Origins and evolution of language and speech|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|volume=280|issue=1|pages=1–2|date=1976|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1976.tb25462.x|bibcode=1976NYASA.280....1H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The timeline of [[human evolution]] spans some 7 million years, from the separation of the genus ''[[Chimpanzee|Pan]]'' until the emergence of [[behavioral modernity]] by 50,000 years ago. Of this timeline, the first 3 million years concern ''[[Sahelanthropus tchadensis|Sahelanthropus]]'', the following 2 million concern ''[[Australopithecus]]'', while the final 2 million span the history of actual ''[[Homo (genus)|Homo]]'' species (the [[Paleolithic]]).

Many traits of human intelligence, such as [[empathy]], [[theory of mind]], [[mourning]], [[ritual]], and the use of [[Great ape language|symbols]] and [[tool]]s, are already apparent in [[great ape]]s although in lesser sophistication than in humans.

There is a debate between supporters of the idea of a sudden emergence of intelligence, or "[[Behavioural modernity#Great leap forward|Great leap forward]]" and those of a gradual or [[Behavioural modernity#Continuum hypothesis|continuum hypothesis]].

Theories of the evolution of intelligence include:
* [[Robin Dunbar]]'s social brain hypothesis&lt;ref name="The Social Brain Hypothesis"&gt;[http://www.liv.ac.uk/evolpsyc/Evol_Anthrop_6.pdfThe Social Brain Hypothesis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713121559/http://www.liv.ac.uk/evolpsyc/Evol_Anthrop_6.pdfThe |date=2015-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Geoffrey Miller (psychologist)|Geoffrey Miller]]'s [[sexual selection]] hypothesis concerning [[Sexual selection in human evolution]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|authorlink=Geoffrey Miller (psychologist)|title=The Mating Mind|isbn=978-0-8058-5749-8|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ecological dominance-social competition (EDSC)&lt;ref name=flinn&gt;{{cite web| url=http://web.missouri.edu/~gearyd/Flinnetal2005.pdf|title=Flinn, M.V., Geary, D.C., &amp; Ward, C.V. (2005).

Geary and Carol V. Ward based mainly on work by [[Richard D. Alexander]].
* The idea of intelligence as a signal of good health and resistance to disease.
* The [[Group selection]] theory contends that organism characteristics that provide benefits to a group (clan, tribe, or larger population) can evolve despite individual disadvantages such as those cited above.
* The idea that intelligence is connected with nutrition, and thereby with status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0306987704000416 |title= Enhanced nutrition of offspring as a crucial factor for the evolution of intelligence on land |website= |publisher= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A higher IQ could be a signal that an individual comes from and lives in a physical and social environment where nutrition levels are high, and vice versa.

==Philosophy of mind==
{{Main|Philosophy of mind}}

Philosophy of mind is the branch of [[philosophy]] that studies the nature of the mind, [[mental event]]s, [[mental function]]s, [[mental property|mental properties]], [[consciousness]] and their relationship to the physical body. The ''[[mind–body problem]]'', i.e. the relationship of the mind to the body, is commonly seen as the central issue in philosophy of mind, although there are other issues concerning the nature of the mind that do not involve its relation to the physical body.&lt;ref name="Kim1"&gt;{{cite book | last = Kim | first = J. | editor = Honderich, Ted | title = Problems in the Philosophy of Mind.

''[[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Dualism]]'' and ''[[monism]]'' are the two major schools of thought that attempt to resolve the mind–body problem. Dualism is the position that mind and body are in some way separate from each other. It can be traced back to [[Plato]],&lt;ref name="Plato"&gt;{{cite book  | author = Plato |editor1=E.A.

The 20th century philosopher Martin Heidegger suggested that subjective experience and activity (i.e. the "mind") cannot be made sense of in terms of [[Descartes|Cartesian]] "substances" that bear "properties" at all (whether the mind itself is thought of as a distinct, separate kind of substance or not). This is because the nature of subjective, ''qualitative'' experience is incoherent in terms of&amp;nbsp;– or semantically [[Commensurability (philosophy of science)|incommensurable]] with the concept of&amp;nbsp;– substances that bear properties. This is a fundamentally [[ontology|ontological]] argument.&lt;ref&gt;Hubert Dreyfus, "Critique of Descartes I" (recorded lecture), University of California at Berkeley, September 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher of [[cognitive science]] [[Daniel Dennett]], for example, argues there is no such thing as a narrative center called the "mind", but that instead there is simply a collection of sensory inputs and outputs: different kinds of "software" running in parallel.&lt;ref name=Dennett1991&gt;{{cite book |author=Dennett, Daniel |title=Consciousness Explained |year=1991 |publisher=Little Brown |location=Boston, Massachusetts |isbn=978-0-316-18065-8|title-link=Consciousness Explained }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--find page # or page range for this citation--&gt; Psychologist [[B.F.

Philosopher [[David Chalmers]] has argued that the third person approach to uncovering mind and consciousness is not effective, such as looking into other's brains or observing human conduct, but that a first person approach is necessary.   Such a first person perspective indicates that the mind must be conceptualized as something distinct from the brain.

The mind has also been described as manifesting from moment to moment, one thought moment at a time as a fast flowing stream, where sense impressions and mental phenomena are constantly changing.&lt;ref name="Aggregates"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Karunamuni2017"/&gt;

===Mind/body perspectives===
''Monism'' is the position that mind and body are not [[physiology|physiologically]] and ontologically distinct kinds of entities. This view was first advocated in [[Western Philosophy]] by [[Parmenides]] in the 5th Century BC and was later espoused by the 17th Century [[Rationalism|rationalist]] [[Baruch Spinoza]].&lt;ref name="Spin"&gt;Spinoza, Baruch (1670) ''Tractatus Theologico-Politicus'' (A Theologico-Political Treatise).&lt;/ref&gt; According to Spinoza's [[dual-aspect theory]], mind and body are two aspects of an underlying reality which he variously described as "Nature" or "God".
* ''[[Physicalism|Physicalists]]'' argue that only the entities postulated by physical theory exist, and that the mind will eventually be explained in terms of these entities as physical theory continues to evolve.
* ''[[idealism (philosophy)|Idealists]]'' maintain that the mind is all that exists and that the external world is either mental itself, or an illusion created by the mind.
* ''[[neutral monism|Neutral monists]]'' adhere to the position that perceived things in the world can be regarded as either physical or mental depending on whether one is interested in their relationship to other things in the world or their relationship to the perceiver. For example, a red spot on a wall is physical in its dependence on the wall and the pigment of which it is made, but it is mental in so far as its perceived redness depends on the workings of the visual system. Unlike dual-aspect theory, neutral monism does not posit a more fundamental substance of which mind and body are aspects.

The most common monisms in the 20th and 21st centuries have all been variations of physicalism; these positions include [[behaviorism]], the [[type physicalism|type identity theory]], [[anomalous monism]] and [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]].&lt;ref name="Kim"&gt;Kim, J., "Mind-Body Problem", ''Oxford Companion to Philosophy''. Ted Honderich (ed.). Oxford:Oxford University Press. 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many modern philosophers of mind adopt either a ''reductive'' or ''non-reductive physicalist'' position, maintaining in their different ways that the mind is not something separate from the body.&lt;ref name="Kim" /&gt; These approaches have been particularly influential in the sciences, e.g. in the fields of [[sociobiology]], [[computer science]], [[evolutionary psychology]] and the various [[neuroscience]]s.&lt;ref name="PsyBio"&gt;Pinel, J.

''The Selfish Gene'' (1976) Oxford:Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!----Well, you get f** idea. There are billions of refs for this---&gt; Other philosophers, however, adopt a non-physicalist position which challenges the notion that the mind is a purely physical construct.&lt;!--eg, Chalmers ref and whatever else you like----&gt;
* ''Reductive physicalists'' assert that all mental states and properties will eventually be explained by scientific accounts of physiological processes and states.&lt;ref name="Pat"&gt;{{cite book | author=Churchland, Patricia | title=Neurophilosophy: Toward a Unified Science of the Mind-Brain | publisher=MIT Press | year=1986 | isbn=978-0-262-03116-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Paul"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Churchland, Paul | title=Eliminative Materialism and the Propositional Attitudes | journal=[[Journal of Philosophy]] | year=1981 | pages=67–90 | volume = 78 | doi = 10.2307/2025900 | issue=2 | jstor=2025900}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smart"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Smart, J.J.C. | title=Sensations and Brain Processes | journal=Philosophical Review | year=1956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continued progress in [[neuroscience]] has helped to clarify many of these issues, and its findings have been taken by many to support [[Physicalism|physicalists]]' assertions.&lt;ref name="Murphy"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Farah|first=Martha J.|author2=Murphy, Nancey|title=Neuroscience and the Soul|journal=Science|date=February 2009|volume=323|issue=5918|page=1168|doi=10.1126/science.323.5918.1168a|pmid=19251609|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/323/5918/1168.1.full|accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Koch"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koch|first=Christof|title=Do Not Underestimate Science|journal=Science|date=July 2009|volume=325|issue=5939|page=392|doi=10.1126/science.325_392b|pmid=19628839|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/325/5939/392.2.full|accessdate=14 November 2012|bibcode=2009Sci...325..392K}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, our knowledge is incomplete, and modern philosophers of mind continue to discuss how subjective [[qualia]] and the [[intentional stance|intentional]] mental states can be [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturally]] explained.&lt;ref name="Int"&gt;{{cite book | author=Dennett, Daniel | title=The intentional stance | publisher=MIT Press | location=Cambridge, Mass. |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-262-54053-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Searleint"&gt;{{cite book | author=Searle, John | title=Intentionality.

===Neuroscience===
{{See also|Cognitive neuroscience|Thought identification}}

[[Neuroscience]] studies the [[nervous system]], the physical basis of the mind. At the systems level, neuroscientists investigate how [[biological neural networks]] form and physiologically interact to produce mental functions and content such as [[reflex]]es, [[multisensory integration]], [[motor coordination]], [[circadian rhythm]]s, [[emotion|emotional responses]], [[learning]], and [[memory]]. At a larger scale, efforts in [[computational neuroscience]] have developed large-scale models that simulate simple, functioning brains.&lt;ref name="Spaun"/&gt; As of 2012, such models include the [[thalamus]], [[basal ganglia]], [[prefrontal cortex]], [[motor cortex]], and [[occipital cortex]], and consequentially simulated brains can learn, respond to visual stimuli, coordinate motor responses, form short-term memories, and learn to respond to patterns. Currently, researchers aim to program the [[hippocampus]] and [[limbic system]], hypothetically imbuing the simulated mind with [[long-term memory]] and crude [[emotion]]s.&lt;ref name="CNRG"&gt;{{cite web|title=Computational Neuroscience Research Group|url=http://ctnsrv.uwaterloo.ca/cnrglab/|publisher=Waterloo Centre for Theoretical Neuroscience|accessdate=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, [[affective neuroscience]] studies the neural mechanisms of [[personality psychology|personality]], [[emotion]], and [[mood (psychology)|mood]] primarily through experimental tasks.

===Cognitive Science===
{{See also|Cognitive Science}}
{{expand section|date=May 2013}}

[[Cognitive science]] examines the mental functions that give rise to [[information processing]], termed [[cognition]]. These include [[perception]], [[attention]], [[working memory]], [[long-term memory]], producing and understanding [[language]], [[learning]], [[reason]]ing, [[problem solving]], and [[decision making]]. Cognitive science seeks to understand thinking "in terms of representational structures in the mind and computational procedures that operate on those structures".&lt;ref name="stanford1"&gt;Thagard, Paul, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/cognitive-science/ Cognitive Science], The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2008 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychology===
{{See also|Neuropsychology|Psyche (psychology)|label 2=Psyche|Unconscious mind}}

[[Psychology]] is the scientific study of human behavior, mental functioning, and experience. As both an [[academic]] and [[applied science|applied]] discipline, Psychology involves the [[science|scientific study]] of [[mental process]]es such as [[perception]], [[cognition]], [[emotion]], [[Personality psychology|personality]], as well as environmental influences, such as social and cultural influences, and [[interpersonal relationships]], in order to devise theories of human behavior. Psychological patterns can be understood as low cost ways of information processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Unity of Science and Economics: A New Foundation of Economic Theory|last = Chen|first = Jing|publisher = Springer|year = 2015|isbn = |location = https://www.springer.com/us/book/9781493934645}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Psychology also refers to the application of such [[knowledge]] to various spheres of [[Human behavior|human activity]], including problems of individuals' [[everyday life|daily lives]] and the treatment of [[mental health]] problems.

Psychology differs from the other [[social sciences]] (e.g. [[anthropology]], [[economics]], [[political science]], and [[sociology]]) due to its focus on [[experimentation]] at the scale of the individual, or individuals in small groups as opposed to [[group (sociology)|large groups]], [[institutions]] or [[societies]]. Historically, psychology differed from [[biology]] and [[neuroscience]] in that it was primarily concerned with mind rather than brain. Modern psychological science incorporates [[Psychophysiology|physiological]] and [[neuropsychology|neurological]] processes into its conceptions of [[perception]], [[cognition]], behaviour, and [[mental disorders]].

==Mental health==
{{Main|Mental health}}

By analogy with the health of the body, one can speak metaphorically of a state of health of the mind, or [[mental health]]. [[Merriam-Webster]] defines mental health as "A state of emotional and psychological well-being in which an individual is able to use his or her cognitive and emotional capabilities, function in society, and meet the ordinary demands of everyday life." According to the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), there is no one "official" definition of mental health. Cultural differences, subjective assessments, and competing professional theories all affect how "mental health" is defined. In general, most experts agree that "mental health" and "[[mental disorder]]" are not opposites. In other words, the absence of a recognized mental disorder is not necessarily an indicator of mental health.

One way to think about mental health is by looking at how effectively and successfully a person functions. Feeling capable and competent; being able to handle normal levels of stress, maintaining satisfying relationships, and leading an independent life; and being able to "bounce back," or recover from difficult situations, are all signs of mental health.

[[Psychotherapy]] is an [[interpersonal]], [[Interpersonal relationship|relational]] intervention used by trained psychotherapists to aid [[wikt:Client|clients]] in problems of living. This usually includes increasing individual sense of [[well-being]] and reducing subjective discomforting experience. Psychotherapists employ a range of techniques based on experiential relationship building, [[dialogue]], [[communication]] and [[behavior]] change and that are designed to improve the [[mental health]] of a client or patient, or to improve group relationships (such as in a [[family]]). Most forms of psychotherapy use only spoken [[conversation]], though some also use various other forms of communication such as the written word, [[art]], [[drama]], [[narrative]] story, or therapeutic touch. Psychotherapy occurs within a structured encounter between a trained [[therapist]] and client(s). Purposeful, theoretically based psychotherapy began in the 19th century with [[psychoanalysis]]; since then, scores of other approaches have been developed and continue to be created.

==Non-human minds==

===Animal intelligence===
[[Animal cognition]], or cognitive ethology, is the title given to a modern approach to the mental capacities of animals. It has developed out of [[comparative psychology]], but has also been strongly influenced by the approach of [[ethology]], [[behavioral ecology]], and [[evolutionary psychology]]. Much of what used to be considered under the title of "animal intelligence" is now thought of under this heading. [[Animal language acquisition]], attempting to discern or understand the degree to which animal cognition can be revealed by [[linguistics]]-related study, has been controversial among [[cognitive linguistics|cognitive linguists]].

===Artificial intelligence===
{{refimprove section|date=September 2007}}
{{Main|Philosophy of artificial intelligence}}

[[File:Forest of synthetic pyramidal dendrites grown using Cajal's laws of neuronal branching.png|thumb|[[Computer simulation]] of the branching architecture of the [[dendrite]]s of [[pyramidal neuron]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1371/image.pcbi.v06.i08 | title = PLoS Computational Biology Issue Image &amp;#124; Vol. 6(8) August 2010 | journal = PLoS Computational Biology | volume = 6 | issue = 8 | pages = ev06.ei08 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;]] In 1950 [[Alan M. Turing]] published "Computing machinery and intelligence" in ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'', in which he proposed that machines could be tested for intelligence using questions and answers. This process is now named the [[Turing Test]]. The term [[Artificial Intelligence]] (AI) was first used by [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] who considered it to mean "the science and engineering of making intelligent machines".&lt;ref&gt;What is Artificial Intelligence? by John McCarthy [http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/whatisai/whatisai.html Stanford University] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118212402/http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/whatisai/whatisai.html |date=2015-11-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also refer to [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] as exhibited by an artificial (''man-made'', ''non-natural'', ''manufactured'') entity. AI is studied in overlapping fields of [[computer science]], [[psychology]], [[neuroscience]] and [[engineering]], dealing with intelligent [[behavior]], [[learn]]ing and [[adaptation]] and usually developed using customized [[machine]]s or [[computer]]s.

Research in AI is concerned with producing machines to automate tasks requiring intelligent behavior. Examples include [[control system|control]], [[Automated planning and scheduling|planning and scheduling]], the ability to answer diagnostic and consumer questions, [[handwriting recognition|handwriting]], [[natural language]], [[speech recognition|speech]] and [[facial recognition system|facial recognition]]. As such, the study of AI has also become an engineering discipline, focused on providing solutions to real life problems, [[knowledge mining]], [[software]] applications, [[strategy games]] like [[computer chess]] and other [[video game]]s. One of the biggest limitations of AI is in the domain of actual machine comprehension. Consequentially [[natural language understanding]] and [[connectionism]] (where behavior of neural networks is investigated) are areas of active research and development.

The debate about the nature of the mind is relevant to the development of [[artificial intelligence]]. If the mind is indeed a thing separate from or higher than the functioning of the brain, then hypothetically it would be much more difficult to recreate within a machine, if it were possible at all. If, on the other hand, the mind is no more than the aggregated functions of the brain, then it will be possible to create a machine with a recognisable mind (though possibly only with computers much different from today's), by simple virtue of the fact that such a machine already exists in the form of the human brain.

==In religion==
Many religions associate spiritual qualities to the human mind. These are often tightly connected to their [[mythology]] and ideas of [[afterlife]].

The [[India]]n [[philosopher]]-sage [[Sri Aurobindo]] attempted to unite the Eastern and Western psychological traditions with his [[integral psychology (Sri Aurobindo)|integral psychology]], as have many philosophers and [[New religious movement]]s. [[Judaism]] teaches that "moach shalit al halev", the mind rules the heart. Humans can approach the Divine intellectually, through learning and behaving according to the Divine Will as enclothed in the Torah, and use that deep logical understanding to elicit and guide emotional arousal during prayer. [[Christianity]] has tended to see the mind as distinct from the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] (Greek ''[[nous]]'') and sometimes further distinguished from the [[spirit]]. [[Esotericism|Western esoteric traditions]] sometimes refer to a [[mental body]] that exists on a plane other than the physical. [[Hinduism]]'s various philosophical schools have debated whether the human [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] (Sanskrit ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]]'') is distinct from, or identical to, ''[[Brahman]]'', the [[divinity|divine]] [[reality]]. [[Taoism]] sees the human being as contiguous with natural forces, and the mind as not separate from the [[Human body|body]]. [[Confucianism]] sees the mind, like the body, as inherently perfectible.

===Buddhism===
{{See also|Buddhism and psychology|Vijñāna|Śūnyatā|Shentong|Rangtong|Yogacara}}

Buddhist teachings explain the moment-to-moment manifestation of the mind-stream.&lt;ref name="Karunamuni2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aggregates"/&gt; The components that make up the mind are known as the five aggregates (i.e., material form, feelings, perception, volition, and sensory consciousness), which arise and pass away continuously. The arising and passing of these aggregates in the present moment is described as being influenced by five causal laws: biological laws, psychological laws, physical laws, volitional laws, and universal laws.&lt;ref name="Aggregates"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Karunamuni2017"/&gt; The Buddhist practice of [[mindfulness]] involves attending to this constantly changing mind-stream.

According to [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] philosopher [[Dharmakirti]], the mind has two fundamental qualities: "clarity and cognizes". If something is not those two qualities, it cannot validly be called mind. "Clarity" refers to the fact that mind has no color, shape, size, location, weight, or any other physical characteristic, and "cognizes" that it functions to know or perceive objects.&lt;ref&gt;Gyatso, [[Geshe Kelsang Gyatso]], ''Understanding the Mind'': The Nature and Power of the Mind, [[Tharpa Publications]] (2nd. ed., 1997) {{ISBN|978-0-948006-78-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Knowing" refers to the fact that mind is aware of the contents of experience, and that, in order to exist, mind must be cognizing an object. You cannot have a mind – whose function is to cognize an object – existing without cognizing an object.

Mind, in Buddhism, is also described as being "space-like" and "illusion-like". Mind is space-like in the sense that it is not physically obstructive. It has no qualities which would prevent it from existing. In [[Mahayana]] Buddhism, mind is illusion-like in the sense that it is empty of inherent existence. This does not mean it does not exist, it means that it exists in a manner that is counter to our ordinary way of misperceiving how phenomena exist, according to Buddhism. When the mind is itself cognized properly, without misperceiving its mode of existence, it appears to exist like an illusion. There is a big difference however between being "space and illusion" and being "space-like" and "illusion-like". Mind is not composed of space, it just shares some descriptive similarities to space. Mind is not an illusion, it just shares some descriptive qualities with illusions.

Buddhism posits that there is no inherent, unchanging identity (Inherent I, Inherent Me) or phenomena (Ultimate self, inherent self, Atman, Soul, Self-essence, Jiva, Ishvara, humanness essence, etc.) which is the experiencer of our experiences and the agent of our actions. In other words, human beings consist of merely a body and a mind, and nothing extra. Within the body there is no part or set of parts which is – by itself or themselves – the person. Similarly, within the mind there is no part or set of parts which are themselves "the person". A human being merely consists of five aggregates, or ''[[skandha]]s'' and nothing else.

In the same way, "mind" is what can be validly conceptually labelled onto our mere experience of clarity and knowing. There is something separate and apart from clarity and knowing which is "Awareness", in Buddhism. "Mind" is that part of experience the sixth sense door, which can be validly referred to as mind by the concept-term "mind". There is also not "objects out there, mind in here, and experience somewhere in-between". There is a third thing called "awareness" which exists being aware of the contents of mind and what mind cognizes. There are five senses (arising of mere experience: shapes, colors, the components of smell, components of taste, components of sound, components of touch) and mind as the sixth institution; this means, expressly, that there can be a third thing called "awareness" and a third thing called "experiencer who is aware of the experience". This awareness is deeply related to "no-self" because it does not judge the experience with craving or aversion.

Clearly, the experience arises and is known by mind, but there is a third thing calls [[Sati (Buddhism)|Sati]] what is the "real experiencer of the experience" that sits apart from the experience and which can be aware of the experience in 4 levels. (Maha Sathipatthana Sutta.)
# Body
# Sensations (Changes of the body mind.)
# Mind,
# Contents of the mind. (Changes of the body mind.)

To be aware of these four levels one needs to cultivate equanimity toward Craving and Aversion. This is Called Vipassana which is different from the way of reacting with  Craving and Aversion. This is the state of being aware and equanimous to the complete experience of here and now. This is the way of Buddhism, with regards to mind and the ultimate nature of minds (and persons).

===Mortality of the mind===
{{Main|Consciousness after death}}
Due to the [[mind–body problem]], a lot of interest and debate surrounds the question of what happens to one's conscious mind as one's body dies. During [[brain death]] all [[brain activity|brain function]] permanently ceases, according to the current neuroscientific view which sees these processes as the physical basis of mental phenomena, the mind fails to survive brain death and ceases to exist. This permanent loss of consciousness after death is often called "[[eternal oblivion]]". The belief that some [[spirit]]ual or [[incorporeal]] component ([[soul]]) exists and that it is preserved after death is described by the term "[[afterlife]]".

==In pseudoscience==
===Parapsychology===
[[Parapsychology]] is a study of certain types of [[paranormal phenomena]], or of phenomena which appear to be paranormal but it does not have any scientific basis &lt;ref&gt;[http://parapsych.org/glossary_l_r.html#p Parapsychological Association website, Glossary of Key Words Frequently Used in Parapsychology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824232035/http://parapsych.org/glossary_l_r.html |date=2010-08-24 }}, Retrieved February 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; for instance [[precognition]], [[telekinesis]] and [[telepathy]].

The term is based on the Greek [[:wikt:para-|para]] (beside/beyond), [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] (soul/mind), and [[logos]] (account/explanation) and was coined by psychologist [[Max Dessoir]] in or before 1889.&lt;ref name = "EncyOccult"/&gt; [[J.B.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1695">'''Mitochondrial toxicity''' is a condition in which the [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] of a body's cells become damaged or decline significantly in number; it occurs as a side effect of certain [[antiretroviral drug]]s used to treat human immunodeficiency virus, or [[HIV]].

==Causes==
While the exact causes of mitochondrial toxicity are unknown, research has shown that a certain group of anti-viral drugs used to treat HIV, specifically nucleoside analog [[reverse transcriptase inhibitor]]s (NRTIs), interfere with an enzyme needed in the production of mitochondria.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thebody.com/pinf/mitochondrial.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symptoms==
The disruption of cell function that accompanies the condition can cause both mild and severe problems in people suffering from mitochondrial toxicity.  The most commonly observed symptom is muscle weakness, or [[myopathy]].  Others include [[peripheral neuropathy]] (numbness in the fingers and toes) and [[pancreatitis]] (inflammation of the pancreas), with the most severe being [[lactic acidosis]], in which a build-up of lactic acid in the tissues of the body leads to loss of energy, organ failure, and eventually death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.projinf.org/fs/mito_b.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061002195329/http://www.projinf.org/fs/mito_b.html |archivedate=2006-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Models of communication''' are [[conceptual model]]s used to explain the human [[communication]] [[:wikt:process|process]]. The first major model for communication was developed in 1948 by [[Claude Elwood Shannon]] and published with an introduction by [[Warren Weaver]] for [[Bell Laboratories]].&lt;ref name="Shannon"&gt;Shannon, C. E., &amp; Weaver, W. (1949). ''The mathematical theory of communication''. Urbana, Illinois: [[University of Illinois Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Theory of communication|basic concept]], communication is the process of sending and receiving [[message]]s or transferring [[information]] from one part (sender) to another (receiver).{{sfn|Craig|1999}}

In 1960, David Berlo expanded the linear transmission model &lt;ref name="Berlo"&gt;Berlo, D. K. (1960). The process of communication; an introduction to theory and practice. New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston. Claude E Shannon, W. W. (1949)&lt;/ref&gt; with the Sender-Message-Channel-Receiver(SMCR) Model of Communication. &lt;ref name="Schulz"&gt;Schulz, Peter. Cobley, Paul. (2013). Theories and Models of Communication. Berlin: De Gruyter Mouton. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Wilbur Schramm introduced a model that identified multiple variables in communication which includes the transmitter, encoding, media, decoding, and receiver. &lt;ref name="Qing-Lan"&gt;Qing-Lan Chen, Chiou-Shuei Wei, Mei-Yao Huang and Chiu-Chi Wei. (2013) A model for project communication
medium evaluation and selection.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shannon-Weaver Model==
Elwood Shannon and Warren Weaver were engineers that worked for Bell Telephone Labs in the United States. Their goal was to make sure that the telephone cables and radio waves were working at the maximum efficiency. Therefore, they developed the Shannon-Weaver model which had an intention to expand a mathematical theory of communication.&lt;ref name="Chandler"&gt;Chandler Daniel, The Transmission Model of Communication. http://transcriptions-2008.english.ucsb.edu/archive/courses/warner/english197/Schedule_files/Chandler/Transmission.model_files/trans.htm (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; The Shannon–Weaver model was developed in 1949 which is referred as the 'mother of all models'.&lt;ref name="Hollnagel"&gt;Erik Hollnagel, David D. Woods. Joint Cognitive Systems: Foundations of Cognitive Systems Engineering. CRC Press. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The model is well accepted as a main initial model for Communication Studies which has grown since then.&lt;ref name="Fiske"&gt; Fiske, John. Introduction to Communication Studies. London: Routledge (Chapter 1, 'Communication Theory' is a good introduction to this topic). (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

As well, the [[Shannon-Weaver model]] was designed to mirror the functioning of radio and telephone technology. Their initial model consisted of four primary parts: [[sender]], [[message]], [[Channel (communications)|channel]], and [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]]. The sender was the part of a [[telephone]] a person speaks into, the channel was the telephone itself, and the receiver was the part of the phone through which one can hear the person on the other end of the line. Shannon and Weaver also recognized that there may often be static or background sounds that interfere with the process of the other partner in a telephone conversation; they referred to this as noise. Certain types of background sounds can also indicate the absence of a signal.&lt;ref name="Chandler"/&gt;

The original model of Shannon and Weaver has five elements: information source, transmitter, channel, receiver, and destination.  To illustrate the process of the communication the first step is the information source where the information is stored. Next, in order to send the information, the message is encoded into signals, so it can travel to its destination. After the message is encoded, it goes through the channel which the signals are adapted for the transmission. In addition, the channel carried the noise course which is any interference that might happen to lead to the signal receive a different information from the source. After the channel, the message arrives in the receiver step where the message reconstruct (decode) from the signal. Finally, the message arrives at the destination.&lt;ref name="Faustine" /&gt;

In a simple model, often referred to as ''the transmission model'' or ''standard view of communication'', [[information]] or content (e.g. a message in [[natural language]]) is sent in some form (as [[spoken language]]) from an emissor/ sender/ [[encoder]] to a destination/ receiver/ decoder. According to this common communication-related conception, communication is viewed as a means of sending and receiving information. The strengths of this model are its simplicity, generality, and quantifiability. The mathematicians Claude Shannon and Warren Weaver structured this model on the basis of the following elements:

* An [[information source]], which produces a message.
* A [[transmitter]], which encodes the message into signals
* A [[Channel (communications)|channel]], for which signals are adapted for transmission
* A [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]], which reconstructs the encoded message from a sequence of received signals and decodes it.
* An information destination, where the message arrives.

Shannon and Weaver argued that this concept entails three levels of problems for communication:

# The technical problem: how accurately can the message be transmitted?
# The [[semantic]] problem: how precisely is the meaning 'conveyed'?
# The effectiveness problem: how effectively does the received meaning affect behavior?

[[Daniel Chandler]] criticizes the transmission model in the following terms:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = The Transmission Model of Communication|last = Chandler|first = Daniel|authorlink = |coauthors = |year = 1994|publisher = University of Western Australia|location = |isbn = |page = |pages = |url = http://visual-memory.co.uk/daniel/Documents/short/trans.html|accessdate = 11.06.2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* It assumes that communicators are isolated individuals.
* It makes no allowance for differing purposes.
* It makes no allowance for differing interpretations.
* It makes no allowance for unequal power relationships.

== Berlo ==

In 1960, David Berlo expanded Shannon and Weaver's 1949 linear model of communication and created the Sender-Message-Channel-Receiver (SMCR) Model of Communication.&lt;ref&gt;Berlo, D. K. (1960).'' The process of communication''. New York, New York: Holt, Rinehart, &amp; Winston.&lt;/ref&gt; The SMCR Model of Communication separated the model into clear parts and has been expanded upon by other scholars.

The Berlo's communication process is a simple application for communication of person-to-person which include communication source, encoder, message, channel, decoder, and communication receiver. &lt;ref name="Ann"&gt;Ann, Bette. Berlo's Communication Process Model as Applied to the Behavioral Theories of Maslow, Herzberg, and McGrego. Stead Source: The Academy of Management Journal, Vol. 15, No. 3 (Sep., 1972), pp. 389-394 Published by: Academy of Management Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/254868 &lt;/ref&gt; In addition, David Berlo presented some factors that influence the communication process between two people. The factors include communication skills, awareness level, social system, cultural system, and attitude.&lt;ref name="Sluková"&gt;Sluková, Petra Zia. Studies of Information and Knowledge Management in he European Context: No. 5 Communication of Information Reg. No: CZ.1.07/2.2.00/07.0284 OP: Education for Competitiveness Support area. 2.2 University Education Realization: VŠB-Technical University of Ostrava, Faculty of Economics, separate unit: Business Academy and HPS Valašské Meziříčí&lt;/ref&gt;

The Berlo's Model of Communication process starts at the source. This is the part where determine the communication skills, attitude, knowledge, social system, and culture of the people involved in the communication. After the message is developed which is elements in a set of symbols. &lt;ref name="Sluková" /&gt; Then the encoder step beginning. The encoder process is where the motor skills take place by speaking or writing. &lt;ref name="Ann" /&gt; The message goes through the channel which carries the message by hearing, seeing, touching, smelling, or tasting.&lt;ref name="Berlo" /&gt; Then the decoder process takes place. In this process, the receiver interpreter the message with her or him sensory skills. Finally, the communication receiver gets the whole message understood.&lt;ref name="Ann" /&gt;

== Schramm ==

Communication is usually described along a few major dimensions: Message (what type of things are communicated), source / emissor / sender / [[encoder]] (by whom), form (in which form), channel (through which [[media (communication)|medium]]), destination / receiver / target / decoder (to whom), and Receiver. [[Wilbur Schramm]] (1954) also indicated that we should also examine the impact that a message has (both desired and undesired) on the target of the message.&lt;ref&gt;Schramm, W. (1954). How communication works. In W. Schramm (Ed.), ''The process and effects of communication'' (pp. 3-26). Urbana, Illinois: University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Between parties, communication includes acts that confer knowledge and experiences, give advice and commands, and ask questions. These acts may take many forms, in one of the various manners of communication. The form depends on the abilities of the group communicating. Together, communication content and form make [[message]]s that are sent towards a destination. The target can be oneself, another [[Interpersonal Communication|person]] or being, another entity (such as a corporation or group of beings).

Communication can be seen as processes of [[information transmission]] governed by three levels of [[semiotic]] rules:
#[[Syntactic]] (formal properties of signs and symbols),
#[[Pragmatics|Pragmatic]] (concerned with the relations between signs/expressions and their users) and
#[[Semantic]] (study of relationships between signs and symbols and what they represent).

Therefore, communication is [[Interpersonal relationship|social interaction]] where at least two interacting agents share a common set of signs and a common set of [[semiotic]] rules. This commonly held rule in some sense ignores [[semiotics|autocommunication]], including [[intrapersonal communication]] via [[diary|diaries]] or self-talk, both secondary phenomena that followed the primary acquisition of communicative competences within social interactions.

== Barnlund ==

In light of these weaknesses, Barnlund (1970) proposed a transactional model of communication.&lt;ref&gt;Barnlund, D. C. (2008). A transactional model of communication. In. C. D. Mortensen (Eds.), ''Communication theory'' (2nd ed., pp47-57). New Brunswick, New Jersey: Transaction.&lt;/ref&gt;  The basic premise of the transactional model of communication is that individuals are simultaneously engaging in the sending and receiving of messages.

In a slightly more complex form, a sender and a receiver are linked [[wikt:reciprocal|reciprocally]]. This second attitude of communication, referred to as the constitutive model or constructionist view, focuses on how an individual communicates as the determining factor of the way the message will be interpreted. Communication is viewed as a conduit; a passage in which information travels from one individual to another and this information becomes separate from the communication itself. A particular instance of communication is called a [[speech act]].  The sender's personal filters and the receiver's personal filters may vary depending upon different regional traditions, cultures, or gender; which may alter the intended meaning of message contents.  In the presence of "[[communication noise|noise]]" on the transmission channel (air, in this case), reception and decoding of content may be faulty, and thus the speech act may not achieve the desired effect. One problem with this encode-transmit-receive-decode model is that the processes of encoding and decoding imply that the sender and receiver each possess something that functions as a [code-book], and that these two code books are, at the very least, similar if not identical.  Although something like code books is implied by the model, they are nowhere represented in the model, which creates many conceptual difficulties.

Theories of [[co-regulation]] describe communication as a creative and dynamic continuous process, rather than a discrete exchange of information. Canadian media scholar [[Harold Innis]] had the theory that people use different types of media to communicate and which one they choose to use will offer different possibilities for the shape and durability of society.&lt;ref name="Wark1997"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wark|first=McKenzie|year=1997|title=The Virtual Republic|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin, St Leonards}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2017}} His famous example of this is using [[ancient Egypt]] and looking at the ways they built themselves out of media with very different properties stone and papyrus. Papyrus is what he called ''''Space Binding''''. it made possible the transmission of written orders across space, empires and enables the waging of distant military campaigns and colonial administration. The other is stone and ''''Time Binding'''', through the construction of temples and the pyramids can sustain their authority generation to generation, through this media they can change and shape communication in their society.&lt;ref name="Wark1997"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2017}}

== Constructionist ==

There is an additional working definition of communication to consider{{examples|date=October 2011}} that authors like Richard A. Lanham (2003) and as far back as Erving Goffman (1959) have highlighted.  This is a progression from Lasswell's attempt to define human communication through to this century and revolutionized into the constructionist model.  Constructionists believe that the process of communication is in itself the only messages that exist.  The packaging can not be separated from the social and historical context from which it arose, therefore the substance to look at in communication theory is style for Richard Lanham and the performance of self for Erving Goffman.

Lanham chose to view communication as the rival to the over encompassing use of [[CBS model]] (which pursued to further the transmission model). CBS model argues that clarity, brevity, and sincerity are the only purpose to prose discourse, therefore communication. Lanham wrote: "If words matter too, if the whole range of human motive is seen as animating prose discourse, then rhetoric analysis leads us to the essential questions about prose style" (Lanham 10). This is saying that rhetoric and style are fundamentally important; they are not errors to what we actually intend to transmit. The process which we construct and deconstruct meaning deserves analysis.

Erving Goffman sees the performance of self as the most important frame to understand communication. Goffman wrote: "What does seem to be required of the individual is that he learn enough pieces of expression to be able to 'fill in' and manage, more or less, any part that he is likely to be given" (Goffman 73), highlighting the significance of expression.

The truth in both cases is the articulation of the message and the package as one. The construction of the message from social and historical context is the seed as is the pre-existing message is for the transmission model. Therefore, any look into communication theory should include the possibilities drafted by such great scholars as [[Richard A. Lanham]] and Goffman that style and performance is the whole process. lun

Communication stands so deeply rooted in human [[behavior]]s and the structures of [[society]] that scholars have difficulty thinking of it while excluding social or behavioral events.{{weasel inline|date=October 2011}} Because communication theory remains a relatively young field of inquiry and integrates itself with other disciplines such as philosophy, psychology, and sociology, one probably cannot {{As of|2006|alt=yet}} expect a consensus conceptualization of communication across disciplines.{{weasel inline|date=October 2011}}

Communication Model Terms as provided by Rothwell (11-15):
*''Noise''; interference with effective transmission and reception of a message.
**For example;
***physical noise or external noise which are environmental distractions such as poorly heated rooms, startling sounds, appearances of things, music playing some where else, and someone talking really loudly near you.
***physiological noise are biological influences that distract you from communicating competently such as sweaty palms, pounding heart, butterfly in the stomach, induced by speech anxiety, or feeling sick, exhausted at work, the ringing noise in your ear, being really hungry, and if you have a runny nose or a cough.
***psychological noise are the preconception bias and assumptions such as thinking someone who speaks like a valley girl is dumb, or someone from a foreign country can’t speak English well so you speak loudly and slowly to them.
***semantic noise are word choices that are confusing and distracting such as using the word tri-syllabic instead of three syllables.
*''Sender''; the initiator and encoder of a message
*''Receiver''; the one that receives the message (the listener) and the decoder of a message
*''Decode''; translates the sender's spoken idea/message into something the receiver understands by using their knowledge of language from personal experience.
*''Encode''; puts the idea into spoken language while putting their own meaning into the word/message.
*''Channel''; the medium through which the message travels such as through oral communication (radio, television, phone, in person) or written communication (letters, email, text messages)
*''Feedback''; the receiver's verbal and nonverbal responses to a message such as a nod for understanding (nonverbal), a raised eyebrow for being confused (nonverbal), or asking a question to clarify the message (verbal).
*''Message''; the verbal and nonverbal components of language that is sent to the receiver by the sender which conveys an idea.

Humans act toward people or things on the basis of the meanings they assign to those people or things.
-"Language is the source of meaning". 
-Meaning arises out of the social interaction people have with each other.

-Meaning is not inherent in objects but it is negotiated through the use of language, hence the term symbolic interactionism.
As human beings, we have the ability to name things.
Symbols, including names, are arbitrary signs.
By talking with others, we ascribe meaning to words and develop a universe of discourse
A symbol is a stimulus that has a learned/shared meaning and a value for people
Significant symbols can be nonverbal as well as linguistic.

-Negative responses can consequently reduce a person to nothing.
-Our expectations evoke responses that confirm what we originally anticipated, resulting in a self-fulfilling prophecy.

== Linear ==

This is a one-way model to communicate with others. It consists of the '''sender''' encoding a message and channeling it to the '''receiver''' in the presence of noise. In this model there is no feedback or response which may allow for a continuous 
exchange of information (F.N.S. Palma, 1993).

The linear model was first introduced by Shannon &amp; Weaver in 1949. In the linear communication model, the message travels one direction from the start point to the endpoint. In other words, once the sender sends the message to the receiver the communication process ends. Many communications online use the linear communication model. For example, when you send an email, post a blog, or share something on social media. However, the linear model does not explain many other forms of communication including face-to-face conversation.&lt;ref name="McCornack"&gt;McCornack, Steven. Ortiz, Joseph. Choice &amp; Connections: An Introduction to Communication. (2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interactive/convergence ==

It is two linear models stacked on top of each other. The sender channels a message to the receiver and the receiver then becomes the sender and channels a message to the original sender. This model has added feedback, indicating that communication is not a one way but a two way process. It also has "field of experience" which includes our cultural background, ethnicity geographic location, extent of travel, and general personal experiences accumulated over the course of your lifetime. Draw backs – there is feedback but it is not simultaneous.
[[File:Interactive.png|thumb|left|alt=An Interactive Model of Communication.|The Interactive Model.]]
*For example, – instant messaging. The sender sends an IM to the receiver, then the original sender has to wait for the IM from the original receiver to react. Or a question/answer session where you just ask a question then you get an answer.

== Communication theory framework ==

{{Main article|Theory of communication}}

Communication theory can be seen from one of the following viewpoints:

*Mechanistic:  This view{{who|date=October 2011}} considers communication as a perfect transaction of a message from the sender to the receiver. (as seen in the diagram above)
*Psychological:  This view{{who|date=October 2011}} considers communication as the act of sending a message to a receiver, and the feelings and thoughts of the receiver upon interpreting the message.
*Social [[Social constructionism|Constructionist]] (Symbolic Interactionist):  This view considers communication to be the product of the interactants sharing and creating meaning.  The Constructionist View can also be defined as, how you say something determines what the message is.  The Constructionist View assumes that "truth" and "ideas" are constructed or invented through the social process of communication.  [[Robert T. Craig (scholar)|Robert T. Craig]] saw the Constructionist View or the constitutive view as it's called in his article, as "…an ongoing process that symbolically forms and re-forms our personal identities." (Craig, 125).  The other view of communication, the Transmission Model, sees communication as robotic and computer-like.  The Transmission Model sees communication as a way of sending or receiving messages and the perfection of that.  But, the Constructionist View sees communications as, "…in human life, info does not behave as simply as bits in an electronic stream.  In human life, information flow is far more like an electric current running from one landmine to another" (Lanham, 7).  The Constructionist View is a more realistic view of communication {{opinion|date=October 2011}} because it involves the interacting of human beings and the free sharing of thoughts and ideas.  Daniel Chandler looks to prove that the Transmission Model is a lesser way of communicating by saying "The transmission model is not merely a gross over-simplification but a dangerously misleading representation of the nature of human communication" (Chandler, 2).  Humans do not communicate simply as computers or robots so that's why it's essential to truly understand the Constructionist View of Communication well.  We do not simply send facts and data to one another, but we take facts and data and they acquire meaning through the process of communication, or through interaction with others.
*Systemic:  This view{{who|date=October 2011}} considers communication to be the new messages created via "through-put", or what happens as the message is being interpreted and re-interpreted as it travels through people.
*Critical: This view considers communication as a source of power and oppression of individuals and social groups.&lt;ref&gt;Littlejohn, S.W. and Foss, K.A. (2008). Theories of human communication, 9th edition. Belmont, CA: Thomson Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspection of a particular theory on this level will provide a framework on the nature of communication as seen within the confines of that theory.

Theories can also be studied and organized according to the ontological, epistemological, and axiological framework imposed by the theorist.

== Ontology ==

[[Ontology]] essentially poses the question of what, exactly, the theorist is examining. One must consider the very nature of reality.  The answer usually falls in one of three realms depending on whether the theorist sees the phenomena through the lens of a realist, nominalist, or social constructionist. Realist perspective views the world objectively, believing that there is a world outside of our own experience and cognitions.  Nominalists see the world subjectively, claiming that everything outside of one's cognitions is simply names and labels.  Social constructionists straddle the fence between objective and subjective reality, claiming that reality is what we create together.{{lopsided|date=October 2011}}{{POV statement|date=October 2011}}

== Epistemology ==
[[Epistemology]] is an examination of the approaches and beliefs which inform particular modes of study of phenomena and domains of expertise. In positivist approaches to epistemology, objective knowledge is seen as the result of the empirical observation and perceptual experience. In the history of science, empirical evidence collected by way of pragmatic-calculation and the scientific method is believed to be the most likely to reflect truth in the findings. Such approaches are meant to predict a phenomenon.  Subjective theory holds that understanding is based on situated knowledge, typically found using interpretative methodology such as ethnography and also interviews. Subjective theories are typically developed to explain or understand phenomena in the social world.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

== Axiology ==

[[Axiology]] is concerned with how values inform research and theory development.{{sfn|Miller|2005}} Most communication theory is guided by one of three axiological approaches.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}  The first approach recognizes that values will influence theorists' interests but suggests that those values must be set aside once actual research begins. Outside replication of research findings is particularly important in this approach to prevent individual researchers' values from contaminating their findings and interpretations.{{sfn|Miller|2005|p=30}} The second approach rejects the idea that values can be eliminated from any stage of theory development. Within this approach, theorists do not try to divorce their values from inquiry. Instead, they remain mindful of their values so that they understand how those values contextualize, influence or skew their findings.{{sfn|Miller|2005|pp=30–31}} The third approach not only rejects the idea that values can be separated from research and theory, but rejects the idea that they should be separated.  This approach is often adopted by [[critical theorists]] who believe that the role of communication theory is to identify oppression and produce social change. In this axiological approach, theorists embrace their values and work to reproduce those values in their research and theory development.{{sfn|Miller|2005|p=31}}

[[Image:Coppa decorata con scene di carnevale.JPG|thumb|right|Decorated cup from Murano|alt=Decorated cup]]'''Murano glass''' is made on the [[wikt:Venetian|Venetian]] [[island]] of [[Murano]], which has been a glassmaking center for over 700 years. It is also sometimes referred to as [[Venetian glass]]. Today Murano is known for its [[art glass]], but it has a long history of innovations in glassmaking in addition to its artistic fame—and was Europe's first major glassmaking center. During the 1400s, Murano glassmakers created ''[[cristallo]]''—which was almost transparent and considered the finest glass in the world. Murano glassmakers also developed a white-colored glass ([[milk glass]] called ''lattimo'') that looked like [[porcelain]]. They later became Europe's finest makers of mirrors.

Originally, Venice was controlled by the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]], but it eventually became an independent [[city state]]. It flourished as a trading center and seaport. Its connections with the [[Middle East]] helped its glassmakers gain additional skills, as glassmaking was more advanced in countries such as [[Syria]] and [[Egypt]]. Although Venetian glassmaking existed as far back as the 8th Century, it became concentrated in Murano by law beginning 1291. Since glass factories often caught fire, this removed much of the possibility of a major fire disaster for the city. Murano glassmakers developed secret recipes and methods for making glass, and the concentration of Venice's glassmaking on the island of Murano enabled better control of those secrets.

Murano became Europe's elite glassmaking center, peaking in popularity in the 15th and 16th centuries. Venice's dominance in trade along the [[Mediterranean Sea]] created a wealthy merchant class that was a strong connoisseur of the arts. This helped establish demand for art glass and more innovations. The spread of glassmaking talent in Europe eventually diminished the importance of Venice and its Murano glassmakers. A defeat by [[Napoleon]] Bonaparte in 1797, and occupation, caused more hardship for Murano's glassmaking industry. Murano glassmaking began a revival in the 1920s. Today, Murano and Venice are tourist attractions, and Murano is home to numerous glass factories and a few individual artists' studios. Its ''[[Museo del Vetro]]'' (Glass Museum) in the [[Palazzo Giustinian]] contains displays on the history of glassmaking as well as glass samples ranging from Egyptian times through the present day.

==Background==
{{See also|Republic of Venice}}
[[Image:Leguna Veneta.png|thumb|right|Venice and Murano|alt=map of Venice, Murano, and Italy]]The Venetian [[city state]] grew during the [[decline of the Roman Empire]] as people fled [[Sack of Rome (410)|barbarian invasions]] to the safety of islands in a [[lagoon]]. Small communities grew in the lagoon, and Venice became the most prominent. The city of Venice became a highly successful trading port, and by the [[11th century]] dominated trade between [[Europe]], [[North Africa]], and the [[Middle East]]. It also had a strong [[navy]]. European [[Crusades|Crusaders]] passed through Venice on their way to the [[Holy Land]]. Treasures of many kinds were bought and sold in Venice: spices, [[precious metal]]s, [[gemstone]]s, [[ivory]], [[silk]]s—and [[glass]]. Successful trade bred a wealthy merchant class in addition to the [[Nobility|nobles]], and the wealthy were responsible for Venice's famous art and architecture.&lt;ref name="Zerwick49"&gt;{{harvnb|Zerwick|1990|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glass began being produced in Venice around 450, as glassmakers from [[Aquileia]] fled to the islands to escape barbarian invaders.&lt;ref name="Shotwell586"&gt;{{harvnb|Shotwell|2002|p=586}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest [[archaeological]] evidence of a glass factory in the area is from the Venetian lagoon island of [[Torcello]], which dates from the 7th to 8th century.&lt;ref name="Toso25"&gt;{{harvnb|Toso|2000|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original Venetian glassmakers were joined by glassmakers from Byzantium (a.k.a. [[Constantinople]]) and the Middle East—which enriched their glassmaking knowledge.&lt;ref name="Shotwell586"/&gt; Glass was made in the Middle East long before it was made in Europe.{{#tag:ref|The region between the [[Tigris–Euphrates river system|Tigris and Euphrates]] rivers is considered the birthplace of glassmaking. Glass was made there before 2000 B.C.&lt;ref name="Shotwell343"&gt;{{harvnb|Shotwell|2002|p=343}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glass was made in [[History of Syria|Syria]] as far back as 1700 B.C., and around 100 B.C. the Syrians started [[glassblowing]].&lt;ref name="Shotwell546"&gt;{{harvnb|Shotwell|2002|p=546}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] were making small glass vessels as far back as 1470 B.C. Their glassmaking became more sophisticated after the founding of [[Alexandria]] in 322 B.C.&lt;ref name="Shotwell155"&gt;{{harvnb|Shotwell|2002|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} Early products were beads, glass for [[mosaic]]s, jewelry, small mirrors, and window glass.&lt;ref name="Shotwell587"&gt;{{harvnb|Shotwell|2002|p=587}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Venetian glassmaking grew in importance to the city's economy. Around 1271, the local glassmakers' guild made rules to help preserve glassmaking secrets. Trade secrets were forbidden to be divulged outside of Venice. If a glassworker left the city without permission, he would be ordered to return.{{#tag:ref|While the Murano glassmakers were typically men, records exist beginning in the 1400s of women working in the manufacture of glass in Murano. A record from 1446 describes the employment of a woman who decorated glass and worked for Salvatore Barovier.&lt;ref name="Toso46"/&gt;|group=Note}} If he failed to return, his family would be imprisoned. If he still did not return, an assassin would be sent to kill him. Additional rules were made regarding ingredients used for making glass and the type of wood used as fuel for the furnaces.&lt;ref name="Shotwell586587"&gt;{{harvnb|Shotwell|2002|pp=586–587}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Island of Murano===
[[Image:"Le doge de Venise visitant les verreries de Murano".jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Doge of Venice|Doge]] visits Murano|alt=Dignitary visiting a glass factory in Murano]]
A November 8, 1291, law ordered most of Venice's glassmaking industry to be on the "island of [[Murano]]".&lt;ref name="Commerce789"&gt;{{harvnb|United States Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce|1917|p=789}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murano is actually a cluster of islands linked by short bridges, and located about {{convert|1|mi}} north of Venice in the Venetian lagoon.&lt;ref name="Commerce789"/&gt; The furnaces used to make molten glass were a fire hazard, especially to cities with wooden structures nearby. The removal of the threat of a disaster from fire was not the only reason for moving the glassmaking industry to Murano. The glassmaking, ''and the glassmakers'', were kept in Murano. The Venetian government did what it believed was necessary to prevent the spread of Venetian glassmaking expertise to potential competitors. Glassmakers could not leave the island without permission from the government. Leaving without permission, or revealing trade secrets, was punishable by death. Another advantage for the Murano location was that imports and exports could easily be monitored.&lt;ref name="Shotwell366"&gt;{{harvnb|Shotwell|2002|p=366}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murano in the 1200s was a summer resort where the aristocrats of Venice built villas with orchards and gardens. It took about an hour to row a boat from Venice to Murano.&lt;ref name="Zerwick4950"&gt;{{harvnb|Zerwick|1990|pp=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the glassmakers could not leave the island, the nobles had no constraints. Despite their travel restrictions, the glassmakers lived on a beautiful island, were under the direct rule of Venice's [[Council of Ten]], and had extra privileges.&lt;ref name="Moore31"&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|1935|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; They did not work during the hot summer, as furnace repair and maintenance was conducted at that time.&lt;ref name="Dillon182"&gt;{{harvnb|Dillon|1907|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1300s, the annual summer vacation lasted five months.&lt;ref name="Toso37"&gt;{{harvnb|Toso|2000|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1400s, the summer vacation was shortened to three and one half months.&lt;ref name="Toso45"&gt;{{harvnb|Toso|2000|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, the Murano glassworkers believed they were not working enough.{{#tag:ref|In the 1540s, the Murano glassworkers were unhappy with the 35-week work year, complaining that they ''did not get enough time to work''—contrary to typical complaints of too much work.&lt;ref name="Moore33"&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|1935|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}  Glassmakers also enjoyed heightened status. On December 22, 1376, it was announced that if a glassmaker's daughter married a nobleman, there was no forfeiture of social class—and their children were noble.&lt;ref name="Toso40"&gt;{{harvnb|Toso|2000|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major products and innovations==

The glassmakers of Murano are known for many innovations and refinements to glassmaking. Among them are [[Murano beads]], ''[[cristallo]]'', [[Milk glass|''lattimo'']], [[chandelier]]s, and mirrors.&lt;ref name="Shotwell366"/&gt; Additional refinements or creations are [[Goldstone (glass)|goldstone]], multicolored glass ([[millefiori]]), and imitation gemstones made of glass.&lt;ref name="Geary202"&gt;{{harvnb|Geary|2008|p=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to guarding their secret processes and glass recipes, Venetian/Murano glassmakers strived for beauty with their glass.&lt;ref name="HarperJan1882P181183"&gt;{{cite magazine |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Ancient and Modern Venetian Glass of Murano |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yktOAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA183&amp;dq=Giuseppe+Briati+chandelier&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiugpviidndAhWOr1kKHYyQC6E4ChDoAQgrMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Giuseppe%20Briati%20chandelier&amp;f=false |magazine= Harper's New Monthly Magazine&lt;!-- Page 181 and 183 --&gt;|location=New York |publisher=Harper and Brothers |date=1882-01-01 |access-date=2018-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aventurine===
Aventurine glass, also known as goldstone glass, is translucent brownish with metallic (copper) specs. It was developed by Venetian glassmakers in the early 15th century.&lt;ref name="Shotwell24"&gt;{{harvnb|Shotwell|2002|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is first cited in historical documents in 1626.&lt;ref name="Toso97"&gt;{{harvnb|Toso|2000|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name aventurine is used because it was discovered accidentally.&lt;ref name="Toso97"/&gt;

===Beads===
Glass beads (a.k.a. [[Murano beads]]) were made by the Venetians beginning in the 1200s. The beads were used as [[Prayer beads|rosary beads]] and jewelry. They were also popular in [[Africa]]. [[Christopher Columbus]] noted that the people of the [[New World]] (Native Americans) were "delighted" with the beads as gifts, and beads became popular with [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]].&lt;ref name="Zerwick5051"&gt;{{harvnb|Zerwick|1990|pp=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Calcedonio''===
''Calcedonio'' is a marbled glass that looked like the semiprecious stone [[chalcedony]].&lt;ref name="Getty90"&gt;{{harvnb|Hess|Husband|J. Paul Getty Museum|1999|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of glass was created during the 1400s by [[Angelo Barovier]], who is considered Murano's greatest glassmaker.&lt;ref name="Chambers21"&gt;{{harvnb|Chambers|Oldknow|Ft. Wayne Museum of Art|Tampa Museum of Art|1999|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barovier was an expert glassblower, revived enameling, and also worked with colored glass.  His family had been involved with glassmaking since at least 1331, and the family continued in the business after his death.&lt;ref name="McCray"&gt;{{harvnb|McCray|2002|p=chapter 2 of e-book}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died in 1460.{{#tag:ref|At least three authors agree that Angelo Barovier died in 1460.&lt;ref name="Toso46"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shotwell30"&gt;{{harvnb|Shotwell|2002|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The date of his birth is less certain, but is said to be around 1400.&lt;ref name="Chambers22"/&gt;|group=Note}}

===Chandeliers===
During the 1700s, Giuseppe Briati was famous for his work with ornamented mirrors and chandeliers.&lt;ref name="HarperJan1882P181183"/&gt; Briati's chandelier style was called ''ciocche''—literally bouquet of flowers. Briati's typical chandelier was large with multiple arms decorated with garlands, flowers and leaves. One of the common uses of the huge Murano chandeliers was interior lighting for theatres and important rooms in palaces. Briati was born in Murano in 1686, and his family's business was glassmaking. He was allowed to work in a Bohemian glass factory, where he learned the secrets of working with Bohemian crystal—which was becoming more popular than Murano ''cristallo''. In 1739, the Council of Ten allowed him to move his furnace from Murano to Venice because his work had caused such jealousy that he and his workers feared for their lives. (His father had been stabbed to death in 1701.)&lt;ref name="Toso122124"&gt;{{harvnb|Toso|2000|pp=122–124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Briati retired in 1762, and his nephew became manager of the glass works. Briati died in Venice in 1772, and is buried in Murano.&lt;ref name="Toso127"&gt;{{harvnb|Toso|2000|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Cristallo''===
''Cristallo'' is a soda glass, created during the 15th century by Murano's Angelo Barovier.{{#tag:ref|Angelo Barovier is generally credited with creating ''cristallo'', and was definitely making it in 1455.&lt;ref name="Moore37"&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|1935|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; One set of authors believes that ''cristallo'' was an incremental "development that stretched over nearly two centuries."&lt;ref name="Syson186"&gt;{{harvnb|Syson|Thornton|2000|p=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; They speculate that Barovier perfected the soda ash purification process used for ''cristallo'', and also discovered the stabilizer.&lt;ref name="Syson186"/&gt;|group=Note}} The oldest reference to ''cristallo'' is dated May 24, 1453.&lt;ref name="Toso46"&gt;{{harvnb|Toso|2000|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, ''cristallo'' was considered Europe's clearest glass, and is one of the main reasons Murano became "the most important glass center".&lt;ref name="Shotwell366"/&gt; It looked like [[quartz]], which was said to have magical qualities and often used in religious objects. ''Cristallo'' became very popular.&lt;ref name="Chambers22"&gt;{{harvnb|Chambers|Oldknow|Ft. Wayne Museum of Art|Tampa Museum of Art|1999|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of glass was fragile and difficult to cut, but it could be [[Enamelled glass|enameled]] and [[Glass engraving|engraved]].&lt;ref name="Shotwell110"&gt;{{harvnb|Shotwell|2002|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Glass coloring and color marking#Coloring ions|Manganese]] was a key ingredient in the secret formula used to make ''cristallo''.&lt;ref name="Shotwell587"/&gt; An easy modification to ''cristallo'' made in Murano was to produce a frosted or crackle version.&lt;ref name="Dillon203"&gt;{{harvnb|Dillon|1907|p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Filigrana''===
The ''filigrana'' (a.k.a. filigree) style was developed in Murano in the 1500s. By embedding glass canes (usually white but not always) in colorless glass, the glassware has a striped appearance. ''Vetro a fili'' has straight white stripes, ''vetro a retortoli'' has twisted or spiral patterns, and ''vetro a reticello'' has two sets of lines twisted in opposite directions. Francesco Zeno has been mentioned as the inventor of ''vetro a retortoli''.&lt;ref name="Page18"&gt;{{harvnb|Page|Doménech|2004|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Lattimo''===
''Lattimo'', or milk glass, began being made in Murano during the 15th century, and Angelo Barovier is credited with its re-discovery and development.&lt;ref name="Getty73"&gt;{{harvnb|Hess|Husband|J. Paul Getty Museum|1999|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; This glass is opaque white, and was meant to resemble enameled porcelain.&lt;ref name="Shotwell294"&gt;{{harvnb|Shotwell|2002|p=294}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was often decorated with enamel showing sacred scenes or views of Venice.&lt;ref name="Fuga257"&gt;{{harvnb|Fuga|2006|p=257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Millefiori''===
''Millefiori'' glass is a variation of the [[murrine]] technique made from colored [[caneworking|canes]] in clear glass, and is often arranged in flower-like patterns. The Italian word ''millefiori'' means thousand flowers.&lt;ref name="Shotwell24"/&gt; This technique was perfected in Alexandria, Egypt, and began being used in Murano in the 15th century.&lt;ref name="Fuga282"&gt;{{harvnb|Fuga|2006|p=282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mirrors===
Small mirrors were made in Murano beginning in the 1500s, and mirror makers had their own guild beginning in 1569.&lt;ref name="Shotwell351"&gt;{{harvnb|Shotwell|2002|p=351}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murano mirrors were known for the artwork on the frame that held the mirror in addition to their quality.&lt;ref name="Shotwell351"/&gt; By the 1600s, Murano mirrors were in great demand. However, by the end of the century, English-made mirrors had the best quality. Only one glass house in Murano was still making mirrors by 1772.&lt;ref name="Moore48"&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|1935|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Murrine===
Murrine technique begins with the layering of colored liquid glass, heated to {{convert|1900|°F|°C|abbr=on}}, which is then stretched into long rods called canes. When cooled, these canes are then sliced in cross-sections, which reveals the layered pattern. Ercole Barovier, a descendent of Murano's greatest glassmaker Angelo Barovier, won numerous awards during the 1940s and 1950s for his innovations using the murrine technique.&lt;ref name="AC19990219P123"&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Sommerso''===
''Sommerso'' ("submerged" in Italian), is a form of artistic Murano glass that has layers of contrasting colors (typically two), which are formed by dipping colored glass into another molten glass and then blowing the combination into a desired shape. The outermost layer, or casing, is often clear. ''Sommerso'' was developed in Murano during the late 1930s. [[Flavio Poli]] was known for using this technique, and it was made popular by Seguso Vetri d'Arte and the Mandruzzato family in the 1950s. This process is a popular technique for vases, and is sometimes used for sculptures.&lt;ref name="AC19990219P123"/&gt;

==Golden age, decline, and revival==
{{See also|Fall of the Republic of Venice}}
[[File:Coupe avec cortège allégorique (Louvre, OA 7564).jpg|thumb|right|alt=jar on stand with lid, multiple colors|Barovier enameled glass]]The [[16th century]] was the golden age for glassmaking in Murano. Major trading partners included the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish Indies]], Italy, Spain, Turkey, and the German-speaking states.&lt;ref name="Toso61"&gt;{{harvnb|Toso|2000|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least 28 glassmaking furnaces were in Murano in 1581.&lt;ref name="Toso62"&gt;{{harvnb|Toso|2000|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous leaders and dignitaries visited Murano during this century, including the queen of France, dukes, princes, generals, cardinals, archbishops, and ambassadors.&lt;ref name="Toso64"&gt;{{harvnb|Toso|2000|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collectors of Murano glass included [[Henry VIII of England]], [[Pope Clement VII]], [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|King Ferdinand of Hungary]], [[Francis I of France]], and [[Phillip II of Spain]].&lt;ref name="Toso66"&gt;{{harvnb|Toso|2000|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, the dominance of ''cristallo'' came to an end. In 1673, [[England|English]] glass merchant [[George Ravenscroft]] created a clear glass he called ''crystalline''—but it was not stable. Three years later, he improved this glass by adding lead oxide, and [[lead glass]] (a.k.a. crystal) was created.&lt;ref name="Toso102"&gt;{{harvnb|Toso|2000|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ravenscroft, who had lived for many years in Venice, made lead crystal that was less breakable than ''cristallo''.&lt;ref name="Zerwick65"&gt;{{harvnb|Zerwick|1990|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1674, [[Bohemia]]n glassmaker Louis Le Vasseur made crystal that was similar to Ravenscroft's.&lt;ref name="Toso103"&gt;{{harvnb|Toso|2000|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1678, Johan Friedrich Kunkel von Lowenstein produced a ''cristallo''-like glass in [[Potsdam]].&lt;ref name="Toso105"&gt;{{harvnb|Toso|2000|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bohemian and [[Prussia]]n-style glass was later modified by the addition of lime and chalk. This new glass is attributed to Bohemian glassmaker Michael Müller in 1683.&lt;ref name="Toso105"/&gt; The Bohemian glass was not suitable to the Murano-style artwork on the glass. However, this harder glass was produced as a thicker glass suitable for engraving and grinding. The Bohemian and English glass eventually became more popular than ''cristallo'' made in Murano.&lt;ref name="Toso105"/&gt; By the 1700s, Murano glass was traded mostly with Italian states and the Turkish empire. Small quantities were traded with England, Flanders, the Netherlands and Spain.&lt;ref name="Toso109"&gt;{{harvnb|Toso|2000|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Napoleon]] conquered Venice during May 1797, and the Venetian Republic came to an end.&lt;ref name="Madden17"&gt;{{harvnb|Madden|2012|p=Ch. 17 of e-book}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fall of the Venetian Republic caused hard times for glassmaking in Murano, and some of the Murano methods became lost. Controlled by France and Austria, Venetian glassmaking became unprofitable because of tariffs and taxes—and glassmakers that survived were reduced to making mostly beads.&lt;ref name="CE19980911P15"&gt;{{cite news

==Making glass==
[[File:Making a Glass Horse (7251890544).jpg|thumb|right|alt=tools holding glass horse being shaped|Glassmaking tools in use]]
From its beginning until the fall of the Venetian Republic, Murano glass was mostly a very high quality [[Soda-lime glass|soda lime glass]] (using today's terminology) that had extra attention focused on its appearance. Glass from that time typically contained 65 to 70 percent [[Silicon dioxide|silica]].&lt;ref name="Janssens26"&gt;{{harvnb|Janssens|2011|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A flux, usually [[Sodium oxide|soda]] (sodium oxide as 10 to 20 percent of the glass composition) was added to enable the silica to melt at a lower temperature. A stabilizer, usually [[Calcium oxide|lime]] (calcium oxide as about 10 percent of the glass) was also added for durability and to prevent solubility in water. Small quantities of other ingredients were added to the glass, mostly to affect appearance.&lt;ref name="Janssens528"&gt;{{harvnb|Janssens|2011|p=528}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sand is a common source for silica. For certain types of glass, the Murano glassmakers used quartz as their source for silica. Quartz pebbles were crushed into a fine powder. Two sources for sand were [[Crete|Creta]] and [[Sicily]]. Quartz pebbles were selected from the [[Ticino (river)|Ticino]] and [[Adige]] rivers in [[Northern Italy]].&lt;ref name="Janssens524"&gt;{{harvnb|Janssens|2011|p=524}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their source for soda was what they called [[Salsola soda|''allume catina'']]—plant ash found in the eastern [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] countries of the Middle East.&lt;ref name="Janssens26"/&gt; Beginning in the 16th century, ''allume catina'' was also imported from Mediterranean coastal regions of Spain and France.&lt;ref name="Janssens524"/&gt;
 
The mixing and melting of the batch of ingredients was a two-stage process. First, nearly equal amounts of silica and flux were continuously stirred in a special furnace. The furnace was called a ''calchera'' furnace, and the mix was called ''fritta''. In the second stage, the ''fritta'' was mixed with selected recycled waste glass (cullet) and melted in another furnace.&lt;ref name="Janssens523"&gt;{{harvnb|Janssens|2011|p=523}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the type and color of glass, other additives were used. [[Lead]] and [[tin]] were added for white opaque glass (''latimo''). [[Cobalt]] was used for blue glass. [[Copper]] and [[iron]] were used for green and for various shades of green, blue, and yellow.&lt;ref name="Janssens531-532"&gt;{{harvnb|Janssens|2011|pp=531–532}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manganese was used to remove colors.&lt;ref name="Janssens526"&gt;{{harvnb|Janssens|2011|p=526}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although natural gas is the furnace fuel of choice for glassmaking today, the fuel mandated in Murano during the 13th century was [[alder]] and [[willow]] wood.&lt;ref name="Toso25"/&gt; During this second stage, the surface of the molten glass was skimmed to remove undesirable chemicals that affected the appearance of the glass.&lt;ref name="Janssens523"/&gt; Additional techniques were used as glassmaking evolved. To improve clarity, molten glass was put in water and then re-melted. Another technique was to purify the flux by boiling and filtering.&lt;ref name="Janssens528"/&gt;

===Tools===
The Venetian glassmakers had a set of tools that changed little for hundreds of years. A ''ferro sbuso'', also called a ''canna da soffio'', is the [[Glassblowing|blowpipe]] essential for extracting molten glass and beginning the shaping process.&lt;ref name="Mentasti188"&gt;{{harvnb|Mentasti|1992|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''borselle'' is a tong-like tool of various sizes used to shape glass that has not hardened. A ''borselle puntata'' is a similar tool, only it has a pattern that an be imprinted on the glass.&lt;ref name="Shotwell48"&gt;{{harvnb|Shotwell|2002|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''pontello'' is an iron rod that holds the glass while work is done on the edge of the glass.&lt;ref name="Toso45"/&gt;  A ''tagianti'' is a large scissors used to cut glass before it has hardened. A ''scagno'' is the workbench used by the glassmaker.&lt;ref name="Dorigato31"&gt;{{harvnb|Dorigato|2003|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Good tools are nice, but good hands are better," is an old Murano saying that reinforces the idea that the glassmakers of Murano rely on their skills instead of any advantage caused by special tools.&lt;ref name="CMOGtools"&gt;{{cite web

Some of Murano's historical glass factories remain well known [[brand]]s today, including De Biasi, Gabbiani, [[Paolo Venini|Venini]], [[Salviati (glassmakers)|Salviati]], [[Barovier &amp; Toso]], [[Pauly &amp; C. - Compagnia Venezia Murano|Pauly]], [[Berengo Studio]], [[Seguso]], Formia International, Simone Cenedese, Alessandro Mandruzzato, Vetreria Ducale, Estevan Rossetto 1950 and others. The oldest glass factory is Antica Vetreria Fratelli Toso, founded in 1854.&lt;ref name="Gable44"&gt;{{harvnb|Gable|2004|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the industry has been shrinking as demand has waned. Imitation works (recognizable by experts but not by the typical tourist) from Asia and Eastern Europe take an estimated 40 to 45 percent of the market for Murano glass, and public tastes have changed while the designs in Murano have largely stayed the same. To fight the imitation problem, a group of companies and concerned individuals created a trademark in 1994 that certifies that the product was made on Murano. By 2012, about 50 companies were using the Artistic Glass Murano® trademark of origin.&lt;ref name="TheGuardianMuranoWeb"/&gt;

Glassmaking is a difficult and uncomfortable profession, as glassmakers must work with a product heated to extremely high temperatures. Unlike 500 years ago, children of glassmakers do not enjoy any special privileges, extra wealth, or marriage into nobility. Today, it is difficult to recruit young glassmakers.&lt;!--One Murano glassmaker, who had worked in the business for generations, told the author that his son would rather play soccer and had no interest in glass.--&gt; Foreign imitations, and difficulty attracting young workers, caused the number of professional glassmakers in Murano to decrease from about 6,000 in 1990 to fewer than 1,000 by 2012.&lt;ref name="TheGuardianMuranoWeb"&gt;{{cite web

 &lt;!--The trademark was introduced by and continues to be regulated by Region of Veneto Law no.70 of the 23/12/1994. Factories on the island are not required to apply for the trademark and many choose not to, but if a work carries the trademark, its authenticity is guaranteed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muranoglass.com/en/#.UnjvnUqZ5KQ Guide to Murano trademark]&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

Research in [[artificial intelligence (AI)]] is known to have impacted [[medical diagnosis]], [[Algorithmic trading|stock trading]], [[robot control]], and several other fields. Perhaps less popular is the contribution of AI in the field of [[music]]. Nevertheless, artificial intelligence and music (AIM) has, for a long time, been a common subject in several conferences and workshops, including the [[International Computer Music Conference]], the Computing Society Conference &lt;ref&gt;[http://www-rcf.usc.edu/~echew/INFORMS/ics2005.html INFORMS Computing Society Conference: Annapolis: Music, Computation and AI] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120630221600/http://www-rcf.usc.edu/~echew/INFORMS/ics2005.html |date=2012-06-30 }}. Rcf.usc.edu. Retrieved on 2010-12-22.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence]]. In fact, the first International Computer Music Conference was the ICMC 1974, Michigan State University, East Lansing, USA &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computermusic.org/page/23/ International Computer Music Association - ICMC]. Computermusic.org (2010-11-15). Retrieved on 2010-12-22.&lt;/ref&gt;
Current research includes the application of AI in [[Musical composition|music composition]], [[performance]], theory and digital [[Audio signal processing|sound processing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a714908257?words=artificial*|intelligence*|music* Research in Music and Artificial Intelligence - Ergonomics Abstracts]. Informaworld.com. Retrieved on 2010-12-22.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Several music [[software]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s have been developed that use AI to produce music&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = A Functional Taxonomy of Music Generation Systems

A prominent feature is the capability of the A.I. algorithm to learn based on information obtained such as the computer accompaniment technology, which is capable of listening to and following a human performer so it can perform in synchrony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f275/4c359d7ef052ab5997d71dc3e9443404565a.pdf|title=Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Music Understanding|last=Dannenberg|first=Roger|date=|website=Semantic Scholar|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artificial intelligence also drives the so-called interactive composition technology, wherein a computer composes music in response to the performance of a live musician. There are several other A.I. applications to music that covers not only music composition, production, and performance but also the way it is marketed and consumed. Companies like [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and [[Spotify]] rely on user data to augment their engagement metrics to power their ability to get consumers to listen more to music or push the right songs to users according to their preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kristinwestcottgrant/2017/12/10/how-to-think-about-artificial-intelligence-in-the-music-industry/#55a5c0eb7d4a|title=How To Think About Artificial Intelligence In The Music Industry|last=Grant|first=Kristin Westcott|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
In 1960, Russian researcher R.Kh.Zaripov published worldwide first paper on algorithmic music composing using the "[[Ural (computer)|Ural-1]]" computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zaripov|first=R.Kh.|title=Об алгоритмическом описании процесса сочинения музыки (On algorithmic description of process of music composition)|journal=[[Proceedings of the USSR Academy of Sciences]]|year=1960|volume=132|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, inventor Ray Kurzweil premiered a piano piece created by a computer that was capable of pattern recognition in various compositions. The computer was then able to analyze and use these patterns to create novel melodies. The computer was debuted on Steve Allen's I've Got a Secret program, and stumped the hosts until film star Henry Morgan guessed Ray's secret.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kurzweiltech.com/raybio.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software applications==

===Interactive scores===
Multimedia Scenarios in interactive scores are represented by
temporal objects,
temporal relations and
interactive objects. Examples of temporal objects are sounds, videos and light controls.
Temporal objects can be triggered by interactive objects (usually launched by the user) and
several temporal objects can be executed simultaneously.  A temporal object may contain

===EMI===
A program developed by David Cope which composes classical music. See [[Experiments in Musical Intelligence]]. [[Emily Howell]] is an interactive augmentation of EMI. (As a popular example, the background music of the [[viral video]] [[Humans Need Not Apply]] was created by "her", as revealed in the video to illustrate the likely fate of creative jobs.)

===OrchExtra===

This program was designed to provide small-budget productions with instrumentation for all instruments usually present in the full-fledged orchestra. If there is a small orchestra playing, the program can play the part for missing instruments. High school and community theaters wanting to produce a musical can now benefit from the virtual orchestra and realize a full Broadway score. This software is able to follow the fluctuations in tempo and musical expression. Musicians enjoy the thrill of playing with a full orchestra, while the audience enjoys the rich sound that comes from the combination of the virtual orchestra with the musicians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rms.biz/index.cfm?page=OrchEXTRA Realtime Music Solutions] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20060910191858/http://www.rms.biz/index.cfm?page=OrchEXTRA |date=2006-09-10 }}.

===SmartMusic ===
SmartMusic is an interactive, computer-based practice tool for musicians. It offers exercises, instant feedback tools, and accompaniments meant to aid musicians. The product is targeted at teachers and students alike and offers five categories of accompaniments: solo, skill development, method books, jazz, and ensemble. Teachers can give students pre-defined assignments via email and scan in sheet music that is not yet in the SmartMusic catalog. Students can choose the difficulty level they want to play at, slow down or speed up the tempo, or change the key in which to play the piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smartmusic.com/| title=Discover SmartMusic|website=smartmusic.com|publisher = MakeMusic, Inc.|accessdate=September 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; SmartMusic also compares students' playing with digital template, which allows it to detect mistakes and mark them on a score. It also simulates the rapport between musicians by sensing and reacting to tempo changes.

===StarPlayIt===

StarPlay is also a music education software that allows the user to practice by performing with professional musicians, bands and orchestras. They can choose their spot and watch the video from that spot. They can hear the other musicians playing. Again, the program listens to the user's performance and helps them improve their performance by providing constructive feedback as they rehearse. StarPlay was developed by StarPlayIt (formerly In The Chair), a music technology company that has won many awards for its platforms for online musical performance and participation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inthechair.com/index.php (BROKEN LINK) StarPlayit music learning and video game technology platform].

===REAPER's TabEditor===
MIDI to string instrument (guitar, violin, dombra, etc.) tablature conversion is a nontrivial task, as the same note can reside on different strings of the instrument. And the creation of good fingering is sometimes a challenge even for real musicians, especially when translating a two handed piano composition on a string instrument.
So in TabEditor&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.cockos.com/wiki/index.php/TabEditor TabEditor]&lt;/ref&gt; (the tiny plugin for [[REAPER]] DAW), an AI was used that solves this puzzle the same way as a musician would: trying to keep all the notes close to each other (to be possible to play) while trying to fit all the piano notes into a range that can be played simultaneously on the instrument. When direct translation is impossible (piano part has more notes than are possible on the guitar) the AI tries to find an acceptable solution, removing as few notes as possible from the original composition.
The Prolog programming language was used to create this AI.

===Ludwig===
Ludwig&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.write-music.com The automatic composition software Ludwig]. www.write-music.com. Retrieved on 2011-10-27.&lt;/ref&gt; is an automated composition software based on tree search algorithms. Ludwig generates melodies according to principles of classical music theory. The software arranges its melodies with pop-automation patterns or in four-part choral writing. Ludwig can react in real-time on an eight-bar theme played on a keyboard. The theme will be analysed for key, harmonic content and rhythm while it is being performed  by a human. The program then without delay repeats the theme arranged e.g. for orchestra. It subsequently varies the melody to create a little piece as interactive answer to the human input.

===OMax===
OMax&lt;ref&gt;[http://omax.ircam.fr/ The OMax Project Page]&lt;/ref&gt; is a software environment which  learns in real-time typical features of a musician's style and  plays along with him interactively, giving the flavor of a machine co-improvisation. OMax uses OpenMusic and Max. It is based on researches on stylistic modeling carried out by Gerard Assayag and Shlomo Dubnov and on researches on improvisation with the computer by G. Assayag, M. Chemillier and G. Bloch (Aka the OMax Brothers) in the [[Ircam]] Music Representations group.

===Melomics===
Melomics is a proprietary computational system for the automatic (without human intervention) composition of music, based on bioinspired methods and produced by Melomics Media.  Composing a wide variety of genres, all music composed by Melomics algorithms are available in MP3, MIDI, MusicXML, and PDF (of sheet music), after purchase. Music composed by this algorithm was organized into an album named [[Iamus (album)]], which was hailed by New Scientist as "The first complete album to be composed solely by a computer and recorded by human musicians."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite   journal | title= Computer composer honours Turing's centenary| journal= New Scientist| date =5 July 2012| url =https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21528724.300-computer-composer-honours-turings-centenary.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The system uses an optimization approach based on a variable neighborhood search algorithm to morph existing template pieces into novel pieces with a set level of tonal tension that changes dynamically throughout the piece. This optimization approach allows for the integration of a pattern detection technique in order to enforce long term structure and recurring themes in the generated music. Pieces composed by MorpheuS have been performed at concerts in both Stanford and London.

===MXX===
Founded in 2015, MXX (Mashtraxx Ltd) is a creative AI technology company, which has developed the world’s first AI engine that atomises and edits music to video instantly.
 
The MXX technology is the only artificially intelligent music editor that can work on the stereo file alone, without the need for stems, and can adapt the narrative to fit a brief just like a music editor would.
 
With the MXX products, music can be adapted to perfectly wrap around certain experiences such as UGC of different lengths and forms; users workouts and runs; computer game dynamic narratives; and object-based media viewing of dynamic lengths. This presents a new future for music in itself, as music is one of the few remaining static artefacts in a world where all media needs to be more dynamic and flexible.
 
The first MXX product, Audition Pro, enables anyone to edit music against video with intensity rises, fades, dropouts and climax points, load any track, and immediately listen to the edited track, and makes responding to the demands of today’s media fast and simple.

In music, a '''notehead''' is the elliptical part of a [[Musical note|note]]. Noteheads may be the same shape but colored completely black or white, indicating the [[note value]] (i.e., rhythmic duration). In a [[whole note]], the notehead, shaped differently than shorter notes, is the only component of the note. Shorter note values attach a [[stem (music)|stem]] to the notehead, and possibly [[beam (music)|beam]]s or flags. The longer [[double whole note]] can be written with vertical lines surrounding it, two attached noteheads, or a rectangular notehead.&lt;ref name="Gerou"&gt;Gerou, Tom &amp; Lusk, Linda: [https://books.google.es/books?id=6PELtxxrz_QC&amp;pg=PA210 ''Essential Dictionary of Music Notation''.] Alfred Music, 1996, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; An "x" shaped notehead may be used to indicate percussion, percussive effects ([[ghost note]]s), or speaking. A square, diamond, or box shaped notehead may be used to indicate a [[harmonic|natural]] or [[artificial harmonic]].

==History==
Noteheads ultimately derive from the [[neume]]s used to notate [[Gregorian chant]]. The punctum, seen at right, is the simplest of the shapes and most clearly anticipates the modern notehead. When placed on a [[clef]], the position of a notehead indicates the relative pitch of a note. The development of different colors of noteheads, and the use of it to indicate rhythmic values, was the use of white [[mensural notation]], adopted around 1450.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Busse Berger|first=Anna Maria|title=Mensuration and Proportion Signs: Origins and Evolution|location=Oxford|publisher= Oxford University Press|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Franco of Cologne]], ancient composer and music theorist, codified a system of rhythm notation. He explained this system in his work, ''Ars Cantus Mensurabilis'', (which means “The Art of Measurable Music”) circa 1280. In this system, the relative duration of notes was indicated by the note shapes. The noteheads were rectangles, squares, or diamonds depending on the note length. This system was expanded during the [[Ars Nova]] period.

Shortly before the [[Renaissance]], scribes began to write the notes of the Franconian and Ars Nova style with open noteheads. During the Renaissance, composers added shorter note durations that used filled-in noteheads. Near the end of the 16th century, the square or diamond-shaped notes changed to the round noteheads that are used today.&lt;ref&gt;Burkholder, J.P., Grout, D.J., &amp; Palisca, C.V. (2006).

The '''Ontario Science Centre''' ({{lang-fr|Centre des sciences de l'Ontario}}) is a [[science museum]] in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada, near the [[Don Valley Parkway]] about {{convert|11|km|mi|1}} northeast of [[Downtown Toronto|downtown]] on [[Don Mills Road]] just south of [[Eglinton Avenue]] East in the former city of [[North York]]. It is built down the side of a wooded ravine formed by one branch of the [[Don River (Ontario)|Don River]] located in [[Flemingdon Park]].

==History==
Planning for the Science Centre started in 1961 during Toronto's massive expansion of the late 1950s and 1960s. In 1964, Toronto [[architect]] [[Raymond Moriyama]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtarch.com/ |title=Moriyama &amp; Teshima |publisher=Mtarch.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; was hired to design the site. The [[Brutalist architecture|Brutalist]] design, which consists of three main buildings connected by a series of [[bridge]]s and [[escalator]]s, follows the natural contours of the Don River ravine, into which the Centre descends. Construction started in 1966 with plans to make it a part of the city's 1967 [[Canadian Centennial]] celebrations. It was first officially named the "Centennial Centre of Science and Technology". However construction was not complete in 1967, and the Science Centre did not open to the public until two years later, on September 26, 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontariosciencecentre.ca/history/default.asp |title=40 Years of Innovation |publisher=Ontario Science Centre |accessdate=2010-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412162157/http://www.ontariosciencecentre.ca/history/default.asp |archivedate=April 12, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, the Science Centre was a pioneer for its hands-on approach to science, along with [[San Francisco]]'s [[Exploratorium]] and [[Detroit]]'s Museum of Science and Technology. Unlike a traditional museum, where exhibits are for viewing only, the majority of the exhibits at the Science Centre were interactive, while many others were live demonstrations (e.g. metalworking). The Communications room contained a number of computerized displays, including a very popular [[tic-tac-toe]] game, run on a [[PDP-11]] minicomputer.

In 2001 the Centre embarked on a capital project called "Agents of Change", which focused on innovation and renewed about 85 per cent of the Centre’s public space, including the creation of seven new experience areas. The Centre received $47.5 million in contributions from the government of Ontario, private sector companies and individuals. The Agents of Change transformation was completed 2007, culminating with the opening of the Weston Family Innovation Centre and the Teluscape plaza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ontariosciencecentre.ca/Uploads/AboutUs/documents/2010-2011.annualreport.en.pdf |title=Crossing Boundaries 2010/2011 |publisher=Ontario Science Centre |date= |accessdate=2014-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions==
The Centre has several hundred interactive and passive exhibits, featuring [[geology]], the science of [[nature]] (in the west wing), [[astronomy|astronomical]] science, how to play [[music]] and [[technology]] in the south wing, [[human body|human anatomy]], [[communication]] and [[bias]], and some miscellaneous artifacts of science.

===FUNtain Aquatic Play===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
[[Image:Hydraulophone at Ontario Science Centre imgp4940rp.jpg|thumb|left|World's largest outdoor hydraulophone which is publicly accessible 24 hours-a-day]]
As originally built, the Science Centre had a large fountain area directly in front of the entranceway, located to create a traffic [[roundabout]]. The original water fountain has been rejuvenated to provide a more welcoming and accessible entrance to the Science Centre.  The new plaza, named "Teluscape", was designed by Reich + Petch Architects and EDA Collaborative.  It opened to the public on 20 September 2006, and is accessible at all times.

The new fountain is also a [[hydraulophone]] designed by installation artist [[Steve Mann]]. It is a hydraulic-action [[pipe organ]] which anyone walking into the space can play . Blocking the flow of any one of the 57 water jets in the fountain forces the water across to a corresponding organ pipe, where it makes a loud sound as the water is forced out through the speaking mouth of the pipe. The lowest 12 notes in each pipe division of the organ are visible as pipes arranged in a circle. The North Division consists of stopped hydrapaisons (similar to diapaisons but running on water rather than air), whereas the South Division pipes are open at both ends (sound emerges from the ends rather than from a mouth as with the North pipes).  The North organ console consists of 12 water jets, whereas the south console consists of 45 water jets.
[[Image:Hydraulophone 45jet range.svg|thumb|Playing range of the hydraulophone]]
The organ is supplied with water from three Pentair pumps, supplying water at a rate of {{convert|130|gal/min}}, each by way of a {{convert|3|in|cm}} diameter water line, as well as air from three Ingersol Rand four-cylinder air compressors, each having a {{convert|25|hp}} motor. Since the instrument runs on both air and water, it may be regarded as a hybrid hydraulophone and pneumatophone, but because it is played by blocking water jets rather than air holes, it is principally a hydraulophone.

The fountain must be shut down and drained to avoid freezing damage during the cold season. On 21 November 2007, the aquatic play facility was temporarily switched from water operation to air operation, effectively becoming perhaps one of the first pneumatic-play facilities, where visitors can frolic in a fountain of air jets. In this mode of operation, the fountain becomes a [[wind instrument]]. The hydraulophone may not be operational during the winter months.

==Science School==

'''Purine metabolism''' refers to the [[metabolic pathway]]s to synthesize and break down [[purine]]s that are present in many organisms.

==Biosynthesis==
Purines are biologically synthesized as [[nucleotide]]s and in particular as ribotides, i.e. bases attached to [[ribose 5-phosphate]]. Both [[adenine]] and [[guanine]] are derived from the nucleotide [[Inosinic acid|inosine monophosphate]] (IMP), which is the first compound in the pathway to have a completely formed purine ring system.

===IMP===
[[Image:Nucleotides syn1.png|thumb|400px|&lt;div style="border-width: 0px; border-bottom: 1px solid black; text-align: left;"&gt;'''The synthesis of IMP'''.&lt;/div&gt;The color scheme is as follows: &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue;"&gt;enzymes&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="color: rgb(219,155,36);"&gt;coenzymes&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="color: rgb(151,149,45);"&gt;substrate names&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="color: rgb(227,13,196);"&gt;metal ions&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="color: rgb(128,0,0);"&gt;inorganic molecules&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;]]

Inosine monophosphate is synthesized on a pre-existing ribose-phosphate through a complex pathway (as shown in the figure on the right). The source of the [[carbon]] and [[nitrogen]] atoms of the purine ring, 5 and 4 respectively, come from multiple sources. The amino acid [[glycine]] contributes all its carbon (2) and nitrogen (1) atoms, with additional nitrogen atoms from glutamine (2) and [[aspartic acid]] (1), and additional carbon atoms from [[formyl group]]s (2), which are transferred from the [[coenzyme]] [[tetrahydrofolate]] as [[10-formyltetrahydrofolate]], and a carbon atom from [[bicarbonate]] (1). Formyl groups build carbon-2 and carbon-8 in the purine ring system, which are the ones acting as bridges between two nitrogen atoms.

A key regulatory step is the production of 5-phospho-α-&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-ribosyl 1-pyrophosphate ([[PRPP]]) by ribose phosphate pyrophosphokinase, which is activated by [[inorganic phosphate]] and inactivated by purine ribonucleotides. It is not the committed step to purine synthesis because PRPP is also used in pyrimidine synthesis and salvage pathways.

The first committed step is the reaction of PRPP, [[glutamine]] and water to [[5'-phosphoribosylamine]] (PRA), [[glutamate]], and [[pyrophosphate]] - catalyzed by [[amidophosphoribosyltransferase]], which is activated by PRPP and inhibited by [[Adenosine monophosphate|AMP]], [[Guanosine monophosphate|GMP]] and [[Inosinic acid|IMP]].

PRPP + L-Glutamine + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → PRA + L-Glutamate + PPi

In the second step react [[Phosphoribosylamine|PRA]], [[glycine]] and ATP to create [[Glycineamide ribonucleotide|GAR]], ADP, and pyrophosphate - catalyzed by [[phosphoribosylamine—glycine ligase]] (GAR synthetase). Due to the chemical lability of PRA, which has a half-life of 38 seconds at PH 7.5 and 37&amp;nbsp;°C, researchers have suggested that the compound is channeled from amidophosphoribosyltransferase to GAR synthetase ''in vivo.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Substrate specificity of glycinamide ribonucleotide synthetase from chicken liver|date = April 5, 1996|journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry|doi = 10.1074/jbc.271.14.8192|pmid = 8626510|access-date = |volume=271 |pages=8192–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PRA + Glycine + ATP → GAR + ADP + Pi

The third is catalyzed by [[phosphoribosylglycinamide formyltransferase]].

GAR + [[10-Formyltetrahydrofolate|fTHF]] → [[Phosphoribosyl-N-formylglycineamide|fGAR]] + [[Tetrahydrofolic acid|THF]]

The fourth is catalyzed by [[phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase]].

fGAR + L-Glutamine + ATP → [[5'-Phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine|fGAM]] + L-Glutamate + ADP + Pi

The fifth is catalyzed by [[AIR synthetase (FGAM cyclase)]].

fGAM + ATP → [[5-Aminoimidazole ribotide|AIR]] + ADP + Pi + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

The sixth is catalyzed by [[phosphoribosylaminoimidazole carboxylase]].

AIR + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → [[5'-Phosphoribosyl-4-carboxy-5-aminoimidazole|CAIR]] + [[Proton|2H+]]

The seventh is catalyzed by [[phosphoribosylaminoimidazolesuccinocarboxamide synthase]].

CAIR + [[Aspartic acid|L-Aspartate]] + ATP → [[Phosphoribosylaminoimidazolesuccinocarboxamide|SAICAR]] + ADP + Pi

The eight is catalyzed by [[adenylosuccinate lyase]].

SAICAR → [[AICA ribonucleotide|AICAR]] + [[Fumaric acid|Fumarate]]

The products AICAR and fumarate move on to two different pathways. AICAR serves as the reactant for the ninth step, while fumarate is transported to the citric acid cycle which can then skip the carbon dioxide evolution steps to produce malate. The conversion of fumarate to malate is catalyzed by fumarase. In this way, fumarate connects purine synthesis to the citric acid cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/914290655|title=Biochemistry|last=H.,|first=Garrett, Reginald|publisher=|others=Grisham, Charles M.,|year=|isbn=9781305577206|edition= Sixth|location=Boston, MA|pages=666 &amp; 934|oclc=914290655}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ninth is catalyzed by [[phosphoribosylaminoimidazolecarboxamide formyltransferase]].

AICAR + fTHF → [[5-Formamidoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribotide|FAICAR]] + THF

The last step is catalyzed by [[Inosine monophosphate synthase]].

FAICAR → IMP + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

In [[eukaryote]]s the second, third, and fifth step are catalyzed by [[trifunctional purine biosynthetic protein adenosine-3]], which is encoded by the GART gene.

Both ninth and tenth step are accomplished by a single protein named Bifunctional purine biosynthesis protein PURH, encoded by the ATIC gene.

===GMP===
* [[Inosine-5′-monophosphate dehydrogenase|IMP dehydrogenase]] (IMPDH) converts [[Inosine monophosphate|IMP]] into [[Xanthosine monophosphate|XMP]]
* [[GMP synthase]] converts XMP into [[guanine monophosphate|GMP]]
* [[GMP reductase]] converts GMP back into IMP

===AMP===
* [[adenylosuccinate synthase]] converts IMP to [[adenylosuccinate]]
* [[adenylosuccinate lyase]] converts adenylosuccinate into [[Adenosine monophosphate|AMP]]
* [[AMP deaminase]] converts AMP back into IMP

==Degradation==
Purines are metabolised by several [[enzyme]]s:

===Guanine===
* A [[nuclease]] frees the [[nucleotide]]
* A [[nucleotidase]] creates [[guanosine]]
* [[Purine nucleoside phosphorylase]] converts [[guanosine]] to [[guanine]]
* [[Guanase]] converts guanine to [[xanthine]]
* [[Xanthine oxidase]] (a form of xanthine oxidoreductase) catalyzes the [[oxidation]] of xanthine to [[uric acid]]

===Adenine===
* A [[nuclease]] frees the [[nucleotide]]
** A [[nucleotidase]] creates [[adenosine]], then [[adenosine deaminase]] creates [[inosine]]
** Alternatively, [[AMP deaminase]] creates [[inosinic acid]], then a [[nucleotidase]] creates [[inosine]]
* [[Purine nucleoside phosphorylase]] acts upon inosine to create [[hypoxanthine]]
* [[Xanthine oxidase]] catalyzes the biotransformation of hypoxanthine to xanthine
* [[Xanthine oxidase]] acts upon xanthine to create [[uric acid]]

===Regulations of purine nucleotide biosynthesis===
The reactions which is the formation of 5'-phosphoribosyalamine from glutamine and PRPP catalysed by PRPP amino transferase is the site point for purine synthesis.The enzyme is an allosteric enzyme, so it can be converted from IMP, GMP and AMP in high concentration binds the enzyme to exerts inhibition while PRPP is in large amount binds to the enzyme which causes activation  So IMP, GMP and AMP are inhibitors while PRPP is an activator. Between the formation of 5'-phosphoribosyl, aminoimidazole and IMP, there is no known regulation step.

==Salvage==
Purines from turnover of cellular nucleic acids (or from food) can also be salvaged and reused in new nucleotides.

* The enzyme [[adenine phosphoribosyltransferase]] (APRT) salvages [[adenine]].

==Disorders==
When a defective gene causes gaps to appear in the metabolic recycling process for purines and pyrimidines, these chemicals are not metabolised properly, and adults or children can suffer from any one of twenty-eight hereditary disorders, possibly some more as yet unknown. Symptoms can include [[gout]], anaemia, epilepsy, delayed development, deafness, compulsive self-biting, kidney failure or stones, or loss of immunity.

Purine metabolism can have imbalances that can arise from harmful nucleotide triphosphosphates incorporating into DNA and RNA which further lead to genetic disturbances and mutations, and as a result, give rise to several types of diseases. Some of the diseases are:

1.    Severe Immunodeficiency by loss of adenosine deaminase.

2.    Hyperuricemia and Lesch-Nyhan syndrome by the loss of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase.

3.    Different types of cancer by an increase in the activities of enzymes like IMP dehydrogenase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pang|first=Bo|last2=McFaline|first2=Jose L.|last3=Burgis|first3=Nicholas E.|last4=Dong|first4=Min|last5=Taghizadeh|first5=Koli|last6=Sullivan|first6=Matthew R.|last7=Elmquist|first7=C.

==Pharmacotherapy==
Modulation of purine metabolism has pharmacotherapeutic value.

''Purine synthesis inhibitors'' inhibit the proliferation of cells, especially [[leukocytes]].  These inhibitors include [[azathioprine]], an immunosuppressant used in [[organ transplant]]ation, [[autoimmune disease]] such as [[rheumatoid arthritis]] or inflammatory bowel disease such as [[Crohn's disease]] and [[ulcerative colitis]].

[[Mycophenolate mofetil]] is an immunosuppressant drug used to prevent rejection in organ transplantation; it inhibits purine synthesis by blocking inositol monophosphate dehydrogenase.
Also [[Methotrexate]] indirectly inhibits purine synthesis by blocking the metabolism of [[folic acid]] (it is an inhibitor of the [[dihydrofolate reductase]]).

[[Allopurinol]] is a drug that inhibits the enzyme xanthine oxidoreductase and, thus, lowers the level of uric acid in the body. This may be useful in the treatment of gout, which is a disease caused by excess uric acid, forming crystals in joints.

== Description ==

Quality engineering is the discipline of engineering that creates and implements strategies for quality assurance in product development and production as well as software development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.getreskilled.com/what-is-a-quality-engineer/|title=What is a Quality Engineer - what do they do &amp; how can you become one?|date=17 February 2017|publisher=|accessdate=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Roles ==

'''Auditor''': Quality engineers may be responsible for auditing their own companies or their suppliers for compliance to international quality standards such as [[ISO9000]] and [[AS9100]]. They may also be independent auditors under an auditing body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://committee.iso.org/sites/tc176sc2/home/page/iso-9001-auditing-practices-grou.html|title=ISO 9001 Auditing Practices Group|website=committee.iso.org|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Process quality''': Quality engineers may be tasked with value stream mapping and statistical process control to determine if a process is likely to produce defective product. They may create inspection plans and criteria to ensure defective parts are detected prior to completion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.automotiveengineeringhq.com/process-quality-engineer/|title=Process Quality Engineer|website=''automotiveengineeringhq.com''|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Supplier quality''': Quality engineers may be responsible for auditing suppliers or performing root cause and corrective action at their facility or overseeing such activity to prevent the delivery of defective product.

== Software ==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
IT services are increasingly interlinked in workflows across platform boundaries, device and organisational boundaries, for example in cyber-physical systems, business-to-business workflows or when using cloud services. In such contexts, quality engineering facilitates the necessary all-embracing consideration of quality attributes.

In such contexts an "end-to-end" view of quality from management to operation is vital. Quality engineering integrates methods and tools from [[enterprise architecture]]-management, [[Software product management]], [[IT service management]], [[software engineering]] and [[systems engineering]], and from [[software quality management]] and [[information security management]]. This means that quality engineering goes beyond the classic disciplines of software engineering, information security management or software product management since it integrates management issues (such as business and IT strategy, risk management, business process views, knowledge and information management, operative performance management), design considerations (including the [[software development process]], [[requirements analysis]], [[software testing]]) and operative considerations (such as configuration, monitoring, [[IT service management]]). In many of the fields where it is used, quality engineering is closely linked to compliance with legal and business requirements, contractual obligations and standards. As far as quality attributes are concerned, reliability, security and safety of IT services play a predominant role.

In quality engineering, quality objectives are implemented in a collaborative process. This process requires the interaction of largely independent actors whose knowledge is based on different sources of information.

[[File:Quality Engineering.jpg|thumb|center|upright=2.0|Quality engineering]]

== Quality objectives ==

[[Quality objectives]] describe basic requirements for [[software quality]]. In quality engineering they often address the quality attributes of availability, security, safety, reliability and performance. With the help of quality models like ISO/IEC 25000 and methods like the [[GQM|Goal Question Metric]] approach it is possible to attribute metrics to quality objectives. This allows measuring the degree of attainment of quality objectives. This is a key component of the quality engineering process and, at the same time, is a prerequisite for its continuous monitoring and control. To ensure effective and efficient measuring of quality objectives the integration of core numbers, which were identified manually (e.g. by expert estimates or reviews), and automatically identified metrics (e.g. by statistical analysis of source codes or automated regression tests) as a basis for decision-making is favourable.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web | journal=Proceedings of the 32nd ACM/IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering |author1=Michael Kläs |author2=Frank Elberzhager |author3=Jürgen Münch |author4=Klaus Hartjes |author5=Olaf von Graevemeyer | title=Transparent combination of expert and measurement data for defect prediction: an industrial case study | accessdate=8 April 2014 | date=2–8 May 2010 | publisher=ACM New York, USA | volume=2 | url=http://www.klaes.org/Z-files/Klaes-2010-ICSE-Paper.pdf | pages=119–128 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Actors ==

The end-to-end quality management approach to quality engineering requires numerous actors with different responsibilities and tasks, different expertise and involvement in the organisation.

Different roles involved in quality engineering:
* Business architect, 
* IT architect, 
* Security officer, 
* Requirements engineer, 
* Software quality manager,
* Test manager,
* Project manager,
* Product manager and 
* Security architect.

Typically, these roles are distributed over geographic and organisational boundaries. Therefore, appropriate measures need to be taken to coordinate the heterogeneous tasks of the various roles in quality engineering and to consolidate and synchronize the data and information necessary in fulfilling the tasks, and to make them available to each actor in an appropriate form.

== Knowledge management ==

[[Knowledge management]] plays an important part in quality engineering.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web | journal=IEEE Software |author1=Jacek Czerwonka |author2=Nachiappan Nagappan |author3=Wolfram Schulte |author4=Brendan Murphy | title=CODEMINE: Building a Software Development Data Analytics Platform at Microsoft | accessdate=7 April 2014 | date=July–August 2013 | publisher=IEEE Computer Society | volume=30 | number=4 | url=http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/200717/CodeMine.pdf | pages=64–71 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The quality engineering knowledge base comprises manifold structured and unstructured data, ranging from code repositories via requirements specifications, standards, test reports, enterprise architecture models to system configurations and runtime logs. Software and system models play an important role in mapping this knowledge. The data of the quality engineering knowledge base are generated, processed and made available both manually as well as tool-based in a geographically, organisationally and technically distributed context. Of prime importance is the focus on [[quality assurance]] tasks, early recognition of risks, and appropriate support for the collaboration of actors.

This results in the following requirements for a quality engineering knowledge base:

* Knowledge is available in a quality as required. Important quality criteria include that knowledge is consistent and up-to-date as well as complete and adequate in terms of granularity in relation to the tasks of the appropriate actors.
* Knowledge is interconnected and traceable in order to support interaction between the actors and to facilitate analysis of data. Such traceability relates not only to interconnectedness of data across different levels of abstraction (e.g. connection of requirements with the services realizing them) but also to their traceability over time periods, which is only possible if appropriate versioning concepts exist. Data can be interconnected both manually as well as (semi-) automatically.
* Information has to be available in a form that is consistent with the [[domain knowledge]] of the appropriate actors. Therefore, the knowledge base has to provide adequate mechanisms for information transformation (e.g. aggregation) and visualization. The [[RACI matrix|RACI]] concept is an example of an appropriate model for assigning actors to information in a quality engineering knowledge base.
* In contexts, where actors from different organisations or levels interact with each other, the quality engineering knowledge base has to provide mechanisms for ensuring confidentiality and integrity.
* Quality engineering knowledge bases offer a whole range of possibilities for analysis and finding information in order to support quality control tasks of actors.

== Collaborative processes ==

The quality engineering process comprises all tasks carried out manually and in a (semi-)automated way to identify, fulfil and measure any quality features in a chosen context. The process is a highly collaborative one in the sense that it requires interaction of actors, widely acting independently from each other.

The quality engineering process has to integrate any existing sub-processes that may comprise highly structured processes such as [[IT service management]] and processes with limited structure such as [[agile software development]]. Another important aspect is change-driven procedure, where change events, such as changed requirements are dealt with in the local context of information and actors affected by such change. A pre-requisite for this is methods and tools, which support change propagation and change handling.

The objective of an efficient quality engineering process is the coordination of automated and manual [[quality assurance]] tasks. Code review or elicitation of quality objectives are examples of manual tasks, while regression tests and the collection of code metrics are examples for automatically performed tasks. The quality engineering process (or its sub-processes) can be supported by tools such as ticketing systems or security management tools.

'''The resource fragmentation hypothesis''' was first proposed by Janzen &amp; Pond (1975), and says that as [[species]] richness becomes large there is not a linear increase in the number of [[parasitoid]] species that can be supported.  The mechanism for this [[hyperbolic function|hyperbolic]] relationship is suggested to be that each of the new host species are too rare to support the evolution of specialist parasitoids (Janzen &amp; Pond, 1975).  The resource fragmentation hypothesis is one of two hypotheses that seek to explain the distribution of the [[Ichneumonidae]].

In a [[computer system]] or [[computer network|network]], a '''runbook''' is a compilation of routine procedures and operations that the system administrator or operator carries out. [[System administrator]]s in [[Information technology|IT]] departments and [[Network Operations Center|NOCs]] use runbooks as a reference. Runbooks can be in either electronic or in physical book form. Typically, a runbook contains procedures to begin, stop, supervise, and debug the system. It may also describe procedures for handling special requests and contingencies. An effective runbook allows other operators, with prerequisite expertise, to effectively manage and troubleshoot a system. Through runbook automation, these processes can be carried out using software tools in a predetermined manner.

==Runbook applied to operations==
Operational runbooks may be tied to IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) incidents to allow repeatable processes supporting specific aspects of the [[service catalog]].&lt;ref name=AllView&gt;{{cite web|last=Krapohl|first=Don|title=An Integrated Approach to Organizational Transformation|url=http://www.augmentedintel.com/wordpress/index.php/integrated-approach-to-organizational-transformation/|work=AugmentedIntel|publisher=Don Krapohl|accessdate=1 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The runbook is typically divided into routine automated processes and routine manual processes.  The runbook catalog begins with an index of processes covered and may be broken down in [[outline (list)|outline]] form to align the processes to the major elements they support in the service catalog. A runbook is a compilation of routine procedures and operations that the system administrator or operator carries out.

==Runbook automation==

'''Runbook automation''' ('''RBA''') is the ability to define, build, orchestrate, manage, and report on [[workflow]]s that support system and network operational processes. A runbook workflow can potentially interact with all types of infrastructure elements, such as [[application software|applications]], [[database]]s, and hardware.

According to [[Gartner]], the growth of RBA has coincided with the need for IT operations executives to enhance IT operations efficiency measures—including reducing [[mean time to repair]] (MTTR), increasing [[mean time between failures]] (MTBF), and automating the provisioning of [[information technology|IT]] resources. In addition, it is necessary to have the mechanisms to implement best practices (for example, implement and manage IT operations processes in line with the ITIL, increase the effectiveness of IT personnel (for example, automate repetitive tasks associated with IT operations processes), and have the tools to report on how well the processes are executed in line with established policies and service levels.

[[File:Chuetsu earthquake-earthquake liquefaction1.jpg|thumb|Liquefaction allowed this sewer to float upward – [[2004 Chūetsu earthquake]]]] 
[[File:Liquefaction in Peterborough St.JPG|thumb|Liquefaction in Christchurch, New Zealand, during the [[2011 Christchurch earthquake|2011 earthquake]] resulted in a layer of fine sand on the street.]]

'''Soil liquefaction''' occurs when a saturated or partially saturated [[soil]] substantially loses [[Shear strength (soil)|strength]] and [[stiffness]] in response to an applied [[Shear stress|stress]] such as shaking during an [[earthquake]] or other sudden change in stress condition, in which material that is ordinarily a solid behaves like a liquid.

In [[soil mechanics]], the term "liquefied" was first used by [[Allen Hazen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hazen|first=A.|journal=Transactions of the American Society of Civil Engineers|year=1920|volume=83|pages=1717–1745}}&lt;/ref&gt; in reference to the 1918 failure of the [[Calaveras Dam]] in California. He described the mechanism of flow liquefaction of the [[Embankment dam|embankment]] dam as:

{{quote|If the pressure of the water in the pores is great enough to carry all the load, it will have the effect of holding the particles apart and of producing a condition that is practically equivalent to that of [[quicksand]]… the initial movement of some part of the material might result in accumulating pressure, first on one point, and then on another, successively, as the early points of concentration were liquefied.}}

The phenomenon is most often observed in saturated, loose (low [[density]] or uncompacted), sandy soils. This is because a loose [[sand]] has a tendency to [[Compressibility|compress]] when a [[force|load]] is applied. Dense sands by contrast tend to expand in volume or '[[Reynolds' dilatancy|dilate]]'. If the soil is saturated by water, a condition that often exists when the soil is below the [[water table]] or [[sea level]], then water fills the gaps between soil grains ('pore spaces'). In response to soil compressing, the water [[pore water pressure|pressure]] increases and the water attempts to flow out from the soil to zones of low pressure (usually upward towards the ground surface). However, if the [[force|loading]] is rapidly applied and large enough, or is repeated many times (e.g. earthquake shaking, storm wave loading) such that the water does not flow out before the next cycle of [[force|load]] is applied, the water pressures may build to the extent that it exceeds the force ([[Contact mechanics|contact stresses]]) between the grains of soil that keep them in contact. These contacts between grains are the means by which the weight from buildings and overlying soil layers is transferred from the ground surface to layers of soil or rock at greater depths. This loss of soil structure causes it to lose its [[Shear strength|strength]] (the ability to transfer [[shear stress]]), and it may be observed to flow like a liquid (hence 'liquefaction').

Although the effects of liquefaction have been long understood, [[engineer]]s took more notice after the [[1964 Niigata earthquake]] and [[1964 Alaska earthquake]]. It was a major factor in the destruction in [[San Francisco]]'s [[Marina District, San Francisco|Marina District]] during the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake]], and in [[Port of Kobe]] during the [[Great Hanshin earthquake|1995 Great Hanshin earthquake]]. More recently liquefaction was largely responsible for extensive damage to residential properties in the eastern suburbs and satellite townships of [[Christchurch]], New Zealand during the [[2010 Canterbury earthquake]]&lt;ref name="TVNZ_3772887"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/geologists-arrive-study-liquefaction-3772887 |title=Geologists arrive to study liquefaction |date=10 September 2010 |work=[[One News (New Zealand)|One News]] |accessdate=12 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012121452/http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/geologists-arrive-study-liquefaction-3772887 |archivedate=12 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and more extensively again following the Christchurch earthquakes that followed in [[2011 Christchurch earthquake|early]] and [[June 2011 Christchurch earthquake|mid-2011]].&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10710770"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10710770 |title=Christchurch areas to be abandoned |date=7 March 2011 |agency=[[NZPA]] |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28th September 2018, an earthquake of 7.5 magnitude hit the Central Sulawesi province of Indonesia.

==Technical definitions==
Soil liquefaction occurs when the [[effective stress]] (shear strength) of soil is reduced to essentially zero. This may be initiated by either monotonic loading (i.e. a single, sudden occurrence of a change in stress – examples include an increase in load on an embankment or sudden loss of toe support) or cyclic loading (i.e. repeated changes in stress condition – examples include [[wave loading]] or [[earthquake]] shaking). In both cases a soil in a saturated loose state, and one which may generate significant pore water pressure on a change in load are the most likely to liquefy. This is because loose soil has the tendency to compress when sheared, generating large excess [[porewater pressure]] as load is transferred from the soil skeleton to adjacent pore water during undrained loading. As pore water pressure rises, a progressive loss of strength of the soil occurs as [[effective stress]] is reduced.
Liquefaction is more likely to occur in sandy or non-plastic silty soils, but may in rare cases occur in gravels and clays (see [[quick clay]]).

A 'flow failure' may initiate if the strength of the soil is reduced below the stresses required to maintain the equilibrium of a slope or footing of a structure. This can occur due to monotonic loading or cyclic loading, and can be sudden and catastrophic. A historical example is the [[Aberfan disaster]]. Casagrande&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Casagrande|first=Arthur|title=Liquefaction and cyclic deformation of sands: A critical review|journal=Harvard Soil Mechanics Series No. 88|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; referred to this type of phenomena as 'flow liquefaction' although a state of zero effective stress is not required for this to occur.

'Cyclic liquefaction' is the state of soil when large shear strains have accumulated in response to cyclic loading. A typical reference strain for the approximate occurrence of zero effective stress is 5% double amplitude shear strain. This is a soil test-based definition, usually performed via cyclic triaxial, cyclic direct simple shear, or cyclic torsional shear type apparatus. These tests are performed to determine a soil's resistance to liquefaction by observing the number of cycles of loading at a particular shear stress amplitude required to induce 'fails'. Failure here is defined by the aforementioned shear strain criteria.

The term 'cyclic mobility' refers to the mechanism of progressive reduction of effective stress due to cyclic loading. This may occur in all soil types including dense soils. However, on reaching a state of zero effective stress such soils immediately dilate and regain strength. Thus, shear strains are significantly less than a true state of soil liquefaction.

==Occurrence==
Liquefaction is more likely to occur in loose to moderately saturated granular soils with poor [[drainage]], such as silty [[sand]]s or sands and [[gravel]]s containing impermeable [[sediment]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Mike |last1=Jefferies |first2=Ken |last2=Been |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2015 |title=Soil Liquefaction: A Critical State Approach 2nd ed |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=atiYCgAAQBAJ}}|isbn=9781482213683}}{{page needed|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=297–313 |doi=10.1061/(ASCE)1090-0241(2001)127:10(817) |title=Liquefaction Resistance of Soils: Summary Report from the 1996 NCEER and 1998 NCEER∕NSF Workshops on Evaluation of Liquefaction Resistance of Soils |year=2001 |last1=Youd |first1=T.

Deposits most susceptible to liquefaction are young ([[Holocene]]-age, deposited within the last 10,000 years) sands and [[silt]]s of similar grain size (well-sorted), in beds at least [[metre]]s thick, and saturated with water. Such deposits are often found along [[stream bed]]s, [[beach]]es, [[dune]]s, and areas where windblown silt ([[loess]]) and sand have accumulated. Examples of soil liquefaction include [[quicksand]], [[quick clay]], [[turbidity current]]s and earthquake-induced liquefaction.

Depending on the initial [[void ratio]], the soil material can respond to loading either strain-softening or strain-hardening. Strain-softened soils, e.g. loose sands, can be triggered to collapse, either monotonically or cyclically, if the static shear stress is greater than the ultimate or steady-state shear strength of the soil. In this case ''flow liquefaction'' occurs, where the soil deforms at a low constant residual shear stress. If the soil strain-hardens, e.g. moderately dense to dense sand, flow liquefaction will generally not occur. However, cyclic softening can occur due to cyclic undrained loading, e.g. earthquake loading. Deformation during cyclic loading depends on the [[density]] of the soil, the magnitude and duration of the cyclic loading, and amount of shear stress reversal. If stress reversal occurs, the effective shear stress could reach zero, allowing cyclic liquefaction to take place. If stress reversal does not occur, zero effective stress cannot occur, and cyclic mobility takes place.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, P.K., and Fear, C.E. (1995). "Liquefaction of sands and its evaluation.", ''Proceedings of the 1st International Conference on Earthquake Geotechnical Engineering'', Tokyo&lt;/ref&gt;

The resistance of the cohesionless soil to liquefaction will depend on the density of the soil, confining stresses, soil structure (fabric, age and [[Cementation (geology)|cementation]]), the magnitude and duration of the cyclic loading, and the extent to which shear stress reversal occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=442–59 |doi=10.1139/t98-017 |title=Evaluating cyclic liquefaction potential using the cone penetration test |year=1998 |last1=Robertson |first1=P K |last2=Wride |first2=CE (Fear) |journal=Canadian Geotechnical Journal |volume=35 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Earthquake liquefaction==
[[File:Christchurch quake, 2011-02-22.jpg|thumb|right|Sand boils that erupted during the [[2011 Christchurch earthquake]].]]

Pressures generated during large earthquakes can force underground water and liquefied sand to the surface. This can be observed at the surface as effects known alternatively as "[[sand boil]]s", "sand blows" or "[[sand volcano]]es". Such earthquake ground deformations can be categorized as primary deformation if located on or close to the ruptured fault, or distributed deformation if located at considerable distance from the ruptured fault.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kolawole|first=F|last2=Atekwana|first2=E A|last3=Laó-Dávila|first3=D A|last4=Abdelsalam|first4=M G|last5=Chindandali|first5=P R|last6=Salima|first6=J|last7=Kalindekafe|first7=L|date=2018-02-19|title=High-resolution electrical resistivity and aeromagnetic imaging reveal the causative fault of the 2009 Mw 6.0 Karonga, Malawi earthquake|url=https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggy066|journal=Geophysical Journal International|language=en|volume=213|issue=2|pages=1412–1425|doi=10.1093/gji/ggy066|issn=0956-540X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kolawole|first=Folarin|last2=Atekwana|first2=Estella A.|last3=Ismail|first3=Ahmed|date=2017-05-03|title=Near‐Surface Electrical Resistivity Investigation of Coseismic Liquefaction‐Induced Ground Deformation Associated with the 2016Mw 5.8 Pawnee, Oklahoma, Earthquake|url=https://doi.org/10.1785/0220170004|journal=Seismological Research Letters|language=en|volume=88|issue=4|pages=1017–1023|doi=10.1785/0220170004|issn=0895-0695}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SFBALiqufactionMap.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A liquefaction susceptibility map – excerpt of [[USGS]] map for the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. Many areas of concern in this region are also densely [[Urbanization|urbanized]].]]
The other common observation is land instability – cracking and movement of the ground down slope or towards unsupported margins of rivers, streams, or the coast. The failure of ground in this manner is called 'lateral spreading', and may occur on very shallow slopes with angles only 1 or 2 degrees from the horizontal.

One positive aspect of soil liquefaction is the tendency for the effects of earthquake shaking to be significantly [[Damping|damped]] (reduced) for the remainder of the earthquake. This is because liquids do not support a [[shear stress]] and so once the soil liquefies due to shaking, subsequent earthquake shaking (transferred through ground by [[shear waves]]) is not transferred to buildings at the ground surface.

Studies of liquefaction features left by prehistoric earthquakes, called [[paleoliquefaction]] or [[paleoseismology]], can reveal information about earthquakes that occurred before records were kept or accurate measurements could be taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/research/hazmaps/whats_new/workshops/CEUS-WORKSHP/Tuesday/NE-Tuttle.2.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227162207/http://earthquake.usgs.gov/research/hazmaps/whats_new/workshops/CEUS-WORKSHP/Tuesday/NE-Tuttle.2.pdf |archivedate=2009-02-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soil liquefaction induced by earthquake shaking is a major contributor to [[urban seismic risk]].

==Effects==
[[File:25 Feb 2011 River Road.jpg|thumb|upright|The effects of lateral spreading (River Road in Christchurch following the [[2011 Christchurch earthquake]])]]
[[File:Earthquake damage, Lower Styx Road, Brooklands 2.jpg|thumb|right|Damage in [[Brooklands, Canterbury|Brooklands]] from the [[2010 Canterbury earthquake]], where [[buoyancy]] caused by soil liquefaction pushed up an underground service including this manhole]]
The effects of soil liquefaction on the built environment can be extremely damaging. Buildings whose foundations bear directly on sand which liquefies will experience a sudden loss of support, which will result in drastic and irregular settlement of the building causing structural damage, including cracking of foundations and damage to the building structure, or leaving the structure unserviceable, even without structural damage. Where a thin crust of non-liquefied soil exists between building foundation and liquefied soil, a 'punching shear' type foundation failure may occur. Irregular settlement may break underground utility lines. The upward pressure applied by the movement of liquefied soil through the crust layer can crack weak foundation slabs and enter buildings through service ducts, and may allow water to damage building contents and electrical services.

Bridges and large buildings constructed on [[pile foundation]]s may lose support from the adjacent soil and [[Buckling|buckle]], or come to rest at a tilt.

Sloping ground and ground next to rivers and lakes may slide on a liquefied soil layer (termed 'lateral spreading'),&lt;ref name=chch&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipenz.org.nz/ipenz/forms/pdfs/ChChFactSheets-Liquefaction.pdf |title=IPE NV Liquefaction fact sheeet

Buried tanks and manholes may float in the liquefied soil due to [[buoyancy]].&lt;ref name=chch /&gt; Earth embankments such as flood [[levee]]s and [[earth dam]]s may lose stability or collapse if the material comprising the embankment or its foundation liquefies.

Over geological time, liquefaction of soil material due to earthquakes could provide a dense parent material in which the [[fragipan]] may develop through pedogenesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Segregated ice and liquefaction effects on compaction of fragipans |author= Scalenghe, R., Certini, G., Corti G., Zanini E., Ugolini, F.C. |year= 2004 |doi= 10.2136/sssaj2004.2040 |journal= Soil Science Society of America Journal |volume= 68 |pages= 204–214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mitigation methods==
{{Main|Dynamic compaction}}
Mitigation methods have been devised by [[Earthquake Engineering|earthquake engineers]] and include various [[soil compaction]] techniques such as vibro compaction (compaction of the soil by depth vibrators), [[dynamic compaction]], and [[vibro stone column]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.betterground.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=172&amp;Itemid=179|title=Liquefaction Mitigation|website=betterground|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905113627/http://www.betterground.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=172&amp;Itemid=179 |archive-date=2011-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These methods densify soil and enable buildings to avoid soil liquefaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=R. |last1=Lukas |first2= B. |last2=Moore |url=http://cbsink.lfchosting.com/brandenburg/dynamic/images/Dynamic%20Compaction%20Article_06.03.2005.pdf |title=Dynamic Compaction |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813064553/http://cbsink.lfchosting.com/brandenburg/dynamic/images/Dynamic%20Compaction%20Article_06.03.2005.pdf |archive-date=2011-08-13 }}''&lt;/ref&gt;

Existing buildings can be mitigated by injecting grout into the soil to stabilize the layer of soil that is subject to liquefaction.

==Quicksand==
{{Main|Quicksand}}
[[Quicksand]] forms when water saturates an area of loose sand and the sand is agitated. When the water trapped in the batch of sand cannot escape, it creates liquefied soil that can no longer resist force. Quicksand can be formed by standing or (upwards) flowing underground water (as from an underground spring), or by earthquakes. In the case of flowing underground water, the force of the water flow opposes the force of gravity, causing the granules of sand to be more buoyant. In the case of earthquakes, the shaking force can increase the pressure of shallow groundwater, liquefying sand and silt deposits. In both cases, the liquefied surface loses strength, causing buildings or other objects on that surface to sink or fall over.

The saturated sediment may appear quite solid until a change in pressure or a shock initiates the liquefaction, causing the sand to form a suspension with each grain surrounded by a thin film of water. This cushioning gives quicksand, and other liquefied sediments, a spongy, fluidlike texture. Objects in the liquefied sand sink to the level at which the weight of the object is equal to the weight of the displaced sand/water mix and the object ''floats'' due to its [[buoyancy]].

==Quick clay==
{{Main|Quick clay}}
[[Quick clay]], known as ''Leda Clay'' in [[Canada]], is a water-saturated [[gel]], which in its solid form resembles highly sensitive [[clay]]. This clay has a tendency to change from a relatively stiff condition to a liquid mass when it is disturbed. This gradual change in appearance from solid to liquid is a process known as spontaneous liquefaction. The clay retains a solid structure despite its high water content (up to 80% by volume), because [[surface tension]] holds water-coated flakes of clay together. When the structure is broken by a shock or sufficient shear, it enters a fluid state.

Quick clay is found only in northern countries such as [[Russia]], [[Canada]], [[Alaska]] in the U.S., [[Norway]], [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]], which were glaciated during the [[Pleistocene epoch]].

Quick clay has been the underlying cause of many deadly [[landslides]]. In Canada alone, it has been associated with more than 250 mapped landslides. Some of these are ancient, and may have been triggered by earthquakes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geoscape.nrcan.gc.ca/ottawa/landslides_e.php "Geoscape Ottawa-Gatineau Landslides"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051024191116/http://geoscape.nrcan.gc.ca/ottawa/landslides_e.php |date=2005-10-24 }}, Natural Resources Canada&lt;/ref&gt;

==Turbidity currents==
{{Main|Turbidity current}}
Submarine landslides are [[turbidity current]]s and consist of water saturated sediments flowing downslope. An example occurred during the [[1929 Grand Banks earthquake]] that struck the [[continental slope]] off the coast of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]. Minutes later, [[transatlantic telephone cable]]s began breaking sequentially, farther and farther downslope, away from the [[epicenter]]. Twelve cables were snapped in a total of 28 places. Exact times and locations were recorded for each break. Investigators suggested that a 60-mile-per-hour (100&amp;nbsp;km/h) submarine landslide or turbidity current of water saturated sediments swept 400 miles (600&amp;nbsp;km) down the [[continental slope]] from the earthquake’s epicenter, snapping the cables as it passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=849–73 |doi=10.2475/ajs.250.12.849 |title=Turbidity currents and submarine slumps, and the 1929 Grand Banks [Newfoundland] earthquake |year=1952 |last1=Heezen |first1=B.

[[File:The_Making_of_the_English_Landscape_Hoskins_Penguin.jpg|thumb|upright|From 1970 onwards, [[Penguin Books]] released versions of ''The Making of the English Landscape'' in numerous reprints, alongside hardback editions from [[Hodder and Stoughton]] and other publishers.&lt;ref name="WorldCatPenguin"/&gt;]]

'''''The Making of the English Landscape''''' is a 1955 book by the English local historian [[William George Hoskins]]. It is illustrated with 82 monochrome plates, mostly photographs by Hoskins himself, and 17 maps or plans. It has appeared in at least 35 editions and reprints in English and other languages.

The book is a [[landscape history]] of England and a seminal text in that discipline and in [[local history]]. The brief history of some one thousand years is widely used in local and [[environmental history]] courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.history.ac.uk/makinghistory/resources/articles/environmental_history.html | title=Making History: British environmental history | publisher=History.ac.uk | year=2008 | accessdate=26 May 2014 | author=Cooper, Timothy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoskins defines the theme of the book in the first chapter, arguing that a landscape historian needs to use [[botany]], [[physical geography]] and [[natural history]] as well as [[history|historical]] knowledge to interpret any given scene fully. The remaining chapters describe how the English landscape was formed from the [[Anglo-Saxon]] period onwards, starting c. 450 AD, and looking in detail at the [[middle ages|mediaeval]] landscape, the depopulation following the [[Black Death]], the [[Tudor period]] through to the splendour of the [[Georgian period]], the parliamentary [[enclosure]]s that affected much of the English midlands, the [[industrial revolution]], the development of road, canal, and railway transport networks, and finally the growth of towns from Norman times onwards. There is little mention of cities. The concluding chapter however laments the damage done to the English countryside by "the villainous requirements of the new age"&lt;ref name=Hoskins231/&gt; such as military airfields and arterial roads, describes the new England as barbaric, and invites the reader to contemplate the past.

The work has been widely admired, but also described as grandly emotive, populist, and openly anti-modernist. Writers have praised the book for helping them understand and interpret the landscape in which they lived.

The book is illustrated with 82 monochrome plates and 17 maps or plans, all uncredited except for some use of [[Ordnance Survey]] maps, and so apparently the work of Hoskins himself. These are closely integrated into the text; for example, the text in chapter 1 is accompanied by a pair of diagrams showing how a [[sunken lane|holloway]] ('hollow way') could be formed by the digging of a 'double ditch', i.e. a pair of raised earth banks either side of a ditch to mark the boundary of two estates, and supported by a photograph (Plate 13) of a sunken lane in Devon, explained by Hoskins as a boundary, from probably the seventh century, between the Saxon estates of (royal) Silverton and Exeter Abbey. The photograph shows high hedgebanks in bright sunshine, dwarfing the figure of a woman in the middle distance.

The book covers its subject in 10 chapters:

===1. The Landscape before the English Settlement===
[[File:The Malvern Hills - geograph.org.uk - 1456678.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|The [[Malvern Hills]] above the [[Severn]] plain of the English West Midlands]]

Hoskins uses the first few pages of this chapter as an introduction, beginning with praise for [[William Wordsworth]]'s ''[[A Guide through the District of the Lakes]]'' (1810), and from which he quotes a passage in which the reader is asked to envisage "an image of the tides visiting and revisiting the friths, the main sea dashing against the bolder shore".&lt;ref&gt;Hoskins, 1970. p17&lt;/ref&gt; Hoskins writes that on a desolate moor one can feel oneself imaginatively back in time to the [[Bronze Age]], but that there are now few such unaltered places left. He argues that the landscape historian "needs to be a [[botanist]], a [[physical geography|physical geographer]], and a [[naturalist]], as well as an historian"&lt;ref&gt;Hoskins, 1970. p19&lt;/ref&gt; to understand a scene in full:

{{quote|For what a many-sided pleasure there is in looking at a wide view anywhere in England, not simply as a sun-drenched whole, fading into unknown blue distances, like the view of the West Midland plain from the top of the [[Malvern Hills]], or at a pleasant rural miniature like the crumpled [[Woburn, Bedfordshire|Woburn]] ridge in homely [[Bedfordshire]]; but in recognizing every one of its details name by name, in knowing how and when each came to be there, why it is just that colour, shape, or size, and not otherwise, and in seeing how the various [[patterns in nature|patterns]] and parts fit together to make the whole scene.&lt;ref&gt;Hoskins, 1970. pp19–20&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The rest of the chapter covers [[Prehistoric Britain|Pre-Roman]], Western (i.e. [[Celts|Celtic]]) and [[Roman Britain]]. He estimates very roughly that 750,000 acres at most were in use as arable or grassland in Roman times, compared to 27 million acres in 1914.

===2. The English Settlement===
[[File:Medieval Ridge and Furrow above Wood Stanway - geograph.org.uk - 640050.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The method of ploughing the fields created a distinctive [[ridge and furrow]] pattern in [[open field system]] farming. The outlines of the [[mediaeval]] strips of cultivation, called selions, are still clearly visible in these now enclosed fields at [[Wood Stanway]], Gloucestershire.]]

Hoskins describes how England was settled with [[Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon]] people between c. 450 and 1066 AD, making the country a land of villages. Estate boundaries from this period survive in features such as sunken lanes and banks. The [[Viking Britain|Scandinavian]] conquest of much of England from the late 9th century added more villages, though many with Scandinavian placename elements such as -by ('village') may simply have been renamed Saxon settlements.

Many English villages were given their shape in this period, and almost all are described in some detail in the eleventh century [[Domesday Book]]. Hoskins identifies three major types of village: those around a green or central square, as at [[Finchingfield]] in Essex; those along a single street, like [[Henley in Arden]] in Warwickshire; and those consisting of apparently haphazardly scattered dwellings, like [[Barton, Oxfordshire|Middle Barton]] near Hoskins's home in Oxfordshire.

===3. The Colonization of Mediaeval England===

This chapter looks at the [[middle ages|mediaeval]] landscape from the [[Domesday Book]] onwards, with the section 'The Landscape in 1086'. The country had almost every village that exists today; a typical one, Hoskins writes, had a small [[watermill]] and a church without a spire.

In 'The Clearing of the Woodlands', Hoskins argues that before the 15th century England must have looked like one great forest, but most of the woods were cleared for arable or pasture in the 12th and 13th centuries. Under [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] perhaps a third of the country was royal forest.

Hoskins begins the section on 'Marsh, Fen, and Moor' with the words "There are certain sheets of the one-inch Ordnance Survey maps which one can sit down and read like a book for an hour on end, with growing pleasure and imaginative excitement".&lt;ref&gt;Hoskins, 1970. p95&lt;/ref&gt; One such section is of [[The Wash]], rich in mediaeval detail. Marshes such as those in [[Lincolnshire]], Norfolk and the [[Pevensey Levels]] were reclaimed at this time, whole communities working together, often under the [[Danelaw]].

[[File:South Middleton deserted village - geograph.org.uk - 388966.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|South Middleton, a [[deserted village]] in Northumberland]]

'Buildings in the landscape' briefly describes abbeys, churches, mills, bridges and castles built to serve the growing population, which just before the Black Death had tripled since Domesday.

===4. The Black Death and after===

Hoskins describes the [[abandoned village|abandonment of villages]] from the [[bubonic plague]] of 1348, the [[Black Death]], which killed a third to a half of the population (he states), and the subsequent new colonisation and building as the population eventually recovered. Marginal land such as the [[Breckland]] of Norfolk and Suffolk, never thickly populated, was abandoned. Many villages in counties such as [[Leicestershire]] were deserted. Villages such as Lower Ditchford in [[Gloucestershire]] can be seen today only as a ground-plan from the air.

Between 1350 and 1500, many new buildings appeared, especially churches with towers like [[Church of St Mary and All Saints, Fotheringhay|Fotheringhay]] in Northamptonshire. Some fine bridges as at [[Wadebridge]] in Cornwall are from this period.

===5. Tudor to Georgian England===
[[File:Front of Burghley House 2009.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The façade of [[Burghley House]], built between 1558 and 1587]]

Hoskins starts this chapter by observing that in 1500 in [[Tudor period|Tudor times]] there were roughly three sheep for every human being in England, perhaps 8 million sheep to two and a half million people. There were four million acres of hardwood forest, remembered now as [[Epping Forest]], the [[Forest of Arden]], [[Sherwood Forest]], the [[Forest of Dean]], [[Wychwood]] and many others. A village might be surrounded by a single enormous thousand acre field, shared amongst all the village's farmers. There were extensive heaths and wild places, largely uninhabited, with "no industrial smoke, nothing faster on the roads than a horse, no incessant noises from the sky".&lt;ref&gt;Hoskins, 1970. p139&lt;/ref&gt; The first enclosures and the flowering of rural England, country houses and parks such as the magnificent [[Burghley House]] and [[Knole]] date from this period up to [[Georgian period|Georgian times]].

===6. Parliamentary Enclosure and the Landscape===
[[File:Canterbury Orchards 1945 OS Map 171 detail.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Orchards]] around [[Canterbury, Kent]] in the 'Garden of England' on 1945 one-inch [[Ordnance Survey]] map. Some fields and orchards appear to have been enclosed directly from the woods to the west of the town in [[mediaeval]] times. The network of [[Roman road]]s to the town had been joined by a network of five railway lines.]]

In this chapter Hoskins describes the effects of enclosure on the landscape and on fields, hedgerows and trees, roads and farmhouses. He begins by quoting the rural poet [[John Clare]]: "Inclosure, thou'rt a curse upon the land, and tasteless was the wretch who thy existence plann'd".&lt;ref&gt;Hoskins, 1970. p177&lt;/ref&gt;

Parliamentary enclosures accounted for about 4.5 million acres of what had been open fields, not counting the enclosure of [[common land]] and wild 'waste'. In 1700 roughly half England's arable land was already enclosed; by the end of the enclosure process, almost all of it was. The revolution in the landscape began in about 1750, affecting about 3,000 parishes, especially in the English midlands. Between 1760 and 1800 there were 1,479 enclosure acts, covering 2.5 million acres; another 1.5 million acres were enclosed by 1844, by more than a thousand further acts. Some counties such as Kent, Essex and Devon were little affected, having largely been enclosed much earlier, often directly from forest or moorland. Many miles of new straight hedgerows were laid to mark out the newly enclosed fields of the midlands; in some areas such as [[Derbyshire]], straight limestone walls were used instead. Many straight new roads were created at the same time. Farmhouses remained in the old villages at first, but new red-brick [[Victorian era|Victorian]] ones were often built in the middle of their now enclosed land in due course.

===7. The Industrial Revolution and the Landscape===

Hoskins begins his chapter on [[Industrial revolution|industrialisation]] with the remark "England was still a peaceful agricultural country at the beginning of the seventeenth century."&lt;ref&gt;Hoskins, 1970. p211&lt;/ref&gt; He describes the early industrial landscape, water power and early mills, steam power and slums. He names transformative inventions such as Kay's [[flying shuttle]] of 1733 and Hargreaves's [[spinning jenny]] of 1767, and comments that Matthew Boulton opened his [[steam engine]] factory "in the still unravished country"&lt;ref&gt;Hoskins, 1970. p215&lt;/ref&gt; outside Birmingham in 1765. He quotes a poem by [[Anna Seward]] lamenting the ravishing of [[Coalbrookdale]], c. 1785, and one by Wordsworth from ''The Excursion''. He is critical of the industrial slums and the smoke and dirt of the [[Staffordshire Potteries]]. He emphasises the rapid growth of industrial towns like [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]], and of new towns like [[Middlesbrough]], which went from a single farm in 1830 to over 50,000 inhabitants in 1880. However he appreciates the mining landscapes of [[Cornwall]], including the gleaming white [[china clay]] pits of [[St Austell]] and the abandoned tin mines of [[St Cleer]], commenting that "there is a point, as [[Arthur Young (agriculturist)|Arthur Young]] saw, when industrial ugliness becomes [[sublime (philosophy)|sublime]]".&lt;ref&gt;Hoskins, 1970. p232&lt;/ref&gt;

===8. Roads, Canals, and Railways===
[[Image:Canal boats at Stourport Basin.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|The canal basin at [[Stourport]], the only town in England to be created by [[Canals in the United Kingdom|canals]], according to Hoskins]]

Hoskins describes roads and trackways from the Iron Age (like the [[Jurassic Way]] across the midlands, near his Oxfordshire home) and Roman times (like [[Akeman Street]] in the same area). He notes that the [[Fosse Way]] runs for miles in Gloucestershire away from any village, as the Anglo-Saxons built villages away from large roads for safety. Still in his home area, he records that "the wide green track now called Dornford Lane"&lt;ref&gt;Hoskins, 1970. p240&lt;/ref&gt; was built in the 10th century for supplies to be carted from the Anglo-Saxon kings' own estate at &lt;!--Westcott, Middle and Steeple--&gt;Barton. He goes on to describe the building of the [[Canals in the United Kingdom|canal network]] between roughly 1760 and 1825, noting that just one town was created by the canals, [[Stourport]]. Soon afterwards, a much more widespread transport network transformed the English landscape: the [[Rail transport in Great Britain|railways]]. Hoskins devotes over a page to each of two quotations from [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[Dombey and Son]]'', describing the construction in 1836 of a railway in [[Camden Town]]. He mentions, too, that Wordsworth campaigned against the railway from [[Kendal]] to [[Windermere]], bringing trains into the heart of the Lake District, and that conservatives like Wordsworth "lost all along the line".&lt;ref&gt;Hoskins, 1970. p263&lt;/ref&gt;

===9. The Landscape of Towns===
[[File:Marlborough Centre.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The main street in the former [[market town]] of [[Marlborough, Wiltshire]] is exceptionally wide, probably made, argues Hoskins, to hold the once regular sheep market.&lt;ref&gt;Hoskins, 1970. p291&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the houses were rebuilt in brick or refronted with tiles in the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=66528 | title=The Borough of Marlborough | publisher=British History Online | year=1983 | accessdate=27 May 2014 | author=Crowley, D. A. (editor)}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The last chapter of the body of the book – if Chapter 10 is considered more or less an epilogue – covers towns seen as part of the English landscape. Hoskins justifies this on the grounds that understanding [[town]]s brings pleasure. He describes in turn planned towns, the open-field town, and the [[market town]]. Towns were planned as early as Norman times, [[Abbot Baldwin]] planning [[Bury St Edmunds]] between 1066 and 1086; [[Stratford-on-Avon]] was laid out in 1196. Another burst of town planning came with the [[spa town]]s in the late 18th century, and of new industrial towns like Middlesbrough and [[Barrow-in-Furness]] in the mid 19th century. Open-field towns like [[Nottingham]], [[Leicester]], and [[Stamford, Lincolnshire|Stamford]] grew naturally in their own open fields, but were trapped by pasture rights from growing in the 19th century, giving Nottingham slums, and Leicester a problem that it just managed to solve, growing across its fields: while Stamford stopped growing entirely, becoming fossilised as what Hoskins calls a museum piece of a beautiful 17th and 18th century town.&lt;ref&gt;Hoskins, 1970. p280&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the [[market town]]s like Marlborough grew up around their often large and handsome market places, which are however of any number of shapes.

===10. The Landscape Today===
Hoskins concludes with a brief chapter, with one image, Plate 82, "The completed English landscape" showing a tall tree in a wide open field, a strip of hedges and villages just visible in the distance. The chapter laments the damage caused to parts of the English landscape, mentioning bulldozers and tractors, nuclear bombers and by-passes, and ends by celebrating again the wealth of detail within a few hundred yards of Hoskins' study window at [[Steeple Barton]].

==Reception==

===Contemporary===

The geographer [[E. G. R. Taylor]], reviewing the book for the [[Royal Geographical Society]] in 1955, wrote that Hoskins made the case for getting a strong pair of boots to learn landscape history clearly enough. Taylor compared the book to [[Dudley Stamp]]'s ''Man and the Land'', published a few months earlier in 1955, saying that Hoskins seemed to have missed it, but that given the differences in their approaches, they could be read side by side. She noted also that Hoskins did not talk about London though he covered town landscapes, and appeared unaware of [[urban geography]]. Her review ended by remarking that Hoskins "views the industrial revolution with mounting horror, and the industrialists themselves are bitterly chastised as 'completely and grotesquely insensitive. No scruples weakened their lust for money; they made their money and left their muck.'"&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; She noted however that Hoskins had happily moved to "a quiet spot in Oxfordshire where he can forget the 'barbaric England of the scientists, the military men and the politicians' and look out of his study window on to the past",&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; where, she wrote, he "draws for us a last tender and evocative picture of the 'gentle unravished English landscape.'"&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; Dr. Hoskins, she wrote, forgetting all the horrors, "reaches back through the centuries one by one and rediscovers Eden".&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=1791761 | title=The English Scene: Review | author=Taylor, E. G. R. | journal=The Geographical Journal |date=December 1955  | volume=121 | issue=4 | pages=511–513 | doi=10.2307/1791761}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern===

[[Penelope Lively]], writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'', describes the book as

{{quote|a marvellous, robust, opinionated account of the landscape as narrative, whether rural or urban, the visible record of what has gone before, once you know how to read it – or once he has told you how. You were to put on your walking boots and understand the country in which you lived. Plenty did, or tried to; I did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/nov/25/hero-wg-hoskins-penelope-lively | title=My Hero: WG Hoskins by Penelope Lively | work=The Guardian | date=25 November 2011 | accessdate=26 May 2014 | author=Lively, Penelope}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[William Boyd (writer)|William Boyd]], also in ''The Guardian'', described the book as "an absolute trailblazer, a revolution."&lt;ref name=Boyd&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/may/11/rereading-making-english-landscape | title=William Boyd: rereading The Making of the English Landscape by WG Hoskins | work=The Guardian | date=11 May 2013 | accessdate=26 May 2014 | author=Boyd, William}}&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that [[W. H. Auden]] "revered" the book, and that reading Hoskins had enabled him to 'read' a landscape as a "historical [[palimpsest]]":&lt;ref name=Boyd/&gt;

{{quote|The familiar English countryside, in whatever regional variation, became a form of historical palimpsest – its evolving history there to be decoded and discerned for those who could look at it through the innovative lens that Hoskins provided. It was as if the landscape was all of a sudden an archaeological dig – hills and dales, woods and copses, fields and rivers, villages and roads ceased to be simple features of a view. Instead the whole history of English humankind and husbandry was on display, from the Holocene age to the latest horrors of agribusiness. And the book in which that history was written was the very land itself.&lt;ref name=Boyd/&gt;}}

Local historian Graeme White, in ''The Medieval English Landscape, 1400–1540'', calls Hoskins' book "brilliantly-crafted" and observes that "Although this famously railed against the 'England of the arterial by-pass, treeless and stinking of diesel oil' – along with much else belonging to the mid-twentieth century – the fact that national car ownership more than doubled during the 1950s made this a subject whose time had come."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RmnwVXGZNC8C | title=The Medieval English Landscape, 1400–1540 | publisher=A&amp;C Black | author=White, Graeme J. | year=2012 | pages=Foreword}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]], writing in ''[[The Spectator]]'', said that the book "was for me an eye-opener, as it was for many people. It told us of the extent to which our landscape had been made by man, not God, and taught us to look much more observantly at it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/books/6050223/not-every-aspect-pleases/ | title=Not every aspect pleases | work=The Spectator | date=2 June 2010 | accessdate=27 May 2014 | author=Johnson, Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matthew H. Johnson, writing a chapter on English culture and landscape in the edited book ''The Public Value of the Humanities'', identifies "six key points" established by Hoskins:&lt;ref name=Johnson&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.bloomsburycollections.com/book/the-public-value-of-the-humanities/ch9-making-a-home | title=Chapter 9.

:1. The landscape is of great antiquity ("everything is much older than we think"&lt;ref&gt;Hoskins, 1955. p 12&lt;/ref&gt;)&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt;

:2. Landscapes often changed suddenly, as in the 18th century enclosures.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt;

:3. Hoskins, following [[O. G. S. Crawford]]'s 1953 ''Archaeology in the Field'', stressed we had to read the landscape using research to reveal its cultural value.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt;

:4. Hoskins thus told a "grand and emotive story about that landscape."&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt; Johnson compares this to [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s account in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' when the [[hobbit]]s return to a "despoiled and industrialized landscape of [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]]".&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt;

:5. The narrative is [[populism|populist]], to be disseminated "to anyone who would listen."&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt; The result was that it became part of English post-war culture.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt;

:6. It was "openly anti-[[modernist]]". In evidence, Johnson cites Hoskins's "most famous passage" from the concluding chapter:&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt;

:{{quote|What else has happened in the immemorial landscape of the English countryside? Airfields have flayed it bare … Poor devastated Lincolnshire and Suffolk! And those long gentle lines of the dip-slope of the Cotswolds, those misty uplands of the sheep-grey oolite, how they have lent themselves to the villainous requirements of the new age! Over them drones, day after day, the obscene shape of the atom-bomber, laying a trail like a filthy slug upon Constable's and Gainsborough's sky. England of the [[Nissen hut|Nissen-hut]], the "[[Prefabs in the UK|pre-fab]]", and the electric fence, of the high barbed wire around some unmentionable devilment; England of the arterial by-pass, treeless and stinking of diesel oil, murderous with lorries; England of the bombing-range wherever there was once silence … Barbaric England of the scientists, the military men, and the politicians; let us turn away and contemplate the past before all is lost to the vandals.|W.G. Hoskins, ''The Making of the English Landscape'', Chapter 10.&lt;ref name=Hoskins231&gt;Hoskins, 1955. pp231–2&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Television==
In 1972 the BBC broadcast an episode of the television programme ''[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]]'' on ''The Making of the English Landscape'' produced by Peter Jones, and featuring Hoskins as presenter.&lt;ref name="Hoskins, W.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5814">"'''Ecotourism with a Hand Lens'''" is a term coined by Dr. [[Ricardo Rozzi]]&lt;ref&gt;Rozzi, R., J. Armesto, B. Goffinet, W. Buck, F. Massardo, J. Silander, Jr., M.T.K. Arroyo, S. Russell, C.B. Anderson, L. Cavieres &amp; J.B. Callicott (2008). Changing biodiversity conservation lenses: Insights from the subantarctic non-vascular flora of southern South America. Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment 6:131-137&lt;/ref&gt; and his colleagues to refer to a new speciality tourism being promoted in the Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve. Given the discovery of the archipelago's outstanding diversity of mosses, lichens and liverworts (5% of the world's total), Rozzi has called upon tourism operators to place this narrative into their offering for the region and take advantage of this biodiversity hotspot for non-vascular flora.&lt;ref&gt;Hargrove, E., M. T. K. Arroyo, P. H. Raven, and H. Mooney. 2008. Omora Ethnobotanical Park and the UNESCO Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve. Ecology and Society 13(2): 49. [online] URL: http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol13/iss2/art49/&lt;/ref&gt;

In turn, Rozzi and the [[Omora Ethnobotanical Park]] have metaphorically called these small plant communities the '''"Miniature Forests of Cape Horn"''' to help the broader society understand the ecological role played by these tiny, but diverse, abundant and important organisms. In the Magellanic Subantarctic ecoregion, the Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve and the Chilean Antarctic Peninsula, the number of foreign
tourists has doubled in the last decade, with nature tourism being the principal attraction for visitors to the region. With the aim of preventing negative impacts of tourism activity on the biological and cultural diversity, and to contribute to sustainable tourism the Sub-Antarctic Biocultural Conservation Program at the Omora Ethnobotanical Park, in collaboration with local actors, has developed the field environmental philosophy methodological approach.&lt;ref&gt;Ricardo Rozzi, Ximena Arango, Francisca Massardo, Christopher Anderson, Kurt Heidinger, Kelli Moses. 2008. Field Environmental Philosophy and Biocultural Conservation: The Omora Ethnobotanical Park Educational Program. Environmental Ethics 30 (3): 325-336.

Field environmental philosophy  methodology integrates ecological sciences and environmental ethics through a four-step cycle consisting of: (i) interdisciplinary ecological and philosophical research; (ii) composition of metaphors and communication of simple narratives; (iii) design of field activities guided with an ecological and an ethical orientation; and (iv) implementation of in situ conservation areas. Under the perspective of field environmental philosophy we have defined ecotourism as “an invitation to have a tour or trip to share and appreciate the oikos of the diverse human and nonhuman inhabitants, their habits and habitats.” &lt;ref&gt;Rozzi, R. J.J. Armesto, J. Gutierrez, F. Massardo, G. Likens et al. 2012. Integrating Ecology and Environmental Ethics: Earth Stewardship in the Southern End of the Americas. BioScience 62(3): 226-236&lt;/ref&gt; This methodological approach is implemented with the activity of “ecotourism with a hand-lens” at Omora Park. "Ecotourism with a hand-lens” aims to demonstrate that when adequately planned and administered, ecotourism can contribute to biocultural conservation hand in hand with environmental, economic, and social sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;Galapagos and Cape Horn: Ecotourism or Greenwashing in Two Emblematic Latin American Archipelagoes?

"Tourism with a hand lens" has been likened to a nature-venerating ritual by the ethnographer [[Bron Taylor]] in his book ''[[Bron Taylor|Dark Green Religion]].''&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Bron. 2010.

A '''turboexpander''', also referred to as a '''turbo-expander''' or an '''expansion turbine''', is a centrifugal or axial-flow [[turbine]], through which a high-[[pressure]] [[gas]] is expanded to produce work that is often used to drive a [[Gas compressor|compressor]] or [[electric generator|generator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Heinz Bloch and Claire Soares|title=Turboexpanders and Process Applications|edition=|publisher=Gulf Professional Publishing|year=2001|isbn=0-88415-509-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kerry&gt;{{cite book|author=Frank G. Kerry|title=Industrial Gas Handbook:Gas Separation and Purification|edition=|publisher=CRC Press|year=2007|isbn=0-8493-9005-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Flynn&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Flynn|title=Cryogenics Engineering|edition=Second|publisher=CRC Press|year=2004|isbn=0-8247-5367-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because work is extracted from the expanding high-pressure gas, the expansion is approximated by an [[isentropic]] process (i.e., a constant-[[entropy]] process), and the low-pressure [[exhaust gas]] from the turbine is at a very low [[temperature]], −150&amp;nbsp;°C or less, depending upon the operating pressure and gas properties.  Partial liquefaction of the expanded gas is not uncommon.

Turboexpanders are very widely used as sources of [[refrigeration]] in industrial processes such as the extraction of [[ethane]] and [[Natural-gas processing|natural-gas liquids]] (NGLs) from [[natural gas]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://freepatentsonline.com/US6915662.html Demethanzer].&lt;/ref&gt; the [[liquefaction of gases]] (such as [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], [[helium]], [[argon]] and [[krypton]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzic.org.nz/ChemProcesses/production/1K.pdf BOC (NZ) publication]: use search function for keyword "expansion".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/progress05/v_e_1_shimko.pdf US Department of Energy Hydrogen Program].&lt;/ref&gt; and other low-temperature processes.

Turboexpanders currently in operation range in size from about 750 [[Watt|W]] to about 7.5 MW (1 [[Horsepower|hp]] to about 10,000&amp;nbsp;hp).

==Applications==

Although turboexpanders are very commonly used in low-temperature processes, they are used in many other applications as well. This section discusses one of the low-temperature processes, as well as some of the other applications.

===Extracting hydrocarbon liquids from natural gas===
[[Image:Demethanizer.PNG|right|thumb|340px|A schematic diagram of a demethanizer extracting hydrocarbon liquids from natural gas]]
 
Raw natural gas consists primarily of methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), the shortest and lightest [[hydrocarbon]] molecule, as well as various amounts of heavier hydrocarbon gases such as [[ethane]] (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;), [[propane]] (C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;), [[Butane|normal butane]] (''n''-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;), [[isobutane]] (''i''-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;), [[pentane]]s and even higher-[[molecular-mass]] hydrocarbons. The raw gas also contains various amounts of [[acid gas]]es such as [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[hydrogen sulfide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) and [[mercaptan]]s such as [[methanethiol]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SH) and [[ethanethiol]] (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;SH).

When processed into finished by-products (see [[Natural-gas processing]]), these heavier hydrocarbons are collectively referred to as NGL (natural-gas liquids). The extraction of the NGL often involves a turboexpander&lt;ref&gt;''Gas Processes 2002'', Hydrocarbon Processing, pages 83–84, May 2002 (schematic flow diagrams and descriptions of the NGL-Pro and NGL recovery processes).&lt;/ref&gt; and a low-temperature [[distillation column]] (called a ''demethanizer'') as shown in the figure. The inlet gas to the demethanizer is first cooled to about −51&amp;nbsp;°C in a [[heat exchanger]] (referred to as a ''cold box''), which partially [[Condensation|condenses]] the inlet gas. The resultant gas–liquid mixture is then separated into a gas stream and a liquid stream.

The liquid stream from the [[Vapor–liquid separator|gas–liquid separator]] flows through a valve and undergoes a [[Flash evaporation#Flash evaporation of a single-component liquid|''throttling expansion'']] from an absolute pressure of 62 [[Bar (unit)|bar]] to 21 bar (6.2 to 2.1 MPa), which is an [[isenthalpic]] process (i.e., a constant-enthalpy process) that results in lowering the temperature of the stream from about −51&amp;nbsp;°C to about −81&amp;nbsp;°C as the stream enters the demethanizer.

The gas stream from the gas–liquid separator enters the turboexpander, where it undergoes an [[Isentropic process|isentropic]] expansion from an absolute pressure of 62 [[Bar (unit)|bar]] to 21 bar (6.2 to 2.1 MPa) that lowers the gas stream temperature from about −51&amp;nbsp;°C to about −91&amp;nbsp;°C as it enters the demethanizer to serve as distillation [[reflux]].

Liquid from the top [[tray]] of the demethanizer (at about −90&amp;nbsp;°C) is routed through the cold box, where it is warmed to about 0&amp;nbsp;°C as it cools the inlet gas, and is then returned to the lower section of the demethanizer. Another liquid stream from the lower section of the demethanizer (at about 2&amp;nbsp;°C) is routed through the cold box and returned to the demethanizer at about 12&amp;nbsp;°C. In effect, the inlet gas provides the [[heat]] required to "reboil" the bottom of the demethanizer, and the turboexpander removes the heat required to provide reflux in the top of the demethanizer.

The overhead gas product from the demethanizer at about −90&amp;nbsp;°C is processed natural gas that is of suitable quality for distribution to end-use consumers by [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]]. It is routed through the cold box, where it is warmed as it cools the inlet gas. It is then compressed in the gas compressor driven by the turboexpander and further compressed in a second-stage gas compressor driven by an [[electric motor]] before entering the distribution pipeline.

The bottom product from the demethanizer is also warmed in the cold box, as it cools the inlet gas, before it leaves the system as NGL.

=== Power generation ===

[[Image:Expansion turbine power generation.png|right|thumb|222px|Schematic diagram of power-generation system using a turboexpander]]
The figure depicts an electric power-generation system that uses a heat source, a cooling medium (air, water or other), a circulating working fluid and a turboexpander. The system can accommodate a wide variety of heat sources such as:
* geothermal hot water,
* exhaust gas from internal combustion engines burning a variety of fuels ([[natural gas]], [[landfill gas]], [[diesel oil]], or [[fuel oil]]),
* a variety of [[waste heat]] sources (in the form of either gas or liquid).

The circulating working fluid (usually an [[Organic chemistry|organic compound]] such as R-134a) is pumped to a high pressure and then vaporized in the evaporator by [[Heat exchanger|heat exchange]] with the available heat source. The resulting high-pressure vapor flows to the turboexpander, where it undergoes an isentropic expansion and exits as a vapor–liquid mixture, which is then condensed into a liquid by heat exchange with the available cooling medium. The condensed liquid is pumped back to the evaporator to complete the cycle.

The system in the figure implements a [[Rankine cycle]] as it is used in [[fossil-fuel power plant]]s, where water is the working fluid and the heat source is derived from the [[combustion]] of natural gas, [[fuel oil]] or [[coal]] used to generate high-pressure steam. The high-pressure steam then undergoes an isentropic expansion in a conventional [[steam turbine]]. The steam turbine exhaust steam is next condensed into liquid water, which is then pumped back to steam generator to complete the cycle.

When an organic working fluid such as R-134a is used in the Rankine cycle, the cycle is sometimes referred to as an [[organic Rankine cycle]] (ORC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.akenergyauthority.org/PDF%20files/ArchiveConferenceMaterial/ORC_Waste_Heat-Holdmann.pdf ORC Technology for Waste Heat Applications]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csiro.au/science/ps4q.html The Integrated Rankine Cycle Project].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geothermie.de/gte/gte36-37/altheim_gaia.htm The Rankine Cycle Turbogenerator at Altheim, Austria].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Refrigeration system ===

[[Image:Expansion turbine+compressor refrigeration system.png|right|thumb|256px|Schematic diagram of a refrigeration system using a turboexpander, compressor and a motor]]
A refrigeration system utilizes a compressor, a turboexpander and an electric motor.

Depending on the operating conditions, the turboexpander reduces the load on the electric motor by 6–15% compared to a conventional [[vapor-compression refrigeration]] system that uses a [[Flash evaporation#Flash evaporation of a single-component liquid|''throttling expansion'']]  valve rather than a turboexpander.&lt;ref name=Brasz&gt;''Refrigeration apparatus with expansion turbine'', European patent EP 0 676 600 B1, September 6, 2000, Joost J. Brasz, Carrier Corporation [http://www.freepatentsonline.com/EP0676600.pdf EP 0 676 600 B1] (this website requires registration).&lt;/ref&gt; Basically, this can be seen as a form of [[turbo-compound engine|turbo compounding]].

The system employs a high-pressure refrigerant (i.e., one with a low [[Boiling point#Relation between the normal boiling point and the vapor pressure of liquids|normal boiling point]]) such as:&lt;ref name=Brasz/&gt;
* [[chlorodifluoromethane]] (CHClF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) known as R-22, with a normal boiling point of −47&amp;nbsp;°C;
* [[1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane]] (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) known as R-134a, with a normal boiling point of −26&amp;nbsp;°C.

As shown in the figure, refrigerant vapor is compressed to a higher pressure, resulting in a higher temperature as well. The hot, compressed vapor is then [[condensation|condensed]] into a liquid. The [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]] is where heat is expelled from the circulating refrigerant and is carried away by whatever cooling medium is used in the condenser (air, water, etc.).

The refrigerant liquid flows through the turboexpander, where it is vaporized, and the vapor undergoes an isentropic expansion, which results in a low-temperature mixture of vapor and liquid. The vapor–liquid mixture is then routed through the evaporator, where it is vaporized by heat absorbed from the space being cooled. The vaporized refrigerant flows to the compressor inlet to complete the cycle.

=== Power recovery in fluid catalytic cracker ===

[[Image:Fluid catalytic cracker power recovery.png|right|thumb|225px|A schematic diagram of the power recovery system in a fluid catalytic cracking unit]]

The [[combustion]] [[flue gas]] from the catalyst regenerator of a [[fluid catalytic cracker]] is at a temperature of about 715&amp;nbsp;°C and at a pressure of about 2.4 [[bar (unit)#Absolute pressure and gauge pressure|barg]] (240 kPa gauge). Its gaseous components are mostly [[carbon monoxide]] (CO), [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[nitrogen]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Although the flue gas has been through two stages of [[Cyclonic separation|cyclones]] (located within the regenerator) to remove entrained catalyst fines, it still contains some residual catalyst fines.

The figure depicts how power is recovered and utilized by routing the regenerator flue gas through a turboexpander. After the flue gas exits the regenerator, it is routed through a secondary catalyst separator containing ''[[swirl tubes]]'' designed to remove 70–90% of the residual catalyst fines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alex C. Hoffnab and Lewis E. Stein|title=Gas Cyclones and Swirl Tubes:Principles , Design and Operation|edition=1st|publisher=Springer|year=2002|isbn=3-540-43326-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is required to prevent erosion damage to the turboexpander.

As shown in the figure, expansion of the flue gas through a turboexpander provides sufficient power to drive the regenerator's combustion air compressor. The electrical [[motor-generator]] in the power-recovery system can consume or produce electrical power. If the expansion of the flue gas does not provide enough power to drive the air compressor, the electric motor-generator provides the needed additional power. If the flue gas expansion provides more power than needed to drive the air compressor, then the electric motor-generator converts the excess power into electric power and exports it to the refinery's electrical system.&lt;ref name=Reza&gt;{{cite book|author=Reza Sadeghbeigi|title=Fluid Catalytic Cracking Handbook|edition=2nd|publisher=Gulf Publishing|year=2000|isbn=0-88415-289-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[steam turbine]] is used to drive the regenerator's combustion air compressor during start-ups of the fluid catalytic cracker until there is sufficient combustion flue gas to take over that task.

The expanded flue gas is then routed through a steam-generating [[boiler]] (referred to as a ''[[Condensing boiler|CO boiler]]''), where the carbon monoxide in the flue gas is burned as fuel to provide steam for use in the refinery.&lt;ref name=Reza/&gt;

The flue gas from the CO boiler is processed through an [[electrostatic precipitator]] (ESP) to remove residual [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]]. The ESP removes particulates in the size range of 2 to 20 [[micrometer (unit)|micrometers]] from the flue gas.&lt;ref name=Reza/&gt;

==History==

The possible use of an expansion machine for isentropically creating low temperatures was suggested by [[Carl Wilhelm Siemens]] ([[Siemens cycle]]), a [[Germany|German]] engineer in 1857. About three decades later, in 1885,  Ernest Solvay of [[Belgium]] attempted to use a reciprocating expander machine, but could not attain any temperatures lower than −98&amp;nbsp;°C because of problems with lubrication of the machine at such temperatures.&lt;ref name=Kerry/&gt;

In 1902, [[Georges Claude]], a [[France|French]] engineer, successfully used a reciprocating expansion machine to liquefy air. He used a degreased, burnt leather packing as a piston seal without any lubrication. With an air pressure of only 40 bar (4 MPa), Claude achieved an almost isentropic expansion resulting in a lower temperature than had before been possible.&lt;ref name=Kerry/&gt;

The first turboexpanders seem to have been designed in about 1934 or 1935 by Guido Zerkowitz, an Italian engineer working for the German firm of [[Linde AG]].&lt;ref&gt;''Turbine for Low Temperature Gas Separation'', U.S. Patent 2,165,994, July 1939 (Continuation of an application in March 1934), Guido Zerkowitz, Linde AG [http://www.freepatentsonline.com/2165994.pdf United States Patent US2165994] (this website requires registration).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Almqvist&gt;{{cite book|author=Ebbe Almqvist|title=History of Industrial Gases|edition=First|publisher=Springer|year=2002|isbn=0-306-47277-5|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, the [[Russians|Russian]] physicist [[Pyotr Kapitsa]] perfected the design of centrifugal turboexpanders. His first practical prototype was made of [[Monel]] metal, had an outside diameter of only 8&amp;nbsp;cm (3.1&amp;nbsp;in), operated at 40,000 revolutions per minute and expanded 1,000 cubic metres of air per hour. It used a water pump as a brake and had an efficiency of 79–83%.&lt;ref name=Kerry/&gt;&lt;ref name=Almqvist/&gt; Most turboexpanders in industrial use since then have been based on Kapitsa's design, and centrifugal turboexpanders have taken over almost 100% of the industrial gas liquefaction and low-temperature process requirements.&lt;ref name=Kerry/&gt;&lt;ref name=Almqvist/&gt; The availability of liquid [[oxygen]] revolutionized the production of steel using the [[basic oxygen steelmaking]] process.

In 1978, Pyotr Kapitsa was awarded a Nobel physics prize for his body of work in the area of low-temperature physics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1978/kapitsa-bio.html Pyotr Kapitsa, The Nobel Prize in Physics 1978].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, San Diego Gas and Electric was among the first to install a turboexpander in a natural-gas letdown station for [[energy recovery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jacobrheuban.com/2009/03/09/turboexpanders-harnessing-the-hidden-potential-of-our-natural-gas-distribution-system/ Turboexpanders: Harnessing the Hidden Potential of Our Natural Gas Distribution System].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Turboexpanders can be classified by loading device or bearings.

Three main loading devices used in turboexpanders are [[centrifugal compressors]], electrical generators or hydraulic brakes. With centrifugal compressors and electrical generators the shaft power from the turboexpander is recouped either to recompress the process gas or to generate electrical energy, lowering utility bills.

Hydraulic brakes are used when the turboexpander is very small and harvesting the shaft power is not economically justifiable.

Bearings used are either oil bearings or [[magnetic bearing]]s.

One should also notice the new [[Quasiturbine]] technology &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quasiturbine.com/ Quasiturbine Expander: Harnessing mechanical energy from pressured gas and steam system].&lt;/ref&gt;, which is a positive displacement rotary turbine type.
