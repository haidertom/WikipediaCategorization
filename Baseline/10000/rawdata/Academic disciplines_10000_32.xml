The '''antiquities trade''' is the exchange of [[antiquities]] and [[Artifact (archaeology)|archaeological artifacts]] from around the world. This trade may be [[wikt:illicit|illicit]] or completely legal. The legal antiquities trade abide by national regulations, which now universally provides for extraction that allows for the scientific study of the artifacts in order to study the archaeological and anthropological context.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}{{clarify|date=May 2013}} The illicit antiquities trade involves non-scientific extraction that ignores the [[Archaeology|archaeological]] and [[Anthropology|anthropological]] context from the artifacts.

==Legal trade==
The legal trade in antiquities abide by the laws of the countries in which the artifacts originate. These laws establish how the antiquities may be extracted from the ground and the legal process in which artifacts may leave the country. In many countries excavations and exports were prohibited without official licenses already in the 19th century, as for example in the Ottoman Empire. According to the laws of the countries of origin, there can't be a legal trade with archaeological artifact without official papers. However, most national laws still overturn these regulations.

==Illicit trade==
{{see also|Art theft|Looted art}}
Illicit or illegal antiquities are those found in illegal or unregulated excavations, and traded covertly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://traffickingculture.org/encyclopedia/terminology/illicit-antiquities Illicit Antiquities], Trafficking Culture Encyclopedia.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[black market]] trade of illicit antiquities is supplied by [[looting]] and [[art theft]]. Artifacts are often those that have been discovered and unearthed at archeological digs and then transported internationally through a middleman to often unsuspecting collectors, museums, antique dealers, and auction houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Amineddoleh|first=Leila|date=2013-10-01|title=The Role of Museums in the Trade of Black Market Cultural Heritage Property|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2370699|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; The antiquities trade is much more careful in recent years about establishing the [[provenance]] of cultural artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archaeology.org/online/interviews/atwood.html Archaeological Institute of America]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3392057.stm BBC]&lt;/ref&gt; Some estimates put annual turnover in billions of US dollars.

It is believed by many archaeologists and cultural heritage lawyers that the demand created by circulation, marketing, and collectorship of ancient artifacts causes the continuous looting and destruction of archaeological sites around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/islamic-state-antiquities-trade-stretches-europe-united-states-1724733|title=Islamic State Antiquities Trade Stretches To Europe, United States|date=2014-11-17|work=International Business Times|access-date=2017-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite journal | last1 = Brodie | first1 = Neil | last2 = Renfrew | first2 = Colin | year = 2005 | title = Looting and the world's archaeological heritage: the inadequate response | url = http://traffickingculture.org/publications/brodie-n-and-renfrew-c-2005-looting-and-the-worlds-archaeological-heritage-the-inadequate-response-annual-review-of-anthropology-34-343-61| journal = Annual Review of Anthropology | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 343–61 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.anthro.34.081804.120551 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological artifacts are internationally protected by the [[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict]] and their circulation is prohibited by the [[UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property|UNESCO Convention (1970) on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property]].

=== Response ===
Recent trends reveal a large push to repatriate [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] illicitly extracted and traded on the international market. Such artifacts include those held by museums like the [[Getty Museum]]&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. [http://traffickingculture.org/encyclopedia/case-studies/j-paul-getty-museum-returns-to-italy-1999 J Paul Getty Museum Returns to Italy 1999], [http://traffickingculture.org/encyclopedia/case-studies/j-paul-getty-museum-returns-to-italy-2005 J Paul Getty Museum Returns to Italy (2005)], and [http://traffickingculture.org/encyclopedia/case-studies/j-paul-getty-museum-returns-to-italy-2007 J. Paul Getty Museum Returns to Italy (2007)], Trafficking Culture Encyclopedia.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. [http://traffickingculture.org/encyclopedia/case-studies/euphronios-sarpedon-krater Euphronios (Sarpedon) Krater], Trafficking Culture Encyclopedia.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to solve the phenomenon of looting, aerial surveillance - the effectiveness of which depends on the capability to perform systematic prospections - is increasingly being used.  Nevertheless, it is impractical in several countries due to military activity, political restrictions, and/or huge areas and difficult environmental settings (desert, rain forest, etc..). In these contexts, space technology could offer a suitable chance as in the case of Peru. In this country an Italian scientific mission directed by [[Nicola Masini]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-16190824|title=Protecting Peru's ancient past|last=Cabitza|first=Mattia|date=2011-12-15|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-12-28|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; since 2008 have been using very high resolution satellite data to observe and monitor the phenomeno of 'huaqueros' in some archaeological areas in Southern and Northern Peru.&lt;ref&gt;Lasaponara R., Masini N.

'''Applied linguistics''' is an interdisciplinary field of linguistics which identifies, investigates, and offers solutions to language-related real-life problems. Some of the academic fields related to applied [[linguistics]] are [[education]], [[psychology]], [[Communication studies|communication research]], [[anthropology]], and [[sociology]].

{{Linguistics}}

== Domain ==
Applied linguistics is an [[interdisciplinary|interdisciplinary field]] of linguistics. Major branches of applied linguistics include [[bilingualism]] and [[multilingualism]], [[conversation analysis]], [[contrastive linguistics]], [[Sign language#Linguistics of sign|sign linguistics]], [[language assessment]], [[literacy|literacies]], [[discourse analysis]], [[language pedagogy]], [[second language acquisition]], [[language planning]] and [[language policy|policy]], [[interlinguistics]], [[stylistics (literature)|stylistics]], [[pragmatics]], [[forensic linguistics]] and [[translation]].

== Journals ==
Major journals of the field include ''Annual Review of Applied Linguistics'', ''[[Applied Linguistics (journal)|Applied Linguistics]]'', ''Journal of Applied Linguistics'', ''International Review of Applied Linguistics'', ''International Journal of Applied Linguistics'', ''European Journal of Applied Linguistics'', ''Issues in Applied Linguistics'', ''[[Language Learning (journal)|Language Learning]]'', ''Language and Education, TESOL Quarterly'', and ''Linguistics and Education''.

== History ==
The tradition of applied linguistics established itself in part as a response to the narrowing of focus in linguistics with the advent in the late 1950s of [[generative linguistics]], and has always maintained a socially-accountable role, demonstrated by its central interest in language problems.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Davies &amp; Catherine Elder.(Eds.). 2004. Handbook of Applied Linguistics. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the field of applied linguistics started from Europe and the United States, the field rapidly flourished in the international context.

Applied linguistics first concerned itself with principles and practices on the basis of linguistics. In the early days, applied linguistics was thought as “linguistics-applied” at least from the outside of the field. In the 1960s, however, applied linguistics was expanded to include language assessment, [[language policy]], and second language acquisition. As early as the 1970s, applied linguistics became a problem-driven field rather than [[theoretical linguistics]], including the solution of language-related problems in the real world. By the 1990s, applied linguistics had broadened including critical studies and multilingualism. Research in applied linguistics was shifted to  "the theoretical and empirical investigation of real world problems in which language is a central issue."&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Brumfit. How applied linguistics is the same as any other science, "International Journal of Applied Linguistics", 7(1), 86-94.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, applied linguistics also began narrowly as the application of insights from structural linguistics—first to the teaching of English in schools and subsequently to second and foreign language teaching. The ''linguistics applied'' approach to language teaching was promulgated most strenuously by [[Leonard Bloomfield]], who developed the foundation for the [[Army Specialized Training Program]], and by Charles C. Fries, who established the English Language Institute (ELI) at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1941. In 1946, Applied linguistics became a recognized field of studies in the aforementioned university.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.linguisticsociety.org/resource/applied-linguistics|title=Applied Linguistics {{!}} Linguistic Society of America|website=www.linguisticsociety.org|access-date=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, the Research Club at Michigan established ''Language Learning: A Journal of Applied Linguistics'', the first journal to bear the term ''applied linguistics.'' In the late 1960s, applied linguistics began to establish its own identity as an interdisciplinary field of linguistics concerned with real-world language issues. The new identity was solidified by the creation of the American Association for Applied Linguistics in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Margie Berns and Paul Kei Matsuda. 2006. Applied linguistics: Overview and history. In K. Brown (Ed.), ''The Encyclopedia of language and linguistics'' (2nd ed.), 398-401.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Associations ==
The [[International Association of Applied Linguistics]] was founded in France in 1964, where it is better known as Association Internationale de Linguistique Appliquée, or AILA. AILA has affiliates in more than thirty countries, some of which are listed below.

'''Australia'''
Australian applied linguistics took as its target the applied linguistics of mother tongue teaching and teaching English to immigrants. The Australia tradition shows a strong influence of continental Europe and of the USA, rather than of Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Davies &amp; Catherine Elder.(Eds.). 2004. Handbook of Applied Linguistics. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Applied Linguistics Association of Australia (ALAA) was established at a national congress of applied linguists held in August 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.alaa.org.au/ | title = Applied Linguistics Association of Australia (home page) | date = September 2011 | publisher = Applied Linguistics Association of Australia | accessdate = 19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ALAA holds a joint annual conference in collaboration with the Association for Applied Linguistics in New Zealand (ALANZ).

'''Canada'''
The Canadian Association of Applied Linguistics / L’Association canadienne de linguistique appliquée (CAAL/ACLA), is an officially bilingual (English and French) scholarly association with approximately 200 members. They produce the ''Canadian Journal of Applied Linguistics'' and hold an annual conference.&lt;ref name="ACLA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Canadian Association of Applied Linguistics| url=http://www.aclacaal.org/|accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ireland'''
The [[Irish Association for Applied Linguistics]]/Cumann na Teangeolaíochta Feidhmí (IRAAL) was founded in 1975. They produce the journal ''Teanga'', the Irish word for 'language'.&lt;ref name="IRAAL"&gt;{{cite web|title=Irish Association for Applied Linguistics| url=http://www.iraal.ie/|accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Japan'''
In 1982, the Japan Association of Applied Linguistics (JAAL) was established in the Japan Association of College English Teachers (JACET) in order to engage in activities on a more international scale. In 1984, JAAL became an affiliate of the International Association of Applied Linguistics (AILA).[https://web.archive.org/web/20071103202550/http://www.jacet.org/about-e.html]

'''New Zealand'''
The Applied Linguistics Association of New Zealand (ALANZ) produces the journal ''New Zealand Studies in Applied Linguistics'' and has been collaborating with the Applied Linguistics Association of Australia in a combined annual conference since 2010, with the Association for Language Testing and Assessment of Australia and New Zealand (ALTAANZ) later joining the now three-way conference collaboration.&lt;ref name="ALANZ"&gt;{{cite web|title=Applied Linguistics Association of New Zealand| url=http://alanz.blogs.auckland.ac.nz/|accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

'''South Africa'''
The Southern African Applied Linguistics Association (SAALA) was founded in 1980. There are currently four publications associated with SAALA including the ''Southern African Linguistics and Applied Language Studies Journal'' (SAJALS).&lt;ref name="SAALA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Southern African Applied Linguistics Association| url=http://www.saala.org.za/|accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''United Kingdom'''
The [[British Association for Applied Linguistics]] (BAAL) was established in 1967. Its mission is "the advancement of education by fostering and promoting, by any lawful charitable means, the study of language use, language acquisition and language teaching and the fostering of interdisciplinary collaboration in this study [...]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.baal.org.uk/constitution.pdf | title = British Association for Applied Linguistics constitution | at = Paragraph 3: "Objects" | work = Public Documents  | date = September 2011  | publisher = British Association for Applied Linguistics | accessdate = 19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; BAAL hosts an annual conference, as well as many additional smaller conferences and events organised by its Special Interest Groups (SIGs). 

'''United States'''
The [[American Association for Applied Linguistics]] (AAAL) was founded in 1977. AAAL holds an annual conference, usually in March or April, in the United States or Canada.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12708">The '''Asociación Arte Concreto-Invención''' (AACI) is an Argentinian art movement that focuses on [[Concrete art|Concrete Art]]. Following [[World War II|WWII]], numerous pieces Latin American art as well as several Latin American artists used themes regarding [[Socialism]] and Reconstruction.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cvaa.com.ar/04ingles/02dossiers_en/concretos_en/04_historia_4_en.php|title=Concrete Art in Argentina. History 4|website=cvaa.com.ar|access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists from the AACI proposed, for the first time in the history of Argentina, the necessity for an art that was different from symbolic, representational, and expressionistic art. They believed that their artwork, or "inventions" could harbor social change in their current Argentinian political climate. The founders of the AACI showed similar themes throughout their artworks, such as a desire to appear with universality, objectivity, and lack any sort of representativeness.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=MARGINAL DISRUPTIONS: CONCRETE AND MADÍ ART IN ARGENTINA, 1940-1955|last=Jorgelina Pozzi-Harris|first=Ana|publisher=The University of Texas at Austin|year=2007|isbn=|location=Austin, Texas|pages=1–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formation ==
The formation of the Asociación Arte Concreto-Invención officially happened in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artandartcollection.com/en/artists/maldonado-tomas/|title=Art &amp; Art  MALDONADO Tomás|website=www.artandartcollection.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creators of this organization were primarily [[Tomás Maldonado|Tómas Maldonado]], [[Lidy Prati]], [[Alfredo Hlito]], [[Raúl Lozza]], [[Enio Iommi|Enio Lommi]], [[Manuel Espinosa|Manuel Espinoza]], and [[Juan Melé]]. The creation of the AACI happened because of a difference in artistic beliefs. Maldonado and Prati were married during this time period, despite being in the same artistic group and movement. In 1944, Maldonado, [[Rhod Rothfuss]], [[Gyula Kosice]], Lidy Prati, and [[Carmelo Arden Quin]] produced the first and only issue of the illustrated magazine ''Arturo''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/Concrete-Invention|title=Concrete Invention {{!}} art group|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-11-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appearance of ''Arturo'' was the beginning of a distinct revolutionary period in Argentinian art. The magazine expressed the founders' shared opposition of representational and symbolic art. However, from the magazine, two artistic groups emerged. [[Grupo Madí|Grupo Madi]], led by [[Arden Quin]], Kosice, and Rothfuss. And Asociación Arte Concreto-Invención led by Maldonado and Prati.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Influences ==
The first influence that happened upon the world of Latin American art regarding [[Concrete art|Concrete Art]] came from the works of [[Joaquín Torres-García|Joaquín Torres-Garcia]]. In 1936, Torres-Garcia had already referred to invention, speaking about those movements that put new art styles to use, such as Impressionism or Cubism.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cvaa.com.ar/04ingles/02dossiers_en/concretos_en/04_historia_3_en.php|title=Concrete Art in Argentina. History 3|website=cvaa.com.ar|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; From Torres-Garcia, came the entirety of the Concrete art movement. Maldonado had a noticeable impact on the AACI because of his restraints he put on the artists and artworks. His political views seemed to influence his views on artwork. Maldonado was a [[Marxism|Marxist]] who had certain utopian ambitions for the art created by the AACI in a new revolutionary societal movement in Latin America. The political views demonstrated by AACI members were often communistic and somewhat socialistic as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/a/asociacion-arte-concreto-invencion-concrete-invention-art-association|title=Asociación Arte Concreto-Invención (Concrete-Invention Art Association) – Art Term {{!}} Tate|last=Tate|work=Tate|access-date=2017-11-17|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; While simultaneously following the purist aesthetics of artists such as [[Piet Mondrian]] and [[Theo van Doesburg]]. The art group rapidly began making waves among the art world and by 1946, Prati and Maldonado had attracted the interest of one of the original practicing concrete artists in Switzerland, [[Max Bill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Argentine Abstract Art|last=Battiti|first=Florencia|publisher=Fundacion Proa|year=2002|isbn=|location=Buenos Aires|pages=68–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arturo Magazine ==
&lt;blockquote&gt;The aforementioned magazine was the first work by the members of the AACI before they were officially together as a group. The concepts “invention” and “trimmed frame” are used to portray the movement of Concrete Art.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These terms originated with the issuing of the Arturo magazine, and are perhaps the most original contributions to the Concrete Art movement. Arden Quin discussed about invention in ''Arturo’s'' first article. He rose against Expressionism, Surrealism, and any form of Realism in his works.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This is a common theme among the group and among concrete artists as a whole. Regarding the appearance of Arturo, Ana J. Pozzi-Harris writes, "In the Argentina of the early 1940s, no artist or movement held truly comparable ideas to those exposed in Arturo or in the early exhibitions of the Concrete and Madí artists. Exhibition reviews show that the most successful Argentine artists from this period worked in styles which may be categorized as classical and academic; picturesque and romantic; and expressionist."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For a description of the magazine, the cover was an engraving by Tomás Maldonado and in the inner pages were seen several pieces by this artist and by Lidy Prati as well. There also were essays and poems by Edgard Bailey, Gyula Kosice, Torres-García, [[Vicente Huidobro]] and [[Murilo Mendes]], and projects reproduced by [[Maria Helena Vieira da Silva|Vieira Da Silva]], Torres-García, [[Augusto Torres]], Kandinsky, Mondrian and Rothfuss.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; An important influence that can be seen in the magazine is from the Dutch artist Theo Van Doesburg. He formulated in “''Basis of the Concrete painting''”, in Paris, April 1930.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Van Doesburg described concrete art by stating,&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"1) Art is universal.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;2) The work of art must be conceived and entirely shaped by the spirit before its execution. It must not receive anything from the given shapes of nature, neither from sensuality, nor from sentimentality. We want to exclude lyricism, drama, symbolism, etc.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;3) The picture must be entirely built with purely plastic elements, that is to say, planes and colors. A pictorial element has no other significance but that of “itself”.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;4) The construction of the picture, as well as that of its elements, must be simple and visually controllable.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;5) The technique must be mechanical, that is to say, exact, anti-impressionist.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;6) Endeavor for absolute clearness.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;These guidelines for Concrete Art truly united all of the contributor's when creating their artworks for Arturo. Their similar beliefs led to a criticism of all art that could be interpreted, the AACI wanted to have their works be viewed with simplicity and with no forms of interpretation.

== Madí and the AACI ==
From the publication of ''Arturo'', two similar Argentinian artistic groups emerged. These aforementioned groups both believed in the artistic style of Concrete art, however, their perspectives of this type of artwork differed. The Madí’s members worked in various ways; they often distributed small posters and pamphlets in the streets of Buenos Aires. They also published the magazine ''Arte Madí Universal'' from 1947 to 1954 and organized art showings that mixed types visual art, poetry, music, and performance to create an encapsulating Concrete Art experience.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Their art emphasized materials and the reality of these materials, often changing the conventional frame for strangely shaped canvases and frames to encapsulate their works. In 1946, both groups publicly announced their separations and different agendas through their manifestos. For the AACI, Maldonado read the "Manifiesto Invencionista" (Inventionist Manifesto) in March 1946 at their first exhibition in the Salón Peuser. The Madí read their Manifiesto Madí (Madí Manifesto) altogether at the Instituto Francés de Estudios Superiores in August 1946.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Most of the art created by both groups was during the rule of the infamous Argentinian president [[Juan Perón|Juan Domingo Perón]]. Perón was a former Colonel in the Argentine army whom assumed the power of [[President of Argentina]] in February 1946. Perón's extremely authoritarian rule many called "Fascist" used means of mass propaganda, mass appeal, and outright oppressive measures to remain in control of Argentina until 1955. Scholars suggest the political climate of the Peronian era had a direct influence on both the AACI and the Madí.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-12-02|title=Juan Perón|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Juan_Per%C3%B3n&amp;oldid=813135657|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both parties attempted to use their Communist influence to combat the Perón agenda.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Selected Artworks ==
'''''Serial Composition'':''' A piece made by [[Lidy Prati]], done in 1948, and held in the Latin American Art Museum of Buenos Aires. The Dutch artist [[Piet Mondrian]] is historically found to be a crucial influence on the art of Prati and connections are often made about this piece and his works. This artwork shows a theme of systematic geometric abstraction which can be interpreted through the various red, white, and black rectangles or squares spaced equally far apart from one another in a grid format. This style of equidistant geometric shapes was often seen from various artists in the AACI.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.artnet.com/exhibitions/lidy-prati-made-1970s-art-1948-472988|title=Lidy Prati Made 1970s Art ... in 1948 {{!}} artnet News|date=2016-04-14|work=artnet News|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Coplanar Nº13'':''' An artwork made by [[Juan Melé]] in 1946 that consists of three different shapes made of wood, colored with oil paint and connected by a metal rod behind each of the shapes. The style used makes an appearance to the viewer that the geometric objects float in front of the wall behind them. Melé often experimented with various frames, backgrounds, and colors. His distinct artistic format is easily recognizable in this piece. ''Coplanar Nº13'' simultaneously shows the core values of the AACI in its universality and lacking of any symbolism or representational effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artandartcollection.com/en/artists/mele-juan/|title=Art &amp; Art  MELÉ Juan|website=www.artandartcollection.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Composition'':''' This oil on canvas painting by [[Tomás Maldonado|Tómas Maldonado]] depicts multiple colored and black lines of different width meeting near the center of the piece to form a rectangular shape. This piece was created in 1950 and is currently being held in the National Museum of Fine Arts in Argentina. Regarding the painting, author María Amalia Garcia describes, "''Composición'' is based on neo-plastic postulates that seek to exalt the white surface by way of tension generated between different elements inscribed on that support."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bellasartes.gob.ar/en/the-collection-highlights/7165|title=Composition (Composición) - Maldonado, Tomás|last=NSNC|first=grupo|website=www.bellasartes.gob.ar|access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Development of a Triangle'':''' Another oil on canvas painting by Maldonado that exhibits different sized triangles along with several intersecting black lines coming down the canvas. It is currently being held at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The piece demonstrates geometric abstraction and follows the strict regiments of any artwork that is considered to be related to the AACI.

In particular, bathos is associated with [[anticlimax (rhetoric)|anticlimax]], an abrupt transition from a lofty style or grand topic to a common or vulgar one. This may be either accidental (through artistic ineptitude) or intentional (for comic effect).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fiske|first=Robert Hartwell|title=Robert Hartwell Fiske's Dictionary of Unendurable English: A Compendium of Mistakes in Grammar, Usage, and Spelling with commentary on lexicographers and linguists|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JZqfZfIvtlsC&amp;pg=PA71|date=1 November 2011|publisher=Scribner|isbn=978-1-4516-5134-8|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abrams|first1=Meyer Howard|last2=Harpham|first2=Geoffrey Galt|title=A Glossary of Literary Terms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o9VkYJuVn9YC&amp;pg=PA24|year=2009|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-4130-3390-8|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intentional bathos appears in [[satire|satirical]] genres such as [[Burlesque (literature)|burlesque]] and [[mock epic]]. "Bathos" or "bathetic" is also used for similar effects in other branches of [[the arts]], such as musical passages marked ''[[ridicolosamente]]''. In [[film]], bathos may appear in a [[contrast cut]] intended for [[comic relief]] or be produced by an accidental [[jump cut]].
__NOTOC__
== Definition ==
=== ''The Art of Sinking in Poetry'' ===
{{main|Peri Bathous, Or the Art of Sinking in Poetry}}
As the combination of the very high with the very low, the term was introduced by [[Alexander Pope]] in his essay ''[[Peri Bathous, Or the Art of Sinking in Poetry]]'' (1727).  On the one hand, Pope's work is a [[parody]] in prose of [[Longinus (literature)|Longinus]]' ''Peri Hupsous'' (''[[On the Sublime]]''), in that he imitates Longinus's system for the purpose of ridiculing contemporary poets, but, on the other, it is a blow Pope struck in an ongoing struggle against the "dunces."

The nearest model for Pope's essay is the ''Treatise of the Sublime'' by [[Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux|Boileau]] of 1712.  Pope admired Boileau, but one of Pope's literary adversaries, [[Leonard Welsted]], had issued a "translation" of Longinus in 1726 that was merely a translation of Boileau.  Because Welsted and Pope's other foes were championing this "sublime," Pope commented upon and countered their system with his ''Peri Bathos'' in the [[Jonathan Swift|Swift]]-[[Alexander Pope|Pope]]-[[John Gay|Gay]]-[[John Arbuthnot|Arbuthnot]] ''Miscellanies.''  Whereas Boileau had offered a detailed discussion of all the ways in which poetry could ascend or be "awe-inspiring," Pope offers a lengthy schematic of the ways in which authors might "sink" in poetry, [[satire|satirizing]] the very men who were allied with [[Ambrose Philips]].  Pope and Philips had been adversaries since the publication of Pope's ''Odes,'' and the rivalry broke down along political lines. According to Pope, bathos can be most readily applicable to love making after two years of marriage which is clearly in binary opposition to the sublime but is no less political. [[Edmund Burke]] was believed to be particularly charmed by Pope's articulation of love after marriage, inspiring Burke's essay [[A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful]] (1756).

One example of Pope's style and satire shows in his description of sinking in painting.  In the commonplace Academic hierarchic ranking of pictorial [[genre]]s, [[still life]] ranked the lowest.  However, Pope describes how it might fall and, with the single word "stiffen," evokes the unnatural deadness that is a mark of failure even in this [[Hierarchy of genres|"low" genre]]:

:''Many Painters who could never hit a Nose or an Eye, have with Felicity copied a Small-Pox, or been admirable at a Toad or a Red-Herring. And seldom are we without Genius's for Still Life, which they can work up and stiffen with incredible Accuracy''. ("Peri Bathous" vi).

In chapters X and XI, Pope explains the comic use of the [[Trope (literature)|tropes]] and [[figures of speech]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=William Kurtz |last=Wimsatt |authorlink=William Kurtz Wimsatt, Jr. |year=1989 |origyear=1954 |title=The Verbal Icon: Studies in the Meaning of Poetry |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=KmrUKcU2JUoC&amp;pg=PA176 176] |publisher=[[University Press of Kentucky]] |location=Lexington, Kentucky |isbn=978-0-8131-0111-8 |oclc=19554431}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Pope's manual of bad verse offers numerous methods for writing poorly, of all these ways to "sink," the method that is most remembered now is the act of combining very serious matters with very trivial ones. The radical juxtaposition of the serious with the frivolous does two things.  First, it violates "decorum," or the fittingness of subject, and, second, it creates humor with an unexpected and improper juxtaposition.

=== Subsequent evolution ===
Since Pope's day, the term "bathos," perhaps because of confusion with "[[pathos]]," has been used for art forms, and sometimes events, where something is so ''pathetic'' as to be humorous.

When artists consciously mix the very serious with the very trivial, the effect is of [[Surreal humour]] and [[absurd humor|the absurd]].  However, when an artist is unconscious of the juxtaposition (e.g., when a film maker means for [[Robot Monster|a man in a gorilla suit with a diving helmet]] to be frightening), the result is bathos.

Arguably, some forms of [[kitsch]] (notably the replication of serious or sublime subjects in a trivial context, like tea-towels with prints of [[Titian|Titian's]] ''Last Supper'' on them or hand guns that are actually cigarette lighters){{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} express bathos in the concrete arts.

A tolerant but detached enjoyment of the aesthetic characteristics that are inherent in naive, unconscious and honest bathos is an element of the [[Camp (style)|camp sensibility]], as first analyzed by [[Susan Sontag]], in a 1964 essay [http://www.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/theory/Sontag-NotesOnCamp-1964.html "Notes on camp"].

=== 17th and 18th centuries ===
Bathos as Pope described it may be found in a grandly rising thought that punctures itself: Pope offers one "Master of a Show in Smithfield, who wrote in large Letters, over the Picture of his Elephant:
:"This is the greatest Elephant in the World, except Himself."

Several decades before Pope coined the term, [[John Dryden]] had described one of the breath-taking and magically extravagant settings for his [[Restoration spectacular]], ''[[Albion and Albanius]]'' (1684–85):
:"The cave of [[Proteus]] rises out of the sea, it consists of several arches of rock work, adorned with mother of pearl, coral, and abundance of shells of various kinds. Through the arches is seen the sea, and parts of [[Dover|Dover pier]]."

Pope himself employed this type of figure intentionally for humor in his mock-heroic ''[[Rape of the Lock]],'' where a lady would be upset at the death of a lover "or lapdog."  [[Søren Kierkegaard]], in ''The Sickness Unto Death,'' did the same thing, when he suggested that the "self" is easy to lose and that the loss of "an arm, a leg, a dog, or a wife" would be more grievous.  When intended, this is a form of satire or the literary figure of ''undercutting.''  When the context demands a lofty, serious, or grand interpretation, however, the effect is bathos.

[[Image:William Hogarth - The Bathos.png|thumb|right|Hogarth's ''The Bathos'']]

In 1764, [[William Hogarth]] published his last engraving, ''The Bathos, or the Manner of Sinking in Sublime Paintings inscribed to Dealers in Dark Pictures'', depicting [[Father Time]] lying exhausted in a scene of destruction, [[parody]]ing the fashion at that time for "[[wikt:sublime|sublime]]" works of art, and [[satire|satirising]] criticisms made of Hogarth's own works.  It may also be seen as a ''[[vanitas]]'' or ''[[memento mori]]'', foreshadowing Hogarth's death six months later.  Headed ''Tail Piece'', it was intended as the [[tailpiece]] for a bound edition of Hogarth's engravings.

== Examples ==

===Traditional===
[[Alfred Lord Tennyson]]'s [[narrative poem]] ''[[Enoch Arden]]'' ends with the following lines:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;So past the strong heroic soul away.
And when they buried him the little port
Had seldom seen a costlier funeral.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After stanzas of heightened poetic language, the poet, in three short lines, wraps up a [[pathos]]-laden story with mundane and practical details. The effect yanks the reader out of the poetic world, simultaneously offering commentary on the finality of death and the transience of heroics.

A musical representation is found in composer [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s 1923 [[Octet (Stravinsky)|Octet]] for wind instruments. The first two movements and the majority of the third movement follow traditional classical structures, albeit employing modern and innovative harmonies. The last fifteen seconds of the 25-minute work, however, abruptly and whimsically turn to popular harmony, rhythm, and style found in contemporary dance hall music.

=== Modern ===
{{quote|"Moviemakers talk about "bad laughs." That's when the audience laughs when it's not supposed to.

Contemporary examples often take the form of analogies, written to seem unintentionally funny:
* Week 310: It's Like This of [[The Style Invitational]] humor contest column in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' (14 March 1999), on humorous analogies, many exhibiting bathos, such as:

The [[Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest]] features [[purple prose]], at times exhibiting bathos:
:They had but one last remaining night together, so they embraced each other as tightly as that two-flavor entwined string cheese that is orange and yellowish-white, the orange probably being a bland Cheddar and the white . . . Mozzarella, although it could possibly be Provolone or just plain American, as it really doesn't taste distinctly dissimilar from the orange, yet they would have you believe it does by coloring it differently.

Legendary [[darts]] commentator [[Sid Waddell]] was famed for his one-liners, including this example:
:“When Alexander of Macedonia was 33, he cried salt tears because there were no more worlds to conquer..... [[Eric Bristow|Bristow]] is only 27.”

'''Dora Sakayan''' ([[classical Armenian orthography]]: {{lang|hy|Դորա Սաքայեան}} {{transl|hy|ISO|Dora Sak'ayean}}; [[Armenian orthography reform|reformed]]: {{lang|hy|Դորա Սաքայան}} {{transl|hy|ISO|Dora Sak'ayan}}; born January 24, 1931), Professor of German Studies (retired), McGill University. Specializing initially as a Germanist, today she is known for her work in various areas of [[Applied Linguistics]]. Sakayan is also noted for pioneering Armenology in Canada, and introducing the two branches of the Armenian language, [[Western Armenian]] and [[Eastern Armenian]], to the English-speaking world.

==Early life, education and career==
Sakayan was born in 1931 in Salonica, Greece, to Armenian parents who had escaped the [[Armenian Genocide]]. She grew up in a multilingual environment, with her first languages being Western Armenian and Modern Greek, and she received early exposure to German, French and Turkish. After immigrating to [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Armenia]], she received her education in Eastern Armenian and Russian. Later on, she mastered English and learned other languages.

Sakayan received her elementary education at the Armenian Gulabi Gulbenkian School in Salonica. She then attended the local German high school Deutsche Schule Saloniki. She was 11&amp;nbsp;years old when her family moved to Vienna, Austria, where she pursued her high school education at the Gymnasium for girls in the 7th District of Vienna "Oberschule für Mädchen, Wien VII."

In 1946, Sakayan’s family repatriated to [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Armenia]] where she completed her secondary education. In 1948, she was admitted to the [[Yerevan State Linguistic University|Yerevan State Pedagogical Institute of Foreign Languages]] (YSPL) where she graduated with a diploma in [[Germanic languages|Germanic linguistics]] and in [[Pedagogy]] in 1952. She was then appointed as an instructor of German at YSPL, where she taught from 1952 to 1956. Subsequently, she was invited to teach in the Department of [[Romance languages|Romance]] and [[Germanic philology|Germanic Philology]] at [[Yerevan State University]] (YSU, 1956–1958).

Sakayan began her graduate studies in Germanic philology in 1958 at the [[Moscow State University|Lomonosov Moscow State University]] (LMSU), completing them in 1961. Over the following four years, she shared her time between Moscow and Yerevan to pursue her teaching duties in Germanic Philology at YSU and complete her PhD thesis while raising her two young children. She obtained her PhD in Germanic Philology from [[Moscow Lomonosov University]] in 1965.

In 1965, Sakayan became Head of the Department of Foreign languages of YSU, a position she held for ten years. At the same time, she delivered lectures in the Department of Romance-Germanic Philology of YSU.

Sakayan immigrated to Canada in January 1975 and began to teach German at two universities: [[McGill University]], (Department of German Studies) and the [[Université de Montréal]] (Department of Études des langues anciennes et modernes). In 1977, she was offered a full-time position at McGill and left Université de Montréal. Due to her high ratings as an instructor of German at McGill, in 1978 she was offered a joint appointment with the Department of Russian and Slavic Studies where she taught for ten years. Over the years, Sakayan rose to the rank of Full Professor at McGill University.

In 1981, Sakayan began her groundbreaking work in [[Armenian studies|Armenian Studies]] at McGill. At the Centre of Continuing Education, she founded and supervised a program of credited Armenian courses anchored in the Department of Russian and Slavic Studies. She edited and prepared for publication a number of Armenological manuscripts of linguistic, literary and historic  interest,&lt;ref&gt;Ed. Sakayan et al. "Sign, System, Communications.

She became a regular participant at international Armenological conferences and congresses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dorasakayan.org./papers.htm |title=Dora Sakayan |work=Dorasakayan.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she also organized Armenological conferences in Canada and Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dorasakayan.org/confs.htm |title=Dora Sakayan |work=Dorasakayan.com |date=2007-07-11 |accessdate=2014-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing her mission as presenting Armenian language and culture to non-Armenians, she founded the series "Armenian Studies for the English Speaking World" and published a number of scholarly books and articles under this heading. To promote the publication of her Armenological books, in 1997 she founded a small press under the name AROD Books in Montreal.

After 25&amp;nbsp;years of service at McGill University, Sakayan retired from the Department of German Studies in 2000 and dedicated herself fully to Armenian Studies. She renewed her ties with Yerevan State University, where she regularly spends a few months every year, participating in scholarly projects, organizing international linguistic conferences, publishing her books with YSU Press and organizing book launches at YSU and elsewhere in Armenia. Among many activities in her homeland, she is the supervisor and participant of an ongoing translation project that she carries out with one of her former students, Evelina Makaryan, a researcher at the Institute for Armenian Studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armin.am/en/news |title=Institute for Armenian Studies of YSU |publisher=Armin.am |date= |accessdate=2014-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; at YSU.

At the same time, Sakayan continues the promotion of Armenian Studies in Canada. In 2005, she founded an Armenian language program at the Diocese of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] in Montreal, carrying on a tradition that she established more than three decades ago (in 1981) at the Centre of Continuing Education at McGill University.

==Works==

===Contrastive grammar===
As a Germanist and educator in the East European tradition, Sakayan has received training in Germanic linguistics and [[language pedagogy]]. This background has led her to applied linguistics, and from the great variety of its interdisciplinary branches Sakayan has concentrated on the following areas: a) [[contrastive linguistics]], b) [[foreign language acquisition]], c) [[translation studies]].

Sakayan includes into the contrastive discussion, besides German, other [[Indo-European languages]]: Russian, English, French, and Modern Greek. As an innovation, she also includes Armenian, a non-European language whose [[Agglutination|agglutinative]] properties set it apart from other languages in the Indo-European family. In fact, in Sakayan’s work, contrastive analysis is predominantly based on Armenian, and other languages are viewed through the prism of this language. The objectives of such an endeavor are to establish [[Linguistic typology|language typologies]] and to identify areas of difficulty in foreign language acquisition. Her work also incorporates the findings of Armenian and Russian data — not always accessible to Western linguists.

Sakayan introduces to the Western reader the idiosyncrasies of Eastern Armenian [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and [[syntax]], with a special focus on the verb system and its rich paradigm of non-finite verb forms, called ''derbays'' (դերբայ = participle). Over the years, she has dealt extensively with East Armenian deverbal [[nominalization]]s, deriving from certain ''derbays'': the Armenian infinitive and three participles: the present, past and the future participle. Within the framework of "Nominalizations of various degrees" Sakayan discusses the regular [[relative clause]] (RC), the ‘relative participles’&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. "On Armenian Relative Participles and their Access to the AH (Accessibilty Hierarchy)." In: Proceedings of the XVth  [[International Congress of Linguists]], Université Laval, 1992, Quebec: Université Laval Press, 1993, vol. 2, pp. 361-364&lt;/ref&gt; (RP based on the present, past and the future participle), as well and other phenomena of relativization in Eastern Armenian.

Sakayan contrasts Armenian clausal nominalizations with their semantic counterparts in a selective number of European languages. A noteworthy monograph in this respect is ''Formen der Textkohärenz: Nominalisierung als sententiale Anapher im Ostarmenischen''.&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. Formen der Textkohärenz. Nominalisierung als sententiale Anapher im Ostarmenischen [Forms of text coherence. Nominalization as sentential anaphora in East Armenian], Tübinger Beiträge zur Linguistik, 299 – [Tübingen contributions to Linguistics, Nr. 299], Tübingen: Gunter Narr 1986. {{ISBN|3-87808-299-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This book explores East Armenian clausal nominalizations that are based on the Armenian infinitive. Sakayan describes the transformation process of finite clauses into economical nominal phrases, gives the morphosyntactic characteristics of these nominalizations, identifies the functions of the agglutinative segments in a synthetic nominalized infinitive (SNI).

===Contrastive phraseology===
Sakayan has also taken a keen interest in contrastive [[phraseology]] in the general sense of the term. Recognizing the importance of ready-made expressions in human communication, she has based her research on self-collected linguistic corpora of phraseological units, such as proverbs and sayings, idiomatic expressions, and routine formulae (gambits).

Sakayan has explored the reproduction of routine formulae (gambits) and their role for turn-taking in conversation and for organizing discourse&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora; Tessier, Christine (1983). "Deutsche Gesprächsformeln in Mikrodialogen" [German Speech Formulae in Mini-Dialogues]. Zielsprache Deutsch 1983/3: pp. 9-14.&lt;/ref&gt; She has created thematically and pragmatically grouped bilingual concordances of routine formulae (gambits) for language learning. See the use of such concordances in Sakayan’s textbooks.&lt;ref name="SakayanDora"&gt;Sakayan, Dora. Western Armenian for the English-speaking World. A Contrastive Approach (with CD-ROM). Yerevan State University Press, 2012. {{ISBN|978-5-8084-0890-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. Eastern Armenian for the English-speaking World. A Contrastive Approach (with CD-ROM). Revised Edition. Yerevan State University Press, 2008. {{ISBN|978-5-8084-0-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sakayan's interest in proverbs resulted in a major [[Paremiology|paremiological]] study accompanied by a bilingual (Armenian-English), thematically arranged anthology of 2,500 proverbs.&lt;ref&gt;Armenian Proverbs: A Paremiological Study with an Anthology of 2,500 Armenian Folk Sayings Selected and Translated into English, Delmar &amp; New York: Caravan Books, First edition: 1994, Second and revised edition: 1995&lt;/ref&gt; An extensive introduction addresses the language and structure,&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. "On the Grammar of Armenian Proverbs." In: John A. C. Greppin (ed.), Proceedings. Fourth International Conference on Armenian Linguistics. [[Cleveland State University]], Cleveland, September 14–19, 1991, Delmar &amp; New York: Caravan Books, 1992, pp. 171-201&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the origin of Armenian proverbs (international, borrowed and specifically Armenian proverbs).

Contrastive paremiology being an ongoing project, Sakayan’s next volume became a language-pair-oriented paremiological study with special focus on German-Armenian connections and discussions on cross-cultural translatability.&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. "Ein Freund kann dir das Gesicht weiß oder schwarz machen: Zum Problem der Übersetzbarkeit von Sprichwörtern" [Problems of proverb translatability]. In: Ferdinand van Ingen and Christian Juranek (eds.). Ars et Amicitia, Festschrift für Martin Bircher zum 60. Geburtstag am 3. Juni 1998. Chloe. Beihefte zum Daphnis. Bd. 28. Amsterdam and Atlanta, Rodopi, 1998, pp. 57-73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. "On Cross-Cultural Understanding of Language-Specific Notions and Concepts in Folklore." In: Alice Sarkösi (ed.), Festschrift for Edmond Schütz, Budapest: Academy of Sciences Press, 1998, pp. 130-145&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the German counterpart of this paremiological study appeared&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. Armenische Sprichwörter. Որտեղ հաց, այնտեղ կաց, որտեղ գինի, այնտեղ քնի: Wiesbaden: [[Otto Harrassowitz Verlag]], 2001. {{ISBN|3-447-04379-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a new introduction that provides an in-depth analysis of the structure and language of Armenian proverbs. Along with the extreme conciseness of the Armenian proverbs, Sakayan points to their capacity to function in various sizes and shapes, from extremely short and compact units to more elaborate and wordy structures (e.g. dialogues). Some of them encapsulate people’s everyday talk, citations of reported or direct speech. Since dialogue proverbs or dramatized proverbs are not a universal genre and can be found only in a few languages, Sakayan explores them extensively.&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. "On Reported and Direct Speech in Proverbs. Dialogue Proverbs in Armenian." In: Proverbium: Yearbook of International Proverb Scholarship, Vol. 16, 1999, pp. 303-324&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign language acquisition===
Sakayan’s scholarly interest in foreign language acquisition is apparent not only in the titles of her published articles, but also in the list of authored and co-authored textbooks, instructional manuals and methodological guides, for the instruction of both German and Armenian as foreign languages&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. Western Armenian for the English-speaking World. A Contrastive Approach (with CD-ROM). Yerevan State University Press, 2012. {{ISBN|978-5-8084-0890-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. Eastern Armenian for the English-speaking World. A Contrastive Approach (with CD-ROM). Yerevan State University Press, 2007. {{ISBN|978-5-8084-0890-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora and Christine Tessier. Rede und Antwort. Übungen zum dialogischen Ausdruck. (with cassette) Coauthor: Chr. Tessier. Ismaning: Hueber Verlag, 1989. {{ISBN|3-19-001482-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these projects demonstrate the benefits of applying the latest trends in linguistics to instructional development.&lt;ref&gt;On newer trends in Foreign language teaching. Expectancy Grammar." In: Semiotics and Language Teaching. Theoretical Principles and Practical Applications. Ann Arbor: Caravan Books, 2001, pp. 9-14&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 1960s and 1970s, while chairing the Department of Foreign Languages at Yerevan State University (YSU) in Soviet Armenia, Sakayan authored and co-authored several textbooks, manuals and methodological guides for the instruction of German in Armenian high schools and universities.&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora and Zaruhi Svazlian. Deutsch für die 6. Klasse. (German for the 6th grade of Armenian secondary schools). Coauthor: Z. Svazlian. Yerevan: Louys Press, 1970 (1st ed.), 1972 (2nd ed.), 1973 (3rd ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora and Zaruhi Svazlian. Deutsch für die 5. Klasse (German for the 5th grade of Armenian secondary schools). Yerevan: Louys Press, 1969 (1st ed.), 1971 (2nd ed.), 1973 (3rd ed).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. Deutsches Lesebuch. [An anthology of German literary]. Yerevan State University Press, 1968 (1st ed.), 1972 (2nd ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. Lies Deutsch, Erzähl Deutsch! (A reader for Armenian secondary schools with German-Armenian commentary and glossary.) Yerevan: Louys Press, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. Deutsches Lesebuch. [An anthology of literary texts for graduate students in philology, with German-Armenian commentary and glossary]. Yerevan: University Press, 1967 (1st ed.), 1972 (2nd ed.).&lt;/ref&gt; However, in accordance with Soviet censorship rules that deprived expatriate authors of authorship, the production of all books carrying her name had to be discontinued after Sakayan’s departure to Canada in 1975.

After resettling in Canada, Sakayan continued her research in Foreign Language Methodology. In close collaboration with Professor Christine Tessier of Université Laval in Quebec City, Canada, Sakayan conducted the research project dedicated to German Stereotyped Speech Forms in Mini-Dialogues. Sakayan and Tessier laid the groundwork for a new method of communicative exercises that has received widespread recognition in the area of DaF (Deutsch als Fremdsprache, or German as a Foreign Language). The project resulted in a book called Rede und Antwort,&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora and Christine Tessier. Rede und Antwort. Übungen zum dialogischen Ausdruck. (with cassette) Coauthor: Chr. Tessier. Ismaning: Hueber Verlag, 1989. {{ISBN|3-19-001482-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; widely used as a supplement to other DaF textbooks at universities; in 1991 it was declared in the AOL-Reference Manual as "a hit textbook for DaF."

The innovative method is based on the introduction of German Stereotyped Speech Forms, or gambits, known for their important role in languages while turn-taking in interaction. Gambits used at the beginning of an utterance are seen as cues that signal not only the illocutionary feature of an utterance, but also its syntactic-semantic unfolding. The method broadly applies [[speech act theory]] and [[text linguistics]], as well as some insights of "grammar of expectancy," to the teaching of DaF. The Rede und Antwort exercises have proven to be an effective means for promoting oral skills in the classroom, which are readily applicable in real life-settings.

Inspired by the success of the Rede und Antwort, in the 1990s Sakayan launched and carried out a completely new project: an introductory university textbook for Western Armenian (Western Armenian for the English-speaking World: A Contrastive Approach). The textbook, which first appeared in 2000,&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. Modern Western Armenian for the English-speaking World. A Contrastive Approach. Montreal: Arod Books, 2000. {{ISBN|0-9699879-2-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; draws on more recent achievements of linguistics in the instruction of Western Armenian. It demonstrates the great potential that contrastive linguistics has for the advancement of foreign language teaching by outlining Armenian-English contrasts throughout the course. It also applies the insights of text linguistics and grammar of expectancy by enhancing the production of correct grammatical forms anticipated by the reproduction of certain ready-made routine formulae. The textbook is conceptualized pragmatically, enabling students to carry out speech acts fundamental for communication. Although grammar receives proper attention, other linguistic aspects such as word formation, semantic vocabulary groups, pronunciation, orthography, etc. are also treated on a regular basis. The textbook was received positively and was adopted by Armenian Studies Programs at universities and schools worldwide.

In 2007, Sakayan published a new Armenian textbook, this time on Eastern Armenian,&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. Eastern Armenian for the English-speaking World. A Contrastive Approach (with CD-ROM). Yerevan State University Press, 2007. {{ISBN|978-5-8084-0890-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; also accompanied by a CD-Rom featuring Eastern Armenian native speakers. To bring the level of the existing Western Armenian textbook to that of its Eastern Armenian counterpart, in 2012 Sakayan published a second and revised edition (with CD-Rom).&lt;ref name="SakayanDora" /&gt;

Both titles are now published by YSU Press. They are consistent in methodology and structure, with a vast amount of linguistic material proportionally distributed among 12 Units, which each consist of 12 sections. These twin Armenian textbooks are considered to be the highlight of Sakayan’s career, reflecting a lifetime of pedagogical and scholarly experience in foreign language teaching and research in applied linguistics.

===Armenian genocide===
Sakayan is also a major contributor to the study of the Armenian Genocide. In 1993, she came across the journal of her maternal grandfather, Dr. Garabed Hatcherian, and has since dedicated herself to its publication and dissemination. The journal is a chronicle of the Smyrna catastrophe of 1922, which describes how the ancient port city in Asia Minor was destroyed by a massive fire, whereby the entire Christian population was either massacred or forced to flee. The journal is also a detailed account of the hardship Dr. Hatcherian and his family of eight endured in September 1922. Dr. Hatcherian’s diary is considered to be the most widely translated book about the Armenian Genocide. So far, the journal has appeared in nine languages, three of which were translated by Sakayan, who is also the general editor of all editions. All volumes include a detailed biography of the author, a literary analysis of the journal in an expanded introduction, 52 annotations of an historical and cultural nature, an afterword, and a bibliography. The meticulous editorial work has made ''An Armenian Doctor in Turkey'' a book that has received a highly favorable international reception&lt;ref&gt;[See worldwide reception of Dr. Hatcherian's Diary pp. 175-207] Ed.

Sakayan) ՅՈՒՇԱՐՁԱՆ Ապրիլ 11-ի – MEMORIAL to April 11. Istanbul: Belge International Publishing, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; This book was first compiled and published in Turkish by Theodik in 1919 in Istanbul to pay tribute to the murdered intellectuals and community leaders of 1915—writers, journalists, editors, clergymen, academics, teachers, and jurists.

This latest edition of Theodik’s Hushartsan, published in commemoration of the 95th Anniversary of the Armenian Genocide, is a bilingual production (Armenian and Turkish) with a trilingual introductory section (Armenian, Turkish, and English) dedicated to the memory of [[Hrant Dink]], the Armenian journalist who was murdered in Istanbul in 2007. Also included in this volume is an Armenian and Turkish index of the names of the 761 Armenian martyrs of April 11 (April 24 according to the Gregorian calendar).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.armenianweekly.com/2010/06/08/theodik/ |title=Theodik’s ‘Memorial to April 11′ Republished in Turkey |publisher=Armenian Weekly |date= |accessdate=2014-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Over the last decade, Sakayan has been working on a translation project with one of her former students, Evelina Makaryan, a researcher at the Institute for Armenian Studies at YSU. This project has yielded six books that Sakayan and Makaryan translated from German into Armenian and published with YSU Press. The translations are predominantly eyewitness testimonies of the Armenian Genocide&lt;ref name=Kunzler/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jakob Künzler, Dreissig Jahre Dienst am Orient [Thirty Years of Service in the Orient] Basel 1933, Translated from German into East Armenian by Dora Sakayan and Evelina Makarian (Յակոբ Քյունցլեր, Երեսուն տարի ծառայություն Արևելքում), Yerevan State University Press, 2008. {{ISBN|978-5-8084-1026-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zwei Kriegsjahre in Konstantinopel, Skizzen Deutsch-Jungtürkischer Moral und Politik von Dr. Harry Stuermer, Korrespondent der "Kölnischen Zeitung" In Konstantinopel, 1915–1916, Verlag Payot, Lausanne, 1917. Translation from German into Armenian in progress.]&lt;/ref&gt; that Sakayan has collected from libraries in German-speaking countries.

Sakayan's latest (and most important) work is a book entitled «Man treibt sie in die Wüste»; Clara und Fritz Sigrist-Hilty als Augenzeugen des Völkermordes an den Armeniern 1915–1918 ["They drive them into the desert": Clara and Fritz Sigrist-Hilty as eyewitnesses of the Armenian Genocide 1915-1918] on the writings of Clara Sigrist-Hilty (1884–1988). One day after their church wedding in April 1915, the civil engineer Fritz Sigrist and the nurse Clara Hilty take the train from Werdenberg (Switzerland) and travel through the war zone to South-Eastern Turkey, where Fritz has been working at the construction of the Baghdad railway since 1910. They settle in Keller (today’s Fevzipaşa), a little town on the flank of the Amanus mountains. Shortly after their arrival, the Armenian deportations start and thousands of Armenians walk past their window. For three years the couple has to witness «the lapsing of human lights down there in the steep gorge» while they live their everyday life in their little house on the remote hillside. A visit to Aleppo makes them realize that what they were seeing in Keller on a daily basis was nothing but premeditated death marches. Things deteriorate when the skilled Armenian workers at the Baghdad railway construction site must also join those death marches. Clara feels obliged to record the atrocities, first in her journal, and later in a special eyewitness account. Fritz in his turn writes some important essays on the subject.

Sakayan has deciphered and transcribed the documents written in Gothic handwriting; she has meticulously processed the data and embedded them in the historic events of the time. Moreover, based on a memoir by Haig Aramian, Sakayan recounts the adventurous story of how in June 1916 the couple Sigrist-Hilty helped their Armenian storehouse manager Aramian to escape certain death. The structure of the book presented itself from the available archival materials. The book consists of three parts, each centered around one main character: Clara and Fritz Sigrist-Hilty, and Haig Aramian. Through a thoughtful interplay of primary and secondary texts, Sakayan tells a coherent story of endless human suffering, but also of Christian compassion and selflessness.

===Translations===
At an early stage of her career, Sakayan’s knowledge of languages directed her towards translation and interpretation, and some of her translations were published early on.&lt;ref&gt;Manouk Abeghian (1865–1944) Der armenische Volksglaube [Armenian Folk Beliefs].

This furthered her interest in the theoretical aspects of translation. During the Summer semesters between 1981 and 1986, her contact and collaboration with the Translation Department of Saarbrücken University in Germany (Chairman: Dr. Wolfram Wilss) intensified her involvement and productivity in that field and resulted in several articles published in scholarly journals and books, as well as in several papers presented at international conferences.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5030">The '''Edgar Morin Centre''' (French: ''Centre Edgar Morin'', previously '''CETSAH''', ''Centre d’Études Transdisciplinaires, Sociologie, Anthropologie, Histoire'') is a graduate teaching and research unit of the [[École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales]] and of the French [[Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique]], [[Paris]]. Currently enjoying its fifth decade of activity, the Center (named after the internationally renowned social theorist [[Edgar Morin]]) is part of the Interdisciplinary Institute for the Anthropology of Contemporary Societies (IIAC).

== History ==

The Edgar Morin Center was established in 1960 at the [[École Pratique des Hautes Études]] by French sociologist [[Georges Friedmann]]. Initially named ''Center for the Study of Mass Communications'', it evolved into the CETSAH in 1973. Only in 2007 it was given its current name, as a tribute to [[Edgar Morin]]. Under the prestigious guidance and influence of Morin and of the late [[Roland Barthes]], over the years the Centre has been producing research in such fields as [[sociology]], [[cultural anthropology]], [[semiotics]], [[media studies]], [[complex systems|complexity studies]], [[philosophy]], [[history]], [[political science]] and [[social psychology]].

== Research activities ==

[[Transdisciplinarity]] is the main feature of research at the Edgar Morin Centre. Typical research topics offer multiple potential entries. [[Food]], for instance, is a basic function both in physiological and social terms. As another example, the [[Human body|body]] can and should be considered as a historical, medical, psychosocial, political, and [[social construct]]. All the teams apply this perspective to their specific topics. The Centre currently hosts about 80 researchers, doctoral and masters students.

Research teams are organised as follows:

'''Emanuel Anthony Posselt''' (1858–1921) was an authority on [[Jacquard loom]]s and weaving. His book on the Jacquard machine is considered to be a classic.&lt;ref name=csbio&gt;[https://www.cs.arizona.edu/patterns/weaving/webdocs/pea_bibl.pdf cs.arizona.edu: "Emanuel Anthony Posselt"], by Ralph E. Griswold&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Posselt, the son of Emanuel Anthony and Elizabeth (Demuth) Posselt, was born in [[Liberec|Reichenberg, Austrian Empire]] (current Liberec, [[Czech Republic]]) on 21 August 1858. Emanuel graduated in 1876 from the [[Imperial Government Weaving School]], also in Reichenberg. During the next two years, he visited most of the important textile manufacturing cities in Europe, and during this time he managed his father's textile mills. In August 1878, he went to the United States, where he worked until 1884 for various textile mills in New England and Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name=csbio/&gt;

In 1884, Posselt became the inaugural director of the textile division of [[Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Art]]. In 1891, he resigned that position to accept the editorship of the [[Textile Record of North America]], at the time a leading trade journal.&lt;ref name=csbio/&gt;

Posselt then established a private textile academy and a textile trade book business. He published his own work on the Jacquard machine, the technology of textile design, textile calculations, and cotton, wool and silk industries; as well as works by other authors, such as Gardner on wool dyeing.  The series ''Hand Books of the Textile Industry'' and ''Posselt's Textile Library'', as well as ''Posselt's Textile Journal'' that ran between 1907 and 1923, are his own.  The last was the immediate forerunner of [[Textile World]].&lt;ref name=csbio/&gt;

Posselt died in 1921.&lt;ref name=csbio/&gt;

==Family==

Posselt married in July 1884 at [[Colchester, Vermont]] Anna Clera Pollinger, by whom he had three children: Anna (1896), Elwood (1906) and Gertrude (1908).&lt;ref name=csbio/&gt;

== History ==

According to [[Judy Wajcman]], the concept of technology has historically been bound to indigenous women.  The roles of harvesters, or caretakers of the domestic economy taken up by these women lead Wajcman to conclude they would have created tools such as the [[sickle]] and the [[pestle]], making them the first technologists.&lt;ref name= wajcman&gt;Judy Wajcman, TechnoFeminism, 1st ed. (Cambridge: Polity, 2004). {{ISBN|0745630448}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15}} During the Eighteenth century, industrial engineering began to constitute the modern definition of technology. This transformed the meaning from including useful arts technology – such as [[needlework]], [[metalwork]], [[weaving]], and [[mining]] – to strictly applied science.&lt;ref name= wajcman/&gt;{{rp|16}}  As a result, "male machines" replaced the "female fabrics" as identifiers of modern technology when engineering was considered as masculine profession.&lt;ref name= wajcman/&gt;{{rp|16}} Due to political movements of the 1960s and early 70s, science and technology were considered for a profit industrial, governmental, or militaristic based practice, and associated with masculinity resulting in a lack of feminist discourse.&lt;ref name = weber398&gt;{{Cite book | last=Weber|first=Jutta| title = From Science and Technology to Feminist Technoscience | year = 2006 | url = https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/ZIF/FG/2006Application/PDF/Weber_essay.pdf |isbn = 9780761943907|pages=398 |journal=Handbook of Gender and Women's Studies| publisher=Davis K, Evans M, Lorber J| ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist scholarship identified the absence of women's presence in technological and scientific spheres, due the use of sex stereotyping in education and sexual discrimination in the workforce, as well as the development of technology as a masculine construct.&lt;ref name= wajcman/&gt;{{rp|16}}  Examples of masculine-coded technologies under these categories included [[ARPANET]], a precursor to the internet developed by the United States Department of Defence, and the [[Manhattan Project]].

The women's health movements of the 1970s US and UK provided momentum to the emergence of feminist politics around scientific knowledge. During the early states of [[second-wave feminism]], campaigns for improved birth control and abortion rights were at the forefront in challenging the consolidation of male dominated sciences and technologies at the expense of women's health.  The act of regaining knowledge and control over women's bodies was seen as a crucial component to women's liberation.&lt;ref name= wajcman/&gt;{{rp|17}}

Science was originally seen as an alien entity opposed to women's interests. Sciences and technologies developed under the misconception that women's needs were universal and inferior to the needs of men, forcing women into rigid, determined sex roles.&lt;ref name= wajcman/&gt;{{rp|18}} A shift happened in the 1980s – [[Sandra Harding]] proposed "the female question in science" to raise "the question of the science in feminism", claiming that science is involved in projects that are not only neutral and objective, but that are strongly linked to male interests.&lt;ref name= wajcman/&gt;{{rp|18}} The conceptualization of science and technology was expanded to reflect the all-pervasive ways in which technology is encountered in daily life,&lt;ref name = weber398&gt;{{Cite book | last=Weber|first=Jutta| title = From Science and Technology to Feminist Technoscience | year = 2006 | url = https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/ZIF/FG/2006Application/PDF/Weber_essay.pdf |isbn = 9780761943907|pages=398 |journal=Handbook of Gender and Women's Studies| publisher=Davis K, Evans M, Lorber J| ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; gaining attention of feminists out of concern for female positions in science and technological professions.  Rather than asking how women can be better treated within and by science, feminist critics instead chose to focus on how a science deeply involved in masculinity and masculine projects could be used for the emancipation of women.&lt;ref name= wajcman/&gt;{{rp|18}}

Today's feminist critique often uses the former demonology of technology as a point of departure to tell a story of progress from liberal to [[postmodern feminism]]. According to Judy Wajcman, both liberal and Marxist feminists failed in the analysis of science and technology, because they considered the technology as neutral and did not pay attention to the symbolic dimension of technoscience.&lt;ref name="Wajcmanp25"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wajcman|first=Judy|title=Technofeminism|pages=25–26 |year=2004|publisher=Polity|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom|isbn=0-7456-3043-X|edition=Réimpr. 2005.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feminist technologies and technoscience studies ==

Feminist technoscience studies have become intrinsically linked with practices of [[Technoethics#Technofeminism|Technofeminism]] and the development of feminist technologies in cultural and critical vernacular.  Feminist technoscience studies explore the coded social and historical implications of science and technology on the development of society, including how identity constructs and is constructed by these technologies.  Technofeminism emerged in the early 1980s, leaning on the different feminist movements. Feminist scholars reanalyzed the [[Scientific Revolution]], and stated that the resulting science was based on the masculine ideology of exploiting the Earth and control.  During this time, nature and scientific inquiry were modelled after misogynous relationships to women.  Femininity was associated with nature and considered as something passive to be objectified. This was in contrast to culture, which was represented by objectifying masculinity.  This analysis depended on the use of gender imagery to conceptualize the nature of technoscientific masculine ideology.&lt;ref name= wajcman/&gt;{{rp|85}}

Judy Wajcman draws parallels between [[Judith Butler]]'s theory of gender performativity and the construction of technology.  Butler conceives gender as a performative act as opposed to a naturalized condition one is born into.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Performative Acts and Gender Constitution: An Essay in Phenomenology and Feminist Theory |first=Judith |last=Butler |doi=10.2307/3207893|journal= Theatre Journal 40, no. 4 |pages= 519–31 |date=1988 |volume=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Through a fluctuating process achieved in daily social interaction, gender identity is acted and constructed through relational behaviours – it is a fluid concept. Drawing from the work of Butler and [[Donna Haraway]], Amade M'charek analyzes how objects, when linked to another object or signifier, construct identity through the use of human imagination:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Differences and similarities may be stable or not, depending on the maintenance work that goes into the relations that help to produce them. They are neither fundaments nor qualities that are always embodied… Differences are relational. They do not always materialize in bodies (in the flesh, genes, hormones, brains, or the skin). Rather they materialize in the very relations that help to enact them.&lt;ref name = Amade&gt;{{cite journal |title= Fragile Differences, Relational Effects: Stories about the Materiality of Race and Sex |first=Amade |last=M'charek |doi=10.1177/1350506810377698|journal=European Journal of Women's Studies |page= 313 |volume=17 |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In this theory, identity is not the byproduct of genes, but the constant upholding of hierarchical difference relations.&lt;ref name = Amade&gt;{{cite journal |title= Fragile Differences, Relational Effects: Stories about the Materiality of Race and Sex |first=Amade |last=M'charek |doi=10.1177/1350506810377698|journal=European Journal of Women's Studies |page= 313 |volume=17 |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Differences in identity are the effect of interferences, performing and enacting and being enacted upon.  Technology too, as proposed by Wajcman, is a product of mutual alliances, not objectively given but collectively created in a process of reiteration.  To this end, technology exists as both a source and a concurrence of identity relations.

Western technology and science is deeply implicated in the masculine projection and patriarchal domination of women and nature.&lt;ref name= wajcman/&gt;{{rp|85}}   After the shift of feminist theory to focus more on technoscience, there was a call for new technology to be based on the needs and values of women, rather than masculine dominated technological development.  The differences between female and male needs were asserted by feminist movements, drawing attention to the exclusion of women being served by current technologies.&lt;ref name= wajcman/&gt;{{rp|22}}  Reproductive technologies in particular were influenced by this movement. During this time, household technologies, new media, and new technosciences were, for the most part, disregarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Kathy|editor-last=Davis|title=Handbook of gender and women's studies|year=2006|publisher=Sage|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=9780761943907|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feminist technologies===

[[Feminist]] technologies are ones that are formed from feminist social relations, but varied definitions and layers of feminism complicate the definition.  Deborah Johnson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Deborah G.|title=Sorting out the question of feminist technology|journal=Feminist technology|year=2010|page=6|url=http://www.nyu.edu/projects/nissenbaum/papers/Sorting%20out%20the%20Question%20of%20Feminist%20Technology.pdf|accessdate=30 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposes four candidates for feminist technologies: 
* Technologies that are good for women
* Technologies that constitute gender-equitable social relations
* Technologies that favor women
* Technologies that constitute social relations that are more equitable than those that were constituted by a prior technology or than those that prevail in the wider society

The successes of certain technologies, such as the [[pap smear]] for cervical cancer testing, relied on the feminization of technician jobs.  The intervention of women outside the technological sphere, like from members of the women's health movement, and public health activists also aided in the tool's development.&lt;ref&gt;Judy Wajcman, TechnoFeminism, 1st ed. (Cambridge: Polity, 2004), 48.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, other feminist technologies, such as birth control serve as an example of a feminist technology also shaped in part by dominant masculinity.

[[Combined oral contraceptive pills]] were first approved for use in the United States in 1960, during the time of the women's liberation movement. The birth control pill helped make it possible for more women to enter the workforce by giving them the ability to control her own fertility.  Decades prior to this, activists such as [[Margaret Sanger]] and [[Katharine McCormick]] fought for female contraceptives, seeing it as a necessity for the emancipation of women.&lt;ref&gt;"People &amp; Events: The Pill and the Women's Liberation Movement." PBS. Accessed December 04, 2016. https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/pill/peopleevents/e_lib.html.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in the 1970s feminists raised critique on male control of the medical and [[pharmaceutical industry]].  The male domination of these fields led technologies such as oral contraceptives to be developed around what men considered to be universal, defining characteristics of women (these being their sex and reproductive capabilities).&lt;ref name=Wajcman50&gt;Judy Wajcman, TechnoFeminism, 1st ed. (Cambridge: Polity, 2004), 50.&lt;/ref&gt;  Birth control pills themselves also succeeded in perpetrating and creating this universality – shaped by moral considerations of the natural body, the length of the menstrual cycle was able to be engineered.&lt;ref name=Wajcman50&gt;Judy Wajcman, TechnoFeminism, 1st ed. (Cambridge: Polity, 2004), 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bioethics and capitalism ===

The development of reproductive technologies blur the lines between nature and technology, allowing for the reconfiguration of life itself. Through the advances of genetic technologies, the controlling of pregnancy, childbirth, and motherhood has become increasingly possible through intrusive means.  These advances in [[biotechnology]] are serving to develop life as a commodity and deepen monetary inequality - a link made by feminist theorists such as Donna Haraway.&lt;ref name = weber399&gt;{{Cite book | last=Weber|first=Jutta| title = From Science and Technology to Feminist Technoscience |  year = 2006 | url = https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/ZIF/FG/2006Application/PDF/Weber_essay.pdf |isbn = 9780761943907|pages=399|journal=Handbook of Gender and Women's Studies| publisher=Davis K, Evans M, Lorber J| ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Genetic engineering also brings about questions in eugenics, leading to early radical feminist analysis to declare and attempt to reclaim motherhood as a foundation of female identity.&lt;ref name= wajcman/&gt;{{rp|79}} The idea of a green, natural motherhood was popularized by [[Ecofeminism#ecofeminism|eco feminists]] who celebrated the identification of women with nature, and natural life.&lt;ref name= wajcman/&gt;{{rp|79}}

Haraway instead chooses to embrace technology as feminist instead of reverting to this idea of naturalized femininity. By embracing the image of the [[cyborg]],  an amalgamation that is neither human/animal nor machine, Haraway explores the ideas of technoscience and gender, conceptualizing a space where gender is an arbitrary, unnecessary construct.&lt;ref name= wajcman/&gt;{{rp|80}}

The corporatization of biology through the alteration of nature through technology is also a theme explored by Haraway. The [[oncomouse#oncomouse|OncoMouse]] is a laboratory mouse genetically modified to carry a specific gene which increases the creature's chance of developing cancer.  Until 2005, American conglomerate DuPoint owned the patent to the OncoMouse, reconfiguring and relegating life to a commodity.&lt;ref name= wajcman/&gt;{{rp|89}} This development in genetic engineering brings up questions about lab animal treatment, as well as ethical questions around class and race. Increasing [[breast cancer]] rates in Black women are discussed in [[eco-feminist]] analysis of the modification of lab animals from breast cancer research to being the discussion into an ethically ambiguous space.  Haraway in particular raises the question of whether modifying and expending a live commodity like OncoMouse is ethical if it leads to the development of a cure for breast cancer.&lt;ref name= wajcman/&gt;{{rp|91}}

The reconfiguring of life in biotechnologies and genetic engineering allow for a precedence to be set, leading to capitalist cultural consequences.  Through these technologies technoscience becomes naturalized, and also becomes increasingly subject to the process of commodification and capital accumulation in transnational capitalist corporations.&lt;ref name= wajcman/&gt;{{rp|89}} Like presented in [[Marxist]] and [[Neo-Marxist]] analysis of sciences, biotechnologies allow for the concept of commodity to become fetishized as genes are reified to have a monetary value outside nature.  This also develops life and nature as a thing to be exploited by capitalism.&lt;ref name= wajcman/&gt;{{rp|90}}

The 19th-century philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] is known as a critic of [[Judeo-Christian]] morality and religions in general. One of the arguments he raised against the truthfulness of these doctrines is that they are based upon the concept of [[free will]], which, in his opinion, does not exist.&lt;ref&gt;B. Leiter, ''Routledge Philosophy GuideBook to Nietzsche on Morality'', Routledge 2002, p. 68-69: "He also ''shares'' with the Materialists a blanket repudiation of the idea of free will." [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZbeGAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA68&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SimAY6RRK9&amp;sig=t5B7vVeXlOWDMu6I5m3gTA_hZGk&amp;hl=pl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6SFsVbqHNoG0sgHZ5oDwBg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Online text here]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19322/19322-h/19322-h.htm#THE_ANTICHRIST The Antichrist]'', 26, tr. [[H. L. Mencken]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schopenhauer==
In ''[[The Gay Science]]'', Nietzsche praises [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s "immortal doctrines of the intellectuality of intuition, the apriority of the law of causality, (...) and the non-freedom of the will,&lt;ref&gt;''[https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/n/nietzsche/friedrich/n67j/book2.html The Gay Science]'', 99, tr. T. Common.&lt;/ref&gt;" which have not been assimilated enough by the disciples. Following is, then, the short description of those views of the latter philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. B. Leiter, ''Routledge Philosophy GuideBook to Nietzsche on Morality'', Routledge 2002, p. 59: "Schopenhauer's picture is, in fact, richer than this, and important for understanding Nietzsche." [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZbeGAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA59&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SimAY6RRK9&amp;sig=t5B7vVeXlOWDMu6I5m3gTA_hZGk&amp;hl=pl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6SFsVbqHNoG0sgHZ5oDwBg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Online text here]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The principle of causality===
In ''Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason'' Schopenhauer claimed to prove &amp;ndash; in accordance with [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and against [[David Hume|Hume]] &amp;ndash; that causality is present in the perceivable reality as its principle, i.e. it precedes and enables human perception (so called [[apriority]] of the principle of causality), and thus it is not just an observation of something likely, statistically frequent, which however does not happen "on principle" ([[empiricism]] of the principle of causality). More on this dispute in philosophy can be found in the article on [[Free will#Free will and views of causality|free will]].

===Physical freedom===
In his treatise ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]'', Schopenhauer calls the fact that we can do whatever we will a physical freedom, i.e. lack of physically present obstacles, which is not identical with moral freedom.&lt;ref name="OFW"&gt;Schopenhauer, ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]'', 1839, c. 1 (explanation of terms), "What is meant by freedom?". [http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam032/98022360.pdf First chapter online]&lt;/ref&gt; Physically "free" means: one acting according only to one's will; if attempts are made to use this term to the will itself, the question arises: "is will itself willed?," "do you will the will to become so-and-so?". It is therefore a specific aspect of the claim of freedom, in which it is stressed whether the course of consciousness follows indeed in a willed way. The problem of willing the will appears in ''Thus spake Zarathustra'', for instance in the chapter "Backworldsmen."&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.org/stream/thusspakezarathu01998gut/spzar10.txt Thus spake Zarathustra]'', "The backworldsmen", tr. T. Common.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Necessity vs. contingency===
In ''On the Freedom of the Will'', Schopenhauer demonstrates the (well known in philosophy) distinction between necessity and contingency.&lt;ref name="OFW"/&gt; He calls "necessary" what follows from a given sufficient basis&lt;ref&gt;Such sufficient basis can then be transcribed as the presence of all the necessary conditions of the occurrence of an effect. As long as it is possible to point out some necessary conditions of an event or state, so long there also exists a sufficient basis, which in case of its occurrence will work with necessity; it is dictated by logic. ''Cf.'' there, c. 4 ("Precursors"), a quote from Hobbes. This does not preclude the inclusion of an accurate realization of a certain random variable in a sufficient basis.&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e. that what is already certain – if one knows that the sufficient cause is present). On the other hand, one calls "contingent"&lt;ref&gt;''Zufällig'' is the German adjective combining all the meanings of chance, randomness, fortuity, and contingency; the same situation in several other European languages. Perhaps ''fortuitous'' or ''random'' to something could better suit the intuitive meaning, and such translation of this scholastic term is sometimes used. The term is sometimes used in a misleading way so that it denotes in general all "instances [products] of a rule" (which are indeed contingent to each other), and then lack of necessity is triumphantly announced (like in the case of St. Thomas Aquinas), whereas one in fact agrees that there are still causes (so another connection-by-necessity must exist); this is the so-called relative fortuity of events. For Schopenhauer it is the starting point for discussion about absolute fortuity and lack of causes.&lt;/ref&gt; or "incidental" (with regard to a sufficient basis) that what does not follow from the latter (so e.g. two unconnected events can be contingent to each other: like when a black cat crosses the street and one's job is lost on the same day). As ''moral'' freedom means lack of necessity, it would mean a lack of ''any'' basis: it "would have to be defined as ''absolutely contingent''",&lt;ref name="OFW"/&gt; i.e. an '''[[Indeterminism#Philosophy|absolute fortuity, or chance]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;The above-mentioned classification of phenomena in Schopenhauer's works is not really a methodology or a kind of optics, but simply a notice that either an event or a state is determined (by another, by anything) or it is not (by another, by anything; like in case of a choice when all its directing forces – will, values, all emotional aspects – are rejected or unworking). Thus philosophers even before Schopenhauer have already thought that everything is either necessary or fortuitous and as much as one does not apply, the other does; so for instance in Kant's ''Critique of Pure Reason'', where the distinction is one of categories of reason.&lt;/ref&gt;

The question about the freedom of will is thus the question whether something depends on another thing (a state, an event), i.e. is in some way determined by it, or does not depend on anything (then we call it a chance). Or, in other words, whether something can be predicted: whether it is certain (given the presence or absence of the sufficient cause) or not. Cf. Luther's argument: for him everything is a necessity because the Creator knows it already.

==Nietzsche's analysis==

===Power of will===
In ''Beyond Good and Evil'' Nietzsche criticizes the concept of free will both negatively and positively.&lt;ref name="BGE"&gt;''[https://archive.org/stream/beyondgoodandevi00nietuoft/beyondgoodandevi00nietuoft_djvu.txt Beyond Good and Evil]'', 21, tr. H. Zimmern&lt;/ref&gt; He calls it a folly resulting from extravagant pride of man; and calls the idea a ''crass stupidity''. The latter probably relates to ordinary-man's visions about a god who (after the ellapse of eternal waiting) creates the world and then waits and observes (being, however, still "beyond time"): and then he is surprised and subdued by what one does.&lt;ref&gt;Why then it does not surprise man? Cf. the so-called [[Argument from free will|paradox of omniscience]], according to which there is a contradiction between visions of a live and free God and omniscience or even the possibility of omniscience.&lt;/ref&gt; (This vision is brought up by Nietzsche in ''The Antichrist''.)&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19322/19322-h/19322-h.htm#THE_ANTICHRIST The Antichrist]'', 48, tr. H. L. Mencken.&lt;/ref&gt;

Next, he argues that free will generally represents an error of ''causa sui'':&lt;ref&gt;That is, "X is the cause of X" &amp;ndash; whereas "cause" should in philosophy be usually something else than effect. The terms ''causa sui'' (cause of self, here considered a fallacy), ''causa prima'' (first cause), and absolute randomness have a common logical sense with respect to states and events in the universe, but occur in different philosophical contexts and with different aspects of meaning and associations.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|The &lt;u&gt;desire&lt;/u&gt; for "freedom of will" in the superlative, metaphysical sense, such as still holds sway, unfortunately, in the minds of the half-educated, the desire to bear the entire and ultimate responsibility for one's actions oneself, and to absolve God, the world, ancestors, chance, and society therefrom, involves nothing less than to be precisely this ''causa sui'', and, with more than Munchausen daring, to pull oneself up into existence by the hair, out of the slough of nothingness.&lt;ref name="BGE"/&gt;}}

Finally, he suggests that the only ''real'' thing about will is whether it is strong (i.e. hard to break) or weak:

{{Quotation|The "non-free will" is mythology; in real life it is only a question of ''strong'' and ''weak'' will.&lt;ref name="BGE"/&gt;}}

Nothing is (or can be) fully resistant to stimula, for that would mean it is immutable: whereas nothing in this world is or can be immutable.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.handprint.com/SC/NIE/GotDamer.html Twilight of the Idols]'', c. 3, sect. 2, tr. W. Kaufmann &amp;amp; R.J. Hollingdale.&lt;/ref&gt; He therefore continues here the Schopenhauer's issue of physical freedom: "whether you will, what you willed to will".&lt;ref&gt;The composition actually already known to Hegel, in ''[[Elements of the Philosophy of Right]]'', 27, written in 1821. In Schopenhauer's essay an infinite regression arises upon considering this issue, when one assumes the fixed answer Yes to the question about freedom; so a logical fallacy occurs. This already can suggest that there is a problem with searching for cause of everything one does in consciousness.&lt;/ref&gt;

Will is generally considered a mental power. "Freedom" of will could then be interpreted as: power of will (cf. the appropriate passus from ''The Antichrist'', where Nietzsche generally opposes will-based psychology&lt;ref name="A14"&gt;''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19322/19322-h/19322-h.htm#THE_ANTICHRIST The Antichrist The Antichrist]'', 14, tr. H. L. Mencken.&lt;/ref&gt;). Will has power over actions, over many things; therefore, things are ''determined'' by will. But is this power unlimited? Does will rule without itself being ruled? (And further: does a Christian want to sin?) &amp;ndash; Nietzsche disagrees. A godless man becomes pious out of "grace", he did not want it; and likewise a pious man becomes godless with no merit or guilt. Nietzsche suggests in many places that if a pious man loses faith, it is because of the power of his ''values'' over him, of the will for truthfulness...

==="Me", will, and chance===
[[Volition (psychology)|Will]] is something that determines human acts, thoughts etc.  It is will what makes man reluctant to toss a coin for something (cf. ''The Antichrist'' about Christians: "in point of fact, they simply do what they cannot help doing"&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19322/19322-h/19322-h.htm#THE_ANTICHRIST The Antichrist The Antichrist]'', 44, tr. H. L. Mencken.&lt;/ref&gt;). The problem is, whether it is itself ruled? And here two terms which complicate the picture appear: the term "me" and "chance" (i.e. something independent from anything, beyond control).

The term "me" (as in the statements "it's up to me", "it is ''you'' who willed that") had already been recognized as empty in the preface of ''Beyond Good and Evil''&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.org/stream/beyondgoodandevi00nietuoft/beyondgoodandevi00nietuoft_djvu.txt Beyond Good and Evil]'', Preface, tr. H. Zimmern.&lt;/ref&gt; (or as connected with the ''superstition about the soul''). Later Nietzsche stated more clearly that it was a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]] ("what will I do? what will my decision be?" &amp;ndash; "it's up to ''you''" &amp;ndash; that actually means: your decision depends on your decision, something happens in your mind and not somewhere else...). See e.g. ''On the Genealogy of Morals'':&lt;ref&gt;''[http://home.sandiego.edu/~janderso/360/genealogy1.htm On the Genealogy of Morals] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008192122/http://home.sandiego.edu/~janderso/360/genealogy1.htm |date=2014-10-08 }}'', treatise I, 13, tr. W. Kaufmann.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|For, in just the same way as people separate lightning from its flash and take the latter as an ''action'', as the effect of a subject which is called lightning, so popular morality separates strength from the manifestations of strength, as if behind the strong person there were an indifferent substrate, which is ''free'' to express strength or not. But there is no such substrate; &lt;u&gt;there is no "being" behind the doing, acting, becoming&lt;/u&gt;. "The doer" is merely made up and added into the action &amp;ndash; the act is everything. People basically duplicate the action: &lt;u&gt;when they see a lightning flash, that is an action of an action: they set up the same event first as the cause and then yet again as its effect&lt;/u&gt;. (...) "We weak people are merely weak. It's good if we do nothing; ''we are not strong enough for that''" &amp;ndash; but this bitter state, this shrewdness of the lowest ranks, which even insects possess (when in great danger they stand as if they were dead in order not to do "too much"), has, thanks to that counterfeiting and self-deception of powerlessness, dressed itself in the splendour of a self-denying, still, patient virtue, &lt;u&gt;just as if the weakness of the weak man himself&lt;/u&gt; &amp;ndash; that means his ''essence'', his actions, his entire single, inevitable, and irredeemable reality &amp;ndash; &lt;u&gt;is a voluntary achievement, something willed, chosen, an ''act'', ''something of merit''&lt;/u&gt;.}}

The same however can be applied to the ''moral'' weakness of a Christian (his lack of resistance), who would certainly prefer not to sin and would construct himself otherwise if he could. "And many a one can command himself, but still sorely lacketh self-obedience!"&lt;ref&gt;''[https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/n/nietzsche/friedrich/n67a/part1.html#chapter3 Thus spake Zarathustra]'', tr. T. Common, "Old and new tables", 4.&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; Nietzsche criticizes the idea of "free choice", and even of "choice" in general (cf. the end of above quotation): man does not want to "choose", man wants to affirm himself ("[[will to power]]").&lt;ref&gt;Francesco Belfiore, ''The Triadic Structure of the Mind: Outlines of a Philosophical System'' (2nd edition), Univ. Press of America, 2014, p. 380: "My comment is that Nietzsche, as I point out elsewhere (...), conceived the will to power as the expression of the outward/selfish desire of the agent to affirm and impose on others his apirations, interests and preferences, regardless to any inward/moral thought and feeling." See also on p. 472: "Again with regard to the &amp;laquo;will to power&amp;raquo;, he held that &amp;laquo;A living thing seeks above all to ''discharge'' its strength &amp;ndash; life itself is ''will to power''; self-preservation is only one of the indirect and most frequent ''results''&amp;raquo;."&lt;/ref&gt;

Another problem is the role of chance. Unless the change brought to man is too big, a chance is generally responded by will, ''wherever there is will''. He calls it "the redemption (of chance)". This topic dawns as early as in ''Human, All Too Human'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[s:Human All-Too-Human#SECOND DIVISION - The History Of The Moral Sentiments.|Human, All Too Human'', 173, under the topic: ''Corriger la fortune'' (to correct a chance), tr. R.J. Hollingdale.]]&lt;/ref&gt; and it returns in many places of ''Zarathustra''. For instance in part 3 it is discussed as follows:

::I am Zarathustra the godless! I cook every chance in my pot. And only when it hath been quite cooked do I welcome it as my food.
::&lt;u&gt;And verily, many a chance came imperiously unto me: but still more imperiously did my Will speak unto it&lt;/u&gt; (...)&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.org/stream/thusspakezarathu01998gut/spzar10.txt Thus spake Zarathustra]'', "The Bedwarfing Virtue", 3, tr. T. Common.&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier in this part:

::The time is now past when accidents ''[Zufälle]'' could befall me; and what could not fall to my lot which would not already be mine own!"&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', "The Wanderer".&lt;/ref&gt;

To cut it short, if it was always that "''we'' choose a chance", then there would be determinism (for "we", "we ourselves" means: our will and its filtering and determining capabilities). And since it happens otherwise ("a chance chooses us"), then there is indeterminism. But the latter case means we have no will in a topic, i.e. it is at that time morally indifferent to us, ''adiaphora'', not opposed to anything (and therefore even more there is no guilt).

===Necessity in man. What is "unfree will"?===
Since free will is discussed, it must obviously be some restricted reality (if "freedom" meant "everything," there would be no need for a separate word). What follows? That there must be events ''external'' to one's freedom: therefore, besides "free will" there should also consequently be "unfree will." Although Nietzsche considers both terms entirely fictional, he gives some clues about the ''psychological'' reality behind them:

{{Quotation|When man experiences the conditions of power, the imputation is that he is not their cause, that he is ''not responsible'' for them &amp;mdash; they come without being willed, consequently we are not their author: &lt;u&gt;the will that is not free (i.e., the consciousness that we have been changed without having willed it)&lt;/u&gt; needs an ''external'' will.&lt;ref&gt;''The Will to Power'', Book II ("Critique of highest values hitherto"), I. Critique of religion, 1. Genesis of Religions, &amp;sect;135, where he demonstrates the notion of "unfree will" as crucial to the emergence of many religious explanations. Vintage Books edition, September, 1968, tr. W. Kaufmann &amp;amp; R.J. Hollingdale. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Magi-iz7kIQC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;lpg=PA86&amp;dq=&amp;quot;136+(March-June+1888)&amp;quot;&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OcKHVB3dib&amp;sig=-9HqUzdC-rG-EJGaHY9P1NVGLwM&amp;hl=pl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6bUfVLCeEKT9ywP4_YKgAg&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22136%20(March-June%201888)%22&amp;f=false Online version here]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In short, an unexpected change. Now, going back to the mentioned definition, [[randomness|chance]] means: that what cannot be predicted. If randomness affects a man (unsubjugated, reaching even the surface of his consciousness), then "unfree will" occurs. Thus, whenever we call something free, we ''feel'' something free, in short: wherever we feel our power, it is deterministic, it is a necessity. And indeed Nietzsche says it with the mouth of Zarathustra:

::Out into distant futures, which no dream hath yet seen, into warmer souths than ever sculptor conceived, &amp;mdash; where gods in their dancing are ashamed of all clothes: (...)
::Where all time seemed to me a blessed mockery of moments, &lt;u&gt;where necessity was freedom itself, which played happily with the goad of freedom:&lt;/u&gt; &amp;mdash;&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.org/stream/thusspakezarathu01998gut/spzar10.txt Thus spake Zarathustra]'', "Old and new tables", 2, tr. T. Common.&lt;/ref&gt;

The same in ''Beyond Good and Evil'':

{{Quotation|Artists have here perhaps a finer intuition; they who know only too well that precisely when they no longer do anything "arbitrarily," and everything of necessity, their feeling of freedom, of subtlety, of power, of creatively fixing, disposing, and shaping, reaches its climax &amp;mdash; in short, that necessity and "freedom of will" are then the same thing with them.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.org/stream/beyondgoodandevi00nietuoft/beyondgoodandevi00nietuoft_djvu.txt Beyond Good and Evil]'', 213, tr. H. Zimmern.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===The universe indeterministic?===
Yet in another part of ''Zarathustra'' Nietzsche claims that when we look long-term enough and from the bird's-eye perspective of supreme powers big enough, a chance is unimportant, because it is subject to and step-by-step softened and arranged by natural laws and necessities which constitute the order of the world and evolution:

{{Quotation|If ever a breath hath come to me of the creative breath, &lt;u&gt;and of the heavenly necessity which compelleth even chances to dance star-dances&lt;/u&gt;: (...)&lt;ref name=TSZ3&gt;''[https://archive.org/stream/thusspakezarathu01998gut/spzar10.txt Thus spake Zarathustra]'', "The Seven Seals", 3, tr. T. Common.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

To Nietzsche everything in this world is an expression of will to power.&lt;ref&gt;K. Gemes, J. Richardson, ''The Oxford Handbook of Nietzsche'', Oxford Univ. Press, 2013, p. 177-178 ("The Duality of Nietzsche's Theory of the Will to Power: The Psychological and Cosmological Aspects"). [https://books.google.com/books?id=yZmJAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA177&amp;redir_esc=y&amp;f=false Read online here]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''[https://archive.org/stream/beyondgoodandevi00nietuoft/beyondgoodandevi00nietuoft_djvu.txt Beyond Good and Evil]'', 36, tr. H. Zimmern.&lt;/ref&gt; To exist is to represent will to power, to ''cause influence'' (compare similar views of Protagoras' disciples in Plato's ''Theaetetus''). One can cause influence only on something that exists. Therefore, (through induction) an act changes everything from that moment onwards. If one thing was otherwise, everything would have to be otherwise (and generally also backwards).&lt;ref name="TI_humanact"&gt;This belief, perhaps not 100% deterministic, is explicitly expressed in ''Twilight of the Idols'', "Morality as Anti-Nature", 6, tr. W. Kaufmann &amp;amp; R.J. Hollingdale: "To say to him, &amp;laquo;Change yourself!&amp;raquo; is to demand that everything be changed, even retroactively."&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to [[G. K. Chesterton|Chesterton]]'s views, this general rule is not precluded even by absolute chances: they of course change the course of the world too, but still: if one thing was set otherwise, everything would have to be otherwise.&lt;ref name="TI_humanact"/&gt;

Several scholars have argued that Nietzsche was not a determinist in his views of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Robert C. Solomon, ''The Journal of Nietzsche Studies'' 23 (2002), p. 64 ("Nietzsche on Freedom and Fatalism"). [https://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/journal_of_nietzsche_studies/v023/23.1solomon.html Online text here]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Leiter|B. Leiter]], ''Nietzsche on morality'' (2nd edition), Routledge 2015, p. 66. [https://books.google.com/books?id=hBDEBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA66&amp;f=false Online text here]
&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Zarathustra'', absolute randomness (maybe not as the essence of reality, but as a part thereof) can be thought of, yes, perhaps it even exists:

{{Quotation|Verily, it is a blessing and not a blasphemy when I teach that "above all things there standeth the heaven of chance, the heaven of innocence, the heaven of hazard, the heaven of wantonness.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.org/stream/beyondgoodandevi00nietuoft/beyondgoodandevi00nietuoft_djvu.txt Thus spake Zarathustra]'', "Before sunrise", tr. T. Common.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Issues of responsibility and morality===
Because ''causa sui'' is according to Nietzsche a nonsense, even to a chance could get a basis attributed (only "the whole" has no basis), and it would be "divine dice" (or "Divine Plan"):

::If ever I have played dice with the gods at the divine table of the earth, so that the earth quaked and ruptured, and snorted forth fire-streams: &amp;ndash;
::&amp;ndash; For a divine table is the earth, and trembling with new active dictums and dice-casts of the gods: (...)&lt;ref name=TSZ3/&gt;

To Nietzsche no one is responsible either for the necessities (laws and powers) he represents, or for chances he encounters (which conquer him unwillingly &amp;ndash; and which, as things totally independent from anything, only the "supreme being" could change); after all, no one is absolutely and completely resistant, there can always happen something which changes one deeply enough.

From ''The Dawn of Day'':

{{Quotation|To tranquillise the sceptic. &amp;ndash; "I don't know at all what I am doing. I don't know in the least what I ought to do!" You are right, but 
be sure of this: you are being done at every moment! Mankind has at all times mistaken the active for the passive: it is its eternal grammatical blunder.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.org/stream/dawnofday029675mbp/dawnofday029675mbp_djvu.txt The Dawn of Day]'', 120, tr. J. M. Kennedy.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''Twilight of the Idols'' Nietzsche discusses [[fatalism]] and responsibility in these words:

{{Quotation|What alone can our teaching be? &amp;ndash; That no one gives a man his qualities, neither God, nor society, nor his parents and ancestors, nor ''he himself'' (the latter absurd idea here put aside has been taught as "intelligible freedom" by Kant, perhaps also by Plato). &lt;u&gt;''No one'' is responsible for existing at all&lt;/u&gt;, for being formed so and so, for being placed under those circumstances and in this environment. His own destiny cannot be disentangled from the destiny of all else in past and future. He is ''not'' the result of a special purpose, a will, or an aim, the attempt is ''not'' here made to reach an "ideal of man," an "ideal of happiness," or an "ideal of morality;" &amp;ndash; &lt;u&gt;it is absurd to try to ''shunt off'' man's nature towards some goal&lt;/u&gt;. We have invented the notion of a "goal:" in reality a goal is ''lacking'' . . . We are necessary, we are part of destiny, we belong to the whole, we ''exist'' in the whole, &amp;ndash; &lt;u&gt;there is nothing which could judge, measure, compare, or condemn our being, for that would be to judge, measure, compare, and condemn the whole&lt;/u&gt; . . . ''But there is nothing outside the whole! &amp;ndash; This only is the grand emancipation'': that no one be made responsible any longer, that the mode of being be not traced back to a ''causa prima'', that the world be not regarded as a unity, either as sensorium or as "spirit;" &amp;ndash; it is only thereby that the ''innocence'' of becoming is again restored . . . The concept of "God" has hitherto been the greatest ''objection'' to existence . . . We deny God, we deny responsibility by denying God: it is only ''thereby'' that we save the world. &amp;ndash;&lt;ref name="TI_fw"&gt;''[http://www.forgottenbooks.com/readbook_text/The_Case_of_Wagner_v11_1000198930/165 Twilight of the Idols] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303214453/http://www.forgottenbooks.com/readbook_text/The_Case_of_Wagner_v11_1000198930/165 |date=2016-03-03 }}'', "The Four Great Errors", 8, tr. T. Common.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Free will as a psychological error===
Nietzsche's critique of free will has essentially two aspects: one is philosophical (fatalistic), and the other is psychological.&lt;ref name="NTotW"&gt;[[Brian Leiter|B. Leiter]], ''Nietzsche's Theory of the Will'', p. 1. [[Philosophers' Imprint]] v. 7, no. 7, September 2007. [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/p/pod/dod-idx/nietzsche-s-theory-of-the-will.pdf?c=phimp;idno=3521354.0007.007 Online text here]&lt;/ref&gt; Fatalism lets Nietzsche theoretically prove the error of moral doctrines, which &amp;ndash; most generally speaking &amp;ndash; would require that a sinner changed his destiny (for instance by changing the laws of nature, influencing chances which lie completely beyond the extent of his influence), which is by definition impossible. But such theory would not be convincing enough if at the same time the impression of control was not removed, as well as the ever renewed attempts at associating it with the "freedom of will" and building a philosophy out of that. Thus a psychological critique is needed.

If one agrees that the "freedom of will" denotes the power of will which rules but is not itself ruled, then it would at bottom be enough to prove that it is not will what governs human behaviour in order to abolish the very term, to prove that "it is not there". And Nietzsche went on to this.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'' (Leiter), p. 12 ("The Real Genesis of Action").&lt;/ref&gt; For Nietzsche the term "will" is psychologically strictly connected with the term "aim" (he often combines the two), maybe even they are identical to him.&lt;ref name="WTP"&gt;Cf. ''The Will to Power'', Book II ("Critique of highest values hitherto"), I. Critique of philosophy, 238: on "psychology which ... searched for will (i.e. aim) behind every act."&lt;/ref&gt; Aim could then be interpreted, according to a common definition, as planning and intellectual foreseeing&lt;ref&gt;The intellect in philosophy was by the way usually presented as working causally and, in principle, learning in course of life to associate the appropriate causes and effects. It was thus understood e.g. by Schopenhauer (cf. F. C. White, ''On Schopenhauer's Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason'', c. 4: "Perception," p. 42: Brill Academic Pub, 1991; [https://books.google.com/books?id=95X3LSZ9O04C&amp;pg=PA42&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Z4t8t3huF0&amp;sig=_yZNYjtOD8g49uNcKKxGql5cn9w&amp;hl=pl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=o7gTVOfLEcvTPI_TgLgE&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false read online]). The more thus the phenomena of will and aim would have a deterministic foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; (of especially effects); according to Nietzsche first and foremost the anticipation of acts which in fact do not need to follow by its virtue from aiming (which is here foreseeing).

In ''Twilight of the Idols'' Nietzsche demonstrates the ''error of false causality'' just before the ''error of free will'':

{{Quotation|Of these "inward facts" that seem to demonstrate causality, the primary and most persuasive one is that of &lt;u&gt;the will as cause&lt;/u&gt;. The idea of consciousness ("spirit") or, later, that of the ego ''[I]'' (the "subject") as a cause are only afterbirths: first the causality of the will was firmly accepted as proved, as a fact, and these other concepts followed from it. But we have reservations about these concepts. &lt;u&gt;Today we no longer believe any of this is true&lt;/u&gt;. (...) The so-called motives: another error. &lt;u&gt;Merely a surface phenomenon of consciousness, something shadowing&lt;ref&gt;"Accompanying" in original.&lt;/ref&gt; the deed&lt;/u&gt; that is more likely to hide the causes of our actions than to reveal them. (...)&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.handprint.com/SC/NIE/GotDamer.html Twilight of the Idols]'', "The Four Great Errors", 3, tr. W. Kaufmann &amp;amp; R.J. Hollingdale.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

and then, in the section directly regarding free will, he observes:

{{Quotation|Men were considered "free" only so that they might be considered guilty &amp;ndash; could be judged and punished: consequently, &lt;u&gt;every act had to be considered as willed, and the origin of every act had to be considered as lying within the consciousness&lt;/u&gt; (and thus the most fundamental psychological deception was made the principle of psychology itself).&lt;ref&gt;There, sect. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Similarly in ''The Antichrist'': "the will no longer &amp;laquo;acts,&amp;raquo; or &amp;laquo;moves&amp;raquo;...", "the term no longer denotes any power".&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19322/19322-h/19322-h.htm#THE_ANTICHRIST The Antichrist]'', 14, tr. H. L. Mencken. The latter is a mistranslation by Mencken (in original: ''kein Vermögen mehr verstanden werden darf'').&lt;/ref&gt; This non-deriving of acts straight way out of aims, which are just foreseeing (the accompanying self-consciousness of that what is to come), but searching for their sources elsewhere (for example in reflexes, habits, urges) is to Nietzsche even one of major differences between medieval (Thomist) and modern psychology.&lt;ref name="WTP"/&gt;

Nietzsche's words turned out to be prophetic,&lt;ref name="NTotW"/&gt; for [[Free will#Neurophilosophy|modern neuroscience]], especially the famous Libet's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1093/brain/106.3.623 | last1 = Libet | first1 = B. | last2 = Gleason | first2 = C.

The authors affirmed a kind of naturalistic, [[compatibilism|compatibilistic]] free will.&lt;/ref&gt;) experiment and other of this type, has not once confirmed that the decision for an act is made beyond the (self)consciousness (in popular words, the will), which comes up to even half a second later.

==Nietzsche's conclusions==

===About man and freedom===
In ''The Antichrist'' Nietzsche argues that man should be considered no otherwise than as a machine.&lt;ref name="A14"/&gt; Even if some generic chaos (randomness) is added to the picture, it does not affect this. A chance is innocent.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19322/19322-h/19322-h.htm#THE_ANTICHRIST The Antichrist]'', 25, tr. H. L. Mencken "Chance robbed of its innocence; unhappiness polluted with the idea of “sin”; well-being represented  as a danger, as a “temptation”; a physiological disorder produced by the canker worm of conscience....".&lt;/ref&gt;

Nietzsche points out the weakness of human as well as of God. Man wills the good, "God" wills the good, and yet evil happens.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/n/nietzsche/friedrich/n67j/book5.html The Gay Science]'', 346, tr. T. Common. "We have become saturated with the conviction (and have grown cold and hard in it) that things are not at all divinely ordered in this world, nor even according to human standards do they go on rationally, mercifully, or justly: we know the fact that the world in which we live is ungodly, immoral, and &amp;laquo;inhuman&amp;raquo;, (...)".&lt;/ref&gt; So where is this "freedom" (i.e. power) of will? And where is this good God?&lt;ref&gt;In ''Ecce Homo'', "Why I am so wise", 3, tr. Duncan Large he repeated after Stendhal: "God's only excuse is that he doesn't exist." Due to the lack of free will the [[theodicee]] (defence of divine goodness) based on indeterminism becomes void.&lt;/ref&gt;

===About good and evil===
These two human valuations refer to things essentially mixed with each other and interdependent. Good causes the evil, and evil causes the good.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. "[http://www.thenietzschechannel.com/works-pub/bge/bgefhm.htm The Aftersong]" in ''Beyond Good and Evil'' or "[https://archive.org/stream/thusspakezarathu01998gut/spzar10.txt The Seven Seals]", 4 in ''Zarathustra''.&lt;/ref&gt; The dichotomy between a good God and an evil satan is a "dualistic fiction."&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19322/19322-h/19322-h.htm#THE_ANTICHRIST The Antichrist]'', 17, tr. H. L. Mencken.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Twilight of the Idols'' (see the quote above) and later in ''The Antichrist''&lt;ref name="A2638"&gt;''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19322/19322-h/19322-h.htm#THE_ANTICHRIST The Antichrist]'', 26 &amp;amp; 38 about the moral order of the world.&lt;/ref&gt; all concepts which explain life as a test or raise an (externally reasonable) moral "task," "purpose" or the "will of God" are considered false. They are a part of the "error of free will"&lt;ref name="TI_fw"/&gt; consisting in incomprehension of [[fatalism|fatalism of life]], i.e. the fact that it is shaped by higher forces.

===About organized religion===
Religion is a form of controlling people:&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19322/19322-h/19322-h.htm#THE_ANTICHRIST The Antichrist]'', 38. "We know, our conscience now knows &amp;ndash; just what the real value of all those sinister inventions of priest and church has been and what ends they have served, with their debasement of humanity to a state of self-pollution, the very sight of which excites loathing, &amp;ndash; the concepts &amp;laquo;the other world,&amp;raquo; &amp;laquo;the last judgment,&amp;raquo; &amp;laquo;the immortality of the soul,&amp;raquo; the &amp;laquo;soul&amp;raquo; itself: they are all merely so many instruments of torture, systems of cruelty, whereby the priest becomes master and remains master..."&lt;/ref&gt; one man-machine wants to achieve power over another. Even the term "freedom," very often used by theologians, in its positive sense actually means "power."&lt;ref name="OFW"/&gt; Religion is by no means more "fulfilling the will of God" than anything else. As God is primary and almighty, his will is by definition always fulfilled (it is impossible that he wills something and it is not fulfilled).

A priest, a moralist does in fact nothing for man's "salvation," but just rules, and even when doing so he acts in a way that would (apart from that) be considered immoral.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.handprint.com/SC/NIE/GotDamer.html Twilight of the Idols]'', "The &amp;laquo;Improvers&amp;raquo; of Mankind", tr. W. Kaufmann and R.J. Hollingdale.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nietzsche goes on to analysing the [[Bible]] philologically and to guesses about the person of [[Jesus]]. He claims that it was not the aim of the latter to have anybody serve him, for God rules everything anyway; to the contrary, in Nietzsche's opinion Jesus fought with churchedness and the notion of sin rooted in the Old Testament. And thus in ''The Antichrist'' Christianity was portrayed as the corruption of the original doctrine taught by Jesus about equal rights of all to be children of God, the doctrine of no guilt and of no gulf between God and man.

The very "freedom of will" was invented by the priests in order to master the process of human thinking &amp;ndash; and nothing more.&lt;ref name="TI_fw"/&gt; And in order to master it, they had first to denaturize it.&lt;ref name="A2638"/&gt;

===About death of God and nihilism===
The downfall of Christian values is not an effect &amp;ndash; as it has been presented hitherto &amp;ndash; of human free will. The supreme values (especially formerly common in European culture) overthrow each other themselves&lt;ref name="gmfall"&gt;''[http://home.sandiego.edu/~janderso/360/genealogy3.htm On the Genealogy of Details] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010153350/http://home.sandiego.edu/~janderso/360/genealogy3.htm |date=2014-10-10 }}'', treatise III, 27, tr. W. Kaufmann.&lt;/ref&gt; due to inner contradictions&lt;ref&gt;For instance, Nietzsche often quotes, as children of Christianity, honest research (as willing the truth), as well as democratism (as derived from the belief in equality of souls before God, that is: the moral law, and unbelief in a "higher man", so essentially from pacifistic and equalistic tendencies), freedom of press (or speech in general) and so on.&lt;/ref&gt; and non-matching the nature.

{{Quotation|All great things destroy themselves by an act of self-cancellation. That's what the law of life wills, that law of the necessary "self-overcoming" in the essence of life &amp;ndash; eventually the call always goes out to the lawmaker himself, "''patere legem, quam ipse tulisti''" [submit to the law which you yourself have established]. That’s the way Christianity was destroyed as dogma by its own morality; that’s the way Christendom as morality must now also be destroyed. We stand on the threshold of this event.&lt;ref name="gmfall"/&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5514">'''Geographical features''' are naturally-created features of the Earth. Natural geographical features consist of [[landform]]s and [[ecosystem]]s. For example, terrain types,  physical factors of the environment) are natural geographical features. Conversely, [[human settlement]]s or other engineered forms are considered types of artificial geographical features.

==Natural geographical features==
===Ecosystems ===
{{main|Ecosystem}}
There are two different terms to describe habitats: ecosystem and biome. An ecosystem is a community of organisms interacting with its environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Odum|first1=Eugene P.|authorlink1=Eugene Odum|last2=Odum|first2=Howard T.|authorlink2=Howard Thomas Odum|title=Fundamentals of Ecology|date=1971|publisher=[[Saunders (imprint)|Saunders]]|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[biomes]] occupy large areas of the globe and often encompass many different kinds of geographical features, including [[mountain range]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Botkin|first1=Daniel B.|last2=Keller|first2=Edward A.|title=Environmental Science: Earth as a Living Planet|date=1995|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biotic diversity within an ecosystem is the variability among living organisms from all sources, including ''[[inter alia]]'', terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Convention Text — Article 2. Use of Terms|url=https://www.cbd.int/convention/articles/default.shtml?a=cbd-02|website=www.CBD.int|publisher=Convention on Biological Diversity|accessdate=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Living organism]]s are continually engaged in a set of relationships with every other element constituting  the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] in which they exist, and ecosystem describes any situation where there is relationship between organisms and their environment.

Biomes represent large areas of ecologically similar [[Community (ecology)|communities]] of [[plants]], [[animals]], and soil organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Basak|first1=Anindita|title=Environmental Studies|date=2009|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|isbn=978-81-317-2118-6|page=288|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yElrhPSIq-wC&amp;pg=PA288&amp;lpg=PA288&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5kosDjw1GB&amp;sig=sEgYEQI_FrGmo8FSbGx2PrjlT_A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X#v=onepage&amp;q=%22geographically-defined%20area%20of%20ecologically%20similar%20communities%20of%20plants%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biomes are defined based on factors such as plant structures (such as trees, shrubs, and grasses), leaf types (such as broadleaf and needleleaf), plant spacing (forest, woodland, savanna), and climate. Unlike [[ecozones]], biomes are not defined by genetic, taxonomic, or historical similarities. Biomes are often identified with particular patterns of [[ecological succession]] and [[climax vegetation]].

== Landforms ==
{{main|Landform}}
A landform comprises a [[geomorphology|geomorphological]] unit and is largely defined by its surface form and location in the landscape, as part of the [[terrain]], and as such is typically an element of [[topography]].  Landforms are categorized by features such as elevation, slope, orientation, [[stratum|stratification]], rock exposure, and soil type. They include [[berm]]s, mounds, hills, [[cliffs]], [[valleys]], [[rivers]], and numerous other elements.  [[Oceans]] and [[continents]] are the highest-order landforms.

A '''body of water''' is any significant accumulation of water, usually covering the Earth. The term "body of water" most often refers to [[ocean]]s, [[sea]]s, and [[lake]]s, but it may also include smaller pools of water such as [[pond]]s, [[creek (tidal)|creeks]] or [[wetland]]s. [[River]]s, [[stream]]s, [[canal]]s, and other geographical features where water moves from one place to another are not always considered bodies of water, but they are included as geographical formations featuring water.

== Artificial geographical features ==
=== Settlement ===
{{main|Human settlement}}
A settlement is a permanent or temporary [[community]] in which people live. Settlements range in components from a small number of dwellings grouped together to the largest of cities with surrounding urbanized areas. Other landscape features such as roads, enclosures, field systems, boundary banks and ditches, ponds, parks and woods, mills, manor houses, moats, and churches may be considered part of a settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MSRG Policy Statement|url=http://medieval-settlement.com/about/policy/|website=Medieval-Settlement.com|publisher=Medieval Settlement Research Group|accessdate=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Engineered constructs ===
{{main|Construction engineering|Building|Nonbuilding structure}}
{{See also|Infrastructure}}
Engineered geographic features include [[highway]]s, [[bridge]]s, [[airport]]s, [[railroad]]s, [[building]]s, [[dam]]s, and [[reservoir (water)|reservoirs]], and are part of the [[anthroposphere]] because they are man-made geographic features.

== Cartographic features ==
{{main|Cartography|Map}}
Cartographic features are types of abstract geographical features, which appear on maps but not on the planet itself, even though they are located on the planet. For example, the [[Equator]] is shown on maps of the Earth, but it does not physically exist. It is a theoretical line used for reference, navigation, and measurement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6148">'''Globe Award''' is an international [[sustainability]] award which aims at encouraging and promoting the corporate and public sector, individual scientists as well as groups of innovator that have excelled in sustainable development in the world. Globe Award is a not-for-profit organisation with focuses on fostering sustainability in societies. Globe Award’s main goal boils down to inspire actors to take responsibility and act globally through awarding great cases within research, innovations, municipalities and companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globeaward.org/ |title=Home |publisher=Globe Award |date= |accessdate=2012-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The award is handed out in 4 categories: ''Sustainability Research, Sustainability Innovation, Sustainable City'' and ''Sustainability Reporting''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globeaward.org/globe_award_2011 |title=2011 |publisher=Globe Award |date= |accessdate=2012-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Globe Award values==

1. ''Sustainable development''

Driving sustainability by recognising and awarding sustainability champions from around the world is crucial. This is about understanding the consequences of nowadays’s activities and believing in global collaboration to reach solutions to safeguard humanity’s welfare today and in the future.

2. ''Impact''

It is significant to create behavioural change through rewording unique solutions that can be implemented in order to make a change.

3. ''Transparency''

The Globe Award jury groups run the selection process equally independently.

4. ''Innovation''

Honouring tomorrow's leaders develops innovative solutions to the world’s sustainability challenges. Innovative business perspectives are considered as well as people, planet and profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globeaward.org/about-globe-award |title=About |publisher=Globe Award |date= |accessdate=2012-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The noted and internationally recognized 4 groups of jury consist of experts in sustainability from all over the world. They select one winner in each category independently and on objective grounds. There is the over-all jury chairman who along with the Globe Award secretariat, keeps that the process and selection of applications is obeyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globeaward.org/jury |title=Jury 2011 |publisher=Globe Award |date= |accessdate=2012-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Globe Award is an initiative by Globe Forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globeforum.com/ |title=Start2011 |publisher=GlobeForum |date= |accessdate=2012-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

When started in 2007, Globe Award was a Swedish CSR Award. After two years of success in Sweden, Globe Forum decided to go further with Globe Award. Struggling in making a difference and increasing awareness towards sustainable development in all societies, it made sense in creating Globe Award a truly global prize focusing on sustainability, instead of CSR, starting from 2009.
The award ceremony takes place annually in [[Stockholm]]. The initiative is supported by H.R.H. [[Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden]].
Despite the world-wide edition, there was a national edition in [[Poland]]. It took place in Gdansk in 2009. The Globe Award Polish Edition was handed out in two categories: Sustainability Innovation and Sustainable City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globeaward.org/polish_edition/en/about.html |title=About |publisher=Globe Award |date= |accessdate=2012-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Goddard Institute for Space Studies''' ('''GISS''')  is a laboratory in the Earth Sciences Division of NASA's [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] and a unit of the [[The Earth Institute|Columbia University Earth Institute]].&lt;ref name=columbia&gt;
{{NASA
|article=Overview
|url=http://www.giss.nasa.gov/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institute is located at [[Columbia University]] in New York City.

Research at the GISS emphasizes a broad study of Global Change; the natural and anthropogenic changes in our environment that affect the habitability of our planet. These effects may occur on greatly differing time scales, from one-time forcings such as volcanic explosions, to seasonal/annual effects such as [[El Niño]], and on up to the millennia of ice ages.

The institute's research combines analysis of comprehensive global datasets, (derived from surface stations combined with satellite data for SSTs), with global models of atmospheric, land surface, and oceanic processes. Study of past climate change on Earth and of other planetary atmospheres provides an additional tool in assessing our general understanding of the atmosphere and its evolution.&lt;ref name=gsss&gt;{{NASA

GISS was established in May 1961 by [[Robert Jastrow]] to do basic research in space sciences in support of Goddard programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

But even before it opened, the institute had been referred to in the press as the Goddard Institute for Space Studies.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; It was separated from the Theoretical Division in July 1962. Its offices were originally located in [[The Interchurch Center]], and the institute moved into Columbia's Armstrong Hall (formerly the Ostend apartments and then the Oxford Residence Hotel) in April 1966.

From 1981 to 2013, GISS was directed by [[James E. Hansen]]. In June 2014, [[Gavin A. Schmidt]] was named the institute's third director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/news/20140609/ |title=NASA Names Schmidt Director of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of scientific research ==

In the 1960s, GISS was a frequent center for high-level scientific workshops, including the "History of the Earth’s Crust Symposium" in November 1966 which has been described as the meeting that gave birth to the idea of [[plate tectonics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://eos.org/features/meeting-gave-birth-idea-global-tectonics| title=Meeting gave birth to the idea of global tectonics}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a GISS workshop in 1967, [[John Archibald Wheeler|John Wheeler]] popularized the term "[[black hole]]" as a short-hand for 'gravitionally completely collapsed star', though the term was not coined there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/topicalwords/tw-bla1.htm|title=World Wide Words: Black Hole|website=World Wide Words|accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1974, at a seminal meeting led by [[Patrick Thaddeus]] at GISS with [[John C. Mather|John Mather]] (his then post-doc) and others discussions began on the possibility of building a satellite to measure both the spectrum and possible spatial fluctuations of the Cosmic Microwave Background. This led directly to the [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]] satellite project and a [[Nobel Prize]] for Mather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-017-0170 | title=Patrick Thaddeus}} Nature Astronomy 1, 2017, doi:10.1038/s41550-017-0170&lt;/ref&gt;

== Climate change research ==
A key objective of Goddard Institute for Space Studies research is prediction of climate change in the 21st century. The research combines paleogeological record, analysis of comprehensive global datasets (derived mainly from spacecraft observations), with global models of atmospheric, land surface, and oceanic processes.

Climate science predictions are based substantially on historical analysis of Earth's paleoclimate (climate through geological ages), and the sea-level/ temperature/ carbon dioxide record.

Changes in carbon dioxide associated with continental drift, and the decrease in volcanism as India arrived at the Asian continent, allowed temperatures to drop &amp; Antarctic ice-sheets to form. This resulted in a 75m drop in sea level, allowing our present-day coastlines &amp; habitats to form and stabilize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franklin-live.net/site/20110512DrJamesHansen.php|title=James Hansen, public lecture 12th May 2011|publisher=|accessdate=14 January 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515102527/http://www.franklin-live.net/site/20110512DrJamesHansen.php|archivedate=15 May 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Global change studies at GISS are coordinated with research at other groups within the Earth Sciences Division, including the Laboratory for Atmospheres, Laboratory for Hydrospheric and Biospheric Sciences, and Earth Observing System science office.

[[File:PanandDaphnis.jpg|right|thumb|[[Pan (god)|Pan]] teaching his eromenos, the shepherd Daphnis, to play the pipes, 2nd century AD Roman copy of Greek original c. 100 BC, found in Pompeii]]
Deities depicted with horns or antlers are found in many different religions across the world.

==Horned goddess Hathor==
{{Main|Hathor}}
[[File:MekauraHeldByGoddessHathor MuseumOfFineArtsBoston.png|thumb|right|Close-up of a triad statue depicting the pharaoh Mekaura being held by the goddess [[Hathor]].]]
Hathor is commonly depicted as a cow goddess with head horns in which is set a sun disk with [[Uraeus]]. Twin feathers are also sometimes shown in later periods as well as a {{not a typo|menat}} necklace. Hathor may be the cow goddess who is depicted from an early date on the Narmer Palette and on a stone urn dating from the 1st dynasty that suggests a role as sky-goddess and a relationship to Horus who, as a sun god, is "housed" in her.
{{Main|Hathor#Relationships, associations, images and symbols}}
Hathor had a complex relationship with [[Ra]], in one myth she is his [[eye of Ra|eye]] and considered his daughter but later, when Ra assumes the role of Horus with respect to Kingship, she is considered Ra's mother. She absorbed this role from another cow goddess 'Mht wrt' ("Great flood") who was the mother of Ra in a creation myth and carried him between her horns. As a mother she gave birth to Ra each morning on the eastern horizon and as wife she conceives through union with him each day.
{{Main|Bat (goddess)}}
Bat was a cow goddess in [[Egyptian mythology]] depicted as a human face with cow ears and horns. By the time of the Middle Kingdom her identity and attributes were subsumed within the goddess Hathor. The worship of Bat dates to earliest times and may have its origins in Late Paleolithic cattle herding. Bat was the chief goddess of Seshesh, otherwise known as Hu or Diospolis Parva, the 7th nome of Upper Egypt.
The imagery of Bat as a divine cow was remarkably similar to that of Hathor the parallel goddess from Lower Egypt. The significant difference in their depiction is that Bat's horns curve inward and Hathor's curve outward slightly. It is possible that this could be based in the different breeds of cattle herded at different times.

==Cult of the bull deities==

{{main|Bull (mythology)#Egypt}}
In Egypt, the bull was worshiped as [[Apis (Egyptian mythology)|Apis]], the embodiment of [[Ptah]] and later of [[Osiris]]. A long series of ritually perfect bulls were identified by the god's priests, housed in the temple for their lifetime, then embalmed and encased in a giant [[sarcophagus]]. A long sequence of monolithic stone sarcophagi were housed in the [[Serapeum]], and were rediscovered by [[Auguste Mariette]] at [[Saqqara]] in 1851. The bull was also worshipped as [[Mnevis]], the embodiment of [[Atum-Ra]], in [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]].  ''Ka'' in Egyptian is both a religious concept of life-force/power and the word for bull.
{{main|Mnevis}}
Mnevis was identified as being a living bull. This may be a vestige of the sacrifice of kings after a period of reign, who were seen as the sons of [[Bat (goddess)|Bat]] or [[Hathor]] (see:[[Horned deity#Horned goddess Hathor|horned goddess Hathor]]), the ancient cow deity of the early solar cults. Thus, seen as a symbol of the later sun god, Ra, the Mnevis was often depicted, in [[art]], with the solar disc of their mother, Hathor between its horns.
[[File:Isis Enthroned-Egyptian-650-BCE.jpg|thumb|left|[[Isis]] with horns]]{{main|Bull (mythology)#Levant}}
The [[Canaan]]ite deity [[Moloch]] (according to the bible) was often depicted as a bull, and became a bull demon in [[Abrahamic]] traditions. The bull is familiar in [[Judeo-Christian]] cultures from the [[Biblical]] episode wherein an [[idolatry|idol]] of the [[Golden Calf]] is made by [[Aaron]] and worshipped by the Hebrews in the wilderness of Sinai (''[[Book of Exodus|Exodus]]'').  The text of the [[Hebrew Bible]] can be understood to refer to the idol as representing a separate god, or as representing the [[Yahweh|God of Israel]] himself, perhaps through an association or syncretization with Egyptian or [[Levant]]ine bull gods, rather than a new deity in itself.

[http://biblelexicon.org/exodus/32-4.htm Exodus 32:4] "He took this from their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool and made it into a molten calf; and they said, 'This is your god, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt'."

[http://biblelexicon.org/exodus/32-4.htm Nehemiah 9:18] "even when they made an idol shaped like a calf and said, 'This is your god who brought you out of Egypt!' They committed terrible blasphemies."

Calf-idols are referred to later in the Tanakh, such as in the Book of [http://bible.cc/hosea/10-5.htm Hosea], which would seem accurate as they were a fixture of near-eastern cultures.

[[King Solomon|King Solomon's]] "bronze sea"-basin stood on twelve brazen bulls, according to [http://bible.cc/1_kings/7-25.htm 1. Kings 7:25].

Young bulls were set as frontier markers at [[Tel Dan]] and at [[Bethel]] the frontiers of the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]].

==Ram deities in ancient Egypt==
[[File:Banebdjedet of Mendes.jpg|thumb|left|Banebdjedet]]
The ram was revered in [[ancient Egypt]] in matters of fertility and war. Early gods with long wavy ram horns include [[Khnum]] and the equivalent god in [[Lower Egypt]], [[Banebdjedet]], the "Ram Lord of Djedet" ([[Mendes]]), who was typically shown with four ram heads to represent the four souls (''[[Ba (Egyptian soul)|Ba]]'') of the sun god.&lt;ref name="pinch"/&gt; Banebdjedet may also be linked to the first four gods to rule over Egypt, [[Osiris]], [[Geb]], [[Shu (Egyptian deity)|Shu]] and [[Ra]]-[[Atum]], with large granite shrines devoted to each in the Mendes sanctuary. The ''[[Book of the Heavenly Cow]]'' describes the "Ram of Mendes" as being the Ba of Osiris, but this was not an exclusive association.&lt;ref name="pinch"&gt;''Handbook of Egyptian mythology'', Geraldine Pinch, p 114-115, Oxford University Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0-19-517024-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

List of Egyptian gods  associated with the ram:
* [[Khnum]] (one of the earliest Egyptian deities)
* [[Heryshaf]] (a ram god of [[Herakleopolis Magna|Heracleopolis]])
* [[Kherty]] (a variant of [[Aken (god)|Aken]], The chief deity in Egyptian mythology)
* [[Andjety]] (precursor of Osiris, Auf "Efu Ra").
* [[Horem Akhet]] (a god depicted as a [[sphinx]] with the head of a man, lion, or ram)
* [[Banebdjedet]] (ram god linked to the first four Egyptian gods: Osiris, Geb, Shu, Ra-Atum)
* [[Amun#Cult in Nubia, Libya, and Greece|Amun]] (the ram deity that inspired the cult of Ammon)

==Cult of Ammon==
{{Main|Amun#Cult in Nubia, Libya, and Greece}}
[[File:Museo Barracco - Giove Ammone 1010637.JPG|thumb|right|Roman cast terracotta of ram-horned Jupiter Ammon, 1st century AD (Museo Barracco, Rome)]]
The worship of Ammon was introduced into Greece at an early period, probably through the medium of the Greek colony in [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]], which must have formed a connection with the great oracle of Ammon in the Oasis soon after its establishment. Ammon had a temple and a statue, the gift of [[Pindar]], at Thebes,&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' ix.16 § 1&lt;/ref&gt; and another at [[Sparta]], the inhabitants of which, as [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] says,&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' iii.18 § 2&lt;/ref&gt; consulted the oracle of Ammon in Libya from early times more than the other Greeks. At [[Aphytis]], Chalcidice, Ammon was worshipped, from the time of [[Lysander]], as zealously as in Ammonium. Pindar the poet honoured the god with a hymn. At [[Megalopolis, Greece|Megalopolis]] the god was represented with the head of a ram (Paus. viii.32 § 1), and the Greeks of Cyrenaica dedicated at Delphi a chariot with a statue of Ammon.

Such was its reputation among the Classical Greeks that [[Alexander the Great]] journeyed there after the [[battle of Issus]] and during his occupation of Egypt, where he was declared ''the son of Amun'' by the oracle.  Alexander thereafter considered himself divine.  Even during this occupation, Amun, identified by these Greeks as a form of [[Zeus]],&lt;ref&gt;Jerem. xlvi.25&lt;/ref&gt; continued to be the principal local deity of Thebes.
{{Main|Berber mythology#Before the battle of Irassa (570 BC)}}
The Cyrenaican Greeks built temples for the Libyan god Amon instead of their original god [[Zeus]]. They later identified their supreme god [[Zeus]] with the Libyan Amon.&lt;ref&gt;Oric Bates, The Eastern Libyans.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of them continued worshipping Amon himself.
Amon's cult was so widespread among the Greeks that even [[Alexander the Great]] decided to be declared as the son of Zeus in the [[Siwa Oasis|Siwan]] temple by the Libyan priests of Amon.&lt;ref&gt;Mohammed Chafik, revue Tifinagh...&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:SFEC EGYPT KARNAK 2006-001.JPG|thumb|left|Ram statues line the entrance to Amun's Temple]]{{Main|Berber mythology#Amun as a common deity}}
Although the most modern sources ignored the existence of Amun in the Berber mythology, he was maybe the greatest ancient Berber god.&lt;ref&gt;H. Basset, Les influences puniques chez les Berbères, pp 367-368&lt;/ref&gt; He was honored by the Ancient Greeks in Cyrenaica, and was united with the Phoenician/Carthaginian god [[Baal-hamon]] due to Libyan influence.&lt;ref&gt;Mohammed Chafik, Revue Tifinagh...&lt;/ref&gt; Some depictions of the [[Sheep|ram]] across North Africa belong to the lythic period which is situated between [[9th millennium BC|9600 BC]] and 7500 BC. &lt;br /&gt;
The most famous Amun's temple in Ancient Libya was the temple at the oasis of [[Siwa Oasis|Siwa]].
The name of the ancient Berber tribes: ''[[Garamantes]]'' and ''Nasamonians'' are believed by some scholars to be related to the name ''Amon''.&lt;ref&gt;Helene Hagan, The Shining Ones: An Etymological Essay on the Amazigh Roots of the Egyptian civilization, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Main|Berber mythology#Solar and lunar worship}}
In Awelimmiden [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]], the name ''Amanai'' is believed to have the meaning of "[[God]]". The [[Ancient Libya]]ns may have worshipped the setting sun, which was personified by Amon, who was represented by the [[Sheep|ram]]'s [[Horn (anatomy)|horn]]s.&lt;ref&gt;James Hastings.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Main|Baʿal#Baʿal of Carthage}}
In Carthage and North Africa [[Baal-hamon]] was especially associated with the ram and was worshiped also as Baʿal Qarnaim ("Lord of Two Horns") in an open-air sanctuary at Jebel Bu Kornein ("the two-horned hill") across the bay from Carthage.
{{Main|Alexander the Great in the Qur'an#The two-horned one}}
[[File:Alexander-Coin.jpg|thumb|right|Silver tetradrachmon (ancient Greek coin) issued in the name of Alexander the Great, depicting Alexander with the horns of Ammon.]]

The [[Egyptian pantheon|Egyptian god]] [[Ammon-Ra]] was depicted with [[Sheep|ram]] horns. Rams were considered a symbol of [[virility]] due to their [[Rut (mammalian reproduction)|rutting]] behavior. The horns of Ammon may have also represented the East and West of the Earth, and one of the titles of [[Ammon]] was "the two-horned." Alexander was depicted with the horns of Ammon as a result of his conquest of [[ancient Egypt]] in 332 BC, where the priesthood received him as the son of the god Ammon, who was identified by the ancient Greeks with [[Zeus]], the [[King of the Gods]]. The combined [[deity]] Zeus-Ammon was a distinct figure in ancient Greek mythology. According to five historians of antiquity ([[Arrian]], [[Quintus Curtius Rufus|Curtius]], [[Diodorus]], [[Justin (historian)|Justin]], and [[Plutarch]]), Alexander visited the [[Oracle of Ammon]] at [[Siwa Oasis|Siwa]] in the [[Ancient Libya|Libyan]] desert and rumors spread that the Oracle had revealed Alexander's father to be the [[deity]] Ammon, rather than Philip.&lt;ref name=coin&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/124716/coin/15880/From-the-Persian-Wars-to-Alexander-the-Great-490-336-bc|title=Coin: from the Persian Wars to Alexander the Great, 490–336 bc|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=2009-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Green2007|Green 2007]]. p.382&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=plutarch&gt;Plutarch, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plut.+Caes.+27.1 ''Alexander'', 27]&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander styled himself as the son of Zeus-Ammon and even demanded to be worshiped as a god:

&lt;blockquote&gt;He seems to have become convinced of the reality of his own [[divinity]] and to have required its acceptance by others ... The cities perforce complied, but often ironically: the [[Sparta]]n decree read, '' 'Since Alexander wishes to be a god, let him be a god.' ''&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, Alexander III, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==By continent==

===Europe===
[[File:Cernunnos.jpg|left|thumb|Cernunnos on the [[Pillar of the Boatmen]]]]
[[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] was a god of shepherds and flocks, of mountain wilds and rustic music.

Depictions in [[Celtic polytheism|Celtic]] cultures of figures with antlers are often identified as [[Cernunnos]] ("horned one" in Latin). The prime evidence for this comes from a pillar in Paris which also features the Roman god [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]].&lt;ref&gt;Green, Miranda J. ''Animals in Celtic Life and Myth''. pp. 227–228&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cocidius]] was the name of a [[Romano-British]] war-god and local deity from the area around [[Hadrian's Wall]], who is sometimes represented as being horned.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Miranda J. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=km66Nu4d-34C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Symbol+and+Image+in+Celtic+Religious+Art&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Symbol and Image in Celtic Religious Art]''. p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; He is associated with warfare and woodland and was worshipped mostly by military personnel and the lower classes.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Todd, ''A Companion to Roman Britain'', P. 209&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Gundestrupkedlen- 00054 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|The horned figure on the [[Gundestrup Cauldron]].]]
[[Eliphas Levi]], the 18th century [[occult]]ist, believed that the pseudohistorical god ''[[Baphomet]]'' (that the [[Roman Catholic Church]] had claimed was worshipped by the heretical [[Knights Templar]]), was actually the horned Libyan oracle god (Ammon), or, the [[Goat of Mendes]].&lt;ref&gt;Witches: true encounters with wicca, wizards, covens, cults, and magick by Hans Holzer Page 125&lt;/ref&gt;
{{main|Gundestrup Cauldron#Origins}}
For many years scholars have interpreted the [[Gundestrup Cauldron]]'s images in terms of the Celtic pantheon. The antlered figure in plate A has been commonly identified as [[Cernunnos]].

===Africa===
[[File:Ikenga.svg|left|thumb|[[Ikenga]] Igbo]]
A ram-shaped oracle god whose name is unknown (Baal Hamon – Phoenician / Carthaginian ) was worshiped by Libyan tribes at Siwa. The figure was incorporated by the Egyptians into depictions of their god [[Amun]] that's considered an "[[Interpretatio graeca]]" of the Greek [[Zeus]]-Ammon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/am-ao/ammon/ammon.html|title=Oasis - Livius|website=www.livius.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adherents of [[Odinani]] (the traditional folk religion of the [[Igbo people]] of south-eastern [[Nigeria]]) worship the [[Ikenga]], a horned god of honest achievement, whose two horns symbolise self-will. Small wooden statues of him are made and praised as personal altars.&lt;ref&gt;Vernantius Emeka Ndukaihe, ''Achievement as Value in the Igbo/African Identity: The Ethics'' LIT Verlag, 2007

===Asia===
[[File:Shiva Pashupati.jpg|thumb|Indus god ''Pashupati'']]
The [[Pashupati seal]], a seal discovered during the excavation of [[Mohenjo-daro]] in [[Pakistan]] has drawn attention as a possible representation of a "proto-Shiva" figure.&lt;ref name="Flood 1996, pp. 28-29"&gt;Flood (1996), pp. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; This "[[Pashupati]]" (Lord of animal-like beings – Sanskrit ''{{IAST|paśupati}}'')&lt;ref&gt;For translation of ''{{IAST|paśupati}}'' as "Lord of Animals" see: Michaels, p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt; seal shows a seated figure with horns, possibly ithyphallic, surrounded by animals.&lt;ref&gt;For a drawing of the seal see Figure 1 ''in'': Flood (1996), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The depiction of a [[Moses (Michelangelo)#Horns|horned Moses]] stems from the description of [[Moses]]' face as "cornuta" ("horned") in the Latin [[Vulgate]] translation of the passage from Exodus in which Moses returns to the people after receiving the [[Ten Commandments]] for the second time. The [[Douay–Rheims Bible]] translates the Vulgate as, "And when Moses came down from the [[mount Sinai]], he held the two tables of the testimony, and he knew not that his face was horned from the conversation of the Lord."&lt;ref name=Mellinkoff1970&gt;Ruth Mellinkoff.

==Influence on demonology==

===Christian demonology===
{{main|Christian demonology#Appearance}}
The idea that demons have horns seems to have been taken from the [[Book of Revelation]] chapter 13. The book of Revelation seems to have inspired many depictions of demons. This idea has also been associated with the depiction of certain ancient gods like [[Moloch]] and the [[shedu]], etc., which were portrayed as bulls, as men with the head of a bull, or wearing bull horns as a crown.

===Baphomet of Mendes===
The satanic "horned god" symbol known as the [[baphomet]] is based on an [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian]] ram deity that was worshipped in [[Mendes]], called [[Banebdjed]] (literally [[Ancient Egyptian concept of the soul|Ba]] of the lord of [[djed]], and titled "the Lord of Mendes"), who was the soul of [[Osiris]]. According to ''Egyptian Mythology: A Guide to the Gods, Goddesses, and Traditions of ancient Egypt'', the book's author [[Geraldine Harris]], said the ram gods Ra-[[Amun]] (see: [[Horned deity#Cult of Ammon|Cult of Ammon]]), and Banebdjed, were to mystically unite with the [[Great Royal Wife|queen of Egypt]] to sire the heir to the throne (a theory based on depictions found in several Theban temples in Mendes).

Occultist [[Eliphas Levi]] in his ''[[Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie]]'' (1855), combined the images of the [[Tarot of Marseilles]]' [[The Devil (Tarot card)|Devil card]] and refigured the ram Banebdjed as a he-goat, calling it the "[[Baphomet]] of Mendes," (or, "Goat of Mendes"). The inaccurate description can be traced back to ''Herodotus' [[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]] Book II'', where [[Herodotus]] describes the deity of Mendes as having a goat's head and fleece, when Banebdjedet was really represented by a [[Sheep|ram]], not a [[goat]].
[[File:RWS Tarot 15 Devil.jpg|thumb|left|[[The Devil (Tarot card)|The Devil]] in the [[Rider-Waite Tarot deck]].]]{{Main|Baphomet#Aleister Crowley}}
The Baphomet of Lévi was to become an important figure within the cosmology of [[Thelema]], the mystical system established by [[Aleister Crowley]] in the early twentieth century.  Baphomet features in the Creed of the [[Gnostic Catholic Church]] recited by the congregation in ''[[The Gnostic Mass]]'', in the sentence: "And I believe in the Serpent and the Lion, Mystery of Mystery, in His name BAPHOMET" (see: [[Aleister Crowley#Occult|Aleister Crowley: Occult]]).
{{Main|Baphomet#As a demon}}
Lévi's Baphomet is the source of the later [[The Devil (Tarot card)|Tarot image of the Devil]] in the [[Rider-Waite tarot deck|Rider-Waite design]]. The concept of a downward-pointing [[pentagram]] on its forehead was enlarged upon by Lévi in his discussion (without illustration) of the Goat of Mendes arranged within such a pentagram, which he contrasted with the [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosmic man]] arranged within a similar but upright pentagram. The actual image of a goat in a downward-pointing pentagram first appeared in the 1897 book ''La Clef de la Magie Noire'' by [[Stanislas de Guaita]], later adopted as the official symbol—called the [[Sigil of Baphomet]]—of the [[Church of Satan]], and continues to be used among [[Satanism|Satanists]].

===Neopaganism===
{{main|Devil#Neopaganism}}[[File:Francisco de Goya y Lucientes - Witches' Sabbath - WGA10007.jpg|thumb|right|[[Francisco de Goya]]'s ''[[Witches' Sabbath (1789)|Witches Sabbat]]'' (1789), which depicts [[the Devil]] flanked by Satanic witches. The Witch Cult hypothesis states that such stories are based upon a real-life pagan cult that revered a horned god]]
Few neopagan reconstructionist traditions recognize Satan or the Devil outright.  However, many neopagan groups worship some sort of [[Horned God]], for example as a consort of the [[Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)|Great Goddess]] in [[Wicca]]. These gods usually reflect [[mythology|mythological]] figures such as [[Cernunnos]] or [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], and any similarity they may have to the Christian Devil seems to date back only to the 19th century, when a Christian reaction to Pan's growing importance in literature and art resulted in his image being translated to that of the Devil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hutton |first=Ronald |authorlink=Ronald Hutton |title=Triumph of the Moon |page=46 |year=1999 |publisher=Oxford UniverUniversity Press |location=Oxford |ISBN=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Baphomet.png|thumb|left|Image of a 19th-century Sabbatic Goat]]

===Witch-cult hypothesis===
{{main|Witch-cult hypothesis#Post-Murray}}
In 1985 Classical historian [[Georg Luck]], in his ''Arcana Mundi: Magic and the Occult in the Greek and Roman Worlds'', theorised that the origins of the Witch-cult may have appeared in late antiquity as a faith primarily designed to worship the Horned God, stemming from the merging of [[Cernunnos]], a horned god of the Celts, with the Greco-Roman [[Pan (god)|Pan]]/[[Faunus]],&lt;ref name="LuckArcana"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Gerog Luck |last=Luck |first=Georg |year=1985 |title=Arcana Mundi: Magic and the Occult in the Greek and Roman Worlds: A Collection of Ancient Texts. |location=Baltimore, MD |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; a combination of gods which he posits created a new deity, around which the remaining [[pagan]]s, those refusing to convert to Christianity, rallied and that this deity provided the prototype for later Christian conceptions of the [[Devil]], and his worshippers were cast by the Church as witches.&lt;ref name="LuckArcana" /&gt;

===Beelzebub===
[[File:Horned deity.jpg|thumb|right|Horned demon? (proto-Elamite 3000–2800 BC)]]
{{main|Christian teaching about the Devil#New Testament}}
There is an implied connection between Satan and [[Beelzebub]] (lit. ''Lord of the Flies''), originally a [[Semitic deity]] called [[Baal]] (lit. "lord"). Beelzebub is the most recognized demon in the Bible, whose name has become analogous to Satan. Occult and metaphysical author [[Michelle Belanger]] believes that Beelzebub (a mockery of the original name&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=498&amp;letter=B] Jewish Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt;) is the horned god Ba'al [[Hadad]], whose cult symbol was the bull.&lt;ref&gt;The Dictionary of Demons: Names of the Damned By Michelle Belanger -Page 56&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Encyclopedia of Witches, Witchcraft and Wicca'', Beelzebub reigned over the Witches' Sabbath ("synagoga"&lt;ref&gt;Witch hunts in the western world: persecution and punishment from the ... Page 87 - by Brian Alexander Pavlac&lt;/ref&gt;), and that witches denied Christ in his name and chanted "Beelzebub" as they danced.&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Witches, Witchcraft and Wicca'' by [[Rosemary Ellen Guiley]]. p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;
{{main|Beelzebub#Christian demonology and occult}}
Beelzebub was also imagined to be sowing his influence in Salem, Massachusetts: his name came up repeatedly during the [[Salem witch trials]], the last large-scale public expression of witch hysteria in North America or Europe, and afterwards Rev. [[Cotton Mather]] wrote a [[pamphlet]] entitled ''Of Beelzebub and his Plot.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020921203915/http://www.4literature.net/Cotton_Mather/Of_Beelzebub_and_His_Plot|title=Of Beelzebub and His Plot by Cotton Mather|date=21 September 2002|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neopaganism==
{{main|Horned God}}
In 1933, the Egyptologist [[Margaret Murray]] published the book, ''The God of the Witches'', in which she theorised that Pan was merely one form of a [[horned god]] who was worshipped across Europe by a [[Witch Cult hypothesis|witch-cult]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft'', [[Ronald Hutton]], page 199&lt;/ref&gt; This theory influenced the [[Neopaganism|Neopagan]] notion of the Horned God, as an [[archetype]] of male virility and sexuality. In [[Wicca]], the archetype of the Horned God is highly important, and is thought by believers to be represented by such deities as the Celtic [[Cernunnos]], Indian [[Pashupati]] and Greek Pan.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Horned God in Wiccan based neopagan religions represents a [[Solar deity|solar god]] often associated with [[vegetation deity|vegetation]], that's honored as the ''Holly King'' or ''Oak King'' in [[Neopagan]] rituals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://paganwiccan.about.com/od/yulethelongestnight/p/Holly_KIng_Yule.htm] The Legend of the Holly King and the Oak King
By Patti Wigington&lt;/ref&gt; Most often, the Horned God is considered a male [[List of fertility deities|fertility god]].&lt;ref&gt;The Quest: A Search for the Grail of Immortality by Rhuddlwm Gawr pg. 210&lt;/ref&gt; The use of horns as a symbol for power dates back to the ancient world. From ancient [[Egyptians|Egypt]] and the [[Ba'al]] worshipping [[Canaanite religion|Cannanites]], to the [[Greeks]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Celts]], and various other cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Myth and Territory in the Spartan Mediterranean by Irad Malkin pg. 159&lt;/ref&gt; Horns have ever been present in religious imagery as symbols of fertility and power.&lt;ref&gt;Wicca: The Complete Craft by Deanna J. Conway pg. 54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Language of God in the Universe by Helena Lehman pg. 301&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until Christianity attributed horns to [[Satan]] as part of his iconography that horned gods became associated with evil in Western mythology:&lt;ref&gt;The Devil: perceptions of evil from antiquity to primitive Christianity by Jeffrey Burton Russell pg. 245&lt;/ref&gt;

Many modern [[Neopaganism|neo-Pagans]] focus their worship on a horned god, or often "the" Horned God and one or more goddesses. Deities such as [[Pan (god)|Pan]] and [[Dionysus]] have had attributes of their worship imported into the [[Neopagan]] concept as have the Celtic [[Cernunnos]] and [[Gwynn ap Nudd]], one of the mythological leaders of the [[Wild Hunt]]&lt;ref&gt;Fabulous creatures, mythical monsters, and animal power symbols: a handbook by Cassandra Eason pg. 107&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia of Modern Witchcraft and Neo-Paganism By Shelley Rabinovitch, James Lewis pg. 133&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford companion to world mythology by David Adams Leeming pg. 360&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The outer temple of witchcraft: circles, spells, and rituals by Christopher Penczak  pg. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Henri Poincaré Institute''' (or '''IHP''' for '''''Institut Henri Poincaré''''') is a mathematics research institute part of [[Sorbonne University]], in association with the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique]] (CNRS). It is located in the [[5th arrondissement of Paris|5th arrondissement]] of [[Paris]], on the Sainte-Geneviève Hill, close to a number of other higher education institutions. 

==History==
Just after World War I, mathematicians [[Émile Borel]] in France and [[George Birkhoff]] in the United States persuaded American and French sponsors ([[Edmond de Rothschild]] and the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] respectively)&lt;ref&gt;Rockefeller and the internationalization of mathematics between two World Wars [Texte imprimé][: documents and studies for the social history of mathematics in the 20th century / Reinhard Siegmund-Schultze. - Basel ; Boston ; Berlin : Birkhäuser, cop. 2001. - 1 vol. (XIII-341 p.) : fig., ill., carte ; 24 cm. - (Science networks historical studies ; volume 25). - Bibliogr. p. [307]-318. Index. {{ISBN|3-7643-6468-8}} (rel.). - EAN 9783764364687 (rel.)]&lt;/ref&gt; to fund the building of a centre for lectures and international exchanges in mathematics and theoretical physics. The Institute was inaugurated on 17 November 1928 and named after French mathematician [[Henri Poincaré]] (1854-1912).

Right from the start, the institute's objective has been to promote mathematical physics, and it soon became a favourite meeting place for the French scientific community. In the 1990s, the IHP became a thematic institute modeled on Berkeley's [[Mathematical Sciences Research Institute]] (MSRI) and a place for contact making, exchange and diffusion of knowledge.

==Organization==
The IHP's governing board has about 25 members. There are no permanent researchers other than the director and the deputy director. Since 2009, the institute has been headed by mathematician [[Cédric Villani]] (director), Fields Medals laureate in 2010. The current deputy director is the French cosmologist Jean-Philippe Uzan. 

Together with the [[Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques]] (IHES), the [[Centre International de Rencontres Mathématiques]] (CIRM) and the [[Centre International de Mathématiques Pures et Appliquées]] (CIMPA) it is a member of the Carmin LabEx (Laboratory of Excellence), which aims at facilitating exchanges between mathematicians by building infrastructures for pooling skills and information.

[[File:Institut Henri Poincaré - UMS 839.jpg|thumb|vignette|upright=1.30|Main entrance of the Institute]]

==Scientific activities==
As a venue for national and international mathematical exchanges, the Institute organizes "thematic quarters" (three-month programmes on specific topics), intensive short-time collaborations, high-level PhD training courses, conferences and seminars in mathematics or related fields, such as physics, biology or computer science. Topics are selected  by the IHP's Scientific Steering Committee. The IHP welcomes around 11,000 mathematicians each year.

In 2013, the Institute launched the "Poincaré Chair", a research program designed to foster the international careers of talented young researchers. Numerous seminars or series of lectures take place at the IHP, such as the Bourbaki and Bourbaphy Seminars, the History of Mathematics Seminar, as well as some more specialised lectures in algebra, number theory, mathematical physics, elliptic curves ...

The institute also publishes three international scientific journals, the Annals of the Institut Henri Poincaré (Journal of Theoretical and Mathematical Physics, Probability and Statistics and Non Linear Analysis), with original advanced fundamental research articles. A fourth journal is under consideration.

==General public==
As a showcase for French mathematics, the Institute co-organises and sponsors numerous, scientific and cultural events aimed at a general public (2011 : Mathematics, a Beautiful Elsewhere at the Fondation Cartier ; 2011 : A tribute to Evariste Galois ; 2012 : Centenary of Henri Poincaré's Death...). it has close ties with the associations and societies for the promotion of mathematics housed in its premises.

==Mathematical designs==
The library of the Henri Poincaré institute holds a collection of some 400 mathematical models and designs that come in different materials: glass, plastic, cardboard,  wire, sewing thread on a rigid frame, plaster. This collection, which started with a donation by Martin Shilling, has been enhanced over the years, notably by wooden models built between 1912 and 1914 by lecturer Joseph Caron of the [[École Normale Supérieure]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16359">The '''international trade of fine art''' is most precisely defined as the trade across nations of unique, non-reproducible works by an artist.  The art trade contradicts typical international trade models since it is a culturally significant good.  It is not treated by consumers the same way any other commodity would because of the aesthetic value that is unique to each piece.  Despite existing as a finite physical piece, unique art is still considered intellectual property. This sparks the debate as to whether art exports should be restricted for nationalistic and cultural reasons, or liberalized for the sake of a healthier international market.

==Decorative art as a trade commodity==

The trade commodities included in the definition of "[[visual art]]" include the following: [[painting]], drawing, [[sculpture]] in various materials, [[printmaking]], [[photography]], maps, [[performance art]], [[installation art]], [[mail art]], [[assemblage art]], [[textile arts]], [[fashion design]], [[video art]], [[digital art]], and product design.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt; These works are non-functional, emotional, social, political, traditional, and cultural statements, and in comparison to other goods, are not greatly affected by commercial-sector constraints.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt; Though visual art is a physical, hand-made good, it is often culturally rooted and created for aesthetic appeal.  Therefore, art is considered [[intellectual property]].&lt;ref name="one" /&gt;

The 4-digit [[Standard International Trade Classification]] (SITC) classifies "Works of Art, Collectors Pieces and Antiques" under category 8960, which includes paintings, drawings, pastels, original sculptures, original prints, stamps, and antiques over 100 years old. This is the only SITC category that consists of unique, non-reproducible art, which is typically thought of as "fine" art.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; The 4-digit [[Harmonized System|harmonized commodity]] description and coding system, otherwise known as the harmonized system (HS) code for "fine" art is 9701, which is classified as "Paintings, Drawings and Pastels, Executed Entirely By Hand".&lt;ref name="three" /&gt;

==History of international art trade==

The earliest known regulation of cultural property dates to 1464, when [[Pope Pius II]] prohibited the exportation of works of art from the Papal States.&lt;ref name="four" /&gt; It wasn’t until the mid-1500s that any sizable amount of formal artwork was transferred between nations in licit markets.  Previously, local demand had satisfied the supply of artwork, but it couldn’t keep up as the number of artists increased.&lt;ref name="five" /&gt;  Consequently, artists exported their works to foreign markets.  Between 1540 and 1670, an average of 144 paintings per year were transported between the [[Netherlands]] and [[New Spain]].&lt;ref name="five" /&gt;

Throughout much of the [[early modern period]], if an artist could not domestically sell his art, he sold it instead to dealers who exported the works abroad.  Starting in the 17th Century, however, most art was traded at the massive auction houses of [[Christie's]] and [[Sotheby's]] of London, which both still survive today.&lt;ref name="five" /&gt;

Like any other traded good, art has been historically subjected to import duties.  For example, in the more enlightened years of the 19th Century, art escaped high tariffs in America because the government viewed art as an important cultural good.   At other times, though, tariff revenue was considered more important than free intellectual property.&lt;ref name="six" /&gt;

During [[World War II]], neutral [[Switzerland]] became the primary trafficker of art on the European continent.  Most "degenerate" works of art that the [[Nazi]] government purged from German museums were sold there, where they largely entered [[black markets]].  Since the war ended, there has been a massive, ongoing effort to recover all of these works.  For fifteen years following the war, 45,000 pieces were returned to France, mostly to Jewish owners.&lt;ref name="seven" /&gt;

Today, almost every country in the world has restrictions and regulations on the export of cultural property.&lt;ref name="four" /&gt;  Currently, most art auctions are facilitated on online sites such as [[eBay]] and [http://Lauritz.com/ Lauritz.com].&lt;ref name="five" /&gt;

==Economic theory of art trade==

Fine art proves complicated for economists to analyze, mostly because trade in unique art is in large part trade between consumers – the "secondary market" – rather than the "primary market" trade between the producer (artist) and the consumer.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;  For example, when a museum buys a sculpture from a private collector, the exchange is between two consumers and considered a transaction in the secondary market because neither of them produced the sculpture.  It is more complicated for economists, then, to capture these transactions in their data.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;

[[Comparative advantage]] is also more difficult to pinpoint in the case of cultural goods.   There is a certain degree of cultural nationalism of art,&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt; making some nations reluctant to part with their cultural property.  Additionally, relative advantage cannot simply be calculated by the [[marginal cost]] of producing a unit of art, since aesthetic value plays so heavily into its price.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;

Trade theory demonstrates how much and at what price countries trade goods if they have different endowments or different preferences.  But this model is not very useful because of retentive nationalism:&lt;ref name="nine" /&gt; a country that is relatively less endowed with art-producing resources will not stop producing simply because they can import art from abroad at cheaper prices.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;

===Determination of prices===

Traditional trade theory treats art as a homogenous, non-differentiated good, which is where it fails to reliably predict trade trends.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; Unique art is valued precisely because of its uniqueness.  Since each piece of art is different, and because each piece does not appear on the market very often, the determination of changes in market value prove difficult to determine.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;

Economists use the [[hedonic regression]] (HR) estimation method to calculate prices in art.  This is used to predict prices based on various attributes of the artwork such as its dimensions, the artist, and the subject matter attended to.&lt;ref name="ten" /&gt;

==Protectionism vs. Liberalization==
 
[[Protectionism]] is a nationalistic viewpoint that contends that a healthy cultural industry is necessary to assert national sovereignty and identity.&lt;ref name="eleven" /&gt;  Countries with small domestic markets are often overwhelmed by imports from larger markets in which producers can make up their costs of production by dumping content abroad.  America is the largest exporter of artwork in the world, and English speaking countries are especially vulnerable to American imports.&lt;ref name="three" /&gt; Protectionists view this as a modern form of American [[imperialism]], which reduces cultural diversity when national industries are unable to compete.&lt;ref name="eleven" /&gt;

Protectionism is less concerned with direct economic interest as it is with preserving cultural integrity.  Australian economist [[David Throsby]] argues that investment in "cultural capital" may be necessary for the sustainability of a culture.&lt;ref name="twelve" /&gt; [[Paul M. Bator]], who helped negotiate and draft the [[UNESCO]] convention on the International Trade of Art, argues that larger countries are responsible for the cultural interests of smaller ones.  He explains in ''The International Trade in Art'' that "art-rich countries should create tax and other financial and psychological incentives to persuade those with important antiquities and archaeological objects to keep them at home".&lt;ref name="four" /&gt;


Proponents of [[Economic liberalization|liberalization]] in international art markets stress that open markets contribute to efficient production and distribution of cultural products.&lt;ref name="eleven" /&gt; Reliance on competitive market forces also frees creative individuals from the hindrance of government oversight.&lt;ref name="eleven" /&gt;   Many special characteristics of cultural products – the lack of rivalry in content, [[economies of scale]], and [[economies of agglomeration|agglomeration economies]] – enhance the case for opening markets.  Protection raises rather than lowers domestic prices, which detracts from consumer welfare.&lt;ref name="eleven" /&gt;

The "[[commodification]] objection" is the reluctance to classify an important cultural good as a simple trade commodity, and is frequently cited by cultural protectionists.&lt;ref name="nine" /&gt;  Those who advocate openness believe that free-market nations can provide the most effective political force for development of an active market.  This argument diametrically opposes Bator’s: free-trade advocates contend that large countries are better suited to help smaller nations finance organization of their cultural resources for more effective participation in international trade.&lt;ref name="eleven" /&gt;

The issue of the illicit art trade also factors into the debate.  In terms of value transferred, the illegal trafficking of art ranks in black market activities second only to narcotics.&lt;ref name="thirteeen" /&gt; More problematic than the actual theft of the work is its subsequent transport, which proves difficult to prosecute since most paintings are easily concealable. By maintaining an open market, liberalists argue that much of the illicit trade of art can be eliminated.&lt;ref name="nine" /&gt;

==Largest countries by total trade in art==

The following tables list the top world import/export values, according to data from the UN Comtrade database using SITC code 8960.  The sums here are greater than those included in HS 9701 (works done exclusively by hand) because the SITC classification includes works such as antiques, stamps, and sculpture that aren’t captured in the HS definition.&lt;ref name="three" /&gt;

== History ==

[[File:Benbadhanabongse.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Prince Benbadhnabongse, the Prince of Phichai]]

In 1902, [[King Chulalongkorn]] attempted to promote the country's silk, silverware, and weaving industries. He hired Dr Kametaro Toyama from the [[University of Tokyo]], to train Siamese students in Japanese silk and weaving crafts.&lt;ref&gt;Japan International Research Center for Agricultural Sciences [http://www.jircas.affrc.go.jp/english/publication/jarq/03-4/03-4-030-033.pdf "A Scientist and a Link of the Chain uniting Thailand and Japan"] Retrieved 2017-01-02&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904, the School of Sericulture was founded at [[Pathum Wan District|Tambon Thung Saladaeng]], [[Bangkok]] by [[Benbadhanabongse|Prince Benbadhanabongse]], the Director of the Department of Sericulture of the Ministry of Agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;กรมหม่อนไหม [http://qsds.go.th/newqsds/inside_page.php?pageid=10 ประวัติกรมหม่อนไหม] Retrieved 2017-01-02&lt;/ref&gt; The school was renamed the School of Agriculture in 1906.

In 1908, the School of the Ministry of Agriculture was founded at [[Windsor Palace (Thailand)|Windsor Palace]] as the [[Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives (Thailand)|Ministry of Agriculture]] merged three schools, the School of Surveying (founded in 1882), the School of Irrigation (founded in 1905), and the School of Agriculture. Thailand's first tertiary-level agriculture curriculum began to offer courses in 1909.

In 1917, Phraya Thepsartsatit and [[Chaophraya Thammasakmontri]] of the Ministry of Education founded the first primary school of agriculture under the Ministry of Agriculture, named the Primary School Agriculture Teacher Training School in [[Pathum Wan District|Tambon Horwang]]. It moved to [[Mueang Nakhon Pathom District|Tambon Phra Prathon]], [[Nakhon Pathom Province]] in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;มหาวิทยาลัยเกษตรศาสตร์ [http://pirun.ku.ac.th/~fedupst/Chapter4.pdf การพัฒนาอาชีวเกษตรกรรม] Retrieved 2017-01-02&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931, [[Sithiporn Kridakara|Prince Sithiporn Kridakara]] and Chaophraya Thammasakmontri together expanded the school regionally. In the central region, a campus was located in [[Saraburi Province]], in the northern region in [[Chiang Mai Province]], in the northeastern region in [[Nakhon Ratchasima Province]], and in the southern region in [[Songkhla Province]].

[[File:Monuments_of_the_3_Masters_of_Kasetsart_University.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Statue of the Three Masters of Kasetsart University]]

In 1935, the Primary School Agriculture Teacher Training School in each part of the country was closed and merged following the agricultural education policy in that time. Luang Ingkhasikasikan, Luang Suwan Vajokkasikij, and Phra Chuangkasetsinlapakan&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ku.ac.th/about/history_ku.html บุคคลสำคัญของมหาวิทยาลัย] เรียกดูวันที่ 2013-02-21&lt;/ref&gt; together proposed to maintain the Mae Jo School (today's [[Mae Jo University]]) at Chiang Mai Province only and renamed it Secondary-level Agriculture Technical School before it was elevated to the College of Agriculture, under the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.

The Ministry of Agriculture established the Central Agriculture Station or "Kaset Klang", in [[Bang Khen District]], Bangkok. It caused the College of Agriculture to move to Bang Khen District in 1938 and the government office at Chiang Mai Province became [[Mae Jo University|Kasetsart Preparatory School]] to prepare students to study at the College of Agriculture in Bang Khen.

In 1943, [[Plaek Phibunsongkhram|Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram]] promoted the College of Agriculture and established Kasetsart University as a department of the Ministry of Agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;ราชกิจจานุเบกษา [http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2486/A/007/228.PDF พระราชบัญญัติมหาวิทยาลัยเกษตรศาสตร์ พุทธศักราช ๒๔๘๖] Retrieved 2017-01-02&lt;/ref&gt; The university consisted of four faculties: agriculture, fisheries, forestry, and cooperatives (today's Faculty of Economics and Faculty of Business Administration).&lt;ref&gt;ราชกิจจานุเบกษา [http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2486/A/007/228.PDF พระราชบัญญัติมหาวิทยาลัยเกษตรศาสตร์ พ.ศ. ๒๔๘๖] Retrieved 2017-01-02&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, Mom Luang Xujati Kambhu, the Fifth President of Kasetsart University, judged the Bang Khen campus too confined and unable to support the education in agricultural sciences called for by the National Social and Economics Development Plan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.psd.ku.ac.th/kuout/p013.html ประวัติมหาวิทยาลัย] Retrieved 2017-01-02&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kamphaeng Saen District|Kamphaeng Saen campus]] was established on 12 November 1979 as a result.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ku.ac.th/newdesign/content_level.php?menulevel=22 ประวัติมหาวิทยาลัยทศวรรษที่สี่ พ.ศ. 2516-2525] Retrieved 2017-01-02&lt;/ref&gt;

The university further expanded by establishing [[Si Racha District|Si Racha campus]], [[Sakon Nakhon Province|Chalermphrakiat Sakon Nakhon Province campus]], [[Suphan Buri Province|Suphan Buri campus]], [[Krabi Province|Krabi campus]] and [[Lopburi Province|Lopburi campus]].

On 18 July 2015, the Kasetsart University Act B.E. 2558 (2015) transformed it from a [[public university]] to a [[national university]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2558/A/066/1.PDF พระราชบัญญัติมหาวิทยาลัยเกษตรศาสตร์ พ.ศ. ๒๕๕๘] Retrieved 2017-01-02&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nontri tree===
The [[Peltophorum pterocarpum|Nontri tree]] has been a symbol of Kasetsart University since 1963. The [[Bhumibol Adulyadej|king]] and [[Sirikit|queen]] planted nine Nontri trees in the front of Kasetsart University's main auditorium on 29 November 1963 which became historic day for Nisit Kasetsart.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ku.ac.th/aboutku/thai/nontri.htm มหาวิทยาลัยเกษตรศาสตร์: ต้นนนทรี] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201082549/http://www.ku.ac.th/aboutku/thai/nontri.htm |date=1 December 2010 }} Retrieved 2017-01-02&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nontri is a tree in the [[Fabaceae|Fabaceae family]]. It is a long-lived evergreen with grey-brown bark with upright branches. The leaves are [[bipinnate]] compound and the flowers are yellow, produced in large compound [[racemes]]. Its fruit is a pod containing seeds.

'''Kenneth Dupee Swan''' (1887–1970), more commonly known as '''K.D. Swan''', was an American [[nature photography|nature photographer]] in the early part of the 20th century.  During his career in the [[United States Forest Service|USDA Forest Service]] (1911–1947) he took many picture of the [[American Northwest]]. Swan captured the face of public lands, revealing its wildness and value to the American public. His messages of long ago still emanate from his images - the value of conserving public lands and the joy of living in magnificent wild places.

==Early life==

Swan first learned to love America's wilderness while rambling the hills of his native [[Massachusetts]].  His "first love was a range of hills — the Blue Hills of Milton and Quincy — high points on the south rim of the Boston Basin." As he later described it, "This was my wilderness, easily reached from home by bicycle, trolley, or even on foot, and here I spent countless carefree hours in all seasons.... Here, too, was born a desire to become a forester ... a decision I have never regretted."&lt;ref name="findarticles.com"&gt;&lt;!-- Dead link [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3951/is_200604/ai_n17171917/pg_1]--&gt; [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-1021380461.html Forest Images by K. D. Swan: Pictures Needed in the Telling | Montana: The Magazine of Western History]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K. D. Swan, Splendid Was the Trail (Missoula, Mont., 1968), 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

He arrived in [[Missoula, Montana]] in the summer of 1911. With a master's degree in Forestry from [[Harvard University]],&lt;ref name="findarticles.com"/&gt; he was among a cadre of young energetic foresters who joined the newly created Forest Service where he was appointed as a forest assistant.

He surveyed homestead sites, planted trees, and cruised timber in the [[Lewis and Clark National Forest|Jefferson National Forest]] (now Lewis and Clark), [[Custer National Forest|Sioux National Forest]] (now Custer), and [[Clearwater National Forest]]. In 1913, the agency reassigned him to the Northern Region headquarters in [[Missoula, Montana|Missoula]], where he began a seven-year stint as a topographic draftsman, an "assignment which brought... great satisfaction."&lt;ref&gt;K. D. Swan, "Musselshell Reminiscence," in ''Early Days in the Forest Service'', vol. 2 (Missoula, Mont., 1955), 48.&lt;/ref&gt; He spent the remainder of his career working out of the regional office.&lt;ref name="findarticles.com"/&gt;

==Forest education and photography==

His work in forestry eventually led into the arena of public information and photography. In the 1920s, the Forest Service established the Information and Education Branch. Already recognized as a photographer, Swan was soon transferred to it.&lt;ref name="findarticles.com"/&gt;  Through his pictures and many public presentations, Swan revealed the unique beauty of remote, wild areas in [[Montana]], [[Idaho]], and the [[Dakotas]].

Swan's images were used to illustrate a great variety of Forest Service publications, many of which he also authored. They also appeared in publications ranging from ''[[National Geographic Magazine|National Geographic]]'' to ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]''. Swan regularly toured the region giving lectures on forest [[Conservation movement|conservation]], illustrated by both still slides and moving pictures.&lt;ref&gt;Missoula (Mont.) ''Missoulian'', November 30, 1941&lt;/ref&gt;

==Late years==

By Swan's retirement in 1947, his work had become art that transcended the mere recording of a place in time. Today, almost a century later, the photographs still engage and entrance viewers and tell a resounding story about public lands in the West. In 1968, he published ''Splendid Was the Trail'', a memoir that offered a detailed look at life and work in a remote, sparsely populated region during the formative years of the Forest Service.&lt;ref name="findarticles.com"/&gt;

==Legacy==

A collection of Swan's photographs is now in the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], as well as in many exhibits throughout the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fs.fed.us/r1/centennial/calendar.shtml Northern Region - Centennial&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602081410/http://www.fs.fed.us/r1/centennial/calendar.shtml |date=June 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4140">The '''Langkawi Declaration on the Environment''' was a declaration issued by the assembled [[Commonwealth Heads of Government|Heads of Government]] of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] on the issue of [[environmental sustainability]].  It was issued on October 21, 1989 at [[Langkawi]], [[Malaysia]], during the tenth [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting]] (CHOGM).

The declaration covers a wide range of topics related to the environment, blaming 'past neglect in managing the natural environment and resources'.&lt;ref name="Langkawi Declaration"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecommonwealth.org/document/34293/35468/171730/1989_langkawi_declaration_on_the_environment.htm |date=21 October 1989 |title=Langkawi Declaration on the Environment 1989 |accessdate=2008-08-31 |publisher=[[Commonwealth Secretariat]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202064714/http://www.thecommonwealth.org/document/34293/35468/171730/1989_langkawi_declaration_on_the_environment.htm |archivedate=2 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It lists what the Heads of Governments perceived to be the main environmental problems: the [[greenhouse effect]], damage to the [[ozone layer]], [[acid rain]], [[marine pollution]], [[land degradation]], and species [[extinction]].  These, the declaration affirmed, were issues that transcended national borders, and hence required the involvement of international organisations, such as the Commonwealth, to coordinate strategies to solve them.&lt;ref name="Langkawi Declaration" /&gt;

A key agreement in the formulation of the agreement was the pledge by [[developed country|developed countries]] not to connect future international [[development aid]] to commitment to environmental sustainability or introduce [[trade barrier]]s.&lt;ref name="Bowman"&gt;{{cite book |title=International Law and the Conservation of Biological Diversity |last=Bowman |first=Michael |author2=Redgwell, Catherine  |year=1996 |publisher=Kluwer Law International |location= |isbn=978-90-411-0863-0 |pages=239 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This, the developing countries argued, would prevent economic growth (described as a 'compelling necessity'),&lt;ref name="Langkawi Declaration" /&gt; and hence reduce their ability to develop sustainable natural environments.  In exchange, the developing countries conceded to the Commonwealth's developed members (particularly [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], and the [[United Kingdom]]), their interest in protecting the environment.&lt;ref name="Bowman" /&gt;

Amongst the commitments made by members in the Langkawi Declaration were:&lt;ref name="Langkawi Declaration" /&gt;
* Support the development of an international sustainable development funding mechanism.
* Support the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] and recommend the Commonwealth's own report on [[climate change]].
* Promote [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]].
* Promote [[afforestation]] and sustainable forest management in developing countries, and the conservation of [[Old growth forest|virgin forest]] to protect [[biodiversity]].
* Restrict non-[[sustainable fisheries]], including banning tangle nets and pelagic driftnet fishing, as part of a general trend amongst international organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://earthtrust.org/dnpaper/intllaw.html |date=May 1994 |title=International Law Governing Driftnet Fishing on the High Seas |accessdate=2008-08-31 |publisher=[[Earthtrust]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Prevent dumping of toxic or hazardous materials in the oceans or in developing countries.
* Promote public awareness of environmental risks and issues.

The '''Lick Observatory''' is an astronomical [[observatory]], owned and operated by the [[University of California]]. It is situated on the summit of [[Mount Hamilton (California)|Mount Hamilton]], in the [[Diablo Range]] just east of [[San Jose, California]], US. The observatory is managed by the University of California Observatories, with headquarters on the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] campus, where its scientific staff moved in the mid-1960s.

== Early history ==

Lick Observatory is the world's first permanently occupied mountain-top observatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collections.ucolick.org/archives_on_line/bldg_the_obs.html|title=The Lick Observatory Collections Project: Building the Observatory|author=|date=|website=collections.ucolick.org|accessdate=March 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The observatory, in a [[Classical Revival architecture|Classical Revival style]] structure, was constructed between 1876 and 1887, from a bequest from [[James Lick]] of $700,000 (approximately $22 million in 2014 US dollars).&lt;ref name=USObs&gt;

Lick, originally a carpenter and piano maker, chose the site atop Mount Hamilton and was buried there in 1887 under the future site of the telescope,&lt;ref name=USObs/&gt; with a brass tablet bearing the inscription, "Here lies the body of James Lick". {{citation needed|date = January 2014}}

[[File:Lick Observatory.JPG|right|thumb|Lick Observatory in 1900]]

Lick additionally requested that [[Santa Clara County]] construct a "first-class road" to the summit, completed in 1876.&lt;ref name=USObs/&gt; Lick chose John Wright, of San Francisco's Wright &amp; Sanders firm of architects, to design both the Observatory and the Astronomer's House.&lt;ref&gt;California Architect and Business News, 9/1881; Lick Observatory Archives.&lt;/ref&gt; All of the construction materials had to be brought to the site by horse and mule-drawn wagons, which could not negotiate a steep grade. To keep the grade below 6.5%, the road had to take a very winding and sinuous path, which the modern-day road ([[California State Route 130]]) still follows. Tradition maintains that this road has exactly 365 turns (This is approximately correct, although uncertainty as to what should count as a turn makes precise verification impossible). The road is closed when there is [[snow]] at Lick Observatory.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mount Hamilton (California)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first telescope installed at the observatory was a {{convert|12|in|adj=on|abbr=off|sp=us}} [[refracting telescope|refractor]] made by [[Alvan Clark]]. Astronomer [[E. E. Barnard]] used the telescope to make "exquisite photographs of comets and nebulae," according to D. J. Warner of [[Warner &amp; Swasey Company]].&lt;ref name=USObs/&gt;

[[Image:Lick Telescope 1889.jpg|left|thumb|upright|The Great Lick {{convert|36|in|cm|adj=on|abbr=off|order=flip|sp=us}} refractor, in an 1889 engraving]]

The {{convert|36|in|cm|adj=on|abbr=off|sp=us}} [[refracting telescope]] on Mt. Hamilton was Earth's largest refracting telescope during the period from when it saw [[First light (astronomy)|first light]] on January 3, 1888, until the construction of [[Yerkes Observatory]] in 1897. [[Warner &amp; Swasey]] designed and built the telescope mounting, with the {{convert|36|in|cm|adj=on|abbr=off|sp=us}} lens manufactured by one of the [[Alvan Clark &amp; Sons|Clark sons]], [[Alvan Graham Clark|Alvan Graham]]. [[Edward Emerson Barnard|E. E. Barnard]] used the telescope in 1892 to discover a fifth [[Moons of Jupiter|moon of Jupiter]], [[Amalthea (moon)|Amalthea]]. This was the first addition to Jupiter's known moons since [[Galileo]] observed the planet through his parchment tube and [[spectacle lens]]. The telescope provided [[Spectrum|spectra]] for [[William Wallace Campbell|W. W. Campbell's]] work on the [[radial velocities]] of [[star]]s.&lt;ref name=USObs/&gt;

In May 1888, the observatory was turned over to the [[Regents of the University of California]],&lt;ref name=NYTimes1888&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
and it became the first permanently occupied mountain-top observatory in the world. [[Edward Singleton Holden]] was the first director. The location provided excellent viewing performance because of lack of ambient light and pollution; additionally, the night air at the top of Mt. Hamilton is extremely calm, and the mountain peak is normally above the level of the low cloud cover that is often seen in the San Jose area. When low cloud cover is present below the peak, light pollution is cut to almost nothing.{{citation needed|date = January 2014}}

On May 21, 1939, during a nighttime fog that engulfed the summit, a U.S. Army Air Force [[Northrop A-17]] two-seater attack plane crashed into the main building. Because a scientific meeting was being held elsewhere, the only staff member present was [[Nicholas Mayall]]. Nothing caught fire and the two individuals&lt;!--was one not a staffer?--&gt; in the building were unharmed. The pilot of the plane, Lt. Richard F. Lorenz, and passenger Private W. E. Scott were killed instantly. The telephone line was broken by the crash, so no help could be called for at first. Eventually help arrived together with numerous reporters and photographers, who kept arriving almost all night long. Evidence of their numbers could be seen the next day by the litter of flash bulbs carpeting the parking lot. The press widely covered the accident and many reports emphasized the luck in not losing a large cabinet of spectrograms which was knocked over by the crash coming&lt;!--did the airplane come through the window, or the cabinet--&gt; through an astronomer's office window. Perhaps more notable was the lack of fire or damage to a telescope dome.&lt;ref name="Stone1970"&gt;&lt;!--this telescope is mentioned here, but its construction, installation, etc., are not mentioned at all--&gt;

The observatory additionally has a {{convert|24|in|cm|adj=on|abbr=off|sp=us}} [[Cassegrain reflector]] dedicated to [[photoelectric]] measurements of star brightness, and received a pair of {{convert|20|in|cm|adj=on|abbr=off|sp=us}} [[astrograph]]s from the [[Carnegie Corporation]].&lt;ref name=USObs/&gt;

With the growth of San Jose, and the rest of Silicon Valley, [[light pollution]] became a problem for the observatory.  In the 1970s, a site in the [[Santa Lucia Mountains]] at [[Junípero Serra Peak]], southeast of [[Monterey, California|Monterey]], was evaluated for possible relocation of many of the telescopes.  However, funding for the move was not available, and in 1980 San Jose began a program to reduce the effects of lighting, most notably replacing all streetlamps with [[Sodium vapor lamp#Low pressure / LPS / SOX|low pressure sodium lamps]]. The result is that the Mount Hamilton site remains a viable location for a major working observatory. The [[International Astronomical Union]] named [[6216 San Jose|Asteroid 6216 San Jose]] to honor the city's efforts toward reducing [[light pollution]].&lt;ref name="asteroid"&gt;[http://www.ucsc.edu/oncampus/currents/97-98/05-25/asteroid.htm UCSC, Lick Observatory designate asteroid for the city of San Jose] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817095443/http://www.ucsc.edu/oncampus/currents/97-98/05-25/asteroid.htm |date=August 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, there were 23 families in residence, plus typically between two and ten visiting astronomers from the University of California campuses, who stay in dormitories while working at the observatory. The little town of [[Mount Hamilton (California)|Mount Hamilton]] atop the mountain has its own police and a post office, and until 2005 had a one-room K-8 school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cde.ca.gov/re/sd/details.asp?cds=43693696046262&amp;Public=Y |title=Mt.

In 2008, there were 38 people residing on the mountain; the chef and commons dinner were decommissioned.{{citation needed|date = January 2014}}  By 2013, with continuing budget and staff cuts there remain only about nineteen residents and it is common for the observers to work from remote observing stations rather than make the drive, partly as a result of the business office raising the cost to stay in the dorms,{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} the swimming pool has been removed.{{citation needed|date = January 2014}}

In 2013, one of Lick Observatory's key funding sources was scheduled for elimination in 2018, which many worried would result in the closing of the entire observatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''Masterpiece''', '''''magnum opus''''' ([[Latin]], ''great work'') or '''''chef-d’œuvre''''' ([[French language|French]], ''master of work'', plural ''chefs-d’œuvre'') in modern use is a creation that has been given much critical praise, especially one that is considered the greatest work of a person's career or to a work of outstanding creativity, skill, profundity, or workmanship. Historically, a "masterpiece" was a work of a very high standard produced to obtain membership of a guild or academy in various areas of the visual arts and crafts.
[[File:Zuccari Two painter's apprentices.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Federico Zuccari]], ''Two Painter's Apprentices'', 1609. They would have to produce a ''masterpiece'' to become masters at the end of their apprenticeships.]]

==Etymology==
The form ''masterstik'' is recorded in English or [[Scots language|Scots]] in a set of [[Aberdeen]] guild regulations dated to 1579, whereas "masterpiece" is first found in 1605, already outside a guild context, in a [[Ben Jonson]] play.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]]:"Masterpiece". See also: [http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861628683/masterpiece.html Encarta]. [https://www.webcitation.org/5kx5TnWWs?url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861628683/masterpiece.html Archived] 2009-11-01.&lt;/ref&gt;  "Masterprize" was another early variant in English.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]]:"Masterprize"&lt;/ref&gt;

In English, the term rapidly became used in a variety of contexts for an exceptionally good piece of creative work, and was "in early use, often applied to man as the 'masterpiece' of God or Nature".&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], and examples&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Originally, the term ''masterpiece'' referred to a piece of work produced by an [[apprentice]] or [[journeyman]] aspiring to become a [[master craftsman]] in the old European [[guild]] system. His fitness to qualify for guild membership was judged partly by the masterpiece, and if he was successful, the piece was retained by the guild. Great care was therefore taken to produce a fine piece in whatever the craft was, whether confectionery, [[painting]], [[goldsmith]]ing, [[Knife making|knifemaking]], or many other trades.

In [[Kingdom of England|England]], in the 17th century, the [[Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths]], for instance, required an apprentice to produce a masterpiece under their supervision at a "workhouse" in [[Goldsmiths' Hall]]. The workhouse had been set up as part of a tightening of standards after the company became concerned that the level of skill of goldsmithing was being diluted. The wardens of the company had complained in 1607 that the "true practise of the Art &amp; Mystery of Goldsmithry is not only grown into great decays but also dispersed into many parts, so as now very few workmen are able to finish &amp; perfect a piece of plate singularly with all the garnishings &amp; parts thereof without the help of many &amp; several hands...". The same goldsmithing organization still requires the production of a masterpiece but it is no longer produced under supervision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thegoldsmiths.co.uk/library/archives/a-history-of-the-goldsmiths%27-company/ ''A History of the Goldsmiths' Company.''] The Goldsmiths' Company. Retrieved 30 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goldsmiths-centre.org/professional-training/goldsmiths-company-apprenticeship-programme/ Goldsmiths' Company Apprenticeship Programme.] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20141230121155/http://www.goldsmiths-centre.org/professional-training/goldsmiths-company-apprenticeship-programme/ |date=2014-12-30 }} The Goldsmiths' Centre. Retrieved 30 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Nuremberg, Germany, between 1531 and 1572, apprentices who wished to become master goldsmith were required to produce [[columbine cup]]s, dice for a steel seal, and gold rings set with precious stones before they could be admitted to the goldsmiths' guild. If they failed to be admitted, then they could continue to work for other goldsmiths but not as a master themselves. In some guilds, apprentices were not allowed to marry until they had obtained full membership.&lt;ref&gt;[https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O91876/cup-jamnitzer-wenzel/ Cup, Silver, room 69, case 25.] Victoria &amp; Albert Museum. Retrieved 30 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of producing a masterpiece has continued in some modern academies of art, where the general term for such works is now [[reception piece]]. The [[Royal Academy]] in London uses the term "[[diploma work]]" and it has acquired a fine collection of diploma works received as a condition of membership.

The '''Max-Planck-Institute for Quantum Optics''' (abbreviation: '''MPQ'''; {{lang-de|'''Max-Planck-Institut für Quantenoptik'''}}) is a part of the [[Max Planck Society]] which operates 87 research facilities in [[Germany]].

The institute is located in [[Garching]], [[Germany]], which in turn is located 10&amp;nbsp;km north-east of [[Munich]]. Five research groups work in the fields of attosecond physics, [[laser physics]], quantum information theory, [[laser spectroscopy]], quantum dynamics and quantum many body systems.

== Research ==
The institute conducts investigations in quantum physics. The faculty members conducts research in topics such as theoretical quantum optics, [[quantum information theory]], ultra-high-resolution laser spectroscopy, quantum physics of ultra-cold atoms, development of components for [[quantum computers]] and quantum networks, Bose-Einstein condensation of degenerate quantum gases, attosecond physics, development of new radiation and particle sources for fundamental and medical applications, etc. There was a group at MPQ that conducted experiments on gravitational waves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mpg.de/english/institutesProjectsFacilities/instituteChoice/quantenoptik/instProfil/instForschungsthemen/index.html |title=Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics (Research) |accessdate=2007-12-21 |publisher=The Max Planck Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Max-Planck-Institute for Quantum Optics was founded on January 1, 1981. It was a successor of a project group for laser research of the [[Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics]]. The use of lasers for fusion research, quantum optics and spectroscopy were the goals of the project group, which was established in 1976 and consisted of 46 members. In 1981 the staff numbers had risen to 82 and the institute was comprising the divisions of Laser Physics (Prof. Herbert Walther), Laser Chemistry (Prof. Karl-Ludwig Kompa) and Laser Plasma (Dr. Siegbert Witkowski).

The institute was accommodated for a time on the premises of the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics. The institute moved to the new building in July, 1986 and officially separated from the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics. With the appointment of [[Theodor Hänsch]] (then at [[Stanford University]]) as new director, the institute grew significantly. Hänsch established the Laser Spectroscopy Division and was also given a chair at the [[Ludwig Maximilians Universität]] Munich which ensured close links between MPQ and the university complex in Munich. After the retirement of Siegbert Witkowski in 1993, the research on the high energy laser was stopped and other research areas were started.

In 1999 Professor [[Gerhard Rempe]] (then [[University of Constance]]) was appointed as director at the MPQ, and the Quantum Dynamics Division was set up.

In 2001 the Research Group on [[Gravitational Waves]] moved to Hanover where the first test measurements were carried out in the experiment. Since then that group has been a part of the [[MPI for Gravitational Physics]] (Potsdam) that was founded in 1995. In the same year (2001) Professor Ignacio Cirac (then [[University of Innsbruck]]) accepted a call as director at the MPQ and set up the first Theory Division at the institute. 
 
At the beginning of 2003 Professor Herbert Walther acquired emeritus status, but continued his research work as head of the Laser Physics Emeritus Group until his death in July 2006. His successor as director at the MPQ and professor at the LMU is Professor Ferenc Krausz (previously [[Technical University of Vienna]]). Professor Krausz has led the Attosecond Physics Division since 2003.

With the retirement of Professor Karl-Ludwig Kompa in 2006, all the founding fathers of the institute were thus now in retirement. In parallel with these retirements not only were three new divisions established but also several independent research groups founded: In 2004 the Attosecond Driver Laser Group was formed, whose leader Dr. Andrius Baltuska took up a professorship at the Technical University of Vienna in 2006. The same year also the Quantum Simulations with Trapped Ions Group was founded, led by Dr. Tobias Schätz (now at the [[University of Freiburg]]). In 2005 Dr. Tobias Kippenberg (now at the [[Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne]]) set up his Laboratory of Photonics at the MPQ. In 2006 Dr. Reinhard Kienberger (now at [[TU München]]) received funding to set up the research group Attosecond Dynamics. In 2007 a further research group was founded, on Attosecond Imaging, led by Dr. Matthias Kling. In January 2008 Dr. Masaki Hori established his group on Antimatter Spectroscopy, followed by the Ultrafast Quantum Optics group of Dr. Peter Hommelhoff (now at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg) in April 2008. Since December 2010 Dr. [[Eleftherios Goulielmakis|Elefterios Goulielmakis]] is setting up his research group on Attoelectronics, financed by a grant of the [[European Research Council]] (ERC). Also financed with an ERC grant Dr. Randolf Pohl started to establish his research group "[[Muonic Atoms]]" at the end of 2011.

In 2005, [[Theodor W. Hänsch]] was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]], together with [[John L. Hall]], ''"for their contributions to the development of laser-based precision spectroscopy, including the optical frequency comb technique"''. The [[frequency comb]] the Nobel Prize is referring to has been developed in his Laser Spectroscopy Division in the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;

On 1 August 2008 a fifth division Quantum Many Body Systems was established by Prof. Immanuel Bloch. Prof. Bloch is successor of Prof. Theodor W. Hänsch, who would have normally retired in 2009, as director at MPQ. Due to special agreements Prof. Hänsch will remain professor at the LMU and director at the MPQ at least until 2016. One research focus of Prof. Bloch is the investigation of ultracold quantum gases in optical lattices. These systems may help to model solid states and to get a better understanding of special properties like e.g. [[high temperature superconductivity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mpg.de/english/institutesProjectsFacilities/instituteChoice/quantenoptik/instProfil/instGeschichte/index.html |title=History of Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics |accessdate=2007-12-21 |publisher=The Max Planck Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mental Models''''' is a book published by [[Lawrence Erlbaum Associates]], Inc., in 1983 {{ISBN|0-89859-242-9}}.  It was edited by [[Dedre Gentner]] and Albert L. Stevens, both employees of [[Bolt, Beranek and Newman]], Inc. at the time.  It appeared at about the same time as a book by the same name by [[Philip Johnson-Laird]].  According to the [[acknowledgment (creative arts)|acknowledgment]] of the book, it resulted from a workshop on [[mental model]]s held at the [[University of California, San Diego]] in October 1980, that was jointly sponsored by the [[Office of Naval Research]] and the [[Sloan Foundation]].

==Chapters==
#Some Observations on Mental Models — [[Donald A. Norman]], [[UCSD]]
#:Dr. Norman describes the properties of mental models — that they can be contradictory, incomplete, superstitious, erroneous, and unstable, varying in time.  So the job of system designers is to help users form an accurate and useful mental model of a system.  And the job of researchers is to set up experiments to learn to understand actual mental models, even though they may be messy and incomplete.

The '''National Agricultural Policy Center (NAPC)''' ({{lang-ar|المركز الوطني للسياسات الزراعية}}), was established in 2000 through the work of the Project GCP/SYR/006/ITA&lt;ref name="fao.org"&gt;http://www.fao.org/world/syria/gcpita/&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[FAO|Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)]] of the [[United Nations]], funded by the Government of Italy, to be part of the Syrian [[Ministry of Agriculture and Agrarian Reform (Syria)|Ministry of Agriculture and Agrarian Reform]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.agri.gov.sy&lt;/ref&gt; The project is now in its third phase. It is a center of research and analysis in the field of agricultural policies in [[Syria]], and therefore strives to provide policy analysis for relevant stakeholders and policymakers in the field.

== History ==
[[Image:NAPC group.JPG|thumb|right|300px|NAPC and Project Staff at the NAPC Premises in 2007]]
The [[FAO]] Project GCP/SYR/006/ITA&lt;ref name="fao.org"/&gt; started in April 1998, and sought to respond to the Government of Syria's initiative to move from a socially [[planned economy]] to a [[social market economy]]. After background work and training from the Project the NAPC was established in 2000 as part of the Project's first phase (April 1998 - October 2001). In the second phase (November 2001 - October 2004) of the Project extensive training was delivered to the now fully staffed NAPC, an organizational structure was developed and a mid-term work-plan established. In third phase (November 2004 - October 2007), the Project assisted in consolidating the work of the NAPC with a view to its future independence and sustainability.

== Establishment Aims ==
To meet the long as well as short-term needs of decision-makers for in-depth and rigorous analysis for policy options on issues of relevance. Including:
* undertaking policy analysis studies enabling the formulation of integrated, coherent and effective agricultural strategies and policies
* suggesting policy directives to help relieve and overcome agricultural problems and constraints
* preparing and publishing policy studies and reports to enable the integration of the agricultural sector within the economy
* conducting training courses with a view to helping in the capacity building in policy analysis and planning within the Syrian Ministry of Agriculture and Agrarian Reform and other related Ministries and Institutions.

== NAPC Structure and Focus Areas ==
The NAPC is divided into four different divisions, each with a specific mandate related to the subject of agricultural policy analysis in Syria. These divisions are as follows: Trade Policy (TPD), Agro-Food (AFD), Rural Development (RDD) and Information and Communications (InfoCom).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.napcsyr.org/about.htm About NAPC&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The focus areas of each division can be given as follows:

===Trade Policy===
*[[international trade|International Trade Agreements]]
*[[Investment]]
*[[trade|Trade Policy]]
*[[Agricultural Marketing]]
*[[Competitiveness]]

===Agro-Food===

*Event Organization
*Publications
*ICT in Agriculture
*Library Services
*[[ICT for Development]]

== Publications ==
The major publications of the NAPC are the two Periodical Reports that it produces. One of which, '''Syrian Agricultural Trade (SAT)'''&lt;ref name="Periodical Reports"&gt;[http://www.napcsyr.org/pubs/periodical/reports.htm Periodical Reports&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; is published annually, the other of which, '''The State of Food and Agriculture in Syria (SOFAS)'''&lt;ref name="Periodical Reports"/&gt; is biannual. These are substantial studies which give a regular overview of the situation of agriculture and agricultural trade in Syria.

In addition to these publications the NAPC regularly produces Policy Studies, Working Papers, and Policy Notes on a wide range of different issues. Furthermore, the NAPC makes available the proceedings of various seminars and workshops. All of the publications are made available through the NAPC website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.napcsyr.org National Agricultural Policy Center&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Syrian Agricultural Database (SADB)==
Is a fully disaggregated and detailed database for Syrian Agriculture based on [[FAOSTAT]] format.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.napcsyr.org/sadb.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The database is fully browseable and searchable through the NAPC website and is made available to the general public. It includes data on areas such as trade, national economic data, census, inputs and outputs, production, natural resources, fertilizers, machinery.&lt;ref name="Syrian Agriculture Database"/&gt; The SADB has been available since 2003 and is updated each year to reflect the most recent data available.

'''Paraloid B-72''' or '''B-72''' is a [[thermoplastic]] resin that was created by [[Rohm and Haas]] for use as a surface coating and as a vehicle for [[flexographic ink]]. Today B-72 is commonly being used as an adhesive by [[conservator-restorer]]s, specifically in the [[conservation and restoration of ceramic objects]] and [[conservation and restoration of glass objects|glass objects]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://cameo.mfa.org/wiki/Paraloid_B-72] Paraloid B-72: Museum of Fine Arts Boston: Material Database&lt;/ref&gt; and can also be used for labelling museum objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/01-04.pdf|title=Use Of Acryloid B-72 Lacquer For Labelling Museum Objects|last=|first=|date=|website=https://www.nps.gov/|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
[[File:Paraloid b72.jpg||250px|left|thumb|Paraloid B-72 in pellet form]]
B-72 is a durable and non-yellowing acrylic resin, which can be described chemically as an ethyl-methacrylate copolymer. It is soluble in [[acetone]], [[ethanol]], [[toluene]], and [[xylene]]s, among other solvents and solvent mixtures.&lt;ref&gt;Phenix, A. 1992. Solvents for Paraloid B-72. Conservation News 48:21–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major advantages of B-72 as a consolidant is that it is stronger and harder than [[polyvinyl acetate]] without being extremely brittle. This adhesive is more flexible than many of the other typically used adhesives and tolerates more stress and strain on a join than most others. The major drawbacks to using B-72 are related to its handling properties: as in the case of other acrylic resins it is difficult to apply as an adhesive and to manipulate with precision.&lt;ref name=Koob&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koob|first=Stephen|title=The Use of Paraloid B-72 as an adhesive. Its application for archaeological ceramics and other materials|journal=Studies in Conservation|date=30 April 1986|volume=31|pages=7–14|doi=10.1179/sic.1986.31.1.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most suitable solvent for B-72 is acetone. However, solvent mixtures with various proportions of acetone, ethanol, and toluene are frequently used to alter the working time of the resin and to produce slightly different properties (hardness and flexibility, e.g.) in the set resin. Unlike [[cellulose nitrate]], B-72 does not need additives like [[plasticizer]]s to stabilize its durability. Fumed [[colloidal silica]] can be added to help with the workability of the resin. Research shows that the silica better distributes the stress and strain that occurs during evaporation of a solvent and during the setting of the adhesive film.&lt;ref name="Koob"/&gt;{{rp|p.9}}

Because of its transparency and versatility, conservators, led by Stephen Koob of the [[Corning Museum of Glass]], have recently begun to use cast sheets of B-72 as a fill material in glass objects.&lt;ref name=Corning&gt;{{cite journal|last=von Giffen|first=Astrid|title=Filling losses with Paraloid B-72.|url=http://www.cmog.org/blog/2011/11/01/filling-losses-with-paraloid-b-72/|publisher=Corning Museum of Glass|accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Poetics of Cinema''''' is a book series of [[film theory]] by Chilean filmmaker [[Raúl Ruiz (director)|Raúl Ruiz]] (1941-2011) consisting principally of lectures he gave in diverse locations between 1990 and 2009.&lt;ref name="artbook"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artbook.com/2906571385.html |title=Poetics of Cinema |accessdate=2012-05-11|work=artbook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
In ''Poetics of Cinema 1: Miscellanies'' (1995), Ruiz outlines his rejection of [[John Howard Lawson]]'s central conflict theory and makes a case for unique, enigmatic boredom in film. In ''Poetics of Cinema 2'' (2006), he addresses the notions of fascination and detachment with respect to the film-image. In the third volume (published posthumously in Spanish in 2013) he takes on [[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s writings and describes his own work on ''[[La Recta Provincia]]'' and ''[[Nucingen House]]''.

'''Public sex'''&lt;!--UK slang term treated below.--&gt; is [[Human sexual behavior|sexual activity]] that takes place in a public context. It refers to one or more persons performing a sex act in a [[public place]], or in a [[private place]] which can be viewed from a public place.

Such a private place may be a back yard, a barn, balcony or a bedroom with the curtains open. Public sex also includes sexual acts in semi-public places where the general public is free to enter, such as  shopping malls. Public sex acts can be performed in cars (colloquially called "parking"), on beaches, in forests, theatres, buses, aeroplanes, streets, [[toilet]] [[cubicle]]s, or [[cemetery|cemeteries]].

In September 2003, the [[BBC]] reported on a "[[Dogging (sexual slang)|dogging]]" craze fueled by Internet publicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3119024.stm|title='Dogging' craze sex disease risk|date=8 September 2003|publisher=BBC|accessdate=25 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dogging is a [[British English]] slang term for engaging in public sex, usually in a car park or country park, while others watch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sundayherald.com/36866|work=[[Sunday Herald]]|title=Councils voice concern over new sex craze|author=Jen Johnston|date=21 September 2003|accessdate=28 August 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030922095216/http://www.sundayherald.com/36866|archivedate=22 September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pub&gt;{{cite news |author= |title= Here's the Pub, Church and Field for Public Sex|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/08/world/europe/08puttenham.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all |quote=Unhappily for many people here, it is also famous for being featured on lists of good places to go "dogging" — that is, to have sex in public, sometimes with partners you have just met online, so that others can watch.

It is treated as a crime only if someone witnesses it, is offended and is willing to make a formal complaint. The police tend to tread lightly in public sex environments, in part because of the bitter legacy of the time when gay sex was illegal and closeted men having anonymous sex in places like public bathrooms were routinely arrested and humiliated.|work=[[New York Times]] |date=7 October 2010 |accessdate=8 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite news|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100311002007/http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2004/03/62718|url=https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2004/03/62718|archive-date=11 March 2010|date=19 March 2004|last=Kahney|first=Leander |title=Dogging Craze Has Brits in Heat|newspaper=Wired Magazine|accessdate=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dogging has aspects of [[exhibitionism]] and [[voyeurism]].

[[File:NAP 2013 . Flashing Spectators 13.jpg|thumb|280px|A topless couple kisses in public, [[Nudes-A-Poppin']], USA, 2013]]
Social views related to public sex and sexuality vary greatly between different cultures and different times. There are many and varied laws which apply to sex in public, which use a variety of terms such as [[indecent exposure]], [[public lewdness]], [[gross indecency between men|gross indecency]], and others. In some jurisdictions, an offense is committed only if the participants are seen by others, so that a sex act may occur in a closed toilet cubicle without an offense being committed.

In the UK, there has been a rise in [[sex on premises venue|public sex venues]], possibly due to a more relaxed approach to the enforcement of laws relating to public sex since the early 1990s.&lt;ref name=Finlayson1998&gt;{{cite news |title=The Human Condition: Johnny be good |last=Finlayson |first=Iain |authorlink=Iain Finlayson |date=21 June 1998 |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/the-human-condition-johnny-be-good-1166398.html|quote=The debate was largely irrelevant in the UK,where at the time there were very few public sex venues (or PSVs). In the Nineties, however, there has been a significant increase in commercial gay venues, particularly in London where there are now at least 15 saunas and 10 bar/clubs that provide facilities for gay sex on their premises.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality==
The legal status of public sexual conduct was addressed in United Kingdom as part of the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]]. Section 71 of the act makes it an offence to engage in sexual activity in a public lavatory. In the United Kingdom public sex comes under laws related to [[voyeurism]], [[exhibitionism]] or public displays of sexual behaviour, but public sex law enforcement remains ambiguous. Prosecution is possible for a number of offences under section 5 of the [[Public Order Act 1986]], [[indecent exposure|exposure]] under section 66 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003, or under the common law offence of [[outraging public decency]]. The policy of the Association of Chief Police Officers ([[ACPO]]) is that arrests are a last resort and a more gradual approach should be taken in such circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/lancashire/7674874.stm | work=BBC News | title=Police leniency call on park sex | date=17 October 2008 | accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Ratirahasya'''''  ([[Sanskrit]] {{lang|sa| रतिरहस्य }}) (translated in English as '''''Secrets of Love''''', also known as the '''''Koka Shastra''''') is a medieval [[India]]n [[sex manual]] written by Kokkoka, a poet, who is variously described as Koka or Koka Pundit.&lt;ref name="Vātsy jkedaqw    āyanaDane2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Vātsyāyana|author2=Lance Dane|title=The Complete Illustrated Kama Sutra|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gNV1BP2DCWYC&amp;pg=PT12|accessdate=23 March 2012|date=7 October 2003|publisher=Inner Traditions / Bear &amp; Co|isbn=978-0-89281-138-0|pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FrayserWhitby1995"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Suzanne G.

Unlike the ''[[Kama Sutra]]'', which is an [[Ancient India|ancient]] sex manual related to [[Hindu literature]], ''Ratirahasya'' deals with [[medieval India]]n society. During the medieval age, India became more conservative compared to ancient India, freedom of women decreased, and [[Premarital sex|premarital]] and [[extramarital sex]] were frowned upon. A sex manual was needed that would be suitable for the medieval cultural climate, and ''Ratirahasya'' was written, quite different from the ancient text ''Kama Sutra''.&lt;ref name="FrayserWhitby1995"/&gt;

There are fifteen ''pachivedes'' (chapters) and 800 verses in ''Ratirahasya'' which deal with various topics such as different physiques, [[lunar calendar]], different types of [[genital]]s, characteristics of women of various ages, [[hug]]s, [[kiss]]es, [[sexual intercourse]] and [[sex position]]s, sex with a strange woman, etc.&lt;ref name="Vātsy jkedaqw    āyanaDane2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FrayserWhitby1995"/&gt; Kokokka describes various stages of love in ''Ratirahasya'', the fifth stage being [[weight loss]], the ninth is [[fainting]], and the tenth and last stage is death.&lt;ref name="Lienhard1984"&gt;{{cite book|author=Siegfried Lienhard|title=A History of Classical Poetry: Sanskrit, Pali, Prakrit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E0aYeR67booC&amp;pg=PA119|accessdate=23 March 2012|year=1984|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=978-3-447-02425-9|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ratirahasya'' makes classifications of women, and describes [[erogenous zone]]s and days that lead to women's easy arousal.

''Ratirahasya'' is the first book to describe in detail Indian [[Femininity|feminine]] beauty. The book classified women into four psycho-physical  types, according to their appearance and physical features.&lt;ref name="Our B-I-G fix"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kazmi|first=Nikhat|title=Our B-I-G fix|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bombay-times/Our-B-I-G-fix/articleshow/722511.cms|accessdate=27 March 2012|newspaper=Times of India|date=Jun 7, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="QI: Quite interesting facts about weddings"&gt;{{cite news|title=QI: Quite interesting facts about weddings|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/qi/8466023/QI-Quite-interesting-facts-about-weddings.html|accessdate=27 March 2012|date=21 Apr 2011| newspaper= The Telegraph|author=Molly Oldfield|author2=John Mitchinson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the basis of the size of the genitals, the text classifies sexual intercourse into nine different types. [[Aphrodisiac]]s are also described in the book.&lt;ref name="Kar2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kar|title=Comprehensive Textbook of Sexual Medicine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YxcjMPbGHQIC&amp;pg=PA456|accessdate=23 March 2012|date=1 January 2005|publisher=Jaypee Brothers Publishers|isbn=978-81-8061-405-7|page=456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[W.G. Archer]], Kokkoka "is concerned with how to make the most of sex, how to enjoy it and how to keep a woman happy."&lt;ref name="FrayserWhitby1995"/&gt; In writing this text, Kokokka depended on a number of other authors including, among others [[Nandikeshvara]], [[Gonikaputra]], and [[Vatsyayana]].&lt;ref name="(A-mdo)1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dge-ʼdun-chos-ʼphel (A-mdo)|title=Tibetan arts of love|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zmxR93ZeSBMC&amp;pg=PA35|accessdate=23 March 2012|year=1992|publisher=Snow Lion Publications|isbn=978-0-937938-97-3|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] translations of the book are entitled ''Lizzat-al-Nissa''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night|publisher=Forgotten Books|isbn=9781440039980|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O2AdV8WoRMgC&amp;pg=PA93&amp;dq=Lizzat-al+nissa&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FIZxT63qDo_MrQft98XMDQ&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Lizzat-al%20nissa&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alex Comfort]], author of ''[[The Joy of Sex]]'', made an English translation of ''Ratirahasya'' in 1964 titled ''The Koka Shashtra, Being the Ratirahasya of Kokkoka, and Other Medieval Indian Writings on Love'' (London: George Allen and Unwin). Another English translation was made by S. C. Upadhyaya, entitled ''Kokashastra (Rati Rahasya) of Pundit Kokkoka''. Some commentaries have been written on this text by [[Avana Rama Chandra]], [[Kavi Prabhu]], and [[Harihara]]. It is a popular text in India, second only to the ''[[Kama Sutra]]'' among sex manuals.&lt;ref name="(A-mdo)1992"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18886">'''Reflectivism''' is a broad [[Umbrella term|umbrella label]], used primarily in [[International relations theory|International Relations theory]], for a range of theoretical approaches which oppose [[Rational choice|rational-choice]] accounts of social phenomena and, perhaps, [[positivism]] more generally.  The label was popularised by [[Robert Keohane]] in his presidential address to the [[International Studies Association]] in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;The attribution to Keohane is standard -- see e.g. Milja Kurki, ''Causation in International Relations: Reclaiming Causal Analysis''.  Cambridge University Press (2008), p. 124 n. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The address was entitled "International Institutions: Two Approaches", and contrasted two broad approaches to the study of [[international institution]]s (and international phenomena more generally).  One was "rationalism", the other what Keohane referred to as "reflectivism".  Rationalists — including [[Realism (international relations)|realists]], [[Neorealism (international relations)|neo-realists]], [[Liberalism (international relations)|liberals]], [[Neoliberalism in international relations|neo-liberals]], and scholars using [[Game theory|game-theoretic]] or [[Expected utility|expected-utility]] [[Economic model|models]] — are theorists who adopt the broad theoretical and [[ontological]] commitments of [[Rational choice theory|rational-choice theory]].

== Rationalism vs. reflectivism ==
Keohane characterised rationalism in the following fashion:

:[Rationalists accept] what [[Herbert A. Simon|Herbert Simon]] has referred to a "substantive" conception of rationality, characterizing "behaviour that can be adjudged objectively to be [[Optimal decision|optimally]] adapted to the situation" (Simon, 1985:294).  As Simon has argued, the principle of [[Decision-making models#Rationality|substantive rationality]] generates hypotheses about actual human behaviour only when it is combined with certain [[Duhem–Quine thesis|auxiliary]] [[Scientific theory#Assumptions in formulating theories|assumptions]] about the structure of [[utility function]]s and the formation of expectations.

:Since this research program is rooted in [[exchange theory]], it assumes [[scarcity]] and competition as well as [[rationality]] on the part of the actors.  Rationalistic theories of [[institution]]s view institutions as affecting patterns of [[Cost#Comparing private, external, social, and psychic costs|costs]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert O. Keohane, "International Institutions: Two Approaches", ''International Studies Quarterly'' 32, 4 (Dec. 1988), pp. 381, 386.&lt;/ref&gt;

Keohane went on to contrast this with the approach of "reflective" scholars:
:These authors, of whom the best-known include [[Hayward Alker]], [[Richard K. Ashley|Richard Ashley]], [[Friedrich Kratochwil]], and [[John Ruggie]], emphasize the importance of the "[[Intersubjectivity|intersubjective]] meanings" of international institutional activity (Kratochwil and Ruggie, 1986:765).  In their view, understanding how people think about institutional [[Social norms|norms]] and rules, and the [[discourse]] they engage in, is as important in evaluating the significance of these norms as measuring the behavior that changes in response to their invocation.

:These writers emphasize that individuals, local organizations, and even states develop within the context of more encompassing institutions.  Institutions do not merely reflect the [[Preference (economics)|preferences]] and power of the units constituting them; the institutions themselves shape those preferences and that power.  Institutions are therefore constitutive of actors as well as vice versa.  It is therefore not sufficient in this view to treat the preferences of individuals as given [[exogenous]]ly: they are affected by institutional arrangements, by prevailing norms, and by historically contingent discourse among people seeking to pursue their purposes and solve their self-defined problems.

:[I]t would be fair to refer to them as "[[Verstehen|interpretive]]" scholars, since they all emphasize the importance of historical and textual interpretation and the limitations of [[Scientific modelling|scientific models]] in studying world politics. But other approaches also have a right to be considered [[Antipositivism|interpretive]]. I have therefore coined a phrase for these writers, calling them "reflective", since all of them emphasize the importance of human reflection for the nature of institutions and ultimately for the character of world politics.&lt;ref&gt;Keohane, "International Institutions", pp. 381-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflectivism and rationalism are typically used as labels applying not just to the study of international institutions, but of international relations more widely, and even the social world as a whole.  Sociologies and histories of the International Relations discipline have sometimes used the opposition between these approaches to describe one of the central fault-lines within the discipline.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Ole Waever, "The Rise and Fall of the Inter-Paradigm Debate", in Steve Smith, Ken Booth and Marysia Zalewski (eds.), ''International Theory: Positivism and Beyond''.  Cambridge University Press (1996), pp. 164-70.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reflexivity ==
There may be another sense, not specifically discussed by Keohane, in which the label is apt. Reflectivist scholars tend to emphasise the inherent [[Reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]] both of theory and of the social world it studies.  Unlike the term ''reflectivism'', the concept of [[Reflexivity (social theory)|"reflexivity"]] has wide currency outside of international relations, having come to prominence in [[social theory]] in the latter part of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Prominent early works in social theory developing the theme of reflexivity include Anthony Giddens, ''The Constitution of Society: Outline of the Theory of Structuration''.  Polity (1984); [[Pierre Bourdieu]] and Loïc Wacquant, ''An Invitation to Reflexive Sociology''.  University of Chicago Press (1992); and Ulrich Beck, ''Risk Society: Towards a New Modernity''.  SAGE (1992 [1986]).&lt;/ref&gt; Reflexivity refers to the ways in which elements and phenomena in social life have the capacity to "fold in on", or be "directed towards", themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Similar imagery is used by Matthew Eagleton-Pierce, "Examining the Case for Reflexivity in International Relations: Insights from Bourdieu", ''Journal of Critical Globalisation Studies'' 1 (2009), p. 111–12.  Another explicit analysis of reflexivity in IR, also inspired by the social theory of Pierre Bourdieu, is Anna Leander, "Do We Really Need Reflexivity in IPE? Bourdieu's Two Reasons for Answering Affirmatively", ''Review of International Political Economy'' 9, 4 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; That is, they can produce effects on, or have implications for, their own features, dynamics and existence. An example is the "[[self-fulfilling prophecy]]" (or "self-disconfirming prophecy")&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Ido Oren, "Can Political Science Emulate the Natural Sciences? The Problem of Self-Disconfirming Analysis", ''Polity'' 38, 1 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; — a situation in which merely describing, predicting, imagining or believing something to be the case may eventually result in its actually coming to be the case.&lt;ref&gt;In IR, see e.g. David Patrick Houghton, "The Role of Self-Fulfilling and Self-Negating Prophecies in International Relations", ''International Studies Review'' 11, 3 (2009); Robert Jervis, ''System Effects: Complexity in Political and Social Life''.  Princeton University Press (1997), pp. 60, 148–50.&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, reflectivists emphasise the significance of human [[self-awareness]]: the ways people observe, imagine, describe, predict and theorise about themselves and the social reality around them, and the [[wikt:recursive|recursive]] effect this "self-knowledge" or these "reflections" have on that social reality itself.  Some scholars link reflexivity with [[Structure and agency|the broader debate]], within International Relations theory and social theory more generally, over the relationship between "[[Agency (sociology)|agency]]" and "[[Social structure|structure]]" in the social world.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Kate O'Neill, Jörg Balsiger and Stacy VanDeveer, "Actors, Norms and Impact: Recent International Cooperation Theory and the Influence of the Agent-Structure Debate", ''Annual Review of Political Science'' 7 (2004); Alexander Wendt, "The Agent-Structure Problem in International Relations Theory", ''International Organization'' 41, 3 (1987), p. 359; Daniel Mügge, "Reflexivity in Global Finance: How Agency Matters to Market Change", GARNET Working Paper #14/07 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the relationship between people's capacity to "freely" choose their actions and/or to "make a real difference" to the world around them, and the social "[[Social structure|structures]]" in which people are always embedded, and which may powerfully shape – often against their will or in ways they are unaware of – the kinds of things they are able to do.

Reflectivists also often claim that studying and ''theorising'' about international relations can be, should be, and are necessarily, reflexive. For one thing, they claim, theories about social reality may affect – might change – social reality itself.&lt;ref&gt;A point emphasised, among many others, by Brent J. Steele, ''Ontological Security in International Relations: Self-Identity and the IR State''.  Routledge (2008), pp. 150, 160-64 and passim.&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics of (neo-)realism have raised the possibility that realist theories, for instance, may act as [[Self-fulfilling prophecy|self-fulfilling prophecies]].  To the extent that they are taken by theorists and practitioners to be the "common sense" of international politics, diplomacy and policy-making, those theories may encourage precisely the kind of mistrust, ruthless competition and amorality that they posit to be natural and inherent features of the international realm.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Annette Freyburg-Inan, ''What Moves Man: The Realist Theory of International Relations and Its Judgment of Human Nature''. SUNY Press (2003); Alexander Wendt, ''Social Theory of International Politics''.  Cambridge University Press (1999), pp. 368-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Familiar methodological examples of the capacity of observation and theorising to affect the object/phenomena of study include the "[[observer-expectancy effect]]" and long-running concerns among anthropologists and ethnographers over the possible effect of [[Participant observer#Impact of researcher involvement|participant observation]] on the very people and behaviours being studied.

Furthermore, reflectivists argue, those theories invariably reflect in important ways the social context in which they were produced; so in a sense the social world shapes the theories made of it.&lt;ref&gt;One detailed empirical study is Ido Oren, ''Our Enemies and Us: America's Rivalries and the Making of Political Science''.  Cornell UP (2003); see also Oren, "Is Culture Independent of National Security? How America's National Security Concerns Shaped 'Political Culture' Research", ''European Journal of International Relations'' 6, 4 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; There is often a [[normative]] or ethical aspect to the emphasis on reflexivity.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Brooke Ackerly and Jacqui True, "Reflexivity in Practice: Power and Ethics in Feminist Research on International Relations", ''International Studies Review'' 10, 4 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Reflectivists often argue that theorists should be as self-aware as possible — to reflect as much as possible on the influences ([[Presupposition|assumptions]], [[bias]]es, normative commitments, etc.) that feed into and shape the theories they produce.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Mark Neufeld, "Reflexivity and International Relations Theory", ''Millennium'' 22, 1 (1993), p. 55ff.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, they should be able to [[Reflexivity (social theory)#Overview|hold their own theories]] to the standards and arguments they set out in those same theories.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Inanna Hamati-Ataya, "The 'Problem of Values' and International Relations Scholarship: From Applied Reflexivity to Reflexivism", ''International Studies Review'' 13, 2 (2011); Christian Büger, "Paradigms, Cultures and Translations: Seven Ways of Studying the Discipline of International Relations", paper presented at the Annual Convention of the International Studies Association, Chicago (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; And finally, they should reflect on the likely and possible effects of their theorising.  Some reflectivists (e.g. those of a [[Poststructuralism|post-structuralist]] persuasion) have argued that theorising should itself be understood as a [[Practice (social theory)|practice]], like the human practices that theories study; that it is an act (conscious or unconscious) of intervention into social reality, and that as such it is never "innocent" or "neutral", and there is a degree of responsibility for its consequences that theorists cannot (and should not try to) escape.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Marysia Zalewski, "'All These Theories yet the Bodies Keep Piling Up': Theories, Theorists, Theorising", in Smith, Booth and Zalewski (eds.), ''International Theory: Positivism and Beyond'', pp. 340-53; Steve Smith, "Singing Our World into Existence: International Relations Theory and September 11", ''International Studies Quarterly'' 48, 3 (2004); Jack Amoureux and Brent Steele, ''Reflexivity and International Relations''. Routledge Press (2016); Jack Amoureux, ''A Practice of Ethics for Global Politics: Ethical Reflexivity''. Routledge Press (2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reflectivism and post-positivism ==
Reflectivist approaches include such approaches as [[Constructivism (international relations)|constructivism]], [[Feminist theory|feminism]], [[Poststructuralism|post-structuralism]], [[Postcolonialism|post-colonialism]] and [[Critical Theory]].  The challenge launched by these approaches against rationalist approaches, which have largely dominated the IR discipline for the past three decades, was linked to the "Third Debate in International Relations"&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Lapid, "The Third Debate: On the Prospects of International Theory in a Post-Positivist Era", ''International Studies Quarterly'' 33, 3 (Sept. 1989).&lt;/ref&gt; between [[Positivism|positivists]] and [[Postpositivism|post-positivists]]/[[Antipositivism|anti-positivists]]. (The first two disciplinary "Great Debates" are supposed to have pitted (1) [[Realism (international relations)|realists]] vs. so-called "[[Idealism in international relations theory|idealists]]", and (2) [[Behavioralism|behaviouralists]] vs. so-called "traditionalists", the latter favouring historical methods and insights from [[political philosophy]].) Although the large majority of reflectivists oppose [[Positivism#Positivism in science today|positivism]], it might be a mistake to equate reflectivism with post-positivism or anti-positivism, as [[Constructivism (international relations)#Recent developments|(conventional) constructivists]] who are positivist in orientation would nevertheless fall under Keohane's description.  Confusion may be compounded by the fact that in International Relations theory, rationalism&lt;ref&gt;On which, see e.g. Miles Kahler, "Rationality in International Relations", ''International Organization'' 52, 4 (Autumn 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; and positivism can often be (erroneously) equated.&lt;ref&gt;That positivism and rationalism are not synonymous is noted e.g. by Milja Kurki and Colin Wight, "International Relations and Social Science", in Timothy Dunne, Milja Kurki and Steve Smith (eds.), ''International Relations Theories: Discipline and Diversity''.  Oxford University Press (2007), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; There are many positivist political scientists who do not adopt [[Rational choice theory|rational-choice]] assumptions.

Some mainstream International Relations scholars, dismissing the importance or value of non-positivist approaches to social science, have reframed the rationalism-reflectivism debate narrowly, as a debate between [[Rationalist-constructivist debate|rationalism and ("conventional") constructivism]], construed as the two major [[Social theory|social theories]] (or "[[Ontology|ontologies]]") of (mainstream) International Relations theory. The rationalism-constructivism debate drew considerable attention within the mainstream at the turn of the 21st century, with some rejecting the starkness of the opposition itself and asserting a fundamental compatibility, or possibility of synthesis, between the two approaches.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. James Fearon and Alexander Wendt, "Rationalism v. Constructivism: A Skeptical View", in Walter Carlsnaes, Thomas Risse and Beth Simmons (eds.), ''Handbook of International Relations'', 1st edn. SAGE (2002), pp. 52-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of reflectivist approaches==
The main criticisms of reflectivist approaches stem from the [[epistemology|epistemological]] differences between reflectivism and what in the social sciences has come to be known as [[positivism]]. Since the 1970s, mainstream International Relations theory has become increasingly, and more insistently, positivist in epistemological orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Maliniak, Amy Oakes, Susan Peterson and Michael J. Tierney, "The International Relations Discipline, 1980-2006", paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the American Political Science Association, Chicago (2007), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The typical reflectivist rejection of positivist assumptions and methods has led to criticism that the approach cannot make reliable statements about the outside world and even that it has repudiated the entire "social science enterprise".&lt;ref&gt;In reference to "postmodernism", for example, see Peter Katzenstein, Robert Keohane and Stephen Krasner, "International Organization at Fifty: Exploration and Contestation in the Study of World Politics", ''International Organization'' 52, 4 (Autumn 1998), p. 678.&lt;/ref&gt; Such criticisms are widespread in American political science, and reflectivism is not generally popular in U.S.-based IR scholarship, especially when compared with scholarship originating in Europe and the third world.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Ole Waever, "The Sociology of a Not So International Discipline:  American and European Developments in International Relations", ''International Organization'' 52, 4 (1998); Thomas Biersteker, "The Parochialism of Hegemony:  Challenges for 'American' International Relations", in Arlene Tickner and Ole Waever (eds.), ''International Relations Scholarship Around the World:  Worlding Beyond the West''.  Routledge (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Tory Higgins]] regarding people's [[perceptions]] in the [[decision making]] process. RFT examines the relationship between the [[motivation]] of a person and the way in which they go about achieving their [[goal]].&lt;ref&gt;Higgins, E: "Making a Good Decision: Value From Fit", ''American Psychologist'' 55(11):1217&lt;/ref&gt; RFT posits two separate and independent self-regulatory orientations: prevention and promotion (Higgins, 1997).

This psychological [[theory]], like many others, is applied in [[communication]], specifically in the subfields of [[nonverbal communication]] and [[persuasion]].Chronic regulatory focus is measured using the Regulatory Focus Questionnaire (Higgins et al., 2001) or the Regulatory Strength measure. Momentary regulatory focus can be primed or induced.

==Background==

===Regulatory fit theory===
To understand RFT, it is important to understand another of [[E. Tory Higgins]]' [[theories]]: regulatory fit theory. When a person believes that there is "fit", they will involve themselves more in what they are doing and "feel right" about it.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Higgins, E. T. (2005). Value From Regulatory Fit. Current Directions in Psychological Science, 14(4), 209–213. {{doi|10.1111/j.0963-7214.2005.00366.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|209}}  Regulatory fit should not directly affect the [[hedonic]] occurrence of a thing or occasion, but should influence a person's assurance in their reaction to the [[Object (philosophy)|object]] or event.

Regulatory fit theory suggests that a match between orientation to a goal and the means used to approach that goal produces a state of regulatory fit that both creates a feeling of rightness about the goal pursuit and increases task engagement (Higgins, 2001, 2005). Regulatory fit intensifies responses, such as the value of a chosen object, persuasion, and job satisfaction&lt;ref&gt;Kruglanski, A. W., Pierro, A., &amp; Higgins, E. T. (2007). Regulatory Mode and Preferred Leadership Styles: How Fit Increases Job Satisfaction. Basic and Applied Social Psychology, 29(2), 137–149. {{doi|10.1080/01973530701331700}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Regulatory fit does not increase the assessment of a [[decision making|decision]]; instead when someone feels "right" about their decision, the [[experience]] of "correctness and importance" is transferred to the ensuing assessment of the chosen [[Object (philosophy)|object]], increasing its superficial worth.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Avnet, T: "Locomotion, assessment, and regulatory fit: Value transfer from 'how' to 'what'", Journal of Experimental Psychology 39(5):525&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that the "feeling right" [[experience]] can then sway [[retrospective]] or prospective evaluations.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Regulatory fit can be manipulated incidentally (outside the context of interest) or integrally (within the context of interest).

===Definition===
RFT refers to when a person pursues a [[goal]] in a way that maintains the person's own personal [[Value (personal and cultural)|value]]s and [[beliefs]], also known as ''regulatory orientation''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; This [[theory]] operates on the basic [[principle]] that people embrace [[pleasure]] but avoid [[suffering|pain]], and they then maintain their regulatory fit based on this standard.

The ''regulatory focus'' is basically the way in which someone approaches pleasure but avoids pain. An individual's regulatory focus concentrates on desired end-states, and the approach [[motivation]] used to go from the current state to the desired end-state. This theory differentiates between a ''promotion-focus'' on [[hope]]s and accomplishments, also known as gains. This focus is more concerned with higher level gains such as advancement and accomplishment.&lt;ref name=Higgins&gt;Higgins, E: "Achievement orientations from subjective histories of success: promotion pride versus prevention pride", ''European Journal of Social Psychology''. 31(1):4&lt;/ref&gt;

Another focus is the ''prevention-focus'' based on [[safety]] and [[moral responsibility|responsibilities]], also known as non-losses. This focus emphasizes security and safety by following the guidelines and the rules.&lt;ref name=Higgins/&gt;

These two regulatory focuses regulate the influences that a person would be exposed to in the [[decision-making]] process, and determine the different ways they achieve their goal, as discussed by RFT. An individual's regulatory orientation is not necessarily fixed. While individuals have [[Habit (psychology)|chronic]] tendencies towards either promotion or prevention, these preferences may not hold for all situations. Furthermore, a specific regulatory focus can be [[wikt:induce|induced]].

The [[Value (ethics)|value]] taken from interaction and goal attainment can be either positive or negative. The decision has positive value when people attempt to attain their goal in a way that fits their regulatory orientation and it will have negative value when people attempt to attain their goal in a way that does not fit their regulatory orientation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Regulatory fit allows value to be created by intensifying the commitment, based on one of the regulatory focus orientations. Making [[choices]] and fulfilling [[objective (goal)|objective]]s are considered as activities, and with any activity, people can be more or less involved. When this involvement is strong, it can intensify the feelings and values about this activity, and the approach to the activity determines whether they are or are not satisfied with the outcome and method of achieving the outcome.

This theory has noteworthy implications for increasing the value of life.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} For example, in [[interpersonal]] conflict, if each person experiences "fit", each one will be satisfied with and committed to the outcome. In the broad sense, for people to appreciate their own lives, they need to be satisfied and "feel right" about what they are doing, and the way they are doing it.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{rp|210}} If it is not satisfying, it is known as "non-fit", and they will not reach their desired goal.

===Goal attainment and motivation===
Regulatory focus theory, according to Higgins, views motivation in a way that allows an understanding of the foundational ways we approach a task or a [[goal]].&lt;ref&gt;Higgins, E. (1997, December) Beyond pleasure and pain. ''American Psychologist'', 52(12):1281&lt;/ref&gt; Different factors can motivate people during goal pursuit, and we self-regulate our methods and processes during our goal pursuit. RFT proposes that motivational strength is enhanced when the manner in which people work toward a goal sustains their regulatory orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Spiegel, S: "How regulatory fit enhances motivational strength during goal pursuit", European Journal of Social Psychology. 34(1):40&lt;/ref&gt; Achieving a goal in a way that is consistent to a person's regulatory orientation leads to an [[individual]] sense of importance to the event. The impact of [[motivation]] is considered calculated and this creates a greater sense of commitment to the goal. The more strongly an individual is engaged (i.e., involved, occupied, fully engrossed) in an activity, the more intense the motivational force experienced. Engagement is of great importance to attain and motivate in order to reach a goal. Engagement serves as intensifier of the directional component of the value experience. An individual who is strongly engaged in a goal pursuits will experience a positive target more positively and a negative target more negatively.

Individuals can pursue different goals with diverse regulatory orientations and in unlike ways. There are two different kinds of regulatory orientations that people use to obtain their goals: ''promotion-focus orientation'' and ''prevention-focus orientation''. These terms are derived from [[E. Tory Higgins]]'s Theory of Regulatory Focus. In which, he adds to the notion that people regulate their goal-oriented behavior in two very distinct ways, coined ''promotion-focus orientation'' and ''prevention-focus orientation''

[[E. Tory Higgins]] uses this example: there is Student A and Student B, and they both have the shared goal to make an ''A'' in a class they are both taking in college. Student A uses a ''promotion-focus orientation'' which slants them towards achieving their goal and towards advancement, growth and life accomplishment. This would cause Student A to view the goal as an [[ideal (ethics)|ideal]] that satisfies their need for accomplishment. Student B uses a ''prevention-focus orientation'' where the goal is something that should be realized because it fulfills their need for [[security]], [[Safety|protection]] and prevention of negative outcomes. Student A uses an eager approach where they read extra materials to obtain their goal of an ''A''. Student B uses a vigilant approach where they become more detail oriented and pay careful attention to completing all of the course requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, R., &amp; Buss, D. (2009). Personality psychology: domains of knowledge about human nature. (4th ed., p. 388).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Completed RFT flowchart 3.jpg]]

Both forms of regulatory orientation can work to fulfill goals, but the choice of [[orientation (mental)|orientation]] is based on individual [[preference]]s and style. When a person pursues their goal in the focus that fits their regulatory orientation, they are more likely to pursue their goal more eagerly and aggressively than if they were using the other focus.In this case each student has different styles. They both feel more comfortable in persuading their goal. The outcome in this experiment would have been different if the students were given an undesirable choice.

When people make decisions, they often envision the possible "[[pleasure]] or [[suffering|pain]]" of the possible outcomes that the focus orientation will produce.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{rp|209}} A person imagining making a pleasing choice is more likely to engage in promotion-focus orientation because envisioning the possible outcome of success maintains eagerness about the outcome but does not place importance on [[Vigilance (psychology)|vigilance]]. A person imagining the possible [[suffering|pain]] by making an undesirable choice maintains more vigilance but less eagerness.

A person with promotion-focus orientation is more likely to remember the occasions where the goal is pursued by using eagerness approaches and less likely to remember occasions where the goal is pursued by vigilance approaches. A person with prevention-focus orientation is more likely to remember events where the goal is pursued by means of vigilance than if it was pursued using eagerness approaches.

==Application==

===Regulatory focus theory and persuasion===
When relating regulatory focus theory to [[persuasion]], it is important to remember that RFT is a [[goal]]-attainment [[theory]], and that RFT can spawn feelings of rightness/wrongness which in turn may produce formulations for [[judgment]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughn, A: "'This story is right on': The impact of regulatory fit on narrative engagement and persuasion", European Journal of Social Psychology. 39:448&lt;/ref&gt;

The feelings of rightness give an [[individual]] more commitment to the [[information]] coming in and therefore can avoid endangering their regulatory fit which in turn changes their regulatory focus and accepting a probable motive to change. If a person experiences feelings of wrongness they will suffer negative [[emotion]]s and deem the [[experience]] 
and information as a [[threat]] to their regulatory fit and therefore a threat to their regulatory focus and their [[goal]].

Studies have been done where fit and focus have been applied to show their applicability to [[consumer]] [[purchasing]], health advisories, and [[social policy]] issues.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;{{rp|446}} To be persuaded is to change your prior feelings, actions, and/or beliefs on a matter to where you agree with the persuader.

The "fit" involved in RFT plays a large role in such issues and stories because it can be a device to help an [[individual]] receive and review the experience during a particular [[message]] delivery. [[Positive reinforcement]] and [[feeling]]s of rightness while decoding the [[message]] creates a stronger engagement and relationship with processing the [[message]], and [[negative reinforcement]] and feelings of wrongness lessens the engagement and [[Attachment theory|attachment]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;{{rp|449}}

[[Researcher]]s found that targeting the two different regulatory focus orientations, and their coinciding types of fit, works as an effective process to aid in [[persuasive]] charm or pull when they introduced a manner of [[persuasion]] where the framing of the [[message]] was everything and the content was [[irrelevant]] to uphold or interrupt a person's regulatory fit and follow the pattern of logic used in regulatory orientation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;{{rp|446}}

Lee and Aaker (2004) conducted an [[experiment]] that involved whether or not to give their information in a prevention-focus- or promotion-focus-concerning way. The study involved an [[advertisement]] for a grape juice drink, which they split into two to create prevention-focus concerns (disease-preventing) and then promotion-focus concerns (energy enhancement).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;{{rp|449}} In doing so, they demonstrated that rather than trying to know each [[individual]] recipient's qualities, one needs only to start by nailing the focus (prevention/promotion) and then framing the [[message]] so that it creates that "rightness".

Some may confuse RFT with regulatory fit, regulatory relevance, message matching, and source attractiveness in such an example. The extent of similarities between closely related [[theories]] of RFT, such as ones stated above, make it hard to clarify when this theory is applicable or apparent in respect to the [[persuasion]] process.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;{{rp|444–5}}

===Regulatory focus theory and nonverbal communication===
RFT can be a useful outline for a better understanding of the effects of [[nonverbal]] cues in [[persuasion]] and [[impression formation]]. Regulatory Fit Theory suggests that the effect of a cue cannot be understood without remembering what the cue means given a recipient's focus orientation.&lt;ref name="Cesario 2008"&gt;Cesario, J., Higgins, E. (2008 May) Making Message Recipients "Feel Right": How Nonverbal Cues Can Increase Persuasion. Psychological Science, 19(5)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|419}}

[[Nonverbal]] cues can be used by the [[message]] source to vary delivery style, more specifically to convey eagerness or vigilance, of a given message in a way that will produce regulatory fit in message recipients of different focus orientations.

Advancement implies eager movement forward, so eagerness is conveyed by gestures that involve animated, broad opening movements such as hand movements projecting outward, forward leaning body positions, fast body movement, and fast [[speech]] rate. Caution implies vigilant carefulness, so vigilance should be conveyed by [[gesture]]s that show precision like slightly backward-leaning body positions, slower body movement, and slower speech rate.

An eager [[nonverbal]] delivery style will result in greater [[message]] effectiveness for promotion-focus recipients than for prevention-focus recipients, while the opposite is true for a vigilant [[nonverbal]] style.

There are various aspects, which may contribute to whether or not a [[message]]'s [[persuasive]] element is successful. One aspect is the effect of [[nonverbal]] cues and their association with [[persuasive]] appeals based on the [[message]] recipient's [[motivation]]al regulatory orientation. This determines the recipient's impression of the source during [[impression formation]].

Research has found that [[nonverbal]] cues are an essential element of most [[persuasive]] appeals. RFT creates the background that allows a [[prediction]] for when and for whom a [[nonverbal]] cue can have an effect on [[persuasion]]. When [[nonverbal]] cues and signals are used appropriately, they increase the effectiveness of [[persuasion]].&lt;ref name="Cesario 2008"/&gt;{{rp|415}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1984">The '''rhythm band''' is one of the primary methods of introducing children to playing music.  Children are given [[maracas]], [[tambourine]]s, [[Bell (instrument)|bell]]s, [[claves|rhythm sticks]] and other [[idiophone]]s with which to beat out a simple [[rhythm]] while the teacher plays a song, usually on the [[piano]]. Alternatively, the teacher does not play a melody but also a rhythm instrument, so that only rhythms are played. Children can also make a rhythm band "just for fun" for themselves, without a teacher.

[[File:Maracas &amp; Trillerpfeife.ogg|thumb|Very loud maracas, complemented with a whistle, are suitable instruments for an ear-deafening loud rhythm band.]]
[[File:Blockflötenkopf.ogg|thumb|The Soprano recorder is one of the most widespread musical instruments with children. Its head joint is a perfect noisemaker.]]
[[File:Rhythmband.ogg|thumb|An ear-deafening loud rhythm band with very loud rhythm instruments and noisemakers]]
If the participants like very loud music, [[noisemaker]]s like the [[pea whistle]], the [[Recorder_(educational_uses)#Unconventional_uses|recorder head joint]], the [[vuvuzela]] or the [[ratchet (instrument)|ratchet]] can be included into the rhythm band, as well as other very loud rhythm instruments like the [[snare drum]].

Rhythm bands are usually found in [[nursery school]]s or [[kindergarten]]s, but of course children also can make a rhythm band at home. Melodic instruments are introduced to the children in the first or second year of regular school. But in principle, a rhythm band can be made in every age, with more difficult rhrythms if the participants are older.

It is not uncommon for adult musical organizations to employ numerous rhythm players,  as in [[Latin American music]], or to distribute rhythm instruments for audience members to accompany a live performance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3247">The '''sacrifice of the intellect''' (''sacrificium intellectus'', sometimes rendered in Italian, ''sacrifizio dell'intelletto'') is a concept associated with [[Christian]] devotion, particularly with the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] order. It was the "third sacrifice" demanded by the founder of the Jesuits, [[St. Ignatius Loyola]], who required

&lt;blockquote&gt;besides entire outward submission to command, also the complete identification of the inferior's will with that of the superior . [Loyola] lays down that the superior is to be obeyed simply as such and as standing in the place of God, without reference to his personal wisdom, [[piety]] or discretion; that any obedience which falls short of making the superior's will one's own, in inward affection as well as in outward effect, is lax and imperfect; that going beyond the letter of command, even in things abstractly good and praise-worthy, is disobedience, and that the "sacrifice of the [[intellect]]" is the third and highest grade of obedience, well pleasing to God, when the inferior not only wills what the superior wills, but thinks what he thinks, submitting his judgment, so far as it is possible for the will to influence and lead the judgment.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, 11th edition, "JESUIT". [http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/JEE_JUN/JESUITS.html Available online.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The concept was taken up in a more individualistic sense by the [[Jansenist]] thinker [[Blaise Pascal]], and particularly by the [[existentialist]] thinker [[Søren Kierkegaard]], who thought that the act of faith requires a leap into the void, which amounts to a sacrifice of the intellect and reason.&lt;ref&gt;S. Kierkegaard, ''Fear and Trembling.'' (Copenhagen: 1843)&lt;/ref&gt; This was quintessentially expressed in the traditional dictum, ''[[credo quia absurdum]]'', "I believe because it is absurd." This view of faith is rejected by the [[Catholic church]], which regards [[reason]] as a path towards direct knowledge of God.&lt;ref&gt;See St. [[Thomas Aquinas]], ''[[Summa Theologica]]''; Pope [[John Paul II]], [[encyclical]] ''[[Fides et ratio]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase is often used in a pejorative sense in writings on the [[psychology]] and [[sociology]] of [[religion]] - e.g.:

*[[Max Weber]] states: "There is absolutely no 'unbroken' religion working as a vital force, which is not compelled at ''some'' point to demand the ''credo non quod, sed credo quia absurdum'' - the "sacrifice of the intellect.""&lt;ref&gt;Max Weber, "World Rejection and Theodicy", ch.8. See H.H. Gerth and C.W. Mills, ''From Max Weber: essays in sociology'' (1948, 2002), p.352&lt;/ref&gt;
*According to [[Paul Pruyser]], "Sacrifice of the intellect, demanded by a good many religious movements and blithely if not joyously made by a good many religious persons, is surely one of the ominous features of neurotic religion."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Pruyser, "The Seamy Side of Current Religious Beliefs," in H. Newton Maloney &amp; Bernard Spilka, eds. ''Religion in Psychodynamic Perspective: The Contributions of Paul Pruyser'' (Oxford 1991): 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sediments make the water appear brownish-grey; they are an indicator of increased [[Surface runoff#Effects of surface runoff|water runoff]], [[land degradation]], [[erosion]] due to intensive industrialized land use, land sealing, and poor soil management.]]

'''Sediment''' is a naturally occurring material that is broken down by processes of [[weathering]] and [[erosion]], and is subsequently [[sediment transport|transported]] by the action of wind, water, or ice, and/or by the force of [[gravity]] acting on the particles. For example, [[sand]] and [[silt]] can be carried in [[suspension (chemistry)|suspension]] in river water and on reaching the sea bed deposited by [[sedimentation]] and if buried, may eventually become [[sandstone]] and [[siltstone]] ([[sedimentary rock]]s).

Sediments are most often transported by water ([[fluvial|fluvial processes]]), but also wind ([[aeolian processes]]) and [[glacier]]s. Beach sands and [[stream channel|river channel]] deposits are examples of fluvial transport and [[deposition (geology)|deposition]], though sediment also often settles out of slow-moving or standing water in lakes and oceans. Desert sand dunes and [[loess]] are examples of aeolian transport and deposition.  [[Glacial]] [[moraine]] deposits and [[till]] are ice-transported sediments.

== Classification ==
[[File:Sediment in the Gulf of Mexico.jpg|thumb|Sediment in the [[Gulf of Mexico]]]]
[[File:Sediment off the Yucatan Peninsula.jpg|thumb|Sediment off the [[Yucatán Peninsula]]]]

Sediment can be classified based on its [[Particle size (grain size)|grain size]] and/or its composition.

===Grain size===
{{main|Particle size (grain size)}}
{{see also|soil texture|Unified Soil Classification System}}

Sediment size is measured on a log base 2 scale, called the "Phi" scale, which classifies particles by size from "colloid" to "booulder".

===Composition===
Composition of sediment can be measured in terms of:
* parent [[Rock (geology)|rock]] [[lithology]]
* [[mineral]] composition
* [[chemical]] make-up.

This leads to an ambiguity in which [[clay]] can be used as both a size-range and a composition (see [[clay mineral]]s).

== Sediment transport ==
[[File:StoneFormationInWater.jpg|thumb|Sediment builds up on human-made breakwaters because they reduce the speed of water flow, so the stream cannot carry as much sediment load.]]
[[File:Glacial Transportation and Deposition.jpg|thumb|Glacial transport of boulders. These boulders will be deposited as the glacier retreats.]]

{{main|Sediment transport}}
{{see also|Rouse number}}

Sediment is transported based on the strength of the flow that carries it and its own size, volume, density, and shape. Stronger flows will increase the lift and drag on the particle, causing it to rise, while larger or denser particles will be more likely to fall through the flow.

=== Fluvial processes: rivers, streams, and overland flow ===

====Particle motion====
Rivers and streams carry sediment in their flows. This sediment can be in a variety of locations within the flow, depending on the balance between the upwards velocity on the particle (drag and lift forces), and the [[terminal velocity|settling velocity]] of the particle. These relationships are shown in the following table for the [[Rouse number]], which is a ratio of sediment fall velocity to upwards velocity.

&lt;math&gt;\textbf{Rouse}=\frac{\text{Settling velocity}}{\text{Upwards velocity from lift and drag}}=\frac{w_s}{\kappa u_*}&lt;/math&gt;

where
* &lt;math&gt;w_s&lt;/math&gt; is the fall velocity
* &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; is the [[von Kármán constant]]
* &lt;math&gt;u_*&lt;/math&gt; is the [[shear velocity]]
[[File:Hjulströms diagram en.PNG|thumb|{{center|[[Hjulström curve]]: The velocities of currents required for erosion, transportation, and deposition (sedimentation) of sediment particles of different sizes.}}]]
{| class="wikitable"

|-
|[[Suspended load]]: 100% Suspended
|&gt;0.8, &lt;1.2
|-
|[[Wash load]]
|&lt;0.8
|}

If the upwards velocity is approximately equal to the settling velocity, sediment will be transported downstream entirely as [[suspended load]]. If the upwards velocity is much less than the settling velocity, but still high enough for the sediment to move (see [[Sediment transport#Initiation of motion|Initiation of motion]]), it will move along the bed as [[bed load]] by rolling, sliding, and [[Saltation (geology)|saltating]] (jumping up into the flow, being transported a short distance then settling again). If the upwards velocity is higher than the settling velocity, the sediment will be transported high in the flow as [[wash load]].

As there are generally a range of different particle sizes in the flow, it is common for material of different sizes to move through all areas of the flow for given stream conditions.

==== Fluvial bedforms ====
{{main|Bedform}}
[[File:Ripples mcr1.JPG|thumb|Modern asymmetric ripples developed in sand on the floor of the Hunter River, New South Wales, Australia. Flow direction is from right to left.]]
[[File:Sinuous dunes mcr1.JPG|thumb|Sinuous-crested dunes exposed at low tide in the Cornwallis River near Wolfville, Nova Scotia]]
[[File:Channel-StellartonFm-CoalburnPit.JPG|thumb|Ancient channel deposit in the Stellarton Formation ([[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]]), Coalburn Pit, near Thorburn, Nova Scotia.]]

Sediment motion can create self-organized structures such as [[ripple marks|ripple]]s, [[dune]]s, or [[antidune]]s on the river or stream [[stream bed|bed]]. These bedforms are often preserved in sedimentary rocks and can be used to estimate the direction and magnitude of the flow that deposited the sediment.

==== Surface runoff ====
[[Overland flow]] can erode soil particles and transport them downslope. The erosion associated with overland flow may occur through different methods depending on meteorological and flow conditions.
* If the initial impact of rain droplets dislodges soil, the phenomenon is called rainsplash erosion.
* If overland flow is directly responsible for sediment entrainment but does not form gullies, it is called "sheet erosion".
* If the flow and the substrate permit channelization, gullies may form; this is termed "gully erosion".

==== Key fluvial depositional environments ====
The major [[fluvial]] (river and stream) environments for deposition of sediments include:
* [[River delta|Deltas]] (arguably an intermediate environment between fluvial and marine)
* [[Point bar]]s
* [[Alluvial fan]]s
* [[Braided river]]s
* [[Oxbow lake]]s
* [[Levee]]s
* [[Waterfall]]s

===Aeolian processes: wind===
{{main|Aeolian processes}}
Wind results in the transportation of fine sediment and the formation of sand dune fields and soils from airborne dust.

===Glacial processes===
[[File:GLMsed.jpg|thumb|Glacial sediments from Montana]]
Glaciers carry a wide range of sediment sizes, and deposit it in [[moraine]]s.

===Mass balance===
{{main|Exner equation}}

The overall balance between sediment in transport and sediment being deposited on the bed is given by the [[Exner equation]]. This expression states that the rate of increase in bed elevation due to deposition is proportional to the amount of sediment that falls out of the flow. This equation is important in that changes in the power of the flow change the ability of the flow to carry sediment, and this is reflected in the patterns of erosion and deposition observed throughout a stream. This can be localized, and simply due to small obstacles; examples are scour holes behind boulders, where flow accelerates, and deposition on the inside of [[meander]] bends. Erosion and deposition can also be regional; erosion can occur due to [[dam removal]] and [[base level]] fall. Deposition can occur due to dam emplacement that causes the river to pool and deposit its entire load, or due to base level rise.

== Shores and shallow seas ==
Seas, oceans, and lakes accumulate sediment over time. The sediment can consist of ''terrigenous'' material, which originates on land, but may be deposited in either terrestrial, marine, or lacustrine (lake) environments, or of sediments (often biological) originating in the body of water. Terrigenous material is often supplied by nearby rivers and streams or reworked [[marine sediment]] (e.g. [[sand]]). In the mid-ocean, the exoskeletons of dead organisms are primarily responsible for sediment accumulation.

Deposited sediments are the source of [[sedimentary rock]]s, which can contain [[fossil]]s of the inhabitants of the body of water that were, upon death, covered by accumulating sediment. Lake bed sediments that have not solidified into rock can be used to determine past [[climate|climatic]] conditions.

=== Key marine depositional environments ===
[[File:EolianiteLongIsland.JPG|thumb|right|[[Holocene]] [[eolianite]] and a carbonate beach on [[Long Island, Bahamas]].]]
The major areas for deposition of sediments in the marine environment include:
* [[Littoral]] sands (e.g. beach sands, runoff river sands, coastal bars and spits, largely [[clastic]] with little faunal content)
* The continental shelf ([[silt]]y [[clay]]s, increasing marine faunal content).
* The shelf margin (low terrigenous supply, mostly [[calcite|calcareous]] faunal skeletons)
* The shelf slope (much more fine-grained silts and clays)
* Beds of estuaries with the resultant deposits called "[[bay mud]]".

One other depositional environment which is a mixture of fluvial and marine is the [[turbidite]] system, which is a major source of sediment to the deep [[sedimentary basin|sedimentary]] and [[Abyssal plain|abyssal basins]] as well as the deep [[oceanic trench]]es.

Any depression in a marine environment where sediments accumulate over time is known as a [[Sediment trap (geology)|sediment trap]].

The null point theory explains how sediment deposition undergoes a hydrodynamic sorting process within the marine environment leading to a seaward fining of sediment grain size.

==Environmental issues==
{{see also|Sediment transport#Applications}}

===Erosion and agricultural sediment delivery to rivers===
One cause of high sediment loads is [[slash and burn]] and [[shifting cultivation]] of [[tropical]] forests. When the ground surface is stripped of vegetation and then seared of all living organisms, the upper soils are vulnerable to both wind and water erosion. In a number of regions of the earth, entire sectors of a country have become erodible. For example, on the [[Madagascar]] high central [[plateau]], which constitutes approximately ten percent of that country's land area, most of the land area is devegetated, and gullies have eroded into the underlying soil in [[furrows]] typically in excess of 50 meters deep and one kilometer wide.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} This [[siltation]] results in discoloration of rivers to a dark red brown color and leads to fish kills.

Erosion is also an issue in areas of modern farming, where the removal of native vegetation for the cultivation and harvesting of a single type of crop has left the soil unsupported. Many of these regions are near rivers and drainages. Loss of soil due to erosion removes useful farmland, adds to sediment loads, and can help transport anthropogenic fertilizers into the river system, which leads to [[eutrophication]].

The Sediment Delivery Ratio (SDR) is fraction of gross erosion (interill, rill, gully and stream erosion) that is expected to be delivered to the outlet of the river.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fernandez|first=C.|last2=Wu|first2=J.

===Coastal Development and Sedimentation near Coral Reefs===

Watershed development near coral reefs is a primary cause of sediment-related coral stress.The stripping of natural vegetation in the watershed for development exposes soil to increased wind and rainfall, and as a result, can cause exposed sediment to become more susceptible to erosion and delivery to the marine environment during rainfall events. Sediment can negatively affect corals in many ways, such as by physically smothering them, abrading their surfaces, causing corals to expend energy during sediment removal, and causing algal blooms that can ultimately lead to less space on the seafloor where juvenile corals (polyps) can settle.

When sediments are introduced into the coastal regions of the ocean, the proportion of land, marine and organic-derived sediment that characterizes the seafloor near sources of sediment output is altered.    In addition, because the source of sediment (i.e. land, ocean, or organically) is often correlated with how coarse or fine sediment grain sizes that characterize an area are on average, grain size distribution of sediment will shift according to relative input of land (typically fine), marine (typically coarse), and organically-derived (variable with age) sediment.  These alterations in marine sediment characterize the amount of sediment that is suspended in the water column at any given time and sediment-related coral stress.

In [[fiction]], a '''subplot''' is a secondary strand of the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]]  that is a supporting side story for any story or the main plot. Subplots may connect to main plots, in either time and place or in thematic significance. Subplots often involve supporting characters, those besides the [[protagonist]] or [[antagonist]]. Subplots may also intertwine with the main plot at some point in a story.

Subplots are distinguished from the main plot by taking up less of the action, having fewer significant events occur, with less impact on the "world" of the work, and occurring to less important characters.  

In [[screenwriting]], a subplot is referred to as a "B story" or a "C story," etc.

The '''Swiss Institute of Comparative Law''' ({{lang-fr|Institut suisse de droit comparé}} (ISDC), {{lang-de|Schweizerisches Institut für Rechtsvergleichung}}) is an agency of the [[federal administration of Switzerland]] charged with research and consultancy in [[comparative law]]. 

Its principal mission is to furnish opinions about foreign law to the administration, the courts and the public. It also operates a publicly accessible research library, which holds 360,000 volumes and served 6,000 visitors in 2008.

The institute was founded through federal statute in 1978. It is located on the campus of the [[University of Lausanne]] and is administratively attached to the [[Federal Department of Justice and Police]]. It employs a staff of about 30 researchers, librarians and clerical personnel.

In [[Classical architecture]] a '''term''' or '''terminal figure''' (plural: '''terms''' or '''termini''') is a human head and bust that continues as a square  tapering pillar-like form.

The name derives from [[Terminus (god)|Terminus]], the Roman god of boundaries and boundary markers. If the bust is of [[Hermes]] as protector of boundaries in ancient Greek culture, with male genitals interrupting the plain base at the appropriate height, it may be called a '''[[herma]]''' or '''herm'''.  The crime of [[Alcibiades]] and his drinking-mates, for which [[Socrates]] eventually indirectly paid with his life, was the desecration of herm figures through Athens in the dead of night.

At the [[Temple of Artemis]] at Ephesus, the Lady of Ephesus, whom the Greeks identified with Artemis, was a many-breasted goddess encased in a tapering term, from which her feet protruded. (See illustration at [[Temple of Artemis]]).

In the architecture and the painted architectural decoration of the European [[Renaissance]] and the succeeding [[Classicism|Classical styles]], term figures are quite common. Often they represent minor deities associated with fields and vineyards and the edges of woodland, [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] and [[faun]]s and [[Bacchante]]s especially, and they may be draped with garlands of fruit and flowers.

Term figures were a particularly characteristic feature of the 16th-century style in furniture and carved interior decoration that is called [[Antwerp Mannerism]]. Engravings disseminated the style through Germany and England.

Term figures as table supports or employed as candlestands (French ''guéridon'') were characteristic of the Late Baroque Louis XIV style in France, the Low Countries and England, revived in the neo-Palladian furniture designed by [[William Kent]] and employed again in the French Empire style of the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internetantiquegazette.com/furniture/1726_gueridon_definition/|title=Gueridon – definition|publisher=Internet Antique Gazette|accessdate=21 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Reasons that Induced Dr. S. to Write a Poem Call'd the Lady's Dressing Room''' is a poem by [[Lady Mary Wortley Montagu]] published in 1734. The poem is a [[satire]] and was written in response to a poem by [[Jonathan Swift]] entitled "[[The Lady's Dressing Room]]". The poem is part of a poetic duel between the two poets, in which Montagu attacks Swift's character and suggests that he wrote "The Lady's Dressing Room" as a result of his sexual frustration and impotence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lorenzo Modia|first=Maria Jesus|title=Teaching Eighteenth-century Poetic Satire with a Competency-based  Approach: Jonathan Swift and Lady Mary Wortley Montagu|journal=International Education Studies|date=December 2011|volume=4|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both poems have been seen as satires of gender roles and stereotypes of the time, although Swift's poem has received greater praise and recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weise|first=Wendys|title=Seeing and the Difference It Makes: Ocularity, Gender, and Space in Swift's and Montagu's "Dressing Room" Satires|journal=Taylor &amp; Francis Group, Women's Studies|year=2006|volume=35|issue=8|pages=707–738|doi=10.1080/00497870600945600}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
The poem is a narrative where "the Doctor", referring to [[Jonathan Swift]], is the protagonist. The tale relates his journey one day to meet with a prostitute named Betty that he has been attempting to woo. After paying for her services, however, he finds himself experiencing an episode of impotence. He proceeds to blame his sexual failure on Betty and she returns his blame, allocating it to his old age. The Doctor insists that his money be returned to him but Betty refuses to do so. He swears vengeance, saying, "I'll so describe your dressing room / The very Irish shall not come". Here Montagu references Swift's poem, "[[The Lady's Dressing Room]]", and also slights Swift's Irish nationality. Betty the prostitute replies with another reference to Swift's poem saying, "I'm glad you'll write. / You'll furnish paper when I shite."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=al.]|first=general editors, Joseph Black ... [et|title=The restoration and the eighteenth century.|year=2006|publisher=Broadview Press|location=Peterborough, Ontario [u.a.]|isbn=1-55111-611-1|edition=Repr. with corrections.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
The poem's biting satire obviously overtly attacks Dr. Swift and his writings. It also actively accuses Swift of Misogyny and sexism. Swift's poem was highly invasive as it chronicles the unwanted entry of a man into a lady's dressing room where he sees the woman no longer as an elevated goddess, but as a normal human being with normal bodily functions. In his poem he attacks womankind, abasing them as vile and disgusting creatures. More importantly, the scene he depicts "unveils" the myth of femininity. The 18th century required women to be flawless, gentle and pure in public and private. Swift mocks them in both spheres, deeply desecrating the female image. He also brings their integrity into question, suggesting that they, through attempting to be clean, are hiding their inherent filthiness. Not everyone found Swift's satire tasteful, but his writing was very influential. 

Montagu's poem, however, suggests that the hatred of women that inspired Swift to write his poem is actually just a result of his own sexual frustration and incapacity. In denouncing Swift's misogynistic views, Montagu also criticizes his pessimism in other subject areas. Swift was known as a satirist to be extremely cynical and critical of nearly everything. This poem stands to reason that all of Swift's pessimism is a result of internal issues and failures. Montagu mocks the double standard required for women; Swift invalidates females in both the public and private sphere and Montagu refutes this with cleverly pointed satire.

For both poems, the form is very significant. Their use of satire made their work possible. They could raise eyebrows without starting fires and question contradictory systems and values while eliciting pleased smiles. This form popularized their works.

'''Theming''' refers to "the use of an overarching theme...to create a holistic and integrated spatial organization of a consumer venue.”&lt;ref name="Lukas"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lukas|first=Scott A.|date=2007|title=The Themed Space: Locating Culture, Nation and Self|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield}}&lt;/ref&gt; A theme is “a unifying or dominant idea or motif”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=theming|url=http://www.dictionary.reference.com/browse/theming|website=www.dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;, so theming is the process of designing and constructing an object or space so that “the particular subject or idea on which the style of something is based”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=theme|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/theme|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; is made clear through the “synthesis of recognizable symbols with spatial forms.”&lt;ref name="Lukas" /&gt;

Theming is applied to an environment in order to create a memorable and meaningful experience for individuals or groups that visit the space, and can be expressed through the use of architecture, decor, signage, music and sound design, costuming, integrated technology, special effects, and other techniques.&lt;ref name="Lukas" /&gt; Theming is increasingly used to create physical spaces for "[[experiential marketing]],” in which consumers can connect and interact with a brand.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eventbrite.com/blog/experiential-marketing-definition-ds00/ Experiential Marketing, Defined — and Examples to Inspire You]. Retrieved 2018-03-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, most large-scale themed environments were primarily designed for entertainment, so the industry that creates these venues is known as themed entertainment. Examples include [[theme parks]], water parks, museums, zoos, visitor centers, casinos, [[theme restaurants]], and resorts.&lt;ref name="TEA"&gt;[http://www.teaconnect.org/About-us/About-us/ About Us]. Themed Entertainment Association. Retrieved 2018-03-02.&lt;/ref&gt; Theming is also increasingly used on smaller scale projects, including parties and product launches, to make these events more impactful.&lt;ref name="Quainton"&gt;{{cite article|last=Quainton|first=David|date=August 2009|title=Prepare for Impact (Advice Bureau Theming)|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/43616310/prepare-impact|publisher=Event Magazine (UK)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common themes include holidays (such as [[Christmas]] and [[Valentine’s Day]]), historical eras (such as the [[Medieval Period]] and the [[American frontier]]), cultures (such as [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Polynesian culture]]), and literary genres (such as [[Fantasy]] and [[Science fiction]]).

==History==

Theming has been used in public spaces at least as far back as the [[World's fair|World’s Fairs]] of the Nineteenth Century. Professor Susan Ingram argues that the [[The Great Exhibition|Great Exhibition of 1851]] in London was, in effect, the world’s first theme park, utilizing theming to further its pro-industrial message, and reproducing foreign lands as spectacle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theoryofthemeparks.blogspot.com/2015/08/the-historical-development-of-themed.html The Historical Development of Themed Space: Susan Ingram on Industrial Europe and the Commodification of Leisure]. Retrieved 2018-03-02.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World's Columbian Exposition|World's Columbian Exposition of 1893]] in Chicago introduced a separate [[Midway (fair)|midway]], filled not only with attractions like the first [[Ferris Wheel]], but also exhibits of cultures from around the world, including reproductions of villages from many nations. Themed simulations, including the Italian Capri Grotto and a Hawaiian volcano, were made possible for the first time by combining electricity, theatrical displays, and mechanical devices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/4955/3787 Chicago World’s Fair of 1893: Marketing the modern imaginary of the city and urban everyday life through representation]. Retrieved 2018-03-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

Themed dining can also trace its roots to the late 1800s.

Dozens of so-called “programmatic” or “mimetic” style structures were built in the Los Angeles area in the interwar years of 1918-1941, many of them restaurants, including buildings shaped like animals, food, and vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://waterandpower.org/museum/Programmatic_Style_Architecture.html Early Los Angeles Programmatic-Style Buildings].

The forerunners to today’s themed mega-resorts were the [[El Rancho Vegas]], opened in 1941, and the [[New Frontier Hotel and Casino|Last Frontier]], opened in 1942, the first two properties on the [[Las Vegas Strip]], both with Wild West themes. They were followed by even more elaborately themed hotels, including [[Caesars Palace]] in 1966 and [[Circus Circus Las Vegas|Circus Circus]] in 1968.

The term “[[theme park]]” came into use circa 1960&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=theme park|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/theme-park|website=www.dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=theme park|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/theme%20park|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;, likely to describe the many parks built across the United States and around the world following the successful opening of [[Disneyland]] in 1955. Though arguably not the first theme park, Disneyland was the first amusement park to combine multiple named areas (“lands”) with different themes. Theme parks have followed this pattern ever since, including some that have explicitly copied Disneyland’s design.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bathroomreader.com/2013/11/5-disneyland-knockoffs-around-world/ 5 Disneyland Knockoffs From Around the World].

Theming has also been applied to retail environments. The advent of mass production led to the creation of large department stores in Europe in the late Nineteenth Century, and in an early example of theming, many used elaborate displays and windows to attract shoppers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hbs.edu/businesshistory/Documents/origin-and-development-of-markets.pdf The Origin and Development of Markets: A Business History Perspective].

==Scholarship==

In 1997, urbanist [[Mark Gottdiener]]’s ''The Theming of America: Dreams, Visions, and Commercial Spaces'' was published. It is considered by many to be the first serious work to explore the origins, nature, and future of themed environments.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.questia.com/library/727592/the-theming-of-america-dreams-visions-and-commercial The Theming of America: Dreams, Visions, and Commercial Spaces].

Also in 1997, the Canadian Centre for Architecture in Montreal presented ''The Architecture of Reassurance: Designing the Disney Theme Parks'', the first exhibition of some 350 objects from the archives of [[Walt Disney Imagineering]], including plans, drawings, paintings and models for the Disney theme parks and their attractions. Professor Karal Ann Marling curated the exhibit and wrote the principal essay for the accompanying 224 page book, which also included essays by Disney Imagineer [[Marty Sklar]], historian Neil Harris, art historian Erika Doss, geographer [[Yi-Fu Tuan]], and critic [[Greil Marcus]], as well as an interview with architect [[Frank Gehry]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cca.qc.ca/cca.media/files/9013/7952/CUTdisney_pressrelease.pdf CCA to Examine the Building of a Modern Myth, in ''The Architecture of Reassurance: Designing the Disney Theme Parks''].

Author Scott A. Lukas has written and edited numerous books and articles on themed entertainment, including his first, ''The Themed Space: Locating Culture, Nation, and Self'', published in 2007. He teaches on the subject of theme parks and themed spaces, video games, popular film, and various forms of popular culture and remaking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scottlukas.com/page12/index.html Bio].

In 2010, Dean Peter Weishar and Professor George Head began work on a themed entertainment design program at [[Savannah College of Art and Design]] (SCAD) in Savannah, Georgia. In the fall of 2012, the SCAD School of Film, Digital Media and Performing Arts separated into two schools: the School of Digital Media and the School of Entertainment Arts, which began offering the nation’s first M.F.A. in themed entertainment design. Peter Weishar went on to create the Themed Experience Institute program at [[Florida State University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teaconnect.org/TEA-blog-post/TEA-Advantage:-Peter-Weishar-themed-entertainment-academic-pioneer/6516 TEA Advantage: Peter Weishar, themed entertainment academic pioneer].

==Criticism==

As perhaps the best known example of theming, the theme park Disneyland has often been a target for criticism. In his overwhelmingly negative review, ''Disneyland and Las Vegas'', published in ''[[The Nation (United States)|The Nation]]'' upon the opening of the park, writer Julian Halevy lamented: {{Quote
|text=“As in the Disney movies, the whole world, the universe, and all man’s striving for dominion over self and nature, have been reduced to a sickening blend of cheap formulas packaged to sell…It’s dangerous and offensive.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/document/271509661/July-17-1955 Julian Halevy, “Disneyland and Las Vegas,” Nation, July 17, 1955]. Retrieved 2018-03-02.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Noted author [[Ray Bradbury]] responded with a letter to the editor, published three years later, titled ''Not Child Enough'': {{Quote
|text=“The world is full of people who, for intellectual reasons, steadfastly refuse to let go and enjoy themselves…I have a sneaking suspicion, after all is said and done, that Mr. Halevy truly loved Disneyland but is not man enough, or child enough, to admit it. I feel sorry for him.”&lt;ref&gt;Ray Bradbury, "Not Child Enough," Nation, June 28, 1958&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another notable criticism of theming, again targeting Disneyland and its guests, can be found in French sociologist [[Jean Baudrillard]]’s 1981 treatise ''[[Simulacra and Simulation]]'': {{Quote
|text=“Disneyland is presented as imaginary in order to make us believe that the rest is real, whereas all of Los Angeles and the America that surrounds it are no longer real, but belong to the hyperreal order and to the order of simulation…The imaginary of Disneyland is neither true nor false, it is a deterrence machine.”}}

Along with Baudrillard, the Italian writer [[Umberto Eco]] helped develop the idea of “[[hyperreality]],” or the world of "the Absolute Fake," in which imitations don't merely reproduce reality, but try to improve on it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transparencynow.com/eco.htm Traveling Through Hyperreality With Umberto Eco]. Retrieved 2018-03-02.&lt;/ref&gt; Eco traveled to tourist attractions across the United States and wrote frequently about "America's obsession with simulacra and counterfeit reality.”

More recently, concerns have been raised about theming’s role in influencing consumers, sometimes subconsciously, as part of experiential retailing or “shoppertainment.” Kim Einhorm, director of Theme Traders, points out that “theming becomes an invisible form of branding.”&lt;ref name="Quainton" /&gt; Indeed, because theming has become such a commonplace aspect of so many people’s everyday lives, the public is often unwilling or unable to effectively understand its consequences.&lt;ref name="Lukas" /&gt; Some have even argued that the growth of experiential marketing is contributing to a degraded quality of life by eliminating “contemplative time.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mngt.waikato.ac.nz/ejrot/cmsconference/2003/proceedings/criticalmarketing/Caru.pdf Antonella Carù and Bernard Cova, “A Critical Approach To Experiential Consumption: Fighting Against The Disappearance Of The Contemplative Time”]. Retrieved 2018-03-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industry==

In 1920, following the dissolution of several earlier organizations, the National Association of Amusement Parks (NAAP) was formed. In 1934 it merged with the American Association of Pools and Beaches (AAPB) to form the National Association of Amusement Parks, Pools, and Beaches (NAAPPB). After several name changes, it became the [[International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions]] in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaapa100years.org/timeline6 IAAPA Timeline]. Retrieved 2018-08-17.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, IAAPA represents more than 5,300 members from more than 100 countries, including many companies and individuals in the themed entertainment industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaapa.org/about-iaapa About IAAPA] Retrieved 2018-08-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Themed Entertainment Association]] was founded in 1991 to organize small businesses in the industry. Today it has some 1,300 members, and divisions around the world. It hosts annual conferences and presents awards to individuals, parks, attractions, exhibits, and experiences.&lt;ref name="TEA" /&gt;

A number of former employees of [[Walt Disney Imagineering]], Disney’s in-house design and construction subsidiary, went on to form their own themed entertainment companies, some of which later collaborated with Disney on theme park projects. [[Gary Goddard]] left Imagineering to start what became the Goddard Group, now known as Legacy | GGE. [[Bill Novey]] oversaw the special effects for Epcot Center and Tokyo Disneyland before leaving to start Art &amp; Technology, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blooloop.com/Article/Art-Technology-Bill-Novey-and-the-Business-of-Theme-Park-Special-Effects/190 |publisher=BloopLoop.com |title=Bill Novey and the Business of Theme Park Special Effects |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822175056/http://www.blooloop.com/Article/Art-Technology-Bill-Novey-and-the-Business-of-Theme-Park-Special-Effects/190 |archivedate=August 22, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bob Rogers (designer)| Bob Rogers]] left to found BRC Imagination Arts. [[Bran Ferren]] founded Associates &amp; Ferren, which was acquired by Disney in 1993. Ferren eventually left Disney to start another company, Applied Minds, LLC. [[Phil Hettema]] worked for both Disney and [[Universal Creative]] before starting [[Phil_Hettema#The_Hettema_Group|The Hettema Group]].

Other companies serve organizations and individuals looking to incorporate theming into offices, product launch events, and even parties. [https://www.themetraders.com/ Theme Traders] is a London-based event theming company that serves this niche.

The '''Ulster University's Transitional Justice Institute (TJI)''', is a law-led multidisciplinary [[research institute]] of [[Ulster University]] which is physically located at the [[Ulster University at Jordanstown|Jordanstown]], and [[Ulster University at Magee|Magee]] campuses. It was created in 2003, making it the first and longest-established university research centre on this theme.  In the 2014 ''[[Research Excellence Framework|Research Excellence Framework (REF)]]'' Law at Ulster University was ranked 4th overall in the UK. Ulster was ranked first for impact in law with 100% of impact rated as world-leading, the only University to achieve this in law.

Within the Institute, there are over 15 researchers based on the Jordanstown and Magee campuses of the university. In addition, the TJI has approximately 15 [[doctoral studies|doctoral students]] researching and studying towards their chosen topics. Visiting scholars and [[visiting professor]]s are often closely involved in research.

The institute is internationally recognised, receiving recognition from the [[American Society of International Law]] in 2006 with TJI scholars being awarded top book and article prize for ''creative and outstanding contributions to international legal scholarship''. Staff have been awarded the 2009 Hart SLSA Early Career Award and jointly awarded the 2009 [[British Society of Criminology]] Book Prize&lt;ref name="Louise Mallinder"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://transitionaljustice.ulster.ac.uk/staff_profiles/louise_mallinder.html | title=Louise Mallinder | accessdate=December 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the 2010 Basil Chubb Prize for the best PhD produced in any field of politics in an Irish university.&lt;ref name="Catherine O'Rourke"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://transitionaljustice.ulster.ac.uk/staff_profiles/catherine_orourke.html | title=Catherine O'Rourke | accessdate=December 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute is associated with the [[Transitional Justice Institute#External Links|Association of Human Rights Institutes (AHRI)]].&lt;ref name="Association of Human Rights Institutes List"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ahri-network.org/member-institutions | title=Member Institutes | publisher=Association of Human Rights Institutes (AHRI) | accessdate=December 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In line with the University's rebranding in October 2014 the institute updated its logo; the old logo can be found [[Transitional Justice Institute#External links|here]].

==Vision==
The TJI undertakes world-leading research on [[transitional justice]], [[conflict (process)|conflict]], [[international law]], [[human rights]] and [[gender equality]]. The TJI model of research is based on an innovative real-world oriented research strategy, involving external mentoring of early career staff, the development of a key theoretical conceptual foundation, the nurturing of research clusters within the Institute, a strong interdisciplinary focus, and a collaborative leadership mode.

The stated aims of the Institute are:&lt;ref name="About TJI"/&gt;
* To build a theoretical and practical understanding of the role of 'transitional justice', and the underlying relationship between justice and peace;
* To examine the role of the international and domestic legal systems and institutions in facilitating transition from conflict;
* To make links between the experience of Northern Ireland and international experience, so as to benefit both Northern Ireland and other contexts;
* To inform policy makers involved in peacemaking in local and international institutions; and
* To make visible and critically examine gendered experiences of transition.

==Research==
The Institute has four main research streams or clusters:
* Dealing with the Past
* Gender, Conflict and Transition
* Northern Ireland – Local and Global Perspectives
* Theory Method and Evaluation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4193">'''Uncertain inference''' was first described by [[C. J. van Rijsbergen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite | author=C. J. van Rijsbergen | title=A non-classical logic for information retrieval | publisher=The Computer Journal | pages=481–485 | year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a way to formally define a query and document relationship in [[Information retrieval]]. This formalization is a [[logical consequence|logical implication]] with an attached measure of uncertainty.

==Definitions==
Rijsbergen proposes that the measure of [[uncertainty]] of a document ''d'' to a query ''q'' be the probability of its logical implication, i.e.:

:&lt;math&gt;P(d \to q)&lt;/math&gt;

A user's query can be interpreted as a set of assertions about the desired document. It is the system's task to [[inference|infer]], given a particular document, if the query assertions are true. If they are, the document is retrieved.
In many cases the contents of documents are not sufficient to assert the queries. A [[knowledge base]] of facts and rules is needed, but some of them may be uncertain because there may be a probability associated to using them for inference. Therefore, we can also refer to this as ''plausible inference''. The [[plausibility]] of an inference &lt;math&gt;d \to q&lt;/math&gt; is a function of the plausibility of each query assertion. Rather than retrieving a document that exactly matches the query we should rank the documents based on their plausibility in regards to that query.
Since ''d'' and ''q'' are both generated by users, they are error prone; thus &lt;math&gt;d \to q&lt;/math&gt; is uncertain. This will affect the plausibility of a given query.

By doing this it accomplishes two things:
* Separate the processes of revising probabilities from the logic
* Separate the treatment of relevance from the treatment of requests

[[Multimedia]] documents, like images or videos, have different inference properties for each datatype. They are also different from text document properties. The framework of plausible inference allows us to measure and combine the probabilities coming from these different properties.

Uncertain inference generalizes the notions of [[autoepistemic logic]], where truth values are either known or unknown, and when known, they are true or false.

==Example==
If we have a query of the form:

:&lt;math&gt;q = A \wedge B \wedge C&lt;/math&gt;

where A, B and C are query assertions, then for a document D we want the probability:

:&lt;math&gt;P (D \to (A \wedge B \wedge C))&lt;/math&gt;

If we transform this into the [[conditional probability]] &lt;math&gt;P ((A \wedge B \wedge C) | D)&lt;/math&gt; and if the query assertions are independent we can calculate the overall probability of the implication as the product of the individual assertions probabilities.

==Further work==
Croft and Krovetz&lt;ref&gt;{{cite | title=Interactive retrieval office documents | url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/45410.45435 | author1=W. B. Croft | author2=R. Krovetz | year=1988 }}&lt;/ref&gt; applied uncertain inference to an information retrieval system for office documents they called ''OFFICER''. In office documents the independence assumption is valid since the query will focus on their individual attributes. Besides analysing the content of documents one can also query about the author, size, topic or collection for example. They devised methods to compare document and query attributes, infer their plausibility and combine it into an overall rating for each document. Besides that uncertainty of document and query contents also had to be addressed.

[[Probabilistic logic network]]s is a system for performing uncertain inference; crisp true/false truth values are replaced not only by a probability, but also by a confidence level, indicating the certitude of the probability.

[[Markov logic network]]s allow uncertain inference to be performed; uncertainties are computed using the [[maximum entropy principle]], in analogy to the way that [[Markov chain]]s describe the uncertainty of [[finite state machine]]s.

'''''Visible Language''''' is an American journal presenting visual communication research. Founded in 1967 as ''The Journal of Typographical Research'' by Merald Wrolstad, occasional ''Visible Language'' issues are co-edited with a guest editor-author. 

The journal was founded with the primary tenet of the journal being that reading and writing together form a new, separate, and autonomous language system. The journal has evolved to focus on research in visual communication. The journal has covered the subject of [[concrete poetry]], the [[Fluxus]] art movement, painted text, [[textual criticism]], the abstraction of symbols, [[articulatory synthesis]] and text, and the evolution of the page from print to on-screen display. Guest editor-authors have included [[Colin Banks]], [[John Cage]], [[Adrian Frutiger]], [[Dick Higgins]], [[Richard Kostelanetz]], [[Craig J Saper|Craig Saper]], and [[George Steiner]].

The journal was edited for 26 years (1987-2012) by Sharon Poggenpohl of the [[Illinois Institute of Technology|Illinois Institute of Technology's]] [[IIT Institute of Design|Institute of Design]], with administrative offices at the [[Rhode Island School of Design]]. It is currently edited by Mike Zender of the University of Cincinnati, which publishes and provides administrative offices for the journal.

[[File:William Ramsay Smith.jpg|thumb|right]]

Dr '''William Ramsay Smith''' {{Post-nominals|post-noms=[[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]]}} (27 November 1859 – 28 September 1937)&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; was a Scottish physician, educator, naturalist, [[anthropologist]] and civil servant, who was active in [[Australia]] later in his career.
It was during his time in Australia that Smith misappropriated the text of 'Legendary Tales of the Australian Abotigines' from the original indigenous author David Unaipon (b.28thSeptember 1872).ref. Legendary Tales ofthe Australian Aborigines, David Unaipon, Ed.  Stephen Muecke and Adam Shoemaker: The Miegunyah Press:2006.© The David Unaipon Estate 2001.

==Early life==
Smith was born in [[King Edward, Aberdeenshire]], [[Scotland]], the son of William Smith (a farm servant, and later stationmaster) and his wife Mary ''née'' MacDonald (domestic servant). They lived on the estate of Cairnbanno House near [[New Deer]]. He attended the nearby Cairnbanno Public School (which taught using the [[Madras School]] system - all pupils also teaching). Winning a [[Free Church of Scotland (1843-1900)|Free Church]] scholarship, from 1877 he studied arts at [[Edinburgh University]] and then attended [[Moray House Training College]] to train as a teacher for two years.&lt;ref name=adb&gt;

 |id2=smith-william-ramsay-8493
 |accessdate=4 August 2013
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
At 20 years of age Smith was appointed headmaster of [[Invergordon]] Public School, in [[Easter Ross]], but, due to an interest in [[physiology]], he returned to Edinburgh University to study arts and science. He then won an entrance scholarship for Medicine of £100 a year for three years. On completing his medical course in 1885 Smith was appointed assistant-professor of natural history, senior demonstrator of zoology at Edinburgh University. He graduated [[BSc]] (natural sciences) in 1888.

In 1889 'Illustrations of Zoology' was published which he had prepared in collaboration with J. S. Norwell. He graduated [[Bachelor of Medicine|MB]] [[ChM]] in 1892. For two years Smith was demonstrator of anatomy at Edinburgh, and served as examiner at the [[Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh]]. During this period he lived at 4 Grange Loan in the south of Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1895&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==
In 1896 he travelled to Australia at the request of the [[Government of South Australia]] to fill a [[pathology]] position at the [[Royal Adelaide Hospital]]. Smith was expelled from the [[British Medical Association]] and banned from the association for life in 1897 after internal conflict with Hospital staff, but having been exonerated by a Tribunal, in 1899 he was appointed city [[Coroner]] and permanent head of the department of health at [[Adelaide]].

In 1901 during the [[South African War]] Smith was surgeon captain, [[Imperial Bushmen's Corps]] and officer in charge of plague administration at [[Cape Town]].&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;

Smith was suspended from coronial duties in 1903 after 18 charges were laid against him of the misuse of human remains, specifically the removal of heads and the collection of skeletons for medical research.&lt;ref&gt;James R and James H. 2001. HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE: RETENTION OF HUMAN ORGANS AND THE DISMISSAL OF RAMSAY SMITH.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
found that Smith's actions had been "indiscreet" and he was dismissed from his position as coroner. However, he was later reinstated and continued his practice of illicitly collecting human remains.

In 1904 Smith graduated [[DSc]] from the [[University of Adelaide]], and published ''A Manual for Coroners''. In his spare time made a special study of the [[Australian aborigine]]s. Smith was the author of ''The Aborigines of Australia'', which was printed in volume three of the Official 'Year Book of the Commonwealth of Australia' (1910).

In 1906 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. His proposers were [[William Turner (anatomist)|Sir William Turner]], [[Daniel John Cunningham]], [[Alexander Crum Brown]] and [[Cargill Gilston Knott]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913 he published 'Medical Jurisprudence from the Judicial Standpoint', for which he received the degree of [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] from Edinburgh University.

In 1915 was in charge of the Australian General Hospital, Australian Imperial Force, [[Heliopolis (Cairo suburb)|Heliopolis, Egypt]].  There, he clashed with principal matron Bell over which of them should manage the nursing staff. An Inquiry resulted in both being recalled to Australia.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;

On his return to Adelaide, Smith resumed his duties at the board of health and contributed to the 'Australian Encyclopaedia', including a large part of the article on Aborigines. Following a trip to the [[Southern Ocean|South Seas]] Smith published ''In Southern Seas'' (1924); the second half of this book mostly relates to the Australian aborigines.

Smith retired in 1929 and published a book ''Myths of the Australian Aboriginals'' (1930), a collection of narratives as told by aboriginal people. It has subsequently emerged that the volume was plagiarised, and was almost entirely written by the Aboriginal polymath and scientist [[David Unaipon]], who had sold the text to finance his own work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/messageclub/duknow/stories/s888637.htm Who is David Unaipon?] Didj "u" Know at abc.net.au&lt;/ref&gt; Authorship of the book has now been restored to Uniapon and it has been republished under his name.&lt;ref&gt;David Unaipon. 2006. ''Legendary Tales of the Australian Aborigines''. Melbourne: Melbourne University Press. {{ISBN|0-522-85246-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith has also been accused of sales of Aboriginal artefacts for profit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/awaye/stories/2009/2489556.htm On the shore of a strange land: David Unaipon], 7 March 2009 at abc.net.au&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anthropological collection===
Ramsay Smith was responsible for the bulk of [[Edinburgh University]]'s physical anthropology collection, some 500 to 600 individuals.

From Ramsay Smith's writings, it is clear that he was aware of indigenous funerary customs.&lt;blockquote&gt;"After death no reference is made to the deceased, nor is his name mentioned. Relations by the same name find a substitute. A mother would not give [me] a lock of her child’s hair because she has been taught that if the child dies, its spirit will find no rest if that lock of hair survives."&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
As desecration of human remains was illegal, he used his position as Adelaide’s coroner to illicitly dissect and collect human remains, many being individuals of unusual pathologies or disease, most of which he presented to Edinburgh University. His writings indicate that he also robbed graves and it is believed he had once destroyed five graves to obtain one good specimen. Witnesses also record that he practiced his marksmanship with a [[Lee-Enfield|.303 rifle]] on corpses at the mortuary of Adelaide hospital. While he did not receive payment for the remains, he was rewarded for his "donations" with Fellowship of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] (upon the proposal of [[Sir William Turner]], [[Daniel John Cunningham]], [[Alexander Crum Brown]] and [[Cargill Gilston Knott]])&lt;ref name="Waterston2"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and an Honorary Fellowship of the [[Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|Royal Anthropological Institute]]. He was an honorary member of the [[Association of Military Surgeons of the United States]].

At his death in 1937, 182 skulls were found in his Adelaide home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://meanjin.com.au/editions/volume-68-number-4-2009/article/the-return-of-the-bones/ The Return of the Bones] Meanjin quarterly Volume 68, Number 4, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to numerous books, Ramsay Smith also published pamphlets and contributed largely to scientific journals and ''[[Chambers Encyclopaedia]]''. He was interested in literature, philosophy and music, was an excellent public servant, and earned a reputation as an authority on the Australian aborigine.

==Death==
Smith spent his final years quietly among his books at [[Belair, South Australia]], where he died on 28 September 1937. Smith had married Margaret, daughter of James Mackenzie, on 1 June 1889, who predeceased him. Four daughters and a son survived him.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;

'''Zellige''' ({{IPA-ar|zˈliʑ|lang}}; {{lang-ar|الزليج}}; also '''zelige''' or '''zellij''') is mosaic [[tile]]work made from individually chiseled geometric tiles set into a [[plaster]] base.&lt;ref&gt;[[L'Opinion]] (May 6, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; This form of [[Islamic art]] is one of the main characteristics of [[Moroccan architecture]].

==History==
{{further|Islamic geometric patterns}}

The [[Moors|Moorish]] art of zellige flourished during the [[Hispano-Moresque]] period ([[Azulejo]]) of the [[Maghreb]] and the area known as [[Al-Andalus]] (modern day [[Spain]]) between 711-1492. The technique was highly developed during the [[Nasrid dynasty]] and [[Merinid dynasty]] who gave it more importance around the 14th century and introduced blue, green and yellow colours. Red was added in the 17th century. The old enamels with the natural colours were used until the beginning of the 20th century and the colours had probably not evolved much since the period of Merinids. The cities of [[Fes]] and [[Meknes]] in [[Morocco]], remain the centers of this art.

Patrons of the art used zellige historically to decorate their homes as a statement of luxury and the sophistication of the inhabitants. Zellige is typically a series of patterns utilizing colourful [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric patterns]]. This framework of expression arose from the need of [[Islamic art]]ists to create spatial decorations that [[Aniconism in Islam|avoided depictions of living things]], consistent with the teachings of [[Sharia|Islamic law]].

== Clays for Zellige ==
[[Fez, Morocco|Fez]] and Meknes in Morocco are still the production centers for zellige tiles due to the [[Miocene]] grey clay of [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]]. The clay from this region is primarily composed of [[Kaolinite]]. For [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]] and Meknes, the clay composition is 2-56% clay minerals, calcite 3-29%. Meriam El Ouahabi states that:

{{quote|From the other sites (Meknes, Fes, Salé and Safi), the clay mineral composition shows besides kaolinite the presence of [[illite]], [[chlorite]], [[smectite]] and traces of mixed layer illite/chlorite (Fig. 3). Meknes clays belong to illitic clays, characterized by illite (54 – 61%), kaolinite (11 – 43%), smectite (8 – 12%) and chlorite (6 – 19%) (Fig. 3). Fes clays have a homogeneous composition (Fig. 3) with illite (40 – 48%). and kaolinite (18 – 28%) as the most abundant clay minerals. Chlorite (12 – 15%) and smectite (9 – 12%) are generally present as small quantities. Mixed layer illite/chlorite is present in trace amounts in all the examined Fes clay materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=El Ouahabi |first=Meriam |year=2014 |title=Mineralogical and geotechnical characterization of clays from northern Morocco for their potential use in the ceramic industry |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261479494_Preliminary_mineralogical_and_geotechnical_characterization_of_clays_from_Morocco_application_to_ceramic_industry |journal=Clay Minerals |volume=49 |pages=35–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Forms and trends==

As the colour palette of the zellige tiles increased over the centuries, it became possible to multiply the compositions ''ad infinitum''. The most current form of the zellige is a square. Other forms are  possible: the [[octagon]] combined with a [[cabochon]], a [[star]], a [[cross]], etc. It is then [[Molding (process)|moulded]] with a thickness of approximately 2 centimetres. There are simple squares of 10 by 10 centimeters or with the corners cut to be combined with a coloured cabochon. To pave an area, [[bejmat]], a [[Pavement (architecture)|paving stone]] of 15 by 5 centimetres approximately and 2 centimetres thick, can also be used.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"An encyclopedia could not contain the full array of complex, often individually varied patterns and the individually shaped, hand-cut [[tesserae]], or [[furmah]], found in zillij work. Star-based patterns are identified by their number of points—'itnashari for 12, 'ishrini for 20, arba' wa 'ishrini for 24 and so on, but they are not necessarily named with exactitude. The so-called [[khamsini]], for 50 points, and mi'ini, for 100, actually consist of 48 and 96 points respectively, because geometry requires that the number of points of any star in this sequence be divisible by six. (There are also sequences based on five and on eight.) Within a single star pattern, variations abound—by the mix of colors, the size of the furmah, and the complexity and size of interspacing elements such as strapping, braids, or "lanterns." And then there are all the non-star patterns— [[honeycomb]]s, webs, steps and shoulders, and [[checkerboard]]s. The [[Alhambra]]'s interlocking zillij patterns were reportedly a source of inspiration for the tessellations of modern Dutch artist [[M.C. Escher]]."&lt;ref&gt;Werner, Louis. 2001. [http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200103/zillij.in.fez.htm "Zillij in Fez."] Saudi Aramco World. May–June 2001. Volume 52 (3). Pages 18–31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Themes often employ [[Kufic]] script, as it fits well with the geometry of the mosaic tiles, and patterns often culminate centrally in the [[Rub El Hizb]]. The [[tessellation]]s in the mosaics are currently of interest in academic research in the [[mathematics and art|mathematics of art]].

==Zellige craftsmanship==

Zellige making is considered an [[art]] in itself. The art is transmitted from generation to generation by ''maâlems'' (master craftsmen). A long training starts at childhood to implant the required skills.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beton-decoratif.com/infos.htm beton-decoratif.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Assiduous attention to detail is needed when creating zellige. The small shapes (cut according to a precise [[radius gauge]]), painted and enamel covered pieces are then assembled in a geometrical structure as in a [[puzzle]] to form the completed mosaic. The process has not varied for a millennium, though conception and design has started using new technologies such as [[data processing]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;gallery&gt;
