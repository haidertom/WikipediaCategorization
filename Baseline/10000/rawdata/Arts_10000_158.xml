'''Alternative modeling''' is a branch of the [[Model (profession)|modeling]] industry that features models who do not [[Conformity|conform]] to mainstream [[Ideals of Beauty|ideals of beauty.]] Alternative models are often [[niche market|niche]]-specific, with a personal style that represents subcultures like [[goth subculture|goth]], [[Steampunk fashion|steampunk]], and [[fetishism]]. An alternative model may, for example, be [[tattoo]]ed, [[Body piercings|pierced]], or have other [[body modification]]s, have distinctively subcultural hair such as being [[Shaved head|shaved]], dyed a distinctively unnatural color, or styled into a [[Mohawk hairstyle|mohawk]] or [[dreadlocks]]. Alternative modeling can be clothed or [[Nude (art)|unclothed]]. 

Alternative modeling was given substantial mainstream media coverage in the last decade, partly through the creation and popularization of community-based alternative modeling paysites, like [[GodsGirls]] and [[SuicideGirls]]. Alternative modeling community sites usually promote their models for their personality as well as for their looks and portfolio.

Examples of alternative models are Jéssica Veneno from Brasil and Dany Divine from London.

==Markets==
Alternative models are often employed to promote niche products, either in shops or online, particular subcultural clothing shops and websites.

'''Andretta''' is a village and an [[artists' colony]] in [[Himachal Pradesh]]. The artists' colony was established in the 1920s, when Irish theatre artiste and environmentalist, [[Norah Richards]], shifted here from Lahore. Near [[Palampur]] in the [[Kangra District]], with [[Dhauladhar]] range of the Himalayas as a backdrop, Andretta over the years has attracted many noted artists, theatre practitioners, painters and more recently potters. Two of the people who became associated with it early on were painters [[Sobha Singh (painter)|Sobha Singh]] and [[B. C. Sanyal]].&lt;ref name=toi13/&gt;

==History==

Norah, an actress originally from Ireland, married Philip Richards, who was a professor at [[Government College, Lahore]]. She arrived in [[Lahore]], an important cultural centre, in 1908. She later became vice-principal at [[Dayal Singh College, Lahore]]. 

In the following years, she played a pivotal role in establishing modern [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] theatre, staging plays with Punjabi themes. After the death of her husband, she went back briefly, only to return in 1924, when she made Andretta, a village near Palampur, her home. She built a traditional Kangra-style mud house, known as ‘Chameli Niwas’, employing local style and material, using mud, slate and bamboo. She also built a makeshift proscenium and invited Punjabi theatre amateurs and professionals to perform plays.&lt;ref name=tri02&gt;{{cite web| title =Fragrant memories of Norah Richard’s Chameli Niwas|author=Charu Dogra |publisher=The Tribune| url = http://www.tribuneindia.com/2002/20020413/windows/main5.htm |date= 13 April 2002| accessdate = 2014-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=out/&gt;

In 1935, the District Commissioner of Kangra gave Richards 15 acres of land, and the Woodland Estate came into existence. She started a school of drama, and in time the village was known as "Mem-da-pind" (Village of [[Sahib#Colonial and modern use|Memsahib]]). 

In its early days, travel to the village was not easy. It took a 12-hour train journey, followed by a bus ride, and the last nine miles from [[Banuri (village)|Banuri]] (the nearest village) were covered on foot. Even so, it started attracting artists from all over, especially Lahore. 

This included painter [[B. C. Sanyal]] and professor Jai Dayal Singh, a pupil of Philip Richards from [[Lahore University]], through the 1940s. Sanyal started organizing painting exhibitions to fund the Norah Centre for Arts and a resort. Noted painter, [[Sobha Singh (painter)|Sobha Singh]], most known for making Sikh religious painting, moved in and stayed here till his death in 1986.&lt;ref name=tri02/&gt;&lt;ref name=out&gt;{{cite web|title=Andretta Artists' Village: The Irish Lahorian |author=Charu Soni |url=http://traveller.outlookindia.com/destination.aspx?id=569&amp;id1=2 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715024357/http://traveller.outlookindia.com/destination.aspx?id=569&amp;id1=2 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-07-15 |accessdate=2014-02-17 |publisher=Outlook Traveller }}&lt;/ref&gt; Richards nurtured Punjabi theatre through the 1940s and 1960s, and came to be known as the "grandmother of Punjabi theatre."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = PU writers’ home at Andretta |publisher=The Tribune, Chandigarh| url = http://www.tribuneindia.com/2000/20000711/himachal.htm#2|date= 11 July 2000|accessdate = 2014-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Further on, Gurucharan Singh, a noted potter who started the Delhi Blue Pottery in the 1952, established base here. Active till the end, he died in 1995 at the age of 99.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = This above all: Master potter|publisher=The Tribune| url = http://www.tribuneindia.com/1998/98nov14/saturday/aboveall.htm|date= 14 November 1998| accessdate = 2014-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Freda Bedi]], mother of actor [[Kabir Bedi]], who converted to Buddhism, lived at the village for a while.&lt;ref name=toi13/&gt;

[[File:Andretta pottery at Dastkar Bazaar, Delhi.jpg|thumb|Andretta pottery at [[Dastkar]] Bazaar, Delhi.]]
In 1983, Mansimran "Mini" Singh, son of noted potter Gurcharan Singh, and his wife Mary Singh moved here and started Andretta Pottery and Craft Society with a production studio which produces earthen slipware and a terracotta museum. They set up a Central Government Rural Marketing Centre with a grant of Rs 1,35,000 to provide assistance to potters. The society runs three-month-long residential courses for potters. Today, pottery from Andretta is sold at outlets across India.&lt;ref name=toi13&gt;{{cite web | title = Himachal's pot secret | url = http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-07-04/travel/38528897_1_himachal-pradesh-malana-hptdc |date=4 July 2013| accessdate = 2014-02-16 |pages=1–2| publisher = The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =  Andretta-A sanctuary of potters |publisher=The Hindu| url = http://www.hindu.com/2004/07/30/stories/2004073006550300.htm|date= 30 Jul 2004| accessdate = 2014-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in life, Richards was made a fellow by the [[Punjabi University]] in [[Patiala]], while in turn she willed her house and land around it to the university. Today, the estate of [[Norah Richards]] has been renovated and maintained by the university. Each year on her birthday, 29 October, a Punjabi theatre festival is hosted by the students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Universities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rs-jsaPenxYC&amp;pg=PA696|year=2006|publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Dist|isbn=978-81-269-0608-6|page=696}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=clay13&gt;{{cite web| title = Clay and Sky |publisher= The Indian Express| url = http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/clay-and-sky/# |author=Aditi Banerjee |date=21 April 2013| accessdate = 2014-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Antwerp Jazz Club''' ({{lang-nl|Antwerpse Jazzclub}}, abbreviated '''AJC'''&lt;ref name="Muziekmozaiek" /&gt;) is an association in [[Antwerp]], Belgium,&lt;ref name="Verenigingengids" /&gt; founded in 1938&lt;ref name="Lionel-Hampton"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lionelhampton.nl/antwerpsejazzclub.html|title=Antwerpse Jazz Club|author=Hans Bebop Bonefaas|date=16 April 2014|access-date=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Hans Philippi,&lt;ref name="Club"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antwerpsejazzclub.com/index.php?page=club|title=De Club|publisher=Antwerpse Jazz Club|access-date=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which delivers weekly lectures about and presentations of [[jazz]] music,&lt;ref name="Verenigingengids"&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://issuu.com/webredactie/docs/dp_60936_verenigingengids_district_antwerpen201021/9|page=16|title=Verenigingen.

Its sessions are held in Dutch.&lt;ref name="Jazz-in-Belgium" /&gt; Other than these sessions, the club organizes concerts,&lt;ref name="Club" /&gt; including helping to organize [[blues]] concerts;&lt;ref name="Club" /&gt; and has aided in the screenings of jazz documentaries.&lt;ref name="Cinema-Zuid" /&gt;

Its Tuesday-sessions are held mostly&lt;ref name="Club" /&gt; by a member, and if not by another amateur of jazz, and are often illustrated by DVD-recordings.&lt;ref name="Den-Bengel" /&gt; They are held every Tuesday night from 20PM until 22PM,&lt;ref name="Club" /&gt; but not during the [[Christmas]] period, nor the month of July. On request, the association also organises events about jazz for interested associations.&lt;ref name="Den-Bengel" /&gt;

The [[jazz club]] is a member of:
* "De Stedelijke Culturele Raad van Antwerpen" (an advisory body which features civil participation in culture-related policy of the city of Antwerp&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.antwerpen.be/nl/info/stedelijke-cultuurraad|title=Stedelijke cultuurraad|publisher=Stad Antwerpen [City of Antwerp]|date=18 September 2014|access-date=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;);
* [[Hot Club de France]]; and
* Centre for Black Music Research, [[Chicago]], United States.&lt;ref name="Lionel-Hampton" /&gt;

The now obsolete Dutch-language website Gratisinantwerpen.be, which was supported by the city of Antwerp and listed free events in Antwerp (the website also had a less complete English version at Antwerpforfree.be), used to advertise the weekly Tuesday-sessions of the ''AJC''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gratisinantwerpen.be/ |date=14 February 2014 |archive-date=2014-02-14 |access-date=13 September 2016 |title=ALLES WAT GRATIS IS DEZE WEEK / ALL THE FREE EVENTS THIS WEEK |publisher=Guerilla vzw |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140214164758/http://gratisinantwerpen.be/ |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''AJC'' is a subscriber to a number of jazz magazines, from the United States and from several European countries, which can be consulted in its clubhouse.&lt;ref name="Lionel-Hampton" /&gt;

== History ==

[[File:Guy Van Looy presenting his multimedia blues presentation entitled 'Portraits in Blues 57; Het SPIVEY PLATENLABEL' (meaning The SPIVEY RECORD LABEL) at the Antwerp Jazz Club (AJC) (13 September 2016).jpg|thumb|Guy Van Looy presenting his multimedia blues presentation entitled "Portraits in Blues 57: The SPIVEY RECORD LABEL" at the Antwerp Jazz Club (AJC) on 13 September 2016. Marc Vanistendael can be seen in the far left of the picture.]]

In 1938, the club started as gatherings to listen to commented jazz music, which remains the main activity of the club today (info {{as of|lc=y|2016}}).&lt;ref name="Club" /&gt;

Since 1950, the club also started organizing concerts.&lt;ref name="Club" /&gt; Among the famous jazz musicians who have performed in Antwerp in the 1950s and 1960s, due to the ''AJC'', are: [[Willie "The Lion" Smith]], [[Big Bill Broonzy]], [[Earl Hines]], [[Memphis Slim]], [[Buck Clayton]], [[Bill Coleman]], [[Buddy Tate]], [[Ben Webster]], [[Illinois Jacquet]], [[Ray Bryant]] and [[Guy Lafitte]].&lt;ref name="Antwerpse-Jazzclub-70"&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://issuu.com/jazzmozaiek/docs/jm0801_vol_web/21|editor1=Luc De Baefs|editor2=Bernard Lefèvre|publisher=Muziekmozaïek vzw|year=2008|issue=1|page=21|magazine=Muziekmozaïek|first=Bernard|last=Lefèvre|title=Antwerpse Jazzclub 70! "Doordringen tot de essentie van de jazz"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 April 1963 the ''AJC'' celebrated its [[silver jubilee]].&lt;ref name="Schneeberger-Places" /&gt;

The "Archive of Fons Van Cleempoel" (an archive spanning the years 1968—1988, created by "{{ill|Amsab - Institute for Social History|nl|Amsab-Instituut voor Sociale Geschiedenis}}", in partnership with the "European Holocaust Research Infrastructure (EHRI)" and the "National Archives of Belgium")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://portal.ehri-project.eu/units/be-002143-be_amsab_isg_505|title=Archief van Fons Van Cleempoel|id=BE / Amsab-ISG / 505|access-date=13 September 2016|publisher=European Holocaust Research Infrastructure (EHRI)}}&lt;/ref&gt; entails some documents from the ''AJC''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=ftp://digital.amsab.be/finding_aids/finding_aid_BE_AMSAB_505.pdf|id=S/1988/505, S/2000/527, S/2011/507|title=Plaatsingslijst van het archief van Fons Van Cleempoel (1968-1988)|publisher=Amsab - Instituut voor Sociale Geschiedenis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the club's seventy-year jubilee, the club honoured its own history by means of showing its own concert recordings, lengthy documentation and imagery during its Tuesday-sessions.&lt;ref name="Antwerpse-Jazzclub-70" /&gt;

On 18 August 2016, the Antwerp cinema "Cinema Zuid" (the new name of the Antwerp "Filmmuseum" since 12 September 2009, after it had moved to the Antwerp district "[[Zuid, Antwerp|South]]" in 2004 under the [[Museum of Modern Art, Antwerp|Museum of Contemporary Art in Antwerp]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemazuid.be/nl/contacteer|title=Over Cinema Zuid|access-date=13 September 2016|website=Cinema Zuid}}&lt;/ref&gt; in collaboration with the ''AJC'', organized a screening of two documentaries about the Belgian jazz musician and [[Conducting|conductor]] [[Stan Brenders]] and about the jazz guitarist [[Django Reinhardt]] respectively.&lt;ref name="Cinema-Zuid"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemazuid.be/nl/film/manneken-swing-swing-guitar-genius-django-reinhardt|title=MANNEKEN SWING + SWING GUITAR: THE GENIUS OF DJANGO REINHARDT|publisher=Cinema Zuid|access-date=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Picture taken on 13 September 2016, fifteen minutes before the 8PM Tuesday-session of the jazz club.]]

Since 8 November 1994, ''AJC'' holds its sessions in a bar called "Den Bengel" in Antwerp.&lt;ref name="Den-Bengel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denbengel.be/Jazz_New.html|website=Cafe Den Bengel|title=Verenigingen gevestigd in "Den Bengel". ANTWERPSE JAZZCLUB|date=27 February 2016|access-date=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More precisely, the clubhouse of  ''AJC'' is housed in the same building as that bar (which occupies the ground floor), yet on the second floor.&lt;ref name="Lionel-Hampton" /&gt; The building is actually an old [[guildhall|guild house]] ({{lang-nl|ambachtshuis}}) called "Ambachtshuis de Mouwe" (alternative names: "de gulde Mouwe" or "het Cuypershuys"), which is registered and protected as a monument since 2 September 1976 into the Flemish inventary of [[immovable property]], part of the [[heritage registers in Belgium]].&lt;ref name="Inventaris-Onroerend-Erfgoed"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://inventaris.onroerenderfgoed.be/erfgoedobjecten/4034|title=Ambachtshuis de Mouwe. inventaris bouwkundig erfgoed \ bouwkundig relict|id=4034|publisher=Onroerend Erfgoed (Flemish Government)|access-date=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building's ground floor is dated 1579, its [[gable]] is dated 1628. The building was originally the "house" of the [[craft]] of [[cooper (profession)|cooperage]] ({{lang-nl|kamer van het Kuipersambacht}}). The architectural style of the building is [[renaissance architecture]], it was designed by Léonard Blomme, and restaured in 1907. The top of the building is crowned with a triangular [[pediment]] which holds a gilded statue of [[Saint Matthias]], the [[patron saint]] of the coopers.&lt;ref name="Inventaris-Onroerend-Erfgoed" /&gt;

The building is part of the square [[Grote Markt (Antwerp)|Grote Markt]].&lt;ref name="Inventaris-Onroerend-Erfgoed" /&gt; When facing its [[facade|façade]], one finds the building [https://inventaris.onroerenderfgoed.be/erfgoedobjecten/4033 Burgerhuis Witten Engel] {{Nl icon}} at its left and the building [https://inventaris.onroerenderfgoed.be/erfgoedobjecten/4035 Huis Spaengien] {{Nl icon}} at its right, which are also protected monuments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://inventaris.onroerenderfgoed.be/erfgoedobjecten/4033|title=Burgerhuis Witten Engel. inventaris bouwkundig erfgoed \ bouwkundig relict|id=4033|publisher=Onroerend Erfgoed (Flemish Government)|access-date=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://inventaris.onroerenderfgoed.be/erfgoedobjecten/4035|title=Huis Spaengien. inventaris bouwkundig erfgoed \ bouwkundig relict|id=4035|publisher=Onroerend Erfgoed (Flemish Government)|access-date=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable persons ==

One of its board members is Piet Van De Craen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=antwerpse jazz club |website=willy's blog |access-date=13 September 2016 |archive-url=https://blog.seniorennet.be/cowboy/tvblog.php?startaantal=5 |url=https://blog.seniorennet.be/cowboy/tvblog.php?startaantal=5 |archive-date=24 August 2016 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; a full-time&lt;ref name="Piet-Van-De-Craen_Professor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.vub.ac.be/food-history/piet-van-de-craen|publisher=[[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]]|access-date=13 September 2016|series=Research &gt; Social &amp; Cultural Food Studies|title=Piet Van De Craen}}&lt;/ref&gt; language professor of Dutch Linguistics and of General Linguistics at the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]],&lt;ref name="Piet-Professor"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vrijzinnigwestvlaanderen.be/deze-maand/evenementdetail/904/-/jazz-koksijde3-0-met-piet-van-de-craen|title=Jazz@Koksijde3.0 met Piet van de Craen|publisher=Vrijzinnig West-Vlaanderen|first=Marc|last=Van Muylen|location=VOC de koepel, Westhoek, Houtsaegerlaan 21, 8670 Koksijde, Belgium|date=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; who has been called a major force behind the jazz club. For the occasion of the seventy-year jubilee of the ''AJC'' in 2008, Piet Van De Craen published a monograph about [[Duke Ellington]] (the first ever publication about him in Dutch) which features a concise biography and discography, looks at Ellington as a pianist/composer and at Ellington's co-operation with [[Billy Strayhorn]] and "The Ellingtonians" before and after 1943.&lt;ref name="Antwerpse-Jazzclub-70" /&gt; In the same year, Piet Van De Craen also criticized the lack of references to jazz history in the United States:

{{quote|text=The United States doesn't learn anything from the history. Everytime there is a new president, one starts all over again. It is a country where connections are not made. And then it happens that, for example with [[Oscar Peterson]], recently died, the press doesn't make any reference to [[Art Tatum]], just as if Peterson arose out of nowhere ... that kind of profundity is lacking.&lt;ref name="Antwerpse-Jazzclub-70" /&gt;}}

=== Presidents ===

==== Hans Philippi ====

Hans Philippi (born 17 December 1905) founded both the ''AJC'', as well as the ''Hot Club Basel'', a jazz club in [[Basel]], Switzerland. He was an early advocate of the recognition of jazz as an art. He had his own radio series, held jazz music presentations by means of playing sound records throughout Switzerland and was acquainted with jazz musicians such as [[Louis Armstrong]] and jazz experts such as [[Hugues Panassié]] and [[Charles Delaunay]].&lt;ref name="Schneeberger-Introduction"&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.jazzdocumentation.ch/mario/philippi/1einleitung.pdf|date=24 March 2006|title=Jazz in der Schweiz 1924-1976. Zeitdokumente des Hans Philippi aus Basel. Das Verzeichnis|chapter=Einleitung|author=Mario Schneeberger|access-date=12 September 2016|website=JAZZdocumentation.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swiss jazz musician Mario Schneeberger compiled a list of notable documents regarding Hans Philippi, from the memorial albums of Philippi, after an acquaintance of Schneeberger had told him that they were about to be put up as garbage disposal following a [[house clearance]] in February 2004.&lt;ref name="Schneeberger-Introduction" /&gt;

In this archive by Mario Schneeberger, it is noted that Hans Philippi was president of the ''AJC'' in 1938, as from a booklet of that year produced by the ''AJC'' called "Jazz-Leven".&lt;ref name="Schneeberger-Places"&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.jazzdocumentation.ch/mario/philippi/3orte.pdf|date=24 March 2006|title=Jazz in der Schweiz 1924-1976. Zeitdokumente des Hans Philippi aus Basel. Das Verzeichnis|chapter=Orte|author=Mario Schneeberger|access-date=12 September 2016|website=JAZZdocumentation.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Louis Vaes and François Vaes ====

The activities of the club were coordinated by Louis Vaes (1920—1998) from 1946 until 1998.

Later, his brother François Vaes (born 1939), nicknamed "Sus",&lt;ref name="Muziekmozaiek"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.muziekmozaiek.be/index.php?action=nieuwsdetail&amp;nieuws=2336&amp;titel=Antwerpse+Jazz+Club+in+rouw&amp;select_onderdeel=4090|title=Antwerpse Jazz Club in rouw|series=JAZZ. Jazzweblog|publisher=Muziekmozaïek|date=12 August 2012|access-date=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; became president of the club,&lt;ref name="Club" /&gt; until he died after a "short disease" on 9 August 2012. François Vaes advocated for youths to appreciate the roots of jazz, as opposed to being seemingly merely interested in new or trendy jazz music.&lt;ref name="Muziekmozaiek" /&gt;

In [[psychology of art]], the relationship between '''art and emotion''' has newly been the subject of extensive study thanks to the intervention of esteemed art historian [[Alexander Nemerov]]. [[Emotion]]al or aesthetic responses to [[art]] have previously been viewed as basic stimulus response, but new theories and research have suggested that these experiences are more complex and able to be studied experimentally.&lt;ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silvia|first=Paul J.|title=Emotional Responses to Art: From Collation and Arousal to Cognition and Emotion.|journal=Review of General Psychology|date=1 January 2005|volume=9|issue=4|pages=342–357|doi=10.1037/1089-2680.9.4.342}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emotional responses are often regarded as the keystone to experiencing art, and the creation of an emotional experience has been argued as the purpose of artistic expression.&lt;ref name=Fellous-review&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fellous|first=Jean-Marc|title=A mechanistic view of the expression and experience of emotion in the arts. Deeper that reason: Emotion and its role in literature, music and art by Jenefer Robinson|journal=The American Journal of Psychology|year=2006|volume=119|issue=4|pages=668–674|doi=10.2307/20445371}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that the neurological underpinnings of perceiving art differ from those used in standard object recognition.&lt;ref name=Cupchick-neuro&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cupchik|first=Gerald C.|author2=Vartanian, Oshin|author3= Crawley, Adrian|author4= Mikulis, David J.|title=Viewing artworks: Contributions of cognitive control and perceptual facilitation to aesthetic experience|journal=Brain and Cognition|date=1 June 2009|volume=70|issue=1|pages=84–91|doi=10.1016/j.bandc.2009.01.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead, [[brain]] regions involved in the experience of emotion and goal setting show activation when viewing art.&lt;ref name=Cupchick-neuro /&gt;

== Basis for Emotional Responses to Art ==
Evolutionary ancestry has hard-wired humans to have affective responses for certain patterns and traits. These predispositions lend themselves to responses when looking at certain visual arts as well. Identification of subject matter is the first step in understanding the visual image. Being presented with visual stimuli creates initial confusion. Being able to comprehend a figure and background creates closure and triggers the pleasure centers of the brain by remedying the confusion. Once an image is identified, meaning can be created by accessing memory relative to the visual stimuli and associating personal memories with what is being viewed.&lt;ref name="barry"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barry | first1 = A | year = 2006 | title = Perceptual Aesthetics: Transcendent Emotion, Neurological Image | url = | journal = Visual Communication Quarterly | volume = 13 | issue = 3| pages = 134–151 | doi = 10.1207/s15551407vcq1303_2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other methods of stimulating initial interest that can lead to emotion involves pattern recognition. [[Symmetry]] is often found in works of art, and the human brain unconsciously searches for symmetry for a number of reasons. Potential predators were [[Symmetry in biology|bilaterally symmetrical]], as were potential prey. Bilateral symmetry also exists in humans, and a healthy human is typically symmetrical. This attraction to symmetry was therefore advantageous, as it helped humans recognize danger, food, and mates. Art containing symmetry therefore is typically approached and positively valenced to humans.&lt;ref name="barry" /&gt;

Another example is to observe paintings or photographs of bright, open landscapes that often evoke a feeling of beauty, [[Relaxation (psychology)|relaxation]], or happiness. This connection to pleasant emotions exists because it was advantageous to humans before today's society to be able to see far into the distance in a brightly lit vista. Similarly, visual images that are dark and/or obscure typically elicit emotions of [[anxiety]] and fear. This is because an impeded visual field is disadvantageous for a human to be able to defend itself.&lt;ref name="carroll"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carroll | first1 = N | year = 2003 | title = ART AND MOOD: PRELIMINARY NOTES AND CONJECTURES | url = | journal = Monist | volume = 86 | issue = 4| pages = 521–555 | doi=10.5840/monist200386426}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Meta-Emotions ===
The optimal visual artwork creates what Noy &amp; Noy-Sharav call "meta-emotions." These are multiple emotions that are triggered at the same time. They posit that what people see when immediately looking at a piece of artwork are the formal, technical qualities of the work and its complexity. Works that are well-made but lacking in appropriate complexity, or works that are intricate but missing in technical skill will not produce "meta-emotions."&lt;ref name="noy"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Noy | first1 = P. | last2 = Noy-Sharav | first2 = D. | year = 2013 | title = Art and Emotions | url = | journal = International Journal of Applied Psychoanalytic Studies | volume = 10 | issue = 2| pages = 100–107 | doi = 10.1002/aps.1352 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, seeing a perfectly painted chair (technical quality but no complexity) or a sloppily drawn image of [[Christ]] on the cross (complex but no skill) would be unlikely to stimulate deep emotional responses. However, beautifully painted works of Christ's [[crucifixion]] are likely make people who can relate or who understand the story behind it weep.

Noy &amp; Noy-Sharav also claim that art is the most potent form of emotional communication. They cite examples of people being able to listen to and [[dance]] to [[music]] for hours without getting tired and literature being able to take people to far away, imagined lands inside their heads. Art forms give humans a higher satisfaction in emotional release than simply managing emotions on their own. Art allows people to have a cathartic release of pent-up emotions either by creating work or by witnessing and pseudo-experiencing what they see in front of them. Instead of being passive recipients of actions and images, art is intended for people to challenge themselves and work through the emotions they see presented in the artistic message ./..&lt;ref name="noy" /&gt;

tions works of art can elicit; whether these are defined emotions such as anger, confusion or happiness, or a general feeling of aesthetic appreciation.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silvia|first=Paul J.|title=Looking past pleasure: Anger, confusion, disgust, pride, surprise, and other unusual aesthetic emotions.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2009|volume=3|issue=1|pages=48–51|doi=10.1037/a0014632}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aesthetic experience seems to be determined by liking or disliking a work of art, placed along a continuum of pleasure–displeasure.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt; However, other diverse emotions can still be felt in response to art, which can be sorted into three categories: Knowledge Emotions, Hostile Emotions, and Self-Conscious Emotions.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt;

===Liking and comprehensibility ===
Pleasure elicited by works of art can also have multiple sources. A number of theories suggest that enjoyment of a work of art is dependent on its comprehensibility or ability to be understood easily.&lt;ref name=Millis-titles&gt;{{cite journal|last=Millis|first=Keith|title=Making meaning brings pleasure: The influence of titles on aesthetic experiences.|journal=Emotion|date=1 January 2001|volume=1|issue=3|pages=320–329|doi=10.1037/1528-3542.1.3.320|pmid=12934689}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, when more information about a work of art is provided, such as a title, description, or artist's statement, researchers predict that viewers will understand the piece better, and demonstrate greater liking for it.&lt;ref name=Millis-titles /&gt; Experimental evidence shows that the presence of a title for a work increases perceived understanding, regardless of whether that title is elaborative or descriptive.&lt;ref name=Millis-titles /&gt;  Elaborative titles did affect aesthetic responses to the work, suggesting viewers were not creating alternative explanations for the works if an explaining title is given.&lt;ref name=Millis-titles /&gt; Descriptive or random titles do not show any of these effects.&lt;ref name=Millis-titles /&gt;

Furthering the thought that pleasure in art derives from its comprehensibility and processing fluency, some authors have described this experience as an emotion.&lt;ref name=Armstrong-Beauty&gt;{{cite journal|last=Armstrong|first=Thomas|author2=Detweiler-Bedell, Brian|title=Beauty as an emotion: The exhilarating prospect of mastering a challenging world.|journal=Review of General Psychology|date=1 January 2008|volume=12|issue=4|pages=305–329|doi=10.1037/a0012558}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emotional feeling of beauty, or an aesthetic experience, does not have a valence emotional undercurrent, rather is general cognitive arousal due to the fluent processing of a novel stimuli.&lt;ref name=Armstrong-Beauty /&gt; Some authors believe that aesthetic emotions is enough of a unique and verifiable experience that it should be included in general theories of emotion.&lt;ref name=Armstrong-Beauty /&gt;

===Knowledge emotions===
Knowledge emotions deal with reactions to thinking and feeling, such as interest, confusion, and surprise.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt; They often stem from self-analysis of what the viewer knows, expects, and perceives.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt;&lt;ref name=Silvia-confusion /&gt; This set of emotions also spur actions that motivate further learning and thinking.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt;

====Interest====
Interest in a work of art arises from perceiving the work as new, complex, and unfamiliar, as well as understandable.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt;&lt;ref name=Silvia-confusion /&gt; This dimension is studied most often by aesthetics researchers, and can be equated with aesthetic pleasure or an aesthetic experience.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt; This stage of art experience usually occurs as the viewer understands the artwork they are viewing, and the art fits into their knowledge and expectations while providing a new experience.&lt;ref name=Silvia-confusion /&gt;

====Confusion====
Confusion can be viewed as an opposite to interest, and serves as a signal to the self to inform the viewer that they cannot comprehend what they are looking at, and confusion often necessitates a shift in action to remedy the lack of understanding.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt;&lt;ref name=Silvia-confusion&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silvia|first=Paul J.|title=Confusion and interest: The role of knowledge emotions in aesthetic experience.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2010|volume=4|issue=2|pages=75–80|doi=10.1037/a0017081}}&lt;/ref&gt; Confusion is thought to stem from uncertainty, and a lack of one's expectations and knowledge being met by a work of art.&lt;ref name=Silvia-confusion /&gt; 
Confusion is most often experienced by art novices, and therefore must often be dealt with by those in arts education.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt;

====Surprise====
Surprise functions as a disruption of current action to alert a viewer to a significant event.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt; The emotion is centered around the experience of something new and unexpected, and can be ellicied by sensory incongruity.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt; Art can ellicit surprise when expectations about the work are not met, but the work changes those expectations in an understandable way.

===Hostile emotions===
Hostile emotions toward art are often very visible in the form of anger or frustration, and can result in censorship, but are less easily described by a continuum of aesthetic pleasure-displeasure.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt; These reactions center around the hostility triad: anger, disgust, and contempt.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt;  These emotions often motivate aggression, self-assertion, and violence, and arise from perception of the artist's deliberate trespass onto the expectations of the viewer.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt;

===Self-conscious emotions===
Self-conscious emotions are responses that reflect upon the self and one's actions, such as pride, guilt, shame, regret and embarrassment.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt; These are much more complex emotions, and involve assessing events as agreeing with one's self-perception or not, and adjusting one's behavior accordingly.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt; There are numerous instances of artists expressing self-conscious emotions in response to their art, and self-conscious emotions can also be felt collectively.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt;

====Sublime feelings====
Researchers have investigated the experience of the sublime, viewed as similar to aesthetic appreciation, which causes general psychological arousal.&lt;ref name=Eskine-sublime&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eskine|first=Kendall J.|author2=Kacinik, Natalie A.|author3= Prinz, Jesse J.|title=Stirring images: Fear, not happiness or arousal, makes art more sublime.|journal=Emotion|date=1 January 2012|volume=12|issue=5|pages=1071–1074|doi=10.1037/a0027200}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sublime feeling has been connected to a feeling of happiness in response to art, but may be more related to an experience of fear.&lt;ref name=Eskine-sublime /&gt; Researchers have shown that feelings of fear induced before looking at artwork results in more sublime feelings in response to those works.&lt;ref name=Eskine-sublime /&gt;

====Aesthetic chills====
{{Main|Aesthetic chills}}
Another common emotional response is that of chills when viewing a work of art. The feeling is predicted to be related to similar aesthetic experiences such as awe, feeling touched, or absorption.&lt;ref name=Silvia-chills&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silvia|first=Paul J.|author2=Nusbaum, Emily C.|title=On personality and piloerection: Individual differences in aesthetic chills and other unusual aesthetic experiences.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2011|volume=5|issue=3|pages=208–214|doi=10.1037/a0021914}}&lt;/ref&gt; Personality traits along the Big 5 Inventory have been shown to be predictors of a person's experience of aesthetic chills, especially a high rating on Openness to Experience.&lt;ref name=Silvia-chills /&gt; This counters the effect of fluid intelligence, where those with higher amounts of fluid intelligence are less likely to experience chills.&lt;ref name=Silvia-chills /&gt; Experience with the arts also predicts someone's experience of aesthetic chills, but this may be due to them experiencing art more frequently.&lt;ref name=Silvia-chills /&gt;

===Effects of expertise===
The fact that art is analyzed and experienced differently by those with artistic training and expertise than those who are artistically naive has been shown numerous times. Researchers have tried to understand how experts interact with art so differently from the art naive, as experts tend to like more abstract compositions, and show a greater liking for both modern and classical types of art.&lt;ref name=Leder-appreciated&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leder|first=Helmut|author2=Gerger, Gernot|author3= Dressler, Stefan G.|author4= Schabmann, Alfred|title=How art is appreciated.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2012|volume=6|issue=1|pages=2–10|doi=10.1037/a0026396}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts also exhibit more arousal when looking at modern and abstract works, while non-experts show more arousal to classical works.&lt;ref name=Leder-appreciated /&gt;

Other researchers predicted that experts find more complex art interesting because they have changed their appraisals of art to create more interest, or are possibly making completely different types of appraisals than novices.&lt;ref name=Silvia-expertise&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silvia|first=Paul J.|title=Artistic training and interest in visual art: Applying the appraisal model of aesthetic emotions|journal=Empirical Studies of the Arts|year=2006|volume=24|issue=2|pages=139–161|doi=10.2190/dx8k-6wea-6wpa-fm84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts described works rated high in complexity as easier to understand and more interesting than did novices, possibly as experts tend to use more idiosyncratic criteria when judging artworks.&lt;ref name=Silvia-expertise /&gt; However, experts seem to use the same appraisals of emotions that novices do, but these appraisals are at a higher level, because a wider range of art is comprehensible to experts.&lt;ref name=Silvia-expertise /&gt;

====Expertise and museum visits====
Due to most art being in museums and galleries, most people have to make deliberate choices to interact with art. Researchers are interested in what types of experiences and emotions people are looking for when going to experience art in a museum.&lt;ref name=Mastandera-muesum&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mastandrea|first=Stefano|author2=Bartoli, G.|author3=Bove, G.|title=Learning through ancient art and experincing emotions with contemporary art: Comparing visits in two different museums|journal=Empirical Studies of the Arts|year=2007|volume=25|issue=2|pages=173–191|doi=10.2190/r784-4504-37m3-2370}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most people respond that they visit museums to experience 'the pleasure of art' or 'the desire for cultural learning', but when broken down, visitors of museums of classical art are more motivated to see famous works and learn more about them.&lt;ref name=Mastandera-muesum /&gt; Visitors in contemporary art museums were more motivated by a more emotional connection to the art, and went more for the pleasure than a learning experience.&lt;ref name=Mastandera-muesum /&gt; Predictors of who would prefer to go to which type of museum lay in education level, art fluency, an socio-economic status.&lt;ref name=Mastandera-muesum /&gt;

==Theories and models of elicited emotions==
Researchers have offered a number of theories to describe emotional responses to art, often aligning with the various theories of the basis of emotions. Authors have argued that the emotional experience is created explicitly by the artist and mimicked in the viewer, or that the emotional experience of art is a by-product of the analysis of that work.&lt;ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart /&gt;&lt;ref name=Fellous-review /&gt;

===Appraisal theory===
The [[appraisal theory]] of emotions centers on the assumption that it is the evaluation of events, and not the events themselves, that cause emotional experiences.&lt;ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart /&gt; Emotions are then created by different groups of appraisal structures that events are analyzed through.&lt;ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart /&gt; When applied to art, appraisal theories argue that various artistic structures, such as complexity, prototypically, and understanding are used as appraisal structures, and works that show more typical art principles will create a stronger aesthetic experience .&lt;ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart /&gt; Appraisal theories suggest that art is experienced as interesting after being analyzed through a novelty check and coping-potential check, which analyze the art's newness of experience for the viewer, and the viewer's ability to understand the new experience.&lt;ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart /&gt; Experimental evidence suggests that art is preferred when the viewer finds it easier to understand, and that interest in a work is predictable with knowledge of the viewer's ability to process complex visual works, which supports the appraisal theory.&lt;ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart /&gt; People with higher levels of artistic expertise and knowledge often prefer more complex works of art. Under appraisal theory, experts have a different emotional experience to art due to a preference for more complex works that they can understand better than a naive viewer.&lt;ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart /&gt;

====Appraisal and negative emotions====
A newer take on this theory focuses on the consequences of the emotions elicited from art, both positive and negative. The original theory argues that positive emotions are the result of a biobehavioral reward system, where a person feels a positive emotion when they have completed a personal goal.&lt;ref name=cooper-opposingart&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Jessica M.|author2=Paul J. Silvia|title=Opposing art: Rejection as an action tendency of hostile aesthetic emotions|journal=Empirical Studies of the Arts|year=2009|volume=27|issue=1|pages=109–126|doi=10.2190/em.27.1.f}}&lt;/ref&gt; These emotional rewards create actions by motivating approach or withdrawal from a stimuli, depending if the object is positive or negative to the person.&lt;ref name=cooper-opposingart /&gt; However, these theories have not often focused on negative emotions, especially negative emotional experiences from art.&lt;ref name=cooper-opposingart /&gt; These emotions are central to experimental aesthetics research in order to understand why people have negative, rejecting, condemning, or censoring reactions to works of art.&lt;ref name=cooper-opposingart /&gt; By showing research participants controversial photographs, rating their feelings of anger, and measuring their subsequent actions, researchers found that the participants that felt hostile toward the photographs displayed more rejection of the works.&lt;ref name=cooper-opposingart /&gt; This suggests that negative emotions towards a work of art can create a negative action toward it, and suggests the need for further research on negative reactions towards art.&lt;ref name=cooper-opposingart /&gt;

===Minimal model===
Other psychologists believe that emotions are of minimal functionality, and are used to move a person towards incentives and away from threats.&lt;ref name=Xenakis-functionalrole&gt;{{cite journal|last=Xenakis|first=Ioannis|author2=Arnellos, Argyris|author3= Darzentas, John|title=The functional role of emotions in aesthetic judgment|journal=New Ideas in Psychology|date=1 August 2012|volume=30|issue=2|pages=212–226|doi=10.1016/j.newideapsych.2011.09.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, positive emotions are felt upon the attainment of a goal, and negative emotions when a goal has failed to be achieved.&lt;ref name=Xenakis-functionalrole /&gt;   The basic states of pleasure or pain can be adapted to aesthetic experiences by a disinterested buffer, where the experience is not explicitly related to the goal-reaching of the person, but a similar experience can be analyzed from a disinterested distance.&lt;ref name=Xenakis-functionalrole /&gt; These emotions are disinterested because the work of art or artist's goals are not affecting the person's well being, but the viewer can feel whether or not those goals were achieved from a third-party distance.

===Five-step aesthetic experience===
Other theorists have focused their models on the disrupting and unique experience that comes from the interacting with a powerful work of art. An early model focused on a two-part experience: facile recognition and meta-cognitive perception, or the experience of the work of art and the mind's analysis of that experience.&lt;ref name=Pelowski-5part&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pelowski|first=Matthew|author2=Akiba, Fuminori|title=A model of art perception, evaluation and emotion in transformative aesthetic experience|journal=New Ideas in Psychology|date=1 August 2011|volume=29|issue=2|pages=80–97|doi=10.1016/j.newideapsych.2010.04.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further cognitive model strengthens this idea into a five-part emotional experience of a work of art.&lt;ref name=Pelowski-5part /&gt; As this five-part model is new, it remains only a theory, as not much empirical evidence for the model had been researched yet.

====Part one: Pre-expectations and self-image====
The first stage of this model focuses on the viewer's expectations of the work before seeing it, based on their previous experiences, their observational strategies, and the relation of the work to themselves.&lt;ref name=Pelowski-5part /&gt; Viewers who tend to appreciate art, or know more about it will have different expectations at this stage than those who are not engaged by art.&lt;ref name=Pelowski-5part /&gt;

====Part two: Cognitive mastery and introduction of discrepancy ====
After viewing the work of art, people will make an initial judgment and classification of the work,  often based on their preconceptions of the work.&lt;ref name=Pelowski-5part /&gt; After initial classification, viewers attempt to understand the motive and meaning of the work, which can then inform their perception of the work, creating a cycle of changing perception and the attempt to understand it.&lt;ref name=Pelowski-5part /&gt; It is at this point any discrepancies between expectations and the work, or the work and understanding arise.&lt;ref name=Pelowski-5part /&gt;

====Part three: Secondary control and escape====
When an individual finds a discrepancy in their understanding that cannot be resolved or ignored, they move to the third stage of their interaction with a work of art.&lt;ref name=Pelowski-5part /&gt; At this point, interaction with the work has switched from lower-order and unconscious processes to higher-order cognitive involvement, and tension and frustration starts to be felt.&lt;ref name=Pelowski-5part /&gt; In order to maintain their self-assumptions and to resolve the work, an individual will try to change their environment in order for the issue to be resolved or ignored.&lt;ref name=Pelowski-5part /&gt;  This can be done by re-classifying the work and its motives, blaming the discrepancy on an external source, or attempting to escape the situation or mentally withdraw from the work.&lt;ref name=Pelowski-5part /&gt;

====Part four: Meta-cognitive reassessment====
If viewers cannot escape or reassess the work, they are forced to reassess the self and their interactions with works of art.&lt;ref name=Pelowski-5part /&gt;  This experience of self-awareness through a work of art is often externally caused, rather than internally motivated, and starts a transformative process to understand the meaning of the discrepant work, and edit their own self-image.&lt;ref name=Pelowski-5part /&gt;

====Part five: Aesthetic outcome and new mastery====
After the self-transformation and change in expectations, the viewer resets their interaction with the work, and begins the process anew with deeper self-understanding and cognitive mastery of the artwork.&lt;ref name=Pelowski-5part /&gt;

==Pupillary response tests==
In order to research emotional responses to art, researchers often rely on behavioral data.&lt;ref name=Leder-pupil&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuchinke|first=Lars|author2=Trapp, Sabrina|author3= Jacobs, Arthur M.|author4= Leder, Helmut|title=Pupillary responses in art appreciation: Effects of aesthetic emotions.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2009|volume=3|issue=3|pages=156–163|doi=10.1037/a0014464}}&lt;/ref&gt;  But new psychophysilogical methods of measuring emotional response are beginning to be used, such as the measurement of pupillary response.&lt;ref name=Leder-pupil /&gt; Pupil responses have been predicted to indicate image pleasantness and emotional arousal, but can be confounded by luminance, and confusion between an emotion's positive or negative valence, requiring an accompanying verbal explanation of emotional state.&lt;ref name=Rembrandt&gt;{{cite journal|last=Powell|first=W. Ryan|author2=Schirillo, James A.|title=Hemispheric laterality measured in Rembrandt's portraits using pupil diameter and aesthetic verbal judgements|journal=Cognition &amp; Emotion|date=1 August 2011|volume=25|issue=5|pages=868–885|doi=10.1080/02699931.2010.515709}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pupil dilatations have been found to predict emotional responses and the amount of information the brain is processing, measures important in testing emotional response ellicted by artwork.&lt;ref name=Leder-pupil /&gt; Further, the existence of pupillary responses to artwork can be used as an argument that art does ellicit emotional responses with physiological reactions.&lt;ref name=Leder-pupil /&gt; 
[[File:Juan Gris 004.jpg|thumb|An example Cubist work by Juan Gris]]

===Pupil responses to art===
After viewing Cubist paintings of varying complexity, abstraction, and familiarity, participants' pupil responses were greatest when viewing aesthetically pleasing artwork, and highly accessible art, or art low in abstraction.&lt;ref name=Leder-pupil /&gt; Pupil responses also correlated with personal preferences of the cubist art.&lt;ref name=Leder-pupil /&gt; High pupil responses were also correlated with faster cognitive processing, supporting theories that aesthetic emotions and preferences are related to the brain's ease of processing the stimuli.&lt;ref name=Leder-pupil /&gt;

====Left-cheek biases====
[[File:Rembrandt - Minerva - WGA19246.jpg|thumb|''Minerva'' Rembrandt. Female portrait showing left-cheek orientation]]
These effects are also seen when investigating the Western preference for left-facing portraits. This skew towards left-cheek is found in the majority of Western portraits, and is rated as more pleasing than other portrait orientations.&lt;ref name=Blackburn-pupil&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blackburn|first=Kelsey|author2=Schirillo, James|title=Emotive hemispheric differences measured in real-life portraits using pupil diameter and subjective aesthetic preferences|journal=Experimental Brain Research|date=19 April 2012|volume=219|issue=4|pages=447–455|doi=10.1007/s00221-012-3091-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theories for this preference suggest that the left side of the face as more emotionally descriptive and expressive, which lets viewers connect to this emotional content better.&lt;ref name=Blackburn-pupil /&gt; Pupil response tests were used to test emotional response to different types of portraits, left or right cheek, and pupil dilation was linearly related to the pleasantness of the portrait, with increased dilations for pleasant images, and constrictions for unpleasant images.&lt;ref name=Blackburn-pupil /&gt; Left-facing portraits were rated as more pleasant, even when mirrored to appear right-facing, suggesting that people are more attracted to more emotional facial depictions.&lt;ref name=Blackburn-pupil /&gt;

This research was continued, using portraits by [[Rembrandt]] featuring females with a left-cheek focus and males with a right-cheek focus.&lt;ref name=Rembrandt /&gt;  Researchers predicted Rembrandt chose to portray his subjects this way to elicit different emotional responses in his viewers related to which portrait cheek was favored.&lt;ref name=Rembrandt /&gt; In comparison to previous studies, increased pupil size was only found for male portraits with a right-cheek preference. This may be because the portraits were viewed as domineering, and the subsequent pupil response was due to unpleasantness.&lt;ref name=Rembrandt /&gt; As pupil dilation is more indicative of strength of emotional response than the valence, a verbal description of emotional responses should accompany further pupillary response tests.&lt;ref name=Rembrandt /&gt;

==Art as emotional regulation==
Art is also used as an emotional regulator, most often in [[Art Therapy]] sessions. Studies have shown that creating art can serve as a method of short-term [[mood (psychology)|mood]] regulation.&lt;ref name=Drake-venting&gt;{{cite journal|last=Drake|first=Jennifer E.|author2=Winner, Ellen|title=Confronting sadness through art-making: Distraction is more beneficial than venting.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2012|volume=6|issue=3|pages=255–261|doi=10.1037/a0026909}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dalebroux-venting&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dalebroux|first=Anne|author2=Goldstein, Thalia R.|author3= Winner, Ellen|title=Short-term mood repair through art-making: Positive emotion is more effective than venting|journal=Motivation and Emotion|volume=32|issue=4|pages=288–295|doi=10.1007/s11031-008-9105-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of regulation falls into two categories: venting and distraction.&lt;ref name=Drake-venting /&gt; Artists in all fields of the arts have reported emotional venting and distraction through the creation of their art.&lt;ref name=Drake-venting /&gt;&lt;ref name=Dalebroux-venting /&gt;

===Venting===
Venting through art is the process of using art to attend to and discharge negative emotions.&lt;ref name=Drake-venting /&gt; However, research has shown venting to be a less effective method of emotional regulation. Research participants asked to draw either an image related to a sad movie they just watched, or a neutral house, demonstrated less negative mood after the neutral drawing.&lt;ref name=Drake-venting /&gt; Venting drawings did improve negative mood more than no drawing activity.&lt;ref name=Drake-venting /&gt; Other research suggests that this is because analyzing negative emotions can have a helpful effect, but immersing in negative emotions can have a deleterious effect.&lt;ref name=Dalebroux-venting /&gt;

===Distraction===
Distraction is the process of creating art to oppose, or in spite of negative emotions.&lt;ref name=Drake-venting /&gt; This can also take the form of fantasizing, or creating an opposing positive to counteract a negative affect.&lt;ref name=Dalebroux-venting /&gt; Research has demonstrated that distractive art making activities improve mood greater than venting activities.&lt;ref name=Drake-venting /&gt; Distractive drawings were shown to decrease negative emotions more than venting drawings or no drawing task even after participants were asked to recall their saddest personal memories.&lt;ref name=Drake-venting /&gt; These participants also experienced an increase in positive affect after a distractive drawing task.&lt;ref name=Drake-venting /&gt; The change in mood valence after a distractive drawing task is even greater when participants are asked to create happy drawings to counter their negative mood.&lt;ref name=Dalebroux-venting /&gt;

'''Artex''' (Art Expo Fair) began in 1986 in Auckland, New Zealand in 1986 and ran until 1994. It was the first art fair to be held in New Zealand which showcased historical and contemporary New Zealand art.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Artex was the genesis for what is now known as the Auckland Art Fair.

== History ==
The first Artex, titled ARTEX 86 was held from 27 – 31 August 1986 at the Princes Wharf Passenger Terminal Building in Auckland New Zealand. The first Artex event was opened by the Minister of Arts, The Right Honourable [[Margaret Austin]] and former chair-person of The Arts Council (now [[Creative New Zealand]]) [[Hamish Keith|Mr Hamish Keith]]. The fair included 33 dealer galleries, groups and individual artists including the [[:Category:People associated with the Auckland Society of Arts|Auckland Society of the Arts]]. The event also featured demonstrations and videos of prominent New Zealand artists such as [[Philip Clairmont]], loaned by the [[Auckland Art Gallery]].&lt;ref name="Art New Zealand"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Daly-Peoples|first=John|title=Artex 86|journal=Art New Zealand|year=1986/7|volume=41|issue=Summer|pages=36|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organizer [[Warwick Henderson]],&lt;ref name=WarwickHenderson&gt;{{cite web|title=About: Warwick Henderson Gallery|url=http://www.warwickhenderson.co.nz/about/|website=Warwick Henderson Gallery|publisher=Warwick Henderson Gallery|ref=Warwick Henderson}}&lt;/ref&gt; a businessman, art collector and investment art dealer was concerned that New Zealand contemporary artists failed to receive the recognition they deserved because artists and their dealers simply failed to actively promote and sell their work. This lack of promotion of contemporary New Zealand art to a New Zealand audience was the motivation behind New Zealand’s first Art Fair. Henderson stated at the time, "there is a perception art is for the elite only and many potential buyers feel intimidated visiting dealer galleries. I am hoping to break down these barriers and make art accessible for all." &lt;ref name="Stephen Christensen reports on Artex 86 exhibition in Auckland"&gt;{{cite news|last=Christensen|first=Steven|title=Art Fair 27th August 1986|newspaper=TV One 6.30pm News|date=27 August 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arts writer [[John Daly-Peoples]] stated ‘there is an underlying belief that good art will sell itself and that the number of people who pass through the gallery is not really relevant.' ‘While tens of thousands might attend a well promoted exhibition some smaller dealer galleries count attendance in dozens.' While 'there are no exhibitions of ''New Zealand'' art attracting people in their tens of thousands.'&lt;ref name="Art New Zealand" /&gt;  The blockbuster exhibitions in New Zealand were public institution arranged exhibitions such as [[Monet]], [[Henry Moore]] and ‘Te Maori’ (a traveling exhibition of traditional Maori carvings and artifacts that eventually traveled internationally). New Zealand contemporary art shows had never gained this level of attention.

Despite this the Artex art fair’s inaugural event in 1986 attracted unprecedented crowds, with a ‘steady stream of visitors’ and attendance records for the first show reaching 12,000 &lt;ref name="New Zealand Herald"&gt;{{cite news|title=Over 12,000 visit Art Fair|newspaper=New Zealand Herald|date=1 September 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show itself sold around $300,000 worth of art work.&lt;ref name="New Zealand Herald" /&gt; 
There was also significant media attention surrounding Artex, with a report on the fair on television NZ headline 6pm News.&lt;ref name="Stephen Christensen reports on Artex 86 exhibition in Auckland" /&gt; The New Zealand Herald also featured ARTEX in an article on 1 September headed ‘Over 12,000 visit Art Fair.’&lt;ref name="New Zealand Herald" /&gt; There were several radio interviews including a comprehensive interview with the organizer on Radio New Zealand's National Program. 
The first fair was also subject to some controversy when with [[Leighton Smith (radio)|Leighton Smith]], host of New Zealand's leading radio show, [[Newstalk ZB]] complained on air that he had to spend $10 for entry. The organizer also criticized the Arts Council of New Zealand for failing to support the show by way of funding or a grant.

== New Zealand Art Market ==

Artex marked a change in New Zealand’s art market,{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} with a more direct concentration on the ‘business of art,’ as it not only put a focus on New Zealand Artists - celebrating modern New Zealand work as well as its historical art heritage, it revealed contemporary New Zealand paintings by leading New Zealand artists such as [[Colin McCahon]], [[Toss Woollaston]], [[Michael Smither]], [[John Weeks (painter)|John Weeks]], Allen Maddox, Keith Patterson, [[Philip Clairmont]], [[Frances Hodgkins]], [[Ian Scott (artist)|Ian Scott]], [[Dick Frizzell]] and [[Dean Buchanan]]. For the many thousands of visitors it was their first live exposure to serious New Zealand contemporary art.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} ARTEX paved the way for contemporary art in New Zealand to become more mainstream and accessible to the general public and budding art collectors.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Owing to the success of the first ARTEX in 1986, further shows were held in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch.

'''Bastar Iron Craft''' (also known as "Wrought iron craft of Baster") is a traditional Indian [[iron]] crafts that are manufactured in the [[Bastar district|Bastar]] district of [[Chhattisgarh]] state, [[India]]. The iron-crafting work has been protected under the [[geographical indication]] (GI) of the [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] (TRIPS) agreement. It is listed at item 82 as "Bastar Iron Craft" of the GI Act 1999 of the Government of India with registration confirmed by the Controller General of Patents Designs and Trademarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ipindia.nic.in/girindia/treasures_protected/registered_GI_18November2015.pdf|title=State Wise Registration Details Of G.I Applications|accessdate=5 July 2016|publisher=Controller General of Patents Designs and Trademarks|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201065403/http://ipindia.nic.in/girindia/treasures_protected/registered_GI_18November2015.pdf|archivedate=1 February 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''bestiary''', or '''''bestiarum vocabulum''''', is a [[compendium]] of beasts. Originating in the [[Ancient history|ancient world]], bestiaries were made popular in the [[Middle Ages]] in illustrated volumes that described various animals and even rocks. The [[natural history]] and illustration of each beast was usually accompanied by a moral lesson. This reflected the belief that the world itself was the Word of God, and that every living thing had its own special meaning. For example, the [[pelican]], which was believed to tear open its breast to bring its young to life with its own blood, was a living representation of [[Jesus]]. The bestiary, then, is also a reference to the [[symbol]]ic language of [[animals in Christian art|animals in Western Christian art]] and literature.

==History==
The earliest bestiary in the form in which it was later popularized was an anonymous 2nd century [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] volume called the ''[[Physiologus]]'', which itself summarized ancient knowledge and wisdom about animals in the writings of [[Classical antiquity|classical]] authors such as [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[History of Animals|Historia Animalium]]'' and various works by [[Herodotus]], [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Solinus]], [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]] and other naturalists.

Following the ''Physiologus'', Saint [[Isidore of Seville]] (Book XII of the ''[[Etymologiae]]'') and [[Saint Ambrose]] expanded the religious message with reference to passages from the [[Bible]] and the [[Septuagint]]. They and other authors freely expanded or modified pre-existing models, constantly refining the moral content without interest or access to much more detail regarding the factual content. Nevertheless, the often fanciful accounts of these beasts were widely read and generally believed to be true. A few observations found in bestiaries, such as the [[Bird migration|migration]] of birds, were discounted by the natural philosophers of later centuries, only to be rediscovered in the modern scientific era.

Medieval bestiaries are remarkably similar in sequence of the animals of which they treat. Bestiaries were particularly popular in [[England]] and [[France]] around the 12th century and were mainly compilations of earlier texts. The [[Aberdeen Bestiary]] is one of the best known of over 50 manuscript bestiaries surviving today.

Bestiaries influenced early [[heraldry]] in the Middle Ages, giving ideas for [[charge (heraldry)|charges]] and also for the artistic form. Bestiaries continue to give inspiration to coats of arms created in our time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Stephen|editor-last=Friar|title=A New Dictionary of Heraldry|location=London|year=1987|publisher=[[A &amp; C Black|Alphabooks/A&amp;C Black]]|isbn=0 906670 44 6|page=342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two illuminated [[Psalter]]s, the [[Queen Mary Psalter]] ([[British Library]] Ms. Royal 2B, vii) and the [[Isabella Psalter]] (State Library, [[Munich]]), contain full Bestiary cycles. The bestiary in the Queen Mary Psalter is found in the "marginal" decorations that occupy about the bottom quarter of the page, and are unusually extensive and coherent in this work. In fact the bestiary has been expanded beyond the source in the Norman bestiary of Guillaume le Clerc to ninety animals. Some are placed in the text to make correspondences with the [[psalm]] they are illustrating.&lt;ref&gt;The Queen Mary psalter: a study of affect and audience By Anne Rudloff Stanton, p44ff, Diane Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian artist [[Leonardo da Vinci]] also made his own bestiary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Selections from the Bestiary of Leonardo da Vinci | first1=Oliver |last1=Evans |journal=The Journal of American Folklore |volume=64 |number=254 |date=Oct–Dec 1951 |pages=393–396 |jstor=537007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''volucrary'' is a similar collection of the symbols of birds that is sometimes found in conjunction with bestiaries. The most widely known volucrary in the Renaissance was [[Johannes de Cuba]]'s ''Gart der Gesundheit''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Cuba|first1=Jean|title=Garden Of Health|date=1501|publisher=Verard Antoine (Paris)|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b2100150b|archiveurl=http://catalogue.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb386198123|archivedate=2007|language=French|format=758 scanned pages with black &amp; white illustrations}}&lt;/ref&gt; which describes 122 birds and which was printed in 1485.&lt;ref&gt;''Hortus sanitatis deutsch.'' Mainz (Peter Schöffer) 1485; Neudrucke München 1924 and 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bestiary content==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}
Medieval bestiaries often contained detailed descriptions and illustrations of species native to Western Europe, exotic animals and what in modern times are considered to be imaginary animals. Descriptions of the animals included the physical characteristics associated with the creature, although these were often physiologically incorrect, along with the Christian morals that the animal represented. The description was then normally followed with an artistic illustration of the animal as described in the bestiary.

Bestiaries were organized in different ways based upon the text. The descriptions could be organized by animal groupings, such as terrestrial and marine creatures, or presented in an alphabetical manner. However, the texts gave no distinction between existing and imaginary animals. Descriptions of creatures such as [[dragon]]s, [[unicorn]]s, [[basilisk]], [[griffin]] and [[caladrius]] were common in such works and found intermingled amongst accounts of bears, boars, deer, lions, and elephants.

This lack of separation has often been associated with the assumption that people during this time believed in what the modern period classifies as nonexistent or "[[imaginary creatures]]". However, this assumption is currently under debate, with various explanations being offered.

Some scholars, such as Pamela Gravestock, have written on the theory that medieval people did not actually think such creatures existed but instead focused on the belief in the importance of the Christian morals these creatures represented, and that the importance of the moral did not change regardless if the animal existed or not.

The contents of medieval bestiaries were often obtained and created from combining older textual sources and accounts of animals, such as the ''[[Physiologus]]'', with newer observations and writings. In this way, the content of such written works was constantly added to and built upon.

==Modern bestiaries==
In modern times, artists such as [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]] and [[Saul Steinberg]] have produced their own bestiaries. [[Jorge Luis Borges]] wrote a contemporary bestiary of sorts, the ''[[Book of Imaginary Beings]]'', which collects imaginary beasts from bestiaries and fiction. Nicholas Christopher wrote a literary novel called "The Bestiary" (Dial, 2007) that describes a lonely young man's efforts to track down the world's most complete bestiary. [[John Henry Fleming]]'s ''Fearsome Creatures of Florida''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fearsomecreatures.com |title=Fearsome Creatures of Florida by John Henry Fleming |website=Fearsomecreatures.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Pocol Press, 2009) borrows from the medieval bestiary tradition to impart moral lessons about the environment. [[Caspar Henderson]]'s The Book of Barely Imagined Beings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barelyimaginedbeings.com |title=The Book of Barely Imagined Beings |website=Barelyimaginedbeings.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Granta]] 2012, [[Chicago University Press]] 2013), subtitled "A 21st Century Bestiary," explores how humans imagine animals in a time of rapid environmental change. In July 2014, Jonathan Scott wrote The Blessed Book of Beasts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rna.org/news/184377/Beasts-from-the-East.htm |title=Religion News Association &amp; Foundation |website=Rna.org |date=2016-11-21 |accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eastern Christian Publications, featuring 101 animals from the various translations of the Bible, in keeping with the tradition of the bestiary found in the writings of the Saints, including Saint John Chrysostom.

In [[fashion design]], primarily in [[ready-to-wear]] lines, '''boyfriend''' is any style of women's clothing that was modified from a corresponding men's garment. Examples include boyfriend jackets, boyfriend [[jeans]], and boyfriend blazers, which are often more [[unisex]] or looser in appearance and fit than most women's jackets or [[trousers]], though still designed for the female form.

==Background of women in menswear==
Back in the day around the 19th century women wearing anything but dresses, skirts, and corsets was considered absurd. Amelia Bloomer a woman's rights activist in the 1850s was one of the first to change the stereotype, as she introduced the [[Bloomers (clothing)|bloomer]]. In the 1920s the fashion legend Coco Chanel started the menswear line, as she was really into the androgynous look. Other popular fashion icons such as Audrey Hepburn and Marlene Dietrich had menswear style fashion which made this style even more popular in the 1930s. During the war when women took over the men's jobs they were free to wear more masculine clothes, however, when the war ended in the 1950s the housewife went back to dresses and skirts. It was not until the late 1960s and early 70s that menswear inspired fashion was no longer considered a rebellious political statement. In the late 60s Marilyn Monroe wore boyfriend jeans, which started the popularity of the clothing item.&lt;ref&gt;Moffat, Laura. “History of Women Wearing Men’s Clothing.” Kirrin Finch. Accessed September 11, 2017. http://kirrinfinch.com/blog/history-of-women-in-menswear.

The origin of boyfriend fashion is borrowing and wearing a boyfriend's clothes—his distressed jeans, his band tees, his dress shirts, his blazers, his cardigan. The trend expanded when many brands such as [[Gap (clothing retailer)|Gap]], [[Forever 21]], [[H&amp;M]], and [[Urban Outfitters]] began to create boyfriend fashion products or men's-inspired fashion.&lt;ref name=IRWIN&gt;Irwin, Emma. “How Menswear For Women Is Shaping The Future Of Fashion.” Odyssey, August 2, 2017. https://www.theodysseyonline.com/why-the-women-in-menswear-trend-is-important&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boyfriend blazer==  
The boyfriend blazer has been featured in many of the spring 2010 walks such as [[Charlotte Ronson]], [[Cynthia Rowley]], and [[Elie Tahari]], and the trend continued into 2011. There are two main important ways to wear the look: making it oversized, and rolling up the sleeves. The boyfriend trend is all about wearing clothes that look a size too big for the wearer. It is recommended to only go up one size. It balances it out while implying that the sleeves would be too long for the wearer's arms. The boyfriend blazer comes in many different shades, ranging from classic hues of black and gray to whites, pinks, and neons. They are very versatile because they can be worn with a [[cocktail dress]], a skirt and blouse, or even leggings.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fashionising.com/trends/b--Boyfriend-blazer-fashion-trend-how-to-wear-it-2213.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boyfriend jeans==
The boyfriend jeans is one of the hottest pieces of clothing on the market. From Marilyn Monroe to Kim Kardashian the boyfriend jeans have been popular for many years. The boyfriend jean is loose fitting, slouchy, and relaxed looking pants that are heavily distressed. Nowadays a huge majority of celebrity are wearing boyfriend jeans from [[Kendall Jenner]] to [[Reese Witherspoon]] to [[Rihanna]]. The boyfriend jean has been reinvented to be many fits, from more baggy and authentic, to a tighter more tapper version.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.currentelliott.com/what-are-boyfriend-jeans&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Canadian Deaf Theatre.JPG|thumb|200px|Promotional image from 1988.]]
'''Canadian Deaf Theatre''' is Canada's only anglophone deaf professional theatre company.&lt;ref name="Carbin"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Clifton F. Carbin|author2=Dorothy L. Smith|title=Deaf heritage in Canada: a distinctive, diverse, and enduring culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uMGxAAAACAAJ|accessdate=21 March 2011|date=2 May 1996|publisher=McGraw-Hill Ryerson|isbn=978-0-07-551378-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its philosophy is "A belief in the interest and inherent natural ability of deaf people to act and entertain on a serious professional level and to offer something different from that of the hearing/speaking theatrical medium".

CDT was founded in 1989 by Lewis Hartland (born June 16, 1955), a former member of the Canadian Theatre of the Deaf.  It is based in [[Cranbrook, British Columbia]]. Opening night for ''Varieties'', the company's first production, was January 10, 1990. The first performances starred Hartland and hearing actress, Toni Miller, a native of [[Prince George, British Columbia]], who was later replaced by Hartland's deaf wife, Constance Alice (née Harrison).

==Performance==

Presented in [[Mime artist|mime]], sign mime, [[pantomime]], visual vernacular, theatrical clown, [[American Sign Language]], ASL poetry and mime with masks, CDT's performances are designed to delight both deaf and hearing audiences. The company also offers workshops for children and adults on such topics as visual theatre techniques, storytelling, [[creative drama]], the dynamics of communication and mime. The workshops for deaf children are designed to "enhance the student's power of perception, encourage their talents and skills in expressing themselves creatively, and increase their appreciation of the theatre."&lt;ref name="Carbin"/&gt;

==History==

Founder and [[artistic director]], Hartland was born in [[Nelson, British Columbia]] and became deaf at the age of eight months from [[spinal meningitis]]. While a student at the Jericho Hill Provincial School for the Deaf in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]]. (1960–1972), he also took special instruction from a professional mime professor at [[Simon Fraser University]] in [[Burnaby, British Columbia]] (1970). He trained at the Canadian Mime Theatre School in 1977, took an actor's lab with Polish actor Ryszard Cieslak (1977), and presented solo mime performances as Lewis the Mime in [[Canada]] and the U.S. from 1977-1989. He was one of the founding members of the Canadian Theatre of the Deaf and performed with that company in 1976 and 1977. In 1977 Hartland founded the Deaf Mime Company of Toronto, and in 1982, he established the Ontario Theatre of the Deaf; both companies later disbanded. In 1988 and 1989, he studied and performed in the [[United States]] with the [[National Theatre of the Deaf]] in Chester, Connecticut. Enabled by the awarding of grants by the [[Canada Council for the Arts]], Hartland also attended advanced studies with NTD. In the summer of 1989, he was one of the invited performers at The Deaf Way Conference and Festival in [[Washington, D.C.]] While there, he was approached by a representative of the Canadian Cultural Society of the Deaf, who encouraged him to form what became the Canadian Deaf Theatre. CDT was then founded in 1989 with the subsequent establishing of a Board of Directors in [[Cranbrook, British Columbia]] in 1990. CDT received significant provincial and federal grants as well as private donations.

Connie Hartland (b. March 23, 1955) is a consummate performer in her own right. She was born hard of hearing in [[Burnaby, British Columbia]] as a result of maternal [[rubella]] (she is now profoundly deaf), and attended several schools including Jericho Hill Provincial School (1960–1965), the Herbert Symonds Public School in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]] (1965–1966), the Ontario School for the Deaf, Milton (1966–1971 and 1973–1974), and the Ontario School for the Deaf in Belleville (1971–1973). Prior to joining her husband on stage, she travelled through [[Alaska]] presenting workshops in mime, and appeared on television in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]] with her puppets.

At the beginning of each show, the couple's hearing son Samson Hartland (b May 5, 1979), serves as interpreter while his father introduces the concept behind Canadian Deaf Theatre and explains something about their innovative and entertaining techniques.&lt;ref name="Carbin"/&gt;

==Present==

In the summer of 1992, the Hartlands moved to [[Whitehorse, Yukon]] Territory, where they owned and operated a store called Last Frontier Sports Cards and Comics. Hartland hopes to move the CDT from Cranbrook, B.C. to Whitehorse one day and establish it in the [[Yukon]] with a new board of directors. He coaches acting on the side, and both he and his wife are active in the local Whitehorse Deaf community, advocating for such things as [[Telecommunications device for the deaf|TDD]] access and special long distance rates (50 percent discount) for deaf telephone users in the [[Yukon]] and [[Northwest Territories]] (a struggle in which they were assisted by federal [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]] leader [[Audrey McLaughlin]] (Member of Parliament for Yukon Territory) and were successful in achieving). In 2003, they were also successful in lobbying the City of [[Whitehorse, Yukon]] to provide [[closed captioning]] of its publicly broadcast [[City Council]] meetings, making it the first municipality in [[Canada]] to offer such service.

The '''coat of arms of Lancaster University''' is the official [[emblem]] of [[Lancaster University]], in [[Lancashire]], England. It was granted to the university by [[Royal Charter]] on its establishment in 1964.

The [[coat of arms]] has several [[heraldry|heraldic]] elements.&lt;ref name="arms1"&gt;{{cite book|title=Communications toolkit for staff and agencies|url=http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/media/lancaster-university/content-assets/documents/current-staff/brand/LU-CommsToolkitSept2014.pdf|location=Lancaster|publisher=Lancaster University|accessdate=10 March 2015|author=Lancaster University Communications Team}}&lt;/ref&gt; Centrally positioned, a horizontal, wavy blue line refers to the [[River Lune]], a prominent geographic landmark of the city of Lancaster. Secondly, the two red roses are symbols of the [[House of Lancaster]] (and the county of [[Lancashire]]) and are taken directly from the arms of the [[Lancashire County Council]]. The open book represents wisdom and the university's purpose as an institution of learning. Lastly, the Lion ''[[Attitude (heraldry)#Passant|passant]]'' comes from the arms of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]].&lt;ref name="arms1" /&gt;

The arms, slightly modified, may be seen on the university's logo. The full coat of arms also appears on degree certificates and the jerseys of the university's sports teams.

== Blazon ==
[[File:Lancaster University coat of arms.svg|thumb|left|The coat of arms of [[Lancaster University]].]]

The complete '''[[blazon]]''' is the arms surrounded by a 'coat'; the full coat of arms. In addition to the arms, the insignia contains [[quill|quilled pens]] which refer to the learned activities of the university and the rams head, from which the pens protrude, comes from the county of [[Westmorland]]. The supporting bull comes from the arms of [[Cumberland County Council, England|Cumberland Council]] and the dragon represents the ancient [[Kingdom of Cumbria|Cumbria]]. Finally, the flower comes from the arms of the council and the [[Fleur-de-Lis|Fleurs de Lis]] is from the arms of the [[City of Lancaster]].&lt;ref name="motto"&gt;{{cite web|title=Origins and Growth - Lancaster University|url=http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/unihistory/growth/motto.html|location=Lancaster|website=Lancaster University|accessdate=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lancaster University's motto is a component of the coat of arms; taken from a medical pamphlet called ''Famosa Apologia'', which dates from around the early seventeenth century.&lt;ref name="motto" /&gt;

Translated from [[Latin language|Latin]], the phrase "Patet omnibus veritas" means "truth lies open to all". There is also a longer translation:

{{cquote|Those who were before us are not our masters but our leaders. Truth lies open to all. It is not yet anyone's possession. Much of it is left, even for those to come. Nothing, indeed, is more hostile to truth than to take away freedom of speculation.&lt;ref name="motto" /&gt;}}

The '''Coat of arms of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic''' is a symbol created by the [[Polisario Front]], the national [[liberation movement]] of [[Western Sahara]]. The Polisario Front proclaimed the [[Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic]] on February 27, 1976, and both the flag and the coat of arms were adopted as state symbols.

The territory of [[Western Sahara]] is a disputed territory, claimed by:
* [[Morocco]], which controls and administers about 80% of the territory. Currently, the coats of arms of the [[Western Sahara#Moroccan regions and provinces|Moroccan regions of Western Sahara]] are used in this part of Western Sahara.
* The [[Polisario Front]] and the government-in-exile of the [[Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic]] or SADR claim the independence of the territory. The coat of arms of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic are used by these two bodies.

==Description==

The symbol depicts two crossed [[rifle]]s with the [[Flag of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic|SADR flag]] hanging from either [[Mauser]]. Centered above them is a red [[crescent]] and star, [[Islam]]ic and [[Arabic]] imagery. Surrounding the guns and crescent are two [[olive branch]]es, one on either side. At the bottom is written in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] the Polisario motto "حرية ديمقراطية وحدة" ({{Lang-en|"Liberty, democracy, unity"}}) in black on a red banner. Until June 1991 when it was modified, it also contained a hammer between the rifles.

==History==
[[File:Coat of Arms of the Spanish Sahara.svg|thumb|150px|Coat of arms of [[Spanish Sahara]]|left]]
In the late 19th-century, Western Sahara formally became a Spanish colony. After the [[Green March]] pressure and the [[Madrid Accords]] of 1975, [[Spain]] unilaterally disengaged itself leaving the territory to Morocco and [[Mauritania]], who split the territory, giving two thirds to the former, in a movement that was not recognized by the UN. The [[Polisario Front]] rejected this illegal move and declared in [[Bir Lehlou]], the [[Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic]] (SADR) as the state representing an independent Western Sahara.&lt;ref name=CIA&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff|title=CIA - The World Factbook|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/wi.html|publisher=CIA|accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, Mauritania signed a peace treaty with the Polisario front, and Morocco annexed the part formerly controlled by Mauritania. A U.N.-brokered ceasefire was signed in 1991 between the two parties, but the sovereignty of the territory remains unresolved pending ongoing peace-talks.&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt;

===Coat of arms of Spanish Sahara===

The Coat of arms of Spanish Sahara was used for the Spanish colony of [[Spanish Sahara]]. Its interior portion consisted of a yellow camel, a palm tree, and a banner with blue and white stripes, on a green background. This interior portion was surrounded by a red [[bordure]] with four yellow castles and three gray [[Lion (heraldry)|lions rampant]].

[[Image:Integration conceptual.jpg|thumb|A conceptual photograph illustrating INTEGRATION]]
[[File:The Sleep.jpg|thumb|'''"The Sleep"''', a ''Dan Pero Manescu'' analog conceptual photography / 2015]]

'''Conceptual photography'''  is a type of [[photography]] that illustrates an idea. There has been illustrative photographs made since the medium's invention, for example in the earliest staged photographs, such as [[Hippolyte Bayard|Hippolyte Bayard's]] ''Self Portrait as a Drowned Man'' (1840). However, the term Conceptual Photography derives from [[Conceptual Art]] a movement of the late 1960s. Today the term is used to describe either a methodology or a genre.

==Conceptual photography as a methodology==
As a methodology conceptual photography is a type of photography that is staged to represent an idea. The 'concept' is both preconceived and, if successful, understandable in the completed image. It is most often seen in [[advertising]] and [[illustration]] where the picture may reiterate a headline or catchphrase that accompanies it. Photographic advertising and illustration commonly derive from [[Stock photography]], which is often produced in response to current trends in image usage as determined by the research of picture agencies like [[Getty Images]] or [[Branded Entertainment Network|Corbis]]. These photographs are therefore produced to visualize a predetermined concept. The advent of picture editing software like [[Adobe Photoshop]] has allowed the greater manipulation of images to seamlessly combine elements that previously it would only have been possible to combine in graphic illustration.

==Conceptual photography as a genre==
The term 'conceptual photography' used to describe a genre may refer to the use of photography in [[Conceptual Art]] or in contemporary art photography. In either case, the term is not widely used or consistently applied.  

==Conceptual photography and conceptual art==
Conceptual art of the late 1960s and early 1970s often involved photography to document performances, ephemeral sculpture or actions. The artists did not describe themselves as photographers, for example [[Edward Ruscha]] said "Photography's just a playground for me. I'm not a photographer at all."&lt;ref&gt;A.D. Coleman (10 September, 1972), "I'm Not Really A Photographer", ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; These artists are sometimes referred to as conceptual photographers but those who used photography extensively such as [[John Hilliard (artist)|John Hilliard]] and [[John Baldessari]] and [[Pedram Mousavi]] are more often described as photoconceptualists&lt;ref&gt;Melanie Marino, Disposable Matter: Photoconceptual Magazine Work of the 1960s, in The Last Picture Show - Artists using photography 1960–1982, Douglas Fogle, 2003 &lt;/ref&gt; or "artists using photography".

==Conceptual photography and fine-art photography==

Since the 1970s artists using photography like [[Cindy Sherman]] and latterly [[Thomas Ruff]] and [[Thomas Demand]] have been described as conceptual. Although their work does not generally resemble the lo-fi aesthetic of 1960s conceptual art they may use certain methods in common such as documenting performance (Sherman), typological or serial imagery (Ruff) or the restaging of events (Demand). In fact the indebtedness to these and other approaches from Conceptual Art is so widespread in contemporary [[Fine-art photography]] that almost any work might be described as conceptual. The term has perhaps been used most specifically in a negative sense to distinguish some contemporary art photography from [[documentary photography]] or [[Photojournalism]]. This distinction has been made in the coverage of the [[Deutsche Börse Photography Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;Sean O'Hagan, (16 November 2009), [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/nov/16/conceptual-photography-prizes Why conceptual photography is having a prized moment] ''The Guardian''&lt;/ref&gt; Conceptual photography is often used interchangeably with Fine-Art Photography, and there has been some dispute about whether there is a difference between the two. However, the central school of thought is that conceptual photography is a type of fine-art photography.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://digital-photography-school.com/guide-to-creating-unique-conceptual-photography/|title=Your Guide to Creating Unique Conceptual Photography|last=Cole|first=Leanne|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fine art Photography is inclusive of conceptual photography. While all conceptual photography is fine art, not all fine art is conceptual.

{{History of art sidebar}}
'''Contemporary art''' is the [[art]] of today, produced in the second half of the 20th century or in the 21st century. Contemporary artists work in a [[globally influenced]], [[culturally diverse]], and technologically advancing world. Their art is a dynamic combination of [[Medium (arts)|materials]], methods, concepts, and subjects that continue the challenging of boundaries that was already well underway in the 20th century. Diverse and eclectic, contemporary art as a whole is distinguished by the very lack of a uniform, organising principle, ideology, or "[[-ism]]". Contemporary art is part of a cultural dialogue that concerns larger contextual frameworks such as personal and cultural identity, family, community, and nationality.

In vernacular English, ''modern'' and ''contemporary'' are [[synonym]]s, resulting in some conflation of the terms ''[[modern art]]'' and ''contemporary art'' by non-specialists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/art/education/definitions NYU Steinhardt, Department of Art and Arts Professions, New York]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==
[[File:Balloon Dog Yellow.jpg|thumb|[[Jeff Koons]], ''Balloon Dog (Yellow)'', 1994–2000, mirror-polished stainless steel with transparent color coating, 121 x 143 x 45 in. (307.3 x 363.2 x 114.3 cm). [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], Private collection]]
Some define contemporary art as art produced within "our lifetime," recognising that lifetimes and life spans vary. However, there is a recognition that this generic definition is subject to specialized limitations.&lt;ref name="Esaak"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arthistory.about.com/od/current_contemporary_art/f/what_is.htm |title=What is "Contemporary" Art? |first1=Shelley |last1=Esaak |accessdate=28 April 2013 |website=About.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The classification of "contemporary art" as a special type of art, rather than a general adjectival phrase, goes back to the beginnings of [[Modernism]] in the English-speaking world. In [[London]], the Contemporary Art Society was founded in 1910 by the critic [[Roger Fry]] and others, as a private society for buying works of art to place in public museums.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Fry|Fry Roger]], Ed. Craufurd D. Goodwin, ''Art and the Market: Roger Fry on Commerce in Art'', 1999, University of Michigan Press, {{ISBN|0472109022}}, 9780472109029, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Zb8hTlHZOb0C&amp;pg=PA57 google books]&lt;/ref&gt; A number of other institutions using the term were founded in the 1930s, such as in 1938 the [[Contemporary Art Centre of South Australia|Contemporary Art Society]] of [[Adelaide]], [[Australia]],&lt;ref&gt;Also the Contemporary Arts Society of [[Montreal]], 1939–1948&lt;/ref&gt; and an increasing number after 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 257–258&lt;/ref&gt; Many, like the [[Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston]] changed their names from ones using "Modern art" in this period, as Modernism became defined as a historical [[art movement]], and much "modern" art ceased to be "contemporary". The definition of what is contemporary is naturally always on the move, anchored in the present with a start date that moves forward, and the works the Contemporary Art Society bought in 1910 could no longer be described as contemporary.

Particular points that have been seen as marking a change in art styles include the end of World War II and the 1960s. There has perhaps been a lack of natural break points since the 1960s, and definitions of what constitutes "contemporary art" in the 2010s vary, and are mostly imprecise. Art from the past 20 years is very likely to be included, and definitions often include art going back to about 1970;&lt;ref&gt;Some definitions: "Art21 defines contemporary art as the work of artists who are living in the twenty-first century." [http://www.art21.org/teach/on-contemporary-art/contemporary-art-in-context Art21]&lt;/ref&gt; "the art of the late 20th and early 21st century";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/contemporary+art|title=Contemporary art - Define Contemporary art at Dictionary.com|website=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; "the art of the late 20th cent. and early 21st cent., both an outgrowth and a rejection of modern art";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.yahoo.com/reference/encyclopedia/entry/cntmpryart|title=Yahoo|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130720124418/http://education.yahoo.com/reference/encyclopedia/entry/cntmpryart|archivedate=2013-07-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Strictly speaking, the term "contemporary art" refers to art made and produced by artists living today";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/education/teachers/classroom_resources/curricula/contemporary_art/background1.html|title=About Contemporary Art (Education at the Getty)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Art from the 1960s or [19]70s up until this very minute";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arthistory.about.com/od/current_contemporary_art/f/what_is.htm|title=What is Contemporary Art?|author=Shelley Esaak|website=About.com Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes further, especially in museum contexts, as museums which form a permanent collection of contemporary art inevitably find this aging. Many use the formulation "Modern and Contemporary Art", which avoids this problem.&lt;ref&gt;Examples of specializing museums include the [[Strasbourg Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art]] and [[Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art of Trento and Rovereto]]. The ''Oxford Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art'' is one of many book titles to use the phrase.&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller commercial galleries, magazines and other sources may use stricter definitions, perhaps restricting the "contemporary" to work from 2000 onwards. Artists who are still productive after a long career, and ongoing [[art movement]]s, may present a particular issue; galleries and critics are often reluctant to divide their work between the contemporary and non-contemporary.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Sociologist [[Nathalie Heinich]] draws a distinction between modern and contemporary art, describing them as two different paradigms which partially overlap historically. She found that while "[[modern art]]" challenges the conventions of [[Representation (arts)|representation]], "contemporary art" challenges the very notion of an [[artwork]].&lt;ref&gt;Heinich, Nathalie, Ed. Gallimard, ''Le paradigme de l'art contemporain : Structures d'une révolution artistique '', 2014, {{ISBN|2070139239}}, 9782070139231, [https://books.google.fr/books/about/Le_paradigme_de_l_art_contemporain_Struc.html?id=vIQICgAAQBAJ&amp;redir_esc=y google books]&lt;/ref&gt; She regards [[Marcel Duchamp|Duchamp]]'s ''[[Marcel Duchamp's Fountain|Fountain]]'' (which was made in the 1910s in the midst of the triumph of modern art) as the starting point of contemporary art, which gained momentum after [[World War II]] with [[Gutai group|Gutai]]'s performances, [[Yves Klein]]'s monochromes and [[Robert Rauschenberg|Rauschenberg]]'s ''[[Erased de Kooning Drawing]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhclwyYYbtY Nathalie Heinich lecture "Contemporary art: an artistic revolution ?] at 'Agora des savoirs' 21th edition, 6 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
[[File:Irbid-Jordan-Nida Alhamzeh-029.jpg|alt=Irbid, Jordan, "We are Arabs. We are Humans"|thumb|Irbid, Jordan, "We are Arabs. We are Humans". '''[[Inside Out Project|Inside Out]]''' is a global participatory art project, initiated by the French photographer [[JR (artist)|JR]], an example of [[Street art]]]]
One of the difficulties many people have in approaching contemporary artwork is its diversity&amp;mdash;diversity of material, form, subject matter, and even time periods. It is "distinguished by the very lack of a uniform organizing principle, ideology, or -ism"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.art21.org/learn/tools-for-teaching/on-contemporary-art/contemporary-art-in-context Contemporary Art in Context. (2016). Retrieved December 11, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; that we so often see in other, and oftentimes more familiar, art periods and movements. Broadly speaking, we see [[Modernism]] as looking at modernist principles&amp;mdash;the focus of the work is [[Self-reference|self-referential]], investigating its own materials (investigations of line, shape, color, form). Likewise, Impressionism looks at our perception of a moment through light and color as opposed to attempts at stark [[Realism (arts)|realism]] ([[Realism (art movement)|Realism]], too, is an artistic movement). Contemporary art, on the other hand, does not have one, single objective or point of view. Its view instead is unclear, perhaps reflective of the world today. It can be, therefore, contradictory, confusing, and open-ended. There are, however, a number of common themes that have appeared in contemporary works. While these are not exhaustive, notable themes include: [[identity politics]], the body, [[globalization]] and migration, [[technology]], contemporary society and culture, time and memory, and institutional and political critique.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, J., &amp; McDaniel, C. (2012). ''Themes of Contemporary Art: Visual Art after 1980'' (3rd ed.). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Postmodernism|Post-modern]], [[Post-structuralism|post-structuralist]], [[Feminist theory|feminist]], and [[Marxist Theory|Marxist theory]] have played important roles in the development of contemporary theories of art.

==Institutions==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2018}}
[[File:MOCA North Miami.jpg|thumb|The [[Museum of Contemporary Art, North Miami|Museum of Contemporary Art]] in [[Miami, Florida]].]]
The functioning of the art world is dependent on art institutions, ranging from major museums to private galleries, non-profit spaces, art schools and publishers, and the practices of individual artists, curators, writers, collectors, and philanthropists. A major division in the art world is between the for-profit and non-profit sectors, although in recent years the boundaries between for-profit private and non-profit public institutions have become increasingly blurred.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Most well-known contemporary art is exhibited by professional artists at commercial [[Contemporary art gallery|contemporary art galleries]], by private collectors, art auctions, corporations, publicly funded arts organizations, [[contemporary art museums]] or by artists themselves in [[artist-run space]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.artnet.com/market/art-language-philippe-meaille-french-chateau-310458|title=Largest Art &amp; Language Collection Finds Home - artnet News|date=2015-06-23|work=artnet News|access-date=2018-09-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary artists are supported by grants, awards, and prizes as well as by direct sales of their work. Career artists train at [[art school]] or emerge from other fields.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

[[File:Château de Montsoreau Val de Loire.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Château de Montsoreau-Museum of Contemporary Art]] in [[Montsoreau]], [[France]].]]
There are close relationships between publicly funded contemporary art organizations and the commercial sector. For instance, in 2005 the book ''Understanding International Art Markets and Management'' reported that in Britain a handful of dealers represented the artists featured in leading publicly funded contemporary art museums.&lt;ref&gt;Derrick Chong in Iain Robertson, ''Understanding International Art Markets And Management'', Routledge, 2005, p95. {{ISBN|0-415-33956-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corporations have also integrated themselves into the contemporary [[art world]], exhibiting contemporary art within their premises, organizing and sponsoring contemporary art awards, and building up extensive corporate collections.&lt;ref&gt;Chin-Tao Wu, ''Privatising Culture: Corporate Art Intervention Since the 1980s'', Verso, 2002, p14. {{ISBN|1-85984-472-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corporate advertisers frequently use the prestige associated with contemporary art and [[coolhunting]] to draw the attention of consumers to [[luxury goods]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The institutions of art have been criticized for regulating what is designated as contemporary art. [[Outsider art]], for instance, is literally contemporary art, in that it is produced in the present day. However, one critic has argued it is not considered so because the artists are self-taught and are thus assumed to be working outside of an art historical context.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Alan Fine, ''Everyday Genius: Self-Taught Art and the Culture of Authenticity'', University of Chicago Press, 2004, pp42-43. {{ISBN|0-226-24950-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Craft activities, such as textile design, are also excluded from the realm of contemporary art, despite large audiences for exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Dormer, ''The Culture of Craft: Status and Future'', Manchester University Press, 1996, p175. {{ISBN|0-7190-4618-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Art critic Peter Timms has said that attention is drawn to the way that craft objects must subscribe to particular values in order to be admitted to the realm of contemporary art. "A ceramic object that is intended as a subversive comment on the nature of beauty is more likely to fit the definition of contemporary art than one that is simply beautiful."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Timms, ''What's Wrong with Contemporary Art?'', UNSW Press, 2004, p17. {{ISBN|0-86840-407-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At any one time a particular place or group of artists can have a strong influence on subsequent contemporary art. For instance, The [[Ferus Gallery]] was a commercial gallery in Los Angeles and re-invigorated the Californian contemporary art scene in the late fifties and the sixties.

==Public attitudes==
Contemporary art can sometimes seem at odds with a public that does not feel that art and its institutions share its values.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary Jane Jacob]] and Michael Brenson, ''Conversations at the Castle: Changing Audiences and Contemporary Art'', MIT Press, 1998, p30. {{ISBN|0-262-10072-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Britain, in the 1990s, contemporary art became a part of popular culture, with artists becoming stars, but this did not lead to a hoped-for "cultural utopia".&lt;ref&gt;Julian Stallabrass, ''High Art Lite: British Art in the 1990s'', Verso, 1999, pp1-2. {{ISBN|1-85984-721-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics like [[Julian Spalding]] and [[Donald Kuspit]] have suggested that skepticism, even rejection, is a legitimate and reasonable response to much contemporary art.&lt;ref&gt;Spalding, Julian, ''The Eclipse of Art: Tackling the Crisis in Art Today'', Prestel Publishing, 2003. {{ISBN|3-7913-2881-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Ashbee in an essay called "Art Bollocks" criticizes "much installation art, photography, conceptual art, video and other practices generally called post-modern" as being too dependent on verbal explanations in the form of theoretical discourse.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipod.org.uk/reality/art_bollocks.asp |title=Art Bollocks |publisher=Ipod.org.uk |date=1990-05-05 |accessdate=2011-08-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716210004/http://www.ipod.org.uk/reality/art_bollocks.asp |archivedate=16 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the acceptance of non traditional art in museums has increased due to changing perspectives on what constitutes an art piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/boundless-arthistory/chapter/what-is-art/|title=What is Art? {{!}} Boundless Art History|website=courses.lumenlearning.com|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concerns==
{{Main|Classificatory disputes about art}}
A common concern since the early part of the 20th century has been the question of what constitutes art. In the contemporary period (1950 to now), the concept of [[avant-garde]]&lt;ref&gt;Fred Orton &amp; [[Griselda Pollock]], ''Avant-Gardes and Partisans Reviewed''. Manchester University, 1996. {{ISBN|0-7190-4399-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; may come into play in determining what art is noticed by galleries, museums, and collectors.

The concerns of contemporary art come in for criticism too. [[Andrea Rosen Gallery|Andrea Rosen]] has said that some contemporary painters "have absolutely no idea of what it means to be a contemporary artist" and that they "are in it for all the wrong reasons."&lt;ref name="NYT00"&gt;Haas, Nancy (2000-03-05), "Stirring Up the Art World Again". ''The New York Times'', [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D03E4DB1638F936A35750C0A9669C8B63&amp;fta=y].&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Denmark culture}}

'''Danish art''' is the visual arts produced in [[Denmark]] or by Danish artists. It goes back thousands of years with significant artifacts from the 2nd millennium BC, such as the [[Trundholm sun chariot]].  For many early periods, it is usually considered as part of the wider [[Nordic art]] of [[Scandinavia]].  Art from what is today [[Denmark]] forms part of the art of the [[Nordic Bronze Age]], and then [[Norse art|Norse]] and [[Viking art]].  Danish medieval painting is almost entirely known from [[church frescos in Denmark|church frescos]] such as those from the 16th-century artist known as the [[Elmelunde Master]].

The Reformation greatly disrupted Danish artistic traditions, and left the existing body of painters and sculptors without large markets. The requirements of the court and aristocracy were mainly for portraits, usually by imported artists, and it was not until the 18th century that large numbers of Danes were trained in contemporary styles. For an extended period of time thereafter art in Denmark either was imported from Germany and the Netherlands or Danish artists studied abroad and produced work that was seldom inspired by Denmark itself. From the late 18th century on, the situation changed radically. Beginning with the [[Danish Golden Age]], a distinct tradition of Danish art began and has continued to flourish until today.  Due to generous art subsidies, contemporary Danish art has a big production per capita.

Though usually not especially a major centre for art production or exporter of art, Denmark has been relatively successful in keeping its art; in particular, the relatively mild nature of the [[Danish Reformation]], and the lack of subsequent extensive rebuilding and redecoration of churches, has meant that with other Scandinavian countries, Denmark has unusually rich survivals of medieval church paintings and fittings.  One period when Nordic art exerted a strong influence over the rest of northern Europe was in Viking art, and there are many survivals, both in stone monuments left untouched around the countryside, and objects excavated in modern times.

==Nordic Bronze Age==
[[File:Gundestrupkarret1.jpg|thumb|The Gundestrup cauldron]]
[[Lur]]s are a distinctive type of giant curving Bronze Age horn, of which 35 of the 53 known examples have been found in bogs in Denmark, very often in pairs.  They are normally made of bronze, and often decorated.

A possibly alien find in Denmark is the [[Gundestrup cauldron]], a richly decorated [[Silversmithery|silver vessel]], thought to date to the 1st century BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic-art/101803/112224/Gundestrup-Caldron-a-Celtic-ritual-vessel-1st-century-BC Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt; It was found in 1891 in a [[peat bog]] near the hamlet of Gundestrup in north-eastern Jutland. The silversmithing of the plates is very skilled. The bowl, 70&amp;nbsp;cm across, was beaten from a single ingot.{{cn|date=December 2016}}  Now in the [[National Museum of Denmark]], it is the largest known example of European silver work from the period. The style and workmanship suggest [[Thracian]] origin, while the imagery seems [[Celtic art|Celtic]], so it may not reflect local styles.

==Norse art==
The [[Germanic Iron Age]] period of about 400-800 AD is represented by the [[Golden Horns of Gallehus]], now known only from drawings since they were stolen and melted down in 1802, and significant deposits from [[weapons sacrifice]] such as that at [[Illerup Ådal]], where 15,000 items were found, deposited during the period 200-500.

Danish sites have given their names to two of the six main styles of Viking or [[Norse art]], [[Jelling style]] (10th century) and its successor [[Mammen style]] (10-11th centuries), though the other styles are also represented in Denmark.  Only one Danish [[ship burial]] is known, from Ladbyskibet.  The images on the [[runestone]]s at [[Jelling stones|Jelling]] are probably the best known Danish works of the period.  Although little of their original paint remains today, copies of the largest stone in the [[National Museum of Denmark]] and in the museum at Jelling have been redecorated in vivid colours based on the fragments of paint which remained on the original.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emu.dk/gsk/fag/his/historie-kanon/jellingsten.html Jellingstenen - en del af historiekanonen.

==Renaissance to the 18th century==
[[File:Landschaft mit Nordlicht.jpg|thumb|left|''Landscape with Northern Lights - Attempt to Paint the Aurora Borealis'', 1790s, by [[Jens Juel (painter)|Jens Juel]].]]
Danish [[panel painting]] and painted [[wood-carving]] of the late Middle Ages was mostly by, or heavily influenced by, the prevailing North German styles, especially those of [[Hamburg]] and other [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] cities.  At the [[Protestant Reformation]] religious painting virtually ceased, and for a long period the most notable portraits of the royal family were made by foreign artists, such as [[Hans Holbein the Younger]]'s portrait of [[Christina of Denmark]]. [[Albrecht Dürer]]'s portrait of her father [[Christian II of Denmark]], painted in [[Brussels]] in 1521, has not survived, though portraits of him by other foreign artists have.

The establishment of the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts]] in 1754 followed the general European pattern, and was intended to develop a national school and reduce the need to import artists from other countries.  After a period of development its pupils were indeed to lead the creation of a distinct Danish style.  After an architect, the third and fifth Director was [[Johannes Wiedewelt]] (1772–1777) and from (1780-1789), a [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] sculptor trained in Italy and France, who had followed his father as court sculptor, and is remembered for his memorials and garden decorations including the monument of [[Frederick V of Denmark|King Frederick V]] in [[Roskilde Cathedral]] and the Naval Monument in Holmens Cemetery.  The first painter to lead it was the Swedish-born [[Carl Gustaf Pilo]] (c. 1711 – 1793), a portraitist and history painter in the grand style, and the next [[Nikolaj Abraham Abildgaard]] (1743–1809), himself an ex-student, who developed a [[Neoclassicism|Neo-Classical]] style.  Leading Danish artists teaching at the Academy included [[Christian August Lorentzen]] and [[Jens Juel (painter)|Jens Juel]], also later Director.  Unlike in England, for example, most leading Danish artists for at least the next century trained at the Academy and often returned to teach there, and the tension between [[academic art]] and other styles is much less a feature of Danish art history than that of France, England or other countries.
[[File:Thorvaldsens Ganymedes.jpg|thumb|''Ganymede and the Eagle'' by [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]],  1817]]

A student of Abildgaard's period at the Academy was [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]] (1770–1844), by far the most famous Danish sculptor, who along with the Italian [[Canova]] was recognised across Europe as the leading Neoclassical sculptor.  Among his works are the colossal series of statues of [[Jesus|Christ]] and the twelve [[Twelve apostles|Apostles]] for the rebuilding of [[Church of Our Lady (Copenhagen)|Vor Frue Kirke]] in Copenhagen. Motifs for his works (reliefs, statues, and busts) were drawn mostly from [[Greek mythology]], but he also created portraits of important personalities, as in his [[tomb monument]] for [[Pope Pius VII]] in [[St Peter's Basilica, Rome]]. His works can be seen in many European countries, but there is a very large collection at the [http://www.thorvaldsensmuseum.dk/ Thorvaldsen Museum] in Copenhagen.  He was based in Rome for many years, and played an important role in encouraging young Danish artists spending time in the city. Another important Neoclassicist produced by the Academy was the painter [[Asmus Jacob Carstens]], whose later career was all spent in Italy or Germany.

The establishment in 1775 of the [[Royal Copenhagen]] [[Porcelain]] Factory was another royal initiative, typical of monarchies in the period, though the business has outlasted the great majority of such factories, and survives today as part of a larger group, which also includes the [[Kosta Glasbruk]] glass company, founded in 1742 by two army officers, and the [[Orrefors Glasbruk]] (founded 1898), all known internationally.

==The Golden Age==
{{main|Danish Golden Age}}

Around the beginning of the 19th century the [[Golden Age of Danish Painting]] emerged to form a distinct national style for the first time since the Middle Ages; the period lasted until the middle of the 19th century.  It has a style drawing on [[Dutch Golden Age painting]], especially its [[landscape painting]],&lt;ref&gt;Dutch paintings, and landscapes, dominated in the 18th century Danish collections that we have records of. North, 308-9 [https://books.google.com/books?id=XGui9XJ3ObIC&amp;pg=PA309&amp;dq=Danish+Golden+Age+painting&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=a43wSteONozIyQTslY38AQ#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; and depicting northern light that is soft but allows strong contrasts of colour.  The treatment of scenes is typically an idealized version of reality, but unpretentiously so, appearing more [[Realism (visual arts)|realist]] than is actually the case. Interior scenes, often small portrait groups, are also common, with a similar treatment of humble domestic objects and furniture, often of the artist's circle of friends.  Little Danish art was seen outside the country (indeed it mostly remains there to this day) and the Danish-trained leader of German Romantic painting [[Caspar David Friedrich]] was important in spreading its influence in Germany.

A crucial figure was [[Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg]], who had studied in Paris with [[Jacques-Louis David]] and was further influenced towards [[Neo-Classicism]] by Thorwaldsen.  Eckersberg taught at the Academy from 1818 to 1853, becoming director from 1827 to 1828, and was an important influence on the following generation, in which landscape painting came to the fore.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/eckersberginfo.shtm Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg.

*[[Christen Købke]] (1810–1848), influenced by [[Niels Laurits Høyen]], an art historian who promoted a nationalistic approach calling for artists to search for subject matter in the folk life of their country instead of searching for themes in other countries such as Italy;
*[[Wilhelm Marstrand]] (1810–1873), a vastly productive artist who mastered a remarkable variety of genres, remembered especially for a number of his works which have become familiar signposts of Danish history and culture: scenes from the drawing-rooms and streets of Copenhagen during his younger days; the festivity and public life captured in Rome; the many representative portraits of citizens and innovators; even the monumentalist commissions for universities and the monarchy;
*[[Martinus Rørbye]] (1803–1848), remembered for his [[genre painting]]s of Copenhagen, for his landscapes and for his [[architectural painting]]s, as well as for the many sketches he made during his travels to countries rarely explored at the time.
Among other artists, [[C.A. Jensen]] (1792–1870) specialized almost exclusively in portraits.

At the end of the period painting style, especially in landscape art, became caught up in the political issue of the [[Schleswig-Holstein Question]], a vital matter for Danes, but notoriously impenetrable for most others in Europe.

==Later 19th century==
[[File:FrdrksbrgBySkovgaard.jpg|thumb|right|[[P.C. Skovgaard]]: Frederiksborg Palace]]
Danish painting continued many of the characteristics of the Golden Age, but gradually moved closer to styles of the rest of Europe, especially Germany.  Artists include:
*[[Jørgen Roed]] (1808–1888), who painted many portraits as well as a number of altarpieces and religious paintings, including ''Jesu Korsfæstelse'' (Crucifixion of Jesus) for the restored church at [[Frederiksborg Palace]];
[[File:Gethsemane Carl Bloch.jpg|thumb|left|[[Carl Heinrich Bloch|Carl Bloch]], ''Gethsemane'']]
*[[Johan Lundbye]] (1818–1848), remembered for his animal paintings and landscapes, especially those of [[Zealand (Denmark)|Sealand]] including the large ''Kystparti ved Isefjord'' (Coast View by Isefjord);
*[[P.C. Skovgaard]] (1817–1875), primarily known for his landscape paintings, for the special role he played in portraying Denmark’s nature, helping to develop a unique Danish art form, and his growing interest in portraying atmosphere and light.
[[Elisabeth Jerichau-Baumann]] (1819–1881) was born in [[Żoliborz]] (Jolibord) a [[borough]] of [[Warsaw]] but moved to Denmark when she married Danish sculptor [[Jens Adolf Jerichau]] in 1846. She is best known for her portraits and was commissioned by the [[Danish Royal Family]] to paint their portraits to the annoyance and jealousy of local artists. The mild eroticism of a few of her paintings was looked upon unfavourably by many at the time but she remained aloof, perhaps reassured by the fact that some of her husband's sculptures were erotic in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Ellery Berg, (1884), ''The Drama, Painting, Poetry, and Song'', P.F. Collier, New York. digitized by Google.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carl Heinrich Bloch]] (1834–1890) was a rare Danish [[history painter]], mostly of Biblical subjects, who developed his [[academic art|academic]] style in Italy before returning to Copenhagen in 1866. He was commissioned to produce 23 paintings for the Chapel at [[Frederiksborg Palace]] consisting of scenes from the life of [[Christ]] which have become very popular as illustrations. For over 40 years [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] has made much use of Carl Bloch's paintings, especially those from the Frederiksborg Palace collection, in its church buildings and printed media.

[[Edvard Eriksen]] (1876–1959) is best known as the sculptor of the bronze ''[[The Little Mermaid (statue)|Little Mermaid]]'' statue in [[Copenhagen]]. Based on the story by [[Hans Christian Andersen]], he completed the work in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gravsted.dk/person.php?navn=edvarderiksen Edvard Christian Johannes Eriksen.

In 1871, [[Holger Drachmann]] (1846–1908) and [[Karl Madsen]] (1855–1938) visited [[Skagen]] in the far north of [[Jutland]] where they quickly built up one of Scandinavia's most successful [[Skagen Painters|artists' colonies]]. They were soon joined by [[P.S.

Danish [[expressionism|expressionist]] landscape painting developed between the world wars with [[Jens Søndergaard]] and [[Oluf Høst]] as its main representatives. In parallel, younger artists such as [[Niels Lergaard]], [[Lauritz Hartz]] and [[Karl Bovin]] adopted the light French colours and formalism of [[modernism]], founding the [[Corner painters|Corner group of artists]] in 1932. Around the same time, [[Edvard Weie]], the Swedish artist [[Karl Isakson]], [[Olaf Rude]], [[Kræsten Iversen]], [[Oluf Høst]] and [[Niels Lergaard]] were attracted by the natural beauty of the Baltic islands of [[Bornholm]] and the much smaller [[Christiansø]]. Together they initiated the so-called [[Bornholm school of painters|Bornholm School]] providing the basis of the permanent exhibition at the [[Bornholm Art Museum]] near [[Gudhjem]].

He is considered as one of the founders of the Linien II movement, part of concrete art at the time.  Several {{who|date=October 2011}} known artists today have been greatly influenced by Richard Winther.  Many of his paintings were done on canvas and [[masonite]], but in an effort to simplify his art he not only diminished the number of colors he used but also switched to paint on cardboard. He was not shy about revisiting a theme and many years later amended some of his works.  Also several of his works are presented on both sides of the same cardboard. He used photographic cameras to compose art and when he was not satisfied with the capabilities of the machines, he started making his own designs.  He is known for his 360 degree cameras, instruments which are objects of art in themselves. Among the many prizes he was awarded, were the Eckersberg Medal (1971), Thorvaldsen Medal (1997) and the Prince Eugen Medal.

===Margrethe II's tapestries===
On the occasion of her 50th birthday in 1990, [[Queen Margrethe II]] decided to use a gift from industry of 13 million Danish crowns to produce a series of tapestries tracing the history of Denmark from the beginnings to the present day. Woven by the historic [[Gobelins Manufactory|Manufacture des Gobelins]] in Paris, the tapestries were based on full-sized sketches by the versatile Danish artist [[Bjørn Nørgaard]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://bjoernnoergaard.dk/gobeliner/index_eng.html Tapestries for the Queen of Denmark.

{{Muhammad}}
The permissibility of '''depictions of Muhammad''' in [[Islam]] has been a contentious issue. Oral and written descriptions of [[Muhammad]] are readily accepted by all traditions of Islam, but there is disagreement about visual depictions.&lt;ref name=best&gt;{{cite journal

Esposito - 2011 p. 14; for hadith see [[Sahih al-Bukhari]], Hadith: 7.834, 7.838, 7.840, 7.844,  7.846&lt;/ref&gt; It is agreed on all sides that there is no authentic visual tradition as to the appearance of Muhammad, although there are early legends of portraits of him, and written physical descriptions whose authenticity is often accepted.

The question of whether images in [[Islamic art]], including those depicting Muhammad, can be considered as [[religious art]] remains a matter of contention among scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (2010), p.27&lt;/ref&gt; They appear in illustrated books that are normally works of history or poetry, including those with religious subjects; the Quran is never illustrated: "context and intent are essential to understanding Islamic pictorial art. The Muslim artists creating images of Muhammad, and the public who beheld them, understood that the images were not objects of worship. Nor were the objects so decorated used as part of religious worship".&lt;ref&gt;Cosman, Pelner and Jones, Linda Gale.

However, scholars concede that such images have "a spiritual element", and were also sometimes used in informal religious devotions celebrating the day of the [[Mi'raj]].&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (2010), p.27 (quote) and 43&lt;/ref&gt; Many visual depictions only show Muhammad with his face veiled, or symbolically represent him as a flame; other images, notably from before about 1500, show his face.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (2005), pp. 239, 247–253&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="January2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brendan January|title=The Arab Conquests of the Middle East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K9XGWkkFy0sC&amp;pg=PA34|accessdate=14 November 2011|date=1 February 2009|publisher=Twenty-First Century Books|isbn=978-0-8225-8744-6|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Safi2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Omid Safi|title=Memories of Muhammad: Why the Prophet Matters|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s63i21E9dr8C&amp;pg=PA171|accessdate=14 November 2011|date=2 November 2010|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-123135-3|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the notable exception of modern-day Iran,&lt;ref name="GruberHaugbolle2013"/&gt; depictions of Muhammad were rare, never numerous in any community or era throughout Islamic history,&lt;ref name="Arnold"&gt;{{Cite book|publisher = Gorgias Press LLC|isbn = 978-1-931956-91-8|last = Arnold|first = Thomas W.|title = Painting in Islam, a Study of the Place of Pictorial Art in Muslim Culture|orig-year = First published in 1928 |date = 2002–2011|pages = 91–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Plas1987"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dirk van der Plas|title=Effigies dei: essays on the history of religions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ops3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA124|accessdate=14 November 2011|year=1987|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-08655-5|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; and appeared almost exclusively in the private medium of Persian and other [[Persian miniature|miniature]] book illustration.&lt;ref name="Ernst2004"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ernst|first1=Carl W.|authorlink1=Carl W.

Visual images of Muhammad in the non-Islamic West have always been infrequent. In the Middle Ages they were mostly hostile, and most often appear in illustrations of [[Dante]]'s poetry.  In the Renaissance and Early Modern period, Muhammad was sometimes depicted, typically in a more neutral or heroic light. These depictions began to encounter protests from Muslims, and in the age of the internet, a handful of caricature depictions printed in the European press have caused global protests and controversy, and been associated with violence.

==Background==
{{main|Aniconism in Islam}}
In Islam, although nothing in the [[Quran]] explicitly bans images, some supplemental [[hadith]] explicitly ban the drawing of images of any living creature; other hadith tolerate images, but never encourage them. Hence, most Muslims avoid visual depictions of Muhammad or [[Prophets of Islam|any other prophet]] such as [[Moses]] or [[Abraham]].&lt;ref name=best/&gt;&lt;ref name=USSC&gt;{{cite web|url={{SCOTUS URL|about/north&amp;southwalls.pdf}} |format=PDF|title=Courtroom Friezes: North and South Walls|author=Office of the Curator|date=2003-05-08|accessdate=2007-07-08|work=Information Sheet, Supreme Court of the United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=explaining&gt;{{cite news|title=Explaining the outrage|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2006-02-08/news/0602080383_1_prophet-muhammad-cartoons-muslims|date=2006-02-08|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most [[Sunni]] Muslims believe that visual depictions of all the [[prophets of Islam]] should be prohibited&lt;ref name=Larsson&gt;{{cite book|last=Larsson|first=Göran|title=Muslims and the New Media|year=2011|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=978-1-4094-2750-6|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are particularly averse to visual representations of Muhammad.&lt;ref name=BergenMuhammad&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/63BsneOUJ?url=http://www.hf.uib.no/religion/popularikonografi/devotion04.html Devotion in pictures: Muslim popular iconography – The prophet Muhammad], [[University of Bergen]]&lt;/ref&gt; The key concern is that the use of images can encourage [[idolatry]].&lt;ref name=Eaton&gt;{{cite book|last=Eaton|first=Charles Le Gai|title=Islam and the destiny of man|year=1985|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-88706-161-5|page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Shia]] Islam, however, images of Muhammad are quite common nowadays, even though Shia scholars historically were against such depictions.&lt;ref name=BergenMuhammad/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Walker Arnold]] says "It was not merely Sunni schools of law but Shia jurists also who fulminated against this figured art. Because the Persians are Shiites, many Europeans writers have assumed that the Shia sect had not the same objection to representing living being as the rival set of the Sunni; but such an opinion ignores the fact that Shiisum did not become the state church in Persia until the rise of the Safivid dynasty at the beginning of the 16th century."&lt;/ref&gt; Still, many Muslims who take a stricter view of the supplemental traditions will sometimes challenge any depiction of Muhammad, including those created and published by non-Muslims.&lt;ref name=facts&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religionfacts.com/islam/things/depictions-of-muhammad-in-islamic-art.htm|accessdate=2007-07-06|title=Islamic Figurative Art and Depictions of Muhammad|publisher=religionfacts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some major religions have experienced times during their history when [[aniconism|images of their religious figures were forbidden]]. In Judaism, one of the [[Ten Commandments]] forbids "graven images".  In [[Byzantine]] Christianity during the periods of [[byzantine iconoclasm|Iconoclasm]] in the 8th century, and again during the 9th century, visual representations of sacred figures were forbidden, and only the [[Christian cross|Cross]] could be depicted in churches. The visual representation of Jesus and other religious figures remains a concern in parts of [[Protestant Christianity]].&lt;ref name=Halicks&gt;{{cite news|title=Images of Muhammad: Three ways to see a cartoon|author=Richard Halicks|date=2006-02-12|work=[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portraiture of Muhammad in Islamic literature==

A number of ''hadith'' and other writings of the early Islamic period include stories in which portraits of Muhammad appear. [[Abu Hanifa Dinawari]], [[Ibn al-Faqih]], [[Ibn Wahshiyya]] and [[Abu Nu`aym]] tell versions of a story in which the Byzantine Emperor [[Heraclius]] is visited by two Meccans. He shows them a cabinet, handed down to him from [[Alexander the Great]] and originally created by God for Adam, each of whose drawers contains a portrait of a prophet. They are astonished to see a portrait of Muhammad in the final drawer. [[Sadid al-Din al-Kazaruni]] tells a similar story in which the Meccans are visiting the king of China. [[Kisa'i]] tells that God did indeed give portraits of the prophets to Adam.&lt;ref name=Grabar&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grabar|first=Oleg|title=The Story of Portraits of the Prophet Muhammad|journal=Studia Islamica|year=2003|issue=96|pages=19–38|jstor=1596240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibn Wahshiyya and Abu Nu'ayn tell a second story in which a Meccan merchant visiting Syria is invited to a Christian monastery where a number of sculptures and paintings depict prophets and saints. There he sees the images of Muhammad and Abu Bakr, as yet unidentified by the Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Asani|first=Ali|title=Celebrating Muhammad: Images of the Prophet in Popular Muslim Piety|year=1995|publisher=University of South Carolina Press|location=Columbia, SC|pages=64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an 11th-century story, Muhammad is said so have sat for a portrait by an artist retained by [[Sassanid]] king [[Kavadh II]]. The king liked the portrait so much that he placed it on his pillow.&lt;ref name=Grabar/&gt;

Later, [[Al-Maqrizi]] tells a story in which [[Muqawqis]], ruler of Egypt, meets with Muhammad's envoy. He asks the envoy to describe Muhammad and checks the description against a portrait of an unknown prophet which he has on a piece of cloth. The description matches the portrait.&lt;ref name=Grabar/&gt;

In a 17th-century [[Islam in China|Chinese]] story, the king of China asks to see Muhammad, but Muhammad instead sends his portrait. The king is so enamoured of the portrait that he is converted to Islam, at which point the portrait, having done its job, disappears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leslie|first=Donald|title=Islam in Traditional China|year=1986|publisher=Canberra College of Advanced Education|location=Canberra|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Verbal descriptions===
{{main|Shama'il Muhammadiyah|Hilya}}
[[File:Hilye-i serif 2.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[hilya|Hilye]]'' by [[Hâfiz Osman]] (1642–1698)]]
In one of the earliest sources, [[Ibn Sa'd]]'s ''Kitab al-Tabaqat al-Kabir'', there are numerous verbal descriptions of Muhammad. One description sourced to [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] is as follows:

: ''The Apostle of Allah, may Allah bless him, is neither too short nor too tall. His hair are neither curly nor straight, but a mixture of the two. He is a man of black hair and large skull. His complexion has a tinge of redness. His shoulder bones are broad and his palms and feet are fleshy. He has long ''al-masrubah'' which means hair growing from neck to navel. He is of long eye-lashes, close eyebrows, smooth and shining fore-head and long space between two shoulders. When he walks he walks inclining as if coming down from a height. [...] I never saw a man like him before him or after him.''&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Sa'd – ''Kitabh al-Tabaqat al-Kabir'', as translated by S. Moinul and H.K. Ghazanfar, Kitab Bhavan, New Delhi, n.d.{{unreliable source?|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period onwards such texts have been presented on calligraphic ''[[hilya]]'' panels (Turkish: ''hilye'', pl. ''hilyeler''), commonly surrounded by an elaborate frame of [[Ottoman illumination|illuminated decoration]] and either included in books or, more often, [[muraqqa]]s or albums, or sometimes placed in wooden frames so that they can hang on a wall.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (2005), p.231-232&lt;/ref&gt;  The elaborated form of the calligraphic tradition was founded in the 17th century by the Ottoman calligrapher [[Hâfiz Osman]]. While containing a concrete and artistically appealing description of Muhammad's appearance, they complied with the strictures against figurative depictions of Muhammad, leaving his appearance to the viewer's imagination.  Several parts of the complex design were named after parts of the body, from the head downwards, indicating the explicit intention of the hilya as a substitute for a figurative depiction.&lt;ref name="Peters2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=F. E. Peters|title=Jesus and Muhammad: Parallel Tracks, Parallel Lives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=olEi-1LZYYQC&amp;pg=PA160|accessdate=5 November 2011|date=10 November 2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-974746-7|pages=160–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brockopp2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan E. Brockopp|title=The Cambridge companion to Muḥammad|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o58K2t344YQC&amp;pg=PA130|accessdate=6 November 2011|date=30 April 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-71372-6|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ottoman ''hilye'' format customarily starts with a [[basmala]], shown on top, and is separated in the middle by {{cite quran|21|107|style=ref}}: "And We have not sent you but as a mercy to the worlds".&lt;ref name="Brockopp2010" /&gt; Four compartments set around the central one often contain the names of the [[Rashidun|Rightly-Guided Caliphs]], [[Abu Bakr]], [[Umar]], [[Uthman]], and [[Ali]], each followed by "radhi Allahu anhu" ("may God be pleased with him").

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

===Calligraphic representations===
The most common visual representation of the Muhammad in Islamic art, especially in Arabic-speaking areas, is by a calligraphic representation of his name, a sort of [[monogram]] in roughly circular form, often given a decorated frame. Such inscriptions are normally in Arabic, and may rearrange or repeat forms, or add a blessing or honorific, or for example the word "messenger" or a contraction of it.  The range of ways of representing Muhammad's name is considerable, including [[ambigram]]s; he is also frequently symbolised by a rose.

The more elaborate versions relate to other Islamic traditions of special forms of calligraphy such as those writing the [[Names of God in Islam|names of God]], and the secular [[tughra]] or elaborate monogram of Ottoman rulers.

===Figurative visual depictions===
[[File:Medieval Persian manuscript Muhammad leads Abraham Moses Jesus.jpg|thumb|Muhammad leads [[Abraham]], [[Moses]], [[Jesus]] and others in prayer. Persian miniature]]
Throughout Islamic history, depictions of Muhammad in Islamic art were rare.&lt;ref name="Arnold" /&gt; Even so, there exists a "notable corpus of images of Muhammad produced, mostly in the form of manuscript illustrations, in various regions of the Islamic world from the thirteenth century through modern times".&lt;ref name="Gruber 2005, p. 240-241"&gt;Gruber (2005), p. 240-241&lt;/ref&gt; Depictions of Muhammad date back to the start of the tradition of [[Persian miniature]]s as illustrations in books. The illustrated book from the [[Persianate]] world (''Warka and Gulshah'', [[Topkapi Palace]] Library H. 841, attributed to [[Konya]] 1200–1250) contains the two earliest known Islamic depictions of Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;Grabar, p. 19; Gruber (2005), p. 235 (from where the date range), Blair, Sheila S., ''The Development of the Illustrated Book in Iran'', ''Muqarnas'', Vol. 10, Essays in Honor of Oleg Grabar (1993), p. 266, BRILL, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1523191 JSTOR] says "c. 1250"&lt;/ref&gt;

This book dates to before or just around the time of the [[Mongol invasion]] of [[Anatolia]] in the 1240s, and before the campaigns against Persia and Iraq of the 1250s, which destroyed great numbers of books in libraries. Recent scholarship has noted that, although surviving early examples are now uncommon, generally human figurative art was a continuous tradition in Islamic lands (such as in literature, science, and history); as early as the 8th century, such art flourished during the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] (c. 749 - 1258, across Spain, North Africa, Egypt, Syria, Turkey, Mesopotamia, and Persia).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=J. Bloom  |author2=S. Blair |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-530991-1|pages=192 and 207|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=un4WcfEASZwC&amp;pg=RA1-PA192&amp;lpg=RA1-PA192&amp;dq=cairo+egypt+miniature+paintings+mamluk#v=onepage&amp;q=cairo%20egypt%20miniature%20paintings%20mamluk&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christiane Gruber traces a development from "veristic" images showing the whole body and face, in the 13th to 15th centuries, to more "abstract" representations in the 16th to 19th centuries, the latter including the representation of Muhammad by a special type of [[calligraphic]] representation, with the older types also remaining in use.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (2005), 229, and throughout&lt;/ref&gt;  An intermediate type, first found from about 1400, is the "inscribed portrait" where the face of Muhammad is blank, with "Ya Muhammad" ("O Muhammad") or a similar phrase written in the space instead; these may be related to [[Sufi]] thought.  In some cases the inscription appears to have been an underpainting that would later be covered by a face or veil, so a pious act by the painter, for his eyes alone, but in others it was intended to be seen.&lt;ref name="Gruber 2005, p. 240-241"/&gt; According to Gruber, a good number of these paintings later underwent [[iconoclasm|iconoclastic]] mutilations, in which the facial features of Muhammad were scratched or smeared, as Muslim views on the acceptability of veristic images changed.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (2005), 229&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of extant Persian manuscripts representing Muhammad date from the [[Ilkhanid]] period under the new [[Mongol]] rulers, including a ''[[Marzubannama]]'' dating to 1299. The Ilkhanid [[MS Arab 161]] of 1307/8 contains 25 illustrations found in an illustrated version of [[Al-Biruni]]'s ''[[The Remaining Signs of Past Centuries]]'', of which five include depictions Muhammad, including the two concluding images, the largest and most accomplished in the manuscript, which emphasize the relation of Muhammad and [[`Ali]] according to [[Shi`ite]] doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (2010), pp.27-28&lt;/ref&gt; According to Christiane Gruber, other works use images to promote [[Sunni]] Islam, such as a set of Mi'raj illustrations (MS H 2154) in the early 14th century,&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (2010), quote p. 43; generally pp.29-45&lt;/ref&gt; although other historians have dated the same illustrations to the [[Jalayrid]] period of Shia rulers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Tauris Academic Studies| isbn = 1-84511-499-X| last = Gruber| first = Christiane| title = The Ilkhanid Book of Ascension| date = 2010-03-15| page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Siyer-i Nebi 158b.jpg|thumb|upright|Muhammad, shown with a veiled face and halo, at [[Mount Hira]] (16th-century Ottoman illustration of the [[Siyer-i Nebi]])]]
Depictions of Muhammad are also found in Persian manuscripts in the following [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] and [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] dynasties, and Turkish [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] art in the 14th to 17th centuries, and beyond. Perhaps the most elaborate cycle of illustrations of Muhammad's life is the copy, completed in 1595, of the 14th-century biography ''[[Siyer-i Nebi]]'' commissioned by the Ottoman sultan [[Murat III]] for his son, the future [[Mehmed III]], containing over 800 illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Hürriyet Vakfı Yayınları| last = Tanındı| first = Zeren| title = Siyer-i nebî: İslam tasvir sanatında Hz. Muhammedʹin hayatı| year = 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Probably the commonest narrative scene represented is the [[Mi'raj]]; according to Gruber, "There exist countless single-page paintings of the meʿrāj included in the beginnings of Persian and Turkish romances and epic stories produced from the beginning of the 15th century to the 20th century".&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (Iranica)&lt;/ref&gt;  These images were also used in celebrations of the anniversary of the Mi'raj on 27 [[Rajab]], when the accounts were recited aloud to male groups: "Didactic and engaging, oral stories of the ascension seem to have had the religious goal of inducing attitudes of praise among their audiences".  Such practices are most easily documented in the 18th and 19th centuries, but manuscripts from much earlier appear to have fulfilled the same function.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (2010), p.43&lt;/ref&gt;  Otherwise a large number of different scenes may be represented at times, from Muhammad's birth to the end of his life, and his existence in Paradise.&lt;ref&gt;The birth is rare, but appears in an early manuscript in Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Halo ====
In the earliest depictions Muhammad may be shown with or without a [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]], the earliest halos being round in the style of Christian art,&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, 95&lt;/ref&gt; but before long a flaming halo or [[aureole]] in the [[Buddhist]] or Chinese tradition becomes more common than the circular form found in the West, when a halo is used.  A halo or flame may surround only his head, but often his whole body, and in some images the body itself cannot be seen for the halo.  This "luminous" form of representation avoided the issues caused by "veristic" images, and could be taken to convey qualities of Muhammad's person described in texts.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber, 230, 236&lt;/ref&gt;  If the body is visible, the face may be covered with a veil (see gallery for examples of both types). This form of representation, which began at the start of the [[Safavid]] period in Persia,&lt;ref&gt;Brend, Barbara. ''Islamic Art'', p. 161, British Museum Press.&lt;/ref&gt; was done out of reverence and respect.&lt;ref name="Arnold"/&gt; Other [[prophets of Islam]], and Muhammad's wives and relations, may be treated in similar ways if they also appear.

[[Thomas Walker Arnold|T. W. Arnold]] (1864–1930), an early historian of Islamic art, stated that "Islam has never welcomed painting as a handmaid of religion as both Buddhism and Christianity have done. Mosques have never been decorated with religious pictures, nor has a pictorial art been employed for the instruction of the heathen or for the edification of the faithful."&lt;ref name="Arnold" /&gt; Comparing Islam to Christianity, he also writes: "Accordingly, there has never been any historical tradition in the religious painting of Islam – no artistic development in the representation of accepted types – no schools of painters of religious subjects; least of all has there been any guidance on the part of leaders of religious thought corresponding to that of ecclesiastical authorities in the Christian Church."&lt;ref name="Arnold" /&gt;

Images of Muhammad remain controversial to the present day, and are not considered acceptable in many countries in the Middle East.  For example, in 1963 an account by a Turkish author of a [[Hajj]] pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] was banned in [[Pakistan]] because it contained reproductions of miniatures showing Muhammad unveiled.&lt;ref&gt;Schimmel, Annemarie, ''Deciphering the signs of God: a phenomenological approach to Islam'', p.45, n. 86, SUNY Press, 1994, {{ISBN|0-7914-1982-7}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-1982-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary Iran===
[[File:760 - Jeune arabe.jpg|thumb|upright|A colourised version of the original photograph by [[Lehnert &amp; Landrock (disambiguation)|Lehnert &amp; Landrock]], which later became the base of an Iranian depiction of a young Muhammad.]]
Despite the ban on the representation of Muhammad, images of Muhammed are not uncommon in Iran. The Iranian Shi'ism seems more tolerant on this point than Sunnite orthodoxy.&lt;ref name="etudes"/&gt; In Iran, depictions have considerable acceptance to the present day, and may be found in the modern forms of the poster and [[postcard]].&lt;ref name="GruberHaugbolle2013"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (2010), p.253, illustrates a postcard bought in 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the late 1990s, experts in Islamic iconography discovered images, printed on paper in Iran, portraying Mohammed as a teenager wearing a turban.&lt;ref name="etudes"/&gt; There are several variants, all show the same juvenile face, identified by an inscription such as "Muhammad, the Messenger of God", or a more detailed legend referring to an episode in the life of Muhammad and the supposed origin of the image.&lt;ref name="etudes"/&gt; Some Iranian versions of these posters attributed the original depiction to a [[Bahira]], a Christian monk who met the young Muhammad in Syria. By crediting the image to a Christian and predating it to the time before Muhammad became a prophet, the manufacturers of the image exonerate themselves from any wrongdoing.&lt;ref name="iconic"/&gt;

The motif was taken from a photograph of a young Tunisian taken by the Germans [[Rudolf Franz Lehnert]] and [[Ernst Heinrich Landrock]] in 1905 or 1906, which had been printed in high editions on picture post cards till 1921.&lt;ref name="etudes"&gt;Pierre Centlivres, Micheline Centlivres-Demont: [http://etudesphotographiques.revues.org/index747.html Une étrange rencontre. La photographie orientaliste de Lehnert et Landrock et l'image iranienne du prophète Mahomet], ''Études photographiques'' Nr. 17, November 2005 (in French)&lt;/ref&gt; This depiction has been popular in Iran as a form of curiosity.&lt;ref name="iconic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iconicphotos.wordpress.com/2010/06/11/mohammed/ |title=Mohammed  {{!}} Iconic Photos |publisher=Iconicphotos.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Tehran]], a mural depicting the prophet – his face veiled – riding [[Buraq]] was installed at a public road intersection in 2008, the only mural of its kind in a Muslim-majority country.&lt;ref name="GruberHaugbolle2013"&gt;Christiane Gruber: [https://www.academia.edu/4061369/Images_of_the_Prophet_In_and_Out_of_Modernity_The_Curious_Case_of_a_2008_Mural_in_Tehran Images of the Prophet In and Out of Modernity: The Curious Case of a 2008 Mural in Tehran], in {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pLfEClsscNIC&amp;pg=PA25|title=Visual Culture in the Modern Middle East: Rhetoric of the Image|author1=Christiane Gruber|author2=Sune Haugbolle|date=17 July 2013|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-00894-7|pages=3–31}} See also [http://arthistorygradforum.tumblr.com/post/74830788716] and [https://www.google.com/maps/place/Motahhari+-+Modarres+Exit,+Tehran,+Iran/@35.724081,51.424456,3a,75y,90t/data=!3m5!1e2!3m3!1s89306537!2e1!3e10!4m2!3m1!1s0x3f8e015c2dbdb1c7:0x86a5a3f81513f9a2].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cinema===
{{main|List of films about Muhammad|Depictions of Muhammad in film}}
Very few films have been made about Muhammad.  The 1976 film ''The Message'', also known as ''[[Mohammad, Messenger of God]]'', focused on other persons and never directly showed Muhammad or most members of his family.  A devotional cartoon called ''[[Muhammad: The Last Prophet]]'' was released in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finemediagroup.com/user/finemedia/press.cfm|title=Fine Media Group|accessdate=2006-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Iranian film directed by Majid Majidi was released in 2015 named ''[[Muhammad (2015 film)|Muhammad]]''. It is the first part of the trilogy film series on Muhammad by Majid Majidi.

While [[Sunni]] Muslims have always explicitly prohibited the depiction of Muhammad on film,&lt;ref name=fatwa_important&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alessandra.

==Depiction by non-Muslims==
{{Commons category|Western depictions of Muhammad}}
Western representations of Muhammad were very rare until the explosion of images following the invention of the [[printing press]]; he is shown in a few medieval images, normally in an unflattering manner, often influenced by his brief mention in [[Dante|Dante's]] ''[[Divine Comedy]]''.  Muhammad sometimes figures in Western depictions of groups of influential people in world history. Such depictions tend to be favourable or neutral in intent; one example can be found at the [[United States Supreme Court building#Sculptural program|United States Supreme Court building]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]. Created in 1935, the frieze includes major historical lawgivers, and places Muhammad alongside [[Hammurabi]], [[Moses]], [[Confucius]], and others. In 1997, a controversy erupted surrounding the frieze, and tourist materials have since been edited to describe the depiction as "a well-intentioned attempt by the sculptor to honor Muhammad" that "bears no resemblance to Muhammad."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyrepublican.com/sup_crt_frieze.html|title=The Daily Republican: Supreme Court Frieze|accessdate=2006-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, a statue of Muhammad was removed from a courthouse in New York City after the ambassadors of [[Indonesia]], Pakistan, and [[Egypt]] requested its removal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourmailinglistprovider.com/pubarchive_show_message.php?montrealmuslimnews+7289|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130210055800/http://www.yourmailinglistprovider.com/pubarchive_show_message.php?montrealmuslimnews+7289|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-02-10|accessdate=2006-03-10|date=2006-02-12|title=Archive "Montreal News Network": Images of Muhammad, Gone for Good}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extremely rare representations of Muhammad in [[monumental sculpture]] are especially likely to be offensive to Muslims, as the statue is the classic form for idols, and a fear of any hint of idolatry is the basis of Islamic prohibitions. Islamic art has almost always avoided large sculptures of any subject, especially free-standing ones; only a few animals are known, mostly fountain-heads, like those in the Lion Court of the [[Alhambra]]; the [[Pisa Griffin]] is perhaps the largest.

In 1997, the [[Council on American–Islamic Relations]], a Muslim advocacy group in the United States, wrote to United States Supreme Court Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist]] requesting that the sculpted representation of [[Muhammad]] on the north frieze inside the Supreme Court building be removed or sanded down. The court rejected CAIR's request.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/other/how-the-%e2%80%9cban%e2%80%9d-on-images-of-muhammad-came-to-be/ar-AA8lQj0 MSN : "How the “Ban” on Images of Muhammad Came to Be" by Jackie Bischof]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526045614/http://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/other/how-the-%E2%80%9Cban%E2%80%9D-on-images-of-muhammad-came-to-be/ar-AA8lQj0 |date=May 26, 2015 }} January 19, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have also been numerous book illustrations showing Muhammad.

[[Dante]], in ''[[The Divine Comedy#Inferno|The Divine Comedy: Inferno]]'', placed Muhammad in Hell, with his entrails hanging out (Canto 28):

:No barrel, not even one where the hoops and staves go every which way, was ever split open like one frayed Sinner I saw, ripped from chin to where we fart&lt;!-- this is the actual quotation; do not remove--&gt; below.
:His guts hung between his legs and displayed His vital organs, including that wretched sack Which converts to shit&lt;!-- this is the actual quotation; do not remove --&gt; whatever gets conveyed down the gullet.
:As I stared at him he looked back And with his hands pulled his chest open, Saying, ''"See how I split open the crack in myself! See how twisted and broken Mohammed is! Before me walks [[Ali]], his face Cleft from chin to crown, grief–stricken."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Seth Zimmerman|title=The Inferno of Dante Alighieri |page=191 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r3hWDEjN7JcC&amp;pg=PA191#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |year=2003 |publisher=iUniverse |isbn=0-595-28090-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This scene was sometimes shown in illustrations of the ''[[The Divine Comedy|Divina Commedia]]'' before modern times. Muhammad is represented in a 15th-century [[fresco]] ''[[Last Judgement]]'' by [[Giovanni da Modena]] and drawing on Dante, in the [[Church of San Petronio]], [[Bologna, Italy]].&lt;ref name=fresco&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,11711,742914,00.html|title=Al-Qaida plot to blow up Bologna church fresco|date=2002-06-24|work=[[The Guardian]]|author=Philip Willan}}&lt;/ref&gt; and artwork by [[Salvador Dalí]], [[Auguste Rodin]], [[William Blake]], and [[Gustave Doré]].&lt;ref name=Chronicle&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2006/02/11/MNGRCH6UQK1.DTL|title=What's behind Muslim cartoon outrage|date=2006-02-11|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|author=Ayesha Akram}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies in the 21st century==
The start of the 21st century has been marked by controversies over depictions of Muhammad, not only for recent caricatures or cartoons, but also regarding the display of historical artwork.

[[File:Mohammeds Berufung, Hosemann 1847.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''Die Berufung Mohammeds durch den Engel Gabriel'' by [[Theodor Hosemann]], 1847, published by ''Spiegel'' in 1999]]
In a story on morals at the end of the millennium in December 1999, the German news magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' printed on the same page pictures of “moral apostles” Muhammad, [[Jesus]], [[Confucius]], and [[Immanuel Kant]]. In the subsequent weeks, the magazine received protests, petitions and threats against publishing the picture of Muhammad. The Turkish TV-station [[Show TV]] broadcast the telephone number of an editor who then received daily calls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-15613871.html Terror am Telefon], ''Spiegel'', February 7, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Nadeem Elyas, leader of the [[Central Council of Muslims in Germany]] said that the picture should not be printed again in order to avoid hurting the feelings of Muslims intentionally. Elyas recommended to whiten the face of Muhammad instead.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carolin Emcke]]: [http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-15613870.html Fanatiker sind leicht verführbar], Interview with Nadeem Elyas, February 7, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2001, the ''Spiegel'' with consideration of Islamic laws published a picture of Muhammed with a whitened face on its title page.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45774322.html, 6. Februar 2006 Betr.: Titel], ''Spiegel'', 6 February 6, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The same picture of Muhammad by Hosemann had been published by the magazine once before in 1998 in a special edition on Islam, but then without evoking similar protests.&lt;ref&gt;''Spiegel Special'' 1, 1998, page 76&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Italian police reported that they had disrupted a terrorist plot to destroy a church in [[Bologna]], which contains a 15th-century [[fresco]] depicting an image of Muhammad (see above).&lt;ref name=fresco/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE2D9163CF931A1575BC0A9649C8B63|title=Italy frees Fresco Suspects|date=2002-08-22|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of depictions of Muhammad being altered include a 1940 mural at the [[University of Utah]] having the name of Muhammad removed from beneath the painting in 2000 at the request of Muslim students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Muhammad depiction controversy lurks in U’s past|url=http://archive.dailyutahchronicle.com/2006/02/22/muhammad-depiction-controversy-lurks-in-us-past/|work=Daily Utah Chronicle|agency=University of Utah|date=22 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Danish newspaper ''[[Jyllands-Posten]]'' published a set of [[editorial cartoons]], many of which depicted Muhammad. In late 2005 and early 2006, Danish Muslim organizations ignited a [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|controversy]] through public protests and by spreading knowledge of the publication of the cartoons.&lt;ref name=Halicks/&gt; According to John Woods, Islamic history professor at the University of Chicago, it was not simply the depiction of Muhammad that was offensive, but the implication that Muhammad was somehow a supporter of terrorism.&lt;ref name=explaining/&gt; In Sweden, an online caricature competition was announced in support of ''Jyllands-Posten'', but Foreign Affairs Minister [[Laila Freivalds]] and the [[Swedish Security Service]] pressured the [[internet service provider]] to shut the page down. In 2006, when her involvement was revealed to the public, she had to resign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L21470789.htm |title=Swedish foreign minister resigns over cartoons |work=Reuters AlertNet |accessdate=2006-03-21 |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20060322184626/http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L21470789.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 22 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 February 2008 the Danish police arrested three men alleged to be involved in a plot to assassinate [[Kurt Westergaard]], one of the cartoonists.&lt;ref&gt;Staff.

[[File:South park muhammad.jpg|thumb|Muhammad appeared in the 2001 ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[Super Best Friends]]". The image was later removed from the 2006 episode "[[Cartoon Wars Part II|Cartoon Wars]]" and the 2010 episodes "[[200 (South Park)|200]]" and "[[201 (South Park)|201]]" due to controversies regarding Muhammad cartoons in European newspapers.]]
In 2006, the controversial American [[animated]] television comedy program ''[[South Park]]'', which had previously depicted Muhammad as a [[superhero]] character in the July 4, 2001 episode "[[Super Best Friends]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = Super Best Friends | episodelink = Super Best Friends | series = South Park | serieslink = South Park | airdate = 2001-07-04 | season = 5 | number = 68}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has depicted Muhammad in the opening sequence since that episode,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2006/04/15/south-parks-been-showing-muhammad-all-season/ |title=Ryan j Budke. "South Park's been showing Muhammad all season!" TVSquad.com; April 15, 2006 |publisher=Tvsquad.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; attempted to satirize the Danish newspaper incident. In the episode, "[[Cartoon Wars Part II]]", they intended to show Muhammad handing a salmon helmet to [[Peter Griffin]], a character from the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] animated series ''[[Family Guy]]''. However, [[Comedy Central]], who airs ''South Park'', rejected the scene, citing concerns of violent protests in the [[Islamic world]]. The creators of ''South Park'' reacted by instead satirizing Comedy Central's [[double standard]] for broadcast acceptability by including a segment of "Cartoon Wars Part II" in which [[President of the United States|American president]] [[George W. Bush]] and [[Jesus]] defecate on the [[flag of the United States]].

The [[Lars Vilks Muhammad drawings controversy]] began in July 2007 with a series of drawings by [[Sweden|Swedish]] artist [[Lars Vilks]] which depicted Muhammad as a [[roundabout dog]]. Several art galleries in Sweden declined to show the drawings, citing security concerns and fear of violence. The controversy gained international attention after the [[Örebro]]-based regional newspaper ''[[Nerikes Allehanda]]'' published one of the drawings on August 18 to illustrate an [[editorial]] on [[self-censorship]] and [[freedom of religion]].&lt;ref name=na&gt;{{cite news |first=Lars |last=Ströman |title=Rätten att förlöjliga en religion |url=http://www.na.se/artikel.asp?intId=1209627 |publisher=[[Nerikes Allehanda]] |language=Swedish |date=2007-08-18 |accessdate=2007-08-31 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070906190721/http://www.na.se/artikel.asp?intId=1209627 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-06}}&lt;br/&gt;English translation: {{cite news |first=Lars |last=Ströman |title=The right to ridicule a religion |url=http://www.na.se/artikel.asp?intId=1209676 |publisher=[[Nerikes Allehanda]] |date=2007-08-28 |accessdate=2007-08-31 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070830163657/http://www.na.se/artikel.asp?intId=1209676 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While several other leading Swedish newspapers had published the drawings already, this particular publication led to protests from [[Islam in Sweden|Muslims in Sweden]] as well as official condemnations from several foreign governments including [[Iran]],&lt;ref name=iran&gt;{{cite news |title=Iran protests over Swedish Muhammad cartoon |url=http://www.thelocal.se/8305/20070827/ |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=2007-08-27 |accessdate=2007-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829141345/http://www.thelocal.se/8305/20070827/ |archivedate=2007-08-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pakistan]],&lt;ref name=pakistan&gt;{{cite press release |title=PAKISTAN CONDEMNS THE PUBLICATION OF OFFENSIVE SKETCH IN SWEDEN |publisher=[[Pakistan Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] |date=2007-08-30 |url=http://www.mofa.gov.pk/Press_Releases/2007/Aug/PR_234_07.htm |accessdate=2007-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070904154021/http://www.mofa.gov.pk/Press_Releases/2007/Aug/PR_234_07.htm |archivedate=2007-09-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Afghanistan]],&lt;ref name=afghanistan&gt;{{cite news |first=Sayed |last=Salahuddin |title=Indignant Afghanistan slams Prophet Mohammad sketch |url=http://in.reuters.com/article/SouthAsiaNews/idINIndia-29281220070901 |publisher=Reuters |date=2007-09-01 |accessdate=2007-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Egypt]]&lt;ref name=egypt&gt;{{cite news |first=Gwladys |last=Fouché |title=Egypt wades into Swedish cartoons row |url=http://media.guardian.co.uk/presspublishing/story/0,,2161595,00.html |publisher=The Guardian |date=2007-09-03 |accessdate=2007-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jordan]],&lt;ref name=jordan&gt;{{cite news |title=Jordan condemns new Swedish Mohammed cartoon |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20070903/wl_mideast_afp/jordanswedenislam_070903124623 |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=2007-09-03 |accessdate=2007-09-09}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by the inter-governmental [[Organisation of the Islamic Conference]] (OIC).&lt;ref name=oic&gt;{{cite press release |title=The Secretary General strongly condemned the publishing of blasphemous caricatures of prophet Muhammad by Swedish artist |publisher=[[Organisation of the Islamic Conference]] |date=2007-08-30 |url=http://www.oic-oci.org/press/English/2007/08/caricatur.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012054243/http://oic-oci.org/press/English/2007/08/caricatur.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-10-12 |accessdate=2007-09-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy occurred about one and a half years after the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|''Jyllands-Posten'' Muhammad cartoons controversy]] in Denmark in early 2006.

Another controversy emerged in September 2007 when [[Bangladesh]]i cartoonist [[Arifur Rahman]] was detained on suspicion of showing disrespect to Muhammad.  The interim government confiscated copies of the [[Bengali language|Bengali]]-language ''[[Prothom Alo]]'' in which the drawings appeared. The cartoon consisted of a boy holding a cat conversing with an elderly man.  The man asks the boy his name, and he replies "Babu". The older man chides him for not mentioning the name of Muhammad before his name.

He then points to the cat and asks the boy what it is called, and the boy replies "Muhammad the cat". The cartoon caused a firestorm in Bangladesh, with militant [[Islamists]] demanding that Rahman be executed for [[blasphemy]]. A group of people [[book burning|torched copies of the paper]] and several Islamic groups protested, saying the drawings ridiculed Mohammad and his companions. They demanded "exemplary punishment" for the paper's editor and the cartoonist. Bangladesh does not have a [[blasphemy law]], although one had been demanded by the same extremist Islamic groups.

On November 2, 2010, the office of the French satirical weekly newspaper ''[[Charlie Hebdo]]'' at Paris was attacked with a firebomb and its website hacked, after it had announced plans to publish a special edition with Muhammad as its “chief editor”, and the title page with a cartoon of Muhammad had been pre-issued on social media.

In September 2012, the newspaper published a series of satirical cartoons of Muhammad, some of which feature nude caricatures of him. In January 2013, ''Charlie Hebdo'' announced that they would make a [[comic book]] on the life of Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Taylor|first1=Jerome|title=It's Charlie Hebdo's right to draw Muhammad, but they missed the opportunity to do something profound|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/its-charlie-hebdos-right-to-draw-muhammad-but-they-missed-the-opportunity-to-do-something-profound-8435693.html|accessdate=12 October 2014|work=[[The Independent]]|date=2 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2013, Al-Qaeda's branch in Yemen, commonly known as [[Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula]] (AQAP), released a hit list in an edition of their English-language magazine ''[[Inspire (magazine)|Inspire]]''.

===Wikipedia article===
In 2008, several Muslims protested against the inclusion of Muhammad's depictions in the [[English Wikipedia]]'s ''Muhammad'' article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,328966,00.html |title=Muslims Protest Wikipedia Images of Muhammad |publisher=[[Fox News]] |date=2008-02-06 |accessdate=2008-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NY"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/05/books/05wiki.html |title=Wikipedia Islam Entry Is Criticized |author=Noam Cohen |work=The New York Times|date=2008-02-05 |accessdate=2008-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Maome.jpg|thumb|left|The petition was opposed to a depiction of Muhammad prohibiting [[Nasīʾ]].]]
The petition opposed a reproduction of a 17th-century Ottoman copy of a 14th-century [[Ilkhanate]] manuscript image ([[MS Arabe 1489]]) depicting Muhammad as he prohibited [[Nasīʾ]].&lt;ref&gt;MS Arabe 1489.

===Metropolitan Museum of Art===
The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in January 2010 confirmed to the ''[[New York Post]]'' that it had quietly removed all historic paintings which contained depictions of Muhammad from public exhibition. The Museum quoted objections on the part of conservative Muslims which were "under review."  The museum's action was criticized as excessive [[political correctness]], as were other decisions taken close to the same time, including the renaming of the "Primitive Art Galleries" to the "Arts of Africa, Oceania and the Americas" and the projected "Islamic Galleries" to "Arab Lands, Turkey, Iran, Central Asia and Later South Asia".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/jihad_jitters_at_met_76yj3VNUy4hcRAnhOcPCHP 'Jihad' jitters at Met – Mohammed art gone] by Isabel Vincent, 10 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Everybody Draw Mohammed Day===
{{main|Everybody Draw Mohammed Day}}
Everybody Draw Mohammed Day was a protest against those who threatened violence against artists who drew representations of Muhammad. It began as a protest against the action of [[Comedy Central]] in forbidding the broadcast of the ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[201 (South Park)|201]]" in response to [[death threat]]s against some of those responsible for the segment. Observance of the day began with a drawing posted on the [[Internet]] on April 20, 2010, accompanied by text suggesting that "everybody" create a drawing representing Muhammad, on May 20, 2010, as a protest against efforts to limit [[freedom of speech]].

[[File:Medea rappresentation (2009) 07.JPG|thumb|''Deus ex machina'' in classical theatre: Euripides' ''[[Medea (play)|Medea]]'', performed in 2009 in Syracuse, Italy]]

'''''Deus ex machina''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈdeʊs ɛks ˈmaː.kʰɪ.naː|lang}}: {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|eɪ|.|ə|s|_|ɛ|k|s|_|ˈ|m|ɑː|k|iː|n|ə}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|iː|ə|s|_|ɛ|k|s|_|ˈ|m|æ|k|ᵻ|n|ə}};&lt;ref&gt;''[[Random House Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt; plural: ''dei ex machina''; English ‘god from the machine’) is a [[plot device]] whereby a seemingly unsolvable problem in a story is suddenly and abruptly resolved by an unexpected and seemingly unlikely occurrence, typically so much as to seem contrived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary | title=deus ex machina | dictionary=Merriam-Webster | accessdate=23 Apr 2018 | url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/deus%20ex%20machina}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.britannica.com/art/deus-ex-machina | title=Deus ex machina | website=Encyclopaedia Britannica | accessdate=23 Apr 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its function can be to resolve an otherwise irresolvable plot situation, to surprise the audience, to bring the tale to a [[happy ending]], or act as a comedic device.

==Origin of the expression==
''Deus ex machina'' is a Latin [[calque]] {{ety|gre|''ἀπὸ μηχανῆς θεός'' (apò mēkhanês theós)|god from the machine}}.&lt;ref&gt;One of the earliest occurrences of the phrase is in fragment 227 of [[Menander]]: ἀπὸ μηχανῆϛ θεὸς ἐπεφάνηϛ "You are by your epiphany a veritable god from the machine", as quoted in ''The Woman Possessed with a Divinity'', as translated in ''Menander: The Principal Fragments'' (1921) by [[:de:Francis Greenleaf Allinson|Francis Greenleaf Allinson]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was coined from the conventions of [[Greek tragedy]], where a machine is used to bring actors playing gods onto the stage. The machine could be either a crane (''[[mechane]]'') used to lower actors from above or a riser that brought actors up through a trapdoor. Preparation to pick up the actors was done behind the ''[[Skene (theatre)|skene]]''. The idea was introduced by [[Aeschylus]] and was used often to resolve the conflict and conclude the drama. Although the device is associated mostly with Greek tragedy, it also appeared in comedies.&lt;ref name="machine"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chondros |first1=Thomas G. |last2=Milidonis |first2=Kypros|last3=Vitzilaios |first3=George |last4=Vaitsis|first4=John |title="Deus-Ex-Machina" reconstruction in the Athens theater of Dionysus |journal=Mechanism and Machine Theory |date=September 2013 |volume=67 |pages=172–191 |doi=10.1016/j.mechmachtheory.2013.04.010}}&lt;!--|accessdate=15 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient examples===
[[Aeschylus]] used the device in his ''[[The Eumenides|Eumenides]]'', but it was with [[Euripides]] that it became an established stage machine. More than half of Euripides' extant [[tragedy|tragedies]] employ a ''deus ex machina'' in their resolution, and some critics claim that Euripides, not Aeschylus, invented it.&lt;ref&gt;Rehm (1992, 72) and Walton (1984, 51).&lt;/ref&gt; A frequently cited example is Euripides' ''[[Medea (play)|Medea]]'', in which the ''deus ex machina'', a dragon-drawn chariot sent by the sun god, is used to convey his granddaughter [[Medea]], who has just committed murder and [[infanticide]], away from her husband [[Jason]] to the safety and civilization of Athens. In ''[[Alcestis (play)|Alcestis]]'', the [[eponymous]] heroine agrees to give up her own life in order to spare the life of her husband, Admetus. At the end, [[Heracles]] shows up and seizes Alcestis from [[Thanatos|Death]], restoring her to life and to Admetus.

[[Aristophanes]]' play ''[[Thesmophoriazusae]]'' parodies Euripides' frequent use of the crane by making Euripides himself a character in the play and bringing him on stage by way of the ''mechane''.

The effect of the device on Greek audiences was a direct and immediate emotional response. Audiences would have a feeling of wonder and astonishment at the appearance of the gods, which would often add to the moral effect of the drama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cunningham |first1=Maurice P.|title=Medea ΑΠΟ ΜΗΧΑΝΗΣ|journal=Classical Philology |date=July 1954 |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=151–160 |jstor = 265931 |doi = 10.1086/363788 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=28 September 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern theatrical examples===
[[Shakespeare]] used the device in ''[[As You Like It]]'', ''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre]]'', ''[[Cymbeline]]''  and ''[[The Winter's Tale]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Rehm (1992, 70).&lt;/ref&gt; It was also used in John Gay's ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'' where the author uses a character to break the action and rewrite the ending as a reprieve of the hanging of MacHeath. Both in Shakespeare's and Gay's plays the ''deus ex machina'' happens with breaking the dramatic illusion often in the form of an episodic narrator exposing the play itself and laying bare the author. This is different from the use of the ''deus ex machina'' in the ancient examples with the ending coming from a participant in the action in the form of a god. It is natural for the gods to be considered participants and not outside sources because of their privileged position and power. It is these attributes that allow the Greek gods to believably wrap up and solve the series of events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dunn|first1=Francis M|title=Tragedy's End : Closure and Innovation in Euripidean Drama: Closure and Innovation in Euripidean Drama |date=1996 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the politically turbulent 17th and 18th&amp;nbsp;centuries, the ''deus ex machina'' was sometimes used to make a controversial thesis more palatable to the powers of the day. For example, in the final scene of [[Molière]]'s ''[[Tartuffe]]'' the heroes are saved from a terrible fate by an agent of the compassionate, all-seeing [[Louis XIV|king]] — the same king that held Molière's career and livelihood in his hands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novelguide.com/a/discover/dfs_18/dfs_18_00023.html "Tartuffe: Novel Guide"]. 2003. Retrieved 2&amp;nbsp;November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot device==
[[Aristotle]] was the first to use a Greek term equivalent to the Latin phrase ''deus ex machina'' as a term to describe the technique as a device to resolve the plot of tragedies.&lt;ref name=machine /&gt; It is generally deemed undesirable in writing and often implies a lack of creativity on the part of the author. The reasons for this are that it does not pay due regard to the story's internal logic (although it is sometimes deliberately used to do this) and is often so unlikely that it challenges [[suspension of disbelief]], allowing the author to conclude the story with an unlikely, though perhaps more palatable, ending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/lit_terms_D.html |title=Literary Terms and Definitions: D |author= Dr. L. Kip Wheeler |accessdate=2008-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples===
In H. G. Wells's ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'', the Martians, who have destroyed everything in their path and apparently triumphed over humanity, are killed by bacteria.&lt;ref name=Greenwood&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Westfahl |editor1-first=Gary |title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Themes, Works, and Wonders, Volume 1 |date=2005 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=0313329516 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=SQMQQyIaACYC&amp;pg=PA195 195] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the novel ''[[Lord of the Flies]]'', the rescue of the savage children by a passing navy officer (which author [[William Golding]] called a "gimmick") is viewed by some critics as a ''deus ex machina''. The abrupt ending conveys the terrible fate that would have afflicted the children (in particular Ralph) if the officer had not arrived at that moment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=William Golding's Lord of the Flies |editor-last=Bloom |editor-first=Harold |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j1ZJcFqQ7V8C&amp;pg=PA67&amp;lpg=PA67&amp;dq=Lord+of+the+Flies,+deus+ex+machina |pages=67–68 |chapter=Grief, grief, grief: ''Lord of the Flies'' |first=Lawrence S. |last=Friedman |publisher=Infobase Publishing |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J. R. R. Tolkien]] referred to the [[Eagle (Middle-earth)|Great Eagles]] that appear in several places in ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' as "a dangerous 'machine'."&lt;ref&gt;J. R. R. Tolkien, letter 210 as quoted [http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Eagles here]&lt;/ref&gt;. This was in a letter refusing permission to a film adapter to have the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] transported by eagles rather than traveling on foot. He felt that the eagles had already been overused as a plot device. For example, in ''[[The Hobbit]]'', the eagles save [[Bilbo Baggins]], [[Gandalf]], and the dwarves from the goblins and wargs, then help turn the tide of the [[Battle of the Five Armies]], and in ''[[The Return of the King]]'' they save [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] from certain death on Mount Doom. In the [[Harvard Lampoon]]'s parody [[Bored of the Rings]], the eagles are referred to as 'Deus ex Machina Airlines.'

''Deus ex machina'' was also used by [[Charles Dickens]] in ''[[Oliver Twist]]'', when in the very peak of climax, Rose Maylie turns out to be the long-lost sister of Agnes, and therefore Oliver's aunt; and she marries her long-time sweetheart Harry, allowing Oliver to live happily with his saviour, Mr. Brownlow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Glossary of Literary Terms |editor-last=Abrams |editor-first=MH |url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/glossary-of-literary-terms-m-h-abrams/1100175018?ean=9780495898023 |pages=44–45 |publisher=Harcourt Brace &amp; Company, USA |year=1993 |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The ''deus ex machina'' device has many criticisms attached to it, mainly referring to it as inartistic, too convenient, and overly simplistic. On the other hand, champions of the device say that it opens up ideological and artistic possibilities.&lt;ref name="ghosts"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Breton |first1=Rob |title=Ghosts in the Machina: Plotting in Chartist and Working-Class Fiction |journal=Victorian Studies |date=Summer 2005 |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=557–575 |doi=10.1353/vic.2006.0003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient criticism===
[[Antiphanes (comic poet)|Antiphanes]] was one of the device's earliest critics. Antiphanes believed that the use of the ''deus ex machina'' was a sign that the playwright was unable to properly manage the complications of his plot. 
{{quote|when they don't know what to say

and have completely given up on the play

just like a finger they lift the machine

and the spectators are satisfied.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Handley |first1=Miriam |title=Shaw's response to the deus ex machina: From the Quintessence of Ibsenism to ''Heartbreak House'' |publisher=Theatre: Ancient &amp; Modern, January 1999 Conference |accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another critical reference to the device can be found in [[Plato]]'s dialogue ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'', 425d, though it is made in the context of an argument unrelated to drama.

[[Aristotle]] criticized the device in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', where he argued that the resolution of a plot must arise internally, following from previous action of the play:&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 20)&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|In the characters too, exactly as in the structure of the incidents, [the poet] ought always to seek what is either necessary or probable, so that it is either necessary or probable that a person of such-and-such a sort say or do things of the same sort, and it is either necessary or probable that this [incident] happen after that one. It is obvious that the solutions of plots too should come about as a result of the plot itself, and not from a contrivance, as in the ''Medea'' and in the passage about sailing home in the ''[[Iliad]]''. A contrivance must be used for matters outside the drama — either previous events which are beyond human knowledge, or later ones that need to be foretold or announced. For we grant that the gods can see everything. There should be nothing improbable in the incidents; otherwise, it should be outside the tragedy, e.g., that in [[Sophocles]]' ''[[Oedipus Rex|Oedipus]]''. |''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' |(1454a33–1454b9) }}

Aristotle praised Euripides, however, for generally ending his plays with bad fortune, which he viewed as correct in tragedy, and somewhat excused the intervention of a deity by suggesting that "astonishment" should be sought in tragic drama:&lt;ref&gt;''Poetics'' 11.5, Penguin (1996, 45).&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Irrationalities should be referred to what people say: That is one solution, and also sometimes that it is not irrational, since it is probable that improbable things will happen.}}

Such a device was referred to by [[Horace]] in his ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'' (lines 191–2), where he instructs poets that they should never resort to a "god from the machine" to resolve their plots "unless a difficulty worthy of a god's unraveling should happen" [''nec deus intersit, nisi dignus uindice nodus inciderit; nec quarta loqui persona laboret''].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/learning/essay/237830?page=3 |title=Ars Poetica by Horace |date=21 September 2017 |website=Poetry Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern criticism===
Following Aristotle, Renaissance critics continued to view the ''deus ex machina'' as an inept plot device, although it continued to be employed by Renaissance dramatists.

Towards the end of the 19th century, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] criticized [[Euripides]] for making tragedy an optimistic [[genre]] via use of the device, and was highly skeptical of the "Greek cheerfulness", prompting what he viewed as the plays' "blissful delight in life".&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche (2003, 85).&lt;/ref&gt; The ''deus ex machina'' as Nietzsche saw it was symptomatic of [[Socrates|Socratic]] culture, which valued knowledge over [[Apollonian and Dionysian|Dionysiac]] music and ultimately caused the death of tragedy:&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche (2003, 84–86).&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote| But the new non-Dionysiac spirit is most clearly apparent in the ''endings'' of the new dramas. At the end of the old tragedies there was a sense of metaphysical conciliation without which it is impossible to imagine our taking delight in tragedy; perhaps the conciliatory tones from another world echo most purely in ''[[Oedipus at Colonus]]''. Now, once tragedy had lost the genius of music, tragedy in the strictest sense was dead: for where was that metaphysical consolation now to be found? Hence an earthly resolution for tragic dissonance was sought; the hero, having been adequately tormented by fate, won his well-earned reward in a stately marriage and tokens of divine honour. The hero had become a gladiator, granted freedom once he had been satisfactorily flayed and scarred. Metaphysical consolation had been ousted by the ''deus ex machina''.|Friedrich Nietzsche}}
Nietzsche argued that the ''deus ex machina'' creates a false sense of consolation that ought not to be sought in phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche (2003, 80).&lt;/ref&gt; His denigration of the plot device has prevailed in critical opinion.
 
In [[Arthur Woollgar Verrall]]'s publication ''Euripides the Rationalist'' (1895), he surveyed and recorded other late 19th century responses to the device. He recorded that some of the critical responses to the term referred to it as 'burlesque', 'coup de théâtre', and 'catastrophe'. Verrall notes that critics have a dismissive response to authors who deploy the device in their writings. He comes to the conclusion that critics feel that the ''deus ex machina'' is evidence of the author's attempt to ruin the whole of his work and prevent anyone from putting any importance on his work.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

However, other scholars have looked at Euripides' use of ''deus ex machina'' and described its use as an integral part of the plot designed for a specific purpose. Often Euripides' plays would begin with gods, so it is argued that it would be natural for the gods to finish the action. The conflict throughout Euripides' plays would be caused by the meddling of the gods and therefore would make sense to both the playwright and the audience of the time that the gods would resolve all conflict that they began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Abel |first1=D. Herbert |title=Euripides' Deus ex Machina: Fault or Excellence |journal=The Classical Journal |date=December 1954 |volume=50 |issue=3 |pages=127–130 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Half of Euripides' eighteen extant plays end with the use of ''deus ex machina'', therefore it was not simply a device to relieve the playwright of the embarrassment of a confusing plot ending. This device enabled him to bring about a natural and more dignified dramatic and tragic ending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Flickinger |first1=Roy Caston |title=The Greek Theatre and its Drama |date=1926 |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago, Illinois}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other champions of the device believe that it can be a spectacular agent of subversion. It can be used to undercut generic conventions and challenge cultural assumptions and the privileged role of tragedy as a literary/theatrical model.&lt;ref name=ghosts /&gt;

Some 20th-century revisionist criticism suggests that ''deus ex machina'' cannot be viewed in these simplified terms, and contends that the device allows mortals to "probe" their relationship with the divine.&lt;ref name="Rehm 1992, 71"&gt;Rehm (1992, 71).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rush Rehm]] in particular cites examples of Greek tragedy in which the ''deus ex machina'' complicates the lives and attitudes of characters confronted by the deity, while simultaneously bringing the drama home to its audience.&lt;ref name="Rehm 1992, 71" /&gt; Sometimes, the unlikeliness of the ''deus ex machina'' plot device is employed deliberately. For example, comic effect is created in a scene in ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian]]'' when Brian, who lives in [[Judea]] at the time of [[Christ]], is saved from a high fall by a passing [[ancient astronauts|alien space ship]].&lt;ref&gt;James Berardinelli, James.

'''Ellen M. Mitchell''' (1838–1920) was an American [[philosopher]], educator and education reformer. She was one of the first women to be appointed lecturer in a university,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lindermann|first=Kate|title=Ellen Mitchell|url=http://www.societyforthestudyofwomenphilosophers.org/Ellen_Mitchell.html|work=Women Philosophers|publisher=Kate Lindermann|accessdate=10 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to writing philosophy, literature and literary criticism.

==Biography==

Ellen M. Smith was born in the Village of [[Geddes, New York]] to Harriet H. Rowland and Edwin R. Smith, the eldest of their four children. She graduated from the Cortland Academy, Homer, N.Y. in 1860, with a major in Classics. Ellen, also, taught school in Syracuse.  During the Civil War her brother, Edwin R. Smith, Jr., served in New York's 149th Regiment. Edwin was killed in the Battle of Chancellorsville, May 3, 1863. He was initially reported severely wounded; the family tried to determine whether the Confederates had captured him and treated him in the Confederate field hospital at Ellwood Manor. However, Edwin was lost without a trace.  Ellen adopted the nom de plume "Ella Ellwood" in identification with Edwin, writing with the name Ellwood during the war. Following Edwin's death, Ellen resigned her teaching position in Syracuse and moved to Cairo, Illinois, where she lived with her uncle, Ward L. Smith and his wife, Anna.

During the war, Ellen moved to [[St. Louis|St. Louis, Missouri]]. She wrote for the Missouri Republican newspaper of St. Louis, continuing to use the nom de plume Ella Ellwood until the war's end.  She married St. Louis attorney and Union civil war veteran Joseph W. Mitchell in the Presbyterian Church of Alton, Illinois in 1867. While in St. Louis, she attended the Hegelian philosophy lectures which had been organized there by William T. Harris. She and Joseph also contributed to a literary and philosophical discussion group called "The Pen &amp; Pencil Club," often hosting the meetings in their home.  
 
Ellen and Joseph moved to [[Denver, Colorado]] in 1878, seeking effective treatment for Joseph's illness (possibly tuberculosis). However, Joseph died in February, 1879. Ellen remained in Denver, where she taught school and, then, lectured on philosophy and literature in the [[University of Denver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lindermann |first=Kate |title=Ellen Mitchell |url=http://www.women-philosophers.com/Ellen-Mitchell.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130725202858/http://www.women-philosophers.com/Ellen-Mitchell.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=25 July 2013 |work=Women Philosophers |publisher=Kate Lindermann |accessdate=24 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, she actively contributed to the Kant Club, and to the Fortnightly Club, of Denver.

Ellen M. Mitchell attended the first session, in July 1879, of the Concord Summer School of Philosophy, which was hosted in Concord, Mass. by Bronson Alcott on his property.  William T. Harris organized the school and its programs after leaving St. Louis, with the intention of unifying the Hegelian Idealism of the St. Louis Philosophical Society with the Transcendentalism of Concord.  At that first 1879 session, Ellen became acquainted with many women from across the country who were leading the struggle for women's suffrage, as well as the efforts to improve educational and social policy standards.  Among those she met while attending the 1879 Concord session was Julia Ward Howe who, later, became the president of the Association for the Advancement of Women.  The Concord School played an important role in helping to build networks of policy reformers; more than one half of those who attended were women.  Mrs. Mitchell participated in the annual Concord School of Philosophy every year, until its final session in 1888. She wrote, in 1880, a description of the lectures during the previous session, and she delivered a paper titled "Friendship in Aristotle's Ethics" during the Concord session of July, 1887.

Mitchell actively contributed to the Association for the Advancement of Women, regularly attending the annual congresses.  At the 12th Woman's Congress in 1884, held at Baltimore, she delivered a paper titled "A Study of Hegel."  By the A.A.W.'s 13th Congress, held at Des Moines, Iowa, she was Vice Pres. of the A.A.W. for Colorado.  At that same 13th  Annual Congress, Prof. Maria Mitchell, of New York, and Ellen M. Mitchell, of Chicago (Mrs. Francis Mitchell) also were serving the A.A.W. as V.P.'s for the states of New York and Illinois, respectively.  At the A.A.W.'s 18th Women's Congress, at Toronto in 1890, Mitchell delivered a paper titled, "The Dramas of Henrik Ibsen."  Continuing as V. P. of the A.A.W. for Colorado, she was "Chairman" of the A.A.W.'s Committee for Topics and Papers. For the A.A.W.'s 19th Woman's Congress in 1891, at Grand Rapids, Mich., she continued serving as V.P. for Colorado, as the Chair of the Topics &amp; Papers Committee, and she delivered a paper titled "The Real and the Ideal in Art."

Throughout her career, Mitchell advocated, and endeavored to realize, the noble aspiration for American philosophy which was advocated by Walt Whitman in his great poetic essay manifesto of 1871, "Democratic Vistas".  

After 1893, she permanently returned to Geddes (by then a part of Syracuse) to care for her parents. In Syracuse, she organized and led the Round-Table of Syracuse, a literary and philosophical community adult seminar group. The Round Table began in 1894 and continued for more than 20 years.  To assist the participants in their studies and discussions, Mitchell wrote and privately published a series of essays on Dante, Tennyson, and Goethe. The title for one of the essays, "The Way of the Soul" is adapted from Hegel's introduction to his Phenomenology of Spirit. In her introduction to the essay, she wrote:
     "The Round Table of Syracuse is composed of a number of women who meet, season after season, to study and discuss the great books of the world.  They believe with Lowell that the truths which literature interprets can be known only by study of the supreme literary masterpieces.  They seek to trace the influence of literature upon art and their reciprocal relation to the history and social movements of an epoch.
      A clear yet spiritual interpretation of the author's meaning is diligently sought at first without the aid of any commentary.  This plan stimulates the members to do their own thinking, to discover for themselves what the original work has to say that they can comprehend.  Later, the help of commentaries is welcomed, ideas are compared and sifted, and opinion separated from knowledge.
      One aim of the Round Table is rational conversation.  By question and answer, by informal discussion, by the living contact of mind with mind, thought is quickened and stimulated, and many a problem independently suggested and solved.
      The studies pursued during the season of 1901-1902 relate for the most part to the dominant ideas of the nineteenth century as expressed in literature, art, philosophy, and science.  Selections from the great prose writers were followed by a comparative study of Tennyson's 'In Memoriam' and Dante's 'Divine Comedy'.  To sum up the spiritual gain of this work is impossible.  The following essay simply seeks to trace 'The Way of the Soul' out of the 'shadow of night' into the 'daybreak.'   Syracuse, March 15, 1902."

Ellen M. Mitchell died in Syracuse, N.Y. May 14, 1920 at the age of 81, three months before the 19th amendment to the constitution was ratified, finally establishing universal suffrage.  She is interred beside her parents in the Myrtle Hill Cemetery of the Village of Geddes.

In her obituary, May 16, 1920, the Syracuse Herald newspaper commented:  "The Herald records with sincere regret the death of Mrs. Ellen M. Mitchell, for many years the gentle preceptor and oracle of the Syracuse Round Table.  The value of her services to the literary life of the city cannot easily be overestimated....Mrs. Mitchell's personality was singularly lovable, and it imparted a magnetic charm to her discourse and her teaching.  On its intellectual side the City of Syracuse is much the poorer by her death."

==Philosophy==
"A Study of Greek Philosophy", Mitchell's book length philosophical discussion, was published in 1891 by S.C.Griggs &amp; Co. The book contains 36 chapter essays, chronologically presenting the development of the classical Greek tradition in philosophy, extending from the pre-Socratics to the neo-Platonists.  Her book is the first book length philosophical analysis to have been written in America by a woman scholar.  It guides university students, philosophy specialists, educators, and adult scholars through a program of study of the ancient Greek tradition in philosophy.  The book is, also, the first book to preserve the legacy of ancient Greek philosophy in the New World.

In her introduction to her book, Mitchell wrote:

     "It may be interesting to my readers to know something of the genesis of this book.  Twelve years ago, in St. Louis, a little band of women used to assemble every week to study and discuss the problems of philosophy.  I led the circle as teacher and learner.  Beginning with the study of Greek thought, and applying myself diligently to the works of the great masters, and the commentaries to be found in English, German and French, I sought continually to make clear to others what became clear to myself.  At the end of two years, the circle in St. Louis was exchanged for one in Denver, but with unabated interest and enthusiasm on my part and that of my co-workers.  At their request, the verbal exposition became a written one, and finally developed into its present form.  Whatever merit it possesses is due in part to those who have helped me towards the light by their eager questions, their hesitation at the obscure, their quick appreciation of spiritual truth hidden beneath obscure phraseology, their loving fellowship and sympathy.  Above all other teachers I am indebted to Dr. William T. Harris. From him I first learned to seek philosophy in the history of philosophy, and to find it everywhere as the spiritual interpretation of the universe.  I have also received help and stimulus from the expositions and lectures of Prof. F. Louis Soldan, of St. Louis; Prof. D.J. Snider, of Chicago; Prof. Thomas Davidson, of New York; from the Concord School of Philosophy; and the Kant Club, of Denver."

Reviews of the book were offered by prominent scholars and thought leaders when it was published in 1891:
     * Dr. W.T. Harris, U.S. Commissioner of Education: "It shows on every page evidence of scholarship in the best lines, and of real insight into the questions discussed." 
     * S.H. Howison, Prof. of Philosophy, University of California, Berkeley: "I am deeply gratified to read in English, at last, a work on the great Greek thinkers that does not 'condescend' toward them as if they were infantile minds compared with moderns, but brings to convincing light the truly permanent value of their thinking."
     * Edmund Clarence Stedman: "This survey, with its analysis of the Greek schools, is the most clear and inclusive, as far as my knowledge extends, that has been made in our language within so compact a space. It is of genuine value."
     * Prof. Louis J. Block, Chicago: "Admirable in spirit and excellent in matter.  I do not know where a clearer and more useful history of Greek philosophy is to be found."
     * Frank Sanborn, in Springfield Republican: "There is probably no manual better than this for those who would begin the study of the Greek masters, and yet the book lacks the dryness of manuals and has an interest for all thoughtful readers."
     * Caroline K. Sherman, in Chicago Herald: "This is no superficial hand-book giving a hasty survey of Greek thought - no condensed, simplified form of a larger treatise. It is a careful study from original sources of the great thinkers of antiquity, and it is presented to willing students in a form that will tempt them to go likewise to the same original sources."
     * Science, New York: "This work is written in an earnest, serious spirit, and with an evident desire to present the truth as the writer understands it. It is impartial too as between the different schools of thinkers, none of them being slighted, and no decided preference shown for one over another except as their real importance demands it."
     * Vouga's Art Folio, New York: "The work is comprehensive, and the author has, in a clear compact manner, given a place to each school, following the sequences in a style likely to impress the readers most forcibly, while the explanations and deductions show a most thorough and careful study of a complex and sometimes confused subject." 
     * Review of Reviews, New York: "This little work is an interesting, valuable, and very comprehensive view of the whole course of Greek philosophic thought."
     * The Scotsman, Edinburgh: "The book is one from which the general readers can gather a clear idea of the drift of Greek thought, its subject-matter and development, which will serve as an excellent groundwork for further study." 
     * The Methodist Review, Volume 52 (1892):  "The value of philosophy is the basal assumption in the issue of the above volume. Because of its lofty range of inquiry, its thought discipline, and its search after the ultimate truth, it ranks among the chief studies that can occupy human attention.  Greek philosophy also, from its antecedent and fundamental relation to the later philosophic systems, is a perpetual body of instruction. Its maxims have an enduring charm for men; its theories, if dissented from, are wisely conceived; its leaders are among the great schoolmasters of the world.  In a circle of St. Louis women, where the study of Greek thought was undertaken under the lead of the present author, the book now considered had its origin.  From the rise of philosophy in Greece, under the Ionians, to its close following Neo-Platonism the historic review here sweeps.  The personality of many great leaders of Grecian thought-as Pythagoras, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, and Zeno-is set forth with clearness; and the differing systems which they gave to their age and the world are traced with sufficient outline for the full understanding of the whole range of Grecian inquiry in those great centuries of intellectual activity.  It is instructive in these days, when the materialistic is receiving its full share of notice at the expense of the ideal, to notice such a circle of learners as that which gave the present volume its origin; and in the published result of their philosophic pursuits a wider circle of readers should find enjoyment and edification." 
     * Julia Ward Howe, in Literary World, Boston: "Mrs. Mitchell's volume is evidently the work of one who loves philosophy for its own sake. No tiresome pedantry, no encyclopedic dryness is found in its pages, but an earnest desire to present the theme in a graphic and tangible form, which shall rather invite the reader to its further study than discourage him with a mass of difficulties not to be overcome. A wholesome, appreciative, intelligible book. The volume of some two hundred eighty pages represents wide reading and careful study. Its contents belong to that easy reading which does not come of easy writing, but of the endeavor on the part of the writer to make "the crooked straight and rough places plain," an endeavor which cannot in this field be too highly commended.  Mrs. Mitchell conveys much valuable information and suggestion in a small space, but does not fatigue the reader with overcrowding facts and statements.  Rev. W.R. Alger, highly reputed as a student and lover of philosophy, contributes a brief paper on the "Claim and Charm" of his favorite pursuit."

William R. Alger, in his introduction to the book wrote, in part:
      "The etymological force of the word philosophy is the love of wisdom. Seizing this, we grasp a descriptive phrase, not a definition; we take possession of the practical substance but miss the dialectic essence.  Wisdom is knowledge enriching experience with blessed fruits.  Wisdom is assimilative insight in fruition at its goal.  But, let us leave the surface of description, and enter the depth of definition.  What is philosophy?  It is that form of thinking wherein all the parts imply one another, and every part implies the whole.  It is that kind of knowledge which has its presuppositions in itself, and is, therefore, independent of all other knowledge, while all other knowledge is dependent upon it.  It is the self-seizure of the idea in reflective consciousness.  It is the science of self-activity.  It is the pure search after the First Principle, the finding of it, and the deduction thence of all else.  It takes for its province those elements and methods which are common to all the special sciences, and groups them in a sovereign unification.  Hence, with entire justice, it has generally been designated the science of sciences, queen of all the rest.  Strenuous efforts have recently been made in several elaborate lectures to show that ethical science does not depend either on religion or philosophy, but is every way competent to itself.  This is a shallow confusion of thought, and an unwarrantable use of language.  The case may be conclusively stated in a nutshell thus: Philosophy is the science of ultimate grounds.  Morality is the science of right and wrong in human conduct."

Ellen Mitchell focused her writings on the philosophy of history, philosophy of art, political ethics, [[transcendentalism]], and [[Phidias]] and [[Plato]]. While lecturing at the Denver University she was one of the first to introduce women to idealist thought,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogers|first=Dorothy G.|title=America's first women philosophers : transplanting Hegel, 1860 - 1925|year=2005|publisher=Continuum|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=978-0826474759|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the other being Marietta Kies.

In “The Philosophy of Pessimism” she was one of the philosophers who resisted philosophical systems that grew out of the skeptical tradition. They were not interested in determining what is not true, possible, or real.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogers|first=Dorothy G.|title=America's first women philosophers : transplanting Hegel, 1860 - 1925|year=2005|publisher=Continuum|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=978-0826474759|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She only believed in positive theories that relied on what God created, like nature rather than based on human reason and judgment, it was based on the God-given world. Mitchell was part of the idealist philosophers.

One of her larger successes was “A Study of Hegel.” This seventeen page article did not discuss Hegel’s theories in detail. It does discuss important issues for women; nature, art, and religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogers|first=Dorothy G.|title=America's first women philosophers : transplanting Hegel, 1860 - 1925|year=2005|publisher=Continuum|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=978-0826474759|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is a paragraph in the article that distorts Hegel’s thought by using her own thoughts;

:"We communicate with the outward world through the organs of sense; but the impressions received by this means are confused and unrelated, and do not of themselves constitute knowledge, until they have been referred to the unifying power of thought."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogers|first=Dorothy G.|title=America's first women philosophers : transplanting Hegel, 1860 - 1925|year=2005|publisher=Continuum|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=978-0826474759|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This conflicts with Hegel’s belief as the mind must not be said to stand apart from the world as Mitchell here implies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogers|first=Dorothy G.|title=America's first women philosophers : transplanting Hegel, 1860 - 1925|year=2005|publisher=Continuum|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=978-0826474759|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; This paragraph starts the same as Hegel's belief of communicating with the world through senses, but it changes to hers about how to gain the power of knowledge is through using these senses to your individual experiences in life. This shows that she did not always just state other philosopher beliefs, but also had her own philosophies. When it came to the person and society Mitchell said that someone being away from social order is impossible. She states that “social institutions play a critical role in individual self-determination",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogers|first=Dorothy G.|title=America's first women philosophers : transplanting Hegel, 1860 - 1925|year=2005|publisher=Continuum|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=978-0826474759|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;  meaning that in order to rise above, an individual must become a part of society to be able to rise above it.

In her book ''A study of Greek Philosophy'' she claims the object of knowledge in philosophy is the human spirit itself, and truth is a living process which develops and advances in the civilizing course of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Ellen M.|title=A Study of Greek Philosophy: -1891|year=1891|publisher=Cornell University Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the book it reveals that we gain self-knowledge as we gain more experiences in life that affects our knowledge and become who we are.

'''Eugeniu Voinescu''' (commonly '''Eugen'''; 26 May 1842, [[Iași]] &amp;ndash; 6 May 1909, [[Bucharest]]) was a Romanian diplomat and painter, who specialized in maritime scenes.

==Biography==
Following the wishes of his family, he originally studied law and literature. After spending some time studying in Athens, he went to Paris where he befriended the French artist, [[Gustave Courbet]], who stimulated his interest in painting directly from nature.&lt;ref name="A"&gt;[http://artindex.ro/2012/05/16/voinescu-eugen-cean/ Brief biography and paintings] @ ArtIndex.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1869, he was awarded a prize at the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]].

As a result of his legal studies, he also served as Romanian [[consul general]] in Budapest (1879), Istanbul (1882), and [[Odessa]] (1883-1888). While in Odessa, he became acquainted with [[Ivan Aivazovsky]], who helped him develop his interest in [[Marine art|marine painting]].&lt;ref name="A" /&gt; In 1889, he held his first major exhibition at a salon held in the new [[Romanian Athenaeum]].

Although he was lauded as Romania's best maritime artist by [[Nicolae Iorga]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ziarulevenimentul.ro/stiri-2/Casa%20si%20gradina/eugeniu-voinescu-pictor--376715.html Biographical notes] @ Evenimentul.&lt;/ref&gt; he also painted portraits and [[Genre art|genre]] works, as well as historical and biblical scenes. An important aspect of his career is that he was financially independent, so his painting always remained a hobby, even when he participated in decorating churches, such as the Cathedral of [[Saint Charalambos]] in [[Turnu Măgurele]] and the Church of Saint Nicholas in Bucharest. He was also one of the founders of the School of Decorative Arts at the [[Bucharest National University of Arts]].

In 2011, [[Poșta Română]] issued a series of four [[commemorative stamp]]s honoring Romanian artists, and one of Voinescu's paintings was chosen for the 2.10 [[Romanian Leu|Lei]] denomination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://romfilatelia.ro/marci/colectia.php?ContentID=547&amp;Year=2011 Commemorative issue] @ Romfilatelia.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1919">'''Fasting spittle'''&amp;nbsp;– [[saliva]] produced first thing in the morning, before breakfast&amp;nbsp;– has been used to treat a wide variety of diseases for many hundreds of years. Spittle cures are usually considered to be more effective if [[fasting]] spittle is used.{{sfnp|Roud|2006|loc=wart cures: fasting spittle|ps=none}}

An early recorded use of spittle as a cure comes from the [[Gospel of Mark|Gospel of St Mark]], believed to have been written in about 70&amp;nbsp;AD:
{{bq|text=And they bring unto him [Jesus] one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech&amp;nbsp;... And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue; and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened. {{bibleverse||Mark|7:32–5}}}}
Writing at about the same time as Mark, the Roman [[natural philosopher]] [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] commented in his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' that fasting spittle was efficacious in the treatment of [[ophthalmia]], and that the fasting spittle of a woman was particularly beneficial for treating bloodshot eyes.{{r|OpieTatem}}

The '''French Renaissance''' was the [[Cultural movement|cultural]] and [[Art movement|artistic movement]] in [[France]] between the 15th and early 17th centuries. The period is associated with the pan-European [[Renaissance]], a word first used by the French historian [[Jules Michelet]] to define the artistic and cultural "rebirth" of Europe.

Notable developments during the French Renaissance include the spread of [[humanism]], early [[Age of Discovery|exploration of the "New World"]] (as [[New France]] by [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] and [[Jacques Cartier]]); the development of new techniques and artistic forms in the fields of printing, [[French Renaissance architecture|architecture]], painting, sculpture, music, the [[science]]s and [[French Renaissance literature|literature]]; and the elaboration of new codes of sociability, etiquette and discourse.

The French Renaissance traditionally extends from (roughly) the [[Italian Wars|French invasion of Italy]] in 1494 during the reign of [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]] until the death of [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] in 1610. This chronology notwithstanding, certain artistic, technological or literary developments associated with the [[Renaissance]] arrived in France earlier (for example, by way of the [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] court or the [[Avignon Papacy|Papal court in Avignon]]); however, the [[Black Death]] of the 14th century and the [[Hundred Years' War]] kept France economically and politically weak until the late 15th century.

The reigns of [[Francis I of France]] (from 1515 to 1547) and his son [[Henry II of France|Henry II]] (from 1547 to 1559) are generally considered the apex of the French Renaissance.

==The word "Renaissance"==
The word "Renaissance" is a [[French language|French]] word, whose literal translation into English is "Rebirth". The word Renaissance was first used and defined&lt;ref name=murray&gt;Murray, P. and Murray, L. (1963) ''The Art of the Renaissance''. London: [[Thames &amp; Hudson]] (World of Art), p. 9. {{ISBN|978-0-500-20008-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; by French [[historian]] [[Jules Michelet]] (1798–1874), in his 1855 work, ''Histoire de France'' (History of France).&lt;ref&gt;Michelet, Jules. ''History of France'', trans. G. H. Smith (New York: D. Appleton, 1847)&lt;/ref&gt; Jules Michelet defined the 16th-century Renaissance in France as a period in Europe's cultural history that represented a break from the Middle Ages, creating a modern understanding of humanity and its place in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brotton|first=Jerry|title=The Renaissance Bazaar|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a French citizen and historian, Michelet also claimed the Renaissance as a French movement.&lt;ref name="brotton"&gt;Brotton, J., ''The Renaissance: A Very Short Introduction'', [[Oxford University Press|OUP]], 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-280163-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His work is at the origin of the use of the French word "Renaissance" in other languages.

==Art==
''For a chronological list of French Renaissance artists, see [[List of French artists#Renaissance|List of French Renaissance artists]].''

In the late 15th century, the French [[Italian Wars|invasion of Italy]] and the proximity of the vibrant [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] court (with its [[Flanders|Flemish]] connections) brought the French into contact with the goods, paintings, and the creative spirit of the [[Northern Renaissance|Northern]] and [[Italian Renaissance]], and the initial artistic changes in [[France]] were often carried out by Italian and Flemish artists, such as [[Jean Clouet]] and his son [[François Clouet]] and the Italians [[Rosso Fiorentino]], [[Francesco Primaticcio]] and [[Niccolò dell'Abbate]] of the first [[School of Fontainebleau]] (from 1531).

In 1516, [[Francis I of France]] invited [[Leonardo da Vinci]] to the [[Château d'Amboise]] and provided him with the [[Clos Lucé|Château du Clos Lucé]], then called Château de Cloux, as a place to stay and work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tanaka|1992|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leonardo, a famous painter and inventor, arrived with three of his paintings, namely the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'', ''[[The Virgin and Child with St Anne and St John the Baptist|Sainte Anne]]'', and ''[[St. John the Baptist (Leonardo)|Saint Jean Baptiste]]'', today owned by the [[Louvre museum]] of [[Paris]].

The art of the period from Francis I through Henry IV is often inspired by late Italian pictorial and sculptural developments commonly referred to as [[Mannerism]] (associated with [[Michelangelo]] and [[Parmigianino]], among others), characterized by figures which are elongated and graceful and a reliance on visual [[rhetoric]], including the elaborate use of [[allegory]] and [[mythology]].

There are a number of French artists of incredible talent in this period including the painter [[Jean Fouquet]] of Tours (who achieved amazingly realistic portraits and remarkable illuminated manuscripts) and the sculptors [[Jean Goujon]] and [[Germain Pilon]].

'''Late Mannerism and early Baroque.'''

Henry IV invited the artists [[Toussaint Dubreuil]], [[Martin Fréminet]] and [[Ambroise Dubois]] to work on the [[château Fontainebleau|château of Fontainebleau]] and they are typically called the second [[School of Fontainebleau]].

[[Marie de Medici]], Henry IV's queen, invited the [[Flemish people|Flemish]] painter [[Peter Paul Rubens]] to [[France]], and the artist painted a number of large-scale works for the queen's [[Luxembourg Palace]] in Paris.  Another Flemish artist working for the court was [[Frans Pourbus the younger]].

Outside France, working for the dukes of [[Duchy of Lorraine|Lorraine]], one finds a very different late mannerist style in the artists [[Jacques Bellange]], [[Claude Deruet]] and [[Jacques Callot]].  Having little contact with the French artists of the period, they developed a heightened,  extreme, and often erotic mannerism (including night scenes and nightmare images), and excellent skill in [[etching]].

==Architecture==
{{Main|French Renaissance architecture}}

One of the greatest accomplishments of the French Renaissance was the construction of the [[Châteaux of the Loire Valley]]: no longer conceived of as fortresses, these pleasure palaces took advantage of the richness of the rivers and lands of the [[Loire]] region and they show remarkable architectural skill.

The old [[Louvre]] castle in [[Paris]] was also rebuilt under the direction of [[Pierre Lescot]] and would become the core of a brand new Renaissance [[château]].  To the west of the Louvre, [[Catherine de Medici]] had built for her the [[Tuileries]] palace with extensive gardens and a [[grotte]].

The ascension of [[Henry IV of France]] to the throne brought a period of massive urban development in [[Paris, France|Paris]], including construction on the [[Pont Neuf]], the [[Place des Vosges]] (called the "Place Royale"), the [[Place Dauphine]], and parts of the [[Louvre]] (amongst which the Great Gallery).

==Garden==
{{Main|French Renaissance garden}}
French Renaissance gardens were characterized by symmetrical and geometric planting beds or [[parterre]]s; plants in pots; paths of gravel and sand; terraces; stairways and ramps; moving water in the form of canals, [[Waterfall|cascades]] and monumental fountains, and extensive use of artificial [[grotte]]s, [[labyrinth]]s and statues of mythological figures. They became an extension of the chateaux that they surrounded, and were designed to illustrate the Renaissance ideals of measure and proportion.

==Music==
{{Main|French Renaissance music|Burgundian School|Franco-Flemish School}}
[[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]], the mostly [[French language|French]]-speaking area unified with the [[Kingdom of France]] in 1477, was the musical center of [[Europe]] in the early and middle 15th century. Many of the most famous musicians in Europe either came from Burgundy, or went to study with composers there; in addition there was considerable interchange between the Burgundian court musical establishment and French courts and ecclesiastical organizations in the late 15th century.  The [[Burgundian school|Burgundian style]] gave birth to the [[Franco-Flemish School|Franco-Flemish style]] of [[polyphony]] which dominated European music in the late 15th and early 16th centuries.  However, by the end of the 15th century, a French national character was becoming distinct in music of the French royal and aristocratic courts, as well as the major centers of [[Christian music|church music]].  For the most part French composers of the time shunned the sombre colors of the Franco-Flemish style and strove for clarity of line and structure, and, in secular music such as the [[chanson]], lightness, singability, and popularity.  [[Guillaume Dufay]] and [[Gilles Binchois]] are two notable examples from the Burgundian school during the early Renaissance period.

The most renowned composer in Europe, [[Josquin des Prez]], worked for a time in the court of [[Louis XII of France|Louis XII]], and likely composed some of his most famous works there (his first setting of Psalm 129, ''[[Psalm 130|De profundis]]'', was probably written for the funeral of Louis XII in 1515).  Francis I, who became [[List of French monarchs|king]] that year, made the creation of an opulent musical establishment a priority.  His musicians went with him on his travels, and he competed with [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] at the [[Field of the Cloth of Gold]] in 1520 for the most magnificent musical entertainment; likely the event was directed by [[Jean Mouton]], one of the most famous [[motet]] composers of the early 16th century after Josquin.

By far the most significant contribution of France to music in the Renaissance period was the [[chanson]].  The chanson was a variety of secular song, of highly varied character, and which included some of the most overwhelmingly popular music of the 16th century:  indeed many chansons were sung all over Europe.  The chanson in the early 16th century was characterised by a [[dactyl (poetry)|dactyl]]ic opening (long, short-short) and [[counterpoint|contrapuntal]] style which was later adopted by the Italian [[canzona]], the predecessor of the [[sonata]].  Typically chansons were for three or four voices, without instrumental accompaniment, but the most popular examples were inevitably made into instrumental versions as well.  Famous composers of these "Parisian" chansons included [[Claudin de Sermisy]] and [[Clément Janequin]].  Janequin's ''La guerre'', written to celebrate the French victory at [[Battle of Marignano|Marignano]] in 1515, imitates the sounds of cannon, the cries of the wounded, and the trumpets signaling advance and retreat.  A later development of the chanson was the style of ''[[musique mesurée]]'', as exemplified in the work of [[Claude Le Jeune]]:  in this type of chanson, based on developments by the group of poets known as the [[Pléiade]] under [[Jean-Antoine de Baïf]], the musical rhythm exactly matched the stress accents of the verse, in an attempt to capture some of the rhetorical effect of music in Ancient Greece (a coincident, and apparently unrelated movement in Italy at the same time was known as the [[Florentine Camerata]]).  Towards the end of the 16th century the chanson was gradually replaced by the [[air de cour]], the most popular song type in France in the early 17th century.

The era of religious wars had a profound effect on music in France.  Influenced by [[Calvinism]], the Protestants produced a type of sacred music much different from the elaborate Latin motets written by their Catholic counterparts.  Both Protestants and Catholics (especially the Protestant sympathizers among them) produced a variation of the chanson known as the ''[[chanson spirituelle]]'', which was like the secular song but was fitted with a religious or moralizing text.  [[Claude Goudimel]], a Protestant composer most noted for his Calvinist-inspired psalm settings, was murdered in [[Lyon]] during the [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]].  However, not only Protestant composers were killed during the era of conflict; in 1581, Catholic [[Antoine de Bertrand]], a prolific composer of chansons, was murdered in [[Toulouse]] by a Protestant mob.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4927">The '''Grand Central School of Art''' was an [[United States|American]] [[art school]] in [[New York City]],&lt;ref name="nytopen"&gt;{{cite web | title=400 Enroll in 6 Weeks; Grand Central School of Art Announces List of Instructors. | website=[[The New York Times]] | date=November 23, 1924 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1924/11/23/archives/400-enroll-in-6-weeks-grand-central-school-of-art-announces-list-of.html | access-date=November 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded in 1923 by the painters [[Edmund Greacen]], [[Walter Leighton Clark]] and [[John Singer Sargent]]. The school was established and run by the [[Grand Central Art Galleries]], an artists' cooperative founded by Sargent, Greacen, Clark, and others in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Painters and Sculptors' Gallery Association to Begin Work. | website=[[The New York Times]] | date=December 19, 1922 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1922/12/19/archives/will-foster-art-sales-painters-and-sculptors-gallery-association-to.html | access-date=November 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school was directed by Greacen, Sargent and [[Daniel Chester French]] and occupied {{convert|7000|sqft|m2}} on the seventh floor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Terminal Fire Not in Art School. | website=[[The New York Times]] | date=September 6, 1929 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1929/09/06/archives/terminal-fire-not-in-art-school.html | access-date=November 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the east wing of the [[Grand Central Terminal]] in [[New York City]]. Press accounts of the school's opening reception mentioned the following instructors:  Greacen, George Pearse Ennis, sculptor [[Chester Beach]], muralists [[Ezra Winter]] and [[Dean Cornwell]], the illustrator and costume designer [[Helen Dryden]], [[Nicolai Fechin]], Julian Bowes and George Elmer Browne.&lt;ref name="nytopen2"&gt;{{cite web | title=New Art School Opens: Reception Held in Studios Over the Grand Central | website=[[The New York Times]] | date=October 2, 1924 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1924/10/02/archives/gains-in-business-send-stocks-up-steel-and-car-orders-and-freight.html | access-date=November 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school had more than 400 students its first year and soon grew to 900, making it one of the largest art schools in the city. Greacen engaged [[Arshile Gorky]] as an instructor, probably the school's most prominent teacher.  Another instructor was [[Harvey Dunn]], whose comments were captured by a student during one five-hour class session and were published in 1934 in a slim volume titled ''An Evening in the Classroom''. For some years the school held a summer session in Eastport, Maine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Art Activities Here, at Home, and Out of Town; In Massachusetts. In Connecticut. In Vermont.

The Carnegie International. | website=[[The New York Times]] | date=September 16, 1928 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1928/09/16/archives/art-activities-here-at-home-and-out-of-town-in-massachusetts-in.html | access-date=November 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After nearly 20 years of operation, the school closed in 1944.

The school has no relationship to the current Grand Central Academy of Art, despite the similarities in name and a shared humanist perspective. The academy, also in New York City, was established by the Institute of Classical Architecture and Classical America (ICA&amp;CA), founded as two separate nonprofit organizations in 1991 and 1968.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.classicist.org/about-us/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Junk Jet''''' is a non-commercial publication platform, a collaborative format set up to discuss speculative works on topics of art, architecture and [[electronic media]]. It is published by independent igmade.edition, edited and designed by Mona Mahall and Asli Serbest (m-a-u-s-e-r).

== History ==
Self-published Magazine ''Junk Jet'' is founded in 2007 by Mona Mahall and Asli Serbest. It tries to introduce "[[noise]] to signal".

== Issues ==
[[File:Junk Jet n°1 and n°2.jpg|thumb|Junk Jet Magazine, Issues 1 and 2]]
'''Junk Jet n°1'''
noise-and-failure-issue&lt;br /&gt;
The editors write in the first issue:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
JJ wants to capture and transfer junk’s ambiguities indicating non- function, or at least bad-function implied in the nature of technology, and various forms of mis-use for aesthetic purposes. What could be the aesthetic (non-) function of junk within clean computational aesthetics of electronic media?
Therefore, relevant fields are all sorts of re-use, of wrong- and non-use, and of tinkering (bricoler, basteln) of forms and found objects, of theories and (small) narratives, of fashions and styles, and of course of computers and other electronic devices.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Release Date: November 2007&lt;br /&gt;
ISBN: NO-ISBN&lt;br /&gt;
Number of pages: 69 &lt;br /&gt;
Measurements: 25 x 20 x 0.5&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;br /&gt;

'''Junk Jet n°2'''
the-speculative-issue&lt;br /&gt;
The editors write in the second issue:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
For the second issue, Junk Jet was looking for the Speculative, focussing on works of unpredictable architectures and volatile spaces within real and virtual environments.
The speculative haunts all systems of production, threatens them with the destruction of their order and with collapse. It continues to appear to all orthodoxies as artifice, as a black magic, which is to be unveiled, because it is somehow effective in an illusive, but absorbing way, which is characteristic to an occasion for a game and its stakes. It is not a rational process, but something that contradicts this frame, something that is recognized as irrational, as feverish, and that therefore is suspected to be dysfunctional, inhuman, or even monstrous.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Release Date: November 2008&lt;br /&gt;
ISBN: NO-ISBN&lt;br /&gt;
Number of pages: 100 &lt;br /&gt;
Measurements: 24 x 16.5 x 0.7&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;br /&gt;

[[File:junkjet3.jpg|thumb|Cover of Junk Jet n°3]]
'''Junk Jet n°3'''
flux-us-flux-you-issue&lt;br /&gt;
The editors write in the third issue:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Junk Jet n°3 asked for fluxing architectures, boogie, buildings, rolling rocks, flying architectures, provisory pyramids, and temporary eternities; for all kinds of practical concepts and conceptual practices, for stable happenings and unstable thoughts, for lifted cellars and dugin landmarks, for curtains, mobiles, house boats, bubbles, zeppelins, flying saucers ...
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Release Date: February 2010&lt;br /&gt;
{{ISBN|978-3-00-030127-8}}&lt;br /&gt;
Number of pages: 120 &lt;br /&gt;
Measurements: 18 x 13 x 1&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;br /&gt;
{{Clear}}
[[File:Junk Jet 4 from 2010.jpg|thumb|Cover of Junk Jet n°4]]
'''Junk Jet n°4'''
statistics-of-mystics-issue&lt;br /&gt;
The fourth issue is about:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
works and theories that make 1 become 2, 2 become 3, 3 …, works that make something out of nothing or nothing out of something, that discover new – even if microscaled – galaxies, that believe in alchemy and maintain a certain kind of apocalyptic thought; works that move from mumbo-jumbo to real magic and back.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Release Date: October 2010&lt;br /&gt;
{{ISBN|978-3-00-032228-0}}&lt;br /&gt;
Number of pages: 88 &lt;br /&gt;
Measurements: 27 x 19 x 1&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;br /&gt;

[[File:Junk Jet n°5 in Bookshop.JPG|thumb|Junk Jet Magazine, Issue 5]]
'''Junk Jet n°5'''
The net.heart-issue, released in 2012, transfers internet things from their digital space into printed media. It reflects the current internet culture with contributions by young internet artist and thinkers. It is an archive impossible with reflecting net.heart of internet culture. It collects objects, internet blogs, and animations from internet and turns them into a magazine. Editors Mona Mahall and Asli Serbest are inspired by the process of collecting objects and documenting archival material.

[[File:Junk Jet n°6 Page 16-17.jpg|thumb|Junk Jet Magazine, Issue 6, inside, images by Clement Valla]]
'''Junk Jet n°6'''
Here and Where Issue, n°6 is about the local in the global culture. It takes the attitude that the global is just the local on world tour. The local is not preserving identity – be that cultural, political, or social – but it is (re)inventing itself as art, activism and enterprise. The local aims at becoming a global subject, without knowing what forces (swarm, viral, etc.) this depends on. There is a downloadable hidden track in the magazine.

'''LUMA Foundation''' is a [[nonprofit organization]] established in 2004 that is based out of [[Zurich]] Switzerland. It supports the activities of independent [[contemporary art]]ists and other pioneers working in the fields of art, [[photography]], publishing, documentary, and [[multimedia]]. 

==History==
Established by [[Maja Hoffmann]], the foundation promotes artistic projects combining a particular interest in [[Natural environment|environment]]al issues, [[human rights]], education,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bard.edu/ccs/exhibitions/luma-foundation-arles-summer-2011/] LUMA FOUNDATION&lt;/ref&gt; and culture in the broadest sense.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dutch-doc.nl/docupedia/luma+foundation] LUMA Foundation information&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==
In 2011, the LUMA Foundation launched an acquisition program of books and films for its future library and hosted a symposium in [[Arles]] entitled The Human Snapshot, which brought together a number of leading thinkers to discuss the [[photographic]] image and its impact on [[human rights]].

The LUMA Foundation's focus is to create an experimental cultural complex, the Parc des Ateliers in [[Arles, France]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-flux.com/announcements/summer-program/] The LUMA Foundation in Arles 2013&lt;/ref&gt; dedicated to the production of exhibitions and ideas and developed with architect [[Frank Gehry]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/culture/article/2013/07/01/face-a-la-fondation-luma-les-rencontres-se-cherchent-un-espace-perenne_3439295_3246.html] Face à la Fondation Luma, les Rencontres se cherchent un espace pérenne&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://provenceventouxblog.com/2013/frank-gehry-in-arles-watershed-moment-arrives-for-ultra-modish-tower-final-presentation-made-by-maja-hoffmann-of-luma-foundation/] Frank Gehry in Arles: Watershed Moment Arrives for Ultra Modish Tower; Final Presentation Made by Maja Hoffmann of Luma Foundation&lt;/ref&gt; This project envisions an [[interdisciplinary]] center for the production of art exhibitions, research, education and archives. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://luma-arles.org/solaris-chronicles/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416180749/http://luma-arles.org/solaris-chronicles/ |archivedate=2014-04-16 |df= }} Solaris Chronicles&lt;/ref&gt;

POOL is an innovative program that combines the collaboration of an international group of [[private collection|private collectors]] with a mentor-based training programme for [[art curator]]s. The programme has been conceived by [[Beatrix Ruf]], (Director and Curator, [[Kunsthalle]] [[Zürich]] 2001-2014) in collaboration with the founding collectors [[Maja Hoffmann]] and [[Michael Ringier]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artprivee.org/directory/europe/switzerland/zurich/westbau-the-luma-foundation/] Private Museum Description&lt;/ref&gt;

==LUMA Arles==
LUMA [[Arles]], which launched formally in 2013, is dedicated to providing artists with opportunities to experiment in the production of new work through interdisciplinary collaboration. The conceptualisation of its mission, and the initial programming, has been spearheaded by [[Maja Hoffmann]]. LUMA Arles is an institution dedicated to providing artists with opportunities to experiment in the production and presentation of new work in close collaboration with other [[artists]], [[curators]], [[scientists]], [[innovators]] and [[audiences]]. The centrepiece of the 20-acre LUMA Arles campus is a new Arts Resource Centre building designed by [[Frank Gehry]] to house research and reference facilities, workshop and seminar rooms, and artist studios and presentation spaces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loeildelaphotographie.com/2014/04/08/events/24624/arles-a-historic-weekend] Arles, A Historic Weekend France by Jean-Jacques Naudet&lt;/ref&gt; LUMA Arles also encompasses six historic, large-scale industrial buildings. One historic building, the Grande Halle, was renovated in 2007 by the initiative of the [[Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur]] region.  

LUMA Arles works in collaboration with Actes Sud, a major French publishing house known for its work in the arts, humanities, and for children, and the École Nationale Supérieure de la Photographie, the first post-graduate program to specialise in photography in [[France]]. Every summer, LUMA Arles hosts installations and programs for the international photography festival, [[Rencontres d’Arles]].

==Collaborators==
The Foundation engages in long-term collaborations with institutions like the [[New Museum of Contemporary Art]] (New York), CCS [[Bard College]] (Annandale-on-Hudson, New York), [[Serpentine Gallery]] and [[Tate Modern]] (London), the [[Kunsthalle Zürich]] and the [[Fotomuseum Winterthur]] (Switzerland). LUMA is a partner of Les Rencontres d’Arles Photographie Awards in [[Arles]].

The [[Muisca people|Muisca]], inhabiting the central highlands of the [[Colombia]]n [[Andes]] ([[Altiplano Cundiboyacense]] and the southwestern part of that the [[Bogotá savanna]]), were one of the four great civilizations of the [[Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;Ocampo López, 2007, Ch.V. p.226&lt;/ref&gt; Other than the three civilizations in present-day [[Mexico]] and [[Peru]]; the [[Aztec civilization|Aztec]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]] and [[Inca Empire|Incas]] respectively, they did not construct grand [[Pre-Columbian architecture|architecture]] of solid materials. While specialising in [[Muisca agriculture|agriculture]] and [[Muisca art|gold-working, cloths and ceramics]], their architecture was rather modest and made of non-permanent materials as wood and clay.

Evidence for the Muisca architecture relies on archaeological excavations performed since the mid 20th century. In recent years larger areas showing evidence of the Early Muisca architecture have been uncovered, the biggest of them in [[Soacha]], [[Cundinamarca Department|Cundinamarca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://www.semana.com/nacion/articulo/descubrimiento-arqueologico-mas-grande-de-colombia/367219-3 El descubrimiento arqueológico más grande de Colombia] - [[Semana (Colombia)|Semana]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://www.elespectador.com/noticias/bogota/aldea-premuisca-enreda-transmision-de-luz-bogota-articulo-432960 Aldea premuisca enreda transmisión de luz a Bogotá] - [[El Espectador]]&lt;/ref&gt; All of the original houses and temples have been destroyed by the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] conquerors and replaced with [[colonial architecture]]. Reconstructions of some houses (''bohíos'') and the most important temple in the [[Muisca religion]]; the [[Sun Temple (Sogamoso)|Temple of the Sun]] in [[Sogamoso]], called Sugamuxi by the Muisca, have been built in the second half of the 20th century.

Important [[List of Muisca scholars|scholars]] who have contributed to the knowledge about the Muisca architecture are [[Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada]], who made the first contact with the Muisca, early 17th century [[friar]]s [[Pedro Simón]] and [[Juan de Castellanos]] later bishop [[Lucas Fernández de Piedrahita]] and modern [[archaeologist]]s [[Eliécer Silva Celis]], [[Sylvia M. Broadbent|Sylvia Broadbent]], [[Carl Henrik Langebaek]] and others.

== Background ==
The Altiplano Cundiboyacense, the high plateau in the Colombian Andes, has been inhabited for at least 12,400 years, with the earliest evidence in [[El Abra]], [[Tibitó]] and [[Tequendama]]. During this era, the [[paleoclimate]] and [[flora]] and [[fauna]] were different from today. It was the end of the [[Pleistocene]], when [[stadial]]s and [[interstadial]]s intercalated and the [[glacier]]s in the [[Cordillera Oriental (Colombia)|Eastern Ranges]] were advancing and retreating. When the first [[hunter-gatherer]]s arrived from the north (the [[Caribbean]] coast and earlier from [[Central America]]), they encountered still the [[Pleistocene megafauna]] on the highlands; ''[[Cuvieronius]]'', ''[[Stegomastodon]]'', ''[[Haplomastodon]]'' and ''[[Equus andium]]'' in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Correal Urrego, 1990, p.12&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time and age, as is evidenced in [[archaeology|archaeological]] excavations at various sites on the Altiplano, the people lived in caves and rock shelters. The [[Muisca Confederation#Prehistory|prehistorical]] period was followed by the [[Herrera Period]], commonly dated at 800 BCE to 800 CE. It was in this era that the agricultural advancement, that started in the latest [[Andean preceramic|preceramic]] times, caused a change towards population of the plains, away from the caves and rock shelters.&lt;ref&gt;Correal Urrego, 1990, p.13&lt;/ref&gt; This also led to an increase in population which was modest in the early Herrera Period and more pronounced towards the end of it; the start of the Muisca Period at around 800 CE. Further population growth and a more stratified society is observed in archaeological analysis of the Late Muisca Period, from 1200 CE onwards. The first contact with the Muisca happened in 1537 by the troops of [[conquistador]] and explorer [[Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada]] and his brother [[Hernán Pérez de Quesada|Hernán]].

== Muisca architecture ==
=== Houses and settlements ===
The houses of the Muisca, called ''bohíos'' or ''malokas'', were circular structures made of poles of wood and walls of clay, with a conical reed roof. A long beam of wood supported the roof in the centre of the round structure and was attached to the wooden poles. The interior of the roof was decorated with cloths with thin strokes of different colours. On the floor fine straw was placed.&lt;ref&gt;Ocampo López, 2007, Ch.V, p.203&lt;/ref&gt; Some ''bohíos'', probably those of the ''[[cacique]]s'' had [[ceramic]] floors, as evidenced by findings in [[Mosquera, Cundinamarca|Mosquera]]. This was atypical for the Muisca houses.&lt;ref&gt;Cardale de Schrimpff, 1985, p.116&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Spanish chroniclers have reported "great populations" of the Muisca territories,&lt;ref&gt;Efraín Sánchez, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; the people lived in small settlements, described by the Spanish conquerors as "dispersed homesteads". As the Maya people, the Muisca related the smaller settlements with their effective [[Muisca agriculture|agriculture]].&lt;ref&gt;Francis, 1993, p.38&lt;/ref&gt; Houses on the Bogotá savanna were built on slightly elevated areas to prevent them from floodings of the various rivers, humedales and swamps, characteristic of the area.&lt;ref&gt;Broadbent, 1974, p.120&lt;/ref&gt;
Each community had their own farmlands and hunting grounds surrounding their houses. The houses were constructed around a central square with the house of the ''cacique'' in the centre. Two or more "gates" in the ''cercado'' (enclosure) gave access to the village.&lt;ref&gt;Langebaek, 1995a, p.8&lt;/ref&gt;
The exact number of houses in the villages remains unclear and requires more archaeological work. De Quesada described villages of 10 up to 100 houses. 
The Late Muisca Period, commonly defined as 1200-1537, is characterised by denser population and larger communities, especially in [[Suba (Bogotá)|Suba]] and [[Cota, Cundinamarca|Cota]] with more dispersed housing in the vicinity.&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez Gallo, 2010, p.32&lt;/ref&gt;

Excavations in the [[Kennedy (Bogotá)|Las Delicias]] neighbourhood of Bogotá, on an alluvial terrace of the [[Tunjuelito River]] in 1990, exposed six circular structures of {{convert|4.6|m|ft}} in diameter, which is slightly smaller than living spaces found in other areas, e.g. in [[Facatativá]] ({{convert|5|m|ft}}).&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez Gallo, 2010, p.46&lt;/ref&gt; The occupation of these houses has been dated from the start of the Muisca Period until the colonial period. The living space was occupied in two stages, starting from 950 BCE, followed by a next phase dated at 750 BCE. The [[carbon dating|dating has been done based on carbon]], taken from the floors of the area. Ceramics, animal bones, swindles, seeds and jewellery has been found in this location too.&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez Gallo, 2010, p.40&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeologist [[Eliécer Silva Celis|Silva Celis]] uncovered in 1943 housing structures in Soacha with four different temporal levels with indications of population in the form of ash deposits from fires and animal bones.&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez Gallo, 2010, p.36&lt;/ref&gt;

Various scholars agree that the housing of the Muisca was egalitarian; little differentiation between the living spaces of the ''caciques'' and the lower-class people has been found, especially in Soacha.&lt;ref name=Kruschek_p180&gt;Kruschek, 2003, p.180&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Henderson_p149&gt;Henderson &amp; Ostler, 2005, p.149&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been described -by [[Pedro Simón]] among others- that at the entrance posts of the houses of the ''caciques'' [[Muisca religion#Human sacrifices|human sacrifice remains]] were hanging and the posts smeared with blood from the victims, who were regarded as sacred when they were young boys (''moxas'') or captured from neighbouring indigenous groups. Archaeological evidence from Mosquera supported this thesis.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson &amp; Ostler, 2005, p.157&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Roads ===
The roads of the Muisca people were unpaved, which makes it hard to identify them in archaeological excavations. Some of the roads were trade routes, with the eastern neighbours ([[Orinoquía Region|Llanos Orientales]]), in the north with the [[Guane people]] and in the west with the Panche and Muzo, others were sacred routes. Examples of holy roads, used for pilgrimages, were found in [[Guasca]] and [[Siecha Lakes|Siecha]]. Routes communicating Muisca territories with [[cotton]] producing areas ran through [[Somondoco]] and [[Súnuba]]. The roads crossing the mountains surrounding the Altiplano were narrow, making it more difficult for the Spanish conquistadores to cross them, especially with horses. Once they reached the open terrains of the Bogotá savanna, movement became easier.&lt;ref&gt;Langebaek, 1995b, Ch.1&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Temples ===
The Muisca, as part of their [[Muisca religion|religion]], built various temples throughout their territories. The most sacred were the Sun Temple in Sugamuxi and the [[Moon Temple (Chía)|Moon Temple]] in [[Chía, Cundinamarca|Chía]]. The Sun Temple was built to honour [[Sué]], the Sun god of the Muisca, and the Moon Temple was honouring his wife, [[Chía (goddess)|Chía]]. Also notable was the [[Goranchacha Temple]], according to [[Muisca mythology|Muisca myths]] built by [[Goranchacha]]. On one of the islands in [[Lake Fúquene]] there had been a temple with grand decoration and 100 priests, as described by De Piedrahita.&lt;ref name=Casilimas_p135&gt;Casilimas, 1987, p.135&lt;/ref&gt;

Pedro Simón noted that the temples were built with wood from the ''[[Guaiacum officinale|guayacán]]'' tree, to make them last long.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson &amp; Ostler, 2005, p.156&lt;/ref&gt;

According to De Piedrahita, the ''moxas'' were raised in the temples to make them as sacred as possible for when they would be sacrificed, which meant a great honour to the families who donated the young boys.&lt;ref name=Casilimas_p135/&gt;

=== Other structures ===
Other structures of the Muisca were mostly religious in character. Apart from their celebrations at natural areas, such as [[Lake Guatavita]], [[Lake Iguaque]], [[Lake Tota]], [[Lake Fúquene]], [[Lake Suesca]] and the [[Siecha Lakes]], the Muisca constructed some places where religious ceremonies were held, such as the [[Cojines del Zaque]] and the [[Hunzahúa Well]], both in [[Tunja|Hunza]], present-day Tunja.

As an exception to the wood-and-clay structures of the houses and temples of the Muisca people, allegedly one of their structures had been made of stone; the [[Cajicá#History|fortress of Cajicá]], just north of present-day Bogotá. The structure is described with walls of {{convert|80|cm|in}} thick and {{convert|4|m|ft}} high, but modern scientists have cast doubt on the structure and if it existed in the [[pre-Columbian era]].&lt;ref&gt;Román, 2008, p.288&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-conquest ==
The first construction of post-conquest architecture took place shortly after De Quesada had conquered the city of Bacatá, later called Santafe and known as the capital Bogotá in modern age. At the location of present-day [[Teusaquillo]], twelve houses and a church in the style of the Muisca -with wood and clay- had been constructed.&lt;ref&gt;Salcedo, 2011, p.158&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a general policy of the Spanish, eased by the non-permanent architecture of the Muisca, that existing structures would be taken down and replaced by Spanish colonial architecture.

=== Reconstructions ===
Reconstructions of Muisca ''bohíos'' and the most important temple of Sogamoso, are displayed in the [[Archaeology Museum, Sogamoso|Archaeology Museum]] in Sogamoso. This work has been done in the early stage of archaeological research on the Altiplano, in the 1940s. [[Eliécer Silva Celis]] was the architect and archaeologist involved in the reconstructions.

Archaeological work has been hindered by the constant expansion of the capital Bogotá in which vicinity and territory many ancient structures were built. An archaeological expedition of 2002 proved that within months the previously unoccupied [[List of Muisca and pre-Muisca sites|archaeological site]] was already covered with construction.&lt;ref&gt;Kruschek, 2003, p.56&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==
NewPipe does not use the official [[YouTube API]], but instead scrapes the website for video and meta-data (such as likes, dislikes, and views). This is done intentionally to decrease the amount of data shared with [[Google]]. The [[Web scraping|web-scraping]] tool is called the NewPipe-Extractor&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipeExtractor|title=TeamNewPipe/NewPipeExtractor|last=Schabesberger|first=Christian|date=|website=|via=GitHub|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a stand-alone project. It is also used in the free and open-source app SkyTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/ram-on/SkyTube|title=ram-on/SkyTube|last=|first=|date=|via=GitHub|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In newer versions of the app, the Extractor supports both YouTube and SoundCloud, and there are plans to extend it to more platforms.

Because of the way NewPipe accesses YouTube without using the API or displaying [[Online advertising|advertisements]], it would be in conflict with the Google [[terms of service]] if it were available on the [[Google Play|Google Play Store]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.slashgear.com/newpipe-youtube-android-app-with-more-controls-and-no-google-20492117/|title=NewPipe – YouTube Android app with more controls and no Google|last=Torres|first=J.

'''New Formalism''' is a late 20th- and early 21st-century movement in [[American poetry]] that has promoted a return to [[Meter (poetry)|metrical]] and [[rhyme]]d verse.

==Origins and intentions==

The term 'New Formalism' was first used in the article 'The Yuppie Poet'  in the May [[1985 in poetry|1985]] issue of the [[Associated Writing Programs|AWP]] Newsletter,&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Nigel S., 'Form and Function,' ''P. N. Review,'' 154; the [[Associated Writing Programs]] article was written by [[Ariel Dawson]]&lt;/ref&gt; which was an attack on what was perceived as a movement returning to traditional poetic forms. Dawson's article accused the New Formalist poets not only of social conservatism, but also of [[yuppie]] [[consumerism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Lake (poet)|Lake, Paul]], [https://archive.is/20050307211258/http://www.edge-city.com/lake.htm 'Expansive Poetry in the New Millennium'], a talk delivered at the West Chester Poetry Conference on 10 June 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; 

New Formalism was a reaction against various perceived deficiencies in the practice of contemporary poets. In his [[1987 in poetry|1987]] [[essay]] "Notes on the New Formalism," [[Dana Gioia]] wrote: "the real issues presented by American poetry in the Eighties will become clearer: the debasement of poetic language; the prolixity of the lyric; the bankruptcy of the confessional mode; the inability to establish a meaningful aesthetic for new poetic narrative and the denial of a musical texture in the contemporary poem. The revival of traditional forms will be seen then as only one response to this troubling situation."&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Hudson Review]]'' (40, 3, 1987)&lt;/ref&gt;  For women formalists, the situation was complicated by gender; as  [[Annie Finch]] wrote in 1994 in the Introduction to "A Formal Feeling Comes: Poems in Form by Contemporary Women", "Readers who have been following the discussion of the "New Formalism" over the last decade may not expect to find such a diversity of writers and themes in a book of formal poems; the poems collected here contradict the popular assumption that formal poetics correspond to reactionary politics and elitist aesthetics&amp;nbsp;... The passion for form unites these many and diverse poets."This is 'New Formalism'.

==Background==

Despite the  formal innovations of [[Modernism]] as exemplified in the work of [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[Ezra Pound]], and the widespread appearance of [[free verse]] in the early decades of the 20th century, many poets chose to continue working predominantly in traditional forms, such as [[Robert Frost]] as well as those poets in America sometimes associated with the [[New Criticism]], including [[John Crowe Ransom]], [[Robert Penn Warren]] and [[Allen Tate]]. During the 1960s, with a surge of interest in [[Confessional poetry]], publication of formal poetry became increasingly unfashionable.  The emergence of the [[Language poets]] in the 1970s was one reaction to the predominance of the informal confessional lyric.  But language poetry was another step away from the traditions of metre and rhyme, and was seen by some {{Who|date=December 2010}} as widening the divide between poetry and its public.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

==Early history==

An early sign of a revival of interest in traditional poetic forms was the publication of [[Lewis Turco]]'s ''The Book of Forms: A Handbook of Poetics'' in [[1968 in poetry|1968]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Book of Forms: A Handbook of Poetics'' E. P. Dutton &amp; Company, New York, 1968. A few years later Turco published a college textbook which presented poetry from the writer's perspective and emphasized the use of formal elements, this was ''Poetry: An Introduction through Writing'', Reston Publishing Co, 1973. {{ISBN|0-87909-637-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1970s [[X. J. Kennedy]] started publishing the short-lived magazine ''Counter/Measures'' which was devoted to the use of traditional form in poetry. A few other editors around this time were sympathetic to formal poetry,&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Steele in an [http://instructional1.calstatela.edu/tsteele/TSpage2/WalzerInter.html interview] mentions both [[Don Stanford]] at ''[[The Southern Review]]'' and [[Tom Kirby-Smith]] at ''[[The Greensboro Review]].'' He also mentions [[Robert L. Barth]]'s press and his series of metrical chapbooks.&lt;/ref&gt; but the mainstream was against rhyme and meter.

One of the first rumbles of the conflict that was to provide the impetus to create New Formalism as a specific movement, came with the publication in 1977 of an issue of the Mississippi Review called 'Freedom and Form: American Poets Respond'. The late 1970s saw the publication of a few collections by poets working in traditional forms, including Robert B. Shaw's ''Comforting the Wilderness,'' (1977), [[Charles Martin (poet)|Charles Martin]]'s ''Room for Error,'' (1978) and [[Timothy Steele]]'s ''Uncertainties and Rest'' (1979). In [[1980 in poetry|1980]] [[Mark Jarman]] and Robert McDowell started the small magazine ''[[The Reaper (magazine)|The Reaper]]'' to promote narrative and formal poetry. In [[1981 in poetry|1981]] [[Jane Greer (poet)|Jane Greer]] launched ''Plains Poetry Journal'', which published new work in traditional forms. In [[1984 in poetry|1984]] McDowell started Story Line Press which has since published some New Formalist poets. ''The Reaper'' ran for ten years.  [[Frederick Feirstein]]'s ''Expansive Poetry'' ([[1989 in poetry|1989]]) gathered various essays on the New Formalism and the related movement [[New Narrative]], under the umbrella term '[[Expansive Poetry]]'.

From 1983 the onset of "neoformalism" was noted in the annual poetry roundups in the yearbooks of ''The Dictionary of Literary Biography'',&lt;ref&gt;'The Year in Poetry' was contributed by Lewis Turco from 1983 to 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; and through the mid-1980s heated debates on the topic of formalism were carried on in several journals.&lt;ref&gt;for example, see ''[[Salmagundi (magazine)|Salmagundi]]'' 65 (1984) with [[Mary Kinzie]]'s piece "[[The Rhapsodic Fallacy]]," (pages 63 &amp;ndash; 79) and various responses; [[Alan Shapiro]]'s piece "The New Formalism," in ''[[Critical Inquiry]]'' 14.1 (1987) pages 200 &amp;ndash; 13; and [[David Wojahn]]'s "'Yes, But ...': Some Thoughts on the New Formalism," in [[Crazyhorse]] 32 (1987) pages 64 &amp;ndash; 81.&lt;/ref&gt; [[1986 in poetry|1986]] saw the publication of [[Vikram Seth]]'s ''[[The Golden Gate (Vikram Seth novel)|The Golden Gate: A Novel in Verse]]'' and the anthology ''Strong Measures: Contemporary American Poetry in Traditional Forms''.&lt;ref&gt;''Strong Measures: Contemporary American Poetry in Traditional Forms'' edited by Philip Dacey and David Jauss&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1990 in poetry|1990]] [[William Baer (poet)|William Baer]] started ''[[The Formalist]]'' and the first issue contained poems by, among others, [[Howard Nemerov]], [[Richard Wilbur]], and [[Donald Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;http://theformalist.evansville.edu/backissueorders.html&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine ran twice a year for fifteen years, with the fall/winter 2004 issue being the last.&lt;ref&gt;http://theformalist.evansville.edu/current.htm&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Formalist'' was succeeded by ''[[Measure (journal)|Measure: A Review of Formal Poetry]],'' which is published biannually by the [[University of Evansville]].

==Current activity==

Since 1995, [[West Chester University]] has held an annual [[West Chester University Poetry Conference|poetry conference]] with a special focus on formal poetry and New Formalism.  Each year the [[Robert Fitzgerald Prosody Award]] is awarded as part of the conference.

By the end of the 20th century, poems in traditional forms were once again being published more widely, and the new formalist movement per se was winding down. Since then, the effects of new formalism have been observed in the broader domain of general poetry; a survey of successive editions of various general anthologies showed an increase in the number of [[villanelle]]s included in the post-mid-'80s editions.&lt;ref&gt;French, Amanda Lowry, [http://www4.ncsu.edu/~alfrench/Writing/DISSERTATION.pdf Refrain, Again: The Return of the Villanelle], a doctoral dissertation, August 2004, page 13. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060721070940/http://www4.ncsu.edu/~alfrench/Writing/DISSERTATION.pdf |date=July 21, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The publication of books concerned with poetic form has also increased. [[Lewis Turco]]'s ''Book of Forms'' from 1968 was revised and reissued in 1986 under the title 'New Book of Forms. [[Alfred Corn]]'s ''The Poem's Heartbeat'', Mary Oliver's ''Rules of the Dance'', and Stephen Frye's ''The Ode Less Travelled'' are other examples of this trend. The widely used anthology ''An Exaltation of Forms: Contemporary Poets Celebrate the Diversity of Their Art'' (University of Michigan Press, 2002), edited by [[Annie Finch]] and Kathrine Varnes, defines formalist poetry as a form on a par with experimental, free verse, and even prose poetry.  

In 2001 the American poet [[Leo Yankevich]] founded ''[[The New Formalist]]'', which published among others the poets [[Jared Carter]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://theformalist.org/archives/62 Five Poems] at ''The New Formalist''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Keith Holyoak]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://theformalist.org/archives/161 Four Poems] at ''The New Formalist''&lt;/ref&gt;

Interest in the movement and in formal techniques continues, as the West Chester conference demonstrates, but the movement is not without its detractors.  In the November/December 2003  issue of ''[[P. N. Review]]'', N. S. Thompson wrote: "While movements do need a certain amount of bombast to fuel interest, they have to be backed up by a certain artistic success. In hindsight, the movement seems to be less of a poetic revolution and more a marketing campaign."&lt;ref&gt;[[N. S. Thompson]], 'Form and Function,' ''P. N. Review,'' 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Formalist canon==

The 2004 West Chester Conference had a by-invitation-only critical seminar on 'Defining the Canon of New Formalism', in which the following anthologies were discussed:&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven Schneider|Schneider, Steven]], 'Defining the Canon of New Formalist Poetry', ''Poetry Matters: The Poetry Center Newsletter,'' West Chester University.

[[File:Hilton, Oi Yoi Yoi.jpg|thumb|''Oi Yoi Yoi'', 1963, [[Tate Gallery]].]]

'''''Oi Yoi Yoi''''' is a 1963 oil painting by British painter [[Roger Hilton]].  Perhaps Hilton's best-known work, it is a free composition depicting a naked white woman.  The central figure is abstracted, with simple black outlines drawn in charcoal of a featureless face, breasts and pubic triangle, and upraised arms.  All four limbs are cut off at the edges of the frame.  The white body contrasts with bold segments of background colour in yellow and red, blue and black.  The work is inscribed on the back "Oi, yoi, yoi/Hilton/Dec 63".

According to Hilton, the painting was inspired by a drunken argument with his second wife, [[Rose Hilton]], who was dancing on a verandah, nude, shouting "oi yoi yoi", an expression of frustration or exasperation.  According to his wife, the argument took place in France in the summer of 1962, before they were married.  Hilton has rejected the suggestion that he took conscious inspiration from paintings of dancers and bathers by [[Cézanne]] or [[Matisse]], but admitted they were "probably subconsciously" important.

The painting was exhibited in the British Pavilion at the [[Venice Biennale]] in 1964.  It was also exhibited in a retrospective exhibition of Hilton's work at the [[Serpentine Gallery]] in 1974, along with a second version of the same subject, ''Dancing Woman'', which has as similar central figure but more muted background colours limited to blue, black and yellow.  ''Oi Yoi Yoi'' was purchased from the artist by the [[Tate Gallery]] in 1974 through [[Waddington Galleries]], and is displayed at [[Tate Britain]] in London.  ''Dancing Woman'' was purchased by the [[Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art]] in Edinburgh in 1981.  Both works measure {{convert|60|in|cm}} by {{convert|50|in|cm}}.

The paintings have similarities with the [[Dancing Beijing]] logo for the [[2008 Beijing Olympic Games]], designed by [[Guo Chunning]], which was inspired by the Chinese character [[京 (disambiguation)|京]] (jīng, meaning "capital"), and also resembles a dancing figure with arms raised, or a runner crossing a finishing line.  Hilton also may have taken inspiration from a Chinese character.

The '''Piano Trio No. 2  in E minor''', for violin, cello and piano, Op. 67, by [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] was written in 1944, in the midst of World War II.

==Composition history==
The composition was dedicated to Shostakovich's good friend, [[Ivan Sollertinsky]], a Russian [[polymath]] and avid musician, who had recently died at age 41.  The work received its premiere in [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] on 14 November 1944.  The piece consists of four movements, with a complete performance running 25 to 27 minutes.

==Structure==
# Andante -- Highly dissonant, it begins with an extremely difficult passage in the cello, all [[harmonics]]. The rest of the movement starts with canonic material, but then develops into a sonata form, requiring incredible amounts of technical prowess from all three instruments
# Allegro con brio -- A frenzied dance that never finds a settling place
# Largo -- Against a repeated background of piano chords, the violin and cello trade off dark, slow, and somber melodic lines. It fades into the last movement with hardly a break.
# Allegretto -- Staccato repeated notes begin this "Dance of Death" movement, which introduces a [[Jewish]]-style melody, and revisits the thematic content of the previous three movements. It ends in a tortured E Major chord, almost inaudibly.

The Jewish melody from the last movement was quoted in Shostakovich's famous [[String Quartet No. 8 (Shostakovich)|String Quartet No. 8]]. The third movement is featured in choreographer [[John Neumeier]]'s ballet "The Seagull" (Hamburg, 2002).

'''Pregnancy in art''' covers any [[artistic work]] that portrays [[pregnancy]] in women.  In art as in life, it is often unclear whether an actual state of pregnancy is intended to be shown.  A common visual indication is the gesture of the woman placing a protective open hand on her abdomen.  Historically, married women were at some stage of pregnancy for much of their life until the [[menopause]], but the depiction of this in art is relatively uncommon,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.moma.org/collection/works/79792 MOMA, New York, Note on Klimt's ''Hope II'']&lt;/ref&gt; and generally restricted to some specific contexts.  This probably persists even in contemporary culture; despite several recent artworks depicting heavily pregnant women, one writer was "astonished at the shortage of visual images&amp;nbsp;... of pregnant women in public visual culture".&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;  A research study conducted by [[Pierre Bourdieu]] in 1963 found that the great majority of 693 French subjects thought that a photo of a pregnant woman could not, by definition, be beautiful.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, 19&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two subjects often depicted in Western narrative art, or [[history painting]], where pregnancy is an important part of the story.  These are the unhappy scene usually called ''Diana and Callisto'', showing the moment of discovery of [[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]]'s forbidden pregnancy, and the biblical scene of the [[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]].&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 251; the entry on "Pregnancy" mentions only these two.&lt;/ref&gt;  Gradually, portraits of pregnant women began to appear, with a particular fashion for "pregnancy portraits" in elite portraiture of the years around 1600.

As well as being a subject for depiction in art, pregnant women were also consumers of art, with some special types of work developed for them, including ''Madonna del Parto'' images of Mary.

==Traditional cultures==
Images of pregnant women, especially small [[figurine]]s, were made in traditional cultures in many places and periods, though it is rarely one of the most common types  of image.  These include ceramic figures from some [[Pre-Columbian]] cultures, and a few figures from most of the ancient Mediterranean cultures. Many of these seem to be connected with [[fertility in art|fertility]].  Identifying whether such figures are actually meant to show pregnancy is often a problem, as well as understanding their role in the culture concerned.&lt;ref&gt;Talalay, Lauren E., "Archaeological Ms.conceptions: Contemplating Gender and the Greek Neolithic", in ''Representations of Gender From Prehistory To the Present'', 5-9, 2000, Springer, {{ISBN|1349623318}}, 9781349623310.  For an international survey of the subject in general, see ''The Oxford Handbook of Prehistoric Figurines'', ed. Timothy Insoll, 2017, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0199675619}}, 9780199675616, which has few mentions of pregnancy in its 900 pages. For Pre-Classic examples from the Highlands of [[Guatemala]], see [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5QJlCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA10 ''Handbook of Middle American Indians'', Volumes 2 and 3]&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the oldest surviving examples of the depiction of pregnancy are prehistoric [[figurines]] found across much of [[Eurasia]] and collectively known as [[Venus figurines]].  The best known is the [[Venus of Willendorf]], an [[Jurassic|oolitic]] [[limestone]] figurine of a woman whose breasts and hips have been exaggerated to emphasise her fertility. These figurines exaggerate the [[abdomen]], [[hips]], [[breasts]], [[thighs]], or [[vulva]] of the subject, but the degree to which the figures appear to be pregnant varies considerably, and most are not noticeably pregnant at all.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, 747; Cook&lt;/ref&gt;  An inevitably subjective survey of the corpus of about 140 figurines concluded that only 17% of them represented pregnant women, extending to 39% "which could possibly represent pregnancy".&lt;ref&gt;Taiz, 19&lt;/ref&gt;

==Western art==
[[Image:TitianDianaCallistoEdinburgh.jpg|thumb|[[Titian]]'s ''[[Diana and Callisto]]'', 1559, shows the moment when [[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]]'s pregnancy is discovered]]
In Europe, depictions of pregnancy were largely avoided in [[classical art]] (apart from small [[Votive offering|votive figure]]s), but later Western art had two subjects that were frequently depicted where pregnancy was integral to the narrative.

===Callisto===
In [[Greek mythology]] the nymph [[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]] became pregnant by [[Zeus]] (Jupiter to the Romans) in disguise. Her pregnancy was spotted when she was bathing, and her furious mistress [[Artemis]] (Diana) sent her away; Jupiter's wife [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] then turned her into a bear.  The few classical depictions tended to show this transformation, but in later art the traumatic moment of discovery was most often depicted, especially from the Renaissance onwards, using the Roman poet [[Ovid]] as the source.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 102–103, 251; Roberts, 752&lt;/ref&gt;

What became the typical composition was first seen in [[Titian]]'s ''[[Diana and Callisto]]'' (1559), where Callisto's abdomen is exposed as Artemis/Diana points accusingly at her and her other followers display a variety of reactions.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 102–103, 251; Roberts, 752&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Ovid places the discovery in the ninth month of Callisto's pregnancy ([[Metamorphoses]] II, [http://ovid.lib.virginia.edu/trans/Metamorph2.htm#476707506 441–465]), in paintings she is generally shown with a rather modest bump for late pregnancy.  But this is appropriate as the scene shows the moment when her intimate companions first realized that she was pregnant.  It is clear that the main attraction of the subject was the opportunity to depict a group of female nudes,&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, 752&lt;/ref&gt; though it could be claimed that it illustrated the serious consequences of an unwanted pregnancy.

===Virgin Mary===
Depictions of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] were by far the most frequent images featuring a pregnant woman in post-classical Western art, and probably remain so to the modern day.  The moment of Mary's conception of Jesus, called the [[Annunciation]], is [[Annunciation in Christian art|one of the most common]] subjects in traditional Christian art,&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 35–52&lt;/ref&gt; but depictions from later in her pregnancy are also common.  Unlike many other kinds of depictions of pregnancy, there is usually no ambiguity as to whether Mary is intended to be shown while pregnant, even where the pregnancy is not clearly visualized.

The [[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]], a meeting between two pregnant women, Mary and [[Elizabeth (Biblical person)|Elizabeth]], as recorded in the [[Gospel of Luke]] {{bibleref2|Luke|1:39–56|64}}, was very often depicted,&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 55&lt;/ref&gt; but their pregnancy is usually not emphasized visually, at least until [[Early Netherlandish painting]] of the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;Jolly, Chapter 1; Roberts, 749&lt;/ref&gt;  Medieval thinking held that Elizabeth was about seven months pregnant at the meeting, and Mary about one.&lt;ref&gt;Following {{bibleref|Luke|1:26|9}}, where Elizabeth is six months pregnant at the [[Annunciation]].  The relevant medieval Western feasts were [[Feast of the Annunciation]] on 25 March, [[Nativity of Saint John the Baptist]] on 25 June, and Christmas on 25 December.  The feast of the Visitation itself was on 2 July, rather illogically, as it was then after the birth of John.&lt;/ref&gt;

The loose full clothes used in religious art, as in normal medieval life, make it hard to detect in any case.  In late medieval paintings they may be shown with vertical gaps in their clothes; female medieval dress had openings that were normally closed by laces when dressing, but could be left open during pregnancy.  These may be either at the front or the sides, and are used in art to indicate pregnancy, although from about 1450 such gaps, revealing a contrasting colour of undergarment, became a fashion and can be seen in art on slim, unmarried women.&lt;ref&gt;Jolly, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases one or other places a hand on the bump of the other, as in [[Rogier van der Weyden]]'s [[Leipzig]] version (illustrated).  A few images, mostly Byzantine or Late Medieval German, show their unborn children in the womb, as though in a modern [[cutaway drawing]]. In German images they are naked (though usually with halos)  and [[John the Baptist]] bows or kneels to Jesus, who raises a hand in blessing.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 56; Hall, 251, 337; Roberts, 749&lt;/ref&gt;  It should be emphasized that in all periods the majority of depictions have little visual indication that either woman is pregnant; the story was well-known to its audience.

Some other images showed the pregnant Virgin with [[Saint Joseph]] or other relatives, including some of the ''Journey to Bethlehem'' for the birth.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, 749&lt;/ref&gt;  This last was a standard part of [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] cycles, but rare in the Western church.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 58&lt;/ref&gt;  There are a few images of Joseph and Mary looking for shelter or being turned away at the inn in [[Bethlehem]], mostly from north of the Alps after 1500; in these Mary is usually clearly pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;The subject is not covered by Schiller. It is called the ''Herbergssuche'' ("Search for shelter") in German. See [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Mary_and_Joseph_seeking_refuge the category on Wikimedia Commons].&lt;/ref&gt;

The rare subject of the ''Doubting of Joseph'' also needed to establish Mary's pregnancy, and some versions indicated this by unlaced openings in her dress or a "cutaway" unborn Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Jolly, Chapter 1, after fig 1.5, illustrates both types; Schiller, 56–57&lt;/ref&gt;  In this scene, based on {{bibleref2|Matthew|1:18–25|64}} and [[New Testament apocrypha|apocryphal]] elaborations, Joseph is unsettled by the pregnancy of his virgin bride, but is later reassured by an angel who comes to him in a dream, the first of his [[Saint Joseph's dreams|four dreams]] in Matthew.  Mary is often shown spinning while pregnant; the spinning figure with "cutaway" illustrated has Joseph's head appearing through the tracery at left.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 57, figs 141 and 142&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar painting in [[Budapest]], where Mary spun while Joseph slept and the angel appeared to him, the unborn Jesus is not visible in the painting now, but can be seen in the [[underdrawing]] with [[infrared reflectography]].  Either the artist or patron had a change of mind at the time, or it was overpainted later, perhaps as the motif came to be felt indecorous or primitive.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Maria gravida, or Mary at the Spinning Wheel from Németújvár (c.1410, Hungarian gallery).jpg|Image, with note from the Hungarian National gallery]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Other similar images are of Mary alone, especially as statues; these are called ''Maria gravida'' ("Pregnant Mary") and are covered below.
[[File:Piero Madonna del parto.jpg|thumb|''[[Madonna del Parto]]'' by [[Piero della Francesca]], c. 1460, with unlacing at the front and side.]]

A number of Early Netherlandish paintings show [[Mary Magdalene]] with the same unlaced opening in her dress.  Penny Howell Jolly has proposed that this motif represents her "spiritual pregnancy", although in his account of the most famous example, ''[[The Descent from the Cross (van der Weyden)|The Descent from the Cross]]'' by van der Weyden (c. 1435, now [[Prado]]) [[Lorne Campbell (art historian)|Lorne Campbell]] notes the unlacing, but attributes it merely to Mary Magdalene's distressed condition.&lt;ref&gt;Jolly, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Madonna del Parto]] is a term for figures of the [[Virgin Mary]] especially associated with pregnancy and childbirth, or showing the Virgin pregnant.  These are not very common; the best known is the [[fresco]] by [[Piero della Francesca]], where a heavily pregnant Mary has a prominent unlaced opening at the front of her dress, and another at the side.&lt;ref&gt;Jolly, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;  However, these depictions fell from fashion during the Renaissance, and the Piero is the latest known from [[Tuscany]].&lt;ref&gt;Ferrie&lt;/ref&gt;  These attracted the devotions of pregnant women or those concerned for them, as well as those wanting a pregnancy.  Queen [[Claude of France]], who had seven children before dying at the age of 24, had the painting of the ''Visitation'' by [[Sebastiano del Piombo]] (now [[Louvre]]) in her chamber.&lt;ref&gt;"Claude de France", 80–81, ''Encyclopedia of Women in the Renaissance: Italy, France, and England'', edited by Diana Maury Robin, Anne R. Larsen, Carole Levin, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OQ8mdTjxungC&amp;pg=PA81 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

A few of these images of Mary feature a "cutaway" view of Jesus ''in utero'' within, as found in some images of the ''Visitation'' (see above),&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, 749&lt;/ref&gt; and many have the same protective gesture of the hand on the stomach, which also features in portraits of pregnant women when these begin to appear.  After the [[Counter-Reformation]] a visualized ''in utero'' Jesus becomes rare, and instead Mary may be shown with the [[Christogram]] "IHS" on her stomach.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Mary_with_Jesus_shown_%27%27in_utero%27%27 the Wikimedia Commons category]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Eastern Orthodox]] icons, the ''in utero'' Jesus, which is normally fully clothed, remains part of the tradition for certain representations to the present day. It is found in one of the most famous [[Russian icon]]s, the 12th-century [[Ustyug Annunciation]] in the [[Tretyakov Gallery]], Moscow, which has the birth-size Child shown inside the chest area, and in the icons of Mary of the type known as ''Pomozhenie rodam'' in Russian, translated as "Help in childbirth"  (or "Succour in travail").

===Portraits===
[[File:Attributed to Marcus Gheeraerts II - Portrait of an Unknown Lady - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|English "pregnancy portrait" of an unknown lady, attributed to [[Marcus Gheeraerts II]], c. 1595&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/gheeraerts-portrait-of-an-unknown-lady-t07699 Tate page], attributed to Marcus Gheeraerts II, ''Portrait of an Unknown Lady'', c.1595&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In the [[Late Middle Ages|Late Medieval Period]], portraits of pregnant-looking women began to be painted, though the fashion for dresses gathered at the front makes these difficult to interpret or identify with confidence.&lt;ref&gt;Jolly, Chapter 1, after fig 1.5&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Arnolfini portrait]] by [[Jan van Eyck]] of 1434 might be an example of pregnancy, but the current views of art historians are mostly against this, as virgin saints were often shown in much the same way.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Edwin, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=IJOwCF2xkc4C The Arnolfini Betrothal: Medieval Marriage and the Enigma of Van Eyck's Double Portrait]'', Berkeley: University of California Press, 1015-106, 1994, {{ISBN|0-520-08251-6}}. The text is also available from the [http://ark.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/ft1d5nb0d9/ California Digital Library]&lt;/ref&gt;  The virgin martyr and "princess" Saint [[Catherine of Alexandria]], usually dressed in the height of fashion in this period, was also the [[patron saint]] of childbirth, so there may be a degree of deliberate ambiguity in images of her.

Some Italian Renaissance portraits thought to be of pregnant women show them wearing a gauzy underdress called a ''guarnello'', often associated with pregnancy or the period after childbirth. These include [[Leonardo Da Vinci]]'s [[Mona Lisa]], where the garment first became visible under [[infrared and thermal testing|infra-red scans]] in 2006, suggesting that [[Lisa del Giocondo]], the sitter, was pregnant or just had a baby when she was painted.  Another painting with a ''guarnello'' is [[Botticelli]]'s ''[[Portrait of a Lady Known as Smeralda Brandini]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/15029288/ns/technology_and_science-science/t/was-mona-lisa-pregnant-when-she-posed/#.WQFLcNz_qM8 "Was Mona Lisa pregnant when she posed?"], [[Associated Press]], carried by NBC, 27 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; where the sitter also holds a hand over the top of her bump.  This is a feature seen in many images such as ''Visitation'' scenes where pregnancy is certain, and that probably indicates it in cases where it is much less clear, including some portraits by [[Anthony van Dyck]].&lt;ref&gt;Hearn, 43, note 18&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[La Donna Gravida]]'' ("The Pregnant Lady") by [[Raphael]] is another example, with an apparently pregnant woman sitting with her left hand over her stomach, but such depictions remained infrequent in [[Renaissance art]].&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, 750&lt;/ref&gt;

An exception to this is the "pregnancy portrait" (a term first used by Karen Hearn, a [[Tate Britain]] curator) of a woman shown as heavily pregnant, usually standing.  These are especially found in England, where the fashion may have been popularized in about the 1590s by [[Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger]], an English painter of Flemish parentage, who was the leading English painter of these portraits.  Part of the reason for them may have been the risk to the mother of childbirth and some may well be posthumous.&lt;ref&gt;Hearn, throughout&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some earlier examples from court portraiture on the Continent,&lt;ref&gt;"'Only matrimony maketh children to be certain...': Two Elizabethan pregnancy portraits", 19, Pauline Croft and Karen Hearn, ''The British Art Journal'', Vol. 3, No. 3 (Autumn 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; and in England,&lt;ref&gt;Hearn, 39–40&lt;/ref&gt; but the main group of English portraits dates from roughly the late 1580s to about 1630.&lt;ref&gt;Hearn, 40&lt;/ref&gt;  At around the same time as the English examples [[Margaret of Austria, Queen of Spain]] sent portraits of herself while pregnant to close female friends and relations.&lt;ref&gt;Anne J. Cruz, Maria Galli Stampino, eds., ''Early Modern Habsburg Women: Transnational Contexts, Cultural Conflicts, Dynastic Continuities'', 156, 2016, Routledge, {{ISBN|1317146921}}, 9781317146926, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=plkfDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA156 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;  The example illustrated below by her court painter [[Bartolomé González y Serrano]], which was sent back home to the Austrian Habsburgs, only varies her standard official portrait by exchanging her daughter for the usual dog or chair at the left, and bringing out her dress at the front.  Probably no fresh posing for the artist was necessary.  Her daughter, [[Anne of Austria]], Queen of France, was herself painted when 8 months pregnant with the future [[Louis XIV of France]], born 23 years into her marriage.&lt;ref&gt;However, they had both been 14 at the marriage, which was probably not consummated for some time.&lt;/ref&gt;  The portrait of their unfortunate cousin, Holy Roman Empress [[Maria Leopoldine of Austria]], who died in childbirth at 16 in 1649, the year the portrait is dated, is perhaps a posthumous adaptation of her wedding portrait.

Later portraits of pregnant women tended to be family members or at least friends of the artists; relatively few women, or their husbands, chose to commission expensive portraits (often only done once in a lifetime) showing them pregnant, although many women spent most of at least the early years of their married life pregnant.  The most common moment for a woman to have her portrait painted was just after her marriage, when any suggestion of pregnancy would be unwanted.  In some well-documented cases, the subjects of portraits can be shown to be well into pregnancy when the portrait was painted, but this is "suppressed" or "concealed" in the image.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, 750("suppressed"); Hearn, 39 ("concealed")&lt;/ref&gt;  It was a relatively simple matter for a portraitist to remove or add a pregnant belly to a painting.  Several of the paintings (which are not portraits, though no doubt models from his circle were used) of [[Vermeer]] have been said to show pregnant women, but specialists mostly discount this.  One specialist was not aware of any portrait showing a pregnant woman from the whole of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]].&lt;ref&gt;Hearn, 39, citing Marieke de Winkel.  Klepp, 138, says the same of 18th-century British America&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast to 16th-century styles, "the fashion that had developed by the 1620s was especially helpful for a person trying to hide a swelling belly", even if only in a portrait.&lt;ref&gt;Luthman, Johanna, ''Love, Madness, and Scandal: The Life of Frances Coke Villiers, Viscountess Purbeck'', 76, 2017, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0198754655}}, 9780198754657, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WeE-DgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA76 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1904 a portrait of his wife by [[Lovis Corinth]], dated five days before the birth, shows a profile view that emphasizes the pregnancy.  The prolific Corinth painted several pregnant women, many apparently not portraits.  [[Paula Modersohn-Becker]] painted herself as pregnant in 1906 before she had ever been so; in the following 18 months she had a daughter, dying three weeks later.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, 750&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moralizing genre or satire===
[[File:William Hogarth 009.jpg|thumb|[[William Hogarth]], ''A Woman Swearing a Child to a Grave Citizen'' c.1729]]
Some [[Early modern period|Early Modern]] depictions in [[genre painting]], or other media such as [[popular print]]s or book illustrations, addressed the social implications of pregnancy, either showing women who were seen as having more children than they could afford, or women, especially maids, who had become pregnant outside marriage, with dire social implications for them.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, 750–752&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of narrative scenes which show unwanted pregnancies essentially from the father's point of view, including some where the woman has brought the matter before local magistrates to award financial support, as unmarried women were able to do in England (uniquely, according to [[Bernard Picart]], who poured scorn on the law).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.genguide.co.uk/source/bastardy-bonds-amp-documents-parish-amp-poor-law/140/ Bastardy Bonds &amp; Documents (Parish &amp; Poor Law)]; for Picart's comments, see [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1M9CAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA253 pp. 254–256]&lt;/ref&gt;  The English artist [[William Hogarth]] included many pregnant women in his works, usually with a satirical or comic intention, and generally more often giving a negative implication than a positive one.&lt;ref&gt;Klepp, 132–138; [http://english231ballads2014w.pbworks.com/w/file/fetch/71584958/Mitchell.pdf Mitchell, PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;  In Hogarth's ''A Woman Swearing a Child to a Grave Citizen'' (or ''The Denunciation'', c.1729, [[National Gallery of Ireland]]) a young woman falsely accuses a rich old man of fathering her child, while the real father advises her.  The verses on the print version summarize the situation:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=3560226&amp;partId=1&amp;people=33462&amp;peoA=33462-1-7&amp;page=2 British Museum page on a print version].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Here pregnant Madam screens the real Sire,/And falsly swears her Bastard Child for Hire/Upon a Rich old Letcher, who denies/The Fact, and vows the naughty Hussif lies;/His Wife enrag'd, exclaims against her Spouse,/And swears she'l be reveng'd upon his Brows;/The Jade, the Justice and Church Ward'ns agree,/And force him to provide Security.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In particular Hogarth depicted a number of pregnant ballad-sellers, and ones with young children.  Since the job required little movement, it was perhaps often taken during pregnancy, but Hogarth seems to have reflected a set of contemporary ideas using pregnancy as a metaphor for printing as a means of reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, throughout&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern===
[[File:Gustav Klimt - Hope, II - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|''Hoffnung II'' ("[[Hope II]]"), [[Gustav Klimt]], 1907-08]]
As the modern era approached, some artists began to show pregnancy more explicitly, with heavily pregnant figures, and more pregnant nudes than before.  Two paintings (not portraits as such) by [[Gustav Klimt]], ''[[Hope I]]'' (1903) and ''[[Hope II]]''  (1907–08), show slim, heavily pregnant women in profile. In ''Hope I'' the figure is nude, and the pregnancy very evident,&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, 749&lt;/ref&gt; while in ''Hope II'' a huge and elaborate dress or cloak makes this less immediately clear.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.moma.org/collection/works/79792 MOMA, New York, Note on Klimt's ''Hope II'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Egon Schiele]] made pregnant nudes the subject of many of his drawings with colour, favouring a frontal view.  ''The Pregnant Woman'' by [[Pablo Picasso]] was a [[sculpture]] dedicated to his then partner Francoise Gilot and was made out of [[plaster]], [[armature (sculpture)|metal armature]], [[wood]], [[ceramic art|ceramic vessels]] and [[jars]]. Picasso wanted to inspire Gilot to have a third child with him by making this sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.artsy.net/artwork/pablo-picasso-pregnant-woman-la-femme-enceinte|title=Pablo Picasso – Pregnant Woman (Femme Enceinte)|publisher=artsy.net|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pregnant woman'' was the most famous painting in a series of paintings of seven pregnant [[nude women]] painted by [[Alice Neel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/jul/07/alice-neel|title=The weird world of Alice Neel|work=The Guardian|date=7 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Pregnant girl'' was a painting of 1960–61 by [[Lucian Freud]] that portrayed his then girlfriend Bernadine Coverley, when she was pregnant with their daughter Bella.&lt;ref&gt;[http://press.khm.at/fileadmin/content/KHM/Presse/2013/Freud_Neu/KHM_Freud_booklet_ENG.pdf Lucian Freud exhibition], No. 10, Press release/exhibition booklet, [[Kunsthistorisches Museum Wien]], Vienna, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  There have been nude sculptures of heavily pregnant women by, among others, [[Damien Hirst]], with ''The Virgin Mother'' (now at [[Lever House]] in New York)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leverhouseartcollection.com/collectionsexhibitions/collection/virgin-mother ''The Virgin Mother'' Lever House Art Collection]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Verity (statue)|Verity]]'', 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In contrast to the general rarity of artistic depictions of pregnancy, in the field of medical illustration it has been one of the earliest and commonest subjects, with the same "[[cutaway drawing]]" approach found in some medieval religious works typically used.  The foetus is generally the main focus of interest, rather than the mother.  Most early depictions used in manuals on midwifery were very inaccurate, but still useful for showing the positions for delivery in [[childbirth]].  They were based on the re-copying over many generations of images from medical texts going back to [[Soranus of Ephesus]] in antiquity and [[Muscio]] in about 500.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, 747–748&lt;/ref&gt;

The accurate drawings by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] may have been the first to be made, but professional medical texts took centuries to catch up.  The Scottish anatomist [[William Hunter (anatomist)|William Hunter]], doctor to [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Queen Charlotte]], was an admirer of Leonardo's drawings in the [[Royal Collection]] and learnt from their clear depictions.  His own work, ''The Anatomy of the Gravid Uterus Exhibited in Figures'', was published in 1774 and based on extensive study of late pregnant corpses;&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, 748; Wells, ''The Heart of Leonardo'', 249, 2014, Springer Science &amp; Business Media, {{ISBN|1447145313}}, 9781447145318, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tuq5BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA249&amp;lpg=PA249 google books]&lt;/ref&gt; how he obtained so many was the subject of suspicion at the time and subsequently.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/feb/07/british-obstetrics-founders-murders-claim Founders of British obstetrics 'were callous murderers'], Denis Campbell, 7 February 1997, ''The Observer'', accessed April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art for pregnant women==

Some kinds of art have been designed with pregnant women especially in mind, though these are perhaps less common than art intended for women wanting to become pregnant (discussed in art history using the term "[[fertility in art|fertility]]").  One of the many contexts and uses speculated for [[Venus figurine]]s is that they were held in the hand during childbirth, for which their rather consistent size and shape seems well suited. However, there are a variety of other explanations.&lt;ref&gt;Vandewettering, Kaylea R. (2015) "Upper Paleolithic Venus Figurines and Interpretations of Prehistoric Gender Representations", ''PURE Insights'': Vol. 4, Article 7, [http://digitalcommons.wou.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1051&amp;context=pure free online]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Madonna del Parto]] and other images of the pregnant Virgin Mary were often mainly designed to offer a focus for the devotions of pregnant women and those concerned for them. In 1954 the mayor of [[Monterchi]], home of the [[Piero della Francesca]] ''Madonna'', refused to lend it to an exhibition in Florence so as not to deprive the population of its benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Ferrie&lt;/ref&gt;

The painted ''[[desco da parto]]'' ("birth tray" or "birth salver") was an important symbolic gift for married women in late medieval and [[Early Modern]] [[Florence]] and [[Siena]].  Both sides were typically painted, but with different types of scenes.  The upper side (or [[recto]]) generally had a crowded figure scene, usually secular, such as a scene from [[classical myth]] or a suitable [[allegory]].  Scenes from the [[Old Testament]] or the Christian religious repertoire also appear in some cases.  Birthing scenes were popular.&lt;ref&gt;V&amp;A; Musacchio, Jacqueline Marie, "The Medici-Tornabuoni Desco da Parto in Context", ''Metropolitan Museum Journal'' '''33''' (1998:137–151)&lt;/ref&gt;

The underside or [[verso]] generally has a simpler and often less elevated subject, with fewer, larger figures, and usually includes [[heraldry]], with the arms of both parents shown.&lt;ref&gt;The Medici-Tornabuoni tray is painted with the feather device of [[Piero di Cosimo de' Medici|Piero de' Medici]] and the coats of arms of the Medici and Tornabuoni families.&lt;/ref&gt;  Scenes with one or two naked boy toddlers, with the [[coats of arms]] of both parents at the sides, are especially popular.

In the Renaissance it was believed that the sights a pregnant woman saw affected her pregnancy and even what it produced – [[Martin Luther]] told the cautionary story of a woman frightened by a mouse in pregnancy, who then gave birth to a mouse. Manuals advised keeping images with a positive impact in the sight of pregnant women, and it is in this context that the recurrent naked boys, and the scenes showing the end of a successful childbirth, should be seen.  This was also a factor in the display of images of the [[Virgin and Child]], which were ubiquitous in bedrooms. Probably the desci were hung with the verso displayed during pregnancy, to promote the production of a similar healthy boy.&lt;ref&gt;V&amp;A&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Red Pawn''''' is a [[screenplay]] written by [[Ayn Rand]]. It was the first screenplay that Rand sold. [[Universal Pictures]] purchased it in 1932.&lt;ref name=peikoff&gt;{{Harvnb|Peikoff|1984|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Red Pawn'' features the theme of the evil of dictatorship, specifically of [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]].

''Red Pawn'' is a [[spy thriller]] set on Strastnoy Island in an undisclosed location in northern [[USSR|Soviet Russia]] during the 1920s. On the island is a converted monastery used as an institution for [[political prisoner]]s. The screenplay follows Joan Harding, aka Frances Volkontzev, an American woman who infiltrates Strastnoy Island to free her imprisoned husband, Michael Volkontzev.

Joan enters the prison under the pretext of being the new wife of the prison head Commandant Kareyev given to him by the state. A [[love triangle]] develops between the three characters as Joan works to free her husband while fooling the prison staff and Kareyev as to her true intentions.

The rights to the screenplay belong to [[Paramount Pictures]], though the screenplay has never been adapted to film.&lt;ref name=peikoff/&gt;

== Plot ==

Joan Harding arrives by boat at Strastnoy Island and is presented to Commandant Kareyev as his new, state-granted wife. Kareyev greets Joan coldly, believing that she will leave when the next boat comes six months later. Kareyev takes Joan on a tour around the prison island during which she observes the prisoners. Joan's husband, Michael Volkontzev, recognizes her and calls out to her, but she pretends not to recognize him. It is only later in her room that Joan (real name Frances Volkontzeva) reunites with Michael and tells him of her plan to free him. She will sneak him onto the next boat and help him escape the country through the help of an English merchant in the nearby town of [[Nizhnekolymsk|Nijni Kolimsk]]. She asks that Michael trust her and keep his distance so Kareyev and others do not suspect that they know each other.

Months pass and Joan becomes friends with many of the [[political prisoner]]s on the island, and slowly Commandant Kareyev begins to feel affection for her. Michael is torn over how his wife seems to return that affection and begins to doubt his wife's intentions. Joan arranges for Michael to sneak onto the next boat while the guard is given leave by Kareyev at her insistence, but she will not be joining Michael on the boat. He is to go alone while she stays with Kareyev. Joan tells Michael to meet up with the merchant and that in order to avoid suspicion, she would follow in the coming months.

The night of his escape, Michael barges into Kareyev's room and tells the Commandant that he has attempted to escape and reveals that Joan is his wife. Kareyev has his assistant, Comrade Fedossitch, place Michael in detention and tell Joan that she will be taking the ferry the next day to leave Strastnoy Island. Joan confesses her love for Kareyev and begs him to leave his post and escape with her and Michael, so that she and Kareyev can live together. Kareyev considers her offer but refuses, saying that he cannot betray his Party and his comrades. He tells Joan to pack her things to depart alone in the morning.

Fedossitch confronts Kareyev, telling him Joan should be arrested for deceiving them and the Party. Kareyev puts Fedossitch under arrest and then goes to Joan's room and tells her to follow him to the detention tower to free Michael, so all three of them can escape. The three board the ferry and make their way to shore where they commandeer a horse sled from a local farmer. As the trio make their way to shore, it is discovered that Michael, Joan, and Kareyev are no longer on the island and Fedossitch is freed by a fellow officer. Fedossitch finds that the radio is destroyed, so he alerts the shore of the escape using the monastery's bell and light signals.

Kareyev, Michael, and Joan attempt to flee to the merchant's house and are forced to seek shelter in an empty barn. The two men begin fighting over who should be with Joan. They ask her who she loves, but before Joan has the chance to answer they are discovered and arrested. The commanding officer reveals that Joan and the traitorous commandant are to be taken to the [[State Political Directorate]] headquarters in Nijni Kolimsk, mentioning that it is across the street from an English merchant's house. Joan realizes there is still hope if they can escape their cells and go across the street. However, the commander reveals that Michael is to be taken away for immediate execution. The soldier, unable to distinguish the two male captives, asks Joan to identify which man is her husband. Joan points to Kareyev and tells soldiers he is the one; he makes no objections. The screenplay ends as Kareyev is taken away for execution while Joan and Michael are driven to Nijni Kolimsk with the hope of escape and a future together.

==History==
Rand began writing ''Red Pawn'' in 1931.&lt;ref name=t1&gt;{{harvnb|Trammell|2004|p=257}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had emigrated to the United States from the Soviet Union five years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to starting ''Red Pawn'', she had worked as a junior screenwriter for [[Cecil&amp;nbsp;B. DeMille]], but by 1931 she was working in the wardrobe department at [[RKO]] Studios.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|p=36}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had been writing her debut novel, ''[[We the Living]]'', but took a break to write the screenplay in hopes of earning enough money to allow her to write full-time. She sold the screenplay and the synopsis to Universal Pictures in 1932 for $1,500, her first professional sale.&lt;ref name=peikoff/&gt; The studio postponed the filming of the screenplay several times, and with Hollywood entering its [[Red Decade]], the anti-Soviet themes of the film made it unattractive to filmmakers.&lt;ref name=t1/&gt; Universal later traded the property to Paramount, which has held onto the rights since, although ''Red Pawn'' has never been filmed.&lt;ref name=t1/&gt;

==Significance==
Professor of literature at [[Anderson University (South Carolina)|Anderson College]] Jena Trammell has cited ''Red Pawn'' as a crucial point in Rand's career and in the development of her aesthetic philosophy, [[romantic realism]].&lt;ref name=t1/&gt;

''We the Living'', finally published in 1936, shares some basic plotlines with ''Red Pawn''. Both feature a [[love triangle]] set against the background of the early [[Soviet Union]], with the woman protagonist having an anti-Communist lover and a Communist one, and with the Communist finally compromising or renouncing his ideological allegiance for love of her.

'''Seapunk''' is a [[subculture]] that originated on [[Tumblr]] in 2011. It is often associated with an aquatic-themed style of fashion, [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[Internet art|net art]], [[iconography]], and allusions to [[popular culture]] of the 1990s. The advent of seapunk also spawned its own [[electronic music]] [[microgenre]], featuring elements of [[Southern hip hop]] and [[pop music]] and [[Contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B music]] of the 1990s. Seapunk gained limited popularity as it spread through the [[Internet]], although it was said to have developed a [[Chicago]] [[Nightclub|club]] scene.&lt;ref name="ChicagoReader"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/seapunk-twitter-tumblr-ultrademon-zombelle-molly-soda/Content?oid=5389539|title=The Week Seapunk Broke|last=Raymer|first=Miles|date=January 12, 2016|work=[[Chicago Reader]]|publisher=Sun-Times Media, LLC|accessdate=August 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Originally, seapunk started as a [[Fad|trend]] and an [[Internet meme]] on [[Tumblr]] in 2011. The term "seapunk" was coined by [[DJ]] Lil Internet in 2011, when he humorously wrote in a tweet on [[Twitter]] saying, "Seapunk leather jacket with barnacles where the studs used to be."&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/04/fashion/Seapunk-a-Web-Joke-With-Music-Has-Its-Moment.html|title=Little Mermaid Goes Punk: Seapunk, a Web Joke With Music, Has Its Moment|last=Detrick|first=Ben|date=March 2, 2012|work=[[The New York Times]]|via=|accessdate=August 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2011, ''Cluster Mag'' reported on the emergence of seapunk in [[electronic media]] and quoted [[Pictureplane]], who described seapunk as "a mostly [[Internet phenomena|Internet-based phenomenon]] birthed out of the [[Tumblr]] and [[Twitter]] universes as a means to describe a lifestyle aesthetic that is all things oceanic and of the sea."&lt;ref name="Cluster Mag"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://theclustermag.com/2011/12/the-abyss-seapunk-splishsplash-oceangang/ | title=The Abyss: #seapunk #splishsplash #oceangang | last=Stephens | first=Alexis | date=December 5, 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909201415/http://theclustermag.com/2011/12/the-abyss-seapunk-splishsplash-oceangang/ | archive-date=September 9, 2015 | accessdate=September 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miles Raymer of the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' described seapunk music as "a style of music that incorporates bits of 90s [[house (music)|house]], the past 15 years or so of [[Pop music|pop]] and [[Contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]] and the latest in [[Southern hip hop|southern trap rap]]—all overlaid with a twinkly, narcotic energy that recalls [[new-age music]] and [[chopped and screwed]] [[hip hop]] [[Mixtape|mix tapes]] in roughly equal measure."&lt;ref name="ChicagoReader" /&gt; According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', seapunk music "constitutes a tiny [[Music genre|music subgenre]]" that contains elements of [[Witch house (music genre)|witch house]], [[chiptune]], [[drum and bass]] and [[Southern hip hop|Southern rap]]. ''The New York Times'' also noted that some seapunk tracks [[remix]] songs from [[Contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]] acts such as [[Beyoncé]] and [[Aaliyah]].&lt;ref name="NYTimes" /&gt; In January 2012, an article about seapunk music was featured in the ''[[Dazed &amp; Confused (magazine)|Dazed &amp; Confused]]'' magazine. Katia Ganfield interviewed Lily Redwine (a.k.a. [[Ultrademon]]) in the article, titled "Seapunk: A new club scene intent on riding sub-bass sound waves into the future".&lt;ref name="Dazed &amp; Confused Seapunk Article"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://katiaganfield.tumblr.com/post/15519605971/my-article-in-most-recent-dazed-and-confused-about|title=Seapunk: A new club scene intent on riding sub-bass sound waves into the future|last=Ganfield|first=Katia|date=January 2012|publisher=Waddell Limited|pages=26–270|access-date=August 16, 2016|work=Dazed &amp; Confused|issue=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hair and makeup===
Seapunks often dye their hair, and sometimes facial hair, with varying shades of [[Turquoise (color)|turquoise]], [[Lilac (color)|lilac]], and sea blue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2015/06/27/merman-colour-is-the-next-big-thing-in-mens-hair-5268577/|title=Merman colour is the next big thing in men’s hair|last=Scott|first=Ellen|date=June 27, 2015|website=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|access-date=August 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seapunk styling was appropriated by several mainstream [[popular music]] and [[hip hop]] artists during the 2010s, most notably [[Kreayshawn]], [[Nicki Minaj]], [[Soulja Boy]], [[Taylor Swift]], [[Katy Perry]], [[Lady Gaga]], [[Azealia Banks]], [[Rihanna]], and [[Frank Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1891900/frank-ocean-blue-hair/|title=Frank Ocean Is Basically A Merman|last=Muller|first=Marissa G.|date=August 7, 2014|website=[[MTV#Internet|MTV]]|access-date=July 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seapunk digital imagery and use of social networking media==

Images featuring neon flashing colors and rotating geometric shapes floating above oceans of brilliant blue or green water flood the pages tagged with a #Seapunk [[hashtag]] on [[Tumblr]]. Seapunk digital imagery draws largely from 1990s 3D [[Internet art|net art]]. The aforementioned imagery has given rise to other internet-based subgenres consisting of similar themes, such as slimepunk and icepunk.&lt;ref name=NYTimes /&gt;

Rapper [[Azealia Banks]] used seapunk imagery in her "Atlantis" music video in 2012.&lt;ref name="Spin"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.spin.com/2012/11/azealia-banks-rihanna-seapunk-beef-saturday-night-live-video/|title=Seapunks Salty Over Rihanna and Azealia Banks' 'Net Aesthetics|last=Martins|first=Chris|date=14 November 2012|work=Spin Magazine|accessdate=12 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singer [[Rihanna]] was influenced by seapunk in her "[[Diamonds (Rihanna song)|Diamonds]]" performance on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in 2012.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Respect"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://respect-mag.com/you-never-thought-seapunk-would-take-it-this-far-zombelle-talks-azealia-banks-rihanna-the-week-the-second-internet-exploded|title=You Never Thought Seapunk Would Take It This Far|last=Harwood|first=Nick|date=November 30, 2012|publisher=Respect|accessdate=February 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elements of seapunk imagery were claimed to have influenced designers such as [[Versace]] and Cartiergod's "Ocean Gang".&lt;ref name="DailyBeast"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/12/10/seapunks-internet-trend-takes-high-fashion-from-proenza-schouler-to-versace-photos.html|title=Seapunks Internet Trend Takes High Fashion, from Proenza Schouler to Versace|last=Sidell|first=Misty White|date=December 10, 2012|website=[[The Daily Beast]]|accessdate=February 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Spindle, Shuttle, and Needle'''" is a German [[fairy tale]] collected by the [[Brothers Grimm]], tale number 188.

It is [[Aarne-Thompson]] type 585.

==Synopsis==

A girl's parents having died, was raised by her godmother, who died, leaving her the house and a spindle, a shuttle, and a needle to earn her living.  She did quite well at it.

One day, a king's son came looking for a bride.  He wanted one who was at once the richest and the poorest.  In this village, they pointed out the richest girl, and then the orphan girl.  He rode by the richest girl, who bowed to him, and he rode on.  He rode by the poorest girl, who was spinning.  When she saw he was looking at her, she blushed and closed her eyes.  He rode by, and she opened the window, saying it was hot, but watching until he left.

Then she remembered rhymes her godmother had used.  She set the spindle to guide the prince back by its golden thread, the shuttle to weave a path to her hut, and the needle to adorn the hut.  When the prince returned, he said she was both the richest and the poorest, and married her.  The spindle, shuttle, and needle were kept in the royal treasury.

The '''Symphony in [[D minor]]''' is the most famous [[orchestra]]l work and the only mature [[symphony]] written by the 19th-century [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[composer]] [[César Franck]].  After two years of work, the symphony was completed 22 August 1888. It was premiered at the [[Conservatoire de Paris|Paris Conservatory]] on 17 February 1889  under the direction of  [[Jules Garcin]].   Franck dedicated it to his pupil [[Henri Duparc (composer)|Henri Duparc]].

==Orchestration==
The score calls for 2 [[Western concert flute|flute]]s, 2 [[oboe]]s, [[cor anglais]], 2 [[soprano clarinet]]s, [[bass clarinet]], 2 [[bassoon]]s, 4 [[French horn|horns]], 2 [[cornet]]s, 2 [[trumpet]]s, 3 [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], 3 [[timpani]], [[cymbals]], [[triangle]], [[bass drum]], [[tam-tam]] [[harp]] and [[string orchestra|strings]].

== History and controversy ==

César Franck's fame and reputation rest largely upon a small number of compositions, most of them composed toward the end of his life.  Of these, the Symphony in D minor was one of his last works. It was first performed only a year before Franck died.

The fact that Franck finally chose to write a symphony is itself unusual, given the rarity of the form in 19th-century France, which considered the symphony a mainstay of German music.  It is likely that the genesis of the Symphony in D minor followed upon the success of his influential ''[[Symphonic Variations (Franck)|Symphonic Variations]]'' for piano and orchestra composed in 1885.

Additionally, the success of several works by other French composers had nudged the symphonic form back into favour with the French concert-going public, beginning with the 1857 ''Symphony'' for piano by Franck's friend [[Charles-Valentin Alkan]], with whom Franck had shared concerts in Paris in the late 1830s and to whom Franck dedicated his ''[[Grande Pièce Symphonique]]''.  The [[Symphony No. 3 (Saint-Saëns)|Third (Organ) Symphony]] by [[Camille Saint-Saëns]] and (although a work for piano and orchestra) the ''[[Symphony on a French Mountain Air]]'' by [[Vincent d'Indy]],&lt;ref&gt; See Leon Vallas, ''The Discovery of Musical Germany by Vincent d'Indy in 1873'' &lt;u&gt;The Musical Quarterly&lt;/u&gt;, Vol. 25, No. 2 (April 1939), 176-194&lt;/ref&gt; both written in 1886 and popularly received, had further helped to revive the symphony as a concert piece, almost dormant since the appearance of [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz']] ''[[Symphonie fantastique]]'' in 1830.  (An earlier piece, the ''[[Symphonie espagnole]]'' (1875) by [[Édouard Lalo]] is a [[violin concerto]].) Both these works, however, sought to create compositional distance from the symphonic form and sound of the German romantic idiom (exemplified by [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]] and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]) through several "French" innovations, including integrating piano (and in the case of Saint-Saëns, the organ) into the orchestra, and using a [[Cyclic form|cyclic]] thematic style.

Like the earlier works of Saint-Saëns and Berlioz, as with his own compositions, Franck also made use of a cyclic structure in the composition of his symphony.  Indeed, the Symphony in D minor remains the most outstanding example of cyclic symphonic writing in the [[Romantic music|Romantic]] tradition.  However, Franck also used a typically "Germanic" sound, eschewing both the novelties of orchestration (with one notable exception) or nationalist thematic inspiration that Saint-Saëns and d'Indy had used to differentiate their own symphonic works.  As a result, Franck's Symphony in D minor can be seen as the union of two largely distinct national forms: the French cyclic form with the German romantic symphonic form, with clear Wagnerian and [[Franz Liszt|Lisztian]] influences.

Due in part to this unexpected fusion, the piece was poorly received upon its first performance.  More importantly, however, the reception of Franck's symphony was greatly affected by the politicised world of French music following the split in the [[Société Nationale de Musique]], which had been founded by Saint-Saëns in 1871 in the anti-German spirit aroused by the [[Franco-Prussian War]], to promote a French style of music.&lt;ref&gt;For a general background, see Michael Strasser, ''The Société Nationale and Its Adversaries: The Musical Politics of L'Invasion germanique in the 1870s'', &lt;u&gt;19th-Century Music&lt;/u&gt;, Spring 2001, Vol. 24, No. 3, 225-251.&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1886 split was driven by the Société's decision to accept "foreign" (i.e. principally German) music and an admiration for the music of Richard Wagner by some of its younger members (notably Franck himself and D'Indy).  This unacceptable betrayal of French music led several conservative members of the Société, led by Saint-Saëns, to resign; Franck himself thereon assumed the presidency.  The resulting environment was poisonous.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Cheyronnaud, ''« Eminemment français » Nationalisme et musique'', &lt;u&gt;Terrain&lt;/u&gt; (''En Europe, les nations''), 17, Oct 1991, s.l. Available online at: [http://terrain.revues.org/document3016.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  The controversy permeated the Conservatoire de Paris and made it very difficult for Franck to get his symphony premiered.  His score rejected by the leading conductor [[Charles Lamoureux]], Franck resorted to the conservatory orchestra which was obliged to play faculty works.  Even then, rehearsals were desultory and reaction negative.

Sitting in on a rehearsal under the baton of [[Jules Garcin]], where the players were resistant and uncooperative, Conservatoire director [[Ambroise Thomas]] is supposed to have remarked in reaction to the second movement (and quoted by Vincent d'Indy, in his biography of Franck) "name a single symphony by [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] or [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] that uses the [[Cor anglais|English horn]]!"{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}  (This may well be apocryphal and used by d'Indy - who was firmly in the Franck camp - to mock the conservative Thomas, since Haydn had very famously used English horns in his own [[Symphony No. 22 (Haydn)|Symphony No. 22, "The Philosopher"]].){{Original research inline|date=January 2017}}

Politics continued to determine the popular reaction to the symphony's first performance.  Critics saw the work as a clumsy attempt at orchestral writing that departed too stridently from the [[Classical music era|classical]] symphonic form and [[Harmony|harmonic]] rules of Haydn and Beethoven.&lt;ref&gt;See generally C. Goubault ''La critique musicale dans la presse française de 1870 à 1984'' (Slatkine, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;  Contemporaries, mostly allied with the conservative faction of the Société Nationale de Musique, were unsparing.  The noted music critic, a close friend and voluminous correspondent of Camille Saint-Saëns, Camille Bellaigue (1858-1930) dismissed it is as "arid and drab music, without ... grace or charm," and derided the principal four-bar theme upon which the symphony expands throughout as "hardly above the level of those given to Conservatoire students." It is derived from the 'Muss es sein?' fragment from Beethoven's final [[String Quartet No. 16 (Beethoven)|String Quartet op. 135]].{{Cn|date=January 2017}} The review ''[[Le Ménestrel]]'' called it "morose.... [Franck] had very little to say here, but he proclaims it with the conviction of the pontiff defining dogma."  And [[Charles Gounod]], also making implicit reference to the idea of a dogmatic German style, wrote of it: "incompetence pushed to dogmatic lengths."

Regardless, within several years of its composition, the symphony was regularly being programmed across [[Europe]] and in the [[United States]]. It received its American premiere in [[Boston]] on 16 January 1899 under the baton of [[Wilhelm Gericke]].

== Form ==
In a departure from typical late-romantic symphonic structure, the Symphony in D minor is in three movements, each of which makes reference to the initial four-bar theme introduced at the beginning of the piece. The omission of the standard [[Scherzo]] movement is in part compensated for with a scherzo-like treatment in the second movement.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

* I. ''Lento''; ''Allegro ma non troppo''.
:An expansion of a standard [[Sonata form|sonata-allegro]] form, the symphony begins with a harmonically lithe subject (below) that is spun through widely different keys throughout the movement.

[[Image:FranckOpeningTheme.png|center|The opening theme of Franck's Symphony in D played on by Viola, Cello and Bass]]

:This simple theme forms the thematic basis for the cyclic treatment in the rest of the work.

* II. ''Allegretto''
:Famous for the haunting melody played by the English horn above plucked [[harp]] and [[string instrument|strings]]. The movement is punctuated by two trios and a lively section that is reminiscent of a scherzo.

* III. Finale: ''Allegro non troppo''
:The movement begins with possibly the most joyful and upbeat melody Franck ever wrote {{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} and is written in a variant of Sonata form.  The [[coda (music)|coda]], which recapitulates the core thematic material of the symphony, is an exultant exclamation of the first theme, inverting its initial lugubrious appearance and bringing the symphony back to its beginnings.

'''Terrain.org: A Journal of the Built + Natural Environments''' is an online journal publishing editorials, poetry, essays, fiction, articles, reviews, an interview, the ARTerrain gallery, and the Unsprawl case study on a rolling schedule, with up to five new contributions per week. Terrain.org also hosts an annual contest in fiction, nonfiction, and poetry.

''Terrain.org'' was founded in 1997 by Simmons Buntin and Todd Ziebarth. The first issue appeared in summer 1998 and featured work by R.T. Smith, David Rothenberg, Rick Cole, [[James Howard Kunstler]], Sherry Saye, and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://terrain.org/archives/archives-issue-1/ Terrain.org first issue]&lt;/ref&gt;

Contributors and interview subjects since then include [[Alison Hawthorne Deming]], [[David Quammen]], Lauret Savoy, [[Terry Tempest Williams]], [[Joy Harjo]], [[Sandra Steingraber]], [[Scott Russell Sanders]], Kathryn Miles, [[Gary Snyder]], [[Wendell Berry]], [[Andres Duany]], and many others. Each issue is archived.

''Terrain.org'' appears to be the first completely online environmentally oriented journal, and continues to be one of the most comprehensive journals with original content exploring the nexus between the built and natural environments where it exists, and attempting to generate a discourse where that nexus does not exist.

In March 2009 ''Web del Sol'' called ''Terrain.org'' a "Top 50 Literary Magazine and Metazine."&lt;ref&gt;[http://webdelsol.com/index-new-magazines2.htm Web del Sol Top 50 Literary Magazines and Metazines]&lt;/ref&gt; Other awards include [[Dzanc Books]] Best of the Web selections in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dzancbooks.org/store/botw2008.html Dzanc Books Best of the Web 2008] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090910053830/http://www.dzancbooks.org/store/botw2008.html |date=2009-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dzancbooks.org/store/botw2009.html Dzanc Books Best of the Web 2009] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615075618/http://www.dzancbooks.org/store/botw2009.html |date=2010-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2010;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dzancbooks.org/store/botw2010.html Dzanc Books Best of the Web 2010] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529170240/http://www.dzancbooks.org/store/botw2010.html |date=2010-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Top 100 Architectural Blogs listing by International Listings (though ''Terrain.org'' is not a blog, it does offer the [http://blog.terrain.org/ Terrain.org Blog]); Planetizen Top 50 Website;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planetizen.com/websites/2003 Planetizen Top 50 Websites for 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Utne Reader'' Best of the Alternative Web.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.terrain.org/about/kudos.htm Terrain.org Awards and Good Words] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010041624/http://www.terrain.org/about/kudos.htm |date=2010-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Terrain.org'' has editors as well as an international [http://terrain.org/about/editors/editorial board] that serves primarily in an advisory capacity.

The online journal also has a partnership with the journal / book series ''Terra Nova: Nature &amp; Culture'', published by [[MIT Press]]. ''Terra Nova's'' editor David Rothenberg is a ''Terrain.org'' editorial board member and contributing editor. ''Terrain.org'' occasionally republishes work originally appearing in print editions of ''Terra Nova''.

''Terrain.org'' often conducts readings, occasionally in conjunction with sponsors.

'''''The Enraged Musician''''' is a 1741 [[etching]] and [[engraving]] by English artist [[William Hogarth]] which depicts a comic scene of a violinist driven to distraction by the cacophony outside his window. It was issued as companion piece to the third state of his print of ''[[The Distrest Poet]]''.

==Background==
In November 1740, Hogarth advertised his intention to issue a three-image set: ''The Provok'd Musician'', ''[[The Distrest Poet]]'', and a third image on the subject of "Painting" . The third image was never completed, and the two other prints were issued together in November 1741. The engraving appears to be based on an oil sketch held in the [[Ashmolean Museum]] in [[Oxford]], though there are some differences between the monochrome sketch and the engraving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&amp;workid=6634&amp;searchid=10433&amp;tabview=text|title=The Enraged Musician|publisher=Tate|accessdate=7 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Picture==

The image is ostensibly a purely comic scene. While the violinist attempts to rehearse, the noisiest inhabitants of London pass by his window. On the far left a squawking parrot perches above a pregnant ballad-seller singing "The Ladies' Fall" while holding her bawling baby. A young girl with a rattle (otherwise [[ratchet (instrument)]]) looks with amazement at a boy urinating below the musician's window (this is an often repeated image in Hogarth's work: similar scenes can be seen in ''[[The March to Finchley]]'' and in his illustrations for ''[[Hudibras]]'' and may be a reference to [[John Gay]]'s "[[Trivia (poem)|Trivia]]").&lt;ref&gt;Paulson p.145&lt;/ref&gt; The boy has a cord tied round his waist attached to a trailing slate which would clatter along the ground as he ran. In the centre of the picture a young milk-seller calling her wares provides the real focus of the picture; though set back more from the viewer than some of the subjects, she appears larger than the children and the crouching figure of the cutler. She balances a large pail of milk on her head and is the only subject that looks out at the viewer. This, combined with the large expanse of white apron, draws the viewer's eye towards her. [[Ronald Paulson]], the modern authority on Hogarth, suggests that she is singing and that her beauty and grace—she delicately lifts her skirt to avoid dragging it through the boy's urine—mark her out as the only natural musician in the scene; while the other inhabitants of the street produce discordant notes, the music of the violinist would be no better, because he has restricted himself by his studies and by removing himself from nature. He covers his ears to block out the cacophony of the street noise, but at the same time he denies himself the sweet music of the milkmaid's voice.&lt;ref&gt;Paulson p.115&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Laroon the merry milk maid.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Savage (engraver)|John Savage]]'s etching of [[Marcellus Laroon]]'s (c.1688) ''The Merry Milk Maid''. Images of the ''Cryes'' genre may have been a target of Hogarth's satire; Laroon's ''The Cryes of the City of London'' was the most popular series of this type during Hogarth's lifetime.]]
The milkmaid is flanked on either side by street musicians: to her right a man plays a [[oboe|hautboy]], metaphorically thumbing his nose at the violinist; and to her left a small boy beats a drum. Behind the milkmaid, a paviour beats the ground with a heavy rammer. In the lower right-hand corner a dog barks at the racket created by a knife-grinder sharpening a cleaver. Behind these characters, a host of street vendors noisily announce their services: a dustman with a basket on his back rings a handbell, a sow-gelder blows a horn, and a [[fishmonger]] cups his hand to his mouth as he shouts. In the distance there is a hint of yet more noise. A church—traditionally identified as [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]] yet closer in form to [[St Giles-in-the-Fields]]&lt;ref&gt;Barlow p.200&lt;/ref&gt;—flies a flag, suggesting perhaps an important event during which bells would be rung. The building to the right is the works of pewterer John Long, from which would issue a constant ring of hammers, and on its roof two hissing cats with arched backs prepare to fight. Appearing from the chimney is a sweep who may be calling to an unseen colleague that his work is done. In the lower left corner some loose bricks—suggestive of building works out of view—have been piled up (no doubt noisily) into a little house. The long-nosed violinist framed in the open window clamps his hands to ears in frustration.&lt;ref name="Hallett"&gt;Hallett p.138&lt;/ref&gt;

While the image entertains purely by the number of references to noisy activities crammed into the scene, the play-bill for Gay's ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'', prominently displayed on the wall next to the musician's window, hints at developments in British music at the time. ''The Beggar's Opera'' had enjoyed extraordinary success and had caused, or at least coincided with, a shift in the taste of audiences away from Italian opera and towards "British" music and homegrown culture. Hogarth was an enthusiastic supporter of the change in public tastes. He had mocked the vogue for continental fashions in many of his works (''[[A Rake's Progress]]'' and ''[[Marriage à-la-mode (Hogarth)|Marriage à-la-mode]]'' both have scenes dedicated to the foolishness of the ''[[Levée]]'', and, in 1724, even before ''The Beggar's Opera'', in the earliest of his self-published satirical prints ''[[The Bad Taste of the Town]]'' Hogarth mocked the fashion for Italian opera and Italian opera singers). The play-bill here is anachronistic as it advertises the play with the original 1728 cast. The musician's identity has never been satisfactorily established. He is identified as an Italian both by Jean André Rouquet, whose French notes on the prints were approved by Hogarth, and by [[John Trusler]] who claimed Hogarth's widow's approval for his ''Hogarth Moralized''.&lt;ref&gt;Barlow p.201&lt;/ref&gt; He has been variously identified as a number of foreign musicians of the time, including "Corvetto, well known by the name of Nosee"&lt;ref name="Hogarth"&gt;Hogarth p.209&lt;/ref&gt; (probably [[Giacobbe Cervetto]], often caricaturized for his large nose), and [[Pietro Castrucci]], the leader of [[Handel]]'s orchestra. Handel had noted the shift in public taste himself, and from the 1730s he composed more English oratorio and theatre works, including the setting the works of [[John Milton|Milton]], [[John Dryden|Dryden]] and [[William Congreve (playwright)|Congreve]] to music.&lt;ref name="Hallett" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hogarth" /&gt; Hogarth, as well as comically juxtaposing high and low culture, could be suggesting that a foreign tradition is being silenced by a burgeoning sense of Britishness. This may have been an afterthought though, as the playbill was not present in the earliest impressions, and the hautboy player and paver are usually respectively identified as Jewish and Irish, while the drummer boy is dressed in the same fashion as the young [[Huguenot]] leaving the church in ''Noon'', the second scene of Hogarth's ''[[Four Times of the Day]]''. The musician has also been identified as John Festin (mistakenly rendered as Foster in some accounts), a teacher of the flute and hautboy, by Hogarth's friend and biographer John Ireland and later by the commentator John Trusler. The story Festin told Hogarth obviously provided the inspiration for at least part of the scene:

{{quote|I once waited upon my lord Spencer, but his lordship being out of town, from him I went to Mr. V——n. It was so early that he was not arisen. I went into his chamber, and, opening a shutter, sat down in the window-seat. Before the rails was a fellow playing upon the hautboy. A man with a barrow full of onions offered the piper an onion if he would play him a tune. That ended, he offered a second onion for a second tune; the same for a third, and was going on: but this was too much; I could not bear it; it angered my very soul—'Zounds!' said I, 'stop here! This fellow is ridiculing my profession; he is playing on the hautboy for onions!'&lt;ref&gt;Trusler p.64&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The hautboy player has similarly defied identification. Charles Frederick Weideman, a leading London flautist, who had played the oboe earlier in his career, has been suggested as the flautist seen playing in plate 4 of ''[[Marriage à-la-mode (Hogarth)|Marriage à-la-mode]]'', and in ''The Enraged Musician: Hogarth's Musical Imagery'', Jeremy Barlow claims that he and the hautboy player are one and the same.&lt;ref&gt;Barlow p.204&lt;/ref&gt;
The presence of many street traders may also satirise [[Marcellus Laroon]]'s much-copied 17th-century prints of ''The Cryes of the City of London'' and more recent images by Hogarth's rival, [[Giacomo Amiconi]].

==Variations==
[[Image:Enragedmusician trial.jpg|thumb|right|The early trial was not as crowded or, by extension, as noisy, as the issued print. The character of the drummer boy was most changed between versions, but other subjects also underwent alterations, and more features were added.]]
An early trial impression was missing the church steeple, cats, the man blowing the horn and the play-bill. In this version the dustman was missing his nose (a sign that he was syphilitic), a doll was placed in the model brick house in the foreground, and the drummer boy sported a Grenadier's cap. The drummer was handsome and had turned to look towards the little girl. By the time the print was issued this suggestion of a domestic theme with the boy, girl, and house with "child" had been removed. The boy had his cap removed and his handsome face turned away from the girl and replaced by features which [[Charles Lamb (writer)|Charles Lamb]] described as "idiotic".&lt;ref name="Hogarth" /&gt; The doll was removed and the girl given a rattle to add to the image of pure noise.&lt;ref&gt;Paulson. p.116&lt;/ref&gt; Later copies featured a black horse in place of the white horse ridden by the horn blower and showed cross-hatching on the sleeves of the ballad-seller and the play-bill. Later impressions also made the dog and grinder darker, while lightening the cap of the sow-gelder.&lt;ref name="Hogarth2"&gt;Hogarth p.210&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Garden of Eden with the Fall of Man''''' or '''''The Earthly Paradise with the Fall of Adam and Eve''''' is a 1617 painting by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] (figures) and [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]] (flora and fauna). It is housed in the [[Mauritshuis]], Netherlands. The painting depicts the moment just before the consumption of [[forbidden fruit]] and the [[fall of man]].

Adam and Eve are depicted beneath the [[tree of the knowledge of good and evil]], where various fruits grow. On the opposite side the [[tree of life]] is depicted, also laden with fruits. The scene is a reference to [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Genesis#2:8|Genesis 2:8–14]]. A monkey biting an apple to the left symbolizes sin.&lt;ref name="getty"&gt;{{cite book | authors=J.

"'''The Jolly Roger'''" is the seventeenth episode of the [[Once Upon a Time (season 3)|third season]] of the American fantasy drama series ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'', and the show's 61st episode overall, which aired on April 13, 2014.

In this episode, Ariel pleads with Hook to search for Eric, whom she believes disappeared upon his return to Storybrooke, as [[Emma Swan]] receives a lesson on how to defeat Zelena from Regina, meanwhile, Mary Margaret and David try to convince Henry that they are not as boring as Henry thinks. Meanwhile, back in the Enchanted Forest, Ariel believes that Hook kidnapped Eric, but when Hook's ship disappears, the two start their search to find out what happened.

==Plot==

===Opening Sequence===
David's pickup truck is featured driving in the forest.

===In the Characters' Past===
In the Enchanted Forest, a knight stands in the road blocking two other knights from passing and demands that they leave the treasure. The knights do not take him seriously but all of a sudden, flaming arrows light up all around the 2 knights and they retreat. It turns out that the knight who orchestrated this ambush is Hook, with help from Smee and two of his crew members, and all the flaming arrows were held by dummies.  As they arrive to a tavern to celebrate their latest steal, Hook's men get him a bar girl, but outside he turns her down, then he gets knocked out by Ariel, who then orders Hook to his feet and he tells her she's got the wrong pirate. Ariel tells Hook that Eric was taken aboard the Jolly Roger, and when Hook asks her who's the captain of his ship now, Ariel shows Hook a knife with carved initials, which Hook recognizes as those belonging to Blackbeard. Hook laments that he hasn't been the same since he got back to the Enchanted Forest because he hasn't used his ship. However, Hook is left with no choice but to have Ariel come along with him and Smee. As they trek across the forest, Hook tells Ariel that she may not find Eric, but she tells him she's heard stories of Hook helping Snow White reunite with her family in Neverland, and she says there's nothing wrong with being good, but Hook says (reluctantly) he's a pirate and that he always will be one.

As they reach the docks next to the Jolly Roger, Hook sees one of Blackbeard's men and knocks him out, when all of a sudden his adversary Blackbeard shows up to give him a message: if Hook wants his ship, he'll have to fight for it. Hook accepts and a sword fight battle commences, but just as Hook is about to kill Blackbeard, Ariel tells Hook they need to know where Eric is first, because he's not on board. It turns out that Blackbeard has left Eric stranded on a deserted island, and offers Hook a deal in which he'll tell him where Eric is if Hook gives up the Jolly Roger, or else Eric will die. Ariel tries to talk Hook into saving Eric and giving up the Jolly Roger, but he tells her love brings pain and that he's doing her a favor. As Hook cuts Blackbeard loose and tosses him overboard, Ariel slaps Hook and tells him he's selfish and heartless, and that's what will bring him endless torment. Then, she jumps off the plank into the water to find Eric.

===In Storybrooke===
In David and Mary Margaret's loft, [[Emma Swan]] helps David put a crib together, and along with Regina and Mary Margaret, Zelena has become the main subject of conversation as Regina has put a protection spell over the loft. Emma tells Regina she wants her to teach her magic so they can defeat Zelena. David then offers to watch Henry, but Emma says Henry doesn't think they're fun, as he thinks Hook is better to be around with. At the docks, a homesick Smee tells Hook he and the men miss him, but when he asks Hook what happened to the Jolly Roger, Hook tells him all he needs to know is the ship's not here and has no intention of leaving Storybrooke. As Emma walks up with Henry, Hook flirts with Emma and tells her he thinks it's good she's going to be learning about magic, which she says will be enough to defeat Zelena, then she's done, but Hook tells her she can't pretend this never happened since she can't go back to her old life, saying it didn't work for him. At the same time, Mary Margaret and David walk on the beach and notice a group gathered around a woman who just washed up on shore, which they discover is Ariel. When Mary Margaret and David ask Ariel what happened to her, she tells them that Eric's missing and she's been looking for him, adding that she has no memories of the missing year. David suggests that Hook might know what happened to Eric. Later on at Granny's diner, Hook teaches Henry how to roll dice, when David comes in and "introduces" Ariel to him, but when she asks Hook if he saw Eric during the missing year, he lies to her, saying that he never heard of him, and as the others (David, Mary Margaret and Ariel) talk about finding him in Storybrooke, Hook refuses to help (believing that Eric is dead), but David wants Hook to help Ariel anyway while he and Mary Margaret watch over Henry.

At Regina's vault, Regina warns Emma not to touch anything as they talk about Hook watching Henry and Hook flirting at Emma all the time. Regina then uses her magic to send Emma to a rope bridge across a deep chasm, where Regina tells Emma that she's going to push her instincts, and as the boards start flying off the bridge, Regina says Emma has to reach into her gut and she can either stop it or die. Emma falls off the bridge, when she suddenly levitates herself back up to the top of the gorge. Meanwhile, Mary Margaret and David talk about how to be more fun and cool around Henry, and David later proceeds to teach Henry how to drive in his truck, as Henry almost causes an accident as he almost hits a car and hits a mailbox.

Ariel and Hook pay a visit to Gold's shop and talk to Belle, where Hook finds his spyglass and notices a clasp that belongs to Eric. After a hopeful Ariel hugs Hook, Belle then pours a magical liquid infused with a locator spell onto Eric's cloak, which will help bring them closer to Eric. At the docks, the two use Eric's cloak as it floats through the air to the water, only to disappear under the surface, which disappoints Ariel, who starts to cry as she mourns her loss, and Hook tells her he's sorry. Ariel thanks Hook for helping find Eric's cloak, saying that she wishes she knew how it ended and that Hook has a true heart, adding that she will always be grateful to him. But as Hook runs up to Ariel he reveals to her they met in the missing year and explains what happened to Eric, saying that he was too ashamed to tell her before, he apologizes. Ariel calls Hook a coward and a monster because he traded a man's life for his ship. Then, when Hook begs for redemption, Ariel makes Hook swear that he still believes in love, and that he still loves the woman who broke his heart. Unfortunately, after admitting to his confession by swearing on Emma Swan's name, Ariel blows green powder onto Hook's lips and then transforms into Zelena, who had used her disguise as Ariel, because she knew that Hook's guilt from the day he chose the Jolly Roger over Eric would continue to haunt him. Zelena also cursed his kiss, meaning the next time he kisses Emma, her magic will disappear, leaving her powerless to stop Zelena. Since Hook realizes Zelena is unable to kill Emma, Zelena warns him that unless he kisses Emma to have her magic removed, she'll continue to threaten Emma's family and friends, by using Rumplestiltskin's dagger to kill them. Later that evening, Hook visits the loft, where he lies and tells Emma and Regina that Ariel had left to find Eric. Using a "magic mirror" spell, Emma watches the real Ariel and Eric embracing on a beach, happy and safe. As David, Mary Margaret and Henry return to the loft, Henry tells the others that he had a lot of fun with the couple. As Hook leaves, Emma tells him that even if he won't tell her what happened in the past year she's tired of living in the past. And as he sees the family having dinner at Granny's later on, Hook is troubled that he couldn't tell Emma the truth, because he is torn over Zelena's threat to hurt Emma's loved ones if he doesn't, and the knowledge of what will happen if he kissed her.

===Ratings===
The episode posted a 2.0 among adults 18-49 with a total of 6.5 million viewers and won its timeslot. Overall, a majority of Sunday night programs were also down that evening besides this one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/04/14/tv-ratings-sunday-resurrection-cosmos-hit-lows-once-upon-a-time-down-revenge-steady-crisis-up/253534/ "TV Ratings Sunday: 'Resurrection' &amp; 'Cosmos' Hit Lows, 'Once Upon A Time' Down, 'Revenge' Steady, 'Crisis' Up"] from TV By The Numbers/Zap2It (April 14, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===
The episode was met with positive reviews.

Hillary Busis of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave it a great review: ""The Jolly Roger" was an appropriately exciting hour of television—complete with the sort of confounding, frustrating final twist that ''Once'' should consider having trademarked. All that, plus the return of JoAnna Garcia Swisher's delightfully daffy Ariel?&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvrecaps.ew.com/recap/once-upon-a-time-season-3-episode-17/ "'Once Upon a Time' recap: Boat Show"] from [[Entertainment Weekly]] (April 13, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

Christine Orlado of ''TV Fanatic'' gave the episode 4.4 out of 5 stars.&lt;ref name="TV Fanatic"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tvfanatic.com/2014/04/once-upon-a-time-review-a-tortured-hero/|title=Once Upon a Time Review: A Tortured Hero|work=TV Fanatic|date=April 13, 2014|accessdate=April 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amy Ratcliffe of IGN gave it an 8.5, saying that "This week's ''Once'' focused on Hook, and things got awfully exciting - in a good way."&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/04/14/once-upon-a-time-the-jolly-roger-review|title=ONCE UPON A TIME: "ONCE A PIRATE..."|work=IGN|last=Ratcliffe|first=Amy|date=April 14, 2014|accessdate=April 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gwen Ihnat of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave the episode a B, noting that "Hook has been one of the more delightful character reinventions on ''Once Upon A Time''. Turning the classic permed villain into a swaggery anti-hero, now a tortured romantic, is one of the most successful character transformations this show has taken on. The episode title “The Jolly Roger” refers to Hook’s efforts to get his boat back, his true love, but really the vessel is just a stand-in for his actual true love, Emma, who—due to yet another unfortunate curse!—seems farther away from him than ever by the end of the episode." &lt;ref name="AVClub"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/once-upon-time-jolly-roger-203396|title=ONCE UPON A TIME: "The Jolly Roger" |work=The A.V.

'''The Louisville Palace''' (also known as the '''Palace Theatre''') is a music venue in [[downtown Louisville|downtown]] [[Louisville, Kentucky]], located in the city's theater district, on the east side of Fourth Street, between Broadway and Chestnut Street. It has a [[seating capacity]] of 2,700 people and is owned by [[Live Nation Entertainment|Live Nation]].  The historic landmark opened on September 1, 1928, and was designed by architect [[John Eberson]].&lt;ref name=lpalace&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.louisvillepalace.com/VenueInfo#history|title=The Louisville Palace Theater|publisher=Live Nation Worldwide, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally known as the Loew's and United Artists State theatre.

''The Palace'' exhibits a [[Spanish Baroque architecture|Spanish Baroque]] motif with [[arcade (architecture)|arcade]]s, [[balconies]] and [[turret]]s. [[Cobalt blue]], bursts of red and gold indirectly light all of the niches, coves and entrances. Above is a curved, [[vaulted ceiling]] with 139 sculptures of the faces of historical figures. The theater room inside ''The Palace'' is heavily ornamented and displays an imitation nighttime sky on the ceiling.

The theater is two [[storey|stories]] with a floor and a balcony.  Both floors contain [[bar (counter)|bar]]s that run the width of the building behind the theater, separated by a grand lobby of intricate art and architecture.

Although the exterior had fallen behind the interior, the Palace was re-dedicated in 1994 and is now a premiere venue.&lt;ref name=lpalace/&gt;

Its uncommon appearance has made it a popular venue for musicians to record live performances (including [[Third Day]] &amp; [[Alison Krauss]]).  On June 2, 1983, [[A Flock Of Seagulls]] performed at the Palace and the show was recorded for broadcast by NBC's [[The Source]]. The theatre features an array of popular [[film|movie]]s, old and new, as well as concerts by popular artists.

'''Vannes Cathedral''' ({{lang-fr|Cathédrale Saint-Pierre de Vannes}}) is a [[Roman Catholic]] [[church architecture|church]] dedicated to [[Saint Peter]] in [[Vannes]], [[Brittany]], [[France]]. The [[cathedral]] is the seat of the [[Bishop of Vannes]].

The present [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] church was erected on the site of the former [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] cathedral. Its construction lasted from the 15th to the 19th centuries; if the length of the existence of the 13th century Romanesque [[bell tower]] is included, a total of seven centuries of construction.

The cathedral was declared a [[basilica minor]] by [[Pope Pius IX]] on 5 June 1870.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cathedrale-vannes.fr/index.php/cathedrale-exterieur/3-exterieur/detail/2-cathe02exthd?tmpl=component#3 Vannes Cathedral website: basilica] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first building was erected around 1020 in Romanesque style. Built out of [[granite]] and continuously modified by adding new structures, the cathedral is an extremely composite building. The rebuilding in Gothic style dates mainly from the 15th and 16th centuries. In this period the [[nave]] and the ornate gateway at the northern end of the north transept &amp;ndash; whose twelve niches, according to Breton custom, were supposed to accommodate the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]] &amp;ndash; were built high. The northern tower is the main remnant of the former Romanesque building, while the [[vault (architecture)|vault]]s and the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] were built between 1771 and 1774.

==Architecture==
[[File:VannesGroundPlan.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Floor plan|Ground plan]] of the cathedral itself.]]

===Dimensions===
The horizontal dimensions of the building can be derived from the [[floor plan|ground plan]]. (Data on the heights are not available for the moment). The building is one of the largest on the French Atlantic coast.

===Exterior===
The [[facade|façade]] was carved in 1857 in a neo-Gothic style. Outside, in front of the central pillar of the large gate, stands a statue of the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] monk [[Vincent Ferrer|St. Vincent Ferrer]], from [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]]. His activities in the 15th century greatly influenced [[Christianity]] in Vannes. The northern façade opens onto the garden of the [[cloister]] (ruins from the 16th century) and the ''Rue des chanoines'' ("Street of the Canons") through the beautiful portal at the top of the north [[transept]], built in a [[Flamboyant]] late Gothic style (1514), and decorated with twelve niches designed to house statues of the twelve apostles. The cross, visible close to the northern façade, dates back to the 15th century and was brought from the [[cemetery]].

===Interior===
[[File:VannesChoir.jpg|thumb|left|The nave with the altar and statues of St. Peter and St. Paul (December 2006)]]
[[File:Bretagne Morbihan Vannes4 tango7174.jpg|thumb|left|The main altar]]

During the [[Middle Ages]], the floor of the cathedral had been covered by [[tombstone]]s. For hygienic reasons, only the tradition of burying the [[bishop]]s in their episcopal church has been preserved. However, some tombstones have been returned and can be seen today. The cathedral has only retained [[tomb]]s dating back to the 17th century. Two bishops' tombs can be found in the [[crypt]] under the choir.

The building contains the following features:
*''Chapel of the Ancient Baptismal Fonts'' (pos. 1 ground plan): this chapel is too small for actual [[baptism|baptizing]] to take place, but carries the spirit of baptism. The feeling is further enhanced by the [[stained glass]] window, displaying motifs of baptism.
*''St. Anne's Chapel'' (pos. 2): [[Saint Anne]] is the patron saint of Brittany. Here, as in [[Nantes Cathedral]], she enjoys special attention, especially with her statue. The stained glass window shows the [[pilgrimage]] of Saint [[Anne d'Auray]], other important events of her life, and one of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Blessed Virgin]].
*''Chapel of the Rosary of the Saints Hearts'' (pos. 3): the stained glass window is one of the first showing the Sacred Heart of [[Paray-le-Monial|Paray]]. It is related to the window above the choir.
*''Chapel of the Blessed Pierre René Roque'' (pos. 4): Blessed [[Pierre René Roque]] (1758-1796) [http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=375] was a [[priest]], born in Vannes, known for his strong devotion to religion. He was condemned to death and [[guillotine]]d for bringing [[Eucharist|communion]] to a dying man; he was beatified in 1934. He is buried under the altar.

[[File:Bretagne Morbihan Vannes8 tango7174.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Chapel of St. Mériadec and St. Patern]]

*''St. Gwenaël's Chapel'', south entrance (pos. 5): [[Saint Gwenaël]][http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=3615] took part in the [[evangelism|evangelization]] of the [[List of Ancien Régime dioceses of France|West Diocese]] in the 6th century. In the stained glass window he is represented in the company of Blessed [[Françoise d'Amboise]], [[Peter II, Duke of Brittany|duchess of Brittany]] and the founder of the first [[convent]] of the [[Carmelites]] in Vannes.
*''The Liturgical Choir'': the three [[Davide Antonio Fossati|Fossati]] altars date back to the 18th century. The statues of [[Simon Peter|Saints Peter]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] are placed above the two small altars.
*''Our Lady of Lourdes' Chapel'', south [[transept]] (pos. 6): this is the place of the old door of the [[Dukes of Brittany]]. The stained glass window shows the [[First Communion]] of Françoise d'Amboise. Above the window is Saint Peter, to the left a painting of the ascent of [[Saint Petronilla]] [http://www.stpetschurch.org/patroness.htm] [http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=1034] to Heaven. Before the [[French Revolution]], this was the site of the tomb of St. Gwenaël. To the right of the altar Mme. Francheville is buried, a local mystic.
*''Ambulatory'' (pos. 7): the [[ambulatory]] is very large to accommodate the [[pilgrim]]s  that used to pray at the tomb of St. Vincent Ferrer in the Middle Ages. A marble tablet indicates the affiliation of the cathedral to [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in [[Rome]]. The cathedral in Vannes also carries the title of Basilica.
*''The Treasury'' (pos. 8): this room was constructed in about 1782 in a part of the Romanesque choir. The walls are covered with beautiful woodwork and panelling. The shelves contain books on [[theology]] and religious history. The most remarkable item is a box made of wood and covered with painted [[parchment]] of southern origin. It dates back to the 12th century and is decorated with scenes of daily life. Among the other notable objects of the treasury are a gold cross and two ivory sticks&lt;!--?candlesticks?--&gt;.
[[File:VannesStAnn.jpg|thumb|left|Saint Anne's Chapel in Vannes Cathedral (December 2006)]]
*''Portal of the Canons'', north transept (pos. 13): [[Vincent Ferrer|St. Vincent Ferrer]]'s tomb was located here until 1956. There is still a stained glass window depicting him. There are also two paintings, one by Gosse (1945) and one by Mauzaise (1831). The former shows the death of the saint and the latter depicts him preaching to [[infidel]]s. This is the place where baptism is currently celebrated.
*''Our Lady of Mercy Chapel'' (pos. 14): here there is a painting of the [[Virgin and child]] by Delaval (1836). There is also a stained glass window showing [[Ivo of Kermartin|Saint Yves]]. He enjoys a special position in all Breton churches, as a patron saint of the Breton [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|Rector]]s, and also as the main defender of the independence of the Breton churches against the royal power.
*''St. Vincent Ferrer's Chapel'' (pos. 15): this was formerly the chapel of the [[Holy Sacrament]], but since 1956 it has housed the [[relic]]s of Saint Vincent Ferrer, including his [[human skull|skull]].
*''St. Anthony's Chapel'', north entrance (pos. 16): here there is a painting by Vincent from 1830 depicting [[Jesus Christ]] on the Cross, [[John the Apostle|Saint John]], the Holy Virgin and Saint [[Mary Magdalene]].
*''Chapel of St. Mériadec and St. Patern'' (pos. 18): the stained glass window here represents [[Saint Meriadec]] [http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=5092] and [[Saint Patern]], the first [[Bishop of Vannes]]. There are also paintings, one by Rivoulon from 1846, "Litanies of the Holy Virgin", and one by Destouches from 1819 of the [[Resurrection]] of Saint [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]].
*''Romanesque tower'' (pos. 19): this is the only structure left from the Romanesque cathedral. It accommodates the four bells of the church.

Positions 9, 10, 11, 13 and 17 are the Blessed Sacrament Chapel (closed to visitors), the Chapel of Our Lady ''de Pitié'', the Chapel in the [[apse]], the [[Calvary]] and the Chapel of St. Louis respectively.

==In literature==
In the novels of [[Alexandre Dumas, père|Alexandre Dumas]], the [[musketeer]] [[Aramis]] appears at one point as Bishop of Vannes and logically must have served in this very cathedral.

==Burials==
*[[Isabella of Scotland, Duchess of Brittany]]
* St. [[Vincent Ferrer]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3329">'''Wired for Books''' was an online educational project of the [[Ohio University|WOUB]] Center for Public Media at [[Ohio University]] in [[Athens, Ohio]]. Created and produced by David Kurz, and launched on May 25, 1997, the website featured author interviews, dramatic audio productions of classic literature, poetry readings, short stories, lectures, essays, and children's literature.{{cn|date=June 2014}}

Nearly 700 uncut audio author interviews conducted by Don Swaim for his ''Book Beat'' show on [[CBS Radio]] were available at Wired for Books in their entirety. Original unabridged audio productions of ''[http://www.wiredforbooks.org/alice/ Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]'', ''[http://www.wiredforbooks.org/carol/content.htm A Christmas Carol]'', ''[http://www.wiredforbooks.org/macbeth/ Macbeth]'', and ''[http://www.wiredforbooks.org/oz/ The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]'' could be found at Wired for Books in [[RealAudio|streaming media]] as well as some downloadable [[MP3]] files. Essayists, fiction writers, and poets read their works, often with commentary. Kids' Corner, the children's section of Wired for Books, featured the stories of [[Beatrix Potter]] and other classic stories for children.

==Reception==
In 1999, the website was awarded the Streamers WebSage Award from RealNetworks for the best educational use of streaming media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ohiou.edu/about/new/wfbaward.html |title= "Wired for Books" Wins Streaming Media Award" |website= [[Ohio University]] |accessdate=2007-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2004, Education World rated Wired for Books an A+.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.education-world.com/awards/2004/r0504-24.shtml|title= Site Review: Wired for Books|website= [[Education World]] |accessdate=2007-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Wired for Books was chosen by the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] as one of the best online sites for education in the humanities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://edsitement.neh.gov/spotlight.asp?id=103 |author= EDSITEment’s |title=2005-2006 'Best of the Humanities on the Web' |website= [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] |accessdate=2007-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eTech Ohio presented the 2006 Program of the Year Award to Wired for Books as part of the Ohio Public Broadcasting Awards for Radio.{{cn|date=July 2014}}

On November 20, 2007, Wired for Books was featured in ''[[PC Magazine]]''{{'}}s "Best of the Internet" column.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1759,2211446,00.asp|title= Best of the Internet |work= [[PC Magazine]] |accessdate=2007-11-20 |date=2007-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, due to changes in staffing and resources for the management of wiredforbooks.org, the Don Swaim files were provided to Alden Library at Ohio University (where the original master tapes are held) - and the website went dark.  The URL has been picked up by another organization.

'''École des beaux-arts de Montréal''' (The School of Fine Arts in Montreal; '''EBAM''') was an educational institution founded in Quebec in 1922. The [[Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society]] was instrumental in its creation. Its former Sherbrooke Street building now houses the [[Office québécois de la langue française]].

Faculty of the school include [[Edwin Holgate]] as well as Academy Award-winning animator and painter [[Frédéric Back]], who taught there briefly prior to joining [[Radio-Canada]].&lt;ref name=Hustak&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/film/montrealer-frederic-back-won-oscars-for-animated-films/article16507201/#dashboard/follows/|title=Montrealer Frédéric Back won Oscars for animated films|last=Hustak|first=Alan|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|publisher=26 January 2014|accessdate=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building was completed in 1922 as the '''Commercial &amp; Technical High School,''' designed by Montreal architect Jean-Omer Marchand, and is located at 3450 [[Saint Urbain Street]] (at [[Sherbrooke Street]]) in Montreal.&lt;ref name="fiche"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patrimoine.ville.montreal.qc.ca/inventaire/fiche_bat.php?affichage=fiche&amp;civique=125&amp;voie=181&amp;est_ouest=Ouest&amp;appellation=&amp;arrondissement=0&amp;protection=0&amp;batiment=oui&amp;zone=oui&amp;lignes=25&amp;type_requete=simple&amp;id_bat=9941-20-1711-01&amp;debut=0|title=FICHE DU BÂTIMENT|work=Grand répertoire du patrimoine bâti de Montréal|publisher=[[City of Montreal]]|accessdate=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, the school was incorporated into the Family of the Arts of the [[Université du Québec à Montréal|University of Quebec at Montreal]].
