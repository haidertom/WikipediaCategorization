'''''A Thatch-Roofed House with a Water Mill''''', also known as '''''Water Mill near a Farm''''', is a 17th-century [[oil painting|oil]] on panel painting by the [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch Golden Age painter]] [[Jacob van Ruisdael]]. It is in the collection of the [[Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen]] in Rotterdam.{{sfn|Slive|2001|p=140}}&lt;ref name="Boymans"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collectie.boijmans.nl/en/collection/2520-(ok)|publisher=Boymans van Beuningen|title=Water mill near a farm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English painter [[John Constable]] saw the painting in 1826 and wrote "It haunts my mind and clings to my heart".{{sfn|Slive|2001|p=141}}

The painting is catalogue number 121 in [[Seymour Slive]]'s 2001 catalogue raisonné of Ruisdael.{{sfn|Slive|2001|p=140}} The painting is number 165 in the 1911 catalogue raisonné by art historian [[Hofstede de Groot]], {{sfn|Hofstede de Groot|1911|p=81}} and number 2025 in the museum's catalogue. Its dimensions are 36 cm x 42 cm. It is monogrammed in the lower left.{{sfn|Slive|2001|p=140}} It is not dated, but Slive writes it is dateable to about 1653. The monogram uses two different hues to give a three dimensional effect, a technique Ruisdael applied in a few other paintings that were actually dated 1652 and 1653.{{sfn|Slive|2001|p=141}} Museum Boymans van Beuningen dates it circa 1660.&lt;ref name="Boymans"/&gt;

It was restored in 1997.{{sfn|Slive|2001|p=140}}

'''''Aaron, Son of the Devil''''' is the name given to an [[anti-Semitic]] [[caricature]] of an [[England|English]] [[Jew]] appearing on an [[Essex]] county document dated 1277. The document concerns [[fine (penalty)|fine]]s imposed on some Jews and [[Christian]]s who had pursued a [[Deer|doe]] after it had escaped from [[hound]]s near the city of [[Colchester]], an offence against the [[Royal forest#Forest law|forest law]]s of the time.

[[File:Angelique Rockas as Miss Julie and Garry Cooper as Jean.jpg|thumb|Rockas as Miss Julie, and [[Garry Cooper]] as Jean in Strindberg's ''[[Miss Julie]]'', Internationalist Theatre]]
'''Angelique Rockas''' (born in Boksburg, South Africa) is an actress, producer and activist, most notable for introducing London to its first multi-racial and multi-national theatre productions in the 1980s. Rockas founded [[Internationalist Theatre]] in the UK with patron [[Athol Fugard]]. The theater featured multi-racial casts in classical plays, breaking racial barriers that were once accepted norms for theatrical performances.

==Early life==
Rockas was born and raised in Boksburg, South Africa to Greek parents who had emigrated from Greece with hopes of finding a better life. She had three siblings, followed Orthodox Christian traditions, and was taught to honor her Greek cultural heritage.&lt;ref name="Greek Reporter Europe 2012"&gt;{{cite web | title=Angelique Rockas: Strong, Bold and Unafraid | website=Greek Reporter Europe | date=2012-05-21 | url=https://eu.greekreporter.com/2012/05/21/angelique-rockas-strong-bold-and-unafraid/ | access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; She received her early education at [[St Dominic's Catholic School for Girls, Boksburg]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesouthafrican.com/angelique-rockas-bold-theatre-pioneer/|title=Angelique Rockas: bold theatre pioneer|date=10 August 2011|editor= Heather Walker|work=The South African}}&lt;/ref&gt;and later earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] honours degree in English literature with a major in philosophy at the [[University of the Witwatersrand]]. After earning her degree, Rockas went on to complete an acting course at the Drama School of the [[University of Cape Town]] under the direction of Robert Mohr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esat.sun.ac.za/index.php/Robert_Mohr|title=Robert Mohr|author=University of Stellenbosch|via=esat.sun.ac.za}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/DieEffekVanGammaStraleProgramme |title=Programme of Die Effek van Gamma Strale directed by Robert Mohr, Reza De Wet in cast|author=Little Theatre, Univ of Cape Town|year=1976|work=Die Effek van Gamma Strale|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

A young activist, Rockas appeared on the June 1970 front page of the ''[[The Star (South Africa)|Star]]'' with a group of debutantes raising funds for Saheti School, a Greek school located in [[Germiston, South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/AngeliqueAsASahetiDebutantOnTheStarFrontPage1970|title=Debutantes for SAHETI|date=5 June 1970|work=The Star|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also participated in a 25 March [[Greek War of Independence]] Poetry Celebration with [[George Bizos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p03js1g3|title=BBC World Service Interview Archive:George Bizos|date=29 July 2003|via=BBC World Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bizos nicknamed her “l’enfant terrible” for her resistance to the status quo,&lt;ref name="The South African 2011"&gt;{{cite web | title=Angelique Rockas: bold theatre pioneer | website=The South African | date=2011-08-10 | url=https://www.thesouthafrican.com/angelique-rockas-bold-theatre-pioneer/ | access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became her role model leading up to her founding of the Internationalist Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hellenism.net/interview_angelique-rockas.html|title=Angelique Rockas|author=Evangelos Kordakis|work=''hellenism.net''}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Her activities as an anti-apartheid and feminist activist in “the then underdeveloped and extremely conservative” South Africa eventually motivated her move to the UK.&lt;ref name="Greek Reporter Europe 2012"/&gt;  While residing in North London, she worked for Theatro Technis, a Greek Cypriot theatre company that focused on sociopolitical issues affecting [[Greek Cypriots]]. She was also a participant in promoting Greek tragedies and comedies to London audiences.&lt;ref name="Greek Reporter Europe 2012"/&gt;

==Acting career==
In London, Rockas began acting under the direction of [[George Eugeniou]] at Theatro Technis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Angelique Rockas a Theatreo Technis Prometheus|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/abstract?site=ehost&amp;scope=site&amp;jrnl=08248621&amp;AN=52410713&amp;h=D4pQVSHa%2blft3Fkw0PfL0P6VsqS5LzgL3rJ0zFn6HFeAqgqGTLhjLJEzqMvoOl2cN5%2fokwT3iEkKRUTPN9UnqA%3d%3d&amp;crl=c&amp;resultLocal=ErrCrlNoResults&amp;resultNs=Ehost&amp;crlhashurl=login.aspx%3fdirect%3dtrue%26profile%3dehost%26scope%3dsite%26authtype%3dcrawler%26jrnl%3d08248621%26AN%3d52410713|author=Petsalas,Anastassios|series=Etudes Helleniques Vol 16 Issue 2-page 107|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; where she participated in Greek classical productions.

==Internationalist Theatre ==
{{Main| Internationalist Theatre}}
[[File:Angeline Rockas as Miriam (In the Bar of a Tokyo Hotel).jpg|thumb|upright|Rockas as Miriam, ''In the Bar of a Tokyo Hotel'']]
In April 1981, Rockas founded [[Internationalist Theatre]] to create a multi-racial and multi-national theatre company for actors living in London of any racial or national background, of any accent, performing drama classics as well as contemporary works not especially written for multi-racial and multi-national casts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/BBCLatinAmericanReview2 |title=BBC Latin American The Camp Multi Racial And Multi National |year=1981|work=Griselda Gambaro The Camp |author=Ann Morey |via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/BBCLatinAmericanReview1 |title=BBC Latin American The Camp Multi Racial And Multi National|author=Ann Morey|date=26 October 1981|work=BBC Latin American Service page 2|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first announced on 9 April 1981 in the Theatre News, page (2), by the editor of ''[[The Stage]]'', describing the company's formation "to assert a multi-racial drama policy",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/search/results?basicsearch=second%20show%20by%20genet%20the%20stage%20april%201981&amp;retrievecountrycounts=false|title= British Newspaper Archive Screenshot The Stage Second show by Genet multi-racial No 3 |series=The Stage|date=9 April 1981|work=britishnewspaperarchive.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; with their performance of the revival of ''[[The Balcony]]'' by [[Jean Genet]].

Internationalist Theatre staged productions by dramatists including Pirandello, Genet, and Tennessee Williams who belong to "the continental, non-realistic, symbolically orientated drama of this century (20th) and..proved most uncongenial to the tunnel visioned repertoire builders" of British theatre of that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://archive.org/details/Liola_review_guardian_de_jong_28_july_1982_Internationalist_theatre |title=LIOLA |author=Nicolas de Jongh |date= 28 July 1982|work=The Guardian |via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11186">'''Associated American Artists''' ('''AAA''') was an [[Art museum|art gallery]] [[New York City|in New York City that was established in 1934 and]] [[New York City|ceased operation in 2000.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Art for Every Home: Associated American Artists 1934-2000|last=Seaton, ed.|first=Elizabeth G.|last2=Myers, ed.|first2=Jane|last3=Windisch, ed.|first3=Gail|publisher=Marianna Kistler Beach Museum of Art, Kansas State University|year=2015|isbn=978-0-300-21579-3|location=Manhattan, Kansas|pages=11|nopp=|oclc=910009711}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The gallery marketed art to the [[middle class|middle and upper-middle class]]es, first in the form of affordable prints and later in home furnishings and accessories, and played a significant role in the growth of art as an industry.

==Beginnings==
Associated American Artists was begun by [[Reeves Lewenthal]].  Lewenthal's first job was as a reporter for the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' but he quickly expanded into artists' agent, working as a publicist for British artist [[Douglas Chandor]].  By the 1930s Lewenthal had a clientele of 35 groups including the [[National Academy of Design]] and the [[Beaux-Arts Institute of Design]].  Realizing the limited possibilities in selling high-priced art to high-class dealers, and the correspondingly huge potential in marketing affordable art to the much larger middle classes, he left his [[public relations]] work to try his hand at this new business model.

[[Lithography|Print]]s being relatively cheap to produce, Lewenthal decided to focus on that medium.  Before the 1930s, fine-art prints were usually [[special edition|limited edition]]s which sold for $10–$50.  During the [[Great Depression]] the [[Federal Art Project]] had resulted in hundreds of thousands of prints, but these were distributed free (mostly to schools) thus the artists made no profits from print sales. Lewenthal's idea was to combine quality, affordability, and profit.  In 1934 he met with several well-known American artists, including [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]], and proposed hiring them to produce lithographs which he would then sell to middle-class buyers for $5 apiece plus $2 per frame, paying the artist $200 per [[edition (printmaking)|edition]].  At the same time, [[corporation]]s began hiring famous artists to work on [[advertising campaign]]s – [[Dole Pineapple]], for example, hired artist [[Georgia O'Keeffe]] to "create pictorial links between pineapple juice and tropical romance".&lt;ref&gt;Doss, Erika.  "Catering to Consumerism: Associated American Artists and the Marketing of Modern Art, 1934-1958." ''Winterthur Portfolio,'' Vol. 26, No. 2/3. (Summer - Autumn, 1991), p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;  This convergence of art, business, and consumerism was the perfect environment for Lewenthal's new Associated American Artists enterprise.

When Lewenthal [[commission (remuneration)|commission]]ed his first lithographs in 1934, the American economy was still limping towards recovery from the Depression; high-priced art was an impossible [[Luxury good|luxury]] for most people and the old galleries that had always supported artists were finding it difficult to broker their work. AAA was thus "an agent of economic salvation" for numerous American artists including [[Peggy Bacon]], [[Aaron Bohrod]], [[John Steuart Curry]], [[Luigi Lucioni]], and [[Grant Wood]], despite the fact that signing with AAA usually meant being fired from their higher-end gallery.

:''I knew the regionalists were popular because their names were in the art magazines all the time.  But they weren't popular enough, and they weren't making any money.  Why, when I first went to Tom Benton's New York apartment he was living in utter squalor.  I more or less rescued him.''&lt;ref&gt;Doss, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

By the fall of 1934 Lewenthal had contracts with fifty department stores to carry his "signed originals by America's great artists." &lt;ref&gt;Doss, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

==Populist appeal==
Lewenthal marketed his prints as educational resources, as a [[patriotism|patriotic]] choice, and as "art for the people" rather than "art for the wealthy."  In January 1935 AAA issued its first mail-order print catalogue; mail-order print sales will continue for the next forty-nine years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Art for Every Home: Associated American Artists 1934-2000|last=Seaton, ed.|first=Elizabeth G.|last2=Myers, ed.|first2=Jane|last3=Windisch, ed.|first3=Gail|publisher=Marianna Kistler Museum of Art, Kansas State University|year=2015|isbn=978-0-300-21579-3|location=Manhattan, Kansas|pages=15|oclc=909251636}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also placed advertisements in magazines such as ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and ''[[Reader's Digest]]'', and by promoting print collecting in terms of upward mobility—in the same way as buying Listerine ("The Dentifrice of the Rich," according to one ad campaign&lt;ref&gt;Doss, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;), owning modern art raised one's life socially. AAA's success led them to open a 30,000-square-foot gallery at 711 Fifth Avenue in 1939 where they featured paintings and sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Art for Every Home: Associated American Artists 1934-2000|last=Seaton, ed.|first=Elizabeth G.|last2=Myers, ed.|first2=Jane|last3=Windisch, ed.|first3=Gail|publisher=Marianna Kistler Beach Museum of Art, Kansas State University|year=2015|isbn=978-0-300-21579-3|location=Manhattan, Kansas|pages=15|oclc=909251636}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, AAA had 107 artists under contract and sold 62,374 lithographs, for a net income of $1 million per month.

In addition to its mainstream marketing strategy, AAA chose art and artists with [[populism|populist]] appeal.  [[Representationalism|Representational]] and [[Regionalism (art)|regional]] art made up the bulk of their lines; particularly popular were the works of Benton, Curry and Wood.  These artists avoided gritty realism and created positive images of an idealized, strong, capable America, a viewpoint which accorded well with the political environment of the [[New Deal]] and was in some senses [[therapy|therapeutic]] for the anxiety and weakness pervasive during and just after the Depression.  Typical of this was Benton's ''Plowing It Under'', released shortly after the federal government arranged the plowing under of millions of acres previously devoted to cotton production in order to increase farm revenue; Benton's work reassured the public that the government was working in the best interests of the people.&lt;ref&gt;Doss, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercialization of art==
The Regionalists by and large were in favor of businesses and advertising using their works, believing that fine art could raise the consciousness of business.  They did not fully realize how art figured into corporate [[brand management|branding]] and advertising in the minds of corporate planners, or consider that their art might be used to inspire confidence in a product.  They were soon to learn. Benton's original works for R.J. Reynolds' [[Lucky Strikes]], for example, showed black [[sharecropper]]s at work, but corporate headquarters were not interested in "Negroes doing what looked like old-time slave work."  They demanded pictures that showed not realism but idealism, leading Benton to complain that "Every time a patron dictates to an artist what is to be done, he doesn't get any art, he just gets a poor commercial job."&lt;ref&gt;Doss, pp. 158-159&lt;/ref&gt;  Increasingly, rather than deal with AAA and its artists, companies built in-house [[art department]]s that could produce art in the Regionalist style.  This appropriation of the regionalist/representational style culminated in the [[Propaganda in the United States#Government propaganda|propaganda posters of World War II]].

==Post-WWII==
The increasing association of regionalist and representational art with commercialism and advertising (and in some eyes, with [[fascism]]) contributed to its decreasing popularity and to the rise of [[abstract art|abstract]] and [[surrealism|surrealist]] art after World War II.  When AAA opened galleries in [[Chicago]] and [[Beverly Hills]], it stocked them with modern works by American and—a first for AAA—European artists.  (When Lewenthal offered [[Jackson Pollock]] an art-for-business commission like those he had offered his artists in 1934, Pollock turned him down.)  In its [[press release]]s and articles AAA talked about exploring "new frontiers," "new trends" --  and made no mention of the $5 mail-order line and the artists who had helped it succeed twenty years earlier.  Thomas Hart Benton resigned from AAA in 1946.

AAA continued to find new ways to sell art, however, branching out into [[Stonelain]] porcelain, fabric, and housewares such as ashtrays, playing cards, and lamp shades as vehicles for work in abstract and other modern styles.  By the mid-1950s, Lewenthal was quoted as saying, "Today's artist is a designer, not an [[Ivory Tower]] tenant.  His is a field of practical creativity and every American room can become a showcase for his genius.".&lt;ref&gt;Article in ''[[House &amp; Garden (magazine)|House &amp; Garden]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  Now, rather than bringing modern art to the masses, AAA was bringing mass consumer commodities into the world of art.

AAA was a victim of its own success in some ways.  Having been so successful, it was adopted as a model by other companies that began to compete with AAA—marketing fabric, for example, as "etching by the yard" or commissioning artists to do designs for lines of china or wallpaper.  [[Steubenville China]] marketed its "American Modern" line of place settings as "art translated into dinnerware." &lt;ref&gt;Doss, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1958 Lewenthal took over management of Rust Craft Greeting Cards, handling all AAA's decorative arts lines, while [[Sylvan Cole]] took responsibility for the New York gallery and the fine art market.

In a strange reversal of its "market to the masses" philosophy, many early AAA prints which sold originally for $5 go to [[art collector]]s for thousands of dollars today.

The '''Church of St. Dunat''' ({{lang-hr|Crkva svetog Dunata}}) is a Roman Catholic church located on the island of [[Krk]], [[Croatia]].

==Location==
Church of St. Dunat was built at the intersection of roads leading to [[Punat]], [[Krk]], [[Kornić]] and [[Vrbnik]] where the Bay of Punat is most encased in the land, that is, at the bottom of Bay of Punat, by the sea.

==The significance, dating and form==
With the churches in [[Nin, Croatia|Nin]] and [[Zadar]], this one is the most important monument of early Croatian architecture. It cannot be determined with certainty when was it constructed. According to some, it was built in the 9th century. However, the information board near the church says that it was built in the 12th century.

Church has a four-leafed cruciform layout, square entrance and base with a dome covering it. Present-day appearance is undoubtedly significantly different from the previous, when it was covered with carved stone from the outside, which can still be seen only at the bottom. It was probably  decorated with mosaics and frescoes from the inside. It seems as if the unskilled master built it entirely spontaneously with no accurate measures and models.

==First mention==
Church was first mentioned in year 1565 when the Bishop Petar Bembo visited the area, and had examined witnesses which stated that the church was donated by bishop Donat a Turre (1484-1515) to the owners of terrains around [[Kornić]]. After his death, they have sold terrains which was followed by the period of edifices deterioration. During the visit of bishop Donat, a poor condition of church was determined. It was mentioned that it didn't have floor nor the door, while only preserved was altar.

==Dedication==
Church is dedicated to St. Dunat (not to be mistaken with [[Donatus of Zadar]]), an early Christian saint who was martyred during the persecution of emperor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian the Apostate]] in the second half of the 4th century. It is not known whom it was originally dedicated to.

==History of deterioration and renovation==
In addition to previously mentioned churches poor state, there is no other information about it so it can be assumed that it wasn't used for holding Holy Mass but was in the process of deterioration over the years. Church was restored in 1914 thanks to the Austrian conservator Anton Gnirs from [[Pula]]. However, immediately after World War II it was again damaged. Namely, in the immediate vicinity of the church was an inn of Maračić family where [[Yugoslav Partisans]] stored their weapons and ammunition during the war. On 3 October 1945 the explosion that badly damaged church, namely its dome, occurred. The explosion was so strong that it was heard all over the island. 15 islanders who have sought refuge in the surrounding fields and along the coast were killed while the area of the inn turned into a crater. Three years later, the church was restored to its present-day appearance. The renovation was led by the architect {{ill|Aleksandar Freudenreich|hr}}. At the site of the former inn was built anotherone while a small harbor was built nearby.

'''Concert production''' is the act of putting on a [[concert]] or a live music performance.  As an individual's role, this refers to the person coordinating all the staff and equipment necessary to make a concert happen; they monitor the schedule, pay the staff, act as a hub for communication between team members, and generally make sure the event runs smoothly.  The role of a '''concert producer''' or '''concert promoter''' is best filled by a person with good organizational skills, a [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]] demeanor, and plenty of charisma.  As a company's role, concert production may also include the responsibility of [[Talent agency|booking]] the musicians, [[marketing]] the concert, and the financial loss or gain of the event. Over the last 10 years, the number of independent concert producers in the United States has diminished greatly due to acquisition of smaller firms by large national companies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2318">'''Copenhagen Free University''' ('''CFU''', {{lang-da|Det Fri Universitet i København}}) is an artist-run [[Council communism|communist collective]] established in May 2001 in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]], although it is not an accredited institution of higher learning. It considers itself as part of the international [[Situationist International|Situationist]] movement in collaboration with other like-minded organizations.

The CFU committee comprises artists Henrietta Heise and Jakob Jakobsen, its founders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=We are All Normal (and We Want Our Freedom)|pages=357|author=Katya Sander and Simon Sheikh|year=2001|publisher=Black Dog Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AK&gt;{{cite book|title=Realizing the Impossible: Art Against Authority|pages=150|author=Josh MacPhee and Erik Reuland|year=2007|publisher=AK Press|isbn=1-904859-32-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CFU has a guide called ''The ABZ of the Copenhagen Free University'' with entries ranging from "self-institution" through "uneconomical behaviour" to "mass intellectuality".  It publishes small books and brochures, as well as hosting discussions, conferences, and screenings.  One of its publications is a research paper called ''The Rise and Fall of the Situationists'', documenting the influence of the [[Situationist International]] in Denmark.&lt;ref name=AK /&gt;

The CFU also helps to run an artist-run television service named '''TV-TV''', broadcast from a squat in Copenhagen (named ''Folkets Hus'' &amp;mdash; People's House) three nights per week in airtime slots that used to be occupied by TV STop, using TV Stop's equipment.  TV-TV's content is usually experimental, and its stated aim is to not be like mainstream television.&lt;ref name=AK /&gt;

The '''Cultural Office of Cluny''', often named '''OCC''' (renamed Cultural Office of Cluny - National Federation of Total Animation [OCC - FNAG] in 1978) is a [[Catholic]]-related association registered as a [[voluntary association]], created in France by Olivier Fenoy in 1963. It is a group of cultural animation composed of a theater company whose activities include arts, cultural travels, photographs, among other things. Although primarily located in France, the OCC has several centers in Québec and Chile.&lt;ref name="BULLES"&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[UNADFI]] |title=Heurs et malheurs de l'Office Culturel de Cluny |url=http://www.prevensectes.com/occ1.htm |journal=BULLES |publisher=''Prevensectes'' |language=French |year=1993 |accessdate=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group was widely referred to as a [[cult]] in the media, particularly after the publication of the first parliamentary report in which it was mentioned.

==History and organization==
Strongly influenced by a text of [[Pius XII]] sent to artists in 1952, then by [[Marthe Robin]],&lt;ref name="Communautés"&gt;{{cite book |title=Les communautés nouvelles — Nouveaux visages du catholicisme français |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OuErLMi_VTQC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=office+culturel+de+cluny#v=onepage&amp;q=office%20culturel%20de%20cluny&amp;f=false |last=Landron |first=Olivier |publisher=Cerf |place=Paris |year=2004 |language=French |isbn=2-204-07305-9 |pages=118–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fenoy created and the OCC and devolepped it alongside Grégoire Molle. The name comes from a café in the Quartier Latin, "Le Petit Cluny", where the founders organized their first meetings, and therefore has no connection with the [[Abbey of Cluny]]. In 1973, "the community of Cluny" or "missionaries of hope" was created by hundreds of people who wanted to permanently live this lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Jean |last1=Vernette |first2=Claire |last2=Moncelon |chapter=Office culturel de Cluny (OCC) |url=http://pagesperso-orange.fr/sos.derivesectaire/FICHES/office_culturel_de_cluny.htm |title=Dictionnaire des groupes religieux aujourd'hui (religions - églises - sectes - nouveaux mouvements religieux - mouvements spiritualistes) |publisher=''SOS Dérives sectaires'' |language=French |year=1995 |accessdate=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charter accompanying the association's statutes requires to members celibacy and chastity. Postulants, novices and engaged must give their goods to the community.&lt;ref name="Mafia"&gt;{{cite book |first=Bruno |last=Fouchereau |title=La mafia des sectes — Du rapport de l'Assemblée Nationale aux implications des multinationales |publisher=Filipacchi editions |year=1996 |pages=96–103 |language=French |isbn=2-85018-648-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first artistic creation of the group was "Un Caprice" by [[Alfred de Musset]].&lt;ref name="Communautés"/&gt; Students centers were quickly created. The OCC has acutellement about ten centers throughout France ([[Palis]], [[Entrevaux]], Château de Machy, Center Le Brûlaire, etc...). It publishes a quarterly magazine named ''Le Courrier: Nouvelles de Cluny''.&lt;ref name="BULLES"/&gt;

In 1972, the [[Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports (France)|Secretary of State for Youth and Sports]] granted to the OCC a provisional approval as organization of popular education. This approval was withdrawn in 1982, then reinstated by the State Council in 1990.&lt;ref name="Communautés2"&gt;{{cite book |title=Les communautés nouvelles — Nouveaux visages du catholicisme français |last=Landron |first=Olivier |publisher=Cerf |place=Paris |year=2004 |language=French |isbn=2-204-07305-9 |pages=428–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The OCC was listed as a [[cult]] in the 1995 and 1999 parliamentary reports and considered as a "pseudo-Catholic" and a "medium-sized cult" in terms of wealth (its annual budget reached between 5 and 20 million francs at the time). The commission accused the OCC to infiltrate the world of childhood by the formula of courses and seminars in the field of leisure but also academic support and cultural development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rapport fait au nom de la Commission d'enquête sur les sectes — ''Les sectes en France'' |url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/rap-enq/r2468.asp |publisher=''Assemblée Nationale'' |language=French |year=1995 |accessdate=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rapport fait au nom de la Commission d'enquête sur les sectes - ''Les sectes et l'argent'' |url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/dossiers/sectes/r1687anx.asp |publisher=''Assemblée Nationale'' |language=French |year=1999 |accessdate=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-cult association [[ADFI]] criticized the OCC for its methods of seduction, its particular lifestyle (reduced sleep, long prayers, inability to be alone, etc.), possible families breakdowns, its hierarchical structure,&lt;ref name="BULLES"/&gt; psychological pressures and despoilment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Sandrine |last=Plana |title=Le prosélytisme religieux à l'épreuve du droit privé |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DuqSUGVqfGsC&amp;pg=PA328&amp;dq=office+culturel+de+cluny+sectes+dans+la+france&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |language=French |page=328 |year=2006 |accessdate=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former members claimed to have been "seduced by promises of social advancement" in the group, then to have been "totally ruined after their stay at the centers in Claux and Le Machy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Roland |last=Huckel |title=Étude technologique de la manipulation mentale, pratiquée dans les sectes contestées |url=http://www.anti-scientologie.ch/huckel-stratagemes.htm#SUBREPTICEMENT |work=Bouée |publisher=''Anti-scientologie'' |language=French |date=May 1991 |accessdate=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OCC rules were described as "binding and totalitarian".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Cyril |last=Le Tallec |title=Les sectes politiques: 1965-1995 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OZdEEsi-3_oC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;dq=office+culturel+de+cluny&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=office%20culturel%20de%20cluny&amp;f=false |language=French |page=109 |year=2006 |accessdate=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For their part, Bishop of Troyes Gérard Daucourt, as well as Bishops Montagrin, Pontier and [[Jean Vernette]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jacques |last=Trouslard |title=Quelques réflexions relatives à l'article du journal ''La Croix'' sur les sectes |url=http://www.psyvig.com/default_page.php?menu=12&amp;page=6 |publisher=''Psychothérapie Vigilance'' |language=French |year=2005 |accessdate=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; criticized the classification of cult attributed to the OCC and wrote a protest letter to [[Philippe Séguin]], arguing that this caused some harm to the OCC as well as to the Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=André-Hubert |last=Mesnard |chapter=L'Office culturel de Cluny et le rapport |title=Pour en finir avec les sectes — Le débat sur le rapport de la commission parlementaire |publisher=CESNUR — Di Giovanni |year=1997 |pages=327–34 |language=French |isbn=88-85237-11-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jean-Pierre |last=Chantin |title=Des "sectes" dans la France contemporaine: 1905-2000, contestations ou innovations religieuses? |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OoLXAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=office+culturel+de+cluny&amp;dq=office+culturel+de+cluny&amp;lr= |language=French |page=127 |year=2004 |accessdate=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; For André-Hubert Mesnard, the classification made by the Parliamentary Commission was not democratic because the list could not be changed after its publication and thus the groups incriminated, including the OCC, could not defend themselves against criticisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jean-Pierre |last=Bayard |title=Guide sur les sectes et les sociétés secrètes |publisher=Philippe Lebaud editions |year=2004 |page=345 |language=French |isbn=2-84898-039-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CESNUR]] stated that the group was "nearly bankrupted due to the refusal of public theatres to air its shows", after its cult designation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Massimo |last=Introvigne |title=Religious Liberty in Western Europe |url=http://www.cesnur.org/testi/Washington.htm |publisher=CESNUR |date=1 December 1997 |accessdate=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judicial cases==
The OCC launched numerous lawsuits or was sued in many cases throughout its history.&lt;ref name="BULLES"/&gt; The first ones were in 1980: the OCC was sued on material issues in [[Digne]] and [[Aix-en-Provence]]. On these occasions, Fenoy's brother, former followers, parents' members, and a [[priest]] from Lyon provided negative testimonies about the association.&lt;ref name="Communautés2"/&gt;

Later, on 4 June 1998, the court of Angers, then on 4 November 1999, the Court of Appeal of Angers dismissed the OCC which said that its leaders were lay monks and therefore not under the [[social security]] regulations, and tried to challenge the tax recovery imposed by URSSAF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[UNADFI]] |title=Les moines laïques condamnés  |url=http://www.prevensectes.com/rev9912.htm#31c |journal=BULLES |publisher=''Prevensectes'' |language=French |year=1999 |accessdate=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a lawsuit filed by a former member in Grenoble, it was revealed that Fenoy had homosexual intercourses and that he "kept members in a high material and spiritual dependency". In 1988, the OCC filed a complaint for defamation against the President of the association "L'Alouette" for issuing a leaflet warning against cults in which the OCC was cited, but was dismissed.&lt;ref name="Mafia"/&gt;

The [[General councils (France)|General Councils]] of several French départements, including Rhône and Aube, and the Grenoble city hall gave important subsidies, which raised much criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Quand l'Europe finance une secte |url=http://www.prevensectes.com/rev9808.htm#16 |journal=[[L'Express (France)|L'Express]] |publisher=''Prevensectes'' |language=French |date=6 August 1998 |accessdate=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cyprien Tokoudagba''' (1939 - 5 May 2012) was a sculptor from [[Abomey]], Benin.&lt;ref&gt;Palace Sculptures of Abomey: History Told on Walls Francesca Piqué, Leslie H. Rainer - 1999 - Page 108 "Cyprien Tokoudagba with several of his sculptures, which depict various deities and other folk figures. His art has been exhibited at the Pompidou Center in Paris.

Birgit Haehnel, Melanie Ulz - 2010 -- Page 230 "The choice of Cyprien Tokoudagba to create them speaks for itself. Cyprien Tokoudagba is as contemporary Beninese artist whose works of art are in the Pigozzi Collection as well as in many other cultural institutions around the world."&lt;/ref&gt;

He started to work as a restorer for the Abomey Museum in 1987, when he was hired to replicate the original [[bas-relief]]s that told many of Dahomey's legends and stories while celebrating the individual kings  for the new King Glelé royal palace façade, among the [[Royal Palaces of Abomey]] reconstructed by the government of Benin.

Tokoudagba continued the tradition of bas-relief though the use of cement and commercially available synthetic paint, while also producing works on canvas, frescoes and monumental sculptures. In 1989, Cyprien left Benin for the first time to exhibit at “Magiciens de la Terre” in Paris, France.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}
Tokoudagba's work was exhibited at the "Ouidah '92" festival, which celebrated [[Vodun art]] from Benin and the African Diaspora in [[Ouidah]], Benin in February 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|page=33 |last=Rush|first=Dana |title=Contemporary Vodun Arts of Ouidah, Benin|journal=African Arts|volume=34|issue=4  |date=Winter 2001|publisher=UCLA James S. Coleman African Studies Center|jstor=3337805 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
His works have also been exhibited in the following museums: Smithsonian institution - [[National Museum of African Art]], Washington, DC; [[Musée Dapper]], Paris, France; [[Museum Kunst Palast]], Düsseldorf, Germany; [[Hayward Gallery]], London, Englands; [[Centre Georges Pompidou]], Paris, France; [[Mori Art Museum]], Tokyo, Japan; São Paulo Biennale, Brasil.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2241">'''Descriptive poetics''' is an analytic approach within [[literary studies]]. While the concept of ''[[poetics]]'' goes back to [[Aristotle]], the term descriptive poetics refers to an approach which, according to [[Brian McHale]], represents a middle ground between theoretically oriented approaches and analyses of individual [[Creative works|works]] of [[literature]].

==Overview==
To McHale, the purpose of descriptive poetics is to give exhaustive accounts of different kinds of objects which can be a group of texts, the [[wikt:oeuvre|entire production]] of a single [[author]], a particular [[literary genre|genre]], the [[writing style|style]] of a period in [[literary history]] or even specific styles of [[literature]]. McHale argues that the approach is not defined by what it examines but by the level of ''generalization'' achieved in this form of literary studies.&lt;ref&gt;McHale, Brian (1994) "Whatever Happened to Descriptive Poetics?", ''The Point of Theory: Practices of Cultural Analysis'' (red. [[Mieke Bal]] &amp; Inga E. Bour). Amsterdam:  Amsterdam University Press, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; The approach was given a formalized forum in the journal ''PTL: A Journal of Descriptive Poetics and Theory of Literature'' which only had a short run before it was succeeded by the more successful journal ''[[Poetics Today]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Mintz, Alan (1984) "On the Tel Aviv School of Poetics" i ''[[Prooftexts]]'', Vol. 4, No. 3&lt;/ref&gt; According to literary scholar Uni Margolin, descriptive poetics was a rather prominent form of scholarship in the first half of the 20th century, especially in Germany, but has since "been neglected since 1968 because of its low level of theoretisation".&lt;ref&gt;Margolin, Uni (2007) "[http://www.jltonline.de/index.php/articles/rt/printerFriendly/58/244 Response]" i ''[[Journal of Literary Theory]]'', Vol 1, No 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Dieudonné initially achieved success working with comedian [[Élie Semoun]], humorously exploiting racial stereotypes. He campaigned against [[racism]] and was a candidate in the 1997 and 2001 legislative elections in [[Dreux]] against the [[National Front (France)|National Front]], the French far-right political party that he perceived as racist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/who-is-dieudonn-how-the-french-comedian-was-thrust-into-the-spotlight-by-nicolas-anelkas-quenelle-goal-celebration-9030721.html|title=Who is Dieudonné?

Some critics argued that he had "crossed the limits of [[antisemitism]]" and several organizations sued him for incitement to racial hatred. Dieudonné refused to apologize and denounced [[Zionism]] and the "[[Jewish lobby]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leparisien.fr/loisirs-et-spectacles/fogiel-consterne-par-dieudonne-03-12-2003-2004583950.php|title=Fogiel " consterné " par Dieudonné|author=|date=2 December 2003|work=leparisien.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Dieudonné M'bala M'bala was born in [[Fontenay-aux-Roses]], [[Hauts-de-Seine]], France.  He is the son of a retired [[sociology|sociologist]] from Brittany, who is also a painter and exhibits under the name Josiane Grué, and an accountant from [[Ekoudendi]], [[Cameroon]].&lt;ref name="NYT2012/06/24"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/24/movies/dieudonne-french-comic-behind-the-anti-semite.html?pagewanted=all| title= A French Jester Who Trades in Hate| author=Maïa de la Baume| work=The New York Times| date= 22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scott Sayare [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/03/world/europe/concern-over-quenelle-gesture-grows-in-france.html "Concern Over an Increasingly Seen Gesture Grows in France"], ''The New York Times'', 2 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; His parents divorced when he was one year old, and he was brought up by his mother.

==Performing career==
After getting his baccalaureate in computer science, Dieudonné began writing and practicing routines with his childhood friend, Jewish comedian and actor [[Élie Semoun]]. They formed a comedic duo, [[Élie and Dieudonné|Élie et Dieudonné]] (Élie and Dieudonné), and performed in local cafés and bars while Dieudonné worked as a salesman, selling cars, telephones, and photocopy machines. In 1992, a Paris comedian spotted them and helped them stage their first professional show.&lt;ref name="NewYorker" /&gt; In the 1990s, they appeared on stage and on television together as "Élie et Dieudonné". In 1997 they split and each went on to a solo theater career. In 1998, they reunited in a screen comedy, ''Le Clone'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0180607/ |title=Le clone (1998) |publisher=IMDb.com |date= |accessdate=10 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was a failure critically and financially. From the mid-1990s Dieudonné appeared in several French film comedies, primarily in supporting roles. His most successful screen appearance to date was in [[Alain Chabat]]'s box-office hit ''[[Asterix &amp; Obelix: Mission Cleopatra]]'' in 2002; in 2004 he appeared in [[Maurice Barthélémy]]'s [[box office bomb]] ''Casablanca Driver''.
 
Dieudonné's successful one-man shows include ''Pardon Judas'' (2000), ''Le divorce de Patrick'' (2003), and ''1905'' (2005). Other one-man shows were ''Mes Excuses'' (2004), ''Dépôt de bilan'' (2006) and ''J'ai fait l'con'' (2008), all understood as attacks on political and social opponents and defences of his own positions. Anti-Semitic statements made within and around these productions led to intense controversy and numerous lawsuits.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051013003803/http://www.communautarisme.net/Dieudonne-rappel-des-principaux-faits-entourant-la-polemique_a348.html ''Dieudonné : rappel des principaux faits entourant la polémique''], Observatoire du communautarisme, 26 February 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[2005 civil unrest in France]], Dieudonné also penned a play called ''Émeutes en banlieue'' (Riots in the Suburbs, February 2006). In 2009, surrounded by scandals (see below, "Political activities"), Dieudonné launched two one-man shows: ''Liberté d’expression'' (''Freedom of expression'')  and ''Sandrine''. While the latter was a follow-up to ''Le divorce de Patrick'', the former was conceived as a series of itinerant "conferences" on "[[free speech]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120718065517/http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/actualites/societe/20090318.OBS9384/dieudonne_donne_une_conference_dans_un_car.

Dieudonné's production company first acted under the name Bonnie Productions and now under the name Les productions de la Plume.

In 2012, Dieudonné made his directorial debut in a film called ''L’Antisémite'' (''The Anti-Semite''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/104436/antisemite-banned-at-cannes?all=1| title=L’Antisémite, Banned at Cannes.

==Théâtre de la Main d'Or==
Dieudonné is the lessee of the ''Théâtre de la Main d'Or'' in the [[11th arrondissement of Paris]], which is used for both stand-up comedy and political events by himself and friends.

==Political activities and views==

===Beginnings===
Dieudonné was initially active on the anti-racist left. In the [[French legislative election, 1997|1997 French legislative election]], he worked with his party, "Les Utopistes", in [[Dreux]] against National Front candidate [[Marie-France Stirbois]] and received 8 percent of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vigile.net/Dieudonne-Bouffon-de-cour ''Dieudonné – Bouffon de cour''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090517074058/http://www.vigile.net/Dieudonne-Bouffon-de-cour |date=17 May 2009 }}, voir.ca (reissued on Vigile.net), 14 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Verbally and in demonstrations, he also supported migrants without a residence permit (the so-called "sans papiers") and the [[Palestinians]].

===2002–2006===
[[File:Dieudonné M’bala M’bala.jpg|thumb|Dieudonné in 2006]]
Since 2002, Dieudonné has attracted attention by making increasingly polemical statements. In an interview for the magazine ''[[Lyon]] Capitale'' in January 2002, he described "the [[Jew]]s" as "a sect, a fraud, which is the worst of all, because it was the first" and said he preferred "the charisma of [[Osama bin Laden|bin Laden]] to that of [[George W. Bush|Bush]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/societe/dieudonne-juge-raciste-en-cassation_462984.html ''Dieudonné jugé raciste en cassation''], ''[[L'Express (France)|L'Express]]'', 25 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently tried to run for president in the [[French presidential election, 2002|2002 presidential election]], but failed to get in the race.

On 1 December 2003, he appeared live on a television show disguised as a parody of an Israeli settler wearing military fatigues and a [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] (Orthodox) Jewish hat. The sketch climaxed with a [[Hitler salute]], after which Dieudonné shouts out a word. According to Dieudonné, he shouted "Israël" in the persona of the Haredi. In the following days, some news agencies stated that he shouted "Isra – Heil" or "Heil Israel".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liberation.fr/portrait/0101478926-la-ou-la-blague-blesse ''Là où la blague blesse''], [[libération]], 20 February 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.24heures.ch/actu/culture/dieudonne-promo-pire-2009-01-06 ''Dieudonné, la promo par le pire''], ''[[24 heures (Switzerland)|24 heures]]'', 7 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He was cleared of charges of antisemitism in a Paris court after the judge said this was not an attack against Jews in general but against a type of person "distinguished by their political views".&lt;ref name = "bbc"&gt;{{cite news | title = French comic 'not anti-Semitic' | publisher = BBC | date = 2004-05-27 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3755013.stm | accessdate =7 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[European Parliament election, 2004 (France)|2004 European Parliament election]], Dieudonné was candidate for the extreme left-wing party "Euro-Palestine", but left a few months after the election because of disagreements with its leaders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europalestine.com/article.php3?id_article=1410 ''Dieudonné sur une pente très glissante''], Euro-Palestine, 29 October 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Dieudonné is the director of the Les Ogres website, where he makes plain his denial of the official version of the [[9/11]] events.

On 16 February 2005, he declared during a press conference in [[Algiers]] that the Central Council of French Jews CRIF (''Conseil représentatif des institutions juives de France'') was a "mafia" that had "total control over French policy exercise", called the commemoration of [[the Holocaust]] "memorial pornography"&lt;ref name="NYT2012/06/24"/&gt; ("''pornographie mémorielle''"), and claimed that the "Zionists of the [[Centre National de la Cinématographie]]," which "control French cinema" prevented him from making a film about the [[slave trade]].&lt;ref name="lefigaro.fr"&gt;[http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2008/06/26/01016-20080626ARTFIG00373-dieudonne-star-de-la-semaine-judiciaire.php ''Dieudonné, star de la semaine judiciaire''], [[Le Figaro]], 26 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aidh.org/antisem/dieud01.htm ''A Alger, l'humoriste qualifie la commémoration de la Shoah de "pornographie mémorielle"''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050406011910/http://aidh.org/antisem/dieud01.htm |date=6 April 2005 }}, aidh.org, February 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Dieudonné was also trying to appear as a spokesman for French blacks, but, after some initial sympathy, notably from the novelist [[Calixthe Beyala]], the journalists [[Antoine Garnier]] and [[Claudy Siar]], as well as the founding members of the ''Conseil représentatif des associations noires'' (CRAN), he increasingly met with their rejection.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Smith, Géraldine Faes: ''Noir et Français!'', Éditions du Panama, April 2006, {{ISBN|2-7557-0106-4}}; [http://www.trend.infopartisan.net/trd0906/t400906.html Bernhard Schmid: Reise nach Beirut.] Trend-online, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In France and abroad, Dieudonné became increasingly perceived as an extremist of a type until then uncommon in Europe: in the introduction to a March 2006 interview, ''[[The Sunday Independent (South Africa)|The Sunday Independent]]'' of [[South Africa]] called him a "French [[Louis Farrakhan]]... obsessed with Jews".&lt;ref name = "ind"&gt;John Lichfield: [http://www.sundayindependent.co.za/index.php?fSectionId=1042&amp;fArticleId=3177751 "French comic's growing anti-Semitism is no joke"], The Sunday Independent, 26 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2007–2009===
Dieudonné wanted to finally represent politically these ever-radicalized positions in the [[French presidential elections, 2007|2007 presidential election]], but for logistical reasons he could not maintain his candidacy, which was organized by Marc Robert (a.k.a. Marc George).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120720023059/http://www.bakchich.info/Un-coup-de-tonnerre-Dieudonne-se,00323.html ''Un coup de tonnerre : Dieudonné se retire de la campagne présidentielle''], Bakchich.info, 11 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The convicted [[holocaust denial|Holocaust denier]] [[Serge Thion]] wrote for his campaign web site under the pseudonym "Serge Noith", as did also the longtime secretary of the Holocaust denier [[Roger Garaudy]], [[Maria Poumier]].

In July 2008, Jean-Marie Le Pen became godfather to Dieudonné's third child. [[Philippe Laguérie]], a [[traditionalist Catholic]] priest, officiated at the baptism, which was held in the Saint-Éloi congregation in [[Bordeaux]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://obsession.nouvelobs.com/people/20080716.OBS3105/le-pen-confirme-etre-parrain-d-un-enfant-de-dieudonne.html Le Pen confirme être parrain d'un enfant de Dieudonné] ''[[Le Nouvel Observateur]]''. 16 July 2008.

On 9 May 2012, Police in Brussels, Belgium, stopped Dieudonné mid-performance after determining that his performance contravened local laws, and forced the cancellation of two more shows, but in November 2013, a Brussels justice found that the comedian was not using anti-Semitic slurs or [[incitement to ethnic or racial hatred|inciting racial hatred]] during the show that was interrupted in May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhnet.be/people-buzz/show-biz/les-charges-pour-antisemitisme-abandonnees-contre-dieudonne-527a834e35703e420f409a15|title=Les charges pour antisémitisme abandonnées contre Dieudonné|author=M.

Dieudonné released a song and dance called "Shoananas", performed to the tune of the 1985 children's video and song by [[Annie Cordy]] "[[Cho Ka Ka O]]" (Chaud Cacao or Hot Chocolate in English),&lt;ref name=slate_6_27_2013&gt;La dieudonnisation des esprits, une (grosse) quenelle qui vient d’en bas [http://www.slate.fr/story/74429/dieudonne-quenelle]&lt;/ref&gt; which itself by today's standards might be considered racist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejpress.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=47547:french-public-radio-takes-legal-action-against-latest-anti-semitic-remarks-by-comedian-dieudonne&amp;catid=2:france&amp;Itemid=3|title=French public radio takes legal action against latest anti-Semitic remarks by comedian Dieudonné|author=Yossi  Lempkowicz|date=|work=ejpress.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "Shoananas" is a [[portmanteau]] of [[Shoah]], the French and Hebrew word used to refer to the Holocaust, and [[ananas]], the French word for [[pineapple]].&lt;ref name=quasi_nazi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/2013/12/23/news-opinion/world/in-france-quasi-nazi-salute-aims-to-evade-long-arm-of-the-law|title=In France, quasi-Nazi salute may evade long arm of the law|author=|date=|work=Jewish Telegraphic Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dieudonné started a trend among his supporters of getting photographed making a unique gesture he invented and dubbed the "[[quenelle (gesture)|quenelle]]". For some it is just a vulgar gesture of opposition to French institutions, for others it is an antisemitic gesture and was dubbed a "reverse Nazi salute" because while a Nazi salute involves an upraised straight arm, the quenelle involves a straight arm pointed at the ground.

In December, while performing onstage, Dieudonné was recorded saying about prominent French Jewish radio journalist Patrick Cohen: "Me, you see, when I hear Patrick Cohen speak, I think to myself: ‘Gas chambers... too bad."’"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20131227-dieudonne-france-famous-french-comic-show-could-be-banned-anti-semitic-content/|title=France may ban French comic’s show for ‘anti-Semitism’|author=|date=|work=France 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radio France, Cohen’s employer, announced on 20 December that it had alerted authorities that Dieudonné had engaged in "openly anti-Semitic speech", and various French anti-racism watchdog groups filed complaints.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

French Interior Minister Manuel Valls announced he would try to legally ban public performances by Dieudonné. Valls stated that Dieudonne was "no longer a comedian" but was rather an "anti-Semite and racist" who has run afoul of France's laws against incitement to racial hatred.

"Despite a conviction for public defamation, hate speech and racial discrimination, Dieudonné M’Bala M’Bala no longer seems to recognize any limits," Valls wrote.

"Consequently, the interior minister has decided to thoroughly examine all legal options that would allow a ban on Dieudonné’s public gatherings, which no longer belong to the artistic domain, but rather amount to a public safety risk."&lt;ref name="france24.com"/&gt;

On 31 December, Dieudonné released a 15-minute video proposing that "2014 will be the year of the quenelle!".&lt;ref name="quenelle-video"&gt;{{YouTube|id=0r4YQ54PazA|title=2014 sera l'année de la quenelle !!! }}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, Dieudonné attacks "bankers" and "slavers", so as not to say "Jews"&lt;ref name="quenelle-video-review"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.numerama.com/magazine/27966-la-34quenelle34-sur-internet-argument-de-valls-pour-interdire-dieudonne.html| title = La "quenelle" sur Internet, argument de Valls pour interdire Dieudonné| accessdate = 7 January 2014| publisher = Numerama| year = 2014| author = Guillaume Champeau| quote = "Attaquant ici "les banquiers", là "les esclavagistes", pour ne pas dire ouvertement "les Juifs" et éviter un procès, Dieudonné entraîne ceux qui l'écoutent et le suivent vers une haine pour les Juifs, dans une vidéo dans laquelle il demande sans transition que 2014 devienne 'l'année de la quenelle'."| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140108055228/http://www.numerama.com/magazine/27966-la-34quenelle34-sur-internet-argument-de-valls-pour-interdire-dieudonne.html| archivedate = 8 January 2014| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and end up in a lawsuit, and calls upon his followers, "quenelleurs"—those who listen and follow him—towards a hatred of Jews.&lt;ref name="quenelle-video-review" /&gt;

"Antisemite? I'm not of that opinion," he says in the video. "I'm not saying I'd never be one... I leave myself open to that possibility, but for the moment, no."

On 6 January, France's interior minister [[Manuel Valls]] said that performances considered anti-Semitic may be banned by local officials.  In support of this, Valls sent a 3-page memo to all prefects of Police in France on 6 January entitled, "The Struggle Against Racism and Antisemitism—demonstrations and public reaction—performances by Mr. Dieudonné M’Bala M’Bala ".  With respect to freedom of speech in France and banning scheduled performances ahead of time, Valls wrote:
"The struggle against racism and antisemitism is an essential concern of government and demands vigorous action."  He takes note of the liberty of expression in France, but goes on to say that in exceptional circumstances, the police are invested with the power to prohibit an event if its intent is to prevent "a grave disturbance of public order" and cites the 1933 law supporting this.&lt;ref name="Valls-circular"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.leparisien.fr/politique/la-circulaire-anti-dieudonne-de-valls-aux-prefets-06-01-2014-3467133.php| title = Voici la circulaire anti-Dieudonné envoyée par Valls aux préfets| accessdate = 7 January 2014| publisher = [[Le Parisien]]| year = 2014| author = Eric Hacquemand| quote = "He poses personally on the tour poster performing the gesture known as 'the quenelle', a gesture for which his production company has registered intellectual property rights at the [[National Industrial Property Institute (France)|National Industrial Property Institute]] (INPI) and that references his Internet publications, without ever having renounced the racist and antisemitic declarations in his publications. And in the exchanges that he has with a portion of the public, his followers, or numerous people known for their antisemitic and extreme ideas, he has declared in a message published on 1 January [2014] on the Internet site Youtube, that he declares 2014 to be "the year of the quenellé.

Some officials from both sides of the political spectrum have reservations about the legal validity of the Valls circular, and believe that cancellations could leave their cities liable for judgments of millions of euros in damages to Dieudonné if he sues and wins, as actually occurred in La Rochelle in 2012.&lt;ref name="valls-validity-questioned"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.leparisien.fr/politique/affaire-dieudonne-nombreux-doutes-sur-la-validite-de-la-circulaire-valls-08-01-2014-3473711.php| title = Dieudonné : des doutes sur la validité de la circulaire Valls| accessdate = 9 January 2014| publisher = [[Le Parisien]]| year = 2014| author = leparisien.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a poll by [[IFOP]] for [[Metronews]] taken on 8–9 January 2014, 71% of the French population had a negative image of Dieudonné while 16% held a positive view. The voters of the National Front were the least negative, with 54% seeing him negatively and 32% positively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ouest-france.fr/dieudonne-71-des-francais-ont-une-mauvaise-opinion-du-polemiste-1841086 Dieudonné. 71% des Français ont une mauvaise opinion du polémiste] ''[[Ouest-France]]''.

On 11 January 2014, he announced he would not perform his show ''Le Mur'' but will replace it with another one, ''Asus Zoa'', that he wrote in three nights and that would talk about "dance and music inspired by ancestral myths".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/societe/dieudonne-abandonne-definitivement-son-spectacle-le-mur_1313206.html Dieudonné abandonne définitivement son spectacle "Le Mur"], L'Express, 11 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In February, Dieudonné was banned from entry in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/10615893/French-comedian-Dieudonne-responds-to-British-ban-with-quenelle-to-Queen.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=French comedian Dieudonne responds to British ban with 'quenelle' to Queen | date=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September, French authorities opened an investigation into Dieudonné on grounds that he condoned terrorism after mocking and showing footage of the killing of U.S. journalist [[James Foley (journalist)|James Foley]]. He described it as "access to civilisation", comparing it to many colonial crimes in Africa, which included killing and dismembering of victims and which were for decades justified by "civilizing Africa".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=French comedian investigated for comments on James Foley killing|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/09/05/uk-france-comedian-idUKKBN0H012K20140905|agency=Reuters|date=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2015===
On 10 January 2015, following the [[Charlie Hebdo shooting|''Charlie Hebdo'' shooting]], the [[Porte de Vincennes siege]] of a kosher supermarket, and the 1,500,000-strong "[[Republican marches|march against hatred]]" in Paris, Dieudonné wrote on Facebook "As far as I am concerned, I feel I am Charlie Coulibaly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=As far as I am concerned, I feel I am Charlie Coulibaly|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/quenelle-comedian-dieudonne-praises-terrorist-killer-as-far-as-i-am-concerned-i-feel-i-am-charlie-coulibaly-9972035.html|website=independent.co.uk|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way he mixed the popular slogan "[[Je suis Charlie]]", used to support the journalists killed at the ''[[Charlie Hebdo]]'' magazine, with a reference to [[Amedy Coulibaly]] who was responsible for the hostage-taking at the kosher supermarket which included the killing of four Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/comedian-arrested-for-comment-on-charlie-hebdo-attacks--.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=76921&amp;NewsCatID=351|title=Comedian arrested for comment on Charlie Hebdo attacks - EUROPE|author=|date=|work=hurriyetdailynews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likening his treatment to that of "Public Enemy No. 1," on January 11 Dieudonné complained about it in an open letter to the Minister of the Interior, [[Bernard Cazeneuve]].&lt;ref name="trib-jan11"&gt;{{cite web |language=French |title=Visé par une enquête pour apologie du terrorisme, Dieudonné répond au parquet |trans-title=Targeted by an Investigation for Justification of Terrorism, Dieudonné Responds to the Prosecutor's Office |author=&lt;!--staff writers, byline credits latribune.fr--&gt; |date=12 January 2015 |website=latribune.fr |publisher= |issn=1760-4869 |url=http://www.latribune.fr/actualites/economie/france/20150112tribbf4e03a24/vise-par-enquete-pour-apologie-du-terrorisme-dieudonne-repond-au-parquet.html |accessdate=2017-05-13 |quote=Depuis un an, je suis traité comme l'ennemi public numéro 1, alors que je ne cherche qu'à faire rire, et à faire rire de la mort, puisque la mort, elle, se rit bien de nous, comme Charlie le sait hélas. ''For a year, I've been treated like Public Enemy No. 1, when all I ever wanted to do was make people laugh, and laugh at death, because Death is sure laughing at us, as Charlie knows only too well, alas.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 January, Dieudonné was arrested in Paris, accused of publicly supporting terrorism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Holly Yan|author2=Salma Abdelaziz|title=Al Qaeda branch claims responsibility for Charlie Hebdo attack|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/01/14/europe/charlie-hebdo-france-attacks/|publisher=CNN|accessdate=14 January 2015|date=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on his earlier Facebook comments where he appeared to support the kosher supermarket gunman Amedy Coulibaly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-30811401|title=Paris attacks: Dieudonne held as France tackles hate speech|author=|date=14 January 2015|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dieudonné's arrest over his "Je suis Charlie Coulibaly" comments sparked discussion over a perceived hypocrisy concerning freedom of speech, contrasting his bans and arrest, with the freedom for ''Charlie Hebdo'' to publish controversial cartoons of [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What's at Stake in Europe's Response to Charlie Hebdo|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/features/2015-01-08/whats-at-stake-in-europes-response-to-charlie-hebdo|website=bloomberg.com|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Defiant Parisians snap up copies of latest Charlie Hebdo issue|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/parisians-line-for-blocks-for-new-charlie-hebdo-authorities-detain-comedian/2015/01/14/5a25ad74-9bc8-11e4-bcfb-059ec7a93ddc_story.html|website=washingtonpost.com|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The quenelle gesture==
{{Main|Quenelle (gesture)}}
[[Quenelle (gesture)|The quenelle]], invented by Dieudonné, is a gesture consisting of a downward straight arm touched at the shoulder by the opposite hand. In French, ''quenelle'' normally refers to a type of [[quenelle|dumpling]]. Images of the quenelle became viral in 2013, with many individuals posing while performing the quenelle in photos posted to the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/reuters-france-may-ban-comedian-for-hate-speech/1818573.html|title=France May Ban Black Comedian for Hate Speech|author=|date=|work=VOA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dieudonné claims that the gesture is an anti-establishment protest. The gesture has also been described as a reverse Nazi salute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2530377/West-Brom-coach-Downing-claims-Anelka-paying-homage-comedian-controversial-celebration.html|title=Anelka 'Nazi' salute storm - striker could face lengthy FA ban for offensive goal celebration - Daily Mail Online|author=|date=28 December 2013|work=Mail Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Officially, French authorities have said the gesture is too vague to take any action against Dieudonné.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/french-use-nazi-like-salute-with-impunity/|title=French use Nazi-like salute with impunity|author=|date=|work=The Times of Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2013, the French Minister for Sport [[Valérie Fourneyron]] publicly criticised the footballer [[Nicolas Anelka]] for using the gesture as a goal celebration in an [[English Premier League]] match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25537686|title=Nicolas Anelka: West Brom striker defends goal celebration|author=|date=|work=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; French international and [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] [[basketball]] player [[Tony Parker]] also came under fire during the same time period for his use of the gesture.&lt;ref name="parker"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/spurs-parker-fire-anti-semitic-quenelle-gesture-article-1.1561092 |title=Spurs guard Tony Parker under fire for 'quenelle' gesture, alleged anti-Semitism |last=Abramson |first=Mitch |date=29 December 2013 |newspaper=[[New York Daily News]] |accessdate=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 December 2013, Parker apologized for making the gesture, saying that the photograph had been taken three years earlier and that he had been unaware at the time that it had any anti-Semitic connotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/10216051/tony-parker-san-antonio-spurs-sorry-controversial-photo|title=Tony Parker of San Antonio Spurs sorry for controversial photo|author=|date=|work=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; An official January 2014 circular issued by Interior Minister [[Manuel Valls]] besides laying out a legal justification for banning antisemitic performances by Dieudonné also specifically linked the quenelle gesture to anti-Semitism and extremism.&lt;ref name="Valls-circular" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12339">'''Document automation''' (also known as '''document assembly''') is the design of systems and [[workflow]]s that assist in the creation of [[electronic document]]s. These include logic-based systems that use segments of pre-existing text and/or data to assemble a new document. This process is increasingly used within certain industries to assemble legal documents, contracts and letters. Document automation systems can also be used to automate all conditional text, variable text, and data contained within a set of documents.

Automation systems allow companies to minimize data entry, reduce the time spent proof-reading, and reduce the risks associated with [[human error]]. Additional benefits include: time and financial savings due to decreased paper handling, document loading, storage, distribution, postage/shipping, faxes, telephone, labor and waste.

== Document assembly ==
The basic functions are to replace the cumbersome manual filling in of repetitive documents with template-based systems where the user answers software-driven interview questions or data entry screen. The information collected then populates the document to form a good first draft'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ijlit.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/15/2/170 Article: Disrupting Conventional Law Firm Business Models using Document Assembly] Mountain, Int J Law Info Tech., 2006; 0: eal019v1&lt;/ref&gt; Today's more advanced document automation systems allow users to create their own data and rules (logic) without the need for programming.

While document automation software is used primarily in the [[law|legal]], [[financial services]], and [[risk management]] industries, it can be used in any industry that creates transaction-based documents.  A good example of how document automation software can be used is with [[commercial mortgage]] documents. A typical commercial mortgage transaction can include several documents including:
* [[promissory note]]
* environmental indemnity
* [[trust deed (real estate)|trust deed]]
* [[mortgage law|mortgage]]
* [[guaranty]]
Some of these documents can contain as many as 80 to 100 pages, with hundreds of optional paragraphs and data elements. Document automation software has the ability to automatically fill in the correct document variables based on the transaction data. In addition, some document automation software has the ability to create a document suite where all related documents are encapsulated into one file, making updates and collaboration easy and fast. Established companies in this field includes the likes of Contract Express from Thomson Reuters

Simpler software applications that are easier to learn can also be used to automate the preparation of documents, without undue complexity. For example, Pathagoras holds itself out as a 'plain text, no fields allowed' document assembly system. Clipboard managers allow the user to save frequently-used text fragments, organize them into logical groups, and then quickly access them to paste into final documents.

== In supply chain management ==
There are many documents used in [[logistics]]. They are called: [[invoice]]s, [[packing list]]s/slips/sheets (manifests), content lists, pick tickets, arrival acknowledgement [[form (document)|form]]s/[[reports]] of many types (e.g. [[MSDS]], damaged goods, returned goods, detailed/summary, etc.), [[import]]/[[export]], [[Delivery (commerce)|delivery]], [[bill of lading]] (BOL), etc. These documents are usually the [[contracts]] between the [[consignee]] and the [[consignor]], so they are very important for both parties and any intermediary, like a [[third party logistics]] company (3PL) and [[governments]]. [[Document]] handling within [[logistics]], [[supply chain management]] and [[distribution center]]s is usually performed [[manual labor]] or semi-automatically using [[bar code scanner]]s, [[software]] and tabletop [[laser printer]]s. There are some [[manufacturer]]s of high speed document automation systems that will automatically compare the laser printed document to the order and either insert or automatically apply an enclosed [[wallet]]/pouch to the [[shipping container]] (usually a flexible [[polybag]] or [[corrugated fiberboard]]/rigid container). See below for external website video links showing these document automation systems. Protection of Privacy and [[Identity Theft]] are major concerns, especially with the increase of [[e-Commerce]], [[Internet]]/[[Online shopping]] and [[Shopping channel]] (other, past references are catalogue and [[mail order]] shopping) making it more important than ever to guarantee the correct document is married or associated to the correct order or shipment every time. Software that produce documents are: [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]], [[Warehouse management system|WMS]], [[Transportation management system|TMS]], legacy [[middleware]] and most accounting packages.{{cn|date=January 2015}}

A number of research projects have looked into wider [[standardization]] and automation of documents in the [[Freight transport|freight industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efreightproject.eu/default.aspx|title=e-FREIGHT is an Integrated project within the EU's 7th Framework programme|publisher=e-Freight|accessdate=23 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120530094924/http://www.efreightproject.eu/default.aspx|archivedate=30 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[IATA]].

== In legal services ==
The role of automation technology in the production of legal documents has been widely recognised. For example, [[Richard Susskind]]’s book ‘The End of Lawyers’ looks at the use of document automation software that enables clients to generate employment contracts and Wills with the use of an online interview or decision tree.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawgazette.co.uk/blogs/in-business-blog/who039s-afraid-computer-generation Article Who's afraid of computer generation?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231175351/http://www.lawgazette.co.uk/blogs/in-business-blog/who039s-afraid-computer-generation |date=2010-12-31 }} Eduardo Reyes (Thursday 28 October 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Susskind regards Document Assembly as one of 10 '[[disruptive technology|disruptive technologies]]' that are altering the face of the legal profession.&lt;ref&gt;The End of Lawyers?: Rethinking the Nature of Legal Services Richard Susskind OBE Oxford University Press, USA (January 15, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; In large law firms document assembly systems are increasingly being used to systemise work, such as complex term sheets and the first drafts of credit agreements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.information-age.com/channels/information-management/features/1307743/part_3/swift-justice.thtml Article: Swift Justice] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713034239/http://www.information-age.com/channels/information-management/features/1307743/part_3/swift-justice.thtml |date=July 13, 2011 }} Pete Swabey (20 December 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legaltechnologyjournal.co.uk/content/view/31/50/ Article: Client services - Distance relationships] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101102162255/http://www.legaltechnologyjournal.co.uk/content/view/31/50/ |date=2010-11-02 }} Marc-Henri Chamay Legal Technology Journal&lt;/ref&gt;

== In insurance ==
Insurance policies and certificates, depending on the type, policy documents can also be hundreds of pages long and include specific information on the insured.  Typically, in the past, these insurance document packets were created by a) typing out free-form letters, b) adding pre-printed brochures c) editing templates and d) customizing graphics with the required information, then manually sorting and inserting all the documents into one packet and mailing them to the insured. The various documents included in one packet could include the following kinds of documents:
* Welcome letter
* Contract
* Certificate
* State-specific policy documents
* Listing of items insured and insurance amounts
* Amendments
* Riders
* ID card
* Company information
* Marketing material (other products)

A lot of work can go into putting one packet together.  In most policy admin systems, the system will generate some kind of policy statement as a starting point but might need to be customized and enhanced with other required materials.

During this period, a number of [[classical language]]s inherited from earlier epochs remain in active use (Chinese, Sanskrit, Latin, Greek, Persian, Hebrew).
The same period also sees the rise of newly written [[vernacular]]s, partly replacing earlier literary languages (e.g. [[Old Hindi]], [[Old French]], Arabic, Germanic, Celtic, Turkic, etc.).
*[[Literary Chinese]] in [[Tang Dynasty|Tang China]]
*[[Classical Sanskrit]] in the [[Middle kingdoms of India]]
*[[Latin]] in [[Western Christianity|Christian Europe]]
*[[Byzantine Greek|Greek]] in the [[Byzantine Empire]]
*[[Middle Persian literature]] of the late [[Sassanid]] period
*[[Tiberian Hebrew]] as written by the [[Masoretes]]
*[[Classical Arabic]] in the [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic Caliphate]]
*[[Classical Armenian]] literature of [[Medieval Armenia]]
*[[Old Georgian]] literature
*[[Old Turkic]] manuscript tradition, from the 8th century
*early [[Japanese literature]], from the 8th century ([[Nara period]])
*early [[Ge'ez literature]]
*early Dravidian ([[Kannada]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], etc.) literature in [[South India]]
*early Celtic manuscript traditions ([[Old Irish]], [[Old Welsh]])
*early Germanic ([[Old High German]], [[Old English]], [[Old Saxon]], [[Old Norse]]) literature, from the 8th century
*[[Old Church Slavonic]], from the 9th century

==Undated==
The bulk of [[Sanskrit literature|literature in Classical Sanskrit]] dates to the Early Medieval period, but in most cases cannot be dated to a specific century.

The vocalized [[Masoretic Text]] of the Hebrew Bible developed during the 7th to 10th centuries.

The Old English ''[[Beowulf]]'' is dated to anywhere between the 8th and early 11th centuries.

__NOTOC__
:''This club should not be confused with the [[La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club]] of New York.''
The '''Experimental Theatre Club''' ('''ETC''') is a student [[dramatic society]] at the [[University of Oxford]], England.&lt;ref name="carpenter85"&gt;{{cite book|  first=Humphrey | last=Carpenter | authorlink=Humphrey Carpenter | title=O.U.D.S.: A Centenary History of the Oxford University Dramatic Society | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | date=1985 | isbn=0-19-21-2241-X | pages=145–6, 151, 164, 183, 184, 189, 193, 194, 201–2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 1936 by [[Nevill Coghill]] as an alternative company to the [[Oxford University Dramatic Society]] ([[OUDS]]), and produces several productions a year.&lt;ref&gt;"Oxford"  The Concise Oxford Companion to the Theatre. Ed. Phyllis Hartnoll and Peter Found. [[Oxford University Press]], 1996. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press. Retrieved 16 June 2007 [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t79.e2302 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

The club has staged the first productions of many new works, including ''[[Epitaph for George Dillon]]'', written by [[John Osborne]] in 1957 and directed by [[Don Taylor (English director and playwright)|Don Taylor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pmb.ox.ac.uk/pdf/record_2003-4.pdf Pembroke College Record]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, 2003—04, page 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

ETC was home to Oxford's student revue company, the Etceteras – by the early 1970s a rather poor relation of the [[Cambridge Footlights]]. Then, in 1975, two figures who would together become major players in TV and film comedy met after answering an advert to join the Etceteras revue-writing team. They were [[Richard Curtis]] and [[Rowan Atkinson]] – a graduate engineering student who made his memorable Oxford debut in a Leapyear Revue at the [[Oxford Playhouse]] on 29 February 1976, directed by Etceteras president, [[Robert Orchard]]. Curtis had already taken his own first bow in another show by the same director, "Allswellthatendsrock!". From 1977 to 1981, Paul Twivy and [[Ian Hislop]] then took over the Etceteras, producing several shows at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe|Edinburgh Festival]] and Oxford Playhouse.

ETC funded the Etceteras' first major revue in years, "After Eights" at the Oxford Playhouse in May 1976, featuring Atkinson, Curtis, Robin Seavill and others, with material written by the cast, director [[Andrew Rissik]], [[John Albery]], Orchard, Iain Moss and other contributors.&lt;ref&gt;''After Eights'' programme, Oxford Playhouse, May 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

''('''Note:''' The Etceteras' brief as part of ETC was to stage regular revues in Oxford, while the show performed at the annual [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] as the Oxford Revue was produced and funded by the separate [[Oxford Theatre Group]] (OTG), which also took several plays to the Fringe. Today's thriving [[Oxford Revue]] company combines both roles.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}})''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5309">'''Furskins''' was a series of plush toy bears in different sizes and guises created by [[Xavier Roberts]] in the 1980s. Furskins are a highly collectible item, yet are not as highly sought by collectors as Robert's most notable creation [[Cabbage Patch Kids]].

==Background==
Created by Xavier Roberts, Furskins were produced by Panosh Place, Roberts’s Original Appalachian Artworks and [[Coleco]] from 1983 to the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.justcollecting.com/miscellania/xavier-roberts-furskins|title=Xavier Roberts Furskins|work=JustCollecting|access-date=2017-07-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Furskins Bear Series==
Each Furskins Bear had its own unique attire, name and character background story in the valley of Moody Hollow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=ghostofthedoll|title=Furskins :: Commercial 1|date=2010-04-26|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUkYRR69pQg&amp;sns=em|accessdate=2017-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bear sizes were styled into two main types, with a novel third. A set of 8 original five-inch posable bears began the series, followed by a second set of 8 five-inch posable bears out of popular demand. A subsequent set of 16 twenty two-inch bears were created as the demand for the toy grew. The Furskins series was rounded out by the addition of 6 small bears.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ghostofthedoll.co.uk/furskins.php|title=Furskins {{!}} Ghost of the Doll|website=www.ghostofthedoll.co.uk|access-date=2017-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four special collectible bears were created for and sold at Wendy's for $1.99 during the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=ghostofthedoll|title=Furskins :: Commercial 2|date=2010-04-26|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zmh6qTY9ASs&amp;sns=em|accessdate=2017-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Additional clothing was available for Furskins, as were playsets, for collectors to own. Playsets included the Moody Hollow Express and Moody Hollow General Store.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ghostofthedoll.co.uk/furskins-playsets.php|title=Furskins :: Playsets {{!}} Ghost of the Doll|website=www.ghostofthedoll.co.uk|access-date=2017-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Furskins Bear Character Names==
Each Furskin hailed from Moody Hollow and had a unique look to match the character's story.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www3.telus.net/public/circ2k5/furskins.html|title=Kendra's Kids|website=www3.telus.net|access-date=2017-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://yello80s.com/80s-toys/girls-toys/dolls/cabbage-patch-kids/furskin-bears/|title=Cabbage Patch Furskin Bears and Koosa Pets {{!}} Yello80s|last=Yello80s|website=yello80s.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some popular Furskins characters were;

[[File:Grevensvaenge Schnabel.jpg|thumb|1779 drawing by Marcus Schnabel]]
The '''Grevensvænge hoard''' is a find of the late [[Nordic Bronze Age]] (roughly dating to between 800 BC and 500 BC), discovered in the late 18th century at Grevensvænge, [[Næstved Municipality]], [[Zealand]], [[Denmark]].
The hoard consisted of seven bronze figurines. Its first mention is in 1779, where it is said to have been found in the ground "a few years ago". After their discovery, they were kept with the pastor at [[Herlufmagle]], Marcus Schnabel.

A drawing of four of the figurines was made in 1779, by Schnabel. The drawing shows two kneeling figures of warriors with [[horned helmet]]s and axes, a leaping acrobat, and a standing woman. Five of these figurines are now lost, while two were bought by the [[Danish National Museum]] in 1823 and 1839. 

Based on comparison with [[petroglyphs]] of the same era (e.g. [[Tanumshede]], Sweden), it is assumed that the figurines were originally part of an ensemble arranged on a ship.

Both the twins motive and the cultic significance of the horned helmets, seems to have persisted into [[pre-Roman Iron Age|early Germanic culture]]. The kneeling warrior figures have been interpreted as the "[[Ashvins]]" type [[divine twins]] of early Indo-European religion, sons of the sky-god, known by the name of [[Alcis (gods)|Alcis]] to Tacitus.

The [[history of literature]] in the [[Modern period]] in Europe begins with the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and the conclusion of the [[Baroque period]] in the 18th century, succeeding the [[Renaissance literature|Renaissance]] and [[Early Modern literature|Early Modern]] periods.

In the classical literary cultures outside of Europe, the Modern period begins later,
in [[Ottoman Turkey]] with the [[Tanzimat]] reforms (1820s),
in [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar Persia]] under [[Nasser al-Din Shah]] (1830s), in India with the end of the [[Mughal era]] and the establishment of the [[British Raj]] (1850s), in Japan with the [[Meiji restoration]] (1860s), and in China with the [[New Culture Movement]] (1910s).

==18th century==
{{Main|18th century literature}}
{{See|Augustan literature|French literature of the 18th century|Early Modern literature}}

The 18th century sees the conclusion of the [[Baroque period]] and the incipient [[Age of Enlightenment]] with authors such as [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Voltaire]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] or [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]]. European cultural influence begins to spread to other continents, notably [[Edo period]] Japan, with notable authors of the period including [[Ueda Akinari]] and [[Santō Kyōden]].
Early [[American literature]] appears towards the end of the century, e.g. with ''[[The Power of Sympathy]]'' by [[William Hill Brown]] (1789). The late 18th century in Germany sees the beginning [[German Romanticism|Romantic]] ([[Novalis]]) and ''[[Sturm und Drang]]'' ([[Goethe]] und [[Schiller]]) movements.

==19th century==
{{Main|19th century literature}}
The 19th century was perhaps the most literary of all centuries, because not only were the forms of [[novel]], [[short story]] and [[Serial (literature)|magazine serial]] all in existence side-by-side with theatre and [[opera]], but since film, radio and television did not yet exist, the popularity of the written word and its direct enactment were at their height.

===The early part of the century===
The [[Romanticism|romantic]] movement was well under way and along with it developed the splintering of fiction writing into [[genre]]s and the rise of [[speculative fiction]]. There was a romantic tendency toward the exploration of [[folklore|folk]] [[tradition]]s and old [[legend]]s. In 1802 [[Sir Walter Scott]] published ''Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border''. [[Amelia Opie]], another romantic, was publishing poetry in the early 19th century and was an active anti-war campaigner. [[Anne Bannerman]] (1765–1829) reworked legends of [[King Arthur]] and [[Merlin (wizard)|Merlin]]. [[William Blake]] worked in words and pictures to share his visions and mysticism. In 1807 [[Thomas Moore]] published ''Irish Melodies''. [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]] produced many influential poems during this period. In 1808 [[Goethe]] published part one of ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]''. In 1810 [[Sir Walter Scott]] published ''[[Lady of the Lake]]''. [[Percy Shelley]] published a [[gothic novel]]: ''[[Zastrozzi]]''. The term ''"Gothic"'' had, by this time, come to mean a desire for a romantic return to the times before the renaissance. [[Percy Shelley]] also published a gothic [[novella]]: ''St. Irvyne'' in 1811.

North Americans who would later produce great literature were being born in the first third of the century. In 1803 the great American poet and essayist [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] was born (May 25) in [[Boston]] and in 1804 [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]. In 1807 [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] and then [[Edgar Allan Poe]] in 1809. [[Phillipe-Ignace Francois Aubert du Gaspe|Phillipe-Ignace François Aubert du Gaspe]], author of the first [[French Canadian]] novel was born in 1814 followed by [[Henry David Thoreau]] in 1817 and [[Herman Melville]] in 1819. Canadian poets [[Octave Crémazie]] and [[James McIntyre (poet)|James McIntyre]] were both born in 1827. In 1830 was the birth of [[Emily Dickinson]] and, just over a third of the way through the century, in 1835 [[Mark Twain|Samuel Clemens]] (Mark Twain) arrived in this world. Before all of them was [[Washington Irving]], said to be the first American "Literary Lion" and mentor to several other American writers. Washington Irving wrote "[[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]]" (a short story contained in his collection ''[[The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent.]]'') while he was living in [[Birmingham]], England and it was first published in 1819.

In 1807, [[Charles Lamb (writer)|Charles]] and [[Mary Lamb]] published ''[[Tales from Shakespeare]]'', a simple retelling of some of Shakespeare's plays in the form of little stories accessible to a child readership.

===The middle of the century===
In the mid-19th century [[magazine]]s publishing short stories and [[Serial (literature)|serial]]s began to be popular. Some of them were more respectable, while others were referred to by the derogatory name of ''[[penny dreadful]]s''. In 1844 [[Alexandre Dumas, père]] published a novel ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'' (''Les Trois Mousquetaires'') and wrote ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'' which was published in installments over the next two years. [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] published ''[[The Luck of Barry Lyndon]]''. In Britain [[Charles Dickens]] published several of his books in installments in magazines: ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]'', followed, in the next few years, by ''[[Oliver Twist]]'' (1837–1839), ''[[Nicholas Nickleby]]'' (1838–1839), ''[[The Old Curiosity Shop]]'' (1840–1841), ''[[Barnaby Rudge]]'' (1841), ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' (1843) and ''[[Martin Chuzzlewit]]'' (1843–1844). In America a version of the penny dreadful became popularly known as a ''[[dime novel]]''. In the dime novels the reputations of [[gunfighter]]s and other [[wild west]] heroes or villains were created or exaggerated. The [[Western fiction|western]] genre came into existence. [[James Fenimore Cooper]] began a series of stories featuring the characters [[Natty Bumppo|Hawkeye]] and [[Chingachgook]]. These stories were not only ''"westerns"'' but also ''historical novels'', the earliest setting being approximately 100 years earlier than the year James Fenimore Cooper was writing it. The series was called the ''[[Leatherstocking Tales]]'' and comprised five volumes: ''[[The Deerslayer]]'' (1841), ''[[The Last of the Mohicans]]'' (1826), ''[[The Pathfinder, or The Inland Sea|The Pathfinder]]''	(1840), ''[[The Pioneers (novel)|The Pioneers]]'' (1823), ''[[The Prairie]]'' (1827).

===The late 19th century===
In 1863 [[Jules Verne]] published ''[[Cinq semaines en ballon]]'' (''[[Five Weeks in a Balloon]]''). (Verne's ''Paris au XXe siècle'' (''Paris in the 20th Century'') was written, but was not published until 1994). ''Voyage au centre de la Terre'' (''[[Journey to the Center of the Earth]]'') came out in 1864 and ''[[De la Terre à la Lune]]'' (''[[From the Earth to the Moon]]'') in 1865. Verne had by then fully established the ''"[[scientific romance]]"'' as a genre. Charles Dickens published ''[[Our Mutual Friend]]'' in installments from 1864 to 1865. Literature by this time was becoming increasingly popular. Well-educated European and North American middle-classes read more than ever before. At the same time authors tended toward plainer language and more broadly understood themes. People read about detectives, ghosts, machines, wonders, adventures, tricky situations, unusual turns of fate and romances. Love stories and grudges, explorations and wars, ideas based on scientific [[positivism]] and ideas based on [[nonsense]] and [[gibberish]] were all being published and enjoyed by a readership which could now be termed ''"the masses"''.

In 1864 [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] died. [[Dostoyevski]] published ''[[Notes from Underground]]'' (or ''Letters from the Underworld''). Dostoyevski's concerns and style were singularly original and allow the reader entry to a claustrophobic interior world of the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]]. It is probably correct to describe Dostoyevski as the first [[Existentialist]] author.

In 1865 [[Lewis Carroll]] published ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', combining social satire with nonsense writing and presenting the two of them in the guise of a children's story. [[Thomas Chandler Haliburton]] died. [[Edith Maude Eaton]] was born.

1866 [[Dostoyevsky]] published ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'', followed by ''[[The Gambler (novel)|The Gambler]]'' (1867). [[Mark Twain]] published ''[[The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County]]''.

Jules Verne published ''Les enfants du Capitaine Grant'' (''[[In Search of the Castaways]]'') 1867–1868 and ''Vingt mille lieues sous les mers'' (''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea]]'') in 1870.

In 1868 [[Dostoyevsky]] published ''[[The Idiot (novel)|The Idiot]]'' dedicated to Ivanov Dumitru.

In 1869 [[Leo Tolstoy]] published ''[[War and Peace]]''. [[Mark Twain]] published ''[[Innocents Abroad]]''. [[Matthew Arnold]] set a cultural agenda in his book ''[[Culture and Anarchy]]''. His views represented one of two polar opposites which would be in struggle against each other for many years to come. The other side of the struggle would be represented by the [[Aestheticism|Aesthetic]], [[Symbolist]] or [[Decadent]] movement. The chief participants in the cultural opposition at this time included, on the so-called ''decadent'' side French poets like [[Jean Moréas]], [[Paul Verlaine]], [[Tristan Corbière]], [[Arthur Rimbaud]], [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Stéphane Mallarmé]] and, in Britain, the [[Irish people|Irish]] writer [[Oscar Wilde]]. On the other side were [[Matthew Arnold]], [[John Ruskin]] and the tendency amongst the arts toward a [[utilitarian]], constructive and educational [[ethic]]. The views of [[Matthew Arnold]] and [[John Ruskin]] inspired the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] and [[William Morris]]. This dispute (''art for art's sake''  versus  ''art for the common good'') would continue throughout the remainder of the 19th century and much of the 20th.

The ''Decadent'' movement was a transitional stage between romanticism and ''modernism''.

In 1870 Charles Dickens died aged 58. Before his death he was working on ''[[The Mystery of Edwin Drood]]'' (published unfinished). [[John McCrae]] was born. [[Hilaire Belloc]] was born (27 July).

In 1872 [[Dostoevsky]] published ''[[The Possessed (novel)|The Possessed]]'' (or ''Demons'' or ''The Devils''). Lewis Carroll published ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]] and what Alice Found There''. [[Samuel Butler (1835-1902)|Samuel Butler]] published ''[[Erewhon]]'', an early [[science fiction]] novel. Jules Verne published ''Le tour du monde en quatre-vingt jours'' (''[[Around the World in Eighty Days (novel)|Around the World in Eighty Days]]'').

===Modernism===
{{Main|Modernist literature}}

====Modernist poetry====
Modernist poetry is a mode of writing characterised by technical innovation in the mode of versification (sometimes referred to as [[free verse]]) and by the dislocation of the 'I' of the poet as a means of subverting the notion of an unproblematic poetic 'self' directly addressing an equally unproblematic ideal reader or audience. In English, it is generally considered to have emerged in the early years of the 20th century.

These two facets of modernist [[poetry]] are intimately connected with each other. The dislocation of the authorial presence is achieved through the application of such techniques as [[collage]], [[found poetry]], [[visual poetry]], the juxtaposition of apparently unconnected materials, etc. In the best examples of modernist writing, these techniques are used not for their own sake but to open up questions in the mind of the reader.

Modernist poetry in English is often viewed as an American phenomenon in origin, with leading exponents including [[Ezra Pound]], [[T.S. Eliot]], [[Marianne Moore]], [[William Carlos Williams]], [[H.D.]], and [[Louis Zukofsky]], but there were a number of important British modernist poets, including [[David Jones (poet)|David Jones]], [[Hugh MacDiarmid]], [[Mina Loy]], and [[Basil Bunting]].

The influence of modernism can be seen in such later poetic groups and movements as the [[Objectivist poets|Objectivists]], the [[Beat generation]], the [[Black Mountain poets]], the [[deep image]] group, the [[Language poets|L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E]] poets and the [[British Poetry Revival]].

====Modernist prose====

The [[Modernist]] form of prose began from the styles of writing popular in the mid-to-late 19th century: The nonsense books of [[Edward Lear]] and [[Lewis Carroll]] were one influence. Another was the dark [[gothic literature|gothic]] brooding of [[Mary Shelley]], [[Bram Stoker]], Edgar Allan Poe and Dostoyevski. These tendencies toward rebellious nonsense and morose introspection were, to some extent, reactions against the science and positivism of the [[Victorian era]] mindset. At the same time, however, science continued to influence writers to adopt a spirit there are three parts of this book like hi and by experimentalism.

In 1902 [[Joseph Conrad]] published ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'', which threw representations of civilised society into sharp contrast with representations of the jungle and played both of them in relation to the human heart and soul.

In the first half of the 20th century writers such as [[Franz Kafka]] and [[James Joyce]] experimented with dislocations of [[conventional wisdom]] in their creations of distorted characters, locations and narrative styles. Literary experiments in form, matching those taking place in modernist painting and sculpture of the same period, challenged the reader to re-examine and [[deconstruction|deconstruct]] preconceptions about the world. [[Bertholt Brecht]] created modernist theatrical productions according to his theory of the [[alienation effect]] which was supposed to make the audience think and feel in new and critical ways by removing comfortable assumptions and not permitting the narrative to appear too much like reality.

===Hypertext fiction===
{{Main|Hypertext fiction}}
Hypertext fiction is a genre of electronic literature, characterized by the use of hypertext links which provide a new context for non-linearity in literature and reader interaction.[1] The reader typically chooses links to move from one node of text to the next, and in this fashion arranges a story from a deeper pool of potential stories. Its spirit can also be seen in interactive fiction.

The term can also be used to describe traditionally-published books in which a nonlinear narrative and interactive narrative is achieved through internal references. James Joyce's Ulysses (1922), Mark Z. Danielewski's House of Leaves (2000), Enrique Jardiel Poncela's La Tournée de Dios (1932), Jorge Luis Borges' The Garden of Forking Paths (1941), Vladimir Nabokov's Pale Fire (1962) and Julio Cortázar's Rayuela (1963; translated as Hopscotch) are early examples predating the word "hypertext", while a common pop-culture example is the Choose Your Own Adventure series in young adult fiction and other similar gamebooks. The Garden of Forking Paths is both a hypertext story and a description of a fictional hypertext work.

'''Jinkiori''' or '''Jingkiori''' is an [[archaeological site]] consisting of [[petroglyphs]] engraved in a big rock called the “Monolith of Jinkiori".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ficha.sigmincetur.mincetur.gob.pe/index.aspx?cod_Ficha=3610|title=PETROGLIFOS DE QEROS|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located in Paucartambo Province, region of Cusco, Peru.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

== Location==
The rock is located near Queros River, two hours walking from the town of Pilcopata.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

== Recent studies==
The petroglyphs that were engraved directly on the monolith have an Amazonian origin. There is also a strange engraving that resembles a key. These petroglyphs can be abstract representations of mythological or cosmological beliefs, made by people that have consumed ayahuasca (yajé). It is possible that the engravers were ancestors of [[Huachipaeri]], an indigenous group that live until now in the Kosnipata valley.

An interesting characteristic of the Monolith is a little basin possibly of artificial origin. There is the possibility that the basin was used as recipient where the corn was stuffed in order to transform it into a typical Amazonian drink called chicha. Another theory is that the little basin could have been used to purify a baby, submerging him inside the basin full of water.

==Sculpture==
The ''Kendall Band'' is an interactive sound sculpture located in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]], in [[Kendall (MBTA station)|Kendall Station]]. The work consists of three interactive instruments that are played using handles located on both the inbound and outbound subway platform walls.&lt;ref name="Cread" /&gt; Each instrument was designed so  that it could be played from either platform of the subway station.  [[Aluminum]], [[steel]], and [[teak]] were all used in the construction of the musical instruments, with the teak being used for the heads of the hammers.&lt;ref name="Arts"&gt;[http://www.cambridgema.gov/cac/public_art_tour/map_11_kendall.html "Arts on the Line: Kendall Square"]. ''[[Cambridge Arts Council]]''. 2002. Accessed May 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The ensemble was created by [[Paul Matisse]], who is the grandson of [[Henri Matisse]] and stepson of [[Marcel Duchamp]].&lt;ref name="Cread" /&gt; Matisse won the commission in 1981 to create a sculpture for Kendall Station,&lt;ref name="Tech" /&gt; as part of an effort to beautify the [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red Line]] and its stations. This effort was known as the "[[Arts on the Line]]" program,&lt;ref name="boston" /&gt; and was "the first program in the nation to put works of art in public transportation systems."&lt;ref name="Globe" /&gt; The work was not installed until 1987 due to station reconstruction.&lt;ref name="Tech" /&gt;

Due to fears of the art work being vandalized, Matisse decided to place the sculpture between the inbound and outbound tracks of the station before even deciding on what to create. He said "It had a [[third rail]] on one side, a third rail on the other side, and I thought it would be safe."&lt;ref name="Tech" /&gt; Matisse is known for other interactive sound sculptures, such as his ''Musical Fence'' (1980), which was originally installed in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], and now is located at the [[DeCordova Museum and Sculpture Park]] in [[Lincoln, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=MusicalFence&gt;{{cite web|title=The Musical Fence|url=http://www.decordova.org/art/sculpture-park/musical-fence|work=DeCordova Sculpture Park and Museum [website]|accessdate=2011-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Pythagoras''===
The ''Pythagoras'' section of the ''Kendall Band'' is named for the [[Greek philosophy|philosopher]], [[mathematician]], and [[scientist]] [[Pythagoras of Samos]], who is best known for the [[Pythagorean theorem]]. The sculpture consists of 16&lt;ref name="Cread" /&gt; {{convert|4|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}}, {{convert|1/4|in|mm|adj=mid|-thick}} [[aluminum]] [[tubular bell]]s, all tuned in the key of [[B minor]]. The longer bells create low pitches, while the shorter bells create higher pitches in the scale. When a handle on the wall of the subway platform is pulled, teak-headed hammers swing back and forth between the bells, striking them and creating the musical notes. Due to asymmetrical slits located at the [[nodal point]]s in the bells, each chime's note plays a slight [[vibrato]].&lt;ref name="Tech" &gt;Moy, Eva. [http://tech.mit.edu/V115/N66/sculp.66n.html "Kendall Sculptures Bring Music, Talk to Strangers"]. ''[[The Tech (newspaper)|The Tech]]''. January 24, 1996. Accessed May 27, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

There are actually two identical, completely separate and independent musical instruments comprising Pythagoras.   One can be operated from a handle located on the inbound subway platform, and the other can be played simultaneously from a handle on the outbound side.  The hammers are not directly coupled to the handles, to prevent them from striking the chimes too violently.  Instead, the handles must be rhythmically moved back and forth at an appropriate frequency, depending on the physical phenomenon of mechanical [[resonance]] to build up enough energy to strike the chimes.  Which chimes are sounded when depends in a complex manner on the recent history of handle movement.  Although the detailed mathematical analysis of motions is quite complex, most visitors quickly and intuitively figure out how to operate the sculpture without any written instructions.

===''Kepler''===
[[File:KendallBandKepler.agr.jpg|thumb|upright|''Kepler'']]
The ''Kepler'' section is named for [[Johannes Kepler]], a 17th-century German [[mathematician]], [[astronomer]] and [[astrologer]]. This instrument features a 125-pound,&lt;ref name="Tech" /&gt; 55-inch,&lt;ref name="Cread" /&gt; metal ring that plays an [[F♯ (musical note)|F♯]] when struck. This note creates a harmonic [[perfect fifth]] with the tones sounded by ''Pythagoras''. The ring plays this note when a handle on either subway platform is manipulated, which in turn ratchets a hammer upward until it falls and strikes the ring.&lt;ref name="Tech" /&gt; After the ring is struck, it will continue to hum for five minutes.&lt;ref name="Arts" /&gt;

===''Galileo''===
The ''Galileo'' instrument is a large metal sheet the size of a barn door,&lt;ref name= "boston" /&gt; and is named for Italian [[physicist]], [[mathematician]], [[astronomer]], and [[philosopher]] [[Galileo Galilei]]. The flat panel of steel works like a [[thunder sheet]]. When a handle on either station platform is moved, the sheet shakes and creates a low rumbling sound, similar to the sound of [[thunder]], or the sound trains make when rolling through the station.&lt;ref name="Tech" /&gt;

==Installation and repairs==
Paul Matisse was the only artist commissioned for the initial "Arts on the Line" program who created an artwork with moving parts. Almost immediately after the ''Kendall Band'' was installed, it broke. The sculpture began to fail so quickly that the Pythagoras instrument stopped working before the other two could even be completely installed.  Matisse later commented that, "You’d probably have to say it was folly of me to press ahead and present them with something that had moving parts...(but)...I figured it was going to be all right."&lt;ref name= "boston" /&gt;

Matisse would post temporary signs in place of the instrument handles on the walls of Kendall Station, whenever repair work was taking place on the ''Kendall Band''.  Responses which were scrawled in the margins by passengers ranged from "If you spent my tax $ on this, then may you DIE SLOWLY!!" to “If you spent tax dollars on this, may you live long + happily."&lt;ref name= "boston" /&gt; Other comments included “Great to do while stoned!", “Thank you for making me forget the horrors of this day", and “Try to get a tapered connection from the first vertical to the second on this side and an oversized second vertical linkage with perhaps an internal shock absorber".&lt;ref name= "boston" /&gt;

Over time, repairs and additions to the sculpture were completed that made the work more resilient. One of the more-important modifications added a set of clutches hidden behind the handles of the instruments, which disengage "when someone yanks too hard or too fast."&lt;ref name= "boston" /&gt;

No repair or upgrade work can be embarked upon until 1:30am each night, which is when the MBTA stops running trains.&lt;ref name="Tech" /&gt;  Matisse himself had to personally repair the sculpture whenever it broke, and  he was not able to find any organization or corporation that was willing to take over the upkeep of the Band. Because of this, Matisse eventually abandoned the work after roughly 20 years of maintenance. He later stated, “I just kept it going, and then at one point I decided that I was just going to have to let it go out on its own... Sort of like one’s kids. The time comes."&lt;ref name= "boston" /&gt;

==Decline into disrepair==
A one-time $10,000 fix was paid for by the MBTA in 2007, but the transit agency then stated that it could not fund any future repairs.  All further repairs made to the sculpture had to be carried out and paid for by Matisse out of his own pocket.  In 2007, when the now 74-year-old Paul Matisse stopped patching up the ''Kendall Band'', the sculpture quickly fell into disrepair. Out of the original six handles, four had been removed, and only Galileo was in a working state.&lt;ref name="Globe"&gt;Daniel, Mac. [http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2007/06/18/this_matisse_seeks_a_patron/?p1=MEWell_Pos3 "This Matisse seeks a patron"]. ''[[The Boston Globe]]''. June 18, 2007. Accessed May 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The only engineering drawings for the ''Kendall Band'' were also lost in a hard-drive crash during this period.&lt;ref name="Globe" /&gt;

==Kendall Band Preservation Society==
In 2010 a group of students at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] were brought together to repair and conserve the ''Kendall Band''. The idea for the group came from Seth G. Parker, a principal at a Massachusetts based energy consulting firm. He got in touch with the head of the Concerts Office in Music and Theater Arts at MIT, Clarise E. Snyder. She in turn contacted Paul Matisse and the MIT Department of Materials Science and Engineering, who recommended that instructor Michael J. Tarkanian be supervisor of the project to repair the sculpture.&lt;ref name="Band"&gt;Hao, Ziwei. [http://tech.mit.edu/V130/N6/kendallbells.html Students band together to save Band]. [[The Tech (newspaper)|The Tech]]. February 19, 2010. Accessed May 27, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

About 20 students were gathered to work on the cataloging and repair of the instruments, with seven of them chosen to actually dismantle the work.&lt;ref name="Band" /&gt; The students dubbed themselves "The Kendall Band Preservation Society".&lt;ref name= "boston" /&gt;

In April 2010, the Kendall Band Preservation Society started dismantling the ''Kendall Band''. [[Richard A. Davey]], general manager of the [[MBTA]], stopped in to speak to the students and wish them luck in repairing the artwork.&lt;ref name= "boston" /&gt; The students taped up signs in the same fashion as Paul Matisse did when he repaired the ''Band'', and comments were again scrawled in the margins.&lt;ref name="Band" /&gt; A student representative of the group said, “I think we will be able to get the instruments functional over the span of a few months, but our longer term goal is to complete [sic] refurbish and document each instrument. That will be a much longer project, on the order of years.”&lt;ref name="Band" /&gt;

{{As of|May 2011}}, ''Pythagoras'' was restored to operation from the inbound platform, while work continued on the other two instruments.&lt;ref name=CambChron&gt;{{cite web|title=Kendall Square T station music installation back in working order|url=http://www.wickedlocal.com/cambridge/features/x916853148/Kendall-Square-T-station-music-installation-back-in-working-order#axzz1LP9ovQbd|work=Wicked Local Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge Chronicle |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928021409/http://www.wickedlocal.com/cambridge/features/x916853148/Kendall-Square-T-station-music-installation-back-in-working-order |archivedate=28 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://archive.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2011/03/27/and_the_band_is_set_to_play_on_after_students_efforts_for_kendall_station/?page=full&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the sculptures have again fallen into disrepair, and are being restored to operation {{asof|2018|02|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name="Zhang"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zhang|first1=Whitney|title=MIT Concourse team restores Kendall T Station’s musical installation |url=https://thetech.com/2018/02/01/restoration-of-kendall-band|accessdate=2018-03-21|work=The Tech|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tarkanian has handed over responsibility for maintenance to Steve Drasco, a physics instructor in the MIT Concourse educational group.&lt;ref name="Zhang" /&gt;

''La técnica cubana'', often abbreviated as ''técnica'', is a form of Cuban contemporary dance that was founded by [[Ramiro Guerra Suarez]] in Cuba in 1959.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Contemporary Dance in Cuba: Tecnica Cubana as Revolutionary Movement|last=John|first=Suki|publisher=McFarland|year=2012|isbn=978-0786449019|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other forms of traditional Cuban dance, ''técnica'' fuses many different dance forms together, such as those from Africa, Europe, and North America. It is a highly expressive and robust dance form, incorporating many quick jumps and undulating movements of the torso and pelvis. ''Técnica'' blends a high amount of movement and expression with a degree of synchronization, producing an athletic, theatrical dance form.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''Técnica'' was founded directly following the [[Cuban Revolution|1959 Cuban Revolution]]. The Revolution was driven by ideas of socialism and a lack of Cuban [[nationalism]], which brought about major change to the political, economical, and social realms of Cuba.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cuba Represent!: Cuban Arts, State Power, and the Making of New Revolutionary Cultures|last=Fernandes|first=Sujatha|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0822338918|location=Durham|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new [[Fidel Castro|Castro]] regime provided funding and government support to expand the arts, and thus técnica, a new revolutionary Cuban dance form was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Music and Revolution: Cultural Change in Socialist Cuba|last=Moore|first=Robin|publisher=University of California Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0520247116|location=Berkeley|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The similar timing of ''técnica''’s birth allowed the dance form to incorporate many revolutionary ideas—boosting Cuban nationalism and providing a sense of national and personal identity for Cubans. ''Técnica'' incorporated this nationalist vision into its dance technique and created a sense of ''cubanidad'', or “Cuban-ness.”

== History ==

=== Origins ===
[[File:TeatroNacional de Cuba.JPG|thumb|Teatro Nacional in Havana Cuba]]
''La técnica cubana'' was founded in Cuba in 1959 and is intimately linked to revolutionary ideals and social activism. The [[Cuban Revolution|Cuban Revolution of 1959]], led by [[Fidel Castro]], transformed the Cuban economy and enacted a series of progressive social reforms in which wealth was redistributed, health care services became free of charge, and racial boundaries were diminished.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Contemporary Cuba Reader: Reinventing the Revolution|last=Brenner|first=Phillip|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|year=2007|isbn=978-0742555075|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuban nationalism was on the rise for the first time since before Spanish control. The revolutionary government employed culture as a way to unite the Cuban population and promote nationalism.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In keeping with this effort to promote Cuban culture, Castro’s new regime fostered expansion of the arts by encouraged the creation of new art forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=Robin|date=2001|title=¿Revolución con Pachanga? Dance Music in Socialist Cuba|jstor=41800169|journal=Canadian Journal of Latin American and Caribbean Studies|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Castro’s government appointed [[Ramiro Guerra]], an accomplished dancer and choreographer, as the director of the [[Department of Modern Dance]], housed within the [[National Theatre of Cuba|Teatro Nacional]] ([[English language|English]]: National Theatre) in the [[Plaza de la Revolución]] in Cuba.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Danza-Contemporanea-cuatro.jpg|left|thumb|276x276px|Dancers from Danza Contemporanea]]
The goal of the department was to create a dance group with original repertory that was rooted in an original Cuban contemporary dance style.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Guerra and his colleagues thus founded a contemporary dance group, ''Conjunto Nacional de Danza Moderna'' ([[English language|English]]: The National Modern Dance Ensemble) with support from the new Castro regime. This group gave ''técnica'' a mandate and a place to grow and develop. Although the group had the benefit of Guerra’s leadership, it was created with influences from a group of people, including [[Martha Graham]], [[José Limón]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/07/arts/dance/what-comes-next-for-cuban-modern-dance.html|title=What Comes Next for Cuban Modern Dance?|last=Seibert|first=Brian|date=May 2016|work=The New York Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This distinguishes ''técnica'' from other modern dance groups, as most other groups originated and were associated with a specific individual. In this way, ''técnica'' naturally reflected the wide range of Cuban movement intelligence, rather than the sole artistic genius of one person. Conjunto Nacional de Danza Moderna was officially established in 1959 and held its first show in 1960 at the Teatro Nacional in Havana.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The financial support of the revolutionary government contributed to great initial success, as the dancers and creators of técnica did not have to rely on outside jobs for income, finance rehearsal space, or commission compositions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ''Técnica'' was created with the social backing of the new regime and aimed to link the power of dance with Cuban national image. As a result, ''técnica'' was a key component of the intellectual socialist production of the new revolutionary Cuba in 1959. Guerra incorporated nationalist ideals of inclusion into his work by combining academic dance elements with popular traditions on the streets, which he then raised to a national level.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This new dance language not only reflected Cuban history and experience, but also provided space to accommodate the rapidly changing culture. Guerra had the dream to bring together groups of dancers from different cultural backgrounds to contribute to the Cuban [[ajiaco]], or stew. His dance company consisted of 12 white and 12 black dancers from both amateur and professional backgrounds of Afro-Cuban dance, nightclub dance, and ballet.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ''La técnica cubana'' constantly transcended the boundaries of dance with respect to behavior, culture, and aesthetic. The group that Guerra founded and led for eleven years is presently known as [[Danza Contemporanea de Cuba]] and is now led by Miguel A. Iglesias Ferrer.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gahl|first=Elizabeth|date=October 2014|title=The Cuban dance construct: A mechanism for creative agency and identity formation|url=|journal=ProQuest|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National Identity ===
One of the critical aspects of the founding of ''la técnica cubana'' was to strengthen national identity and heighten the pride of ''cubanidad'', or ‘Cuban-ness.’ This idea of national identity had its roots in the [[Cuban Revolution]], where one of the major goals was to establish a sense of Cuban nationalism not embraced since the rule by [[Spain]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The revolutionary regime reinvigorated Cuba’s strong dance heritage in order to provide a unifying factor for the Cuban people. Thus, ''la técnica cubana'' was founded to reflect Cuba’s legendary dance heritage and its diverse population, while regaining a symbol of national identity.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essays on Cuban History: Historiography and Research|last=Peréz|first=Louis|publisher=University Press of Florida|year=1995|isbn=978-0813013299|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

State support for dance in Cuba not only created a new technique and style, but also a sense of identity and value for Cuban dancers; contemporary dance was part of a movement toward Cuban creativity and individuality. The artistic expression of ''técnica'' resonated with the Cuban audience. Ramiro Guerra, known as the founder of ''técnica'', created his choreography “in search of a certain ''cubanía'' in his style of dance.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ''La técnica cubana'' played a crucial role in revitalizing Cuba’s vibrant dance community and was a key contributor to the expanding Cuban national sentiment. The national sentiment of Cuba today is still influenced by the original creation of ''técnica'' and its continued growth throughout the years.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Plurality of Influences ==
[[File:Banrarra Afro-Cuban dance troupe, Havana Jan 2014, image by Marjorie Kaufman.jpg|thumb|Bán Rarra, a Cuban rumba dance group, in Havana, Cuba|266x266px]]
''La técnica cubana'' is a hybrid of Afro-Cuban dance traditions, European [[ballet]], [[Cuban rumba|rumba]], [[flamenco]], Cuban nightclub cabaret, and North American dance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The goal in creating ''técnica'' was to establish a distinctly Cuban modern dance form that represented Cuba’s multicultural population.

The major African dance traditions currently in Cuba are derived from four major African groups: [[Efik people|Carabali]], [[Kongo people|Kongo-Angolan]], [[Arará]], and [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; African heritage is characterized by dance rituals and orisha worship. Each [[orisha]], or spirit, has his or her own gestures, footwork and rhythms that correspond to Yoruba legends and beliefs.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Afro-Cuban Religiosity, Revolution, and National Identity|last=Ayorinde|first=Christine|publisher=University Press of Florida|year=2004|isbn=978-0813027555|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distinctive features of Afro-Cuban dance traditions, such as movements of the arms and head and presence of vibrant music, are incorporated within ''la técnica cubana. Técnica'' celebrates the vibrant African heritage and fuses aspects of their dance technique into ''técnica''’s style.

European ballet techniques are also highly prevalent in ''técnica''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; European ballet is characterized by big turns, multiple jumps and precise balance. ''Técnica'' dancers are well known for their high jumps and completion of multiple turns across stage, as so are their balletic counterparts. Ballet also boasts a strong lower body foundation, which is coupled with the African-tradition use of the arms and fused into ''técnica''’s technique. European ballet style is also a key component of the training of ''técnica'' dancers. Ballet, with its international fame, contributes to the style of ''técnica'' alongside Afro-Cuban dance traditions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Flamenco en el Palacio Andaluz, Sevilla, España, 2015-12-06, DD 07.JPG|thumb|Use of the hands in Flamenco dance]]
''Técnica'' also included aspects of rumba, a traditionally Cuban dance that arose as a secular genre of Cuban music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rumba: Dance and Social Change in Contemporary Cuba|last=Daniel|first=Yvonne|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1995|isbn=978-0253209481|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stylistic techniques of the elongated torso and flexed posture in rumba are present in the stance of ''técnica'' dancers: knees are bent and the body is tilted forward from the hips. ''Técnica'' combines the rhythms, chants and posture of rumba and incorporates them into the multifaceted style of ''la técnica cubana''.

Influences from the Spanish-based Flamenco dance can also be seen in ''técnica''. The vibrant use of the arms and hands in the dance technique of técnica is derived from ''floreo'', flourishes of the hand, and ''[[Glossary of ballet|port de bras]]'', arm movement, in Flamenco dance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The dance elements and techniques from these strong dance forms are all reflected or subtly referenced in ''técnica''. ''La técnica cubana'' merges a unique blend of indigenous and external dance forms to create a new modern form that is the heartbeat of Cuban dance.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; It is a hybrid dance form, intertwining many of the dance legacies in Cuba, all while still grounded in the modern, social context of Cuba. ''Técnica'' was created intentionally to reflect the diversity of Cuban culture and to include a plurality of dance influences.

== Dance Technique ==
The dance technique of ''la técnica cubana'' is athletic and powerful, reflective of the multitude of dance influences from Africa, Europe, North America, and Cuba. ''Técnica'' dancers are known to jump higher, undulate faster, and complete more turns than their dancer counterparts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Técnica is demanding and dynamic, producing dancers that move with remarkable ease.

A class in ''la técnica cubana'' begins with a warm up on the center floor and barre exercises.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The dancers alternate between parallel, first position, and second position. The warm up includes stretching of the upper body and hamstrings by extending the torso and arms in various directions. Guerra credits Afro-Cuban folkloric dance for the torso and pelvis movements prevalent in ''técnica''. He states, “The use of the pelvis is highly developed in our dances. Its instinctive for us. And all of the upper torso work is not only like this, but also in torsion.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After the torso and pelvis movements, hip rolls, relevés, drops to plié and neck twists usually follow the warm up, starting on one side and repeating on the other.
[[File:Banrarra Afro-Cuban dance troupe 3, Havana Jan 2014, image by Marjorie Kaufman.jpg|thumb|Expressive nature of Cuban dance|276x276px]]
Although the warm up includes many techniques derived from European ballet, such as [[Glossary of ballet|relevés]], [[Glossary of ballet|pliés]], [[Glossary of ballet|tendus]], and [[Arabesque (ballet position)|arabesques]], the sequences themselves are composed of unparalleled elements. Dancers execute big jumps while traveling across the floor, incorporating turns and extensions. They balance on the balls of their feet, drop their bodies to the floor and leap up in a large split. One main characteristic of ''técnica'' is the large jumps, which range from barrel turns to ''tours en I’air'' to standard leaps.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The final portion of the class includes a cool down that incorporates the rhythms of several orisha images.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The gentle walks are combined with undulating the spine and shaking the rib cage.

Improvisation also plays a large role in the choreographing of ''técnica''. Guerra explains, “improvisation comes from popular dances, and from African tradition. We are very conscious of rhythm; we can do one rhythm with our hands and another with our feet, and this comes in part from flamenco.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

One hallmark of a ''técnica'' class is the use of a musical ensemble.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A mixture of guitarists, drummers, singers, and flute players accompany every class, playing a variety of music types ranging from orisha songs, Afro-Cuban folklore, and country tunes. If the musicians play a familiar folk melody, the dancers join in singing all together. The presence of live music transforms the dance studio and affects the rhythm and kinetics of the dance techniques. After observing a ''técnica'' class at the National School of Dance, Suki John reflects, “the variations in dynamic and speed by the rhythmic complexity of the music affect the feeling of the movement profoundly.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The incorporation of live music is unique to ''técnica'' and links the dance technique to its Cuban heritage.

The dance technique of ''la técnica cubana'' is unique and expressive, and it encompasses a variety of other dance styles. ''Técnica'' is ever changing and the technique continues to evolve on stage where dancers and choreographers alike speak to changing times.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Levenslied''' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]], literally "life song" or "song about life") is a sentimental Dutch-language subgenre of [[popular music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Meyer|first=Gust de|title=Cultuur met een kleine c|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gEeD070ozMQC&amp;pg=PA213|year=2004|publisher=ACCO|language=Dutch|isbn=9789033456626|page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Levenslied'' lyrics can be sweet or bitter, light and sentimental, but also reflective and dark, about subjects such as love, misery and far-away, sunny, exotic holiday places. The darker, more sentimental songs are also known as "smartlap" (literally: "grief cloth"). The levenslied is related to the ''[[chanson]]'' though for a lower-class audience, like the [[Schlager music|schlager]].

A typical levenslied has catchy, simple rhythms and melodies and is built up in [[couplets]] and refrains. Traditional musical instruments in levenslied music are the [[accordion]] and the [[barrel organ]]. Modern levenslied artists also use [[synthesizer]]s and [[guitar]]s.

The songs are usually in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] but also [[English language|English]] or [[Italian language|Italian]].

Two cities in the Netherlands, [[Tilburg]] and [[Nijmegen]], have annual Levenslied festivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.omroepbrabant.nl/?news/250022342/Django+Wagner,+Rene+Schuurmans+en+Corry+Konings+naar+Tilburgs+Festival+van+het+Levenslied.aspx|title=Django Wagner, Rene Schuurmans en Corry Konings naar Tilburgs Festival van het Levenslied|last=Pennings|first=Mattijs|date=1 June 2016|publisher=[[Omroep Brabant]]|language=Dutch|accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gelderlander.nl/gemeenten/kunst-tijdens-dag-van-het-levenslied-1.5938038|title=Kunst tijdens Dag van het Levenslied|date=19 April 2016|work=[[De Gelderlander]]|language=Dutch|accessdate=18 July 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817192141/http://www.gelderlander.nl/gemeenten/kunst-tijdens-dag-van-het-levenslied-1.5938038|archivedate=17 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Lovro and Lilly Matačić Foundation''' was founded in 1987 according to the will of both, with an aim to improve the skill of exceptionally gifted young conductors, in Croatia and abroad.

==About the Foundation==
The Foundation is a non-profit association that is striving to put the donors’ will in action: support and promote artistic development of young and talented conductors in [[Croatia]] and all over the world, as well as to publish and document works that will promote the achievement of the great maestro (''Matačić'' monograph by Eva Sedak, albums with representative interpretations by Matačić, a number of exhibitions in the country and abroad related to Matačić’s life and work). 

The Foundation supports young conductors primarily through grants extended to a number of candidates and through the organization of the large international competition for conductors. The Foundation has offered scholarships or other types of financial assistance to numerous young Croatian conductors at the start of their careers. The supported conductors include Alan Bjelinski, Saša Britvić, Tonči Bilić, Tomislav Fačini, Ivan Repušić, Mladen Tarbuk, Luka Vukšić, etc.

With the Lovro von Matačić International Competition of Young Conductors, the Foundation aims to organize an event of global significance worthy of the artist whose name it shares, and to provide an opportunity for young generations of musicians to achieve international acclaim in accordance with the nature of Lovro von Matačić’s artistic legacy. In this, the Foundation is assisted by the distinguished members of the Foundation Council, including [[Riccardo Muti]], [[Wolfgang Sawallisch]], [[Kent Nagano]], [[Milan Horvat]], [[Igor Kuljerić]]...

Founded by Cuban-born dancer and choreographer [http://www.ballethispanico.org/about/artistic-leadership Eduardo Vilaro], the company steered away from folkloric representations and utilized a variety of dance form styles such as [[Flamenco]], [[Tango (dance)|Tango]] or [[Salsa (dance)|Salsa]] with contemporary dance movement.&lt;ref name=LNDTHT&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harristheaterchicago.org/current/companies/158|title=Luna Negra Dance Theater|accessdate=August 29, 2008|publisher=Harris Theater for Music and Dance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''mount maker''' is responsible for the creation of structures called object mounts used to provide unobtrusive physical support, stability, and security of objects while on display, in storage, or being transported to [[museums]], [[art galleries]], [[libraries]], [[archives]], [[botanical gardens]] or other [[cultural institutions]].  Protection and long-term conservation of the object is a key goal of mount makers.  This is accomplished through careful design, selection of materials and manufacturing process that will not inadvertently harm the object, and a cautious installation process of the object into its place in an exhibit.  Professionals in this field can be employed directly by an institution, be independent contractors, or work as part of larger cultural institution exhibit design firms.

== Responsibilities and duties ==
[[File:Ornamental gold mounts.jpg|thumb|Ornamental gold mounts]]
The primary responsibility of a mount maker is to provide safe and stable structural supports (also called mounts, brackets, or armatures) for a wide variety of cultural materials such as furniture, ceramics, paintings, sculptures, clothing, jewelry, aircraft, and machinery to be placed in storage, transported to another location, or for exhibition.  Providing form and stability alleviates stress placed on an object, "thereby preventing distortions, creasing, and eventual structural damage." &lt;ref name="MRM, 1B"&gt;{{cite book|last =Buck|first =Rebecca A.|last2 =Gilmore|first2 =Jean Allman|title =Museum Registration Methods|place =Washington, D.C.|publisher =The AAM Press, American Association of Museums|year =2010|edition = |page=310| isbn =978-0-8389-1122-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A successful mount will keep objects from moving in the event that an object's exhibit case is bumped or otherwise disturbed in addition to allowing visitors to view and interpret an object in new and unobtrusive ways.  The object should be the subject of the viewer's attention, not the mount; allowing as much visual access as possible.

Mount makers work with two types of mounts; custom mounts and generic mounts.  Custom mounts are specially created to the exact dimensions, weight, and any specific stability or support issues in response to the preservation and conservation of a particular object.  The type and design of each custom mount is also determined by the budget and skill of the mount maker.  In contrast, generic mounts require only rough measurements of the object.  These general or prefabricated shelves, brackets, or stock forms can be purchased from museum or archival supply companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mounts|url=http://www.collectioncare.org/cci/cciexm.html|work=Northern States Conservation Center|publisher=Northern States Conservation Center|accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mount makers collaborate with registrars, exhibit designers, [[curators]], lighting technicians, and installers to develop or select mounts for each object that will be displayed in an exhibit.  Mount makers also work "closely with [[conservators]] to learn the strengths and weaknesses of the objects and to find safe fabrication materials."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]], Washington, D.C.|authorlink=&lt;!—Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|title= National Museum of the American Indian|year=2014|url=http://nmai.si.edu/explore/collections/conservation/|accessdate=February 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some types of materials may include [http://cameo.mfa.org/wiki/Batting batting], [http://cameo.mfa.org/wiki/Cardboard cardboard], corrugated plastic such as [http://cameo.mfa.org/wiki/Coroplast coroplast], [http://cameo.mfa.org/wiki/Felt felt] (polyester or acrylic), Foam Board ([[Foamcore]]), [http://cameo.mfa.org/wiki/Gator-Foam%C2%AE Gator Foam] (Gator Board), [http://cameo.mfa.org/wiki/Muslin muslin], [[Plexiglas]], and some metals such as brass and steel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Materials|url=http://www.paccin.org/content.php?62-Materials|work=Preparation, Art handling, Collections Care Information Network|publisher=PACCIN}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additional materials can include [[aluminum]], [[stainless steel]], acrylic, and [http://cameo.mfa.org/wiki/Resin resin].&lt;ref name="Mountmaking Tools and Materials"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mountmaking Tools and Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/Mountmaking_Tools_and_Materials|work=AIC Wiki|publisher=American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Knowledge, abilities and skills ==
After considering which material is best suited for an object, mount makers then fabricate a mount to the specification of the object using hand-held tools and general shop equipment.  Mount makers must be knowledge about the many different choices for [[soldering]] and [[welding]], [[saws]], [[buffer wheel|buffers]], and [[grinding machine|grinders]] and skilled in their use.  Tools more specific to fabrication of basic mounts include a 10-inch to 1 inch [[Band saw]], either a freestanding or bench top [[drill press]], a 1 inch by 8 inch Disk combination [[sander]], and a vacuum with either a minimum 5 micron filter or a [[HEPA]] filter.&lt;ref name="Mountmaking Tools and Materials"/&gt;

Some mount makers specialize in a specific medium such as metal or plastic.  All should be knowledgeable in artifact handling, have a working understanding of chemistry, physics, mechanics, and be an expert in the area of problem solving and time management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mountmaker Position|url=http://www.museumservices.com/jobs.htm|work=Sanders Museum Services|publisher=Sanders Associates|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mount makers have been described as having the skills of "jewelers, [[welders]], [[fabricators]], [[machinists]], and [[blacksmiths]] - for artwork."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reese|first=Carrie|title=Meet Phillip Brutz – Mount Maker|url=http://www.clevelandart.org/blog/2011/08/29/meet-phillip-brutz-mount-maker|work=The Cleveland Museum of Art Blog|publisher=Cleveland Museum of Art|accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other skills that may be needed include carpentry, metal working, experience with computer aided design programs, painting, and modeling.

== Education, training, experience ==
Mount makers come from a wide range of professional and educational backgrounds.  Individuals seeking to become a mount maker mush have experience in design, fabrication, and a familiarity with handling objects.  Effective communication skills and the ability to work both alone and on a team are also highly desirable.  Mount makers may have Bachelor of Arts (B. A.), a Bachelor of Fine Arts (B. F. A.), or a Bachelor of Science (B. S.) in fine arts, studio art, conservation, design, or industrial arts from an accredited university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The J.

==Professional organizations==
Mount Makers have memberships in a variety of professional organizations such as the Preparation, Art handling, Collections Care Information Network [http://www.paccin.org/content.php (PACCIN)], the International Convention of Exhibition and Fine Art Transporters [http://www.icefat.org/ (ICEFAT)], and the National Association for Museum Exhibitions [http://name-aam.org/about/who-we-are (NAME)] in order to stay current with professional best practices and have access to a broad informational network of colleagues.

A Professional Interest Committee of the [http://www.aam-us.org/ American Alliance of Museums], PACCIN "is dedicated to building a museum industry network of information and resources available for the educational dialogue of professionals interested in the high standards of art and artifact handling.  The area of focus of these standards include packing, crating, shipping, installation, mount making, rigging, exhibition fabrication, educational employment opportunities as well as ongoing industry updates of current technical and material usage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About PACCIN|url=http://www.paccin.org/content.php?15-History-of-PACCIN|work=PACCIN|publisher=Preparation, Art handling, and Collections Care Information Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Convention of Exhibition and Fine Art Transporters hosts "annual conventions where members meet to exchange ideas and establish relationships with associates world wide in the field of packing, shipping and forwarding works of art, artifacts and antiquities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About ICEFAT|url=http://www.icefat.org/about.html|work=ICEFAT - International Convention of Exhibition and Fine Art Transporters|publisher=International Convention of Exhibition and Fine Art Transporters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''New England Conservatory of Music''' ('''NEC''') in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], is the oldest independent [[school of music]] in the United States, and it is widely recognized as one of the country's most distinguished music schools. NEC is especially known for its [[string instrument|strings]], [[piano]], [[woodwinds]], and [[brass]] departments, and its prestigious [[chamber music]] program.&lt;ref name=necold/&gt;

The conservatory, located on [[Huntington Avenue|Huntington Avenue of the Arts]] near [[Boston Symphony Hall]], is home each year to 750 students pursuing undergraduate and graduate studies along with 1400 more in its ''Preparatory School'' as well as the ''School of Continuing Education''. At the collegiate level, NEC offers the [[Bachelor of Music]], [[Master of Music]], and [[Doctor of Musical Arts]], as well as the Undergraduate Diploma, Graduate Diploma, and Artist Diploma. Also offered are five-year joint double-degree programs with [[Harvard University]] and [[Tufts University]].&lt;ref name=prog&gt;{{cite web|url=http://necmusic.edu/apply-nec/degree-programs|title=Programs of Study|work=New England Conservatory|accessdate=March 4, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100220084620/http://necmusic.edu/apply-nec/degree-programs|archivedate=February 20, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NEC is the only music school in the United States designated as a [[National Historic Landmark]] and it is a pending [[Boston Landmark]]. Its primary concert hall, [[Jordan Hall]], hosts approximately 1,000 concerts each year.&lt;ref name=nhlp/&gt;

==Early history==

[[File:Eben Tourjee 001.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.50|Eben Tourjée]]
In June 1853, Eben Tourjée, at the time a nineteen-year-old music teacher from Providence, Rhode Island, made his first attempt to found a music conservatory in Boston, Massachusetts. He met with a group of Boston's most influential musical leaders to discuss a school based on the conservatories of Europe. The group included [[John Sullivan Dwight]], an influential music critic, Dr. J. Baxter Upham, president of the Harvard Musical Association, and [[Oliver Ditson]], a prominent music publisher. The group ultimately rejected Tourjée's plans, arguing that it was a poor idea to open a conservatory amidst the nation's political and economic uncertainty that would lead up to the [[American Civil War]].

Tourjée made his next attempt in December 1866, when he again met with a group of Boston's top musicians and music patrons. Among Upham, Ditson, and Dwight at this meeting were [[Carl Zerrahn]], a popular Boston conductor, and [[Charles Callahan Perkins|Charles Perkins]], a prominent arts patron. In the thirteen-year interim, Tourjee had founded three music schools in Rhode Island, and this time was able to win over his audience. The men agreed to help Tourjee, and The New England Conservatory officially opened on February 18, 1867. It consisted of seven rooms rented above Music Hall off Tremont Street in downtown Boston. In 1870 it moved to the former St. James Hotel in Franklin Square in the South End.

==Campus==
[[File:Huntington Ave Boston.jpg|thumb|left|upright]]
The NEC campus consists of three buildings on both sides of Gainsborough Street, between St. Botolph Street and [[Huntington Avenue]], one block from [[Symphony Hall, Boston|Symphony Hall]]. The Jordan Hall Building, whose main entrance is at 30 Gainsborough Street, is NEC's main building, home to Jordan Hall, Williams Hall, Brown Hall, the Keller Room, the Isabelle Firestone Audio Library, the Performance Library, professor studios/offices, and practice rooms. The second building, at 33 Gainsborough, is the Residence Hall, a coed dormitory which also houses the Harriet M. Spaulding Library and the "Bistro 33" dining center. The St. Botolph Building, at 241 St. Botolph street, contains Pierce Hall, a computer laboratory, the electronic music studio, and the majority of the school's classrooms and administrative offices.

===Jordan Hall===
{{Main article|Jordan Hall}}
[[File:Greater Boston Youth Symphony Orchestra in Jordan Hall.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Greater Boston Youth Symphony Orchestras|Boston Youth Symphony Orchestra]] performing in Jordan Hall.]]
[[Jordan Hall]] is NEC's central performing space. Opened in 1903, Jordan Hall was the gift of New England Conservatory trustee Eben D. Jordan the 2nd, a member of the family that founded the [[Jordan Marsh]] retail stores and himself an amateur musician. In 1901, Jordan donated land for NEC's main building, while also offering to fund a concert hall with a gift of $120,000.

The dedication concert of Jordan Hall, performed by the Boston Symphony Orchestra, took place on October 20, 1903. Newspaper accounts deemed the hall "unequaled the world over," and ''The Boston Globe'' reported that it was "a place of entertainment that European musicians who were present that evening say excels in beauty anything of the kind they ever saw."&lt;ref name=hh/&gt;

A major renovation project was completed in 1995. The renovated hall won the 1996 Massachusetts Historical Commission Preservation Award, the Victorian Society in America's Preservation Commendation, the 1996 Boston Preservation Alliance Award, the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America Award of Merit, and the Illuminating Engineering Society 1996 Lumen Award.

==Academics==
Admission to NEC is based primarily on a competitive live audition. The conservatory offers degrees in orchestral instruments, conducting, piano, jazz studies, contemporary improvisation, opera and voice (performance and pedagogy), composition, music history, and [[music theory]].

The conservatory has served as a training ground for orchestral players to fill the ranks of the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]], much as the [[Curtis Institute]] serves as a training ground for the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]], although composers, pianists, and singers are offered courses of study as well.

===Preparatory School===
New England Conservatory's Preparatory School is an open-enrollment institution for pre-college students. The preparatory school offers music classes and private instruction for young musicians, and fosters over 35 small and large ensembles. Students enrolled in the Preparatory School may participate in the Certificate Program, allowing students to achieve their optimum performance skills, competence in music theory, and a knowledge of the literature that includes choral, orchestral, and chamber music, as well as solo repertoire.

NEC Prep is home to one of the world's leading youth orchestras, the highly selective Youth Philharmonic Orchestra (YPO) as well as the NEC Youth Chorale who have performed for prominent world figures including the Pope at the Vatican in the past years. The Youth Philharmonic Orchestra headed by [[David Loebel]] is arguably the most selective group at the school. The Preparatory School also houses the Massachusetts Youth Wind Ensemble (MYWE), a highly selective touring wind ensemble open to advanced high school woodwind, brass, and percussion players directed by Michael Mucci. The Preparatory Jazz program offers a Jazz Certificate that focuses on ensemble performance, the primary expression of jazz, supported by private lessons and a comprehensive group of courses covering jazz skills. Jazz ensembles range in size from small groups (combos) to the Youth Jazz Orchestra.

===School of Continuing Education===
New England Conservatory's School of Continuing Education allows members of the surrounding community to experience the benefits of New England Conservatory's world class instruction, offering classes, lessons, and ensemble opportunities to musicians of any background. At NEC's School of Continuing Education members can participate in chamber, jazz, and vocal ensembles, an opera studio, an adult chorale, a klezmer band, and a community gospel choir. In addition, NEC's School of Continuing Education offers classes in several fields including music history, music theory, and Alexander technique, many of which are instructed by members of the New England Conservatory college faculty.

==Partnerships==
NEC is co-founder and educational partner of ''[[From the Top]]'', a weekly radio program that celebrates outstanding young classical musicians from the entire country. With its broadcast home in Jordan Hall, the show is now carried by [[National Public Radio]] and is heard on 250 stations throughout the United States.&lt;ref name=ftt/&gt;

The conservatory offers five-year joint double-degree programs with [[Harvard University]] and [[Tufts University]] and cross-registration with Tufts, [[Northeastern University]], and [[Simmons College (Massachusetts)|Simmons College]].&lt;ref name=courses/&gt;

NEC is the founding institution of [[Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia Fraternity]] and [[Kappa Gamma Psi]] Performing Arts Fraternity.

==Nomenclature==
Although the institution is properly known as New England Conservatory, both the National Historic Landmark and the National Register of Historic Places nominations call out "New England Conservatory of Music" as the name of the historic designation.&lt;ref name=nris/&gt;&lt;ref name=nhlnom/&gt; Also, despite the statement on the subject's web site,&lt;ref name=necff/&gt; there is only one listing for each program, which covers the whole main building, including Jordan Hall, and no separate listing for Jordan Hall.&lt;ref name=malist/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="49069">'''New Primitivism''' ([[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]]: Novi primitivizam, Нови примитивизам) was a [[subculture|subcultural]] movement established in [[Sarajevo]], [[Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|SR Bosnia-Herzegovina]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]] in March 1983. It primarily used music, along with subversive comedy on radio and television as its form of expression. Its protagonists and followers called themselves the '''new primitives'''. 

Even though the movement initially encompassed several bands in the city of Sarajevo, including some such as [[Plavi orkestar]] that quickly distanced themselves from it, the movement predominantly functioned as a banner that summarizes and encompasses the work of two rock bands [[Zabranjeno Pušenje]] and [[Elvis J. Kurtović &amp; His Meteors]] as well as ''[[Top lista nadrealista]]'' radio segment that eventually grew into a television sketch show, the discourse of New Primitivism was seen as primarily irreverent and humorous.

The movement officially disbanded sometime in 1987, although the bands and television show continued up until the breakup of Yugoslavia.

==Characteristics==
Basing itself on the spirit of the Bosnian ordinary populace outside of the cultural mainstream, the movement was credited for introducing the jargon of Sarajevo [[mahala]]s (brimming with slang and Turkish [[loanword]]s) into the official Yugoslav public scene. Many of the New Primitivism songs and sketches involve stories of small people — coalminers, petty criminals, street hoodlums, provincial girls, etc. — being placed in unusual and absurd situations. There are comparisons between ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' and the New Primitives' methods, as they share the short sketch form and utilize [[Surreal humour|absurdity]] as means of eliciting laughs from an audience. The embodiment of New Primitivism is a youth who both reads challenging works such as [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]'s ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]'', but also does not mind getting into fistfights. The movement got established as a Sarajevan reaction to the [[New wave music|New wave]] and [[Punk rock|Punk]] movements that were sweeping the alternative music scene in Yugoslavia. Some of the movement's most notable traits were promoting and popularizing Sarajevan street jargon and slang that was not well known outside of Sarajevo, extolling the mentality and culture of the Sarajevan [[Mahala]], depicting local fringe characters such as petty criminals, alcoholics, lesser-known pop cultural figures, blue-collar workers and local streets hoodlums. Because of this, the movement was concidered locally patriotic and an eclectic expression of Sarajevan urban culture.

The movement's protagonists had a specific view of New Primitivism. Perhaps the most prominent of them, [[Nele Karajlić]], explicated it as being "created within clearly defined historical coordinates, both spatially and temporally, at the precise midpoint between the spot where [[Gavrilo Princip]] [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassinated]] Archduke [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]] in June 1914 and the spot where the Olympic flame was [[1984 Winter Olympics|lit]] in February 1984 while temporally, it took place sometime during the period between [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]]'s death in May 1980 and the beginning of the [[Agrokomerc Affair]] in 1987" and seeing it as "resistance to any form of establishment - cultural, social, and political - not just the rock'n'roll one that dominated Sarajevo at the time with so-called 'dinosaur' bands like [[Bijelo Dugme]] and [[Indexi]], which the new primitives held in contempt to a certain extent".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7s1B5rt_1CU Glavni tok];RTV Pink, 1990s&lt;/ref&gt; The movement's dominant method of social and cultural critique was to fully localize the narrative to Sarajevo, and use local urban legends, cultural and social phenomena and living fringe characters as catalysts for painting a wider political picture. In doing so, the movement became both a rigidly local expressional form that gave a platform to the language, culture and myths of the Sarajevan streets, while also breaking out into the wider Yugoslav arena. A major characteristic of the movement was the adoption of pseudonyms by all its leading figures, which tended to be either comical in nature or based on the semantics of nicknames that have always been very prevelent in Sarajevo. The main reason for this was so that none of the members could be ethnically identified. The second reason was to give a platform to the stylization of nicknames that was prominent in Sarajevo - a form of local patriotism and self-mockery. 

The movement's "chief ideologue" [[:sr:Goran Marić (menadžer)|Malkolm Muharem]] referred to New Primitivism simply as "the first Sarajevan bullet to hit its target since Princip assassinated Ferdinand in 1914".

==Origin of the term==
The movement's name — New Primitivism — got introduced as a mock reaction to two early 1980s pop-culture movements: [[New Romanticism]] in the West and [[Neue Slowenische Kunst]] in the Yugoslav constituent republic of [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia|SR Slovenia]]. On one hand, the term New Primitivism was a clear anti-reference to New Romantic, as the Sarajevo lads sought to be anything but romantic and sugarsweet while on the other hand, they also wanted to emphasize the stereotypes encountered in many popular Yugoslav jokes about Bosnians and Slovenians — the former portrayed as raw, unsophisticated, dim-witted, and openhearted, and the latter presented as stiff, cold, serious, distant, and calculated. In the artistic and expressional sense, New Primitivism was a reaction to the [[New wave music|New wave]] and [[Punk rock|Punk]] movements.

==History==
During the late 1970s and early 1980s, a generation of kids from the Sarajevo neighbourhood of [[Koševo (Sarajevo)|Koševo]], all born in the early to mid-1960s, was coming up. Raised within upper-middle-class families inhabiting post-[[World War II]] apartment buildings typical of communist Yugoslavia, their interests included music, football, and movies. They soon converged on music as their main activity and simultaneous with entering high school started forming bands despite possessing very limited musical skills. Most of their musical influences were found in [[Western world|Western]] popular culture — from early ones such as [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], [[Lou Reed]], the [[Rolling Stones]], [[The Who]], etc. to those found later on the emerging punk scene.

By early 1980, the kids were able to adapt a cellar at the 19 Fuada Midžića Street low-rise apartment building into a makeshift rehearsal space where they held band practices, [[chamber play]]s, even an odd [[fashion show]]. Initially very informal with irregular rehearsals and frequently changing lineups (often through swapping band members), by 1981 the bands — named [[Zabranjeno Pušenje]] and [[Elvis J. Kurtović &amp; His Meteors]] — took on a more serious note. Adopting garage/punk rock sensibility, they started devoting more attention to songwriting and began playing small clubs around town. In parallel, from May 1981, some of the kids from both bands got a chance to collaborate on ''[[Top lista nadrealista]]'', a comedy segment on ''Primus'' radio show that aired weekly, Saturday mornings, on [[Radio Sarajevo]]'s channel two.

===Forming a movement===
The idea to create a movement as an umbrella entity encompassing their entire activity had been tossed about for months during the second part of 1982 and early 1983 between the individuals in and around Elvis J. Kurtović &amp; His Meteors — the band's manager [[Malkolm Muharem]], its main lyricist and mascot [[Elvis J. Kurtović]], and its singer [[Rizo Kurtović]].

Additional notable members of the movement included [[Nele Karajlić|dr. Nele Karajlić]], [[Sejo Sexon|mr. Sejo Sexon]], [[Dražen Ričl]], [[Boris Šiber]], [[Zenit Đozić]], and others from the Sarajevo neighbourhood of [[Koševo (Sarajevo)|Koševo]]. Along the way, individuals outside of the Koševo milieu, most notably [[Branko Đurić|Branko "Đuro" Đurić]], joined in and also became prominent. Despite being a bit older and not from the same neighbourhood, film director [[Emir Kusturica]] (who was already well-established with his award-winning movie ''[[Sjećaš li se Doli Bel?]]'') was an associate and friend of the crew; although his movies can not be directly associated with the movement, their spirit certainly shares some sentiment with New Primitivism. With the bands playing small demo gigs around the city, they encountered other up and coming rock bands such as [[Plavi orkestar]] and [[Crvena jabuka]] that also cultivated similar thematic narratives focused on stories of local small time characters, but would eventually move away from the aesthetic and turn towards the mainstream.  

The movement's wider unofficial unveiling was said have taken place at an Elvis J. Kurtović &amp; His Meteors gig in Sarajevo's CEDUS club venue during early March 1983. Also playing the gig was Zabranjeno Pušenje. Influenced by movies like 1979's ''[[Quadrophenia (film)|Quadrophenia]]'' that portray the youth scene of London with subcultures like [[Mod (subculture)|mods]], [[Rocker (subculture)|rockers]], and [[teddy boy]]s, the guys from Koševo tried to create their own local version of that.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iWhGnwGUT0&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=121 Damar Show];Pink BH, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The formal introduction of the new entity changed nothing in the internal group dynamic as they all continued functioning like a neighbourhood gang of friends, but it gave the press something to latch onto and made it easier to market the bands outside of the city. By his own admission, Muharem used the movement "to create an impression to those in Belgrade and Zagreb that there's something more going on in Sarajevo than there actually is".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeGWqOo7uAI#t=484s Rockovnik - 24. episode Anarhija All over Bascarsija];RTS, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to music and comedy on radio, the lads decided to expand their modes of expression now that they functioned as a movement — attempting to come up with a clothing style to associate with New Primitivism. The movement's unofficial look was thus born with a démodé style consisting of waist tight [[bell-bottoms|bell-bottom pants]], plaid [[suit jacket]]s, thin golden necklace worn above the shirt, and pointy shoes (the so-called ''špicoke'') — similar to the 1970s [[leisure suit]] look — which the lads adopted from petty hoodlums and small-time smugglers and pickpockets seen around [[Baščaršija]] selling, though not wearing, clothing items such as [[Levi's]] 501 jeans that were either smuggled in from [[Italy]] or counterfeit locally in Yugoslavia. Elvis J. Kurtović &amp; His Meteors especially embraced this throwback look, with young crowds soon showing up to their club gigs dressed this way. Meanwhile, Karajlić came up with the movement's unofficial creed: "Tuđe hoćemo, svoje nemamo" ("What's not ours, we want; because ours, we haven't got."), a parody on one of the often used political slogans of the communist period: "Tuđe nećemo, svoje ne damo." ("What's not ours, we don't want; ours, we won't give up on.").
{{quote box|quote=''During summer 1983, after getting back from an out-of-town gig somewhere, we went to our favourite [[kafana]] Dedan at [[Baščaršija]] where our friend [[Branko Đurić|Đuro]] told us about a journalist from [[:sh:Start (magazin)|Start]] looking for us to do an interview. We were convinced Đuro's fucking with us, but he insisted, telling us the guy had already looked for us at [[Televizija Sarajevo|TV Sarajevo]] (where of course no one ever heard of us), at [[Diskoton]] (where they were also clueless as to who we are), before finally resorting to asking about us from kafana to kafana and eventually ending up at Dedan, leaving a phone number with Đuro. This confirmed to us once more what we had already picked up on during our out-of-town gigs — that people outside of the city are taking our braggadocios and bombastic proclamations in the youth print about being the 'kings of Sarajevo' quite literally and quite seriously. In reality we were complete unknowns. Media outlets in Sarajevo didn't give two shits about us, but we noticed that our embellished stories found a receptive audience in youth print media from other Yugoslav cities. They especially lapped up our tales of this 'great new movement in Sarajevo called New Primitivism'.''&lt;ref name="jul1983-start"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kurtović|first=Elvis J.|url=http://www.radiosarajevo.ba/kolumne/elvis-j-kurtovic/meteorski-uspon-elvisa-j-kurtovica/228133|title=Meteorski uspon Elvisa J.

One of the very first activities on the movement's behalf was writing an [[open letter]] to Sarajevo's own [[Goran Bregović]], the best known and the most established rock musician in Yugoslavia, who was at the moment going through a well-documented creative and commercial crisis with his band [[Bijelo Dugme]]'s [[Uspavanka za Radmilu M.|latest studio effort]] getting poor reviews and selling underwhelmingly, not to mention constant reports of infighting and vocalist [[Željko Bebek]]'s imminent departure. Dripping with jovial sarcasm and backhanded compliments, the new primitives' letter invited Bregović to join them, offering him a fresh start along with a creative reset.

===Elvis J. Kurtović &amp; His Meteors get the ball rolling===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Elvis.j.kurtovic.jpg|335px|thumb|right|[[Elvis J. Kurtović &amp; His Meteors]] before a concert in [[Kulušić]], [[Zagreb]].]] --&gt;
[[Elvis J. Kurtović &amp; His Meteors]] were the first to establish a bit of a buzz on the scene. Promoted by Muharem, who in addition to the band's business side also handled many of its creative aspects, EJK&amp;HM were not only gigging in clubs around Sarajevo, but in 1983 also started playing clubs nationwide, in Belgrade ([[Studentski kulturni centar (Belgrade)|SKC]]), Zagreb ([[Kulušić]] and Lapidarij), Rijeka (Palah), Pula, etc., getting enthusiastic reactions from young club crowds everywhere. Though their sound was hardly original with straight covers of the [[Rolling Stones]], [[The Who]], etc. dominating the repertoire, EJK&amp;HM live shows were a unique mixture of rock'n'roll with elements of [[performance art]] and [[stand-up comedy]], full of youthful exuberance with Elvis J. Kurtović, the band's lyrics writer and mascot, constantly interacting with the crowd between songs. They mostly played student clubs with their promotional activities strictly limited to printed press.&lt;ref name="damar"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GnqP6kskh8 Elvis J. Kurtovic @ Damar]&lt;/ref&gt; Muharem would get them publicity by talking up New Primitivism and ensuring journalists from youth-oriented papers — ''[[Džuboks]]'' and ''Reporter'' from Belgrade, ''Polet'' from Zagreb, and ''[[Mladina]]'' from Ljubljana — have the 'right angle' for the story while the band members would contribute by providing colourful interviews and quotable sound bytes often delivered in form of a [[manifesto]].

In late July 1983, the fledgling band received a huge boost after ''[[:sh:Start (magazin)|Start]]'', a Yugoslavia-wide high-circulation weekly newsmagazine in the vein of ''[[Playboy]]'' and ''[[Lui]]'', deployed its journalist [[Goran Gajić]] to Sarajevo for a story on the unconventional group.&lt;ref name="jul1983-start"/&gt; Published as a two-page spread headlined "Meteorski uspon Elvisa J. Kurtovića" (Elvis J. Kurtović's Meteoric Rise) in a magazine that's circulated in 200,000 copies, the story was by far the biggest media exposure the band had gotten up to that point. Building upon talking points already well established and developed by Muharem and Kurtović through the country's youth print media, the ''Start'' piece was extremely affirmative and flattering for the EJK&amp;HM youngsters — proclaiming them to be "the next important thing in Yugoslav rock".&lt;ref name="jul1983-start"/&gt; Along with a new batch of the band members' trademark off-the-wall soundbytes sprinkled throughout, the article also re-published — on Muharem's insistence despite Kurtović's apparent opposition&lt;ref name="jul1983-start"/&gt; — their sarcastic open letter to Goran Bregović that thus got a much bigger audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jergović|first=Miljenko|url=http://www.radiosarajevo.ba/kolumne/miljenko-jergovic/miljenko/255037|title=Iz vremena kada očevi nisu znali protiv koga to pjevaju njihova djeca|agency=radiosarajevo.ba|date=27 February 2017|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Riding the wave of publicity generated by the ''Start'' piece, Muharem acted quickly in the fall of 1983 by ambitiously booking Elvis J. Kurtovich &amp; His Meteors for a double bill concert with [[D' Boys]] at Sarajevo's Đuro Đaković Hall, an all-seater venue holding almost a thousand people.&lt;ref name="jul1983-start"/&gt; The show sold out quickly and was a smashing success, a remarkable triumph for a band that at the time hadn't been on television yet and still had no studio recordings.&lt;ref name="damar"/&gt;

Muharem soon arranged for the band to get some time in Akvarijus studio in Belgrade during December 1983 in order to record material for their debut album whose production was originally supposed to be handled by Peđa Vranešević of [[Laboratorija Zvuka]], but was eventually done by [[Goran Vejvoda]] as well as Elvis J. Kurtović and Muharem themselves. [[Margita Stefanović]] from [[Katarina II]] made a guest appearance on the synthesizer during the album recording sessions as her band was recording its own [[Katarina II (album)|debut album]] in the same studio at the same time.

EJK&amp;HM and Muharem soon agreed a record contract with [[Založba kaset in plošč RTV Ljubljana|ZKP RTLj]] and their debut album ''[[Mitovi i legende o Kralju Elvisu]]'' came out in February 1984 right in the middle of the Winter Olympics being held in the city. Figuring that promoting the album during the Olympics would get them extra attention due to all the press and other visitors gathered in the city, EJK&amp;HM held a press junket that largely turned shambolic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kurtović|first=Elvis J.|url=http://www.radiosarajevo.ba/kolumne/elvis-j-kurtovic/30-godina-mitova-i-legendi/175242|title=30 godina 'Mitova i legendi...'|agency=radiosarajevo.ba|date=23 December 2014|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a series of club gigs at the popular student club Trasa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kurtović|first=Elvis J.|url=http://www.radiosarajevo.ba/kolumne/elvis-j-kurtovic/olimpijada-jurek-burek/74103|title=Olimpijada, Jurek, burek|agency=radiosarajevo.ba|date=14 February 2012|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also made one of their first proper TV appearances, lip-synching "Baščaršy Hanumen" on ''Hit meseca'' (Yugoslav counterpart to ''[[Top of the Pops]]'') while hamming it up for the cameras. The album release was followed by a promotional club tour of bigger Yugoslav cities, but since the record was selling poorly with less than 15,000 copies sold, the tour ended quickly and the deflated band members returned to Sarajevo.

Malkolm Muharem soon quit working with the band.

===''Das ist Walter'' released and ''Top lista nadrealista'' starts on television===

A few months later, in April 1984, Zabranjeno Pušenje's debut album ''[[Das ist Walter]]'' came out for [[Jugoton]] in limited issue of 3,000 copies, clearly indicative of the label's extremely low commercial expectations. Recorded in immensely modest circumstances and over an unreasonably long period of 7 months due to reasons beyond their control, the album features punk and garage rock sensibility with songs referencing local toponyms and social strata such as an obscure Sarajevo movie theater, Bosnian coal miners, local thugs from various city neighbourhoods, a local hoodlum being incarcerated in the [[Zenica prison]] etc. Its initial sales were nothing to speak of.

Simultaneously with the album release, ''Top lista nadrealista'' moved to television as a weekly sketch comedy programme. The shows started airing on 2 June 1984 on [[BHT 1|TV Sarajevo]]'s channel two as well as on [[Yugoslav Radio Television|JRT]] exchange for the rest of the country. Despite being placed in a milieu well removed from their natural setting — their comedy sketches were essentially fillers in-between [[Narodna muzika|folk music]] numbers — the show eventually proved a good vehicle for reaching a wider audience. After the opening few episodes that were largely met with indifference, the show started gaining a bit of an audience outside of its Sarajevo youth core with whom it had immediately struck a cord.

This gradually increased viewership of ''Top lista nadrealista'' had a positive effect on ''[[Das ist Walter]]'' sales. Riding the buzz created by the TV show as well as the growing popularity of the "Zenica Blues" track (cover of [[Johnny Cash]]'s "San Quentin"), Karajlić's and Sexon's blend of punk and local storytelling began finding an increasingly receptive audience months after its initial release.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.story.rs/intervju/3070-nele-karajlic-trudim-se-da-budem-dobar-tata-i-muz.html Karajlic interview];''Story'', 4 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; No one was more surprised at this turn of events than the label itself as it was forced to order multiple new batches of the album copies on records and cassettes.

New Primitivism as a term also started catching on as Yugoslav media began using it when referencing the band's style or when talking about the television show. Also, another of the more popular songs on the album, "Anarhija All Over Baščaršija" (Anarchy All Over [[Baščaršija]]), explicitly mentions New Primitives, bringing them up in the context of "violent locals from [[Vratnik, Sarajevo|Vratnik]] who listen to [[narodna muzika|Yugoslav folk music]], attack [[hippie]]s, and are repulsed by the [[Western world|West]]".

On 15 September 1984 as ''Top lista nadrealista'' episodes resumed broadcasting following the summer break, the band played Sarajevo's Dom mladih on a bill that also included [[Bajaga i Instruktori]] in front of a raucous crowd of 4,500. The band was officially out of the clubs and now playing larger halls. In October, Zabranjeno Pušenje went to Belgrade for a show at [[Studentski kulturni centar|SKC]] where they were surprised to discover their newly found popularity. In addition to having to add an extra show in the same venue the next day due to popular demand, they also started getting recognized by kids on the street. The two SKC shows launched the band on an extensive and successful Yugoslavia-wide tour; on 4 November 1984 they sold out [[Hala sportova]], a sports arena in Belgrade with 6,000 in attendance. They would end up playing over 60 concerts on that tour.

In parallel, the album sales ended up hitting the 100,000 mark while the term New Primitives also became well established in the process. However, the increased profile also meant increased scrutiny as Karajlić and the band were about to find out.

===The 'Marshall' affair...===
At a concert in [[Rijeka]]'s [[Dvorana Mladosti]] before a crowd of some two and a half thousand people on Tuesday, 27 November 1984, the band inadvertently set off a firestorm of controversy.
{{quote box|quote=''Following my lawyer's advice, the defense I presented at the 'Marshal has croaked' court hearings was continuously denying I ever said the remark they accused me of saying. My lawyer, being an intelligent man fully aware of the particular point in time, politically, in Yugoslavia, knew the extent to which this mad witch-hunt could've gone to had I admitted to actually uttering the remark. He also knew 'Marshal has croaked', which still sounded like blasphemy in 1984, would soon take on a whole different contextual meaning. And really, within a short few years, figuratively speaking, 'Marshal has croaked' became an official political programme for many of the newly founded political parties that were in the process of gaining strength and eventually winning power all over Yugoslavia.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0qZHB6XIRs&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=50s |title=Glavni tok |agency=RTV Pink |date=1990s}}&lt;/ref&gt;|source=Nele Karajlić on the 1985-86 verbal offence court case against him|width=20%|align=right}}
During [[soundcheck]] before the show, the band's amplifier went bust to which Karajlić jokingly exclaimed: "Crk'o maršal" (The "Marshall has croaked!"), followed by a pause before adding: "Mislim na pojačalo" ("The [[Marshall Amplification|amplifier]], that is") (a [[switcheroo]] remark about the 1980 death of Marshal [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]]), getting a chuckle from a small group of people within the earshot. Liking the reaction he got during soundcheck, he decided to start the actual concert by delivering the same joke as an explanation to why the show is starting late.

There was hardly any negative reactions during the concert or immediately after it, and the band continued its tour with a triumphant concert at Ledena dvorana in Zagreb in front of 12,000 fans on 10 December 1984. Though a few write-ups mentioning Karajlić's marshal quip appeared in neutral tone in Zagreb-based papers leading up to the concert, it would be the op-ed piece by journalist Veljko Vičević in Rijeka-based daily newspaper ''[[Novi list]]'' that started the avalanche with far-reaching consequences. Headlined "Opak dim Zabranjenog pušenja" (Zabranjeno Pušenje's Sinister Smoke), Vičević strongly denounces the band for lack of morals and stepping over the line, and additionally reproaches the group members for things they said in the past such as "Tuđe hoćemo/nećemo, svoje nemamo".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSQXINde0GM#t=276s Opak dim Zabranjenog pusenja]&lt;/ref&gt;

This was the initial stone and the signal for numerous bodies of the communist system to criticize the band (as well as, by proxy, new primitives and ''Top lista nadrealista'') on various grounds. The controversy also served to open another front in the row between two internal factions wrestling for the control of [[Socialist Republic of Croatia|SR Croatia]]'s SSO, the provincial branch of the [[League of Socialist Youth of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav Socialist Youth League]] (SSOJ), itself a youth wing of the [[one-party state|country's one and only political party]] — [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav Communist League]] (SKJ). Since the Rijeka concert was organized by the local pro-[[Stipe Šuvar|Šuvar]] SSO in Rijeka, the rival pro-[[Vladimir Bakarić|Bakarić]] faction within the organization used Karajlić's Marshal quip to smear the organizing group.

By January 1985, news of the Rijeka flap made it back to Sarajevo where more journalists, most notably Pavle Pavlović in the ''As'' newspaper, were ready to condemn the band further. In his piece headlined "Otrovni dim Zabranjenog pušenja" (Zabranjeno Pušenje's Poisonous Smoke), Pavlović labels Karajlić's words "an insensitive association and piece of sarcasm that insults right to the heart". The columnist then trails off to even take ideological issue with the humorous sound bytes in radio jingles promoting the December 1984 release of the ''Top lista nadrealista'' radio material on audio cassette by [[Diskoton]]. He continues by predicting that "the young band's life span will be little longer than that of a [[butterfly]]" before adding that "sadly even such short time is enough to indoctrinate the impressionable kids with new thoughts, including continuous ridicule of everything that we've created so far as well as banal, low-brow tampering with the basic tenet of the [[Yugoslav People's Liberation War|People's Liberation War]] — Tuđe nećemo, svoje ne damo". Pavlović concludes by musing "whether the time has come to extinguish Zabranjeno Pušenje's poisonous smoke for good".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.media.ba/mcsonline/files/shared/Pavle_P.pdf Otrovni dim Zabranjenog Pusenja]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://protest.ba/v2/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Otrovni-dim-Zabranjenog-pu%C5%A1enja.jpg Otrovni dim...]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a communist country where verbal offence was defined as a crime and as such punishable by law, Karajlić and other band members were summoned for dozens of police questionings. Communist Yugoslavia had its [[sacred cow (idiom)|sacred cow]]s and public criticism or ridicule, either veiled or open, of Tito, the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|party]], or the People's Liberation War was grounds for severe punishment. Karajlić ended up being taken to court with a criminal charge that was eventually reduced to a misdemeanor one in a legal process that stretched on for years.

===...and its consequences===
However, an even bigger problem was that Zabranjeno Pušenje became blacklisted as a result of the Marshal episode. While not banned outright, their songs were taken off radio playlists, their access to television was restricted, and more than 30 of their already booked concerts in early 1985 ended up getting cancelled due to pressure from above that manifested itself through sudden introduction of administrative obstacles such as denying permits for the venues on the day of the show and so on.&lt;ref name="SlavoljubMarkovic-feb1985"/&gt;

Throughout January 1985, the new primitives experienced multiple bizarre manifestations of this sudden anti-Zabranjeno Pušenje hysteria in Sarajevo.

Each January, during winter school break, TV Sarajevo's daytime schedule consisted of various kids' shows reruns, and one such show happened to feature the band's hit song "Zenica Blues". Not being aware of that, the technician running the [[control room]] that day let the show air by mistake. Since Zabranjeno Pušenje were essentially banned from the station, TV Sarajevo executives found it sufficiently necessary to apologize for the oversight later that day in the station's central daily newscast ''Dnevnik 2'' and also to issue temporary suspensions both to the technician as well as to the executive in charge.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reDtowLheLA#t=733s Glavni tok];RTV Pink, 1990s&lt;/ref&gt;

By association, the hysteria also spread to ''Top lista nadrealista'' activities. While promoting the freshly released audio cassette in Sarajevo containing the best of compilation of 'Top lista nadrealista' radio segment, there was such a stigma attached to the group's activity in the city that not a single journalists was brave enough to show up at the promotional press event at Muzikalije record store in [[Josip Juraj Strossmayer|Štrosmajerova]] Street, fearing that being seen there would be interpreted as a public show of support for beleaguered Karajlić and the rest of his mates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.media.ba/bs/magazin-etika/cenzura-na-radiju-80-ih Cenzura na radiju 80-ih], media.ba, 6 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempting to rectify and calm the situation, members of Zabranjeno Pušenje issued a letter to all socio-political organizations within Sarajevo and the Socialist Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, including the print media outlets that had been criticizing the band. The gist of the letter was the claim that they never insulted the image and legacy of Comrade Tito thus denying media reports claiming otherwise and labeling them "monstrous lies".&lt;ref name="SlavoljubMarkovic-feb1985"&gt;{{cite news|first=Slavoljub|last=Marković|url=http://www.yugopapir.com/2016/02/zabranjeno-pusenje-afera-crko-marsal.html|title=O društveno-političkoj odgovornosti rock-zvezda: Filter ili muštikla|agency=''Reporter''|date=February 1985|accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the letter was generally ignored within Sarajevo and SR Bosnia-Herzegovina as the only press outlets to publish it were Zagreb's youth paper ''Polet'' and later Belgrade's ''[[Politika]]''.&lt;ref name="SlavoljubMarkovic-feb1985"/&gt;

Due to all the problems and hassle suddenly associated with organizing a Zabranjeno Pušenje gig, local promoters began avoiding the band despite clear demand for their concerts. Finding itself increasingly isolated in addition to seeing its commercial momentum slip away, the band decided to invest all its energy into organizing a single high-profile gig that would hopefully as much as anything serve as a statement of encouragement for all potential promoters not to shy away from the band. Still, despite selling out [[Hala Pionir]] in Belgrade on Saturday, 16 February 1985 with more than 7,000 people in attendance, the concert didn't have the desired media effect and the band's downward slide continued with gigs now completely dried up.

Facing insurmountable obstacles, the group gave in temporarily, deciding to lay low for some time while some of the members went back to making ''Top lista nadrealista'' on Radio Sarajevo. However, in March 1985, the authorities put an end to that too, removing the segment for good from the radio schedule.

Just as the career of one New Primitivism band, Zabranjeno Pušenje, was suddenly spiraling downhill, another band from the same milieu, [[Plavi Orkestar]], was getting big.

Other bands that at one time or another identified with New Primitives include: [[Bombaj Štampa]], [[Plavi Orkestar]], [[Dinar (band)|Dinar]] and [[Crvena Jabuka]], although they quickly moved on to more commercial and communicative forms of expression.

===''Soldatski bal''  hits it big===
Though the torch of New Primitivsm had primarily been carried by Elvis J. Kurtovich &amp; His Meteors and Zabranjeno Pušenje, other bands were also associated with the movement.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:PlavOrkestar cover of Svijet June 1985.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Despite [[Plavi Orkestar]]'s fragmentary association with New Primitivism, the movement arguably got its biggest media promotion via the enormous commercial success of the band's debut album ''[[Soldatski bal]]'' in early 1985.]] --&gt;
After splitting with Elvis J. Kurtovich &amp; His Meteors following the lacklustre reception of their debut album, crafty manager Malkolm Muharem switched over to another local Sarajevo outfit — [[Plavi Orkestar]] — a band that had also been gigging on the city's student club scene for some time already and was now looking to take the next step by recording and releasing a studio album. Though also starting out as a garage/punk rock group that often crossed paths with Pušenje and EJK (Orkestar's bassist Ćera I even played on Pušenje's demo recordings before joining Orkestar while the bands also often held club gigs together), over time, especially after achieving stable lineup of Loša, Pava, Ćera I, and Ćera II in early summer 1983, Plavi Orkestar moved to more conventional forms of expression within Yugoslav general cultural context. In practice, that meant pretty much abandoning punk in favour of pop and openly flirting with Yugoslav commercial folk in their sound. Though opening doors for them commercially, this practice somewhat placed them on the fringes of New Primitivism. Compared to the two main new primitive outfits, their stage appearance was far more orderly and their lyrics were less cerebral.

Nevertheless, Muharem saw a new opportunity with the four fresh-faced lads each of whom just turned 20 having recently returned to the city from their respective year-long mandatory [[Yugoslav People's Army|army]] services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kurtović|first=Elvis J.|url=http://www.radiosarajevo.ba/kolumne/elvis-j-kurtovic/o-marusi-razglednici-iz-nisa-i-prestanku-pusenja/100032|title=O Maruši, razglednici iz Niša i prestanku pušenja|agency=radiosarajevo.ba|date=15 January 2013|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fall 1984 when Muharem took the youngsters under his wing, the band barely existed as its main creative duo — frontman [[Saša Lošić]] and guitarist Mladen "Pava" Pavičić — were not on speaking terms and Pava left the band. Not deterred, Muharem took the remaining three members to Zagreb and through personal connections got [[Parni Valjak]]'s Husein "Hus" Hasanefendić to record a few more demos with them, while also managing to secure a pre-contract with Jugoton.

The news of the pre-contract signing brought Pavičić back into the fold and by January 1985 all four were off to Zagreb to record in [[SIM studio]]. The album named ''[[Soldatski bal]]'' came out in February 1985 and instantly created a sensation all over Yugoslavia, placing the young band among the most successful Yugoslav rock acts like Bijelo Dugme and [[Riblja Čorba]]. Muharem essentially stayed true to the promotional techniques he previously implemented with Elvis J. Kurtovich &amp; His Meteors — print media and soundbytes — though the sarcastic bravado of EJK&amp;HM was now replaced with Plavi Orkestar's dreamy boyish charm. However, this time it had a tremendous commercial effect as the band embarked on a Yugoslavia-wide tour in late summer 1985 with scenes of thousands of screaming and fainting teenage girls repeated in town after town.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yugopapir.blogspot.ca/2012/11/pop-fenomeni-plavi-orkestar-djeca-su.html Pop fenomeni: Plavi orkestar - Djeca su čisto poludjela!];September 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Named 'Bolje biti pijan nego star' (Better Drunk than Old) after the band's hit track, the tour included 140 concerts in sports arenas and other large venues throughout the country. Muharem additionally hired journalist-turned-filmmaker Goran Gajić to shoot a tour documentary thus reuniting with him two years after Gajić wrote a glowing summer 1983 piece on Elvis J. Kurtović in ''Start''. Furthermore, Gajić directed a video for Plavi Orkestar's hit track "Kad mi kažeš, paša" featuring actresses [[Tanja Bošković]], [[Sonja Savić]], journalist Mirjana Bobić-Mojsilović, and TV personality [[Suzana Mančić]]. The album ended up selling 550,000 copies. Though with unexpected and sudden success the band's sensibility quickly transformed even more into folkish pop as they almost morphed into a sugary [[boy band]], many media outlets still presented them as a new primitive group, giving the movement unprecedented promotion in Yugoslavia during the first half of 1985.

==Reaction and reception==
Initial wider media reaction to the movement wasn't positive. During New Primitivism's nascent stage, following a summer 1983 double-bill concert by Elvis J. Kurtovich &amp; His Meteors and Plavi Orkestar at Belgrade's SKC, a [[blurb]] appeared in the high-circulation ''[[Politika]]'' daily reviewing the show, but also discussing the movement in general. In his negative review, rock critic Ljuba Trifunović placed New Primitivsm in the same context with commercial [[narodna muzika|folk]] singer [[Lepa Brena]]'s then current flirtation with rock sound ("[[naïve art|naïve]] rock"), expressing disappointment that "both appeared precisely when we began to think [[Yugoslav rock]] finally became immune to such diseases due to [[New wave music in Yugoslavia|new wave]] effectively washing away the so-called '[[Bijelo Dugme#.22Shepherd rock.22 years: rise to fame and .22Dugmemania.22 .281974.E2.80.9379.29|shepherd's rock]]' and all of its derivatives". Seeing New Primitivsm in continuity with several past offerings from the Sarajevo musical scene such as composer [[Nikola Borota Radovan]]'s opus, [[Jutro]], early [[Bijelo Dugme]], and [[Milić Vukašinović]]'s collaboration with [[Hanka Paldum]], Trifunović felt that adjective "new" was entirely superfluous in the movement's name: "Elvis J. Kurtovich &amp; His Meteors and Plavi Orkestar are representatives of this renewed and stripped-down [[primitive culture|primitivsm]], and even if some inconsequential differences do exist when comparing the two bands' interpretative [[wikt:dilettante|dilettantism]] (with EJK&amp;HM coming out on top), what's really depressing is their absolute creative [[pathos]] embodied in the creed 'let's be ourselves' - primitive Balkanoids".&lt;ref&gt;[http://haler.blogger.ba/arhiva/2008/10/08/1831190 In the Name of Love];''Politika'', summer 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

As the movement got more profiled in late 1983 and especially throughout 1984 with the emergence of Zabranjeno Pušenje's debut album and the start of ''Top lista nadrealista'' on television, it began getting better media notices.

In July 1984, rock critic Darko Glavan wrote a detailed opinion piece on New Primitivism in general as well as EJK&amp;HM and Zabranjeno Pušenje specifically. Expressing mild approval, he summarized his personal acceptance of the movement: "If someone likes them, I'm not going to dissuade them, however, if someone doesn't like them, I'm not going to attempt convincing them otherwise". Furthermore, while noting new primitives are deserving of the media attention they've been receiving, he wondered whether they're getting too much publicity because "they are terrific as an added flavourful spice to a developed and varied rock scene, but can hardly function as the dominant trend".&lt;ref name="jul1984-studio"&gt;{{cite news|last=Glavan|first=Darko|url=http://www.yugopapir.com/2016/06/muzicko-leto-1984-darko-glavan-o-novom.html|title=Muzicko leto 1984, Darko Glavan o novom primitivizmu: Imaju li Elvis i Nele pretjerani publicitet?|agency=''Studio''|date=July 1984|accessdate=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Focusing on EJK&amp;HM, he labelled them "Bosnia's answer to [[Sha Na Na]]", before proclaiming them an acceptable form of entertainment for the general masses and a welcome break from incoherent [[art rock]] pretentiousness. Though further expressing skepticism whether this is still enough for a conventional rock career, citing EJK&amp;HM's unwillingness to freshen up their repetitive jokes and yucks as a concern for their long term career prospects.&lt;ref name="jul1984-studio"/&gt; Glavan was more upbeat about Pušenje, finding them to be "more musical, more talented, and in the context of an [[LP record|LP]], simply stronger than EJK&amp;HM". Comparing Pušenje to [[The Clash]] in addition to extolling their artistic ambition that "saves them from becoming one-dimensional caricatures and additionally invokes locally flavoured stylized [[Italian neorealism|neorealism]] of [[Emir Kusturica]]'s ''[[Do You Remember Dolly Bell?|Sjećaš li se Doli Bel?]]''", Glavan felt that, despite occasionally failing to properly articulate their inventiveness, the band has a fresh voice and a couple of great tracks off their debut album.&lt;ref name="jul1984-studio"/&gt;

[[Goran Bregović]] once referred to New Primitivism as "''the only authentic Yugoslav answer to [[punk subculture|punk]]''".

Novelist [[Miljenko Jergović]] considered it "a general cultural emancipatory movement that was supposed to rid the Bosnians of their eternal [[inferiority complex]] towards Zagreb and Belgrade".&lt;ref&gt;[http://haler.blogger.ba/arhiva/2008/10/08/1831190 In the Name of Love];Ogledalo, early 1990s&lt;/ref&gt;

In his scathing 1993 rebuke of the movement, Muhidin Džanko, a professor at the [[University of Sarajevo]]'s Faculty of Philosophy, labeled New Primitivism an "exceptionally [[Islamophobia|anti-Islamic]] movement" that "thanks to the charisma of its protagonists, managed to directly obstruct and even eliminate the national feelings of the Bosnian Muslim youth, majority of whom are proud members of the 'new primitive nation'". He furthermore saw the [[poetics]] of New Primitivism to be rooted in its specific language containing "supposed speech patterns and parlance of the Sarajevo [[Baščaršija|čaršija]] and [[mahala]]s", before rejecting it as a "cheap trick meant to lampoon the traditional verbal expression of Sarajevo Muslims and degrade their [[Oriental]] [[lexicology]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Džanko|first=Muhidin|url=http://haler.blogger.ba/arhiva/2008/10/08/1831190|title=Sarajevski novi primitivizam - Pokret za destrukciju muslimanskog nacionalnog bića|agency=|date=1993|accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Zoran Kostić (musician)|Zoran "Cane" Kostić]], the [[Partibrejkers]] frontman, wasn't a fan of the movement; in 1997 he mentioned it in passing during an interview: "Bosnians ([[Plavi Orkestar]] and [[Crvena Jabuka]]) took over Belgrade sometime around 1986 and it was because of these raucous new primitive guys that they were able to pull that off. They were their [[Trojan Horse]]s. I never got into that new primitive thing precisely because I saw something else in it. I mean, in the end, their schtick enabled all these dumb bands such as [[Valentino (band)|Valentino]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nin.co.rs/arhiva/2436/3.html Ispovest: Zoran Kostic Cane, partibrejker: BEZ TRIKA I FOLIRANJA];''NIN'', 5 September 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Zabranjeno.pusenje1.jpg|335px|thumb|right|[[Zabranjeno Pušenje]] in 1987 during the ''[[Pozdrav iz zemlje Safari]]'' tour.]] --&gt;
New Primitivism as a sub-cultural movement retained prominence well after its demise.

To many it also gained added relevance in the context of the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]]. Books like 2013's ''Shake, Rattle and Roll: Yugoslav Rock Music and the Poetics of Social Critique'' written by Dalibor Mišina, assistant professor of sociology at [[Lakehead University]], devote a significant portion to the study of New Primitivism's overall significance in the last decade of SFR Yugoslavia's existence, arguing that the country could've survived had it adopted values propagated by New Primitivism and similar genres as its new cultural model.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.ca/Shake-Rattle-Roll-Yugoslav-Critique/dp/1409445658/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1360563221&amp;sr=1-1 Shake, Rattle and Roll: Yugoslav Rock Music and the Poetics of Social Critique]&lt;/ref&gt;

Asked in 2012 whether New Primitivism was a political or a cultural movement, Nele Karajlić said: {{cquote|''It was a fuckabout that got taken a little too seriously in the end. It was created as our answer to global musical trends that the Western music industry had been manufacturing and launching in regular intervals in order to sell more records. Whenever there's a lull in sales, the industry comes up with something called, say, [[New Romanticism]], for example. And then, a band appears and it's called [[Ultravox]], for example, so we all cut our hair like Ultravox and we buy that thing for a year or year and a half. And then it's time for New Something Else, and the same cycle is repeated over again..... As sensitive and receptive consumers of pop-culture we quickly realized the whole thing is a sham so we decided to "join" the musical industry by coming up with our own movement. New Primitivism would've been genius had it been taken over and fostered by a serious conceptual artist willing to invest at least as much energy in it as those Slovenian dudes did in their [[Neue Slowenische Kunst]]. However, speaking objectively, that was impossible because the guys in NSK took their thing seriously while we never got past the fucking around stage..... I should also add that the biggest difference between New Primitivism and NSK was the fact that "old primitivism" tangibly existed while the "Altslowenische Kunst", strictly speaking, never did''.&lt;ref&gt;"Smisao nadrealizma dr. Neleta Karajlića", Nebojša Grujičić &amp; Jovana Gligorijević, ''Vreme'' issue #1144, Belgrade, 6 December 2012, p.52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://postimage.org/image/69sdmb66p/full/]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Discussing the interest New Primitivism has been getting from social scientific circles, Elvis J. Kurtović wrote in his online column in 2013: {{cquote|''Once in a blue moon, I'll get a call from someone saying they're a researcher working at some university and they want to ask me questions about New Primitivism. My immediate reaction is to fuck with them. However, when they later send me a nicely bound hardcover book, I must say I'm filled with pride. Nothing gives me more satisfaction than seeing 30-year-old crap I wrote purely out of spite, indolence, or malevolence, now translated into English and dissected by serious people for deeper meaning''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kurtović|first=Elvis J.|url=http://www.radiosarajevo.ba/kolumne/elvis-j-kurtovic/hoce-hoce-al/101470|title=Hoće, hoće, al'...|agency=radiosarajevo.ba|date=29 January 2013|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''Palace of the Shirvanshahs''' ({{lang-az|Şirvanşahlar Sarayı}}, {{lang-fa|کاخ شروان‌شاهان}}) is a 15th-century palace built by the [[Shirvanshah]]s and described by UNESCO as "one of the pearls of Azerbaijan's architecture". It is located in the Inner City of [[Baku]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://azerbaijan24.com/about/azerbaijan_cities/baku/palace_of_the_shirvanshahs/|title=Palace of the Shirvanshahs|website=azerbaijan24.com|language=EN|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Azerbaijan]] and, together with the [[Maiden Tower (Baku)|Maiden Tower]], forms an ensemble of historic monuments inscribed under the [[UNESCO World Heritage List]] of Historical Monuments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/958 |title=Walled City of Baku with the Shirvanshah's Palace and Maiden Tower&amp;nbsp;– UNESCO World Heritage Centre |last=Centre |first=UNESCO World Heritage |publisher=UNESCO |language=en|access-date=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complex contains the main building of the palace, Divanhane, the [[burial vault (tomb)|burial-vaults]], the shah's mosque with a minaret, Seyid Yahya Bakuvi's mausoleum (the so-called "mausoleum of the [[dervish]]"), south of the palace, a portal in the east, Murad's gate, a reservoir and the remnants of a bath house.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.window2baku.com/eng/shirvan/9sh_00shirvan.htm|title=The Ensemble of the Shirvanshahs’ Palace|last=Nasibov|first=Faig|website=www.window2baku.com|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier, there was an ancient mosque, next to the mausoleum. There are still ruins of the bath and the lamb, belong to the west of the tomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.visions.az/en/news/159/cdc770e3/|title=Visions of Azerbaijan Magazine ::: The Palace of the Shirvanshahs|work=Visions of Azerbaijan Magazine|access-date=2018-06-06|language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, the palace was surrounded by a wall with towers and, thus, served as the inner stronghold of the Baku fortress. Despite the fact that at the present time no traces of this wall have survived on the surface, as early as the 1920s, the remains of apparently the foundations of the tower and the part of the wall connected with it could be distinguished in the north-eastern side of the palace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://azincoming.az/visitazerbaijan/dvorec-shirvanshaxov/|title=Palace of the Shirvanshahs|website=Турагентство в Баку, туры по Азербайджану, туры по Баку|language=en|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no inscriptions survived on the palace itself. Therefore, the time of its construction is determined by the dates in the inscriptions on the architectural monuments, which refer to the complex of the palace. Such two inscriptions were completely preserved only on the tomb and minaret of the Shah's mosque. There is a name of the ruler who ordered to establish these buildings in both inscriptions is the – Shirvan Khalil I (years of rule 1417–1462). As time of construction – 839 (1435/36) was marked on the tomb, 845 (1441/42) on the minaret of the Shah's mosque.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The burial vault, the palace and the mosque are built of the same material, the grating and masonry of the stone are the same.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unesco.preslib.az/en/page/vwDYTl9EcS|title=UNESCO World Heritage List|last=Huseynzade|first=Tuncay|date=|website=unesco.preslib.az|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The complex used to occupy more place. There were rooms for court servants and services.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

The main buildings of the ensemble were built at different times. Despite this fact, these buildings are linked by unity of scale, by rhythm and proportionality of the basic architectural forms – cubic volumes of buildings, domes, portraits. The builders of the ensemble relied on the traditions of the Shirvan-Absheron [[Architecture of Azerbaijan|architectural school]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.everycastle.com/Palace-of-the-Shirvanshahs.html|title=Palace of the Shirvanshahs – Castles, Palaces and Fortresses|website=www.everycastle.com|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, the palace complex was declared a museum-preserve and taken under the protection of the state. In 2000, this ensemble, along with the fortified walls of the historic part of the city and the Maiden Tower, was included in the [[World Heritage site|UNESCO World Heritage List.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/958|title=Walled City of Baku with the Shirvanshah's Palace and Maiden Tower|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://bakushopfest.com/en/sightseeings-in-azerbaijan/|title=Sightseeng in Azerbaijan {{!}} Baku Shopping Festival|work=Baku Shopping Festival|access-date=2018-06-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In the 15th&lt;ref&gt;[[:ru:Бретаницкий, Леонид Семёнович|Бретаницкий Л. С.]] Зодчество Азербайджана XII-XV вв. и его место в архитектуре Переднего Востока / Главная редакция восточной литературы.&amp;nbsp;– Наука, 1966..&amp;nbsp;– С. 401.&amp;nbsp;– 556 с.&lt;/ref&gt; century the [[Shirvanshah]] dynasty, under [[Ibrahim I of Shirvan]], transferred his capital from [[Shemakha]] to Baku following a devastating earthquake. He committed himself to the construction of the "palace".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{clarify|date=April 2016}} The building is believed to be a memorial complex built around the sacred [[place of worship]] ([[Pir (Sufism)|pir]]) and tomb of Seyyid Yaxya Bakuvi who was a [[Khalwati order|Helwati]] [[Sufi]] saint. The Shirvanshahs were patrons of the Helwati Sufiye order, and Shirvanshah [[Khalilullah I]] was buried with his family in the grounds of the palace. Other historians argue that the building was used as the ruler's palace. Both theories suffer from the absence of evidence. It is known that wells inside the grounds of the "palace" were considered to have healing qualities until recent times, as was the hill where the palace was built.

After the [[Safavid]] conquest of Baku in 1501, the Sufi order was expelled. Over centuries the "palace" fell into ruin and was known in Baku as Baku Khans palace; this [[toponym]] moved into Russian historiography, first cited by [[Bartold]].

Until 1501, there wasn't any information found about the building of the palace. According to one of the Persian chronicles, in 1501 the troops of shirvanshakh Farrukh-yessar, the son Khalil-ully I, were defeated in Shemakha by the troops of Shah Ismail I from the Safavid dynasty. Farrukh-yessar was killed in the battle of shirvanshah; the troops of Ismail I, having defeated near Shemakha, moved to Baku, besieged it and after several assaults took the city.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Then, a tall building of Shirvanshahs was destroyed due to the order of Shah Ismail I. After a while, the city of Baku and its entire district, as well as Shirvan, were governed by the governors who were placed by the Safavids. There is not any detailed information about the people who lived in the palace and in what state it was in the first half of the XVI century.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

In the second half of the 16th century there was a war between the Safavids and [[Ottoman Empire|the Ottoman Empire]]. In 1578, the Turks conquered Baku. From the time of the rule of the Ottoman Empire in the palace area, the gate in the palace wall surrounding the palace from the east has been preserved. From the inscription placed on the portal of this gate, it follows that they were built during the reign of the Turkish [[Murad III|sultan Murad III]] (1574–1595 years of rule).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.azernews.az/travel/99282.html|title=Shirvanshahs Palace :history and curiosities PHOTO|date=13 July 2016|work=AzerNews.az|access-date=2018-06-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the literary works, there were Turkish pashas living in the palace at that time. The East Gate is a witness of this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://islamtimes.co.uk/ru/article/article/Dvorets_shahov_Shirvana/19342|title=Дворец шахов Ширвана|work=islamtimes.co.uk|access-date=2018-06-06|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the XVII century, the palace was empty, and there were not any government officials. The abbot of the monastery and the representative of the [[Isfahan]] mission Capuchin Pater Raphael du Mans in his essay in 1660 described Shirvanshah Palace in Baku fortress and gave information about its desolation and destruction. In 1723, Baku was besieged by the troops of [[Peter the Great|Peter I]], and the city was bombed. In this regard, the south-eastern facades of the palace suffered much. The palace was transferred to the Russian military department in the middle of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldheritagesite.org/list/Walled+City+of+Baku|title=Walled City of Baku – Unesco World Heritage Site {{!}} For World Heritage Travellers|website=www.worldheritagesite.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian military department made a partial renovation of the palace. At the same time, the significant restructuring was carried out, which adapted the palace facilities to warehouses for military equipment. Repairs carried out by the military department, along with the restoration of the destroyed parts, and led to the destruction of a number of parts required for the restoration of the palace.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; By adapting the building of the palace to the warehouse, the military department demolished a number of walls separating the rooms in the second and first floors, and there were semi-circular arches supporting the roof instead of them on the second floor.

The remains of domed, lancet and cross-slabs were destroyed in all the rooms on the second floor; they were replaced by flat beams. And window openings (double-glazed windows) of the second floor were laid out so that only small windows remained. New wide doorways were pierced.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.anl.az/down/meqale/kaspi/2010/iyul/129070.htm|title=Palace of the Shirvanshahs. History|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, [[Orthodoxy in Azerbaijan|the Orthodox Church in Baku]] sought the demolition of the palace to build a Baku cathedral in its place. However, this petition was rejected by the tsarist authorities only because the premises of the palace were used for large warehouses.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

There was an entrance made to the second floor of the northern facade of the palace and a huge opening was punched in the wall. This was done for the cart drawn by the horses from the street would enter the second floor of the palace. After making the above-mentioned reorganization, the military department attached a ladder to the eastern facade of the palace, and the entire southern (or lower) courtyard was surrounded by a stone wall with loopholes. This wall was erected from a foundation left from the old walls surrounding the palace.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.alluringworld.com/palace-of-the-shirvanshahs/|title=Palace of the Shirvanshahs {{!}} {{!}} Alluring World|date=26 January 2018|work=Alluring World|access-date=2018-06-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The palace ensemble is now protected by fortress walls erected in the first half of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://castellinelmondo.altervista.org/en/castle/azerbaijan/abseron/baku-fortress/|title=Baku Fortress in Azerbaijan – Abşeron|website=castellinelmondo.altervista.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During existence of the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]] (1918–1920), a number of measures were taken to study and fix architectural monuments. Thus, at the end of 1918, the dimensional drawings of the Shirvanshahs Palace were made by the Ishmael Bek Nabi oglu, the architectural engineer. At the beginning of 1920, several cycles of lectures on the fate of the palace were read in the "Society for the Study of the Muslim East" by Ismail bek Nabi oglu. The periodical press indicated that the report was illustrated by various photographs and drawings of the palace. After the reports and debates, the presidium of the society was elected, which included chairman Professor Zimin, Comrade chairman I Belyaev, secretary-teacher Seidov and Kazioni Subkhanverdikhanov. The meeting instructed the presidium to organize an excursion to the palace in the near future.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In 1920, the government of the [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|Azerbaijani SSR]] began to take measures to protect the monument. Since 1920, the cleaning of the palace from the age-old layers of garbage and partial repairs began, accompanied by archaeological reconnaissance.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In 1924 the works were continued. After the large repair and restoration works of 1932–1934, conducted by AzCUOP together with the Moscow State Restoration Workshops for projects designed by architect Boris Zasypkin, the building of the former Shirvanshah palace was given to the Azerbaijan History Museum AzFAN. Since the clay floors were fragile, and the building of the palace was intended for the organization of a museum in it, during the repair and restoration work the floors were covered with parquet. Also during the works from the window openings were laid the stones laid in the XIX century, and they were returned to their original appearance. The original layout of the second floor was not restored, due to the fact that the premises were supposed to be a museum: where there are only two rooms, there were originally eight rooms. The plan of the first floor was completely restored.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gattesco|first=Natalino|last2=Macorini|first2=Lorenzo|date=2015|title=Structural Performance of Old Composite Floors Made up of Wrought Iron Joists and Masonry Vaults|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/amm.796.13|journal=Applied Mechanics and Materials|volume=796|pages=13–24|doi=10.4028/www.scientific.net/amm.796.13|issn=1662-7482|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937-1938 under the guidance of archaeologist V.N. Leviatov, archaeological excavations were carried out in the palace and a large number of artifacts dating from the 12th-15th centuries were found. And the archaeological excavations conducted by Leviatov in 1945 on the territory of the palace ensemble, deep beneath the foundations of the surviving buildings, revealed the remains of a once densely populated residential quarter. Numerous fragments of ceramic products and coins date it to the VIII-IX centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://elibrary.bsu.az/books_460/N_440.pdf|title=Archaeological excavations in Azerbaijan during USSR|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For some time, the Azerbaijan People's Museum and the Museum of the History of Religion were located in the palace building. In 1960, the palace was turned into an architectural reserve, which in 1964 was transformed into the State Historical and Architectural Museum-Reserve "Complex of the Shirvanshahs Palace".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://deyerlerimiz.az/ru/%D0%B0%D0%B2%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2/%D0%B4%D0%B2%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%86-%D1%88%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%88%D0%B0%D1%85%D0%BE%D0%B2/|title=Дворец ширваншахов {{!}} Demokratiyanın və  Milli Dəyərlərin Təbliği  İctimai Birliyi|website=deyerlerimiz.az|language=ru-RU|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, new restoration works began. The author of the restoration project of the palace complex was Niyazi Rzayev. Restoration began from the throne room.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com/azerbaijan/baku/attractions/palace-of-the-shirvanshahs/a/poi-sig/444235/358673|title=Palace of the Shirvanshahs|website=www.lonelyplanet.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, at the 24th session of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee, the historical part of the city of Baku, Icheri Sheher, along with the palace, was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site from Azerbaijan.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These were the first objects included in the list of UNESCO, located on the territory of Azerbaijan. In 2006, the next restoration of the palace was completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.azerizv.az/news/a-8353.html|title=Газета Азербайджанские Известия – Рена РЗАЕВА, директор Дворца Ширваншахов: "Наши двери всегда открыты для гостей" – Главная – Новости|last=Известия|first=Газета Азербайджанские|website=www.azerizv.az|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The main building (the Palace) ====
The building of the palace did not arise at once. The building of the complex was started in 1411 by Shirvanshah Sheykh Ibrahim I. The two-storey building of the palace numbers about 50 dimensions and outlines of the constructions connected with three narrow winding staircases. The big lancet portal directly leads from the courtyard to the second floor, into a high octahedral lodging covered with a cupola. A small, octagonal vestibule behind it connects it with the rest of the lodgings in the palace.

The earliest building (approximately the end of the fourteenth century) is the central part (octagonal hall of the second floor). The part adjoining the western facade was added a little later. The western, northern and a small part of the eastern facades form an incomplete rectangle. The rest of the eastern facade and the entire southern facade are formed by two triangular lanterns and a broken line between them, enclosing four right angles.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

There were originally 52 rooms connected by three narrow spiral staircases in the palace building: 27 on the first and 25 on the second floor (currently 16 rooms on the second floor), and the layout of the second floor basically reproduced the plan of the first floor. The central part of the palace (octagonal hall of the second floor, the entrance to which is decorated with a portal) has thicker walls. Arranged in the western facade, the main entrance to the palace is decorated with a high portal. The ladder of the portal leads to a tall octagonal front hall, covered with a dome. It is assumed that this room served for receptions.

The small octagonal lobby behind it connected the hall to the rest of the rooms. Slit-shaped holes in the faces served as a voice connection with the lower floor, where the office premises were located. The rooms and rooms of the second floor are more ceremonial. Among them, there are the southern and eastern facades with bay windows that reveal the bay view. There are also rooms for the Shah and his family on the second floor.

The smooth surface of the large stone planes of the palace is shaded by alternating rows of masonry, differing in color, width and texture, as well as the "shebeke" aura – stone gratings in small light apertures.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

There were daily-life objects, coins of the XII-XV centuries, copper utensils, weapons and decorations of the XIX century, musical instruments of the XV century found during the archaeological excavations both on the territory of the palace complex and in the territory of the historical center of Icheri-Sheher and Shirvan. There were also female costumes and embroidery of the XIX century, Shemakha carpets of the XIX century and carpet woven in the XVII century in Baku. There is a mock-up of the historic part of the city in the center of the hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/82_folder/82_articles/82_shirvanshah.html|title=8.2 The Shirvanshah Palace: The Splendor of the Middle Ages|website=www.azer.com|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Image:Palacio de los Shirvanshah, Baku, Azerbaiyán, 2016-09-26, DD 154.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Turbe (Mausoleum) of Shirvanshahs in Baku. 15th century.]]

==== Divan-khana ====
A small aperture, located on the north side of the palace garden, leads to the closed courtyard Divan-khana, which is framed on three sides by a pointed arcade. In the composition center Divan-khana there is an octagonal rotunda-pavilion. The hall of this rotunda is surrounded by an open arcade of the same warrant. The elliptical cover with a slightly pointed top is protected from the outside by a faceted stone dome. The western facade of the rotunda is decorated with arabesques which are stylized with a portal, the channeled half-cupola of the lancet conch is supported by a system of finely modeled stalactites (mucarnases). Overhead planes are covered with ornament. The portal leads to the canopy connecting the hall with the and service rooms located one above the other.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iguzzini.com/projects/project-gallery/shirvanshahs-palace-complex/|title=A project of Palace of the Shirvanshahs|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several versions of the appointment of Divan-khana.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; It was supposed to serve as a building for legal proceedings, receptions or state council, or perhaps, it was a mausoleum. The most common hypothesis is based on the common name of the monument, according to which it was assumed that it is a court, or a reception room of the palace, or the building of an "order". The features of the style and the incompleteness of the part of the decoration work allow one to date Divan-khana to the end of the 15th century, the time of the capture of Baku by the Safavid troops. The features of the plan, the dungeon-crypt and the content of the lapidary inscription above the entrance to the hall (Koran, Sura 10, verses 26 and 27) indicate his memorial appointment.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The origin of the original architectural structure is also associated with the pre-Islamic funerary tradition. Historian [[Sara Ashurbeyli]] believes that even in pre-Islamic times, the occupied Divan-khan territory was a sacred place (it is assumed that the cup-shaped grooves served to collect the sacrificial blood of animals)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://elibrary.bsu.az/books_460/N_440.pdf|title=Historians about Palace of the Shirvanshahs|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Keygubad Mosque ====
In the old days, a mosque was added to the mausoleum of Seyyid Yahya Bakuvi, which was called the "old" mosque. It is known as the "Kei-Kubad Mosque". This mosque was built at the end of the fourteenth and the beginning of the fifteenth century after the destruction of the older building on which it was built. The mosque was covered with a dome, which was supported by four stone columns that stood inside the mosque. The clutches of the mosque were tied up with the laying of the mausoleum. In 1918, the "old" mosque burned down during a fire. The image of this mosque and its brief description was given in the article of Andrei Pavlinov, who visited Baku and saw the mosque in 1888, published in the third issue of the journal "Materials on the Archeology of the Caucasus" (Moscow, 1893)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visions.az/en/news/159/cdc770e3/]&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Abbasgulu Bakikhanov]] wrote that Bakuvi taught and prayed in the mosque: "The cell where he prayed, the school where he worked and his grave are there, in the mosque". Keygubad Shirvanshah ruled from 1317 to 1343 and was Sheikh Ibrahim's grandfather.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.visions.az/en/news/159/cdc770e3/|title=Visions of Azerbaijan Magazine ::: The Palace of the Shirvanshahs|work=Visions of Azerbaijan Magazine|access-date=2017-05-19|language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s, when E. A Pakhomov surveyed the mausoleum and ruins of the old mosque, it was discovered that the pedestal on which the base of one of the mosque columns stood, covers a narrow trench made in the ground and plastered into the crypt of the mausoleum. In this trench, there were several stone tombstones. When examining the crypt, it was found that there were scattered bones to twenty human skeletons. The bones were folded without observing any rules. This is due to the fact that at the place where the mausoleum stood and around it, there was once a cemetery. And during the construction of the mosque and digging foundation pits under the foundations, a number of burials were broken. Bones from the broken graves were collected and stacked in the mausoleum, and gravestones – in the trench. These tombstones are not preserved. Currently, on the site where the mosque once stood, there are two columns that once stood inside the mosque, as well as part of the wall with the roof.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==== Mausoleum of Seyyid Yahya Bakuvi ====
In the southern courtyard, next to the palace, stands a mausoleum, built in the second half of the 15th century, called the mausoleum of the "dervish" and known as the burial of the court scholar Khalil Ili Seyid Yahya Bakuvi, who was engaged in medicine, mathematics, and astrology. The mausoleum has an octagonal body, which completes the pyramidal tent. The interior of the mausoleum consists of an underground crypt where the tombstone of Bakuvi is located, and a camera above it. Small octagonal volume of the mausoleum turns into a drum covered with a dome. On the sides of the mausoleum there are three small windows carved into solid slabs of limestone, and, like in the old days, they are through-through stone gratings, consisting of multi-beam stars. The archway in the northern part is connected the mausoleum with an older mosque.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; According to Abbaskuli aga Bakikhanov, "the cell where he prayed [Bakuvi], the school and the grave that are under the mosque named after him, still exist today".

In the front of the lower courtyard, there is a mosque building with a minaret. In terms of the mosque is rectangular, has a large hall, a small women's chapel and service rooms. The northern portal is facing the Shirvanshahs burial vault. This portal is more solemn than the east, which was intended for the inhabitants of the palace, descending the semi-underground passage. The double-lighted hall is covered with a dome on spherical sails.&lt;ref name="vestikavkaza.ru"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vestikavkaza.ru/articles/Legendy-Dvortsa-SHirvanshakhov.html|title=Легенды Дворца Ширваншахов {{!}} Вестник Кавказа|website=vestikavkaza.ru|language=ru-RU|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mihrab mosque is located at the southern end of the hall. Above the one-woman women's chapel there is also a domed room. It is inferior in size to the dome of the hall and repeats its outlines.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Against the backdrop of the prismatic volume, completed by two domes with slightly pointed tunnels, a deeply shaded aperture of the mosque portal is clearly drawn.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Above the northeast corner of the mosque stands a minaret, ending with a stalactite cornice supporting a balcony that had a stone barrier before. The inscription encircles the minaret below the stalactite cornice. It is executed in the font "nash" and contains inscription.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://elibrary.bsu.az/books_460/N_440.pdf|title=A structure of Palace of the Shirvanshahs|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inscription says about the construction of the minaret, but not the mosque that was built at an earlier time. This is confirmed by the lack of a decorated rich portal and artistic inscriptions on it.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==== The Eastern Portal ====
On the territory of the southern courtyard of the complex was the so-called Eastern Portal, also known as the "Gate of Murad".&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icherisheher.gov.az/static,33/lang,en/|title=Icherisheher :: Museums|last=|date=|website=www.icherisheher.gov.az|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of this portal completed the formation of the ensemble. Judging by the inscription on the portal niche, the portal was built during the years of occupation of Baku by Ottoman troops at the behest of a noble Bakrada of the Rajab Baba in 994 AH (1585/86) by architect Amir Shah of Vaillankoukh (suburb of Tabriz). Compared with the Divan-khana portals and the Shirvanshahs burial vault, the structure and forms of the portal are somewhat simplified. It has a less rich and elegant decor. The upper part of the portal is decorated with a building inscription in Arabic.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

The inscription has sockets with floral ornaments on both sides. In the lower part of the portal, there is a deep niche formed by a stalactite semi-double. Unlike other portals of the palace, the Eastern portal has a wide lancet entrance opening, similar to the gate. Sarah Ashurbeyli assumes that this structure was the entrance to a building that did not survive, or was not erected.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==== Shrine ====
Near the shah's mosque in the lower courtyard, in the wall separating the lower platform from the upper one, is located the building of the Shirvanshahs burial vault, the so-called "Turbe". This building is located directly opposite the entrance, overlapped by a pointed vault. Smooth wall of the facade is lined with Baku limestone with a careful fit of the seams. Above the building, there is a richly decorated portal to the tomb. This portal repeats the compositional reception of the Divan-khan portal, but in comparison with the latter it is somewhat easier to interpret (the stalactite arch consists of only four rows of stalactites, the side walls are smoothly solved, no niches,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; and only tympanum of the arches, a number of inscriptions in the font "nash" – Koranic (Surah XII, verse 92nd) and hadith.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

On the right and left of the portal's lancet aperture in two onion-shaped medallions are inscriptions with the name of the builder-architect of the tomb. In each medallion, the same inscription is repeated twice (in direct and mirror image) and contains the following words: Allah Muhammad Ali (an architect). Judging by the name, the architect was a Shiite. Above the ornamentation of the tympanum of the stalactite arch there is a strip with an inscription of a religious nature. In the tympanas, medallions are also arranged on each side, also with an inscription. The inscription above the entrance to the portal dates the construction of the burial vault 839 (1435/36) and reports that the tomb was built by Shirvanshah Halilullah for his mother and son.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The portal leads to the canopy, on the right and left side of which are located associated with the opening of small rooms, probably intended for ministers of worship. The canopies lead to the main hall, which is cross-shaped in plan, and its central part is covered with a dome resting on the vaults of the branches of the cross and stone walls through a system of spherical sails. It is interesting that outside the stone dome was once covered with turquoise glaze.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

During the archaeological excavations in the tomb were found fragments of architectural details of tombstones in the hall, as well as a number of burials of members of the family of Halilullah. So, archaeological works in 1946 under the wooden floor of the tomb, a crypt was found with five burials, covered with stone slabs (one of them contained the remains of a child of 6–7 years old, apparently the son of Halilullah, the other – older women, probably the mother of Halilullah, the skeleton of a man is 18–19 years old). The continuation of the work in the tomb found a number of untouched tombs, the total number of which reached 14. The names of the members of the family of Halilullah can be found on the basis of odes, elegies and chronograms from the sofa of [[Badr Shirvani]]: the mother of Halilullah Bike khanum (died 839 AH / 1435/6), his sons Farrukh Yamin (born 839 AH / 1435/6, died in 846 AH / 1442/3 at the age of seven), Sheikh Saleh (born in 847 AH / 1443, died in 849 AH / 1445/6 at the age of 2 years), Mir Bahram (killed ( Shaheed) in the Kaytag steppe at a young age of 20 Muharram in 850 AH / 17 April 1446), Prince Muhammad Ibrahim (born 20 Muharram 836 / 16 September 1432), Farrukh Yasar (born 12 Muharram 845 AH / 2 June 1441).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==== Bathhouses ====
In the lower courtyard of the complex, there is a bathhouse, the location of which does not allow us to contour the territory that belonged to the palace. It is assumed, however, that the bathhouse, built in the 15th century, was indeed a palace. The bath was cleared of blockages, and the internal layout of the bath was restored thanks to the conservation of the lower rows of wall masonry.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The palace bath, like the vast majority of the baths of the East, was buried in the ground, but only the entrance portal and the domes of large halls were visible from the outside, the crowns of which ended with perforated lanterns that served as ventilation. Such a strong depth of the bath was typical for the baths of the entire Absheron peninsula.

The visitor of the bath from the vestibule-dressing room got into the soap-house, where there was a swimming pool for general ablution. To the soap adjoining large and small rooms, intended for all procedures that required a different temperature. The necessary temperature of the various rooms, depending on their destination, was tried to preserve the internal layout of the bath. In one of the last chambers of the bathhouse, there was a tank with hot water. Under it, there was a firebox, which served to heat all the premises of the bath. The underground, the stables and the walls of the baths were heated by a branched system of heat-conducting channels.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://hg2.com/venue/shirvanshahs-palace/|title=Shirvanshah's Palace – One of the Best Palaces in Old City, Baku|work=Hg2|access-date=2018-06-06|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ovdan ====
Not far from the bathhouse is located the ovdan – a reservoir, which was one of the largest in the Fortress of the Ovdans. This ovdan supplied drinking water not only to the palace, but also to the entire surrounding area. This assumption is confirmed by the nearby small, built in the XIV century Chin Mosque, which is believed to have served the residents of the nearby area. Ovdan supplied water to the palace bathhouse.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Ovdan is a spacious reservoir located deep underground, which was ventilated by means of a special vertical shaft. Such a structure is typical for most of the ovdans surviving till the present day. To descend into the reservoir it was possible by a gentle staircase, which was blocked by a lancet arch. =&lt;ref name="vestikavkaza.ru"/&gt;

Water came into the ovdan from a well-kept underground water pipe-kyhryza. The water intake structures of this water pipe were quite far from the city.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== In culture ==
Images of the Shirvanshahs palace can be found on the works of such artists as Grigory Gagarin, Georgy Hohenfelden, in the photographs of Richard Thiele. In 1990, the postage stamp of the USSR, dedicated to the palace, was issued. Later, the image of the palace appeared on the postage stamps of the Republic of Azerbaijan. Also, Shirvanshah's palace was depicted on an Azerbaijani banknote in face value of 10,000 manats. Description of the palace is found in the novel of [[Kurban Said]] [[Ali and Nino|"Ali and Nino.]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.visions.az/en/news/860/11c61a56/|title=Visions of Azerbaijan Magazine ::: Azerbaijan in Prose|work=Visions of Azerbaijan Magazine|access-date=2018-06-06|language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Palace complex in cinematography ===
The architecture of the palace several times fell into the footage of [[Leonid Gaidai]]'s film "[[The Diamond Arm|Brilliantovaya ruka]]", which was also filmed in the "old city" of Baku.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.day.az/culture/727111.html|title=Приключения кинозвезд в Баку  – КАК СНИМАЛИ|date=13 December 2015|work=Day.Az|access-date=2018-06-06|language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Plastered human skulls''' are reconstructed human skulls that were made in the ancient [[Levant]] between 7000 and 6000 BC in the [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B]] period. They represent some of the oldest forms of art in the [[Middle East]] and demonstrate that the prehistoric population took great care in burying their [[ancestors]] below their homes. The skulls denote some of the earliest sculptural examples of [[portrait]]ure in the [[history of art]].

==Discovery==
One skull was accidentally unearthed in the 1930s by the archaeologist [[John Garstang]] at [[Jericho]] in the [[West Bank]]. A number of plastered skulls from Jericho were discovered by the British archaeologist [[Kathleen Kenyon]] in the 1950s and can now be found in the collections of the [[British Museum]], the [[Ashmolean Museum]], the [[Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, University of Cambridge|Cambridge Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]], the [[Royal Ontario Museum]], the [[Nicholson Museum]] in Sydney and the [[Jordan Archaeological Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;ROM Collection [http://images.rom.on.ca/public/index.php?function=image&amp;action=simpledetail&amp;image_name=ROM2004_1044_7 ROM Images. "Plastered Human Skull."]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ashmolean.org/collections/highlights/?type=highlights&amp;id=33&amp;department=1|title=TREASURES {{!}} Ashmolean Museum|website=www.ashmolean.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://maa.cam.ac.uk/maa-highlights/middleeast/israel_palestine/388/|title=MAA - Features|website=maa.cam.ac.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other sites where plastered skulls were excavated include [[Ain Ghazal]] and [[Amman]], [[Jordan]], and [[Tell Ramad]], [[Syria]].&lt;ref name=bm&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/me/p/plastered_skull.aspx The British Museum. "Plastered Skull."]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the plastered skulls were from adult males, but some belonged to women and children.

==Archaeological significance==
The plastered skulls represent some of the earliest forms of burial practices in the southern [[Levant]]. During the [[Neolithic]] period, the deceased were often buried under the floors of their homes.&lt;ref name=bm/&gt; Sometimes the skull was removed, and its cavities filled with plaster and painted. In order to create more lifelike faces, [[Seashell|shells]] were inset for eyes, and paint was used to represent facial features, hair, and [[moustaches]].&lt;ref name=bm/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/the-neolithic-revolution.html German, Senta. "The Neolithic Revolution."]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some scholars believe that this burial practice represents an early form of [[ancestor worship]], where the plastered skulls were used to commemorate and respect family ancestors.&lt;ref name=bm/&gt; Other experts argue that the plastered skulls could be linked to the practice of head hunting, and used as trophies. Plastered skulls provide evidence about the earliest arts and [[religious]] practices in the [[ancient Near East]].

'''Robert Bateman''', {{post-nominals|country=CAN|OC|OBC|RCA}} (born 24 May 1930) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[Natural history|naturalist]] and [[painting|painter]], born in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]].&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.robertbateman.ca/biography.html| publisher=Robert Bateman Website| title=Biography| accessdate=2014-12-23| date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Robert was always interested in art, but never intended to make a living from it. He was fascinated by the natural world in his childhood; he recorded the [[Visual perception|sight]]ings of all of the birds in the area of his house in Toronto and did small paintings with birds in their habitats.&lt;ref name="CBC"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/lifeandtimes/bateman.html| publisher=[[CBC News]]| title=The Life And Times of Robert Bateman| year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; He found inspiration from the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]]; later, he became interested in making abstract paintings of nature.&lt;ref name="pengal"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.pengal.com/artists/robert-bateman-originals| publisher=Peninsula Gallery| title=Robert Bateman, (Originals)| accessdate=2014-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the mid-1960s that he changed to his present style, [[realism (visual arts)|realism]].&lt;ref name="CBC"/&gt; In 1954, he graduated with a degree in [[geography]] from [[Victoria University in the University of Toronto|Victoria College in the University of Toronto]]. Afterwards, he attended [[Ontario College of Education]]. Starting in 1957, Bateman travelled around the world for 14 months in a Land Rover with his friend Bristol Foster. As they made their way through Africa, India, Southeast Asia, and Australia, Bateman painted and sketched what he saw.

Bateman became a high school teacher of art and geography, and continued focusing his life on art and nature.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; His work started to receive major recognition in the 1970s and 1980s. Robert Bateman's show in 1987, at the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in Washington, DC, drew the largest crowd for a living [[artist]].&lt;ref name="Pegasus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pegasusgallery.ca/artist/Robert_bateman.html|title=Algonquin Park Untitled|publisher=Pegasus Gallery|accessdate=2014-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of Bateman's paintings are acrylic on various media, and have been shown in major one-man exhibitions around the world.&lt;ref name="environmental"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.robertbateman.ca/art/environmental/environmental1.html|title=Environmental Paintings|publisher=Robert Bateman Website|accessdate=2014-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bateman also has numerous books devoted to his works.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; After two decades as a high school teacher, he became a full-time artist in 1976. A year later Mill Pond Press started making signed, limited edition prints of some of his paintings; over the years, these prints resulted in millions of dollars being raised for environmental causes.

In 1999, the Audubon Society of Canada declared Bateman one of the top 100 environmental proponents of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=Fitz&gt;{{cite book |title='Fitzhenry and Whiteside Book of Canadian Facts and Dates' |last=Pound |first=Richard W. |publisher=Fitzhenry and Whiteside |date=30 March 2007| page=807| url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fitzhenry-Whiteside-Canadian-Facts-Dates/dp/1554550092/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1419371354&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=fitzhenry+and+whiteside+book+of+canadian+facts#reader_1554550092| isbn=978-1554550098| subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Bateman Secondary School]] in [[Abbotsford, British Columbia]], [[Robert Bateman High School]] in [[Burlington, Ontario]], and Robert Bateman Public School, [[Ottawa, Ontario]] are named for him. He is an Honorary Director of the [[North American Native Plant Society]], and has received thirteen honorary doctorates from institutions like the University of Victoria, University of Toronto, Royal Roads University, and McGill University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nanps.org/index.php/contact-us/nanps-board|title=The 2014-2015 NANPS Board of Directors|publisher=North American Native Plant Society|accessdate=2014-12-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231001042/http://www.nanps.org/index.php/contact-us/nanps-board|archivedate=2013-12-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A permanent home for his works can be found in the Inner Harbour of Victoria, BC. [http://batemancentre.org The Robert Bateman Centre] houses the definitive collection of his works, and also includes a dynamic program of public events. It supports the Bateman Foundation, a not for profit organization to encourage dialogue about humanity's relationship to the natural world.

=== Family Life ===

Robert Bateman married Suzanne Bowerman in 1960. They had three children: Alan, Sarah, and John.

In 1975, Bateman married Birgit Freybe Bateman. Their two children are Christopher and Robert.

In the early 1980s Bateman and Birgit moved to Salt Spring Island. The couple purchased a home located on Reginald Hill Road, looking out on Fulford Harbour, that was designed by [[Hank Schubart]] and originally built for actress [[Eileen Brennan]]. In the early 2000s the Batemans moved from the Reginald Hill house to a house on a lake in Salt Spring designed by their son in law, Robert Barnard.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2876">In the [[Middle Ages]], the '''''rotrouenge''''' ([[Old French]])&lt;ref&gt;Also spelled ''retrowange''.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''''retroencha''''' ([[Old Occitan]])&lt;ref&gt;Also spelled ''retroncha'' or ''retroensa''.&lt;/ref&gt; was a recognised type of [[lyric poetry]], although no existing source defines the [[genre]] clearly. There are four conserved [[troubadour]] poems, all with [[refrain]]s and three by [[Guiraut Riquier]] with music, that are labelled ''retronchas'' in the [[chansonnier]]s. Six ''rotrouenges'' survive, but only one with music, and four of them are attributed to one [[trouvère]], [[Gontier de Soignies]].&lt;ref&gt;Jane Bellingham. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/opr/t114/e5767 "Rotrouenge."] ''The Oxford Companion to Music''. Ed. Alison Latham. Oxford Music Online. 5 Oct. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Medieval Occitan treatises state that the ''retroencha'' always has a refrain, but modern scholars have found no other distinguishing characteristic. Pioneering work in singling out and identifying the ''rotroencha'' was made by [[Alfred Jeanroy]]. In the twentieth century, the German scholars Friedrich Gennrich and Hans Spanke developed two distinct theories about the textual and melodic form of the ''rotrouenge'', implicitly suggesting in the process that some of the few specimens of lyric labelled as such in the manuscripts are in fact mis-labelled and do not represent the ''rotrouenge''. The French scholar Jean Frappier noted that "we are not absolutely sure that we have any authentic specimens of the rotrouenge", indicating that by the time the term came into use in the late twelfth century it was no more than an [[archaism]] ("an attractive old term" in the words of Hendrik van der Werf) and that the original genre may have lost its distinct identity.&lt;ref&gt;Hendrik van der Werf. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/23939 "Rotrouenge."] ''Grove Music Online''. Oxford Music Online. 5 Oct. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The following are the only four ''retroenchas'' that survive:
*"Si.m vai be ques eu non envei" by [[Joan Esteve]]
*"Si chans me pogues valensa" by [[Guiraut Riquier]]
*"Pos astres no m'es donatz" by Guiraut Riquier
*"No cugei mais d'esta razo chantar" by Guiraut Riquier

The '''Saint Barbara Altarpiece''' is a medieval [[altarpiece]] attributed to [[Master Francke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Renaissance art: a topical dictionary |author=Irene Earls |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=1987 |isbn=978-0-313-24658-6 |page=35 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zIc7eqi2SzUC&amp;pg=PA35 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its known [[provenance]] starts at the medieval church in [[Kalanti]] in [[Southwest Finland]] where it stood until 1883. According to local [[oral tradition]] that was collected in the 19th century, the altarpiece was found floating in the sea outside Kalanti. The altarpiece is now located at the [[National Museum of Finland]].

The altarpiece is best known for the paintings depicting the legend of [[Saint Barbara]] on the outside of its inner wings.

[[File:Allan Ramsay - The Artist's Wife- Margaret Lindsay of Evelick, c 1726 - 1782 - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|300px|The intimate portrait of his second wife [[Margaret Lindsay Ramsay|Margaret Lindsay]] by [[Allan Ramsay (artist)|Allan Ramsay]], 1758]]
'''Scottish art in the eighteenth century''' is the body of [[visual art]] made in Scotland, by Scots, or about Scottish subjects, in the eighteenth century. This period saw development of professionalisation, with art academies were established in Edinburgh and Glasgow. Art was increasingly influenced by [[Neoclassicism]], the [[Scottish Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and towards the end of the century by [[Romanticism]], with Italy becoming a major centre of Scottish art.

The origins of the tradition of Scottish landscape painting are in the [[capriccio (painting)|capriccio]]s of Italian and Dutch landscapes undertaken by James Norie and his sons. These were further developed by [[Jacob More]], who added a romantic sensibility to the Scottish landscape. [[Alexander Nasmyth]] helped found the Scottish landscape tradition and was highly influential as a teacher in Edinburgh on the subsequent generation of artists. John Knox linked it with the Romantic works of [[Walter Scott]] and was one of the first artists to take an interest in the urban landscape of Glasgow. Aberdeen-born [[John Alexander (artist)|John Alexander]] and William Mossman were the leading portrait artists of the first half of the century. [[Allan Ramsay (painter)|Allan Ramsay]] emerged as the leading portrait painter of the mid-century and to the royal family, noted for his intimate representations. Towards the end of the century [[Henry Raeburn]] emerged as the leading portraitist and one of the first artists to spend the majority of their career in Scotland, extending his range to leading figures of the Enlightenment and most famous for his depiction of the ''Skating Minister''.

Neoclassicism was pioneered by [[Gavin Hamilton (artist)|Gavin Hamilton]] and his proteges, the brothers [[John Runciman|John]] and [[Alexander Runciman]], and [[David Allan (painter)|David Allan]]. Alexander Runciman pioneered [[historical painting]] and Alan helped develop [[genre art]], both of which would be taken up by Scottish artists in the next century. After the [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]] in 1707 there was very little patronage for large and expensive works of art in Scotland. With the growth of civic development there was an increasing demand for public statuary and the portrait bust also became popular. Commissions of new statuary tended to be made in relatively cheap lead and even more economical painted or gilded plaster. From the late eighteenth century there are a handful of examples of work from Scottish artists.

==Background==

===Professionalisation===
Many Scottish painters of the early part of the eighteenth century remained largely artisans. Roderick Chalmers' (fl. 1709–30) painting ''The Edinburgh Trades'' (1720) shows the artist himself, perhaps ironically, among the glaziers, wrights and masons of the burgh.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000p56&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Warrender]] (fl. 1673–1713) produced the ''Allegorical Still Life'' (after 1708), of a letter board that seems to be a commentary on the union of 1707, but he made his living as a house decorator, working closely with architects, including [[William Adam (architect)|William Adam]].&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; He may have trained James Norie (1684–1757), who with his sons James (1711–36) and Robert (d. 1766), painted the houses of the peerage with Scottish landscapes that were [[pastiche]]s of Italian and Dutch landscapes.&lt;ref name=Baudino2011p153/&gt; They tutored many artists and have been credited with the inception of the tradition of [[Landscape painting in Scotland|Scottish landscape painting]] that would come to fruition from the late eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, ''Painting in Britain: 1530 to 1790'', p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt; The painters [[Allan Ramsay (artist)|Allan Ramsay]] (1713–84), [[Gavin Hamilton (artist)|Gavin Hamilton]] (1723–98), the brothers [[John Runciman|John]] (1744–68/9) and [[Alexander Runciman]] (1736–85), [[Jacob More]] (1740–93) and David Allan (1744–96), mostly began in the tradition of the Nories, but were artists of European significance, spending considerable portions of their careers outside Scotland.&lt;ref name=Wormald2005&gt;Wormald, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mFt2S33o8G8C&amp;pg=PT376 ''Scotland: A History''].&lt;/ref&gt; Henry Raeburn (1756–1823) was the most significant artist of the period to pursue his entire career in Scotland, born in Edinburgh and returning there after a trip to Italy in 1786.&lt;ref name=Campbell2003pp142-3&gt;Campbell, ''Edinburgh: A Cultural and Literary History'', pp.&amp;nbsp;142–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1729 there was an attempt to found a school of painting in Edinburgh as the Academy of St. Luke, named after the Renaissance [[Accademia di San Luca]] in Rome. Its sponsors were the elder Norie, the poet [[Allan Ramsay (poet)|Allan Ramsay]] and William Adam. Its president was George Marshall, a painter of [[still life|still lives]] and portraits, and its treasurer was the engraver [[Richard Cooper, the elder|Richard Cooper]]. Other members included Cooper's student [[Robert Strange (engraver)|Robert Strange]], the two younger Nories, the portrait painters [[John Alexander (painter)|John Alexander]] (c. 1690-c. 1733) and Allan Ramsay, son of the poet (1713–84).&lt;ref&gt;Smart, ''The Life and Art of Allan Ramsay'', p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The success of the group was limited by its associations with [[Jacobitism]], with Strange printing bank notes for the rebels.&lt;ref name="Mackieetal1991p202"&gt;Mackie, Lenman and Parker, ''A History of Scotland'', p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt; The Foulis Academy was founded in Glasgow in 1754 by the printmaking brothers [[Robert Foulis (printer)|Robert]] and [[Andrew Foulis]], and in Edinburgh the [[Board of Trustees for Fisheries, Manufactures and Improvements in Scotland]] established the Trustees Drawing Academy in 1760, indicating that art was now part of civic life and not just aristocratic patronage.&lt;ref name="MacDonald2000p57"&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing importance of art can be seen in the post of Royal [[Painter and Limner]], created in 1702 for George Ogilvie. The duties included "drawing pictures of our [Monarch's] person or of our successors or others of our royal family for the decorment of our houses and palaces". However, from 1723 to 1823 the office was a [[sinecure]] held by members of the Abercrombie family, not necessarily connected with artistic ability.&lt;ref&gt;''The Laws of Scotland: Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia'', vol. 7 "The Crown", para 847.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intellectual trends===

[[File:Jacob More - Autoportrait.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Self portrait of [[Jacob More]]]]
All the major painters of the period were to varying degrees influenced by forms of [[Neoclassicism]], which revived Greek and Roman form of artistic expression.&lt;ref name=Wormald2005/&gt; Italy became an important point of reference for Scottish artists, with over fifty artists and architects known to have travelled there in the period 1730–80 as part of a [[Grand Tour]], to paint, sample the art and learn from Italian masters.&lt;ref name=Wormald2005/&gt; With so many artists visiting or resident, Rome became almost a "[[Platonic_Academy#New_Academy|Third Academy)]]" for Scots.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; In the second half of the century Scots became the major figures in the trade in antique sculpture, particularly Gavin Hamilton, Colin Morison (1732–1801) and [[James Byres]] (1734–1817), making them the arbiters of British taste in this area. However, the only major Scottish collection of marble before the nineteenth century was that of [[James Johnstone, 2nd Marquess of Annandale]].&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, "Scottish Connoisseurship and the Grand Tour", pp.&amp;nbsp;39–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scottish artists in the later eighteenth century were strongly influenced by the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], which stressed rationalism and human inquiry, of which Scotland was a major centre of influence. Artists like Alan Ramsey formed [[The Select Society]], with philosophers David Hume and Adam Smith and produced his ''Dialogue on Taste'', which made a major contribution to the study of aesthetics.&lt;ref name="MacDonald2000p57"/&gt; Scotland also played a major part in the origins of the [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]] through the publication of [[James Macpherson]]'s [[Ossian]] cycle, which was proclaimed as a Celtic equivalent of the [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] [[Epic poetry|epics]]. ''Fingal'', written in 1762, was speedily translated into many European languages, and its deep appreciation of natural beauty and the melancholy tenderness of its treatment of the ancient legend did more than any single work to bring about the Romantic movement in European, and especially in German literature, influencing [[Johann Gottfried von Herder|Herder]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]].&lt;ref&gt;Buchan, ''Crowded with Genius'', p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Landscape===
{{See also|Landscape painting in Scotland}}
[[File:JacobMoreNG 1897.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jacob More]]'s ''The Falls of Clyde: Corra Linn'', c. 1771]]
The origins of the Scottish landscape painting tradition are in the Nories' [[Capriccio (art)|capriccios]] or pastiches of Italian and Dutch landscapes.&lt;ref name=Baudino2011p153&gt;Baudino, "Aesthetics and Mapping the British Identity in Painting", p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; Jacob More, having trained with the Nories, moved to Italy in 1773 and is chiefly known as a landscape painter.&lt;ref name=Baudino2011p153 /&gt; This period saw a shift in attitudes to the Highlands and mountain landscapes in general, from viewing them as hostile, empty regions occupied by backwards and marginal people, to interpreting them as aesthetically pleasing exemplars of nature, occupied by rugged primitives, which were now depicted in a dramatic fashion.&lt;ref name=Withers2001pp151-3&gt;C. W. J. Withers, ''Geography, Science and National Identity: Scotland Since 1520'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001), {{ISBN|0-521-64202-7}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;151–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Produced before his departure to Italy, More's series of four "Falls of Clyde" (1771–73) paintings have been described by art historian Duncan Macmillan as treating the waterfalls as "a kind of natural national monument" and has been seen as an early work in developing a romantic sensibility to the Scottish landscape.&lt;ref name=Withers2001pp151-3/&gt;

Alexander Nasmyth visited Italy and worked in London, but returned to his native Edinburgh for most of his career. He produced work in a large range of forms, including his portrait of Romantic poet [[Robert Burns]], which depicts him against a dramatic Scottish background, but he is chiefly remembered for his landscapes and is described in the ''Oxford Dictionary of Art'' as "the founder of the Scottish landscape tradition".&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p433&gt;Chilvers, ''The Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists'', p. 433.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a highly influential teacher at the [[Trustees Drawing Academy]] in Edinburgh.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000pp78-83&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp.&amp;nbsp;78–83.&lt;/ref&gt; The work of John Knox (1778–1845) continued the theme of landscape, directly linking it with the Romantic works of [[Walter Scott]].&lt;ref&gt;Hill, ''Picturing Scotland Through the Waverley Novels'', p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also among the first artists to take a major interest in depicting the urban landscape of Glasgow.&lt;ref&gt;Kemp, ''The Pleasures and Treasures of Britain'', p. 401.&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander Runciman was probably the first artist to paint Scottish landscapes in [[watercolour]]s in the more romantic style that was emerging towards the end of the century.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, ''Painting in Britain'', p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portraiture===

[[File:The Skating Minister.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[The Skating Minister|The Reverend Robert Walker Skating on Duddingston Loch]], traditionally attributed to [[Henry Raeburn]] (1756–1823)]]
Aberdeen-born John Alexander and William Mossman were the leading portrait artists of the first half of the century. John Alexander was born in Aberdeen and was a great grandson of portrait painter [[George Jamesone]]. He studied in London and Rome, returning to Scotland about 1720.&lt;ref name=Waterhouse1994p300&gt;Waterhouse, ''Painting in Britain'', p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt; His younger contemporary William Mossman (1700–71) was also from Aberdeen and studied in Rome. Both worked predominately in the north-east around their home city, but also painted many of the figures of early-Enlightenment Edinburgh. Alexander's best known work included the portrait of [[George Drummond]] the [[List of Lord Provosts of Edinburgh|Lord Provost of Edinburgh]] (1756), who had been responsible for the creation of the [[New Town, Edinburgh|New Town]] in Edinburgh and the [[Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh|Royal Infirmary]], which is shown in the background of the painting. Mosman's work included his portrait of ''John Campbell of the Bank'' (1749), who was chief cashier of the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]] and a [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]], but who is depicted in the recently forbidden [[Highland Dress]]. Because of his Jacobite sympathies Alexander was forced to leave for the continent after the rebellion of 1745, and in Rome he made a living painting the Jacobite expatriates who congregated there, before his return a few years later.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000p56/&gt;

Allan Ramsay studied in Sweden, London and Italy before basing himself in Edinburgh, where he established himself as a leading portrait painter to the Scottish nobility and he undertook portraits of many of the major figures of the Scottish Enlightenment, including his friend the philosopher [[David Hume]] and the visiting [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. After a second visit to Italy he moved to London in 1757 and from 1761 he was [[Principal Painter in Ordinary]] to [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]]. He now focused on royal portraits, often presented by the king to ambassadors and colonial governors. His work has been seen as anticipating the [[grand manner]] of [[Joshua Reynolds]], but many of his early portraits, particularly of women, are less formal and more intimate studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/490799/Allan-Ramsay "Allan Ramsey"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', retrieved 7 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The leading portrait painter of the second half of the century was [[Henry Raeburn]] (1756–1823). He was the first significant artist to pursue his entire career in Scotland. Born in Edinburgh and returning there after a trip to Italy in 1786, he is most famous for his intimate portraits of leading figures in Scottish life, going beyond the aristocracy to lawyers, doctors, professors, writers and ministers,&lt;ref name=Campbell2003pp142-3/&gt; adding elements of Romanticism to the [[Grand Manner]] tradition of [[Joshua Reynolds]]. The most famous painting attributed to him is ''[[The Skating Minister|The Reverend Robert Walker Skating on Duddingston Loch]]'', known as ''The Skating Minister''.&lt;ref&gt;Ochterbeck, ''Michelin Green Guide: Great Britain Edition'', p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; He became a knight in 1822 and the King's [[painter and limner]] in 1823, marking a return to the post being associated with the production of art.&lt;ref name=Campbell2003pp142-3/&gt;

===Neoclassism and genre painting===
{{See also|Classicism|Genre art|Scottish genre art}}
[[File:Allan-highlandwedding1780.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gavin Hamilton (artist)|Gavin Hamilton]], ''Highland Wedding, Blair Athol'' (1780)]]
Gavin Hamilton spent almost his entire career in Italy and emerged as a pioneering [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] painter of historical and mythical themes, including his depictions of scenes from [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'', as well  as having been an informal tutor to British artists, early archaeologist and antiquarian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/253404/Gavin-Hamilton "Gavin Hamilton"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', retrieved 7 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his works can be seen as Enlightenment speculations about the origins of society and politics, including the ''Death of Lucretia'' (1768), an event thought to be critical to the birth of the [[Roman Republic]]. His classicism would be a major influence on French artist [[Jacques-Louis David]] (1748–1825).&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000pp63-5&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp.&amp;nbsp;63–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

John and Alexander Runciman both gained reputations as painters of mythological and historical themes. They travelled to Italy, where they worked with Hamilton. John died in 1768/9 and Alexander returned home. His most widely known work, distributed in etchings, was mythological.&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p554&gt;Chilvers, ''The Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists'', p. 554.&lt;/ref&gt; His version of ''The Origin of Painting'' (1773), depicting [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]'s story of a young Corinthian woman outlining a shadow on the wall, has her hand guided by [[Cupid]], suggesting the ultimate motivation for art was love.

After the [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]] in 1707 the royal family spent very little time in, or money on, Scottish palaces and many Scottish nobles followed the royal court to England, tending to invest in sculpture for their residences in London, rather than their estates in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford, "Introduction", p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; With the growth of civic development there was an increasing demand for public statuary, often with the patronage of a public institution, such as the lead figure of [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] at the newly founded [[Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh]] in 1753 or the figure of the judge [[Duncan Forbes, Lord Culloden|Duncan Forbes]] for the Outer Parliament House in 1752. The portrait bust, designed for interior display, also became popular. By the middle of the century statuary were preferred to painted portraits among the aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, "Proper ornaments for a library or Grotto", p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

As in England, commissions of new statuary tended to be made in relatively cheap lead and even more economical painted or gilded plaster. The plasterwork of [[John Cheere]]'s yard in London was particularly in demand. Also important was the work from the yard of [[John Bacon (sculptor)|John Bacon]] (1740–99) who produced a monument for [[Robert Dundas, of Arniston, the younger|Robert Dundas]] (d. 1787) at [[Borthwick]] Church and one for Mrs Allardyce (d. 1787) at [[Kirk of St Nicholas|West Church, Aberdeen]]. Bacon was also a partner in Mrs Eleanor Coade's ''Artificial Stone Manufactory'' at Lambeth in London. This produced a buff coloured ceramic that could be moulded to provide fine detail, and be fired in sections, but was impervious to frost and fire. Much cheaper than carved stone, [[Coade stone]] was used for sphinxes, [[Baluster|balustrading]], [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]], coat of arms, tablets, ornamental vases, church monuments and fonts. It was used extensively by the [[Adam style|Adam brothers]], particularly in the houses they built in Scotland, such as [[Cullen, Moray|Cullen]], Banff, [[Culzean Castle]], Ayrshire, [[Dunbar Castle]], East Lothian, [[Register House]], Edinburgh, [[Gosford House]], East Lothian and [[Wedderburn Castle|Wedderburn]], Berwickshire. As well as supplying sculpture, candelabra and [[cippi]], the Adam family supplied designs to the [[Carron Company]], founded in 1759, which produced a wide range of iron products, including stoves, safes, vases and tablets.&lt;ref name=Cliffordpp14-15&gt;Clifford, "Introduction", pp.&amp;nbsp;14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the late eighteenth century there are a handful of examples of work from Scottish artists. These included statues of druids on the [[portico]] of [[Penicuik House]] carved by one "Willie Jeans" in 1776; the marble bust of [[James Gillespie (philanthropist)|James Gillespie]] by the obscure Robert Burn (fl. 1790–1816) and the bronze figure in Roman armour at the [[Edinburgh City Chambers|City Chambers, Edinburgh]], which may represent [[Charles Edward Stuart]] or [[Louis XV]].&lt;ref name=Clifford1991pp12-14&gt;Clifford, "Introduction", pp.&amp;nbsp;13–14.&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Tassie]] (1735–99) was born in Glasgow and trained as a stonemason. He attended the Foulis Academy, before moving to Dublin and then London. He developed a formula for making casts in [[Soft-paste porcelain|vitreous paste]] and manufactured casts of antique [[carved gems]]. He also produced portrait medallions and among his sitters were many leading figures in Scottish intellectual life, such as [[Adam Smith]], [[David Hume]] and [[Henry Raeburn]]. His medallions were popular when produced in [[Wedgwood]] [[jasper]] and were used by the Carron Company to be cast in iron.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford, "Introduction", p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Spontaneous symmetry breaking from an instable equilibrium.svg|thumb|A ball is initially located at the top of the central hill (C). This position is an unstable equilibrium: a very small perturbation will cause it to fall to one of the two stable wells left (L) or (R). Even if the hill is symmetric and there is no reason for the ball to fall on either side, the observed final state is not symmetric.]]

In [[physics]], '''symmetry breaking''' is a [[phenomenon]] in which (infinitesimally) small [[Quantum fluctuation|fluctuation]]s acting on a [[system]] crossing a [[critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]] decide the system's fate, by determining which branch of a [[Bifurcation theory|bifurcation]] is taken. To an outside observer unaware of the fluctuations (or "[[Thermal noise|noise]]"), the choice will appear arbitrary. This process is called [[symmetry (physics)|symmetry]] "breaking", because such transitions usually bring the system from a symmetric but [[randomness|disorderly]] [[Quantum state|state]] into one or more definite states. Symmetry breaking is thought to play a major role in [[pattern formation]].

In 1972, [[Nobel prize in physics|Nobel laureate]] [[Philip Warren Anderson|P.W. Anderson]] used the idea of symmetry breaking to show some of the drawbacks of [[reductionism]] in his paper titled "More is different" in [[Science (journal)|''Science'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Anderson | first=P.W. | title=More is Different | journal=Science | volume=177 | issue=4047| pages=393–396 | year=1972 | url=http://robotics.cs.tamu.edu/dshell/cs689/papers/anderson72more_is_different.pdf | doi=10.1126/science.177.4047.393 | pmid=17796623 | format=|bibcode = 1972Sci...177..393A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Symmetry breaking can be distinguished into two types, [[explicit symmetry breaking]] and [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]], characterized by whether the equations of motion fail to be invariant or the [[Vacuum state|ground state]] fails to be invariant.

==Explicit symmetry breaking==

{{main|Explicit symmetry breaking}}

In explicit symmetry breaking, the [[equations of motion]] describing a system are variant under the broken symmetry.

==Spontaneous symmetry breaking==

{{main|Spontaneous symmetry breaking}}

In spontaneous symmetry breaking, the [[equations of motion]] of the system are invariant, but the system is not because the background ([[spacetime]]) of the system, its [[Vacuum state|vacuum]], is non-invariant. Such a symmetry breaking is parametrized by an [[order parameter]]. A special case of this type of symmetry breaking is [[dynamical symmetry breaking]].

== Examples ==

Symmetry breaking can cover any of the following scenarios:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/stars5/astroinfo/gloss/s.html|title=Astronomical Glossary|author=|date=|website=www.angelfire.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* The breaking of an exact symmetry of the underlying laws of physics by the random formation of some structure; 
:* A situation in physics in which a [[ground state|minimal energy state]] has less symmetry than the system itself; 
:* Situations where the actual state of the system does not reflect the underlying symmetries of the dynamics because the manifestly symmetric state is unstable (stability is gained at the cost of [[local property|local]] asymmetry); 
:* Situations where the equations of a theory may have certain symmetries, though their solutions may not (the symmetries are "hidden").

One of the first cases of broken symmetry discussed in the physics literature is related to the form taken by a uniformly rotating body of [[Incompressible flow|incompressible fluid]] in [[gravitational]] and [[hydrostatic equilibrium]]. [[Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi|Jacobi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Jacobi | first=C.G.J. | title=Über die figur des gleichgewichts | journal=[[Annalen der Physik und Chemie]] | issue=33| pages=229–238 | year=1834}}&lt;/ref&gt; and soon later [[Liouville]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Liouville | first=J. | title=Sur la figure d'une masse fluide homogène, en équilibre et douée d'un mouvement de rotation| journal=Journal de l'École Polytechnique | issue=14| pages=289–296 | year=1834}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1834, discussed the fact that a tri-axial ellipsoid was an equilibrium solution for this problem when the kinetic energy compared to the gravitational energy of the rotating body exceeded a certain critical value. The axial symmetry presented by the McLaurin spheroids is broken at this bifurcation point. Furthermore, above this bifurcation point, and for constant angular momentum, the solutions that minimize the kinetic energy are the ''non''-axially symmetric [[Jacobi ellipsoid]]s instead of the [[Maclaurin spheroid]]s.

The '''Talbot''' was a  type of white [[hunting dog]]. It is now [[Extinction|extinct]] and has been credited with being an ancestor of the modern [[beagle]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buzzle.com/articles/the-beagle.html |title=The Beagle |publisher=Buzzle.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[bloodhound]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bloodhounds.org.uk/History/60.htm#VI |title=Mac Barwick's History: Chapter VI |publisher=Bloodhounds.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''talbot'' is used in [[heraldry]] to refer to a good-mannered hunting dog.

== History ==
[[Image:Cartercrest.jpg|thumb|[[Carter-Campbell of Possil|Carter of Castle Martin]] Crest: a talbot standing above a crown]]
The breed has been said to have originated in Normandy, perhaps to have been the white [[Bloodhound#History|St. Hubert Hound]], and to have been brought to England by [[William the Conqueror]], but this is not supported by evidence. There are no known references to the talbot as a breed of hound in Medieval French, and none have been found in English before the mid-16th century.

In Medieval times, "Talbot" was a common name for an individual hound, so used before 1400 in [[Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Nun's Priest's Tale]]'' (l 3383), and used as an example of a hound name in a 16th-century book of hunting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/turbervilesbook00turbgoog |title=Turberville, George (1575) '&amp;#39;The Noble Art of Venerie or Huntyng'&amp;#39; |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 17th century it clearly existed as a breed or type. Large, heavy, slow hounds were 'talbot-like', whatever their colour, though the 'milk white' was 'the true talbot'.&lt;ref name=Markham&gt;{{cite book|last1=Markham |first1=Gervaise |title=Country Contentments or the Husbandman's Recreations |year=1605}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Somervile]] in his poem "The Chase",&lt;ref name=Chase&gt;{{cite book|last1=Somerville|first1=William |title=The Chase Book 1 Ll282-335 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C2wgAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=1735}}&lt;/ref&gt; published 1735, describes the former use of "[[limier|lime-hounds]]" (leashe hounds) on the Scottish Borders to catch thieves, obviously referring to the bloodhound and the [[sleuth hound]], but adding that the (white) talbot was the "prime" example of this type of hound.

The origin of both the name and the animal is uncertain. In a quotation from about 1449, the king referred to [[John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury]] as "Talbott, oure good dogge", perhaps as a play on his name, or in allusion to the family badge.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford English Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; In an MS in the British Library&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/TourPopupMax.asp?TourID=136 |title=The British Library Catalogue of Illuminated Manuscripts |publisher=Bl.uk |date=2003-11-30 |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Talbot is shown presenting a Book of Romances to [[Margaret of Anjou|Queen Margaret]], with a white dog standing behind him, which serves, symbolically, to identify him. It is obviously a small hound, and it seems unlikely that it could have been used in this way if "Talbot" had been associated in the mind of the people of the time with a large animal.

[[File:Talbot Hounds Fountain in Trevelyan Square, Leeds (4134319142).jpg|thumb|left|Talbot Hounds Fountain in Trevelyan Square, [[Leeds]]]]

The talbot and the greyhound were, apparently, the only [[Hound (heraldry)|hounds]] used in [[English heraldry]], and it could be that the talbot originated as an emblematic or heraldic hound.&lt;ref&gt;Lampson S. M. "The Mystery of the Talbot Hound" in ''Country Life'' 1965&lt;/ref&gt; References to this heraldic talbot seem to be earlier than any references to a real dog.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford English Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; The talbot figures in many [[Coats of Arms]], for instance in later ones of the earls of Shrewsbury, in which two talbots appear as [[supporter]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hereditarytitles.com/Page24.html |title=Earl of Shrewsbury |publisher=Hereditarytitles.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130125225710/http://www.hereditarytitles.com/Page24.html |archivedate=2013-01-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;[http://www.rotherhamweb.co.uk/h/shrewsbury.htm]

It is quite a plausible idea that from these beginnings the name "talbot" was extended to any large heavy white scent hound, and from there helped to establish a breed or type. It was certainly similar to the bloodhound (and "white" is given as one of the colours of the bloodhound around the 16th and 17th centuries)&lt;ref&gt;Topsell, Edward  (1607), ''The History of Four Footed Beasts''&lt;/ref&gt; as regards size, and use as a leash-hound.&lt;ref name=Markham /&gt;

As earliest references to this dog are much later than those to bloodhounds it cannot convincingly be regarded as an ancestor of the bloodhound.

[[Image:BackTalbotInnSign.jpg|thumb|Unusual black Talbot on an Inn sign at Iwerne Minster, Dorset]]
The talbot seems to have existed as a breed, a little distinct from the bloodhound, until the end of the 18th century,&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Sydenham Teak (1800), ''Cynographia Britannica''&lt;/ref&gt; after which, like two other large breeds to which it may have been related, the [[North Country Beagle|Northern]] and the [[Southern Hound]], it disappeared. Some early dog-shows apparently offered classes for talbots, but they were never entered, and so were dropped.

== Cultural legacy ==
"The Talbot" (or "Talbot Arms") is most familiar as the [[pub names|name]] of some English inns or public houses, and it is usually depicted on the signs as a large white hound with hanging ears, sometimes with spots. This suggests that the talbot was quite well known at one time, as part of the idea of a sign was that it helped to identify the inn for the illiterate. 
An inn called ''The Talbot'' in [[Iwerne Minster]], Dorset, UK, showed as its sign a ''black'' dog, apparently the crest of the Bower family, who owned the manor from the late Middle Ages till 1876.&lt;ref name=Iwerne&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barrett |first1=Barry|title=Iwerne Minster St Mary's Church &amp; Village Story}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The market town of [[Sudbury, Suffolk]], in the east of the [[United Kingdom]] has a talbot on its town crest, which is also used for a local school and many local sports clubs. The dog is always depicted with its tongue protruding.

The arms of the Carter of Castle Martin family (see [[Carter-Campbell of Possil]]) include a talbot. The arms of the [[Earl Waldegrave|Earls Waldegrave]] is supported by two talbots.

Adding to this, [[Hampton High School (Allison Park, Pennsylvania) | Hampton High School]], a school from the [[Hampton Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania | township of Hampton]], from the small town of [[Allison Park]], [[Pennsylvania]], is the only high school in the United States that has the Talbot as its mascot.

==Plot synopsis==
A young woman named Marusia goes to a feast where she meets a kind, handsome and apparently wealthy man. They fall in love with each other and Marusia agrees to marry him. She also consents to her mother's directive that she follow the boy to discover where he lives and more about him. She follows him to the church where she sees him eating a corpse. Later the fiend asks her if she saw him at the church. When Marusia denies having followed him, he tells her that her father will die the next day. Thereafter, he continually poses the question and with each denial he causes another of her family members to die. Finally he tells her that she herself will die. At this point Marusia asks her grandmother what to do. Her grandmother explains a way by which Marusia can come back to life after she dies (a condition of which is that she cannot enter a church afterwards). On coming back to life she meets a good man whom she marries, however he does not like the fact that she will not go to church and eventually forces her to do so. Thus the Fiend discovers that she is alive and kills her husband and her son, but with the help of her grandmother, the [[Fountain of Youth|water of life]], and [[holy water]] she brings them back and kills the fiend.

'''''The Valkhof at Nijmegen''''' is an [[oil painting]] by [[Dutch people|Dutch]] artist [[Aelbert Cuyp]], likely painted between 1652 and 1654, during the [[Dutch Golden Age]]. It is currently part of the permanent collection in the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]].

==Description==
''The Valkhof at Nijmegen'' typifies the Dutch landscape. A small boat filled with fisherman wait to capture [[lobsters]]. Two fat cows sit at the bank of the river, with their herder and two guests. The herder's red jacket is the focal point, drawing the eye in and breaking up the muted tones of the rest of the painting. Across the river, the looming [[Medieval]] architecture is bathed in a warm golden light from the seemingly setting sun. Boats float peacefully down the water banks, not disturbing the water. A windmill pokes up from the cliff face. Small, chunky clouds hover peacefully over the bay. Overall, the feelings of peace and tranquility run through the painting, with the stillness of the cattle, people, and water all reflecting the peaceful nature of the painting.

==Historical information==
The town of [[Nijmegen]] was popular with artists during this time period. The city's Medieval history, with the Valkhof having strong patriotic ties. It was the stronghold of [[Gaius Julius Civilis]], an ancient hero who led the Batavians to revolt against the Romans during the 1st-century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nijmegen|url=http://www.livius.org/no-nz/nijmegen/nijmegen.html|publisher=livius.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During this time, it also paralleled the Dutch's rebellion against [[Spain]] and the [[Habsburg Empire]].

The scene is based on sketches that Cuyp took during this travels to Nijmegen in 1652, however, Cuyp transformed the landscape by using a warm glow, calling to mind [[Italy|Italian]] landscapes. He adopted this style, and it became his signature on his paintings. Later on, Cuyp's work has a profound impact on 19th-century landscape painters, including [[J.M.W. Turner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gallery Label for The Valkhof at Nijmegen|url=http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/valkhof-nijmegen-cuyp-aelbert|publisher=Indianapolis Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Because of the way that Cuyp painted his subjects bathed in light, it is hypothesized that he worked in [[Utrecht]], which took many of its artistic cues from [[Baroque]] Italy. Cuyp dated very few of his paintings, so the date range on this image is an estimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aelbert Cuyp|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/147660/Aelbert-Cuyp|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisition===
The painting's oldest provenance history has it in the hands of the Dukes of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, since at least 1826. It was sold in April 1937 to art historian/dealer Eduard Plietzsch. It was sold by the Galarie St. Lucas in Vienna in July of that year. ''The Valkhof'' became part of the John Herron Art Institute, now the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] in 1943, after a gift by [[Caroline Marmon Fesler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Provenance of The Valkhof at Nijmegen|url=http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/valkhof-nijmegen-cuyp-aelbert#mercury-tab-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hans Rottenhammer - Allegory of the Arts - WGA20147.jpg|thumb|[[Hans Rottenhammer]], ''Allegory of the Arts'' (second half of the 16th century). [[Gemäldegalerie]], Berlin.]]

'''The arts''' refers to the [[Aesthetics|theory]] and [[Art|physical expression]] of [[creativity]] found in human [[Society|societies]] and [[culture]]s. Major constituents of the arts include [[literature]] (including [[drama]], [[poetry]], and [[prose]]), [[performing arts]] (among them [[dance]], [[music]], and [[theatre]]), and [[visual arts]] (including [[architecture]], [[Ceramic art|ceramics]], [[drawing]], [[painting]], [[photography]], and [[sculpting]]). {{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Some art forms combine a visual element with performance (e.g., [[cinematography]]) or artwork with  the written word (e.g., [[comics]]). From prehistoric [[cave paintings]] to modern day [[films]], art serves as a vessel for storytelling and conveying humankind's relationship with the environment.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

==Definitions==
In its most basic abstract definition, art is a documented expression of a sentient being through or on an accessible medium so that anyone can view, hear or experience it. The act itself of producing an expression can also be referred to as a certain art, or as art in general. If this solidified expression, or the act of producing it, is "good" or has value depends on those who access and rate it and this public rating is dependent on various subjective factors. [[Merriam-Webster]] defines "the arts" as "painting, sculpture, music, theatre, literature, etc., considered as a group of activities done by people with skill and imagination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/the%20arts|title=Definition of The Arts|work=Merriam-Webster|language=en|access-date=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[United States Congress]], in the National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act, defined "the arts" as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.csulb.edu/~jvancamp/361_r8.html|title=Congressional definition of "the arts"|last=Van Camp|first=Julie|date=22 November 2006|website=PHIL 361I: Philosophy of Art|publisher=California State University, Long Beach|language=en|access-date=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=The term 'the arts' includes, but is not limited to, music (instrumental and vocal), dance, drama, folk art, creative writing, architecture and allied fields, painting, sculpture, photography, graphic and craft arts, industrial design, costume and fashion design, motion pictures, television, radio, film, video, tape and sound recording, the arts related to the presentation, performance, execution, and exhibition of such major art forms, all those traditional arts practiced by the diverse peoples of this country. (sic) and the study and application of the arts to the human environment.}}

==History==
{{main article|History of art}}

In [[Ancient Greece]], all art and craft was referred to by the same word, ''[[techne]]''. Thus, there was no distinction among the arts. [[Ancient Greek]] art brought the veneration of the animal form and the development of equivalent skills to show musculature, poise, beauty, and anatomically correct proportions. [[Roman Empire|Ancient Roman]] art depicted gods as idealized humans, shown with characteristic distinguishing features (e.g. [[Zeus]]' thunderbolt). In [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] and [[Gothic art]] of the [[Middle Ages]], the dominance of the church insisted on the expression of biblical and not material truths. [[Eastern art]] has generally worked in a style akin to Western medieval art, namely a concentration on surface patterning and local colour (meaning the plain colour of an object, such as basic red for a red robe, rather than the modulations of that colour brought about by light, shade and reflection). A characteristic of this style is that the local colour is often defined by an outline (a contemporary equivalent is the cartoon). This is evident in, for example, the art of [[Indian art|India]], [[Tibetan art|Tibet]] and [[Japanese art|Japan]]. Religious [[Islamic art|Islamic]] art forbids iconography, and expresses religious ideas through geometry instead.

===Architecture===
{{Main article|Architecture}}
[[File:Ac.parthenon5.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Parthenon]] on top of the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]], [[Athens]], [[Greece]]]]

Architecture is the [[art]] and [[science]] of [[design]]ing [[building]]s and [[structure]]s. The word ''architecture'' comes from the Greek ''arkhitekton'', "master builder, director of works," from ''αρχι-'' (arkhi) "chief" + ''τεκτων'' (tekton) "builder, carpenter".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=architect&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|title=architect (n.)|last=Harper|first=Douglas|date=2001–2016|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|language=en|access-date=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A wider definition would include the design of the built environment, from the macrolevel of [[town planning]], [[urban design]], and [[landscape architecture]] to the microlevel of creating [[furniture]]. Architectural design usually must address both feasibility and [[cost]] for the [[Construction|builder]], as well as function and [[aesthetics]] for the [[Consumer|user]].

[[File:Table of architecture, Cyclopaedia, 1728, volume 1.jpg|thumb|Table of architecture, ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]'', 1728]]

In modern usage, architecture is the [[art]] and [[discipline]] of creating, or inferring an implied or apparent plan of, a complex object or [[system]]. The term can be used to connote the ''implied architecture'' of abstract things such as [[music]] or [[mathematics]], the ''apparent architecture'' of natural things, such as [[geology|geological]] formations or the [[structural biology|structure of biological cells]], or explicitly ''planned architectures'' of human-made things such as [[software]], [[computers]], [[Enterprise architecture|enterprises]], and [[database]]s, in addition to buildings. In every usage, an architecture may be seen as a ''subjective [[Map (mathematics)|mapping]]'' from a human perspective (that of the ''user'' in the case of abstract or physical artifacts) to the [[Element (mathematics)|elements]] or components of some kind of [[structure]] or system, which preserves the relationships among the elements or components. Planned architecture manipulates space, volume, texture, light, shadow, or abstract elements in order to achieve pleasing [[aesthetics]]. This distinguishes it from [[applied science]] or [[engineering]], which usually concentrate more on the functional and feasibility aspects of the design of constructions or structures.

In the field of building architecture, the skills demanded of an architect range from the more complex, such as for a [[hospital]] or a [[stadium]], to the apparently simpler, such as planning [[residential]] houses. Many architectural works may be seen also as cultural and political [[symbol]]s, or works of art. The role of the architect, though changing, has been central to the successful (and sometimes less than successful) design and implementation of pleasingly built environments in which people live.

=== Ceramics ===
{{Main article|Ceramic art}}

Ceramic art is art made from [[ceramic]] materials (including [[clay]]), which may take forms such as [[pottery]], [[tile]], [[figurine]]s, [[sculpture]], and [[tableware]]. While some ceramic products are considered [[fine art]], some are considered to be [[Decorative arts|decorative]], [[Industrial design|industrial]], or [[Applied arts|applied]] art objects. Ceramics may also be considered [[Artifact (archaeology)|artefacts]] in [[archaeology]].Ceramic art can be made by one person or by a group of people. In a pottery or ceramic factory, a group of people design, manufacture, and decorate the pottery. Products from a pottery are sometimes referred to as "art pottery." In a one-person pottery studio, ceramists or potters produce [[studio pottery]]. In modern ceramic engineering usage, "ceramics" is the art and science of making objects from inorganic, non-metallic materials by the action of heat. It excludes [[glass]] and [[mosaic]] made from glass ''[[tessera]]e.''

===Conceptual art===
{{Main article|Conceptual art}}

Conceptual art is art in which the concept(s) or idea(s) involved in the work takes precedence over traditional aesthetic and material concerns.
The inception of the term in the 1960s referred to a strict and focused practice of idea-based art that often defied traditional visual criteria associated with the visual arts in its presentation as text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/c/conceptual-art|title=Conceptual art|publisher=Tate|access-date=14 May 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through its association with the [[Young British Artists]] and the [[Turner Prize]] during the 1990s,{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} its popular usage, particularly in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], developed as a synonym for all [[contemporary art]] that does not practise the traditional skills of [[painting]] and [[sculpture]].

===Drawing===
{{Main article|Drawing}}

Drawing is a means of making an [[image]], using any of a wide variety of tools and techniques. It generally involves making marks on a surface by applying pressure from a tool, or moving a tool across a surface. Common tools are [[graphite]] [[pencil]]s, [[Pen|pen and ink]], [[ink]]ed [[brush]]es, wax [[color pencil|colour pencils]], [[crayon]]s, [[charcoal]]s, [[pastel]]s, and [[marker pen|markers]]. Digital tools which can simulate the effects of these are also used. The main techniques used in drawing are line drawing, [[hatching]], crosshatching, random hatching, scribbling, [[stippling]], and blending. An [[artist]] who excels in drawing is referred to as a ''drafter'', ''draftswoman'', or ''draughtsman''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/draftsman|title=The definition of draftsman|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing can be used to create art used in cultural industries such as [[illustration]]s, [[comics]] and [[animation]].

===Painting===
{{Main article|Painting}}

[[File:Mona Lisa, by Leonardo da Vinci, from C2RMF retouched.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''[[Mona Lisa]]'', by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], is one of the most recognizable artistic paintings in the [[Western world]].]]

Painting is a mode of creative expression, and can be done in numerous forms. [[Drawing]], [[gesture]] (as in [[gestural painting]]), [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]], [[narrative|narration]] (as in [[narrative art]]), or [[abstraction]] (as in [[abstract art]]), among other aesthetic modes, may serve to manifest the expressive and conceptual intention of the practitioner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Perry|first1=Lincoln|title=The Music of Painting|journal=The American Scholar|date=Summer 2014|volume=83|issue=3|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paintings can be naturalistic and representational (as in a [[still life]] or [[landscape art|landscape painting]]), [[Photorealism|photographic]], abstract, narrative, [[symbol]]istic (as in [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist art]]), [[emotion|emotive]] (as in [[Expressionism]]), or [[Politics|political]] in nature (as in [[Artivism]]).

Modern painters have extended the practice considerably to include, for example, [[collage]]. Collage is not painting in the strict sense since it includes other materials. Some modern painters incorporate different materials such as [[sand]], [[cement]], [[straw]], [[wood]] or strands of hair for their [[Texture (painting)|artwork texture]]. Examples of this are the works of [[Elito Circa]], [[Jean Dubuffet]] or [[Anselm Kiefer]].

===Photography===
{{Main article|Fine art photography}}

Photography as an art form refers to photographs that are created in accordance with the creative vision of the photographer. Art photography stands in contrast to [[photojournalism]], which provides a visual account for news events, and commercial photography, the primary focus of which is to advertise products or services.

===Sculpture===
{{Main article|Sculpture}}

'''Sculpture''' is the branch of the [[visual arts]] that operates in three dimensions. It is one of the [[plastic arts]]. Durable sculptural processes originally used [[carving]] (the removal of material) and modelling (the addition of material, as clay), in [[stone]], [[metal]], [[ceramic art|ceramics]], [[wood]] and other materials; but since [[modernism]], shifts in sculptural process led to an almost complete freedom of materials and process. A wide variety of materials may be worked by removal such as carving, assembled by [[welding]] or modelling, or [[Molding (process)|moulded]], or [[Casting|cast]].

==Literary arts==
{{Main article|Language|Literature}}
{{Listen|filename=Sonnet18.ogg|title=Sonnet 18|description= '''''[[Sonnet 18]]''''' by [[William Shakespeare]] part of the Fair Youth [[Sonnet sequence|sequence]] of [[sonnet]]s.|format=[[Ogg]]}}

Literature is literally "acquaintance with letters" as in the first sense given in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''. The noun "literature" comes from the [[Latin]] word ''littera'' meaning "an individual written character ([[Letter (alphabet)|letter]])." The term has generally come to identify a collection of [[writing]]s, which in Western culture are mainly [[prose]] (both [[fiction]] and [[non-fiction]]), [[drama]] and [[poetry]]. In much, if not all of the world, the artistic linguistic expression can be [[oral literature|oral]] as well, and include such [[genre]]s as [[Epic poetry|epic]], [[legend]], [[Mythology|myth]], [[ballad]], other forms of oral [[poetry]], and as [[Folklore|folktale]]. [[Comics]], the combination of drawings or other visual arts with narrating literature, are often called the "[[ninth art]]" (le neuvième art) in Francophone scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reading bande dessinée : critical approaches to French-language comic strip|last=Miller|first=Ann|year=2007|isbn=9781841501772|oclc=939254581|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performing arts==
{{Main article|Performing arts}}

Performing arts comprise [[dance]], [[music]], [[theatre]], [[opera]], [[mime]], and other art forms in which a human performance is the principal product. Performing arts are distinguished by this performance element in contrast with disciplines such as visual and literary arts where the product is an object that does not require a performance to be observed and experienced. Each discipline in the performing arts is temporal in nature, meaning the product is performed over a period of time. Products are broadly categorized as being either repeatable (for example, by script or score) or improvised for each performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford companion to philosophy|last=Honderich|first=Ted|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=en|isbn=9780199264797|oclc=180031201|doi=10.1093/acref/9780199264797.001.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists who participate in these arts in front of an audience are called ''performers'', including [[actor]]s, [[Magic (illusion)|magicians]], [[comedian]]s, [[dancer]]s, [[musician]]s, and [[singer]]s. Performing arts are also supported by the services of other artists or essential workers, such as [[songwriting]] and [[stagecraft]]. Performers often adapt their [[physical appearance|appearance]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;with tools such as [[costume]] and [[Theatrical makeup|stage makeup]].

===Music===
{{Main article|Music}}
[[File:MozartExcerptK331.svg|thumb|A musical score by [[Mozart]]. {{audio|MozartExcerptK331.mid|Play}}]]

Music is an art form whose [[Media (arts)|medium]] is sound and silence, occurring in time. Common elements of music are [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] (which governs melody and harmony), [[rhythm]] (and its associated concepts tempo, metre, and articulation), dynamics, and the sonic qualities of [[timbre]] and [[texture (music)|texture]]. The creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of music vary according to culture and social context. Music ranges from strictly organized compositions (and their reproduction in performance) through improvisational music to [[Aleatoric music|aleatoric pieces]]. Music can be divided into genres and subgenres, although the dividing lines and relationships between music genres are often subtle, sometimes open to individual interpretation, and occasionally controversial. Within "the arts," music may be classified as a [[performing art]], a [[fine art]], and [[auditory art]].

===Theatre===
{{Main article|Theatre}}

Theatre or theater (from Greek ''theatron'' (''θέατρον)''; from ''theasthai'', "behold")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=theater&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|title=theater (n.)|last=Harper|first=Douglas|date=2001–2016|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|language=en|access-date=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the branch of the [[performing arts]] concerned with [[acting]] out stories in front of an audience using combinations of speech, gesture, music, dance, sound and spectacle – indeed, any one or more elements of the other performing arts. In addition to the standard narrative dialogue style, theatre takes such forms as [[opera]], [[ballet]], [[mime artist|mime]], [[kabuki]], [[classical Indian dance]], [[Chinese opera]] and [[Mummers Play|mummers' plays]].

===Dance===
[[File:Ballroom dance exhibition.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[ballroom]] dance exhibition]]
{{Main article|Dance}}

[[Dance]] (from [[Old French]] ''dancier'', of unknown origin)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=dance&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|title=dance (n.)|last=Harper|first=Douglas|date=2001–2016|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|language=en|access-date=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; generally refers to human [[Motion (physics)|movement]] either used as a form of expression or presented in a [[social]], [[spirituality|spiritual]] or [[performance]] setting. ''Dance'' is also used to describe methods of [[non-verbal communication]] (see [[body language]]) between humans or [[animal]]s (e.g. [[Bee Dance language|bee dance]], [[Courtship display|mating dance]]), [[Motion (physics)|motion]] in inanimate objects (e.g. ''the leaves danced in the wind''), and certain [[dance (music)|musical forms]] or [[music|genres]]. [[Choreography]] is the art of making dances, and the person who does this is called a choreographer. Definitions of what constitutes dance are dependent on [[Society|social]], [[Culture|cultural]], [[aesthetic]], [[artistic]] and [[moral]] constraints and range from functional movement (such as [[Folk dance]]) to codified, [[virtuoso]] techniques such as [[ballet]]. In [[sport]]s, [[gymnastics]], [[figure skating]] and [[synchronized swimming]] are dance disciplines while [[Martial arts]] "[[Kata (martial arts)|kata]]" are often compared to dances.

==Multidisciplinary artistic works==
Areas exist in which artistic works incorporate multiple artistic fields, such as [[film]], [[opera]] and [[Performance Art|performance art]]. While opera is often categorized in the performing arts of music, the word itself is Italian for "works", because opera combines several artistic disciplines in a singular artistic experience. In a typical traditional [[opera]], the entire work utilizes the following: the sets (visual arts), costumes (fashion), acting (dramatic performing arts), the libretto, or the words/story (literature), and singers and an orchestra (music). [[File:Ernestine Schumann-Heink as Waltraute.png|thumb|left|Ernestine Schumann-Heink as Waltraute]]The composer [[Richard Wagner]] recognized the fusion of so many disciplines into a single work of opera, exemplified by his cycle ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' ("The Ring of the Nibelung"). He did not use the term opera for his works, but instead [[Gesamtkunstwerk]] ("synthesis of the arts"), sometimes referred to as "Music Drama" in [[English language|English]], emphasizing the literary and theatrical components which were as important as the music. Classical [[ballet]] is another form which emerged in the 17th century in which orchestral music is combined with dance.

Other works in the late 19th, 20th and 21st centuries have fused other disciplines in unique and creative ways, such as [[Performance Art|performance art]]. Performance art is a performance over time which combines any number of instruments, objects, and art within a predefined or less well-defined structure, some of which can be improvised. Performance art may be scripted, unscripted, random or carefully organized; even audience participation may occur. [[John Cage]] is regarded by many as a performance artist rather than a composer, although he preferred the latter term. He did not compose for traditional ensembles. Cage's composition ''[[Living Room Music]]'' composed in 1940 is a "quartet" for unspecified instruments, really non-melodic objects, which can be found in a living room of a typical house, hence the title.

==Other arts==
There is no clear line between art and [[culture]].  Cultural fields like [[gastronomy]] are sometimes considered as arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/new-face-french-gastronomy/ |title=The New Face of French Gastronomy - Knowledge@Wharton |publisher=Knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu |date=2013-12-20 |accessdate=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Applied arts===
{{Main article|Applied arts}}
The applied arts are the application of design and decoration to everyday, functional, objects to make them aesthetically pleasing.&lt;ref&gt;"applied art" in ''The Oxford Dictionary of Art''. Online edition. [[Oxford University Press]], 2004. www.oxfordreference.com. Retrieved 23 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The applied arts includes fields such as industrial design, illustration, and commercial art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/applied-art |title=Applied art &amp;#124; Define Applied art at |publisher=Dictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "applied art" is used in distinction to the fine arts, where the latter is defined as arts that aims to produce objects which are beautiful or provide intellectual stimulation but have no primary everyday function. In practice, the two often overlap.

===Video games===
{{See also|Video games as an art form}}
A debate exists in the fine arts and [[video game culture]]s over whether video games can be counted as an art form.&lt;ref name="an-art-world-for-artgames"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=12 December 2012|title=An Art World for Artgames|url=http://journals.sfu.ca/loading/index.php/loading/article/viewArticle/119|last=Parker|first=Felan|journal=Loading...|language=en|volume=7|issue=11|issn=1923-2691}}&lt;/ref&gt; Game designer [[Hideo Kojima]] professes that video games are a type of service, not an art form, because they are meant to entertain and attempt to entertain as many people as possible, rather than being a single artistic voice (despite Kojima himself being considered a gaming auteur, and the mixed opinions his games typically receive). However, he acknowledged that since video games are made up of artistic elements (for example, the visuals), game designers could be considered museum curators – not creating artistic pieces, but arranging them in a way that displays their artistry and sells tickets.

Within social sciences, cultural economists show how video games playing is conducive to the involvement in more traditional art forms and cultural practices, which suggests the complementarity between video games and the arts.&lt;ref name="video-games-and-arts"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2015|title=Video Games Playing: A substitute for cultural consumptions?|last1=Borowiecki|first1=Karol J.|last2=Prieto-Rodriguez|first2=Juan|journal=Journal of Cultural Economics|language=en|volume=39|issue=3|pages=239–258|doi=10.1007/s10824-014-9229-y|citeseerx=10.1.1.676.2381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, the [[National Endowment of the Arts]] included video games in its redefinition of what is considered a "work of art" when applying of a grant.{{fact|date=October 2018}} In 2012, the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] presented an exhibit, ''The Art of the Video Game''.&lt;ref name="an-art-world-for-artgames" /&gt; Reviews of the exhibit were mixed, including questioning whether video games belong in an art museum.

The '''Women's Caucus for Art''' (WCA), founded in 1972, is a [[non-profit organization]] based in [[New York City]], which supports women artists, art historians, students, educators, and museum professionals. The WCA holds exhibitions and conferences to promote women artists and their works and recognizes the talents of artists through their annual [[Women's Caucus for Art Lifetime Achievement Award|Lifetime Achievement Award]]. Since 1975 it has been a [[United Nations]]-affiliated non-governmental organization (NGO), which has broadened its influence beyond the United States. Within the WCA are several special interest causes including the Women of Color caucus{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}, Eco-Art Caucus&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalwca.org/membership/ecoarts.php|title=WCA Mission|website=www.nationalwca.org|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Jewish Women Artist Network&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalwca.org/membership/jwan.php|title=WCA Mission|website=www.nationalwca.org|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;, International Caucus&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalwca.org/membership/international.php|title=WCA International Caucus|website=www.nationalwca.org|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Young Women's Caucus&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalwca.org/membership/ywcaucus.php|title=Young Women's Caucus|website=www.nationalwca.org|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The founding of the WCA is seen as a "great stride" in the feminist art movement.

==Overview==
The Women's Caucus for Art membership includes artists, students, educators, art historians, and professionals from museums and galleries. The organization holds conferences, produces exhibitions, conducts research and [[Women's Caucus for Art Lifetime Achievement Award|issues awards]].&lt;ref name="Ferguson"&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=7CcOxVMl-9EC&amp;pg=PA203 Ferguson Career Resource Guide for Women and Minorities: Resources for women]''. Infobase Publishing; 1 January 2006. {{ISBN|978-0-8160-6131-0}}. p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the founding of the [[National Museum of Women in the Arts]], its creation is seen as one of the "great strides [that] have been made in developing an institutional infrastructure for women's art and art history since the 1970s."&lt;ref name="Ressler2003"&gt;Susan R. Ressler. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=keKW15lChagC&amp;pg=PA13 Women Artists of the American West]''. McFarland; 2003. {{ISBN|978-0-7864-1054-5}}. p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Background===
{{main|Feminist art movement in the United States}}
Within the broader [[feminist movement]] of the late 1960s and early 1970s, a [[feminist art movement in the United States|feminist art movement]] began to contest women's under-representation in professional art organizations, [[art exhibitions]] and [[art history]] textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=[[Grace Glueck]]|first=|title=Art People|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1978/01/27/110780534.pdf|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 27, 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement "was a major watershed in women's history and the history of art." Its slogan was "the personal is political."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Power of Feminist Art: The American Movement of the 1970s, History and Impact|year=1996|publisher=Harry N.

In 1969, Women Artists in Revolution (WAR) formed in response to the inclusion of “only 8 women among the 143 artists shown” at the Whitney Museum’s 1969 Annual. WAR “demanded that the museum change its policies to include more women artists.” In 1971, [[Linda Nochlin]]’s "Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?|url=http://www.artnews.com/2007/11/01/top-ten-artnews-stories-exposing-the-hidden-he/|journal=ArtNews|date=January 1971|volume=69|pages=22–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Judy Chicago]] and [[Miriam Schapiro]] started the Feminist Art Program at Cal Arts, which provided a new arts education for women based on mentorship, training in tools, research about women artists, consciousness-raising, and role-playing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Power of Feminist Art: The American Movement of the 1970s, History and Impact|year=1996|publisher=Harry N.

===College Art Association Women's Caucus===
At its annual conference in San Francisco, women within the [[College Art Association]] formed a women's caucus on 28 January 1972, electing [[Ann Sutherland Harris]] as the first president (1972-1974).&lt;ref name="Dickinson"&gt;Eleanor Dickinson, [http://www.nationalwca.org/wcadocs/TheHistory%20of%20the%20WCA.pdf The History of the Women's Caucus for Art]. Retrieved 7 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; However, tensions developed between this group and the CAA board, and in November 1973 the CAA executive asked "the Women's Caucus, which is not officially affiliated with the CAA, to drop the use of the phrase 'of the CAA' from its name."&lt;ref name="Ball2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Judith K.

===Women's Caucus for Art founded===
In 1974 [[Mary Garrard]], president of the caucus from 1974 to 1976, oversaw the formation of the Women's Caucus for Art (WCA) as an independent non-profit organization. [[Arlene Raven]], who, with [[Judy Chicago]] and [[Sheila Levrant de Bretteville]], founded the Feminist Studio Workshop of Women's Building, was also part of WCA's roots&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cotter|first=Holland|title=Arlene Raven, 62, a Historian and Supporter of Women's Art, is Dead|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/06/arts/06raven.html?pagewanted=print&amp;_r=0|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; as was Eleanor Dickenson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Love|first=Barbara|title=Feminists Who Changed America, 1963-1975|year=2006|publisher=University of Illinois Press|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The WCA grew, establishing regional chapters and publishing research on women's art. Membership broadened from predominantly art historians to a majority of women artists,&lt;ref name="Ball2010"/&gt; and the third president, Judy Brodsky, was herself an artist rather than art historian.&lt;ref name="Dickinson"/&gt;

In 1977 the [[Coalition of Women's Art Organizations]] (CWAO) was formed as a political arm of the WCA.&lt;ref name="Dickinson"/&gt;

==Organizational structure==
The Women's Caucus for Art is a national member organization with 23 regional chapters located throughout the United States. The headquarters, in New York City, is an umbrella organization governed by a national board of directors consisting of an executive committee (president, president elect, treasurer/secretary, vice president/chair of national exhibitions, past president/chair of legacy, vice president of chapter relations, vice president for organizational outreach, vice president for development and vice president of special events), regional vice presidents, standing committee chairs, directors (including chairs of internal caucuses)) and board-appointed advisors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About WCA - WCA Current Board|url=http://www.nationalwca.org/aboutwca/board.php|publisher=Women's Caucus for Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National President is voted in by the membership for two-year terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WCA Past Presidents|url=http://www.nationalwca.org/aboutwca/pastpresidents.php|publisher=Women's Caucus for Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; Half of the board is nominated by the incoming president and approved by the board, and the other half is voted in by chapter representatives.

Many of the regional chapters are organized as separate 501(c)3 non profit organizations. The Northeast Region consists of WCA New Hampshire, Central Mass WCA, WCA New York, and Philadelphia WCA. The Southeast Region consists of Greater Washington DC WCA, WCA Georgia, WCA Alabama, WCA Florida, and WCA Louisiana.

==Special-interest caucuses==
Within the WCA are several special interest causes including the Women of Color caucus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ringgold|first1=Faith|title=We Flew Over The Bridge|date=1995|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|location=Boston|isbn=0821220713|page=263|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eco-Art Caucus, Jewish Women Artist Network, International Caucus and the Young Women's Caucus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalwca.org/membership/internalcaucuses.php|title=WCA Internal Caucuses|website=www.nationalwca.org|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being appointed to Vice President of Minority Affairs by the President Ofelia Garcia in 1986, artist and activist [[Faith Ringgold]] proposed the formation of a women of color caucus. It was within this context that "Coast to Coast", an arts organization for women of color, was created.&lt;ref&gt;Ringgold 1995, pg. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jewish Women Artist Network (JWAN) was founded by Francia Tobacman. From 2006-2012 it organized national conferences of Jewish related themes. The International Caucus maintains WCA's involvement with the United Nations, develops art exhibitions related to the UN Goals, develops collaborative projects with other global organizations, collects data about WCA's art and activism projects, and shares this information with the larger WCA membership. The Young Women's Caucus supports women artists of who are college students, returning students and young professionals seeking to create a career in art.&lt;ref name="Ferguson" /&gt; It provides networking resources to established women artists within the broader organization.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Lifetime Achievement Awards==
{{main|Women's Caucus for Art Lifetime Achievement Award}}
In 1979 the WCA created the National Lifetime Achievement Awards. The goal was to acknowledge the work of notable women in the arts and stimulate the growth of opportunities within the arts. An important annual function, honorees are selected by a group of notable WCA scholars and artists. A few honorees include painter [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], painter [[Alice Neel]], art historian [[Lucy R. Lippard]], sculptor and painter [[Selma Burke]], and women's museum founder [[Wilhelmina Holladay]].&lt;ref name="Marter2011"&gt;[[Joan Marter|Joan M. Marter]].

==United Nations affiliation==
The Women's Caucus for Art has been a [[United Nations]]-affiliated NGO (non-governmental agency) since 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women's Caucus for Art Profile|url=http://esango.un.org/civilsociety/showProfileDetail.do?method=showProfileDetails&amp;tab=3&amp;profileCode=609794|publisher=NGO Branch, United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[NGO]] is "any non-profit, voluntary citizens' group which is organized on a local, national or international level. Task-oriented and driven by people with a common interest, NGOs perform a variety of service and humanitarian functions, bring citizen concerns to Governments, advocate and monitor policies and encourage political participation through provision of information."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ngo.org/ngoinfo/define.html|publisher=NGO Global Network |title=DEFINITION OF NGOs |deadurl=no |accessdate=11 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the liaison group between WCA and the United Nations, WCA's International Caucus members have participated in, and created exhibitions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Department of Public Information Non-governmental Organizations Conference |url=https://www.un.org/wcm/webdav/site/ngoconference/shared/Documents/Final%20Exhibits.pdf|publisher=UN Department of Public Information}}&lt;/ref&gt; side events at UN DPI/NGO conferences in support of UN goals and priorities and participated in UN Commission on the Status of Women conferences.

In the fall of 1995, the UN-sponsored Fourth World International Conference on Women was held in China. "The purpose of the conference was to discuss the advancement and involvement of women in world affairs." The WCA sent 100 women artists, art educators and art activists to attend conferences and workshops. "As a reaction to this expedition, the artists were asked to create works depicting their experiences. From this was born the exhibit Beijing and Beyond: Women Artists Respond To The World Conference On Women."&lt;ref name="Lemmon"/&gt;
