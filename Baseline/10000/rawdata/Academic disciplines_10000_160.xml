      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9696">'''American Water Works Association''' ('''AWWA''') is an international [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]], scientific and educational association founded to improve water quality and supply. Established in 1881, it has a membership (as of 2012) of around 50,000 members worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awwa.org/about-us.aspx|title=About Us - American Water Works Association|first=American Water Works|last=Association|website=www.awwa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reviewing the success of the [[Safe Drinking Water Act]] after 1974, senior EPA officials cite the vital role that AWWA played as kind of a non‐threatening meeting ground, particularly at the local level.&lt;ref&gt;EPA Alumni Association: Senior EPA officials discuss early implementation of the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974, [http://www.epaalumni.org/history/video/interview.cfm?id=13 Video], [http://www.epaalumni.org/userdata/pdf/6014106B36AE81EB.pdf#page=24 Transcript] (see p24).&lt;/ref&gt;

AWWA members include: water utilities, treatment plant operators and managers, [[scientist]]s, [[Environmentalism|environmentalists]], [[Manufacturing|manufacturers]], [[Academia|academics]], [[Regulatory agency|regulators]], and others with an interest in water supply and [[public health]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seametrics.com/blog/think-tank-awwa-focuses-on-water/ US Think Tank AWWA Focuses on Water], Accessed June 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.envirolink.org/resource.html?catid=5&amp;itemid=246 The EnviroLink Network - American Water Works Association], Accessed June 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; AWWA works through advocacy, communications, conferences, education and training, science and technology, and local action among 43 AWWA Sections throughout [[North America]].

AWWA launched AWWAIndia, its first international community, in 2015. AWWAIndia's headquarters office is located in Mumbai, India.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.awwa.org/publications/connections/connections-story/articleid/3904/a-new-day-dawns-in-indias-water-history.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Publications and conferences==
To broaden distribution of information on water and related subjects, AWWA publishes the periodicals ''Journal AWWA'' and ''Opflow.''  AWWA also publishes a variety of books, training manuals, standards, reports and videos for use by water professionals and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waterandwastewater.com/www_services/readingroom/awwa.htm AWWA-WEF Publications &amp; Books] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620140407/http://www.waterandwastewater.com/www_services/readingroom/awwa.htm |date=2012-06-20 }}, Accessed June 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.standardmethods.org/ Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater], Accessed June 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookfinder.com/author/american-water-works-association/ American Water Works Association - BookFinder.com], Accessed June 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Association also hosts an annual [[business conference|conference]] and exposition for the entire organization each summer in North America. Section conferences are also held in all parts of North America. Specialty conferences are held throughout the year on topics including water quality, distribution systems and utility management.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wef.org/conferences/page_details.aspx?id=8877 AWWA/WEF Information Management &amp; Technology Conference and Exposition] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504220709/http://www.wef.org/conferences/page_details.aspx?id=8877 |date=2012-05-04 }}, Accessed June 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Proceedings of the annual and specialty conferences are published by AWWA.

==Water industry resources==
Through the Partnership for Safe Water AWWA also works with the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] and other water organizations to help water providers optimize system performance beyond existing regulatory levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awwa.org/resources-tools/water-utility-management/partnership-for-safe-water.aspx|title=Resources &amp; Tools - American Water Works Association|first=American Water Works|last=Association|website=www.awwa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AWWA offers opportunities for people to meet, learn, and network at the international, national, and section levels. In addition to publications and conferences for water professionals, AWWA hosts a variety of workshops, symposia, teleconferences, and programs focused on specific aspects of water stewardship.  In cooperation with other professional associations, AWWA is a resource for water professionals’ continuing education and development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wwdmag.com/wef-awwa-launch-new-work-water-website WEF, AWWA Launch New 'Work for Water' Website] , Accessed June 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ihs.com/news/wef-water-security.htm ASCE, AWWA Release Security Standard Guidelines for Water/Wastewater Utilities], Accessed June 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
AWWA presents a number of awards every year to individuals who provide notable service to the drinking water community.  Among the major awards given are the [[Abel Wolman]] Award of Excellence, the [[George W. Fuller|George Warren Fuller]] Award, and the [[John L. Leal|Dr. John L. Leal]] Award.

==Water standards development==
In 1908, AWWA began developing industry standards for products, processes and best practices. The AWWA Standards Program is recognized internationally as a source for scientific and management reference resources for the water community. Currently, there are over 150 AWWA Standards covering [[filtration]] materials, treatment chemicals, [[disinfection]] practices, meters, [[valve]]s, utility management practices, [[storage tank]]s, pumps, and [[ductile iron]], [[steel]], [[concrete]], asbestos-cement, and [[plastic pipe]] and fittings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dot.ny.gov/main/business-center/consultants/forms-publications-and-instructions/engineering-information-issuance-system/eb-repository/eb01038.pdf ENGINEERING BULLETIN 01-038], Accessed June 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Standing committees periodically review and update the standards as required.

In May 1985, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] entered into a cooperative agreement with a consortium led by [[NSF International]] to develop voluntary third-party consensus standards and a certification program for all direct and indirect drinking water additives. Other members of the consortium include AWWA. The consortium is responsible for the cooperative effort of manufacturers, regulators, product users and other interested parties that develop and maintain the NSF standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nsf.org/business/newsroom/pdf/Std60-Brochure.pdf Certification Programs and Services for the Water Treatment and Chemicals Industry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513132637/http://nsf.org/business/newsroom/pdf/Std60-Brochure.pdf |date=2012-05-13 }}, Accessed June 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Water for People==
In February 1991, AWWA founded [[Water For People]], a non-profit international development organization that helps people in [[Developing country|developing countries]] improve their quality of life by supporting the development of locally sustainable drinking water resources, sanitation facilities, and health and hygiene education programs.

==Drinking Water Week==
For more than 35 years, AWWA has set aside a week in the spring to recognize the importance of safe drinking water throughout North America.  In 1988, AWWA brought the event to the attention of the US government and formed a coalition along with the League of Women Voters, the Association of State Drinking Water Administrators and the US Environmental Protection Agency. Subsequently, AWWA worked with Representative [[Robert Roe]] and Senator [[Dennis DeConcini]] to sponsor a resolution naming the first week of May as "Drinking Water Week."&lt;ref name="waterweek"&gt;[http://www.awwa.org/resources-tools/public-affairs/public-affairs-events/drinking-water-week.aspx "History of Drinking Water Week."] [http://www.awwa.org American Water Works Association]. Accessed January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, a joint congressional resolution declaration was passed and signed by President Ronald Reagan.&lt;ref name="waterweek"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Water treatment training|url=https://watertreatmentservices.co.uk/water/water-treatment-training/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sections==
AWWA is an umbrella organization for 43 sections, each of whom represents a specific geographic region. There are 37 AWWA sections in the United States, 5 Canadian sections, and one each in Mexico and Puerto Rico. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.awwa.org/membership/sections-your-local-awwa/section-services/section-map.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Biotic material''' or '''biological derived material''' is any material that originates from [[living organisms]]. Most such materials contain [[carbon]] and are capable of [[Decomposition|decay]].

The earliest [[origin of life|life on Earth arose]] at least 3.5 billion years ago.&lt;ref name="Origin1"&gt;Schopf, JW, Kudryavtsev, AB, Czaja, AD, and Tripathi, AB. (2007).

Examples of biotic materials are [[wood]], [[straw]], [[humus]], [[manure]], [[Bark (botany)|bark]], [[crude oil]], [[cotton]], [[spider silk]], [[chitin]], [[fibrin]], and [[bone]].

The use of biotic materials, and processed biotic materials ([[bio-based material]]) as [[alternative natural materials]], over synthetics is popular with those who are environmentally conscious because such materials are usually biodegradable, renewable, and the processing is commonly understood and has minimal environmental impact. However, not all biotic materials are used in an environmentally friendly way, such as those that require high levels of processing, are harvested unsustainably, or are used to produce [[greenhouse gasses|carbon emission]]s.

When the source of the recently living material has little importance to the product produced, such as in the production of [[biofuel]]s, biotic material is simply called [[biomass]]. Many fuel sources may have biological sources, and may be divided roughly into [[fossil fuels]], and [[biofuel]].

In [[soil science]], biotic material is often referred to as ''[[organic matter]]''. Biotic materials in [[soil]] include [[glomalin]], [[Dopplerite]] and [[humic acid]].  Some biotic material may not be considered to be organic matter if it is low in [[organic compounds]], such as a clam's shell, which is an essential component of the living organism, but contains little organic carbon.

Examples of the use of biotic materials include:

'''Cancer immunotherapy''' (sometimes called '''immuno-oncology''') is the artificial stimulation of the [[immune system]] to treat [[cancer]], improving on the system's natural ability to fight cancer. It is an application of the [[basic research|fundamental research]] of [[cancer immunology]] and a growing subspecialty of [[oncology]]. It exploits the fact that [[cancer cells]] often have molecules on their surface that can be detected by the immune system, known as [[tumor antigen]]s; they are often [[protein]]s or other macromolecules (e.g. [[carbohydrate]]s). [[Immunotherapy|Immunotherapies]] can be categorized as active, passive or hybrid (active and passive). Active immunotherapy directs the immune system to attack [[tumor]] cells by targeting tumor antigens. Passive immunotherapies enhance existing anti-tumor responses and include [[Monoclonal antibody|the use of monoclonal antibodies]], [[lymphocyte]]s and [[cytokine]]s.

Among these, multiple antibody therapies are approved in various jurisdictions to treat a wide range of cancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Korneev KV, Atretkhany KN, Drutskaya MS, Grivennikov SI, Kuprash DV, Nedospasov SA | title = TLR-signaling and proinflammatory cytokines as drivers of tumorigenesis | journal = Cytokine | volume = 89 | pages = 127–35 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 26854213 | doi = 10.1016/j.cyto.2016.01.021 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system that bind to a target [[antigen]] on the cell surface. The immune system normally uses them to fight [[pathogen]]s. Each antibody is specific to one or a few proteins. Those that bind to tumor antigens treat cancer. [[Cell surface receptor]]s are common targets for antibody therapies and include [[CD20]], [[CD274]] and [[CD279]]. Once bound to a cancer antigen, antibodies can induce [[antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity]], activate the [[complement system]], or prevent a receptor from interacting with its [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]], all of which can lead to cell death. Approved antibodies include [[alemtuzumab]], [[ipilimumab]], [[nivolumab]], [[ofatumumab]] and [[rituximab]].

Active cellular therapies usually involve the removal of immune cells from the blood or from a tumor. Those specific for the tumor are grown in culture and returned to the patient where they attack the tumor; alternatively, immune cells can be [[genetically engineer]]ed to express a tumor-specific [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]], cultured and returned to the patient. Cell types that can be used in this way are [[natural killer cell|natural killer (NK) cell]]s, [[lymphokine-activated killer cell]]s, [[cytotoxic T cell]]s and [[dendritic cell]]s. 

Role of DC-NK Cell Interplay in Immunobiology and Immunotherapy

==Cellular immunotherapy==
===Dendritic cell therapy===
[[File:Dendritic_cell_therapy.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Blood cells are removed from the body, incubated with tumour antigen(s) and activated.  Mature dendritic cells are then returned to the original cancer-bearing donor to induce an immune response.]]
Dendritic cell therapy provokes anti-tumor responses by causing dendritic cells to present tumor antigens to lymphocytes, which activates them, priming them to kill other cells that present the antigen. Dendritic cells are antigen presenting cells (APCs) in the mammalian immune system.&lt;ref name="pmid11481463"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Riddell SR | title = Progress in cancer vaccines by enhanced self-presentation | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 98 | issue = 16 | pages = 8933–35 | date = July 2001 | pmid = 11481463 | pmc = 55350 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.171326398 | bibcode = 2001PNAS...98.8933R }}&lt;/ref&gt; In cancer treatment they aid cancer antigen targeting.&lt;ref name="pmid23890062"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Palucka K, Banchereau J | title = Dendritic-cell-based therapeutic cancer vaccines | journal = Immunity | volume = 39 | issue = 1 | pages = 38–48 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 23890062 | pmc = 3788678 | doi = 10.1016/j.immuni.2013.07.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The only approved cellular cancer therapy based on dendritic cells is [[sipuleucel-T]].

One method of inducing dendritic cells to present tumor antigens is by vaccination with autologous tumor lysates&lt;ref name="pmid27235694"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hirayama M, Nishimura Y | title = The present status and future prospects of peptide-based cancer vaccines | journal = [[International Immunology]] | volume = 28 | issue = 7 | pages = 319–28 | date = July 2016 | pmid = 27235694 | doi = 10.1093/intimm/dxw027 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or short peptides (small parts of protein that correspond to the protein antigens on cancer cells). These peptides are often given in combination with [[adjuvants]] (highly [[immunogenic]] substances) to increase the immune and anti-tumor responses. Other adjuvants include proteins or other chemicals that attract and/or activate dendritic cells, such as [[granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor]] (GM-CSF).

Dendritic cells can also be activated ''[[in vivo]]'' by making tumor cells express GM-CSF. This can be achieved by either genetically engineering tumor cells to produce GM-CSF or by infecting tumor cells with an [[oncolytic virus]] that expresses GM-CSF.

Another strategy is to remove dendritic cells from the blood of a patient and activate them outside the body. The dendritic cells are activated in the presence of tumor antigens, which may be a single tumor-specific peptide/protein or a tumor [[cell lysate]] (a solution of broken down tumor cells). These cells (with optional adjuvants) are infused and provoke an immune response.

Dendritic cell therapies include the use of antibodies that bind to receptors on the surface of dendritic cells. Antigens can be added to the antibody and can induce the dendritic cells to mature and provide immunity to the tumor. Dendritic cell receptors such as [[TLR3]], [[TLR7]], [[TLR8]] or [[CD40]] have been used as antibody targets.&lt;ref name="pmid23890062" /&gt; Dendritic cell-NK cell interface also has an important role in immunotherapy. The design of new dendritic cell-based vaccination strategies should also encompass NK cell-stimulating potency. It is critical to systematically incorporate NK cells monitoring as an outcome in antitumor DC-based clinical trials &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Calmeiro J, Carrascal M , Gomes C, Falcão A, Cruz MT, Neves BM | title = Highlighting the Role of DC-NK Cell Interplay in Immunobiology and Immunotherapy | journal = Dendritic Cells, Intech | date = November 2018 | doi = 10.5772/intechopen.78804 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== Approved drugs ====
Sipuleucel-T (Provenge) was approved for treatment of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic castration-resistant [[prostate cancer]] in 2010. The treatment consists of removal of [[antigen presenting cell]]s from blood by [[leukapheresis]] and growing them with the [[fusion protein]] PA2024 made from GM-CSF and prostate-specific [[prostatic acid phosphatase]] (PAP) and reinfused. This process is repeated three times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gardner TA, Elzey BD, Hahn NM | title = Sipuleucel-T (Provenge) autologous vaccine approved for treatment of men with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic castrate-resistant metastatic prostate cancer | journal = Human Vaccines &amp; Immunotherapeutics | volume = 8 | issue = 4 | pages = 534–39 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 22832254 | doi = 10.4161/hv.19795 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Oudard S | title = Progress in emerging therapies for advanced prostate cancer | journal = Cancer Treatment Reviews | volume = 39 | issue = 3 | pages = 275–89 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23107383 | doi = 10.1016/j.ctrv.2012.09.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sims RB | title = Development of sipuleucel-T: autologous cellular immunotherapy for the treatment of metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer | journal = Vaccine | volume = 30 | issue = 29 | pages = 4394–97 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22122856 | doi = 10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.11.058 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shore ND, Mantz CA, Dosoretz DE, Fernandez E, Myslicki FA, McCoy C, Finkelstein SE, Fishman MN | title = Building on sipuleucel-T for immunologic treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer | journal = Cancer Control | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 7–16 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23302902 | doi = 10.1177/107327481302000103 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== CAR-T cell therapy ===
{{main|Chimeric antigen receptor}}
The premise of CAR-T immunotherapy is to modify T cells to recognize cancer cells in order to more effectively target and destroy them. Scientists harvest T cells from people, genetically alter them to add a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that specifically recognizes cancer cells, then infuse the resulting CAR-T cells into patients to attack their tumors.

==== Approved drugs ====
[[Tisagenlecleucel]] (Kymriah), a [[chimeric antigen receptor]] (CAR-T) therapy, was approved by FDA in 2017 to treat [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]] (ALL).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm574058.htm|title=Press Announcements - FDA approval brings first gene therapy to the United States|last=Commissioner|first=Office of the|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This treatment removes [[CD19]] positive cells (B-cells) from the body (including the diseased cells, but also normal antibody producing cells).

[[Axicabtagene ciloleucel]] (Yescarta) is another CAR-T therapeutic, approved in 2017 for treatment of [[diffuse large B-cell lymphoma]] (DLBCL).&lt;ref name="fda.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm581216.htm|title=FDA approves CAR-T cell therapy to treat adults with certain types of large B-cell lymphoma|publisher=fda.gov|date=2017-10-18|accessdate=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antibody therapy==
[[File:Engineered_monoclonal_antibodies.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Many forms of antibodies can be engineered.]]
{{main|Monoclonal antibody therapy}}
[[Antibody|Antibodies]] are a key component of the [[Adaptive immune system|adaptive immune response]], playing a central role in both recognizing foreign antigens and stimulating an immune response. Antibodies are Y-shaped proteins produced by some [[B cells]] and are composed of two regions: an [[Fragment antigen-binding|antigen-binding fragment (Fab)]], which binds to antigens, and a [[Fragment crystallizable region|Fragment crystallizable (Fc)]] region, which interacts with so-called [[Fc receptors]] that are expressed on the surface of different immune cell types including [[macrophages]], [[neutrophils]] and NK cells. Many immunotherapeutic regimens involve antibodies. [[Monoclonal antibody]] technology engineers and generates antibodies against specific antigens, such as those present on tumor surfaces. These antibodies that are specific to the antigens of the tumor, can then be injected into a tumor

===Antibody types ===

==== Conjugation ====

Two types are used in cancer treatments:&lt;ref name="pmid22437872" /&gt;

* Naked monoclonal antibodies are antibodies without added elements. Most antibody therapies use this antibody type.
* Conjugated monoclonal antibodies are joined to another molecule, which is either cytotoxic or [[radioactive]]. The toxic chemicals are those typically used as [[chemotherapy]] drugs, but other toxins can be used. The antibody binds to specific antigens on cancer cell surfaces, directing the therapy to the tumor. Radioactive compound-linked antibodies are referred to as radiolabelled. Chemolabelled or immunotoxins antibodies are tagged with chemotherapeutic molecules or toxins, respectively.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Fc regions ====
Fc’s ability to bind [[Fc receptors]] is important because it allows antibodies to activate the immune system. Fc regions are varied: they exist in numerous subtypes and can be further modified, for example with the addition of sugars in a process called [[glycosylation]]. Changes in the [[Fc region]] can alter an antibody’s ability to engage Fc receptors and, by extension, will determine the type of immune response that the antibody triggers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pincetic A, Bournazos S, DiLillo DJ, Maamary J, Wang TT, Dahan R, Fiebiger BM, Ravetch JV | title = Type I and type II Fc receptors regulate innate and adaptive immunity | journal = Nature Immunology | volume = 15 | issue = 8 | pages = 707–16 | date = August 2014 | pmid = 25045879 | doi = 10.1038/ni.2939 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many cancer immunotherapy drugs, including [[PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors]], are antibodies. For example, [[immune checkpoint]] blockers targeting PD-1 are antibodies designed to bind PD-1 expressed by T cells and reactivate these cells to eliminate [[tumors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Topalian SL, Hodi FS, Brahmer JR, Gettinger SN, Smith DC, McDermott DF, Powderly JD, Carvajal RD, Sosman JA, Atkins MB, Leming PD, Spigel DR, Antonia SJ, Horn L, Drake CG, Pardoll DM, Chen L, Sharfman WH, Anders RA, Taube JM, McMiller TL, Xu H, Korman AJ, Jure-Kunkel M, Agrawal S, McDonald D, Kollia GD, Gupta A, Wigginton JM, Sznol M | title = Safety, activity, and immune correlates of anti-PD-1 antibody in cancer | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 366 | issue = 26 | pages = 2443–54 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22658127 | pmc = 3544539 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1200690 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Programmed cell death protein 1|Anti-PD-1 drugs]] contain not only an Fab region that binds PD-1 but also an Fc region. Experimental work indicates that the Fc portion of cancer immunotherapy drugs can affect the outcome of treatment. For example, anti-PD-1 drugs with Fc regions that bind inhibitory Fc receptors can have decreased therapeutic efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dahan R, Sega E, Engelhardt J, Selby M, Korman AJ, Ravetch JV | title = FcγRs Modulate the Anti-tumor Activity of Antibodies Targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 Axis | journal = Cancer Cell | volume = 28 | issue = 4 | pages = 543 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 28854351 | doi = 10.1016/j.ccell.2015.09.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Imaging studies have further shown that the Fc region of anti-PD-1 drugs can bind Fc receptors expressed by tumor-associated macrophages. This process removes the drugs from their intended targets (i.e. PD-1 molecules expressed on the surface of T cells) and limits therapeutic efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Arlauckas SP, Garris CS, Kohler RH, Kitaoka M, Cuccarese MF, Yang KS, Miller MA, Carlson JC, Freeman GJ, Anthony RM, Weissleder R, Pittet MJ | title = In vivo imaging reveals a tumor-associated macrophage-mediated resistance pathway in anti-PD-1 therapy | journal = Science Translational Medicine | volume = 9 | issue = 389 | pages = eaal3604 | date = May 2017 | pmid = 28490665 | pmc = 5734617 | doi = 10.1126/scitranslmed.aal3604 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, antibodies targeting the co-stimulatory protein [[CD40]] require engagement with selective Fc receptors for optimal therapeutic efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dahan R, Barnhart BC, Li F, Yamniuk AP, Korman AJ, Ravetch JV | title = Therapeutic Activity of Agonistic, Human Anti-CD40 Monoclonal Antibodies Requires Selective FcγR Engagement | journal = Cancer Cell | volume = 29 | issue = 6 | pages = 820–31 | date = July 2016 | pmid = 27265505 | pmc = 4975533 | doi = 10.1016/j.ccell.2016.05.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, these studies underscore the importance of Fc status in antibody-based [[immune checkpoint]] targeting strategies.

==== Human/non-human balance ====
Antibodies are also referred to as murine, chimeric, humanized and human. Murine antibodies are from a different species  and carry a risk of immune reaction. Chimeric antibodies attempt to reduce murine antibodies' [[immunogenicity]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; by replacing part of the antibody with the corresponding human counterpart, known as the constant region. Humanized antibodies are almost completely human; only the [[complementarity determining regions]] of the [[variable region]]s are derived from murine sources. Human antibodies have been produced using unmodified human DNA.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harding FA, Stickler MM, Razo J, DuBridge RB | title = The immunogenicity of humanized and fully human antibodies: residual immunogenicity resides in the CDR regions | journal = MAbs | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = 256–65 | date = May–Jun 2010 | pmid = 20400861 | pmc = 2881252 | doi = 10.4161/mabs.2.3.11641 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Antibody-dependent_cell-mediated_cytotoxicity.png|left|thumb|Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. When the Fc receptors on natural killer (NK) cells interact with Fc regions of antibodies bound to cancer cells, the NK cell releases perforin and granzyme, leading to cancer cell apoptosis.]]

===Cell death mechanisms===

====Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC)====
[[Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity]] (ADCC) requires antibodies to bind to target cell surfaces. Antibodies are formed of a binding region (Fab) and the Fc region that can be detected by immune system cells via their [[Fc receptor|Fc surface receptors]]. Fc receptors are found on many immune system cells, including NK cells. When NK cells encounter antibody-coated cells, the latter's Fc regions interact with their Fc receptors, releasing [[perforin]] and [[granzyme B]] to kill the tumor cell. Examples include [[Rituximab]], [[Ofatumumab]] and Alemtuzumab. Antibodies under development have altered Fc regions that have higher affinity for a specific type of Fc receptor, FcγRIIIA, which can dramatically increase effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weiner LM, Surana R, Wang S | title = Monoclonal antibodies: versatile platforms for cancer immunotherapy | journal = Nature Reviews. Immunology | volume = 10 | issue = 5 | pages = 317–27 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 20414205 | pmc = 3508064 | doi = 10.1038/nri2744 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Seidel UJ, Schlegel P, Lang P | title = Natural killer cell mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity in tumor immunotherapy with therapeutic antibodies | journal = Frontiers in Immunology | volume = 4 | pages = 76 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23543707 | pmc = 3608903 | doi = 10.3389/fimmu.2013.00076 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Complement====
The [[complement system]] includes blood proteins that can cause cell death after an antibody binds to the cell surface (the [[classical complement pathway]], among the ways of complement activation). Generally the system deals with foreign pathogens, but can be activated with therapeutic antibodies in cancer. The system can be triggered if the antibody is chimeric, humanized or human; as long as it contains the [[IgG1]] [[Fc region]]. Complement can lead to cell death by activation of the [[membrane attack complex]], known as complement-dependent [[cytotoxicity]]; enhancement of [[antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity]]; and CR3-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Complement-dependent cytotoxicity occurs when antibodies bind to the cancer cell surface, the C1 complex binds to these antibodies and subsequently protein pores are formed in the cancer [[cell membrane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gelderman KA, Tomlinson S, Ross GD, Gorter A | title = Complement function in mAb-mediated cancer immunotherapy | journal = Trends in Immunology | volume = 25 | issue = 3 | pages = 158–64 | date = March 2004 | pmid = 15036044 | doi = 10.1016/j.it.2004.01.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alemtuzumab====
[[Alemtuzumab]] (Campath-1H) is an anti-[[CD52]] humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody indicated for the treatment of [[fludarabine]]-refractory [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]] (CLL), [[cutaneous T-cell lymphoma]], [[peripheral T-cell lymphoma]] and [[T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia]]. CD52 is found on &gt;95% of peripheral blood [[lymphocyte]]s (both T-cells and B-cells) and [[monocyte]]s, but its function in lymphocytes is unknown. It binds to CD52 and initiates its cytotoxic effect by complement fixation and ADCC mechanisms. Due to the antibody target (cells of the immune system) common complications of alemtuzumab therapy are infection, toxicity and [[myelosuppression]].&lt;ref&gt;Byrd JC, Stilgenbauer S, Flinn IW.

====Atezolizumab====
{{Main|Atezolizumab}}&lt;!--What is Duralumab? A type of Atezolizumab?--&gt;

[[Durvalumab]] (Imfinzi) is a human immunoglobulin G1 kappa (IgG1κ) monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) with the PD-1 and CD80 (B7.1) molecules. Durvalumab is approved for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who:
* have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy.
* have disease progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy.

====Ipilimumab====
[[Ipilimumab]] (Yervoy) is a human [[IgG1]] antibody that binds the surface protein [[CTLA4]]. In normal physiology T-cells are activated by two signals: the [[T-cell receptor]] binding to an [[antigen]]-[[Major histocompatibility complex|MHC complex]] and T-cell surface receptor CD28 binding to [[CD80]] or [[CD86]] proteins. CTLA4 binds to CD80 or CD86, preventing the binding of CD28 to these surface proteins and therefore negatively regulates the activation of T-cells.&lt;ref name="pmid21629286"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sondak VK, Smalley KS, Kudchadkar R, Grippon S, Kirkpatrick P | title = Ipilimumab | journal = Nature Reviews.

Active [[cytotoxic T-cell]]s are required for the immune system to attack melanoma cells. Normally inhibited active melanoma-specific cytotoxic T-cells can produce an effective anti-tumor response. Ipilumumab can cause a shift in the ratio of [[Regulatory T cell|regulatory T-cells]] to cytotoxic T-cells to increase the anti-tumor response. Regulatory T-cells inhibit other T-cells, which may benefit the tumor.&lt;ref name="pmid21629286" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21900389" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21294471" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid11244047" /&gt;

==== Nivolumab ====
{{Main|Nivolumab}}

==== Ofatumumab ====
[[Ofatumumab]] is a second generation human [[IgG1]] antibody that binds to [[CD20]]. It is used in the treatment of [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]] (CLL) because the cancerous cells of CLL are usually CD20-expressing B-cells. Unlike [[rituximab]], which binds to a large loop of the CD20 protein, ofatumumab binds to a separate, small loop. This may explain their different characteristics. Compared to rituximab, ofatumumab induces complement-dependent cytotoxicity at a lower dose with less [[immunogenicity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Castillo J, Perez K | title = The role of ofatumumab in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia resistant to previous therapies | journal = Journal of Blood Medicine | volume = 1 | pages = 1–8 | year = 2010 | pmid = 22282677 | pmc = 3262337 | doi = 10.2147/jbm.s7284 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang B | title = Ofatumumab | journal = MAbs | volume = 1 | issue = 4 | pages = 326–31 | date = Jul–Aug 2009 | pmid = 20068404 | pmc = 2726602 | doi = 10.4161/mabs.1.4.8895 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pembrolizumab ====
As of 2017, [[pembrolizumab]], which blocks [[PD-1|PD-1, programmed cell death protein 1]], has been used via intravenous infusion to treat inoperable or metastatic [[melanoma]], metastatic [[non-small cell lung cancer]] (NSCLC) in certain situations, as a second-line treatment for [[head and neck squamous cell carcinoma]] (HNSCC), after [[Platinum-based antineoplastic|platinum-based chemotherapy]], and for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with refractory classic [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]] (cHL).&lt;ref name=USlabel2016&gt;{{cite web|title=Pembrolizumab label |url=https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2017/125514s014lbl.pdf|publisher=FDA|date=May 2017}} linked from [http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf/index.cfm?event=overview.process&amp;varApplNo=125514 Index page at FDA website] November 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UKlabel2016&gt;{{cite web|title=Pembrolizumab label at eMC |url=https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/30602|publisher=UK Electronic Medicines Compendium|date=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Rituximab ====
[[Rituximab]] is a chimeric monoclonal IgG1 antibody specific for CD20, developed from its parent antibody [[Ibritumomab]]. As with ibritumomab, rituximab targets CD20, making it effective in treating certain B-cell malignancies. These include aggressive and indolent lymphomas such as [[diffuse large B-cell lymphoma]] and follicular lymphoma and [[leukemia]]s such as B-cell [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]]. Although the function of CD20 is relatively unknown, CD20 may be a [[calcium channel]] involved in B-cell activation. The antibody's mode of action is primarily through the induction of ADCC and [[Complement system|complement-mediated cytotoxicity.]] Other mechanisms include apoptosis{{Clarify|reason=Vague|date=April 2016}} and cellular growth arrest. Rituximab also increases the sensitivity of cancerous B-cells to chemotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Keating GM | title = Rituximab: a review of its use in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, low-grade or follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma | journal = Drugs | volume = 70 | issue = 11 | pages = 1445–76 | date = July 2010 | pmid = 20614951 | doi = 10.2165/11201110-000000000-00000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Plosker 2003 803–43"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Plosker GL, Figgitt DP | title = Rituximab: a review of its use in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia | journal = Drugs | volume = 63 | issue = 8 | pages = 803–43 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12662126 | doi = 10.2165/00003495-200363080-00005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Plosker 2003 803–43" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cerny T, Borisch B, Introna M, Johnson P, Rose AL | title = Mechanism of action of rituximab | journal = Anti-Cancer Drugs | volume = 13 Suppl 2 | pages = S3–10 | date = November 2002 | pmid = 12710585 | doi = 10.1097/00001813-200211002-00002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Janeway"&gt;{{cite book |last=Janeway |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles Janeway |first2=Paul |last2=Travers |first3=Mark |last3=Walport |first4=Mark |last4=Shlomchik |name-list-format=vanc |title=Immunobiology | edition = Fifth |publisher=Garland Science |year=2001 |location=New York and London |pages= |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?call=bv.View..ShowTOC&amp;rid=imm.TOC&amp;depth=10 |isbn=978-0-8153-4101-7}}{{page needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weiner GJ | title = Rituximab: mechanism of action | journal = Seminars in Hematology | volume = 47 | issue = 2 | pages = 115–23 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 20350658 | pmc = 2848172 | doi = 10.1053/j.seminhematol.2010.01.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cytokine therapy==
[[Cytokine]]s are proteins produced by many types of cells present within a tumor. They can modulate immune responses. The tumor often employs them to allow it to grow and reduce the immune response. These immune-modulating effects allow them to be used as drugs to provoke an immune response. Two commonly used cytokines are interferons and interleukins.&lt;ref name="pmid14708024"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dranoff G | title = Cytokines in cancer pathogenesis and cancer therapy | journal = Nature Reviews. Cancer | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 11–22 | date = January 2004 | pmid = 14708024 | doi = 10.1038/nrc1252 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Interleukin-2]] and [[interferon]]-α are cytokines, proteins that regulate and coordinate the behavior of the immune system. They have the ability to enhance anti-tumor activity and thus can be used as passive cancer treatments. Interferon-α is used in the treatment of [[hairy-cell leukaemia]], [[AIDS]]-related [[Kaposi's sarcoma]], [[follicular lymphoma]], [[chronic myeloid leukaemia]] and [[malignant melanoma]]. Interleukin-2 is used in the treatment of [[malignant melanoma]] and [[renal cell carcinoma]].

===Interferon===
[[Interferon]]s are produced by the immune system. They are usually involved in anti-viral response, but also have use for cancer. They fall in three groups: [[Interferon type I|type I]] (IFNα and IFNβ), [[Interferon type II|type II]] (IFNγ) and [[Type III interferon|type III]] (IFNλ). IFNα has been approved for use in [[hairy-cell leukaemia]], AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma, follicular lymphoma, [[chronic myeloid leukaemia]] and melanoma. Type I and II IFNs have been researched extensively and although both types promote anti-tumor immune system effects, only type I IFNs have been shown to be clinically effective. IFNλ shows promise for its anti-tumor effects in [[animal model]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dunn GP, Koebel CM, Schreiber RD | title = Interferons, immunity and cancer immunoediting | journal = Nature Reviews. Immunology | volume = 6 | issue = 11 | pages = 836–48 | date = November 2006 | pmid = 17063185 | doi = 10.1038/nri1961 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lasfar A, Abushahba W, Balan M, Cohen-Solal KA | title = Interferon lambda: a new sword in cancer immunotherapy | journal = Clinical &amp; Developmental Immunology | volume = 2011 | pages = 349575 | year = 2011 | pmid = 22190970 | pmc = 3235441 | doi = 10.1155/2011/349575 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike type I IFNs, [[Interferon gamma]] is not approved yet for the treatment of any cancer.However, improved survival was observed when [[Interferon gamma]] was administrated to patients with [[bladder carcinoma]] and [[melanoma]] cancers. The most promising result was achieved in patients with stage 2 and 3 of [[ovarian carcinoma]].The ''[[in vitro]]'' study of IFN-gamma in cancer cells is more extensive and results indicate anti-proliferative activity of IFN-gamma leading to the growth inhibition or cell death, generally induced by [[apoptosis]] but sometimes by [[autophagy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Razaghi A, Owens L, Heimann K | title = Review of the recombinant human interferon gamma as an immunotherapeutic: Impacts of production platforms and glycosylation | journal = Journal of Biotechnology | volume = 240 | pages = 48–60 | date = December 2016 | pmid = 27794496 | doi = 10.1016/j.jbiotec.2016.10.022 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interleukin===
[[Interleukin]]s have an array of immune system effects. [[Interleukin-2]] is used in the treatment of [[malignant melanoma]] and [[renal cell carcinoma]]. In normal physiology it promotes both effector T cells and T-regulatory cells, but its exact mechanism of action is unknown.&lt;ref name="pmid14708024" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Coventry BJ, Ashdown ML | title = The 20th anniversary of interleukin-2 therapy: bimodal role explaining longstanding random induction of complete clinical responses | journal = Cancer Management and Research | volume = 4 | pages = 215–21 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22904643 | pmc = 3421468 | doi = 10.2147/cmar.s33979 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Combination immunotherapy==

Combining various immunotherapies such as PD1 and CTLA4 inhibitors can enhance anti-tumor response leading to durable responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ott PA, Hodi FS, Kaufman HL, Wigginton JM, Wolchok JD | title = Combination immunotherapy: a road map | journal = Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer | volume = 5 | pages = 16 | year = 2017 | pmid = 28239469 | pmc = 5319100 | doi = 10.1186/s40425-017-0218-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mahoney KM, Rennert PD, Freeman GJ | title = Combination cancer immunotherapy and new immunomodulatory targets | journal = Nature Reviews.

==Research==

===Adoptive T-cell therapy===
[[File:Adoptive_T-cell_therapy.png|thumb|Cancer specific T-cells can be obtained by fragmentation and isolation of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes, or by genetically engineering cells from peripheral blood. The cells are activated and grown prior to transfusion into the recipient (tumour bearer).]]

Adoptive T cell therapy is a form of [[passive immunization]] by the transfusion of T-cells ([[adoptive cell transfer]]). They are found in [[blood]] and tissue and usually activate when they find foreign [[pathogen]]s. Specifically they activate when the T-cell's surface receptors encounter cells that display parts of foreign proteins on their surface antigens. These can be either infected cells, or [[antigen presenting cell]]s (APCs). They are found in normal tissue and in tumor tissue, where they are known as [[tumor infiltrating lymphocyte]]s (TILs). They are activated by the presence of APCs such as dendritic cells that present [[tumor antigen]]s. Although these cells can attack the tumor, the environment within the tumor is highly immunosuppressive, preventing immune-mediated tumour death.&lt;ref name="NatureRev2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Restifo NP, Dudley ME, Rosenberg SA | title = Adoptive immunotherapy for cancer: harnessing the T cell response | journal = Nature Reviews. Immunology | volume = 12 | issue = 4 | pages = 269–81 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 22437939 | doi = 10.1038/nri3191 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple ways of producing and obtaining tumour targeted T-cells have been developed. T-cells specific to a tumor antigen can be removed from a tumor sample (TILs) or filtered from blood. Subsequent activation and culturing is performed ''ex vivo,'' with the results reinfused. Activation can take place through gene therapy, or by exposing the T cells to tumor antigens.

As of 2014, multiple ACT clinical trials were underway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=John|last=Carroll|name-list-format=vanc|work=Fierce Biotech|date=December 2013|url=http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/novartispenns-customized-t-cell-wows-ash-stellar-leukemia-data/2013-12-09|title=Novartis/Penn's customized T cell wows ASH with stellar leukemia data}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=John|last=Carroll|work=FierceBiotech|date=February 2014|url=http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/servier-stages-entry-high-stakes-car-t-showdown-novartis/2014-02-18|title=Servier stages an entry into high-stakes CAR-T showdown with Novartis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Biotech’s Coming Cancer Cure: Supercharge your immune cells to defeat cancer?

Oncol. | date=April 2018 | pmid = 29688262 | doi = 10.1093/annonc/mdy139 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first 2 adoptive T-cell therapies, [[tisagenlecleucel]] and [[axicabtagene ciloleucel]], were approved by the FDA in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm574058.htm|title=FDA approval brings first gene therapy to the United States|publisher=fda.gov|date=2017-08-30|accessdate=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fda.gov"/&gt;

Another approach is adoptive transfer of haploidentical [[γδ T cells]] or  [[NK cells]] from a healthy donor. The major advantage of this approach is that these cells do not cause [[GVHD]]. The disadvantage  is frequently impaired function of the transferred cells.&lt;ref name="pmid = 24528541"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilhelm M, Smetak M, Schaefer-Eckart K, Kimmel B, Birkmann J, Einsele H, Kunzmann V | title = Successful adoptive transfer and in vivo expansion of haploidentical γδ T cells | journal = Journal of Translational Medicine | volume = 12 | issue =  | pages = 45 | date = February 2014 | pmid = 24528541 | pmc = 3926263 | doi = 10.1186/1479-5876-12-45 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-CD47 therapy===

Many tumor cells overexpress [[CD47]] to escape [[Immunosurveillance|immunosurveilance]] of host immune system. CD47 binds to its receptor [[Signal-regulatory protein alpha|signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPα)]] and downregulate [[phagocytosis]] of tumor cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jaiswal S, Chao MP, Majeti R, Weissman IL | title = Macrophages as mediators of tumor immunosurveillance | journal = Trends in Immunology | volume = 31 | issue = 6 | pages = 212–19 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20452821 | doi = 10.1016/j.it.2010.04.001 | pmc = 3646798 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, anti-CD47 therapy aims to restore clearance of tumor cells.

===Anti-GD2 antibodies===
[[File:GD2_ganglioside.png|thumb|The GD2 ganglioside]]
[[Carbohydrate]] [[antigen]]s on the surface of cells can be used as targets for immunotherapy. [[GD2]] is a [[ganglioside]] found on the surface of many types of cancer cell including [[neuroblastoma]], [[retinoblastoma]], [[melanoma]], [[small cell lung cancer]], [[brain tumor]]s, [[osteosarcoma]], [[rhabdomyosarcoma]], [[Ewing’s sarcoma]], [[liposarcoma]], [[fibrosarcoma]], [[leiomyosarcoma]] and other [[soft tissue sarcoma]]s.

[[File:11 Hegasy CTLA4 PD1 Immunotherapy.png|left|thumb|440x440px|Cancer therapy by inhibition of negative immune regulation (CTLA4, PD1)]]
[[Immune checkpoint]]s affect immune system function. Immune checkpoints can be stimulatory or inhibitory. Tumors can use these checkpoints to protect themselves from immune system attacks. Currently approved checkpoint therapies block inhibitory checkpoint receptors. Blockade of negative feedback signaling to immune cells thus results in an enhanced immune response against tumors.&lt;ref name="pmid22437870"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pardoll DM | title = The blockade of immune checkpoints in cancer immunotherapy | journal = Nature Reviews.

One ligand-receptor interaction under investigation is the interaction between the transmembrane [[programmed cell death 1]] protein (PDCD1, PD-1; also known as CD279) and its ligand, [[Programmed cell death 1 ligand 1|PD-1 ligand 1]] (PD-L1, CD274). PD-L1 on the cell surface binds to PD1 on an immune cell surface, which inhibits immune cell activity. Among PD-L1 functions is a key regulatory role on T cell activities. It appears that (cancer-mediated) upregulation of PD-L1 on the cell surface may inhibit T cells that might otherwise attack. PD-L1 on cancer cells also inhibits FAS- and interferon-dependent apoptosis, protecting cells from cytotoxic molecules produced by T cells. Antibodies that bind to either PD-1 or PD-L1 and therefore block the interaction may allow the T-cells to attack the tumor.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Granier C, De Guillebon E, Blanc C, Roussel H, Badoual C, Colin E, Saldmann A, Gey A, Oudard S, Tartour E | title = Mechanisms of action and rationale for the use of checkpoint inhibitors in cancer | journal = ESMO Open | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = e000213 | date = 2017 | pmid = 28761757 | pmc = 5518304 | doi = 10.1136/esmoopen-2017-000213 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first checkpoint antibody approved by the FDA was ipilimumab, approved in 2011 for treatment of melanoma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cameron F, Whiteside G, Perry C | title = Ipilimumab: first global approval | journal = Drugs | volume = 71 | issue = 8 | pages = 1093–104 | date = May 2011 | pmid = 21668044 | doi = 10.2165/11594010-000000000-00000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It blocks the immune checkpoint molecule [[CTLA-4]].

However, patients treated with check-point blockade (specifically CTLA-4 blocking antibodies), or a combination of check-point blocking antibodies, are at high risk of suffering from immune-related adverse events such as dermatologic, gastrointestinal, endocrine, or hepatic [[Autoimmunity|autoimmune]] reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Postow MA, Callahan MK, Wolchok JD | title = Immune Checkpoint Blockade in Cancer Therapy | journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume = 33 | issue = 17 | pages = 1974–82 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 25605845 | pmc = 4980573 | doi = 10.1200/JCO.2014.59.4358 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These are most likely due to the breadth of the induced T-cell activation when anti-CTLA-4 antibodies are administered by injection in the blood stream.

Using a mouse model of bladder cancer, researchers have found that a local injection of a low dose anti-CTLA-4 in the tumour area had the same tumour inhibiting capacity as when the antibody was delivered in the blood.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van Hooren L, Sandin LC, Moskalev I, Ellmark P, Dimberg A, Black P, Tötterman TH, Mangsbo SM | title = Local checkpoint inhibition of CTLA-4 as a monotherapy or in combination with anti-PD1 prevents the growth of murine bladder cancer | journal = European Journal of Immunology | volume = 47 | issue = 2 | pages = 385–93 | date = February 2017 | pmid = 27873300 | doi = 10.1002/eji.201646583 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time the levels of circulating antibodies were lower, suggesting that local administration of the anti-CTLA-4 therapy might result in fewer adverse events.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

====PD-1 inhibitors====
Initial clinical trial results with IgG4 PD1 antibody [[Nivolumab]] were published in 2010.&lt;ref name="pmid22437870" /&gt; It was approved in 2014. Nivolumab is approved to treat melanoma, lung cancer, kidney cancer, bladder cancer, head and neck cancer, and [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/19/business/food-and-drug-administration-immunotherapy-bladder-cancer.html|title=F.D.A.

[[Pembrolizumab]] is another PD1 inhibitor that was approved by the FDA in 2014. 
Keytruda ([[Pembrolizumab]]) is approved to treat melanoma and lung cancer.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Antibody [[BGB-A317]] is a PD-1 inhibitor (designed to not bind Fc gamma receptor I) in early clinical trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2016/06/05/846118/0/en/BeiGene-Presents-Initial-Clinical-Data-on-PD-1-Antibody-BGB-A317-at-the-2016-American-Society-of-Clinical-Oncology-Annual-Meeting.html|title=BeiGene Presents Initial Clinical Data on PD-1 Antibody BGB-A317 at the 2016 American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting|author=BeiGene, Ltd.|publisher=Globe Newswire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====PD-L1 inhibitors====
{{main|PD-L1 inhibitor}}In May 2016, PD-L1 inhibitor [[atezolizumab]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roche.com/investors/updates/inv-update-2016-04-11.htm|title=FDA grants priority review for Roche's cancer immunotherapy atezolizumab in specific type of lung cancer|last1=Roche}}&lt;/ref&gt; was approved  for treating bladder cancer.

====Other====

Other modes of enhancing [adoptive] immuno-therapy include targeting so-called [[intrinsic checkpoint blockade]]s e.g. [[CISH]]. A number of cancer patients do not respond to immune checkpoint blockade. Response rate may be improved by combining immune checkpoint blockade with additional rationally selected anticancer therapies (out of which some may stimulate T cell infiltration into tumors). For example, targeted therapies such, radiotherapy, vasculature targeting agents, and immunogenic chemotherapy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pfirschke C, Engblom C, Rickelt S, Cortez-Retamozo V, Garris C, Pucci F, Yamazaki T, Poirier-Colame V, Newton A, Redouane Y, Lin YJ, Wojtkiewicz G, Iwamoto Y, Mino-Kenudson M, Huynh TG, Hynes RO, Freeman GJ, Kroemer G, Zitvogel L, Weissleder R, Pittet MJ | display-authors = 6 | title = Immunogenic Chemotherapy Sensitizes Tumors to Checkpoint Blockade Therapy | journal = Immunity | volume = 44 | issue = 2 | pages = 343–54 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26872698 | doi = 10.1016/j.immuni.2015.11.024 }}&lt;/ref&gt; can improve immune checkpoint blockade response in animal models of cancer.

===Oncolytic virus===
An [[oncolytic virus]] is a virus that preferentially infects and kills cancer cells. As the infected cancer cells are destroyed by [[oncolysis]], they release new infectious virus particles or virions to help destroy the remaining tumour. Oncolytic viruses are thought not only to cause direct destruction of the tumour cells, but also to stimulate host anti-tumour immune responses for long-term immunotherapy.&lt;ref name=pmid27486853&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fukuhara H, Ino Y, Todo T | title = Oncolytic virus therapy: A new era of cancer treatment at dawn | journal = Cancer Science | volume = 107 | issue = 10 | pages = 1373–79 | date = October 2016 | pmid = 27486853 | pmc = 5084676 | doi = 10.1111/cas.13027 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid28589082&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Haddad D | title = Genetically Engineered Vaccinia Viruses As Agents for Cancer Treatment, Imaging, and Transgene Delivery | journal = Frontiers in Oncology | volume = 7 | pages = 96 | year = 2017 | pmid = 28589082 | pmc = 5440573 | doi = 10.3389/fonc.2017.00096 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid29329556&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marin-Acevedo JA, Soyano AE, Dholaria B, Knutson KL, Lou Y | title = Cancer immunotherapy beyond immune checkpoint inhibitors | journal = Journal of Hematology &amp; Oncology | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 8 | date = January 2018 | pmid = 29329556 | pmc = 5767051 | doi = 10.1186/s13045-017-0552-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The potential of viruses as anti-cancer agents was first realized in the early twentieth century, although coordinated research efforts did not begin until the 1960s. A number of viruses including adenovirus, reovirus, measles, herpes simplex, Newcastle disease virus and vaccinia have now been clinically tested as oncolytic agents. T-Vec is the first FDA-approved [[oncolytic virus]] for the treatment of melanoma.  A number of other oncolytic viruses are in Phase II-III development.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===Polysaccharides===

Certain compounds found in [[Medicinal mushrooms|mushrooms]], primarily [[polysaccharide]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, can up-regulate the immune system and may have anti-cancer properties. For example, [[Beta-glucans|beta-glucan]]s such as [[lentinan]] have been shown in laboratory studies to stimulate [[macrophage]], [[NK cells]], [[T cells]] and immune system [[cytokines]] and have been investigated in clinical trials as [[immunologic adjuvant]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Aleem E | title = β-Glucans and their applications in cancer therapy: focus on human studies | journal = Anti-Cancer Agents in Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 13 | issue = 5 | pages = 709–19 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 23140353 | doi = 10.2174/1871520611313050007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Neoantigens ===
{{Main|Neoantigen}}Many tumors express mutations. These mutations potentially create new targetable antigens (neoantigens) for use in T cell immunotherapy. The presence of CD8+ T cells in cancer lesions, as identified using RNA sequencing data, is higher in tumors with a high [[Tumor Mutational Burden|mutational burden]]. The level of transcripts associated with cytolytic activity of natural killer cells and T cells positively correlates with mutational load in many human tumors. In non–small cell lung cancer patients treated with lambrolizumab, mutational load shows a strong correlation with clinical response. In melanoma patients treated with ipilimumab, long-term benefit is also associated with a higher mutational load, although less significantly. The predicted MHC binding neoantigens in patients with a long-term clinical benefit were enriched for a series of [[tetrapeptide]] motifs that were not found in tumors of patients with no or minimal clinical benefit.&lt;ref name="SnyderMakarov2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Snyder A, Makarov V, Merghoub T, Yuan J, Zaretsky JM, Desrichard A, Walsh LA, Postow MA, Wong P, Ho TS, Hollmann TJ, Bruggeman C, Kannan K, Li Y, Elipenahli C, Liu C, Harbison CT, Wang L, Ribas A, Wolchok JD, Chan TA | title = Genetic basis for clinical response to CTLA-4 blockade in melanoma | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 371 | issue = 23 | pages = 2189–99 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 25409260 | pmc = 4315319 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1406498 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, human neoantigens identified in other studies do not show the bias toward tetrapeptide signatures.&lt;ref name="ss15"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schumacher TN, Schreiber RD | title = Neoantigens in cancer immunotherapy | journal = Science | volume = 348 | issue = 6230 | pages = 69–74 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25838375 | doi = 10.1126/science.aaa4971 | bibcode = 2015Sci...348...69S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[drama]], particularly the [[tragedies]] of [[classical antiquity]], the '''catastrophe''' is the final resolution in a poem or narrative plot, which unravels the intrigue and brings the piece to a close. In comedies, this may be a marriage between [[main character]]s; in tragedies, it may be the death of one or more main characters. It is the final part of a play, following the [[protasis]], [[epitasis]], and [[catastasis]].

The catastrophe is either simple or complex, for which also the [[fable]] and action are denominated. In a simple catastrophe, there is no change in the state of the main characters, nor any discovery or unravelling; the plot being only a mere passage out of agitation, to quiet and repose. This catastrophe is rather accommodated to the nature of the [[Epic poetry|epic]] poem, than of the tragedy.&lt;ref name="cyclo"&gt;{{1728}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In a complex catastrophe, the main character undergoes a change of fortune, sometimes by means of a discovery, and sometimes without. The qualifications of this change are that it be probable and necessary: in order to be probable, it must be the natural result or effect of the foregoing actions, ''i.e.'' it must spring from the subject itself, or take its rise from the incidents, and not be introduced merely to serve a turn.&lt;ref name="cyclo"/&gt;

The ''discovery'' in a complex catastrophe must have the same qualifications as the catastrophe itself, of which it is a principal part: it must be both probable and necessary. To be probable, it must spring out of the subject itself; not affected by means of marks or tokens, rings, bracelets, or by a mere recollection, as is frequently done both in ancient and modern times. To be necessary, it must never leave the characters it concerns in the same sentiments they had before, but still produce either love or hatred, etc. Sometimes, the change consists in the discovery, sometimes it follows at a distance, and sometimes results immediately from it; the last was used, for example, in ''[[Oedipus Rex]]''.&lt;ref name="cyclo"/&gt;

Among critics, it has long been debated whether the catastrophe should always end happily, and favorably on the side of virtue, or not; ''i.e.'' whether virtue is always to be rewarded, and vice punished, in the catastrophe. [[Aristotle]], for example, preferred a shocking catastrophe, rather than a happy one; in that regard, the moving of terror and pity, which is the aim of tragedy, is better effected by the former than the latter.&lt;ref name="cyclo"/&gt;

[[René Le Bossu]], a 17th-century French critic, divides the catastrophe, at least with regards to epics, into the unravelling, or ''[[denouement]]'', and the finishing, or ''achievement''; the latter of which he makes the result of the former, and to consist in the hero's passage out of a state of trouble and agitation, to rest and quiet. This period is but a point, without extent or duration; in which it differs from the former, which comprehends everything after the plot is laid. He adds, that there are several unravellings in a piece, each interconnected. The ''finishing'' is the end of the last unravelling.&lt;ref name="cyclo"/&gt;

In the twentieth century, [[John Ronald Reuel Tolkien|J.R.R. Tolkien]] distinguished between what he called the ''catastrophe'' and the ''[[eucatastrophe]]''. The eucatastrophe is a classical catastrophe with an unexpected positive outcome for the protagonist. This term was coined to distance itself from the vernacular use of the word 'catastrophe' to signify disaster (which gave the term negative connotations in everyday usage).

The aim is to rise standard of living with a reduced environmental impact.

Scientists and politicians use this terminology. For example, [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] said :

Our first goal is to find the way to achieve "clean" growth and I want to defend this idea here today. We haven't got to choose between saving the planet and growth. We need to have growth and save the planet. So we need a growth that consumes less energy and fewer raw materials.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7223">In music, a '''coda''' {{IPA-it|ˈkoːda|}} ([[Italian language|Italian]] for "tail", plural ''code'') is a [[passage (music)|passage]] that brings a piece (or a [[movement (music)|movement]]) to an end. Technically, it is an expanded [[cadence (music)|cadence]].  It may be as simple as a few [[bar (music)|measures]], or as complex as an entire [[section (music)|section]].&lt;ref&gt;Benward &amp; Saker (2009). ''Music in Theory and Practice: Volume II'', p.355. Eighth Edition. {{ISBN|978-0-07-310188-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|Coda (''It.'') (1) The tail of a note. (2) The bars occasionally added to a contrapuntal movement after the close or finish of the ''[[canto fermo]]''. (3) The few chords or bars attached to an infinite canon in order to render it finite; or a few chords ''not in a canon'', added to a finite canon for the sake of obtaining a more harmonious conclusion. (4) That closing adjunct of any movement, or piece, specially intended to enforce a feeling of completeness and finality.&lt;ref&gt;Stainer, John and Barrett, William Alexander (1898).

Novello.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==In classical music==

[[Image:Mozart- Coda- Sonata in C Major, K. 309, I.png|thumb|right|350px|Coda from [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart's]] [[Piano Sonata No. 7 (Mozart)|Piano Sonata no. 7 in C Major]], [[Koechel|K.]] 309, I, mm. 152–155 {{audio|Mozart- Coda- Sonata in C Major, K. 309, I.mid|Play}}.&lt;ref&gt;Benward &amp; Saker (2009), p.151.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The presence of a coda as a structural element in a movement is especially clear in works written in particular [[musical form]]s.  Codas were commonly used in both [[sonata form]] and [[Variation (music)|variation]] movements during the Classical era.  In a sonata form movement, the [[recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]] section will, in general, follow the [[exposition (music)|exposition]] in its thematic content, while adhering to the home [[key (music)|key]].  The recapitulation often ends with a passage that sounds like a termination, paralleling the music that ended the exposition; thus, any music coming after this termination will be perceived as extra material, i.e., as a coda.  In works in variation form, the coda occurs following the last variation and will be very noticeable as the first music not based on the theme.

One of the ways that [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] extended and intensified Classical practice was to expand the coda sections, producing a final section sometimes of equal musical weight to the foregoing exposition, development, and recapitulation sections and completing the [[musical argument]].  For one famous example, see the finale of [[Symphony No. 8 (Beethoven)]].&lt;ref&gt;For discussion of this coda, and of codas in general, see Rosen, Charles (1988) ''Sonata Forms'', 2nd edition.  New York:  Norton.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2012}}

===Musical purpose===
[[Charles Burkhart]] suggests that the reason codas are common, even necessary, is that, in the climax of the main body of a piece, a "particularly effortful passage", often an expanded [[phrase (music)|phrase]], is often created by "working an idea through to its structural conclusions" and that, after all this momentum is created, a coda is required to "look back" on the main body, allow listeners to "take it all in", and "create a sense of balance."&lt;ref&gt;Burkhart, Charles. "The Phrase Rhythm of Chopin's A-flat Major Mazurka, Op. 59, No. 2" in Stein, Deborah (2005). ''Engaging Music: Essays in Music Analysis'', p.12. New York: [[Oxford University Press]], {{ISBN|0-19-517010-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Codetta===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Piano Sonata No. 16 (Mozart)]] --&gt;
'''Codetta''' ([[Italian language|Italian]] for "little tail", the [[diminutive]] form) has a similar purpose to the coda, but on a smaller scale, concluding a section of a work instead of the work as a whole. A typical codetta concludes the [[Exposition (music)|exposition]] and [[recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]] sections of a work in [[sonata form]], following the second ([[modulation (music)|modulated]]) theme, or the closing theme (if there is one). Thus, in the exposition, it usually appears in the secondary key, but, in the recapitulation, in the primary key. The codetta ordinarily closes with a [[perfect cadence]] in the appropriate key, confirming the tonality. If the exposition is repeated, the codetta is also, but sometimes it has its ending slightly changed, depending on whether it leads back to the exposition or into the [[musical development|development]] sections.

==History==
'''Cauda''', a Latin word meaning "tail", "edge" or "trail" is the root of ''coda'' and is used in the study of [[conductus]] of the 12th and 13th centuries. The cauda was a long [[melisma]] on one of the last syllables of the text, repeated in each strophe. Conducti were traditionally divided into two groups, ''conductus cum cauda'' and ''conductus sine cauda'' ([[Latin]]: "conductus with cauda", "conductus without cauda"), based on the presence of the melisma. Thus, the cauda provided a conclusionary role, also similar to the modern coda.

==In popular music==
Many songs in [[Rock music|rock]] and other genres of [[popular music]] have sections identifiable as codas.  A coda in these genres is sometimes referred to as an "[[Conclusion (music)|outro]]", while in jazz, modern church music and [[barbershop arranging]] it is commonly called a "tag". One of the most famous codas is found in the 1968 single "[[Hey Jude]]" by [[The Beatles]]. The coda lasted nearly four minutes, making the song's full length at just over the seven-minute mark, and the single topped the U.S. [[Billboard charts|Billboard chart]] for nine weeks, tying it for the longest run at the top of the chart.

==In music notation==
[[Image:Coda sign.svg|right|thumb|75px|Coda sign]]

In [[music notation]], the '''coda symbol''', which resembles a set of crosshairs, is used as a navigation marker, similar to the ''[[dal segno]]'' sign. It is used where the exit from a repeated section is within that section rather than at the end. The instruction "To Coda" indicates that, upon reaching that point during the final repetition, the performer is to jump immediately to the separate section headed with the coda symbol. For example, this can be used to provide a special ending for the final verse of a song.

The ''coda'' sign is encoded in the Musical Symbols block of Unicode as U+1D10C MUSICAL SYMBOL CODA:&lt;ref&gt;[http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1D100.pdf PDF of Musical Symbols block from the unicode consortium]&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;#x1D10C;

'''Cometary knots''' are structures observed in several nearby [[planetary nebulae]], including the [[Helix Nebula]] (NGC 7293), the [[Ring Nebula]] (NGC 6720), the [[Dumbbell Nebula]] (NGC 6853), the [[Eskimo Nebula]] (NGC 2392), and the [[Retina Nebula]] (IC 4406).&lt;ref name=APOD&gt;{{Cite APOD|date=13 April 2008|title=Curious Cometary Knots in the Helix Nebula}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ODell&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.astrosmo.unam.mx/rmaa/RMxAC..15/PDF/RMxAC..15_odell.pdf|title=Knots in planetary nebulae|author=C.R. O'Dell|journal=RevMexAA|volume=15|pages=29–33|year=2003|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is believed that they are a common feature of the evolution of planetary nebulae, but can only be resolved in the nearest examples.&lt;ref name=ODell /&gt;  They are generally larger than the size of the [[Solar system]] (i.e. the orbit of [[Pluto]]), with masses comparable to that of the [[Earth]].&lt;ref name=APOD /&gt;&lt;ref name=Odell1996&gt;{{citation | title=Cometary Knots in the Helix Nebula | last1=O'dell | first1=C. R. | last2=Handron | first2=Kerry D. | journal=Astronomical Journal | postscript=. | volume=111 | page=1630 | date=April 1996 | doi=10.1086/117902 | bibcode=1996AJ....111.1630O | quote=Their masses of about {{solar mass|10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;}} would be more like those of our solar system planets ({{earth mass}} = {{val|3|e=−6|u=solar mass}}, {{jupiter mass}} = {{Val|9.6|e=−4|u=solar mass}}) than of our largest observed comets ({{Val|10|e=18|u=gms}}).
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The knots represent "the ionized 'skin' of a dense, dusty molecular globule" that forms a crescent-shaped structure where it is ionized and illuminated by the central star, with a trailing spoke or tail.&lt;ref name=Meaburn&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1996MNRAS.281L..57M|title=The global motions of the cometary knots in the Helix planetary nebula (NGC 7293)|author1=Meaburn, J. |author2=Clayton, C.

On the near side of the Helix Nebula, the central dusty globule of each cometary knot appears dark against the background of a central spherical shell that emits [[Doubly ionized oxygen|[O &lt;small&gt;III&lt;/small&gt;]]] 5007 [[Angstrom]] light.  Those on the far side do not obstruct this light source and so do not have this dark appearance.&lt;ref name=Meaburn /&gt;

== Relation to other photoevaporation flows ==

Cometary knots are one type of ionized [[photoevaporation]] flow, which is characteristically associated with planetary nebulae, but several other types of photoevaporation flows ([[proplyd]]s, [[cometary globule]]s, [[Elephant trunk (astronomy)|elephant trunks]], and [[champagne flow]]s) are known from [[H II region]]s such as the [[Orion Nebula]].  Cometary knots are described as more [[advection]]-dominated than the other varieties, which are [[Plasma recombination|recombination]]-dominated or dust-dominated.  The distinction can be made in terms of the formula for the "dynamic ionization balance within a photoevaporation flow", F&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ ''μn&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + αn&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;h''.  Here F&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt; is the "ionizing photon flux incident on the outside of the flow", μ is the "initial velocity of the flow", α is the "recombination coefficient", n&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the "peak ionized density in the flow", and h, which is approximately 0.1 r&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, is the "effective thickness of the flow".  In advection-dominated flows, ''μn&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' is greater than ''αn&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;h'', and most of the incoming photons reach the ionization front and ionize fresh gas.  In other flows, most photons fail to reach the ionization front, and instead balance recombinations in the flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/2001IAUS..205..272H|title=Title: Classification of ionized photoevaporation flows|author=Henney, W.

== Reports in more distant objects ==
Several structures have been described as cometary knots or [[cometary globule]]s that surround [[R Coronae Borealis]], which is a peculiar star described as potentially the result of a [[white dwarf]] merger or final helium shell flash that periodically dims due to a build-up of carbon dust surrounding it, acting as a 'natural [[coronograph]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/743/1/44/meta;jsessionid=EC354DAF84FB2F91B95476AD5F9A873B.c1|title=The circumstellar environment of R Coronae Borealis: white dwarf merger of final-helium-shell flash?|author=Geoffrey C.

{{Anthropology |theories}}

'''Cross-cultural studies''', sometimes called '''holocultural studies''' or '''comparative studies''', is a specialization in [[anthropology]] and sister sciences ([[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[economics]], [[political science]]) that uses field data from many [[Society|societies]] to examine the scope of [[human behavior]] and test hypotheses about human behavior and culture. Cross-cultural studies is the third form of cross-cultural comparisons. The first is comparison of case studies, the second is controlled comparison among variants of a common derivation,{{Clarify|date=January 2010}} and the third is comparison within a sample of cases. Unlike comparative studies, which examines similar characteristics of a few societies, cross-cultural studies uses a sufficiently large sample so that statistical analysis can be made to show relationships or lack of relationships between the traits in question. These studies are surveys of [[ethnography|ethnographic]] data.

Cross-cultural studies are applied widely in the [[social science]]s, particularly in [[cultural anthropology]] and [[psychology]].

==History==
The first cross-cultural studies were carried out by 19th-century anthropologists such as [[Edward Burnett Tylor]] and [[Lewis H. Morgan]]. One of Edward Tylor's first studies gave rise to the central statistical issue of cross-cultural studies: [[Galton's problem]]. In the recent decades historians and particularly historians of science started looking at the mechanism and networks by which knowledge, ideas, skills, instruments and books moved across cultures, generating new and fresh concepts concerning the order of things in nature. In ''Cross-Cultural Scientific Exchanges in the Eastern Mediterranean 1560–1660'' Avner Ben-Zaken has argued that cross-cultural exchanges take place at a cultural hazy locus where the margins of one culture overlaps the other, creating a "mutually embraced zone" where exchanges take place on mundane ways. From such a stimulating zone, ideas, styles, instruments and practices move onward to the cultural centers, urging them to renew and update cultural notions.&lt;ref&gt;Avner Ben-Zaken, "From "Incommensurability of Cultures" to Mutually Embraced Zones" in ''Cross-Cultural Scientific Exchanges In the Eastern Mediterranean 1560-1660'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2010)], pp. 163-167. {{ISBN|9780801894763}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern era of cross-cultural studies==

The modern era of cross-cultural studies began with [[George Murdock]] (1949).&lt;ref&gt;Whiting (1986:305)&lt;/ref&gt; Murdock set up a number of foundational data sets, including the [[Human Relations Area Files]], and the ''Ethnographic Atlas.'' Together with [[Douglas R. White]], he developed the widely used [[Standard Cross-Cultural Sample]], currently maintained by the [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] electronic journal [[World Cultures]].

The '''Dana/Spicer Model 44''' is an automotive axle manufactured by [[Dana Holding Corporation]] and is used extensively among automobile manufacturers and in the [[automotive aftermarket]] area as well. The Dana 44 was first manufactured in the 1940s and is still being manufactured today, both front and rear axle variants.  The Dana 44 has been manufactured as a [[beam axle]] and [[independent suspension]] for both front and rear axle setups. There are also different variations of the Dana 44. Over a dozen automobile manufacturers have made vehicles that have Dana 44 axles, including [[Jeep]] which currently manufactures [[Four-wheel drive]] vehicles that have both front and rear Dana 44 axles.

==Front Dana 44 solid axle==
The Dana 44 Front axle first saw use in the 1950s and still in use today. Dana 44 Front axles were known for utilizing [[locking hubs]] or a [[center axle disconnect]] system. However, a permanently locked-in Dana 44 is not uncommon. The Dana 44 has seen use in 1/4-, 1/2-, 3/4-, and 1-ton rated trucks. The Dana 44 was manufactured in [[kingpin (automotive part)|kingpin]] and [[ball joint]] variations, as well as closed and open knuckle variations.

==Independent front suspension (IFS) Dana 44 axle==
In the 1960s, Jeep used a unique Dana 44 IFS setup, that was short lived. In the 1980s and 1990s, Ford used a form of IFS known as "[[Twin Traction Beam]]" (TTB). This Dana 44 had no axle tubes but attached to the driver side traction beam, which also acted as a cover plate, and had "open air" axles which traveled through the beams to the spindles. The axles had u-joints to allow for the independent action of the beams. Individual pivot points for the beams at greater than center made each beam longer than half the overall width crossing in the middle. This allowed for an [[Independent suspension|independent front suspension]] design. Ford TTB Dana 44 axles all utilized [[locking hubs]]. The TTB set-up is based on Ford's highly successful Twin I-beam design on two-wheel-drive pick-up truck models.

==Rear Dana 44 solid axle==

===Dana 41===
The Dana 41 was the precursor to the Dana 44 and was used from the 1930s to the 1950s. The ring gear on the Dana 41 is nearly one inch smaller than a Dana 44.

===Dana 44===
The Dana 44 rear axle first saw use in the 1940s and is still in use today. The Dana 44 has a [[Gross axle weight rating|GAWR]] up to {{convert|3500|lb|kg|abbr=on}} and is a semi-floating type, having one bearing on the end of the axle shaft which carries the weight of the vehicle on the axle and also allows axle rotation.

There is an 8.9" diameter Dana 44 ring and pinion that is very different from the standard Dana 44. This ring and pinion is significantly stronger with a better pinion to ring gear tooth contact patch and angle. It was typically used in the back of jeep JKs, Isuzus and Nissan pickups.  This ring and pinion does share some components and can be adapted into an earlier Dana 44 but requires some work, different bearings and spacers.  The benefit is the larger ring gear, better angle cut on the teeth and Dana 60 diameter pinion shaft.

The Dana Spicer Max momentary output torque FT-lbs

* High pinion Dana 44 30 spline...........4170 [ft/lbs]
* Low pinion rear 8.9" Dana 44 32 spline..5340 [ft/lbs]

===Dana 45===
The Dana 45 was introduced during the 1950s as an upgraded Dana 44 with larger 20 spline axle shafts. Since the Dana 45 is no longer being made you can use the Dana 44 gears in the Dana 45 housing if you use model 53 pinion bearings and plenty of shims.

The Dana 44 has seen use in [[Chevrolet Corvette]]s and [[Dodge Viper]]s. This axle is referred to as a Dana 44 ICA or Dana 44 IRS. All 1980–1982 [[Chevrolet Corvette C3]] and manual transmission equipped 1985–1996 [[Chevrolet Corvette C4]] had this axle. A rear [[transaxle]] was used starting with the [[Corvette C5]]. The 2005–06 Pontiac GTO, The Dodge Viper has always used a Dana 44 IRS setup. The majority of Corvette and Viper Dana 44 IRS set ups use a [[limited slip differential]].

Jaguar first used the Dana 44 in an IRS in 1961 for the Jaguar E-type as well as other models. It was used through 1996 [[Jaguar independent rear suspension|(Jaguar IRS Article)]]. There are some differences in the Jaguar Dana 44, however. The differential (possibly the entire axle assembly) was made by Salisbury, a U.K. division of Dana Corporation. The ring gear in the Salisbury version uses slightly smaller mounting bolts and the pinion shaft is a different diameter than the common version. Naturally the cast housing is also unique to the IRS model. Standard 8.5" Dana 44 ring and pinion gear can be used in the IRS model through the use of a special installation kit which includes special shouldered bolts to mount the standard ring gear to the IRS carrier and a special pinion bearing set to fit the standard pinion shaft to the IRS housing. Gear distributors with knowledge of the Jaguar IRS should be able to get the installation kit. US Dana 44 gears are slightly stronger than Jaguar gears, and Jaguar gears are higher priced, but once the installation kit price is added to the lower US gear, prices cost is about the same. If Jaguar makes the needed gear ratio, there isn't much difference in strength. The consensus in the hot rodding community is that the Jaguar IRS is good for up to 500&amp;nbsp;hp from the factory. Most V-12 Jaguar and E-type six-cylinder models used limited slip versions, other models (mainly the XJS) used a standard differential stock with limited slip as an option.

There was a change in design of the Jaguar IRS after 1985. The 61–84 unit is in a stamped steel "cage" that is self-contained and easily removed as a single unit (see photo in this article). This makes it relatively easy to adapt to other vehicles. The 1986 and later unit uses a subframe/lower wishbone design that is not easily adaptable to other vehicles.

'''Dog poop girl''' refers to a [[2005 in South Korea|2005]] incident in [[South Korea]] which was one of the [[history of the internet|first]] internationally reported occurrences of [[doxing]]. In a [[Seoul]] [[Seoul_Subway_Line_2|subway car]],  a young woman's lap dog defecated inside the train,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archives.cjr.org/behind_the_news/the_tale_of_dog_poop_girl_is_n.php The Tale of Dog Poop Girl Is Not So Funny After All] Samantha Henig, ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'' JULY 7, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  and the woman was photographed on another passenger's mobile  phone camera after  she did not  clean up the mess despite numerous requests.&lt;ref name="Subway Fracas"&gt;{{cite news

==Incident==

In early June 2005, the woman, who appears to be in her 20s, took her [[lap dog]] on [[Seoul Subway Line 2]]. Her dog [[defecation|defecated]] on the floor of the subway car and, when other riders requested that she clean up after it, she declined to do so. Another subway rider offered the woman a tissue, which she used to clean the dog but not its waste. Other passengers suggested she clean up the mess, she ignored the second group of requests and departed the subway at the next stop. Another female commuter, using a [[camera phone]], took several photographs of the woman and dog, and posted them on a popular Korean website.&lt;ref name="Netizens Need"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Puppy poo girl"/&gt;

== Reaction  ==
Soon after the unaltered photos were published, Internet vigilante groups closely examined the picture and within days she had been identified and her [[personally identifiable information|personal information]] released on the Internet. The photo quickly became one of the most popular image searches on popular Korean [[web portal]]s and a source of [[parody]] and derisive [[satire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The woman quit her university in [[shame]] and published a photo of her dog with a [[public apology]].&lt;ref name="Internet's Best Friend"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://boom.naver.com/1/20050619170920827 The woman's apology], in Korean, with a picture of the dog&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dkbnews.com/bbs/zboard.php?id=pogpungnews&amp;no=418 Article about 'The woman's apology'], in Korean&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
The reaction by Korean Internet users to the incident prompted several Korean newspapers to run editorials voicing concern over [[Internet vigilantism]], suggesting that the effect of world-wide crowds do not result in wise, uniform judgments and appropriate punishments via [[social stigma]]. The implications for personal [[privacy]] were raised.  Some said that posting the woman's picture was acceptable, but that posting her personal information was inappropriate.  Others said that her face should have been obscured in the widely circulated picture, in order to protect her identity.&lt;ref name="trial by internet"/&gt;

According to [[Daniel J. Solove]], a professor who specializes in privacy issues at [[George Washington University Law School]], the case:

{{cquote|...involves a [[social norm|norm]] that most people would seemingly agree to -- clean up after your dog...But having a permanent record of one's norm violations is upping the sanction to a whole new level . . . allowing bloggers to act as a cyber-[[wikt:posse#Noun|posse]], tracking down norm violators and branding them with digital [[scarlet letter]]s.&lt;ref name="krim"/&gt;}}

In the [[biology|biological]] context of [[organism]]s' [[regulation of gene expression|production]] of [[gene products]], '''downregulation''' is the process by which a [[cell (biology)|cell]] decreases the quantity of a cellular component, such as [[RNA]] or [[protein]], in response to an external stimulus. The complementary process that involves increases of such components is called '''upregulation.'''

An example of downregulation is the cellular decrease in the number of [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] to a molecule, such as a [[hormone]] or [[neurotransmitter]], which reduces the cell's sensitivity to the molecule. This is an example of a locally acting ([[negative feedback]]) mechanism.

An example of upregulation is the response of [[liver]] cells exposed to such [[xenobiotic]] molecules as [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxin]]. In this situation, the cells increase their production of [[cytochrome P450|cytochrome P450 enzymes]], which in turn increases their degradation of these molecules.

Downregulation or upregulation of an RNA or protein may also arise by an [[epigenetics|epigenetic]] alteration.  An epigenetic alteration can be permanent or semi-permanent in a [[somatic cell]] lineage. Such an epigenetic alteration can cause expression of the RNA or protein to no longer respond to an external stimulus.  This occurs, for instance, during [[Behavioral epigenetics#Drug addiction|drug addiction]] or [[Cancer epigenetics|progression to cancer]].

== Downregulation and upregulation of receptors==
All living cells have the ability to receive and process signals that originate outside of their membranes, which they do by means of proteins called [[receptor (biology)|receptors]], usually found on a cell's surface imbedded in the plasma membrane. When such signals bind to a receptor, they effectively direct the cell to do something, such as dividing, dying, or allowing substances to be created, or to enter or exit the cell. A cell's ability to respond to a chemical message depends on the presence of receptors tuned to that message. The more receptors a cell has that are tuned to the message, the more the cell will respond to it.

Receptors are created, or expressed, by the DNA of the cell, and they can be increased, or upregulated, when the signal is weak, or decreased, or downregulated, when it is strong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Explain To Me: Receptor Upregulation/Downregulation|url=http://meandmymastcells.com/explain-to-me-receptor-upregulationdownregulation/|accessdate=7 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Downregulation of receptors happens when receptors have been chronically exposed to an excessive amount of a ligand, either from [[Endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] mediators or from [[exogeny|exogenous]] drugs. This results in [[ligand]]-induced desensitization or internalization of that receptor. It is usually exhibited by various hormone receptors. Upregulation of receptors, on the other hand, results in super-sensitized cells especially after repeated exposure to an antagonistic drug or prolonged absence of the ligand.

Some [[receptor agonist]]s may cause downregulation of their respective receptors, while most [[receptor antagonist]]s temporarily upregulate their respective receptors. The disequilibrium caused by these changes often causes [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] when the long-term use of a [[drug]] is discontinued. However, the use of certain receptor antagonists may also damage receptors faster than they upregulate (internalization of receptors due to antagonism).

Upregulation and downregulation can also happen as a response to [[toxin]]s or [[hormone]]s. An example of upregulation in [[pregnancy]] is hormones that cause cells in the [[uterus]] to become more sensitive to [[oxytocin]].

== Example: Insulin receptor downregulation ==
Elevated levels of the hormone [[insulin]] in the blood trigger downregulation of the associated receptors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=On the Mechanism of Ligand-induced Down-Regulation of Insulin Receptor Level in the Liver Cel|journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry|volume=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; When insulin binds to its receptors on the surface of a cell, the hormone receptor complex undergoes [[endocytosis]] and is subsequently attacked by intracellular [[lysosomal]] [[enzymes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Zaliauskiene |first=Lolita |last2=Kang |first2=Sunghyun |last3=Brouillette |first3=Christie G.|last4=Lebowitz|first4=Jacob |last5=Arani|first5=Ramin B.|last6=Collawn |first6=James F. |date=2016 |title=Down-Regulation of Cell Surface Receptors Is Modulated by Polar Residues within the Transmembrane Domain|journal=Molecular Biology of the Cell |volume=11 |issue=8 |pages=2643–2655 |issn=1059-1524 |pmc=14946 |pmid=10930460|doi=10.1091/mbc.11.8.2643}}&lt;/ref&gt; The internalization of the insulin molecules provides a pathway for degradation of the hormone as well as for regulation of the number of sites that are available for binding on the cell surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carpentier|first=J.-L.|title=Insulin receptor internalization: molecular mechanisms and physiopathological implications|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00400835|journal=Diabetologia|language=en|volume=37|issue=2|pages=S117–S124|doi=10.1007/BF00400835|issn=0012-186X}}&lt;/ref&gt; At high plasma concentrations, the number of surface receptors for insulin is gradually reduced by the accelerated rate of receptor internalization and degradation brought about by increased hormonal binding.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BR8KAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA278&amp;lpg=PA278&amp;dq=At+high+plasma+concentrations,+the+number+of+surface+receptors+for+insulin+is+gradually+reduced+by+the+accelerated+rate+of+receptor+internalization+and+degradation+brought+about+by+increased+hormonal+binding&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VnogHI3SFq&amp;sig=xoQF0g-csu_89HbFEpQd3PFDQb8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjdm4Lu_ajQAhXH1IMKHSSTCXMQ6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=At%20high%20plasma%20concentrations,%20the%20number%20of%20surface%20receptors%20for%20insulin%20is%20gradually%20reduced%20by%20the%20accelerated%20rate%20of%20receptor%20internalization%20and%20degradation%20brought%20about%20by%20increased%20hormonal%20binding&amp;f=false|title=Animal Physiology: From Genes to Organisms|last=Sherwood|first=Lauralee|last2=Klandorf|first2=Hillar|last3=Yancey|first3=Paul|date=2012-01-01|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=1133709516|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of [[Biosynthesis|synthesis]] of new receptors within the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] and their insertion in the plasma membrane do not keep pace with their rate of destruction. Over time, this self-induced loss of target cell receptors for insulin reduces the target cell's sensitivity to the elevated hormone concentration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

This process is illustrated by the [[insulin]] receptor sites on [[target cell]]s in a person with type 2 [[diabetes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fröjdö|first=Sara|last2=Vidal|first2=Hubert|last3=Pirola|first3=Luciano|date=2009-02-01|title=Alterations of insulin signaling in type 2 diabetes: A review of the current evidence from humans|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925443908002081|journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Molecular Basis of Disease|volume=1792|issue=2|pages=83–92|doi=10.1016/j.bbadis.2008.10.019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the elevated levels of blood [[glucose]] in an overweight individual, the [[beta cell|&amp;beta;-cells]] ([[islets of Langerhans]]) in the [[pancreas]] must release more insulin than normal to meet the demand and return the blood to [[homeostatic]] levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilcox|first=Gisela|date=2016-11-20|title=Insulin and Insulin Resistance|journal=Clinical Biochemist Reviews|volume=26|issue=2|pages=19–39|issn=0159-8090|pmc=1204764|pmid=16278749}}&lt;/ref&gt; The near-constant increase in blood insulin levels results from an effort to match the increase in blood glucose, which will cause receptor sites on the liver cells to downregulate and decrease the number of receptors for insulin, increasing the subject’s resistance by decreasing sensitivity to this hormone.{{cn|date=December 2016}} There is also a hepatic decrease in sensitivity to [[insulin]]. This can be seen in the continuing [[gluconeogenesis]] in the liver even when blood glucose levels are elevated. This is the more common process of [[insulin resistance]], which leads to adult-onset diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://journal.diabetes.org/diabetesspectrum/00v13n3/pg132.htm|title=Protein Controversies in Diabetes|website=journal.diabetes.org|access-date=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example can be seen in [[diabetes insipidus]], in which the kidneys become insensitive to [[arginine vasopressin]].

==Downregulation and upregulation in drug addiction==

Family-based, adoption, and twin studies have indicated that there is a strong ( 50%) heritable component to vulnerability to substance abuse addiction.&lt;ref name="pmid29478612"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Walker DM, Nestler EJ |title=Neuroepigenetics and addiction |journal=Handb Clin Neurol |volume=148 |issue= |pages=747–765 |date=2018 |pmid=29478612 |doi=10.1016/B978-0-444-64076-5.00048-X |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Especially among genetically vulnerable individuals, repeated exposure to a drug of abuse in adolescence or adulthood causes addiction by inducing stable downregulation or upregulation in expression of specific genes and [[microRNA]]s through [[epigenetics|epigenetic alterations]].&lt;ref name=Nestler2014&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nestler EJ |title=Epigenetic mechanisms of drug addiction |journal=Neuropharmacology |volume=76 Pt B |issue= |pages=259–68 |date=January 2014 |pmid=23643695 |pmc=3766384 |doi=10.1016/j.neuropharm.2013.04.004 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such downregulation or upregulation has been shown to occur in the brain’s reward regions, such as the [[nucleus accumbens]].&lt;ref name=Nestler2014 /&gt;  (See, for example, [[Epigenetics of cocaine addiction]].)

==Downregulation and upregulation in cancer==

DNA damage appears to be the primary underlying cause of cancer.&lt;ref name="pmid18403632"&gt;{{vcite2 journal |vauthors=Kastan MB |title=DNA damage responses: mechanisms and roles in human disease: 2007 G.H.A.

As described in [[Regulation of transcription in cancer]], epigenetic downregulation of the DNA repair gene ''[[O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase|MGMT]]'' occurs in 93% of bladder cancers, 88% of stomach cancers, 74% of thyroid cancers, 40%-90% of colorectal cancers and 50% of brain cancers.&lt;ref name=Bernstein2015&gt;Carol Bernstein and Harris Bernstein (2015).

Epigenetic upregulation of the DNA repair genes ''[[PARP1]]'' and ''[[FEN1]]'' occurs in numerous cancers (see [[Regulation of transcription in cancer]]).  ''PARP1'' and ''FEN1'' are essential genes in the error-prone and mutagenic DNA repair pathway [[microhomology-mediated end joining]].  If this pathway is upregulated, the excess mutations it causes can lead to cancer.  [[PARP1]] is over-expressed in tyrosine kinase-activated leukemias, in neuroblastoma, in testicular and other germ cell tumors, and in Ewing's sarcoma.&lt;ref name=Bernstein2015 /&gt;  [[FEN1]] is upregulated in the majority of cancers of the breast, prostate, stomach, neuroblastomas, pancreas, and lung.&lt;ref name=Bernstein2015 /&gt;

{{Accounting}}
'''Forensic accounting''', '''forensic accountancy''' or '''financial forensics''' is the specialty practice area of [[accounting]] that describes engagements that result from actual or anticipated disputes or [[litigation]]. "[[Forensic science|Forensic]]" means "suitable for use in a court of law", and it is to that standard and potential outcome that forensic accountants generally have to work. Forensic accountants, also referred to as forensic auditors or investigative auditors, often have to give expert evidence at the eventual trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Forensic accounting is defined as "the application of investigative and analytical skills for the purpose of resolving financial issues in a manner that meets standards required by courts of law. Forensic accountants apply special skills in accounting, auditing, finance, quantitative methods, certain areas of the law, research and investigative skills to collect, analyze and evaluate evidential matter and to interpret and communicate findings."&lt;ref&gt;W.S. Hopwood, J.J. Leiner &amp; G.R. Young, ''Forensic Accounting'', McGraw-Hill Irwin (2008), as quoted by Stephen Pedneault, Frank Rudewicz, Michael Sheetz &amp; Howard Silverstone, ''Forensic Accounting and Fraud Investigation'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. (4th ed. 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

Financial forensic engagements may fall into several categories.  For example:
* [[Damages|Economic damages]] calculations, whether suffered through [[tort]] or [[breach of contract]];
* Post-acquisition disputes such as [[earnout]]s or breaches of [[warranty|warranties]];
* [[Bankruptcy]], [[insolvency]], and [[Corporate action|reorganization]];
* [[Securities fraud]];
* [[Tax fraud]];
* [[Money laundering]];
* [[Business valuation]]; and
* [[Computer forensics]]/[[Electronic discovery|e-discovery]].
Forensic accountants often assist in professional [[negligence]] claims where they are assessing and commenting on the work of other professionals.  Forensic accountants are also engaged in [[marital and family law]] of analyzing lifestyle for spousal support purposes, determining income available for child support and equitable distribution.

Engagements relating to criminal matters typically arise in the aftermath of fraud. They frequently involve the assessment of accounting systems and accounts presentation—in essence assessing if the numbers reflect reality.

Some forensic accountants specialize in forensic analytics which is the procurement and analysis of electronic data to reconstruct, detect, or otherwise support a claim of financial fraud.  The main steps in forensic analytics are (a) data collection, (b) data preparation, (c) data analysis, and (d) reporting.  For example, forensic analytics may be used to review an employee's purchasing card activity to assess whether any of the purchases were diverted or divertible for personal use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Forensic accountants, investigative accountants or expert accountants may be involved in recovering proceeds of serious crime and in relation to confiscation proceedings concerning actual or assumed proceeds of crime or [[money laundering]]. In the [[United Kingdom]], relevant legislation is contained in the [[Proceeds of Crime Act 2002]]. Forensic accountants typically hold the following qualifications; [[Certified Forensic Accounting Professional]] [Certified Forensic Auditors] (CFA - England &amp; Wales) granted by the [[Forensic Auditors Certification Board of England and Wales]] (FACB), [[Certified Fraud Examiner]]s (CFE - US / International), [[Certificate Course on Forensic Accounting and Fraud Detection (FAFD)]] by [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI)]], [[Certified Public Accountant]]s (CPA - US) with [[AICPA]]'s [Certified in Financial Forensics est. 2008] (CFF) Credentials, [[Chartered Accountant]]s (CA - Canada), [[Certified Management Accountant]]s (CMA - Canada), [[Chartered Professional Accountant]]s (CPA - Canada)), [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants|Chartered Certified Accountant]]s (CCA - UK), or [[Certified Forensic Investigation Professionals]] (CFIP). In India there is a separate breed of forensic accountants called Certified Forensic Accounting Professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/management/forensic-auditor-courses-catching-up-in-india-114042301428_1.html|title=Forensic Auditor Courses catching up in India |publisher=business-standard.com |accessdate=2014-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Certified Forensic Accountant (CRFAC)''' program from the '''American Board of Forensic Accounting''' assesses Certified Public Accountants (CPAs) knowledge and competence in professional forensic accounting services in a multitude of areas. Forensic accountants may be involved in both litigation support (providing assistance on a given case, primarily related to the calculation or estimation of economic damages and related issues) and investigative accounting (looking into illegal activities). The American Board of Forensic Accounting was established in 1993. 

In 2016, the Forensic Auditors Certification Board (FACB) of England and Wales was established by the major forensic auditing and accounting bodies from across the world with its registered address in London. FACB is a professional bodies membership body comprising the International Institute of Certified Forensic Accountants (IICFA) of USA, Institute of Forensic Auditors of Zimbabwe (IFA), Institute of Forensic Accountants of Pakistan (IFAP), Institute of Certified Forensic Accountants (ICFA) of USA and Canada and the Institute of Forensic Accountants of Nigeria (IFA). FACB plays several roles and one the roles is standardization of the examination and certification of forensic auditors globally. Forensic auditors and accountants sit for one examination that is set by FACB and upon passing and meeting all the professional requirements, are awarded the credential, Certified Forensic Auditor (CFA) or the Registered Forensic Auditor (RFA) for practitioners who intend to go into public practice. All certification is renewed on an annual basis. Apart from practitioners certification, FACB is an oversight body which accredits prospective member organization before admission as part of quality checks. Persons with the FACB credential can practice as forensic auditors on a global scale.

Large accounting firms often have a forensic accounting department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.big4accountingfirms.org/forensic-accounting-firms/|title=Service of Forensic Accountants |publisher=big4accountingfirms.org |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forensic accounting and fraud investigation methodologies are different than internal auditing. Thus forensic accounting services and practice should be handled by forensic accounting experts, not by internal auditing experts. Forensic accountants may appear on the crime scene a little later than fraud auditors, but their major contribution is in translating complex financial transactions and numerical data into terms that ordinary laypersons can understand. That is necessary because if the fraud comes to trial, the jury will be made up of ordinary laypersons. On the other hand, internal auditors move on checklists that may not surface the evidence that the jury or regulatory bodies look for. The fieldwork may carry out legal risks if internal auditing checklists are employed instead asking to a forensic accountant and may result serious consultant malpractice risks.

Forensic accountants utilize an understanding of [[Economics|economic theories]], [[business information]], [[Financial statements|financial reporting]] systems, accounting and auditing standards and procedures, [[data management]] &amp; [[electronic discovery]], [[data analysis techniques for fraud detection]], [[evidence]] gathering and investigative techniques, and litigation processes and procedures to perform their work. Forensic accountants are also increasingly playing more proactive risk reduction roles by designing and performing extended procedures as part of the statutory audit, acting as advisers to audit committees, [[fraud deterrence]] engagements, and assisting in investment analyst research.

A December 10,2014 Business Insider article explains Benford's Law as follows: in most naturally occurring datasets, the first digit of a number is 1, about 30% of the time, 2 about 18% of the time and 9 only about 5% of the time. So, one can identify the probable area of fraud by looking at the occurrences of the first digit in a given dataset.

[[File:Syntax tree.svg|thumb|Structure of a syntactically well-formed, although nonsensical, English sentence ([[Colorless green ideas sleep furiously|historical example]] from Chomsky 1957).]]
In [[mathematics]], [[computer science]], and [[linguistics]], a '''formal language''' consists of [[string (computer science)|words]] whose [[symbol (formal)|letters]] are taken from an [[alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]] and are [[well-formed formula|well-formed]] according to a specific set of rules.

The [[Alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]] of a formal language consist of symbols, letters, or tokens that concatenate into strings of the language.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. {{citation|title=Formal Languages and Compilation|series=Texts in Computer Science|first=Stefano Crespi|last=Reghizzi|publisher=Springer|year=2009|isbn=9781848820500|page=8|quote=An alphabet is a finite set}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Each string concatenated from symbols of this alphabet is called a word, and the words that belong to a particular formal language are sometimes called ''well-formed words'' or ''[[well-formed formula]]s''. A formal language is often defined by means of a [[formal grammar]] such as a [[regular grammar]] or [[context-free grammar]], which consists of its [[formation rule]]s.

The field of '''formal language theory''' studies primarily the purely [[syntax|syntactical]] aspects of such languages—that is, their internal structural patterns. Formal language theory sprang out of linguistics, as a way of understanding the syntactic regularities of [[natural language]]s.
In computer science, formal languages are used among others as the basis for defining the grammar of [[programming language]]s and formalized versions of subsets of natural languages in which the words of the language represent concepts that are associated with particular meanings or [[semantics]]. In [[computational complexity theory]], [[decision problem]]s are typically defined as formal languages, and [[complexity class]]es are defined as the sets of the formal languages that can be [[parser|parsed by machines]] with limited computational power. In [[logic]] and the [[foundations of mathematics]], formal languages are used to represent the syntax of [[axiomatic system]]s, and [[Formalism (mathematics)|mathematical formalism]] is the philosophy that all of mathematics can be reduced to the syntactic manipulation of formal languages in this way.

== History ==
{{Expand section|date=April 2011}}
The first formal language is thought to be the one used by [[Gottlob Frege]] in his ''[[Begriffsschrift]]'' (1879), literally meaning "concept writing", and which Frege described as a "formal language of pure thought."&lt;ref name="Herken1995"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Rolf Herken|title=The universal Turing machine: a half-century survey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YafIDVd1Z68C&amp;pg=PA290|year=1995|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-211-82637-9|page=290|chapter=Influences of Mathematical Logic on Computer Science|author=Martin Davis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Axel Thue]]'s early [[semi-Thue system]], which can be used for rewriting strings, was influential on [[formal grammar]]s.

==Words over an alphabet==

An '''alphabet''', in the context of formal languages, can be any [[set (mathematics)|set]], although it often makes sense to use an [[alphabet]] in the usual sense of the word, or more generally a [[character set]] such as [[ASCII]] or [[Unicode]].  The elements of an alphabet are called its '''letters'''.  An alphabet may contain an [[countable set|infinite]] number of elements;&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[first-order logic]] is often expressed using an alphabet that, besides symbols such as ∧, ¬, ∀ and parentheses, contains infinitely many elements ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;… that play the role of variables.&lt;/ref&gt; however, most definitions in formal language theory specify alphabets with a finite number of elements, and most results apply only to them.

A '''word''' over an alphabet can be any finite sequence (i.e., [[string (computer science)|string]]) of letters. The set of all words over an alphabet Σ is usually denoted by Σ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; (using the [[Kleene star]]). The length of a word is the number of letters it is composed of. For any alphabet, there is only one word of length 0, the ''empty word'', which is often denoted by e, ε, λ or even Λ. By [[concatenation]] one can combine two words to form a new word, whose length is the sum of the lengths of the original words. The result of concatenating a word with the empty word is the original word.

In some applications, especially in [[logic]], the alphabet is also known as the ''vocabulary'' and words are known as ''formulas'' or ''sentences''; this breaks the letter/word metaphor and replaces it by a word/sentence metaphor.

==Definition==
A '''formal language''' ''L'' over an alphabet Σ is a [[subset]] of Σ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, that is, a set of [[#Words over an alphabet|words]] over that alphabet. Sometimes the sets of words are grouped into expressions, whereas rules and constraints may be formulated for the creation of 'well-formed expressions'.

In computer science and mathematics, which do not usually deal with [[natural language]]s, the adjective "formal" is often omitted as redundant.

While formal language theory usually concerns itself with formal languages that are described by some syntactical rules, the actual definition of the concept "formal language" is only as above: a (possibly infinite) set of finite-length strings composed from a given alphabet, no more and no less.  In practice, there are many languages that can be described by rules, such as [[regular language]]s or [[context-free language]]s.  The notion of a [[formal grammar]] may be closer to the intuitive concept of a "language," one described by syntactic rules. By an abuse of the definition, a particular formal language is often thought of as being equipped with a formal grammar that describes it.

==Examples==

The following rules describe a formal language&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|L}} over the alphabet Σ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, +, = }:
* Every nonempty string that does not contain "+" or "=" and does not start with "0" is in&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|L}}.
* The string "0" is in&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|L}}.
* A string containing "=" is in&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|L}} if and only if there is exactly one "=", and it separates two valid strings of&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|L}}.
* A string containing "+" but not "=" is in&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|L}} if and only if every "+" in the string separates two valid strings of&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|L}}.
* No string is in&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|L}} other than those implied by the previous rules.
Under these rules, the string "23+4=555" is in&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|L}}, but the string "=234=+" is not. This formal language expresses [[natural number]]s, well-formed additions, and well-formed addition equalities, but it expresses only what they look like (their [[syntax]]), not what they mean ([[semantics]]). For instance, nowhere in these rules is there any indication that "0" means the number zero,   "+" means addition, "23+4=555" is false, etc.

=== Constructions ===&lt;!-- [[empty language]] redirects here --&gt;
For finite languages, one can explicitly enumerate all well-formed words. For example, we can describe a language&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|L}} as just {{mvar|L}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{"a", "b", "ab", "cba"}. The [[degeneracy (mathematics)|degenerate]] case of this construction is the '''empty language''', which contains no words at all (&lt;span class="nounderlines"&gt;{{mvar|L}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;[[∅]]&lt;/span&gt;).

However, even over a finite (non-empty) alphabet such as Σ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{a,&amp;nbsp;b} there are an infinite number of finite-length words that can potentially be expressed: "a", "abb", "ababba", "aaababbbbaab",&amp;nbsp;…. Therefore, formal languages are typically infinite, and describing an infinite formal language is not as simple as writing ''L''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{"a", "b", "ab", "cba"}. Here are some examples of formal languages:
* {{mvar|L}} = Σ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, the set of ''all'' words over Σ;
* {{mvar|L}} = {"a"}&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; = {"a"&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}, where ''n'' ranges over the natural numbers and "a"&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;!-- I know it is ugly, but it is consistent with the notation in other examples. Should we use through the article, say, angle brackets ‹a›? --&gt; means "a" repeated ''n'' times (this is the set of words consisting only of the symbol "a");
* the set of syntactically correct programs in a given programming language (the syntax of which is usually defined by a [[context-free grammar]]);
* the set of inputs upon which a certain [[Turing machine]] halts; or
* the set of maximal strings of [[alphanumeric]] [[ASCII]] characters on this line, i.e.,&lt;br&gt; the set {"the", "set", "of", "maximal", "strings", "alphanumeric", "ASCII", "characters", "on", "this", "line", "i", "e"}.

== Language-specification formalisms ==

Formal languages are used as tools in multiple disciplines. However, formal language theory rarely concerns itself with particular languages (except as examples), but is mainly concerned with the study of various types of formalisms to describe languages. For instance, a language can be given as
* those strings generated by some [[formal grammar]];
* those strings described or matched by a particular [[regular expression]];
* those strings accepted by some [[Automata theory|automaton]], such as a [[Turing machine]] or [[Finite state machine|finite state automaton]];
* those strings for which some [[decision problem|decision procedure]] (an [[algorithm]] that asks a sequence of related YES/NO questions) produces the answer YES.

Typical questions asked about such formalisms include:

* What is their expressive power? (Can formalism ''X'' describe every language that formalism ''Y'' can describe? Can it describe other languages?)
* What is their recognizability? (How difficult is it to decide whether a given word belongs to a language described by formalism ''X''?)
* What is their comparability? (How difficult is it to decide whether two languages, one described in formalism ''X'' and one in formalism ''Y'', or in ''X'' again, are actually the same language?).

Surprisingly often, the answer to these decision problems is "it cannot be done at all", or "it is extremely expensive" (with a characterization of how expensive). Therefore, formal language theory is a major application area of [[Computability theory (computer science)|computability theory]] and [[computational complexity theory|complexity theory]]. Formal languages may be classified in the [[Chomsky hierarchy]] based on the expressive power of their generative grammar as well as the complexity of their recognizing [[automata theory|automaton]]. [[Context-free grammar]]s and [[regular grammar]]s provide a good compromise between expressivity and ease of [[parsing]], and are widely used in practical applications.

== Operations on languages ==

Certain operations on languages are common. This includes the standard set operations, such as union, intersection, and complement. Another class of operation is the element-wise application of string operations.

Examples: suppose ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are languages over some common alphabet.
* The ''[[concatenation]]'' ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; consists of all strings of the form ''vw'' where ''v'' is a string from ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''w'' is a string from ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
* The ''intersection'' ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∩&amp;nbsp;''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; consists of all strings that are contained in both languages
* The ''complement'' ¬''L'' of a language with respect to a given alphabet consists of all strings over the alphabet that are not in the language.
* The [[Kleene star]]: the language consisting of all words that are concatenations of 0 or more words in the original language;
* ''Reversal'':
** Let ''e'' be the empty word, then ''e&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''e'', and
** for each non-empty word ''w''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;…''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' over some alphabet, let ''w&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;…''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'',
** then for a formal language ''L'', ''L&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{''w&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;''w'' ∈ ''L''}.
* [[String homomorphism]]

Such [[string operations]] are used to investigate [[Closure (mathematics)|closure properties]] of classes of languages. A class of languages is closed under a particular operation when the operation, applied to languages in the class, always produces a language in the same class again. For instance, the [[context-free language]]s are known to be closed under union, concatenation, and intersection with [[regular language]]s, but not closed under intersection or complement. The theory of [[cone (formal languages)|trios]] and [[abstract family of languages|abstract families of languages]] studies the most common closure properties of language families in their own right.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979}}, Chapter 11: Closure properties of families of languages.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

=== Programming languages ===
{{Main|Syntax (programming languages)|Compiler compiler}}

A compiler usually has two distinct components. A [[lexical analyzer]], generated by a tool like [[lex programming tool|&lt;code&gt;lex&lt;/code&gt;]], identifies the tokens of the programming language grammar, e.g. [[identifier]]s or [[Keyword (computer programming)|keywords]], which are themselves expressed in a simpler formal language, usually by means of [[regular expressions]]. At the most basic conceptual level, a [[parser]], usually generated by a [[parser generator]] like &lt;code&gt;[[yacc]]&lt;/code&gt;, attempts to decide if the source program is valid, that is if it belongs to the programming language for which the compiler was built.

Of course, compilers do more than just parse the source code – they usually translate it into some executable format. Because of this, a parser usually outputs more than a yes/no answer, typically an [[abstract syntax tree]]. This is used by subsequent stages of the compiler to eventually generate an [[executable]] containing [[machine code]] that runs directly on the hardware, or some [[intermediate code]] that requires a [[virtual machine]] to execute.

=== Formal theories, systems and proofs ===
[[File:Formal languages.svg|thumb|300px|right|This diagram shows the [[Syntax (logic)|syntactic]] divisions within a [[formal system]]. [[string (computer science)|Strings of symbols]] may be broadly divided into nonsense and [[well-formed formula]]s.  The set of well-formed formulas is divided into [[theorem]]s and non-theorems.]]

{{Main|Theory (mathematical logic)|Formal system}}

In [[mathematical logic]], a ''formal theory'' is a set of [[sentence (mathematical logic)|sentences]] expressed in a formal language.

A ''formal system'' (also called a ''logical calculus'', or a ''logical system'') consists of a formal language together with a [[deductive apparatus]] (also called a ''deductive system''). The deductive apparatus may consist of a set of [[transformation rule]]s, which may be interpreted as valid rules of inference, or a set of [[axiom]]s, or have both. A formal system is used to [[Proof theory|derive]] one expression from one or more other expressions. Although a formal language can be identified with its formulas, a formal system cannot be likewise identified by its theorems. Two formal systems &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{FS}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{FS'}&lt;/math&gt; may have all the same theorems and yet differ in some significant proof-theoretic way (a formula A may be a syntactic consequence of a formula B in one but not another for instance).

A ''formal proof'' or ''derivation'' is a finite sequence of well-formed formulas (which may be interpreted as sentences, or [[proposition]]s) each of which is an axiom or follows from the preceding formulas in the sequence by a [[rule of inference]]. The last sentence in the sequence is a theorem of a formal system. Formal proofs are useful because their theorems can be interpreted as true propositions.

====Interpretations and models====
{{main|Formal semantics (logic)||Interpretation (logic)|Model theory}}

Formal languages are entirely syntactic in nature but may be given [[semantics]] that give meaning to the elements of the language. For instance, in mathematical [[logic]], the set of possible formulas of a particular logic is a formal language, and an [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] assigns a meaning to each of the formulas—usually, a [[truth value]].

The study of interpretations of formal languages is called [[Formal semantics (logic)|formal semantics]].  In mathematical logic, this is often done in terms of [[model theory]].  In model theory, the terms that occur in a formula are interpreted as objects within [[Structure (mathematical logic)|mathematical structures]], and fixed compositional interpretation rules determine how the truth value of the formula can be derived from the interpretation of its terms; a ''model'' for a formula is an interpretation of terms such that the formula becomes true.

'''''Handbook of Middle American Indians''''' ('''HMAI''') is a sixteen-volume compendium on [[Mesoamerica]] , from the [[pre-Columbian|prehispanic]] to the late twentieth century. Volumes on particular topics were published from the 1960s and 1970s under the general editorship of [[Robert Wauchope (archaeologist)|Robert Wauchope]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Wauchope, general editor. ‘’Handbook of Middle American Indians’’, 16 volumes.  Austin: University of Texas Press&lt;/ref&gt; Separate volumes with particular volume editors  deal with  a number of general topics, including archeology, cultural anthropology, physical anthropology, linguistics, with the last four substantive volumes treating various topics in Mesoamerican ethnohistory, under the editorship of [[Howard F. Cline]]. Select volumes have become available in e-book format.

A retrospective review of the HMAI by two anthropologists discusses its history and evaluates it.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce Marcus and Ronald Spores, "The Handbook of Middle American Indians: A Retrospective Look." American Anthropologist, New Series, Vol. 80, No. 1 (Mar., 1978), pp. 85-100, Published by: Wiley on behalf of the American Anthropological Association, Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/673513 accessed 24 May 2018&lt;/ref&gt; One review calls it a fundamental work.&lt;ref&gt;Berthe, J.-P. “Un Ouvrage Fondamental: Le ‘Handbook of Middle American Indians.’” ''Annales. Histoire, Sciences Sociales'', vol. 21, no. 1, 1966, pp. 229–230. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/27576567 accessed 24 May 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another reviewer says "since the first volume of the HMAI appeared in 1964 is far and away the most comprehensive and erudite coverage of native cultures of any region in the Americas."&lt;ref&gt;Colston, Stephen A. “The Americas.” ''The Americas'', vol. 33, no. 4, 1977, pp. 679–680. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/980885. accessed 24 May 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; A review in the journal ''Science'' says that "There can be little doubt that, like the ''Handbook of South American Indians'', this monumental synthesis will provide a sound basis for new generalizations and will stimulate additional research to fill the gaps in knowledge and understanding that will become apparent.&lt;ref&gt;Richard B. Woodbury. “Handbook of Middle American Indians.” ''Science'', vol. 148, no. 3671, 1965, pp. 798–800. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/1716362. accessed 24 May 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1981, six volumes in the '''''Supplement to the Handbook of Middle American Indians''''' were published under the general editorship of [[Victoria Bricker]].&lt;ref&gt;Victoria Bricker, ‘’Supplement to the Handbook of Middle American Indians’’. 6 vols.

Volumes 6 &amp; 7 were reviewed when the appeared. One reviewer highlights several articles, including those by Eric R. Wolf, Angel Palerm, and Willilam Sanders, but he goes on to say "These volumes are ... more valuable for reference than for reading. Sections dealing with distribution, history, and bibliography are very useful, but sections dealing with social structure or the character of the peoples generally fail to provide integrated analyses indicating the essential features."&lt;ref&gt;Dessaint, A.

'''Sunstroke plants''' or '''heliophytes'''  are adapted to a [[habitat]] with a very intensive [[Solar irradiance|insolation]], because of the construction of its own structure and maintenance ([[metabolism]]). Solar plants, for example, are [[mullein]], [[Calluna|ling]], [[thyme]] and [[Cirsium oleraceum|soft velcro]], [[white clover]], and most [[rose]]s. They are common in open terrain, rocks, [[meadows]], as well as at the mountain [[pasture]]s and [[grassland]]s and other long sunny exposures.&lt;ref name="Sofradzija"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sofradžija A., Šoljan D., Hadžiselimović R. |year= 2004|title= Biologija 1.|publisher= Svjetlost, Sarajevo|isbn=9958-10-686-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Međedović"&gt;{{cite book|author=Međedović S., Maslić E., Hadžiselimović R.|year=2002|title=Biologija 2. |publisher=Svjetlost, Sarajevo|isbn=9958-10-222-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Special features of the plant include coarse tiny [[leaf|leaves]] with hairy and [[wax]]y protection against excessive light radiation and water loss. In structure, the leaves vary in frequent double [[palisade tissue|palisade layers]]. [[Chloroplast]]s have a protective element such as [[carotenoid]] and the [[enzyme]]s, and accumulation of [[reactive oxygen|ROS]] to avoid toxic effects. In addition, there are also [[stoma | stoma tal apparatus]] on the leaves and green [[shoot]]s, in order to allow a better exchange of gases. At same time, this increases possibilities for [[photosynthesis]].&lt;ref name="Walter"&gt;{{cite book|last=Walter S Judd|first=Walter S.|first2=Christopher S. |last2=Campbell |first3=Elizabeth A. |last3=Kellogg |first4=Peter F. |last4=Stevens |first5=Michael J. |last5=Donoghue|title=Plant systematics: a phylogenetic approach.

Unlike the shadow-preferring plants, heliophytes have a high [[light compensation point]], and for this they need a higher illumination intensity for effective adoption of [[carbon dioxide]]. Sunstroke leaves, in this respect, has a very high capacity, to

However, they have a higher [[basal metabolism]] comparing  to the other leaves.

The term '''historical period drama''' (also '''historical drama''', '''period drama''', '''costume drama''', and '''period piece''') refers to a work set in a past time period, usually used in the context of [[film]] and [[television]]. It is an informal crossover term that can apply to several [[genre]]s and is often heard in the context of [[historical fiction]] and [[romance film|romance]]s, [[adventure film]]s, and [[swashbuckler]]s. A period piece may be set in a vague or general era such as the [[Middle Ages]] or a specific period such as the [[Roaring Twenties]]. A religious work can qualify as period drama but not as historical drama.

==Historical accuracy==
Some works attempt to accurately portray historical events or persons, to the degree that the available historical research and the length of the work will allow. These types of works are also known as [[docudrama]], examples being ''[[Cinderella Man]]'', ''[[Schindler's List]]'', and ''[[Lincoln (film)|Lincoln]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZcGNAQAAQBAJ|title=Inspired by True Events: An Illustrated Guide to More Than 500 History-Based Films, 2nd Edition: An Illustrated Guide to More Than 500 History-Based Films|last=Niemi|first=Robert|date=2013-10-17|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781610691987|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other works are fictionalized stories based on actual people or events, such as ''[[Braveheart]]'' and ''[[Les Misérables (2012 film)|Les Misérables]]''.

'''''Law in Modern Society: Toward a Criticism of Social Theory''''' is a 1976 book by philosopher and politician [[Roberto Mangabeira Unger]]. In the book, Unger uses the rise and decline of the [[rule of law]] as a vehicle to explore certain problems in [[social theory]]. According to Unger, problems that were central concerns of classical social theorists like [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[Émile Durkheim|Durkheim]], and [[Max Weber|Weber]]—the problems of explanation, order, and modernity—remain unsolved. Unger contends that the failure of classical social theory to solve these dilemmas can be traced to the way in which it asserted its independence from the ancient political philosophers, namely in its denial of a supra-historical human nature and in its insistence upon the contrast of [[fact-value distinction|fact and value]]. Unger argues that a radical reorientation of social theory is needed to solve the problems it faces. "To carry out its own program," Unger writes, social theory must destroy itself."{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=8}} The rise and decline of the rule of law, and the dilemmas of social theory, converge in the need to be able to compare and criticize different forms of society, in order to be able to more effectively submit the organization of society to the human will.

==Overview==

===Chapter 1: The Predicament of Social Theory===

Unger opens ''Law in Modern Society'' by connecting the study of law to the unsolved problems of social theory. Social theory is the tradition originating in the writings of [[Montesquieu]] and culminating with the work of [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[Émile Durkheim|Durkheim]], and [[Max Weber|Weber]].{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=1-3}} In Unger's view, classic social theory as represented by these thinkers is marked by an insistence on the distinction between fact and value, description and evaluation, and also by a denial of a unitary human nature. Unger contrasts classic social theory with the political philosophy of the ancients, who did not recognize as sharp a distinction between fact and value, and maintained that there is a universal human nature that exists in all times and places.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=3-5}}

The study of law affords a vantage point from which to explore three unsolved problems of social theory, according to Unger. The first, the '''problem of method''', is that the prevailing methodological approaches to social study are inadequate. The rationalist approach (as seen in the works of economists) and the historicist approach (which accepts the function of cause and effect but not logical entailment) both invite deterministic social explanations. Unger contends that we need a third method, one that is generalizing, and yet also open to rich historical particularity while not falling into deterministic explanations.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=8-23}}

The second problem is the '''problem of social order'''. How do we account for the existence of a social order? Classical social theory is represented by a struggle between the doctrines of instrumentalism (or private interest) versus legitimacy (or consensus). The legitimacy approach sees rules as manifestations of the shared values of a group. The instrumentalist approach sees society as made up of many divergent individual wills, and rules serve the instrumental purpose of helping the members of society achieve their privately chosen aims in the long run.  Utilitarianism is an example of an instrumentalist approach. According to Unger, we need to go beyond the partial truths expressed in each doctrine.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=23-37}}

The third unsolved problem of social theory is '''the problem of modernity'''. What marks the experience of modernity? What is its place in world history? What is the relationship between ideology and actuality in modern life? Our social theory must be able to reconcile the subjective experience of society with its objective meaning. As history transpires, new puzzles are added to the experience of studying modernity.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=37-40}} A large part of the problem of modernity is the difficulty of comparing modern forms of social life: modern Western society with its forbears, and different forms of contemporary society (traditional, revolutionary socialist, postliberal) among themselves.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=41-42}}

The program of classic social theory has value, according to Unger—namely in allowing us to study human beings as they are rather than as they ought to be, and in helping us to inquire into how each society shapes conduct and consciousness of its members. These classical social theorists sought to create a body of objective knowledge of society that would not be at the mercy of metaphysical speculation or political controversy, and up to a point, they succeeded.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=266-267}} But Unger concludes that the problems of social theory cannot be resolved unless the truths of classic social theory are reconciled with the insights of older political philosophy.{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=43}} We need a general doctrine of human nature.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=40-43}}

===Chapter 2: Law and the Forms of Society===

In this chapter Unger addresses the varieties of law and explores the conditions under which each of them develops. '''Customary/interactional''' law is neither public nor positive, and consists of implicit standards of conduct, not formulated rules. Under a system of customary and interactional law, customs are characteristically inarticulate.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=49-50}} '''Bureaucratic/regulatory''' law is public and positive, and emerges with the division of state and society.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=50-52}} A '''legal order''' is a legal system that is committed to being general and autonomous, in addition to being public and positive.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=52-54}}

From this discussion, he draws conclusions about the issue of social order as it relates to the development of law. Unger explains how disintegration of community is accompanied by a trend toward increasing specialization in a society's division of labor, a trend that is responsible for the separation of state and society.{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=63}} This process erodes the basis for an inclusive set of shared beliefs.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=61-62}} The legal order emerges with interest group pluralism,{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=66-76}} as well as reliance on higher divine or universal law as standard for justifying and criticizing a state's positive law.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=76-86}}  The rule of law is a response to the decline of order in society.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=127-133}} But when the belief in higher law declines, the legal order is threatened. In contemporary history, the natural rights synthesis that underlies the legal order ideal has been undone, with the result that the coherence of the rule of law ideal is compromised.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=84-86}}

===Chapter 3: Law and Modernity===

In this chapter, Unger traces the rise and decline of the rule of law in society. He begins by setting out a preliminary framework for the comparison of societies, and uses this framework to examine tribal society, liberal society, and aristocratic society. Unger's inquiry into these types of society revolves around three questions: What is the nature of the contrast between insiders and outsiders? How are insiders drawn together in significant groups and what is the quality of their encounters with strangers? And, finally, how individuals conceive of the place of the ideal—do they have a concept of the right or the good that transcends the natural or social world?{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=137-140}}

Unger concludes that tribal society displays the starkest possible contrast between insiders and outsiders; outsiders are not regarded as human beings with whom the insiders share anything significant in common. There is a paucity of significant groups in tribal society. And there is little conception of a good or right that towers over the immanent reality of daily life or the natural world. The important insight, for Unger, is that tribal society is an extremely cohesive social world, where there is deep agreement about fundamental social questions, profound distrust of strangers, and no recognition of overarching ideals against which the quotidian life or nature can be compared.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=140-143}}

At the other extreme, liberal society is one in which the contrast between insiders and outsiders is softened by the fact that each individual belongs to a large number of significant groups. Because members of liberal society become accustomed to other people being both insiders and outsiders in different contexts, the hostility of tribal society for the stranger is replaced, in liberal society, by ideals of impersonal respect and formal equality. People will abide by relatively stable standards of social order because it is to their advantage to do so, not because they observe identical conceptions of the true and the good. In liberal society, a concept of the right and the good transcends the reality of daily life and the natural world.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=143-147}}

Unger views aristocratic society as a synthesis of tribal and liberal societies. Aristocratic society unites universalism and particularism. In aristocratic society, significant social groups are experienced as steps on a hierarchic ladder. Each individual belongs to a specific group, his estate, which confers on him a range of entitlements and obligations and predetermine his outlook on the world. These strata are sharply divided from each other and are decisive in determining the quality of the individual's life. Aristocratic society's view of the relationship between the ideal and the actual occupies an intermediate position between the views of tribal and liberal society. In aristocratic society, there is an intense oscillation between a tendency to sanctify existing social arrangements and the tendency to oppose them to a higher heavenly perfection.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=147-153}}

Having set out a rudimentary grammar for the comparison of societies, Unger traces the emergence and decline of the liberal state and the rule of law{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=134}} (which Unger describes as the soul of liberal society{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=192}}).

Liberal society developed out of aristocratic society, namely the society of estates (Standestaat), which was an intermediary system between feudal society and the modern liberal state.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=155-156}} The law of the Standestaat was a forerunner to the modern legal system, and consisted of an area of royal discretion (matters falling under the prince's prerogative to keep the peace) and a higher law (matters pertaining to the privileges and obligations of estates of the realm).{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=158-160}} The elements that make up a modern legal order—positiveness, publicity, generality and autonomy—were not present,{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=160}} but as the formerly neat line between royal prerogatives and the law of estates faded away, the prince was increasingly held to standards of generality and autonomy, and estate privileges acquired a public and positive character.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=162-163}} The confinement of royal power by the fundamental law of the Standestaat was supported by a belief in a God-given natural order.{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=166}}

The liberal state—with its multiplicity of significant groups, the disappearance of a sharp distinction between insiders and outsiders, and a stark division between the ideal and the actual—faced two questions with increasing urgency: how can there be consensus without widespread agreement about the good,{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=169-170}} and how can we distinguish legitimate from illegitimate uses of power in the face of dissolving hierarchy and moral confusion?{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=172-173}} The rule of law, which attempted to guarantee the impersonality of power, was a way of dealing with these urgent questions.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=176-178}}

The rule of law has two major premises—that the most significant forms of power can be concentrated in government, and that power can be effectively constrained by rules. But Unger contends that these premises are largely fictitious.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=178-179}} They are undermined by the awareness that individuals are most vulnerable to hierarchies of the family, the workplace, and the market that are largely beyond the reach of the legal system, and also that rules can never make power truly impersonal and impartial—administrators and judges will always decide among competing sets of beliefs in rendering a decision.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=179-181}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;Thus, the very assumptions of the rule of law ideal appear to be falsified by the reality of life in liberal society ... The state, a supposedly neutral overseer of social conflict, is forever caught up in the antagonism of private interests and made the tool of one faction or another. Thus, in seeking to discipline and to justify the exercise of power, men are condemned to pursue an objective they are forbidden to reach. And this repeated disappointment accentuates still further the gap between the vision of the ideal and the experience of actuality.{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=181}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The contradictions and paradoxes of liberal society, by undermining the rule of law and the ideals it represents, ultimately give rise to what Unger calls postliberal society. Postliberal society is marked by overt intervention by the government in areas previously regarded as beyond the reach of state action, and a gradual approximation of state and society. The state's pretense of being a neutral guardian of the social order is abandoned.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=192-193}} These trends are reflected in the rise of open-ended clauses in legislation, administration, and adjudication, and a concern with substantive justice over formal justice.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=192-200}} The effacement of the boundary between state and society, called corporatism, leads to the rise of state institutions that rival the state in their power.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=200-203}} Unger argues that these welfare state institutions are an assault on the legal order, while the corporatist tendencies in postliberal society undermine bureaucratic law.{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=200}} The danger of these tendencies, Unger contends, is demonstrated by the Weimar Republic, in which the decline of the rule of law in favor of a welfare corporate state set the stage for terror and inhumanity of Nazi Germany.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=216-220}}

Unger concludes his examination of law and modernity by looking at two varieties of the modern state—the traditionalist state{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=224-231}} and the revolutionary socialist{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=231-234}}—then considering two possibilities for the development of law in the future. Seeing similar tensions within traditionalist and revolutionary socialist societies,{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=234-235}} Unger points out that the liberal state is only a special case of modernity.{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=166}} He concludes that there's no more reason to think that societies will converge toward similarity rather than grow in their differences.{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=237}}

The future of the rule of law, Unger suggests, could take two forms. The first, pessimistic, possibility he imagines is a scenario in which the progression of custom, bureaucracy, and rule of law revolves in a circle, and the postliberal decline of the rule of law would lead to the return of custom as the exclusive instrument of the social order.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=238-239}} There would be a relapse of a tribalism that sanctifies the existing order of the group as an irrevocable decree of nature. The second possibility Unger imagines is an optimistic scenario, which Unger describes as a spiral in which "individual freedom could be rescued from the demise of the rule of law."{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=239}} On this model, society defeats inequality to such an extent that people place greater confidence in collective choices, not suspecting them as a product of the interests of dominant groups.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=239-240}} The increasing equality of society would make possible a greater consensus about the immanent order of society and help refine further the meaning of equality.{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=240}}

===Chapter 4: The Predicament of Social Theory Revisited===

In this final chapter, Unger returns to the questions of the methodology of social theory with which he opened the book.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=243-245}} For each of the unsolved problems of social theory—the problem of method, the problem of social order, and the problem of modernity—Unger concludes that the theoretical problems of social theory require a political solution.

For the problem of method, Unger offers the interpretive method as an alternative to the rationalist and historicist approaches favored by classical social theorists. The interpretive method, which emphasizes the embeddedness of action in belief and the way social phenomena cluster into meaningful totalities, avoids the tendency of rationalist and historicist methods to fall into deterministic accounts of human activity, while also offering the prospect of reconciling the demands of subjectivity and objectivity in social explanation. But the possibility of reconciling subjectivity and objectivity in social theory ultimately is premised on a belief in the unity of the human spirit, and in order to be achieved, we would need a community of experience, understanding and value to come into existence. For this reason, to solve the problem of method completely requires a political solution.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=245-262}}

For the second persistent problem of social theory, the problem of social order, Unger sees the crux of this problem in the divergence between the doctrines of legitimacy/consensus and instrumentalism/private interest. These views offer completely different accounts of the basis for order in society. Unger allows that instrumentalism is more effective in explaining liberal society, while consensus theory comes closer in explaining tribal and hierarchical societies.
Social study of law suggests a response to our puzzlement over the basis of order in society. It puts the controversy between the doctrines of private interest and consensus, and hence between the instrumental and noninstrumental view of rules, in perspective. But once again, a political solution is called for to deal with the divergence between instrumentalism and consensus theories: the crisis of order will only be fully resolved once it reconciles individual freedom with community cohesion, and the sense of immanent order with possibility of community cohesion.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=262-265}}

Addressing the final unsolved problem of social theory, the problem of modernity, Unger concludes that we must reject the approaches offered by both liberalism, which views society as an association of individuals with conflicting ends and whose security and freedom are guaranteed by the rule of law, and Marxism, which sees society as a structure of class domination whose true character is hidden by the prevailing ideology. Unger argues we must focus on the interplay between belief and experience, consciousness and organization, in the study of modernity. This interplay takes new forms as history unfolds. The political problem presented by modernity—a problem confronted by postliberal, traditionalist, and revolutionary socialist societies—is the problem of reconciling freedom and community. Harmonizing the sense of latent order in society with the capacity to let will remake social arrangements is the key to reconciling freedom and community.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=265-266}}

==Reception==

[[Talcott Parsons]] reviewed ''Law in Modern Society'' for the ''[[Law &amp; Society Review]]'', and offered qualified praise for Unger's work. "The book is important because it contains one of the sharpest and clearest statements of the problem of what the author calls the place of a legal system in a total and complex society."{{sfn|Parsons|1977|p=145}} However, Parsons contends that Unger erroneously claims that law as a social phenomenon is restricted to its interpenetration with the state. Parsons also "disagree[s] with [Unger's] characterization of the legal system as ''part of the structure of modern societies''."{{sfn|Parsons|1977|p=149}} Parsons concludes: "His is both an important and a good book, but it does not give the reader a
competent and comprehensive appraisal of the issues which contemporary legal and 'social' theory need to confront in their mutual pursuit of an understanding of legal systems."{{sfn|Parsons|1977|p=149}}

Manning J. Dauer reviewed ''Law in Modern Society'' in ''[[The Journal of Politics]]'', describing the book as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;an able work arguing for a new synthesis in social sciences and in legal theory. The argument that traditionalistic aspects now need modifying is well presented. The rule of law is an important concept, but it has to be adapted to more individualistic judgments as the social sciences impinge on traditionalistic interpretations. Might he consider John Rawls's attempt to define Social Justice? Unger points out the need and the difficulties; the method whereby this will be achieved is still in process, but the dilemma presented to the social sciences is well stated.{{sfn|Dauer|1977|p=1106}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

German sociologist Klaus Eder considered ''Law in Modern Society'' alongside [[Donald Black (sociologist)|Donald Black]]'s ''The Behavior of Law''. Eder considered Unger's argument in detail, and concluded that Unger offered a promising research program for a sociological study of law:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This model of the evolution of law is an interesting working hypothesis, which may be especially fruitful for the analysis of changes in modern law. [Unger's] book is ... neither more nor less than a research program, probably a fruitful one, for the sociological study of law on two levels: a synchronic structural description of forms of normative order and a diachronic social-historical analysis of the factors that produce structural transformations of law.{{sfn|Eder|1977|p=142-143}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[James B. Stewart|James Stewart]] reviewed ''Law in Modern Society'' for the ''[[Journal of Economic Issues]]'', writing that "this book should be read by those seeking to escape the limitations of existing social theory and particularly neoclassical economics. In particular, Unger's emphasis on the need to undertake cross-cultural analyses and his careful delineation of alternative concepts of law provide a useful guide for further developments in institutional economics."{{sfn|Stewart|1976|pp=990-991}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Neil T. Duxbury wrote a retrospective assessment of ''Law in Modern Society'' in ''[[The Modern Law Review]]''. Duxbury acknowledges Unger's commitment to "straddle the frontiers of social theory" in both ''[[Knowledge and Politics]]'' and ''Law in Modern Society'', calling this persistence in addressing the most difficult questions of social theory a "defining feature of the book." However, Duxbury finds fault with the book, contending that

&lt;blockquote&gt;Unger's notion of post-liberalism is awash with over-generalised arguments. Contrary to his own suggestions, there appears to be no reason why the corporatist tendency within post-liberalism should result not only in a move towards the establishment of substantive justice, but also in the maintenance of the liberal tendency towards formal justice.{{sfn|Duxbury|1986|p=673}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Duxbury concludes that Unger's work operates at such a vague and abstract level of generality, that his work might be invalidated by empirical evidence left unexplored by Unger:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Unger has continued to develop his 'modernist' position with a conceptual vagueness which suggests not so much that he should be criticised for theorising at a selected level of abstraction, but rather that, so long as he continues to operate at this level, he will always, if only potentially, be open to the charge of failing to pay sufficient attention to the empirical evidence on offer-evidence which may sometimes invalidate the conceptualisations to which he ascribes.{{sfn|Duxbury|1986|p=679}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Alfred P. Rubin offered high praise for ''Law in Modern Society'' in ''Perspective'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is impossible to do justice to this book in a short review. The evolution of society from status to contract and back to status has been noted by many other writers, but Professor Unger's framework for social analysis is in large part original, accessible only to sophisticated scholars, and possibly seminal.{{sfn|Rubin|1976|p=114}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Motility also refers to an organism's ability to move food through its [[gastrointestinal tract|digestive tract]]. There are two types of intestinal motility – [[peristalsis]] and [[segmentation contractions|segmentation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{EMedicine|article|179937|Intestinal Motility Disorders}}&lt;/ref&gt; This motility is brought about by the contraction of smooth muscles in the gastrointestinal tract which mix the luminal contents with various secretions (segmentation) and to move contents through the digestive tract from the mouth to the anus (peristalsis).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vander's Human Physiology: The Mechanisms of Body Function (14th ed).|last=Wildmarier, Eric P.; Raff, Hershel; Strang, Kevin T.|first=|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=2016|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=528|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cellular-level motility==
At the cellular level, different modes of motility exist:
* [[flagellar motility]], a swimming-like motion (observed for example in [[spermatozoa]], propelled by the regular beat of their [[flagellum]], or ''[[E. coli]]'', which swims by rotating a helical prokaryotic flagellum)
* [[amoeboid movement]], a crawling-like movement, which also makes swimming possible&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0027532 |pmid=22096590 |pmc=3212573 |title=Amoeboid Cells Use Protrusions for Walking, Gliding and Swimming |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=6 |issue=11 |pages=e27532 |year=2011 |last1=Van Haastert |first1=Peter J.

Many cells are not motile, for example ''[[Klebsiella pneumoniae]]'' and ''[[Shigella]]'', or under specific circumstances such as ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'' at 37&amp;nbsp;°C.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Muscle contraction==
The [[nervous system]] and [[Human musculoskeletal system|musculoskeletal system]] control the majority of mammalian motility.   [[Gastrointestinal physiology#Motility|Gastrointestinal motility]] is essential for digestion.

==Movements==
{{see also|Taxis}}
The events that are perceived as movements can be directed:
* along a chemical gradient (see [[chemotaxis]])
* along a temperature gradient (see [[thermotaxis]])
* along a light gradient (see [[phototaxis]])
* along a magnetic field line (see [[magnetotaxis]])
* along an electric field (see [[galvanotaxis]])
* along the direction of the gravitational force (see [[gravitaxis]])
* along a rigidity gradient (see [[durotaxis]])
* along a gradient of cell adhesion sites (see [[haptotaxis]])
* along other cells or [[biopolymer]]s

Aquatic fungi – Are they planktonic?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aquatic fungi can be classified using three groups:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Lower fungi''' - adapted to marine habitats ([[Zoospore|zoosporic]] fungi, including mastigomycetes: [[oomycete]]s &amp; [[chytridiomycetes]])
* '''Higher fungi''' -filamentous, modified to planktonic lifestyle ([[hyphomycetes]], [[Ascomycota|ascomycetes]], [[Basidiomycota|basidiomycetes]])
* '''Terrestrial fungi''' - contain appendages of marine fungi ([[trichomycetes]])
The majority of mycoplankton species are higher fungi, found in the [[Ascomycota]] and [[Basidiomycota]] phylums.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

According to fossil records, fungi date back to the late [[Proterozoic]] era, 900-570 million years ago. It is hypothesized that mycoplankton evolved from terrestrial fungi, likely in the [[Paleozoic]] era (390 million years ago).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Marine Fungi: and Fungal-like Organisms|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=RcF97cHppPsC|publisher = Walter de Gruyter|date = 2012-08-31|isbn = 9783110264067|first = E. B. Gareth|last = Jones|first2 = Ka-Lai|last2 = Pang}}&lt;/ref&gt; The methods and pathways of terrestrial fungi's adaption to the marine environment are still under study.

== Biogeochemical Contributions ==
The primary role of all fungi is to degrade detrital [[organic matter]] from plants,&lt;ref&gt;Carlile MJ, Watkinson SC, Gooday GW (2001) The fungi. San Diego: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Molecular approaches for assessing fungal diversity in marine substrata|url = http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/bot.2005.48.issue-5/bot.2005.046/bot.2005.046.xml|journal = Botanica Marina|volume = 48|issue = 5–6|doi = 10.1515/bot.2005.046|first = Ka-Lai|last = Pang|first2 = Julian I.|last2 = Mitchell|year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and mycoplankton is no exception. By working with microbial communities, mycoplankton efficiently converts particulate organic matter to dissolved organic matter as part of the [[Biogeochemical cycle|biogeochemical]] cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Marine snow, organic solute plumes, and optimal chemosensory behavior of bacteria|journal = Limnology and Oceanography|date = 2001-09-01|issn = 1939-5590|pages = 1309–1318|volume = 46|issue = 6|doi = 10.4319/lo.2001.46.6.1309|first = Thomas|last = Kiørboe|first2 = George A.|last2 = Jackson|citeseerx = 10.1.1.570.5719}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mycoplankton and heterotrophic bacteria mediate carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and other nutrient fluxes in marine ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Benthic Bacterial and Fungal Productivity and Carbon Turnover in a Freshwater Marsh|url = http://aem.asm.org/content/72/1/596|journal = Applied and Environmental Microbiology|date = 2006-01-01|issn = 0099-2240|pmc = 1352256|pmid = 16391096|pages = 596–605|volume = 72|issue = 1|doi = 10.1128/AEM.72.1.596-605.2006|first = Nanna|last = Buesing|first2 = Mark O.|last2 = Gessner}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been shown that there are higher concentrations of mycoplankton near the surface and in shallow waters, which indicates their connection with the upwelling of organic matter. This further correlates with abundant [[phytoplankton]] communities at the surface, implying that mycoplankton is intimately involved in organic matter consumption in the [[Photic zone|euphotic]] zone.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Distribution and Diversity of Planktonic Fungi in the West Pacific Warm Pool|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0101523.s001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The database was established as collaboration between the U.S. [[National Cancer Institute]], [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]] and [[Nature Publishing Group]] in 2005 and was launched in November 2006. In September 2012, active curation was stopped but the data will be available for one year after that date.

==Database content==
As of November 2007, the database contained 59 pathways (comprising 3309 molecular interactions) curated by the NCI-Nature editorial team. New pathways are added each month. The database also contains 254 pathways (comprising 3003 interactions) imported from the June 2004 edition of the [[BioCarta]] pathway database.

The NCI-Nature curated data is gathered from published research literature and reviewed by expert scientists before publication. Evidence codes are assigned to each molecular interaction, which allows users to evaluate the reliability of the interactions or to search for interactions identified by particular experimental techniques.

==Data output and download==
The database content can be viewed in self-contained, pre-defined pathways. The database can also dynamically generate interaction networks to visualize the results of database searches. Pathways and dynamically generated networks are displayed in GIF and SVG images and can be downloaded as [[XML]] (including the standard pathway interchange format, [[BioPAX]]). The entire database is also available for download.

{{redirect|Narrator}}
'''Narration''' is the use of a written or spoken commentary to convey a [[narrative|story]] to an [[audience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Narration in Poetry and Drama|author-last1=Hühn|author-first1=Peter|author-last2=Sommer|author-first2=Roy|work=The Living Handbook of Narratology|year=2012|publisher=Interdisciplinary Center for Narratology, University of Hamburg|url=http://www.lhn.uni-hamburg.de/article/narration-poetry-and-drama}}&lt;/ref&gt; Narration encompasses a set of techniques through which the [[author|creator of the story]] presents their story, including:
* '''Narrative point of view'''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ezproxy.dacc.edu:4443/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.dacc.edu:4048/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=ers&amp;AN=98402287&amp;site=eds-live|title=Narration|last=Woltag|first=Laura|date=2012|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;: the perspective (or type of personal or non-personal "lens") through which a story is communicated
* '''Narrative voice'''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;: the format through which a story is communicated
* '''Narrative time''': the [[grammatical tense|grammatical placement]] of the story's time-frame in the past, the present, or the future.

A ''narrator'' is a personal character or a non-personal voice that the creator (author) of the story develops to deliver information to the audience, particularly about the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]]. In the case of most written narratives (novels, short stories, poems, etc.), the narrator typically functions to convey the story in its entirety. The narrator may be a voice devised by the author as an anonymous, non-personal, or stand-alone entity; as the author as a character; or as some other fictional or non-fictional character appearing and participating within their own story. The narrator is considered ''participant'' if he/she is a character within the story, and  ''non-participant'' if he/she is an implied character or an omniscient or semi-omniscient being or voice that merely relates the story to the audience without being involved in the actual events. Some stories have [[multiperspectivity|multiple narrators]] to illustrate the storylines of various characters at the same, similar, or different times, thus allowing a more complex, non-singular point of view.

Narration encompasses not only ''who'' tells the story, but also ''how'' the story is told (for example, by using [[stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] or [[unreliable narrator|unreliable narration]]). In traditional literary narratives (such as [[novels]], [[short stories]], and [[memoir]]s), narration is a required [[literary element|story element]]; in other types of (chiefly non-literary) narratives, such as plays, television shows, video games, and films, narration is merely optional.

== Narrative point of view ==
Narrative point of view or narrative perspective describes the position of the narrator, that is, the character of the storyteller, in relation to the story being told.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=James McCracken|title=The Oxford English Dictionary |url=http://www.oed.com/|accessdate=October 16, 2011|edition=Online|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be thought of as a camera mounted on the narrator's shoulder that can also look back inside the narrator's mind.

=== First-person ===
{{Main article|First-person narrative}}
With the ''first-person'' point of view, a story is revealed through a narrator who is also explicitly a [[Character (arts)|character]] within his or her own story. In a first person narrative, the narrator can create a close relationship between the reader and the writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wyile|first=Andrea Schwenke|date=1999|title=Expanding the View of First-Person Narration|journal=Children's Literature in Education|language=en|volume=30|issue=3|pages=185–202|doi=10.1023/a:1022433202145|issn=0045-6713}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the narrator reveals the plot by referring to this viewpoint character with forms of "I" (that is, the narrator is a person who openly acknowledges his or her own existence) or, when part of a larger group, "we". Frequently, the narrator is the [[protagonist]], whose inner thoughts are expressed to the audience, even if not to any of the other characters. A conscious narrator, as a human participant of past events, is an incomplete witness by definition, unable to fully see and comprehend events in their entirety as they unfurl, not necessarily objective in their inner thoughts or sharing them fully, and furthermore may be pursuing some hidden agenda. Forms include temporary first-person narration as a [[story within a story]], wherein a narrator or character observing the telling of a story by another is reproduced in full, temporarily and without interruption shifting narration to the speaker. The first-person narrator can also be the [[focal character]].

=== Second-person ===

The ''second-person'' point of view is a point of view where the audience is made a character. This is done with the use of the pronouns "you", "your", and "yours." The narrator is trying to address the audience, not necessarily directly, but rather to administer more of a connection. Stories and novels in second person are comparatively rare.  Examples include the short fiction of [[Lorrie Moore]] and [[Junot Díaz]]. An example in contemporary literature is [[Jay McInerney]]'s ''[[Bright Lights, Big City (novel)|Bright Lights, Big City]],'' in which the second-person narrator is observing his life from a distance as a way to cope with a trauma he keeps hidden from readers for most of the book.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;"You are not the kind of guy who would be at a place like this at this time of the morning. But here you are, and you cannot say that the terrain is entirely unfamiliar, although the details are fuzzy."—Opening lines of [[Jay McInerney]]'s ''[[Bright Lights, Big City (novel)|Bright Lights, Big City]]'' (1984)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== {{anchor|third}}Third-person&lt;!-- Section linked from [[Horus Heresy (novels)]] --&gt; ===
In the ''third-person'' narrative mode, characters are referred to by the narrator as "he", "she", or "they", but never as "I" or "we" (first-person), or "you" (second-person). This makes it clear that the narrator is an unspecified [[entity]] or uninvolved person who conveys the story and is not a character of any kind within the story, or at least is not referred to as such.&lt;ref name="Ricoeur1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Ricoeur|title=Time and Narrative|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vjBw9NuSkuEC&amp;pg=PA89|date=15 September 1990|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-71334-2|pages=89–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, third-person narration is the most commonly used narrative mode in literature. It does not require that the narrator's existence be explained or developed as a particular character, as with a first-person narrator. It thus allows a story to be told without detailing any information about the teller (narrator) of the story. Instead, a third-person narrator is often simply some disembodied "commentary" or "voice", rather than a fully developed character. Sometimes, third-person narration is called the  "he/she" perspective.&lt;ref&gt;[http://signbook.persiangig.com/document/literature/theory/raavi1.pdf Ranjbar Vahid.  ''The Narrator'', Iran: Baqney 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

The third-person modes are usually categorized along two axes. The first is the subjectivity/objectivity axis, with ''third person subjective'' narration describing one or more character's personal feelings and thoughts, and ''third person objective'' narration not describing the feelings or thoughts of any characters but, rather, just the exact facts of the story. The second axis is the omniscient/limited axis, a distinction that refers to the knowledge held by the narrator. A ''third person omniscient'' narrator has, or seems to have, access to knowledge of all characters, places, and events of the story, including any given characters' thoughts; however, a ''third person limited '' narrator, in contrast, knows information about, and within the minds of, only a limited number of characters (often just one character). A limited narrator cannot describe anything outside of a focal character's particular knowledge and experiences.

=== Alternating person ===
While the tendency for novels (or other narrative works) is to adopt a single point of view throughout the entire novel, some authors have experimented with other points of view that, for example, alternate between different narrators who are all first-person, or alternate between a first- and a third-person narrative perspective. The ten books of the ''[[Pendragon: Journal of an Adventure through Time and Space|Pendragon]]'' adventure series, by [[D. J. MacHale]], switch back and forth between a first-person perspective (handwritten journal entries) of the main character along his journey and the disembodied third-person perspective of his friends back home.&lt;ref name="White"&gt;White, Claire E (2004). "[http://www.writerswrite.com/journal/oct04/a-conversation-with-d-j-machale-10041 A Conversation With D.J. MacHale]." ''The Internet Writing Journal''. Writer Write, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Margaret Atwood]]'s ''[[Alias Grace]]'' provides one character's viewpoint from first-person as well as another character's from third-person limited. Often, a narrator using the first person will try to be more objective by also employing the third person for important action scenes, especially those in which they are not directly involved or in scenes where they are not present to have viewed the events in firsthand. This mode is found in [[Barbara Kingsolver]]'s ''[[The Poisonwood Bible]]''.

[[Audrey Niffenegger]]'s ''[[The Time Traveler's Wife]]'' is a love story, told in alternating first person. This novel alternates between an art student named Clare, and a librarian named Henry. Henry’s disorder called Chronic-Displacement causes him to be put in the wrong time. He is then put in emotional parts from his past and future, going back and forth in time. [[John Green (author)|John Green]] &amp; [[David Levithan]]'s novel ''[[Will Grayson, Will Grayson]]'' rotates between two boys both named Will Grayson. It alternates between both boys telling their part of the story, how they meet and how their lives then come together. [[Nick Hornby]]'s ''[[A Long Way Down]]'' has four narrators who also, are its main characters. These four characters meet at the top of a tall building known as “the suicide spot” and begin to talk instead of jumping. They then form a group, and continue to meet up.

== Narrative voice ==
The narrative voice is essential for story telling, because it's setting up the story for the reader, for example, by "viewing" a character's thought processes, reading a letter written for someone, retelling a character's experiences, etc.

=== Stream-of-consciousness voice ===
{{Main article|Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)}}
A ''stream of consciousness'' gives the (typically first-person) narrator's perspective by attempting to replicate the thought processes—as opposed to simply the actions and spoken words—of the narrative character. Often, interior monologues and inner desires or motivations, as well as pieces of incomplete thoughts, are expressed to the audience but not necessarily to other characters. Examples include the multiple narrators' feelings in William Faulkner's ''[[The Sound and the Fury]]'' and ''[[As I Lay Dying (novel)|As I Lay Dying]]'', and the character Offred's often fragmented thoughts in [[Margaret Atwood]]'s ''[[The Handmaid's Tale]]''. Irish writer [[James Joyce]] exemplifies this style in his novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''.

=== Character voice ===
One of the most common narrative voices, used especially with first- and third-person viewpoints, is the ''character voice'', in which a conscious "person" (in most cases, a living human being) is presented as the narrator; this character is called a ''viewpoint character''. In this situation, the narrator is no longer an unspecified entity; rather, the narrator is a more relatable, realistic character who may or may not be involved in the actions of the story and who may or may not take a biased approach in the [[storytelling]]. If the character is directly involved in the plot, this narrator is also called the viewpoint character. The viewpoint character is not necessarily the focal character: examples of supporting viewpoint characters include [[Doctor Watson]], Scout in ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'', and Nick Carraway of ''[[The Great Gatsby]]''.

==== Unreliable voice ====
{{Main article|Unreliable narrator}}
The unreliable narrative voice involves the use of an untrustworthy narrator. This mode may be employed to give the audience a deliberate sense of disbelief in the story or a level of suspicion or mystery as to what information is meant to be true and what is meant to be false. The narrator of Poe's "[[The Tell-Tale Heart]]," for example, is significantly biased, unknowledgeable, ignorant, childish, or is perhaps purposefully trying to deceive the audience.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Unreliable narrators are usually first-person narrators; however, a third-person narrator may be unreliable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/jlse.2017.46.issue-1/jls-2017-0005/jls-2017-0005.xml Unreliable Third Person Narration? The Case of Katherine Mansfield], ''Journal of Literary Semantics,'' Vol. 46, Issue 1, April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Epistolary voice ===
{{Main article|Epistolary novel}}

The ''epistolary narrative voice'' uses a (usually fictional) series of letters and other documents to convey the plot of the story. Although epistolary works can be considered multiple-person narratives, they also can be classified separately, as they arguably have no narrator at all—just an author who has gathered the documents together in one place. One example is [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]],'' which is a story written in a sequence of letters. Another is [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]'', which tells the story in a series of diary entries, letters and newspaper clippings. ''[[Les Liaisons dangereuses]] (Dangerous Liaisons), ''by [[Pierre Choderlos de Laclos]], is again made up of the correspondence between the main characters, most notably the Marquise de Merteuil and the Vicomte de Valmont. Langston Hughes does the same thing in a shorter form in his story "Passing", which consists of a young man's letter to his mother.

=== Third-person voices ===
The third-person narrative voices are narrative-voice techniques employed solely under the category of the third-person view.

==== {{anchor|omni3}}Third-person, omniscient&lt;!-- Section linked from [[Horus Heresy (novels)]] --&gt; ====
Historically, the ''third-person omniscient'' (or simply ''omniscient'') perspective has been the most commonly used in narrative writing; it is seen in countless classic novels, including works by [[Charles Dickens]], [[Leo Tolstoy]], and [[George Eliot]]. A story in this narrative mode is presented by a narrator with an overarching point of view, seeing and knowing everything that happens within the world of the story, including what each of the characters is thinking and feeling.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Herman |first1=David |last2=Jahn |first2=Manfred |last3=Ryan |title=Routledge Encyclopedia of Narrative Theory |year=2005 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-0-415-28259-8 |page=442}}&lt;/ref&gt; It sometimes even takes a subjective approach. One advantage of omniscience is that this mode enhances the sense of objective reliability (that is, truthfulness) of the plot. The third-person omniscient narrator is the least capable of being unreliable – although the character of omniscient narrator can have its own personality, offering judgments and opinions on the behavior of the story characters.

In addition to reinforcing the sense of the narrator as reliable (and thus of the story as true), the main advantage of this mode is that it is eminently suited to telling huge, sweeping, epic stories, and/or complicated stories involving numerous characters. The disadvantage of this mode is the increased distance between the audience and the story, and the fact that – when used in conjunction with a sweeping, epic "cast-of-thousands" story – characterization tends to be limited, thus reducing the reader's ability to identify with or sympathize with the characters. A classic example of both the advantages and disadvantages of this mode is [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.

==== Third-person, subjective ====
The ''third-person subjective'' is when the narrator conveys the thoughts, feelings, and opinions of one or more characters. If there is just one character, it can be termed ''third-person limited'', in which the reader is "limited" to the thoughts of some particular character (often the [[protagonist]]) as in the first-person mode, except still giving personal descriptions using "he", "she", "it", and "they", but not "I". This is almost always the main character (for example, Gabriel in [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[The Dead (short story)|The Dead]]'', [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s ''[[Young Goodman Brown]]'', or Santiago in [[Ernest Hemingway|Hemingway]]'s ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]''). Certain third-person omniscient modes are also classifiable as "third person, subjective" modes that switch between the thoughts and feelings of all the characters.

This style, in both its limited and omniscient variants, became the most popular narrative perspective during the 20th century. In contrast to the broad, sweeping perspectives seen in many 19th-century novels, third-person subjective is sometimes called the "over the shoulder" perspective; the narrator only describes events perceived and information known by a character. At its narrowest and most subjective scope, the story reads as though the viewpoint character were narrating it; dramatically this is very similar to the first person, in that it allows in-depth revelation of the protagonist's personality, but it uses third-person grammar. Some writers will shift perspective from one viewpoint character to another, such as in [[Robert Jordan]]'s ''[[The Wheel of Time]]'', or [[George R. R. Martin]]'s ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]''.

The [[focal character]], [[protagonist]], [[antagonist]], or some other character's thoughts are revealed through the narrator. The reader learns the events of the narrative through the perceptions of the chosen character.

==== Third-person, objective ====
The ''third-person objective'' employs a narrator who tells a story without describing any character's thoughts, opinions, or feelings; instead, it gives an [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]], unbiased point of view. Often the narrator is self-dehumanized in order to make the narrative more neutral. This type of narrative mode, outside of fiction, is often employed by newspaper articles, biographical documents, and scientific journals. This narrative mode can be described as a "fly-on-the-wall" or "camera lens" approach that can only record the observable actions but does not interpret these actions or relay what thoughts are going through the minds of the characters. Works of fiction that use this style emphasize characters acting out their feelings observably. Internal thoughts, if expressed, are given voice through an aside or soliloquy. While this approach does not allow the author to reveal the unexpressed thoughts and feelings of the characters, it does allow the author to reveal information that not all or any of the characters may be aware of. A typical example of this so-called ''camera-eye perspective'' is ''[[Hills Like White Elephants]]'' by [[Ernest Hemingway]].

This narrative mode is also called the ''third-person dramatic'' because the narrator, like the audience of a drama, is neutral and ineffective toward the progression of the plot—merely an uninvolved onlooker. It was also used around the mid-20th century by French novelists writing in the ''nouveau roman'' tradition.{{citation needed|date = October 2013}}

==== Third-person, free/indirect ====
{{main|Free indirect speech}}
The third person indirect style or [[Free indirect speech|free indirect style]] is a method of presenting a character's voice freely and spontaneously in the middle of an otherwise third-person non-personal narrator.

==== Third-person, alternating ====

Many stories, especially in literature, alternate between the third person limited and third person omniscient. In this case, an author will move back and forth between a more [[omniscient]] third-person narrator to a more personal third-person limited narrator. Typically, like the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' series and the books by [[George R. R. Martin]], a switch of third-person limited viewpoint on some character is done only at chapter boundaries. ''[[The Home and the World]]'', written in 1916 by [[Rabindranath Tagore]], is another example of a book switching among just three characters at chapter boundaries. In ''[[The Heroes of Olympus]]'' series the point of view changes between characters at intervals.The ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series is told in "third person limited" (in which the reader is "limited" to the thoughts of some particular character) for much of the seven novels. However, it deviates to omniscient on occasions, particularly during the opening chapters of later novels in the series, which switch from the limited view of the eponymous Harry to other characters (for example, Snape).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince|last=Rowling|first=J.K.|publisher=Bloomsbury|year=2005|isbn=978-0-7475-8108-6|location=London|pages=6–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Narrative time ==
The ''narrative tense'' or ''narrative time'' determines the [[grammatical tense]] of the story, meaning whether it is presented as occurring before, during, or after the time of narration, that is, in the past, present, or future. In narration using the past tense, the events of the plot are depicted as occurring before the time at which the narrative was constructed or expressed to an audience or before the present moment; this is by far the most common tense in which stories are expressed. In the present tense, the events of the plot are depicted as occurring now—at the current moment—in [[present|real time]]. In English, this tense, also known as the "[[historical present]]", is more common in spontaneous conversational narratives than in written literature, though it is sometimes used in literature to give a sense of immediacy of the actions. A recent example of novels narrated in the present tense are those of the ''[[Hunger Games]]'' trilogy by [[Suzanne Collins]]. The future tense is the most rare, portraying the events of the plot as occurring some time after the present moment, in a time-period yet to come. Often, these upcoming events are described such that the narrator has foreknowledge (or supposed foreknowledge) of the future, so many future-tense stories have a [[prophecy|prophetic]] tone.

== Other narrative modes ==

=== Fiction-writing mode ===
''Narration'' has more than one meaning. In its broadest sense, narration encompasses all forms of storytelling, fictional or not: personal anecdotes, "true crime", and historical narratives all fit here, along with many other non-fiction forms. More narrowly, however, the term ''narration'' refers to all written fiction. In its most restricted sense, narration is the fiction-writing mode whereby the narrator communicates directly to the reader.

Along with [[Exposition (literary technique)|exposition]], [[Argumentation theory|argumentation]], and [[description]], narration (broadly defined) is one of four [[rhetorical modes]] of discourse. In the context of rhetorical modes, the purpose of narration is to tell a story or to narrate an event or series of events. Narrative may exist in a variety of forms: biographies, anecdotes, short stories, or novels. In this context, all written fiction may be viewed as narration.

Narrowly defined, narration is the fiction-writing mode whereby the narrator is communicating directly to the reader. But if the broad definition of narration includes all written fiction, and the narrow definition is limited merely to that which is directly communicated to the reader, then what comprises the rest of written fiction? The remainder of written fiction would be in the form of any of the other fiction-writing modes. Narration, as a fiction-writing mode, is a matter for discussion among fiction writers and writing coaches.

The ability to use the different points of view is one measure of a person's writing skill. The writing [[Marking scheme|mark schemes]] used for [[National Curriculum assessment]]s in [[England]] reflect this: they encourage the awarding of marks for the use of viewpoint as part of a wider judgment.

=== Other types and uses ===
In literature, ''person'' is used to describe the viewpoint from which the [[narrative]] is presented. Although second-person perspectives are occasionally used, the most commonly encountered are first and third person. ''Third person omniscient'' specifies a viewpoint in which readers are provided with information not available to characters within the story; without this qualifier, readers may or may not have such information.

In [[film|movies]] and [[video game]]s first- and third-person describe [[virtual camera system|camera viewpoints]]. The first-person is from a character's own perspective, and the third-person is the more familiar, "general" camera showing a scene. A so-called second-person may also be used to show a main character from a secondary character's perspective.

For example, in a [[horror film]], the first-person perspective of an [[antagonist]] could become a second-person perspective on a potential victim's actions. A third-person shot of the two characters could be used to show the narrowing distance between them.

In video games, a first-person perspective is used most often in the [[first-person shooter]] genre, such as in ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', or in simulations (racing games, flight [[Simulation video game|simulation games]], and such). Third-person perspectives on characters are typically used in all other games. Since the arrival of [[3D computer graphics]] in games it is often possible for the player to switch between first- and third-person perspectives at will; this is usually done to improve spatial awareness, but can also improve the accuracy of weapons use in generally third-person games such as the ''[[Metal Gear Solid]]'' franchise.

Text-based [[interactive fiction]] conventionally has descriptions written in the second person (though exceptions exist), telling the character what they are seeing and doing, such as [[Zork]]. This practice is also encountered occasionally in text-based segments of graphical games, such as those from [[Spiderweb Software]] which make ample use of second person flavor text in pop up text boxes with character and location descriptions.  [[Charles Stross]]'s novel [[Halting State]] was written in second person as an allusion to this style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-441-01498-9|title=Halting State, Review|work=Publishers Weekly|date=1 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2012/05/and-another-thing.html|title=And another thing|author=Charles Stross}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Things which are able to be laundered or are disposable should be made available to the dam. Items which can be ingested by the dam should be placed out of reach.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; (They also sometimes do this in cases of [[false pregnancy]], or pseudocyesis). [[Domestic cat]]s often make nests by bringing straw, cloth scraps, and other soft materials to a selected nook or box; they particularly are attracted to [[hayloft]]s as nest sites. Commercial [[Whelping box|Whelping]] and queening boxes are available however, children's wading pools (dogs) and plastic dishpans (cats) work just as well.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In birds it is known as "going broody", and is characterized by the insistence to stay on the nest as much as possible, and by cessation of laying new eggs.

For the first two weeks of the piglets life their physiological thermoregulation is still developing, and due to a lack of amount of brown fat tissue, piglets require an increased surrounding temperature. Without the protection of the nest, the piglets will be subjected to climatic influences causing their internal temperature to drop to life-threatening levels.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Farrowing crate]]s have been widely implemented into modern pig husbandry in order to reduce piglet mortality via crushing. However, this type of housing disturbs the sows natural instinct to nest build due to lack of space. Thus, it is necessary for the sows to farrow without the performance of this natural pre-partum activity which results in high stress for the animal.

In [[rodent]]s and [[lagomorph]]s, the nesting instinct is typically characterized by the urge to seek the lowest sheltered spot available; this is where these [[mammals]] give birth. Rats, for example, prefer to burrow amongst dense areas of vegetation or around human settlements which they come into contact with often.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Triunveri|first=Alfeo|date=24 May 2012|title=Rodents: Habitat, Pathology and Environmental Impact|url=https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/lib/mun/reader.action?docID=3020359&amp;ppg=3|journal=Animal Science, Issues and Professions|volume=|pages=1-194|via=ProQuest Ebook Central}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often some rodent species create burrows that develop microclimates. This is another way that nesting instinct aids in [[thermoregulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-05-01|title=The evolution of nesting behaviour in Peromyscus mice|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347218300897|journal=Animal Behaviour|language=en|volume=139|pages=103–115|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2018.03.008|issn=0003-3472}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alzheimer's disease in rats has been observed to impair the nesting ability, especially in females. These impairments become exaggerated with age and progression of disease.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===Hormones and nesting behavior===
Maternal nest-building is regulated by the hormonal actions of estradiol, progesterone, and prolactin. Given the importance of shelter to offspring survival and reproductive success, it is no wonder that a set of common hormonal signals has evolved. However, the exact timing and features of nest building vary among species, depending on endocrine and external factors.

The initial drive to perform this behaviour is stimulated internally via [[hormone]]s specifically a rise in prolactin levels. This increase is driven by an increase in prostaglandin and a decrease in progesterone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|authors=Algers, B. Uvnas-Moberg, K.|year=2007|title=Maternal behaviour in pigs|url=http://fulltext.study/preview/pdf/322972.pdf|journal=Hormones and Behavior|volume=52|pages=78–85|via=|doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2007.03.022|pmid=17482189}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second phase of nest building is driven by external stimuli, this phase is also known as the material-oriented phase. In this stage it is said that external stimuli such as the proper nest building materials must be present. Both internal and external stimuli must exist in conjunction with one another for nest building to commence. The cessation of the nesting building is correlated with a rise in [[oxytocin]] which is the hormone responsible for the contraction of the [[uterus]]. Shortly after this, parturition will commence.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In [[rabbit]]s, nest building occurs towards the last third of pregnancy. The mother digs and builds a nest of straw and grass, which she lines with hair plucked from her body. This sequential motor pattern is produced by changes in estradiol, progesterone, and prolactin levels. Six to eight days pre-partum, high levels of [[estradiol]] and [[progesterone]] lead to a peak in digging behavior. Both estradiol and progesterone are produced and released by the ovaries. One to three days pre-partum, straw-carrying behavior is expressed as a function of decreasing progesterone levels, maintenance of high estradiol levels, and increasing prolactin levels. This release of prolactin (from the [[anterior pituitary]]) is likely caused by the increase in estrogen-to-progesterone ratio. One day pre-partum to four days post-partum, hair loosening and plucking occur as a result of low progesterone and high prolactin levels, together with a decrease in testosterone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2826.1996.tb00818.x |title=Estradiol, Progesterone, and Prolactin Regulate Maternal Nest-Building in Rabbits |year=1996 |last1=González-Mariscal |first1=G. |last2=Melo |first2=A.

S. |journal=Journal of Neuroendocrinology |volume=8 |issue=12 |pages=901–7 |pmid=8953467}}&lt;/ref&gt; In house mice and golden hamsters, nest-building takes place earlier, at the start or middle of pregnancy. For these species, nest-building coincides with high levels of estrogen and progestin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0003-3472(71)80118-5 |title=Oestrogen and progesterone synergism and elicitation of maternal nest-building in the mouse (Mus musculus) |year=1971 |last1=Lisk |first1=Robert D. |journal=Animal Behaviour |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=606–10 |pmid=5156617}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0003-3472(69)90022-0 |title=Effects of oestrogen and progesterone on nest building in the golden hamster |year=1969 |last1=Richards |first1=M.P.M. |journal=Animal Behaviour |volume=17 |pages=356–61 |pmid=5388889 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

External factors also interact with hormones to influence maternal nest-building behavior. Pregnant rabbits that have been shaved will line their straw nest with available alternatives, such as male rabbit hair or synthetic hair. If given both straw and hair, mothers prefer straw during the straw-carrying period, and prefer hair during the nest-lining period. If given hair as the only material, shaved mothers collect the hair even when it is the straw-carrying period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1006/hbeh.1997.1425 |title=Hormones and External Factors: Are They "On/Off" Signals for Maternal Nest-Building in Rabbits? |year=1998 |last1=González-Mariscal |first1=G. |last2=Cuamatzi |first2=E. |last3=Rosenblatt |first3=J.S. |journal=Hormones and Behavior |volume=33 |pages=1–8 |pmid=9571007 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on avian paternal behavior shows that nest-building is triggered by different stimuli in the two sexes. Unlike the case for females, male nest-building among ring doves depends on the behavior of the prospective mate rather than on hormonal mechanisms. Males that are castrated and injected daily with testosterone either court females or build nests, depending purely on the behavior of the female. Hence, the male avian transition from courtship to nest-building is prompted by social cues and not by changes in hormone levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=27848517 |last=Silver |first1=Rae |year=1978 |title=The Parental Behavior of Ring Doves: The intricately coordinated behavior of the male and female is based on distinct physiological mechanisms in the sexes |journal=American Scientist |publisher=Sigma Xi |volume=66 |issue=2 |pages=209–15 |bibcode=1978AmSci..66..209S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In insects==
[[File:Tawny Mining Bee nest - Andrena Fulva 2d.jpg|thumb|Tawny Mining Bee (''Andrena fulva'') nest entrance]]
Nesting behavior is also present in many invertebrates. The best known example of nesting behavior in insects is that of the domestic [[honey bee]]. Most [[bee]]s build nests. Solitary bees, like honey bees, make nests. However, solitary bees make individual nests for larvae and are not always in colonies.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foxleas.com/make-a-bee-hotel.asp|title=Make a Bee Hotel - The Pollinator Garden|website=www.foxleas.com|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solitary bees will burrow into the ground, dead wood and plants.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://xerces.org/enhancing-habitat-for-native-bees/|title=Enhancing Habitat for Bees - The Xerces Society|work=The Xerces Society|access-date=2018-11-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In humans==

'''Nuclear transfer''' is a form of [[cloning]].  The steps involve removing the [[DNA]] from an [[oocyte]] (unfertilised egg), and injecting the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] which contains the DNA to be cloned. In rare instances, the newly constructed cell will divide normally, replicating the new DNA while remaining in a [[pluripotent]] state.  If the cloned cells are placed in the uterus of a [[female mammal]], a cloned organism develops to term in rare instances. This is how [[Dolly the Sheep]] and many [[list of animals that have been cloned|other species]] were cloned. Cows are commonly cloned to select those that have the best milk production. On 24 January 2018, two [[monkey]] [[Clone (cell biology)|clones]] were reported to have been created with the technique for the first time.&lt;ref name="CELL-20180124"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Liu, Zhen et al. |title=Cloning of Macaque Monkeys by Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer |url=http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(18)30057-6 |date=24 January 2018 |journal=[[Cell (journal)|Cell]] |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2018.01.020 |accessdate=24 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC-20180124"&gt;{{cite news |last=Briggs |first=Helen |title=First monkey clones created in Chinese laboratory |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-42809445 |date=24 January 2018 |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=24 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20180124"&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Associated Press]] |title=Scientists Successfully Clone Monkeys; Are Humans Up Next? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/01/24/science/ap-us-sci-cloned-monkeys.html |date=24 January 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=24 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this, the low efficiency of the technique has prompted some researchers, notably [[Ian Wilmut]], creator of [[Dolly (sheep)|Dolly]] the cloned sheep, to abandon it.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Highfield [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/3314696/Dolly-creator-Prof-Ian-Wilmut-shuns-cloning.html Dolly creator Prof Ian Wilmut shuns cloning]. The Telegraph. 16 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tools and reagents==
Nuclear transfer is a delicate process that is a major hurdle in the development of cloning technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnas.org/misc/classics4.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt; Materials used in this procedure are a microscope, a holding [[pipette]] (small vacuum) to keep the oocyte in place, and a [[micropipette]] (hair-thin needle) capable of extracting the nucleus of a cell using a vacuum.  For some species, such as mouse, a drill is used to pierce the outer layers of the oocyte.

Various chemical reagents are used to increase cloning efficiency. [[Microtubule]] inhibitors, such as [[nocodazole]], are used to arrest the oocyte in [[M phase]], during which its nuclear membrane is dissolved. Chemicals are also used to stimulate oocyte activation.  When applied the membrane is completely dissolved.

==Somatic cell nuclear transfer==
[[Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer]] (SCNT) is the process by which the nucleus of an oocyte (egg cell) is removed and is replaced with the nucleus of a somatic (body) cell (examples include skin, heart, or nerve cell). The two entities fuse to become one and factors in the oocyte cause the somatic nucleus to reprogram to a pluripotent state. The cell contains genetic information identical to the donated somatic cell. After stimulating this cell to begin dividing, in the proper conditions an embryo will develop. Stem cells can be extracted 5–6 days later and used for research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Reprogramming==
Genomic [[reprogramming]] is the key biological process behind nuclear transfer. Currently unidentified reprogramming factors present in oocytes are capable of initiating a cascade of events that can reset the mature, specialized cell back to an undifferentiated, embryonic state.  These factors are thought to be mainly proteins of the nucleus.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14171">'''Nutritional rating systems''' are methods of ranking or rating food products or food categories to communicate the nutritional value of food in a simplified manner to a target audience. Rating systems are developed by governments, nonprofit organizations, or private institutions and companies.

The methods may use point systems to rank or rate foods for general nutritional value or they may rate specific food attributes such as [[cholesterol]] content. Graphics or other symbols may be used to communicate the ratings to the target audience.

Nutritional rating systems differ from [[Nutrition facts label|nutritional labeling]] in that they attempt to simplify food choices, rather than listing specific amounts of nutrients or ingredients. [[Dietary guidelines]] are similar to nutritional rating systems in that they attempt to simplify the communication of nutritional information, however, they do not rate individual food products.

== Systems in use today ==

===Glycemic index===
[[Glycemic index]] is a ranking of how quickly [[food]] is metabolized into [[glucose]] when digested. It compares available [[carbohydrate]]s gram for gram in individual foods, providing a numerical, evidence-based index of postprandial (post-meal) [[Blood sugar|glycemia]]. The concept was invented by Dr. [[David J. Jenkins]] and colleagues in 1981 at the [[University of Toronto]].&lt;ref&gt;Brouns ''et al.'' (2005). "Glycaemic index methodology." ''Nutrition Research Reviews'' '''18'''; 145-171&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[glycemic load]] (GL) of food is a number that estimates how much the food will raise a person's [[blood glucose level]] after eating it.

===Guiding Stars===
Guiding Stars is patented food rating system that rates food based on [[nutrient density]] using a scientific [[algorithm]]. Foods are credited for [[vitamins]], minerals, [[dietary fibre]], whole grains, and [[Omega-3 fatty acids]], and debited for [[saturated fats]], [[trans fats]], added sodium ([[salt]]) and [[added sugar]]. Rated foods are marked with tags indicating one, two or three stars. The  program first launched a Hannaford Supermarkets in 2006, and is currently found in about 1,900 supermarkets in the US and Canada. Guiding Stars has also expanded into public schools, colleges and hospitals.&lt;ref name="guidingstars"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://guidingstars.ca/about/ | title=About | publisher=Guiding Stars Licensing Company | accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evidence-based proprietary algorithm is based on the dietary guidelines and recommendations of regulatory and health organizations including the US [[Food and Drug Administration]], the [[US Department of Agriculture]], and the [[World Health Organization]]. It was developed by a scientific advisory panel composed of experts in nutrition and health from [[Dartmouth College]], [[Harvard University]], [[Tufts University]], [[University of North Carolina]] and other colleges.&lt;ref name="guidingstars" /&gt;

===Nutripoints===
Nutripoints&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nutripoints.com/ |title=nutripoints.com |publisher=nutripoints.com |accessdate=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a system for rating foods on a numerical scale for their overall nutritional value. The method is based on an analysis of 26 positive (such as vitamins, minerals, protein, fiber) and negative factors (such as cholesterol, saturated fat, sugar, sodium) compared to the calories in the food. The overall Nutripoint score of the food is the result. The higher the value, the more nutrition per calorie (nutrient density) and the least negative factors in the food. Thus, the higher the Nutripoint score, the better the food for overall health. The system rates 3600+ foods including basic foods like apples and oranges, fast-foods, and brand-name foods.

Nutripoints was developed by Dr. Roy E. Vartabedian (a Doctor of Public Health) in the 1980s and was released to the general public in 1990 with his book, "Nutripoints," published in 13 countries and 10 languages worldwide. The food rating system is part of an overall program designed to help people measure, balance, and upgrade their diet's nutritional quality for overall health improvement and well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nutripoints: Healthy Eating Made Simple! (1990&amp;ndash;2010) |url= http://www.nutripoints.com/  |publisher= Nutripoints.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nutrition iQ===
The Nutrition iQ program is a joint venture of the Joslin Clinic and multi-banner supermarket operator [[SuperValu (United States)|Supervalu]].  The labeling system consists of color-coded tags denoting a food product's superior status with respect to attributes such as vitamin and mineral content, fiber content, 100% juice content, Omega-3 or low saturated fat content, whole grain content, calcium content, protein content, low or reduced sodium content and low or reduced caloric content.  The first phase of the program launched in 2009 covering center store food products, with coverage of fresh food departments rolling out in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110113005149/en/Fresh-Ideas-Healthy-Eating-SUPERVALU%C2%AE-Expands-%E2%80%9Cnutrition |title=Fresh Ideas for Healthy Eating: SUPERVALU Expands "nutrition iQ" Program, SUPERVALU, January 13, 2011 |publisher=Businesswire.com |date=2011-01-13 |accessdate=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===POINTS Food System===
[[Weight Watchers]] developed the POINTS Food System for use with their Flex Plan. Healthy weight control is the primary objective of the system. The system is designed to allow customers to eat any food while tracking the number of points for each food consumed. Members try to keep to their POINTS Target, a number of points for a given time frame. The daily POINTS Target is personalized based on members' height, weight and other factors, such as gender.

===Naturally Nutrient Rich (NNR) ===
Developed by [[Adam Drewnowski]], University of Washington, NNR&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Drewnowski|first=Adam|title=Concept of a nutritious food: toward a nutrient density score|url=http://www.ajcn.org/content/82/4/721.abstract|publisher=American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|accessdate=Jan 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "is based on mean percentage daily values (DVs) for 14 nutrients in 2000 kcal food, can be used to assign nutrient density values to foods within and across food groups. Use of the NNR score allows consumers to identify and select nutrient-dense foods while permitting some flexibility where the discretionary calories are concerned."

===ReViVer Score===
Developed by ReViVer, a nutritionally-oriented restaurant in New York City,&lt;ref name="Walt Street Journal"&gt;[https://online.wsj.com/articles/reviver-serves-healthy-food-backed-by-science-1407203647/ "ReViVer Serves Healthy Food Backed By Science"] ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', August 4, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  the ReViVer Score expresses the nutrient density of menu items from a variety of fast food and casual restaurants, based on the amount of 10 nutrients (Vitamins A, C, and E, folate, calcium, magnesium, potassium, iron, fiber, and omega-3 fats) per calorie. A score of 100 indicates that the meal provides at least 100% of the recommended daily intake for all ten nutrients, proportionate to the energy (calorie) content of the meal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The ReViVer Score|url=http://revivernyc.com#TheReviverScore |accessdate=Aug 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The score allows consumers to compare the nutritional quality of various restaurant offerings with similar calorie content.

===Nutrient Per Calorie===
Developed by Efficiency Is Everything, a Data Science website.&lt;ref name="Efficiency Is Everything"&gt;[http://efficiencyiseverything.com/nutrient-per-calorie/ "Nutrients Per Calorie – Math Proves The Healthiest Lowest Calorie Foods"] ''[[Efficiency Is Everything]]'', October 18, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  This expresses the amount of micronutrients in produce per the caloric value based on 40+ vitamins and minerals. Based off a sum of each nutrient vs that nutrients maximum value per calorie, Spinach, Parsely, Romaine Lettuce, and turnip greens top the list. This allows consumers to compare the nutritional quality of various produce.

==Systems used in the past==

===Smart Choices Program===
Launched late in 2009, the Smart Choices Program (SCP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Smart Choices Program|url=http://www.smartchoicesprogram.com/|accessdate=Jan 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a rating system developed by a coalition of companies from the food industry. The criteria for rating food products used 18 different attributes, however, the system had varying levels of acceptability based on 16 types of food which allowed for wide discretion in the selection of foods to include in the program. The program was discontinued in October 2009 after sharp criticism for including products such as "Froot Loops", "Lucky Charms" and "Frosted Flakes" as Smart Choices.&lt;ref name"smart choice"&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0458-3035| last = MacVean| first = Mary| title = 'Smart Choice' food label: a sign of nutrition or marketing?| work = Los Angeles Times| date = 2009-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=suspended&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| last = Neuman| first = William| title = ‘Smart Choices’ Food Labeling Loses Support| work = The New York Times| accessdate = 2018-08-24| date = 2009-10-23| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/24/business/24food.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence of the backlash from the program, [[General Mills]] announced on December 10, 2009 that it would reduce the amount of sugar in many of its cereal brands.

====Announcement of Closure====
On August 19, 2009, the FDA wrote a letter to SCP manager, saying: "FDA and FSIS would be concerned if any FOP labeling systems used criteria that were not stringent enough to protect consumers against misleading claims; were inconsistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans; or had the effect of encouraging consumers to choose highly processed foods and refined grains instead of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Michael R.|author2=Jerold R. Mande |title=Label Claims - Letter to the Smart Choces Program|url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/LabelingNutrition/LabelClaims/ucm180146.htm|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|date=August 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; SCP was suspended in 2009 after the FDA's announcement that they will be addressing both on front-of- package and on-shelf systems. SCP Chair Mike Hughes said: "It is more appropriate to postpone active operations and channel our information and learnings to the agency to support their initiative."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hughes|first=Mike|title=Smart Choices Program Postpones Active Operations|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/smart-choices-program-postpones-active-operations-65809752.html|publisher=PR Newswire|accessdate=Jan 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Claimed Rigor====
Smart Choices Program "was developed by a coalition of scientists and nutrition educators, experts with experience with dietary guidelines, public health organizations, and food manufacturers in response to consumer confusion over multiple front-of-the-package systems based on different criteria. Representatives from different government organizations acted as observers. The process of developing the program was facilitated by the nonprofit Keystone Center, an organization that develops consensus solutions to complex health and social policy changes. The nutrition criteria for receiving the SCP icon are specific for product category by indicating "smarter" products within that category. A calorie indicator noting calories per serving and servings per package accompanies the SCP icon to remind consumers that calories do count, even for smarter food choices. For a product to qualify, it first has to be below the threshold for "nutrients to limit" and then (in most cases) it must be above the threshold for one or more nutrients or food groups to encourage. The criteria are based on the 2005 Dietary Guidelines and other consensus science and are transparent and available on the SCP website."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2838">In the [[United States]] the '''Office of Ocean Exploration''' ('''OE''') (now '''Office of Ocean Exploration and  Research''')&lt;!-- since when? -all new documentation gives this name as at 2014-DadaNeem --&gt; is a division of the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) run under the auspices of the [[Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research]] (OAR).

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:ocean exploration.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Office of Ocean Exploration logo]] --&gt;

OE facilitates [[ocean exploration]] by supporting expeditions, exploration projects, and related field campaigns.  The focus of OE is very broad.  They act as early explorers of area of the [[ocean]] that have not been seen.  The goal is to bring information about the ocean that allows scientists to formulate questions that need to be answered about the ocean based on the preliminary information.  In essence, OE acts as a scout or vanguard, much as [[Lewis and Clark Expedition|Lewis and Clark]] did.

The mission of OE has four components:
* Mapping the [[Geography#Physical geography|physical]], [[biology|biological]], [[chemical compound|chemical]] and [[Archaeology|archaeological]] aspects of the ocean;
* Understanding ocean dynamics at new levels to describe the complex interactions of the living ocean;
* Developing new [[sensor]]s and systems to regain U.S. leadership in ocean technology;
* Reaching out to the public to communicate how and why unlocking the secrets of the ocean is well worth the commitment of time and resources, and to benefit current and future generations.

'''Prescriptive analytics''' is the third and final phase of [[business analytics]], which also includes descriptive and [[Predictive analytics|predictive]] analytics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Evans,James R.  |author2=Lindner, Carl H. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Business Analytics: The Next Frontier for Decision Sciences|journal=Decision Line|date=March 2012|volume=43|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LustigEtAl"&gt;http://www.analytics-magazine.org/november-december-2010/54-the-analytics-journey{{cite journal|last=Lustig,Irv, Dietrich, Brenda, Johnson, Christer, and Dziekan, Christopher|title=The Analytics Journey|journal=Analytics|date=Nov–Dec 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Referred to as the "final frontier of analytic capabilities,"&lt;ref&gt;https://www.globys.com/2013/06/gartner-terms-prescriptive-analytics-%E2%80%9Cfinal-frontier%E2%80%9D-analytic-capabilities&lt;/ref&gt; prescriptive analytics entails the application of [[mathematical sciences|mathematical]] and [[computational science]]s and suggests decision options to take advantage of the results of descriptive and predictive analytics.  The first stage of business analytics is descriptive analytics, which still accounts for the majority of all business analytics today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davenport,Tom |title=The three '..tives' of business analytics; predictive, prescriptive and descriptive|journal=CIO Enterprise Forum|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Descriptive analytics looks at past performance and understands that performance by mining historical data to look for the reasons behind past success or failure. Most management reporting – such as [[sales]], [[marketing]], [[Business operations|operations]], and [[finance]] – uses this type of post-mortem analysis.

[[File:Three Phases of Analytics.png|thumb|left|350px|Prescriptive Analytics extends beyond predictive analytics by specifying both the actions necessary to achieve predicted outcomes, and the interrelated effects of each decision]]The next phase is [[predictive analytics]]. Predictive analytics answers the question what is likely to happen. This is when historical data is combined with rules, [[algorithms]], and occasionally external data to determine the probable future outcome of an event or the likelihood of a situation occurring. The final phase is prescriptive analytics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haas, Peter J., Maglio, Paul P., Selinger, Patricia G., and Tan, Wang-Chie|title=Data is Dead…Without What-If Models|journal=Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment|year=2011|volume=4|number=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; which goes beyond predicting future outcomes by also suggesting actions to benefit from the predictions and showing the implications of each decision option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Stewart, Thomas. R. |author2=McMillan, Claude, Jr.  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Descriptive and Prescriptive Models for Judgment and Decision Making: Implications for Knowledge Engineering|journal=NATO AS1 Senes, Expert Judgment and Expert Systems|year=1987|volume=F35|pages=314–318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prescriptive analytics not only anticipates what will happen and when it will happen, but also why it will happen&lt;!-- There is no evidence nor citation supporting this statement. Furthermore, if prescriptive analytics analytics "not only anticipates what will happen and when it will happen, but also why it will happen, then what is the role of predictive modelling, forecasting and causal modelling? --&gt;. Further, prescriptive analytics suggests decision options on how to take advantage of a future opportunity or mitigate a future risk and shows the implication of each decision option. Prescriptive analytics can continually take in new data to re-predict and re-prescribe, thus automatically improving prediction accuracy&lt;!-- This lacks evidence and supporting citation. It does not follow that prediction accuracy improves as a result of re-predicting. --&gt; and prescribing better decision options. Prescriptive analytics ingests hybrid data, a combination of structured (numbers, categories) and unstructured data (videos, images, sounds, texts), and business rules to predict what lies ahead and to prescribe how to take advantage of this predicted future without compromising other priorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Riabacke, Mona, Danielson, Mats, and Ekenber, Love |title=State-of-the-Art Prescriptive Criteria Weight Elicitation|journal=Advances in Decision Sciences|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All three phases of analytics can be performed through professional services or technology or a combination.  In order to scale, prescriptive analytics technologies need to be adaptive to take into account the growing volume, velocity, and variety of data that most mission critical processes and their environments may produce.

One criticism of prescriptive analytics is that its distinction from [[predictive analytics]] is ill-defined and therefore ill-conceived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bill Vorhies|url=http://www.predictiveanalyticsworld.com/patimes/prescriptive-versus-predictive-analytics-distinction-without-difference/ |title=Prescriptive versus Predictive Analytics – A Distinction without a Difference?|journal=Predictive Analytics Times|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Components of Prescriptive Analytics.png|thumb|600px|The scientific disciplines that comprise Prescriptive Analytics]]

==History==

Prescriptive analytics incorporates both structured and unstructured data, and uses a combination of advanced analytic techniques and disciplines to predict, prescribe, and adapt. While the term prescriptive analytics was first coined by IBM&lt;ref name="LustigEtAl"/&gt; and later trademarked by Ayata,&lt;ref&gt;http://trademarks.justia.com/852/06/prescriptive-analytics-85206495.html&lt;/ref&gt; the underlying concepts have been around for hundreds of years. The technology behind prescriptive analytics synergistically combines hybrid [[data]], business rules with [[mathematical model]]s and [[computational model]]s. The data inputs to prescriptive analytics may come from multiple sources: internal, such as inside a corporation; and external, also known as environmental data.  The data may be structured, which includes numbers and categories, as well as [[unstructured data]], such as texts, images, sounds, and videos. Unstructured data differs from [[structured data]] in that its format varies widely and cannot be stored in traditional relational databases without significant effort at data transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Inmon|first=Bill|author2=Nesavich, Anthony|title=Tapping Into Unstructured Data|year=2007|publisher=Prentice-Hall|isbn=978-0-13-236029-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 80% of the world's data today is unstructured, according to IBM.

In addition to this variety of data types and growing data volume, incoming data can also evolve with respect to velocity, that is, more data being generated at a faster or a variable pace. Business rules define the [[business process]] and include objectives constraints, preferences, policies, best practices, and boundaries. Mathematical models and computational models are techniques derived from mathematical sciences, computer science and related disciplines such as applied statistics, machine learning, operations research, natural language processing, computer vision, pattern recognition, image processing, speech recognition, and signal processing. The correct application of all these methods and the verification of their results implies the need for resources on a massive scale including human, computational and temporal for every Prescriptive Analytic project. In order to spare the expense of dozens of people, high performance machines and weeks of work one must consider the reduction of resources and therefore a reduction in the accuracy or reliability of the outcome. The preferable route is a reduction that produces a probabilistic result within acceptable limits.

==Applications in Oil and Gas==

[[File:Key Questions Prescriptive Analytics software answers for oil and gas producers.png|thumb|right|450px|Key Questions Prescriptive Analytics software answers for oil and gas producers]]Energy is the largest industry in the world ($6 trillion in size). The processes and decisions related to oil and natural gas exploration, development and production generate large amounts of data. Many types of captured data are used to create models and images of the Earth’s structure and layers 5,000 - 35,000 feet below the surface and to describe activities around the wells themselves, such as depositional characteristics, machinery performance, oil flow rates, reservoir temperatures and pressures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Basu, Atanu|title= How Prescriptive Analytics Can Reshape Fracking in Oil and Gas Fields|journal= Data-Informed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prescriptive analytics software can help with both locating and producing hydrocarbons&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=  Basu, Atanu |title= How Data Analytics Can Help Frackers Find Oil |journal= Datanami|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
by taking in seismic data, well log data, production data, and other related data sets to prescribe specific recipes for how and where to drill, complete, and produce wells in order to optimize recovery, minimize cost, and reduce environmental footprint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Mohan, Daniel |title= Machines Prescribing Recipes from 'Things,' Earth, and People |journal =Oil &amp; Gas Investor|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unconventional Resource Development===

[[File:Varied datasets.png|thumb|right|450px|Examples of structured and unstructured data sets generated and by the oil and gas companies and their ecosystem of service providers that can be analyzed together using Prescriptive Analytics software]]With the value of the end product determined by global commodity economics, the basis of competition for operators in upstream E&amp;P is the ability to effectively deploy capital to locate and extract resources more efficiently, effectively, predictably, and safely than their peers.  In unconventional resource plays, operational efficiency and effectiveness is diminished by reservoir inconsistencies, and decision-making impaired by high degrees of uncertainty.   These challenges manifest themselves in the form of low recovery factors and wide performance variations.

Prescriptive Analytics software can accurately predict production and prescribe optimal configurations of controllable drilling, completion, and production variables by modeling numerous internal and external variables simultaneously, regardless of source, structure, size, or format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Basu, Mohan, Marshall, &amp; McColpin |title=The Journey to Designer Wells |journal=Oil &amp; Gas Investor |date=December 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prescriptive analytics software can also provide decision options and show the impact of each decision option so the operations managers can proactively take appropriate actions, on time, to guarantee future exploration and production performance, and maximize the economic value of assets at every point over the course of their serviceable lifetimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mohan, Daniel |title=Your Data Already Know What You Don't |journal=E&amp;P Magazine |date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oilfield Equipment Maintenance===

In the realm of oilfield equipment maintenance, Prescriptive Analytics can optimize configuration, anticipate and prevent unplanned downtime, optimize field scheduling, and improve maintenance planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Presley, Jennifer |title=ESP for ESPs |journal=Exploration &amp; Production |date=July 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to General Electric, there are more than 130,000 electric submersible pumps (ESP's) installed globally, accounting for 60% of the world's oil production.&lt;ref&gt;{http://www.ge-energy.com/products_and_services/products/electric_submersible_pumping_systems/}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prescriptive Analytics has been deployed to predict when and why an ESP will fail, and recommend the necessary actions to prevent the failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wheatley, Malcolm |title=Underground Analytics |journal=DataInformed |date=May 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the area of [[Health, Safety and Environment|Health, Safety, and Environment]], prescriptive analytics can predict and preempt incidents that can lead to reputational and financial loss for oil and gas companies.

===Pricing===

Pricing is another area of focus. [[Natural gas prices]] fluctuate dramatically depending upon supply, demand, [[econometrics]], [[geopolitics]], and weather conditions. Gas producers, pipeline transmission companies and [[Utility companies|utility firms]] have a keen interest in more accurately predicting gas prices so that they can lock in favorable terms while hedging downside risk. Prescriptive analytics software can accurately predict prices by modeling internal and external variables simultaneously and also provide decision options and show the impact of each decision option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Watson, Michael|title=Advanced Analytics in Supply Chain - What is it, and is it Better than Non-Advanced Analytics?|journal=Supply Chain Digest|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications in healthcare==

Multiple factors are driving [[healthcare]] providers to dramatically improve business processes and operations as the [[Health care in the United States|United States healthcare]] industry embarks on the necessary migration from a largely fee-for service, volume-based system to a fee-for-performance, value-based system. Prescriptive analytics is playing a key role to help improve the performance in a number of areas involving various stakeholders: payers, providers and pharmaceutical companies.

Prescriptive analytics can help providers improve effectiveness of their clinical care delivery to the population they manage and in the process achieve better patient satisfaction and retention.  Providers can do better population health management by identifying appropriate intervention models for risk stratified population combining data from the in-facility care episodes and home based telehealth.&lt;!-- It's unclear how the definition of prescriptive analytics provides distinguishes itself from the well established area of EBM (evidence based medicine) --&gt;

Prescriptive analytics can also benefit healthcare providers in their capacity planning by using analytics to leverage operational and usage data combined with data of external factors such as economic data, population demographic trends and population health trends, to more accurately plan for future capital investments such as new facilities and equipment utilization as well as understand the trade-offs between adding additional beds and expanding an existing facility versus building a new one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Foster, Roger|title=Big data and public health, part 2: Reducing Unwarranted Services|journal=Government Health IT|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prescriptive analytics can help pharmaceutical companies to expedite their drug development by identifying patient cohorts that are most suitable for the clinical trials worldwide - patients who are expected to be compliant and will not drop out of the trial due to complications.  Analytics can tell companies how much time and money they can save if they choose one patient cohort in a specific country vs. another.

In provider-payer negotiations, [[Health care provider|providers]] can improve their negotiating position with health insurers by developing a robust understanding of future service utilization. By accurately predicting utilization, providers can also better allocate personnel.

'''Proxemic communication''' deals with the ways that what is [[communication|communicated]] in face-to-face [[conversation]]s may go beyond the overt information being imparted. The communication may be influenced by degree of proximity and by [[nonverbal communication|non-verbal]] signals including touch, and varies between different cultures. Research in this field has been carried out on [[cross-cultural communication|cross-cultural differences]], and on interaction in [[counseling]] and [[clinical medicine|clinical]] settings.

==The field of proxemics==
[[Proxemics]] is one of several subcategories of the study of [[nonverbal communication]].&lt;ref name="nina moore"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Nina|title=Nonverbal Communication:Studies and Applications|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proxemics can be defined as "the interrelated observations and theories of man's use of space as a specialized elaboration of culture".&lt;ref name="Hidden Dimension"&gt;{{cite book| last = Hall| first = Edward T.| title = The Hidden Dimension| year = 1966| publisher = Anchor Books| isbn = 0-385-08476-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term was coined in 1963 by the cultural anthropologist [[Edward T. Hall]].&lt;ref name="Hall2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hall|first=Edward T.|title=A System for the Notation of Proxemic Behavior|journal=American Anthropologist|date=October 1963|volume=65|issue=5|pages=1003–1026|doi=10.1525/aa.1963.65.5.02a00020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his work on proxemics, Hall separated his theory into two overarching categories: [[personal space]] and [[territory (animal)|territory]]. ''Personal space'' describes the immediate space surrounding a person, while ''territory'' refers to the area which a person may "lay claim to" and defend against others.&lt;ref name="nina moore" /&gt;

==Dimensions of nonverbal communication==
According to Xu Lin’s article on Cultural Dimensions and Conversational Strategies, "Cultural factors have a great impact on conversational techniques",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Xu|first=L.|title=Cultural Dimensions and Conversational Strategies --Conversational Strategies Adopted in Different Cultures and the Way to Bridge the Gap.|year=2007|publisher=US-China Foreign Language|pages=71–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there are two basic elements consisted in all [[conversations]]: ''informational'' and ''communicative''. The informational function deals with passing information to another individual; this is known as the information focused element. Whereas, the communicative function deals with the social principle or aim in the conversation, also known as the element that deals with social relationships and drawing closer to people. Xu Lin studies the different classifications of nonverbal communication brought forth by Edward T. Hall (1959).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hall|first=E.|title=The Silent Language|year=1959|publisher=Doubleday|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The different dimensions brought forth by Xu Lin and Prabhu&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Prabhu|first=T.T.|title=Proxemics: Some Challenges and Strategies in Nonverbal Communication.|year=2010}}Prabhu&lt;/ref&gt; include: Intimate, Personal, Social and Public Distances.

==Common methods==
One of the primary methods used among Kim, D., Pan, Y., &amp; Park, H. (1998),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kim|first=D.|title=High- versus low-context culture: A comparison of Chinese, Korean, and American cultures|newspaper=Psychology &amp; Marketing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merkin, R. S. (2006), Albas, C. (1991) and Graves, J. R., &amp; Robinson, J. D. included [[Likert scale|Likert]]-type measures of sampling. Participants would be given surveys, videotaped and observed while receiving responding to oral questions posed by formally dressed interviewers. Each study consisted of a controlled group and an experimental group and would measure each individual in a specific manner in order to bring forth accurate results. Each method included a sampling base of volunteers with cheap compensation such as a two dollar reward or extra credit in the class taking part in the experiment.

DiBiase{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} describes touch as differentiating depending on various aspects. All people touch and are touched by others, but there are vast differences in the amount of touching that people do. For example, touching appears to vary by gender, culture, and even age. Although these particular differences in touching behavior are not well understood, historically investigators have thought of touch as expressing control and dominance.

Not only does touch vary by culture, but also age and gender. They continue to explain how some researchers have suggested that some cultures, such as Middle Eastern, Latin America and Southern Europe, could be considered high-contact cultures (interact at closer distances and touch more frequently) much more in social conversations than people from non-contact cultures such as the USA and Northern Europe.

Research by Graves (1976),&lt;ref name="Graves1976"&gt;{{cite news|last=Graves|first=J.D.|title=Proxemic behavior as a function of inconsistent verbal and nonverbal messages|newspaper=Journal of Counseling Psychology|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Robinson (1976),&lt;ref name="Graves1976" /&gt; suggests that an individual's nonverbal behavior is capable of communicating information about the particular individual's feelings and attitudes, regardless of the culture. However, from his research he concluded that the prominent role was in fact played by nonverbal communication in determining the total meaning of the message, and that the message being conveyed could very well differ depending on the context. Among his findings was that within the client-counselor relationship, the consistency or inconsistency between the counselor's verbal and [[Nonverbal communication|nonverbal behaviors]] has been found to be an important determinant of the client's impressions of the counselor as well as of the client's proxemics behavior.

Albas (1991)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Albas|first=C.|title=Proxemic Behavior: A Study of Extrusion|newspaper=Journal of Social Psychology|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; studied the comfortable proxemic distances assumed by Canadian female students. The cultural group and sex was held constant; however, the comfortable distances seemed to vary from situation to situation. Preston (2005)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Preston|first=P.|title=Proxemics in Clinical and Administrative Settings|newspaper=Journal of Healthcare Management|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; discusses the proxemics in clinical and administrative settings. He came to the conclusion that the proximity of people to one another when they interact and the configuration of work areas send a message that affects people in different ways. One of his main suggestions was to use observation skills in understanding how and why others interact within or outside their own space. He claims that people choose to rely on their imagination to better receive unspoken messages sent by others through their spatial interactions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12555">'''Quantitative storytelling''' ('''QST''') is a systematic approach to explore the multiplicity of frames potentially legitimate in a scientific study or controversy.&lt;ref name="QST1"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.futures.2016.11.012 |title=What is wrong with evidence based policy, and how can it be improved? |journal=Futures |volume=91 |pages=62–71 |year=2017 |last1=Saltelli |first1=Andrea |last2=Giampietro |first2=Mario }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Giampietro2014"&gt;[Giampietro, M., Aspinall, R. J., Ramos-Martin, J. and Bukkens, S. G. F. (2014) Resource Accounting for Sustainability Assessment: The Nexus between Energy, Food, Water and Land Use. Taylor &amp; Francis (Routledge Explorations in Sustainability and Governance).](https://books.google.es/books?id=Vb6uAwAAQBAJ)&lt;/ref&gt; QST assumes that in an interconnected society more frameworks and worldviews are legitimately upheld by different constituencies and social actors. QST looks critically to models used in evidence-based policy (EBP). These are often in the form of risk analyses or cost benefit analyses, and necessarily focus on a single framing of the issue under consideration. QST suggest corrective approaches to this practice.  

==Context==
Quantitative storytelling (QST) addresses evidence based policy and can be considered as a reaction to a style of quantification based on cost benefir or risk analysis which - in the opinion of QST proponents - may contain important implicit normative assumptions.&lt;ref name="QST1" /&gt;

In the logic of QST, a single quantification corresponding to a single view of what the problem is runs the risk of distracting from what could be alternative readings.&lt;ref name="QST1" /&gt;

Alternative frames (Ravetz, 1987&lt;ref name="Ravetz1997"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/107554708700900104 |title=Usable Knowledge, Usable Ignorance |journal=Knowledge |volume=9 |pages=87–116 |year=2016 |last1=Ravetz |first1=Jerome R }}&lt;/ref&gt; ; Rayner, 2012&lt;ref name="Rayner2012"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/03085147.2011.637335 |title=Uncomfortable knowledge: The social construction of ignorance in science and environmental policy discourses |journal=Economy and Society |volume=41 |pages=107–25 |year=2012 |last1=Rayner |first1=Steve }}&lt;/ref&gt;) may represent ‘uncomfortable knowledge’, which is removed from the policy discourse. Thus, extensive mathematical modelling in EBP to support a given policy may lead to a simplification of the available perceptions and generate - rather than resolve – controversies. The word ‘hypo-cognition’ has been used in the context of these instrumental use of frames (Lakoff et al., 2008&lt;ref name="Lakoff2008"&gt;[Lakoff, G., Dean, H. and Hazen, D. (2008) Don’t Think of an Elephant!: Know Your Values and Frame the Debate. Chelsea Green Publishing.](https://books.google.es/books?id=zbJ1oxHC9a0C)
&lt;/ref&gt;; Lakoff, 2010&lt;ref name="Lakoff2010"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/17524030903529749 |title=Why it Matters How We Frame the Environment |journal=Environmental Communication |volume=4 |pages=70–81 |year=2010 |last1=Lakoff |first1=George }}&lt;/ref&gt;). 

Under this critical viewpoint, mathematical models can be seen as a tool for ‘displacement’. Displacement occurs where a model becomes the end instead of the tool, e.g. when an institution chooses to monitor and manage the outcome of a model rather than what happens in reality&lt;ref name="Rayner2012" /&gt;. Once exposed, the strategic use of hypo-cognition erodes the trust in the involved actors and institutions.&lt;ref name="Rayner2012" /&gt;

==Approach==
QST suggests acknowledging ignorance, as to work out ‘clumsy solutions’ (Rayner, 2012&lt;ref name="Rayner2012" /&gt;), which may accommodate unshared epistemological or ethical principles. This is in turn close to the [[Post-normal science|PNS]] suggested style of inquiry known as ‘working deliberatively within imperfections’ (van der Sluijs and Petersen, 2008&lt;ref name="Sluijs2012"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1088/1748-9326/3/2/024008 |title=Exploring the quality of evidence for complex and contested policy decisions |journal=Environmental Research Letters |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=024008 |year=2008 |last1=Van Der Sluijs |first1=Jeroen P |last2=Petersen |first2=Arthur C |last3=Janssen |first3=Peter H M |last4=Risbey |first4=James S |last5=Ravetz |first5=Jerome R }}&lt;/ref&gt;), and to the exigence for a ‘rediscovery of ignorance’ (see preface to Pereira and Funtowicz, 2015&lt;ref name="Pereira2012"&gt;[Pereira, A. G. and Funtowicz, S. (2015) Science, Philosophy and Sustainability : the End of the Cartesian dream.{{pn|date=April 2018}}](https://www.crcpress.com/Science-Philosophy-and-Sustainability-The-End-of-the-Cartesian-dream/Pereira-Funtowicz/p/book/9781138796409)&lt;/ref&gt;).
QST also calls attention to the power relationships at play in the use of evidence. Saltelli and Giampietro (2017)&lt;ref name="QST1" /&gt; suggest that our present approach to evidence-based policy, even in the more nuanced formulation of evidence-informed policy (Gluckman, 2014&lt;ref name="Gluckman2014"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/507163a |pmid=24627919 |title=Policy: The art of science advice to government |journal=Nature |volume=507 |issue=7491 |pages=163–5 |year=2014 |last1=Gluckman |first1=Peter }}&lt;/ref&gt;)– needs our urgent attention. Unavoidable asymmetries are generated by the fact that stronger players have access to better evidence, and can use it strategically (Boden and Epstein, 2006&lt;ref name="Boden2006"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/14767720600752619 |title=Managing the research imagination? Globalisation and research in higher education |journal=Globalisation, Societies and Education |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=223–36 |year=2006 |last1=Boden |first1=Rebecca |last2=Epstein |first2=Debbie }}&lt;/ref&gt;; Strassheim and Kettunen, 2014&lt;ref name="Strassheim2014"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1332/174426514X13990433991320 |title=When does evidence-based policy turn into policy-based evidence? Configurations, contexts and mechanisms |journal=Evidence &amp; Policy: A Journal of Research, Debate and Practice |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=259–77 |year=2014 |last1=Strassheim |first1=Holger |last2=Kettunen |first2=Pekka }}&lt;/ref&gt;).  The decline of pollinators challenge (Insectageddon, Mombiot, 2017&lt;ref name="Monbiot2017"&gt;[Monbiot G., 2017. Insectageddon: farming is more catastrophic than climate breakdown, The Guardian, October 20, 2017]( https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/20/insectageddon-farming-catastrophe-climate-breakdown-insect-populations)&lt;/ref&gt;) show that interest groups have more scope to capture regulators than the average citizen ad consumer.

QST encourages an effort in the pre-analytic, pre-quantitative phase of the analysis to map a socially robust (i.e. inclusive of the interest of different stakeholders) universe of possible frames. QST expands on one of the rules [[sensitivity auditing]] by asking the question of ‘what to do’ in order to avoid that an issue is framed unilaterally. Obviously, the medicine for a diseased evidence-based policy is not a prejudice - or superstition-based policy, but a more democratic and dialogic access to the provision of evidence – even in terms of agenda setting. For this a new institutional setting is needed&lt;ref name="QST1" /&gt;. 

QST does not eschew the use quantitative tools altogether. It suggests instead to explore quantitatively multiple narratives, avoiding spurious accuracy and focusing on some salient features of the selected stories. Rather than attempting to amass evidence in support to a given reading or policy, or to optimise it with modelling, QST operates ‘via negativa’, i.e. it tries to test whether the said framing runs afoul of a quantitative or qualitative analytical check. Here QST borrows from system ecology and attempts to refute the frames if these violate constraints of (Giampietro et al., 2014&lt;ref name="Giampietro2014" /&gt;): 

# feasibility (can we afford a given policy in terms of external constraints, e.g. existing biophysical resources?), 
# viability (can we afford it in the context of our internal constraints, governance, socioeconomic and technological arrangements?), and 
# desirability (will the relevant constituency accept it?).

==Applications==
Perhaps the best application of the concept of QST is an old study of GMO-related perceptions (Marris, 2001&lt;ref name="Marris2001"&gt;[Marris, C. (2001) Final Report of the PABE research project funded by the Commission of European Communities.]( http://csec.lancs.ac.uk/archive/pabe/docs/pabe_finalreport.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;) which has lost very little of its actuality since the ongoing GMO and pesticide debate. 
By direct interview and measurements of stakeholders’ expectation and worldviews, Marris and co-authors showed that the prevailing narrative of the reaction to GMO as a ‘food scare’ – i.e. as an issue of safety to consume GMO food – did not show up among the concerns raised by the interviewed citizens, which worried instead about who would benefit from these technologies, why were they introduced in the first place, and whether existing regulatory authorities would be up to the task of resisting regulatory capture from powerful industrial incumbents.

Other applications of approaches which can be referred to QST are to the analyses for the cost of climate change,&lt;ref name="Saltelli-d’Hombres2011"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2009.12.003 |title=Sensitivity analysis didn't help.

A '''raceme''' ({{IPAc-en|r|eɪ|ˈ|s|iː|m}} or {{IPAc-en|r|ə|ˈ|s|iː|m}}) is an unbranched, [[indeterminate growth|indeterminate]] type of [[inflorescence]] bearing ''pedicellate'' [[flower]]s (flowers having short floral stalks called [[Pedicel (botany)|pedicels]]) along its axis.&lt;ref name=walters1996&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walters|first1=Dirk R. |last2=Keil|first2=David J. |title=Vascular Plant Taxonomy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZbaNxSnNoecC&amp;pg=PA602|edition=4th|date=1 January 1996|publisher=Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company|location=United States|isbn=978-0-7872-2108-9|page=602}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[botany]], an ''axis'' means a shoot, in this case one bearing the flowers. In indeterminate inflorescence-like racemes, the oldest flowers are borne towards the base and new flowers are produced as the shoot grows, with no predetermined growth limit.&lt;ref name="Wofford1989"/&gt; A plant that flowers on a showy raceme may have this reflected in its scientific name, e.g. ''[[Cimicifuga racemosa]]''. A compound raceme, also called a '''[[panicle]]''', has a branching main axis.&lt;ref name="KumarBhatia"/&gt; Examples of racemes occur on mustard (genus ''[[Brassica]]'') and radish (genus ''[[Raphanus]]'') plants.&lt;ref name="KumarBhatia"/&gt;

==Spike==
A spike is an unbranched, indeterminate inflorescence, similar to a raceme, but bearing sessile flowers (sessile flowers are attached directly, without stalks).&lt;ref name="Wofford1989"/&gt; Examples occur on Malabar nut (''[[Justicia adhatoda]]'') and chaff flowers (genus ''[[Achyranthes]]'').&lt;ref name="KumarBhatia"/&gt; A '''[[spikelet]]''' can refer to a small ''spike'', although it is primarily used to refer to the ultimate flower cluster unit in grasses ([[Poaceae|family Poaceae]]) and sedges (family [[Cyperaceae]]),&lt;ref name="Wofford1989"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wofford|first=B. Eugene |title=Guide to the Vascular Plants of the Blue Ridge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mNeNUQkIrqQC&amp;pg=PA12|year=1989|publisher=University of Georgia Press|isbn=978-0-8203-2455-5|pages=10–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which case the stalk supporting the cluster becomes the ''pedicel''. A true spikelet comprises one or more florets enclosed by two [[glume]]s (sterile [[bract]]s), with flowers and glumes arranged in two opposite rows along the spikelet.&lt;ref name="KumarBhatia"/&gt; Examples occur on rice (species ''[[Oryza sativa]]'') and wheat (genus ''[[wheat|Triticum]]''), both grasses.&lt;ref name="KumarBhatia"/&gt;

==Catkin==
A [[catkin|ament or catkin]] is very similar to a spike or raceme, "but with subtending bracts so conspicuous as to conceal the flowers until pollination, as in the [[Pussy willow|pussy–willow]], [[alder]], [and] [[birch]]...".&lt;ref name="GilmanPeck1907"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Gilman, Daniel Coit.|others=Peck, Harry Thurston; Colby, Frank Moore|title=The new international encyclopædia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pppGAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA618|volume=10|year=1907|publisher=Dodd, Mead and Company|location=New York|page=618}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are sometimes called amentaceous plants.&lt;ref name="GilmanPeck1907"/&gt;

==Spadix==
A [[spadix (botany)|spadix]] is a form of spike in which the florets are densely crowded along a fleshy axis, and enclosed by one or more large, brightly–colored [[bract]]s called [[spathe]]s.&lt;ref name="KumarBhatia"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kumar|first1=Vinay|last2=Bhatia|first2=S. S.|title=Complete Biology for Medical College Entrance Examination|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kTdVAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA218|edition=3rd|series=McGraw Hill Education Series|year=2013|publisher=McGraw Hill Education (India) Private Limited|isbn=978-1-259-06430-2|page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually the female flowers grow at the base, and male flowers grow above.&lt;ref name="KumarBhatia"/&gt; They are a characteristic of the [[Araceae]] family, for example jack–in–the–pulpit (species ''[[Arisaema triphyllum]]'') and wild calla (genus [[Calla]]).&lt;ref name="GilmanPeck1907"/&gt;

==Examples==

Image:Pycreus.jpg|Every radiating unit in this inflorescence of a ''[[Cyperus]]'' sedge is a '''spikelet''' composed of small flowers (florets) arranged in two ranks
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Derivation==
From classical Latin ''racemus'', cluster of grapes.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary. Raceme 2. Bot. A type of inflorescence in which the flowers are arranged on short, nearly equal, lateral pedicels, at equal distances along a single elongated axis&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Baltimore]]-based '''Research Institute for Advanced Studies (RIAS)''', not to be confused with the better-known [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in Princeton, New Jersey, was among the several centers for research in the mathematical and physical sciences established throughout the United States after World War II, in recognition of the critical role that fundamental scientific research played in the outcome of that war. Although not as well known as other similar institutes, such as the IAS mentioned above, or the [[RAND Corporation]], it nevertheless made significant contributions to the sciences of systems and control theory, and various branches of mathematics, during its 18-year existence.&lt;ref&gt;Talbert, E, Conquest of Gravity Aim of Top Scientists in U.S., ''New York Harold Tribune'', (November 20, 1955), pp. 1, 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Research Institute for Advanced Studies (sometimes referred to in the singular) was founded in 1955 by George Bunker of the [[Glenn L. Martin Company]], the ancestor of the aerospace giant [[Lockheed Martin]]. Its founding was the idea of George Bunker, who took over from Glenn Martin as chairman of that company in 1952. Like the leaders of other aircraft companies in the United States, Bunker recognized that the future of aviation lay in applying new ideas of fundamental research in mathematics, electronics, and physics that had been developed during World War II. Bunker established the Institute in [[Baltimore]], Maryland, specifically chartered to support fundamental research. The RIAS's first Director was Welcome W. Bender.&lt;ref name=Harwood&gt;William B. Harwood, ''Raise Heaven and Earth: The Story of Martin-Marietta People and Their Pioneering Achievements'', (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1993), pp. 283-284.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute distinguished itself as one of the world's leading centers of mathematical research, especially in [[Control theory|control]] and [[systems theory]]. Among the mathematicians on its staff were [[Solomon Lefschetz]] and [[Rudolf E. Kálmán]] (who while at the Institute in 1960 published a famous paper that was the basis for the "[[Kalman Filter]]," a technique for extracting information from a noisy channel that finds applications in many facets of modern life), as well as [[Joseph P. LaSalle]] (who in 1960 published a paper describing [[LaSalle's invariance principle]]), [[Jack K. Hale]], [[Harold J. Kushner]] and others. While at RIAS in the early 1960s, [[Rod Driver|Rodney Driver]] undertook research on [[delay differential equation]]s and their applications.

The RIAS changed its name and turned its mission away from basic research in 1973, after the merger that produced the [[Martin Marietta]] Corporation.&lt;ref name=Harwood /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Martin Marietta Corporation Site|url=http://www.mde.state.md.us/assets/document/brownfields/Martin_Marietta_corp.pdf|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Last Mixed Tape''''' is an Irish based daily [[music blog]] founded in February 2014 by critic and journalist Stephen White. The site is composed of reviews, interviews, and news features all written by White, specifically about the Dublin music scene. Although the site is listed as a blog, White has on several occasions distanced himself from the term, preferring to be called a "critic".

The website promotes and critiques the artists coming out of Ireland's independent scene, spanning several genres including [[Indie Music|indie]], [[Electronic music|electronic]], [[post punk]], [[noise pop]] and [[alternative rock]].

Although White champions Irish indie music, he has been known to be harder on pop acts coming out of the country resulting in a controversial rant about Irish act [[Kodaline]] in which he likened them to "vanilla ice-cream".&lt;ref name="kodaline"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.podcastchart.com/podcasts/the-last-mixed-tape/episodes/the-last-mixed-tape-podcast-episode-two |title=  The Last Mixed Tape Podcast Episode Two | publisher= podccastchart.com |accessdate= 2015-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also expressed his dislike of [[Hozier (musician)|Hozier]] and referred to his debut album as "uncontrollably melodramatic",&lt;ref name=podcast /&gt; a view not shared by his peers. This has continued to earn the Last Mixed Tape a controversial reputation within the Irish music scene with White's reviews of [[The Coronas]] album 'Trust The Wire' and [[The Strypes]] album 'Spitting Image' being seen as unfair.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thelastmixedtape.com/2017/06/17/review-the-strypes-spitting-image/|title=Review {{!}} The Strypes – Spitting Image|date=2017-06-17|website=The Last Mixed Tape|access-date=2017-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The Last Mixed Tape continued to earn a negative reputation following a review of [[The Script|the Script’]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s [[Freedom Child]] album, which was described as “toxic” and left “a bad taste”.

==Awards and nominations==
Since its first year ''the Last Mixed Tape'' was nominated for six music blogging awards, the Blog Awards Ireland in 2014, 2015 &amp; 2016&lt;ref name="blogawards"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.blogawardsireland.com/best-music-blog-finalists-2014/ |title=  Blog Awards Best Music Blog 2014 Finalists | publisher= blogawardsireland.com |accessdate= 2015-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the Web Awards Ireland in 2014, 2015 &amp; 2016, losing out on all occasions.&lt;ref name="webawards"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webawards.ie/2014-finalists/ |title=  Web Awards 2014 Finalists | publisher= webawards.ie |accessdate= 2015-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances and events==
''The Last Mixed Tape'' has also taken part in several events and charity shows around Dublin. Stephen White has appeared on several panel discussions representing the blog, including multiple appearances at ''Vinyl &amp; Wine''&lt;ref name="festivalgigguide"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.festivalandgigguide.ie/index.php/blog/gallery/3462-classic-vinyl-sunday-the-velvet-underground-nico-twisted-pepper-sunday-25th-january |title=  CLASSIC VINYL SUNDAY THE VELVET UNDERGROUND &amp; NICO@TWISTED PEPPER SUNDAY 25TH JANUARY | publisher= festivalandgigguide.ie |last= Viansino|first=Elena|accessdate= 2015-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and an appearance at the ''State.ie of the Nation Address''.&lt;ref name="state.ie"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://state.ie/features/getting-heard |title=  Getting Heard…can Irish music reach the masses? | publisher= [[State (magazine)|state.ie]] |last= Phil |first= Udell|accessdate= 2015-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015 Stephen appeared as part of a discussion panel at Life Festival, speaking about [[Nas]] and his debut album ''[[Illmatic]]''.&lt;ref name="lifefestival.com"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.life-festival.com/hunt.php |title=  Hunt &amp; Gather Creations Tent | publisher= life-festival.com | accessdate= 2015-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; White also guested as a host on weekly radio show ''the Co-Present'' alongside [[Fight Like Apes]] singer MayKay.

In September 2014 White along with several promoters from the Dublin area ran a charity night for the [[Irish Red Cross]] to raise funds for their appeal to help victims of the [[2014 Israel–Gaza conflict|2014 Israel-Gaza conflict]]. The night was headlined by local rock 'n' roll band [[the Minutes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.hotpress.com/news/The-Minutes-to-headline-upcoming-Gig-for-Gaza/12145046.html|title=The Minutes to headline upcoming Gig for Gaza|publisher=[[Hot Press (magazine)|hot press]]|date=2014-09-22|accessdate=2014-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2015, the Last Mixed Tape took part in an event at [[Whelan's (music venue)]] to raise funds for the Yes Equality campaign during the [[Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution (Marriage Equality) Bill 2015]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.hotpress.com/Delorentos/news/Whelans-says-YES-set-for-next-Friday/13990876.html|title=Whelan's says YES set for next Friday |publisher=[[Hot Press (magazine)|hot press]]|accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by another charity gig in September 2015 in aid of Irish Red Cross Migration appeal during the [[European migrant crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://nialler9.com/a-gig-this-friday-for-the-refugee-crisis-featuring-le-galaxie-kormac-buffalo-woman-mother-djs-more/|title= A gig this Friday for the Refugee Crisis featuring Le Galaxie, Kormac, Buffalo Woman, Mother DJ's and more |publisher= Nialler9 |accessdate=2015-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Podcast==
In 2015 ''the Last Mixed Tape'' began a weekly music review [[podcast]].&lt;ref name="podcast"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://itunes.apple.com/ie/podcast/the-last-mixed-tape/id967232402 |title=  itunes podcasts | publisher= iTunes |accessdate= 2015-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The show is uploaded every Friday morning and features White reviewing Irish indie albums and singles and is hosted by local Irish DJ Kate Brennan-Harding who is a producer for the Irish national and independent radio station, Today FM.

== Miller's article ==
In his article, Miller discussed a coincidence between the limits of one-dimensional absolute judgment and the limits of short-term memory. In a one-dimensional absolute-judgment task, a person is presented with a number of stimuli that vary on one dimension (e.g., 10 different tones varying only in pitch) and responds to each stimulus with a corresponding response (learned before). Performance is nearly perfect up to five or six different stimuli but declines as the number of different stimuli is increased. The task can be described as one of information transmission: The input consists of one out of ''n'' possible stimuli, and the output consists of one out of ''n'' responses. The information contained in the input can be determined by the number of binary decisions that need to be made to arrive at the selected stimulus, and the same holds for the response. Therefore, people's maximum performance on one-dimensional absolute judgement can be characterized as an information channel capacity with approximately 2 to 3 [[bit]]s of [[information]], which corresponds to the ability to distinguish between four and eight alternatives.

The second cognitive limitation Miller discusses is [[memory span]]. Memory span refers to the longest list of items (e.g., digits, letters, words) that a person can repeat back  in correct order on 50% of trials immediately after presentation. Miller observed that memory span of young adults is approximately seven items. He noticed that memory span is approximately the same for stimuli with vastly different amount of information—for instance, binary digits have 1 bit each; decimal digits have 3.32 bits each; words have about 10 bits each. Miller concluded that memory span is not limited in terms of bits but rather in terms of [[Chunking (psychology)|chunks]]. A chunk is the largest meaningful unit in the presented material that the person recognizes—thus, what counts as a chunk depends on the knowledge of the person being tested. For instance, a word is a single chunk for a speaker of the language but is many chunks for someone who is totally unfamiliar with the language and sees the word as a collection of phonetic segments.

Miller recognized that the correspondence between the limits of one-dimensional absolute judgment and of short-term memory span was only a coincidence, because only the first limit, not the second, can be characterized in information-theoretic terms (i.e., as a roughly constant number of bits). Therefore, there is nothing "magical" about the number seven, and Miller used the expression only rhetorically. Nevertheless, the idea of a "magical number 7" inspired much theorizing, rigorous and less rigorous, about the capacity limits of human cognition. The number seven constitutes a useful heuristic, reminding us that lists that are much longer than that become significantly harder to remember and process simultaneously.

== The "magical number 7" and working memory capacity ==
{{see also|Working memory#Capacity}}

Later research on [[short-term memory]] and [[working memory]] revealed that memory span is not a constant even when measured in a number of chunks. The number of chunks a human can recall immediately after presentation depends on the category of chunks used (e.g., span is around seven for digits, around six for letters, and around five for words), and even on features of the [[Chunking (psychology)|chunks]] within a category. Chunking is used by the brain’s short-term memory as a method for keeping groups of information accessible for easy recall.  It functions and works best as labels that one is already familiar with—the incorporation of new information into a label that is already well rehearsed into one’s long-term memory.  These chunks must store the information in such a way that they can be disassembled into the necessary data.&lt;ref name=Richard&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shiffrin|first=Richard|author2=Robert Nosofsky |title=Seven plus or minus two: A commentary on capacity limitations.|journal=Psychological Review|date=April 1994|volume=101|series=2|issue=Centennial|pages=357–361|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.101.2.357|url=http://0-web.ebscohost.com.catalog.georgefox.edu/ehost/detail?sid=851ab677-e748-469e-baa9-15bc54361042%40sessionmgr111&amp;vid=8&amp;hid=107&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#db=psyh&amp;AN=1994-28302-001|accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The storage capacity is dependent on the information being stored. For instance, span is lower for long words than it is for short words. In general, memory span for verbal contents (digits, letters, words, etc.) strongly depends on the time it takes to speak the contents aloud. Some researchers have therefore proposed that the limited capacity of short-term memory for verbal material is not a "magic number" but rather a "magic spell".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=419–25 |doi=10.1037/0278-7393.12.3.419 |title=Short-term memory capacity: Magic number or magic spell? |year=1986 |last1=Schweickert |first1=Richard |last2=Boruff |first2=Brian |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition |volume=12 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alan Baddeley|Baddeley]] used this finding to postulate that one component of his model of [[working memory]], the [[phonological loop]], is capable of holding around 2 seconds of sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=556–9 |doi=10.1126/science.1736359 |title=Working memory |year=1992 |last1=Baddeley |first1=A |journal=Science |volume=255 |issue=5044 |pmid=1736359}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=417–23 |doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(00)01538-2 |title=The episodic buffer: a new component of working memory? |year=2000 |last1=Baddeley |first1=Alan |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |volume=4 |issue=11 |pmid=11058819}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the limit of short-term memory cannot easily be characterized as a constant "magic spell" either, because memory span also depends on other factors besides speaking duration. For instance, span depends on the lexical status of the contents (i.e., whether the contents are words known to the person or not).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=527–36 |doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1995.tb02570.x |title=The role of long-term memory mechanisms in memory span |year=1995 |last1=Hulme |first1=Charles |last2=Roodenrys |first2=Steven |last3=Brown |first3=Gordon |last4=Mercer |first4=Robin |journal=British Journal of Psychology |volume=86 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other factors also affect a person's measured span, and therefore it is difficult to pin down the capacity of short-term or working memory to a number of chunks. Nonetheless, Cowan has proposed that working memory has a capacity of about four chunks in young adults (and less in children and older adults).&lt;ref name=pmid11515286&gt;{{cite journal |pages=87–114; discussion 114–85 |doi=10.1017/S0140525X01003922 |title=The magical number 4 in short-term memory: A reconsideration of mental storage capacity |year=2001 |last1=Cowan |first1=Nelson |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=24 |pmid=11515286 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tarnow finds that in a classic experiment typically argued as supporting a 4 item buffer by Murdock, there is in fact no evidence for such and thus the "magical number", at least in the Murdock experiment, is 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11571-010-9108-y |title=There is no capacity limited buffer in the Murdock (1962) free recall data |year=2010 |last1=Tarnow |first1=Eugen |journal=Cognitive Neurodynamics |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=395–7 |pmc=2974097 |pmid=22132047}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murdock|first=Bennett B.|title=The serial position effect of free recall|journal=View Table of Contents and Online First Publication Journal of Experimental Psychology|date=1962|volume=64|issue=5|pages=482–8|doi=10.1037/h0045106}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other prominent theories of short-term memory capacity argue against measuring capacity in terms of a fixed number of elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bays | first1 = P. M. | last2 = Husain | first2 = M. | year = 2008 | title = Dynamic shifts of limited working memory resources in human vision | journal = Science | volume = 321 | issue = | pages = 851–854 | doi=10.1126/science.1158023| pmc = 2532743 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ma | first1 = W.

== Other cognitive numeric limits ==

Cowan also noted a number of other limits of cognition that point to a "magical number four",&lt;ref name=pmid11515286/&gt; and different from Miller, he argued that this correspondence is no coincidence. One other process that seems to be limited at about four elements is [[subitizing]], the rapid enumeration of small numbers of objects. When a number of objects are flashed briefly, their number can be determined very quickly, at a glance, when the number does not exceed the subitizing limit, which is about four objects. Larger numbers of objects must be counted, which is a slower process. The film ''[[Rain Man]]'' portrayed an [[autistic savant]], who was able to rapidly determine the number of toothpicks from an entire box spilled on the floor, apparently subitizing a much larger number than four objects. A similar feat was informally observed by [[neuropsychology|neuropsychologist]] [[Oliver Sacks]] and reported in his book ''[[The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat]]''. Therefore, one might suppose that this limit is an arbitrary limit imposed by our [[cognition]] rather than necessarily being a physical limit. (On the other hand, autism expert [[Daniel Tammet]] has suggested that the children Sacks observed may have pre-counted the matches in the box.&lt;ref name=Wilson2009&gt;{{cite news |last = Wilson |first=Peter |title=A savvy savant finds his voice |url= http://www.theaustralian.com.au/archive/news/a-savvy-savant-finds-his-voice/story-e6frg6to-1111118714550?nk=781e9e780fc341cb063ad51ada701fbe |date=31 January 2009 |work=www.theaustralian.news.com.au |publisher= [[The Australian]] |accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;) There is also evidence that even four chunks is a high estimate: Gobet and Clarkson conducted an experiment and found that over half of the memory recall conditions yielded only about two chunks.  Research also shows that the size, rather than the number, of chunks that are stored in short-term memory is what allows for enhanced memory in individuals.&lt;ref name=Fernand&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gobet|first=Fernand|author2=Gary Clarkson |title=Chunks in memory: Evidence for the magical number four . . . or is it two?|journal=Memory|date=November 2004|volume=12|issue=6|pages=732–747|doi=10.1080/09658210344000530}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Original research inline|date=March 2009}}

'''The Proteolysis MAP''' ('''PMAP''') is an integrated [[web resource]] focused on [[protease]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Igarashi | first1 = Y | last2 = Heureux | first2 = E | last3 = Doctor | first3 = KS | last4 = Talwar | first4 = P | last5 = Gramatikova | first5 = S | last6 = Gramatikoff | first6 = K | last7 = Zhang | first7 = Y | last8 = Blinov | first8 = M | last9 = Ibragimova | first9 = SS | last10 = Boyd | first10 = S | last11 = Ratnikov | first11 = B | last12 = Cieplak | first12 = P | last13 = Godzik | first13 = A | last14 = Smith | first14 = JW | last15 = Osterman | first15 = AL | last16 = Eroshkin | first16 = AM | year = 2008 | title = PMAP: databases for analyzing proteolytic events and pathways | journal = [[Nucleic Acids Research]] | volume = 37| issue = | pages = D611–D618| doi=10.1093/nar/gkn683 | pmid=18842634 | pmc=2686432}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale==
PMAP is to aid the protease researchers in reasoning about [[proteolytic]] [[metabolic network|networks]] and [[metabolic pathways]].

==History and funding==
PMAP was originally created at the [[Burnham Institute for Medical Research]], La Jolla, California.  In 2004 the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) selected a team led by [[Jeffrey W. Smith]], to establish the Center on Proteolytic Pathways (CPP).  As part of the NIH Roadmap for Biomedical research, the center develops technology to study the behavior of proteins and to disburse that knowledge to the scientific community at large.

==Focal point==
Proteases are a class of [[enzymes]] that regulate much of what happens in the [[human body]], both inside the [[Cell (biology)|cell]] and out, by cleaving [[peptide bonds]] in [[proteins]].  Through this activity, they govern the four essential cell functions: [[differentiation (cellular)|differentiation]], [[motility]], division and [[cell death]] — and activate important [[extracellular]] episodes, such as the [[biochemical cascade]] effect in [[blood clotting]].  Simply stated, life could not exist without them. Extensive on-line classification system for proteases (also referred as peptidases) is deposited in the [[MEROPS]] database.

==The goal==
Proteolytic pathways, or proteolysis, are the series of events controlled by proteases that occur in response to specific stimuli.  In addition to the clotting of blood, the production of [[insulin]] can be viewed as a proteolytic pathway, as the activation, regulation and inhibition of that protein is the result of proteases reacting to changing [[glucose]] levels and triggering other proteases downstream.

==Database content==
PMAP integrates five databases.
ProteaseDB and SubstrateDB, are driven by an automated annotation pipeline that generates dynamic ‘Molecule Pages’, rich in molecular information. CutDB&lt;ref&gt;Igarashi Y, Eroshkin A, Gramatikova S, Gramatikoff K, Zhang Y, Smith JW, Osterman AL, Godzik A. CutDB: a proteolytic event database. [[Nucleic Acids Research]]. 2007 D546-9&lt;/ref&gt; has information on more than 6,600 proteolytic events, and ProfileDB is dedicated to information of the [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] recognition specificity of proteases.  PathwayDB, just begun accumulation of [[metabolic pathways]] whose function can be dynamically modeled in a rule-based manner.  Hypothetical networks are inferred by semi-automated culling from the literature.  Additionally, protease software tools are available for the analysis of individual proteases and [[proteome]]-wide data sets.

==Usage==
Popular destinations in PMAP are Protease Molecule Pages and Substrate Molecule Pages. Protease Molecule Pages show recent news in [[PubMed]] literature of the protease, known [[proteolytic events]], [[protein domain]] location and [[protein structure]] view, as well as a cross annotation in other [[bioinformatic]] databases section. Substrate Molecule Pages display protein domains and experimentally derived protease cut-sites for a given protein target of interest.

'''''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions''''' (1962; second edition 1970; third edition 1996; fourth edition 2012) is a book about the [[history of science]] by the philosopher [[Thomas S. Kuhn]]. Its publication was a landmark event in the [[History of science|history]], [[Philosophy of science|philosophy]], and [[sociology of scientific knowledge]].  Kuhn challenged the then prevailing view of progress in "[[normal science]]".  Normal [[scientific progress]] was viewed as "development-by-accumulation" of accepted facts and theories. Kuhn argued for an episodic model in which periods of such conceptual continuity in normal science were interrupted by periods of revolutionary science. The discovery of "anomalies" during revolutions in science leads to new [[paradigms]].  New paradigms then ask new questions of old data, move beyond the mere "puzzle-solving" of the previous paradigm, change the rules of the game and the "map" directing new research.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, Thomas S. The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. 3rd ed. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press, 1996. Asking new questions of old data on pages 139, 159.  Moving beyond "puzzle-solving" on pages 37, 144.  Change in rule sets on pages 40, 41, 52, 175.  Change in the direction or "map" of research on pages 109, 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, Kuhn's analysis of the [[Copernican Revolution]] emphasized that, in its beginning, it did not offer more accurate predictions of celestial events, such as planetary positions, than the [[Ptolemaic system]], but instead appealed to some practitioners based on a promise of better, simpler, solutions that might be developed at some point in the future. Kuhn called the core concepts of an ascendant revolution its "paradigms" and thereby launched this word into widespread analogical use in the second half of the 20th century. Kuhn's insistence that a [[paradigm shift]] was a mélange of sociology, enthusiasm and scientific promise, but not a logically determinate procedure, caused an uproar in reaction to his work. Kuhn addressed concerns in the 1969 postscript to the second edition. For some commentators ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'' introduced a realistic humanism into the core of science, while for others the nobility of science was tarnished by Kuhn's introduction of an irrational element into the heart of its greatest achievements.

==History==
''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'' was first published as a [[monograph]] in the ''[[International Encyclopedia of Unified Science]]'', then as a book by [[University of Chicago Press]] in 1962. In 1969, Kuhn added a postscript to the book in which he replied to critical responses to the first edition. A 50th Anniversary Edition (with an introductory essay by [[Ian Hacking]]) was published by the [[University of Chicago Press]] in April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions|last=Kuhn|first1=Thomas S.|last2=Hacking|first2=Ian|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0-226-45812-0|location=Chicago|page=iv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kuhn dated the genesis of his book to 1947, when he was a graduate student at [[Harvard University]] and had been asked to teach a science class for humanities undergraduates with a focus on historical [[case study|case studies]]. Kuhn later commented that until then, "I'd never read an old document in science." [[Aristotle]]'s ''Physics'' was astonishingly unlike [[Isaac Newton]]'s work in its concepts of matter and motion. Kuhn wrote "... as I was reading him, Aristotle appeared not only ignorant of mechanics, but a dreadfully bad physical scientist as well. About motion, in particular, his writings seemed to me full of egregious errors, both of logic and of observation." This was in an apparent contradiction with the fact that Aristotle was a brilliant mind. While perusing Aristotle's ''Physics'', Kuhn formed the view that in order to properly appreciate Aristotle's reasoning, one must be aware of the scientific conventions of the time. Kuhn concluded that Aristotle's concepts were not "bad Newton," just different.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.units.miamioh.edu/technologyandhumanities/kuhn.htm] Thomas Kuhn, "What Are Scientific Revolutions?", an excerpt from The Probablistic Revolution, Volume I: Ideas in History, eds. Lorenz Kruger, Lorraine, J. Daston, and Michael Heidelberger (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1987), pp. 7-22.&lt;/ref&gt; This insight was the foundation of ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions''.&lt;ref name=naughton2012&gt;{{Citation | last = Naughton | first = John | author-link = John Naughton | date = 18 August 2012 | title = Thomas Kuhn: the man who changed the way the world looked at science | newspaper = The Guardian | url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/aug/19/thomas-kuhn-structure-scientific-revolutions | accessdate = 24 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the publication of Kuhn’s book, a number of ideas regarding the process of scientific investigation and discovery had already been proposed. [[Ludwik Fleck]] developed the first system of the [[sociology of scientific knowledge]] in his book ''The Genesis and Development of a Scientific Fact'' (1935). He claimed that the exchange of ideas led to the establishment of a thought collective, which, when developed sufficiently, served to separate the field into esoteric (professional) and exoteric (laymen) circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Entstehung und Entwicklung einer wissenschaftlichen Tatsache. Einführung in die Lehre vom Denkstil und Denkkollektiv|last=Fleck|first=Ludwik|publisher=Schwabe und Co.|year=1935|isbn=|location=Verlagsbuchhandlung, Basel|pages=|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Genesis and development of a scientific fact|last=Fleck|first=Ludwik|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1979|isbn=|location=Chicago, IL|pages=viii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kuhn wrote the foreword to the 1979 edition of Fleck's book, noting that he read it in 1950 and was reassured that someone "saw in the history of science what I myself was finding there."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Kuhn was not confident about how his book would be received. Harvard University had denied his tenure, a few years before. However, by the mid-1980s, his book had achieved blockbuster status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kaiser|first1=David|title=In retrospect: the structure of scientific revolutions|journal=Nature|date=2012|volume=484|pages=164-166}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

One theory to which Kuhn replies directly is [[Karl Popper|Karl Popper’s]] “falsificationism,” which stresses [[falsifiability]] as the most important criterion for distinguishing between that which is scientific and that which is unscientific. Kuhn also addresses [[verificationism]], a philosophical movement that emerged in the 1920s among [[Logical positivism|logical positivists.]] The verifiability principle claims that meaningful statements must be supported by [[empirical evidence]] or logical requirements.

==Synopsis==

===Basic approach===
Kuhn's approach to the [[history of science|history]] and [[philosophy of science]] focuses on conceptual issues like the practice of [[normal science]], influence of historical events, emergence of scientific discoveries, nature of scientific revolutions and progress through [[scientific revolution]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://projektintegracija.pravo.hr/_download/repository/Kuhn_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions.pdf|title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions|last=Kuhn|first=Thomas S.|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1962|isbn=9780226458113|edition=1st|location=Chicago, IL|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; What sorts of intellectual options and strategies were available to people during a given period? What types of lexicons and terminology were known and employed during certain epochs? Stressing the importance of not attributing traditional thought to earlier investigators, Kuhn's book argues that the evolution of scientific theory does not emerge from the straightforward accumulation of facts, but rather from a set of changing intellectual circumstances and possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://projektintegracija.pravo.hr/_download/repository/Kuhn_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions.pdf|title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions|last=Kuhn|first=Thomas|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|year=1962|isbn=9780226458113|edition=1st|location=Chicago, IL|page=|pages=210|authorlink=|coauthors=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such an approach is largely commensurate with the general historical school of [[Philosophy of history#Cyclical and linear history|non-linear history]].

Kuhn did not see scientific theory as proceeding linearly from an objective,  unbiased accumulation of all available data, but rather as paradigm-driven. “The operations and measurements that a scientist undertakes in the laboratory are not ‘the given’ of experience but rather ‘the collected with diffculty.’ They are not what the scientist sees—at least not before his research is well advanced and his attention focused. Rather, they are concrete indices to the content of more elementary perceptions, and as such they are selected for the close scrutiny of normal research only because they promise opportunity for the fruitful elaboration of an accepted paradigm. Far more clearly than the immediate experience from which they in part derive, operations and measurements are paradigm-determined. Science does not deal in all possible laboratory manipulations. Instead, it selects those relevant to the juxtaposition of a paradigm with the immediate experience that that paradigm has partially determined. As a result, scientists with different paradigms engage in different concrete laboratory manipulations.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://projektintegracija.pravo.hr/_download/repository/Kuhn_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions.pdf|title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions|last=Kuhn|first=Thomas|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|year=1962|isbn=9780226458113|edition=1st|location=Chicago, IL|page=|pages=126|authorlink=|coauthors=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Historical examples of chemistry===
Kuhn explains his ideas using examples taken from the [[history of science]]. For instance, eighteenth century scientists believed that homogenous solutions were [[chemical compound]]s.  Therefore, a combination of [[water]] and [[alcohol]] was generally classified as a ''compound''. Nowadays it is considered to be a ''solution'', but there was no reason then to suspect that it was not a compound. Water and alcohol would not separate spontaneously, nor will they separate completely upon [[distillation]] (they form an [[azeotrope]]). Water and alcohol can be [[miscibility|combined in any proportion]].

Under this paradigm, scientists believed that chemical reactions (such as the combination of water and alcohol) did not necessarily occur in fixed proportion. This belief was ultimately overturned by [[John Dalton|Dalton’s]] [[atomic theory]], which asserted that atoms can only combine in simple, whole-number ratios. Under this new paradigm, any reaction which did not occur in fixed proportion could not be a chemical process. This type world-view transition among the scientific community exemplifies Kuhn's paradigm shift.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://projektintegracija.pravo.hr/_download/repository/Kuhn_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions.pdf|title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions|last=Kuhn|first=Thomas S.|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1962|isbn=9780226458113|edition=1st|location=Chicago, IL|pages=130–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copernican Revolution===
{{main article|Copernican Revolution}}
A famous example of a revolution in scientific thought is the [[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium|Copernican Revolution]]. In [[Ptolemy]]'s school of thought, [[Deferent and epicycle|cycles and epicycles]] (with some additional concepts) were used for modeling the movements of the [[planet]]s in a cosmos that had a stationary Earth at its center. As [[accuracy]] of [[celestial observation]]s increased, complexity of the Ptolemaic cyclical and epicyclical mechanisms had to increase to maintain the calculated planetary positions close to the observed positions. [[Copernicus]] proposed a cosmology in which the Sun was at the center and the Earth was one of the planets revolving around it. For modeling the planetary motions, Copernicus used the tools he was familiar with, namely the cycles and epicycles of the Ptolemaic toolbox. Yet Copernicus' model needed more cycles and epicycles than existed in the then-current Ptolemaic model, and due to a lack of accuracy in calculations, his model did not appear to provide more accurate predictions than the Ptolemy model. Copernicus' contemporaries rejected his [[cosmology]], and Kuhn asserts that they were quite right to do so: Copernicus' cosmology lacked credibility.

Kuhn illustrates how a paradigm shift later became possible when [[Galileo Galilei]] introduced his new ideas concerning motion. Intuitively, when an object is set in motion, it soon comes to a halt. A well-made cart may travel a long distance before it stops, but unless something keeps pushing it, it will eventually stop moving. Aristotle had argued that this was presumably a fundamental property of [[nature]]: for the motion of an object to be sustained, it must continue to be pushed. Given the knowledge available at the time, this represented sensible, reasonable thinking.

Galileo put forward a bold alternative conjecture: suppose, he said, that we always observe objects coming to a halt simply because some [[friction]] is always occurring. Galileo had no equipment with which to objectively confirm his conjecture, but he suggested that without any friction to slow down an object in motion, its inherent tendency is to maintain its [[speed]] without the application of any additional [[force]].

The Ptolemaic approach of using cycles and epicycles was becoming strained: there seemed to be no end to the mushrooming growth in complexity required to account for the observable phenomena. [[Johannes Kepler]] was the first person to abandon the tools of the Ptolemaic paradigm. He started to explore the possibility that the planet [[Mars]] might have an [[elliptical orbit]] rather than a [[circular orbit|circular]] one. Clearly, the [[angular velocity]] could not be constant, but it proved very difficult to find the formula describing the rate of change of the planet's angular velocity. After many years of calculations, Kepler arrived at what we now know as the [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion#Kepler's second law|law of equal areas]].

Galileo's conjecture was merely that &amp;mdash; a conjecture. So was Kepler's cosmology. But each conjecture increased the credibility of the other, and together, they changed the prevailing perceptions of the scientific community. Later, [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] showed that Kepler's three laws could all be derived from a single theory of motion and planetary motion. Newton solidified and unified the paradigm shift that Galileo and Kepler had initiated.

===Coherence===
One of the aims of science is to find models that will account for as many observations as possible within a coherent framework. Together, Galileo's rethinking of the nature of motion and Keplerian cosmology represented a coherent framework that was capable of rivaling the Aristotelian/Ptolemaic framework.

Once a paradigm shift has taken place, the textbooks are rewritten. Often the [[history of science]] too is rewritten, being presented as an inevitable process leading up to the current, established framework of thought. There is a prevalent belief that all hitherto-unexplained phenomena will in due course be accounted for in terms of this established framework. Kuhn states that scientists spend most (if not all) of their careers in a process of puzzle-solving. Their puzzle-solving is pursued with great tenacity, because the previous successes of the established paradigm tend to generate great confidence that the approach being taken guarantees that a solution to the puzzle exists, even though it may be very hard to find. Kuhn calls this process ''[[normal science]]''.

As a paradigm is stretched to its limits, ''anomalies'' &amp;mdash; failures of the current paradigm to take into account observed phenomena &amp;mdash; accumulate. Their significance is judged by the practitioners of the discipline. Some anomalies may be dismissed as errors in observation, others as merely requiring small adjustments to the current paradigm that will be clarified in due course. Some anomalies resolve themselves spontaneously, having increased the available depth of insight along the way. But no matter how great or numerous the anomalies that persist, Kuhn observes, the practicing scientists will not lose faith in the established paradigm until a credible alternative is available; to lose faith in the solvability of the problems would in effect mean ceasing to be a scientist.

In any community of scientists, Kuhn states, there are some individuals who are bolder than most. These scientists, judging that a ''crisis'' exists, embark on what Kuhn calls ''revolutionary science'', exploring alternatives to long-held, obvious-seeming assumptions. Occasionally this generates a rival to the established framework of thought. The new candidate paradigm will appear to be accompanied by numerous anomalies, partly because it is still so new and incomplete. The majority of the scientific community will oppose any conceptual change, and, Kuhn emphasizes, so they should. To fulfill its potential, a scientific community needs to contain both individuals who are bold and individuals who are conservative. There are many examples in the history of science in which confidence in the established frame of thought was eventually vindicated. It is almost impossible to predict whether the anomalies in a candidate for a new paradigm will eventually be resolved. Those scientists who possess an exceptional ability to recognize a theory's potential will be the first whose preference is likely to shift in favour of the challenging paradigm. There typically follows a period in which there are adherents of both paradigms. In time, if the challenging paradigm is solidified and unified, it will replace the old paradigm, and a ''paradigm shift'' will have occurred.

===Phases===
Kuhn explains the process of scientific change as the result of various phases of paradigm change.

* Phase 1&amp;nbsp;– It exists only once and is the ''pre-paradigm phase'', in which there is no consensus on any particular [[theory]]. This phase is characterized by several incompatible and incomplete theories. Consequently, most scientific inquiry takes the form of lengthy books, as there is no common body of facts that may be taken for granted.  If the actors in the pre-paradigm community eventually gravitate to one of these [[conceptual framework]]s and ultimately to a widespread consensus on the appropriate choice of [[Scientific method|methods]], [[terminology]] and on the kinds of [[experiment]] that are likely to contribute to increased [[insight]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://projektintegracija.pravo.hr/_download/repository/Kuhn_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions.pdf|title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions|last=Kuhn|first=Thomas S.|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1962|isbn=9780226458113|edition=1st|location=Chicago, IL|chapter=II. The Route to Normal Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Phase 2&amp;nbsp;– [[Normal science]] begins, in which puzzles are solved within the context of the dominant paradigm. As long as there is consensus within the discipline, normal science continues. Over time, progress in normal science may reveal anomalies, facts that are difficult to explain within the context of the existing paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://projektintegracija.pravo.hr/_download/repository/Kuhn_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions.pdf|title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions|last=Kuhn|first=Thomas S.|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1962|isbn=9780226458113|edition=1st|location=Chicago, IL|chapter=VI. Anomaly and the Emergence of Scientific Discoveries}}&lt;/ref&gt; While usually these anomalies are resolved, in some cases they may accumulate to the point where normal science becomes difficult and where weaknesses in the old paradigm are revealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://projektintegracija.pravo.hr/_download/repository/Kuhn_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions.pdf|title=The Structure of Scientific Revolution|last=Kuhn|first=Thomas S.|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1962|isbn=9780226458113|edition=1st|location=Chicago, IL|chapter=III. The Nature of Normal Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Phase 3&amp;nbsp;– If the paradigm proves chronically unable to account for anomalies, the community enters a crisis period. Crises are often resolved within the context of normal science. However, after significant efforts of normal science within a paradigm fail, science may enter the next phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://projektintegracija.pravo.hr/_download/repository/Kuhn_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions.pdf|title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions|last=Kuhn|first=Thomas S.|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1962|isbn=9780226458113|edition=1st|location=Chicago, IL|chapter=VII. Crisis and the Emergence of Scientific Theories}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Phase 4&amp;nbsp;– [[Paradigm shift]], or scientific revolution, is the phase in which the underlying assumptions of the field are reexamined and a new paradigm is established.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://projektintegracija.pravo.hr/_download/repository/Kuhn_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions.pdf|title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions|last=Kuhn|first=Thomas S.|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1962|isbn=9780226458113|edition=1st|location=Chicago, IL|chapter=Section IX. The Nature and Necessity of Scientific Revolutions}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Phase 5&amp;nbsp;– Post-Revolution, the new paradigm's dominance is established and so scientists return to normal science, solving puzzles within the new paradigm.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://projektintegracija.pravo.hr/_download/repository/Kuhn_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions.pdf|title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions|last=Kuhn|first=Thomas S.|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1962|isbn=9780226458113|edition=1st|location=Chicago, IL|chapter=XII. The Resolution of Revolutions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A science may go through these cycles repeatedly, though Kuhn notes that it is a good thing for science that such shifts do not occur often or easily.

===Incommensurability===
According to Kuhn, the scientific paradigms preceding and succeeding a paradigm shift are so different that their theories are [[commensurability (philosophy of science)|incommensurable]] &amp;mdash; the new paradigm cannot be proven or disproven by the rules of the old paradigm, and vice versa. (A later interpretation by Kuhn of 'commensurable' versus 'incommensurable' was as a distinction between ''languages'', namely, that statements in commensurable languages were translatable fully from one to the other, while in ''in''commensurable languages, strict translation is not possible.&lt;ref name=Conant&gt;

{{cite book |page=4 |chapter=Editors' introduction |author=James Conant, John Haugeland |title=The Road Since Structure: Philosophical Essays, 1970-1993, with an Autobiographical Interview |edition=2nd |year=2002 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0226457990}}

&lt;/ref&gt;) The paradigm shift does not merely involve the revision or transformation of an individual theory, it changes the way terminology is defined, how the scientists in that field view their subject, and, perhaps most significantly, what questions are regarded as valid, and what rules are used to determine the truth of a particular theory. The new theories were not, as the scientists had previously thought, just extensions of old theories, but were instead completely new world views.
Such incommensurability exists not just before and after a paradigm shift, but in the periods in between conflicting paradigms. It is simply not possible, according to Kuhn, to construct an impartial language that can be used to perform a neutral comparison between conflicting paradigms, because the very terms used are integral to the respective paradigms, and therefore have different connotations in each paradigm. The advocates of mutually exclusive paradigms are in a difficult position: ''"Though each may hope to convert the other to his way of seeing science and its problems, neither may hope to prove his case. The competition between paradigms is not the sort of battle that can be resolved by proofs."''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://projektintegracija.pravo.hr/_download/repository/Kuhn_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions.pdf|title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions|last=Kuhn|first=Thomas S.|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1962|isbn=9780226458113|edition=1st|location=Chicago, IL|pages=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists subscribing to different paradigms end up [[talking past each other|talking past one another]].

Kuhn states that the probabilistic tools used by [[Verificationism|verificationists]] are inherently inadequate for the task of deciding between conflicting theories, since they belong to the very paradigms they seek to compare. Similarly, observations that are intended to [[falsifiability|falsify]] a statement will fall under one of the paradigms they are supposed to help compare, and will therefore also be inadequate for the task. According to Kuhn, the concept of falsifiability is unhelpful for understanding why and how science has developed as it has. In the practice of science, scientists will only consider the possibility that a theory has been falsified if an alternative theory is available that they judge credible. If there is not, scientists will continue to adhere to the established conceptual framework. If a paradigm shift has occurred, the textbooks will be rewritten to state that the previous theory has been falsified.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Kuhn further developed his ideas regarding incommensurability in the 1980s and 1990s. In his unpublished manuscript ''The Plurality of Worlds'', Kuhn introduces the theory of ''kind concepts:'' sets of interrelated concepts that are characteristic of a time period in a science and differ in structure from the modern analogous kind concepts. These different structures imply different “[[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomies]]” of things and processes, and this difference in taxonomies constitutes incommensurability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kuhn's Structure of Scientific Revolutions - 50 Years On|last=Hoyningen-Huene|first=Paul|publisher=Springer International Publishing|year=2015|isbn=978-3-319-13382-9|series=Boston Studies in the Philosophy and History of Science|volume=311|chapter=Kuhn’s Development Before and After Structure}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory is strongly naturalistic and draws on developmental psychology to “found a quasi-transcendental theory of experience and of reality.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-13383-6_13|title=Kuhn’s Development Before and After Structure|last=Hoyningen-Huene|first=Paul|date=March 19, 2015|website=Springer Link|publisher=Springer International Publishing|access-date=March 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exemplar===
Kuhn introduced the concept of an '''exemplar''' in a [[postscript]] to the second edition of ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'' (1970). He noted that he was substituting the term 'exemplars' for 'paradigm', meaning the problems and solutions that students of a subject learn from the beginning of their education. For example, [[physicists]] might have as exemplars the [[inclined plane]], [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]], or instruments like the [[calorimeter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kuhn|first1=Thomas S.|title=The structure of scientific revolutions|date=1970|publisher=Univ. of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-45804-0|page=187|edition=2nd, Enlarged|url=http://projektintegracija.pravo.hr/_download/repository/Kuhn_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions.pdf|accessdate=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bird|first1=Alexander|title=Thomas Kuhn|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/thomas-kuhn/|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|accessdate=23 September 2017|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kuhn, scientific practice alternates between periods of [[normal science]] and [[revolutionary science]]. During periods of normalcy, scientists tend to subscribe to a large body of interconnecting knowledge, methods, and assumptions which make up the reigning [[paradigm]] (see [[paradigm shift]]). Normal science presents a series of problems that are solved as scientists explore their field.  The solutions to some of these problems become well known and are the exemplars of the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bird|first1=Alexander|last2=Ladyman|first2=James|title=Arguing about Science|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415492294|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=iGpd3xLGNbYC&amp;pg=PA218&amp;lpg=PA218&amp;dq=well+known+and+are+the+exemplars+of+the+field&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1pbH6r4V31&amp;sig=HrM_caYtCICZB7lj47STp59wmnQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwii1c25v7vWAhWLI8AKHVLJDC8Q6AEIRjAH#v=onepage&amp;q=well%20known%20and%20are%20the%20exemplars%20of%20the%20field&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kuhn's Structure of Scientific Revolutions|url=http://philosophy.wisc.edu/forster/220/notes_8.html|website=philosophy.wisc.edu|accessdate=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who study a scientific discipline are expected to know its exemplars.  There is no fixed set of exemplars, but for a physicist today it would probably include the [[harmonic oscillator]] from [[mechanics]] and the [[hydrogen atom]] from [[quantum mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wray|first1=K.

==Kuhn on scientific progress==
The first edition of ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'' ended with a chapter titled "Progress through Revolutions", in which Kuhn spelled out his views on the nature of scientific progress. Since he considered problem solving to be a central element of science, Kuhn saw that for a new candidate paradigm to be accepted by a scientific community, "First, the new candidate must seem to resolve some outstanding and generally recognized problem that can be met in no other way. Second, the new paradigm must promise to preserve a relatively large part of the concrete problem solving activity that has accrued to science through its predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://projektintegracija.pravo.hr/_download/repository/Kuhn_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions.pdf|title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions|last=Kuhn|first=T.S.|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1962|isbn=9780226458113|location=Chicago, IL|pages=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://projektintegracija.pravo.hr/_download/repository/Kuhn_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions.pdf|title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions|last=Kuhn|first=Thomas S.|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1962|isbn=9780226458113|edition=1st|location=Chicago, IL|pages=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the new paradigm is rarely as expansive as the old paradigm in its initial stages, it must nevertheless have significant promise for future problem-solving. As a result, though new paradigms seldom or never possess all the capabilities of their predecessors, they usually preserve a great deal of the most concrete parts of past achievement and they always permit additional concrete problem-solutions besides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://projektintegracija.pravo.hr/_download/repository/Kuhn_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions.pdf|title=Structure of Scientific Revolutions|last=Kuhn|first=Thomas S.|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1962|isbn=9780226458113|edition=1st|location=Chicago, IL|pages=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second edition, Kuhn added a postscript in which he elaborated his ideas on the nature of scientific progress. He described a thought experiment involving an observer who has the opportunity to inspect an assortment of theories, each corresponding to a single stage in a succession of theories. What if the observer is presented with these theories without any explicit indication of their chronological order? Kuhn anticipates that it will be possible to reconstruct their chronology on the basis of the theories' scope and content, because the more recent a theory is, the better it will be as an instrument for solving the kinds of puzzle that scientists aim to solve. Kuhn remarked: "That is not a [[relativism|relativist's]] position, and it displays the sense in which I am a convinced believer in scientific progress."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions|last=Kuhn|first=Thomas S.|publisher=Chicago University Press|year=1970|isbn=9780226458113|edition=2nd|location=Chicago, IL|pages=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Discussed further in David Weinberger "Shift Happens."

==Influence and reception==
''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'' has been credited with producing the kind of "paradigm shift" Kuhn discussed.&lt;ref name=naughton2012/&gt; Since the book’s publication, over one million copies have been sold, including translations into sixteen different languages.&lt;ref&gt;Figures cited in John Horgan, “Profile: Reluctant Revolutionary—Thomas S. Kuhn Unleashed ‘Paradigm’ on the World,” ''Scientific American'' (May 1991), 40.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, it was reported to be the twentieth-century book most frequently cited in the period 1976–1983 in the arts and the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;E.

=== Philosophy&lt;!--'Historical turn' redirects here--&gt; ===
The first extensive review of ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'' was authored by Dudley Shapere, a philosopher who interpreted Kuhn's work as a continuation of the anti-[[Positivism|positivist]] sentiment of other philosophers of science, including [[Paul Feyerabend]] and [[Norwood Russell Hanson]]. Shapere noted the book’s influence on the philosophical landscape of the time, calling it “a sustained attack on the prevailing image of scientific change as a linear process of ever-increasing knowledge.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shapere|first=Dudley|date=1964|title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions|url=|journal=The Philosophical Review|volume=73|page=383|doi=10.2307/2183664|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the philosopher [[Michael Ruse]], Kuhn discredited the ahistorical and prescriptive approach to the philosophy of science of Ernest Nagel's ''[[The Structure of Science]]'' (1961).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ruse, Michael |editor=Honderich, Ted |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=2005 |page=637 |isbn=0-19-926479-1 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kuhn's book sparked a [[Historicism|historicist]] "revolt against positivism" (the so-called "'''historical turn'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; in philosophy of science" which looked to the history of science as a source of data for developing a philosophy of science),&lt;ref&gt;K. Brad Wray, ''Kuhn's Evolutionary Social Epistemology'', Cambridge University Press, 2011, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; although this may not have been Kuhn’s intention; in fact, he had already approached the prominent positivist [[Rudolf Carnap]] about having his work published in the ''[[International Encyclopedia of Unified Science]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fuller|first=Steve|date=1992|title=Being There with Thomas Kuhn: A Parable for Postmodern Times|url=|journal=History and Theory|volume=31.3|page=244|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Robert C. Solomon]] noted that Kuhn's views have often been suggested to have an affinity to those of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Solomon, Robert C. |title=In the Spirit of Hegel: A Study of G.

=== Sociology ===
The first field to claim descent from Kuhn’s ideas was the [[sociology of scientific knowledge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fuller|first=Steve|date=1992|title=Being There with Thomas Kuhn: A Parable for Postmodern Times|url=|journal=History and Theory|volume=31.3|page=247|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sociology|Sociologists]] working within this new field, including [[Harry Collins]] and [[Steven Shapin]], used Kuhn’s emphasis on the role of non-evidential community factors in scientific development to argue against [[logical empiricism]], which discouraged inquiry into the social aspects of scientific communities. These sociologists expanded upon Kuhn’s ideas, arguing that scientific judgment is determined by social factors, such as professional interests and [[Ideology|political ideologies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-knowledge-social/|title=The Social Dimensions of Scientific Knowledge|last=Longino|first=Helen|date=April 12, 2002|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=The Metaphysics Research Lab, Center for the Study of Language and Information (CSLI), Stanford University|access-date=March 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[S. Barry Barnes|Barry Barnes]] detailed the connection between the sociology of scientific knowledge and Kuhn in his book ''T. S. Kuhn and Social Science.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=T.S. Kuhn and Social Science|last=Barnes|first=Barry|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1982|isbn=9780231054362|location=New York City, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Kuhn’s ideas regarding science occurring within an established framework informed Barnes's own ideas regarding finitism, a theory wherein meaning is continuously changed (even during periods of normal science) by its usage within the social framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ziman|first=J.M.|date=1982|title=T.

''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'' elicited a number of reactions from the broader sociological community. Following the book's publication, some sociologists expressed the belief that the field of sociology had not yet developed a unifying paradigm, and should therefore strive towards homogenization. Others argued that the field was in the midst of normal science, and speculated that a new revolution would soon emerge. Some sociologists, including [[John Urry (sociologist)|John Urry]], doubted that Kuhn's theory, which addressed the development of natural science, was necessarily relevant to sociological development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Urry|first=John|date=1973|title=Thomas S.

=== Economics ===
Developments in the field of economics are often expressed and legitimized in Kuhnian terms. For instance, [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical economists]] have claimed “to be at the second stage [normal science], and to have been there for a very long time – since [[Adam Smith]], according to some accounts (Hollander, 1987), or [[William Stanley Jevons|Jevons]] according to others (Hutchison, 1978).”&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of Post Keynesian Economics Since 1936|last=King|first=J.E.|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing, Inc.|year=2002|isbn=1843766507|location=Cheltenham, UK|pages=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, [[Post-Keynesian economics|Post Keynesian]] economists denied the coherence of the neoclassical paradigm, claiming that their own paradigm would ultimately become dominant.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

While perhaps less explicit, Kuhn’s influence remains apparent in recent economics. For instance, the abstract of [[Olivier Blanchard|Olivier Blanchard’s]] paper “The State of Macro” (2008) begins:{{Quote|text=For a long while after the explosion of macroeconomics in the 1970s, the field looked like a battlefield. Over time however, largely because facts do not go away, a largely shared vision both of fluctuations and of methodology has emerged. Not everything is fine. Like all revolutions, this one has come with the destruction of some knowledge, and suffers from extremism and herding.&lt;ref&gt;Blanchard, Olivier J. ''The State of Macro''. National Bureau of Economic Research, 2008, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Political science ===
In 1974, ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'' was ranked as the second most frequently used book in political science courses focused on scope and methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fox|first=Charles|date=1974|title=Whose Works Must Graduate Students Read?|journal=A NEW Political Science|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Kuhn’s theory has been used by political scientists to critique [[behavioralism]], which claims that accurate political statements must be both testable and falsifiable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ricci|first=David|date=1977|title=Reading Thomas Kuhn in the Post-Behavioral Era|jstor=448209|journal=The Western Political Quarterly|volume=30|doi=10.1177/106591297703000102}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book also proved popular with political scientists embroiled in debates about whether a set of formulations put forth by a political scientists constituted a theory, or something else.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephens|first=Jerome|date=1973|title=The Kuhnian Paradigm and Political Inquiry: An Appraisal|jstor=2110740|journal=American Journal of Political Science|volume=17|page=468|doi=10.2307/2110740}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The changes that occur in [[politics]], [[society]] and [[business]] are often expressed in Kuhnian terms, however poor their parallel with the practice of science may seem to scientists and historians of science. The terms "[[paradigm]]" and "[[paradigm shift]]" have become such notorious clichés and buzzwords that they are sometimes viewed as effectively devoid of content.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Fulford, Globe and Mail (June 5, 1999).[http://www.robertfulford.com/Paradigm.html] Retrieved on 2008-04-25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Complete Idiot's Guide to a Smart Vocabulary" pp. 142-143, author: Paul McFedries publisher: Alpha; 1st edition (May 7, 2001), {{ISBN|978-0-02-863997-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
[[File:Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge pb.png|thumb|200 px|Front cover of Imre Lakatos and Alan Musgrave, ed., ''Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge''.]]
''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'' was soon criticized by Kuhn's colleagues in the history and philosophy of science. In 1965, a special symposium on the book was held at an International Colloquium on the Philosophy of Science that took place at [[Bedford College (London)|Bedford College]], London, and was chaired by [[Karl Popper]]. The symposium led to the publication of the symposium's presentations plus other essays, most of them critical, which eventually appeared in an influential volume of essays. Kuhn expressed the opinion that his critics' readings of his book were so inconsistent with his own understanding of it that he was "...tempted to posit the existence of two Thomas Kuhns," one the author of his book, the other the individual who had been criticized in the symposium by "Professors Popper, Feyerabend, [[Imre Lakatos|Lakatos]], [[Stephen Toulmin|Toulmin]] and Watkins."&lt;ref&gt;Imre Lakatos and Alan Musgrave, eds. ''Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge'': Volume 4: Proceedings of the International Colloquium in the Philosophy of Science, London, 1965, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1970), pp. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of the included essays question the existence of normal science. In his essay, Feyerabend suggests that Kuhn’s conception of normal science fits organized crime as well as it does science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dolby|first=R. G. A.|date=1971|title=Reviewed Work: Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge.

===Concept of paradigm===
In his 1972 work, ''Human Understanding'', [[Stephen Toulmin]] argued that a more realistic picture of science than that presented in ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'' would admit the fact that revisions in science take place much more frequently, and are much less dramatic than can be explained by the model of revolution/normal science. In Toulmin's view, such revisions occur quite often during periods of what Kuhn would call "normal science." For Kuhn to explain such revisions in terms of the non-paradigmatic puzzle solutions of normal science, he would need to delineate what is perhaps an implausibly sharp distinction between paradigmatic and non-paradigmatic science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Human Understanding |last=Toulmin |first=S. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1972 |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-824361-8 |page= |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Incommensurability of paradigms===
In a series of texts published in the early 1970s, Carl R. Kordig asserted a position somewhere between that of Kuhn and the older philosophy of science. His criticism of the Kuhnian position was that the incommensurability thesis was too radical, and that this made it impossible to explain the confrontation of scientific theories that actually occurs. According to Kordig, it is in fact possible to admit the existence of revolutions and paradigm shifts in science while still recognizing that theories belonging to different paradigms can be compared and confronted on the plane of observation. Those who accept the incommensurability thesis do not do so because they admit the discontinuity of paradigms, but because they attribute a radical change in meanings to such shifts.&lt;ref name="Kord" &gt;{{cite journal |last=Kordig |first=Carl R. |date=December 1973 |title=Discussion: Observational Invariance |journal=[[Philosophy of Science (journal)|Philosophy of Science]] |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |volume=40 |issue= |pages=558–569 |doi=10.1086/288565 |jstor=186288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kordig maintains that there is a common observational plane. For example, when [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] and [[Tycho Brahe]] are trying to explain the relative variation of the distance of the sun from the horizon at sunrise, both see the same thing (the same configuration is focused on the retina of each individual). This is just one example of the fact that "rival scientific theories share some observations, and therefore some meanings." Kordig suggests that with this approach, he is not reintroducing the distinction between observations and theory in which the former is assigned a privileged and neutral status, but that it is possible to affirm more simply the fact that, even if no sharp distinction exists between theory and observations, this does not imply that there are no comprehensible differences at the two extremes of this polarity.

At a secondary level, for Kordig there is a common plane of inter-paradigmatic standards or shared norms that permit the effective confrontation of rival theories.&lt;ref name="Kord" /&gt;

In 1973, [[Hartry Field]] published an article that also sharply criticized Kuhn's idea of incommensurability. In particular, he took issue with this passage from Kuhn:

{{quote|Newtonian mass is immutably conserved; that of Einstein is convertible into energy. Only at very low relative velocities can the two masses be measured in the same way, and even then they must not be conceived as if they were the same thing. (Kuhn 1970).}}

Field takes this idea of incommensurability between the same terms in different theories one step further. Instead of attempting to identify a persistence of the reference of terms in different theories, Field's analysis emphasizes the indeterminacy of reference within individual theories. Field takes the example of the term "mass", and asks what exactly "mass" means in modern post-relativistic physics. He finds that there are at least two different definitions:

# Relativistic mass: the mass of a particle is equal to the total energy of the particle divided by the speed of light squared. Since the total energy of a particle in relation to one system of reference differs from the total energy in relation to other systems of reference, while the speed of light remains constant in all systems, it follows that the mass of a particle has different values in different systems of reference.
# "Real" mass: the mass of a particle is equal to the ''non-kinetic'' energy of a particle divided by the speed of light squared. Since non-kinetic energy is the same in all systems of reference, and the same is true of light, it follows that the mass of a particle has the same value in all systems of reference.

Projecting this distinction backwards in time onto Newtonian dynamics, we can formulate the following two hypotheses:

* HR: the term "mass" in Newtonian theory denotes relativistic mass.
* Hp: the term "mass" in Newtonian theory denotes "real" mass.

According to Field, it is impossible to decide which of these two affirmations is true. Prior to the theory of relativity, the term "mass" was ''referentially indeterminate''. But this does not mean that the term "mass" did not have a different ''meaning'' than it now has. The problem is not one of meaning but of ''reference''. The reference of such terms as mass is only ''partially determined'': we don't really know how Newton intended his use of this term to be applied. As a consequence, neither of the two terms fully denotes (refers). It follows that it is improper to maintain that a term has changed its reference during a [[scientific revolution]]; it is more appropriate to describe terms such as "mass" as "having undergone a denotional refinement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Field |first=H. |authorlink=Hartry Field |date=August 1973 |title=Theory Change and the Indeterminacy of Reference |journal=[[The Journal of Philosophy]] |publisher=[[Columbia University]] |volume=70 |issue=14 |pages=462–481 |doi=10.2307/2025110 |jstor=2025110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] objected that the concept of incommensurable scientific paradigms competing with each other is logically inconsistent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=D. |last=Davidson |authorlink=Donald Davidson (philosopher) |title=On the Very Idea of a Conceptual Scheme |journal=[[Proceedings and Addresses of the American Philosophical Association]] |url=http://files.meetup.com/328570/davidson_on-the-very-idea.pdf |year=1973-1974 |volume=47 |pages=5–20 |doi=10.2307/3129898 |jstor=3129898}} In 1984, the essay became [https://books.google.com/books?id=4d9rAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22On+the+Very+Idea+of+a+conceptual+Scheme%22 chapter 13 (pp. 183–198)] of [https://books.google.com/books?id=4d9rAAAAIAAJ ''Inquiries into Truth and Interpretation''], [[Clarendon Press]], {{ISBN|0-198-75046-3}}; {{ISBN|978-0-198-75046-8}}.

===Incommensurability and perception===
The close connection between the interpretationalist hypothesis and a holistic conception of beliefs is at the root of the notion of the dependence of perception on theory, a central concept in ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions''. Kuhn maintained that the perception of the world depends on how the percipient ''conceives'' the world: two scientists who witness the same phenomenon and are steeped in two radically different theories will see two different things. According to this view, our interpretation of the world determines what we see.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Jerry A. Fodor |last=Ferretti |first=F. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2001 |publisher=Editori Laterza |location=Rome |isbn=88-420-6220-0 |page= |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jerry Fodor]] attempts to establish that this theoretical paradigm is fallacious and misleading by demonstrating the impenetrability of perception to the background knowledge of subjects. The strongest case can be based on evidence from experimental cognitive psychology, namely the persistence of perceptual illusions. Knowing that the lines in the [[Müller-Lyer illusion]] are equal does not prevent one from continuing to see one line as being longer than the other. This impenetrability of the information elaborated by the mental modules limits the scope of interpretationalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cognitive Turn: Sociological and Psychological Perspectives on Science|last=de Gelder|first=Beatrice|publisher=Springer Netherlands|year=1989|isbn=978-0-7923-0306-0|series=Sociology of the Sciences Yearbook|volume=13|pages=97–100|chapter=Granny, The Naked Emperor and the Second Cognitive Revolution}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In epistemology, for example, the criticism of what Fodor calls the interpretationalist hypothesis accounts for the common-sense intuition (on which [[naïve physics]] is based) of the independence of reality from the conceptual categories of the experimenter. If the processes of elaboration of the mental modules are in fact independent of the background theories, then it is possible to maintain the realist view that two scientists who embrace two radically diverse theories see the world exactly in the same manner even if they interpret it differently. The point is that it is necessary to distinguish between observations and the perceptual fixation of beliefs. While it is beyond doubt that the second process involves the holistic relationship between beliefs, the first is largely independent of the background beliefs of individuals.

Other critics, such as [[Israel Scheffler]], [[Hilary Putnam]] and [[Saul Kripke]], have focused on the [[Frege]]an distinction between sense and reference in order to defend [[scientific realism]]. Scheffler contends that Kuhn confuses the meanings of terms such as "mass" with their [[referent]]s. While their meanings may very well differ, their [[referent]]s (the objects or entities to which they correspond in the external world) remain fixed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Subjectivity|last=Scheffler|first=Israel|publisher=Hackett Publishing Company|year=1982|location=Indianapolis, IN|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tolerable weekly intake''' (TWI) estimates the amount per unit body weight of a potentially harmful substance or contaminant in food or water that can be ingested over a lifetime without risk of adverse health effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = IUPAC Glossary of Terms Used in Toxicology, 2nd Edition – Terms Starting with T|url = http://sis.nlm.nih.gov/enviro/iupacglossary/glossaryt.html|website = sis.nlm.nih.gov|accessdate = 2015-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Estimation of Seasonal Risk Caused by the Intake of Lead, Mercury and Cadmium through Freshwater Fish Consumption from Urban Water Reservoirs in Arid Areas of Northern Mexico|journal = International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health|date = 2015-02-01|issn = 1661-7827|pmc = 4344694|pmid = 25658686|pages = 1803–1816|volume = 12|issue = 2|doi = 10.3390/ijerph120201803|first = Myrna|last = Nevárez|first2 = Luz O.|last2 = Leal|first3 = Myriam|last3 = Moreno}}&lt;/ref&gt; TWI is generally preceded by "provisional" to indicate insufficient data exists, increasing uncertainty.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Background to the ADI/TDI/PTWI|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273230099913351|journal = Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology|date = 1999-10-01|pages = S109-S113|volume = 30|issue = 2|doi = 10.1006/rtph.1999.1335|first = J. L.|last = Herrman|first2 = M.|last2 = Younes}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The term TWI should be reserved for when there is a well-established and internationally accepted tolerance, backed by sound and uncontested data. Although similar in concept to tolerable daily intake (TDI), which is of the same derivation of [[acceptable daily intake]]s (ADIs), TWI accounts for contaminants that do not clear the body quickly and may accumulate within the body over a period of time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  An example is heavy metals such as arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = http://koreascience.or.kr/journal/view.jsp?kj=DSHHBQ&amp;py=2012&amp;vnc=v28n3&amp;sp=143|url = http://koreascience.or.kr/journal/view.jsp?kj=DSHHBQ&amp;py=2012&amp;vnc=v28n3&amp;sp=143|journal = Toxicological Research|pages = 143–149|volume = 28|issue = 3|doi = 10.5487/tr.2012.28.3.143|first = Ji-Ae|last = Kim|first2 = Seung-Ha|last2 = Lee|first3 = Seung-Hyun|last3 = Choi|first4 = Ki-Kyung|last4 = Jung|first5 = Mi-Sun|last5 = Park|first6 = Ji-Yoon|last6 = Jeong|first7 = Myung-Sil|last7 = Hwang|first8 = Hae-Jung|last8 = Yoon|first9 = Dal-Woong|last9 = Choi|pmc = 3834422}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of TWI takes into account daily variations in human consumption patterns.

==Background==
Governments and international organizations such as the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), the Joint FAO/WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues (JMPR), the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and the [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO) generally use the safety factor approach, based on ADI, to determine intake tolerances for substances that exhibit thresholds for toxicity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The Codex Alimentarius Commission, with the help of independent international risk assessment bodies or ad-hoc consultations organized by FAO and WHO, develops and publishes tolerances based on the best available science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CODEX Alimentarius: About Codex|url = http://www.codexalimentarius.org/about-codex/en/|website = www.codexalimentarius.org|accessdate = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After identifying a substance of concern, researchers and experts then study information the substance's metabolism by humans and animals (as appropriate), the substance's [[toxicokinetics]] and [[toxicodynamics]] (including carry-over of the toxic substance from feed to edible animal tissue/products); and the substance's acute and long term toxicity in order to determine the acceptability and safety of intake levels of the substance.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  In comparison to TWI, the Codex maximum level (ML) for a food is the maximum concentration of that substance recommended by the Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC) to be legally permitted in that commodity.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/agns/pdf/CXS_193e.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Data Sources ==
# The JECFA makes a distinction between acceptable intakes and tolerable intakes. Tolerable is used to demonstrate permissibility, not acceptability.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Substances such as [[food additive]]s, veterinary drugs, and pesticides that can be controlled in the food supply relatively easily are assessed an acceptable daily intake, or ADI.  Other substances considered contaminants are assessed a tolerable daily or weekly intake, TDI or TWI, respectively.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Tolerable intakes, whether daily, weekly, or monthly, should not be confused with [[Reference Daily Intake|reference daily intake]], or RDI.  RDI refers to the amount of a given nutrient individuals should uptake to maintain health.
# When determining TWI, appropriate safety factors are applied to allow for extrapolation of human [[no-observed-adverse-effect level]]s (NOAELs). NOAELs are established by toxicological studies in animals, and the appropriate safety factors are applied so human NOAELs can be extrapolated.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Precision of Estimates of an ADI (or TDI or PTWI)|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273230099913314|journal = Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology|date = 1999-10-01|pages = S87-S93|volume = 30|issue = 2|doi = 10.1006/rtph.1999.1331|first = Gerrit J. A.|last = Speijers}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For additives that have an observed effect, and it is not known whether or not the effect is negative, ADI is based on a no observed effect level, or NOEL.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;   To determine the NOEL, researchers primarily use animals (the species most sensitive to the treatments) and carefully select doses until they determine the highest dose that presents an adverse (toxic, but not deadly) effect not observed in lowest dose.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; When adverse effects predominate, the JMPR bases the ADI on the NOAELs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Uncertainty factors&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Guidance values for human exposure limits (EHC 170, 1994)|url = http://www.inchem.org/documents/ehc/ehc/ehc170.htm|website = www.inchem.org|accessdate = 2015-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; are applied to account for intra- and inter-species differences.

==Calculations==

Tolerable intake is usually expressed in micrograms or milligrams per kilogram of body weight.  Intake (exposure) is determined using the following formula:

Exposure = ∑&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;
(consumption)&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; x (concentration)&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; / Body Weight

Founded in 1974, the '''University of Ouagadougou''' ('''UO'''; {{lang-fr|'''Université de Ouagadougou'''}}) is in the area of Dagnöen Nord (pronounced dag-no-en noor) in [[Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso]]. It was officially renamed in 2015 as l’Université Ouaga 1 Professeur Ki-Zerbo.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20151227-burkina-faso-universite-ouagadougou-nom-professeur-ki-zerbo&lt;/ref&gt; The UO consists of seven Training and Research Units (UFR) and one institute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.univ-ouaga.bf/html/presentation/frpresentation.html Université De Ouagadougou (2004-2005). Les UFR et les Institutions. Université De Ouaga] Retrieved on {{#dateformat:March 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 a second campus for professional education known as the University Polytechnique of Bobo (UPB) was opened in the city of [[Bobo Dioulasso]] and a third campus for teacher training/trainers in Koudougou. In 1996 and in 2005, it became the University of Koudougou. 

The university had around 40,000 students in 2010 (83% of the national population of university students).&lt;ref&gt;Government of France, MINISTERE DES AFFAIRES ETRANGERES ET EUROPEENNES, AMBASSADE DE FRANCE AU BURKINA FASO, FICHE BURKINA FASO, (French)http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/IMG/pdf/BURKINA_18-5-11__2_.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academics ==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Ingang van de universiteit van Ouagadougou TMnr 20010636.jpg|thumb|University of Ouagadougou, 1979]]

=== Academic departments and program ===
The [[University]] of [[Ouagadougou]] (2005A) consists of seven Training and Research Units (UFR) and one [[institute]]: UFR Languages, Arts and Communications; UFR [[Human sciences]]; UFR Legal and Politic Sciences; UFR Economic Sciences and Management; UFR Applied Sciences; UFR Health Sciences; UFR Life and Hearth Sciences and Burkinabé Institute  of Arts and Crafts. It combines the advantages of faculty (fundamental teaching) and those of an institute (professionalization).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.univ-ouaga.bf/html/formations/frFormations.html Université de Ouagadougou (2004-2005).] Retrieved on {{#dateformat:March 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The system used is the modular education system based on academic credits, which combines fundamental and [[professional]] training.

=== UFR Languages, Arts and Communications ===
For the UFR Languages, Arts and Communications (UFR/LAC) there are two courses: Arts and Communications and in letters, languages and linguistics. The unit was created in 2000 and trains students in languages, letters, arts, culture, communication and journalism. The UFR has 2,440 students. For admission, students should have the level of secondary education. For those without that level, an exam is taken. 

Students of the faculty take the DEUG (university diploma) after the first cycle, the bachelor's degree and master in communication and journalism and in interpreting after the second cycle. The last one is the postgraduate diploma and the PhD in linguistics and modern letters taken after the third cycle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.univ-ouaga.bf/html/formations/frFormations.html Université de Ouagadougou] (2004-2005).

[[File:Master students were interested in ecosan - Les étudiants en Master etaient intéressés par ecosan2.jpg|thumb|Master students at the university, 2010]]
=== UFR Human Sciences===
The UFR Human Sciences (UFR/SH) is made up of two branches: History-Geography and Archaeology. It includes four departments and two projects. It has 82 teachers for 4,004 students and five student laboratories. The degrees that students take during their studies or at the end are the [[DEUG]], the bachelor's degree, the master and the PhD according to their major.

=== UFR Legal and Politic Sciences  ===
The UFR Legal and Politic Sciences (UFR/SJP) was created in 1975 with two sections: one in Law and Political Science, and the other in Criminology. The UFR trains jurists for the private and public sectors, to promote research in the legal domain, to publish work and researchers publication. For the 2004-2005 academic year there were 25 teachers for 3,189 students.

The UFR/SJP awards the following degrees: DEUG I, DEUG II (university diploma) [[Bachelor’s degree]], [[Master's degree|Master]], DESS (postgraduate diploma) and soon DEA and [[PhD]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.univ-ouaga.bf/html/formations/frFormations.html Université de Ouagadougou (2004-2005). Formations Université de Ouaga], retrieved on {{#dateformat:March 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== UFR Applied Sciences ===
The UFR Applied Sciences (UFR/SEA) was created in 2000. It has three departments — Mathematics and Computer, Physics, and Chemistry — and 12 laboratories available for  students. Like the other UFR, the UFR/SEA awards the same degrees according to the student's major.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.univ-ouaga.bf/html/formations/frFormations.html Université de Ouagadougou] (2004-2005).

'''''Vasa''''' (or '''''Wasa''''')&lt;ref&gt;The original name of the ship was ''Vasen'' ("the fascine"), after the [[heraldry|heraldic symbol]] on the [[coat of arms]] of the [[House of Vasa]], which was also part of the coat of arms of Sweden at the time. ''Vasa'' has since become the most widely recognised name of the ship, largely because the Vasa Museum chose this form of the name as its 'official' orthography in the late 1980s. This spelling was adopted because it is the form preferred by modern Swedish language authorities, and conforms to the spelling reforms instituted in Sweden in the early 20th century.&lt;/ref&gt; is a retired [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[warship]] built between 1626 and 1628. The ship [[:wikt:founder#Verb|foundered]] after sailing about 1,300 m (1,400 yd) into its [[maiden voyage]] on 10 August 1628. It fell into obscurity after most of her valuable [[bronze]] [[cannon]]s were salvaged in the 17th century until she was located again in the late 1950s in a busy shipping lane just outside the [[Stockholm]] harbor. Salvaged with a largely intact hull in 1961, it was housed in a temporary museum called Wasavarvet ('The Wasa Shipyard') until 1988 and then moved permanently to the [[Vasa Museum]] in the [[Royal National City Park]]&lt;ref&gt;

The ship is one of Sweden's most popular tourist attractions and has been seen by over 35 million visitors since 1961.&lt;ref&gt;11&amp;nbsp;million at Wasavarvet 1961–88 and 18&amp;nbsp;million at the permanent museum since 1990. The total is based on statistics from the official website of the Vasa Museum: {{sv icon}} [http://vasamuseet.se/sv/Om/Vasamuseets-besokare/ "Museets besökare"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100814170522/http://vasamuseet.se/sv/Om/Vasamuseets-besokare/ |date=14 August 2010 }}, 2011; [http://www.vasamuseet.se/sv/Press/Basmaterial/Vasas-sista-resa/ "Vasas sista färd"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818202918/http://www.vasamuseet.se/sv/Press/Basmaterial/Vasas-sista-resa/ |date=18 August 2010 }}, 2000(?).&lt;/ref&gt; Since her recovery, ''Vasa'' has become a widely recognised symbol of the Swedish '[[Swedish Empire|great power period]]' and is today a ''de facto'' standard in the media and among Swedes for evaluating the historical importance of shipwrecks.

The ship was built on the orders of the King of Sweden [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustavus Adolphus]] as part of the military expansion he initiated in a war with [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland-Lithuania]] (1621–1629). It was constructed at the navy yard in Stockholm under a contract with private entrepreneurs in 1626–1627 and armed primarily with bronze cannons cast in Stockholm specifically for the ship. Richly decorated as a symbol of the king's ambitions for Sweden and himself, upon completion she was one of the most powerfully armed vessels in the world. However, ''Vasa'' was dangerously unstable and top-heavy with too much weight in the upper structure of the hull. Despite this lack of stability she was ordered to sea and foundered only a few minutes after encountering a wind stronger than a breeze. 

The order to sail was the result of a combination of factors. The king, who was leading the army in Poland at the time of her maiden voyage, was impatient to see her take up her station as [[flagship]] of the reserve squadron at [[Älvsnabben]] in the Stockholm Archipelago. At the same time the king's subordinates lacked the political courage to openly discuss the ship's problems or to have the maiden voyage postponed. An inquiry was organised by the [[Privy Council of Sweden|Swedish Privy Council]] to find those responsible for the disaster, but in the end no one was punished.

During the 1961 recovery, thousands of artifacts and the remains of at least 15 people were found in and around the ''Vasa'''s hull by [[Maritime archaeology|marine archaeologists]]. Among the many items found were clothing, weapons, cannons, tools, coins, cutlery, food, drink and six of the ten sails. The artifacts and the ship herself have provided scholars with invaluable insights into details of naval warfare, shipbuilding techniques and everyday life in early 17th-century Sweden.

== Historical background ==
[[File:Swedish Empire (1560-1815) en2.png|thumb|A map of Sweden's territorial gains and losses 1560–1815. In the years that ''Vasa'' was built and sank, Sweden still had not seized the southernmost of its present provinces, but possessed almost all of modern-day [[Finland]] and [[Estonia]] as well as [[Ingria]] and [[Karelia]].]]

During the 17th century, Sweden went from being a sparsely populated, poor, and peripheral northern European kingdom of little influence to one of the [[Great power|major powers]] in continental politics. Between 1611 and 1718 it was the dominant power in the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]], eventually gaining territory that encompassed the Baltic on all sides. This rise to prominence in international affairs and increase in military prowess, called ''[[Swedish Empire|stormaktstiden]]'' ('age of greatness' or 'great power period'), was made possible by a succession of able monarchs and the establishment of a powerful centralised government, supporting a highly efficient military organization. Swedish historians have described this as one of the more extreme examples of an early modern state using almost all of its available resources to wage war; the small northern kingdom transformed itself into a [[fiscal-military state]] and one of the most militarised states in history.&lt;ref&gt;Hocker in Cederlund (2006), pp. 36–39; see also Jan Glete's paper ''[http://www2.historia.su.se/personal/jan_glete/Glete-Swedish_Fiscal-military_State.pdf The Swedish fiscal-military state and its navy, 1521–1721]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustavus Adolphus]] (1594–1632) has been considered one of the most successful Swedish kings in terms of success in warfare. When ''Vasa'' was built, he had been in power for more than a decade. Sweden was embroiled in a [[Polish-Swedish War (1625–1629)|war with Poland-Lithuania]], and looked apprehensively at the development of the [[Thirty Years' War]] in present-day Germany. The war had been raging since 1618 and from a [[Protestant]] perspective it was not successful. The king's plans for a Polish campaign and for securing Sweden's interests required a strong naval presence in the Baltic.&lt;ref name="roberts"&gt;Roberts (1953–58)&lt;/ref&gt;

The navy suffered several severe setbacks during the 1620s. In 1625, a squadron cruising in the [[Bay of Riga]] was caught in a storm and ten ships ran aground and were wrecked. In the [[Battle of Oliwa]] in 1627, a Swedish squadron was outmaneuvered and defeated by a Polish force and two large ships were lost. ''Tigern'' ('The Tiger'), which was the Swedish admiral's flagship, was captured by the Poles, and ''Solen'' ('The Sun') was blown up by her own crew when she was boarded and near capture. In 1628, three more large ships were lost in less than a month; Admiral [[Clas Fleming (admiral)|Klas Fleming]]'s flagship ''Kristina'' was wrecked in a storm in the [[Gulf of Danzig]], ''Riksnyckeln'' ('Key of the Realm') ran aground at Viksten in the southern archipelago of Stockholm and ''Vasa'' foundered on her maiden voyage. Gustavus Adolphus was engaged in naval warfare on several fronts, which further exacerbated the difficulties of the navy. In addition to battling the Polish navy, the Swedes were indirectly threatened by Imperial forces that had invaded [[Jutland]]. The Swedish king had little sympathy for the Danish king, [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]], and Denmark and Sweden had been bitter enemies for well over a century. However, Sweden feared a Catholic conquest of [[Copenhagen]] and [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]]. This would have granted the Catholic powers control over the strategic passages between the [[Baltic Sea]] and the [[North Sea]], which would be disastrous for Swedish interests.&lt;ref name="roberts" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hocker in Vasa I, p. 47"&gt;Hocker in Cederlund (2006), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; As it turned out, the Imperial occupation of Denmark ended before Swedish intervention was necessary, and a squadron assigned to assist Denmark was retasked to help lift the Imperial siege of Stralsund.

Until the early 17th century, the Swedish navy was composed primarily of small to medium-sized ships with a single gundeck, normally armed with 12-pounder and smaller cannons; these ships were cheaper than larger ships and were well-suited for escort and patrol. They also suited the prevailing tactical thinking within the navy, which emphasised boarding as the decisive moment in a naval battle rather than gunnery. The king, who was a keen artillerist, saw the potential of ships as gun platforms, and large, heavily armed ships made a more dramatic statement in the political theater of naval power. Beginning with ''Vasa'', he ordered a series of ships with two full gundecks, outfitted with much heavier guns.&lt;ref&gt;Hocker (2011), p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; Five such ships were built after ''Vasa'' (''Äpplet'', ''Kronan'', ''Scepter'' and ''Göta Ark'') before the Privy Council cancelled the orders for the others after the king's death in 1632. These ships, especially ''Kronan'' and ''Scepter'', were much more successful and served as flagships in the Swedish navy until the 1660s. The second of the so-called ''regalskepp'' (usually translated as 'royal ships'),&lt;ref&gt;''Vasa'' was actually never referred to as a ''regalskepp'' before she was lost, but was classified as one afterwards; Hocker (2011), pp. 147–48.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Äpplet'' ('The Apple'; the Swedish term for the [[globus cruciger]]), was built simultaneously with ''Vasa''. The only significant difference between the design of ''Vasa'' and her sister ship was an increase in width of about a metre (3.1&amp;nbsp;ft).&lt;ref&gt;Hocker in Cederlund (2006), p. 39; for more on ''Äpplet'', see {{sv}} Jan Glete, "[https://www.webcitation.org/5hFXgHHMe?url=http://www.marinarkeologi.net/pdf/mt4-2002_16-21.pdf Gustav II Adolfs Äpplet]" in ''Marinarkeologisk tidskrift'' nr 4, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction ==
[[Image:Vasa Top Deck.jpg|thumb|left|''Vasa's'' [[Port (nautical)|port]] side]]

In the early 1620s, work at the Stockholm navy yard was led by a pair of Dutch-born entrepreneurs, Antonius Monier and master shipwright [[Henrik Hybertsson]], who was usually referred to as 'Master Henrik'. When a new contract for operation of the navy yard was negotiated in the winter of 1624–1625, Monier withdrew and Master Henrik took on a young merchant from Amsterdam, Arendt de Groote, as partner. On 16 January 1625, Henrik and Arendt signed a contract to build four ships, two larger with a [[keel]] length of 128 feet (38 m) and two smaller, with dimensions to match the earlier ship ''Gustavus''.

Master Henrik and Arendt de Groote began buying the raw materials needed for the first ships in 1625, purchasing timber from individual estates in Sweden as well as buying rough-sawn planking in [[Riga]], Königsberg (modern [[Kaliningrad]]), and [[Amsterdam]]. As they prepared to begin the first of the new ships in the autumn of 1625, Henrik corresponded with the king through the Vice Admiral Fleming about which ship to build first. The loss of ten ships in the Bay of Riga led the king to propose building two ships of a new, medium size as a quick compromise, and he sent a specification for this, a ship which would be 120 feet (35.6 m) long on the keel. Henrik declined, since he had already cut the timber for a large and a small ship. He laid the keel for a larger ship in late February or early March 1626.&lt;ref&gt;Hocker in Cederlund (2006), pp. 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt; Master Henrik never saw Vasa completed; he fell ill in late 1625, and by the summer of 1626 he had handed over supervision of the work in the yard to another Dutch shipwright, Henrik 'Hein' Jacobsson. He died in the spring of 1627, probably about the same time as the ship was launched.&lt;ref&gt;Hocker in Cederlund (2006), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of Henrik Hybertsson, the responsibility to manage the construct the ship was inherited by his widow [[Margareta Hybertsson]].

After launching, work continued on finishing the upper deck, the sterncastle, the [[beakhead]] and the rigging. Sweden had still not developed a sizeable sailcloth industry, and material had to be ordered from abroad. In the contract for the maintenance of rigging, French sailcloth was specified, but the cloth for the sails of ''Vasa'' most likely came from Holland.&lt;ref&gt;Hocker (2011), p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; The sails were made mostly of [[hemp]] and partly of [[flax]]. The rigging was made entirely of hemp imported from [[Latvia]] through Riga. The king visited the shipyard in January 1628 and made what was probably his only visit aboard the ship.&lt;ref&gt;Hocker in Cederlund (2006), pp. 47–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Vasas hull profile.jpg|thumb|upright|A model showing a cross section of ''Vasa''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s hull, illustrating the shallow [[hold (ship)|hold]] and two [[gun deck]]s]]

In the summer of 1628, the captain responsible for supervising construction of the ship, Söfring Hansson, arranged for the ship's stability to be demonstrated for the Vice Admiral responsible for procurement, Klas Fleming, who had recently arrived in Stockholm from Prussia. Thirty men ran back and forth across the upper deck to start the ship rolling, but the admiral stopped the test after they had made only three trips, as he feared the ship would capsize. According to testimony by the ship's master, Göran Mattson, Fleming remarked that he wished the king were at home. Gustavus Adolphus had been sending a steady stream of letters insisting that the ship put to sea as soon as possible.&lt;ref name="Vasa"&gt;Hocker in Cederlund (2006), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been much speculation about whether ''Vasa'' was lengthened during construction and whether an additional gun deck was added late during the build. Little evidence suggests that ''Vasa'' was substantially modified after the keel was laid. Ships contemporary to ''Vasa'' that were elongated were cut in half and new timbers spliced between the existing sections, making the addition readily identifiable, but no such addition can be identified in the hull, nor is there any evidence for any late additions of a second gundeck. The king ordered 72 24-pound cannons for the ship on 5 August 1626, and this was too many to fit on a single gun deck. Since the king's order was issued less than five months after construction started, it would have come early enough for the second deck to be included in the design. The French ''Galion du Guise'', the ship used as a model for ''Vasa'', according to Arendt de Groote, also had two gun decks.&lt;ref&gt;Hocker in Cederlund (2006), pp. 45–46.&lt;/ref&gt; [[3D scanner|Laser measurements]] of ''Vasa's'' structure conducted in 2007–2011 confirmed that no major changes were implemented during construction, but that the centre of gravity was too high.&lt;ref&gt;Hocker (2011), pp. 39–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Vasa'' was an early example of a warship with two full gun decks, and was built when the theoretical principles of shipbuilding were still poorly understood. There is no evidence that Henrik Hybertsson had ever built a ship like it before, and two gundecks is a much more complicated compromise in seaworthiness and firepower than a single gundeck. Safety margins at the time were also far below anything that would be acceptable today. Combined with the fact that 17th-century warships were built with intentionally high superstructures (to be used as firing platforms), this made ''Vasa'' a risky undertaking.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Hocker in Cederlund (2006), p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Armament ===
[[File:Vasa-lower gun deck-2.jpg|thumb|left|The inside of the lower gun deck looking toward the bow]]

''Vasa'' was built during a time of transition in naval tactics, from an era when boarding was still one of the primary ways of fighting enemy ships to an era of the strictly organised [[ship-of-the-line]] and a focus on victory through superior gunnery. ''Vasa'' was armed with powerful guns and built with a high stern, which would act as a firing platform in boarding actions for some of the 300 soldiers she was supposed to carry, but the high-sided hull and narrow upper deck were not optimised for boarding. She was neither the largest ship ever built, nor the one carrying the greatest number of guns. What made her arguably the most powerful warship of the time was the combined weight of shot that could be fired from the cannon of one side: 588 pounds (267&amp;nbsp;kg), excluding ''stormstycken'', guns used for firing anti-personnel ammunition instead of solid shot. This was the largest concentration of artillery in a single warship in the Baltic at the time, perhaps in all of northern Europe, and it was not until the 1630s that a ship with more firepower was built. This large amount of naval artillery was placed on a ship that was quite small relative to the armament carried. By comparison, ''[[USS Constitution]]'', a famous Napoleonic era frigate built 169 years after ''Vasa'', had roughly the same firepower, but was over 700&amp;nbsp;[[tonnes]] heavier.&lt;ref&gt;Hocker in Cederlund (2006), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Constitution'', however, belonged to a later era of naval warfare that employed the [[line of battle]]-tactic, where ships fought in single file (or ''line ahead'') while the group as a whole attempted to present the batteries of one side toward the enemy. The guns would be aimed in the same direction and fire could be concentrated on a single target. In the 17th century, tactics involving organised formations of large fleets had still not been developed. Rather, ships would fight individually or in small improvised groups, and focused on boarding. ''Vasa'', though possessing a formidable battery, was built with these tactics in mind, and therefore lacked a unified [[broadside]] with guns that were all aimed in roughly the same direction. Rather, the guns were intended to be fired independently and were arranged according to the curvature of the hull, meaning that the ship would be bristled with artillery in all directions, covering virtually all angles.&lt;ref&gt;The guns facing fight aft, the ''stern chasers'', were still not on board when the ship sank, however; Hocker (2011) pp. 58–59&lt;/ref&gt;

Naval gunnery in the 17th century was still in its infancy. Guns were expensive and had a much longer lifespan than any warship. Guns with a lifetime of over a century were not unheard of, while most warships would be used for only 15 to 20 years. In Sweden and many other European countries, a ship would normally not 'own' its guns, but would be issued armament from the armory for every campaign season. Ships were therefore usually fitted with guns of very diverse age and size. What allowed ''Vasa'' to carry so much firepower was not merely that an unusually large number of guns were crammed into a relatively small ship, but also that the 46 main 24-pounder guns were of a new and standardised lightweight design, cast in a single series at the state gun foundry in Stockholm, under the direction of the Swiss-born founder Medardus Gessus. Two additional 24-pounders, of a heavier and older design, were mounted in the bows, the so-called ''[[Chase gun|bow chasers]]''. Four more heavy guns were intended for the stern, but the cannon foundry could not cast guns as fast as the navy yard could build ships, and ''Vasa'' waited nearly a year after construction was finished for its armament. When the ship sailed in August 1628, eight of the planned armament of 72 guns had still not been delivered. All cannons during this time had to be made from individually made moulds that could not be reused, but ''Vasa's'' guns had such uniform precision in their manufacturing that their primary dimensions varied by only a few millimetres, and their bores were almost exactly 146&amp;nbsp;mm (5.7&amp;nbsp;in). The remaining armament of ''Vasa'' consisted of eight 3-pounders, six large caliber ''stormstycken'' (similar to what the English called [[howitzer]]s) for use during boarding actions, and two 1-pound [[falconet (cannon)|falconets]]. Also included on board were 894 kilograms (1,970&amp;nbsp;lb) of [[gunpowder]] and over 1,000 shot of various types for the guns.&lt;ref&gt;Hocker in Cederlund (2006), pp. 47–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ornamentation ===
[[Image:Vasa stern color model.jpg|thumb|A 1:10 scale model of the ship on display at the [[Vasa Museum]]. The sculptures are painted in what are believed to be the original colors.]]
As was the custom with warships at the time, ''Vasa'' was decorated with sculptures intended to glorify the authority, wisdom and martial prowess of the monarch and also to deride, taunt and intimidate the enemy. The sculptures made up a considerable part of the effort and cost of building the ship. The symbolism used in decorating the ship was mostly based on the [[Renaissance]] idealization of Roman and Greek antiquity, which had been imported from Italy through German and Dutch artists. Imagery borrowed from Mediterranean antiquity dominates the motifs, but also include figures from the Old Testament and even a few from [[ancient Egypt]]. Many of the figures are in Dutch [[grotesque]] style, depicting fantastic and frightening creatures, including mermaids, [[wild men]], sea monsters and [[Triton (mythology)|tritons]]. The decoration inside the ship is much sparser and is largely confined to the steerage and the great cabin, at the after end of the upper gundeck.

Residues of paint have been found on many sculptures and on other parts of the ship. The entire ornamentation was once painted in vivid colors. The sides of the [[beakhead]] (the protruding structure below the [[bowsprit]]), the bulwarks (the protective railing around the weather deck), the roofs of the [[quarter gallery|quarter galleries]], and the background of the [[Transom (nautical)|transom]] (the flat surface at the stern of the ship) were all painted red, while the sculptures were decorated in bright colors, and the dazzling effect of these was in some places emphasised with [[gold leaf]]. Previously, it was believed that the background color had been blue and that all sculptures had been almost entirely gilded, and this is reflected in many paintings of ''Vasa'' from the 1970s to the early 1990s, such as the lively and dramatic drawings of [[Björn Landström]] or the painting by Francis Smitheman.&lt;ref&gt;See sample from Smitheman's website here [http://www.smitheman.com/004-full.html].&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1990s, this view was revised and the colors are properly reflected in more recent reproductions of the ship's decoration by maritime painter [[Tim Thompson (artist)|Tim Thompson]] and the 1:10 scale model in the museum. ''Vasa'' is an example not so much of the heavily gilded sculptures of early [[Baroque]] art but rather 'the last gasps of the [[medieval art|medieval]] sculpture tradition' with its fondness for gaudy colors, in a style that today would be considered extravagant or even vulgar.&lt;ref name="Hocker in Vasa I, p. 47"/&gt;

[[File:Vasaskultpurrepliker.jpg|thumb|left|Modern replicas in the [[Vasa Museum]] of some of the ship's sculptures that have been painted in what are believed to be the original colors.]]
The sculptures are carved out of [[oak]], [[pine]] or [[Tilia|linden]], and many of the larger pieces, like the huge 3-metre (10&amp;nbsp;ft) long figurehead lion, consist of several parts carved individually and fitted together with bolts. Close to 500 sculptures, most of which are concentrated on the high stern and its galleries and on the beakhead, are found on the ship.&lt;ref&gt;Soop (1986), pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt; The figure of [[Hercules]] appears as a pair of pendants, one younger and one older, on each side of the lower stern galleries; the pendants depict opposite aspects of the ancient hero, who was extremely popular during antiquity as well as in 17th-century European art. On the transom are biblical and nationalistic symbols and images. A particularly popular motif is the lion, which can be found as the [[Mascaron (architecture)|mascarons]] originally fitted on the insides of the gunport doors, grasping the royal coat of arms on either side, the figurehead, and even clinging to the top of the rudder. Each side of the beakhead originally had 20 figures (though only 19 have actually been found) that depicted [[Roman emperor]]s from [[Tiberius]] to [[Septimius Severus]]. Overall, almost all heroic and positive imagery is directly or indirectly identified with the king and was originally intended to glorify him as a wise and powerful ruler. The only actual portrait of the king, however, is located at the very top of the transom in the stern. Here he is depicted as a young boy with long, flowing hair, being crowned by two [[griffin]]s representing the king's father, [[Charles IX of Sweden|Charles IX]].&lt;ref&gt;Before being crowned as king, Charles had been duke of [[Södermanland]], whose coat of arms include a griffin [[segreant]], standing with its front legs raised; Soop (1986), pp. 18–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Vasa color pigments.jpg|thumb|A recreation of the color pigments that were used by the naval shipyard where the ship was built; exhibit at the [[Vasa Museum]].]]
A team of at least six expert sculptors worked for a minimum of two years on the sculptures, most likely with the assistance of an unknown number of apprentices and assistants. No direct credit for any of the sculptures has been provided, but the distinct style of one of the most senior artists, Mårten Redtmer, is clearly identifiable. Other accomplished artists, like Hans Clausink, Johan Didrichson Tijsen (or ''Thessen'' in Swedish) and possibly Marcus Ledens, are known to have been employed for extensive work at the naval yards at the time ''Vasa'' was built, but their respective styles are not distinct enough to associate them directly with any specific sculptures.&lt;ref&gt;Soop (1986), pp. 241–253.&lt;/ref&gt;

The artistic quality of the sculptures varies considerably, and about four distinct styles can be identified. The only artist who has been positively associated with various sculptures is Mårten Redtmer, whose style has been described as 'powerful, lively and naturalistic'.&lt;ref&gt;Soop (1986), p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; He was responsible for a considerable number of the sculptures. These include some of the most important and prestigious pieces: the figurehead lion, the royal coat of arms, and the sculpture of the king at the top of the transom. Two of the other styles are described as 'elegant ... a little stereotyped and manneristic', and of a 'heavy, leisurely but nevertheless rich and lively style', respectively. The fourth and last style, deemed clearly inferior to the other three, is described as 'stiff and ungainly'&lt;ref&gt;Quotes from Soop (1986), p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; and was done by other carvers, perhaps even apprentices, of lesser skill.

== Maiden voyage ==
[[Image:Voyage of the Vasa 2.svg|thumb|Central [[Stockholm]] and the movements of ''Vasa'' from Skeppsgården ('navy yard') to the anchoring place near the old royal castle where it was fitted and armed in the spring of 1628, and finally the location where it foundered and sank.]]

On 10 August 1628, Captain Söfring Hansson ordered ''Vasa'' to depart on her maiden voyage to the naval station at [[Älvsnabben]]. The day was calm, and the only wind was a light breeze from the southwest. The ship was [[Warping (sailing)|warped]] (hauled by anchor) along the eastern waterfront of the city to the southern side of the harbor, where four sails were set, and the ship made way to the east. The gun ports were open, and the guns were out to fire a salute as the ship left Stockholm.&lt;ref name="Vasa"/&gt;

As ''Vasa'' passed under the [[Lee side|lee]] of the bluffs to the south (what is now [[Södermalm]]), a gust of wind filled her sails, and she [[Heel (sailing)|heeled]] suddenly to [[Port (nautical)|port]]. The [[Sheet (sailing)|sheets]] were cast off, and the ship slowly [[Metacentric height|righted herself]] as the gust passed. At Tegelviken, where there is a gap in the bluffs, an even stronger gust again forced the ship onto its port side, this time pushing the open lower gunports under the surface, allowing water to rush in onto the lower gundeck. The water building up on the deck quickly exceeded the ship's minimal ability to right itself, and water continued to pour in until it ran down into the hold; the ship quickly sank to a depth of 32&amp;nbsp;m (105&amp;nbsp;ft) only 120&amp;nbsp;m (390&amp;nbsp;ft) from shore. Survivors clung to debris or the upper masts, which were still above the surface, to save themselves, and many nearby boats rushed to their aid, but despite these efforts and the short distance to land, 30 people perished with the ship, according to reports. ''Vasa'' sank in full view of a crowd of hundreds, if not thousands, of mostly ordinary Stockholmers who had come to see the great ship set sail. The crowd included foreign ambassadors, in effect spies of Gustavus Adolphus' allies and enemies, who also witnessed the catastrophe.&lt;ref&gt;Hocker in Cederlund (2006), pp. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inquest ===
The Council sent a letter to the king the day after the loss, telling him of the sinking, but it took over two weeks to reach him in Poland. 'Imprudence and negligence' must have been the cause, he wrote angrily in his reply, demanding in no uncertain terms that the guilty parties be punished.&lt;ref name="kv2535"/&gt; Captain Söfring Hansson, who survived the disaster, was immediately taken for questioning. Under initial interrogation, he swore that the guns had been properly secured and that the crew was sober. A full inquest before a tribunal of members of the Privy Council and Admiralty took place at the [[Tre Kronor (castle)|Royal Palace]] on 5 September 1628. Each of the surviving officers was questioned as was the supervising shipwright and a number of expert witnesses. Also present at the inquest was the Admiral of the Realm, [[Carl Gyllenhielm|Carl Carlsson Gyllenhielm]]. The object of the inquest was as much or more to find a scapegoat as to find out why the ship had sunk. Whoever the committee might find guilty for the fiasco would face a severe penalty.&lt;ref name="kv2535"&gt;Kvarning (1998), pp. 25–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Surviving crew members were questioned one by one about the handling of the ship at the time of the disaster. Was it rigged properly for the wind? Was the crew sober? Was the ballast properly stowed? Were the guns properly secured? However, no-one was prepared to take the blame. Crewmen and contractors formed two camps; each tried to blame the other, and everyone swore he had done his duty without fault and it was during the inquest that the details of the stability demonstration were revealed.&lt;ref&gt;Kvarning (1998), pp. 29–35; Hocker in Cederlund (2006); pp. 55–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Next, attention was directed to the shipbuilders. 'Why did you build the ship so narrow, so badly and without enough bottom that it capsized?' the prosecutor asked the shipwright Jacobsson.&lt;ref name="Vasa_2"&gt;Hocker in Cederlund (2006), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Jacobsson stated that he built the ship as directed by Henrik Hybertsson (long since dead and buried), who in turn had followed the specification approved by the king. Jacobsson had in fact widened the ship by 1 foot 5 inches (c. 42&amp;nbsp;cm) after taking over responsibility for the construction, but construction of the ship was too far advanced to allow further widening.&lt;ref name="Vasa_2"/&gt;

In the end, no guilty party could be found. The answer Arendt de Groote gave when asked by the court why the ship sank was 'Only God knows'. Gustavus Adolphus had approved all measurements and armaments, and the ship was built according to the instructions and loaded with the number of guns specified. In the end, no-one was punished or found guilty for negligence, and the blame effectively fell on Henrik Hybertsson.&lt;ref&gt;Kvarning (1998), pp. 25–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Vasa'' as a wreck ==
[[Image:17th century salvaging.jpg|thumb|Illustration from a treatise on salvaging from 1734, showing the traditional method of raising a wreck with the help of [[anchor]]s and ships or [[hulk (ship)|hulks]] as [[Float (nautical)|pontoons]], basically the same method that was used to raise ''Vasa'' in the 20th century.]]

Less than three days after the disaster, a contract was signed for the ship to be raised. However, those efforts were unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="Hafström in Vasa I, p. 69"&gt;Hafström in Cederlund (2006), p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest attempts at raising ''Vasa'' by English engineer Ian Bulmer, resulted in righting the ship but also got it more securely stuck in the mud and was most likely one of the biggest impediments to the earliest attempts at recovery.&lt;ref name="Hafström in Vasa I, p. 69"/&gt; Salvaging technology in the early 17th century was much more primitive than today, but the recovery of ships used roughly the same principles as were used to raise ''Vasa'' more than 300 years later. Two ships or hulks were placed parallel to either side above the wreck, and ropes attached to several [[anchor]]s were sent down and hooked to the ship. The two hulks were filled with as much water as was safe, the ropes tightened, and the water pumped out. The sunken ship then rose with the ships on the surface and could be towed to shallower waters. The process was then repeated until the entire ship was successfully raised above water level. Even if the underwater weight of ''Vasa'' was not great, the mud in which it had settled made it sit more secure on the bottom and required considerable lifting power to overcome.&lt;ref&gt;Hafström in Cederlund (2006), pp. 98–104.&lt;/ref&gt; More than 30 years after the ship's sinking, in 1663–1665, Albreckt von Treileben and Andreas Peckell mounted an effort to recover the valuable guns. With a simple [[diving bell]], the team of Swedish and Finnish divers retrieved more than 50 of them.&lt;ref&gt;Hafström in Cederlund (2006), pp. 88–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such activity waned when it became clear that the ship could not be raised by the technology of the time. However, ''Vasa'' did not fall completely into obscurity after the recovery of the guns. The ship was mentioned in several histories of Sweden and the Swedish Navy, and the location of the wreck appeared on harbor charts of Stockholm in the 19th century. In 1844, the navy officer Anton Ludwig Fahnehjelm turned in a request for salvaging rights to the ship, claiming he had located it. Fahnehjelm was an inventor who designed an early form of light diving suit and had previously been involved in other salvage operations. There were dives made on the wreck in 1895–1896, and a commercial salvage company applied for a permit to raise or salvage the wreck in 1920, but this was turned down. In 1999, a witness also claimed that his father, a petty officer in the Swedish navy, had taken part in diving exercises on ''Vasa'' in the years before World War I.&lt;ref&gt;Cederlund in Cederlund (2006), pp. 142–143.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no evidence that anyone visited the wreck site after this until the beginning of the modern ''Vasa'' project.

=== Deterioration ===
[[File:Vasa-knightheads.jpg|thumb|left|Two of the knightheads, posts used to fasten ropes, on the weather deck. The details of carved heads have been eroded almost beyond recognition by the currents of [[Stockholms ström]].]]
In the 333 years that ''Vasa'' lay on the bottom of Stockholm harbor (called [[Stockholms ström]], 'the Stream', in Swedish), the ship and its contents were subject to several destructive forces, first among which were decomposition and erosion. Among the first things to decompose were the thousands of iron bolts that held the [[beakhead]] and much of the sterncastle together, and this included all of the ship's wooden sculptures. Almost all of the iron on the ship rusted away within a few years of the sinking, and only large objects, such as anchors, or items made of cast iron, such as cannonballs, survived. Organic materials fared better in the [[Hypoxia (environmental)#Aquatic hypoxia|anaerobic]] conditions, and so wood, cloth and leather are often in very good condition, but objects exposed to the currents were eroded by the sediment in the water, so that some are barely recognizable.&lt;ref name="Hocker pp. 153"&gt;Hocker &amp; Wendel in Cederlund (2006), pp. 153–170.&lt;/ref&gt; Objects which fell off the hull into the mud after the nails corroded through were well protected, so that many of the sculptures still retain areas of paint and gilding. Of the human remains, most of the soft tissue was quickly consumed by bacteria, fish and crustaceans, leaving only the bones, which were often held together only by clothing, although in one case, hair, nails and brain tissue survived.&lt;ref&gt;Hocker in Cederlund (2006), p. 146–152.&lt;/ref&gt;

The parts of the hull held together by joinery and wooden treenails remained intact for as much as two centuries, suffering gradual erosion of surfaces exposed to the water, unless they were disturbed by outside forces. 
Eventually the entire sterncastle, the high, aft portion of the ship that housed the officers' quarters and held up the transom, gradually collapsed into the mud with all the decorative sculptures. The [[quarter gallery|quarter galleries]], which were merely nailed to the sides of the sterncastle, collapsed fairly quickly and were found lying almost directly below their original locations.
&lt;ref name="Hocker pp. 153"/&gt;

Human activity was the most destructive factor, as the initial salvage efforts, the recovery of the guns, and the final salvage in the 20th century all left their marks. Peckell and Treileben broke up and removed much of the planking of the weather deck to get to the cannons on the decks below. Peckell reported that he had recovered 30 cartloads of wood from the ship; these might have included not just planking and structural details but also some of the sculptures which today are missing, such as the life-size Roman warrior near the bow and the sculpture of [[Septimius Severus]] that adorned the port side of the [[beakhead]].&lt;ref&gt;Hocker in Cederlund (2006), p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; Since ''Vasa'' lay in a busy shipping channel, ships occasionally dropped anchor over the ship, and one large anchor demolished most of the upper sterncastle, probably in the 19th century. Construction work in Stockholm harbor usually results in blasting of bedrock, and the resulting tonnes of rubble were often dumped in the harbor; some of this landed on the ship, causing further damage to the stern and the upper deck.&lt;ref&gt;Hocker in Cederlund (2006), pp. 151–152.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Vasa'' rediscovered ===
In the early 1950s, amateur [[archaeology|archaeologist]] [[Anders Franzén]] considered the possibility of recovering wrecks from the cold [[brackish]] waters of the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] because, he reasoned, they were free from the [[shipworm]] ''Teredo navalis'', which usually destroys submerged wood rapidly in warmer, saltier seas. Franzén had previously been successful in locating wrecks such as ''Riksäpplet'' and ''Lybska Svan'', and after long and tedious research he began looking for ''Vasa'' as well. He spent many years probing the waters without success around the many assumed locations of the wreckage. He did not succeed until, based on accounts of an unknown topographical anomaly just south of the Gustav V dock on [[Beckholmen]], he narrowed his search. In 1956, with a home-made, gravity-powered coring probe, he located a large wooden object almost parallel to the mouth of dock on Beckholmen. The location of the ship received considerable attention, even if the identification of the ship could not be determined without closer investigation. Soon after the announcement of the find, planning got underway to determine how to excavate and raise ''Vasa''. The [[Swedish Navy]] was involved from the start, as were various museums and the National Heritage board, representatives of which eventually formed the ''Vasa'' Committee, the predecessor of the ''Vasa'' Board.&lt;ref&gt;''Vasa I'', Cederlund and Hocker, pp. 172–180&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Zetterström nozzle1.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Zetterström nozzle]], designed to expel equal amounts of water both forwards and backwards for recoilless operation under water.]]

=== Recovery ===
A number of possible recovery methods were proposed, including filling the ship with ping-pong balls and freezing it in a block of ice, but the method chosen by the Vasa Board (which succeeded the Vasa Committee) was essentially the same one attempted immediately after the sinking. Divers spent two years digging six tunnels under the ship for steel cable slings, which were taken to a pair of lifting [[Pontoon (boat)|pontoons]] at the surface. The work under the ship was extremely dangerous, requiring the divers to cut tunnels through the clay with high-pressure water jets and suck up the resulting slurry with a dredge, all while working in total darkness with hundreds of tonnes of mud-filled ship overhead.&lt;ref&gt;Cederlund in Cederlund (2006), pp. 234–244.&lt;/ref&gt; A persisting risk was that the wreck could shift or settle deeper into the mud while a diver was working in a tunnel, trapping him underneath the wreckage. The almost vertical sections of the tunnels near the side of the hull could also potentially collapse and bury a diver inside.&lt;ref&gt;Cederlund in Cederlund (2006), p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the dangerous conditions, more than 1,300 dives were made in the [[Marine salvage|salvage]] operation without any serious accidents.&lt;ref&gt;Kvarning (1998), pp. 61–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each time the pontoons were pumped full, the cables tightened and the pontoons were pumped out, the ship was brought a metre closer to the surface. In a series of 18 lifts in August and September 1959, the ship was moved from depth of 32 metres (105&amp;nbsp;ft) to 16 metres (52&amp;nbsp;ft) in the more sheltered area of Kastellholmsviken, where divers could work more safely to prepare for the final lift.&lt;ref&gt;Kvarning (1998), p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of a year and a half, a small team of commercial divers cleared debris and mud from the upper decks to lighten the ship, and made the hull as watertight as possible. The gun ports were closed by means of temporary lids, a temporary replacement of the collapsed sterncastle was constructed, and many of the holes from the iron bolts that had rusted away were plugged. The final lift began on 8 April 1961, and on the morning of 24 April, ''Vasa'' was ready to return to the world for the first time in 333 years. Press from all over the world, television cameras, 400 invited guests on barges and boats, and thousands of spectators on shore watched as the first timbers broke the surface. The ship was then emptied of water and mud and towed to the Gustav V [[dry dock]] on Beckholmen, where the ship was floated on its own keel onto a concrete pontoon, on which the hull still stands.&lt;ref&gt;Cederlund in Cederlund (2006), pp. 285–290.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the end of 1961 to December 1988, ''Vasa'' was housed in a temporary facility called Wasavarvet ('The Vasa Shipyard'), which included exhibit space as well as the activities centred on the ship. A building was erected over the ship on its pontoon, but it was very cramped, making conservation work awkward. Visitors could view the ship from just two levels, and the maximum viewing distance was in most places only a couple of metres, which made it difficult for viewers to get an overall view of the ship. In 1981, the Swedish government decided that a permanent building was to be constructed, and a design competition was organised. The winning design, by the Swedish architects Månsson and Dahlbäck, called for a large hall over the ship in a polygonal, industrial style. Ground was broken in 1987, and ''Vasa'' was towed into the half-finished [[Vasa Museum]] in December 1988. The museum was officially opened to the public in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Kvarning (1998), pp. 163–173.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Archaeology ==
''Vasa'' posed an unprecedented challenge for archaeologists. Never before had a four-story structure, with most of its original contents largely undisturbed, been available for excavation.&lt;ref&gt;Cederlund &amp; Hocker in Cederlund (2006), p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt; The conditions under which the team had to work added to the difficulties. The ship had to be kept wet in order that it not dry out and crack before it could be properly conserved. Digging had to be performed under a constant drizzle of water and in a sludge-covered mud that could be more than one metre (approximately three feet) deep. In order to establish find locations, the hull was divided into several sections demarcated by the many structural beams, the decking and by a line drawn along the centre of the ship from stern to bow. For the most part, the decks were excavated individually, though at times work progressed on more than one deck level simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;Cederlund &amp; Hocker in Cederlund (2006), p. 300.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Finds ===
[[File:Brädspel - Vasamuseet - 25364.jpg|thumb|A [[Tables (board game)#Sweden|tables]] set found on ''Vasa'', complete with [[dice]] and markers]]
''Vasa'' had four preserved decks: the upper and lower gun decks, the hold and the [[Orlop deck|orlop]]. Because of the constraints of preparing the ship for conservation, the archaeologists had to work quickly, in 13-hour shifts during the first week of excavation. The upper gun deck was greatly disturbed by the various salvage projects between 1628 and 1961, and it contained not only material that had fallen down from the rigging and upper deck, but also more than three centuries of harbor refuse.&lt;ref&gt;Cederlund in Cederlund (2006), p. 315.&lt;/ref&gt; The decks below were progressively less disturbed. The gundecks contained not just gun carriages, the three surviving cannons, and other objects of a military nature, but were also where most of the personal possessions of the sailors had been stored at the time of the sinking. These included a wide range of loose finds, as well as chests and casks with spare clothing and shoes, tools and materials for mending, money (in the form of low-denomination copper coins), privately purchased provisions, and all of the everyday objects needed for life at sea. Most of the finds are of wood, testifying not only to the simple life on board, but to the generally unsophisticated state of Swedish material culture in the early 17th century. The lower decks were primarily used for storage, and so the hold was filled with barrels of provisions and gunpowder, coils of anchor cable, iron shot for the guns, and the personal possessions of some of the officers. On the orlop deck, a small compartment contained six of the ship's ten sails, rigging spares, and the working parts for the ship's pumps. Another compartment contained the possessions of the ship's carpenter, including a large tool chest.&lt;ref&gt;Cederlund &amp; Hocker in Cederlund (2006), pp. 302–305; for the item catalog, see [http://samlingar.maritima.se/marketstore/ this link] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016142656/http://samlingar.maritima.se/marketstore/ |date=16 October 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the ship itself had been salvaged and excavated, the site of the loss was excavated thoroughly during 1963–1967. This produced many items of rigging tackle as well as structural timbers that had fallen off, particularly from the beakhead and sterncastle. Most of the sculptures that had decorated the exterior of the hull were also found in the mud, along with the ship's anchors and the skeletons of at least four people. The last object to be brought up was the nearly 12-metre-long [[longboat]], called ''esping'' in Swedish, found lying parallel to the ship and believed to have been towed by ''Vasa'' when she sank.&lt;ref&gt;Cederlund in Cederlund (2006), pp. 470–472.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the more recent objects contaminating the site were disregarded when the finds were registered, but some were the remains of the 1660s salvage efforts and others had their own stories to tell. Among the best known of these was a statue of 20th-century Finnish runner [[Paavo Nurmi]], which was placed on the ship as a prank by students of [[Helsinki University of Technology]] the night before the final lift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Ilta-Sanomat]] |url=http://www.ttky.tut.fi/jaynat/nurmi.html |date=5 July 1961 |title=Vasan Veijarit |language=Finnish |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040713124028/http://www.ttky.tut.fi/jaynat/nurmi.html |archivedate=13 July 2004 |accessdate=8 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Yle]] |date=28 April 2011 |title=Teekkarien kuningasjäynästä puoli vuosisataa |url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/teekkarien_kuningasjaynasta_puoli_vuosisataa/5350123 |trans-title=Half a century of Techak's roar |language=Finnish |accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes of sinking ==
[[Image:Vasa Cohen 20006123a hr.jpg|thumb|Former Vasa Museum Director Jervon(left) explaining aspects of the sinking of the ship to then US Defense Secretary [[William Cohen]] (centre) and Swedish Defense Minister [[Björn von Sydow]] (right).]]
''Vasa'' sank because it had very little [[initial stability]], which can be thought of as resistance to heeling over under the force of wind or waves acting on the hull. The reason for this is that the distribution of mass in the hull structure and the ballast, guns, provisions, and other objects loaded on board puts too much weight too high in the ship. The [[center of gravity|centre of gravity]] is too high, and so it takes very little force to make the ship heel over, and there is not enough [[righting moment]], force trying to make the ship return to an upright position. The reason that the ship has such a high centre of gravity is not due to the guns. These weighed little over 60 tonnes, or about 5% of the total displacement of the loaded ship. This is relatively low weight and should be bearable in a ship this size. The problem is in the hull construction itself. The part of the hull above the waterline is too high and too heavily built in relation to the amount of hull in the water. The headroom in the decks is higher than necessary for crewmen who were, on average, only 1.67 metres (5 feet 5½ inches) tall, and thus the weight of the decks and the guns they carry is higher above the waterline than needed. In addition, the deck beams and their supporting timbers are over-dimensioned and too closely spaced for the loads they carry, so they contribute too much weight to the already tall and heavy upper works.&lt;ref&gt;Hocker (2011), pp. 132–134.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of different measuring systems on either side of the vessel caused its mass to be distributed asymmetrically, heavier to port. During construction both [[Swedish feet]] and [[Amsterdam feet]] were in use by different teams. Archaeologists have found four rulers used by the workmen who built the ship. Two were calibrated in Swedish feet, which had 12 inches, while the other two measured Amsterdam feet, which had 11 inches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pri.org/stories/2012-02-23/new-clues-emerge-centuries-old-swedish-shipwreck|title=New Clues Emerge in Centuries-Old Swedish Shipwreck|work=Public Radio International |date=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the mathematical tools for calculating or predicting stability were still more than a century in the future, and 17th-century scientific ideas about how ships behaved in water were deeply flawed, the people associated with building and sailing ships for the Swedish navy were very much aware of the forces at work and their relationships to each other. In the last part of the inquest held after the sinking, a group of master shipwrights and senior naval officers were asked for their opinions about why the ship sank. Their discussion and conclusions show very clearly that they knew what had happened, and their verdict was summed up very clearly by one of the captains, who said that the ship did not have enough 'belly' to carry the heavy upperworks.&lt;ref name="Hocker (2011) 135-137"&gt;Hocker (2011), pp. 135–137.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ship design was not yet a science, but was an empirical process based on experience rather than calculation. Balancing the military need for firepower against the maritime need for seaworthiness resulted in some compromises that would not pass modern standards for stability. A ship with two gundecks was an even more demanding proposition, as the lower tier of gunports had to be uncomfortably close to the water, and there was an unavoidably large amount of weight being carried above the waterline. One of the solutions which became common was graduated armament, in which the guns of the upper decks were progressively lighter. Such an armament, with 24-pounders on the lower gundeck and 12-pounders on the upper gundeck, was considered for ''Vasa'' in 1627, but eventually the armament plan reverted to the king's original desire of 24-pounders on both decks. ''Vasa''{{'}}s sister ship, ''Äpplet'', had her upper gundeck 24-pounders changed for 12-pounders early in her career, probably in attempt to improve her stability.

''Vasa'' might not have sunk on 10 August 1628, if the ship had been sailed with the gunports closed. Ships with multiple tiers of gunports normally had to sail with the lowest tier closed, since the pressure of wind in the sails would usually push the hull over until the lower gunport sills were under water. For this reason, the gunport lids are made with a double lip which is designed to seal well enough to keep out most of the water. Captain Söfring Hansson had ordered the lower gundeck ports closed once the ship began to take on water, but by then it was too late. If he had done it before he sailed, ''Vasa'' might not have sunk on that day.&lt;ref name="Hocker (2011) 135-137"/&gt;

== Conservation ==
[[Image:Vasa 1963.jpg|thumb|upright|''Vasa'' during the early stages of conservation at the Wasa Shipyard.]]
Although ''Vasa'' was in surprisingly good condition after 333 years at the bottom of the sea, it would have quickly deteriorated if the hull had been simply allowed to dry. The large bulk of ''Vasa'', over 600 cubic metres (21,000 cu ft) of oak timber, constituted an unprecedented conservation problem. After some debate on how to best preserve the ship, conservation was carried out by impregnation with [[polyethylene glycol]] (PEG), a method that has since become the standard treatment for large, waterlogged wooden objects, such as the 16th-century English ship ''[[Mary Rose]]''. ''Vasa'' was sprayed with PEG for 17 years, followed by a long period of slow drying, which is not yet entirely complete.&lt;ref&gt;Hocker (2011), pp. 192–193.&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason that ''Vasa'' was so well-preserved was not just that the [[shipworm]] that normally devours wooden ships was absent but also that the water of [[Stockholms ström]] was heavily polluted until the late 20th century. The highly toxic and hostile environment meant that even the toughest microorganisms that break down wood had difficulty surviving. This, along with the fact that ''Vasa'' had been newly built and was undamaged when she sank, contributed to her conservation. Unfortunately, the properties of the water also had a negative effect. Chemicals present in the water around ''Vasa'' had penetrated the wood, and the timber was full of the corrosion products from the bolts and other iron objects which had disappeared. Once the ship was exposed to the air, reactions began inside the timber that produced acidic compounds. In the late 1990s, spots of white and yellow residue were noticed on ''Vasa'' and some of the associated artefacts. These turned out to be [[sulfate]]-containing salts that had formed on the surface of the wood when [[sulfides]] reacted with atmospheric oxygen. The salts on the surface of ''Vasa'' and objects found in and around it are not a threat themselves (even if the discolouring may be distracting), but if they are from inside the wood, they may expand and crack the timber from inside. As of 2002, the amount of sulfuric acid in ''Vasa'''s hull was estimated to be more than 2 tonnes, and more is continually being created. Enough sulfides are present in the ship to produce another 5,000 kilograms (11,000&amp;nbsp;lb) of acid at a rate of about 100 kilograms (220&amp;nbsp;lb) per year; this might eventually destroy the ship almost entirely.&lt;ref&gt;Dal &amp; Hall Roth (2002), pp. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

While most of the scientific community considers that the destructive substance responsible for ''Vasa'''s long-term decay is sulfuric acid, Ulla Westermark, professor of wood technology at [[Luleå University of Technology]], has proposed another mechanism with her colleague Börje Stenberg. Experiments done by Japanese researchers show that treating wood with [[Polyethylene glycol|PEG]] in an acidic environment can generate [[formic acid]] and eventually liquify the wood. ''Vasa'' was exposed to acidic water for more than three centuries, and therefore has a relatively low pH. Samples taken from the ship indicate that formic acid is present, and that it could be one of the multiple causes of a suddenly accelerated rate of decomposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{sv}} [[Gothenburg University]] TV, ''[http://gupea.ub.gu.se:8080/dspace/handle/2077/6331?mode=full Vetenskapslandet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430060203/http://gupea.ub.gu.se:8080/dspace/handle/2077/6331?mode=full |date=30 April 2009 }}''.

[[Image:Vasa above bow1.jpg|thumb|The preserved ''Vasa'' in the main hall of [[Vasa Museum]] seen from above the bow.]]
The museum is constantly monitoring the ship for damage caused by decay or warping of the wood. Ongoing research seeks the best way to preserve the ship for future generations and to analyze the existing material as closely as possible. A current problem is that the old [[oak]] of which the ship is built has lost a substantial amount of its original strength and the cradle that supports the ship does not match up very well with the distribution of weight and stress in the hull. 'The amount of movement in the hull is worrying. If nothing is done, the ship will most likely capsize again', states Magnus Olofson from the ''Vasa'' Museum. An effort to secure ''Vasa'' for the future is under way, in cooperation with the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] and other institutions around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{sv icon}} Dahlquist, Hans.

To deal with the problem of the inevitable deterioration of the ship, the main hall of the ''Vasa'' Museum is kept at a temperature of {{convert|18|–|20|C|F}} and a humidity level of 53%. To slow the destruction by acidic compounds, different methods have been tried. Small objects have been sealed in plastic containers filled with an inert atmosphere of [[nitrogen]] gas, for halting further reactions between sulfides and oxygen. The ship itself has been treated with cloth saturated in a [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] liquid to neutralise the low pH, but this is only a temporary solution as acid is continuously produced. The original bolts rusted away after the ship sank but were replaced with modern ones that were [[galvanization|galvanised]] and covered with [[epoxy]] resin. Despite this, the newer bolts also started to rust and were releasing iron into the wood, which accelerated the deterioration.&lt;ref&gt;Dal &amp; Hall Roth, pp. 39–41; Sandstrom, M., Jalilehvand, F., Persson, I., Gelius, U., Frank, P., Hall Roth, I.

== Legacy ==
''Vasa'' has become a popular and widely recognised symbol for a historical narrative about the Swedish ''stormaktstiden'' ('the Great Power-period') in the 17th century, and about the early development of a European [[nation state]]. Within the disciplines of history and [[maritime archaeology]] the wrecks of large warships from the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries have received particularly widespread attention as perceived symbols of a past greatness of the state of Sweden. Among these wrecks, ''Vasa'' is the single best known example, and has also become recognised internationally, not least through a deliberate use of the ship as a symbol for marketing Sweden abroad. The name ''Vasa'' has in Sweden become synonymous with sunken vessels that are considered to be of great historical importance, and these are usually described, explained and valued in relation to ''Vasa'' itself.&lt;ref&gt;Cederlund (1997), s. 38&lt;/ref&gt; The Swedish maritime archaeologist Carl-Olof Cederlund, who has been active in the various ''Vasa''-projects, has described the phenomenon as ''regalskepps-syndromet'', 'the royal ship syndrome' (after the term used in the 17th century for the largest warships in the Swedish navy). He associates the 'syndrome' to a nationalist aspect of the [[history of ideas]] and traditional perceptions about hero-kings and glory through war. The focus of this historical theory lies on the 'great periods' in 'our [Swedish] history' and shares many similarities with the nationalist views of the [[Viking era]] in the Nordic countries and the praising of Greek and Roman [[Classical Antiquity|Antiquity]] in the Western world in general.&lt;ref&gt;Cederlund (1997), s. 38–40&lt;/ref&gt; Cederlund has stressed the ritualised aspects of the widely publicised salvage in 1961 and has compared the modern Vasa Museum with 'a temple in the Classical sense of the word'. The placement of the museum on Djurgården, traditional crown property, and its focus on 'the King's ship' has led him to suggest a description of it as 'The Temple of the Royal Ship'.&lt;ref&gt;Cederlund (1997), s. 15; original quotes: "''ett tempel i klassisk bemärkelse''"; "''Det Kungliga Skeppets Tempel''".&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Literature and popular culture ===
[[Image:Vasa merchandise.jpg|thumb|Merchandise and books based on ''Vasa'' on sale at the Vasa Museum gift shop.]]
''Vasa'' has been the subject of hundreds of books, articles and papers on topics ranging from marine archaeology to culinary history. Three children's books about ''Vasa'' have been written in Swedish and later translated into English, German, Danish, and Norwegian: ''The Vasa Saga'' by [[Bertil Almqvist]], ''The Vasa Sets Sail'' by Mats Wahl (illustrated by [[Sven Nordqvist]]), and ''The Vasa Piglet'' by Björn Bergenholtz.

''Vasa's'' unique status has drawn considerable attention and captured the imagination of more than two generations of scholars, tourists, model builders, and authors. Though historically unfounded, the popular perception of the building of the ship as a botched and disorganised affair (dubbed 'the [[Vasa syndrome|''Vasa''-syndrome]]') has been used by many authors of management literature as an educational example of how not to organise a successful business.&lt;ref&gt;For example this article from [[IEEE]] computing: Richard E. Fairley, Mary Jane Willshire, "Why the Vasa Sank: 10 Problems and Some Antidotes for Software Projects," ''[[IEEE Software]]'' vol. 20, no. 2, pp. 18–25, March/April 2003; see also Hocker in Cederlund (2006), p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Tender Ship'', [[Manhattan Project]] engineer [[Arthur Squires]] used the ''Vasa'' story as an opening illustration of his thesis that governments are usually incompetent managers of technology projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Tender Ship: Governmental Management of Technological Change|last=Squires|first=Arthur M. |publisher=Birkhäuser|year=1986|location=Boston|pages=1-3 |isbn=081763312X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vasa on Lake Ashi.jpg|thumb|The Japanese sightseeing ship on [[Lake Ashi]] inspired by ''Vasa''.]]
The Vasa Museum has co-sponsored two versions of a documentary about the history and recovery of the ship, both by documentary filmmaker [[Anders Wahlgren]]. The second version is currently shown in the museum and has been released on VHS and DVD with narration in 16 languages. In late 2011, a third ''Vasa''-film premiered on Swedish television, with a longer running time and a considerably larger budget (with over 7.5&amp;nbsp;million kronor provided by [[Sveriges Television|SVT]]).&lt;ref&gt;Hellekant, Johan, "[http://www.svd.se/kultur/historisk-film-kampar-i-motvind_6309568.svd Historisk film kämpar i motvind]" ''[[Svenska Dagbladet]]'', 10 July 2011; Linder, Lars, "[http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/filmrecensioner/vasa-1628 Vasa 1628]" ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]'', 27 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; An educational computer game, now in its second generation, has been made and is used in the museum and on its website to explain the fundamentals of 17th century ship construction and stability. Several mass-produced model kits and countless custom-built models of the ship have been made. In 1991, a 308-tonne [[pastiche]] reproduction of the ship was built in Tokyo to serve as a 650-passenger sightseeing ship. ''Vasa'' has inspired many works of art, including a gilded Disney-themed parody of the [[pilaster]] sculptures on the ship's quarter galleries.&lt;ref&gt;''Modellen: Vasamodeller från när och fjärran''.&lt;/ref&gt; Being a popular tourist attraction, ''Vasa'' is used as a motif for various souvenir products such as T-shirts, mugs, refrigerator magnets, and posters. Commercially produced replicas—such as drinking glasses, plates, spoons, and even a [[backgammon]] game—have been made from many of the objects belonging to the crew or officers found on the ship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vasamuseet.se/InEnglish/Visit/museumshop/repliker.aspx Vasa Museum homepage].

'''Web archiving''' is the process of collecting portions of the [[World Wide Web]] to ensure the information is [[digital preservation|preserved]] in an [[archive]] for future researchers, historians, and the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Decay of References to Web sites in Articles Published in General Medical Journals: Mainstream vs Small Journals|url = http://www.schattauer.de/index.php?id=1214&amp;doi=10.4338/ACI-2013-07-RA-0055|journal = Applied Clinical Informatics|date = 2013-01-01|volume = 4|issue = 4|doi = 10.4338/aci-2013-07-ra-0055|first = P.|last = Habibzadeh|first2 = Schattauer GmbH – Publishers for Medicine and Natural|last2 = Sciences|pmc = 3885908}}&lt;/ref&gt; Web archivists typically employ [[web crawler]]s for automated capture due to the massive size and amount of information on the Web.  The largest web archiving organization based on a bulk crawling approach is the [[Internet Archive]] which strives to maintain an archive of the entire Web. 

The International Web Archiving Workshop (IWAW), begun in 2001, has provided a platform to share experiences and exchange ideas. The later founding of the [[International Internet Preservation Consortium|International Internet Preservation Consortium (IIPC)]], in 2003, has greatly facilitated international collaboration in developing standards and open source tools for the creation of web archives. These developments, and the growing portion of human culture created and recorded on the web, combine to make it inevitable that more and more libraries and archives will have to face the challenges of web archiving.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:25658314|title=Truman, Gail. 2016. Web Archiving Environmental Scan. Harvard Library Report|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[National library|National libraries]], [[national archive]]s and various consortia of organizations are also involved in archiving culturally important Web content. 

Commercial web archiving software and services are also available to organizations who need to archive their own web content for corporate heritage, regulatory, or legal purposes.

==Provenance and development==

Early practice of web archiving involved the highlighting of a "site of the week award" as a record for the contest. Besides that, another early practice was the professional link list (for example [[Amnesty International]]'s list of human rights groups) and ([https://www.yahoo.com Yahoo!]) directory and Open Directory Project.

In the mid-1990s, one of the more important listing sites of its kind continually updated an index of worthwhile website destinations organized by content category.

In 1998, Yahoo directory was considered to have made a significant contribution to emerging online library science, not only by its classification scheme but also by the means of the content "navigation" it developed.

Soliciting, evaluating, and categorizing websites – the large-scale collecting, hand-sorting, and display of websites – could be considered an original form of website analysis. The rise of the algorithmic search engine has largely led to the disappearance of such manual methods.

==Collecting the web==
Web archivists generally archive various types of web content including [[HTML]] web pages, [[style sheet (web development)|style sheets]], [[JavaScript]], [[digital image|images]], and [[digital video|video]]. They also archive [[metadata]] about the collected resources such as access time, [[MIME type]], and content length.  This metadata is useful in establishing [[Authentication|authenticity]] and [[provenance]] of the archived collection.

==Methods of collection==
{{see also|List of Web archiving initiatives}}

===Remote harvesting===
The most common web archiving technique uses [[web crawler]]s to automate the process of collecting [[web page]]s.  Web crawlers typically access web pages in the same manner that users with a browser see the Web, and therefore provide a comparatively simple method of remote harvesting web content. Examples of web crawlers used for web archiving include:
* [[Heritrix]]
* [[HTTrack]]
* [[Wget]]

There exist various free services which may be used to archive web resources "on-demand", using web crawling techniques. These services include the [[Wayback Machine]] and [[WebCite]].

===Database archiving===
Database archiving refers to methods for archiving the underlying content of database-driven websites. It typically requires the extraction of the [[database]] content into a standard [[logical schema|schema]], often using [[XML]]. Once stored in that standard format, the archived content of multiple databases can then be made available using a single access system. This approach is exemplified by the [http://deeparc.sourceforge.net/ DeepArc] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20110227202744/http://www.nla.gov.au/xinq/ Xinq] tools developed by the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] and the [[National Library of Australia]] respectively. DeepArc enables the structure of a [[relational database]] to be mapped to an [[XML schema]], and the content exported into an XML document. Xinq then allows that content to be delivered online. Although the original layout and behavior of the website cannot be preserved exactly, Xinq does allow the basic querying and retrieval functionality to be replicated.

===Transactional archiving===
Transactional archiving is an event-driven approach, which collects the actual transactions which take place between a [[web server]] and a [[web browser]]. It is primarily used as a means of preserving evidence of the content which was actually viewed on a particular [[website]], on a given date. This may be particularly important for organizations which need to comply with legal or regulatory requirements for disclosing and retaining information.

A transactional archiving system typically operates by intercepting every [[HTTP]] request to, and response from, the web server, filtering each response to eliminate duplicate content, and permanently storing the responses as bitstreams.

==Difficulties and limitations==

===Crawlers===
Web archives which rely on web crawling as their primary means of collecting the Web are influenced by the difficulties of web crawling:
* The [[robots exclusion protocol]] may request crawlers not access portions of a website.  Some web archivists may ignore the request and crawl those portions anyway.
* Large portions of a web site may be hidden in the [[Deep Web (search indexing)|Deep Web]].  For example, the results page behind a web form can lie in the Deep Web if crawlers cannot follow a link to the results page.
* [[Crawler trap]]s (e.g., calendars) may cause a crawler to download an infinite number of pages, so crawlers are usually configured to limit the number of dynamic pages they crawl.

However, it is important to note that a native format web archive, i.e., a fully browsable web archive, with working links, media, etc., is only really possible using crawler technology.

The Web is so large that crawling a significant portion of it takes a large amount of technical resources.  The Web is changing so fast that portions of a website may change before a crawler has even finished crawling it.

===General limitations===
Some web servers are configured to return different pages to web archiver requests than they would in response to regular browser requests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Are current archiving systems reliable enough?|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00192-015-2805-7|journal = International Urogynecology Journal|date = 2015-07-30|issn = 0937-3462|pages = 1-1|doi = 10.1007/s00192-015-2805-7|first = Parham|last = Habibzadeh}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is typically done to fool search engines into directing more user traffic to a website, and is often done to avoid accountability, or to provide enhanced content only to those browsers that can display it.

Not only must web archivists deal with the technical challenges of web archiving, they must also contend with intellectual property laws.  Peter Lyman&lt;ref&gt;Lyman (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; states that "although the Web is popularly regarded as a [[public domain]] resource, it is [[copyright]]ed; thus, archivists have no legal right to copy the Web". However [[national library|national libraries]] in some countries &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://netpreserve.org/legal-deposit|title=Legal Deposit {{!}} IIPC|website=netpreserve.org|language=en|access-date=2017-01-31|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316103200/http://netpreserve.org/legal-deposit|archivedate=2017-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have a legal right to copy portions of the web under an extension of a [[legal deposit]].

Some private non-profit web archives that are made publicly accessible like [[WebCite]], the [[Internet Archive]] or the [[Internet Memory Foundation]] allow content owners to hide or remove archived content that they do not want the public to have access to. Other web archives are only accessible from certain locations or have regulated usage. WebCite cites  a recent lawsuit against Google's caching, which [[Google]] won.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.webcitation.org/faq |title=WebCite FAQ |work=Webcitation.org |author= |date= |accessdate=September 20, 2018}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aspects of web curation==
Web curation, like any digital curation, entails:

* Certification of the trustworthiness and integrity of the collection content
* Collecting verifiable Web assets
* Providing Web asset search and retrieval
* Semantic and ontological continuity and comparability of the collection content

Thus, besides the discussion on methods of collecting the Web, those of providing access, certification, and organizing must be included. There are a set of popular tools that addresses these curation steps:

A suite of tools for Web Curation by [[International Internet Preservation Consortium]]:
* [[Heritrix]] – collecting Web asset
* [[NutchWAX]] – search Web archive collections
* [[Open source Wayback Machine]] – search and navigate Web archive collections using NutchWax
* [[International Internet Preservation Consortium#Web Curator Tool|Web Curator Tool]] – Selection and Management of Web Collection&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webcurator.sourceforge.net/manuals.shtml |title=Web Curator Tool |publisher=Webcurator.sourceforge.net |date= |accessdate=2011-12-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104051655/http://webcurator.sourceforge.net/manuals.shtml |archivedate=2011-11-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other open source tools for manipulating web archives:
* [[WARC Tools]] – for creating, reading, parsing and manipulating, [[Web ARChive|WARC]] archives programmatically
* Google Search Tools – for indexing and searching full-text and metadata within web archives{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Free but not open source tools also exist:

Initially serving imperial, private, civic, and religious patronage, Western painting later found audiences in the [[aristocracy]] and the middle class. From the [[Middle Ages]] through the [[Renaissance]] painters worked for the church and a wealthy aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/rr17bb/patronage.html&amp;date=2009-10-26+01:52:16 Discussion of the role of patrons in the Renaissance], retrieved 11 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with the [[Baroque]] era artists received private commissions from a more educated and prosperous middle class.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/artistic-patronage History 1450–1789: Artistic Patronage], retrieved 11 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea of "[[art for art's sake]]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9125149/art-for-arts-sake Britannica.com], retrieved 11 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; began to find expression in the work of the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] painters like [[Francisco de Goya]], [[John Constable]], and [[J.

Western painting reached its zenith in Europe during the Renaissance, in conjunction with the refinement of drawing, use of [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]], ambitious architecture, [[tapestry]], [[stained glass]], sculpture, and the period before and after the advent of the [[printing press]].&lt;ref&gt;Meggs, Philip B.

The [[history of painting]] reaches back in time to artifacts from pre-historic artists, and spans all cultures. The oldest known paintings are at the [[Grotte Chauvet]] in France, claimed by some historians to be about 32,000 years old. They are engraved and painted using [[red ochre]] and black pigment and show horses, rhinoceros, lions, buffalo, mammoth, or humans often hunting. There are examples of [[cave painting]]s all over the world—in France, India, Spain, Portugal, China, Australia etc. There are many common themes throughout the different places that the paintings have been found; implying the universality of purpose and similarity of the impulses that might have inspired the artists to create the imagery. Various conjectures have been made as to the meaning these paintings had to the artists who made them. Prehistoric men may have painted animals to "catch" their [[soul]] or [[spirit]] in order to hunt them more easily, or the paintings may represent an [[animism|animistic]] vision and homage to surrounding [[nature]], or they may be the result of a basic need of [[Emotional expression|expression]] that is [[essence|innate]] to human beings, or they may be recordings of the life experiences of the artists and related stories from the members of their circle.

[[Ancient Egypt]], a civilization with strong traditions of architecture and sculpture (both originally painted in bright colors), had many mural paintings in temples and buildings, and painted illustrations on [[papyrus]] [[manuscript]]s.  Egyptian wall painting and decorative painting is often graphic, sometimes more symbolic than realistic. Egyptian painting depicts figures in bold outline and flat [[silhouette]], in which symmetry is a constant characteristic. [[Art of ancient Egypt|Egyptian painting]] has close connection with its written language—called [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]].  Painted symbols are found amongst the first forms of written language. The Egyptians also painted on [[linen]], remnants of which survive today.
Ancient Egyptian paintings survived due to the extremely dry climate. The ancient Egyptians created paintings to make the [[afterlife]] of the deceased a pleasant place. The themes included journey through the afterworld or their protective deities introducing the dead to the gods of the underworld. Some examples of such paintings are paintings of the gods and goddesses [[Ra]], [[Horus]], [[Anubis]], [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]], [[Osiris]] and [[Isis]]. Some tomb paintings show activities that the deceased were involved in when they were alive and wished to carry on doing for eternity. In the [[New Kingdom]] and later, the [[Book of the Dead]] was buried with the entombed person. It was considered important for an introduction to the afterlife.

To the north of [[Egypt]] was the [[Minoan civilization]] on the island of [[Crete]]. The wall paintings found in the palace of [[Knossos]] are similar to those of the [[Egyptians]] but much more free in style.
[[File:Hades and Persephone, Vergina.jpg|thumb|400px|A fresco showing [[Hades]] and [[Persephone]] riding in a [[chariot]], from the tomb of Queen [[Eurydice I of Macedon]] at [[Vergina]], Greece, 4th century BC]]

Around 1100 BC, tribes from the north of Greece conquered Greece and its art took a new direction. The culture of [[ancient Greece]] is noteworthy for its outstanding contributions to the visual arts. Painting on [[pottery of ancient Greece]] and [[ceramic]]s gives a particularly informative glimpse into the way society in ancient Greece functioned. Many fine examples of [[black-figure vase painting]] and [[red-figure vase painting]] still exist. Some famous Greek painters who worked on wood panels and are mentioned in texts are [[Apelles]], [[Zeuxis]] and [[Parrhasius (painter)|Parrhasius]]; however, with the single exception of the [[Pitsa panels]], no examples of ancient Greek panel painting survive, only written descriptions by their contemporaries or later Romans.  Zeuxis lived in the 5th century BC and was said to be the first to use [[sfumato]]. According to [[Pliny the Elder]], the realism of his paintings was such that birds tried to eat the painted grapes.  Apelles is described as the greatest painter of [[classical antiquity|antiquity]], and is noted for perfect technique in drawing, brilliant color, and modeling.

[[Roman art]] was influenced by Greece and can in part be taken as a descendant of ancient Greek painting. However, Roman painting does have important unique characteristics. Surviving Roman paintings include wall paintings and [[fresco]]es, many from villas in [[Campania]], in Southern Italy at sites such as [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]]. Such painting can be grouped into 4 main "styles" or periods&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.art-and-archaeology.com/roman/painting.html |title=Roman Painting |publisher=art-and-archaeology.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may contain the first examples of [[trompe-l'œil]], pseudo-perspective, and pure landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accd.edu/sac/vat/arthistory/arts1303/Rome4.htm |title=Roman Wall Painting |publisher=accd.edu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319123717/http://www.accd.edu/sac/vat/arthistory/arts1303/Rome4.htm |archivedate=19 March 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost the only painted portraits surviving from the ancient world are a large number of [[Fayum mummy portraits|coffin-portraits]] of bust form found in the [[Late Antique]] cemetery of [[Al-Fayum]]. Although these were neither of the best period nor the highest quality, they are impressive in themselves, and give an idea of the quality that the finest ancient work must have had. A very small number of [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] from Late Antique illustrated books also survive, and a rather larger number of copies of them from the Early Medieval period.

The rise of Christianity imparted a different spirit and aim to painting styles. [[Byzantine art]], once its style was established by the 6th century, placed great emphasis on retaining traditional [[iconography]] and style, and gradually evolved during the thousand years of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the living traditions of Greek and Russian [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] [[icon]]-painting.  Byzantine painting has a hieratic feeling and icons were and still are seen as a representation of divine revelation.  There were many [[fresco]]s, but fewer of these have survived than [[mosaic]]s.
Byzantine art has been compared to contemporary [[abstraction]], in its flatness and highly stylised depictions of figures and landscape.  Some periods of Byzantine art, especially the so-called [[Macedonian art (Byzantine)|Macedonian art]] of around the 10th century, are more flexible in approach. Frescos of the Palaeologian Renaissance of the early 14th century survive in the [[Chora Church]] in Istanbul.
[[File:Giotto di Bondone - No. 18 Scenes from the Life of Christ - 2. Adoration of the Magi - WGA09195.jpg|thumb|[[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]]]]

In post-Antique Catholic Europe the first distinctive artistic style to emerge that included painting was the [[Insular art]] of the British Isles, where the only surviving examples are miniatures in [[Illuminated manuscript]]s such as the [[Book of Kells]].&lt;ref&gt;Putnam A.M., Geo. Haven. Books and Their Makers During The Middle Ages. Vol. 1. New York: Hillary House, 1962. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  These are most famous for their abstract decoration, although figures, and sometimes scenes, were also depicted, especially in [[Evangelist portrait]]s. [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] and [[Ottonian art]] also survives mostly in manuscripts, although some wall-painting remain, and more are documented.  The art of this period combines Insular and "barbarian" influences with a strong Byzantine influence and an aspiration to recover classical monumentality and poise.

Walls of [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic art|Gothic]] churches were decorated with [[fresco]]es as well as sculpture and many of the few remaining [[mural]]s have great intensity, and combine the decorative energy of Insular art with a new monumentality in the treatment of figures. Far more miniatures in [[Illuminated manuscript]]s survive from the period, showing the same characteristics, which continue into the [[Gothic art|Gothic period]].

Panel painting becomes more common during the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] period, under the heavy influence of Byzantine icons.  Towards the middle of the 13th century, [[Medieval art]] and [[Gothic painting]] became more realistic, with the beginnings of interest in the depiction of volume and perspective in Italy with [[Cimabue]] and then his pupil [[Giotto]].  From Giotto on, the treatment of composition by the best painters also became much more free and innovative.  They are considered to be the two great medieval masters of painting in western culture. Cimabue, within the Byzantine tradition, used a more realistic and dramatic approach to his art. His pupil, Giotto, took these innovations to a higher level which in turn set the foundations for the western painting tradition. Both artists were pioneers in the move towards naturalism.

Churches were built with more and more windows and the use of colorful [[stained glass]] become a staple in decoration. One of the most famous examples of this is found in the cathedral of [[Notre Dame de Paris]]. By the 14th century Western societies were both richer and more cultivated and painters found new patrons in the nobility and even the [[bourgeoisie]]. Illuminated manuscripts took on a new character and slim, fashionably dressed court women were shown in their landscapes. This style soon became known as [[International Gothic]] style and was dominant from 1375–1425 with and [[tempera]] panel paintings and altarpieces gaining importance.

The Renaissance (French for 'rebirth'), a cultural movement roughly spanning the 14th through the mid-17th century, was driven by [[Renaissance humanism]] and the study of classical sources. In painting, in the 1420s and 1430s leading painters in Italy and the [[Low Countries]] separately developed new ways of painting which allowed the paintings to appear more realistic than in the works of established painters, whose style is referred to as [[International Gothic]], or in some cases as Proto-Renaissance (mainly in Italy).  This period, lasting until about 1495, became known as the [[Early Renaissance]].  

In the Flanders area of the Low Countries, following developments made in the [[illuminated manuscript|illumination of manuscripts]], especially by the [[Limbourg Brothers]], who died in 1416, artists became fascinated by the tangible in the visible world and began representing objects in an extremely naturalistic way.&lt;ref name="Gardner et al"&gt;Gardner, H., Kleiner, F. S., &amp; Mamiya, C. J. (2006). Gardner's art through the ages: the Western perspective. Belmont, CA, Thomson Wadsworth: 430–437&lt;/ref&gt; The adoption of [[oil painting]] whose first use on [[panel painting]]s was traditionally, but erroneously, credited to [[Jan van Eyck]], made possible a new [[verisimilitude]] in depicting this naturalism. The medium of oil paint was already present in the work of [[Melchior Broederlam]] (who died in 1409), but [[Robert Campin]] (previously known as [[the Master of Flémalle]]) and van Eyck brought its use to new heights and employed it to represent the naturalism for which they were aiming. With this new medium, the painters of this period were capable of creating richer colors with a deep intense tonality. The illusion of glowing light with a porcelain-like finish characterized [[Early Netherlandish painting]] and was a major difference to the matte surface of [[tempera]] paint used in Italy.&lt;ref name="Gardner et al" /&gt; 
[[File:La Anunciación, de Fra Angelico.jpg|thumb|[[Fra Angelico]], 1425–1428]]

Unlike the Italians, whose work drew heavily from the art of ancient Rome, the northerners retained a stylistic residue of the sculpture and [[illuminated manuscripts]] of the Middle Ages (especially its naturalism).  Another important Netherlandish painter of this period was [[Rogier van der Weyden]], a pupil of Campin, whose compositions stressed human emotion and drama, demonstrated for instance in his [[The Descent from the Cross (van der Weyden)|Descent from the Cross]], which ranks among the most famous works of the 15th century and was the most influential Netherlandish painting of Christ's crucifixion. Other important artists were [[Hugo van der Goes]] (whose work was highly influential in Italy), [[Dieric Bouts]] (who was among the first northern painters to demonstrate the use of a single vanishing point),&lt;ref name="Gardner et al" /&gt; [[Petrus Christus]], [[Hans Memling]] and [[Gerard David]].  Collectively, the advances in painting in Europe north of the Alps is known as the [[Northern Renaissance]].    

In [[Italian Renaissance painting]], the art of [[Classical antiquity]] inspired a style of painting that emphasized the ideal. [[Masaccio]] is credited with making advances in linear perspective, the depiction of volume in his figures, and in portraying emotions on the faces of his figures in the 1420s.  Then, artists such as [[Paolo Uccello]], [[Fra Angelico]], [[Piero della Francesca]], [[Andrea Mantegna]], [[Filippo Lippi]], and [[Sandro Botticelli]], in the [[Early Renaissance]] period lasting to about 1495, and then [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Michelangelo Buonarroti]], and [[Raphael]] during the [[High Renaissance]] from about 1495 to 1520, took painting to a higher level through the use of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], the study of [[human anatomy]] and proportion, and through their development of an unprecedented refinement in drawing and painting techniques. A somewhat more naturalistic High Renaissance style emerged in [[Venice]]. Painters of the [[Venetian school (art)|Venetian school]], such as [[Giovanni Bellini]], [[Giorgione]], [[Titian]], and [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]], were less concerned with precision in their drawing than with the richness of color and unity of effect that could be achieved by a more spontaneous approach to painting.  

Flemish, Dutch and German painters of the [[Northern Renaissance|Northern High Renaissance]] such as [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Lucas Cranach]], [[Matthias Grünewald]], and [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] had a different approach than their Italian counterparts, one that is more realistic and less idealized. Some northern painters, beginning with Dürer in the 1490s, traveled to Italy to see works of the Italian High Renaissance and they incorporated the features of the Italian art into their own to varying degrees.A generation later, the start of [[genre painting]] as a subject for large works began with [[Peter Aertsen]] and [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]]. A later generation of Northern Renaissance painters who traveled to Rome and adopted much of the idealized approach of the Italian Renaissance became known as [[Romanists]].
[[File:Titian Bacchus and Ariadne.jpg|thumb|[[Titian]], 1520–1523]]

Renaissance painting reflects the revolution of ideas and science ([[astronomy]], [[geography]]) that occurred in this period, the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], and the invention of the [[printing press]].  [[Printmaking]] became increasingly important, and practiced by many painters. Dürer, considered one of the greatest of printmakers, states that painters are not mere [[artisan]]s but [[Intellectual|thinkers]] as well. With the development of [[easel painting]] in the Renaissance, painting gained independence from architecture. Easel paintings—movable pictures which could be hung easily on walls—became a popular alternative to paintings fixed to furniture, walls or other structures. Following centuries dominated by religious imagery, secular subject matter slowly returned to Western painting. Artists included visions of the world around them, or the products of their own imaginations in their paintings. Those who could afford the expense could become patrons and commission portraits of themselves or their family.

The [[High Renaissance]] in Italy gave rise to a stylized art known as [[Mannerism]] after 1520, although some painters, such as Titian and [[Paolo Veronese]], continued painting in a High Renaissance style late into the century. In place of the balanced compositions and rational approach to perspective that characterized art at the dawn of the 16th century, the Mannerists sought instability, artifice, and doubt. The calm Virgins of Raphael and serene expressions of Leonardo's subjects are replaced by the troubled expressions of [[Pontormo]] and the emotional intensity of [[El Greco]]. Restless and unstable compositions, often extreme or disjunctive effects of perspective, and stylized poses are characteristic of Italian Mannerists such as [[Tintoretto]], Pontormo, and [[Bronzino]], and appeared later in the work of [[Northern Mannerism|Northern Mannerists]] such as [[Hendrick Goltzius]], [[Bartholomeus Spranger]], and [[Joachim Wtewael]].

Baroque painting is associated with the [[Baroque]] [[cultural movement]], a movement often identified with [[political absolutism|Absolutism]] and the [[Counter Reformation]] or Catholic Revival;&lt;ref name=ebo&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9026564/Counter-Reformation Counter Reformation], from ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]'', latest edition, full-article.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/65/co/CounterR.html Counter Reformation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211173809/http://www.bartleby.com/65/co/CounterR.html |date=11 December 2008 }}, from ''[[The Columbia Encyclopedia]]'', Sixth Edition.  2001–05.&lt;/ref&gt; the existence of important Baroque painting in non-absolutist and Protestant states also, however, underscores its popularity, as the style spread throughout Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Gardner, Fred S. Kleiner, and Christin J. Mamiya, "Gardner's Art Through the Ages" (Belmont, CA: Thomson/Wadsworth, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Baroque painting is characterized by great drama, rich, deep color, and intense light and dark shadows with the purpose of the art being to evoke emotion and passion instead of the calm rationality that had been prized during the Renaissance. The earliest Baroque painters included the Caracci brothers, [[Annibale Caracci|Annibale]] and [[Agostino Caracci|Agostino]], in the last score of the 16th century, and [[Caravaggio]] in the last decade of the century. Caravaggio is recognized as one of the greatest Baroque painters and an heir of the [[Humanism|humanist]] painting of the [[High Renaissance]]. His [[realism (visual arts)|realistic]] approach to the human figure, painted directly from life and dramatically spotlit against a dark background, shocked his contemporaries and opened a new chapter in the history of painting.  Baroque was the dominant style of painting beginning around 1600 and continuing throughout the 17th century. Among the greatest painters of the Baroque are [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Frans Hals]], [[Johannes Vermeer]], [[Le Nain]], [[Jusepe de Ribera]], [[Nicolas Poussin|Poussin]], [[Georges de la Tour|Tour]],  and [[Claude Lorraine]], who focused on landscape painting.  Poussin, Claude and La Tour, all French, adopted a "classical" Baroque style with less focus on emotion and greater attention to the outine of the figures in the painting than on colour.  Most of these painters traveled to Italy as part of their training and would then take the Baroque style back to their homelands, although in some cases they remained in Italy for large portions of their career (Claude and Poussin).  In Italy, the Baroque style is epitomized by religious and mythological paintings in the [[Grand Manner]] by artists such as [[the Carracci]], [[Guido Reni]], and [[Luca Giordano]]. Illusionistic church ceiling frescoes by [[Pietro da Cortona]] seemed to open to the sky.

[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn - Portret van een paar als oudtestamentische figuren, genaamd 'Het Joodse bruidje' - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Rembrandt|Rembrandt van Rijn]], ''The Jewish Bride'', ca.&amp;nbsp;1665–1669]]
A much quieter type of Baroque emerged in the [[Dutch Republic]], where easel paintings of everyday subjects were popular with middle-class collectors, and many painters became specialists in [[genre painting|genre]], others in landscape or seascape or still life. Vermeer, [[Gerard ter Borch]], and [[Pieter de Hooch]] brought great technical refinement to the painting of domestic scenes, as did [[Willem Claesz. Heda]] to still life. In contrast, Rembrandt excelled in painting every type of subject, and developed an individual [[painterliness|painterly]] style in which the chiaroscuro and dark backgrounds derived from Caravaggio and the [[Utrecht Caravaggists]] lose their theatrical quality.  Dutch Baroque painting is often referred to as [[Dutch Golden Age Painting]].

During the 18th century, [[Rococo]] painting followed as a lighter extension of Baroque, often frivolous and erotic and using light pastel colours. Rococo developed first in the decorative arts and interior design in France. [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]]'s succession brought a change in the court artists and general artistic fashion.  The 1730s represented the height of Rococo development in France exemplified by the works of [[Antoine Watteau]] and [[François Boucher]].  Rococo still maintained the Baroque taste for complex forms and intricate patterns, but by this point, it had begun to integrate a variety of diverse characteristics, including a taste for Oriental designs and asymmetric compositions.

The Rococo style spread with French artists and engraved publications.  It was readily received in the Catholic parts of Germany, [[Bohemia]], and [[Austria]], where it was merged with the lively German Baroque traditions.  German Rococo was applied with enthusiasm to churches and palaces, particularly in the south, while [[Frederician Rococo]] developed in the [[Kingdom of Prussia]].

The French masters [[Jean-Antoine Watteau|Watteau]], [[François Boucher|Boucher]] and [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard|Fragonard]] represent the style, as do [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]] and [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin]] who was considered by some as the best French painter of the 18th century – the ''Anti-Rococo''. [[Portrait]]ure was an important component of painting in all countries, but especially in England, where the leaders were [[William Hogarth]], in a blunt realist style, and [[Francis Hayman]], [[Angelica Kauffman]] (who was Swiss), [[Thomas Gainsborough]] and [[Joshua Reynolds]] in more flattering styles influenced by [[Anthony van Dyck]]. In France during the Rococo era [[Jean-Baptiste Greuze]] (the favorite painter of [[Denis Diderot]]),&lt;ref&gt;[[Edmond de Goncourt|Edmond]] and [[Jules de Goncourt]], ''French Eighteenth-Century Painters.'' Cornell Paperbacks, 1981, pp. 222–225. {{ISBN|0-8014-9218-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; excelled in portraits and [[history painting]]s, and [[Maurice Quentin de La Tour]] and [[Élisabeth Vigée-Lebrun]] were highly accomplished [[Portrait painting|portrait painters]]. La Tour specialized in [[pastel]] painting, which became a popular medium during this period.

[[William Hogarth]] helped develop a theoretical foundation for Rococo beauty. Though not intentionally referencing the movement, he argued in his ''Analysis of Beauty'' (1753) that the undulating lines and S-curves prominent in Rococo were the basis for grace and beauty in art or nature (unlike the straight line or the circle in [[Classicism]]). The beginning of the end for Rococo came in the early 1760s as figures like [[Voltaire]] and [[Jacques-François Blondel]] began to voice their criticism of the superficiality and degeneracy of the art.  Blondel decried the "ridiculous jumble of shells, dragons, reeds, palm-trees and plants" in contemporary interiors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/sammlung6/allg/buch.xml?docname=blondel1737 Uni-Heidelberg.de]{{dead link|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1785, Rococo had passed out of fashion in France, replaced by the order and seriousness of [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] artists such as [[Jacques-Louis David]], whose imposing history paintings depicting both historical and contemporary events embodied the ideals of the [[French Revolution]].

After [[Rococo]] there arose in the late 18th century, in architecture, and then in painting severe [[neo-classicism]], best represented by such artists as [[Jacques-Louis David|David]] and his heir [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]]. Ingres' work already contains much of the sensuality, but none of the spontaneity, that was to characterize [[Romanticism]].

By the mid-19th century, painters became liberated from the demands of their patronage to only depict scenes from religion, mythology, portraiture or history. Art became more purely a means of personal expression in the work of painters like [[Francisco de Goya]], [[John Constable]], and [[J. M. W. Turner]]. Romantic painters turned [[landscape painting]] into a major genre, considered until then as a minor genre or as a decorative background for figure compositions.
Some of the major painters of this period are [[Eugène Delacroix]], [[Théodore Géricault]], J. M. W. Turner, [[Caspar David Friedrich]] and John Constable. Francisco Goya's late work demonstrates the Romantic interest in the irrational, the work of [[Arnold Böcklin]] evokes mystery, the work of the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] in England combines assiduous devotion to nature with nostalgia for medieval culture, and the paintings of [[Aesthetic movement]] artist [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]] evoke sophistication, [[decadent movement|decadence]], and the philosophy of "art for art's sake". In the United States the Romantic tradition of landscape painting was known as the [[Hudson River School]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0268/is_5_40/ai_82469521 |title=Novack, Barbara '&amp;#39;American Sublime'&amp;#39; Artforum, 2002, retrieved 30 October 2008 |publisher=Findarticles.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; exponents include [[Thomas Cole]], [[Frederic Edwin Church]], [[Albert Bierstadt]], [[Thomas Moran]], and [[John Frederick Kensett]]. [[Luminism (American art style)|Luminism]] was a movement in American landscape painting related to the Hudson River School.
[[File:Johan Barthold Jongkind - Overschie bij maneschijn.jpg|thumb|left|220px|[[Johan Jongkind]], 1871, a prefiguration of impressionism]]
A major force in the turn towards [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] at mid-century was [[Gustave Courbet]], whose unidealized paintings of common people offended viewers accustomed to the conventional subject matter and [[licked finish]] of [[academic art]], but inspired many younger artists. The leading [[Barbizon School]] painter [[Jean-François Millet]] also painted landscapes and scenes of peasant life. Loosely associated with the Barbizon School was [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot|Camille Corot]], who painted in both a romantic and a [[Realism (visual arts)|realistic]] vein; his work prefigures [[Impressionism]], as did the paintings of [[Johan Jongkind]] and [[Eugène Boudin]] (who was one of the first French landscape painters to paint outdoors). Boudin was an important influence on the young [[Claude Monet]], whom in 1857 he introduced to [[plein air]] painting.

In the latter third of the century Impressionists such as [[Édouard Manet]], Claude Monet, [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Camille Pissarro]], [[Alfred Sisley]], [[Berthe Morisot]], [[Mary Cassatt]], and [[Edgar Degas]] worked in a more direct approach than had previously been exhibited publicly. They eschewed allegory and narrative in favor of individualized responses to the modern world, sometimes painted with little or no preparatory study, relying on deftness of drawing and a highly chromatic palette. Monet, Pissarro, and Sisley used the landscape as their primary motif, the transience of light and weather playing a major role in their work. Following a practice that had become increasingly popular by mid-century, they often ventured into the countryside together to paint in the open air, but not for the traditional purpose of making sketches to be developed into carefully finished works in the studio.&lt;ref&gt;Bomford, David, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, Ashok Roy, and Raymond White (1990). ''Impressionism''. London: National Gallery. pp. 21–27. {{ISBN|0-300-05035-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By painting in sunlight directly from nature, and making bold use of the vivid synthetic pigments that had become available since the beginning of the century, they developed a lighter and brighter manner of painting.
[[File:The Scream.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Edvard Munch]], 1893, early example of [[Expressionism]]]]
Manet, Degas, Renoir, Morisot, and Cassatt concentrated primarily on the human subject. Both Manet and Degas reinterpreted classical figurative canons within contemporary situations; in Manet's case the re-imaginings met with hostile public reception. Renoir, Morisot, and Cassatt turned to domestic life for inspiration, with Renoir focusing on the female nude. While Sisley most closely adhered to the original principals of the Impressionist perception of the landscape, Monet sought challenges in increasingly chromatic and changeable conditions, culminating in his series of monumental works of [[Water Lilies]] painted in [[Giverny]].

[[Post-Impressionist]]s such as [[Paul Cézanne]] and the slightly younger [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Paul Gauguin]], and [[Georges-Pierre Seurat]] led art to the edge of [[modernism]]. For Gauguin Impressionism gave way to a personal symbolism. Seurat transformed Impressionism's broken color into a scientific optical study, structured on frieze-like compositions. The painting technique he developed, called [[Divisionism]], attracted many followers such as [[Paul Signac]], and for a few years in the late 1880s Pissarro adopted some of his methods. Van Gogh's turbulent method of paint application, coupled with a sonorous use of color, predicted [[Expressionism]] and [[Fauvism]], and Cézanne, desiring to unite classical composition with a revolutionary abstraction of natural forms, would come to be seen as a precursor of 20th-century art.

The spell of Impressionism was felt throughout the world, including in the United States, where it became integral to the painting of [[American Impressionists]] such as [[Childe Hassam]], [[John Henry Twachtman]], and [[Theodore Robinson]]. It also exerted influence on painters who were not primarily Impressionistic in theory, like the portrait and landscape painter [[John Singer Sargent]]. At the same time in America at the turn of the 20th century there existed a native and nearly insular realism, as richly embodied in the figurative work of [[Thomas Eakins]], the [[Ashcan School]], and the landscapes and seascapes of [[Winslow Homer]], all of whose paintings were deeply invested in the solidity of natural forms.  The visionary landscape, a motive largely dependent on the ambiguity of the nocturne, found its advocates in [[Albert Pinkham Ryder]] and [[Ralph Albert Blakelock]].

In the late 19th century there also were several, rather dissimilar, groups of [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist painters]] whose works resonated with younger artists of the 20th century, especially with the [[Fauvism|Fauvists]] and the [[Surrealism|Surrealists]]. Among them were [[Gustave Moreau]], [[Odilon Redon]], [[Pierre Puvis de Chavannes]], [[Henri Fantin-Latour]], [[Arnold Böcklin]], [[Ferdinand Hodler]], [[Edvard Munch]], [[Félicien Rops]], [[Jan Toorop]], and [[Gustav Klimt]], and the [[Russian Symbolism|Russian Symbolists]] such as [[Mikhail Vrubel]].

Symbolist painters mined [[mythology]] and dream imagery for a visual language of the soul, seeking evocative paintings that brought to mind a static world of silence. The symbols used in Symbolism are not the familiar [[emblems]] of mainstream [[iconography]] but intensely personal, private, obscure and ambiguous references. More a philosophy than an actual style of art, the Symbolist painters influenced the contemporary [[Art Nouveau]] movement and [[Les Nabis]]. In their exploration of dreamlike subjects, symbolist painters are found across centuries and cultures, as they are still today; [[Bernard Delvaille]] has described [[René Magritte]]'s surrealism as "Symbolism plus [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard Delvaille|Delvaille, Bernard]], ''La poésie symboliste: anthologie'', introduction. {{ISBN|2-221-50161-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The heritage of painters like [[Van Gogh]], [[Cézanne]], [[Gauguin]], and [[Seurat]] was essential for the development of modern art. At the beginning of the 20th century [[Henri Matisse]] and several other young artists including the pre-cubist [[Georges Braque]], [[André Derain]], [[Raoul Dufy]] and [[Maurice de Vlaminck]] revolutionized the Paris art world with "wild", multi-colored, expressive landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called [[Fauvism]]. Henri Matisse's second version of ''[[The Dance (painting)|The Dance]]'' signifies a key point in his career and in the development of modern painting.&lt;ref&gt;Russell T. Clement. ''Four French Symbolists''. [[Greenwood Press]], 1996. Page 114.&lt;/ref&gt; It reflects Matisse's incipient fascination with [[primitive art]]: the intense warm colors against the cool blue-green background and the rhythmical succession of dancing nudes convey the feelings of emotional liberation and [[hedonism]]. [[Pablo Picasso]] made his first [[Cubism|cubist]] paintings based on Cézanne's idea that all depiction of nature can be reduced to three solids: [[cube]], [[sphere]] and [[cone (geometry)|cone]]. With the painting ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' (1907),  Picasso created a new and radical picture depicting a brothel scene with five prostitutes, violently painted women, reminiscent of [[African tribal masks]] and his own Cubist inventions. [[Cubism]] was jointly developed from about 1908 through 1912 by Pablo Picasso and [[Georges Braque]], whose ''Violin and Candlestick, Paris'' (1910) is shown here. The first clear manifestation of Cubism was practised by Braque, Picasso, [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], and [[Robert Delaunay]]. [[Juan Gris]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Alexander Archipenko]], [[Joseph Csaky]] and others soon joined.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;displayall=1#skipToContent |title=Christopher Green, 2009, Cubism, MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press |publisher=Moma.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Synthetic cubism]], practiced by Braque and Picasso, is characterized by the introduction of different textures, surfaces, [[collage]] elements, [[papier collé]] and a large variety of merged subject matter.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

The [[Salon d'Automne]] of 1905 brought notoriety and attention to the works of [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Fauvism]]. The group gained their name after critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]] described their work with the phrase "[[Donatello]] chez les fauves" ("Donatello among the wild beasts"),&lt;ref name="Gil Blas, 17 October 1905"&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7522165g/f5.image Louis Vauxcelles, ''Le Salon d'Automne'', Gil Blas, 17 October 1905.

In the first two decades of the 20th century and after cubism, several other important movements emerged; [[Futurism (art)|Futurism]] ([[Giacomo Balla|Balla]]), [[Abstract art]] ([[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]]) [[Der Blaue Reiter]] (Kandinsky and [[Franz Marc]]), [[Bauhaus]] (Kandinsky and [[Paul Klee|Klee]]), [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]], ([[Robert Delaunay|Delaunay]] and [[František Kupka|Kupka]]), [[Synchromism]] ([[Morgan Russell|Russell]]), [[De Stijl]] ([[Theo van Doesburg|van Doesburg]] and [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]]), [[Suprematism]] ([[Malevich]]), [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] ([[Tatlin]]), [[Dadaism]] ([[Duchamp]], [[Picabia]] and [[Jean Arp|Arp]]), and [[Surrealism]] ([[Giorgio de Chirico|de Chirico]], [[André Breton]], [[Joan Miró|Miró]], [[René Magritte|Magritte]], [[Salvador Dalí|Dalí]] and [[Max Ernst|Ernst]]).  Modern painting influenced all the visual arts, from [[Modernist]] architecture and design, to [[avant-garde]] film, theatre and [[modern dance]] and became an experimental laboratory for the expression of visual experience, from photography and [[concrete poetry]] to [[advertising|advertising art]] and fashion.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[Fauvism]] was a loose grouping of early 20th-century artists whose works emphasized [[painterly]] qualities, and the imaginative use of deep color over the representational values. The leaders of the movement were [[Henri Matisse]] and [[André Derain]] – friendly rivals of a sort, each with his own followers.  Ultimately [[Matisse]] became the ''yang'' to [[Picasso]]'s ''yin'' in the 20th century. Fauvist painters included [[Albert Marquet]], [[Charles Camoin]], [[Maurice de Vlaminck]], [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Othon Friesz]], the Dutch painter [[Kees van Dongen]], and Picasso's partner in Cubism, [[Georges Braque]] amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;''The "Wild Beasts" Fauvism and its Affinities,'' [[John Elderfield]], Museum of Modern Art 1976, {{ISBN|0-87070-638-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fauvism had no concrete theories, and was short lived, beginning in 1905 and ending in 1907. They had only three exhibitions. Matisse was seen as the leader of the movement, due to his seniority in age and prior self-establishment in the academic art world. His 1905 portrait of Mme. Matisse, ''[[Green Stripe|The Green Stripe]]'', caused a sensation in Paris when it was first exhibited. He said he wanted to create art to delight, and it can be said that his use of bright colors tries to maintain serenity of composition. In 1906 at the suggestion of his dealer [[Ambroise Vollard]], André Derain went to London and produced a series of paintings including ''Charing Cross Bridge, London'' in the [[Fauvism|Fauvist]] style, paraphrasing the famous series by the [[Impressionist]] painter [[Claude Monet]].

By 1907 Fauvism no longer was a shocking new movement, and [[Guillaume Apollinaire|Appolinaire]] said of Matisse in an article published in ''La Falange'', "We are not here in the presence of an extravagant or an extremist undertaking: Matisse's art is eminently reasonable."&lt;ref&gt;''Picasso and Braque pioneering cubism'' [[William Rubin]], published by the [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York, copyright 1989, {{ISBN|0-87070-676-4}} p. 348.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Die Brücke]] was a group of German [[expressionist]] artists formed in [[Dresden]] in 1905. Founding members were [[Fritz Bleyl]], [[Erich Heckel]], [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]] and [[Karl Schmidt-Rottluff]]. Later members included [[Max Pechstein]] and [[Otto Mueller]]. This seminal group had a major impact on the evolution of [[modern art]] in the 20th century and created the style of [[Expressionism]].&lt;ref name=bruckemuseumbrucke&gt;[http://www.bruecke-museum.de/englbleyl.htm "The Artists' Association 'Brücke'"], [[Brücke-Museum (Berlin)|Brücke Museum]]. Retrieved 7 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Der Blaue Reiter]] was a German movement lasting from 1911 to 1914, fundamental to Expressionism. [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Franz Marc]], [[August Macke]], [[Alexej von Jawlensky]], whose psychically expressive painting of the Russian dancer ''Portrait of [[Alexander Sakharoff]]'' (1909) is seen here, [[Marianne von Werefkin]], [[Lyonel Feininger]] and others founded the Der Blaue Reiter group in response to the rejection of Kandinsky's painting ''Last Judgement'' from an exhibition. Der Blaue Reiter lacked a central artistic manifesto, but was centered around Kandinsky and Marc. Artists [[Gabriele Münter]] and [[Paul Klee]] were also involved. The name of the movement comes from a painting by Kandinsky created in 1903. For Kandinsky, ''blue'' is the color of spirituality: the darker the blue, the more it awakens human desire for the eternal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=86 Der Blaue Reiter, Tate Glossary] retrieved 10 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

''[[Expressionism]]'' and ''[[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]'' are broad rubrics that involve several related movements in 20th-century painting that dominated much of the [[avant-garde]] art being made in Western, Eastern and Northern Europe. Expressionist works were painted largely between World War I and World War II, mostly in France, Germany, Norway, Russia, Belgium, and Austria. [[Fauvism]], [[Die Brücke]], and [[Der Blaue Reiter]] are three of the best known groups of Expressionist and Symbolist painters. [[Marc Chagall]]'s painting ''[[I and the Village]]'' tells an autobiographical story that examines the relationship between the artist and his origins, with a lexicon of artistic Symbolism. [[Gustav Klimt]], [[Egon Schiele]], [[Edvard Munch]], [[Emil Nolde]], [[Chaim Soutine]], [[James Ensor]], [[Oskar Kokoschka]], [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]], [[Max Beckmann]], [[Franz Marc]], [[Georges Rouault]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]], and some Americans abroad such as [[Marsden Hartley]] and [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]], were considered influential expressionist painters. Although [[Alberto Giacometti]] is primarily thought of as a Surrealist sculptor, he made intense expressionist paintings as well.

American painters during the period between World War I and World War II tended to go to Europe for recognition. [[Modernist]] artists like Marsden Hartley, [[Patrick Henry Bruce]], [[Gerald Murphy]] and Stuart Davis created reputations abroad. While Patrick Henry Bruce&lt;ref&gt;Agee and Rose, 1979, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; created [[cubist]] related paintings in Europe, both Stuart Davis and Gerald Murphy made paintings that were early inspirations for American [[pop art]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/artworld/2007/08/06/070806craw_artworld_schjeldahl |title=New Yorker article, accessed online 11 November 2008 |publisher=Newyorker.com |date=2007-08-06 |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wayne Craven, ''American Art: History and Culture,'' p. 464.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jasonkaufman.com/articles/stuart_davis_american_modernist.htm Jasonkaufman.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017051233/http://jasonkaufman.com/articles/stuart_davis_american_modernist.htm |date=17 October 2008 }}, accessed online 28 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and Marsden Hartley experimented with expressionism.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

[[Wassily Kandinsky]] is generally considered one of the first important painters of [[Modern Art|modern]] [[abstract art]]. As an early [[modernist]],  he theorized as did contemporary [[occultists]] and [[theosophists]], that pure visual abstraction had corollary vibrations with sound and music. They posited that pure abstraction could express pure spirituality. His earliest abstractions were generally titled as the example in the ''Composition VII'', making connection to the work of the composers of music. Kandinsky included many of his theories about abstract art in his book ''Concerning the Spiritual in Art''. Other major pioneers of early abstraction include Swedish painter [[Hilma af Klint]], Russian painter [[Kazimir Malevich]], and Swiss painter [[Paul Klee]]. [[Robert Delaunay]] was a French artist who is associated with [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]], (reminiscent of a link between pure abstraction and cubism). His key contributions to abstract painting refer to his bold use of color and his experimentation of both depth and tone.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[Marcel Duchamp]] came to international prominence in the wake of the New York City [[Armory Show]] in 1913 where his ''[[Nude Descending a Staircase]]'' became a cause célèbre. He subsequently created ''[[The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even]], [[Large Glass]]''. The ''Large Glass'' pushed the art of painting to radical new limits being part painting, part collage, part construction. Duchamp (who was soon to renounce artmaking for chess) became closely associated with the [[Dada]] movement that began in neutral [[Zürich, Switzerland]], during World War I and peaked from 1916 to 1920. The movement primarily involved visual arts, literature (poetry, art manifestoes, art theory), theatre, and graphic design to advance its antiwar politic and rejection of the prevailing standards in art through [[anti-art]] cultural works. Other artists associated with the Dada movement include [[Francis Picabia]], [[Man Ray]], [[Kurt Schwitters]], [[Hannah Höch]], [[Tristan Tzara]], [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]], [[Jean Arp]], and [[Sophie Taeuber-Arp]]. Duchamp and several Dadaists are also associated with Surrealism, the movement that dominated European painting in the 1920s and 1930s.
[[File:Duchamp - Nude Descending a Staircase.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Marcel Duchamp]], ''[[Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2]]'', 1912, [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]]]
In 1924 [[André Breton]] published the ''[[Surrealist Manifesto]]''. The [[Surrealist]] movement in painting became synonymous with the [[avant-garde]] and featured artists whose works varied from the abstract to the super-realist. With works on paper like ''Machine Turn Quickly'', Francis Picabia continued his involvement in the Dada movement through 1919 in Zürich and Paris, before breaking away from it after developing an interest in Surrealist art. [[Yves Tanguy]], [[René Magritte]] and [[Salvador Dalí]] are particularly known for their realistic depictions of dream imagery and fantastic manifestations of the imagination. During the 1920s [[André Masson]]'s work was decisive in helping the young artist [[Joan Miró]] find his roots in Surrealist painting. Miró's ''[[The Tilled Field]]'' (1923–1924) verges on abstraction while suggesting a complex of objects and figures and arrangements of sexually active characters; it was Miró's first Surrealist [[masterpiece]].&lt;ref&gt;Spector, Nancy. "[http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/artist_work_md_109_7.html The Tilled Field, 1923–1924] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925010715/http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/artist_work_md_109_7.html |date=25 September 2008 }}". [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim]] display caption. Retrieved 30 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Joan Miró, Jean Arp, André Masson, and [[Max Ernst]] were very influential, especially in the United States during the 1940s.

Max Ernst, whose 1920 painting ''Murdering Airplane'' is seen here, studied philosophy and psychology in Bonn and was interested in the alternative realities experienced by the insane. His paintings may have been inspired by the [[psychoanalyst]] [[Sigmund Freud]]'s study of the delusions of a paranoiac, Daniel Paul Schreber. Freud identified Schreber's fantasy of becoming a woman as a ''[[castration complex]].'' The central image of two pairs of legs refers to Schreber's hermaphroditic desires. Ernst's inscription on the back of the painting reads: ''The picture is curious because of its symmetry. The two sexes balance one another.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&amp;workid=4133&amp;searchid=19833&amp;tabview=text |title=From the Tate Modern |publisher=Tate.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1930s, Surrealism continued to become more visible to the public at large. A [[British Surrealist Group|Surrealist group developed in Britain]] and, according to Breton, their 1936 [[London International Surrealist Exhibition]] was a high-water mark of the period and became the model for international exhibitions. Surrealist groups in Japan, and especially in Latin America, the Caribbean and in Mexico produced innovative and original works. Other prominent surrealist artists include [[Giorgio de Chirico]], [[Méret Oppenheim]], [[Toyen]], [[Grégoire Michonze]], [[Roberto Matta]], [[Kay Sage]], [[Leonora Carrington]], [[Dorothea Tanning]], and [[Leonor Fini]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;
During the 1920s and the 1930s and the [[Great Depression]], the European art scene was characterized by Surrealism, late Cubism, the [[Bauhaus]], [[De Stijl]], Dada, [[Neue Sachlichkeit]], and Expressionism; and was occupied by masterful [[modernist]] color painters like [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Pierre Bonnard]].

In Germany [[Neue Sachlichkeit]] ("New Objectivity") emerged as [[Max Beckmann]], [[Otto Dix]], [[George Grosz]] and others politicized their paintings. The work of these artists grew out of expressionism, and was a response to the political tensions of the [[Weimar Republic]], and was often sharply satirical.

During the 1930s radical leftist politics characterized many of the artists connected to Surrealism, including [[Pablo Picasso]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Helena. ''Dada Turns Red''. 1990. [[Edinburgh University Press]].

The Germans were attacking to support the efforts of Francisco Franco to overthrow the Basque Government and the Spanish Republican government. Pablo Picasso painted his mural sized ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' to commemorate the horrors of the bombing.

The painting was first exhibited in Paris in 1937, then Scandinavia and London, and in 1939 at Picasso's request the painting was sent to the United States in an extended loan (for safekeeping) at [[MoMA]]. Finally in accord with Picasso's wish to give the painting to the people of Spain as a gift, it was sent to Spain in 1981.

From the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s through the years of World War II, [[Visual art of the United States|American art]] was characterized by [[Social Realism]] and [[American Scene Painting]]. [[Regionalism (art)|Regionalism]] movements that contained both political and social commentary dominated the art world in the USA. Artists such as [[Ben Shahn]], [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]], [[Grant Wood]], [[George Tooker]], [[John Steuart Curry]], [[Reginald Marsh (artist)|Reginald Marsh]], and others became prominent.

''[[American Gothic]]'' is a painting by Grant Wood from 1930. Portraying a pitchfork-holding farmer and a younger woman in front of a house of [[Carpenter Gothic]] style, it is one of the most familiar images in 20th-century American art. Art critics assumed it was satirical in intent; it was thought to be part of the trend towards increasingly critical depictions of rural America exemplified by [[Sherwood Anderson]]'s ''1919 [[Winesburg, Ohio (novel)|Winesburg, Ohio]]'', [[Sinclair Lewis]]' 1920 ''[[Main Street (novel)|Main Street]]'', and [[Carl Van Vechten]]'s ''The Tattooed Countess'' in literature.&lt;ref name=slate&gt;Fineman, Mia, [http://www.slate.com/id/2120494/ The Most Famous Farm Couple in the World: Why American Gothic still fascinates.], ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', 8 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  However, with the onset of the [[Great Depression]], the painting came to be seen as a depiction of steadfast American pioneer spirit.

A renaissance of the arts in Latin America included the [[Uruguay]]an painter [[Joaquín Torres García]], the Mexican painter [[Rufino Tamayo]], artists of the Mexican [[Mexican muralism|muralist movement]] such as [[Diego Rivera]], [[David Siqueiros]], [[José Orozco]], [[Pedro Nel Gómez]] and [[Santiago Martinez Delgado]], and the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] painter [[Frida Kahlo]]. The muralists conveyed historic and political messages. Diego Rivera is perhaps best known by the public world for his 1933 mural, "[[Man at the Crossroads]]", in the lobby of the RCA Building at [[Rockefeller Center]]. When his patron [[Nelson Rockefeller]] discovered that the mural included a portrait of [[Lenin]] and other communist imagery, he fired Rivera, and the unfinished work was eventually destroyed by Rockefeller's staff.

Frida Kahlo's works relate to Surrealism and to the [[Magic Realism]] movement in literature. Her works are often characterized by their stark portrayals of pain. Of her 143 paintings 55 are self-portraits, which frequently incorporate symbolic portrayals of her physical and psychological wounds.&lt;ref&gt;Herrera, Hayden. "Frida Kahlo". Oxford Art Online.

The 1940s in New York City heralded the triumph of American [[abstract expressionism]], a movement that combined lessons learned from European Modernists via great teachers in America like [[Hans Hofmann]] and [[John D. Graham]]. American artists benefited from the presence of [[Piet Mondrian]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Max Ernst]] and the [[André Breton]] group, Pierre Matisse's gallery, and [[Peggy Guggenheim]]'s gallery ''[[The Art of This Century]]'', as well as other factors.
 [[File:Newman-Onement 1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Barnett Newman]], ''Onement 1,'' 1948. During the 1940s Barnett Newman wrote several articles about the new American painting.]]
Post-Second World War American painting called Abstract expressionism included artists like [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Mark Rothko]], Hans Hofmann, [[Clyfford Still]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Mark Tobey]], [[James Brooks (painter)|James Brooks]], [[Philip Guston]], [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Conrad Marca-Relli]], [[Jack Tworkov]], [[Esteban Vicente]], [[William Baziotes]], [[Richard Pousette-Dart]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Hedda Sterne]], [[Jimmy Ernst]], [[Bradley Walker Tomlin]], and [[Theodoros Stamos]], among others. American Abstract expressionism got its name in 1946 from the art critic [[Robert Coates (critic)|Robert Coates]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.moma.org/explore/multimedia/interactives/156 Abstract Expressionism, NY, MoMA]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clement Greenberg, ''Art and Culture Critical essays,'' ("American-Type Painting"), Beacon Press, 1961 pp.:208–229, {{ISBN|978-0807066812}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Abstract expressionism, [[Action painting]], and [[Color Field]] painting are synonymous with the [[New York School (art)|New York School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/ppaessay.html|title=Post Painterly Abstraction|author=|date=|website=www.sharecom.ca|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technically Surrealism was an important predecessor for Abstract expressionism with its emphasis on spontaneous, [[Surrealist automatism|automatic]] or subconscious creation. [[Jackson Pollock]]'s dripping paint onto a canvas laid on the floor is a technique that has its roots in the work of [[André Masson]]. Another important ear&lt;nowiki&gt;ly m&lt;/nowiki&gt;anifestation of what came to be abstract expressionism is the work of American Northwest artist [[Mark Tobey]], especially his "white writing" canvases, which, though generally not large in scale, anticipate the "all over" look of Pollock's drip paintings.

Additionally, Abstract expressionism has an image of being rebellious, anarchic, highly idiosyncratic and, some feel, rather nihilistic. In practice, the term is applied to any number of artists working (mostly) in New York who had quite different styles, and even applied to work which is not especially abstract nor expressionist. Pollock's energetic "[[action painting]]s", with their "busy" feel, are different both technically and aesthetically, to the violent and grotesque ''Women'' series of [[Willem de Kooning]]. Woman V is one of a series of six paintings made by de Kooning between 1950 and 1953 that depict a three-quarter-length female figure. He began the first of these paintings, Woman I, in June 1950, repeatedly changing and painting out the image until January or February 1952, when the painting was abandoned unfinished. The art historian [[Meyer Schapiro]] saw the painting in de Kooning's studio and encouraged the artist to persist. De Kooning's response was to begin three other paintings on the same theme; Woman II, [[Woman III]], and Woman IV. During the summer of 1952, spent at [[East Hampton (town), New York|East Hampton]], de Kooning further explored the theme through drawings and pastels. He finished work on Woman I by November 1952, and probably the other three women pictures were concluded at much the same time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov.au/International/Catalogue/Detail.cfm?IRN=47761&amp;BioArtistIRN=25281&amp;MnuID=2&amp;GalID=1 NGA.gov.au], [[National Gallery of Australia]]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Woman series'' are decidedly [[Figurative art|figurative paintings]]. Another important artist is [[Franz Kline]], as demonstrated by his painting ''High Street'' (1950), who was labelled an action painter because of his seemingly spontaneous and intense style, focusing less, or not at all, on figures or imagery, but on the actual brush strokes and use of canvas.

[[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], and the serenely shimmering blocks of color in [[Mark Rothko]]'s work (which is not what would usually be called expressionist and which Rothko denied was abstract), are classified as abstract expressionists, albeit from what [[Clement Greenberg]] termed the [[Color field]] direction of abstract expressionism. Both [[Hans Hofmann]] and [[Robert Motherwell]] can be described as practitioners of [[action painting]] and Color field painting.

During the 1950s ''Color Field painting'' initially referred to a particular type of [[abstract expressionism]], especially the work of Mark Rothko, Clyfford Still, Barnett Newman, [[Robert Motherwell]]  and Adolph Gottlieb. It essentially involved abstract paintings with large, flat expanses of color that expressed the sensual, and visual feelings and properties of large areas of nuanced surface. Art critic Clement Greenberg perceived Color Field painting as related to but different from Action painting. The overall expanse and gestalt of the work of the early color field painters speaks of an almost religious experience, awestruck in the face of an expanding universe of sensuality, color and surface. During the early-to-mid-1960s ''Color Field painting'' came to refer to the styles of artists like [[Jules Olitski]], [[Kenneth Noland]], and [[Helen Frankenthaler]], whose works were related to second-generation abstract expressionism, and to younger artists like [[Larry Zox]], and [[Frank Stella]] – all moving in a new direction.

During the 1930s through the 1960s as abstract painting in America and Europe evolved into movements such as [[abstract expressionism]], Color Field painting, [[Post-painterly Abstraction]], [[Op art]], [[hard-edge painting]], [[Minimal art]], [[shaped canvas]] painting, and [[Lyrical Abstraction]]. Other artists reacted as a response to the tendency toward abstraction allowing imagery to continue through various new contexts like the [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]] in the 1950s and new forms of [[expressionism]] from the 1940s through the 1960s. Throughout the 20th century many painters practiced [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] and used expressive imagery in landscape and figurative painting with contemporary subjects. They include artists as varied as [[Milton Avery]], [[John D. Graham]], [[Fairfield Porter]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Andrew Wyeth]], [[Balthus]], [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], [[Frank Auerbach]], [[Lucian Freud]], [[Leon Kossoff]], [[Philip Pearlstein]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Grace Hartigan]], [[Robert De Niro, Sr.]], and [[Elaine de Kooning]].

In Italy during this time, [[Giorgio Morandi]] was the foremost still-life painter, exploring a wide variety of approaches to depicting everyday bottles and kitchen implements.&lt;ref&gt;David Piper, p. 635&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Arshile Gorky's portrait of Willem de Kooning is an example of the evolution of [[abstract expressionism]] from the context of figure painting, [[cubism]] and [[surrealism]]. Along with his friends de Kooning and [[John D. Graham]] Gorky created bio-morphically shaped and abstracted figurative compositions that by the 1940s evolved into totally abstract paintings. Gorky's work seems to be a careful analysis of memory, emotion and shape, using line and color to express feeling and nature.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, Melissa (2009). "Chronology", in: Michael R. Taylor (ed.), Arshile Gorky: A Retrospective. Philadelphia, Pa.: Philadelphia Museum of Art. {{ISBN|9780876332139}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Rachel (2003). ''Abstract Expressionists''. Chicago: Heinemann Library. {{ISBN|9781588106445}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Study after Velázquez's Portrait of Pope Innocent X]]'', 1953 is a painting by the Irish-born artist [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]] and is an example of Post World War II European [[Expressionism]]. The work shows a distorted version of the [[Portrait of Innocent X]] painted by the Spanish artist [[Diego Velázquez]] in 1650. The work is one of a series of variants of the Velázquez painting which Bacon executed throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, over a total of forty-five works.&lt;ref&gt;Schmied, Wieland (1996). ''Francis Bacon: Commitment and Conflict''. (Munich) Prestel. {{ISBN|3-7913-1664-8}}, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; When asked why he was compelled to revisit the subject so often, Bacon replied that he had nothing against the Popes, that he merely "wanted an excuse to use these colours, and you can't give ordinary clothes that purple colour without getting into a sort of false [[Fauvism|fauve]] manner."&lt;ref&gt;Peppiatt, Michael, ''Anatomy of an Enigma''. Westview Press. {{ISBN|0-8133-3520-5}} (1996), p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; The Pope in this version seethes with anger and aggression, and the dark colors give the image a grotesque and nightmarish appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Schmied (1996), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; The pleated curtains of the backdrop are rendered transparent, and seem to fall through the Pope's face.&lt;ref&gt;Peppiatt (1996), p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

The figurative work of Francis Bacon, Frida Kahlo, Edward Hopper, Lucian Freud, Andrew Wyeth and others served as a kind of alternative to abstract expressionism. ''[[Nighthawks]]'' (1942) is a realist painting by Edward Hopper that portrays people sitting in a downtown [[diner]] late at night. It is not only Hopper's most famous painting, but one of the most recognizable in American art. The urban street is empty outside the diner, and inside none of the three patrons is apparently looking or talking to the others but instead is lost in their own thoughts. This portrayal of modern urban life as empty or lonely is a common theme throughout Hopper's work. One of the most well-known images in 20th-century American art is Wyeth's tempera painting, ''[[Christina's World]]'', in the collection of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in [[New York City]]. It depicts a woman lying on the ground in a treeless, mostly tawny field, looking up at and crawling towards a gray house on the horizon; a barn and various other small outbuildings are adjacent to the house.&lt;ref name="moma"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?object_id=78455 ''Christina's World''] in the [[Museum of Modern Art|MoMA]] Online Collection&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II the term [[School of Paris]] often referred to [[Tachisme]], the European equivalent of American Abstract expressionism and those artists are also related to [[COBRA (avant-garde movement)|Cobra]]. Important proponents being [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Pierre Soulages]], [[Nicolas de Staël]], [[Hans Hartung]], [[Serge Poliakoff]], and [[Georges Mathieu]], among several others. During the early 1950s Dubuffet (who was always a figurative artist) and de Staël abandoned abstraction, and returned to imagery via figuration and landscape. De Staël's return to representation (seascapes, footballers, jazz musicians, seagulls) during the early 1950s can be seen as an influential precedent for the American [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]], as many of those abstract painters like [[Richard Diebenkorn]], [[David Park (painter)|David Park]], [[Elmer Bischoff]], [[Wayne Thiebaud]], [[Nathan Oliveira]], [[Joan Brown]] and others made a similar move; returning to imagery during the mid-1950s. Much of de Staël's late work – in particular his abstract landscapes of the mid-1950s – predicts Color Field painting and [[Lyrical Abstraction]] of the 1960s and 1970s. Milton Avery as well through his use of color and his interest in seascape and landscape paintings connected with the Color field aspect of Abstract expressionism as manifested by [[Adolph Gottlieb]] and [[Mark Rothko]] as well as the lessons American painters took from the work of [[Henri Matisse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Glueck |first=Grace |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DEEDA1139F934A35752C0A9639C8B63&amp;ref=miltonavery |title=NY Times, Grace Glueck, Art in Review; '&amp;#39;Milton Avery – Onrushing Waves'&amp;#39; |publisher=New York Times |date=2005-01-07 |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hilton Kramer |url=http://observer.com/2002/05/the-summer-of-57-with-milton-avery-gottlieb-rothko/ |title=Hilton Kramer, NY Observer, '&amp;#39;Summer of 57 with Avery, Gottlieb, Rothko'&amp;#39; |publisher=Observer.com |date=2002-05-13 |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pop art====
&lt;!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: DO NOT ADD YOUR OWN NAME TO THIS LIST! --&gt;
[[Pop art]] in America was to a large degree initially inspired by the works of [[Jasper Johns]], [[Larry Rivers]], and [[Robert Rauschenberg]], although the paintings of [[Gerald Murphy]], [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]] and [[Charles Demuth]] during the 1920s and 1930s foreshadow the style and subject matter of Pop art. 

In New York City during the mid-1950s, Rauschenberg and Johns created works of art that at first seemed to be continuations of [[Abstract expressionist]] painting. Actually their works, and the work of Larry Rivers, were radical departures from abstract expressionism especially in the use of banal and literal imagery and the inclusion of mundane materials into their work. Johns' use of various images and objects like chairs, numbers, targets, beer cans and the [[American Flag]]; Rivers' paintings of subjects drawn from popular culture such as [[George Washington]] crossing the [[Delaware River|Delaware]], and his inclusions of images from advertisements like the camel from [[Camel cigarettes]]; and Rauschenberg's surprising constructions using inclusions of objects and pictures taken from popular culture, hardware stores, junkyards, the city streets, and [[taxidermy]], gave rise to a radical new movement in American art. Eventually by 1963 the movement came to be known worldwide as Pop art.

Pop art is exemplified by the artists [[Andy Warhol]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Wayne Thiebaud]], [[James Rosenquist]], [[Jim Dine]], [[Tom Wesselmann]] and [[Roy Lichtenstein]] among others. Lichtenstein used oil and [[Magna paint]] in works such as ''[[Drowning Girl]]'' (1963; [[Museum of Modern Art, New York]]), which was appropriated from the lead story in [[DC Comics]]' ''Secret Hearts'' #83.&lt;ref name="rlf-Hendrickson31"&gt;{{harvnb|Hendrickson| 1988| p= 31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) Thick outlines, bold colors and [[Ben-Day dots]] reproduce the appearance of commercial printing. Lichtenstein would say of his own work: Abstract Expressionists "put things down on the canvas and responded to what they had done, to the color positions and sizes. My style looks completely different, but the nature of putting down lines pretty much is the same; mine just don't come out looking calligraphic, like Pollock's or Kline's."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pop art merges popular and mass culture with fine art, while injecting humor, irony, and recognizable imagery and content into the mix. In October 1962 the [[Sidney Janis]] Gallery mounted ''The New Realists'', the first major Pop art group exhibition in an uptown art gallery in New York City. The show sent shockwaves through the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] and reverberated worldwide. ''[[Campbell's Soup Cans]]'' (sometimes referred to as ''32 Campbell's Soup Cans'') is the title of an [[Andy Warhol]] work of art that was produced in 1962. It consists of thirty-two canvases of equal size, each consisting of a painting of a [[Campbell Soup Company|Campbell's Soup]] can—one of each [[canned soup]] variety the company offered at the time. The individual paintings were produced with a semi-mechanised [[silkscreen]] process, using a non-[[painterly]] style. They helped usher in Pop art as a major art movement that relied on themes from [[popular culture]].

Earlier in England in 1956 the term ''Pop Art'' was used by [[Lawrence Alloway]] for paintings that celebrated consumerism of the post World War II era. This movement rejected Abstract expressionism and its focus on the hermeneutic and psychological interior, in favor of art which depicted material consumer culture, advertising, and iconography of the mass production age.&lt;ref&gt;Topics in American Art since 1945, ''Pop art the words'', pp. 119–122, by [[Lawrence Alloway]], copyright 1975 by [[W. W. Norton and Company]], NYC {{ISBN|0-393-04401-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early works of English artist [[David Hockney]], such as ''[[A Bigger Splash]]'', and the works of [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]], [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]], and [[Eduardo Paolozzi]], are considered seminal examples in the movement.
In New York's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] [[Tenth street galleries|10th Street galleries]] artists were formulating an American version of Pop art. [[Claes Oldenburg]] had his storefront, and the [[Green Gallery]] on 57th Street began to show [[Tom Wesselmann]] and [[James Rosenquist]]. There is a connection between the radical works of Duchamp, and [[Man Ray]], the rebellious Dadaists – with a sense of humor; and Pop Artists like [[Alex Katz]], Claes Oldenburg, Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and the others.

[[File:'Still Life with Cup', oil on canvas painting by Paul Wonner, 1959, private collection.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Paul Wonner]], 1959, [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]]]] 
During the 1950s and 1960s as abstract painting in America and Europe evolved into movements such as [[Color Field]] painting, [[Post painterly abstraction]], [[Op art]], [[hard-edge painting]], [[Minimal art]], [[shaped canvas]] painting, [[Lyrical Abstraction]], and the continuation of Abstract expressionism. Other artists reacted as a response to the tendency toward abstraction with [[Outsider art|Art brut]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Dubuffet]]: ''L’Art brut préféré aux arts culturels'' [1949] {{en icon}} ''Art brut. Madness and Marginalia'', special issue of ''Art &amp; Text'', No. 27, 1987, pp. 31–33)&lt;/ref&gt; as seen in ''Court les rues,'' 1962, by [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Fluxus]], [[Neo-Dada]], [[New Realism]], [[Photorealism]], allowing imagery to re-emerge through various new contexts like [[Pop art]], the [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]] (a prime example is Diebenkorn's ''Cityscape I,(Landscape No. 1)'' (1963), and later in the 1970s [[Neo-expressionism]]. The [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]] of whom [[David Park (painter)|David Park]], [[Elmer Bischoff]], [[Nathan Oliveira]] and [[Richard Diebenkorn]] whose painting ''Cityscape 1'' (1963) is a typical example, were influential members flourished during the 1950s and 1960s in California. Younger painters practiced the use of imagery in new and radical ways. [[Yves Klein]], [[Arman]], [[Martial Raysse]], [[Christo]], [[Niki de Saint Phalle]], [[David Hockney]], [[Alex Katz]], [[Malcolm Morley]], [[Ralph Goings]], [[Audrey Flack]], [[Richard Estes]], [[Chuck Close]], [[Susan Rothenberg]], [[Eric Fischl]], and [[Vija Celmins]] were a few who became prominent between the 1960s and the 1980s. [[Fairfield Porter]] was largely self-taught, and produced representational work in the midst of the Abstract Expressionist movement. His subjects were primarily landscapes, domestic interiors and portraits of family, friends and fellow artists.

Also during the 1960s and 1970s, there was a reaction against painting. Critics like Douglas Crimp viewed the work of artists like [[Ad Reinhardt]], and declared the "death of painting". Artists began to practice new ways of making art. New movements gained prominence some of which are: [[Fluxus]], [[Happening]], [[Video art]], [[Installation art]] [[Mail art]], the [[situationists]], [[Conceptual art]], [[Postminimalism]], [[Earth art]], [[arte povera]], [[performance art]] and [[body art]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Crimp, ''The End of Painting'', October, Vol. 16, Spring, 1981, pp. 69–86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Crimp, ''On the Museum's Ruins'', Cambridge, Mass., 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Neo-Dada is also a movement that started in the 1950s and 1960s and was related to Abstract expressionism only with imagery. This trend, in which manufactured items are combined with artist materials, is exemplified by the work of [[Jasper Johns]] and [[Robert Rauschenberg]]. Rauschenberg's "combines" in the 1950s were forerunners of Pop Art and [[Installation art]], and made use of the assemblage of large physical objects, including stuffed animals, birds and commercial photography. Rauschenberg, Johns, [[Larry Rivers]], [[John Chamberlain (sculptor)|John Chamberlain]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]], [[Jim Dine]], and [[Edward Kienholz]] among others created new conventions of art-making; they made acceptable in serious contemporary art circles the radical inclusion of unlikely materials as parts of their works of art.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Craft, ''An Audience of Artists: Dada, Neo-Dada, and the Emergence of Abstract Expressionism'', University of Chicago, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Susan Hapgood, ''Neo-Dada: Redefining Art, 1958–62'', Universe Books and American Federation of Arts, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1960s and 1970s abstract painting continued to develop in America through varied styles. [[Geometric abstraction]], Op art, [[hard-edge painting]], Color Field painting and [[Minimalism|minimal]] painting, were some interrelated directions for advanced abstract painting as well as some other new movements. [[Morris Louis]] was an important pioneer in advanced [[Colorfield painting]], his work can serve as a bridge between [[Abstract expressionism]], Colorfield painting, and [[Minimal Art]].  Two influential teachers, [[Josef Albers]] and [[Hans Hofmann]], introduced a new generation of American artists to their advanced theories of color and space. Albers is best remembered for his work as a [[Geometric abstraction]]ist painter and theorist. Most famous of all are the hundreds of paintings and prints that make up the series ''Homage to the Square''. In this rigorous series, begun in 1949, Albers explored chromatic interactions with flat colored squares arranged concentrically on the canvas.  Albers' theories on art and education were formative for the next generation of artists.  His own paintings form the foundation of both hard-edge painting and Op art.

Josef Albers, Hans Hofmann, [[Ilya Bolotowsky]], [[Burgoyne Diller]], [[Victor Vasarely]], [[Bridget Riley]], [[Richard Anuszkiewicz]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Kenneth Noland]],&lt;ref&gt;Terry Fenton, online essay about [[Kenneth Noland]], and [[acrylic paint]], [http://www.sharecom.ca/noland/materials Sharecom.ca], accessed 30 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[John McLaughlin (artist)|John McLaughlin]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[John Hoyland]], [[Larry Zox]], [[Al Held]], [[Mino Argento]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-01-22/entertainment/ca-25065_1_geometric-shapes | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Cathy | last=Curtis | title=Wilshire Center | date=22 January 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; are artists closely associated with [[Geometric abstraction]], Op art, Color Field painting, and in the case of Hofmann and Newman Abstract expressionism as well. [[Agnes Martin]], [[Robert Mangold]], [[Brice Marden]], [[Jo Baer]], [[Robert Ryman]], [[Richard Tuttle]], Neil Williams, David Novros, Paul Mogenson, are examples of artists associated with Minimalism and (exceptions of Martin, Baer and Marden) the use of the [[shaped canvas]] also during the period beginning in the early 1960s. Many [[Geometric abstract art]]ists, minimalists, and Hard-edge painters elected to use the edges of the image to define the shape of the painting rather than accepting the rectangular format. In fact, the use of the shaped canvas is primarily associated with paintings of the 1960s and 1970s that are coolly abstract, formalistic, geometrical, objective, rationalistic, clean-lined, brashly sharp-edged, or minimalist in character. The [[Bykert Gallery]], and the [[Park Place Gallery]] were important showcases for Minimalism and shaped canvas painting in New York City during the 1960s.

[[File:Gardenofdelight.jpg|thumb|120px|left|[[Ronnie Landfield]], 1971, [[Lyrical Abstraction]]]]
Color Field painting pointed toward a new direction in American painting, away from [[abstract expressionism]]. Related to [[Post-painterly abstraction]], [[Suprematism]], Abstract Expressionism, [[Hard-edge painting]] and [[Lyrical Abstraction]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sbmuseart.org/exhibitions/colorscope.web&lt;/ref&gt; Color Field painting sought to rid art of superfluous rhetoric. Artists like [[Clyfford Still]], [[Mark Rothko]], Hans Hofmann, [[Morris Louis]], [[Jules Olitski]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Larry Zox]], and others painted with a highly articulated and psychological use of color. In general these artists eliminated recognizable imagery. Certain artists made references to past or present art, but in general color field painting presents abstraction as an end in itself. In pursuing this direction of [[modern art]], artists wanted to present each painting as one cohesive, monolithic image. [[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]] along with Kenneth Noland, Morris Louis and several others was a member of the [[Washington Color School]] painters who began to create [[Color Field painting]]s in Washington, D.C. during the 1950s and 1960s, ''Black, Grey, Beat'' is a large vertical stripe painting and typical of Gene Davis's work.
[[Frank Stella]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], Barnett Newman, [[Ronald Davis]], [[Neil Williams (artist)|Neil Williams]], [[Robert Mangold]], [[Charles Hinman]], [[Richard Tuttle]], David Novros, and Al Loving are examples of artists associated with the use of the [[shaped canvas]] during the period beginning in the early 1960s.

From 1960 Frank Stella produced paintings in aluminum and copper paint and his first works using shaped canvases (canvases in a shape other than the traditional rectangle or square), often being in L, N, U or T-shapes. These later developed into more elaborate designs, in the ''Irregular Polygon'' series (1967), for example. Later he began his ''Protractor Series'' (1971) of paintings, in which [[circle|arcs]], sometimes overlapping, within square borders are arranged side-by-side to produce full and half circles painted in rings of concentric color. ''Harran II,'' 1967, is an example of the ''Protractor Series''.

The Andre Emmerich Gallery, the [[Leo Castelli]] Gallery, the Richard Feigen Gallery, and the [[Park Place Gallery]] were important showcases for Color Field painting, shaped canvas painting and [[Lyrical Abstraction]] in New York City during the 1960s. There is a connection with [[post-painterly abstraction]], which reacted against abstract expressionisms' mysticism, hyper-subjectivity, and emphasis on making the act of painting itself dramatically visible – as well as the solemn acceptance of the flat rectangle as an almost ritual prerequisite for serious painting. During the 1960s Color Field painting and [[Minimal art]] were often closely associated with each other. In actuality by the early 1970s both movements became decidedly diverse.

Lyrical Abstraction (the term being coined by Larry Aldrich, the founder of the [[Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum]], Ridgefield Connecticut), encompassed what Aldrich said he saw in the studios of many artists at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich, Larry. Young Lyrical Painters, Art in America, v.57, n6, November–December 1969, pp. 104–113.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also the name of an exhibition that originated in the Aldrich Museum and traveled to the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] and other museums throughout the United States between 1969 and 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Lyrical Abstraction, Exhibition Catalogue, the Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art, Ridgefield, Connecticut 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; Lyrical Abstraction is a type of freewheeling abstract painting that emerged in the mid-1960s when abstract painters returned to various forms of painterly, pictorial, expressionism with a predominate focus on process, gestalt and repetitive compositional strategies in general.&lt;ref&gt;The Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art, ''Lyrical Abstraction,'' exhibition: 5 April through 7 June 1970&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Lyrical Abstraction'' Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, 25 May – 6 July 1971&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to Action Painting, where emphasis is on brushstrokes and high compositional drama, in Lyrical Abstraction—as exemplified by the 1971 [[Ronnie Landfield]] painting ''Garden of Delight''—there is a sense of compositional randomness, relaxed compositional drama and an emphasis on process, repetition, and an all over sensibility. Lyrical Abstraction in the late 1960s is characterized by the paintings of [[Dan Christensen]], Ronnie Landfield, [[Peter Young (artist)|Peter Young]] and others, and along with the [[Fluxus]] movement and [[Postminimalism]] (a term first coined by Robert Pincus-Witten in the pages of [[Artforum]] in 1969)&lt;ref name="Shakers, New York 2007"&gt;''Movers and Shakers, New York'', "Leaving C&amp;M", by Sarah Douglas, Art and Auction, March 2007, V.XXXNo7.&lt;/ref&gt;  sought to expand the boundaries of abstract painting and Minimalism by focusing on process, new materials and new ways of expression. Postminimalism often incorporating industrial materials, raw materials, fabrications, found objects, installation, serial repetition, and often with references to Dada and Surrealism is best exemplified in the sculptures of [[Eva Hesse]].&lt;ref name="Shakers, New York 2007" /&gt; Lyrical Abstraction, [[Conceptual Art]], Postminimalism, [[Earth Art]], Video, [[Performance art]], [[Installation art]], along with the continuation of Fluxus, Abstract Expressionism, Color Field painting, Hard-edge painting, Minimal Art, Op art, Pop art, [[Photorealism]] and [[New Realism]] extended the boundaries of [[Contemporary Art]] in the mid-1960s through the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Ann Ray, and Howard Junker.

====Abstract Illusionism, Monochrome, Minimalism, Postminimalism====

[[File:Ring of Ronald Davis.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Ronald Davis]], ''Ring'', 1968, [[Abstract Illusionism]]]]
One of the first artists specifically associated with Minimalism was [[Frank Stella]], whose early "stripe" paintings were highlighted in the 1959 show, "16 Americans", organized by Dorothy Miller at the [[Museum of Modern Art in New York]]. The widths of the stripes in Stella's stripe paintings were not entirely subjective, but were determined by the dimensions of the lumber used to construct the supportive chassis upon which the canvas was stretched. In the show catalog, [[Carl Andre]] noted, "Art excludes the unnecessary. Frank Stella has found it necessary to paint stripes. There is nothing else in his painting." These reductive works were in sharp contrast to the energy-filled and apparently emotionally charged paintings of [[Willem de Kooning]] or [[Franz Kline]] and leaned more toward less gestural coloristic field paintings of [[Barnett Newman]] and [[Mark Rothko]].

Artists such as [[Larry Poons]]—whose work related to Op Art with his emphasis on dots, ovals and after-images bouncing across color fields—[[Kenneth Noland]], Ralph Humphrey, [[Robert Motherwell]] and [[Robert Ryman]] had also begun to explore stripes, [[monochromatic]] and [[Hard-edge]] formats from the late 1950s through the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/384056/minimalism Britannica.com], "Minimalism"&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of a tendency in Minimalism to exclude the pictorial, illusionistic and fictive in favor of the literal—as demonstrated by [[Robert Mangold]], who understood the concept of the shape of the canvas and its relationship to ''objecthood''—there was a movement away from painterly and toward sculptural concerns. [[Donald Judd]] had started as a painter, and ended as a creator of objects. His seminal essay, "Specific Objects" (published in Arts Yearbook 8, 1965), was a touchstone of theory for the formation of Minimalist aesthetics. In this essay, Judd found a starting point for a new territory for American art, and a simultaneous rejection of residual inherited European artistic values.  He pointed to evidence of this development in the works of an array of artists active in New York at the time, including Jasper Johns, Dan Flavin and Lee Bontecou. Of "preliminary" importance for Judd was the work of [[George Earl Ortman]] [http://brooklynrail.org/2006/12/artseen/ortman], who had concretized and distilled painting's forms into blunt, tough, philosophically charged geometries. These Specific Objects inhabited a space not then comfortably classifiable as either painting or sculpture. That the categorical identity of such objects was itself in question, and that they avoided easy association with well-worn and over-familiar conventions, was a part of their value for Judd.

In a much more general sense, one might find European roots of Minimalism in the [[geometric abstraction]]s painters in the [[Bauhaus]], in the works of [[Piet Mondrian]] and other artists associated with the movement DeStijl, in [[Constructivism (art)|Russian Constructivists]] and in the work of the Romanian sculptor [[Constantin Brâncuși]]. American painters such as [[Brice Marden]] and [[Cy Twombly]] show a clear European influence in their ''pure'' abstraction, minimalist painting of the 1960s. Ronald Davis polyurethane works from the late 1960s pay homage to the ''Broken Glass'' of [[Marcel Duchamp]]''.
This movement was heavily criticised by high modernist formalist art critics and historians. Some anxious critics thought Minimalist art represented a misunderstanding of the modern dialectic of painting and sculpture as defined by critic [[Clement Greenberg]], arguably the dominant American critic of painting in the period leading up to the 1960s. The most notable critique of Minimalism was produced by [[Michael Fried (Art Critic)|Michael Fried]], a Greenbergian critic, who objected to the work on the basis of its "theatricality". In ''Art and Objecthood'' (published in Artforum in June 1967) he declared that the Minimalist work of art, particularly Minimalist sculpture, was based on an engagement with the physicality of the spectator. He argued that work like Robert Morris's transformed the act of viewing into a type of [[spectacle]], in which the artifice of the act [[observation]] and the viewer's participation in the work were unveiled. Fried saw this displacement of the viewer's experience from an aesthetic engagement within, to an event outside of the artwork as a failure of Minimal art.

[[Ad Reinhardt]], actually an artist of the [[Abstract Expressionist]] generation, but one whose [[reductionism|reductive]] all-black paintings seemed to anticipate minimalism, had this to say about the value of a reductive approach to art: "The more stuff in it, the busier the work of art, the worse it is. More is less. Less is more. The eye is a menace to clear sight. The laying bare of oneself is obscene. Art begins with the getting rid of nature."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artnews.com/2015/01/24/less-is-more-ad-reinhardts-twelve-rules-for-pure-art/ ''Less Is More: Ad Reinhardt's 12 Rules for Pure Art''], The Editors of ARTnews, 24 January 2015 (based on a paper read at the 45th annual meeting of the College Art Association at the Detroit Institute of Art, 26 January 1957)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1960s and 1970s artists as powerful and influential as [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Phillip Guston]], [[Lee Krasner]], [[Richard Diebenkorn]], [[Elmer Bischoff]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]], [[Joan Mitchell]], [[Friedel Dzubas]], and younger artists like [[Sam Gilliam]], [[Sean Scully]], [[Pat Steir]], [[Elizabeth Murray (artist)|Elizabeth Murray]], [[Walter Darby Bannard]], [[Dan Christensen]], Joan Snyder, [[Richard Tuttle]], [[Ross Bleckner]], [[Archie Rand]], [[Susan Crile]], and dozens of others produced vital and influential paintings.

Still other important innovations in abstract painting took place during the 1960s and the 1970s characterized by [[Monochrome painting]] and [[Hard-edge painting]] inspired by [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Milton Resnick]], and Ellsworth Kelly. Artists as diversified as [[Al Held]], [[Larry Zox]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Brice Marden]] and others explored the power of simplification. The convergence of [[Color Field]] painting, Minimal art, Hard-edge painting, Lyrical Abstraction, and Postminimalism blurred the distinction between movements that became more apparent in the 1980s and 1990s. The [[Neo-expressionism]] movement is related to earlier developments in Abstract expressionism, [[Neo-Dada]], Lyrical Abstraction and Postminimal painting.

====Neo-expressionism====
&lt;!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: DO NOT ADD YOUR OWN NAME TO THIS LIST! --&gt;
In the late 1960s the abstract expressionist painter [[Philip Guston]] helped to lead a transition from abstract expressionism to [[Neo-expressionism]] in painting, abandoning the so-called "pure abstraction" of abstract expressionism in favor of more cartoonish renderings of various personal symbols and objects. These works were inspirational to a new generation of painters interested in a revival of expressive imagery.&lt;ref name="Neo-Expressionism, The Art Story"&gt;[http://www.theartstory.org/movement-neo-expressionism.htm Neo-Expressionism, The Art Story]&lt;/ref&gt; His painting ''Painting, Smoking, Eating'' is an example of Guston's return to representation.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was also a return to painting that occurred almost simultaneously in Italy, Germany, France and [[UK|Britain]]. These movements were called [[Transavantguardia]], [[Neue Wilde]], [[Figuration Libre]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=188 |title=Tate online glossary |publisher=Tate.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neo-expressionism]], the school of London, and in the late 80s the [[Stuckists]] respectively. These painting were characterized by large formats, free expressive mark making, figuration, myth and imagination.  All work in this genre came to be labeled [[neo-expressionism]].

Neo-expressionism was a style of [[Modernism|modern]] painting that became popular in the late 1970s and dominated the art market until the mid-1980s. It developed in Europe as a reaction against the conceptual and [[minimalism|minimalistic]] art of the 1960s and 1970s. Neo-expressionists returned to portraying recognizable objects, such as the human body (although sometimes in a virtually abstract manner) in a rough and violently emotional way using vivid colors and banal color harmonies. The veteran painters Philip Guston, [[Frank Auerbach]], [[Leon Kossoff]], [[Gerhard Richter]], [[A. R. Penck]] and [[Georg Baselitz]], along with the slightly younger artists [[Damien Hirst]], [[Anselm Kiefer]], the Americans [[Eric Fischl]], [[Susan Rothenberg]], [[David Salle]], [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]], [[Julian Schnabel]], and [[Keith Haring]], the Italians [[Francesco Clemente]], [[Mimmo Paladino]], [[Sandro Chia]], and [[Enzo Cucchi]], and many others became known for working in this intense expressionist vein of painting. Critical reaction was divided. Some critics regarded it as driven by profit motivations by large commercial galleries.&lt;ref name="Neo-Expressionism, The Art Story"/&gt;

Anselm Kiefer is a leading figure in European Neo-expressionism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theartstory.org/artist-kiefer-anselm.htm The Art Story, Artist Anselm Kiefer]&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1980s, Kiefer's themes widened from a focus on Germany's role in civilization to the fate of art and culture in general. His work became more sculptural and involves not only national identity and [[collective memory]], but also [[occult]] symbolism, [[theology]] and [[mysticism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/anselm-kiefer-1406 Fiefer, Tate]&lt;/ref&gt; The theme of all the work is the trauma experienced by entire societies, and the continual rebirth and renewal in life.
&lt;!-- Commented out: [[File:Rothhorse2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Susan Rothenberg]], 1979, [[Neo-expressionism]]]] --&gt;

Painting still holds a respected position in [[contemporary art]]. Art is an open field no longer divided by the objective versus non-objective dichotomy. Artists can achieve critical success whether their images are representational or abstract. What has currency is content, exploring the boundaries of the medium, and a refusal to recapitulate the works of the past as an end goal.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Esmann, F. Scott Hess, ''21st Century Figurative Art: The Resurrection of Art'', BookBaby Print, Nov 5, 2016, {{ISBN|1483582590}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Hyman, ''The World New Made: Figurative Painting in the Twentieth Century'', Thames &amp; Hudson, 2016, {{ISBN|0500239452}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Paulson, ''Figure and abstraction in contemporary painting'', Rutgers University Press, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 20th century and into the 21st century, with the advent of [[Modernist art|Modern]] and [[Postmodern art|Postmodern]] art forms, distinctions between what is generally regarded as the [[fine arts]] and the [[low culture|low arts]] have started to fade,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ideas About Art |last= Desmond |first=Kathleen K. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iP4sA3kwcFsC&amp;dq=ideas+about+art&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2011 | page= 148}}&lt;/ref&gt; as contemporary high art continues to challenge these concepts by mixing with [[popular culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=International postmodernism: theory and literary practice |last= Bertens |first=Hans |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n_Eqx2Gr1vUC&amp;dq=international+postmodernism:+theory+and+literary+practice&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |publisher= Routledge |year=1997 |page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent history of changes in women's roles includes having [[women in the military]] in many countries.

==Africa==

=== Algeria ===
The presence of female soldiers in the Algerian army was of crucial importance during [[Women in the Algerian War|the Algerian revolution]] against colonial France, some of the most prominent figures and symbols of the National Liberation Front were female combatants. 

[[Fatima Zohra Ardjoune]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Par Mounir Kechar |url=http://www.algerlablanche.com/index.php?post/Pr-Fatima-Zohra-Ardjoune%2C-la-premi%C3%A8re-femme-g%C3%A9n%C3%A9ral-de-l-arm%C3%A9e-alg%C3%A9rienne |title=Pr Fatima Zohra Ardjoune, la première femme général de l'armée algérienne - Alger La Blanche - Le Portail de l'Algérie |publisher=Alger La Blanche |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  director general of the Ain Naâdja military hospital, was promoted to general, the first woman in the Algerian People’s National Army (PNA)—and in the Arab world—to reach this rank. Three years later, Fatima Boudouani &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.middleeastobserver.org/2017/03/03/algerias-interest-in-world-security-stems-from-international-solidarity-principle-official/ |title=Algeria's interest in world security stems from international solidarity principle: Official |publisher=Middle East Observer |date= |accessdate=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; became the second woman to be promoted to the rank of general in the [[wikipedia:People's National Army (Algeria)|PNA]], and she was followed by three more women in 2015, therefore becoming the Arab country with the biggest number of high-ranking female army commanders. &lt;ref name="muftah1"&gt;https://muftah.org/women-in-the-algerian-military-then-and-now/#.WTtiP-s1_IU&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="alarabiya1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/2014/07/09/Algeria-appoints-four-female-army-generals-.html |title=Algeria appoints four female army generals |publisher=Al Arabiya English |date=2014-07-09 |accessdate=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four generals were also promoted to the rank of major-general. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Algerian-woman-becomes-countrys-first-female-general |title=Algerian woman becomes country's first female general - Middle East - Jerusalem Post |publisher=Jpost.com |date=2009-07-05 |accessdate=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aardjoun's promotion reflects a growing trend of Algerian women taking more prominent positions in the workforce, most notably in the police and military. Algeria boasts the largest number of female police officers in the Muslim world. The status of women in the military had been made legally equal to that of men in an ordinance on February 28, 2006, and the military’s promotions of women from 2009 to 2015 broke an apparent taboo. The army has since put in place a formal policy framework for equal opportunities, and efforts have been made to apply it. &lt;ref name="muftah1"/&gt;

Since 2005, Bouteflika has been under pressure to enact more changes in favor of women’s rights. &lt;ref name="alarabiya1"/&gt;

===Eritrea===
Female soldiers in Eritrea played a large role in both the Eritrean civil war and the border dispute with Ethiopia, because they make up more than 30% of the Eritrean military. They also serve in direct combat operations.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

===Libya===
A 200-strong unit was [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]]'s personal bodyguard and is called variously the "Green Nuns" and "The Amazonian Guard" or more commonly in [[Libya]] [[The Revolutionary Nuns]] ({{lang-ar|الراهبات الثوريات}}) .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article3052655.ece?token=null&amp;offset=0 TimesOnline: ''Adieu, Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, a tricky guest''] Accessed 29 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
[[File:Africa Aerospace and Defense 2010 (5093447570).jpg|thumb|right|Female [[South African National Defence Force]] members speak with an American soldier during the [[Africa Aerospace and Defence]] expo in 2010.]]
South African women have a long history of service in the [[South African Defence Force]] (SADF) and in the modern [[South African National Defence Force]] (SANDF). In [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] women served in auxiliary roles in the [[South African Defence Force]] and were assigned to non-combat active roles after 1970. In 1914 a volunteer nursing service was established by the army and 328 nurses to serve with South African troops in [[Europe]] and [[East Africa]] in World War I. The Women's Auxiliary Army Service began accepting women recruits in 1916. Officials estimated that women volunteers relieved 12,000 men for combat in World War I by assuming clerical and other duties. During World War II, South Africa had five service organizations for women—the South African Military Nursing Service, and women's auxiliaries attached to the army, the navy, the air force, and the military police.

During the late 1970s and 1980s, women were active in civil defence organizations and were being trained as part of the country's general mobilization against possible terrorist attacks. In 1989, for example, the Johannesburg Civil Defence Program provided training for 800 civil defense volunteers, about one-half of whom were women. These classes included such subjects as weapons training for self-defense, antiriot procedures, traffic and crowd control, first aid, and fire-fighting. An unreported number of women also received instruction in counterinsurgency techniques and commando operations. Women also served in military elements of liberation militias in the 1970s and the 1980s, and women were accepted into the [[ANC]]'s military wing, [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]] (Spear of the Nation, also known as Umkhonto—MK), throughout the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement|anti-apartheid struggle]].

In 1995 women of all races were being incorporated into the [[South African National Defence Force]] (SANDF), and a woman officer, Brigadier Jackie Sedibe, was appointed to oversee the implementation of new SANDF policies concerning the treatment of women. Women had been promoted as high as warrant officers and brigadiers in the Permanent Force by the early 1990s, but only ten women were SADF colonels in 1994. In 1996 Brigadier Sedibe became the first woman in the military to be promoted to the rank of major general. Widespread cultural attitudes in the 1990s still oppose the idea of women in combat, but officials are debating ways to assign women an equitable share of the leadership positions in the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mongabay.com/history/south_africa/south_africa-women_in_the_military_homeland_militaries.html|title=South Africa-Women in the Military Homeland Militaries|website=www.mongabay.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 almost 26.6% of the uniformed services of the South African National Defence Force consisted of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defenceweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=16708:fact-file-sandf-regular-force-levels-by-race-a-gender-april-30-2011-&amp;catid=79:fact-files&amp;Itemid=159|title=Fact file: SANDF regular force levels by race &amp; gender: April 30, 2011  - defenceWeb|first=Leon|last=Engelbrecht|website=www.defenceweb.co.za}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All roles in the Australian Defence Force are open to women. The first women became involved with the Australian armed forces with the creation of the Army Nursing Service in 1899. On the 30th of June 2017, women were found to make up 16.5% of the [[Australian Defence Force]] (with 20.6% in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]], 20.4% in the [[Royal Australian Navy]] and 13.2% in the [[Australian Army]]).&lt;ref name="Women in the ADF Report 2016-2017"&gt;http://www.defence.gov.au/annualreports/16-17/Downloads/WomenInTheADFReport2016-17.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; However, up until 2016, only 74% of the total number of available roles in the Australian armed forces were available to women. Despite this, using 1998-99 figures, the ADF had the highest percentage of women in its employ in the world.&lt;ref name="aph.gov.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/Publications_Archive/archive/womenarmed |title=Women in the armed forces: the role of women in the Australian Defence Force – Parliament of Australia |publisher=Aph.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, Australia became the fourth nation in the world to allow women to serve on its submarines.

Australia was the fourth country to permit female crew on submarines, doing so in June 1998 on board [[Collins class submarine]]s. Australia's first deployment of female sailors in a combat zone was aboard [[HMAS Westralia (O 195)|HMAS ''Westralia'']] in the [[Persian Gulf]] during the [[Gulf War|1991 Gulf War]].

On 27 September 2011, Defence Minister Stephen Smith announced that women will be allowed to serve in frontline combat roles by 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-09-27/women-on-the-frontline/2946258|title=Women cleared to serve in combat|publisher=ABC News|date=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, allegations of alleged sexual harassment on board [[HMAS Swan (DE 50)|HMAS ''Swan'']] were investigated, and in 1998 similar allegations arose in the [[Australian Defence Force Academy]].

[[File:Israeli military police women stand in formation during an honor cordon ceremony for Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates in Tel Aviv.JPEG|thumb|Israeli military police women (2007)]]
Some women served in various positions in the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]], including infantry, radio operators and transport pilots in the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War|1948 war of independence]] and the [[Suez Crisis]] in 1956, but later the Air Force closed its ranks to female pilots, and women were restricted from combat positions. There is a draft of both men and women. Most women serve in non-combat positions, and are conscripted for two years (instead of three years for men). A landmark high court appeal in 1994 forced the Air Force to accept women air cadets. In 2001, Israel's first female combat pilot received her wings. In 1999 the [[Caracal Battalion|Caracal]] company was formed, as a non segregated infantry company. In 2000 it was expanded into a Battalion (called The 33rd, for the 33 women killed in combat during the War of Independence) since then, further combat positions have opened to women, including Artillery, Field Intelligence, Search and Rescue, NBC, Border Patrol, K-9 Unit and anti-aircraft warfare.

On May 26, 2011, [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] Chief of Staff [[Benny Gantz]] announced Brigadier General [[Orna Barbivay]]'s appointment as the next Head of the IDF Personnel Directorate. Barbivay was promoted to [[Major General]], thus becoming the most senior female officer in the history of the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]].

===Japan===
[[File:Jsdf-候補生（新隊員前期）.jpg|thumb|Female candidates of the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]] (2011).]]
When the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]] (JSDF), postwar armed forces of [[Japan]], was originally formed, women were recruited exclusively for the nursing services. Opportunities were expanded somewhat when women were permitted to join the [[Japan Ground Self-Defense Force]] (JGSDF; army) communication service in 1967, the [[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force]] (JMSDF; navy) and [[Japan Air Self-Defense Force]] (JASDF; air force) communication services in 1974. By 1991, more than 6,000 women were in the JSDF, about 80% of service areas, except those requiring direct exposure to combat, were open to them. The National Defense Medical College graduated its first class with women in March 1991, and the [[National Defense Academy of Japan]] began admitting women in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Japan Focus|url=http://japanfocus.org/-Fumika-Sato/3820|accessdate=2013-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Singapore===
Singapore allows women to serve in combat roles, although females are not conscripted.

===Sri Lanka===
[[Sri Lanka Air Force]] (SLAF) was the first service of the Sri Lankan military to allow women to serve, accepting female recruits to the [[Sri Lanka Volunteer Air Force]] in 1972. The Sri Lanka Army followed in 1979 with the establishment of the [[Sri Lanka Army Women's Corps]] (SLAWC). Since then, each service has for both administrative and practical reasons maintained separate units for women. These are the SLAWC and the SLAF Women's Wing; the [[Sri Lanka Navy]] does not have a specific name for women's units. In order to maintain discipline, all three services have women [[Military police|MPs]] attached to their respective military police/provost corps.

Currently, female personnel of all three services play an active part in ongoing operations. However, there are certain limitations in 'direct combat' duties such as [[special forces]], pilot branch, naval fast attack squadrons. These are only a few restrictions; female personnel have been tasked with many front line duties and attached to combat units such as [[paratroops]], [[Sri Lanka Air Force Regiment|SLAF Regiment]], as well as undertaken support services such as [[Control tower|control tower operators]], [[Electronic warfare|electronic warfare technicians]], radio material teletypewriters, [[Auto mechanic|automotive mechanics]], [[Assault Support|aviation supply personnel]], [[cryptographers]], [[physician|doctors]], [[combat medic]]s, [[lawyers]], [[Combat engineering|engineers]] and [[Aerial photography|aerial photographers]]. In the [[Sri Lanka Navy]] female personnel were at first limited to the medical branch, however currently both lady officers and female rates are able to join any branch of service including the executive branch. With the escalation of the [[Sri Lankan civil war]], many female personnel have come under enemy fire both directly and indirectly thus taking many casualties including fatalities. As of 2008 there were three female officers of the rank of [[Major General]] and one [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]].

The [[Department of Civil Defence (Sri Lanka)|Sri Lanka Civil Defence Force]], formerly the Sri Lanka Home Guard, has been open to women recruits since 1988. In 1993, these guardswomen were issued firearms and deployed to protect their home towns and villages against attacks by [[LTTE]]. As a result, there have been many casualties (including fatalities) from attacks.

===Thailand===
Thailand has recently begun recruiting and training women to conduct counter-insurgency operations (c. 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/asiapcf/03/18/thailand.women.ap/ | work=CNN}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ranger commander said that when women are protesting, "It is better for women to do the talking.

Females were granted the same training and responsibilities as their male counterparts, and also play a major role in humanitarian assistance and peacekeeping operations. Emirati women have reached senior ranks within the [[UAE Armed Forces]], especially in the Air Force combat units.

==Europe==

===Denmark===
Women were employed in the Danish armed forces as early as 1934 with the Ground Observer Corps, Danish Women's Army Corps and Naval Corps in 1946 and the Women's Air Force since 1953. In 1962, the Danish parliament passed laws allowing women to volunteer in the regular Danish armed forces as long as they did not serve in units experiencing direct combat. 1971 saw the enlistment of women as non-commissioned officers, with military academies allowing women in 1974.

In 1978, based on the reports of studies on the topic, women were allowed to enlist in an all areas of the Danish armed forces, with combat trials in the eighties exploring the capabilities of women in combat. In 1998, laws were passed allowing women to sample military life in the same way as conscripted men, however without being completely open to conscription. Since then females have served in infantry units in both Iraq and in combat in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sorensjogren.com/2012/the-problem-with-women-in-combat-units/|title=HugeDomains.com - SoreNsJogRen.com is for sale (Sore Ns Jog Ren)|website=sorensjogren.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women in the Danish military come under the command of the Chief of Defense.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/ims/2001/win/denmark.htm|title=NATO/IMS: Committee on Women in the NATO Forces: Denmark&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 2010, women make up 5% of the army, 6.9% of the navy, and 8.6% of air force personnel.

===Finland===
[[File:Naispunakaartilainen.jpg|thumb|125px|upright|Red Guard during the [[Finnish Civil War]]]]

The [[Finnish Defense Forces]] does not conscript women. However, since 1995, women between 18 and 30 years of age have the possibility of voluntarily undertaking military service in the Defence Forces or in the [[Finnish Border Guard|Border Guard]]. Women generally serve under the same conditions as men.

[[File:Lottia ilmavalvontatehtävissä.jpg|thumb|left|Members of [[Lotta Svärd]] in air control duty during the [[Continuation War]]]]
The history of women in the Finnish military is, however, far longer than just since 1995. During the [[Finnish Civil War]], the [[Red Guards (Finland)|Reds]] had several ''Naiskaarti'' (Women's Guard) units made of voluntary 16- to 35-year-old women, who were given rudimentary military training. The reactions on women in military were ambivalent during the Civil War.

The non-combat duties in Finnish Defence Forces [[peace-keeping]] operations opened to women in 1991. Since 1995 the women are allowed to serve in all combat arms including front-line infantry and special forces both in Finland and in operations outside Finland.

In the 1800s, women in the French military were responsible for preparing meals for soldiers, and were called [[cantinière]]s. They sold food to soldiers beyond that which was given to them as rations. Cantinières had commissions from the administrators of the regiments, and they were required to be married to a soldier of the regiment. They served near the front lines on active campaigns, and some served for as long as 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Following the drums: Cantinieres|url=http://www.napoleon-series.org/military/organization/c_cantinieres.html|accessdate=August 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Wars of the French Revolution]], some women enlisted in the army, mainly in support roles. [[Angélique Brûlon|Marie-Angélique Duchemin]] is the first woman with a recorded rank in the French Army, being promoted Corporal and Acting Sergeant in 1794. She was promoted 2nd Lieutenant on the retired list in 1815. Duchemin is the first woman decorated with the [[Legion of Honor]], in 1851.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} [http://www.napoleon.org/fr/salle_lecture/biographies/files/duchemin_delage_2007.asp fondation Napoléon]&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of women in the French military grew in 1914 with the recruitment of women as medical personnel (Service de Santé des Armées). In 1939, they were authorized to enlist with the armed service branches, and in 1972 their status evolved to share the same ranks as those of men. [[Valérie André]], a neurosurgeon, became the first woman in France to attain the rank of three-star general as Médecin Général Inspecteur. A veteran of the [[French Resistance]], she served overseas in [[Indochina]]. During that period, she learned how to pilot a helicopter so that she could reach wounded soldiers who were trapped in the jungle. André is the first woman to have flown a helicopter in combat. She received many decorations for her achievements, including the highest rank of the [[Legion of Honour]]. She retired from active service in 1981.


Today women can serve in every position in the French military, including submarines&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.rfi.fr/france/20171204-France-have-its-first-women-submariners-mission France have its first women submariners on mission], [[Radio France International]], december 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; and combat infantry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rfi.fr/france/20150223-journee-internationale-femme-militaire-commando-parachutiste-8-mars-defense A l'armée, une femme est un homme comme les autres], Radio France international, march 2015 {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; make up around 15% of all service personnel in the combined branches of the French military. They are 11% of the Army forces, 13% for the Navy, 21% of the Air Force and 50% of the Medical Corps. This is the highest proportion of female personnel in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Les femmes de la Defense|url=https://www.defense.gouv.fr/content/download/487432/7798345/version/1/file/Les+femmes+dans+larmee+francaise-diptyque.pdf|publisher=Ministry of Defense, Government of France|accessdate=February 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
Since the creation of the [[Bundeswehr]] in 1955, Germany had employed one of the most conservative gender-policies of any NATO country.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} That was generally regarded as a reaction to the deployment of young women at the end of [[World War II]]. Though women were exempt from direct combat functions in accordance with Nazi-ideology, several hundred thousand German women, along with young boys and sometimes girls (as [[Flakhelfer]]), served in Luftwaffe artillery units; their flak shot down thousands of Allied warplanes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://americanhistoryprojects.com/downloads/H491/combat.pdf D'Ann Campbell, "Women in Combat: The World War Two Experience in the United States, Great Britain, Germany, and the Soviet Union" ''Journal of Military History'' (April 1993), 57:301-323]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year 1975 the first female medical officers were appointed in the ''Sanitätsdienst'' of the Bundeswehr. Since 1994, two women, [[Verena von Weymarn]] and Erika Franke, attained the rank of ''Generalarzt''. But it was not until January 2001 that women first joined German combat units, following a court ruling by the [[European Court of Justice]].

There are no restrictions regarding the branch of service, and there are woman serving in the "Fallschirmjäger" and as Tornado fighter pilot.

===Ireland===
In the Irish [[1916 Rising]], Cumann na mBan, the women's wing of the Irish Volunteers, fought alongside them in the streets of Dublin and in the General Post Office, the Irish Volunteers' HQ. [[Constance Markievicz]], an Irish Revolutionary and suffragette, commanded male and female troops during the Rising.

The Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1979, allowed women to join the [[Irish Defence Forces]] for the first time and was passed by the [[Oireachtas]] in 1979, making them the first European Armed Forces to allow women all roles in the military including combat roles, and even join the Irish Army Ranger Wing (Fianoglach), the Irish Special Forces, similar to the British SAS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1979/en/act/pub/0028/index.html |title=Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1979 |publisher=Irishstatutebook.ie |date=1979-11-06 |accessdate=2013-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are no restrictions for women to the "full range of operational and administrative duties."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0658/D.0658.200807020061.html |title=Dáil Éireann - Volume 658 - 02 July, 2008 - Written Answers. - Defence Forces Personnel |publisher=Historical-debates.oireachtas.ie |date= |accessdate=2013-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 2010 the number of women in the Permanent Defence Forces is 565, 5.7 percent of the total.&lt;ref&gt;[http://debates.oireachtas.ie/DDebate.aspx?F=DAL20100224.xml&amp;Page=1&amp;Ex=1236#N1236 ]{{dead link|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
[[File:Italian Soldier Olypmic Games Turin 2006.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|Italian parachutist]]
During the short life of the [[Italian Social Republic]] (World War II), the Female Volunteer Unit was introduced as an auxiliary service and they were knwown as Female Auxiliary Unit ({{lang-it|Servizio Ausiliario Femminile}}). The law that introduced this unit provided that its existence be limited to war periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.tiscali.it/RSI_ANALISI/34.htm|title=Decreto istitutivo del Corpo femminile|access-date=30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its equivalent in Southern Italy during World War II, was the ''CAF'', {{lang-it|Corpo di Assistenza Femminile}}, that was on the side of the [[Allies]]. This unit was also dismissed at the end of the war. Those who belonged to this unit were equivalent to [[sub-lieutenants]] and wore military uniforms made in [[Great Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museobadoglio.altervista.org/docs/forze.pdf|title=Forze del Regno del Sud|access-date=30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, the Female Police unit ({{lang-it|Corpo di Polizia femminile}}) was established.

In 1981, Diadora Bussani was the first woman who asked to be admitted  into the Naval Academy of [[Livorno]] ({{lang-it|Accademia navale di Livorno}}). She was born in 1962 in [[Trieste]] and started her struggle to join the academy in 1981. After being excluded from the application, Italy's regional administrative court upheld the appeal; however, Italy's State Council overturned the judgment. The enlisting of a woman seemed to be legally feasible because of Italian law Legge 1963 n. 66 which allowed the enrollment of women in public positions, but the State Council excluded the military because of biological differences between male and female human bodies. When she became famous and the case was well-known, the [[United States Navy]] symbolically granted her enlistment on 2 November 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloogger.it/2018/06/italiane-in-armi/|title=Italiane in armi|date=5 June 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voluntary female military service was introduced in 1999 with the Italian law Legge 20 ottobre 1999 n. 380, which introduced the possibility of being admitted to the army for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informagiovani.it/frame/_donnemiliti.htm|title=Servizio militare femminile|website=www.informagiovani.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italy was the last country among [[NATO]] members to allow women to join the army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carabinieri.it/Internet/Editoria/Rassegna+Arma/2004/Suppl_3/I+Sessione/01_Sessione_03.htm#3|title=L'impatto del servizio militare femminile. Un primo bilancio (Periodico Rassegna dell'arma dei carabinieri anno anno 2004, supplemento al n. 3/2004|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays women are present in all branches of Italian armed forces, including the police, and [[Guardia di Finanza]], and they are also employed for military missions abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.difesa.it/APPROFONDIMENTI/ARCHIVIOAPPROFONDIMENTI/SERVIZIO_FEMMINILE/Pagine/default.aspx|title=Ministero della Difesa|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the year 2000, women were employed in war only as voluntary nurses inside organizations [[Croce Rossa Italiana]] and ''Corpo delle infermiere volontarie dell'ACISMOM''. 235º Reggimento fanteria "Piceno" is the training center for women inside the Italian army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esercito.difesa.it/organizzazione/capo-di-sme/comando-per-la-formazione-specializzazione-e-dottrina-dell-esercito/Scuola-di-Fanteria/Centro-Addestramento-Volontari/235-RAV-Piceno|title=235° Reggimento Addestramento Volontari|website=www.esercito.difesa.it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norway===
Women in Norway have been able to fill military roles since 1938, and during the Second World War both enlisted women and female officers served in all branches of the military. However, in 1947 political changes commanded that women only serve in civilian posts, with reservists allowing women to join them in 1959. Female personnel currently make up around 12% of the armed forces (2017).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://forsvaret.no/en/facts/the-armed-forces-in-numbers/personnel|title=Personnel|first=|last=Forsvaret|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1977 and 1984, the Norwegian Parliament passed laws expanding the role of women in the Norwegian Armed Forces, and in 1985 equal opportunities legislation was applied to the military.

In 1995, Norway allowed women to serve on its military [[submarines]], and to this date there has been at least one female commander of a Norwegian submarine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/docu/review/2002/issue4/english/interview.html|title=Nato Review|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first was [[Solveig Krey]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mil.no/fakta/start/menneskene/kvinner/ |title=Forsvarsnett: Kvinner |publisher=Mil.no |date= |accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 conscription was extended to women making Norway the first [[NATO]] member and first European country to make national service compulsory for both men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://forsvaret.no/en/newsroom/news-stories/female-conscription |title=Universal Conscription |publisher=Norwegian Armed Forces |date=11 June 2015 |access-date=25 June 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305005856/https://forsvaret.no/en/newsroom/news-stories/female-conscription |archive-date=5 March 2016 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poland===
[[File:Zolnierki 1920.JPG|thumb|175px|Polish female volunteers during the [[Polish-Soviet War]]]]
Women have taken part in the battles for independence against occupiers and invaders since at least the time of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. During the occupation by the [[Nazi]]s, 1939–1945, several thousand women took part in the resistance movement as members of the [[Home Army]] and the [[Polish People's Army|People's Army]]. The Germans were forced to establish special [[prisoner-of-war camp]]s after the [[Warsaw Rising]] in 1944 to accommodate over a thousand women prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polishresistance-ak.org/12%20Article.htm |title=Women in Home Army |publisher=Polishresistance-ak.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1938 the law requiring compulsory military service for men included provisions for voluntary service of women in auxiliary roles, in the medical services, in the anti-aircraft artillery and in communications. In 1939 a Women's Military Training Organization was established under the command of [[Maria Wittek]].

In present Poland a law passed April 6, 2004 requires all women with college nursing or veterinary degrees to register for compulsory service. In addition it allows women to volunteer and serve as professional personnel in all services of the army. As of June 30, 2007 there are 800 women in the army, of which 471 are officers, 308 non-commissioned officers and 21 other ranks, in addition 225 are in military training schools. Two active duty Polish women have achieved the rank of Colonel. [[Maria Wittek]] was the 1st Polish woman to reach the rank of General.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kadry.wp.mil.pl/artykul.php?idartykul=20 Women in army – in Polish] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104013702/http://www.kadry.wp.mil.pl/artykul.php?idartykul=20 |date=January 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:pl:Kobiety w Wojsku Polskim|in Polish]], Retrieved 2013-11-14{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
{{Main|Women in the Russian and Soviet military}}
[[File:Regiment from Petrograd.jpg|thumb|210px|[[Women's Battalion#1st Petrograd Women's Battalion|1st Petrograd Women's Battalion]] (1918)]]
[[File:Military parade on Red Square 2017-05-09 028.jpg|thumb|Russian female cadets.]]
During the [[First World War]], heavy defeats led to the loss of millions of [[Russian Empire|Russian Imperial]] soldiers. To psychologically energize morale [[Alexander Kerensky]] (leader of Russia of the [[Russian Provisional Government]]) ordered the creation of the Woman’s Death Battalion in May 1917. After three months of fighting, the size of this all-female unit fell from 2,000 to 250.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Wdeath.htm |title=Women's Death Battalion |publisher=Spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1917, the [[Bolsheviks]] dissolved the unit. Shortly after Russia became part of the [[Soviet Union]] (see above for the role of woman in Soviet military) until December 1991.

The current tally of woman in the Russian Army is standing at around 115,000 to 160,000, representing 10% of Russia’s military strength.

===Serbia===
  {{commonscat|Military women of Serbia}}
Although the Serbian armed forces were traditionally exclusively male (with exception of nurses and some other non-combat roles) there were some exceptions. Several women are known to have fought in the ranks in the [[Balkan Wars]] and the [[First World War]], often by initially hiding their gender to work around the draft regulations. The most notable of them was [[Milunka Savić]], the most decorated female combatant in history. In the [[Second World War]] [[Yugoslav Partisans|Yugoslav partisan units]] accepted female volunteers as combatants as well as medical personnel. After the war the practice was abandoned, but was reintroduced recently with professionalisation of the army.

===Sweden===
In the Military Articles of 1621, which organized the Swedish army, military men on all levels were explicitly allowed to bring their wives with them to war, as the wives were regarded to fill an important role as [[sutler]]s in the house hold organisation of the army: prostitutes, however, were banned.&lt;ref name="Sjöberg, Maria 1850"&gt;Sjöberg, Maria: ''Kvinnor i fält 1550-1850.'' [Women in Combat] Gidlund (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  This regulation was kept until the Military Article of 1798, though the presence of women diminished after the end of the [[Great Northern War]].&lt;ref name="Sjöberg, Maria 1850"/&gt; In the Military Article of 1798, the only women allowed to accompany the army was the professional unmarried female sutlers, in Sweden named ''marketenterska''.&lt;ref name="Sjöberg, Maria 1850"/&gt; Unofficially, however, there were females who served in the army posing as male the entire period, the most famous being [[Ulrika Eleonora Stålhammar]].&lt;ref name="Sjöberg, Maria 1850"/&gt;

In 1924, the [[Swedish Women's Voluntary Defence Service]] (Swedish: Riksförbundet Sveriges lottakårer, commonly known as Lottorna) was founded: it is an auxiliary defense organization of the [[Swedish Home Guard]], a part of the [[Swedish Armed Forces]].

Since 1989 there are no gender restrictions in the Swedish military on access to military training or positions. They are allowed to serve in all parts of the military and in all positions, including combat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rekryc.mil.se/article.php?id=11756 in Swedish, Retrieved 04-23-2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927045646/http://www.rekryc.mil.se/article.php?id=11756 |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Female personnel currently make up around 13% of the Armed Forces.&lt;ref&gt;Swedish Armed Forces http://www.forsvarsmakten.se/sv/om-myndigheten/vara-varderingar/jamstalldhet-och-jamlikhet/historik/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkey===
When Turkish history is examined, it is apparent that Turkish women have voluntarily taken tasks in the defence of their country, showing the same power and courage as men. [[Nene Hatun]], whose monument has been erected in the city of Erzurum (Eastern Turkey) because of her gallant bravery during the Ottoman-Russian War, constitutes a very good example of this fact. Besides providing nursery services, women also took main roles in combat in WWI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haznevi.net/Kavramoku.aspx?KID=589&amp;KTID=6 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913011056/http://www.haznevi.net/Kavramoku.aspx?KID=589&amp;KTID=6 |archivedate=2014-09-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, the Independence War has taken its place in history with the unsurpassed heroism of Turkish women.&lt;ref name="nato.int"&gt;http://www.nato.int/ims/2001/win/turkey.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sabiha Gökçen]] was the first female combat pilot in the world, as well as the first Turkish female aviator. She was one of the eight adoptive children of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]]. Throughout her career in the Turkish Air Force, Gökçen flew 22 different types of aircraft for more than 8,000 hours, 32 hours of which were active combat and bombardment missions. She was selected as the only female pilot for the poster of "20 Greatest Aviators in History" published by the United States Air Force in 1996.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctie.monash.edu.au/hargrave/gokcen.html |title=Sabiha Gokcen (1913-2001), Pioneer Aviatrix |publisher=Ctie.monash.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women personnel are being employed as officers in the Turkish Armed Forces today. The women officers serve together with the men under the same respective chains of command. The personnel policy regarding women in the Turkish Armed Forces is based on the principle of "needing qualified women officers in suitable branches and ranks" to keep pace with technological advancements in the 21st century. Women civilian personnel have been assigned to the headquarters staff, technical fields, and social services without sexual discrimination. Women officers serve in all branches except armor, infantry, and submarines. Assignments, promotions and training are considered on an equal basis with no gender bias.&lt;ref name="nato.int"/&gt;

As of the year 2005, the number of the female officers and NCOs in the Turkish Armed Forces is 1245.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;http://www.nato.int/ims/2005/win/national_reports/turkey.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
[[File:The Auxiliary Territorial Service in the United Kingdom 1939 - 1945 H36315.jpg|thumb|right| ATS Searchlight Unit in the Second World War]]
Women were first employed by the [[Royal Navy]] in 1696 when a handful were employed as nurses and [[laundress]]es on [[hospital ship]]s.&lt;ref name=stark68 /&gt; They received pay equal to an [[Able Seaman (rank)|able seaman]].&lt;ref name=stark68 /&gt; The practice was always controversial and over the next two centuries first the nurses and the laundresses were removed from service.&lt;ref name=stark68 /&gt; By the start of the 19th century both roles had been eliminated.&lt;ref name=stark68&gt;{{cite book |title=Female Tars: Women Aboard Ship in the Age of Sail |last=Stark |first=Suzanne J. |year=1998 |publisher=Pimlico |isbn=978-0-7126-6660-2 |pages=68–71 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Female service in the Royal Navy restarted 1884 when the Naval Nursing Service was formed. It became the [[Queen Alexandra's Royal Naval Nursing Service]] in 1902 and is still in operation. Women have had active roles in the British Army since 1902, when the [[Queen Alexandra's Royal Army Nursing Corps]] was founded.  The [[Princess Mary's Royal Air Force Nursing Service]] was formed in 1918. During the Second World War, about 600,000 women served in the three British women's auxiliary services: the [[Auxiliary Territorial Service]], the [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force]], and the [[Women's Royal Naval Service]], as well as the nursing corps.&lt;ref&gt;Lucy Milks, ''Women in the British Army: War and the Gentle Sex, 1907–1948'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917, the [[Queen Mary's Army Auxiliary Corps]] was formed; 47,000 women served until it was disbanded in 1921.  The [[Women's Royal Naval Service]] (WRNS) was formed in 1917 as well. Before it disbanded in 1919, it provided catering and administrative support, communications and electrician personnel.

In 1938, the [[Auxiliary Territorial Service]] (ATS) was created, with 20,000 women serving in non-combat roles during World War II, including as [[military police]]. They also performed a combat role on British soil, as [[anti-aircraft gun]]ners against the [[Luftwaffe]]. 

In 1949, women were officially recognized as a permanent part of British Armed forces, although full combat roles were still restricted to men. In this year, the [[Women's Royal Army Corps]] was created to replace the ATS, and in 1950 the ranks were normalised with the ranks of men serving in the British Army. From 1949 to 1992, thousands of women served in the WRAC and sister institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Goldman, ed. ''Female Soldier: Combatants or Non-Combatants?

[[File:CWAC mechanic, 1944.jpg|thumb|upright|Private Lowry, [[Canadian Women's Army Corps|CWAC]], tightening up the springs on the front of her vehicle, Chelsea &amp; Cricklewood Garage, England, 7 July 1944.]]

During the First World War, over 2,300 women served overseas in the Canadian Army Medical Corps. During the Second World War, 5,000 women of the Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps again served overseas, however they were not permitted to serve on combat warships or in combat teams. The Canadian Army Women's Corps was created during the Second World War, as was the Royal Canadian Air Force (Women's Division). As well, 45,000 women served as support staff in every theatre of the conflict, driving heavy equipment, rigging parachutes, and performing clerical work, telephone operation, laundry duties and cooking. Some 5,000 women performed similar occupations during Canada's part in the [[Korean War]] of 1950–1953.

In 1965 the Canadian government decided to allow a maximum of 1,500 women to serve directly in all three branches of its armed forces, and the former "women's services" were disbanded. In 1970 the government created a set of rules for the armed forces designed to encourage equal opportunities. In 1974 the first woman, Major Wendy Clay, earned her pilot's wings in the newly integrated [[Canadian Forces]].

Between 1979 and 1985 the role of women expanded further, with military colleges allowing women to enroll. In 1982 laws were passed ending all discrimination in employment, and combat related roles in the Canadian armed forces were opened for women, with the exception of the submarine service. In 1986 further laws were created to the same effect. The following years saw Canada's first female infantry soldier, and a female [[Brigadier-General]].

In 1989, a tribunal appointed under the Canadian Human Rights Act ordered full integration of women in the Canadian Armed Forces "with all due speed", at least within the next ten
years. Only submarines were to remain closed to women.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Symons, "Under Fire: Canadian Women in Combat," ''Canadian Journal of Women and the Law'' (1990) 4: 477–511&lt;/ref&gt;
Women were permitted to serve on board Canadian submarines in 2002 with the acquisition of the [[Upholder/Victoria-class submarine|''Victoria''-class submarine]]. Master Seaman Colleen Beattie became the first [[Submarine#Women|female submariner]] in 2003.

Canadian women have also commanded large infantry units and Canadian warships. Commander Josée Kurtz is the first woman appointed to command a major warship –  [[HMCS Halifax (FFH 330)|HMCS Halifax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forces.gc.ca/en/news/article.page?doc=canadian-armed-forces-historical-milestones-of-women/hie8w7rl|title=National Defence - Canadian Armed Forces - Fact Sheet - Canadian Armed Forces – Historical milestones of women|first=Government of Canada, National|last=Defence|website=www.forces.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first female American soldier was [[Deborah Sampson]] of [[Massachusetts]]. She enlisted as a [[Continental Army]] soldier under the name of "Robert Shurtliff". She served for three years in the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] and was wounded twice; she cut a musket ball out of her own thigh so no doctor would find out she was a woman.

During the [[American Civil War]], [[Sarah Rosetta Wakeman]] enlisted under the alias of Private Lyons Wakeman.

In the history of women in the military, there are records of female U.S. Revolutionary and Civil War soldiers who enlisted using male pseudonyms, but a letter written by [[Annie Oakley]] to President [[William McKinley]] on April 5, 1898 may represent the earliest documentary proof of a political move towards recognizing a woman's right to serve in the United States military. Oakley, sharpshooter and star in the [[Buffalo Bill]] [[Wild West Shows|Show]], wrote a letter to [[President of the United States|President]] [[William McKinley]] on April 5, 1898 "offering the government the services of a company of 50 'lady sharpshooters' who would provide their own arms and ammunition should war break out with Spain."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/research/recover/example-02.html |title=Letter to President William McKinley from Annie Oakley |last=Oakley |first=Oakley |authorlink=Annie Oakley |date=5 April 1898 |publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]] |accessdate=23 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Spanish–American War]] did occur, but Oakley's offer was not accepted.

During [[World War I]], 21,498 U.S. Army nurses (military nurses were all women then) served in military hospitals in the United States and overseas. Eighteen African-American Army nurses served stateside caring for German prisoners of war ([[POWs]]) and African-American soldiers; after the Armistice, Nov. 11, 1918, they entered the Army Nurse Corps and cared for people. They were assigned to [[Camp Grant (Illinois)|Camp Grant, IL]], and [[Camp Sherman, Ohio|Camp Sherman, OH]], and lived in segregated quarters while caring for German POWs and black soldiers. African-American women also served in World War I as U.S. Yeomen (F). Of the 11,274 U.S. Yeomen (F) who served from 1917 to 1921, 14 were black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Women's Roles and Statuses the World Over |author1=Stephanie Hepburn|author2=Rita J.

The Yeoman (F) recruits and women Marines primarily served in [[clerk (position)|clerical]] positions. They received the same benefits and responsibilities as men, including identical pay (US$28.75 per month), and were treated as veterans after the war. The U.S. Army recruited and trained 233 female bilingual telephone operators to work at switchboards near the front in France and sent 50 skilled female stenographers to France to work with the Quartermaster Corps. The U.S. Navy enlisted 11,880 women as Yeomen (F) to serve stateside in shore billets and release sailors for sea duty. More than 1,476 U.S. Navy nurses served in military hospitals stateside and overseas. The U.S. Marine Corps enlisted 305 female Marine Reservists (F) to "free men to fight" by filling positions such as clerks and telephone operators on the home front. More than 400 U.S. military nurses died in the line of duty during World War I. The vast majority of these women died from a highly contagious form of influenza known as the "[[Spanish Flu]]", which swept through crowded military camps and hospitals and ports of embarkation. Women were quickly demobilized when hostilities ceased, and aside from the Nurse Corps the soldiery became once again exclusively male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscg.mil/history/uscghist/WomenChronology.asp|title=Women's History Chronology|publisher=[[United States Coast Guard]]|accessdate=2011-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Highlights in the History of Military Women |url= http://www.womensmemorial.org/Education/timeline.html |accessdate= 2011-03-11 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110629034939/http://www.womensmemorial.org/Education/timeline.html |archivedate= 2011-06-29 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"&gt;{{cite news|title=Women in the military — international|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/military-international/ |publisher=CBC News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014025906/http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/military-international/ |archivedate=October 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Women's Army Corps|Woman’s Army Auxiliary Corps]], the women's branch of the United States Army, was established in the United States on 15 May 1942 by Public Law 554, and converted to full status as the WAC on 1 July 1943. The [[WAVES|Woman’s Naval Reserve]] was also created during [[World War II]]. In 1944 women from the [[Women's Army Corps]] (WACs) arrived in the Pacific and landed in Normandy on [[D-Day]]. During the war, 67 Army nurses and 16 [[United States Navy Nurse Corps|Navy nurses]] were captured and spent three years as Japanese prisoners of war. There were 350,000 American women who served during World War II and 16 were killed in action; in total, they gained over 1,500 medals, citations, and commendations. Additionally, by the end of WW II, Women Ordnance Workers (WOWs) accounted for approximately 85,000 of all civilian employees, working for the [[Ordnance Corps (United States Army)|Ordnance Corps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goordnance.army.mil/history/ORDhistory.html|title=History of the U.S. Army Ordnance Corps|website=www.goordnance.army.mil}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ordnance soldiers ''and'' civilians worked across the globe, ranging from Iceland, Iran, the Pacific Islands, Africa, and Europe, to the Middle East.

[[Virginia Hall]], serving with the [[Office of Strategic Services]], received the second-highest US combat award, the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]], for action behind enemy lines in France. Hall, who had one artificial leg, landed clandestinely in occupied territory aboard a British [[Motor Torpedo Boat]].

Law 625, [[Women's Armed Services Integration Act|The Women's Armed Services Act]] of 1948, was signed by [[Harry S. Truman|President Truman]], allowing women to serve in the armed forces in fully integrated units during peacetime, with only the WAC remaining a separate female unit. The WAC as a branch was disbanded in 1978. Women serving as WACs at that time converted in branch to whichever [[Military Occupational Specialty]] they worked in.

U.S. servicewomen who had joined the Reserves following World War II were involuntarily recalled to active duty during the [[Korean War]]. More than 500 Army nurses served in the combat zone and many more were assigned to large hospitals in Japan during the war. One Army nurse (Major Genevieve Smith) died in a plane crash en route to Korea on July 27, 1950, shortly after hostilities begin. Navy nurses served on hospital ships in the Korean theater of war as well as at Navy hospitals stateside. Eleven Navy nurses died en route to Korea when their plane crashed in the Marshall Islands. Air Force nurses served stateside, in Japan, and as flight nurses in the Korean theater during the conflict. Three Air Force nurses were killed in plane crashes while on duty. Many other servicewomen were assigned to duty in the theater of operations in Japan and Okinawa.&lt;ref name="womensmemorial.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womensmemorial.org/Education/timeline.html|title=Highlights in the History of Military Women|website=Women In Military Service For America Memorial|accessdate=June 22, 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HZVJCcKl?url=http://www.womensmemorial.org/Education/timeline.html|archivedate=June 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=scZN59DXeOwC&amp;pg=PA204&amp;lpg=PA204&amp;dq=%22genevieve+smith%22+%22korean+war%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22genevieve%20smith%22%20%22korean%20war%22&amp;f=false |title=Historical Dictionary of the Korean War |author=Paul M.

Records regarding American women serving in the [[Vietnam War]] are vague. However, it is recorded that 600 women served in the country as part of the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]], along with 500 members of the WAC, and over 6,000 medical personnel and support staff.

''[[Frontiero v. Richardson]]'', {{ussc|411|677|1973}}, was a [[List of landmark court decisions in the United States|landmark]] [[United States Supreme Court]] case&lt;ref&gt;Technically, the case was decided under the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]]'s [[Due Process Clause]], not under the Equal Protection Clause of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], since the latter applies not to the federal government but to the states. However, because ''[[Bolling v. Sharpe]]'', through the doctrine of reverse [[Incorporation (Bill of Rights)|incorporation]], made the standards of the Equal Protection Clause applicable to the federal government, it was for practical purposes an addition not to due process, but rather to equal protection jurisprudence.&lt;/ref&gt; which decided that benefits given by the United States military to the family of service members cannot be given out differently because of sex.

In 1974, the first six women aviators earned their wings as [[United States Navy|Navy]] pilots. The [[United States Congress|Congressionally]] mandated prohibition on women in combat places limitations on the pilots' advancement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Navy Woman Decries Limitations |agency=[[Associated Press]] |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1356&amp;dat=19840823&amp;id=kdgTAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=iwYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6981,4703933 |work=[[Star-Banner|Ocala Star-Banner]] |date=August 23, 1984 |at=vol. 40, no. 537, p. 8C|accessdate=23 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but at least two retired as captains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Woman Aviator Pioneer Retires |editor-first=E.

On December 20, 1989, Captain Linda L. Bray, 29, became the first woman to command American soldiers in battle, during the [[United States invasion of Panama|invasion of Panama]]. She was assigned to lead a force of 30 men and women [[military police]] officers to capture a kennel holding guard dogs that was defended by elements of the [[Panamanian Public Forces|Panamanian Defense Forces]].

The 1991 [[Persian Gulf War]] proved to be the pivotal time for the role of women in the United States Armed Forces to come to the attention of the world media. Over 40,000 women served in almost every role the armed forces had to offer. However, while many came under fire, they were not permitted to participate in deliberate ground engagements. Despite this, there are many reports of women engaging enemy forces during the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://userpages.aug.com/captbarb/femvetsds.html |title=Operations Desert Shield/Desert Storm |last1=Wilson |first1=Barbara A |publisher=American Women in Uniform, Veterans Too! |accessdate=23 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case ''[[United States v. Virginia]]'', in which the Supreme Court ordered that the [[Virginia Military Institute]] allow women to register as cadets, gave women soldiers a weapon against laws which (quoting Judge [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]]) “[deny] to women, simply because they are women, full citizenship stature—equal opportunity to aspire, achieve, participate in and contribute to society”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/518/515/case.html ''United States v.

==South America==

===Argentina===

The [[Argentine Army]] first authorized women in their ranks in 1997, the Air Force in 2001 and the [[Argentine Navy]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taringa.net/posts/imagenes/18275764/Las-mujeres-en-el-Ejercito-Argentino.html|title=Las mujeres en el Ejercito Argentino - Imágenes|date=14 November 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, they were deployed in [[peacekeeping]] missions to Cyprus and Haiti.

The first female [[Argentine Air Force]] combat pilot graduated in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/707876-buen-debut-de-la-primera-mujer-piloto-de-la-fuerza-aerea|title=Buen debut de la primera mujer piloto de la Fuerza Aérea|date=27 May 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bolivia===

The [[Bolivian Air Force]]'s first female military pilot completed her solo-flight in August 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reyquibolivia.blogspot.com.ar/2015/08/silvia-rodriguez-primera-piloto-de-un.html|title=Silvia Rodríguez, primera piloto de un avión de combate boliviano|website=reyquibolivia.blogspot.com.ar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===

The first participation of a woman in combat occurred in 1823. Maria Quitéria de Jesus fought for the maintenance of the independence of Brazil, and is considered the first woman to enlist in a military unit.
However, only in 1943, during World War II, women officially entered the Brazilian Army.
They were sent 73 nurses, 67 of them registered nurses and six air transport specialists. They served in four different hospitals in the US Army, all volunteered for the mission and were the first women to join the active service of the Brazilian armed forces.
After the war, as well as the rest of the FEB, the nurses, most have been awarded, they won the official patent and licensed the active military service.

===Colombia===

Joanna Herrera Cortez became the first female Colombian fighter pilot in 2004. She also became a lieutenant and put in charge of 99 men.

'''Xylit''' (from ''xylon'', « [[wood]] ») is a waste reclamation obtained all around the world from the mining of [[lignite]].

Like in the [[peat]], we can still observe the wooden structures not completely [[Sedimentary rock|sedimented]].

Its [[density]] is around 400&amp;nbsp;kg/m³ &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Xylit - épuration des eaux|url=http://www.aquaterra-solutions.com/pdf/depliants/XYLIT-Epuration-des-eaux_Page_2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==

Its very low [[heat content]], even in dried state, makes it considered as [[coal rank|insufficient rank]] of [[coal]]. It is not used as fuel for heat generation.

Xylit is sometimes used for the production of [[potting soil]] and professional substrate for [[horticulture]].&lt;ref&gt;https://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Xylit_(Kohle)&amp;oldid=169868836&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its good mechanical characteristics, with more elasticity and robustness than wood,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Xylit - épuration des eaux|url=http://www.aquaterra-solutions.com/pdf/depliants/XYLIT-Epuration-des-eaux_Page_2.pdf|website=Aquaterra solutions|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its good filtering characteristics, Xylit is sometimes used as wood chips or water filtration for water filtration.

[[File:Xylit- storage.jpg|thumb|right|Storage of Xylit]]

Its unique structure, that allow nutrients and pollutants to fix on it, its high [[specific surface area]] (encouraging [[trickling filter]] development) and its exceptional longevity (30 years) allow to be used as a very high quality filter. It is used as filter media in some [[decentralized wastewater system]]s.

It has been proven in [[France]] that it could be turned in [[compost]]

== Commercial uses ==

* The Belgian company [[w:fr:Eloy (entreprise)|Eloy]] uses Xylit as filtering media in its X-Perco
* The Aquaterra company uses Xylit as riverbanks stabilization
