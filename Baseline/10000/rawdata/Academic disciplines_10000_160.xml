'''Anthrozoology''' (also known as '''human–non-human-animal studies''', or''' HAS''') is the subset of [[ethnobiology]] that deals with interactions between humans and other animals. It is an [[interdisciplinary]] field that overlaps with other disciplines including [[anthropology]], [[ethnology]], [[medicine]], [[psychology]], [[veterinary medicine]] and [[zoology]]. A major focus of anthrozoologic research is the quantifying of the positive effects of human-animal relationships on either party and the study of their interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, Daniel S. [https://books.google.com/books?id=vrueZDfPUzoC&amp;pg=PA28 "Anthrozoology"], ''The Encyclopedia of Applied Animal Behaviour and Welfare''. CABI 2010, pp. 28–30.&lt;/ref&gt; It includes scholars from fields such as anthropology, sociology, biology, history and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;DeMello, Margo. ''Teaching the Animal: Human–Animal Studies Across the Disciplines''. Lantern Books, 2010, p. xi. and Hurn, Samantha. ''Humans and Other Animals''. Pluto Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animalsandsociety.org/content/index.php?pid=41 Animals &amp; Society Institute.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625044717/http://www.animalsandsociety.org/content/index.php?pid=41 |date=June 25, 2013 }} Accessed February 23, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note: the term should not be confused with "animal studies," which often refers to [[animal testing]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthrozoology scholars, such as [[Pauleen Bennett]] recognize the lack of scholarly attention given to non-human animals in the past, and to the relationships between human and non-human animals, especially in the light of the magnitude of animal representations, symbols, stories and their actual physical presence in human societies. Rather than a unified approach, the field currently consists of several methods adapted from the several participating disciplines to encompass human-nonhuman animal relationships and occasional efforts to develop ''[[sui generis]]'' methods.

== Growth of the field ==
There are currently 23 college programs in HAS or a related field in the United States, Canada, Great Britain, Germany, Israel and the Netherlands, as well as an additional eight veterinary school programs in North America, and over thirty HAS organizations in the US, Canada, Great Britain, Australia, France, Germany, New Zealand, Israel, Sweden, and Switzerland.

In the UK, the University of Exeter runs an MA in Anthrozoology which explores human-animal interactions from anthropological (cross-cultural) perspectives. Human animal interactions (HAI) involving companion animals are also studied by the [[Waltham Centre for Pet Nutrition]], which partners with the US [[National Institutes of Health]] to research HAI in relation to child development and aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Processes in Social &amp; Affective Development: Human-Animal Interaction (HAI) Research|url=https://www.nichd.nih.gov/about/org/der/branches/cdbb/programs/psad/HAI|website=Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD)|accessdate=7 April 2018|date=December 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are now three primary lists for HAS scholars and students—H-Animal, the Human-Animal Studies listserv, and NILAS, as well as the Critical Animal Studies list.

There are now over a dozen journals covering HAS issues, many of them founded in the last decade, and hundreds of HAS books, most of them published in the last decade (see for example, ''Humanimalia''). Brill, Berg, Johns Hopkins, Purdue, Columbia, Reaktion, Palgrave-McMillan, University of Minnesota, University of Illinois, and Oxford all offer either a HAS series or a large number of HAS books.

In addition, in 2006, Animals and Society Institute (ASI) began hosting the Human-Animal Studies Fellowship, a six-week program in which pre- and post-doctoral scholars work on a HAS research project at a university under the guidance of host scholars and distance peer scholars. Beginning in 2011, ASI has partnered with Wesleyan Animal Studies, who will be hosting the fellowship in conjunction with ASI. There are also a handful of HAS conferences per year, including those organized by ISAZ and NILAS, and the Minding Animals conference, held in 2009 in Australia. Finally, there are more HAS courses being taught now than ever before. The ASI website lists over 300 courses (primarily in North America, but also including Great Britain, New Zealand, Australia, Germany, and Poland) in twenty-nine disciplines at over 200 colleges and universities, not including over 100 law school courses.

An estimated $110 million of art was lost in the [[September 11 attacks]]: $100 million in private art&lt;ref name="Economist"&gt;{{cite news |date=11 October 2001 |title=A museum in the sky |url= http://www.economist.com/node/814452 |work= The Economist |access-date= 1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and $10 million in public art.&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{cite news |date=16 October 2001 |title=Lost Art Hundreds of Works Were Destroyed in the Trade Center Attack |url= https://www.npr.org/news/specials/response/home_front/features/2001/oct/011016.lostart.html|work=National Public Radio |access-date= 1 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attacks were said to be "the biggest single disaster ever to affect the [art] industry".&lt;ref name= "BBC"&gt;{{cite news |date= 5 October 2001|title='Up to' $100m art lost in attacks |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1581737.stm|work= BBC |location= |access-date= 1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Port Authority]] held an estimated 100 pieces of art work at the World Trade Center Complex, in addition to the seven public works of art that had been created for the World Trade Center, all of which were destroyed or severely damaged.

==Public art==
An estimated $10 million worth of public art was lost due to the collapse of the World Trade Center.&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt;

There were seven one-of-a-kind public works of art in the World Trade Center Complex at the time of the attacks:
* ''[[Cloud Fortress]]'' by [[Masayuki Nagare]]
* ''[[The Sphere]]'' by [[Fritz Koenig]]
* ''[[Ideogram (sculpture)|Ideogram]]'' by [[James Rosati]]
* ''[[Bent Propeller]]'' by [[Alexander Calder]]
* ''[[The World Trade Center Tapestry]]'' by [[Joan Miró]] and [[Josep Royo]]
* ''[[Sky Gate, New York]]'' by [[Louise Nevelson]]
* ''[[1993 bombing memorial fountain]]'' by [[Elyn Zimmerman]]

''Ideogram'', ''The World Trade Center Tapestry'', and ''Sky Gate, New York'' were never recovered from the rubble and are presumed destroyed.

''Cloud Fortress'' survived the attack and collapse of the buildings, but was severely damaged and subsequently cleared by rescue workers in the days after the attacks.

''Bent Propeller'' was partially recovered from the rubble. Only a small piece of the 1993 bombing memorial fountain was recovered.

''The Sphere'' was damaged in the attacks, but was refurbished and put on display as a memorial.

In addition to the seven public art works, the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey|Port Authority]] also had approximately 100 pieces of art on the complex, including:
* ''Recollection Pond'', a tapestry by [[Romare Bearden]] [https://www.artsy.net/artwork/romare-bearden-recollection-pond]
* ''Path Mural'' by [[Germaine Keller]] 
* ''Commuter Landscape'', a mural by [[Cynthia Mailman]] [https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1GCEA_enUS819US819&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;ei=HAnVW72aGLOBk-4PrK6y0A0&amp;q=Commuter+Landscape%27%27%2C+Cynthia+Mailman&amp;oq=Commuter+Landscape%27%27%2C+Cynthia+Mailman&amp;gs_l=img.3...237130.239714..239971...0.0..0.53.201.4......0....1..gws-wiz-img.ZPQZa0LSbYc#imgrc=fvRcqYJKJc6E2M:]

==Private art collections==
The World Trade Center alone held more than 430 tenants at the time of the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://edition.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/trade.center/tenants1.html |title=List of World Trade Center tenants|website=cnn.com |publisher=CNN |access-date= 1 December 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the decorative art that each office contained, some firms held large corporate art collections.

Three companies held major corporate art collections in the World Trade Center: Fred Alger, Cantor Fitzgerald, and Bank of America. Aside from these three, all other companies in the World trade center kept their artwork in other locations.&lt;ref name="Economist" /&gt;

===Cantor Fitzgerald===
In addition to losing the most lives in the attack, [[Cantor Fitzgerald]] lost the most artwork. Their offices on the 105th floor of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|North Tower]] housed a gallery called the “Museum in the Sky” which held an estimated 300 casts of [[Rodin]] sculptures.&lt;ref name="Economist" /&gt;

Some of the Rodin works were recovered a quarter mile away from Ground Zero, including a bust from ''[[The Burghers of Calais]]'', two of the three figures from ''The Three Shades'', and a cast of ''[[The Thinker]]''. After being recovered, ''The Thinker'' cast went missing, possibly due to theft.&lt;ref name="Born" /&gt;

===Citigroup===
The collection of Citigroup, whose office was in [[List of tenants in 7 World Trade Center|
World Trade Center Building 7]], contained 1113 works of art which were all lost on September 11, 2001, according to Suzanne F. W. Lemakis who was the Citigroup Art Curator at the time of the attacks.&lt;ref name="Citigroup1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ifar.org/nineeleven/911_citi1.htm |title=

The Citigroup collection at the World Trade Center consisted of about 75% prints, many of which were mass-produced and were replaceable. Also lost were English and American antique furniture, and Asian porcelains.&lt;ref name="Citigroup2"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ifar.org/nineeleven/911_citi2.htm |title=

According to Lemakis, the most expensive painting in Citigroup’s collection was a large mural depicting Wall Street, painted by an unknown designer.&lt;ref name="Citigroup2" /&gt;

===Fred Alger===
Also located in the North Tower, this firm lost a collection of photographs by photographers including [[Cindy Sherman]] and [[Hiroshi Sugimoto]].&lt;ref name="Economist" /&gt;

===Bank of America===
Bank of America’s office in the World Trade Center lost over 100 works of art by contemporary artists.&lt;ref name="Economist" /&gt;

===J.P. Morgan Chase=== 
At the time of the attack, the firm had only five lithographs in its Trade Center office, keeping most of its corporate art collection of over 17,000 works of art at its offices two blocks from the World Trade Center.&lt;ref name="Economist" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Born"&gt;{{cite news |last1= Barry|first1=Dan |last2= Rashbaum|first2=William K.|date= 20 May 2002|title=Born of Hell, Lost After Inferno; Rodin Work From Trade Center Survived, and Vanished |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/20/nyregion/born-hell-lost-after-inferno-rodin-work-trade-center-survived-vanished.html|work= New York Times|location= New York City|access-date=1 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art studios in the World Trade Center==
The Lower Manhattan Cultural Council had its offices in Building 5 of the World Trade Center, and two studios on the 91st and 92nd floors of [[The North Tower]].  
The Council hosted an artist-in-residency program, called World Views, which hosted 15 artists from around the globe and was supposed to run from May–November 2001. The 15 artists worked in the studios in the North Tower. Nearly all of their artwork was lost in the attack on and subsequent collapse of the towers. At least one of the artists, Jamaican-born sculptor Michael Richards, also died in the attacks. Richards had worked through the night in the towers on an unfinished sculpture, a memorial piece dedicated to the [[Tuskegee Airmen]], which portrayed a pilot riding a burning meteor.&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cotter"&gt;{{cite news |last= Cotter|first=Holland |date= 3 December 2001|title=ART REVIEW; The Studios Were Lost, But the Artists Get Their Day |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/03/arts/art-review-the-studios-were-lost-but-the-artists-get-their-day.html|work= New York Times|location= New York City|access-date=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "BBC" /&gt;

The council also lost all of its archives that had been in their offices in Building 5.&lt;ref name="Cotter" /&gt;

==Government art collections==
Twenty-four works from the art collections of the [[Army]], [[Navy]], [[Air Force]], and [[Marine Corps]] were destroyed at [[The Pentagon]] by the attack.

Some works from The Pentagon's library were also damaged, but the majority were ultimately restored.&lt;ref name="cbc"&gt;{{cite news |last1= Bridge|first1=Sarah |last2=Kazi |first2=Stastna|date=21 August 2011 |title= 9/11 anniversary: What was lost in the damage|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/9-11-anniversary-what-was-lost-in-the-damage-1.1123528 |work=CBC |access-date=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Insurance payouts==
Much of the art was not insured for its full value.&lt;ref name="Economist" /&gt;

The  '''Australian Centre of Excellence for Risk Analysis''' (ACERA) is a research institute within the School of Botany at the [[University of Melbourne]] in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]]. It conducts research on a wide range of topics in risk, with an initial focus on [[biosecurity]] risks.

It was founded in 2006 to honour a Federal Government election commitment, with a grant administered through the [[Bureau of Rural Sciences]] of the Federal [[Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (Australia)|Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry]].  The Centre has received a second phase of funding commencing in July 2009 and extending to June 2013.

The Director is [[Mark Burgman]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7187">'''Autecology''' is an approach in [[ecology]] that seeks to explain the distribution and abundance of species by studying interactions of individual organisms with their environments.

Autecology was pioneered by German field botanists in the late 19th century&lt;ref&gt;Cittadino E. 1990. Nature as the Laboratory. Darwinian Plant Ecology in the German  Empire,  1880-1900.  Cambridge:  Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. During the 20th century, autecology continued to exist mainly as a descriptive science rather than one with supporting theory and the most notable proponents of an autecological approach, Herbert Andrewartha and Charles Birch, avoided the term autecology when referring to species-focused ecological investigation with emphasis on density-independent processes. Part of the problem with deriving a theoretical structure for autecology is that individual species are unique in their life history and behaviour, making it difficult to draw broad generalisations across them without losing the crucial information that is gained by studying biology at a species level&lt;ref&gt;name=Walter2014/&lt;/ref&gt;. Progress has been made in more recent times with Paterson’s recognition concept of species and the concept of habitat tracking by organisms &lt;ref&gt;Hengeveld R. 1985. Dynamics of Dutch beetle species during the twentieth century  (Coleoptera,  Carabidae).  Journal of  Biogeography  12: 389-411.&lt;/ref&gt;. The most recent attempt at deriving a theoretical structure for autecology was published in 2014 by ecologists Gimme Walter and Rob Hengeveld.

==Basic theory==
===Recognition concept===
Autecological theory is focused on species as the most important unit of biological organisation, as individuals across all populations of a particular species share species-specific adaptations that influence their ecology.&lt;ref&gt;name=Walter2014/&lt;/ref&gt; This particularly relates to reproduction, as individuals of a sexual species share unique adaptations (e.g. courtship songs, pheromones) for recognising potential mates, and share a fertilisation mechanism that differs from those in all other species. This recognition concept of species differs from the biological species concept (or isolation concept) which defines species by cross-mating sterility, which in allopatric speciation is merely a consequence of adaptive change in a new species' fertilisation mechanism to suit a different environment.&lt;ref name=paterson/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2018}}

===Environmental matching===
Individuals from across a species' range tend to be relatively uniform in terms of their dietary and habitat requirements and the range of environmental conditions they can tolerate. These differ from those of other species. Individuals of a species likewise share specific sensory adaptations for recognising suitable habitat. Seasonal changes and variability in climate mean that the spatial and/or temporal distribution of suitable habitat for a species also varies&lt;ref&gt;name=Walter2014/&lt;/ref&gt;.In response, organisms track suitable conditions, for example by migrating in order to remain within suitable habitat, for which there is evidence in the fossil record.&lt;ref&gt;Turner A and Paterson H (1991) Species and speciation: evolutionary tempo and mode in the fossil record reconsidered. Geobios 24:761-769.&lt;/ref&gt; By determining the requirements and tolerances of a particular species, it is possible to predict how individuals of that species will respond to specific environmental changes &lt;ref&gt;name=Walter2014/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Population sizes and replacement level reproduction===

Autecological theory predicts that populations will reproduce at around replacement level unless a period of environmental change causing unusually high or low survival causes the population to grow or shrink before restabilising at replacement level again &lt;ref&gt;Robin  J-P,  Denis  V.  1999.  Squid  stock  fluctuations  and  water  temperature:  temporal analysis of English Channel Loliginidae. Journal of Applied Ecology 36: 101-110.&lt;/ref&gt;. Population numbers may be reduced by introduction of new predation pressure, such as with poor fisheries management or introduction of a biological control agent to control an invasive species, such that net reproductive rate, R0, drops below replacement level&lt;ref&gt;name=Walter2014/&lt;/ref&gt;. The species being preyed upon in each case may stabilise at a lower population density where it is more difficult for individuals of the higher trophic level to locate the prey species, but at this point relieving predation tends to make little difference to population size, as individuals continue to reproduce around replacement level as they were at a higher density prior to the introduction of a higher trophic level &lt;ref&gt;Walter GH (2003) Insect Pest Management and Ecological Research Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. &lt;/ref&gt;.

Knowledge of species-level interactions, tolerances and habitat requirements is valuable for conservation of an endangered plant or animal species by ensuring its particular ecological requirements are met. &lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez-Benito E, Martin C and Iriondo JM (1995) Autecology and conservation of Erodium paularense Fdez.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9836">In 2008 [[Club de Madrid|the Club of Madrid]], the [[Bellona Foundation]] and the utility company [[Hafslund ASA]] joined forces to organize the top level climate conference in Norway called [[#CC8]] (Climate Conference 08: Technology and Finance in Climate Cooperation). In 2009 the same organizers are arranging '''CC9''' (Climate Conference 09: Green Technology and Finance – Striking a Fair Climate Deal) which will take place on 4 and 5 June at Hafslund Manor in Sarpsborg, Norway. It will be followed by a climate festival for children in the adjacent park on 6 June.

== Climate Conference 09 ==

The objective of CC9 is to contribute to the conclusion of a fair climate agreement by advancing the potential of [[green technology]] and adequate funding. Investing in the development and diffusion of green technologies and renewable energy is a sustainable way to stimulate the economy and create new jobs - sustainable economic growth that can reinforce efforts to [[Climate change mitigation|combat climate change]] while respecting development needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=CC9 | url=http://www.cc9.no/index.asp?artikkelid=1599 | accessdate=2009-06-02 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615080910/http://www.cc9.no/index.asp?artikkelid=1599# | archive-date=2009-06-15 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prestigious names to the conference ===

[[Haakon, Crown Prince of Norway|His Royal Highnesses Crown Prince Haakon of Norway]] will open the Conference. 

Among those who will be speaking at CC9 is [[Robert F. Kennedy Jr.]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Bellona Web | url=http://www.bellona.org/articles/articles_2008/kennedyToAttendConferenceInNorway | accessdate=2009-06-02 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090613074513/http://www.bellona.org/articles/articles_2008/kennedyToAttendConferenceInNorway# | archive-date=2009-06-13 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; who has made a name for himself as a clear-headed and dynamic advocate for the environment. Kennedy founded and now chairs the [[Waterkeeper Alliance]], an organization working to improve water quality in the US and elsewhere in the world. In his work as a lawyer, Kennedy handles cases for the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]]  (NRDC), one of the largest environmental organizations in the US. The NRDC is known as a solution-oriented and competent player in the environmental field. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is the first member of the [[Kennedy family]] to visit Norway.

In addition to Mr. Kennedy, many other prestigious names will be participating at CC9, including Norwegian Prime Minister [[Jens Stoltenberg]], Norwegian Minister of the Environment and International Development [[Erik Solheim]] and [[Stephen O. Andersen]], director of Strategic Climate Projects in the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA).

[[Stephen O. Andersen]] is a senior, renowned environmental expert, working for the EPA, the closest equivalent the USA has to a Ministry of the Environment. Mr. Andersen has been a key player in the work on the Montreal Protocol, an exceptionally successful international environmental treaty that negotiated the elimination of ozone-depleting gases and effectively saved the ozone layer. Andersen is the EPA's director of strategic projects, in the Climate Protection Partnerships Division.

Also from the USA comes [[Ira Magaziner]], head of the Clinton Climate Initiative (CCI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Clinton Climate Initiative | url=http://www.clintonfoundation.org/what-we-do/clinton-climate-initiative/ | accessdate=2009-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CCI forms part of the William J. Clinton Foundation (founded by former US president Bill Clinton). The foundation's work includes efforts to cut the costs of climate technology (for renewable energy and energy efficiency) in large cities.

Representing the African continent are the former president of Tanzania, [[Benjamin Mkapa]], and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Niger [[Aïchatou Mindaoudou]]. Mindaoudou is a well-known figure in the field of international development, and she will be giving a speech at CC9 entitled "What is at stake for women and the planet - climate change and sustainable development in Africa. Business models for poverty alleviation and green growth".

A number of participants from Asia and Europe will also be present at the climate conference.

== Climate Conference 08 ==

Starting out on World Environment Day, the conference gathered 100 exclusively selected international representatives from politics, academia, the private sector and the environmental movement at the Hafslund Manor in Sarpsborg south of Oslo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=CC8 | url=http://www.cc8.no/index.asp?artikkelid=1416&amp;site=conferance | accessdate=2009-06-02 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110620184329/http://www.cc8.no/index.asp?artikkelid=1416&amp;site=conferance# | archive-date=2011-06-20 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the distinguished speakers were: Ricardo Lagos, former president of Chile, UN Special Envoy on climate change and president of the Club of Madrid; Lord Nicholas Stern, author of the notable report on the economic ramifications of climate change; Göran Persson, former Prime Minister of Sweden who, together with Ricardo Lagos, co-chairs the International Socialist Commission for a Sustainable World Society  Also attending from the Club of Madrid was Jennifer Mary Shipley, former Prime Minister of New Zealand, Kjell Magne Bondevik and Gro Harlem Brundtland, both former Prime Ministers of Norway. The Club of Madrid, the Bellona Foundation and Hafslund ASA set out to organize an ambitious, pro-development, creative and solutions-oriented conference which could act in a joint effort to provide input for the international negotiation process on a new climate agreement.

Negotiations for a post-2012 global climate change agreement were formally launched at the climate summit in Bali last December and are expected to be concluded in Copenhagen in 2009. With this process underway, the Club of Madrid, the Bellona Foundation and Hafslund ASA joined forces to spur ideas for a final agreement that will be both ambitious and realistic, as well as providing predictability in efforts to combat climate change.

Thorough discussions in small working groups enabled the drafting of ambitious, creative and solutions-oriented recommendations in a final statement from the conference. In order to inform the post-2012 negotiations, the aim will be to reach out to both negotiators and policy makers and industry and the business community.

At the Bali summit, it was agreed to concentrate the negotiations on mitigation, adaptation, technology and finance. The CC8 conference «Technology and Finance in Climate Cooperation» focuses specifically on what technology and finance provisions a new agreement on climate change should include.

The co-organizers are convinced that successful outcomes in these fields will be essential to enable ambitious overall emission reduction targets (the overall objective of an agreement) and solve the contradiction between, on the one hand, rich countries’ responsibility for climate change and, on the other hand, the necessity to limit emissions also of emerging economies.

=== Climate Concert ===

Saturday 7 June the marathon "Climate Concert 08" was arranged in the park surrounding the Hafslund Manor in Sarpsborg. Well-known Norwegian bands were on stage. The environmental issues from the Climate Conference 08 coloured all parts of the arrangement; the food served, transportation and power supply.

The artists performing on Climate Conference 08, were [[Bertine Zetlitz]], [[Surferosa]], [[deLillos 85|deLillos'85]], [[Henning Kvitnes]], [[Kaizers Orchestra]], [[Madcon]], [[CC Cowboys]] and [[Ida Maria]].

== Background ==

Against the backdrop of an unprecedented global economic crisis, the next months will be decisive for reaching a politically viable and fair post-2012 climate agreement in Copenhagen 2009.

Few players inside negotiation circles expect developing countries to make significant moves before developed countries have clarified their positions on emission reductions, financing and diffusion of green technology.

Copenhagen must deliver on the human dimension of climate change. It is clear that the poorest, those least responsible, will be most vulnerable to climate change. Countries that have accumulated tremendous economic growth through their historic reliance on fossil fuels must assume a leadership role in cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Likewise, it will be critical to secure the development and diffusion of appropriate, clean technology and the access to necessary financial resources for developing countries to adopt them.

The global crisis constitutes a tremendous opportunity for governments to address the weaknesses of the existing, international financial system but, more importantly, to lay the foundations for the development of a green and sustainable economy. Investing in clean technologies can be key to this process, creating employment opportunities across the globe while addressing the challenge of climate change. In this sense, the adoption of sectoral approaches within the negotiations could, in fact, facilitate technology development and the adoption of best available technologies across regions, between developed and developing countries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3002">The '''Central Register and Clearing House (CRCH)''' was an administrative organisation in teacher education in England and Wales which existed for almost sixty years.  It pre-dated by some thirty years a similar organisation for university courses ([[Universities Central Council on Admissions|UCCA]]).

By the late 1920s great confusion had developed in admissions to teacher training courses.  There were some fifty colleges. Potential students applied direct to each one and could receive an unlimited number of offers of places.  Colleges had no idea how many students would arrive, and applicants had no central source of vacancy information.  Problems were eased by ad hoc co-operation between the colleges and their joint Committee of Principals, but it became clear that an administrative solution was needed.  The Training Colleges Clearing House was the result and was founded in 1933.  Under the new system a candidate was considered in turn by only one college at a time, from a list chosen by each applicant, with forwarding of the application ceasing when a place was offered.&lt;ref&gt;Association of Teachers in Colleges and Departments of Education (ATCDE), Handbook of Colleges and Departments of Education.  Published every two years from 1954 then annually from 1967 to 1992.  The edition cited is 1973, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1943 the Committee of Principals became the [[Association of Teachers in Colleges and Departments of Education (ATCDE)]].  By 1944 there were some 55 colleges and about 5000 applicants.  There was a large post-war expansion in numbers being trained as teachers.  From 1960 the Clearing House worked in close co-existence with the new [[Graduate Teacher Training Registry]].  In 1962 the newly renamed Central Register and Clearing House was set up as a limited company but was still supervised by the ATCDE and was based at their offices in Crawford Place, London W1.  By 1972 the scheme had 160 member colleges and 56000 applicants.

The CRCH was involved in discussions with both UCCA and the polytechnics as early as 1972 about the future shape of higher education admissions.&lt;ref&gt;Kay, Ronald, "UCCA: Its Origins and Development 1950-85, UCCA, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;  

CRCH handled applications to non-teaching degree courses as these began to be introduced at its member colleges. The CRCH ceased to function after the cycle leading to admissions in 1992 and its responsibilities passed on to [[UCAS]].  Its records are lodged in the Library at the University of Warwick.  Some had already been published in an earlier document.&lt;ref&gt;Sowerbutts, Beryl, Record of the Clearing House 1960-1984, published privately, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''College for Advanced Studies in Social Theory''' ({{lang-hu|Társadalomelméleti Kollégium}}, ''TEK'') is the second oldest college of its type at the [[Corvinus University of Budapest]] as well as in [[Hungary]].

== History ==

TEK is the second oldest, still operating, college in Hungary. It was founded in 1981 by young researchers and students. Its orientation can be divided into two parts: vocational work and community life. The first is well documented, the latter is somewhat more distorted, due to the effects of [[collective memory]].
[[Image:Marx old.jpg|thumb|right|[[Karl Marx]]]]

=== 1981–present ===

TEK seceded from the first established college in Hungary, the [[Rajk László College for Advanced Studies]].
However, in the beginning - before [[revolutions of 1989|the fall of the Iron Curtain]] - the College's main topic was the reinterpretation of [[Marx]]'s ouvre, since liberal and alternative thinking was only possible if it was related to Marxist studies. With the fall of the iron curtain, this coercion disappeared, and since the College's main profile was its diversity and openness to new ideas, philosophies and theories, the College's profile now freely and rapidly ramified into diverse - and pioneering among the Hungarian colleges at that time - topics: [[environmentalism]], [[sustainability]], [[postmodernism]], [[anarchism]], [[postmarxism]], [[sociolinguistics]], [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[post-structuralism]], [[Buddhist economics]], [[feminism]], [[minority group|sociology of minorities]], [[queer studies]], [[postcolonialism]], [[network theory]]. The College also dealt with the topic of [[squatting]], the sociological causes of [[poverty]] and since the establishment the farmost detailed analysis of [[critical theory]]/[[Frankfurt school]] among other colleges.

== Philosophical principles ==
=== Criticism ===

TEK is providing a critical approach to the economical theories that Corvinus University has in its educational program– among others, focusing on the social inequalities [[human resources]], [[structuralism]], [[neoliberalism]], [[functionalism (sociology)|functionalism]], [[corporatism]] inherently bares -.
TEK is also involved in highly regarded green activism, such as [[critical mass]], [[gay pride]], many [[flashmob]]s, that are held in support of promoting a livable environment. Among the members of TEK are also permanent supporters of the anti-[[g8]] anti-[[g20]] demonstrations.

=== Commune ===
The TEK started a lifestyle experiment, by establishing - again firstly - the habit of an annual [[commune (intentional community)|commune]],  in which the members apply voluntarily. These communes give the participants the opportunity to experience such a lifestyle that is hard to experience among European [[capitalist]] societies. In these communities the members share all goods, live together in one place creating a highly tied community of a few.

=== Aims ===

TEK’s main aim is a critical approach to the topics taught in Corvinus University.
TEK is more of a theoretical college, putting theoretical approaches to the questions of the society in front of bare statistical analysis, processing of data.
However members of TEK – individually - are highly involved in diverse fields of practice – e.g. organizing conferences on behalf of the homeless, many voluntary work promoting the reintegration of gypsies into the labour market, helping the educational development of those from less developed areas -.

== Vocational work ==
=== Tutorials ===

The base of the vocational work in TEK are the annual or semi-annual Tutorials. The topics of these Tutorials are given by the members of the College, which Tutorials are to be held by the tutors after compiling a schedule. The participants analyse, discuss the literature together with the tutor. As a conclusion, at the end of every tutorial, the participants are to hand in an essay of one of the topics that were discussed during the Tutorial.
The main frame for the Tutorials are based on 5 main fields: [[political economy]], economics of [[globalization]], Frankfurt School, [[green economics|green]] and [[Justice (economics)|ethical]] economics, postmodern sociology.
Every fresher has to participate in the Ground Tutorial, which provides a brief insight to the work and schedule of all five fields.

=== Related works ===

[http://fordulat.net Fordulat] (meaning “facing” or “twist”) is the official periodical of the College, dealing with many critical and however yet not mainstream, but pioneering topics.

=== Conferences ===

Among many others, [[Claus Offe]], one of the leading political sociologists and of the second generation Frankfurt School attended one of the conferences held by the College.

[[File:Old woman draught at Ratcliffe Highway.png|thumb|250px|right|Punishing a common scold in the [[ducking stool]]]]

In the [[common law]] of [[criminal law|crime]] in [[England and Wales]], a '''common [[wiktionary:scold|scold]]''' was a type of public nuisance—a troublesome and angry person who broke the public peace by habitually chastising, arguing and quarrelling with their neighbours. The majority of individuals punished for scolding were women, though men could also be labelled scolds. 

The offence, which was exported to North America with the colonists, was punished by monetary fines, but also by methods intended to publicly humiliate such as [[cucking stool|ducking]]: being placed in a chair and submerged in a river or pond. Although rarely prosecuted it remained on the [[statute book]]s in England and Wales until 1967.

==The offence and its punishment==

=== Medieval England ===
The offence of scolding developed from the late middle ages in England. It has been suggested that attempts to control and punish 'bad speech' increased after the [[Black Death in England|Black Death]], when demographic shift led to greater resistance and threats to the status quo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bardsley|first=Sandy|date=2006|title=Sin, Speech and Scolding in Late Medieval England|url=|journal=Fama: The Politics of Talk and Reputation in Medieval Europe, ed. Thelma Fenster and Daniel Lord Smail|volume=|pages=146-8|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included prosecutions for scolding. Scolds were described using a number of Latin terms, including ''objurgator, garulator, rixator'' and ''litigator'', found in both masculine and feminine forms in medieval legal records and all referring to negative forms of speech, chatter, quarrelling or reproachment. Scolding offences were commonly presented and punished in [[Manorial court|manorial]] and borough courts that governed the behaviour of peasants and townspeople across England. Scolds were also presented in church courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/65767599|title=Gender and petty crime in late medieval England : the local courts in Kent, 1460-1560|last=Jones|first=Karen|date=2006|publisher=Boydell Press|year=|isbn=184383216X|location=Woodbridge|pages=104-106|oclc=65767599}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common punishment was a monetary fine.

Various historians have argued that scolding and bad speech were coded as feminine offences by the late medieval period. Women of all marital statuses were prosecuted for scolding, though married women featured most frequently, while widows were rarely labelled scolds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/891396093|title=Venomous tongues : speech and gender in late medieval England|last=Sandy,|first=Bardsley,|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780812239362|location=Philadelphia|pages=123-125|oclc=891396093}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some places, such as Exeter, scolds were typically poorer women, whereas elsewhere scolds could include members of the local elite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/891396093|title=Venomous tongues : speech and gender in late medieval England|last=Sandy,|first=Bardsley,|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780812239362|location=Philadelphia|pages=135-136|oclc=891396093}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women who were also charged with other offences, such as violence, nightwandering, eavesdropping or sexual impropriety were also likely to be labelled scolds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/891396093|title=Venomous tongues : speech and gender in late medieval England|last=Sandy,|first=Bardsley,|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780812239362|location=Philadelphia|pages=137|oclc=891396093}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals were frequently labelled 'common scolds', indicating the impact of their behaviour and speech on the whole community. Karen Jones identified 13 men prosecuted for scolding in Kent's secular courts, compared to 94 women and 2 couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/65767599|title=Gender and petty crime in late medieval England : the local courts in Kent, 1460-1560|last=1939-|first=Jones, Karen,|date=2006|publisher=Boydell Press|year=|isbn=184383216X|location=Woodbridge|pages=108|oclc=65767599}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men accused of scolding were often charged alongside their wives. Helen, wife of Peter Bradwall scolded Hugh Welesson and Isabel, his wife, in Middlewich in 1434, calling Isabel a "child murderer" and Hugh a "skallet [wretched] knave". Isabel and Hugh also scolded Helen, calling her a "lesyng blebberer" (lying bletherer). All parties were fined for the offences, though Hugh and Isabel were fined jointly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/891396093|title=Venomous tongues : speech and gender in late medieval England|last=Sandy,|first=Bardsley,|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780812239362|location=Philadelphia|pages=102|oclc=891396093}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like women, male scolds were often accused of many other offences, such as fornication, theft, illegal trading, and assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/891396093|title=Venomous tongues : speech and gender in late medieval England|last=Sandy,|first=Bardsley,|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780812239362|location=Philadelphia|pages=103|oclc=891396093}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Later punishments of scolding ===
Later legal treatises reflected the dominance of scolding as a female offence. In the ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', [[William Blackstone|Blackstone]] says of this offence:

{{quote|text=Lastly, a common scold, {{lang|la|communis rixatrix}}, (for our law-latin confines it to the feminine gender) is a public nuisance to her neighbourhood. For which offence she may be indicted; and, if convicted, shall be sentenced to be placed in a certain engine of correction called the trebucket, castigatory, or cucking stool, which in the Saxon language signifies the scolding stool; though now it is frequently corrupted into ducking stool, because the residue of the judgment is, that, when she is so placed therein, she shall be plunged in the water for her punishment.|sign=[[Commentaries on the Laws of England|Bl. Comm.]] IV:13.5.8, p. *169}} 
[[Image:The Branks from Curious Punishments of Bygone Days (1896) - 02.jpg|thumb|right|Scold's bridles or branks were probably used as a punishment but no official records of their use have been found.]]
The prescribed penalty for this offence involved dunking the convicted offender in water in an instrument called the "[[cucking stool]]".  The cucking stool, according to Blackstone, eventually became known as a ''ducking stool'' by [[folk etymology]].

Other writers disagree with Blackstone's assertion equating the two sorts of punishment seat.  The ''[[Domesday Book]]'' notes the use of a cucking stool at [[Chester]], a seat also known as {{lang|la|cathedra stercoris}}, a "dung chair", whose punishment apparently involved exposing the sitter's buttocks to onlookers.  This seat served to punish not only scolds, but also brewers and bakers who sold bad ale or bread, whereas the ducking stool dunked its victim into the water. [[Francois Maximilian Misson]], a French traveller and writer, recorded the method used in England in the early 18th century:&lt;ref name="AME"&gt;{{cite book |title=Curious Punishments of Bygone Days |chapter=The Ducking Stool |author=Alice Morse Earle |year=1896 |url=http://www.getchwood.com/punishments/curious/chapter-2.html |accessdate=18 January 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070117004233/http://www.getchwood.com/punishments/curious/chapter-2.html |archivedate=17 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=The way of punishing scolding women is pleasant enough. They fasten an armchair to the end of two beams twelve or fifteen feet long, and parallel to each other, so that these two pieces of wood with their two ends embrace the chair, which hangs between them by a sort of axle, by which means it plays freely, and always remains in the natural horizontal position in which a chair should be, that a person may sit conveniently in it, whether you raise it or let it down. They set up a post on the bank of a pond or river, and over this post they lay, almost in equilibrio, the two pieces of wood, at one end of which the chair hangs just over the water. They place the woman in this chair and so plunge her into the water as often as the sentence directs, in order to cool her immoderate heat.}}

The ducking stool, rather than being fixed in position by the river or pond, could be mounted on wheels to allow the convicted woman to be paraded through the streets before punishment was carried out. Another method of ducking was to use the tumbrel, which consisted of a chair on two wheels with two long shafts fixed to the axles. This would be pushed into the ducking pond and the shafts would be released, tipping the chair up backwards and ducking the occupant.&lt;ref name="ne"&gt;{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Ducking and Cucking Stools |volume=8 |page=361}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[scold's bridle]], known in Scotland as a brank, consists of a locking metal mask or [[head cage]] that contains a tab that fits in the mouth to inhibit talking. Some have claimed that convicted common scolds had to wear such a device as a preventive or punitive measure. Legal sources do not mention them in the context of the punishment of common scolds, but there are anecdotal reports of their historical use as a public punishment.&lt;ref name="Dugdale"&gt;{{cite book|title=England and Wales Delineated: Historical, Entertaining &amp; Commercial|author=Thomas Dugdale, William Burnett|year=1860|pages=1238}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LandC"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Transactions of the Historic Society of Lancashire and Cheshire|author=Frederick W. Fairholt|title=On a Grotesque Mask of Punishment Obtained in the Castle of Nuremberg|publisher=J.H. Parker for the Historic Society of Lancashire and Cheshire|location= 377, Strand. London|year=1855|pages=62–64|volume=VII}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 17th-century [[New England]] and [[Long Island]], scolds or those convicted of similar offences—both men and women—could be sentenced to stand with their tongue in a cleft stick, a more primitive but easier-to-construct version of the scold's bridle,&lt;ref name="AME2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Curious Punishments of Bygone Days|chapter=Branks and gags|author=Alice Morse Earle|year=1896|url=http://www.getchwood.com/punishments/curious/chapter-8.html|accessdate=18 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the ducking stool also made the trip across the Atlantic.&lt;ref name="AME" /&gt;

==Historical prosecutions==
[[Image:The Ducking-Stool from Curious Punishments of Bygone Days (1896).jpg|right|thumb|This [[woodcut]] shows the wheels on the ducking stool which allowed the occupant to be wheeled through the streets before being ducked.]]

A plaque on the Fye Bridge in [[Norwich]], England claims to mark the site of a "cucking" stool, and that from 1562–1597 "[[strumpet]]s" and common scolds suffered the punishment of dunking there.  In the ''Percy Anecdotes'', published pseudonymously by [[Thomas Byerley (journalist)|Thomas Byerley]] and [[Joseph Clinton Robertson]] in 1821{{ndash}}23, the authors state that "How long the ducking-stool has been in disuse in England does not appear."&lt;ref name="percy"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Percy Anecdotes|author=[[Reuben Percy]] and [[Sholto Percy]]|year=1823|publisher=Printed for T. Boys|location=London|url=http://www.mspong.org/percy/crime.htm#TheDuckingStool|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040910073842/http://www.mspong.org/percy/crime.htm#TheDuckingStool|archivedate=10 September 2004|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Anecdotes'' also suggest [[penology|penological]] ineffectiveness as grounds for the stool's disuse; the text relates the 1681 case of a Mrs. Finch, who according to this account had received three convictions and duckings as a common scold.  On her fourth conviction, the [[King's Bench]] declined to dunk her again, and instead ordered her to pay a fine of three [[mark (money)|marks]], and ordered her imprisoned until payment took place.

The ''Percy Anecdotes'' also quote a pastoral poem by [[John Gay]] (1685{{ndash}}1732), who wrote that:

{{poemquote|I'll speed me to the pond, where the high stool
On the long plank, hangs o'er the muddy pool,
That stool the dread of ev'ry scolding quean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spenserians.cath.vt.edu/TextRecord.php?textsid=33871 |title=The Shepherd's Week : Wednesday; or, The Dumps |author=John Gay |date=1714 |accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

and a 1780 poem by [[Benjamin West]], who wrote that:

{{poemquote|There stands, my friend, in yonder pool,
An engine call'd a ducking-stool;
By legal pow'r commanded down,
The joy and terror of the town.
If jarring females kindle strife...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/34005/34005-h/34005-h.htm#Page_11 |title=Curious Punishments of Bygone Days |author=Alice Morse Earle |website=Project Gutenberg |date=1896 |accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While these literary sources do not prove that the punishment still took place, they do provide evidence that it had not been forgotten.

In ''The Queen v. Foxby'', 6 Mod. 11 (1704), counsel for the accused stated that he knew of no law for the dunking of scolds.  Lord Chief Justice [[John Holt (judge)|John Holt]] of the Queen's Bench apparently pronounced this error, for he announced that it was "better ducking in a [[Trinity Sunday|Trinity]], than a [[Michaelmas]] [[quarter Sessions|term]]", i.e. better carried out in summer than in winter.  The tenor of Holt's remarks however suggests that he found the punishment an antiquarian curiosity and something of a joke.&lt;ref name="fc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/amendVIIIs19.html|title=The Founders Constitution:Volume 5, Amendment VIII, Document 19|year=1987|publisher=University of Chicago|accessdate=18 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The last recorded uses of the stool for ducking involve a Mrs. Ganble at [[Plymouth]] (1808) and Jenny Pipes, a notorious scold from  [[Leominster]] (1809). In 1817 Sarah Leeke, also from Leominster was sentenced to be ducked but the water in the pond was so low that the authorities merely wheeled her round the town in the chair.&lt;ref name="ne" /&gt;

The English common law as received by the law of the United States included the offence of being a common scold.  In 1829, a Washington, D.C. court found the American [[anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] writer [[Anne Royall]] guilty of being a common scold, the outcome of a campaign launched against her by local clergymen.  Despite the construction of the traditional engine of punishment by sailors at the Navy Yard, the court ruled the punishment of the cucking-stool obsolete, and instead improvised a fine of ten dollars.&lt;ref name="LC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/0001/royall.html|title=An Uncommon Scold|publisher=Library of Congress|author=Cynthia Earman|date=January 2001|accessdate=18 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current status of the law==
In England and Wales, the only part of the United Kingdom where the law had any effect, no prosecutions of common scolds occurred for a considerable period.{{vague|date=November 2017}} Counsel in ''Sykes v. Director of Public Prosecutions'' [1962] AC 528 described the offence as "obsolete", and section 13(1)(a) of the [[Criminal Law Act 1967]] eventually abolished it.

The common law offence of being a common scold was extant in New Jersey until struck down in 1972 by Circuit Judge McCann who found it had been subsumed in the provisions of the Disorderly Conduct Act of 1898, was bad for vagueness and offended the [[14th Amendment to the US Constitution]] for sex discrimination. Long before this decision, the punishment of ducking, together with all other forms of corporeal punishment, had become unlawful under the provisions of the [[New Jersey Constitution of 1844]] or even as early as 1776.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=State of New Jersey v. Marion Palendrano |vol= 120 N.J. Super. 336 (1972)|reporter= |opinion= McCann JCC|court= Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division (Criminal)|date= 13 July 1972|url=http://law.justia.com/cases/new-jersey/appellate-division-published/1972/120-n-j-super-336-0.html |accessdate=28 May 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, many states have laws restricting public [[profanity]], excessive [[noise (environmental)|noise]], and [[disorderly conduct]]. None of these laws carry the distinctive punishment originally reserved for the common scold, nor are they gender-specific as the common scold offense was.

The '''Doctor of Business Administration''' (commonly abbreviated as DBA, DrBA, or BusD and most recently {{cite web|url=http://guide.berkeley.edu/courses/phdba/|title=PH.DBA|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archivedate=2018-07-22|dead-url=|access-date=|df=}}) is a [[research doctorate]] awarded on the basis of advanced study and [[research]] in the field of [[business administration]]. The D.B.A. is a [[terminal degree]] in business administration.&lt;ref name="ed.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ous/international/usnei/us/doctorate.doc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127015732/http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ous/international/usnei/us/doctorate.doc |archivedate=2012-01-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the Ph.D., it represents the highest academic qualification in business administration. Successful completion of a D.B.A. or Ph.D. in business administration is required to gain employment as a full-time, tenure-track university [[professor]] or [[Postdoctoral researcher | postdoctoral researcher]] in the field. As with other earned research doctorates, individuals with the degree are awarded the academic title [[Doctor (title)|doctor]], which is often represented via the [[English honorific]] "Dr." or the [[post-nominal letters]] "DBA",or "Ph.D.".

D.B.A. candidates submit a significant project, typically referred to as a [[thesis]] or [[dissertation]], consisting of a body of original academic research that is in principle worthy of publication in a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] journal.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dinham |first1=S. |last2=Scott |first2=C. |doi=10.1080/03098770020030498 |title=The Experience of Disseminating the Results of Doctoral Research |journal=Journal of Further and Higher Education |volume=25 |pages=45–55 |year=2001 |pmid= |pmc=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Candidates must [[Thesis defense|defend]] this work before a panel of expert examiners called a thesis, dissertation, or doctoral committee.&lt;ref name="aacsb.edu"&gt;FAQs AACSB {{cite web|url=http://www.aacsb.edu/home-bestbizschools/doctorate/programs/dba/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117024642/http://www.aacsb.edu/home-bestbizschools/doctorate/programs/dba/ |archivedate=2015-11-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and format==
Doctor of Business Administration programs have a dual purpose: contribute to business theory and further develop the professional practice (e.g. contribute to professional knowledge in business). Universities generally require candidates to have significant experience in business, particularly in roles with leadership or other strategic responsibilities. D.B.A. candidates specialize in areas such as management science, information technology management, organizational behaviour, economics, finance and the like. As with other doctorate programs, curricula may be offered on a full-time or part-time basis. According to the European higher education standards set by the [[Bologna Process]], the normal duration of doctorate programs like the D.B.A.{{Citation needed|reason=not clear where D.B.A. are mentionned into Bologna Process|date=March 2018}} and Ph.D is 4 years of full-time study.

The responsibility for the structure of doctoral programs resides within the graduate research committees or their equivalent within the university. As such, D.B.A programs have a specific set of university regulations and are subject to quality approval processes. Regulations include references to protocols for treating ethical issues in research. These regulations are widely used in Australian Universities. For instance, a D.B.A student cannot embark on the research phase before passing all his or her coursework. Furthermore, upon passing the proposal stage, he or she must clear ethics-related issues with an Ethics Committee. The D.B.A candidate must go through numerous internal moderations of the dissertation before submitting to external examinations (usually at least two). Successful candidates usually revise their dissertations numerous times before final approval is granted from the doctoral committee.

==Relationship between D.B.A. and Ph.D==
The Doctor of Business Administration and the Ph.D in Business Administration are equivalent degrees.&lt;ref name="ed.gov"/&gt; Both doctorates are research doctorates representing the highest academic qualification in business in the United States. As such, both D.B.A. and Ph.D programs require students to develop original research leading to a dissertation defense.&lt;ref name="aacsb.edu"/&gt; Furthermore, both doctorates enable holders to become faculty members at academic institutions. The D.B.A. and Ph.D in Business Administration are terminal degrees, allowing the recipient to obtain a tenure-track position.

In some cases, as in that of Harvard University, the distinction is solely administrative (Harvard Business School is not authorized to issue Ph.Ds; only the Faculty of Arts and Sciences may do so).&lt;ref&gt;Admissions FAQs Harvard http://www.hbs.edu/doctoral/faqs/Pages/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases,the distinction is one of orientation and intended outcomes. The Ph.D is highly focused on developing theoretical knowledge, while the D.B.A. emphasizes applied research.&lt;ref name="aacsb.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="athab"&gt;http://www.mba.athabascau.ca/titanweb/au/webcms.nsf/AllDoc/B432DD075D38015987257076007C6B25?Opendocument Athabasca University: DBA vs PhD&lt;/ref&gt; Upon completion, graduates of Ph.D programs generally migrate to full-time faculty positions in academia, while those of D.B.A. programs re-emerge in industry as applied researchers or executives. If working full-time in industry, graduates of D.B.A. and Ph.D programs often become [[Adjunct professors in the United States| adjunct professors]] in top undergraduate and graduate degree programs.

==Geographic distribution==
D.B.A. programs are offered worldwide. The majority, however, are offered in Europe (42 percent), followed by North America (28 percent) and the Asia-Pacific region (22 percent). 6 percent of the programs are offered in Africa and 2 percent in Latin America and the Caribbean. {{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

The program was created by Project ''Dragonfly'' at [[Miami University]] in Oxford, Ohio. Earth Expeditions courses also count toward a master's degree in global leadership, education, and environmental stewardship through the Global Field Program (GFP).

== Brief history and courses==

The "Earth Expeditions" program began in 2003 as a global education and conservation initiative from Miami University. Earth Expeditions graduate courses can be used toward a Master of Arts in Teaching in the Biological Sciences or a Master of Arts in Biology from Miami. Example Earth Expeditions graduate courses:&lt;ref&gt;Myers et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission ==

The mission of Earth Expeditions is to build an alliance of people with direct knowledge of inquiry-driven, community-based learning for the benefit of ecological communities, student achievement, and global understanding.
The image of people who merely transmit and receive knowledge from books is of limited usefulness in an era of rapid social, environmental and technological change. This program envisions each person as an ambassador who creates and transmits knowledge and who promotes authentic dialogue at all levels of society, inspiring others to do the same. With the adoption of participatory models of education, schools become centers of investigation, students engage more deeply in their studies, and communities achieve higher levels of self-determination.

== Project ''Dragonfly'' ==

Since its inception nearly 20 years ago, '''Project ''Dragonfly''''' has reached millions of children, parents and educators through [[science learning]] media, exhibits, and graduate programs. The project began in 1994 with the creation of the award-winning ''Dragonfly'' magazine, the first national magazine to feature the investigations and discoveries of children.  Created in 1994 at [[Miami University]], ''Dragonfly'' magazine was funded by NSF and published by the [[National Science Teachers Association]]. Through mid-2000, the magazine published young investigators alongside such adult researchers as Dr. [[Jane Goodall]].

Project ''Dragonfly'' pioneered the "Real Kids, Real Science" approach to learning and continues to work for inquiry-driven reform to increase public involvement in science and global understanding. In addition to Earth Expeditions, Project ''Dragonfly'' worked with [[Twin Cities Public Television|TPT]] Public Television to launch the Emmy-Award winning PBS children's television series ''[[DragonflyTV]]'', which led to the 2010 launch of the spinoff series ''[[SciGirls]]'', both produced by TPT Public Television.  Project ''Dragonfly'' also oversees two national exhibit projects: Wild Research and iSaveSpecies, which are creating public research stations at zoos and aquariums nationwide to engage families in science inquiry and conservation action. The [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) has called ''Dragonfly'' "A true innovation and a model of what active learning should be."

==  Founding partners ==

===  Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden ===

[[Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden]] opened in 1875 and is the second oldest zoo in the nation. This national historical landmark hosts more than 500 animal species and 3,000 plant species. More than 1.2 million people visit the Cincinnati Zoo annually. A non-profit entity, the zoo is internationally known for its success in the protection and propagation of plants and animals in danger and engages in research and conservation projects around the world.

The '''''Energiewende''''' ([[German language|German]] for '''[[energy transition]]''') is the planned transition by [[Germany]] to a [[Low-carbon economy|low carbon]], environmentally sound, reliable, and affordable energy supply.&lt;ref name="bmwi-and-bmu-2010"&gt;{{cite book |author1 = Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMWi) |author2 = Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU) |title = Energy concept for an environmentally sound, reliable and affordable energy supply |date = 28 September 2010 |publisher = Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMWi) |place = Berlin, Germany |url = http://www.bmwi.de/English/Redaktion/Pdf/energy-concept,property=pdf,bereich=bmwi,sprache=en,rwb=true.pdf |access-date = 2016-05-01 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161006040920/http://www.bmwi.de/English/Redaktion/Pdf/energy-concept%2Cproperty%3Dpdf%2Cbereich%3Dbmwi%2Csprache%3Den%2Crwb%3Dtrue.pdf |archivedate = 6 October 2016 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nuclear power phase-out#Germany|phase-out]] of Germany's fleet of [[nuclear reactor]]s, to be complete by 2022, is a key part of the program.&lt;ref name="bruninx-etal-2013"&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = Kenneth | last1 = Bruninx | first2 = Darin | last2 = Madzharov | first3 = Erik | last3 = Delarue | first4 = William | last4 = D'haeseleer | title = Impact of the German nuclear phase-out on Europe's electricity generation — a comprehensive study | journal = Energy Policy | volume = 60 | pages = 251–261 | year = 2013 | doi = 10.1016/j.enpol.2013.05.026 | url = https://www.mech.kuleuven.be/en/tme/research/energy_environment/Pdf/wpen2012-15 | access-date = 2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legislative support for the ''Energiewende'' was passed in late 2010 and includes [[greenhouse gas]] (GHG) reductions of 80–95% by 2050 (relative to 1990) and a [[renewable energy]] target of 60% by 2050.&lt;ref name="bmwi-2015-b"&gt;{{cite book | title = The Energy of the Future: Fourth "Energy Transition" Monitoring Report — Summary | date = November 2015 | publisher = Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) | place = Berlin, Germany

The Berlin-based [[Think tank|policy institute]] [[Agora Energiewende]] noted that "while the German approach is not unique worldwide, the speed and scope of the ''Energiewende'' are exceptional".&lt;ref name="agora-2015-a"&gt;{{cite book | author = Agora Energiewende | title = Understanding the Energiewende: FAQ on the ongoing transition of the German power system | year = 2015 | publisher = [[Agora Energiewende]] | place = Berlin, Germany | url = http://www.agora-energiewende.de/fileadmin/Projekte/2015/Understanding_the_EW/Agora_Understanding_the_Energiewende.pdf | access-date = 2016-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany has made significant progress on its GHG [[emissions reduction]] target, achieving a 27% decrease between 1990 and 2014. 
However the country will need to maintain an average GHG emissions abatement rate of 3.5% per year to reach its ''Energiewende'' goal, equal to the maximum historical value thus far.&lt;ref name="hillebrandt-etal-2015"&gt;

As of 2013, Germany spends €1.5{{nbsp}}billion per year on energy research in an effort to solve the technical and social issues raised by the transition.&lt;ref name="schiermeier-2013"&gt;{{cite news | first = Quirin | last = Schiermeier | title = Renewable power: Germany's energy gamble: an ambitious plan to slash greenhouse-gas emissions must clear some high technical and economic hurdles | date = 10 April 2013 | work = Nature

== The term ''Energiewende'' ==

[[File:Biogas Photovoltaik Wind.jpg|thumb|The main renewable energy sources in Germany: [[biomass]], [[wind energy]], and [[photovoltaics]]]]

The term ''Energiewende'' was first contained in the title of a 1980 publication by the German [[Öko-Institut]], calling for the complete abandonment of nuclear and petroleum energy.&lt;ref name="krause-etal-1980"&gt;

}} In support of the claim that Krause et al (1980) was the first use of the term ''Energiewende''.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|223}}
The most groundbreaking claim was that economic growth was possible without increased energy consumption.&lt;ref&gt;https://book.energytransition.org/origin-term-energiewende&lt;/ref&gt;  On 16{{nbsp}}February 1980, the German Federal Ministry of the Environment also hosted a symposium in Berlin, called ''Energiewende – Atomausstieg und Klimaschutz'' (Energy Transition: Nuclear Phase-Out and Climate Protection).  The Institute for Applied Ecology was funded by both environmental and religious organizations, and the importance of religious and conservative figures like Wolf von Fabeck and Peter Ahmels was crucial.  In the following decades, the term ''Energiewende'' expanded in scope – in its present form it dates back to at least 2002.

''Energiewende'' designates a significant change in [[energy policy]].  The term encompasses a reorientation of policy from demand to supply and a shift from centralized to distributed generation (for example, producing heat and power in small cogeneration units), which should replace overproduction and avoidable energy consumption with energy-saving measures and increased efficiency.

In a broader sense, this transition also entails a [[democratization]] of energy.&lt;ref name="paulitz"&gt;
{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the traditional energy industry, a few large companies with large centralized power stations dominate the market as an oligopoly and consequently amass a worrisome level of both economic and political power. Renewable energies, in contrast, can, as a rule, be established in a decentralized manner.  Public wind farms and solar parks can involve many citizens directly in energy production.&lt;ref name="dnr-2011"&gt;
{{cite web
 | title = Mit Bürgerengagement zur Energiewende

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Photovoltaic systems can even be set up by individuals.  Municipal utilities can also benefit citizens financially, while the conventional energy industry profits a relatively small number of shareholders.  Also significant, the decentralized structure of renewable energies enables creation of value locally and minimizes capital outflows from a region.  Renewable energy sources therefore play an increasingly important role in municipal energy policy, and local governments often promote them.

== Status ==

The key policy document outlining the ''Energiewende'' was published by the German government in September 2010, some six months before the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima nuclear accident]].&lt;ref name="bmwi-and-bmu-2010"/&gt;  Legislative support was passed in September 2010.  On 6 June 2011, following Fukushima, the government removed the use of nuclear power as a bridging technology as part of their policy.&lt;ref name="bmu-2011"&gt;

After the 2013 federal elections, the new [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]]/[[Christian Social Union in Bavaria|CSU]] and [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] coalition government continued the ''Energiewende'', with only minor modification of its goals in the coalition agreement.  An intermediate target was introduced of a 55–60% share of renewable energy in gross electricity consumption in 2035.&lt;ref name="german-energy-blog-2013"&gt;

These targets go well beyond [[European Union]] legislation and the national policies of other European states.  The policy objectives have been embraced by the German federal government and has resulted in a huge expansion of renewables, particularly wind power. Germany's share of renewables has increased from around 5% in 1999 to 22.9% in 2012, surpassing the OECD average of 18% usage of renewables.&lt;ref name="economist-2012"&gt;

Producers have been guaranteed a fixed [[feed-in tariff]] for 20 years, guaranteeing a fixed income. Energy co-operatives have been created, and efforts were made to decentralize control and profits.  The large energy companies have a disproportionately small share of the renewables market.  However, in some cases poor investment designs have caused bankruptcies and low [[Return on investment|returns]], and unrealistic promises have been shown to be far from reality.&lt;ref name="latsch-etal-2014"&gt;

Nuclear power plants were closed, and the existing nine plants will close earlier than planned, in 2022.

One factor that has inhibited efficient employment of new renewable energy has been the lack of an accompanying investment in power infrastructure to bring the power to market. It is believed 8,300&amp;nbsp;km of power lines must be built or upgraded.&lt;ref name="economist-2012"/&gt;  The different [[States of Germany|German States]] have varying attitudes to the construction of new power lines. Industry has had their rates frozen and so the increased costs of the ''Energiewende'' have been passed on to consumers, who have had rising electricity bills. Germans in 2013 had some of the highest electricity [[price]]s (including taxes) in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;

According to a 2014 survey conducted by TNS Emnid for the German Renewable Energies Agency among 1015 respondents, 94 per cent of the Germans support the enforced expansion of Renewable Energies.

On 1 August 2014, a revised [[German Renewable Energy Sources Act|Renewable Energy Sources Act]] entered into force.  Specific deployment corridors now stipulate the extent to which renewable energy is to be expanded in the future and the funding rates ([[feed-in tariff]]s) will no longer be fixed by the government, but will be determined by auction.&lt;ref name="bmwi-2015-a"/&gt;

Among other things, wind and PV cannot be principally refinanced under the current [[marginal cost]] based market.  Carbon pricing is also central to the ''Energiewende'' and the [[European Union Emissions Trading Scheme]] (EU ETS) needs to be reformed to create a genuine [[scarcity]] of certificates.&lt;ref name="agora-2015-b"&gt;

Most of the computer scenarios used to analyse the ''Energiewende'' rely on a substantial carbon price to drive the transition to low-carbon technologies.

Coal-fired generation needs to be retired as part of the ''Energiewende''.  Some argue for an explicit negotiated phase-out of coal plants, along the lines of the well-publicized nuclear phase-out.&lt;ref name="agora-2016a"&gt;

Coal comprised 42% of electricity generation in 2015.  If Germany is to limit its contribution to a [[Global Warming|global temperature increase]] to 1.5{{nbsp}}°C above pre-industrial levels, as declared in the 2015 [[Paris Agreement]], a complete phase-out of fossil fuels together with a shift to [[100% renewable energy]] is required by about 2040.&lt;ref name="quaschning-2016"&gt;

The areas covered are the energy efficiency of buildings, energy conservation for companies, consumer energy efficiency, and transport energy efficiency.  German industry is expected to make a sizeable contribution.

An official federal government report on progress under the ''Energiewende'', updated for 2014, notes that:&lt;ref name="bmwi-2015-b"/&gt;

* energy consumption fell by 4.7% in 2014 (from 2013) and at {{val|13132}}{{nbsp}}petajoules reached it lowest level since 1990
* renewable generation is the number-one source of electricity
* energy efficiency increased by an average annual 1.6% between 2008 and 2014
* final energy consumption in the transport sector was 1.7% higher in 2014 than in 2005

Analysis by Agora Energiewende in late-2016 suggests that Germany will probably miss several of its key ''Energiewende'' targets, despite recent reforms to the [[German Renewable Energy Sources Act|Renewable Energy Sources Act]] and the wholesale electricity market.  The goal to cut emissions by 40% by 2020 "will most likely be missed{{nbsp}}... if no further measures are taken" and the 55–60% share of renewable energy in gross electricity consumption by 2035 is "unachievable" with the current plans for renewables expansion.&lt;ref name="clew-2016a"&gt;

The plan states that the energy supply must be "almost completely decarbonised" by 2050, with renewables as its main source.  For the electricity sector, "in the long-term, electricity generation must be based almost entirely on renewable energies" and "the share of wind and solar power in total electricity production will rise significantly".  Notwithstanding, during the transition, "less carbon-intensive natural gas power plants and the existing most modern coal power plants play an important role as interim technologies".&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016"&gt;

The fifth monitoring report on the ''Energiewende'' for 2015 was published in December 2016.  The expert commission which wrote the report warns that Germany will probably miss its 2020 climate targets and believes that this could threaten the credibility of the entire endeavor.  The commission puts forward a number of measures to address the slowdown, including a flat national {{CO2}} price imposed across all sectors, a greater focus on transport, and full market exposure for renewable generation.  Regarding the carbon price, the commission thinks that a reformed [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme|EU{{nbsp}}ETS]] would be better, but that achieving agreement across Europe is unlikely.&lt;ref name="egenter-and-wehrmann-2016"&gt;

== Citizen support and participation ==

{{as of|2016}}, citizen support for the ''Energiewende'' remains high, with recent surveys indicating that about 80–90% of the public are in favor.&lt;ref name="amelang-and-wettengel-2016"&gt;{{cite news | first1 = Sören | last1 = Amelang | first2 = Julian | last2 = Wettengel	 | title = Polls reveal citizens' support for Energiewende | date = 4 May 2016 | website = Clean Energy Wire (CLEW) | location = Berlin, Germany | url = https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/polls-reveal-citizens-support-energiewende | access-date = 2016-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Computer studies ==

Much of the policy development for the ''Energiewende'' is underpinned by [[computer simulation|computer models]], run mostly by universities and research institutes.  The models are usually based on [[scenario analysis]] and are used to investigate different assumptions regarding the stability, sustainability, cost, efficiency, and public acceptability of various sets of technologies.  Some models cover the entire [[energy sector]], while others are confined to [[electricity generation]] and consumption.  A 2016 book investigates the usefulness and limitations of energy scenarios and energy models within the context of the ''Energiewende''.&lt;ref name="dieckhoff-and-leuschner-2016"&gt;&lt;!-- publishers url: www.transcript-verlag.de/978-3-8376-3171-5 --&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of computer studies confirm the feasibility of the German electricity system being 100% renewable in 2050.  Some investigate the prospect of the entire energy system (all energy carriers) being fully renewable too.

=== 2009 WWF study ===

In 2009 [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] Germany published a quantitative study prepared by the [[Öko-Institut]], Prognos, and Hans-Joachim Ziesing.&lt;ref name="wwf-germany-2009"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The study presumes a 95% reduction in [[greenhouse gas]]es by the year 2050 and covers all sectors.  The study shows that the transformation from a high-carbon to a low-carbon economy is possible and  affordable.  It notes that by committing to this transformation  path, Germany could become a model for other countries.

=== 2011 German Advisory Council on the Environment study ===

A 2011 report from the [[:de:Sachverständigenrat für Umweltfragen|German Advisory Council on the Environment]] (SRU) concludes that Germany can attain 100% renewable electricity generation by 2050.&lt;ref name="sru-2010"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[German Aerospace Center]] (DLR) REMix high-resolution energy model was used for the analysis.  A range of scenarios were investigated and a cost-competitive transition with good security of supply is possible.

The authors presume that the transmission network will continue to be reinforced and that cooperation with Norway and Sweden would allow their hydro generation to be utilized for storage.  The transition does not require Germany's [[Nuclear power phase-out#Germany|nuclear phase-out]] (''{{lang|de|Atomausstieg}}'') to be extended nor the construction of coal-fired plants with [[carbon capture and storage]] (CCS).  Conventional generation assets need not be stranded and an orderly transition should prevail.  Stringent energy efficiency and energy saving programs can bring down the future costs of electricity.

=== 2015 Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project study ===

The [[Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project]] (DDPP) aims to demonstrate how countries can transform their energy systems by 2050 in order to achieve a [[low-carbon economy]].
The 2015 German country report, produced in association with the [[Wuppertal Institute]], examines the official target of reducing domestic GHG emissions by 80% to 95% by 2050 (compared with 1990).&lt;ref name="hillebrandt-2015"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Decarbonization  pathways  for  Germany  are  illustrated  by  means  of  three  ambitious scenarios with energy-related emission reductions between 1990 and 2050 varying between 80%  and  more  than  90%.  Three strategies strongly contribute to GHG emission reduction: 
* energy efficiency improvements (in all sectors but especially in buildings)
* increased use of domestic renewables (with a focus on electricity generation)
* electrification  and  (in  two  of  the  scenarios  also)  use  of  renewable  electricity-based synthetic fuels (especially in the transport and industry sector)
In addition, some scenarios use controversially:
* final energy demand reductions through behavioral changes ([[mode of transport|modal shift]] in transport, changes in eating and heating habits)
* net imports of electricity from renewable sources or of [[bioenergy]]
* use of [[carbon capture and storage]] (CCS) technology to reduce industry sector GHG emissions (including cement production)
Potential co-benefits for Germany include increased energy security, higher competitiveness of and global business opportunities for companies, job creation, stronger GDP growth, smaller energy bills for households, and less air pollution.

=== 2015 Fraunhofer ISE study ===

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  The guiding question of the study is: how can a cost-optimised transformation of the German energy system — with consideration of all [[energy carrier]]s and consumer sectors — be achieved while meeting the declared [[climate protection]] targets and ensuring a secure energy supply at all times.  [[Carbon capture and storage]] (CCS) is explicitly excluded from the scenarios.  A future energy scenario emitting 85% less CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions than 1990 levels is compared with a reference scenario, which assumes that the German energy system operates in 2050 the same way as it does today.  Under this comparison, primary energy supply drops 42%.  The total cumulative costs depend on the future prices for carbon and oil.  If the penalty for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions increases to €100/tonne by 2030 and thereafter remains constant and fossil fuel prices increase annually by 2%, then the total cumulative costs of today's energy system are 8% higher than the costs required for the minus 85% scenario up to 2050.  The report also notes:

{{quote|From the macroeconomic perspective, the transformation of Germany's energy system demands a significant shift in cash flow, moving the cash spent on energy imports today to spend it instead on new investments in systems, their operation and maintenance.  In this respect a transformed energy system requires a large expenditure for local added value, a factor which also does not appear in the shown cost analysis.&lt;ref name="henning-and-palzer-2015"/&gt;{{rp|8}}}}

=== 2015 DIW study ===

A 2015 study uses DIETER or Dispatch and Investment Evaluation Tool with Endogenous Renewables, developed by the [[German Institute for Economic Research]] (DIW), Berlin, Germany.  The study examines the power storage requirements for renewables uptake ranging from 60% to 100%.  Under the baseline scenario of 80% (the German government target for 2050), [[Grid energy storage|grid storage]] requirements remain moderate and other options on both the supply side and demand side offer flexibility at low cost.  Nonetheless storage plays an important role in the provision of reserves.  Storage becomes more pronounced under higher shares of renewables, but strongly depends on the costs and availability of other flexibility options, particularly on biomass availability.  The model is fully described in the study report.&lt;ref name="zerrahn-and-schill-2015"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Set in 2050, several scenarios use [[gas turbine#industrial gas turbines for power generation|gas power plants]] to stabilise the backbone of energy system, ensuring supply security during several weeks of low wind and solar radiation.  Other scenarios investigate a 100% renewable system and show these to be possible but more costly.  Flexible consumption and storage control ([[energy demand management|demand-side management]]) in households and the industrial sector is the most cost-efficient means of balancing short-term power fluctuations.  Long-term storage systems, based on [[power-to-X]], are only viable if carbon emissions are to be reduced by more than 80%.  On the question of costs, the study notes:

{{quote|Assuming that the price of emissions allowances in 2050 will significantly surpass its current level, a power generation system boasting a high percentage of wind and photovoltaics will, as a rule, come  cheaper  than  a  system  dominated by fossil fuel power plants.&lt;ref name="acatech-2016"/&gt;{{rp|7}}}}

Load shares in 2050 would be: on-shore wind 35%, off-shore wind 17%, wave 0.08%, geothermal 0.01%, hydro-electric 0.87%, tidal 0%, residential PV 6.75%, commercial PV 6.48%, utility PV 33.8%, and [[concentrating solar power]] 0%.  The study also assess avoided air pollution, eliminated global climate change costs, and net job creation.  These co-benefits are substantial.

{{main|Biomass#Environmental damage}}

Using biomass as a fuel produces [[air pollution]] in the form of [[carbon monoxide]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[NOx]] (nitrogen oxides), VOCs ([[volatile organic compound]]s), particulates and other pollutants. However, since the beginning of the Energiewende the balance of biomass vs other forms of renewable energy has shifted; biomass made up 7.0% of Germany's power generation mix in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://energytransition.org/2018/01/german-energy-consumption-2017/|title=Germany’s energy consumption in 2017|date=2018-01-11|work=Energy Transition|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Biomass has the potential to be a [[carbon-neutral]] fuel because growing biomass absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and a portion of the carbon absorbed remains in the ground after harvest.&lt;ref&gt;https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41603.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Biomass contains less sulfur than coal and so produces much less sulfur dioxide than coal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pfpi.net/air-pollution-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://michiganmessenger.com/33868/proposed-biomass-plant-better-than-coal|title=Proposed biomass plant: Better than coal?|author=Eartha Jane Melzer|date=January 26, 2010|work=The Michigan Messenger|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205080916/http://michiganmessenger.com/33868/proposed-biomass-plant-better-than-coal|archivedate=2010-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Unlike traditional engineering disciplines, engineering science/physics is not necessarily confined to a particular branch of science, engineering or physics. Instead, engineering science/physics is meant to provide a more thorough grounding in [[applied physics]] for a selected specialty such as [[optics]], [[quantum physics]], [[materials science]], [[applied mechanics]], [[electronics]], [[nanotechnology]], [[microfabrication]], [[microelectronics]], [[computing]], [[photonics]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[electrical engineering]], [[nuclear engineering]], [[biophysics]], [[control theory]], [[aerodynamics]], [[energy]], [[solid-state physics]], etc. It is the discipline devoted to creating and optimizing engineering solutions through enhanced understanding and integrated application of mathematical, scientific, statistical, and engineering principles. The discipline is also meant for cross-functionality and bridges the gap between theoretical science and practical engineering with emphasis in [[research]] and development, design, and analysis.

It is notable that in many languages the term for "engineering physics" would be directly translated into [[English language|English]] as "technical physics". In some countries, both what would be translated as "engineering physics" and what would be translated as "technical physics" are disciplines leading to academic degrees, with the former specializing in nuclear power research, and the latter closer to engineering physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cas.ac.cn/html/Dir/2001/10/07/0655.htm | title=2002 Applications for graduate study open in Shanghai Research Institute of Technical Physics (上海技术物理研究所2002年招生) | publisher=Chinese Academy of Sciences (中国科学院) | date=2001-10-07 | accessdate=2008-09-16 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080607130833/http://www.cas.ac.cn/html/Dir/2001/10/07/0655.htm &lt;!--Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some institutions, an engineering (or applied) physics major is a discipline or specialization within the scope of engineering science, or applied science.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eas.caltech.edu/ Division of Engineering and Applied Science, California Institute of Technology]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://engsci.utoronto.ca/explore_our_program/majors/engineering_physics.htm Engineering Physics, Division of Engineering Science, University of Toronto]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beam.vt.edu/about/esm.php Engineering Science and Mechanics program at Virginia Tech]&lt;/ref&gt;

In many universities, engineering science programs may be offered at the levels of B.Tech, [[Bachelor of Science|B.Sc.]], [[Master of Science|M.Sc.]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] Usually, a core of basic and advanced courses in [[mathematics]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], and [[biology]] forms the foundation of the [[curriculum]], while typical elective areas may include [[fluid dynamics]], [[quantum physics]], [[economics]], [[plasma physics]], [[Theory of relativity|relativity]], [[solid mechanics]], [[operations research]], [[quantitative finance]], information technology and engineering, [[dynamical systems]], [[bioengineering]], [[environmental engineering]], computational engineering, engineering mathematics and [[statistics]], [[solid state (electronics)|solid-state device]]s, [[materials science]], [[electromagnetism]], [[nanoscience]], [[nanotechnology]], [[energy]], and [[optics]]. While typical undergraduate engineering programs generally focus on the application of established methods to the design and analysis of engineering solutions, undergraduate program in engineering science focuses on the creation and use of more advanced experimental or computational techniques where standard approaches are inadequate (i.e., development of engineering solutions to contemporary problems in the physical and life sciences by applying fundamental principles).

==Careers==

Qualified Engineering [[Physicists]], with a degree in Engineering Physics, can work professionally as Engineers and/or Physicists in the [[high technology]] industries and beyond, becoming domain experts in multiple engineering and scientific fields.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engineering.sfasu.edu/index.aspx?URL=EP Stephen F.

Environmental Modelling &amp; Software publishes contributions, in the form of research articles, reviews and short communications, on recent advances in environmental modelling and/or software. The aim is to improve our capacity to represent, understand, predict or manage the behaviour of environmental systems at all practical scales, and to communicate those improvements to a wide scientific and professional audience.

It seeks presentation of: 
• Generic frameworks, techniques and issues which either integrate a range of disciplines and sectors or apply across a range 
• Model development, model evaluation, process identification and applications in diverse sectors of the environment (as outlined below) provided they reveal insights and contribute to the store of knowledge. Insights can relate to the generality and limitations of the modelling, methods, the model application and/or the systems modelled. Insights should be ones that are generalizable in some way and are likely to be of interest to those studying other systems and, preferably, other system types.
• Development and application of environmental software, information and decision support systems
• Real-world applications of software technologies - particularly state-of-the-art environmental software able to deal with complex requirements, conflicting user perspectives, and/or evolving data structures. Aspects related to software usability, reliability, verification and validation should be backed up with quantitative results as much as possible. Development and maintenance costs, and adoption and penetration of the software in the target user groups should be addressed. Licensing issues and open source access should be clearly specified.
• Issues and methods related to the integrated modeling, assessment and management of environmental systems - including relevant policy and institutional analysis, public participation principles and methods, decision making methods, model integration, quality assurance and evaluation of models, data and procedure. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.journals.elsevier.com/environmental-modelling-and-software

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original goal was to establish a central computer database of DNA sequences, to supplement sequences submitted to journals. What began as a modest task of abstracting information from literature soon became a major database activity with direct electronic submissions of data and the need for highly skilled informatics staff. The task grew in scale with the start of the [[genome project]]s, and grew in visibility as the data became relevant to research in the commercial sector. It soon became apparent that the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Data Library needed better financial security to ensure its long-term viability and to cope with the sheer scale of the task.

There was also a need for research and development to provide services, to collaborate with global partners to support the project, and to provide assistance to industry. To this end, in 1992, the EMBL Council voted to establish the European Bioinformatics Institute and to locate it at the [[Wellcome Trust Genome Campus]] in the United Kingdom where it would be in close proximity to the major sequencing efforts at the [[Wellcome Sanger Institute]]. From 1992 through to 1994, a gradual transition of the activities in Heidelberg took place, until in September 1994 the EMBL-EBI occupied its current location on the Wellcome Trust Genome Campus.

When the EMBL-EBI moved to [[Hinxton]] it hosted two databases, one for nucleotide sequences (the EMBL Data Library, which was renamed EMBL-Bank and eventually became part of the [[European Nucleotide Archive]]) and one for protein sequences (Swiss-Prot–TrEMBL, now known as [[UniProt]]). Since then, the EMBL-EBI has diversified to provide data resources in all the major molecular domains and expanded to include a broad research base. It provides user support and offers advanced training in bioinformatics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

'''''Explanatory Notes Upon the New Testament''''' is a Biblical commentary and translation by English theologian [[John Wesley]]. First published in 1755 the work went through five editions in Wesley's lifetime.&lt;ref name=ScroggsFront&gt;Scroggs p.415&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
In 1753 Wesley became gravely ill, leaving him temporarily unable to travel and preach. As a result of this he set to work on a Biblical commentary and translation. He began writing on 4 January 1754 and continued without preaching until March, by which point he had produced a rough draft of the translation. Wesley's pace was slowed by other activities, and he completed the commentary on 23 September 1755, publishing the same year. Further updates were made in 1759 and 1787. In 1790 the translation was published without an accompanying commentary.&lt;ref name=ScroggsFront/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grider p.66&lt;/ref&gt; He was aided in his work by his brother [[Charles Wesley]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith p.107&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==

===Translation===
Wesley worked from [[Greek New Testament|Greek manuscripts of the New Testament]], particularly those of [[Johann Albrecht Bengel]], keeping his translation closely in line with the [[King James Version]] (KJV). He made around 12,000 minor alterations to the KJV, many of which have been incorporated into modern translations such as the [[Revised Version]]. Wesley attempted to modernise the dated language of the KJV. He also changed many occurrences of the word "shall" to "will", thereby downplaying an emphasis on [[predestination]] within the text and bringing it more in line with [[Methodist]] theology.&lt;ref&gt;Scroggs pp.415–6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commentary===
In his preface, Wesley claimed that his notes were aimed at the "unlearned reader," and were meant to be anti-sectarian in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Smith p.110&lt;/ref&gt; He based his work on four earlier commentaries: ''[[Gnomon Novi Testamenti]]'' by Bengel, ''The Family Expositor'' by [[Philip Doddridge]], ''The Practical Expositor'' by [[John Guyse]] and ''Theological Lectures'' by [[John Heylyn]]. Many parts of the commentary were merely transcriptions or translations of these texts. All four authors were doctrinally [[Calvinist]], while Wesley was [[Arminian]] in his theology. As such Wesley refrained from using these texts when issues of [[predestination]] and [[free will]] were raised.&lt;ref&gt;Scroggs pp.417–8&lt;/ref&gt;

Wesley focused on providing historical context in his commentary, giving explanations of the Jewish court system and the positions of groups such as the [[Sadducees]] and the [[Pharisees]].&lt;ref&gt;Scroggs pp.419&lt;/ref&gt; Wesley's doctrine of [[Christian perfection]] that features heavily in his other writings is notably absent in his notes.&lt;ref&gt;Smith p.109&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3915">[[File:Horatius Cocles.jpg|thumb|[[Horatius Cocles]], engraving by [[Hendrick Goltzius]] – an example of a Figura serpentinata]]
'''Figura serpentinata''' (Italian - [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpentine]] figure) is a style in painting and sculpture, intended to make the figure seem more dynamic, that is typical of [[Mannerism]]. It is similar, but not identical, to [[contrapposto]], and features figures often in a [[spiral]] pose.&lt;ref name="mma"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/hd/dona/hd_dona.htm|title=Donatello (ca. 1386–1466)|accessdate=November 20, 2007|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|year=2007|author=The Metropolitan Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Early examples can be seen in the work of [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Raphael]] and [[Michelangelo]].

Emil Maurer writes of the painter and theorist [[Giovanni Paolo Lomazzo]] (1538–1600): "The recommended ideal form unites, after Lomazzo, three qualities: the pyramid, the "serpentinata" movement and a certain numerical proportion, all three united to form one whole. At the same time, precedence is given to the "moto", that is, to the meandering movement, which should make the pyramid, in exact proportion, into the geometrical form of a cone."

[[File:Laokoon-Gruppe-02.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The Laocoön group]]
Bousquet holds that the "serpentinata" style arose as a result of the discovery of the [[Laocoön and His Sons|Laocoön group]] in 1506, and its deep impact on all artists, but on Michelangelo in particular.  [[John Shearman]] also argues that it was invented by Michelangelo, citing the "Victors" that he produced for [[Pope Julius II]]'s tomb.  Maurer, on the other hand, can only detect this style rarely in Michelangelo's work and cites [[Beccafumi]] instead as its pioneer. Beccafumi's student [[Marco Pino]] connected Beccafumi's style with those of [[Francesco de' Rossi (Il Salviati)|Salviati]], [[Parmigianino]] and perhaps even Michelangelo, and his work as a whole is marked by "serpentinata" motifs. [[Paolo Pino]] himself says in his "Dialogo della Pittura", that his figures' poses are many and varied, and that in all his works to find one single figure, that completely and utterly distorts, is ambivalent and difficult.

As Maurer writes, painters are freer than sculptors and less closely tied-down to nature.  Thus they can play around with their figures, reshaping, overstretching, geometricising, dissolving, caricaturing, colouring, meandering, according to the painting's goal and intended effect.  With the loosening of the norms of the [[Renaissance]] and the development of the "Serpentita" style, that style's structures and rules began to be systematised.  A style of form began by which figures showed physical power, passion, tension and semantic perfection.  Movements were not without motivation, nor even simply done with a will, but with will shown in a pure form.  Also their actions arose not out of power, but powerlessness.

The style exerted an influence even into the 1620s, with [[Bernini]]'s ''[[The Rape of Proserpina (Bernini)|The Rape of Proserpina]]''.

==History==
The charity was formed in 1957 by [[Ivor Bulmer-Thomas]], a writer, former [[Member of Parliament|MP]] and a [[high church]] [[Anglicanism|Anglican]],&lt;ref&gt;Anglesey (2004) '[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/51524 Thomas, Ivor Bulmer (1905–1993)]', ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', [[Oxford University Press]], Retrieved on 7&amp;nbsp;August 2010. {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt; who became its first chairman; its executive committee included prominent politicians and architects.  Initially the charity campaigned and obtained grants for the repair and restoration of churches within its remit.  The 1968 Pastoral Measure established the Redundant Churches Fund (now called the [[Churches Conservation Trust]]), which it was thought would obviate the need for the Friends. However, the [[Church Commissioners]] turned down a number of buildings that the executive committee considered worthy of preservation, including [[Old St Matthew's Church, Lightcliffe]], and [[St Peter's Church, Wickham Bishops]]. The charity therefore decided in 1972 to change its constitution, allowing it to acquire threatened buildings either by [[Freehold (English law)|freehold]] or by [[Leasehold estate|lease]].  The tower of the church at Lightcliffe was the first property to be vested with the charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://friendsoffriendlesschurches.org.uk/about-us/early-history-of-the-friends/ |title=Early History of the Friends |accessdate=12 November 2016 |publisher=Friends of Friendless Churches}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
The charity raises money from a number of sources.  Since 1999, it has been recognised in Wales as the equivalent of the Churches Conservation Trust (which only covers churches in England), and as a consequence receives full funding for taking [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] churches into its care.  Of this, 70% comes from the State via [[Cadw]], and 30% from the [[Church in Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://friendsoffriendlesschurches.org.uk/special-role-in-wales/ |title=The Friends in Wales |accessdate=12 November 2016 |publisher=Friends of Friendless Churches}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In England, grants are sometimes obtained from bodies such as [[English Heritage]], as in the case of [[St Mary's Church, Mundon]],&lt;ref name=mundon&gt;{{Citation |url=http://friendsoffriendlesschurches.org.uk/mundon/ |title=Mundon St Mary |accessdate=12 November 2016 |publisher=Friends of Friendless Churches}}&lt;/ref&gt; but otherwise funds are raised by donations and local money-raising campaigns.  Some of the churches have been supported by the formation of local groups of Friends, such as Caldecote Church Friends,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.caldecotechurchfriends.org.uk/ |title=Caldecote Church Friends |accessdate=25 July 2010 |publisher=Caldecote Church Friends}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Friends of St Andrew's, Wood Walton.&lt;ref name=fww&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.woodwalton.org.uk/ |title=St Andrew's Church, Wood Walton |accessdate=25 July 2010 |publisher=The Friends of St Andrew's, Wood Walton}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Members of the public can make donations, become a member of the charity, or leave a legacy in their wills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://friendsoffriendlesschurches.org.uk/join-us/ |title=Join Us |accessdate=12 November 2016 |publisher=Friends of Friendless Churches}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition the charity administers two trusts,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://friendsoffriendlesschurches.org.uk/about-us/church-trust-funds/ |title=Church Trust Funds |accessdate=12 November 2016 |publisher=Friends of Friendless Churches}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of which, the Cottam Will Trust, was established by [[S. E. Cottam|Rev&amp;nbsp;S.&amp;nbsp;E.&amp;nbsp;Cottam]] for "the advancement of religion of objects of beauty to be placed in ancient [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] churches either in England or Wales".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://friendsoffriendlesschurches.org.uk/funding-for-art/ |title=Funding For Art In Churches |accessdate=12 November 2016 |publisher=Friends of Friendless Churches}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All the churches owned by the charity are [[listed building]]s, and most are former [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] churches, either from the [[Church of England]] or the [[Church in Wales]], although three were private chapels, one, the [[Strict and Particular Baptist Chapel, Waddesdon]], was a [[Nonconformism|Nonconformist]] chapel,&lt;ref name=notes/&gt; and another, [[St Mary of the Angels Church, Brownshill]], was a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] church.&lt;ref name=ffc/&gt; In the financial year ending 31&amp;nbsp;March 2010, the income of the charity was £475,367, and its expenditure was £509,034.&lt;ref name=charity/&gt;  The charity works closely with the [[Ancient Monuments Society]].&lt;ref name=notes/&gt;  {{As of|2016}} its patronage is vacant, following the death of the [[George Paget, 7th Marquess of Anglesey|Marquess of Anglesey]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.friendsoffriendlesschurches.org.uk/CMSMS/index.php?page=executive-committee |title=Officers and Executive Committee |accessdate=16 July 2013 |publisher=Friends of Friendless Churches |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517011452/http://www.friendsoffriendlesschurches.org.uk/CMSMS/index.php?page=executive-committee |archivedate=17 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2013.

==List of vested churches==
The list is split into two sections, one for England and the other for Wales.  This division reflects the former management of the English churches (with one exception) by the Church of England, the Welsh churches by the Church in Wales, and the different funding arrangements in the two countries.

'''Fuzzy architectural spatial analysis (FASA)''' (also '''fuzzy inference system (FIS) based architectural space analysis''' or '''fuzzy spatial analysis''') is a [[spatial analysis]] method of analysing the spatial formation and architectural space intensity within any architectural organization.&lt;ref&gt;Arabacioglu, Burcin Cem (2010). "Using fuzzy inference system for architectural space analysis". Applied Soft Computing 10 (3): 926–937. {{doi|10.1016/j.asoc.2009.10.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuzzy architectural spatial analysis is used in [[architecture]], [[interior design]], [[urban planning]] and similar [[spatial design]] fields.

==Overview==
Fuzzy architectural spatial analysis was developed by [[Burcin Cem Arabacioglu]] (2010) from the architectural theories of [[space syntax]]&lt;ref&gt;Hillier, Bill and Hanson, Julienne (1984), "The Social Logic of Space", Cambridge University Press: Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hillier, Bill (1999), "Space is the Machine: A Configurational Theory of Architecture", Cambridge University Press: Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[visibility graph analysis]],&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Alasdair; Doxa, Maria; O'Sullivan, David and Penn, Alan (2001). "From isovists to visibility graphs: a methodology for the analysis of architectural space". Environment and Planning B 28 (1): 103–121. {{doi|10.1068/b2684}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and is applied with the help of a fuzzy system with a Mamdami inference system based on [[fuzzy logic]] within any architectural space. Fuzzy architectural spatial analysis model analyses the space by considering the perceivable architectural element by their boundary and stress characteristics and intensity properties. The method is capable of taking all [[Sense|sensorial]] factors into account during analyses in conformably with the [[perception]] process of architectural space which is a multi-sensorial act.

'''Girih''' ({{lang-fa|[[wikt:گره#Persian|گره]]}}, "knot") is a decorative [[Islamic geometric patterns|Islamic geometric artform]] used in [[architecture]] and handicraft objects, consisting of angled lines that form an [[Interlace (art)|interlaced]] [[strapwork]] pattern. 

Girih decoration is believed to have been inspired by [[Roman Syria|Syrian Roman]] knotwork patterns from the 2nd century AD. The earliest girih dates from around 1000 AD, and the artform flourished until the 15th century. Girih patterns can be created in a variety of ways, including the traditional [[Compass and straightedge constructions|compass and straightedge]]; the construction of a grid of polygons; and the use of a set of [[girih tiles]] with lines drawn on them: the lines form the pattern. Patterns may be elaborated by the use of two levels of design, as at the 1453 [[Darb-e Imam]] shrine. Square repeating units of known patterns can be copied as [[stencil|templates]], and historic pattern books may have been intended for use in this way.

The 15th century [[Topkapı Scroll]] explicitly shows girih patterns together with the tilings used to create them. A set of tiles consisting of a dart and a kite shape can be used to create aperiodic [[Penrose tiling]]s, though there is no evidence that such a set was used in medieval times. Girih patterns have been used to decorate varied materials including stone screens, as at [[Fatehpur Sikri]]; plasterwork, as at [[mosque]]s and [[madrasa]]s such as Hunat Hatun, [[Kayseri]]; metal, as at [[Mosque-Madrassa of Sultan Hassan|Sultan Hassan mosque, Cairo]]; and in wood, as at the [[Great Mosque of Cordoba]].

==History==
{{further|Islamic geometric patterns}}

===Origins===
[[File:Bosra mosaic.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|2nd century Roman mosaic in [[Bosra]] with curvilinear knot patterns]]

The girih style of ornamentation is thought to have been inspired by 2nd century AD [[Roman Syria|Syrian Roman]] knotwork patterns.&lt;ref name="iranica"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gereh Sazi | work=Encyclopaedia Iranica Online| accessdate=2013-01-01| url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/gereh-sazi }}&lt;/ref&gt; These had curvilinear interlaced strapwork with three-fold rotational symmetry. The [[Umayyad Mosque]] (709–715) in Damascus, Syria has window screens made of interlacing undulating strapwork in the form of six-pointed stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Broug, Eric |title=Islamic Geometric Patterns |publisher=[[Thames and Hudson]] |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-500-28721-7 |page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early examples of [[Islamic geometric patterns]] made of straight strap lines can be seen in the architecture of the surviving gateway of the [[Rabati Malik|Ribat-i Malik]] caravanserai, Uzbekistan, built in 1078.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Broug, Eric |title=Islamic Geometric Patterns |publisher=[[Thames and Hudson]] |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-500-28721-7 |page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Islamic forms===

The earliest form of girih on a book is seen in the frontispiece of a [[Koran]] manuscript from the year 1000, found in [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Materials and Mediums | work=Pattern in Islamic Art  | accessdate=2012-02-08 |  url=http://www.patterninislamicart.com/background-notes/materials-and-mediums/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is illuminated with interlacing octagons and [[thuluth]] calligraphy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The transformation of Islamic art during the Sunni revival | author=Tabbaa, Yasser | year=2002 | publisher=I. B. Tauris | page=84| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ph7EdrzSpGoC&amp;pg=PA84 | isbn=978-1-85043-392-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In woodwork, one of the earliest surviving examples of Islamic geometric art is the 13th-century [[minbar]] (pulpit) of the [[Ibn Tulun Mosque]] in Cairo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jami' Ibn Tulun |url=http://archnet.org/sites/1522/media_contents/6256 |accessdate=25 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Broug, Eric |title=Islamic Geometric Patterns |publisher=[[Thames and Hudson]] |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-500-28721-7 |pages=66–69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Girih patterns can be created in woodwork in two different ways. In one, a wooden grille with polygons and stars is created; the holes can be left as they are, or filled with some material. In the other, called ''gereh-chini''&lt;ref name="iranSociety"&gt;{{cite web| title=Pattern, Cognition and contemplation: Exploring the Geometric Art of Iran | author=Henry, Richard | year=2007 | publisher=Iran Society | url=http://www.iransociety.org/docs/journal_2007.pdf | accessdate=2012-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; small wooden panels of geometric shapes are created individually, and combined to create an elaborate design.&lt;ref name="iranica"/&gt;

The term "girih" was used in Turkish for polygonal strap patterns in architecture as early as the late 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Bir Belgeye Göre Amasya II. Bayezid Külliyesi | author=Dündar, A. | journal= Ankara Üniverstesi İlahiyat Fakültesi Dergisi | volume= 44 | issue=2 | pages= 131–172 | year=2003 | url=http://dergiler.ankara.edu.tr/dergiler/37/727/9212.pdf | language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same period, artisans compiled girih pattern books such as the [[Topkapı Scroll]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Mathematics of Egypt, Mesopotamia, China, India, and Islam | author=Katz, V. J. | page=620 | publisher=Princeton University Press | year=2007 | isbn=978-0-691-11485-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ullzl036UEC&amp;pg=PA620 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While curvilinear precedents of girih were seen in the 10th century, fully developed girih patterns were not seen before the 11th century in Iran. It became a dominant design element in the 11th and 12th centuries, as in the carved [[stucco]] panels with interlaced girih of the [[Kharraqan towers]] (1067) near [[Qazvin Province|Qazvin, Iran]].&lt;ref name="iranica"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Architecture – iv. Central Asian | work=Encyclopaedia Iranica | url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/architecture-iv | accessdate=2012-02-08| date=August 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stylized plant decorations were sometimes co-ordinated with girih.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Urban development and architecture | author=Pugachenkova, G. A.; Dani, A. H. Dani; Yinsheng, Liu | work=History of Civilizations of Central Asia Volume IV: The Age of Achievement: A.D. 750 to the End of the Fifteenth Century – Part Two: The Achievements | isbn=978-92-3-103654-5 | url=http://unesco.culture.free.fr/asia-new/html_eng/chapitre4218/chapitre1.htm| publisher=UNESCO | year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Safavid]] period, the use of girih continued in the [[Seljuk dynasty|Seljuk]] and [[Ilkhanid]] periods. In the 14th century, girih became a minor element in the decorative arts; it was largely replaced by vegetal patterns during the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] era, but continued to be important in decorative arts in Central Asian monuments after that time.&lt;ref name="iranica"/&gt;

===Compass and straight edge===
{{further|Compass and straightedge constructions}}

Girih consists of geometric designs, often of stars and polygons, which can be constructed in a variety of ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Allen, Terry |year=2004| title=Islamic Art and the Argument from Academic Geometry | url=http://sonic.net/~tallen/palmtree/academicgeometry.htm | accessdate=2012-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Girih star and polygon patterns with 5- and 10-fold rotational symmetry are known to have been made as early as the 13th century. Such figures can be drawn by [[Compass and straightedge constructions|compass and straightedge]]. The first girih patterns were made by copying a pattern template on a [[Lattice graph|regular grid]]; the pattern was drawn with [[Compass (drawing tool)|compass]] and [[straightedge]]. Today, artisans using traditional techniques use a pair of [[Caliper#Divider caliper|dividers]] to leave an incision mark on a paper sheet that has been left in the sun to make it brittle. Straight lines are drawn with a pencil and an unmarked straightedge.{{efn|Eric Broug's ''Islamic Geometric Patterns'' illustrates many such patterns, and (in the Appendix) gives detailed instructions for their construction using only compass and straightedge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Broug, Eric |title=Islamic Geometric Patterns |publisher=[[Thames and Hudson]] |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-500-28721-7 |pages=194–243}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref name="iranSociety"/&gt; Girih patterns made this way are based on [[tessellation]]s, tiling the plane with a unit cell and leaving no gaps. Because the tiling makes use of [[Translation (geometry)|translation]] and [[rotation]] operations, the unit cells need to have 2-, 3-, 4- or 6-fold [[rotational symmetry]].&lt;ref name="cromwell"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Cromwell, P.R. | journal=Mathematical Intelligencer| volume=31 | issue=1| pages=36–56  | year=2009 | title=The Search for Quasi-Periodicity in Islamic 5-fold Ornament | url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/760261153n347478/?p=405b9dbf45ea4f4793a097b6e12dcb08pi=7 | doi=10.1007/s00283-008-9018-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Lee, A.

===Polygons in contact===
One of the early Western students of Islamic patterns, [[Ernest Hanbury Hankin]], defined a "geometrical arabesque" as a pattern formed "with the help of construction lines consisting of polygons in contact."&lt;ref name=Hankin&gt;{{cite book |last=Hankin |first=Ernest Hanbury |authorlink=Ernest Hanbury Hankin |title=The Drawing of Geometric Patterns in Saracenic Art. Memoirs of the Archaeological Survey of India No. 15 |date=1925 |publisher=Government of India Central Publication Branch |url=http://www.islamic-art.org/ArticlesOnline/BAViewPDF.asp?ArticleID=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; He observed that many different combinations of polygons can be used as long as the residual spaces between the polygons are reasonably symmetrical. For example, a grid of octagons in contact has squares (of the same side as the octagons) as the residual spaces. Every octagon is the basis for an 8-point star, as seen at [[Tomb of Akbar the Great|Akbar's tomb, Sikandra]] (1605–1613). Hankin considered the "skill of the Arabian artists in discovering suitable combinations of polygons&amp;nbsp;... almost astounding."&lt;ref name=Hankin/&gt;

===Girih tiles===

{{main|Girih tiles}}

By the 15th century, some girih patterns were no longer periodic, and may have been constructed using [[girih tiles]]. This method is based on a set of five tiles with lines drawn on them; when used to tile the plane with no gaps, the lines on the tiles form a girih pattern. It is not yet known when girih tiles were first used for architectural decoration instead of compass and straightedge, but it was probably at the start of the 13th century.&lt;ref name="Lu and Steinhardt"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Peter J.

===Two-level design===
{{triple image|right|Darb-i Imam shrine spandrel.JPG|125|Spandrel-large scale pattern.svg|125|Darbeimam subdivision rule.svg|125|Girih pattern on a [[spandrel]] from the [[Darb-i Imam]] shrine, Isfahan, Iran|Reconstruction of the larger-scale thick line pattern with larger tiles, and a spandrel in yellow|Subdivision rule for the spandrel's pattern|||}}

The girih patterns on the [[Darb-e Imam]] shrine built in 1453 at [[Isfahan]] had a much more complex pattern than any previously seen. The details of the pattern indicate that girih tiles, rather than compass and straightedge, were used for decorating the shrine. The patterns appear [[aperiodic]]; within the area on the wall where they are displayed, they do not form a regularly repeating pattern; and they are drawn at two different scales. A large-scale pattern is discernible when the building is viewed from a distance, and a smaller-scale pattern forming part of the larger one can be seen from closer up.&lt;ref name="Lu and Steinhardt"/&gt;

Although there is evidence that some ancient girih tilings used a [[finite subdivision rule|subdivision rule]] to draw a two-level pattern, there are no known historic examples that can be repeated an infinite level of times. For example, the pattern used in the spandrel of the Darb-i Imam shrine (see figure) consists only of decagons and bowties, while the subdivision rule uses an elongated hexagon tile alongside these two shapes. Therefore, this design lacks self-similarity between the two levels.&lt;ref name="Lu and Steinhardt"/&gt;{{-}}

====Aperiodicity====
A periodic tiling of the plane is the regular repetition of a "unit cell", in the manner of a wallpaper, without any gaps. Such tilings can be seen as a two-dimensional crystal, and because of the [[crystallographic restriction theorem]], the unit cell is restricted to a rotational symmetry of 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold. It is therefore impossible to tile the plane periodically with a figure that has five-fold rotational symmetry, such as a five-pointed star or a decagon. Patterns with infinite perfect quasi-periodic translational order can have crystallographically forbidden rotational symmetries such as pentagonal or decagonal shapes. These [[quasi-crystalline tiling]]s contain shapes with five-fold symmetry that repeat periodically, in between other shapes that do not repeat.&lt;ref name="Lu and Steinhardt"/&gt;

One way to create quasi-periodic patterns is to create a [[Penrose tiling]]. Girih tiles can be subdivided into Penrose tiles called "dart" and "kite", but there is no evidence that this approach was used by medieval artisans.&lt;ref name="Lu and Steinhardt"/&gt; Another way to create quasiperiodic patterns is by subdividing girih tiles repeatedly into smaller tiles using a subdivision rule. In the limit the plane would be divided into girih tiles that repeat with frequencies that are aperiodic. The use of such a subdivision rule would serve as evidence that Islamic artisans of the 15th century were aware that girih tiles can produce complex patterns that never exactly repeat themselves. However, no known patterns made with girih tiles have more than a two-level design. There would have been no practical need for a girih pattern with more than two levels of design, as a third level would be either too large or too small to be perceived. It appears that medieval Islamic artisans were using a tool that had the potential of creating highly complex patterns, but they never realized it. As E. Makovicky argues,&lt;ref name=Makovicky&gt;{{cite web| author=Emil Makovicky| title=Comment on "Decagonal and Quasi-Crystalline Tilings in Medieval Islamic Architecture" |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/318/5855/1383.1.full | accessdate=2012-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|The artisans were satisfied by creating a large fundamental domain without being concerned with the mathematical notion of indefinitely expandable quasiperiodic patterns. However, they understood and used to their advantage some of the local geometric properties of the quasi-crystalline patterns they constructed.&lt;ref name=Makovicky/&gt;}}

====The Topkapı Scroll====

The [[Topkapı Scroll]], from the late 15th century, documents the use of girih tiles to create girih patterns. The drawings in this pattern book show the girih lines superimposed on the tiles used to generate the pattern, making the construction fully evident.&lt;ref name="Lu and Steinhardt"/&gt;

===Templates===
Once a repeating pattern has been constructed, regardless of the method used, the pattern can be recreated by copying a repeating unit of it, like the pattern of a wallpaper, as a paper [[stencil|template]]. The pattern can then simply be pricked through on to the surface to be decorated. The Topkapı Scroll grids may well have been meant for use as such templates.&lt;ref name=Necipoglu/&gt;&lt;!--p47--&gt; The ''Anonymous Compendium'' contains square repeat units for many girih patterns.&lt;ref name=Necipoglu/&gt;&lt;!--p42--&gt; Ibn al-Razzaz al-Jazari's ''Compendium of Science and Useful Practice in the Mechanical Arts'' contains explicit templates for special purposes such as cast bronze doors.&lt;ref name=Necipoglu/&gt;&lt;!--p44--&gt;

[[File:Colorful window, Dowlat Abad Garden - panoramio.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|Colourful window of Dowlad Abad Garden]]
The girih has been widely applied on the architecture. The patterns on the Persian geometric windows meet the need of the Persian architecture, as the ornateness of windows indicated the social and economic status of the owner. A good example is Azad Koliji, a Dowlatabad Garden in Iran. With the girih patterns on its window, the architects manage to demonstrate multiple layers. The first layer is the actual garden which people can see when they open the window. And the second layer is the artificial garden as the girih patterns are on the outside of the window is the carved pattern and a colorful glass is below it which creates an illusion of a beautiful garden. The multi-colour layer create a sense of a mass of flowers. The artificial layer is abstract which forms a clear contradiction with the real layer outside the window and gives the audience enough space of imagination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koliji|first=Hooman|date=2015|title=Built on Light: The 'Crafty' Art of Geometric Patterned Windows|url=http://openurl.ingenta.com/content/xref?genre=article&amp;issn=2045-5895&amp;volume=4&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=75|journal=International Journal of Islamic Architecture|volume=4|pages=75-108|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Girih on domes ===
In addition to the plain platforms like the windows, the girih patterns on the domes are very popular as well. However, due to the curve shape, the domes need special techniques. The most important one is called “Dast-Garden” method. This method refers to the number of star polygons applied to the pattern are depending on the change of the dome curvature. Decreasing the curvature of a dome surface leads to the decreasing of the number of points on a star polygon. Thus, the shape of the girih pattern is heavily relying on the dome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mohammad|first=Kasraei|date=2016|title=Girih for Domes: Analysis of Three Iranian Domes|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00004-015-0282-4|journal=Nexus Network Journal|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Girih on walls ===
The girih patterns are very likely to be all over the walls in some Islamic architectures. The decorating lines connect to each other and form a continuous network across the entire tiling with edges combine together. The girih patterns vary a lot on the surface, with different geometric shapes including decagons, hexagons, bowties and rhombuses. Among all these patterns, a special technique is shared: "self-similar transformation". The mapping is completed by using this freedom to eliminate the edge difference of these patterns and reduce the edge mismatches to the lowest degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lu|first=Peter|date=February 2017|title=Decagonal and Quasi-Crystalline Tilings in Medieval Islamic Architectur|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.1135491|journal=Science|volume=315|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Guild of Romanists''' or '''Confrérie van romanisten''' was a society which was active in [[Antwerp]] from the late 16th to the late 18th century. It was made up of notables and [[artist]]s of Antwerp who had visited [[Rome]] and offered artists access to the networks of Antwerp's urban elites.&lt;ref name=lux&gt;Rengenier C. Rittersma, ''Luxury in the Low Countries: Miscellaneous Reflections on Netherlandish Material Culture, 1500 to the Present'', Asp / Vubpress / Upa, 2010, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Confrérie was established in 1572 in Antwerp's [[Cathedral of Our Lady (Antwerp)|Cathedral of Our Lady]] under the patronage of [[Paul the Apostle|St. Paul]] and [[Saint Peter|St. Peter]] and was therefore also known as the 'Broederschap van de HH. Petrus en Paulus' (Confrérie of St. Peter and Paul).  It was a condition of membership to have visited [[Rome]].  The condition of having visited Rome to enjoy membership appears to have been strictly enforced and art historians accept membership of the Confrérie as evidence of visits to Rome that are (in the case of Fyt etc.) otherwise undocumented.

The membership included [[Canon (priest)|canons]], prosperous merchants, members of the local nobility, aldermen and leading artists.  Total membership was capped at 25 members, which accentuated the exclusive character of the society.&lt;ref name=Tim/&gt;  Deans of the Confrérie were appointed annually. 
[[File:Rubens apostel paulus grt.jpg|thumb|Saint Paul by Rubens]]

After 1680 the Confrérie went into decline.&lt;ref name=Tim/&gt;  The Confrérie moved in 1681 for financial reasons to Antwerp's St George's Church and remained dormant for a few decades.  It was revived in 1716 when the 'true and approved' relics of St. Peter and Paul were delivered to St George's Church by a Roman cardinal.  The Confrérie was finally abolished in 1785 under the rule of the Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II of Austria]].

A Magistrate Book (1576), the "LIBER CONFRATERNITATIS SANCTORUM PETRI ET PAULI EN ROMA' is kept in the State Archives.&lt;ref&gt;Antwerpen, Sint-Joriskerk – De broederschappen actief in de kerk
Centrum - Mechels Plein, 2000 Antwerpen, at the site of topa.be {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
The diversity of the membership offered artists a good opportunity to meet with potential patrons.&lt;ref name=Tim&gt;Bert Timmermans. ''Patronen van patronage in het zeventiende-eeuwse Antwerpen: een elite als actor binnen een kunstwereld'', Amsterdam University Press, Antwerp, 2008, pp. 243-245&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar social mediation role was played by the [[Chamber of rhetoric|chambers of rhetoric]] and in particular the [[Violieren]], which was the chamber of rhetoric of the Antwerp [[Guild of Saint Luke]].   Membership assisted artists further in raising their profile and prestige in society at large as well as among their fellow artists since only renowned artists were invited to join.

The non-artist members relied on membership of the Confrérie to consolidate their social standing since many of the artist members enjoyed an international reputation.&lt;ref name=Tim/&gt;

The social role of the Confrérie was facilitated through the institution of an annual gastronomic dinner (the '(h)eerlyck maeltyt'), with excellent wines and copious servings of food.  The dinner was hosted at different locations.&lt;ref name=Tim/&gt;

The Confrérie further allowed "'art-pilgrims' to keep themselves up to date on news from Rome, whether it be on new painters or paintings, or newly discovered antiquities".&lt;ref&gt;David Jaffé (ed), ''Rubens, A Master in the Making'', The National Gallery Company/Yale, p. 11 London 2005, {{ISBN|1-85709-326-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Installation art''' is an artistic genre of [[three-dimensional]] works that often are [[site-specific art|site-specific]] and designed to transform the perception of a space. Generally, the term is applied to interior spaces, whereas exterior interventions are often called [[public art]], [[land art]] or [[intervention art]]; however, the boundaries between these terms overlap.

==History==
[[File:Art exhibit at ALMA.jpg|thumb|A golf ball of enormous proportions alongside the antennas at an altitude of 5000 meters above sea level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Artistic Apparition at ALMA|url=http://www.eso.org/public/announcements/ann15048/|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Installation art can be either temporary or permanent. Installation artworks have been constructed in exhibition spaces such as museums and galleries, as well as public and private spaces. The genre incorporates a broad range of everyday and natural materials, which are often chosen for their "evocative" qualities, as well as [[new media]] such as [[video]], [[sound]], [[performance]], [[immersive virtual reality]] and the [[internet]]. Many installations are [[Site-Specific Art|site-specific]] in that they are designed to exist only in the space for which they were created, appealing to qualities evident in a three-dimensional immersive medium. Artistic collectives such as the [[AMNH Exhibitions Lab|Exhibition Lab]] at New York's [[American Museum of Natural History]] created environments to showcase the natural world in as realistic a medium as possible. Likewise, [[Walt Disney Imagineering]] employed a similar philosophy when designing the multiple immersive spaces for [[Disneyland]] in 1955. Since its acceptance as a separate discipline, a number of institutions focusing on Installation art were created. These included the [[Mattress Factory]], Pittsburgh, the Museum of Installation in London, and the [[Fairy Doors of Ann Arbor, MI]], among others.

Installation art came to prominence in the 1970s but its roots can be identified in earlier artists such as [[Marcel Duchamp]] and his use of the [[readymade]] and [[Kurt Schwitters]]' ''Merz'' art objects, rather than more traditional [[craft]] based [[sculpture]]. The "intention" of the artist is paramount in much later installation art whose roots lie in the [[conceptual art]] of the 1960s. This again is a departure from traditional sculpture which places its focus on [[Art#Forms, genres, mediums, and styles|form]]. Early non-Western installation art includes events staged by the [[Gutai group]] in Japan starting in 1954, which influenced American installation pioneers like [[Allan Kaprow]].
[[Wolf Vostell]] shows his installation ''6 TV Dé-coll/age'' in 1963&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/television-decollage/ Wolf Vostell, ''6 TV Dé-coll/age'', 1963]&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Smolin Gallery]] in New York.

==Installation==
[[File:Petzel shapes.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Allan McCollum]].''The Shapes Project'', 2005/06]]
''Installation'' as nomenclature for a specific form of art came into use fairly recently; its first use as documented by the Oxford English Dictionary was in 1969. It was coined in this context, in reference to a form of art that had arguably existed since prehistory but was not regarded as a discrete category until the mid-twentieth century. [[Allan Kaprow]] used the term "Environment" in 1958 (Kaprow 6) to describe his transformed indoor spaces; this later joined such terms as "project art" and "temporary art."

Essentially, installation/environmental art takes into account a broader sensory experience, rather than floating framed points of focus on a "neutral" wall or displaying isolated objects (literally) on a pedestal. This may leave [[space]] and [[time]] as its only dimensional constants, implying dissolution of the line between "art" and "life"; Kaprow noted that "if we bypass 'art' and take nature itself as a model or point of departure, we may be able to devise a different kind of art... out of the sensory stuff of ordinary life".

==Gesamtkunstwerk==
The conscious act of artistically addressing all the senses with regard to a total experience made a resounding debut in 1849 when [[Richard Wagner]] conceived of a ''[[Gesamtkunstwerk]]'', or an operatic work for the stage that drew inspiration from ancient [[Greek theater]] in its inclusion of all the major art forms: [[painting]], [[writing]], [[music]], etc. (Britannica). In devising operatic works to commandeer the audience's senses, Wagner left nothing unobserved: [[architecture]], ambience, and even the [[audience]] itself were considered and manipulated in order to achieve a state of total artistic immersion. In the book "Themes in Contemporary Art", it is suggested that "installations in the 1980s and 1990s were increasingly characterized by networks of operations involving the interaction among complex architectural settings, environmental sites and extensive use of everyday objects in ordinary contexts. With the advent of video in 1965, a concurrent strand of installation evolved through the use of new and ever-changing technologies, and what had been simple video installations expanded to include complex interactive, multimedia and virtual reality environments".

==Art and Objecthood==
[[File:Franzoesischer Dom - Festival of Lights 2011.jpg|thumb|''Guardians of Time'', [[Manfred Kielnhofer]], [[Festival of Lights (Berlin)]] French Cathedral, Berlin, Velotaxi 2011]]
In "Art and Objecthood", [[Michael Fried]] derisively labels art that acknowledges the viewer as "theatrical" (Fried 45). There is a strong parallel between installation and theater: both play to a viewer who is expected to be at once immersed in the [[perception|sensory]]/[[narrative]] experience that surrounds him and maintain a degree of self-identity as a viewer. The traditional theater-goer does not forget that he has come in from outside to sit and take in a created experience; a trademark of installation art has been the curious and eager viewer, still aware that he is in an exhibition setting and tentatively exploring the novel universe of the installation.

The artist and critic [[Ilya Kabakov]] mentions this essential phenomenon in the introduction to his lectures "On the "Total" Installation": "[One] is simultaneously both a 'victim' and a viewer, who on the one hand surveys and evaluates the installation, and on the other, follows those associations, recollections which arise in him[;] he is overcome by the intense atmosphere of the total illusion". Here installation art bestows an unprecedented importance on the observer's inclusion in that which he observes. The expectations and social habits that the viewer takes with him into the space of the installation will remain with him as he enters, to be either applied or negated once he has taken in the new environment. What is common to nearly all installation art is a consideration of the experience in toto and the problems it may present, namely the constant conflict between disinterested criticism and sympathetic involvement. [[Television]] and [[video]] offer somewhat immersive experiences, but their unrelenting control over the [[rhythm]] of passing time and the arrangement of images precludes an intimately personal viewing experience. Ultimately, the only things a viewer can be assured of when experiencing the work are his own thoughts and preconceptions and the basic rules of space and time. All else may be molded by the artist's hands.

The central importance of the [[Subjective experience|subjective]] point of view when experiencing installation art, points toward a disregard for traditional [[Platonism|Platonic]] image theory. In effect, the entire installation adopts the character of the [[simulacrum]] or flawed [[statue]]: it neglects any ideal form in favor of optimizing its direct appearance to the observer. Installation art operates fully within the realm of sensory perception, in a sense "installing" the viewer into an artificial system with an appeal to his subjective perception as its ultimate goal.

==Interactive installations==

[[Image:Maurizio bolognini genoa.JPG|210px|thumb|An urban interactive art installation by [[Maurizio Bolognini]] (Genoa, 2005), which everybody can modify by using a cell phone.]]
An [[Interactive Art|interactive installation]] frequently involves the audience acting on the work of art or the piece responding to users' activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Younis|first1=Lauren|title=Hearts and Scissors Exhibit to Open|url=http://bl-ids-website.ads.iu.edu/news/story.aspx?id=66728|accessdate=23 November 2014|date=March 5, 2009|quote="Installation art can facilitate a direct, immediate interaction with the viewer," [Cindy] Hinant said.}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several kinds of interactive installations that artists produce, these include [[Internet art|web]]-based installations (e.g., [[Telegarden]]), [[Art gallery|gallery]]-based installations, [[Digital art|digital]]-based installations, [[Electronics|electronic]]-based installations, [[IPhone art|mobile]]-based installations, etc. Interactive installations appeared mostly at end of the 1980s (''Legible City'' by [[Jeffrey Shaw]], ''La plume'' by [[Edmond Couchot]], Michel Bret...)  and became a genre during the 1990s, when artists became particularly interested in using the participation of the audiences to activate and reveal the meaning of the installation.

==Immersive virtual reality==

With the improvement of [[technology]] over the years, artists are more able to explore outside of the boundaries that were never able to be explored by artists in the past.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Nechvatal]], ''Immersive Ideals / Critical Distances''. [[LAP Lambert Academic Publishing]]. 2009, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Media (arts)|media]] used are more experimental and bold; they are also usually cross media and may involve sensors, which plays on the reaction to the audiences' movement when looking at the installations. By using virtual reality as a medium, [[immersive virtual reality]] art is probably the most deeply interactive form of art.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Nechvatal]], ''Immersive Ideals / Critical Distances''. [[LAP Lambert Academic Publishing]]. 2009, pp. 367-368&lt;/ref&gt; By allowing the spectator to "visit" the representation, the artist creates "situations to live" vs "spectacle to watch".&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurice Benayoun]], ''Maurice Benayoun Open Art'', Nouvelles éditions Scala, 2011, French version, {{ISBN|978-2-35988-046-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology''' ('''CSIR-IGIB''') is a scientific [[research institute]] devoted primarily to biological research. It is a part of [[Council of Scientific and Industrial Research]] (CSIR), India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://csir.res.in Council of Scientific and Industrial Research India Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927141436/http://csir.res.in/ |date=2015-09-27 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The institute was founded in 1977 as the [[Center for Biochemical Technology]] with a primary focus on biochemical research, but has since shifted its research focus to integrative biology.

==Location==
The Institute has two campuses in Delhi. The North Campus is older of the two campuses and is in the campus of [[Delhi University]], on Mall Road opposite to [[Jubilee Hall, Delhi|Jubilee Hall]]. 
The new campus is in South Delhi, on Mathura Road at Sukhdev Vihar. 

== History ==

IGIB was established in 1977 as the [[Center for Biochemical Technology]] (CBT). The Functional Genomics Unit was established in 1998 with the focus shifting from chemical to genomics research. The institute was renamed "Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology" in 2002.

== Achievements ==
In 2009, a team at the institute sequenced the [[genome]] of the wild-type [[zebrafish]], with about 1.7 billion base pairs. This made the fish, which is native to the [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] region, the first [[vertebrate]] to have its whole genome sequenced in India, as previously Indian scientists had only sequenced bacteria and plant genomes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.igib.res.in Zebrafish Genome Webpage] 'Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology' (IGIB)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/Decoding-the-Genome-Mystery/485122 Decoding the Genome Mystery] [[Indian Express]], 5 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, scientists at IGIB performed the first re-sequencing of a human genome in India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/videoie.php?videoId=201 Indian Scientists decode human genome] ''[[Indian Express]]'', 10 December 2009 {{deadlink|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;* {{Cite journal | author=Patowary| title=Systematic analysis and functional annotation of variations in the genome of an Indian individual. | journal=Human Mutation | volume=33| issue=7 | year=2012| pages=1133–40 | doi= 10.1002/humu.22091 | pmid=22461382 | ref=harv|display-authors=etal}} [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/humu.22091/pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://vinodscaria.rnabiology.org/indian-genome Compilation of news articles and Press releases on Indian Genome], 10 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute also collaborated on decoding the first Sri Lankan &lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.igib.res.in/SriLankan/ Sri Lankan genome ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Dissanayake| title=The Sri Lankan Personal Genome Project: an overview. | journal=Sri Lanka Journal of Biomedical Informatics | volume=1| issue=2 | year=2012| pages=4–8 | ref=harv|display-authors=etal}} [http://www.sljol.info/index.php/SLJBMI/article/download/3711/3073]&lt;/ref&gt; genome and Malayasian genome.&lt;ref&gt;[http://promiseuitm.org/component/content/article/34-slideshow/50-the-first-malay-genome.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute is also a member of the Open Personal Genomics Consortium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://openpgx.org/ |title=OpenPGx Consortium |access-date=7 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171218064848/http://www.openpgx.org/ |archive-date=18 December 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genomics of Rare Genetic Diseases==
The institute has initiated a unique programme to use cutting edge genomic technologies to understand Rare [[genetic diseases]] in India and pioneering the application of genomics for [[Precision Medicine]] in clinics. One of the programmes which has been initiated on this front is Genomics for Understanding Rare Disease, India Alliance Network (GUaRDIAN).&lt;ref&gt;[http://guardian.meragenome.com Genomics for Understanding Rare Diseases India Alliance Network (GUaRDIAN)]&lt;/ref&gt; GUaRDIAN is a large-scale collaborative network of clinicians from around India trying to use genomics in clinical practice, with the focussed aim to understand genetic structure of rare genetic diseases in India.

The consortium aims at using cutting edge genomics technology to enable identification of genetic variations in diseases  and enable clinicians arrive at precise diagnosis for rare genetic disease. Apart from working closely with clinicians, the consortium aims to foster education, awareness and the widespread adoption of genomic technology in clinical settings, in addition to creating and disseminating the highest standards of genomic data generation and interpretation in India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://guardian.meragenome.com/exome-sequence-analysis-and-interpretation Exome Sequencing Analysis and Interpretation page on GUaRDIAN]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the few years, it has been able to work closely with clinicians in the network to be able to offer proof of principles for the application of Genomics for Precision Medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Gupta  |title=Whole-exome sequencing solves diagnostic dilemma in a rare case of sporadic acrokeratosis verruciformis. | journal=Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology. | volume=| issue= | year=2015| pages= | ref=harv|display-authors=etal}} [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jdv.12983/abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Gupta  |title=Whole exome sequencing helps in accurate molecular diagnosis in siblings with a rare co-occurrence of paternally inherited 22q12 duplication and autosomal recessive non-syndromic ichthyosis. | journal=F1000 Research. | volume=| issue= | year=2015| pages= | ref=harv|display-authors=etal}} [http://f1000research.com/articles/4-446/v1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Vellarikkal  |title=Exome sequencing reveals a novel mutation, p.L325H, in the KRT5 gene associated with autosomal dominant Epidermolysis Bullosa Simplex Koebner type in a large family from western India. | journal=Human Genome Variation. | volume=1| issue=1 | year=2014| pages=14007  | ref=harv|display-authors=etal}} [http://www.nature.com/articles/hgv20147]&lt;/ref&gt; A comprehensive programme for patient referral is also functional.&lt;ref&gt;[http://guardian.meragenome.com/referral Patient Referral Page Genomics for Understanding Rare Diseases India Alliance Network (GUaRDIAN)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extension Centers (Branches)==
The main IGIB campus is located at Mall Road, New Delhi near Delhi University North Campus. IGIB's alliance with the Biotech/Pharmaceuticals has led to its growth and setting up of two extension centers - one at South Delhi (IGIB Annex at TCGA, Okhla) and the other at Western Delhi at Naraina.

==International Meetings==
IGIB was a co-host of the 13th meeting of the [[Human Genome Organization]] (HUGO) in 2008, held at [[Hyderabad International Convention Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hgm2008.hugo-international.org HGM-2008 website].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''J. Baird Callicott''' (born 1941) is an [[American philosophy|American philosopher]] whose work has been at the forefront of the new field of environmental philosophy and ethics.  He is a University Distinguished Research Professor and a member of the Department of [[Philosophy]] and [[Religious Studies|Religion Studies]] and the Institute of Applied Sciences at the [[University of North Texas]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.phil.unt.edu/people/faculty/bios/vjbc.php Faculty | Philosophy &amp; Religion Studies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101022091248/http://www.phil.unt.edu/people/faculty/bios/vjbc.php |date=2010-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Callicott held the position of Professor of Philosophy and Natural Resources at the [[University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point]] from 1969 to 1995, where he taught the world's first course in [[environmental ethics]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Ouderkirk, Wayne and Jim Hill, eds. (2002) Land, Value, Community: Callicott and Environmental Philosophy.  Albany: State University of New York Press, pp. 344. {{ISBN|0-7914-5229-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1994 to 2000, he served as Vice President then President of the [[International Society for Environmental Ethics]]. Other distinguished positions include visiting professor of philosophy at [[Yale University]]; the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]]; the [[University of Hawai’i]]; and the [[University of Florida]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[http://jbcallicott.weebly.com/my-real-cv.html My real CV - J. Baird Callicott]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aldo Leopold]]'s ''[[A Sand County Almanac]]'' is one of environmental philosophy's seminal texts, and Callicott is widely considered to be the leading contemporary exponent of Leopold's land ethic.&lt;ref&gt;Ouderkirk and Hill (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Callicott's book ''In Defense of the Land Ethic'' (1989) explores the intellectual foundations of Leopold's outlook and seeks to provide it with a more complete philosophical treatment; and a following publication titled ''Beyond the Land Ethic'' (1999) further extends Leopold's environmental philosophy. Callicott's ''Earth’s Insights'' (1994) is also considered an important contribution to the budding field of comparative environmental philosophy; a special edition of       the journal ''Worldviews: Environment, Culture, Religion'' (Vol. 1, Number 2) was devoted to scholarly reviews of the work.&lt;ref&gt;Publisher's website: http://www.brill.nl/product_id9007&lt;/ref&gt; Callicott is co-Editor-in-Chief with [[Robert Frodeman]] of the award-winning, two-volume A-Z ''Encyclopedia of Environmental Ethics and Philosophy'', published by [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan]] in 2009.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; He is also author of numerous journal articles and book chapters in environmental philosophy and has served as editor or co-editor of many books, textbooks, and reference works in the same field.

==Biography==
Callicott was born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] on May 9, 1941, to distinguished regional artist and art instructor Burton H. Callicott (1907–2003), of the Memphis Academy of Arts (now [[Memphis College of Art]]).&lt;ref&gt;Unless otherwise indicated, biographical information taken from Callicott’s personal webpage, available at: http://jbcallicott.weebly.com/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, Callicott graduated from Memphis's then racially segregated [[Messick High School]] and attended Southwestern at Memphis (now [[Rhodes College]]), earning a B. A. in [[philosophy]] with Honors in 1963. He received a [[Woodrow Wilson Fellowship]]  for graduate study at [[Syracuse University]], completing his M. A. in philosophy (1966) and his doctorate in the same field (1972) after earning a Woodrow Wilson Dissertation Fellowship.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; His dissertation, titled ''[[Plato]]’s [[Aesthetics]]: An Introduction to the [[Theory of Forms]]'', drew from the concentration of his undergraduate and graduate work: [[ancient Greek philosophy]].

Callicott began his career as an academic philosopher in 1966 at Memphis State University (now the [[University of Memphis]]). There, as faculty advisor to the Black Students Association, he was active in the Southern [[Civil Rights Movement]] during the time of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]’s last campaigns in the area. In 1969, Callicott joined the philosophy department of Wisconsin State University-Stevens Point (now the [[University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point]]). As “an expatriate Southerner, fresh from the pitched battles of the Civil Rights struggle in Memphis, Tennessee,” Callicott believed that “the environment was under wholesale assault from every direction with no surcease in sight” and that “Civil Rights was a cause already won in the republic of ideas and in the courts (if not on Main Street in Memphis).”&lt;ref&gt;Callicott, J. Baird (1987a). “Preface.” Pages vii-viii in J. Baird Callicott, ed. ''Companion to A Sand County Almanac: Interpretive and Critical Essays''. Madison: [[University of Wisconsin Press]]. {{ISBN|0-299-11230-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He “was a concerned citizen, but [he] was also, more particularly, a challenged philosopher.”&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;(Callicott, 1987a)&lt;/ref&gt; So Callicott asked “how, as a philosopher, [he] could contribute to a rethinking of human nature and a reconstruction of human values to help bring them into line with the relatively new ideas about the nature of the environment emerging from [[ecology]] and the new [[physics]].”&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

For 26 years, Callicott lived and taught in the northern reaches of Wisconsin's sand counties, located on the [[Wisconsin River]], just ninety miles from Aldo Leopold's storied shack and [[John Muir]]'s first homestead on [[Fountain Lake]], the region that stirred the souls of two very influential environmental thinkers. Callicott writes that “the landscape that had helped shape and inspire the nascent evolutionary-ecological thought of the youthful Muir and that of the mature Leopold was the perfect setting for (me) to inaugurate (my) life-long vocation as a founder of academic environmental philosophy.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://jbcallicott.weebly.com/index.html J. Baird Callicott - Home]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, he joined the Department of Philosophy and Religion Studies at the [[University of North Texas]] in [[Denton, Texas|Denton]]. The first graduate program in environmental philosophy had been launched at UNT in 1990 under the aegis of Eugene C. Hargrove, then department chair and founding editor of the journal ''[[Environmental Ethics (journal)|Environmental Ethics]]''. The addition of Callicott's expertise helped cement its standing as the world's leading program in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://phil.unt.edu/about_us/index.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101022091243/http://www.phil.unt.edu/about_us/index.php |archivedate=2010-10-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
===Callicott's environmental ethic===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“I set out, as a philosopher, to work as a peer to the moral philosophers of the past, to create something new under the philosophical sun — under the gaze of [[Apollo]], as it were — ‘a new, an environmental ethic,’ such as [[Richard Routley]] had warranted in 1973.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://jbcallicott.weebly.com/introductory-palinode.html Introductory Palinode - J. Baird Callicott]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In accordance with Leopold's oft-quoted dictum — "A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community.  It is wrong when it tends otherwise"&lt;ref&gt;Leopold, Aldo (1949). A Sand County Almanac and Sketches Here and There. New York: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0195007778}}.&lt;/ref&gt; — Callicott espouses a [[holistic]], non-anthropocentric environmental ethic. What he labels the “extentionist” approach to environmental ethics attempts to extend familiar anthropocentric ethical [[paradigm]]s — legacies of the [[European Enlightenment]] — to other-than-human beings. [[Peter Singer]]’s “[[Animal liberation movement|animal liberation]],” for example, extends [[Jeremy Bentham]]’s [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] ethical paradigm to all sentient animals.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, Peter (1975). Animal Liberation: A New Ethic for Our Treatment of Animals. New York: New York Review. {{ISBN|0-394-40096-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Taylor (philosopher)|Paul Taylor]]’s “biocentrism” extends the [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]ian [[deontology|deontological]] paradigm to all “[[teleological]] centers of life” (i.e. all organisms).&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Paul W. (1986) Respect for Nature: A Theory of Environmental Ethics. Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|0-691-07709-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Extensionist approaches, however, are inveterately individualistic, conferring “moral considerability” on individual organisms. Actual environmental concerns, however, focus on transorganismic entities: endangered species; threatened biotic communities and ecosystems; rivers and lakes; the ocean and atmosphere. Callicott believes that an adequate environmental ethic — an environmental-ethics paradigm that addresses actual environmental concerns — must be holistic.

Callicott traces the conceptual foundations of the Leopold land ethic first back to [[Charles Darwin]]’s analysis of the “moral sense” in the ''[[Descent of Man]]'' and ultimately to [[David Hume]]’s grounding of ethics in the “moral sentiments” espoused in ''[[An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Callicott, J. Baird (1987b). “The Conceptual Foundations of the Land Ethic.” Pages 186-217 in J. Baird Callicott, ed. Companion to A Sand County Almanac: Interpretive and Critical Essays. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press. {{ISBN|0-299-11230-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Hume argues that moral actions and moral judgments are based on such other-oriented sentiments as sympathy, beneficence, loyalty, and patriotism.&lt;ref&gt;Hume, David (1751). An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals. London: A. Millar. {{ISBN|0-915145-45-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin argues that these “moral sentiments” evolved as the ''[[sine qua non]]'' of social (or communal) solidarity, on which depends the survival and reproductive success of the individual members of society (or community).&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, Charles (1871). The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex (1st ed.). London: John Murray. {{ISBN|0-8014-2085-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition of dichotomous thinking in [[Western philosophy]] inclines most philosophers to dismiss Hume's ethics as a kind of irrational [[emotivism]], despite the fact that, Callicott believes, Hume clearly provides a key role for reason in moral action and judgment. The faculty of reason, according to Hume, determines (1) relations of ideas, which are essentially logical relationships; and (2) matters of fact.&lt;ref&gt;Hume, David (1740). Treatise of Human Nature, Bk III, Pt. I. Sec. I. London: John Noon. {{ISBN|0-19-824588-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Among such matters of fact, reason both traces the often complex causal chain of the consequences of various actions and discloses the proper objects of the moral sentiments. Accordingly, Leopold also traces both the causal chain of ecological consequences of such seemingly innocent actions as tilling the soil and grazing cattle and discloses a proper object of those moral sentiments — such as loyalty and patriotism — which are excited by social membership and community identity.&lt;ref&gt;Leopold, Sand County; and Flader, S. L. and J. Baird Callicott, eds. (1999). The River of the Mother of God and Other Essays by Aldo. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press. {{ISBN|0-299-12760-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; That proper object of such sentiments is the “biotic community,” revealed by the relatively new science of ecology.

===Intrinsic value in Nature===
The distinctiveness of environmental ethics turns on the question of non-anthropocentrism, and that question turns on the question of nature's intrinsic value, according to Callicott.&lt;ref&gt;Callicott, J. Baird (1985). “Intrinsic Value, Quantum Theory, and Environmental Ethics.” Environmental Ethics 7: 257-275.&lt;/ref&gt; For if nature's only value is its instrumental value to humans, then environmental ethics is just a species of [[applied ethics]], similar to [[bioethics]] and [[business ethics]], not a completely new domain of ethical theory or [[moral philosophy]]. Callicott offers a [[subjectivism|subjectivist]] theory of nature's intrinsic value:&lt;ref&gt;Callicott, J. Baird (1990). “Rolston on Intrinsic Value: A Deconstruction.” Environmental Ethics 12: 99-124.&lt;/ref&gt; he does not challenge the modern classical distinction between subject and object, but rather insists that all value originates in subjects (human or otherwise) and is conferred by those subjects on various objects.&lt;ref&gt;Callicott, J. Baird (1999). “Intrinsic Value in Nature: A Metaethical Analysis.” Pages 239-261 in Callicott, J. Baird. Beyond the Land Ethic: More Essays in Environmental Philosophy. Albany: State University of New York Press. {{ISBN|0-7914-4084-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In short, Callicott claims, there would be no value without valuers. These objects, however, are valued by subjects in two fundamentally different ways: instrumentally and intrinsically. Tools of various kinds epitomize the kind of objects that subjects value instrumentally; themselves and certain other human beings epitomize the kind of objects that human subjects value intrinsically. Neither kind of valuing is normally done irrationally. A rational person does not typically value a speck of dust instrumentally; nor does a rational person typically value a plastic cup intrinsically. One values various things as tools for various reasons: drills because by their means one can make neat holes; screwdrivers because by their means one can set screws. When a tool is broken or otherwise becomes useless, a rational person ceases to value it instrumentally; and often broken and useless tools are discarded as trash. One also values various things intrinsically for various good reasons.

Philosophers have long provided reasons why human beings should be valued intrinsically (and thus not discarded when broken or useless). Aldo Leopold, according to Callicott, provides reasons why non-human species, biotic communities, and ecosystems should be valued intrinsically (and thus not severely compromised or destroyed). Of wildflowers and songbirds, for example, species with little instrumental value, Leopold writes in ''Sand County''’s “The Land Ethic”: “Yet these creatures are members of the biotic community, and if (as I believe) its stability depends on its integrity, they are entitled to continuance.”&lt;ref&gt;(Leopold, 1949, p. 210).&lt;/ref&gt; And later in “The Land Ethic,” Leopold directly invokes “philosophical value” — that is, what academic environmental philosophers call “intrinsic value”: “It is inconceivable to me that an ethical relationship to land can exist without love, respect, and admiration for land, and a high regard for its value. By value, I of course mean something far broader than mere economic value [instrumental value], I mean value in the philosophical sense [intrinsic value].”&lt;ref&gt;(Leopold, 1949, p. 223).

Boulder, CO: Westview Press. {{ISBN|0-8133-7120-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparative environmental philosophy===
Despite its newness and its departure from familiar ethical paradigms, environmental ethics was, at its inception, using the methods and conceptual resources of the Western philosophical tradition.  While that tradition has been enormously influential in shaping Western culture and institutions — especially in the domains of law, politics, and jurisprudence — the Western ''religious'' tradition has also been enormously influential in shaping Western culture and institutions. At first, the Western religious tradition was vilified in environmental ethics as the root cause of the environmental crisis.&lt;ref&gt;For the locus classicus, see Lynn White Jr., (1967). “The Historical Roots of Our Ecologic Crisis.” Science 155: 1203-1207; For an early example, see Richard Routely, “Is There a Need for a New, an Environmental Ethic” (1973). Pages 205-210 in Bulgarian Organizing Committee, ed., Proceedings of the Fifteenth World Congress of Philosophy, vol. 1. Sophia: Sophia Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Callicott has explored the possibility of a [[Judeo-Christian]] “citizenship” environmental ethic as a more radical alternative to the familiar Judeo-Christian “stewardship” environmental ethic that was developed in response to criticism from environmental historians and philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;Callicott, J. Baird (1991). "Genesis and John Muir."  Pages 106-138 in Carol Robb and Carl Casebolt, ed., Covenant for a New Creation. Maryknoll, NY: Orbis Books. {{ISBN|0-88344-740-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He has also explored the conceptual resources for environmental ethics in [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]] worldviews and worked with comparative philosophers to explore the conceptual resources for environmental ethics in several Asian philosophical and religious traditions of thought, such as [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Confucianism]], and [[Daoism]].&lt;ref&gt;Callicott, J. Baird (1982). “Traditional American Indian and Western European Attitudes Toward Nature: An Overview.” Environmental Ethics 4: 293-318. Callicott, J. Baird and Michael P. Nelson (2004).

Baird (1994) Earth’s Insights: A Multicultural Survey of Ecological Ethics from the Mediterranean Basin to the Australian Outback. Berkeley: University of California Press. {{ISBN|0-520-08559-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophy of conservation and the “received wilderness idea”===
Callicott has worked with [[conservation biology|conservation biologists]] to develop a [[philosophy of conservation]] and conservation values and ethics, based in part on the recent paradigm shift in ecology from what he calls the “balance of nature” to the “flux of nature.”&lt;ref&gt;Callicott, J. Baird (2006). “Conservation Values and Ethics.”  Pages 111-135 in Groom, Martha J., Gary K. Meffe, and C. Ronald Carroll, Principles of Conservation Biology, 3rd. ed. Sunderland, Mass.: Sinauer Associates. {{ISBN|0-87893-518-5}}. Callicott, J. Baird, Larry B. Crowder, and Karen Mumford (1999). “Current Normative Concepts in Conservation.” Conservation Biology 13: 22-35.&lt;/ref&gt; He has been a strong critic of the “received wilderness idea”: the idea that wildernesses are places that are “untrammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain.”&lt;ref&gt;Public Law 88-577 (16 U.S. C. 1131-1136) 88th Congress, S. 4, September 3, 1964: Sec. 2 (c).&lt;/ref&gt; That idea, Callicott claims in ''The Great New Wilderness Debate'' (1998), perpetuates a pre-Darwinian human-nature dualism; in effect, it “erases” from collective memory the indigenous inhabitants of North America and Australia, liberating the current inhabitants of those continents from disturbing thoughts of their own heritage of [[genocide]]. Exported to other regions of the world, such as Africa and India, where indigenous peoples still thrive, the wilderness idea has been used to justify their eviction and dispossession in the name of national parks. Callicott instead proposes that, because wilderness areas serve purposes of biological conservation, they should be reconceived more fittingly as “biodiversity reserves.”&lt;ref&gt;Callicott, J. Baird and Michael P. Nelson (1999). The Great New Wilderness Debate. Athens: University of Georgia Press. {{ISBN|0-8203-1983-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
In response to Callicott's elaboration of the Aldo Leopold land ethic, the land ethic (and, by implication, Callicott's own non-anthropocentric, holistic environmental ethic to the extent that it may differ from Leopold's) has been subject to the charge of “[[ecofascism]],” notably leveled by [[Tom Regan]].&lt;ref&gt;Regan, Tom (1983). The Case for Animal Rights. Berkeley: University of California Press. {{ISBN|0-520-04904-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; If members of overpopulous species, such as deer, ought to be “culled” or “harvested,” in the name of preserving the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community, and if staggeringly overpopulous ''Homo sapiens'' is also but “a plain member and citizen” of the biotic community, then why should culling and harvesting humans be any less obligatory? In “The Conceptual Foundations of the Land Ethic,” Callicott replies that Leopold presented the land ethic as an “accretion” to our evolving complex ''set'' of ethics.&lt;ref&gt;(Callicott, 1987b)&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the land ethic burdens us with additional moral obligations; it does not substitute for or replace our previously evolved moral obligations, among them the duty to respect the rights of our fellow human beings to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.&lt;ref&gt;Callicott, J. Baird (1999). “Holistic Environmental Ethics and the Problem of Ecofascism.” Pages 59-76 in J. Baird Callicott. ''Beyond the Land Ethic: More Essays in Environmental Philosophy''. Albany, N.Y. : State University of New York Press. {{ISBN|0-7914-4084-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This reply led to another criticism: that Callicott provides no “second-order principles” to prioritize duties to fellow humans and those to the biotic community when they conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Shrader-Frechette, K. S. (1996). “Individualism, Holism, and Environmental Ethics.” Ethics and the Environment 1: 55-69.&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Callicott offered two second-order principles as a framework to adjudicate between conflicting first-order duties: 1) “obligations generated by membership in more venerable and intimate communities take precedence over those generated in more recently emerged and impersonal communities”; 2) “stronger interests take precedence over duties generated by weaker interests.”&lt;ref&gt;(Callicott, 1999, p. 73)&lt;/ref&gt; Because our various human community memberships are both more venerable and intimate and because human interests in enjoying rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness are very strong, Callicott argues that our traditional obligations to individual fellow human beings trump our obligations to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community — at least, he believes, when it comes to the prospect of culling members of the overpopulous ''Homo sapiens'' species.

Additionally, Callicott has been criticized for espousing an overbearing and impolitic [[monism]] in environmental ethics.&lt;ref&gt;Weston, Anthony (1992). “Before Environmental Ethics.” Environmental Ethics 14: 321-338.&lt;/ref&gt; He does not reject [[Value pluralism|pluralism]] in environmental ethics outright; he only rejects theoretical pluralism, not interpersonal pluralism or normative pluralism. Callicott claims that philosophers and laypersons should not adopt one theory, say [[utilitarianism]], for one purpose or in one context and another theory, say Kantian [[deontology]], for another purpose or in another context (this would be theoretical pluralism).&lt;ref&gt;Callicott, J. Baird (1990). “The Case Against Moral Pluralism.” Environmental Ethics 12: 99-124.&lt;/ref&gt; Such theories are mutually contradictory, and he believes that one's moral life should be coherent and self-consistent; however, he also believes that each person should be free to adopt the theory that to them is the most intellectually compelling (interpersonal pluralism).&lt;ref&gt;Callicott, J. Baird (1994). “Moral Monism in Environmental Philosophy Defended.” Journal of Philosophical Research 19: 51-60.&lt;/ref&gt; The general theory that Callicott espouses, Humean communitarianism, correlates ethics to community membership. And because each moral agent is subject to as many ethics as his or her community memberships, therefore each person is subject to a plurality of duties and obligations (normative pluralism). In sum, Callicott is a theoretical monist and an interpersonal and normative pluralist.

Callicott's comparative environmental philosophy also involves a tightrope walk between pluralism and monism. In ''Earth’s Insights: A Multicultural Survey of Ecological Ethics from the Mediterranean Basin to the Australian Outback'', he seems to embrace pluralism by exploring the conceptual resources for environmental ethics in a wide variety of religious and indigenous worldviews.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;(Callicott, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; This work has been criticized, however, for privileging the Leopold land ethic as a norm in reference to which such alternative environmental ethics are evaluated.&lt;ref&gt;Eaton, Heather (1997). Earth’s Insights . . . and Inadequacies.” Worldviews 1: 113-121; Lorentzen, Lois Ann (1997).  “What’s Postmodern about Earth’s Insights.” Woldviews 1: 123-129.&lt;/ref&gt; As Andrew Light observes, Callicott does not insist that the Leopold land ethic is based on the uniquely true worldview of [[evolutionary biology]] and [[ecology]].&lt;ref&gt;Light, Andrew (1995). “Around the World with Aldo Leopold (Review of J. Baird Callicott’s ''Earth’s Insights'').” Trumpeter 12 (1): 53-55. For additional critiques of this work and Callicott’s response, see Taylor, B., ed. (1997). "Special theme issue on J. Baird Callicott's ''Earth's Insights''.” Worldviews: Environment, Culture, Religion 1: 93-182.&lt;/ref&gt; He agrees with multicultural pluralists that the evolutionary-ecological worldview is but one story among many stories. But he does argue that the worldview of evolutionary biology and ecology is more tenable than any other, that the evolutionary-ecological epic is a better story than any other grand [[narrative]].&lt;ref&gt;Callicott, J. Baird (1997). “In Defense of Earth’s Insights.” Worldviews 1: 167-182.&lt;/ref&gt;

Callicott's justification for this claim is an analysis based on the following criteria for tenability: self-consistency; comprehensiveness; self-correction; universality; and beauty.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; The first test of a scientific worldview is logical self-consistency and the evolutionary-ecological worldview passes that test. A tenable scientific worldview must comprehend all known facts and so far the evolutionary-ecological worldview does account for all the facts, such as the existence of the fossil remains of extinct species. When the details of that worldview are shown to be inconsistent with themselves or unable to account for all the facts, the theory is revised accordingly; the evolutionary-ecological worldview is thus self-correcting and is therefore, Callicott believes, becoming ever more refined. The evolutionary-ecological worldview has global currency and enjoys international credibility; that is, it has universal appeal. And finally, as to beauty, Darwin himself observed in the final sentence of the ''Origin'' that “There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.”&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, Charles (1860). On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, Or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life. London: John Murray. 2nd edition. p. 490. {{ISBN|1-4353-9386-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most recent criticisms have been leveled at Callicott's works addressing the idea of wilderness, the ''sanctum sanctorum'' of the twentieth-century environmental movement. Some scholars acknowledge the intellectual merits of Callicott's critique of the wilderness idea, but regard it as both a betrayal of one of Aldo Leopold's most cherished causes and as giving aid and comfort to the environmental movement's enemies.&lt;ref&gt;See: Callicott, J. Baird and Michael P. Nelson, eds. (1998). The Great New Wilderness Debate. Athens: University of Georgia Press. {{ISBN|0-8203-1983-X}}; and Nelson, Michael P. and J. Baird Callicott, eds. (2008) The Wilderness Debate Rages On: Continuing the Great New Wilderness Debate. Athens: University of Georgia Press. {{ISBN|0-8203-2740-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Callicott counters that his quarrel is with an idea, not the places trammeled by the idea, the preservation of which places he appears to be as ardently supportive as any other [[environmentalist]]. In “Should Wilderness Areas Become Biodiversity Reserves,” he argues that the pressing conservation needs of the twenty-first century are better served by the biodiversity-reserve idea.&lt;ref&gt;Callicott, J. Baird (1996). “Should Wilderness Areas Become Biodiversity Reserves.” The George Wright Forum 13: 32-38.&lt;/ref&gt; This idea indicates by its very name what the primary goal of wildland preservation is, whereas the wilderness idea is historically associated with outdoor recreation and thus, Callicott claims, confuses the preservation issue and fosters incoherent and contradictory wildlands-use policies.

'''Marbles Reunited: Friends of the British Committee for the Reunification of the Parthenon Marbles''' is a campaign group, governed by charter and funded by donations from members and supporters, which lobbies and raises awareness about the case for the return of the [[Elgin marbles|Parthenon (Elgin) marbles]] to Athens, Greece.

==History==
The organization was set up in 2001 by [[Richard Allan, Baron Allan of Hallam|Richard Allan]], [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Sheffield Hallam (UK Parliament constituency)|Sheffield Hallam]] and Archaeologist. Initially the campaign was called Parthenon 2004. The members of the committee hoped that the [[2004 Olympic Games]] in [[Athens]] would act as a catalyst to renew interest and raise awareness about the reunification of the Parthenon Marbles. In 2005 the organization changed its name to Marbles Reunited to reflect the ongoing aspirations of the campaign, while not being tied to a specific date.

==Organisation==
The current executive committee members are:
* '''Honorary President''' Eddie O’Hara 
* '''Chair''' [[Andrew George (politician)|Andrew George]]  [[Member of Parliament|MP]]
* '''Vice Chair''' Rea Hajifanis
* '''Treasurer''' Matthew Taylor
* '''Secretary''' Angelo Economou

Other members of the organisation include:
* [[David Hill (businessman)|David Hill]],  Australians for the Reunification of the Parthenon Sculptures and Chair of the [[International Association for the Reunification of the Parthenon Sculptures]]
* [[Christopher Miles]], film director
* Geoffrey White, barrister
* [[Andrew Dismore]] Former British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] Politician and [[London Assembly]] member
* Christopher Stockdale
* [[William G. Stewart|William G Stewart]], broadcaster
* Apostolos Polyzoides
* Jean Polyzoides
* Maria Koutsikou,  Campaign Manager for Marbles Reunited

The original members of the Committee were:
* [[Nicky Artemi]], campaign manager
* [[Peter Derow]], ancient historian
* [[David Hill (businessman)|David Hill]], Australians for the Reunification of the Parthenon Sculptures
* [[Clare Makepeace]], Parliamentary researcher
* [[Christopher Miles]], film director
* [[Jerome Monahan]], educationalist and journalist
* [[Edward O'Hara]], [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] member of Parliament for [[Knowsley South (UK Parliament constituency)|Knowsley South]]
* [[William G. Stewart]], broadcaster
* [[Matthew Taylor (architect)|Matthew Taylor]], architect
* [[Geoffrey White (barrister)|Geoffrey White]], barrister
* [[Malcolm Wright]], internet consultant

==Activities==
The members of Marbles Reunited have organised and/or had significant involvement in a large number of events throughout the United Kingdom and abroad.
* In 2009 [[Edward O'Hara]] set out an [[Early day motion|EDM]] (Early Day Motion) to lobby members of Parliament:
:"That this House notes the forthcoming opening of the new Acropolis Museum in Athens in the spring of 2009; congratulates the Greek government on the completion of a    truly world-class new home for the treasures of the Acropolis hill; recognises the unique beauty of the top floor gallery of the museum, built to the same size and orientation as the Parthenon itself and designed specifically for the display of the surviving Parthenon sculptures as an artistic unit and in the best possible location and light with the Parthenon itself in full simultaneous view; regrets the fact that for as long as the surviving Parthenon sculptures are kept separately in the British Museum and in Greece they cannot be viewed in this optimum context; and calls on the Government to encourage and facilitate the opening of discussions between the British Museum and the Greek authorities with the purpose of the reunification of the Parthenon sculptures in Athens with responsibility for their display, curation and study being shared between the British Museum and the new Acropolis Museum in accordance with the best contemporary museum practice."
* In July 2012 Chair  [[Andrew George (politician)|Andrew George MP]] argued in favour of reunification of the [[Parthenon Marbles]] alongside [[Stephen Fry]] at the [[Intelligence Squared]] debate that took place at [[Cadogan Hall]].
* Marbles Reunited is involved in ongoing meetings with the Greek Minister of culture.

==Affiliations==
Marbles Reunited works closely with the [[British Committee for the Reunification of the Parthenon Marbles]], another organisation that supports the return of the [[Parthenon Marbles|Parthenon (Elgin) marbles]] to Athens, Greece. In 2008, Marbles Reunited was accepted as a member of the [[International Association for the Reunification of the Parthenon Sculptures]].

      <comment>/* Meiji student culture nanpa */ This section is ridiculous, thus it should be removed. Claiming that traditionally Japanese men were often "homosexuals" is a historically absurd claim, also the source given for this addition is a mere erotic novel (not at all a historically valid document).</comment>

{{nihongo|'''Nanpa'''|ナンパ}}, also [[romanization of Japanese|transliterated]] as '''nampa''', in [[Culture of Japan|Japanese culture]] is a type of [[flirting]] and [[seduction]] popular among [[Adolescence|teenagers]] and people in their twenties and thirties.

When Japanese women pursue men in a fashion similar to nanpa, it is called {{nihongo|'''gyakunan'''|ギャクナン}}.&lt;ref name="gyakunan"&gt;Botting, Geoff. [http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20010408tc.html#1 "Japanese women on top."] ''[[The Japan Times]]'', April 8, 2001. Reprinted from ''Spa!'', April 4, 2001. Reviewed November 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Nanpa was a new word of the Meiji era with the opposite word [[Kouha]]. It was originally rendered in kanji as [[wikt:軟派|軟派]] (lit. "the soft school"). The meaning of nanpa was continually changing and different from what it means today. Initially, it referred to a political term with the meaning of "parties with soft opinion and proposition" or "people who are unable to claim a strong opinion" (1892), then it referred to "departments or reporters who are responsible for the articles of glossy things like social or literary in newspapers and magazines" (1901), eventually it meant "a faction of the youth who are enjoying pursuit of the opposite sex and fine clothing" (1909).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Nihon Kokugo Daijiten 2nd edition|last = |first = |publisher = Shogakukan|year = 2001|isbn = 4095210109|location = Tokyo|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, it means people interested more in fun and self-indulgence than in "hard" pursuits like politics, academia, or athletics. In contemporary Japanese culture, nanpa most often refers to "girl hunting" and there is a strong negative connotation associated with it.

The word for boyfriend hunting by women, gyakunan, derives from {{nihongo|gyaku|逆||lit. "reverse"}}, and the first part of the word nanpa.&lt;ref name="gyakunan" /&gt;

==Description==
Nanpa is seen most often in young men ranging from their late teens to mid-twenties. Groups of "nanpa boys" will gather around places with busy, predominantly female [[Pedestrian|foot traffic]] (bridges, subway stations, shopping malls, etc.) and approach women in search of a date. The nanpa groups generally wear high fashion with nice suits, expensive shoes, and extravagant hair styles. Because of their style of dress, nanpa boys are occasionally misinterpreted by [[Gaijin|foreigners]] as employees of [[Host and hostess clubs#Host clubs|host clubs]], who also roam such areas speaking with various women.{{citation needed|date = April 2018}}

Because of increasing number of nanpa participants and rising complaints, many Japanese regions are reacting more harshly to participants. For example, many youth hangouts such as arcades are posting "No Nanpa" signs, and police in highly populated Japanese cities have been enforcing these rules. This may be in reaction to a growing fear in young Japanese women of abduction or rape. The [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya]] district is particularly strict on nanpa boys in the wake of the abduction of four girls by a middle aged man in July 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/16/world/tokyo-journal-a-flashy-teenage-trend-capital-and-its-dark-side.html|title=Tokyo Journal; A Flashy Teenage Trend Capital, and Its Dark Side|first=Norimitsu|last=Onishi|date=16 September 2003|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Same-sex nanpa==
Japan also has a [[homosexuality|same-sex]] nanpa culture, especially within the gay entertainment district of [[Shinjuku ni-chome]].

'''Partnership for European Environmental Research (PEER)''' is a network of seven European [[environmental research]] centres, created in 2001.

One of the aims of PEER is to foster innovative [[interdisciplinary research]] and cross-cutting approaches in support of national and EU policy-makers, industry and society. Member institutes employ about 5,000 persons and have a combined annual budget of 340 Million Euro.

Member institutes have for example training and research co-operation. Through the [http://www.peer.eu/projects/peer_flagship_projects/metier/ METIER] courses, PEER centres have trained young researchers.

== Joint projects ==

In recent [[climate change]] projects, PEER studied climate policy integration and compared adaptation strategies in European countries. The final reports of these projects deal with several aspects of implementing [[climate policy]] in Europe. The first report analyses the adaptation strategies of the EU member states, identifying a number of common strengths and weaknesses of the current strategies in the countries studied.&lt;ref&gt;PEER Publications [http://www.peer.eu/publications/europe_adapts_to_climate_change/ Europe Adapts to Climate Change: Comparing National Adaptation Strategies]&lt;/ref&gt; The second report assesses the degree of climate policy integration in six different European countries, at national and local levels, as well as within key policy sectors such as energy and transport. It analyses measures and means to enhance climate policy integration and improve policy coherence.&lt;ref&gt;PEER Publications [http://www.peer.eu/publications/climate_policy_integration_coherence_and_governance/ Climate Policy Integration, Coherence and Governance]&lt;/ref&gt;
The reports show that communication and awareness raising is going to be important to get public support for adaptation measures, and to help stakeholders to adapt. Since adaptation is very different from mitigation, communication should be designed specifically for that purpose, including exchange of experiences on adaptation practices.&lt;ref&gt;COP15 website [http://en.cop15.dk/news/view+news?newsid=1596 "Green frontrunners are behind on adaptation"], 24 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Although the inclusion of climate change mitigation and adaptation in general governmental programmes and strategies has substantially increased in recent years, much more is needed in terms of integrating climate issues into specific policy measures. Annual budgets, environmental impact assessments and spatial planning procedures are three examples of existing measures which we believe have significant potential to be climate policy instruments.&lt;ref&gt;COP15 website [http://en.cop15.dk/news/view+news?newsid=1148 "When climate policy hurts"], 24 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

PEER Research on [[ecosystem services|EcoSystem Services]] (PRESS) initiative addresses the existing knowledge gaps in [[land-use]] information to perform a spatially-explicit,biophysical, monetary and policy assessment of ecosystem services in Europe. Also, it aims to reflect the social and economic values of ecosystem services. The third PEER report&lt;ref&gt;PEER Publications [http://www.peer.eu/publications/a-spatial-assessment-of-ecosystem-services-in-europe-phase-1/ A spatial assessment of ecosystem services in Europe: Methods, case studies and policy analysis - phase 1]&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrates methodologies to map at different spatial scales the role of ecosystems as providers of recreation to citizens and the function of river networks in providing clean water. The report investigates how ecosystem services can be mainstreamed into agriculture, fisheries or forestry policies. It includes an analysis of policy options and shows that the perception of what services are provided by ecosystems varies according to the respondents, the region and the scales of decision-making.
A fourth report&lt;ref&gt;PEER Publications [http://www.peer.eu/publications/a-spatial-assessment-of-ecosystem-services-in-europe-phase-2/ A spatial assessment of ecosystem services in Europe: Methods, case studies and policy analysis - phase 2]&lt;/ref&gt; summarizes the final results of the PRESS projects for policy makers. The full technical version of the same report is also available at the PEER website.

{{Postmodernism}}

'''Postmodern feminism''' is an approach to [[feminist theory]] that incorporates [[Postmodern philosophy|postmodern]] and [[Post-structuralism|post-structuralist theory]], seeing itself as moving beyond the [[modernist]] polarities of [[liberal feminism]] and [[radical feminism]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Appignanesi/C. Garratt, ''Postmodernism for Beginners'' (1995) p. 100-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminism has been seen as having an affinity to postmodern philosophy through a shared interest in [[speech act]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"The emphasis on ''practices'', which is one of the most radical powers of both postmodernism and feminism, throws renewed emphasis on speech acts and on the enacted, performative aspects of languages." E. D. Ermarth, ''Sequel to History'' (1992) p. 172-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins and theory ==

===Butler===
Postmodern feminism's major departure from other branches of feminism is perhaps the argument that [[sex]], or at least [[gender]] is itself [[social construction|constructed]] through [[discourse|language]], a view notably propounded in [[Judith Butler]]'s 1990 book, ''[[Gender Trouble]]''. She draws on and critiques the work of [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Michel Foucault]], and [[Jacques Lacan]], as well as on [[Luce Irigaray]]'s argument that what we conventionally regard as 'feminine' is only a reflection of what is constructed as masculine.&lt;ref&gt;G. Gutting ed., ''The Cambridge Companion to Foucault'' (2002) p. 389&lt;/ref&gt;

Butler criticises the distinction drawn by previous feminisms between (biological) sex and (socially constructed) [[gender]]. She asks why we assume that material things (such as the body) are not subject to processes of social construction themselves. Butler argues that this does not allow for a sufficient criticism of [[essentialism]]: though recognizing that gender is a social construct, feminists assume it is always constructed in the same way. Her argument implies that [[women]]'s subordination has no single cause or single solution; postmodern feminism is thus criticized for offering no clear path to action.  Butler herself rejects the term "postmodernism" as too vague to be meaningful.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Butler, "Contingent Foundations" in Seyla Benhabib et al., ''Feminist Contentions: A Philosophical Exchange'' (New York: Routledge, 1995), pp. 35-58&lt;/ref&gt;

Paula Moya argues that Butler derives this rejection to postmodernism from misreadings of [[Cherríe Moraga]]'s work. "She reads Moraga's statement that 'the danger lies in ranking the oppressions' to mean that we have no way of adjudicating among different kinds of oppressions—that any attempt to casually relate or hierarchize the varieties of oppressions people suffer constitutes an imperializing, colonizing, or totalizing gesture that renders the effort invalid…thus, although Butler at first appears to have understood the critiques of women who have been historically precluded from occupying the position of the 'subject' of feminism, it becomes clear that their voices have been merely instrumental to her" (Moya, 790) Moya contends that because Butler feels that the varieties of oppressions cannot be summarily ranked, that they cannot be ranked at all; and takes a short-cut by throwing out the idea of not only postmodernism, but women in general.&lt;ref&gt;Moya, Paula M.L. ''From Postmodernism, 'Realism,' and the Politics of Identity: [[Cherríe Moraga]] and [[Chicana feminism|Chicana Feminism]]'' in {{cite book | last1 = Gilbert | first1 = Susan M. | last2 = Gubar | first2 = Susan Eds | title=Feminist literary theory and criticism : a Norton reader | year = 2007 | publisher = W.W. Norton | location = New York | isbn=9780393927900 | pages = 787–797 | edition = 1st | authorlink=From Postmodernism, "Realism," and the Politics of Identity: Cherrie Morage and Chicana Feminism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frug===
Although [[postmodernism]] resists characterization, it is possible to identify certain themes or orientations that postmodern feminists share. [[Mary Joe Frug]] suggested that one "principle" of postmodernism is that human experience is located "inescapably within language".  Power is exercised not only through direct coercion, but also through the way in which language shapes and restricts our reality. However, because language is always open to re-interpretation, it can also be used to resist this shaping and restriction, and so is a potentially fruitful site of political struggle.

Frug's second postmodern principle is that sex is not something natural, nor is it something completely determinate and definable. Rather, sex is part of a system of meaning, produced by language. Frug argues that "cultural mechanisms ... encode the female body with meanings", and that these cultural mechanisms then go on explain these meanings "by an appeal to the 'natural' differences between the sexes, differences that the rules themselves help to produce".&lt;ref&gt;Mary Joe Frug, "A Postmodern Feminist Legal Manifesto (An Unfinished Draft)," ''Harvard Law Review'', Vol. 105, No. 5. (Mar., 1992), pp. 1045-1075, at p. 1049.&lt;/ref&gt; Rejecting the idea of a natural basis to sexual difference allows us to see that it is always susceptible to new interpretations. Like other systems of meaning, it is less like a cage, and more like a tool: it constrains but never completely determines what one can do with it.

===French feminism===
[[French feminism]] from the 1970s onwards has forged specific routes in postmodern feminism and in feminist [[psychoanalysis]], through such writers as [[Julia Kristeva]] and [[Hélène Cixous]].

Cixous argued for a new form of writing, writing with the body—a kind of writing rooted not in biology but in linguistic change.&lt;ref&gt;Ermath, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

Irigaray considered that "man would search, with nostalgia and repulsion, in woman for his own repressed and uncultivated natural pole"—something which would "prevent woman from truly being an other for him".&lt;ref&gt;Luce Irigaray, ''Sharing the World'' (2008) p. 33-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Kristeva argued that 'woman' does not exist, but is rather in a state of becoming.&lt;ref&gt;Appignanesi, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Toril Moi]] has stressed that issues of [[Difference (philosophy)|difference]] as well as of femininity are central to the concerns of all the above writers.&lt;ref&gt;J. Childers/G. Hentz eds., ''The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (1995) p. 275&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bornstein===
[[Kate Bornstein]], transgender author and playwright, calls herself a [[postmodernism|postmodern feminist]].

== Critiques ==

Critics like [[Meaghan Morris]] have argued that postmodern feminism runs the risk of undercutting the basis of a politics of action based upon gender difference, through its very anti-essentialism.&lt;ref&gt;K. Schmidt, ''The Theatre of Transformation'' (2005) p. 129-30&lt;/ref&gt;

"One of the most appealing aspects of postmodernism to many feminists has been its focus on difference. The notion that women have been created and defined as 'other' by men has long been argued and explored by feminists, most notably Simone de Beauvoir. She challenged male definitions of woman and called on women to define themselves outside the male female dyad. Women, she urged, must be the subject rather than the object (other) of analysis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parpart|first=Jane|title=Who Is the 'Other'?: A Postmodern Feminist Critique of Women and Development Theory and Practice|journal=Development and Change|date=22 October 2008|volume=24|issue=3|pages=439–464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist Moya Lloyd adds that a postmodernist feminism "does not necessarily represent a post-feminism, but alternatively, can affirm feminist politics in their plural, multivocal, fluid, oft-changing hue"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parpart|first=Jane|title=Who is the 'Other'?: A Postmodern Feminist Critique of Women and Development Theory and Practice|journal=Development and Change|date=22 October 2008|volume=24|issue=3|pages=439–464|doi=10.1111/j.1467-7660.1993.tb00492.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-structuralism is defined in the Penguin Reference, Dictionary of Literary Terms &amp; Literary Theory, as "... a more rigorous working out of the possibilities, implications and shortcomings of structuralism and its basis to Saussurean linguistics itself... . Post-structuralism doubts the adequacy of structuralism and, as far as literature is concerned, tends to reveal that the meaning of any text is, of its nature, unstable. It reveals that signification is, of its nature, unstable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cuddon|first=J.A.|title=The Penguin dictionary of literary terms and literary theory|year=1998|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=9780140513639|pages=689–693|edition=4.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Post-structuralism, pursues further the Saussurean perception that in language there are only differences without positive terms and shows that the signifier and signified are, as it were, not only oppositional, but plural, pulling against each other, and, by so doing, creating numerous deferments of meaning, apparently endless criss-crossing patterns in sequences of meaning. In short, what are called 'disseminations.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cuddon|first=J.A.|title=The Penguin dictionary of literary terms and literary theory|year=1998|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=9780140513639|pages=689–693|edition=4.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gloria Steinem]] has [[Gloria Steinem#Feminist theory|criticized feminist theory]], and especially postmodernist feminist theory, as being overly academic, "I always wanted to put a sign up on the road to Yale saying, 'Beware: Deconstruction Ahead'. Academics are forced to write in language no one can understand so that they get tenure. They have to say 'discourse', not 'talk'. Knowledge that is not accessible is not helpful. It becomes aerialised."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''''Ramkinar Baij''''' is a book by [[R. Siva Kumar]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aaa.org.hk/Collection/Details/48693&lt;/ref&gt; that was brought out on the occasion of a massive retrospective exhibition of [[Ram Kinker Baij]] at the [[National Gallery of Modern Art]].

The exhibition was curated by K.S. Radhakrishnan&lt;ref&gt;http://isikkim.com/2012-02-a-retrospective-of-ramkinkar-baij-inaugurated-in-delhi-09-5/&lt;/ref&gt; and the book was brought out in collaboration with the Delhi Art Gallery. The book presents entire body of Ramkinkar’s sketches, watercolours, etchings, oils and sculptures, together with many invaluable period photographs. This is considered to be the authoritative volume on the “prolific master”.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.telegraphindia.com/1120323/jsp/opinion/story_15278556.jsp#.VJDGSSvF-So&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawing distinction between [[Benode Behari Mukherjee]] and [[Ram Kinker Baij]] Siva Kumar notes, "If his friend and colleague Binodebihari painted the starker side of Santiniketan landscape, and saw himself as a lonely palm tree in the middle of the barren and parched Khoai, Ramkinkar saw himself as the Palash in full bloom: No leaves, bare branches, fully ablaze".&lt;ref&gt;http://muktodhara.org/?p=2169&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 [[R. Siva Kumar]] was awarded by the [[Paschimbanga Bangla Akademi]] for this book.

'''Reconciliation ecology''' is the branch of [[ecology]] which studies ways to encourage [[biodiversity]] in [[Human ecosystem|human-dominated]] [[ecosystem]]s. [[Michael Rosenzweig]] first articulated the concept in his book ''[[Win-Win Ecology]]'',&lt;ref name=winwin&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenzweig|first=Michael|title=Win-win Ecology, How the Earth's species can survive in the midst of human enterprise.|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on the theory that there is not enough area for all of earth’s biodiversity to be saved within designated [[nature preserve]]s. Therefore, humans should increase biodiversity in human-dominated landscapes. By managing for biodiversity in ways that do not decrease human utility of the system, it is a "[[win-win]]" situation for both human use and native biodiversity. The science is based in the ecological foundation of human land-use trends and species-area relationships. It has many benefits beyond protection of biodiversity, and there are numerous examples of it around the globe. Aspects of reconciliation ecology can already be found in management legislation, but there are challenges in both public acceptance and ecological success of reconciliation attempts.

==Theoretical basis==

===Human land use trends===
{{Main|List of environmental issues}}
Traditional conservation is based on "reservation and restoration"; reservation meaning setting pristine lands aside for the sole purpose of maintaining biodiversity, and restoration meaning returning human impacted ecosystems to their natural state. However, reconciliation ecologists argue that there is too great a proportion of land already impacted by humans for these techniques to succeed.

While it is difficult to measure exactly how much land has been transformed by human use, estimates range from 39 to 50%.  This includes [[agricultural]] land, [[pasture]]land, [[urban area|urban]] areas, and heavily harvested [[forest]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vitousek|first=P. M. |author2=H. A. Mooney |author3=J. Lubchenco |author4=J. M. Melillo|title=Human Domination of Earth's Ecosystems|journal=Science|year=1997|volume=277|pages=494–499| doi=10.1126/science.277.5325.494|issue=5325}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 50% of [[arable land]] is already under cultivation.&lt;ref name=Green&gt;{{cite journal|last=Green|first=R. E.|author2=S. J. Cornell |author3=J. P. W. Scharlemann |author4=A. Balmford |title=Farming and the fate of wild nature|journal=Science|year=2005|volume=307|pages=550–557 | doi = 10.1126/science.1106049|issue=5709}}&lt;/ref&gt; Land transformation has increased rapidly over the last fifty years, and is likely to continue to increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Millennium Ecosystem Assessment|title=Ecosystems and Human Well-Being|year=2005|publisher=Island Press|location=Washington, DC, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond direct transformation of land area, humans have impacted the global [[biogeochemical cycle]]s, leading to human caused change in even the most remote areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vitousek|first=P. M.|author2=J. D. Aber |author3=R. W. Howarth |author4=G. E. Likens |author5=P. A. Matson |author6=D. W. Schindler |author7=W. H. Schlesinger |author8=D. G. Tilman |title=Human alterations of the global nitrogen cycle: sources and consequences|journal=Ecological Applications|year=1997|volume=7|pages=737–750|doi=10.1890/1051-0761(1997)007[0737:haotgn]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include addition of nutrients such [[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]], [[acid rain]], [[ocean acidification]], redistribution of water resources, and increased [[carbon dioxide]] in the atmosphere. Humans have also changed species compositions of many landscapes that they do not dominate directly by introducing new species or harvesting native species. This new assemblage of species has been compared to previous mass extinctions and [[speciation]] events caused by formation of [[land bridge]]s and colliding of continents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mooney|first=H. A|author2=E. E. Cleland |title=The evolutionary impact of invasive species|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|year=2001|volume=98|pages=5446–5451|doi=10.1073/pnas.091093398|pmid=11344292|issue=10|pmc=33232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Species-area relationships===
[[File:SAR(Species-area curve).gif|250px|thumb|The species-area relationship for a contiguous habitat]]
The need for reconciliation ecology was derived from patterns of species distribution and diversity. The most relevant of these patterns is the [[species-area curve]] which states that a larger geographic area will contain higher species diversity. This relationship has been supported by so large a body of research that some scholars consider it to be an ecological law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lomolino|first=M. V.|title=Ecology's most general, yet protean pattern: the species-area relationship|journal=Journal of Biogeography|year=2000|volume=27|pages=17–26|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2699.2000.00377.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two main reasons for the relationship between number of species and area, both of which can be used as an argument for conservation of larger areas. The habitat heterogeneity hypothesis claims that a larger geographic area will have a greater variety of habitat types, and therefore more species adapted to each unique habitat type. Setting aside a small area will not encompass enough habitat variety to contain a large variety of species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosenzweig|first=Michael|title=Reconciliation ecology and the future of species diversity|journal=Oryx|year=2003|volume=37|pages=194–206|doi=10.1017/s0030605303000371}}&lt;/ref&gt; The equilibrium hypothesis draws from the theory of [[island biogeography]] as described by [[Robert MacArthur|MacArthur]] and [[E. O. Wilson|Wilson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=MacArthur, R. H. and E. O. Wilson|title=The Theory of Island Biogeography|year=1967|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large areas have large populations, which are less likely to go extinct through stochastic processes. The theory assumes that speciation rates are constant with area, and a lower extinction rate coupled with higher speciation leads to more species.

The species-area relationship has often been applied to conservation, often quantitatively. The simplest and most commonly used formula was first published by [[Frank W. Preston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Preston|first=F. W.|title=Time and Space and the Variation of Species|journal=Ecology|year=1960|volume=41|pages=612–627|doi=10.2307/1931793}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of species present in a given area increases in relationship to that area with the relationship S = cA&lt;sup&gt;z&lt;/sup&gt;  where S is the number of species, A is the area, and c and z are constants which vary with the system under study. This equation has frequently been used for designing reserve size and placement (see [[SLOSS debate]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Desmet|first=P|author2=R. Cowling |title=Using the species-area relationship to set baseline targets for conservation|journal=Ecology and Society|year=2004|volume=9|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common version of the equation used in reserve design is the formula for inter-island diversity, which has a z-value between 0.25-0.55,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenzweig|first=Michael|title=Species diversity in space and time|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press.|location=Cambridge, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning protecting 5% of the available habitat will preserve 40% of the species present. However, inter-provincial species area relationships have z-values closer to 1, meaning protecting 5% of habitat will only protect 5% of species diversity.&lt;ref name=winwin /&gt;

Taken together, proponents of reconciliation ecology see the species-area relationship and human domination of a large percentage of the earth's area as a sign that we will not be able to set aside enough land to protect all of life's biodiversity. There can be negative effects of setting land aside because it means the remaining land is used more intensely.&lt;ref name=Green /&gt; For example, less land is required for crop production when high levels of inorganic [[fertilizer]] is applied, but these chemicals will affect nearby land set aside for natural ecosystems. The direct benefits of land transformation for the growing world population often make it ethically difficult to justify the tradeoff between biodiversity and human use.&lt;ref name=Daily&gt;{{cite book|last=Daily|first=Gretchen|title=Countryside biogeography and the provision of ecosystem services.in Forum on Biodivesity.|year=1997|publisher=National Academy Press|location=National Research Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reconciled ecosystems are ones in which humans dominate, but natural biodiversity is encouraged to persist within the human landscape. Ideally, this creates a more sustainable [[socio-ecological system]] and does not necessitate a trade off between biodiversity and human use.

===Beyond natural history===
[[File:Lanius excubitor 1 (Marek Szczepanek).jpg|250px|thumb|The life history of the [[great grey shrike]] is better understood as a result of focused natural history and reconciliation ecology.]]
How can understanding of species' natural history aid their effective conservation in human-dominated ecosystems?  Humans often conduct activities that allow for the incorporation of other species, whether as a by-product or as a result of a focus on nature.&lt;ref name="Rosenzweig 2005" /&gt;  Traditional [[natural history]] can only inform how best to do this to a certain degree, because landscapes have been changed so dramatically.  However, there is much more to learn through direct study of species' ecology in human-dominated [[ecosystems]], through what is known as focused natural history.  Rosenzweig &lt;ref name="Rosenzweig 2005" /&gt; cites four examples: [[shrikes]] (Laniidae) thrived in altered landscapes when wooden fence post perches allowed them easy access to pouncing on prey, but inhospitable [[steel fence post]]s contributed to their decline.  Replacing steel fence posts with wood fence posts reverses the shrikes' decline and allows humans to determine the reasons for the distribution and abundance of shrikes.  Additionally, the [[cirl bunting]] (''Emberiza cirlus'') thrived on farms when fields alternated between harvests and hay, but declined where farmers began to plant winter grain crops, [[natterjack toads]] (''Bufo calamatus'') declined when reductions in [[sheep]] grazing ceased to alter ponds to their preferred shape and depth, and [[longleaf pine]] (''Pinus palustris'') declined in the Southeastern United States when lack of [[wildfires]] prevented its return after [[timbering]].&lt;ref name="Rosenzweig 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosenzweig | first1 = M.L. | year = 2005 | title = Avoiding mass extinction: basic and applied challenges | url = | journal = The American Midland Naturalist | volume = 153 | issue = | pages = 195–208 | doi=10.1674/0003-0031(2005)153[0195:amebaa]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Noss 2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Noss | first1 = R.F. | last2 = Beier | first2 = P. | last3 = Covington | first3 = W.W. | last4 = Grumbine | first4 = R.E. | last5 = Lindenmayer | first5 = D.B. | last6 = Prather | first6 = J.W. | last7 = Schmiegelow | first7 = F. | last8 = Sisk | first8 = T.D. | last9 = Vosick | first9 = D.J. | year = 2006 | title = Recommendations for integrating restoration ecology and conservation biology in ponderosa pine forests of the southwestern united states | url = | journal = Restoration Ecology | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 4–10 | doi=10.1111/j.1526-100x.2006.00099.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, applying focused natural history in human-dominated landscapes can contribute to conservation efforts.

The emerging concept of [[ecosystem services]] (coined by the [[Millennium Ecosystem Assessment]] in 2005) changed the way ecologists perceived so-called "ordinary species" : as abundant species represent the bulk of biomass and biological processes, even if they don't appear directly threatened their conservation constitutes as a major concern for maintaining these services on which rely both human societies and rarer species.&lt;ref name="Couvet"/&gt; Reconciliation ecology then proposes to take care of such species and to maintain (or restore) ecological processes in human-dominated ecosystems, hence creating ecological corridors and preserving a good functioning of biological cycles.&lt;ref name="Couvet"/&gt;

==Benefits==
Reconciliation ecologists believe increasing biodiversity within human dominated landscapes will help to save global biodiversity. This is sometimes preferable to traditional conservation because it does not impair human use of the landscape and therefore may be more acceptable to stakeholders.&lt;ref name=winwin /&gt; However, not only will it encourage biodiversity in the areas where it takes place, but many scholars cite other benefits of including biodiversity in human landscapes on both global conservation activities and human well-being.

===Habitat connectivity benefits===
Increasing wildlife habitat in human-dominated systems not only increases ''in situ'' biodiversity, it also aids in conservation of surrounding protected areas by increasing connectivity between habitat patches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anand|first=M. O|author2=J. Krishnaswamy |author3=A. Kumar |author4=A.

===Educational benefits===
Placing importance on native ecosystems and biodiversity within human landscapes increases human exposure to natural areas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=J. R|title=Biodiversity conservation and the extinction of experience|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|year=2005|volume=20|pages=430–434|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2005.05.013|issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has been shown to increase appreciation of nature. Studies have shown that students who participate in [[outdoor education]] programs show a greater understanding of their environment, greater willingness to act in order to save the environment, and even a greater enthusiasm for school and learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bogner|first=F. X|title=The influence of short-term outdoor ecology education on long-term variables of environmental perspective|journal=The Journal of Environmental Education|year=1998|volume=29|pages=17–29|doi=10.1080/00958969809599124|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dillon|first=J. |author2=M.

===Psychological benefits===
The results of reconciliation ecology can also improve human well-being. [[E. O. Wilson]] has hypothesized that humans have an innate desire to be close to nature (see [[biophilia hypothesis|Biophilia]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=E O|title=Biophilia|year=1984|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; and numerous studies have linked natural settings to decreased stress and faster recovery during hospital stays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ulrich|first=R. S.|author2=R. F. Simons |author3=B. D. Losito |author4=E. Fiorito |author5=M. A. Miles |author6=M. Zelson |title=Stress recovery during exposures to natural and urban environments|journal=Journal of Environmental Psychology|year=1991|volume=11|pages=201–230|doi=10.1016/S0272-4944(05)80184-7|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Many examples of native plants and animals taking advantage of human dominated landscapes have been unintentional, but may be enhanced as part of reconciliation ecology. Others are intentional redesigns of human landscapes to better accommodate native biodiversity. These have been going on for many hundreds of years including examples within agricultural systems, urban and suburban systems, marine systems, and even industrial areas.

===Historical examples===
While Rosenzweig formalized the concept, humans have been encouraging biodiversity within human landscapes for millennia. In the Trebon Biosphere Reserve of the [[Czech Republic]], a system of human-engineered [[aquaculture]] ponds built in the 1500s not only provides a profitable harvest of fish, but also provides habitat for a hugely diverse wetland ecosystem. Many cities in Europe take pride in their local population of [[storks]], which nest on roofs or in church towers that replace the trees they would naturally nest in.&lt;ref name=winwin /&gt; There are records of humans maintaining plants in pleasure gardens as early as ancient [[Mesopotamia]], with an especially strong tradition of incorporating gardens into the architecture of human landscapes in [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chen|first=X.|author2=J. Wu |title=Sustainable landscape architecture: implications of the Chinese philosophy of "unity of man with nature" and beyond|journal=Landscape Ecology|year=2009|volume=24|pages=1015–1026|doi=10.1007/s10980-009-9350-z|issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agricultural systems===
[[File:Faidherbia albida.JPG|250px|thumb|[[Agroforestry]] in [[Burkina Faso]] allows [[sorghum]] crop to be grown under native tree species, preserving biodiversity.]]
[[Agroforestry]] provides many examples of reconciliation ecology at work. In tropical agroforestry systems, crops such as [[coffee]] or fruit trees are cultivated under a canopy of shade trees, providing habitat for tropical forest species outside of protected areas.&lt;ref name=bhagwat&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bhagwat|first=S. A. |author2=K. J. Willis |author3=H. J. B. Birks |author4=R. J. Whittaker|title=Agroforestry: a refuge for tropical biodiversity?|journal=Trends in Ecology and Evolution|year=2008|volume=23|pages=261–268|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2008.01.005|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[shade-grown coffee]] plantations typically have lower tree diversity than unmanaged forests, however they have much higher tree species diversity and richness than other agricultural methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Correia|first=M|author2=M. Diabate |author3=P. Beavogui |author4=K. Guilavogui |author5=N. Lamanda |author6=H. d. Foresta |title=Conserving forest tree diversity in Guinee Forestiere (Guinea, West Africa): the role of coffee-based agroforests|journal=Biodiversity Conservation|year=2010|volume=19|pages=1725–1747|doi=10.1007/s10531-010-9800-6|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agriculture that mimics nature, encourages natural forest species along with the crops, and also takes pressure off nearby uncultivated forest areas where people are allowed to collect forest products.&lt;ref name=bhagwat /&gt;  The understory can also be managed with reconciliation ecology: allowing weeds to grow among crops (minimizing labor and preventing the invasion of noxious weed species) and leaving [[fallow]]lands alongside farmed areas can enhance [[understory]] plant richness with associated benefits for native insects and birds compared to other agricultural practices.&lt;ref name="Bobo 2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bobo | first1 = K.S. | last2 = Waltert | first2 = M. | last3 = Sainge | first3 = N.M. | last4 = Njokagbor | first4 = J. | last5 = Fermon | first5 = H. | last6 = Muhlenberg | first6 = M. | year = 2006 | title = From forest to farmland: species richness patterns of trees and understorey plants along a gradient of forest conversion in Southwestern Cameroon | url = | journal = Biodiversity and Conservation | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 4097–4117 | doi=10.1007/s10531-005-3368-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[oil palm]] (''Elaeis guineensis'') provides another example of the potential of reconciliation ecology.  It is one of the most important and rapidly expanding tropical crops,&lt;ref name="Koh 2008a" /&gt; so lucrative because it is used in many products throughout the world. Unfortunately, oil-palm agriculture is one of the main drivers of forest conversion in Southeast Asia and is devastating for native [[biodiversity]], perhaps even more so than logging.&lt;ref name="Wilcove 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilcove | first1 = D.S. | last2 = Koh | first2 = L.P. | year = 2010 | title = Addressing the threats to biodiversity from oil-palm agriculture | url = | journal = Conservation of Biodiversity | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 999–1007 | doi=10.1007/s10531-009-9760-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, attempts are being made to foster the sustainability of this industry.  As a [[monoculture]], oil palm is subject to potentially devastating attacks from insect pests.&lt;ref name="Koh 2008a"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Koh | first1 = L.P. | year = 2008 | title = Can oil palm plantations be made more hospitable for forest butterflies and birds? | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Ecology | volume = 45 | issue = | pages = 1002–1009 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2664.2008.01491.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Koh 2008b"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Koh | first1 = L.P. | year = 2008 | title = Birds defend oil palms from herbivorous insects | url = | journal = Ecological Applications | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 821–825 | doi=10.1890/07-1650.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many companies are attempting an [[integrated pest management]] approach which encourages the planting of species that support [[Predation|predators]] and [[parasitoids]] of these insect pests, as well as an active native bird community.&lt;ref name="Koh 2008b" /&gt; Experiments have shown that a functioning bird community, especially at higher densities, can serve to reduce insect herbivory on oil palms, promoting increased crop yields and profits.&lt;ref name="Koh 2008b" /&gt;  Thus, oil palm plantation managers can participate in reconciliation ecology by promoting local vegetation that is beneficial to [[insectivorous]] birds, including maintaining ground plants that serve as nesting sites, thereby protecting natural communities.  Additionally, steps such as maintaining [[riparian buffer zones]] or natural forest patches can help to slow the [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]] within oil palm plantation landscapes.&lt;ref name="Wilcove 2010" /&gt;  By engaging in these environmentally friendly practices, fewer chemicals and less effort are required to maintain both plantation productivity and [[ecosystem services]].&lt;ref name="Koh 2008a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Koh 2008b" /&gt;

There are many grazing practices that also encourage native biodiversity. In Rosenzweig’s book he uses the example of a rancher in [[Arizona]] who intentionally deepened his cattle ponds in order to save a population of threatened [[leopard frog]]s (''Rana chiricahuensis''), with no detriment to the use of those tanks for cattle,&lt;ref name=winwin /&gt; and a similar situation has occurred with the vulnerable [[California tiger salamander]] (''Ambystoma californiense'') in the Central Valley of California. Research has shown that without cattle grazing, many of the remaining [[vernal pool]]s would dry too early for the salamanders to complete their life cycle under global climate change predictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pyke|first=C. R.|author2=J. Marty |title=Cattle Grazing Mediates Climate Change Impacts on Ephemeral Wetlands|journal=Conservation Biology|year=2005|volume=19|issue=5|pages=1619–1625|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2005.00233.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Central America, a large percentage of pastureland is fenced using live trees which are not only low maintenance for the farmer, but also provide habitat for birds, bats, and invertebrates which cannot persist in open pastureland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harvey|first=C. A. |author2=C. Villanueva |author3=J. Villacís |author4=M. Chacón |author5=D. Muñoz |author6=M. López |author7=M. Ibrahim |author8=R. Gómez |author9=R. Taylor |author10=J. Martinez |author11=A.

===Urban systems===
[[File:MEC's green roof among others.jpg|250px|thumb|Green roofs can help maintain species diversity in urban landscapes.]]
[[Urban ecology]] can be included under the umbrella of reconciliation ecology and it tackles biodiversity in cities, the most extreme of human-dominated landscapes. Cities occupy less than 3% of global surface area, but are responsible for a majority of carbon emissions, residential water use, and wood use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=L. R.|title=Eco-Economy: building an economy for the Earth|year=2001|publisher=Norton|location=New York, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cities also have unique climatic conditions such as the [[urban heat island]] effect, which can greatly affect biodiversity.&lt;ref name=Grimm&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grimm|first=N. B.|author2=S. H. Faeth |author3=N. E. Golubiewski |author4=C. L. Redman |author5=J. Wu |author6=X. Bai |author7=J. M. Briggs |title=Global Change and the Ecology of Cities|journal=Science|year=2008|volume=319|pages=756–760 | doi = 10.1126/science.1150195|issue=5864|pmid=18258902 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a growing trend among city managers to take biodiversity into account when planning city development, especially in rapidly growing cities. Cities often have surprisingly high plant biodiversity due to their normally high degree of habitat heterogeneity and high numbers of gardens and green spaces cultivated to include a large variety of species.&lt;ref name=Grimm /&gt; However, these species are often not native, and a large part of the total urban biodiversity is usually made up of exotic species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=G |author2=G. Jiang |author3=Y. Zhou |author4=Q. Liu |author5=Y. Ji |author6=S. Wang |author7=S. Chen |author8=H.

Because cities are so highly impacted by human activities, restoration to the pristine state is not possible, however there are modifications that can be made to increase habitat without negatively impacting human needs. In urban rivers, addition of large woods and floating islands to provide habitat, modifications to walls and other structures to mimic natural banks, and buffer areas to reduce pollutants can all increase biodiversity without reducing the [[flood control]] and water supply services.&lt;ref name=Francis&gt;{{cite journal|last=Francis|first=R. A.|title=Perspectives on the potential for reconciliation ecology in urban riverscapes|journal=CAB Reviews: Perspectives in Agriculture, Veterinary Science, Nutrition and Natural Resources|year=2009|volume=4|pages=1–20|doi=10.1079/pavsnnr20094073}}&lt;/ref&gt; Urban green spaces can be re-designed to encourage natural ecosystems rather than manicured [[lawn]]s, as is seen in the [[National Wildlife Federation]]’s Backyard Wildlife Habitat program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tufts, C. and P. Loewer|title=Gardening for wildlife|year=1995|publisher=Rodale Press|location=Emmaus, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peregrine falcon]]s (''Falco peregrinus''), which were once endangered by [[pesticide]] use, are frequently seen nesting in tall urban buildings throughout North America, feeding chiefly on the introduced [[rock dove]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cade|first=T|author2=D. Bird |title=Peregrine falcons, Falco peregrinus, nesting in an urban environment: a review|journal=Canadian Field-Naturalist|year=1990|volume=104|pages=209–218}}&lt;/ref&gt; The steep walls of buildings mimic the cliffs peregrines naturally nest in and the rock doves replace the native prey species that were driven out of urban areas.

===Industrial systems===
{{further|industrial ecology}}
In Florida, the [[Florida manatee]] (''Trichechus manatus latirostris'') uses warm water discharged from power plants as a refuge when the temperature of the [[Gulf of Mexico]] drops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Laist|first=D. W.|author2=J. E. Reynolds |title=Florida manatees, warm-water refuges, and an uncertain future|journal=Coastal Management|year=2005|volume=33|pages=279–295|doi=10.1080/08920750590952018|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; These warm areas replace the warm springs that manatees once naturally used in the winter. These springs have been drained or cut off from open water by human uses. [[American crocodile]]s (''Crocodylus acutus'') have a similar habitat in the cooling canals of the [[Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Station|Turkey Point]] power plant, where an estimated 10% of the total North American population of the species lives.&lt;ref name=winwin /&gt;

[[Wastewater treatment]] systems have shown potential for reconciliation ecology on numerous occasions. Man-made wetlands designed to remove nitrogen before runoff from agriculture enters the [[Everglades]] in Florida are used as breeding sites for a number of birds, including the endangered [[wood stork]] (''Mycteria americana'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frederick|first=P. C|author2=S. M. McGhee. |title=Wading bird use of wastewater treament wetlands in central Florida, USA|journal=Colonial Waterbirds|year=1994|volume=17|pages=50–59|doi=10.2307/1521381}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stormwater treatment ponds can provide important breeding habitat for amphibians, especially where natural wetlands have been drained by human development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brand|first=A.

===Ocean systems===
[[Coral reefs]] have been intensively impacted by human use, including [[overfishing]] and mining of the reef itself. One reconciliation approach to this problem is building [[artificial reef]]s that not only provide valuable habitat for aquatic species, but also protect nearby islands from storms when the natural structure has been mined away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clark|first=S|author2=A. J. Edwards |title=An evaluation of artificial reef structures as tools for marine habitat rehabilitation in the Maldives|journal=Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems|year=1998|volume=9|pages=5–21|doi=10.1002/(sici)1099-0755(199901/02)9:1&lt;5::aid-aqc330&gt;3.0.co;2-u}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even structures as simple as scrap metal and automobiles can be used as habitat, providing added benefits of freeing space in landfills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brock|first=R. E|author2=J. E. Norris |title=An analysis of four artificial reef designs in tropical waters|journal=Bulletin of Marine Science|year=1989|volume=44|pages=934–941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation==
Governmental intervention can aid in encouraging private landowners to create habitat or otherwise increase biodiversity on their land. The United States' [[Endangered Species Act]] requires landowners to halt any activities negatively affecting endangered species on their land, which is a disincentive for them to encourage endangered species to settle on their land in the first place.&lt;ref name=winwin /&gt; To help mediate this problem, the [[US Fish and Wildlife Service]] has instituted safe harbor agreements whereby the landowner engages in restoration on their land to encourage endangered species, and the government agrees not to place further regulation on their activities should they want to reverse the restoration at a later date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilcove|first=D. S|author2=J. Lee |title=Using economic and regulatory incentives to restore endangered species: lessons learned from three new programs|journal=Conservation Biology|year=2004|issue=3|pages=639–645|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2004.00250.x|volume=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice has already led to an increase in [[aplomado falcon]]s (''Falco femoralis'') in [[Texas]] and [[red-cockaded woodpecker]]s (''Picoides borealis'') in the Southeastern US.

Another example is the [[US Department of Agriculture]]’s [[Conservation Reserve Program]] (CRP). The CRP was originally put in place to protect soil from erosion, but also has major implications for conservation of biodiversity.  In the program, landowners take their land out of agricultural production and plant trees, shrubs, and other permanent, [[erosion control]]ling vegetation. Unintended, but ecologically significant consequences of this were the reduction of runoff, improved water quality, creation of wildlife habitat, and possible [[carbon sequestration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dunn|first=C. P|author2=F. Stearns |author3=G. R. Guntenspergen |author4=D. M. Sharpe |title=Ecological benefits of the Conservation Reserve Program|journal=Conservation Biology|year=1993|volume=7|pages=132–139|doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.1993.07010132.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==
While reconciliation ecology attempts to modify the human world to encourage biodiversity without negatively impacting human use, there are still difficulties in getting broad acceptance of the idea. For example, addition of large woods to urban river systems, which provides critical habitat structure for native fish and invertebrates may be seen as "untidy" and a sign of poor management by residents.&lt;ref name=Francis /&gt; Similarly, many suburban areas do not allow long, unkempt lawns that provide useful wildlife habitat because of perceived damage to property values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robbins|first=P|author2=A. Polderman |author3=T. Birkenholtz |title=Lawns and Toxins: An Ecology of the City|journal=Cities|year=2001|volume=18|pages=369–380|doi=10.1016/S0264-2751(01)00029-4|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many humans have negative feelings toward certain species, especially [[predator]]s such as wolves, which are often based more on perceived risk than actual risk of loss or injury resulting from the animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berger|first=K. M|title=Carnivore-Livestock Conflicts: Effects of Subsidized Predator Control and Economic Correlates on the Sheep Industry|journal=Conservation Biology|year=2006|volume=20|pages=751–761|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00336.x|pmid=16909568|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Even with cooperation of the human element of the equation, reconciliation ecology can not help every species. Some animals, such as several species of [[waterfowl]], show strong avoidance behaviors toward humans and any form of human disturbance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gill|first=J. A|author2=K. Norris |author3=W. J.

[[File:Punch.jpg|thumb|1867 edition of ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', a ground-breaking [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] magazine of popular humour, including a great deal of satire of the contemporary, social, and political scene.]] {{Literature}}{{Performing arts}}
'''Satire''' is a [[genre]] of [[literature]], and sometimes [[graphic arts|graphic]] and [[performing art]]s, in which vices, follies, abuses, and shortcomings are held up to ridicule, ideally with the intent of shaming individuals, corporations, government, or society itself into improvement.{{Sfn | Elliott | 2004}} Although satire is usually meant to be humorous, its greater purpose is often constructive [[social criticism]], using [[wit]] to draw attention to both particular and wider issues in society.

A feature of satire is strong [[irony]] or [[sarcasm]]—"in satire, irony is militant"{{Refn | {{Citation | author-link = Northrop Frye | first = Northrop | last = Frye | title = quote}}{{Sfn | Elliott | 2004}} (literary critic).}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anatomy of Criticism|last=Frye|first=Northrup|publisher=Princeton UP|year=1957|isbn=0-691-06004-5|location=Princeton|pages=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;—but [[parody]], [[burlesque (literary)|burlesque]], [[exaggeration]],&lt;ref name="Claridge2010p257"/&gt; juxtaposition, comparison, analogy, and [[double entendre]] are all frequently used in satirical speech and writing. This "militant" irony or sarcasm often professes to approve of (or at least accept as natural) the very things the satirist wishes to attack.

Satire is nowadays found in many artistic forms of expression, including [[internet meme]]s, literature, plays, commentary, television shows, and media such as lyrics.

==Etymology and roots ==

The word satire comes from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''satur'' and the subsequent phrase ''[[wikt:satura#Latin|lanx satura]].'' ''Satur'' meant "full" but the juxtaposition with ''lanx'' shifted the meaning to "miscellany or medley": the expression ''lanx satura'' literally means "a full dish of various kinds of fruits".&lt;ref name="Kharpertian"&gt;{{Citation | first = Theodore D | last = Kharpertian | contribution = Thomas Pynchon and Postmodern American Satire | pages = 25–7 | editor-last = Kharpertian | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=um0h0arlUdoC | title = A hand to turn the time: the Menippean satires of Thomas Pynchon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''satura'' as used by [[Quintilian]], however, was used to denote only Roman verse satire, a strict genre that imposed [[hexameter]] form, a narrower genre than what would be later intended as ''satire''.&lt;ref name="Kharpertian" /&gt;{{Sfn | Branham | 1997 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=XrNEns3_yd0C&amp;pg=PR24 xxiv]}} Quintilian famously said that ''satura,'' that is a satire in hexameter verses, was a literary genre of wholly Roman origin (''satura tota nostra est''). He was aware of and commented on Greek satire, but at the time did not label it as such, although today the origin of satire is considered to be [[Aristophanes' Old Comedy]]. The first critic to use the term "satire" in the modern broader sense was [[Apuleius]].&lt;ref name="Kharpertian"/&gt;

To Quintilian, the satire was a strict literary form, but the term soon escaped from the original narrow definition. Robert Elliott writes:
{{quote | As soon as a noun enters the domain of metaphor, as one modern scholar has pointed out, it clamours for extension; and satura (which had had no verbal, adverbial, or adjectival forms) was immediately broadened by appropriation from the Greek word for “satyr” (satyros) and its derivatives. The odd result is that the English “satire” comes from the Latin satura; but "satirize", "satiric", etc., are of Greek origin. By about the 4th century AD the writer of satires came to be known as satyricus; St. Jerome, for example, was called by one of his enemies 'a satirist in prose' ('satyricus scriptor in prosa').  Subsequent orthographic modifications obscured the Latin origin of the word satire: satura becomes satyra, and in England, by the 16th century, it was written 'satyre.'{{Sfn | Elliott | 2004}}}}

The word ''satire'' derives from ''satura'', and its origin was not influenced by the [[Greek mythology|Greek mythological]] figure of the ''[[satyr]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | quote = The [[Renaissance]] confusion of the two origins encouraged a satire more aggressive than that of its Roman forebearers | first = BL | last = Ullman | title = Satura and Satire | journal = Classical Philology | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | year = 1913 | jstor = 262450 | doi = 10.1086/359771 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century, philologist [[Isaac Casaubon]] was the first to dispute the etymology of satire from satyr, contrary to the belief up to that time.&lt;ref&gt;Antonia Szabari (2009) ''Less Rightly Said: Scandals and Readers in Sixteenth-Century France'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=3-QJLqEwvb0C&amp;pg=PA2 p.2]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Humour==
{{rquote|right|The rules of satire are such that it must do more than make you laugh. No matter how amusing it is, it doesn't count unless you find yourself wincing a little even as you chuckle.&lt;ref name="galaxy196806"&gt;{{Cite magazine

[[Laughter]] is not an essential component of satire;{{Sfn | Corum | 2002 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=ikGt9gkXv74C&amp;pg=PA175 175]}} in fact there are types of satire that are not meant to be "funny" at all. Conversely, not all humour, even on such topics as politics, religion or art is necessarily "satirical", even when it uses the satirical tools of irony, parody, and [[burlesque]].

Even light-hearted satire has a serious "after-taste": the organizers of the [[Ig Nobel Prize]] describe this as "first make people laugh, and then make them think".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://improbable.com/ig/ | title = Improbable | contribution = Ig}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social and psychological functions==
Satire and [[irony]] in some cases have been regarded as the most effective source to understand a society, the oldest form of [[social study]].&lt;ref name="Rosenberg1960p155"/&gt; They provide the keenest insights into a group's [[Collective unconscious|collective psyche]], reveal its deepest values and tastes, and the society's structures of power.&lt;ref name="Deloria69p146"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nash1970p203"/&gt; Some authors have regarded satire as superior to non-comic and non-artistic disciplines like history or [[anthropology]].&lt;ref name="Rosenberg1960p155"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Babcock1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Coppola"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Jo | last = Coppola | title = Comedy on Television | publisher = Commonweal | date = 12 December 1958 | page = 288 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a prominent example from [[ancient Greece]], philosopher [[Plato]], when asked by a friend for a book to understand Athenian society, referred him to the plays of [[Aristophanes]].&lt;ref name="Willi2003p1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ehrenberg1962p39"/&gt;

Historically, satire has satisfied the popular [[need]] to [[debunk]] and [[Ridiculous|ridicule]] the leading figures in politics, economy, religion and other prominent realms of [[Power (social and political)|power]].&lt;ref name="Bevere2006p265"/&gt; Satire confronts [[public discourse]] and the [[collective imaginary]], playing as a public opinion counterweight to power (be it political, economic, religious, symbolic, or otherwise), by challenging leaders and authorities. For instance, it forces administrations to clarify, amend or establish their policies. Satire's job is to expose problems and contradictions, and it's not obligated to solve them.&lt;ref name="WieseForbes2010p.xv"/&gt; [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]] set in the history of satire a prominent example of a satirist role as confronting public discourse.&lt;ref name="Knight2004p254"/&gt;

For its nature and social role, satire has enjoyed in many societies a special freedom license to mock prominent individuals and institutions.&lt;ref name="Test1991p9licencequote"/&gt; The satiric impulse, and its ritualized expressions, carry out the function of resolving social tension.&lt;ref name="Test1991p8"/&gt; Institutions like the [[ritual clown]]s, by giving expression to the [[antisocial tendencies]], represent a [[safety valve]] which re-establishes equilibrium and health in the [[collective imaginary]], which are jeopardized by the [[Social repression|repressive aspects of society]].&lt;ref name="Cazeneuve1957p244"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Durand1984p106"/&gt;

The state of [[political satire]] in a given society reflects the tolerance or intolerance that characterizes it,&lt;ref name="Bevere2006p265"/&gt; and the state of [[civil liberties]] and [[human rights]]. Under [[totalitarianism|totalitarian regimes]] any criticism of a political system, and especially satire, is suppressed. A typical example is the [[Soviet Union]] where the [[dissidents]], such as [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] and [[Andrei Sakharov]] were under strong pressure from the government. While satire of everyday life in the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] was allowed, the most prominent satirist being [[Arkady Raikin]], political satire existed in the form of [[anecdote]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://samlib.ru/j/jacko_w_a/anecdotes.shtml | last = Yatsko | first = V | title = Russian folk funny stories}}&lt;/ref&gt; that made fun of Soviet political leaders, especially [[Brezhnev]], famous for his narrow-mindedness and love for awards and decorations.

==Classifications==
Satire is a diverse genre which is complex to classify and define, with a wide range of satiric "modes".&lt;ref&gt;Corum (2002) [https://books.google.com/books?id=ikGt9gkXv74C&amp;pg=PA163 p.163]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Worcester (1968) [https://books.google.com/books?id=foUbAQAAIAAJ ''The Art of Satire''] p.16&lt;/ref&gt;

===Horatian, Juvenalian, Menippean===
[[File:Satire (Orazio) - pag. 12.JPG|thumb|upright|&lt;center&gt;"Le satire e l'epistole di Q. Orazio Flacco", printed in 1814.&lt;/center&gt;]]
Satirical literature can commonly be categorized as either Horatian, Juvenalian, or [[Menippean satire|Menippean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Müller|first=Rolf Arnold|title=Komik und Satire|year=1973|publisher=Juris-Verlag|location=Zürich|isbn=978-3-260-03570-8 | language = German |page= 92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Horatian====
Horatian satire, named for the Roman satirist [[Horace]] (65–8 BCE), playfully criticizes some social vice through gentle, mild, and light-hearted humour. Horace (Quintus Horatius Flaccus) wrote Satires to gently ridicule the dominant opinions and "philosophical beliefs of ancient Rome and Greece" (Rankin).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-horatian-satire.htm|title=What Is Horatian Satire?|work=wiseGEEK}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than writing in harsh or accusing tones, he addressed issues with humor and clever mockery. Horatian satire follows this same pattern of "gently [ridiculing] the absurdities and follies of human beings" (Drury).&lt;ref name=nku.edu&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nku.edu/~rkdrury/422/satire_terms.html|title=Satire Terms|work=nku.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;It directs wit, exaggeration, and self-deprecating humour toward what it identifies as folly, rather than evil. Horatian satire's sympathetic tone is common in modern society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|  authorlink = Raja Sharma | first = Raja | last = Sharma | title = [["Comedy" in New Light-Literary Studies]]|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;A Horatian satirist's goal is to heal the situation with smiles, rather than by anger. Horatian satire is a gentle reminder to take life less seriously and evokes a wry smile.&lt;ref name=nku.edu/&gt; A Horatian satirist makes fun of general human folly rather than engaging in specific or personal attacks. Shamekia Thomas suggests, "In a work using Horatian satire, readers often laugh at the characters in the story who are the subject of mockery as well as themselves and society for behaving in those ways." [[Alexander Pope]] has been established as an author whose satire "heals with morals what it hurts with wit" (Green).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uh.edu/honors/Programs-Minors/honors-and-the-schools/houston-teachers-institute/curriculum-units/pdfs/2008/comedy/green-08-comedy.pdf|title=The Golden Age of Satire: Alexander Pope and Jonathan Swift|author=Patricia, Green}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander Pope—and Horatian satire—attempt to teach.

====Juvenalian====
{{See also|Satires of Juvenal}}
Juvenalian satire, named for the writings of the Roman satirist [[Juvenal]] (late first century – early second century AD), is more contemptuous and abrasive than the Horatian. Juvenal disagreed with the opinions of the public figures and institutions of the Republic and actively attacked them through his literature. "He utilized the satirical tools of exaggeration and parody to make his targets appear monstrous and incompetent" (Podzemny).&lt;ref name="wisegeek.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-juvenalian-satire.htm|title=What Is Juvenalian Satire?|work=wiseGEEK}}&lt;/ref&gt; Juvenal satire follows this same pattern of abrasively ridiculing societal structures. Juvenal also, unlike Horace, attacked public officials and governmental organizations through his satires, regarding their opinions as not just wrong, but evil.

Following in this tradition, Juvenalian satire addresses perceived social evil through scorn, outrage, and savage ridicule. This form is often pessimistic, characterized by the use of irony, sarcasm, moral indignation and personal invective, with less emphasis on humor. Strongly polarized political satire can often be classified as Juvenalian.&lt;br /&gt;A Juvenal satirist's goal is generally to provoke some sort of political or societal change because he sees his opponent or object as evil or harmful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.literarydevices.com/satire/|title=Satire Examples and Definition|work=Literary Devices}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Juvenal satirist mocks "societal structure, power, and civilization" (Thomas)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education-portal.com/academy/lesson/satire-in-literature-definition-types-examples.html|title=Satire in Literature: Definition, Types &amp; Examples|work=Education Portal}}&lt;/ref&gt; by exaggerating the words or position of his opponent in order to jeopardize their opponent's reputation and/or power. [[Jonathan Swift]] has been established as an author who "borrowed heavily from Juvenal's techniques in [his critique] of contemporary English society" (Podzemny).&lt;ref name="wisegeek.com" /&gt;

===Satire versus teasing===
In the [[history of theatre]] there has always been a conflict between engagement and disengagement on [[politics]] and relevant issue, between satire and [[grotesque]] on one side, and [[jest]] with [[teasing]] on the other.&lt;ref name="Fo1990p9"/&gt; [[Max Eastman]] defined the [[spectrum]] of satire in terms of "degrees of biting", as ranging from satire proper at the hot-end, and "kidding" at the violet-end; Eastman adopted the term kidding to denote what is just satirical in form, but is not really firing at the target.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author-link = Max Eastman | first = Max | last = Eastman | year = 1936 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Tyd5wwn8acwC&amp;pg=PA236 | title = Enjoyment of Laughter | chapter = IV. Degrees of Biting | pages = 236–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel laureate]] satirical playwright [[Dario Fo]] pointed out the difference between satire and teasing (''sfottò'').&lt;ref name="Lorch1997p128"&gt;{{Citation | author1-link = Dario Fo | first1 = Dario | last1 = Fo | first2 = Jennifer | last2 = Lorch | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=u12fXi_HDO4C&amp;pg=PA128 | title = Dario Fo | page = 128 | quote = In other writings Fo makes an important distinction between ''sfottò'' and satire.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teasing is the [[reactionary]] side of the [[comic]]; it limits itself to a shallow [[parody]] of physical appearance. The side-effect of teasing is that it humanizes and draws sympathy for the powerful individual towards which it is directed. Satire instead uses the comic to go against power and its oppressions, has a [[subversive]] character, and a [[moral]] dimension which draws judgement against its targets.&lt;ref name="Fo1990p2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fo1990pn" /&gt;{{Refn | name = "Arroyop303" | {{Citation | first1 = José Luís Blas | last1 = Arroyo | first2 = Mónica Velando | last2 = Casanova | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CxZ_zH44PVkC&amp;pg=PA303 | title = Discurso y sociedad: contribuciones al estudio de la lengua en... | volume = 1 | pages = 303–4}} }}&lt;ref name = "Morson1988p114"&gt;{{Citation | last = Morson | first = Gary Saul | year = 1988 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=PpLiINhO83MC&amp;pg=PA114 | title = Boundaries of Genre | page = 114 | quote = second, that parodies can be, as Bakhtin observes, "shallow" as well as "deep" (''Problems of Dostoevsky's Poetics'', 160), which is to say, directed at superficial as well as fundamental faults of the original. [...] the distinction between shallow and deep [...] [is] helpful in understanding the complex ways in which parodies are used. For instance, shallow parody is sometimes used to pay an author an indirect compliment. The opposite of damning with faint praise, this parody with faint criticism may be designed to show that no more fundamental criticism ''could'' be made.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fo formulated an [[Operational definition|operational]] criterion to tell real satire from ''sfottò'', saying that real satire arouses an outraged and violent reaction, and that the more they try to stop you, the better is the job you are doing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author-link = Daniele Luttazzi | first = Daniele | last = Luttazzi | year = 2005 | url = http://news.danieleluttazzi.it/?q=node/147 | archivedate = December 25, 2005 | place = [[Italy|IT]] | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051225171452/http://news.danieleluttazzi.it/?q=node%2F147 | title = Matrix | quote = Dario Fo disse a Satyricon: —La satira vera si vede dalla reazione che suscita. | deadurl = yes | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fo contends that, historically, people in positions of power have welcomed and encouraged good-humoured buffoonery, while modern day people in positions of power have tried to censor, ostracize and repress satire.&lt;ref name="Fo1990p9"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fo1990p2"/&gt;

Teasing (''sfottò'') is an ancient form of simple [[buffoonery]], a form of comedy without satire's subversive edge. Teasing includes light and affectionate parody, good-humoured mockery, simple one-dimensional poking fun, and benign spoofs. Teasing typically consists of an [[Impressionist (entertainment)|impersonation]] of someone monkeying around with his exterior attributes, [[tic]]s, physical blemishes, voice and mannerisms, quirks, way of dressing and walking, and/or the phrases he typically repeats. By contrast, teasing never touches on the core issue, never makes a serious criticism judging the target with [[irony]]; it never harms the target's conduct, [[ideology]] and position of power; it never undermines the perception of his morality and cultural dimension.&lt;ref name="Fo1990p2"/&gt;{{Refn | name="Arroyop303"}} ''Sfottò'' directed towards a powerful individual makes him appear more human and draws sympathy towards him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author-link = Daniele Luttazzi | first = Daniele | last = Luttazzi | language = Italian | url = http://www.nazioneindiana.com/2003/10/28/state-a-casa-a-fare-i-compiti-2/ | title = State a casa a fare i compiti | format = interview | editor1-first = Federica | editor1-last = Fracassi | editor2-first = Jacopo | editor2-last = Guerriero | journal = Nazione Indiana |date=October 2003 | quote = Lo sfottò è reazionario.

===Classifications by topics===
Types of satire can also be classified according to the topics it deals with. From the earliest times, at least since the plays of [[Aristophanes]], the primary topics of literary satire have been [[politics]], [[religion]] and [[sex]].&lt;ref name="Clark91p116"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark73p20"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark80p45"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ferdie Addis (2012) ''Qual è il tuo "tallone da killer"?'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=kKysGIQV4SgC&amp;pg=PT20 p.20]&lt;/ref&gt; This is partly because these are the most pressing problems that affect anybody living in a society, and partly because these topics are usually [[taboo]].&lt;ref name="Clark91p116"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hodgart2009p33"/&gt; Among these, politics in the broader sense is considered the pre-eminent topic of satire.&lt;ref name="Hodgart2009p33"/&gt; Satire which targets the [[clergy]] is a type of [[political satire]], while [[religious satire]] is that which targets [[religious belief]]s.&lt;ref name="Hodgart2009p39"/&gt; Satire on sex may overlap with [[blue comedy]], [[off-color humor]] and [[dick joke]]s.

[[Scatology]] has a long literary association with satire,&lt;ref name="Clark91p116"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson2002pp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Anspaugh94"/&gt; as it is a classical mode of the [[grotesque]], the [[grotesque body]] and the satiric grotesque.&lt;ref name="Clark91p116"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andries2000p10"/&gt; [[Shit]] plays a fundamental role in satire because it symbolizes [[death]], the turd being "the ultimate dead object".&lt;ref name="Wilson2002pp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Anspaugh94"/&gt; The satirical comparison of individuals or institutions with human [[excrement]], exposes their "inherent inertness, corruption and dead-likeness".&lt;ref name="Wilson2002pp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Klein1993p20"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Duprat1982p178"/&gt; The [[ritual clown]]s of [[clown societies]], like among the [[Pueblo Indians]], have ceremonies with [[Coprophagia|filth-eating]].&lt;ref name="Parsons34"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hyers96"/&gt; In other cultures, [[sin-eating]] is an [[Apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] rite in which the sin-eater (also called filth-eater),&lt;ref&gt;Donald Alexander Mackenzie (1923) ''Myths of Pre-Columbian America'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=6chKHROa1icC&amp;pg=PA229 p.229]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Marnham (2000) ''Dreaming with His Eyes Open: A Life of Diego Rivera'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=pcddElQo9JkC&amp;pg=PA297 p.297]&lt;/ref&gt; by ingesting the food provided, takes "upon himself the sins of the departed".&lt;ref name="Davidson 1993p85"/&gt; Satire about death overlaps with [[black humor]] and [[gallows humor]].

Another classification by topics is the distinction between political satire, religious satire and satire of manners.&lt;ref name="Bloom1979"/&gt; Political satire is sometimes called topical satire, satire of manners is sometimes called satire of everyday life, and religious satire is sometimes called philosophical satire. [[Comedy of manners]], sometimes also called satire of manners, criticizes mode of life of common people; political satire aims at behavior, manners of politicians, and vices of political systems. Historically, comedy of manners, which first appeared in British theater in 1620, has uncritically accepted the social code of the upper classes.&lt;ref name="Nicoll1951p179"/&gt; Comedy in general accepts the rules of the social game, while satire subverts them.&lt;ref name="Hodgart2009p189"/&gt;

Another analysis of satire is the spectrum of his possible [[Tone (literature)|tone]]s: [[wit]], [[ridicule]], [[irony]], [[sarcasm]], [[Cynicism (philosophy)|cynicism]], the [[sardonic]] and [[invective]].&lt;ref name="Pollard1970p66"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark1946p32"/&gt;

===Classifications by medium===
Satire is found not only in written literary forms. In [[preliterate culture]]s it manifests itself in [[ritual clown|ritual]] and folk forms, as well as in [[trickster]] tales and [[oral poetry]].&lt;ref name="Test1991p8"/&gt;

It appears also in graphic arts, music, sculpture, dance, [[cartoon strip]]s, and [[graffiti]]. Examples are [[Dada]] sculptures, [[Pop Art]] works, music of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] and [[Erik Satie]], [[Punk rock|punk]] and [[rock music]].&lt;ref name="Test1991p8"/&gt; In modern [[media culture]], [[stand-up comedy]] is an enclave in which satire can be introduced into [[mass media]], challenging [[mainstream]] discourse.&lt;ref name="Test1991p8"/&gt; [[Roast (comedy)|Comedy roast]]s, mock festivals, and stand-up comedians in nightclubs and concerts are the modern forms of ancient satiric rituals.&lt;ref name="Test1991p8"/&gt;

[[File:WLA brooklynmuseum Figured Ostracon Showing a Cat Waiting on a Mouse.jpg|thumb|Figured ostracon showing a cat waiting on a mouse, Egypt]]
One of the earliest examples of what we might call satire, [[The Satire of the Trades]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = M | last = Lichtheim | title = Ancient Egyptian Literature | volume = I | year = 1973 | pages = 184–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; is in Egyptian writing from the beginning of the 2nd millennium BC. The text's apparent readers are students, tired of studying. It argues that their lot as scribes is not only useful, but far superior to that of the ordinary man. Scholars such as Helck&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = W | last = Helck | title = Die Lehre des DwA-xtjj | publisher = Wiesbaden | year = 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; think that the context was meant to be serious.

The [[Papyrus Anastasi I]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Alan H | last = Gardiner | title = Egyptian Hieratic Texts | series= I: Literary Texts of the New Kingdom | volume = I | place = Leipzig | year = 1911}}&lt;/ref&gt; (late 2nd millennium BC) contains a satirical letter which first praises the virtues of its recipient, but then mocks the reader's meagre knowledge and achievements.

===Ancient Greece===
The Greeks had no word for what later would be called "satire", although the terms cynicism and parody were used. Modern critics call the [[Greek comedy|Greek playwright]] [[Aristophanes]] one of the best known early satirists: his plays are known for their critical political and [[societal commentary]],&lt;ref name="Sutton, D. F. 1993 p.56"&gt;{{Citation | last = Sutton | first = DF | title = Ancient Comedy: The War of the Generations | place = New York | year = 1993 | page = 56}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly for the [[political satire]] by which he criticized the powerful [[Cleon]] (as in ''[[The Knights]]''). He is also notable for the persecution he underwent.&lt;ref name="Sutton, D. F. 1993 p.56" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.theatrehistory.com/ancient/aristophanes003.html | chapter = Political and social satires of Aristophanes | editor-first = Alfred | editor-last = Bates | title = The Drama, Its History, Literature and Influence on Civilization | volume = 2 | place = London | publisher = Historical Publishing | year = 1906 | pages = 55–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = JE | last = Atkinson | jstor = 639144 | title = Curbing the Comedians: Cleon versus Aristophanes and Syracosius' Decree | journal = The Classical Quarterly | series = New | volume = 42 | number = 1 | year = 1992 | pages = 56–64 | doi=10.1017/s0009838800042580}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0714-06.htm | title = Aristophanes: the Michael Moore of his Day | first = John Louis | last = Anderson | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061019054115/http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0714-06.htm | archivedate = October 19, 2006 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristophanes' plays turned upon images of filth and disease.{{Sfn | Wilson | 2002 | p = 17}} His bawdy style was adopted by Greek dramatist-comedian [[Menander]]. His early play ''Drunkenness'' contains an attack on the politician [[Callimedon]].

The oldest form of satire still in use is the [[Menippean satire]] by [[Menippus|Menippus of Gadara]]. His own writings are lost. Examples from his admirers and imitators mix seriousness and mockery in dialogues and present parodies before a background of [[wikt:diatribe|diatribe]]. As in the case of Aristophanes plays, menippean satire turned upon images of filth and disease.{{Sfn | Wilson | 2002 | p = 17}}

===Roman world===
The first Roman to discuss satire critically was [[Quintilian]], who invented the term to describe the writings of [[Gaius Lucilius]]. The two most prominent and influential ancient Roman satirists are [[Horace]] and [[Satires of Juvenal|Juvenal]], who wrote during the early days of the [[Roman Empire]]. Other important satirists in ancient [[Latin]] are Gaius Lucilius and [[Persius]]. ''Satire'' in their work is much wider than in the modern sense of the word, including fantastic and highly coloured humorous writing with little or no real mocking intent. When Horace criticized [[Augustus]], he used [[veil]]ed ironic terms. In contrast, [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] reports that the 6th-century-BC poet [[Hipponax]] wrote ''satirae'' that were so cruel that the offended hanged themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Cuddon | title = Dictionary of Literary Terms | place = Oxford | year = 1998 | contribution = Satire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2nd century AD, [[Lucian]] wrote ''[[True History]]'', a book satirizing the clearly unrealistic travelogues/adventures written by [[Ctesias]], [[Iambulus]], and [[Homer]]. He states that he was surprised they expected people to believe their lies, and stating that he, like they, has no actual knowledge or experience, but shall now tell lies as if he did. He goes on to describe a far more obviously extreme and unrealistic tale, involving interplanetary exploration, war among alien life forms, and life inside a 200 mile long whale back in the terrestrial ocean, all intended to make obvious the fallacies of books like ''[[Indica (Ctesias)|Indica]]'' and ''[[The Odyssey]]''.

===Medieval Islamic world===
{{main|Arabic literature#Satire and comedy|Persian satire|l1=Arabic satire}}
Medieval [[Arabic poetry]] included the satiric genre ''hija''. Satire was introduced into [[Arabic literature|Arabic prose literature]] by the [[Afro-Arab]] author [[Al-Jahiz]] in the 9th century. While dealing with serious topics in what are now known as [[anthropology]], [[Sociology in medieval Islam|sociology]] and [[Psychology in medieval Islam|psychology]], he introduced a satirical approach, "based on the premise that, however serious the subject under review, it could be made more interesting and thus achieve greater effect, if only one leavened the lump of solemnity by the insertion of a few amusing anecdotes or by the throwing out of some witty or paradoxical observations. He was well aware that, in treating of new themes in his prose works, he would have to employ a vocabulary of a nature more familiar in ''hija'', satirical poetry."{{Sfn | Bosworth| 1976| p = 32}} For example, in one of his [[Zoology|zoological]] works, he satirized the preference for longer [[human penis size]], writing: "If the length of the penis were a sign of honor, then the [[mule]] would belong to the (honorable tribe of) [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraysh]]". Another satirical story based on this preference was an ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' tale called "Ali with the Large Member".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = The Arabian Nights Encyclopedia | first1 = Ulrich | last1 = Marzolph | first2 = Richard | last2 = van Leeuwen| first3 = Hassan | last3 = Wassouf | publisher = ABC-CLIO| year = 2004 | isbn= 1-57607-204-5|pages=97–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 10th century, the writer [[Tha'alibi]] recorded satirical poetry written by the Arabic poets As-Salami and Abu Dulaf, with As-Salami praising Abu Dulaf's [[Polymath|wide breadth of knowledge]] and then mocking his ability in all these subjects, and with Abu Dulaf responding back and satirizing As-Salami in return.{{Sfn | Bosworth| 1976| pp = 77–8}} An example of Arabic political satire included another 10th-century poet Jarir satirizing Farazdaq as "a transgressor of the [[Sharia]]" and later Arabic poets in turn using the term "Farazdaq-like" as a form of political satire.{{Sfn | Bosworth| 1976| p = 70}}

The terms "[[comedy]]" and "satire" became synonymous after [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' was translated into [[Arabic language|Arabic]] in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], where it was elaborated upon by [[Early Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosophers]] and writers, such as Abu Bischr, his pupil [[Al-Farabi]], [[Avicenna]], and [[Averroes]]. Due to cultural differences, they disassociated comedy from [[Greek drama]]tic representation and instead identified it with [[Arabic poetry|Arabic poetic]] themes and forms, such as ''hija'' (satirical poetry). They viewed comedy as simply the "art of reprehension", and made no reference to light and cheerful events, or troubled beginnings and happy endings, associated with classical Greek comedy. After the [[Latin translations of the 12th century]], the term "comedy" thus gained a new semantic meaning in [[Medieval literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Comedy as Satire in Hispano-Arabic Spain |first=Edwin J |last=Webber|journal=Hispanic Review|volume=26|issue=1|date=January 1958|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]]|pages=1–11|doi=10.2307/470561| jstor=470561}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ubayd Zakani]] introduced satire in [[Persian literature]] during the 14th century. His work is noted for its satire and obscene verses, often political or bawdy, and often cited in debates involving [[homosexual]] practices. He wrote the ''Resaleh-ye Delgosha'', as well as ''Akhlaq al-Ashraf'' ("Ethics of the Aristocracy") and the famous humorous fable ''Masnavi Mush-O-Gorbeh'' (Mouse and Cat), which was a political satire. His non-satirical serious classical verses have also been regarded as very well written, in league with the other great works of [[Persian literature]]. Between 1905 and 1911, [[Bibi Khatoon Astarabadi]] and other Iranian writers wrote notable satires.

===Medieval Europe===
In the [[Early Middle Ages]], examples of satire were the songs by [[Goliard]]s or [[Clerici vagantes|vagant]]s now best known as an anthology called [[Carmina Burana]] and made famous as texts of a composition by the 20th-century composer [[Carl Orff]]. Satirical poetry is believed to have been popular, although little has survived. With the advent of the [[High Middle Ages]] and the birth of modern [[vernacular literature]] in the 12th century, it began to be used again, most notably by [[Chaucer]]. The disrespectful manner was considered "unchristian" and ignored, except for the '''moral satire''', which mocked misbehaviour in Christian terms. Examples are ''[[Livre des Manières]]'' by {{ill|Étienne de Fougères|fr}} (~1178), and some of Chaucer's ''[[Canterbury Tales]]''. Sometimes [[Epic poetry|epic poetry (epos)]] was mocked, and even feudal society, but there was hardly a general interest in the genre.

===Early modern western satire===
[[File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - The Parable of the Blind Leading the Blind - WGA3511.jpg|right|thumb|[[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]]'s 1568 satirical painting ''[[The Blind Leading the Blind]]''.]]
Direct [[social commentary]] via satire returned with a vengeance in the 16th century, when farcical texts such as the works of [[François Rabelais]] tackled more serious issues (and incurred the wrath of the crown as a result).

Two major satirists of [[Europe]] in the [[Renaissance]] were [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] and [[François Rabelais]]. Other examples of Renaissance satire include ''[[Till Eulenspiegel]]'', ''[[Reynard the Fox]]'', [[Sebastian Brant]]'s ''[[Ship of Fools|Narrenschiff]]'' (1494), [[Erasmus]]'s ''[[Moriae Encomium]]'' (1509), [[Thomas More]]'s ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'' (1516), and ''[[Carajicomedia]]'' (1519).'''

The [[Elizabethan]] (i.e. 16th-century English) writers thought of satire as related to the notoriously rude, coarse and sharp satyr play. Elizabethan "satire" (typically in pamphlet form) therefore contains more straightforward abuse than subtle irony. The French [[Huguenot]] [[Isaac Casaubon]] pointed out in 1605 that satire in the Roman fashion was something altogether more civilised. Casaubon discovered and published Quintilian's writing and presented the original meaning of the term (satira, not satyr), and the sense of wittiness (reflecting the "dishfull of fruits") became more important again. Seventeenth-century English satire once again aimed at the "amendment of vices" ([[Dryden]]).

In the 1590s a new wave of verse satire broke with the publication of [[Joseph Hall (bishop)|Hall]]'s ''Virgidemiarum'', six books of verse satires targeting everything from literary fads to corrupt noblemen. Although [[John Donne|Donne]] had already circulated satires in manuscript, Hall's was the first real attempt in English at verse satire on the Juvenalian model.{{Sfn | Hall | 1969 | ps =: ‘Hall's ''Virgidemiae'' was a new departure in that the true Juvenalian mode of satire was being attempted for the first time, and successfully, in English.’}}{{Rp| needed = yes|date=October 2012}} The success of his work combined with a national mood of disillusion in the last years of Elizabeth's reign triggered an avalanche of satire—much of it less conscious of classical models than Hall's — until the fashion was brought to an abrupt stop by censorship.{{Refn|group="lower-alpha"|The Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of London, the censors of the press, issued Orders to the Stationers' Company on June 1 and 4, 1599, prohibiting the further printing of satires—the so-called 'Bishop's Ban'.{{Sfn | Davenport | 1969}}{{Rp| needed = yes|date=October 2012}}}}

===Age of Enlightenment===
[[File:A Welch wedding. Satire c.1780.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|'A Welch wedding' Satirical Cartoon c.1780]]
The [[Age of Enlightenment]], an intellectual movement in the 17th and 18th centuries advocating rationality, produced a great revival of satire in Britain. This was fuelled by the rise of partisan politics, with the formalisation of the [[Tory]] and [[British Whig Party|Whig]] parties—and also, in 1714, by the formation of the [[Scriblerus Club]], which included [[Alexander Pope]], [[Jonathan Swift]], [[John Gay]], [[John Arbuthnot]], [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Robert Harley]], [[Thomas Parnell]], and [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke]]. This club included several of the notable satirists of early-18th-century Britain. They focused their attention on Martinus Scriblerus, "an invented learned fool... whose work they attributed all that was tedious, narrow-minded, and pedantic in contemporary scholarship".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The Broadview Anthology of British Literature: The Restoration and the Eighteenth Century | volume = 3 | page = 435}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their hands astute and biting satire of institutions and individuals became a popular weapon. The turn to the 18th century was characterized by a switch from Horatian, soft, pseudo-satire, to biting "juvenal" satire.&lt;ref name="Weinbrot2007p136"&gt;Weinbrot, Howard D. (2007) ''Eighteenth-Century Satire: Essays on Text and Context from Dryden to Peter...'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=vHADZOHbJ2QC&amp;pg=PA136 p.136]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jonathan Swift]] was one of the greatest of Anglo-Irish satirists, and one of the first to practise modern journalistic satire. For instance, In his ''[[A Modest Proposal]]'' Swift suggests that Irish peasants be encouraged to sell their own children as food for the rich, as a solution to the "problem" of poverty. His purpose is of course to attack indifference to the plight of the desperately poor. In his book ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' he writes about the flaws in human society in general and English society in particular. [[John Dryden]] wrote an influential essay entitled "A Discourse Concerning the Original and Progress of Satire"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~jlynch/Texts/drydendiscourse2.html | editor-first = Jack | editor-last = Lynch | publisher = Rutgers | last = Dryden | first = John | title = Discourse | number = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; that helped fix the definition of satire in the literary world. His satirical ''[[Mac Flecknoe]]'' was written in response to a rivalry with [[Thomas Shadwell]] and eventually inspired [[Alexander Pope]] to write his satirical ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]''. Other satirical works by Pope include the ''[[Epistle to Dr Arbuthnot]]''.

[[Alexander Pope]] (b. May 21, 1688) was a satirist known for his Horatian satirist style and translation of the ''[[Iliad]]''. Famous throughout and after the [[Long eighteenth century|long 18th century]], Pope died in 1744.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/alexander-pope-9444371#synopsis|title=Biography of Alexander Pope § Synopsis|work=Biography.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pope, in his ''The Rape of the Lock'', is delicately chiding society in a sly but polished voice by holding up a mirror to the follies and vanities of the upper class. Pope does not actively attack the self-important pomp of the British aristocracy, but rather presents it in such a way that gives the reader a new perspective from which to easily view the actions in the story as foolish and ridiculous. A mockery of the upper class, more delicate and lyrical than brutal, Pope nonetheless is able to effectively illuminate the moral degradation of society to the public. ''The Rape of the Lock'' assimilates the masterful qualities of a heroic epic, such as the ''Iliad'', which Pope was translating at the time of writing ''The Rape of the Lock''. However, Pope applied these qualities satirically to a seemingly petty egotistical elitist quarrel to prove his point wryly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.studentpulse.com/articles/545/satire-in-18th-century-british-society-alexander-popes-the-rape-of-the-lock-and-jonathan-swifts-a-modest-proposal|title=Satire in 18th Century British Society: Alexander Pope's ''The Rape of the Lock'' and Jonathan Swift's ''A Modest Proposal''|year=2011|journal=Student Pulse|volume=3|issue=06|author=Jonathan J.

[[Daniel Defoe]] pursued a more journalistic type of satire, being famous for his ''[[The True-Born Englishman]]'' which mocks [[Xenophobia|xenophobic]] patriotism, and ''[[The Shortest-Way with the Dissenters]]''—advocating [[religious toleration]] by means of an ironical exaggeration of the highly intolerant attitudes of his time.

The pictorial satire of [[William Hogarth]] is a precursor to the development of [[political cartoons]] in 18th-century England.&lt;ref name="Press"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fwzWAAAAMAAJ|title=The Political Cartoon|author=Charles Press|year=1981|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The medium developed under the direction of its greatest exponent, [[James Gillray]] from London.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; With his satirical works calling the king (George III), prime ministers and generals (especially Napoleon) to account, Gillray's wit and keen sense of the ridiculous made him the pre-eminent [[cartoonist]] of the era.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|title=Satire, sewers and statesmen: why James Gillray was king of the cartoon|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/mar/21/satire-sewers-and-statesmen-james-gillray-king-of-cartoon|agency=The Guardian|date=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ebenezer Cooke (poet)|Ebenezer Cooke]] (1665–1732), author of "The Sot-Weed Factor" (1708), was among the first American colonialists to write literary satire. [[Benjamin Franklin]] (1706–1790) and others followed, using satire to shape an emerging nation's culture through its sense of the ridiculous.

===Satire in Victorian England===
[[File:DV257 no.19 The donkey race.png|thumb|A Victorian satirical sketch depicting a gentleman's donkey race in 1852]]
Several satiric papers competed for the public's attention in the [[Victorian era]] (1837–1901) and [[Edwardian]] period, such as ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' (1841) and ''[[Fun (magazine)|Fun]]'' (1861).

Perhaps the most enduring examples of Victorian satire, however, are to be found in the [[Savoy Opera]]s of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]. In fact, in ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'', a jester is given lines that paint a very neat picture of the method and purpose of the satirist, and might almost be taken as a statement of Gilbert's own intent:
:''"I can set a braggart quailing with a quip,
:''The upstart I can wither with a whim;
:''He may wear a merry laugh upon his lip,
:''But his laughter has an echo that is grim!"

Novelists such as [[Charles Dickens]] (1812-1870) often used passages of satiric writing in their treatment of social issues.

Continuing the tradition of Swiftian journalistic satire, [[Sidney Godolphin Osborne]] (1808-1889) was the most prominent writer of scathing "Letters to the Editor" of the [[London Times]]. Famous in his day, he is now all but forgotten. His maternal grandfather [[William Eden, 1st Baron Auckland]] was considered to be a possible candidate for the authorship of the [[Junius]] letters. If this were true, we can read Osborne as following in his grandfather's satiric "Letters to the Editor" path. Osborne's satire was so bitter and biting that at one point he received a public censure from [[Parliament]]'s then Home Secretary Sir [[James Graham, 3rd Duke of Montrose|James Graham]]. Osborne wrote mostly in the Juvenalian mode over a wide range of topics mostly centered on British government's and landlords' mistreatment of poor farm workers and field laborers. He bitterly opposed the [[New Poor Laws]] and was passionate on the subject of Great Britain's botched response to the [[Irish Famine]] and its mistreatment of soldiers during the [[Crimean War]].

Later in the nineteenth century, in the United States, [[Mark Twain]] (1835–1910) grew to become American's greatest satirist: his novel ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn|Huckleberry Finn]]'' (1884) is set in the [[Antebellum era|antebellum]] South, where the moral values Twain wishes to promote are completely turned on their heads. His hero, Huck, is a rather simple but goodhearted lad who is ashamed of the "sinful temptation" that leads him to help a runaway [[Slavery|slave]]. In fact his conscience, warped by the distorted moral world he has grown up in, often bothers him most when he is at his best. He is prepared to do good, believing it to be wrong.

Twain's younger contemporary [[Ambrose Bierce]] (1842–1913) gained notoriety as a [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynic]], pessimist and black humorist with his dark, bitterly ironic stories, many set during the [[American Civil War]], which satirized the limitations of human perception and reason. Bierce's most famous work of satire is probably ''[[The Devil's Dictionary]]'' (1906), in which the definitions mock cant, [[hypocrisy]] and [[Appeal to tradition|received wisdom]].

===20th-century satire===
[[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]] is considered the first major European satirist since [[Jonathan Swift]].&lt;ref name="Knight2004p254"&gt;Knight, Charles A. (2004) ''Literature of Satire'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=SOfVePSFctgC&amp;pg=PA254 p.254]&lt;/ref&gt; In 20th-century literature, satire was used by English authors such as [[Aldous Huxley]] (1930s) and [[George Orwell]] (1940s), which under the inspiration of [[Yevgeny Zamyatin|Zamyatin]]'s Russian 1921 novel ''[[We (novel)|We]]'', made serious and even frightening commentaries on the dangers of the sweeping social changes taking place throughout Europe. Many social critics of this same time in the United States, such as [[Dorothy Parker]] and [[H. L. Mencken]], used satire as their main weapon, and Mencken in particular is noted for having said that "one horse-laugh is worth ten thousand [[syllogism]]s" in the persuasion of the public to accept a criticism. Novelist [[Sinclair Lewis]] was known for his satirical stories such as ''[[Main Street (novel)|Main Street]]'' (1920), ''[[Babbitt (novel)|Babbitt]]'' (1922), ''[[Elmer Gantry]]'' (1927; dedicated by Lewis to H. L. Menchen), and ''[[It Can't Happen Here]]'' (1935), and his books often explored and satirized contemporary American values. The film ''[[The Great Dictator]]'' (1940) by [[Charlie Chaplin]] is itself a parody of [[Adolf Hitler]]; Chaplin later declared that he would have not made the film if he had known about the [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]].&lt;ref name="ChaplinLager"&gt;Chaplin (1964) ''My Autobiography'', p.392, quotation: {{quotation|Had I known of the actual horrors of the German concentration camps, I could not have made ''The Great Dictator'', I could not have made fun of the homicidal insanity of the Nazis.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States 1950s, satire was introduced into American [[stand-up comedy]] most prominently by [[Lenny Bruce]] and [[Mort Sahl]].&lt;ref name="Test1991p8"/&gt; As they challenged the [[taboo]]s and [[conventional wisdom]] of the time, were ostracized by the mass media establishment as ''[[sick comedian]]s''. In the same period, [[Paul Krassner]]'s magazine ''[[The Realist]]'' began publication, to become immensely popular during the 1960s and early 1970s among people in the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]]; it had articles and cartoons that were savage, biting satires of politicians such as [[Lyndon Johnson]] and [[Richard Nixon]], the [[Vietnam War]], the [[Cold War]] and the [[War on Drugs]]. This baton was also carried by the original [[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]] magazine, edited by [[Doug Kenney]] and [[Henry Beard]] and featuring blistering satire written by [[Michael O'Donoghue]], [[P.J. O'Rourke]], and [[Tony Hendra]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/07/01/funny-pages-how-the-national-lampoon-made-american-humor.html&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent satiric stand-up comedian [[George Carlin]] acknowledged the influence ''The Realist'' had in his 1970s conversion to a satiric comedian.&lt;ref name="Sullivan2010p94"&gt;Sullivan, James (2010) ''Seven Dirty Words: The Life and Crimes of George Carlin'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=y3dzVQ5wX9UC&amp;pg=PA94 p.94]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[George Carlin]] (2002) ''[http://paulkrassner.com/carlinintro.htm Introduction]'' to ''Murder At the Conspiracy Convention''&lt;/ref&gt;

A more humorous brand of satire enjoyed a renaissance in the UK in the early 1960s with the [[satire boom]], led by such luminaries as [[Peter Cook]], [[Alan Bennett]], [[Jonathan Miller]], and [[Dudley Moore]], whose stage show ''[[Beyond the Fringe]]'' was a hit not only in Britain, but also in the United States. Other significant influences in 1960s British satire include [[David Frost]], [[Eleanor Bron]] and the [[television program]] ''[[That Was The Week That Was]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/jun/14/david-frost-satire-documentary "David Frost's Q&amp;A on how to be a satirist"]. ''The Guardian'' (London). Retrieved February 2, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Heller]]'s most famous work, ''[[Catch-22]]'' (1961), satirizes bureaucracy and the military, and is frequently cited as one of the greatest literary works of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1868619.stm |title=What is Catch-22?

The film ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' (1964) starring [[Peter Sellers]] was a popular satire on the [[Cold War]].

===Contemporary satire===
Contemporary popular usage of the term "satire" is often very imprecise. While satire often uses [[caricature]] and [[parody]], by no means all uses of these or other humorous devices are satiric. Refer to the careful definition of satire that heads this article.

[[File:Spitting Image Puppet of Eric Cantona (2956625432).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Puppet of Manchester United striker [[Eric Cantona]] from the British satirical puppet show ''[[Spitting Image]]'']]
Satire is used on many UK television programmes, particularly popular panel shows and quiz shows such as ''[[Mock the Week]]'' (2005) and ''[[Have I Got News for You]]'' (1990–ongoing). It is found on radio quiz shows such as ''[[The News Quiz]]'' (1977–ongoing) and ''[[The Now Show]]'' (1998–ongoing). One of the most watched UK television shows of the 1980s and early 1990s, the puppet show ''[[Spitting Image]]'' was a satire of the [[British Royal Family|royal family]], politics, entertainment, sport and [[British culture]] of the era.&lt;ref&gt;Van Norris (2014). British Television Animation 1997–2010: Drawing Comic Tradition". p. 153.

The television program ''[[South Park]]'' (1997–ongoing) relies almost exclusively on satire to address issues in American culture, with episodes addressing [[The Passion of the Jew|anti-Semitism]], [[Go God Go|militant atheism]], [[Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride|homophobia]], [[Rainforest Shmainforest|environmentalism]], [[Gnomes (South Park)|corporate culture]], [[The Death Camp of Tolerance|political correctness]] and [[Red Hot Catholic Love|anti-Catholicism]], among many other issues.

Australian [[Chris Lilley (comedian)|Chris Lilley]] produces comedy art in the style of mockumentaries (''[[We Can Be Heroes: Finding The Australian of the Year|We Can Be Heroes]]'', ''[[Summer Heights High]]'', ''[[Angry Boys]]'') and his work is often described as complex social satire.

[[File:Stephen Colbert by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Stephen Colbert]] satirically impersonated an opinionated and self-righteous television commentator on his [[Comedy Central]] program in the U.S.]]
[[Stephen Colbert]]'s television program, ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' (2005–14), is instructive in the methods of contemporary American satire. [[Stephen Colbert (character)|Colbert's character]] is an opinionated and self-righteous commentator who, in his TV interviews, interrupts people, points and wags his finger at them, and "unwittingly" uses a number of logical fallacies. In doing so, he demonstrates the principle of modern American political satire: the ridicule of the actions of politicians and other public figures by taking all their statements and purported beliefs to their furthest (supposedly) logical conclusion, thus revealing their perceived hypocrisy or absurdity.

The American sketch comedy television show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' is also known for its satirical impressions and parodies of prominent persons and politicians, among some of the most notable, their parodies of U.S. political figures [[Saturday Night Live parodies of Hillary Clinton|Hillary Clinton]]&lt;ref name=TVGuide1&gt;[http://www.tvguide.com/news/snl-hillary-clinton-saturday-night-live-kate-mckinnon-amy-poehler/ Liz Raftery – "Who Did the Best Hillary Clinton Impression on SNL?", ''TV Guide'', April 30, 2015.

Other political satire includes various political causes in the past, including the relatively successful [[Polish Beer-Lovers' Party]] and the joke political candidates Molly the Dog&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.mollythedog2008.com/ | title = Molly the Dog | year = 2008 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090122053639/http://mollythedog2008.com/ | archivedate = January 22, 2009 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Brian Miner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.brianminer2008.com/ | title = Brian Miner | year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, a popular modern satirist is Sir [[Terry Pratchett]], author of the internationally best-selling ''[[Discworld]]'' book series. One of the most well-known and controversial British satirists is [[Chris Morris (satirist)|Chris Morris]], co-writer and director of ''[[Four Lions]]''.

In Canada, satire has become an important part of the comedy scene. [[Stephen Leacock]] was one of the best known early Canadian satirists, and in the early 20th century, he achieved fame by targeting the attitudes of small town life. In more recent years, Canada has had several prominent satirical television series and radio shows. Some, including ''[[CODCO]]'', ''[[The Royal Canadian Air Farce]]'', ''[[This Is That]]'', and ''[[This Hour Has 22 Minutes]]'' deal directly with current news stories and political figures, while others, like ''[[History Bites]]'' present contemporary social satire in the context of events and figures in history. The Canadian organization ''[[Canada News Network]]'' provides commentary on contemporary news events that are primarily Canadian in nature. Canadian songwriter [[Nancy White (singer-songwriter)|Nancy White]] uses music as the vehicle for her satire, and her comic folk songs are regularly played on [[CBC Radio One|CBC Radio]].

Cartoonists often use satire as well as straight humour. [[Al Capp]]'s satirical [[comic strip]] ''[[Li'l Abner]]'' was censored in September 1947. The controversy, as reported in ''Time'', centred on Capp's portrayal of the US Senate. Said Edward Leech of Scripps-Howard, "We don't think it is good editing or sound citizenship to picture the Senate as an assemblage of freaks and crooks... boobs and undesirables."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,804275,00.html |title=Tain't Funny – ''Time'' |publisher=Time.com |date=September 29, 1947 |accessdate=August 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walt Kelly]]'s ''[[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]'' was likewise censored in 1952 over his overt satire of [[Joseph McCarthy|Senator Joe McCarthy]], caricatured in his comic strip as "Simple J. Malarky". [[Garry Trudeau]], whose [[comic strip]] ''[[Doonesbury]]'' focuses on satire of the political system, and provides a trademark cynical view on national events. Trudeau exemplifies humour mixed with criticism. For example, the character [[Mark Slackmeyer]] lamented that because he was not legally married to his partner, he was deprived of the "exquisite agony" of experiencing a nasty and painful divorce like heterosexuals. This, of course, satirized the claim that gay unions would denigrate the sanctity of heterosexual marriage.

[[File:2014- 02 - Obama and Putin, by Ranan Lurie.png|thumb|upright=0.9|Political satire by [[Ranan Lurie]]]]
Like some literary predecessors, many recent television satires contain strong elements of parody and [[caricature]]; for instance, the popular animated series ''The Simpsons'' and ''South Park'' both parody modern family and social life by taking their assumptions to the extreme; both have led to the creation of similar series. As well as the purely humorous effect of this sort of thing, they often strongly criticise various phenomena in politics, economic life, religion and many other aspects of society, and thus qualify as satirical. Due to their animated nature, these shows can easily use images of public figures and generally have greater freedom to do so than conventional shows using live actors.

[[News satire]] is also a very popular form of contemporary satire, appearing in as wide an array of formats as the news media itself: print (e.g. ''[[The Onion]]'', ''[[Canada News Network]]'', ''[[Private Eye]]''), "Not Your Homepage,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notyourhomepage.com/|title=Not Your Homepage – Check Your Morals At The Door, Come See the Internet Lore!|work=notyourhomepage.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; radio (e.g. ''[[On the Hour]]''), television (e.g. ''[[The Day Today]]'', ''[[The Daily Show]]'', ''[[Brass Eye]]'') and the web (e.g. [[Mindry.in]], The Fruit Dish, [[Scunt News]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scunt.co.uk/ |title=FRONT PAGE – Satirical News, Review, Comment &amp; Analysis |publisher=Scunt.co.uk |accessdate=August 17, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130421054837/http://www.scunt.co.uk/ |archivedate=April 21, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Faking News]], [[El Koshary Today]], The Giant Napkin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegiantnapkin.com/ |title=The Giant Napkin |publisher=Thegiantnapkin.com |accessdate=August 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unconfirmed Sources&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unconfirmedsources.com/ |title=Unconfirmedsources.com |publisher=Unconfirmedsources.com |accessdate=August 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and The ''Onion''{{'}}s website). Other satires are on the [[list of satirists and satires]]. Another internet-driven form of satire is to lampoon bad internet performers. An example of this is the [[Internet meme]] character [[Miranda Sings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Ng | first = David | url = http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2009/05/miranda-sings-colleen-ballinger-jim-caruso-cast-party-jersey-boys-daniel-reichard.html | title = YouTube sensation Miranda seduces Broadway | journal = Los Angeles Times | date = May 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/10/04/PKGE19REP8.DTL | title = This Week | journal = San Francisco Chronicle | date = October 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''[[Wikinews]]'', Sean Mills, President of ''[[The Onion]]'', said angry letters about their news parody always carried the same message. "It's whatever affects that person", said Mills. "So it's like, 'I love it when you make a joke about murder or rape, but if you talk about cancer, well my brother has cancer and that's not funny to me.' Or someone else can say, 'Cancer's ''hilarious'', but don't talk about rape because my cousin got raped.' Those are rather extreme examples, but if it affects somebody personally, they tend to be more sensitive about it."&lt;ref name=DS&gt;[[n:The Onion: An interview with 'America's Finest News Source'|An interview with The Onion]], David Shankbone, ''[[Wikinews]]'', November 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Zhou Libo (comedian)|Zhou Libo]], a comedian from [[Shanghai]], is the most popular satirist in China. His humour has interested middle-class people and has sold out shows ever since his rise to fame.

==Techniques==
Literary satire is usually written out of earlier satiric works, [[Reprise#In literature|reprising]] previous conventions, commonplaces, stance, situations and tones of voice.&lt;ref name="Griffin1994p136"&gt;Griffin, Dustin H. (1994) ''Satire: A Critical Reintroduction'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=MLM2edymLtUC&amp;pg=PA136 p.136]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Exaggeration]] is one of the most common satirical techniques.&lt;ref name="Claridge2010p257"&gt;Claridge, Claudia (2010) ''Hyperbole in English: A Corpus-based Study of Exaggeration'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=aegq_QdX6h8C&amp;pg=PA257 p.257]&lt;/ref&gt; Contrarily [[Diminution (satire)|diminution]] is also a satirical technique.

==Legal status==
For its nature and social role, satire has enjoyed in many societies a special freedom license to mock prominent individuals and institutions.&lt;ref name="Test1991p9licencequote"/&gt; In Germany&lt;ref name="Geisler2005p73"/&gt; and Italy&lt;ref name="Bevere2006p265"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pezzella2009p566"/&gt; satire is protected by the constitution.

Since satire belongs to the realm of [[art]] and artistic expression, it benefits from broader lawfulness limits than mere [[freedom of information]] of journalistic kind.&lt;ref name="Pezzella2009p566"/&gt; In some countries a specific "right to satire" is recognized and its limits go beyond the "right to report" of journalism and even the "right to criticize".&lt;ref name="Pezzella2009p566"/&gt; Satire benefits not only of the protection to [[freedom of speech]], but also to that to [[culture]], and that to scientific and artistic production.&lt;ref name="Bevere2006p265"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pezzella2009p566"/&gt;

=== Australia ===
{{Main|The Juice Media#Controversy}}
In September 2017 [[The Juice Media]] received an e-mail from the Australian National Symbols Officer requesting that the use of a satirical logo, called the "Coat of Harms" based on the [[Coat of arms of Australia|Australian Coat of Arms]], no longer be used as they had received complaints from the members of the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/thejuicemedia/status/906104236789841920/photo/1|title=theJuice on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2018-06-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Coincidentally 5 days later a Bill was proposed to [[Parliament of Australia|Australian parliament]] to amend the [[Criminal law of Australia|Criminal Code Act 1995]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_LEGislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r5973|title=Criminal Code Amendment (Impersonating a Commonwealth Body) Bill 2017|last=corporateName=Commonwealth Parliament; address=Parliament House|first=Canberra|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; If successfully passed those found to be in breach of the new amendment can face 2–5 years imprisonment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:%22legislation/billsdgs/5767580%22|title=ParlInfo - Criminal Code Amendment (Impersonating a Commonwealth Body) Bill 2017|website=parlinfo.aph.gov.au|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of June 2018, the Criminal Code Amendment (Impersonating a Commonwealth Body) Bill 2017 was before the [[Australian Senate]] with the [[Reading (legislature)|third reading]] moved 10 May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_LEGislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r5973#|title=Criminal Code Amendment (Impersonating a Commonwealth Body) Bill 2017|last=corporateName=Commonwealth Parliament; address=Parliament House|first=Canberra|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Censorship and criticism==
Descriptions of satire's biting effect on its target include 'venomous', 'cutting', 'stinging',&lt;ref name="Kinservik2002p21"&gt;Kinservik, Matthew J. (2002) ''Disciplining Satire: The Censorship of Satiric Comedy on the Eighteenth...'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=haUcp4-01DMC&amp;pg=PA21 p.21]&lt;/ref&gt; vitriol. Because satire often combines anger and humor, as well as the fact that it addresses and calls into question many controversial issues, it can be profoundly disturbing.

===Typical arguments===
Because it is essentially ironic or sarcastic, satire is often misunderstood. A typical misunderstanding is to confuse the satirist with his [[persona]].&lt;ref name="Test1991p10"/&gt;

====Bad taste====
Common uncomprehending responses to satire include revulsion (accusations of [[Taste (sociology)|poor taste]], or that "it's just not funny" for instance) and the idea that the satirist actually does support the ideas, policies, or people he is attacking. For instance, at the time of its publication, many people misunderstood Swift's purpose in ''[[A Modest Proposal]]'', assuming it to be a serious recommendation of economically motivated cannibalism.

====Targeting the victim====
Some critics of [[Mark Twain]] see [[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (novel)|''Huckleberry Finn'']] as [[racist]] and offensive, missing the point that its author clearly intended it to be satire (racism being in fact only one of a number of Mark Twain's known concerns attacked in ''Huckleberry Finn'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Leonard | first1 = James S | first2 = Thomas A | last2 = Tenney | first3 = Thadious M | last3 = Davis | title = Satire or Evasion?: Black Perspectives on Huckleberry Finn | publisher = [[Duke University Press]] |date=December 1992 | page = 224 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=fdrBtpSSCisC&amp;pg=RA1-PA116&amp;lpg=RA1-PA116&amp;dq=hemingway+%22huckleberry+finn%22+%22green+hills%22 | isbn = 978-0-8223-1174-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Shelley Fisher | last = Fishin | title = Lighting out for the Territory: Reflections on Mark Twain and American Culture | place = New York | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; This same misconception was suffered by the main character of the 1960s British television comedy satire ''[[Till Death Us Do Part]]''. The character of [[Alf Garnett]] (played by [[Warren Mitchell]]) was created to poke fun at the kind of narrow-minded, racist, [[little Englander]] that Garnett represented. Instead, his character became a sort of [[anti-hero]] to people who actually agreed with his views. (The same situation occurred with [[Archie Bunker]] in American TV show ''[[All in the Family]]'', a character derived directly from Garnett.)

The Australian satirical television comedy show ''[[The Chaser's War on Everything]]'' has suffered repeated attacks based on various perceived interpretations of the "target" of its attacks. The "Make a Realistic Wish Foundation" sketch (June 2009), which attacked in classical satiric fashion the heartlessness of people who are reluctant to donate to [[Charitable organization|charities]], was widely interpreted as an attack on the [[Make a Wish Foundation]], or even the terminally ill children helped by that organisation. [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] of the time [[Kevin Rudd]] stated that The Chaser team "should hang their heads in shame". He went on to say that "I didn't see that but it's been described to me. ...But having a go at kids with a terminal illness is really beyond the pale, absolutely beyond the pale."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/06/04/2589532.htm |title='Hang your heads' Rudd tells Chaser boys | publisher = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=June 4, 2009|accessdate=June 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Television station management suspended the show for two weeks and reduced the third season to eight episodes.

====Romantic prejudice====
The romantic prejudice against satire is the belief spread by the [[Romanticism|romantic movement]] that satire is something unworthy of serious attention; this prejudice has held considerable influence to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Sutherland | first = James | year = 1958 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4kc4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1 | title = English Satire}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such prejudice extends to humour and everything that arouses laughter, which are often underestimated as frivolous and unworthy of serious study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Rod A | last = Martin | year = 2007 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ieAcp2Z_zkIC&amp;pg=PA27 | title = The Psychology of Humor: An Integrative Approach | pages = 27–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, humor is generally neglected as a topic of anthropological research and teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Apte | first = Mahadev L | year = 1985 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4fuAAAAAMAAJ | title = Humor and laughter: an anthropological approach | chapter = Introduction | page = 23 | quote = The general neglect of humor as a topic of anthropological research is reflected in teaching practice. Most introductory textbooks do not even list humor as a significant characteristic of cultural systems together with kinship, social roles, behavioral patterns, religion, language, economic transactions, political institutions, values, and material culture.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of opposition toward notable satires===
[[File:Emergency Twitter Was Down.jpg|thumb|right|Satire on [[internet culture]]]]
Because satire criticises in an ironic, essentially indirect way, it frequently escapes [[censorship]] in a way more direct criticism might not. Periodically, however, it runs into serious opposition, and people in power who perceive themselves as attacked attempt to censor it or prosecute its practitioners. In a classic example, [[Aristophanes]] was persecuted by the [[demagogue]] [[Cleon]].

====1599 book ban====
In 1599, the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[John Whitgift]] and the [[Bishop of London]] [[Richard Bancroft]], whose offices had the function of licensing books for publication in [[England]], issued a decree banning verse satire. The decree, now known as the [[Bishops' Ban of 1599]], ordered the burning of certain volumes of satire by [[John Marston (poet)|John Marston]], [[Thomas Middleton]], [[Joseph Hall (bishop)|Joseph Hall]], and others; it also required histories and plays to be specially approved by a member of the Queen's [[Privy Council]], and it prohibited the future printing of satire in verse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = A Transcript of the Registers of the Company of Stationers of London, 1554–1640 | volume = III | editor-first = Edward | editor-last = Arber | place = London | year = 1875–94 | page = 677}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The motives for the ban are obscure, particularly since some of the books banned had been licensed by the same authorities less than a year earlier. Various scholars have argued that the target was obscenity, libel, or sedition. It seems likely that lingering anxiety about the [[Martin Marprelate]] controversy, in which the bishops themselves had employed satirists, played a role; both [[Thomas Nashe]] and [[Gabriel Harvey]], two of the key figures in that controversy, suffered a complete ban on all their works. In the event, though, the ban was little enforced, even by the licensing authority itself.

====21st-century polemics====
In 2005, the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy]] caused global protests by offended Muslims and violent attacks with many [[wikt:fatality|fatalities]] in the [[Near East]]. It was not the first case of [[Muslim]] protests against criticism in the form of satire, but the Western world was surprised by the hostility of the reaction: Any country's flag in which a newspaper chose to publish the parodies was being burnt in a Near East country, then embassies were attacked, killing 139 people in mainly four countries; politicians throughout Europe agreed that satire was an aspect of the [[freedom of speech]], and therefore to be a protected means of dialogue. Iran threatened to start an [[International Holocaust Cartoon Competition]], which was immediately responded to by Jews with an [[Israeli Anti-Semitic Cartoons Contest]].

In 2006 British comedian [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] released ''[[Borat|Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan]]'', a "[[mockumentary]]" that satirized everyone, from high society to frat boys. The film was criticized by many. Although Baron Cohen is Jewish, some complained that it was [[antisemitism|antisemitic]], and the government of [[Kazakhstan]] boycotted the film. The film itself had been a reaction to a longer quarrel between the government and the comedian.

In 2008, popular South African cartoonist and satirist [[Jonathan Shapiro]] (who is published under the pen name Zapiro) came under fire for depicting then-president of the [[African National Congress|ANC]] [[Jacob Zuma]] in the act of undressing in preparation for the implied rape of 'Lady Justice' which is held down by Zuma loyalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.mg.co.za/article/2008-12-18-zuma-claims-r7m-over-zapiro-cartoon| work = Mail and Guardian | date = December 18, 2008 | location = [[South Africa|ZA]] | title= Zuma claims R7m over Zapiro cartoon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cartoon was drawn in response to Zuma's efforts to duck corruption charges, and the controversy was heightened by the fact that Zuma was himself acquitted of [[Jacob Zuma rape trial|rape]] in May 2006. In February 2009, the [[SABC|South African Broadcasting Corporation]], viewed by some opposition parties as the mouthpiece of the governing ANC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=248529&amp;area=/breaking_news/breaking_news__national/ | work = Mail and Guardian | format = interview | title = Democratic Alliance spokesperson Helen Zille| accessdate = August 2005 | location = ZA}}&lt;/ref&gt; shelved a satirical TV show created by Shapiro,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dispatch.co.za/article.aspx?id=308632 |work=Dispatch |location=ZA |title=ZNews: Zapiro's puppet show |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326004224/http://www.dispatch.co.za/article.aspx?id=308632 |archivedate=March 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in May 2009 the broadcaster pulled a documentary about political satire (featuring Shapiro among others) for the second time, hours before scheduled broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2009-05-26-sabc-pulls-zapiro-doccie-again| work = Mail and Guardian | date = September 26, 2009 | location = ZA | title=SABC pulls Zapiro doccie, again}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Apartheid South Africa]] also had a long history of censorship.

On April 29, 2015, the [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP) requested [[Kent Police]] investigate the [[BBC]], claiming that comments made about Party leader [[Nigel Farage]] by a panelist on the comedy show ''[[Have I Got News For You]]'' might hinder his chances of success in the general election (which would take place a week later), and claimed the BBC breached the Representation of the People Act.&lt;ref name="UKIP"/&gt; Kent Police rebuffed the request to open an investigation, and the BBC released a statement, "Britain has a proud tradition of satire, and everyone knows that the contributors on ''Have I Got News for You'' regularly make jokes at the expense of politicians of all parties."&lt;ref name="UKIP"&gt;[http://www.itv.com/news/2015-04-29/ukip-asks-police-to-investigate-the-bbc-over-have-i-got-news-for-you/ "Ukip asks police to investigate the BBC over Have I Got News for You"].

* The 1784 presaging of modern [[daylight saving time]], later actually proposed in 1907. While an American envoy to France, [[Benjamin Franklin]] anonymously published a letter in 1784 suggesting that [[Paris]]ians economise on candles by arising earlier to use morning sunlight.&lt;ref name='Franklin'&gt;{{cite journal|author-link = Benjamin Franklin | first = Benjamin | last = Franklin |title=Aux auteurs du Journal|journal=[[Journal de Paris]]|date=April 26, 1784|issue= 117|language = French}}  Wrote [[anonymously]].

*In the 1920s, an English [[cartoonist]] imagined a laughable thing for the time: a hotel for cars. He drew a [[multi-story car park]].&lt;ref name="LuttazziProphetic" /&gt;
*The second episode of ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'', which debuted in 1969, featured a ''[[Sketch comedy|skit]]'' entitled "[[The Mouse Problem]]" (meant to satirize contemporary media exposés on homosexuality), which depicted a cultural phenomenon eerily similar to modern [[furry fandom]] (which did not become widespread until the 1980s, over a decade after the skit was first aired).
* The comedy film ''[[Americathon]]'', released in 1979 and set in the United States of 1998, predicted a number of trends and events that would eventually unfold in the near future, including an American debt crisis, Chinese [[capitalism]], the fall of the [[Soviet Union]], [[terrorism]] aimed at the civilian population, a presidential sex scandal, and the popularity of [[reality shows]].
*In January 2001, a satirical news article in ''[[The Onion]]'', entitled "Our Long National Nightmare of Peace and Prosperity Is Finally Over"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theonion.com/content/node/28784 |title=Bush: 'Our Long National Nightmare of Peace And Prosperity Is Finally Over' | publisher= The Onion |accessdate= June 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; had newly elected President George Bush vowing to "develop new and expensive weapons technologies" and to "engage in at least one Gulf War-level armed conflict in the next four years". Furthermore, he would "bring back economic stagnation by implementing substantial tax cuts, which would lead to a recession". This prophesied the [[Iraq War]] and to the [[Bush tax cuts]].
*In 1975, the first episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' included an ad for a triple blade razor called the Triple-Trac; in 2001, [[Gillette (brand)|Gillette]] introduced the Mach3. In 2004, ''[[The Onion]]'' satirized [[Schick (razors)|Schick]] and Gillette's marketing of ever-increasingly multi-blade razors with a mock article proclaiming Gillette will now introduce a five-blade razor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theonion.com/content/node/33930 |title=Fuck Everything, We're Doing Five Blades |publisher=The Onion |accessdate=June 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Gillette released the [[Gillette Fusion]], a five-blade razor.
*After the [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|Iran nuclear deal]] in 2015, ''[[The Onion]]'' ran an article with the headline "U.S. Soothes Upset Netanyahu With Shipment Of Ballistic Missiles". Sure enough, reports broke the next day of the Obama administration offering military upgrades to Israel in the wake of the deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.666977 |title=Where Satire Meets Truth: Did The Onion Just Predict a Real Israeli Headline? |publisher=Haaretz |accessdate=January 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In July 2016, ''[[The Simpsons]]'' released the most recent in a string of satirical references to a potential ''[[Donald Trump]]'' presidency. Other media sources, including the popular film ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'' have also made similar satirical references.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/10/simpsons-predicted-president-trump-back-to-the-future |title=Back to the future: how the Simpsons and others predicted President Trump |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=February 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Satire rose the daunting question of what role public opinion would play in government.

Government officials cracked down on their humorous public criticism that challenged state authority through both its form and content. Satire had been a political resource in France for a long time, but the anxious political context of the July Monarchy had unlocked its political power.
Satire also taught lessons in democracy. It fit into the July Monarchy's tense political context as a voice in favor of public political debate. Satiric expression took place in the public sphere and spoke from a position of public opinion-that is, from a position of the nation’s expressing a political voice and making claims on its government representatives and leadership. Beyond mere entertainment, satire's humor appealed to and exercised public opinion, drawing audiences into new practices of representative government.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Schallanalyse''' (pronounced {{IPA-de|ˈʃal anaˈlyzə|}}), "sound analysis,") was a method of [[poetic]] analysis developed by the renowned [[philologist]] [[Eduard Sievers]], and described in detail in his book ''Ziele und Wege der Schallanalyse'' (1924). Sievers had previously developed a system of [[Sievers' Theory of Anglo-Saxon Meter|"five types"]] to describe the rhythmic patterns found in [[Old English language|Old English]] and [[Old Saxon language|Old Saxon]] poetry, which had met with widespread acceptance. He then abandoned the five types in favor of his new model. ''Schallanalyse'', however, proved difficult to understand for even the most intelligent people in his field and had very few adherents, usually people who worked with Sievers personally.

{{Internet}}

The '''sociology of the Internet''' involves the application of sociological theory and method to the [[Internet]] as a source of information and communication. [[Sociologists]] are concerned with the social implications of the technology; new [[social networks]], [[Virtual community|virtual communities]] and ways of [[Social interaction|interaction]] that have arisen, as well as issues related to [[cyber crime]].

The Internet—[[History of communication|the newest]] in a series of major [[Information revolution|information breakthroughs]]—is of interest for sociologists in various ways: as a tool for [[social research|research]], for example, in using [[online]] [[questionnaires]] instead of paper ones, as a discussion platform, and as a research topic. The [[sociology]] of the Internet in the stricter sense concerns the analysis of [[online communities]] (e.g. as found in [[newsgroups]]), [[virtual communities]] and [[Virtual World|virtual worlds]], organizational change catalyzed through [[new media]] such as the Internet, and social change at-large in the transformation from [[Industrial society|industrial]] to [[informational society]] (or to [[information society]]). Online communities can be studied statistically through [[Social network#Social network analysis|network analysis]] and at the same time interpreted qualitatively, such as through [[virtual ethnography]]. Social change can be studied through statistical [[demographics]] or through the interpretation of changing messages and symbols in online [[media studies]].

==Emergence of the discipline==
The Internet is a relatively new phenomenon. As [[Robert Darnton]] wrote, it is a revolutionary change that "took place yesterday, or the day before, depending on how you measure it."&lt;ref name="Darnton"&gt;Robert Darnton, ''[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/21514 The Library in the New Age]'', The New York Review of Books, Volume 55, Number 10. June 12, 2008. Retrieved on 22 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The Internet developed from the [[ARPANET]], dating back to 1969; as a term it was coined in 1974. The [[World Wide Web]] as we know it was shaped in the mid-1990s, when [[graphical interface]] and services like [[email]] became popular and reached wider (non-scientific and non-military) audiences and [[commerce]].&lt;ref name="Darnton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DiMaggio"&gt;Paul DiMaggio, Eszter Hargittai, W. Russell Neuman, and John P. Robinson, ''Social Implications of the Internet'', Annual Review of Sociology, Vol. 27: 307-336 (Volume publication date August 2001), {{doi|10.1146/annurev.soc.27.1.307}} [http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.soc.27.1.307]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Internet Explorer]] was first released in 1995; [[Netscape]] a year earlier. [[Google]] was founded in 1998.&lt;ref name="Darnton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DiMaggio"/&gt; [[Wikipedia]] was founded in 2001. [[Facebook]], [[MySpace]], and [[YouTube]] in the mid-2000s. [[Web 2.0]] is still emerging. The amount of information available on the net and the [[Global Internet usage|number of Internet users worldwide]] has continued to grow rapidly.&lt;ref name="DiMaggio"/&gt; The term '[[digital sociology]]' is now becoming increasingly used to denote new directions in sociological research into digital technologies since Web 2.0.

==Research trends==
According to DiMaggio et al. (1999),&lt;ref name="DiMaggio"/&gt; research tends to focus on the Internet's implications in five domains:
# [[Economic inequality|inequality]] (the issues of [[digital divide]])
# [[public]] and [[social capital]] (the issues of [[date displacement]])
# [[political participation]] (the issues of [[public sphere]], [[deliberative democracy]] and [[civil society]])
# [[organization]]s and other economic institutions
# [[cultural participation]] and [[cultural diversity]]

Early on, there were predictions that the Internet would change everything (or nothing); over time, however, a consensus emerged that the Internet, at least in the current phase of development, complements rather than displaces previously implemented [[Media (communication)|media]].&lt;ref name="DiMaggio"/&gt; This has meant a rethinking of the 1990s ideas of "convergence of new and old media". Further, the Internet offers a rare opportunity to study changes caused by the newly emerged - and likely, still evolving - [[information and communication technology]] (ICT).&lt;ref name="DiMaggio"/&gt;

==Social impact==
The Internet has created new forums of [[social interaction]] and [[social relations]] including [[Social network service|social networking]] websites such as [[Facebook]] and [[MySpace]] and sites such as [[meetup.com]] and [[Couchsurfing]] which facilitate offline interaction.

Though [[virtual communities]] were once thought to be composed of strictly virtual social ties, researchers often find that even those social ties formed in virtual spaces are often maintained both online and offline &lt;ref&gt;Lauren F. Sessions, "How offline gatherings affect online community members: when virtual community members ‘meetup’.""Information, Communication, and Society"13,3(April, 2010):375-395&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bo Xie, B. ‘The mutual shaping of online and offline social relationships."Information Research, 1,3(2008):n.p.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are ongoing debates about the impact of the Internet on [[strong ties|strong]] and [[weak ties]], whether the Internet is creating more or less [[social capital]],&lt;ref&gt;Lee Rainie, John Horrigan, Barry Wellman, and Jeffrey Boase. (2006)"The Strength of Internet Ties" Pew Internet and American Life Project. Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellison, N. B., Steinfield, C., &amp; Lampe, C. (2007). The benefits of Facebook "friends:" Social capital and college students' use of online social network sites. Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 12(4).&lt;/ref&gt; the Internet's role in trends towards social isolation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2009/18--Social-Isolation-and-New-Technology.aspx|title=Social Isolation and New Technology|date=4 November 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and whether it creates a more or less diverse social environment.

It is often said the Internet is a new frontier, and there is a line of argument to the effect that social interaction, cooperation and conflict among users resembles the anarchistic and violent [[American frontier]] of the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Jensen. "Military History on the Electronic Frontier: Wikipedia Fights the War of 1812," ''The Journal of Military History'' (October 2012) 76#4  pp 1165-82 [http://www.americanhistoryprojects.com/downloads/JMH1812.PDF online]&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, researchers from the [[Benedictine University at Mesa]] in [[Arizona]] studied how online interactions affect face-to-face meetings. The study is titled, "Face to Face Versus Facebook: Does Exposure to Social Networking Web Sites Augment or Attenuate Physiological Arousal Among the Socially Anxious," published in ''[[Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking]]''.&lt;ref name=Charles-Study&gt;{{cite news|last=Charles|first=Megan|title=Meeting Facebook Friends Face To Face Causes Anxiety (Study) |url=http://www.business2community.com/social-buzz/meeting-facebook-friends-face-face-causes-anxiety-study-0803603#!yTDAe|accessdate=7 March 2014|newspaper=Business 2 Community|date=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They analyzed 26 female students with electrodes to measure social anxiety. Prior to meeting people, the students were shown pictures of the subject they were expected to meet. Researchers found that meeting someone face-to-face after looking at their photos increases arousal, which the study linked to an increase in social anxiety. These findings confirm previous studies that found that socially anxious people prefer online interactions. The study also recognized that the stimulated arousal can be associated with positive emotions and could lead to positive feelings.&lt;ref name=Woollaston-Facebook&gt;{{cite news|last=Woollaston|first=Victoria|title=Is Facebook making us socially AWKWARD? Meeting face-to-face is more difficult after meeting people online|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2574879/Is-Facebook-making-socially-AWKWARD-Meeting-face-face-difficult-meeting-people-online.html|accessdate=7 March 2014|newspaper=Daily Mail|date=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research has taken the [[Internet of Things]] within its purview, as global networks of interconnected everyday objects are said to be the next step in technological advancement.&lt;ref name="AtzoriIera2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Atzori|first1=Luigi|last2=Iera|first2=Antonio|last3=Morabito|first3=Giacomo|last4=Nitti|first4=Michele|title=The Social Internet of Things (SIoT) – When social networks meet the Internet of Things: Concept, architecture and network characterization|journal=Computer Networks|volume=56|issue=16|year=2012|pages=3594–3608|issn=1389-1286|doi=10.1016/j.comnet.2012.07.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certainly, global space- and earth-based networks are expanding coverage of the IoT at a fast pace. This has a wide variety of consequences, with current applications in the health, agriculture, traffic and retail fields.&lt;ref name="MatternFloerkemeier2010" /&gt; Companies such as [[Samsung]] and [[Sigfox]] have invested heavily in said networks, and their social impact will have to be measured accordingly, with some sociologists suggesting the formation of socio-technical networks of humans and technical systems.&lt;ref name="Technology Review"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Simonite|first1=Tom|title=Silicon Valley to Get a Cellular Network, Just for Things|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/news/527376/silicon-valley-to-get-a-cellular-network-just-for-things/|website=Technology Review|publisher=Technology Review|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kranz"&gt;Kranz, Matthias, Luis Roalter, and Florian Michahelles.

Children can use technology to enhance their learning skills - for example: using online programs to improve the way they learn how to read or do math. The resources technology provides for children may enhance their skills, but children should be cautious of what they get themselves into due to how cyber bullying may occur. [[Cyber bullying]] can cause academic and psychological affects due to how children are suppressed by people who bully them through the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.688.1918&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|title= Download Limit Exceeded|website= citeseerx.ist.psu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; When technology is introduced to children they are not forced to accept it, but instead children are permitted to have an input on what they feel about either deciding to use their technological device or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first= Allison|last= Druin|authorlink=Allison Druin|date= 1999-10-02|title= The Role of Children in the Design Technology|url= https://drum.lib.umd.edu/handle/1903/1028|language= en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=September 2018}} [[Social]] exclusion in the classroom occurs to children who associate themselves more with using computers, which causes them to exclude themselves from the classroom's everyday context due to how they grow more attached to the device.

Technology can have negative impacts on the lives of children and can be an essential [[learning]] tool that can encourage cognitive, linguistic and social development. Children that use technological devices have had greater gains in problem-solving, intelligence, language skills and structural knowledge in comparison to those children who have not incorporated the use of technology in their learning.&lt;ref&gt;https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ898529.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In research conducted, "studies did find improvements in student scores on tests closely related to material covered in computer-assisted instructional packages", which demonstrates how technology can have positive influences on children by improving their learning capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED452818.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Problems have arisen between children and their parents as well when parents limit what children can use their technological devices for, specifically what they can and cannot watch on their devices, making children frustrated.&lt;ref name="komunikasi.unsoed.ac.id"&gt;

Studies have found that "the average child in this country{{which?|date=September 2018}} spends over 6 hours each day with some form of mediated communication", meaning that children spend more time with their technological device rather than spending that time with their family or friends.&lt;ref name="komunikasi.unsoed.ac.id"/&gt; The introduction of technology to children has the positive outcome of increasing a child's learning capabilities, but can have the negative outcome of affecting a child's behavior in acting more isolated from the rest of society.

===Political organization and censorship===
{{See also|Internet censorship}}

The Internet has achieved new relevance as a political tool. The presidential campaign of [[Howard Dean]] in 2004 in the [[United States]] became famous for its ability to generate donations via the Internet, and the 2008 campaign of [[Barack Obama]] became even more so. Increasingly, [[social movements]] and other organizations use the Internet to carry out both traditional and the new [[Internet activism]].

Governments are also getting online. Some countries, such as those of [[Cuba]], [[Iran]], [[North Korea]], [[Myanmar]], the [[People's Republic of China]], and [[Saudi Arabia]] use filtering and censoring software to [[Internet censorship|restrict what people in their countries can access on the Internet]]. In the [[United Kingdom]], they also use software to locate and arrest various individuals they perceive as a threat. Other countries including the United States, have enacted laws making the possession or distribution of certain material such as [[child pornography]] illegal but do not use filtering software. In some countries [[Internet service providers]] have agreed to restrict access to sites listed by police.

===Economics===
While much has been written of the economic advantages of [[Electronic commerce|Internet-enabled commerce]], there is also evidence that some aspects of the Internet such as maps and location-aware services may serve to reinforce [[economic inequality]] and the [[digital divide]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theatlanticcities.com/technology/2013/02/how-internet-reinforces-inequality-real-world/4602/ "How the Internet Reinforces Inequality in the Real World"] ''The Atlantic'' February 6, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Electronic commerce may be responsible for [[Consolidation (business)|consolidation]] and the decline of [[mom-and-pop]], [[brick and mortar]] businesses resulting in increases in [[income inequality]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zdnet.com/e-commerce-will-make-the-shopping-mall-a-retail-wasteland-7000009960/ "E-commerce will make the shopping mall a retail wasteland"] ''ZDNet'', January 17, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philanthropy===
The spread of low-cost Internet access in developing countries has opened up new possibilities for [[peer-to-peer charities]], which allow individuals to contribute small amounts to charitable projects for other individuals. Websites such as [[Donors Choose]] and [[Global Giving]] now allow small-scale donors to direct funds to individual projects of their choice.

A popular twist on Internet-based philanthropy is the use of [[peer-to-peer lending]] for charitable purposes. [[Kiva]] pioneered this concept in 2005, offering the first web-based service to publish individual loan profiles for funding. Kiva raises funds for local intermediary [[microfinance]] organizations which post stories and updates on behalf of the borrowers. Lenders can contribute as little as $25 to loans of their choice, and receive their money back as borrowers repay. Kiva falls short of being a pure peer-to-peer charity, in that loans are disbursed before being funded by lenders and borrowers do not communicate with lenders themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.cgdev.org/open_book/2009/10/kiva-is-not-quite-what-it-seems.php ''Kiva Is Not Quite What It Seems''], by David Roodman, Center for Global Development, Oct. 2, 2009, as accessed Jan. 2 &amp; 16, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/09/business/global/09kiva.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=Kiva&amp;st=cse ''Confusion on Where Money Lent via Kiva Goes''], by Stephanie Strom, in The New York Times, Nov. 8, 2009, as accessed Jan. 2 &amp; 16, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; However, the recent spread of cheap Internet access in developing countries has made genuine peer-to-peer connections increasingly feasible. In 2009 the US-based nonprofit [[Zidisha]] tapped into this trend to offer the first peer-to-peer microlending platform to link lenders and borrowers across international borders without local intermediaries. Inspired by interactive websites such as [[Facebook]] and [[eBay]], Zidisha's microlending platform facilitates direct dialogue between lenders and borrowers and a performance rating system for borrowers. Web users worldwide can fund loans for as little as a dollar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microfinancefocus.com/news/2010/02/07/zidisha-set-to-expand-in-peer-to-peer-microfinance-julia-kurnia/ "Zidisha Set to "Expand" in Peer-to-Peer Microfinance", Microfinance Focus, Feb 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008230104/http://www.microfinancefocus.com/news/2010/02/07/zidisha-set-to-expand-in-peer-to-peer-microfinance-julia-kurnia/ |date=2011-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leisure===
The Internet has been a major source of [[leisure]] since before the World Wide Web, with entertaining social experiments such as [[MUD]]s and [[MOO]]s being conducted on university servers, and humor-related [[Usenet]] groups receiving much of the main traffic. Today, many [[Internet forum]]s have sections devoted to games and funny videos; short cartoons in the form of [[Flash animation|Flash movies]] are also popular. Over 6 million people use blogs or message boards as a means of communication and for the sharing of ideas.

The [[pornography]] and [[gambling]] industries have both taken full advantage of the World Wide Web, and often provide a significant source of advertising revenue for other websites. Although governments have made attempts to censor Internet porn, Internet service providers have told governments that these plans are not feasible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chivers|first=Tom|title=Internet pornography block plans: other attempts to control the internet|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/internet/8215030/Internet-pornography-block-plans-other-attempts-to-control-the-internet.html|accessdate=24 February 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=Dec 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also many governments have attempted to put restrictions on both industries' use of the Internet, this has generally failed to stop their widespread popularity.

One area of leisure on the Internet is [[MMORPG|online gaming]]. This form of leisure creates communities, bringing people of all ages and origins to enjoy the fast-paced world of multiplayer games. These range from [[MMORPG]] to [[first-person shooter]]s, from [[role-playing video game]]s to [[online gambling]]. This has revolutionized the way many people interact and spend their free time on the Internet.

While online gaming has been around since the 1970s, modern modes of online gaming began with services such as [[GameSpy Arcade|GameSpy]] and [[MPlayer.com|MPlayer]], to which players of games would typically subscribe. Non-subscribers were limited to certain types of gameplay or certain games.

Many use the Internet to access and download music, movies and other works for their enjoyment and relaxation. As discussed above, there are paid and unpaid sources for all of these, using centralized servers and distributed peer-to-peer technologies. Discretion is needed as some of these sources take more care over the original artists' rights and over copyright laws than others.

Many use the World Wide Web to access news, weather and sports reports, to plan and book holidays and to find out more about their random ideas and casual interests.

People use [[Internet Relay Chat|chat]], [[Instant messaging|messaging]] and e-mail to make and stay in touch with friends worldwide, sometimes in the same way as some previously had [[pen pal]]s. [[Social networking]] websites like [[MySpace]], [[Facebook]] and many others like them also put and keep people in contact for their enjoyment.

The Internet has seen a growing number of [[Web desktop]]s, where users can access their files, folders, and settings via the Internet.

[[Cyberslacking]] has become a serious drain on corporate resources; the average UK employee spends 57 minutes a day surfing the Web at work, according to a study by [[Peninsula Business Services]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=914&amp;id=1001802003 Scotsman.com News - Net abuse hits small city firms]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''South African Institute for Aquatic Biodiversity''' (SAIAB), is involved in research, education and in applications of its knowledge and research to African fish fauna, for either economic or conservation benefit.

The institute was formerly named the '''JLB Smith Institute of Ichthyology''', in honour of Professor [[James Leonard Brierley Smith]], who named and described the living coelacanth ''[[Latimeria chalumnae]]''.

Situated in Grahamstown in the Eastern Cape, the South African Institute for Aquatic Biodiversity (SAIAB) is an internationally recognised centre for the study of aquatic biodiversity.

As a National Facility of the NRF SAIAB serves as a major scientific resource for knowledge and understanding the biodiversity and functioning of globally significant aquatic ecosystems. With both marine and freshwater biogeographical boundaries, southern Africa is ideally placed to monitor and document climate change.

From a '''marine''' perspective South Africa forms the southern apex of a major continental mass, flanked by very different marine ecosystems on the east and west coasts, and projecting towards the cold southern Ocean large marine ecosystem. SAIAB’s scientific leadership and expertise in '''freshwater''' aquatic biodiversity is vital to the national interest when dealing with issues arising from exponentially increasing pressures of human population growth and development.

'''Sympathetic magic''', also known as '''imitative magic''', is a type of [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] based on imitation or correspondence.

==Similarity and contagion==
It has been said that the theory of sympathetic magic was first developed by Sir [[James George Frazer]] in ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' (1889); [[Richard Andree]], however, anticipates Frazer, writing of 'Sympathie-Zauber' in his 1878 ''Ethnographische Parallelen und Vergleiche''. Frazer further subcategorised sympathetic magic into two varieties: that relying on similarity, and that relying on contact or 'contagion':
{{Quote |If we analyze the principles of thought on which magic is based, they will probably be found to resolve themselves into two: first, that like produces like, or that an effect resembles its cause; and, second, that things which have once been in contact with each other continue to act on each other at a distance after the physical contact has been severed. The former principle may be called the Law of Similarity, the latter the Law of Contact or Contagion. From the first of these principles, namely the Law of Similarity, the magician infers that he can produce any effect he desires merely by imitating it: from the second he infers that whatever he does to a material object will affect equally the person with whom the object was once in contact, whether it formed part of his body or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.gutenberg.org/files/3623/3623-h/3623-h.htm#c3section1 | publisher = Bartleby | title = The Golden Bough | year = 1922 | chapter = 3: Sympathetic Magic; Part 1: The Principles of Magic}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Imitation==
Imitation involves using [[effigies]], [[fetishes]] or [[poppet]]s to affect the environment of people, or occasionally people themselves.  [[Voodoo doll]]s are an example of fetishes used in this way. Such as using a lock of hair on the doll creating a "link" between the doll and the person the hair came from so whatever happens to the doll will also happen on the person.

==Correspondence==
[[Correspondence (theology)|Correspondence]] is based on the idea that one can influence something based on its relationship or resemblance to another thing. Many popular beliefs regarding properties of plants, fruits and vegetables have evolved in the [[traditional medicine|folk-medicine]] of different societies owing to sympathetic magic. This include beliefs that certain herbs with [[yellow]] sap can cure [[jaundice]], that [[walnut]]s could strengthen the brain because of the nuts' resemblance to brain, that [[red beet]]-juice is good for the blood, that phallic-shaped roots will cure [[male impotence]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Harrison| first = Regina | title = Signs, songs, and memory in the Andes: translating Quechua language and culture| publisher = [[University of Texas Press]]| year = 1989| page = 178| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=t6RkAAAAMAAJ | isbn = 978-0-292-77627-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many traditional societies believed that an effect on one object can cause an analogous effect on another object, without an apparent causal link between the two objects. For instance, many folktales feature a villain whose "life" exists in another object, and who can only be killed if that other object is destroyed. (Examples including [[Sauron]]'s [[One Ring]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', and the [[Russian folktale]] of [[Koschei the Deathless]]. Compare [[Horcrux]] and [[lich]].) [[Mircea Eliade]] wrote that in [[Uganda]], a [[barren woman]] is thought to cause a barren garden, and her husband can seek a divorce on purely economic grounds.&lt;ref name= " Haper &amp; Row - 1976 - A Mircea Eliade Reader - "&gt;{{cite book | author-link = Mircea Eliade | first = Mircea | last = Eliade |title=Myths, Rites, Symbols: A Mircea Eliade Reader|editor1-first =Wendell C | editor1-last = Beane | editor2-first = William G | editor2-last = Doty|publisher=[[Harper &amp; Row]]|location= [[New York City|New York]]| year=1976|page =385|isbn=978-0-06-090510-1|oclc= 2136392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many societies have been documeted as believing that, instead of requiring an image of an individual, influence can be exerted using something that they have touched or used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|title=Rehabilitation interventions: Ideas based on a South Pacific example|author-last=Gregory|author-first=R. J.| journal=Disability and Rehabilitation|volume=18|issue=1|date=1996|doi=10.3109/09638289609167089|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the inhabitants of [[Tanna (island)|Tanna, Vanuatu]] in the 1970s were cautious when throwing away food or losing a fingernail, as they believed these small scraps of personal items could be used to cast a spell causing fevers. Similarly, an 18th-century compendium of Russian [[Folk Orthodoxy|folk magic]] describes how someone could be influenced through sprinkling cursed salt on a path frequently used by the victim,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Witchcraft and Medicine in Pre-Petrine Russia|author-last=Zguta|author-first=Russell|journal=The Russian Review|volume=37|issue=4|date=1978|p=446|jstor=128509}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a 15th-century [[Hwi-bin Kim|crown princess of Joseon Korea]] is recorded as having cut her husband's lovers' shoes into pieces and burnt them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=世宗實錄 |trans-title=[[Veritable Records of the Joseon Dynasty|Veritable Records of Sejong]]|date=1454|url=http://sillok.history.go.kr/search/inspectionMonthList.do?id=kda|volume=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hypotheses about prehistoric sympathetic magic==
The term is most commonly used in [[archaeology]] in relation to [[Paleolithic]] [[cave painting]]s such as those in [[North Africa]] and at [[Lascaux]] in [[France]].  The theory is one of prehistoric human behavior, and is based on studies of more modern [[hunter-gatherer]] societies. The idea is that the paintings were made by [[Cro-Magnon]] [[Shamanism|shaman]]s. The shamans would retreat into the darkness of the caves, enter into a [[trance]] state and then paint images of their visions, perhaps with some notion of drawing power out of the cave walls themselves. This goes some way towards explaining the remoteness of some of the paintings (which often occur in deep or small caves) and the variety of subject matter (from prey animals to [[predator]]s and human hand-prints). In his book ''Primitive Mythology'', [[Joseph Campbell]] stated that the paintings "...were associated with the magic of the hunt." For him, this sympathetic magic was akin to a ''[[participation mystique]]'', where the paintings, drawn in a sanctuary of "timeless principle", were acted upon by rite.

In 1933, [[Leo Frobenius]], discussing [[Cave painting#Africa|cave paintings in North Africa]], pointed out that many of the paintings did not seem to be mere depictions of animals and people. To him, it seemed as if they were acting out a hunt before it began, perhaps as a consecration of the animal to be killed. In this way, the pictures served to secure a successful hunt. While others interpreted the cave images as depictions of hunting accidents or of ceremonies, Frobenius believed it was much more likely that "...what was undertaken [in the paintings] was a consecration of the animal effected not through any real confrontation of man and beast but by a depiction of a concept of the mind."

In 2005, Francis Thackeray published a paper in the journal Antiquity, in which he recognised that there was a strong case for the principle of sympathetic magic in southern Africa in prehistory.  For example, a rock engraving from Wonderwerk Cave in South Africa (dated at 4000 years before the present, BP) showed a zebra which had probably been "symbolically wounded", with incisions on the rump being associated with wounds.  Ochre on the engraved slab could represent blood. A prehistoric rock painting at Melikane in Lesotho shows what appear to be men (shamans) bending forward like animals, with two sticks to represent the front legs of an antelope.  Thackeray suggests that these men, perhaps shamans or "medicine-men" dressed under animal skins, were associated with hunting rituals of the kind recorded by H. Lichtenstein in 1812 in South Africa, in which a hunter simulated an antelope which was symbolically killed by other hunters, in the belief that this was essential for a successful hunt.  Such rituals could be represented in prehistoric art such as paintings at Melikane in Lesotho.  Thackeray suggests that the Melikane therianthropes are associated with both trance and the principle of sympathetic hunting magic  In 2005, in the journal Antiquity, Francis Thackeray suggests that there is even a photograph of such rituals, recorded in 1934 at Logageng in the southern Kalahari, South Africa. Such rituals may have been closely associated with both roan antelope and eland, and other animals.

In the Brandberg in Namibia, in the so-called "White Lady" panel recorded by the Abbe Henri Breuil and Harald Pager, there are "symbolic wounds" on the belly of a gemsbok-like therianthrope (catalogued as T1), which might relate to the principle of sympathetic hunting magic and trance, as suggested by Thackeray in 2013.

At the Apollo 11 cave in Namibia, Erich Wendt discovered mobile art about 30,000 years old, including a stone broken in two pieces, with a gemsbok-like therianthrope that closely resembles the Brandberg therianthrope which Thackeray catalogues as T1.   Both examples of art may be related to sympathetic hunting magic and shamanism.

In 2013 Thackeray emphasised that in southern Africa, the principle of sympathetic hunting magic and shamanism (trance) were not mutually exclusive.

However, as with all [[prehistory]], it is impossible to be certain due to the limited evidence and the many pitfalls associated with trying to understand the prehistoric mindset with a modern [[Mind#Evolutionary history of the human mind|mind]].

==Popular culture==
The concept of sympathetic magic features prominently in the [[The Kingkiller Chronicle|Kingkiller Chronicle]] novel series by [[Patrick Rothfuss]].

Merricat Blackwood in [[Shirley Jackson]]'s ''[[We Have Always Lived in the Castle]]'' is a practitioner of sympathetic magic.

In [[Rick Riordan]]'s ''[[The Kane Chronicles]]'', sympathetic magic is practiced prominently.

The music duo Charming Disaster has a song called "Sympathetic Magic". A duet between the magic user and her target.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://charmingdisaster.bandcamp.com/track/sympathetic-magic|title=Sympathetic magic lyrics|last=|first=|date=|website=Bandcamp.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8662">{{About|the western rhythmic syllable system|the spoken component of South Indian solkattu|Konnakol}}

'''Takadimi''' is a system devised by Richard Hoffman, William Pelto, and John W. White in 1996 in order to teach rhythm skills. Takadimi, while utilizing rhythmic symbols borrowed from classical [[South India]]n [[carnatic music]], differentiates itself from this method by focusing the syllables on meter and on western tonal rhythm. Takadimi is based on the use of specific syllables at certain places within a beat.&lt;ref name="Richard Hoffman"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hoffman|first=Richard|author2=William Pelto |author3=John. W. White |title=Takadimi: A Beat-Oriented System of Rhythm Pedagogy|journal=Journal of Music Theory Pedagogy|year=1996|volume=10|pages=7–30|url=http://www.sudburydrums.com/uploads/5/8/0/1/5801637/takadimiarticle.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Takadimi is used in classrooms from elementary level up through the collegiate level, and it meets National Content Standard 5 by teaching both reading and notating music.&lt;ref name="Music Educators Journal"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ester|first=Don P.|author2=John W. Scheib |author3=Kimberly J. Inks |title=Takadimi: A Rhythm System for all Ages|journal=Music Educators Journal|date=November 2006|volume=93|pages=60–65|jstor=3878473}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
Takadimi is similar to the [[Kodály Method]], developed in 1935 in [[Hungary]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://digital.library.unt.edu/permalink/meta-dc-4218:1 University of North Texas Digital Library]&lt;/ref&gt;
Both systems can be traced back to the 19th century French Time-Names system.&lt;ref name="Richard Hoffman" /&gt;  Hoffman, Pelto, and White developed the system with certain goals in mind. As stated by the developers themselves:
#It should lead to accuracy and musicality in performance, both studies and sight-read, including the ability to recognize and perform musical gesture.
#It should require and reflect an understanding of rhythmic structure, recognition of metric and rhythmic interaction, and an awareness of precise contextual location of beats and attack points.
#It should facilitate aural recognition and identification of rhythmic patterns and metric divisions.
#It should provide a precise and consistent language for the discussion of temporal phenomena. There should be no need to create new terms or separate categories for performance, transcription, or analytical work.
#It should address rhythmic issues presented by music outside the realm of traditional tonal literature such as asymmetric meters, modulation of meter or tempo, complex syncopations, complex tuplet groupings, and passages that combine these in novel and challenging ways.
#Like pitch solfège, it should be a system that is easily applied and adapts to broad applications, and it should be a tool for lifelong use.&lt;ref name="Richard Hoffman" /&gt;
Hoffman, Pelto, and White believe that they took the best from many existing systems and tweaked them together to form this system that best meets the goals they set for themselves. Of the systems they used as either inspiration or examples of unwanted attributes, three are mentioned in the journal where they first proposed their system in 1996: The [[Kodály Method]], the McHose/Tibbs system, and Edwin Gordon's system.&lt;ref name="Richard Hoffman" /&gt;

==How it works==

The Takadimi system teaches students to read rhythm in a way similar to the way a language would be taught,&lt;ref name="Progressive Sight Singing"&gt;{{cite book|last=Krueger|first=Carol|title=Progressive Sight Singing|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; rooted in [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi|Pestalozzian]] theory formalized by [[Robert M. Gagné]] and applied in Edwin Gordon's [[Gordon Music Learning Theory#Skill Learning Sequences|skill learning sequences]].&lt;ref name="Music Educators Journal"/&gt; Students learn first to recognize and repeat rhythms before they learn to associate those rhythms with standard musical notation and begin reading and writing music. The system has a basis of two related sets of syllables, one for simple meter and one for compound meter. In both meters, syllables are assigned to certain positions within the beat as opposed to the syllables being assigned to certain notational values.This allows for rhythms that sound the same to be pronounced the same, even when the notation differs. Such notational differences that commonly result in rhythms that sound the same often occur between 2/4 and 2/2 time signatures. Also, each subdivision has unique syllables, so a note in a certain place within the beat always has the same syllable.&lt;ref name="Richard Hoffman" /&gt; 
[[File:Takadimi Syllables.png|thumb|right|Divisions of Takadimi Syllables]]

===Simple meter===
In simple meter, the attack on the beat is called ‘ta,’ and an attack on the second half of the beat is always called ‘di.’ When the beat is divided further into fourths, pronunciation of each fourth would be ‘ta ka di mi.’&lt;ref name=Takadimi.net&gt;{{cite web|last=Hoffman|first=Richard|title=Learning Rhythm with the Takadimi System of Rhythm Solfege|url=http://www.takadimi.net/documents/Takadimi%20short%20guide%20for%20Web.pdf|accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compound meter===
In compound meter, as in simple meter, the attack on the beat is called ‘ta.’ The first division into thirds is pronounced ‘ta ki da.’ The subdivision into sixths is pronounced ‘ta va ki di da ma.’&lt;ref name=Takadimi.net /&gt;

===Both meters===
In both meters, ‘ta’ always begins a beat and ‘di’ always marks the middle of the beat, simplifying switching between the two. Also, in order to allow the system to expand to more unusual time signatures, a syllable ‘ti’ may be added to the end of the subdivision. A quintuplet in simple meter, for example, would be pronounced ‘ta ka di mi ti,’ and a septuplet in compound meter would be pronounced ‘ta va ki di da ma ti.’&lt;ref name="Richard Hoffman" /&gt;

==Comparison to other systems==

===Kodály Method===
The system developed by Hungarian composer [[Zoltán Kodály]] differs from Takadimi in that is ascribes syllables to specific notational values, regardless of their placement within the beat.  Sets of syllables are also assigned to specific rhythmic patterns. For example, an eighth note is called ‘ti’ whether it is on the attack of the beat or in the middle. It is also called ‘ti’ regardless of the meter.&lt;ref name="Richard Hoffman" /&gt;  This method was intended for use at the elementary level,&lt;ref name="The Kodaly Approach"&gt;{{cite web|last=Trinka|first=Jill|title=The Kodaly Approach|url=http://www.allianceamm.org/resources_elem_Kodaly.html|accessdate=3 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219100225/http://www.allianceamm.org/resources_elem_Kodaly.html|archivedate=19 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many critics say that it is not expandable to upper level classrooms. Philip Tacka and Michael Houlahan, experts who have studied [[Kodály]] at [[Millersville University]], have stated that “the Takadimi rhythm system solves the problems associated with the [[Kodály]] rhythm syllables. We believe that were [[Kodály]] alive today, he would certainly encourage his students and colleagues to use the Takadimi system.”&lt;ref name="Music Educators Journal" /&gt;  Lois Chosky has proposed modifications to this method that provide for further subdivisions of syllables in The Kodály Context: Creating an Environment for Musical Learning.&lt;ref name=Chosky&gt;{{cite book|last=Chosky|first=Lois|title=The Kodály Context: Creating an Environment for Musical Learning|year=1981|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs|pages=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===McHose/Tibbs===
Allen McHose and Ruth Tibbs developed a system that is based on counting within the measure. For example, ‘one’ is said on the attack of beat one, ‘two’ is said on the attack of beat two and so on. This system also ascribes syllables to certain notational values, but the syllables are not unique to certain attack points as in the Takadimi system.  Hoffman believes that this system requires a formal understanding of musical notation before it can become useful.&lt;ref name="Richard Hoffman" /&gt;

===Edwin Gordon===
[[Gordon music learning theory|Edwin Gordon]] has developed a system similar to the McHose/Tibbs system above. It is similar in that it also assigns syllables based on beat orientation. However, these syllables are meter-dependent. For example, 3 eighth notes in 6/8 are pronounced ‘du-da-di’ whereas in 7/8 they are pronounced ‘du-ba-bi.’&lt;ref name="Richard Hoffman" /&gt;

{{refimprove|date=November 2013}}

[[File:Benfleet Sewage Treatment Plant, Filter Bed - geograph.org.uk - 1450096.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.36|A trickling filter plant in the [[United Kingdom]]: The effluent from the primary settling tanks is sprayed onto a bed of coarse gravel (Benfleet Sewage Treatment Plant)]]

A '''trickling filter''' is a type of [[wastewater treatment]] system. It consists of a fixed bed of [[Rock (geology)|rock]]s, [[coke (fuel)|coke]], [[gravel]], [[slag]], [[polyurethane]] [[foam]], sphagnum [[peat moss]], [[porous media|ceramic]], or plastic media over which [[sewage]] or other [[wastewater]] flows  downward and causes a layer of [[microbial]] slime ([[biofilm]]) to grow, covering the bed of media. [[Wikt:aerobic|Aerobic]] conditions are maintained by splashing, diffusion, and either by [[forced-air]] flowing through the bed or natural convection of air if the filter medium is porous.

The terms '''trickle filter''', '''trickling biofilter''', '''biofilter''', '''biological filter''' and '''biological trickling filter''' are often used to refer to a '''trickling filter'''. These systems have also been described as roughing filters, intermittent filters, packed media bed filters, alternative septic systems, percolating filters, attached growth processes, and fixed film processes.

== Process description ==
[[Image:Trickle Filter.svg|thumb|right|264px|A typical complete trickling filter system]]
[[Image:Trickle Filter Cross-section.png|thumb|right|250px|Image 1. A schematic cross-section of the contact face of the bed of media in a trickling filter]]
[[File:Collapsed trickling filter at the WWTP in Norton (6845984347).jpg|thumb|Broken trickling filter unit at the [[sewage treatment plant]] in Norton, [[Zimbabwe]], showing importance of maintenance to prevent structural failure]]
Typically, sewage flow enters at a high level and flows through the primary settlement tank. The supernatant from the tank flows into a dosing device, often a tipping bucket which delivers flow to the arms of the filter. The flush of water flows through the arms and exits through a series of holes pointing at an angle downwards. This propels the arms around distributing the liquid evenly over the surface of the filter media.
Most are uncovered (unlike the accompanying diagram) and are freely ventilated to the atmosphere.

The removal of [[pollution|pollutants]] from the waste water stream involves both [[absorption (chemistry)|absorption]] and [[adsorption]] of [[organic compounds]]  and some inorganic species such as [[nitrite]] and [[nitrate]] ions by the layer of microbial [[bio film]].  The filter media is typically chosen to provide a very high surface area to volume. Typical materials are often porous and have considerable internal surface area in addition to the external surface of the medium.  Passage of the waste water over the media provides dissolved [[oxygen]] which the bio-film layer requires for the [[biochemical]] [[oxidation]] of the organic compounds and releases [[carbon dioxide]] gas, water and other oxidized end products. As the bio film layer thickens, it  eventually sloughs off  into the liquid flow and subsequently forms part of the secondary  sludge. Typically, a trickling filter is followed by a [[clarifier]] or [[sedimentation tank]] for the separation and removal of the sloughed film.  Other filters utilizing higher-density media such as sand, foam and peat moss do not produce a sludge that must be removed, but require forced air blowers and backwashing or an enclosed anaerobic environment.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

===Biofilm===
The bio-film that develops in a trickling filter may become several millimetres thick and is typically a gelatinous matrix that contains many species of [[bacterium|bacteria]], [[cilliate]]s and [[amoeba|amoeboid]] protozoa, [[annelid]]s, [[Nematode|round worm]]s and insect larvae and many other micro fauna. This is very different from many other bio-films which may be less than 1&amp;nbsp;mm thick. Within the thickness of the biofilm both aerobic and anaerobic zones can exist supporting both oxidative and reductive biological processes. At certain times of year, especially in the spring, rapid growth of organisms in the film may cause the film to be too thick and it may slough off in patches leading to the "spring slough".&lt;ref name="staffuni"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.staffs.ac.uk/schools/sciences/consultancy/dladmin/zCIWEMWWT/Activity5/act5.html|title=Municipal Wastewater Treatment Unit|publisher=Staffordshire University|access-date=19 February 2016}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design considerations==

A typical trickling filter is circular and between 10 metres and 20 metres across and between 2 metres to 3 metres deep. A circular wall, often of brick, contains a bed of filter media which in turn rests on a base of under-drains. These under-drains function both to remove liquid passing through the filter media but also to allow the free passage of air up through the filter media. Mounted in the center over the top of the filter media is a spindle supporting two or more horizontal perforated pipes which extend to the edge of the media. The perforations on the pipes are designed to allow an even flow of liquid over the whole area of the media and are also angled so that when liquid flows from the pipes the whole assembly rotates around the central spindle.&lt;ref name ="staffuni"/&gt; Settled sewage is delivered to a reservoir at the centre of the spindle via some form of dosing mechanism, often a tipping bucket device on small filters.

Larger filters may be rectangular and the distribution arms may be driven by hydraulic or electrical systems.&lt;ref name ="staffuni"/&gt;

==Types==
Single trickling filters may be used for the treatment of small residential septic tank discharges and very small rural sewage treatment systems. Larger centralized sewage treatment plants typically use many trickling filters in parallel.

Systems can be configured for single-pass use where the treated water is applied to the trickling filter once before being disposed of, or for multi-pass use where a portion of the treated water is cycled back and re-treated via a [[Feedback|closed loop]].  Multi-pass systems result in higher treatment quality and assist in removing Total Nitrogen (TN) levels by promoting [[nitrification]] in the aerobic media bed and [[denitrification]] in the anaerobic septic tank. Some systems use the filters in two banks operated in series so that the wastewater has two passes through a filter with a sedimentation stage between the two passes. Every few days the filters are switched round to balance the load. This method of treatment can improve nitrification and de-nitrification since much of the carbonaceous oxidative material is removed on the first pass through the filters.

=== Media types ===
Trickling may have a variety of types of filter media used to support the biofilm. Types of media most commonly used include [[coke (fuel)|coke]], [[pumice]], plastic matrix material, open-cell [[polyurethane]] [[foam]], clinker, gravel, [[sand]] and [[geotextiles]].  Ideal filter medium optimizes [[surface area]] for microbial attachment, wastewater retention time, allows air flow, resists plugging is mechanically robust in all weathers allowing walking access across the filter and does not degrade.  Some residential systems require forced aeration units which will increase maintenance and operational costs.

===Industrial wastewater treatment===

The treatment of industrial wastewater may involve specialized trickling filters which use plastic media and high flow rates. Wastewaters from a variety of industrial processes have been treated in trickling filters. Such industrial wastewater trickling filters consist of two types:

* Large tanks or concrete enclosures filled with plastic packing or other media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.kfupm.edu.sa/CE/msaleh/ChE%20107.11March06.ppt King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Course ChE 101.11] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728064144/http://faculty.kfupm.edu.sa/CE/msaleh/ChE%20107.11March06.ppt |date=2011-07-28 }} Saudi Aramco Engineering Development Program, pages 62-65 including Figure 11&lt;/ref&gt;
* Vertical towers filled with plastic packing or other media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;vid=USPAT4351729&amp;id=U3c8AAAAEBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;dq=trickle+filter+%22packed+tower%22+wastewater Biological filter and process] U.S. patent 4,351,729, September 28, 1982, Assigned to Celanese Corporation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ag.auburn.edu/~davisda/classes/facilities/presentations/Recirc_overview.pdf Lecture] by Dr. Allen Davis, [[Auburn University]], page 6 of 8 pdf pages including schematic of packed tower trickling filter){{full citation needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The availability of inexpensive plastic tower packings has led to their use as trickling filter beds in tall towers, some as high as 20 meters.&lt;ref name=Beychok&gt;{{cite book|author=Beychok, Milton R. |title=[[Aqueous Wastes from Petroleum and Petrochemical Plants]]| edition=1st| publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd|year=1967|lccn=67019834}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as the 1960s, such towers were in use at: the Great Northern Oil's [[Pine Bend Refinery]] in [[Minnesota]]; the Cities Service Oil Company Trafalgar Refinery in [[Oakville, Ontario]] and at a kraft paper mill.&lt;ref&gt;E.H. Bryan and D.H. Moeller, ''Aerobic Biological Oxidation Using Dowpac'', Paper 42, Conference on Biological Waste Treatment, Manhattan College, April 20, 1960. [http://cobweb.ecn.purdue.edu/~alleman]&lt;/ref&gt;

The treated water effluent from industrial wastewater trickling filters is typically processed in a clarifier to remove the sludge that sloughs off the microbial slime layer attached to the trickling filter media as for other trickling filter applications.

Some of the latest trickle filter technology involves aerated biofilters of  plastic media in vessels using blowers to inject air at the bottom of the vessels, with either downflow or upflow of the wastewater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Marcus Van Sperling|title= Activated Sludge and Aerobic Biofilm Reactors|edition= |publisher =IWA Publications|year=2007|isbn=1-84339-165-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''underachiever''' is a person who fails to achieve his or her [[potential]] or does not do as well as expected.{{by whom?|date=November 2012}}

Of particular interest is '''academic underachievement'''.  Studies of individuals who have not realized their apparent potential have identified [[Learning disability|learning disabilities]], [[Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]], and many other educational problems, and subsequently enabled methods of addressing these problems.  Current theories among academic scholars prefer to address underperformance problems with remedial help.  

The term is also used more generally; for example, a sports team that contains many star players but still loses games against teams with relatively little obvious talent might be termed underachieving. A [[stock]] which achieves poor [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] and/or [[capital gain]]s despite sound underlying business and/or [[asset]]s may be called underachieving.

The '''University of the Republic''' ({{lang-es|Universidad de la República}}, sometimes ''UdelaR'') is [[Uruguay]]'s public [[university]]. It is the most important, oldest, and largest university of the country, with a [[student]] body of 108,886 students (2012). It was founded on 18 July 1849 in [[Montevideo]], where most of its buildings and facilities are still located. Its current [[Rector (academia)|rector]] is [[Rodrigo Arim]].

==History==

The process of founding the country's public university began on 11 June 1833, when a law proposed by then-Senator Dámaso Antonio Larrañaga was passed. It called for the creation of nine academic departments; the President of the Republic would pass a decree formally creating the departments once the majority of them were in operation. In 1836 the House of General Studies was formed, housing the departments of Latin, philosophy, mathematics, theology and jurisprudence.

On 27 May 1838, [[Manuel Oribe]] passed a decree through which created the Greater University of the Republic.  That decree had few practical effects, given the institutional instability of the Oriental Republic of the Uruguay at that time.

==Ranking==
In 2011, according to [[University Ranking by Academic Performance (URAP)]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.urapcenter.org/2011|title=URAP - University Ranking by Academic Performance}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is the best university in Uruguay and 858th best university in the world.

In 2015, according to [[QS World University Rankings]], it ranks #701-750 worldwide and #38 in Latin America&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/universities/universidad-de-la-rep%C3%BAblica-udelar|title=UdelaR rankings |publisher=TopUniversities|accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;br&gt;

In 2018, according to QS World University Rankings, it ranks #801-1000 Worldwide, and remains in the #38 latinoamerican rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Universidad de la Republica (UdelaR) |url=https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/universidad-de-la-republica-udelar#wurs |website=Top Universities |accessdate=July 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law School===
[[File:2016 Facultad de Derecho de la Universidad de la República, Avenida 18 de Julio.jpg|thumb|University of the Republic Law School.]]
The University of the Republic [[Law School]] was established on June 18, 1838 as the Academy of Jurisprudence, making it the oldest law school in the nation. It became a branch of the University of the Republic on July 18, 1849. It is the only branch of the university that hasn't moved from the main building downtown [[Montevideo]]. It was the only law school in Uruguay until the arrival of the [[Catholic University]] in 1984. 

Many Presidents of Uruguay, senators, representatives and other public authorities with a law degree have graduated from this law school. Notable professors include Jorge Gamarra, Alejandro Abal, Alberto Perez Perez, Dora Bagdassarian, Helios Sarthou, Carlos Delpiazzo, [[Gonzalo Fernández (Uruguayan politician)|Gonzalo Fernández]], and Daniel Ferrere.

The [[Dean (education)|Dean]] is Dr. Cristina Mangarelli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universidad.edu.uy/prensa/renderItem/itemId/42700|title=Cristina Mangarelli es la nueva decana de Derecho|publisher=Portal Universidad de la República|accessdate=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its main executive organ is the Law School Council, integrated by the dean and members in representation of students, former students and professors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fder.edu.uy/cogobierno|title=Cogobierno|publisher=Facultad de Derecho, Universidad de la República|accessdate=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other cities==
In an effort to decentralize higher education, the University has opened schools in cities other than Montevideo. Its ''Regional Norte'' in [[Salto, Uruguay|Salto]] offers [[Academic degree|degree]]s in Architecture, Law and Nursing. Fragments of other degrees, which can be completed in Montevideo, are also offered there. At the ''Casa Universitaria'' in [[Rivera]], the Faculty of Sciences offers the Technicature in Management of Environmental Resources, which has a duration of two and a half years.

'''Urban archaeology''' is a sub discipline of [[archaeology]] specialising in the material past of [[town]]s and [[cities]] where long-term human habitation has often left a rich record of the past.

Humans produce waste: Large concentrations of humans produce large concentrations of waste. Kitchen waste, broken objects, and similar material all need to be disposed of. Small numbers of people can dispose of their waste locally without encouraging [[vermin]] or endangering their health. Once people began to live together in large numbers, around five thousand years ago, such methods began to become impractical. Material would be brought into these new settlements but would rarely be taken out again. {{clarify|date=November 2014}}

Up until the nineteenth century when organised rubbish disposal became widespread in urban areas people invariably threw their waste from their windows or buried it in their gardens. If their houses fell down, a common enough occurrence when planning laws were non-existent, owners would pick out what they could reuse, stamp down the remains and rebuild on the old site.

The effect of this is that even a moderately sized settlement of any antiquity is built on top of a heap of refuse and demolished buildings and is therefore raised up from its original height on a plateau of archaeology. This is most apparent in the [[Tell (archaeology)|tel]] sites of the [[Near East]] where towns that have been occupied for thousands of years are raised up many metres above the surrounding landscape.

In walled towns such as those in [[medieval]] [[Europe]] the effect of the encircling defences was to hold in the waste so that it could not slip outwards, magnifying the effect.

==Historic development==

Archaeological [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] within historic cities therefore often produces a thick [[Stratification (archeology)|stratigraphy]] dating back to the original foundation and telling the story of its history.

The [[City of London]] serves as an example, for urban excavations have been performed there since the late 1900s. These excavations, performed in populated areas of the city, revealed historical evidence of events unforeseen previously by historians. London sits on a tel, which preserves a layer of dark material, attributed to the burning of the city by [[Boudica]] in 60 AD. It was only by excavation of the urban areas that these revelations could be made, as the city has long since outgrown its borders after its rebuild, some years after the Boudican revolt.

The dense stratigraphy of such cities posed problems for the archaeologists who first excavated them. Earlier excavations were generally limited to rural areas, or towns which had been long abandoned. [[Open area excavation]] was feasible as there was plenty of space and the archaeology could often be exposed just in plan. In working cities however, space for excavation is usually limited to the size of the open plot and one layer of archaeology needs to be excavated before the next one can be exposed.

Issues such as this had appeared before, at [[Pompeii]] or at multiphase rural sites but the move towards the investigation of cities, which began in Europe following the [[Second World War]]. The trend of urban excavation in areas such as Europe, the East Coast of the United States, and other western world cities, has grown since the war. Due to the bombing of landscapes during the war, the possibility of losing evidence connected to early civilizations became realized. The idea of settlement follows a principle, that settlement is made where resources are conveniently accessed. Prosperous cities, such as Boston and London, began as settlements, and grew quickly due to the convenient access of resources. However, the fact that these cities still exist today does not dismiss the fact that, at some point in history, some other civilization had once settled there.

==Methods==

The resulting solution revolved around the method of [[single context recording]]. The practice involves drawing each feature individually in plan and then relating its position to the site grid rather than planning large areas at once. Each drawing is made on a square piece of translucent film representing a 5-metre x 5 metre grid square. The site is excavated down to the first significant layer of archaeology and features excavated and recorded as normal but also planned as single contexts. The site is then reduced to the next layer of archaeology and the process begins again. The excavation and recording can continue until natural deposits are reached. A small, deep trench known as a [[sondage]] is often excavated at first to provide a view of the entire stratigraphy at once and give an indication of the quantity of material to be excavated.

Once the work is finished, the square sheets can be overlaid onto one another to provide a picture of the site. By identifying which features cut others and using information from dateable [[Artifact (archaeology)|artefact]]s and [[ecofact]]s an archaeologist can isolate various phases of activity and show how the use of the site developed of periods of hundreds or even thousands of years. Context record sheets produced by the individual excavators provide further information on each context's nature and relationship with its neighbours. Such interpretation would be impossible using open area excavation where numerous overall site plans would soon seem inflexible.

[[File:Vitae patrum von Heribert Rosweyde 1615.jpg|thumb|right|Cover of the 1615 first edition of ''Vitae Patrum'' by [[Heribert Rosweyde]]]]The '''''Vitae Patrum''''' (literally '''''Lives of the Fathers''''', also called ''Lives of the Desert Fathers'') is an encyclopedia of [[hagiography|hagiographical]] writings on the [[Desert Fathers]] and [[Desert Mothers]] of early Christianity.  The bulk of the original texts date from the third and fourth centuries.&lt;ref name="Leader2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anne Leader|title=The Badia of Florence: Art and Observance in a Renaissance Monastery|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BjS8j-6mf1UC&amp;pg=PA140|accessdate=9 August 2012|date=30 December 2011|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-35567-6|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vitae-patrum.org.uk/|title=Vitae Patrum|accessdate=11 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lives that were originally written in Greek were translated into Latin between the fourth and the seventh century. An Italian vernacular translation was made by Dominican friar [[Domenico Cavalca]] from [[Pisa]] at the beginning of the fourteenth century.
A printed edition, edited by the Jesuit [[Heribert Rosweyde]], was printed by Balthazar Moret in 1615. The book is a significant part of the much broader work, ''[[Acta Sanctorum]]''.&lt;ref name="Delehaye1922"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hippolyte Delehaye|title=The work of the Bollandists through three centuries, 1615-1915|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=avjoKxXmj6EC&amp;pg=PA13|accessdate=10 August 2012|year=1922|publisher=Princeton University Press|pages=17–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Vitae Patrum'' is based on extensive research by Rosweyde into all the available literature he could find on the early desert monastics. [[Hippolyte Delehaye]] described the work as "the epic of the origins of monasticism in Egypt and Syria, an epic unsurpassed in interest and grandeur." In the thirteenth century, a version of ''Vitae Patrum'' had been translated into Latin. It was such a popular book that numerous versions and editions were published, with extensive changes and variations in the stories. Rosweyde based his book on  twenty-three different versions of those earlier books, studying, dating, and classifying all the different versions and changes.&lt;ref name="Delehaye1922" /&gt;

Rosweyde's ''Vitae Patrum'' consists of ten books. Book I has the lives of sixteen saints under the title ''Vitae virorum'' and eleven saints under the title ''Vitae mulierum'', beginning with [[St. Paul the Hermit]] and [[St. Anthony of the Desert]], and including women saints such as [[The Life of Saint Mary the Harlot|Saint Mary the Harlot]]. Books II, ''Historia monachorum'', and III, ''Verba seniorum'' (Sayings of the Elders), are attributed to [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]], who was later found to be only their translator. Book IV is a compilation of writings by [[Sulpicius Severus]] and [[John Cassian]]. Book V is another collection of ''Verba seniorum'' from Latin and Greek by [[Pelagius]].&lt;ref name="Delehaye1922" /&gt;

Book VI and Book VII are further collections of ''Verba seniorum'' (Sayings of the Elders) by unknown Greek authors translated by John the subdeacon, possibly [[Pope John III]], and by [[Paschasius]]. Book VIII is a text that was previously known as ''The Paradise of Heraclides'', but which Rosweyde attributed to its real author, [[Palladius of Galatia|Palladius]], and titled the ''[[Lausiac History]]''. Book IX is ''De Vitis Patrum'' by [[Theodoret]]. Book X is ''The Spiritual Meadow of Moschus''. Rosweyde wrote an introduction to each book.&lt;ref name="Delehaye1922" /&gt;

'''World Christianity''' or '''global Christianity''' is a term that attempts to convey the global nature of the [[Christianity|Christian]] religion. However, the term often focuses on “non-[[Western Christianity]]” which “comprises (usually the exotic) instances of Christian faith in ‘the [[global South]]’, in Asia, Africa and Latin America.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=2|title=Christianity as a World Religion|author-last1=Kim|author-first1=Sebastian|author-last2=Kim|author-first2=Kirsteen|publisher=Continuum|location=London|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also includes [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] or [[diaspora|diasporic]] forms in Western Europe and North America.&lt;ref name="Hanciles2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jehu Hanciles|title=Beyond Christendom: Globalization, African Migration, and the Transformation of the West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vmCDAwAAQBAJ|year=2008|publisher=Orbis Books|isbn=978-1-60833-103-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the term ==
The term ''world Christianity'' can first be found in the writings of [[Francis John McConnell]] in 1929 and [[Henry P. Van Dusen]] in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/human-needs-and-world-christianity/oclc/893126|title=Human needs and world Christianity|last=McConnell|first=Francis John|date=1929|publisher=Friendship Press|year=|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|language=English|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/world-christianity-yesterday-today-tomorrow/oclc/823535&amp;referer=brief_results|title=World Christianity: Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow|last=Van Dusen|first=Henry P.|date=1947|publisher=Abingdon-Cokesbury Press|year=|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|language=English|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term would likewise be used by the mission historian [[Kenneth Scott Latourette]] to speak of the "World Christian Fellowship" and "World Christian Community."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/toward-a-world-christian-fellowship/oclc/1149344|title=Toward a world Christian fellowship|last=Latourette|first=Kenneth Scott|date=1938|publisher=Association Press|year=|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|language=English|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/emergence-of-a-world-christian-community/oclc/396146|title=The Emergence of a World Christian Community|last=Latourette|first=Kenneth Scott|date=1949|publisher=Yale University Press|year=|isbn=|location=New Haven|pages=|language=English|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For these individuals, world Christianity was meant to promote the idea of [[Christian mission]]s and [[Ecumenism|ecumenical unity]]. However, after the end of World War II, as Christian missions ended in many countries such as [[North Korea]] and [[China]] and parts of Asia and Africa shifted due to [[decolonization]] and [[Self-determination|national independence]], these aspects of world Christianity were largely lost.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phan|first=Peter C.|author-link=Peter C.

The current usage of the term puts much less emphasis in [[Christian mission|missions]] and [[ecumenism]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A number of historians have noted a twentieth-century "global shift" in Christianity, from a religion largely found in Europe and the Americas to one which is found in the [[Global South|global south]].&lt;ref name="Walls2015"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hNq6BwAAQBAJ|title=Missionary Movement in Christian History: Studies in the Transmission of Faith|first=|date=1996|publisher=Orbis Books|year=|isbn=978-1-60833-106-2|location=|pages=|quote=|via=|author=Andrew F.

Another term that is often used as analogous to "world Christianity" is the term "global Christianity." However, scholars such as [[Lamin Sanneh]] have argued that "global Christianity" refers to a [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] understanding of Christianity that emphasizes the replication of Christian forms and patterns in Europe, whereas "world Christianity" refers to the multiplicity of indigenous responses to the Christian gospel.&lt;ref name="Sanneh2003"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8gbz-xMP1zYC|title=Whose Religion Is Christianity?: The Gospel Beyond the West|date=9 October 2003|publisher=Wm.

In contrast to these historians, there is a growing number of [[Christian theology|theologians]] who have been engaging the field of world Christianity from the discipline of [[systematic theology]]. Some examples of this include the Pentecostal [[Veli-Matti Kärkkäinen]]&amp;nbsp;and the Catholic [[Peter C. Phan]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L8_wCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA121|title=The Dialogical Spirit: Christian Reason and Theological Method in the Third Millennium|last=Yong|first=Amos|publisher=James Clark and Co.|year=2015|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=121–148|chapter=Whither Evangelical Theology?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3274">'''ʿIlm al-ḥurūf''' ({{lang-ar|عِلْم الْحُرُوف}}) or '''the science of letters''' is an Arabic [[Esotericism|esoteric]] science or magic practice concerned with occult properties assigned to the letters of the [[Arabic alphabet]], and the words and names formed from those letters.

Using these properties of letters, ʿilm al-ḥurūf then sought to combine letters based on these magical properties to form words to achieve a desired magical or divinatory effect. It also sought to use these properties to analyze significant names and words, such as the [[Names of God in Islam|99 names of God]], to reveal and understand divine secrets.

== Etymology ==
ʿIlm al-Ḥurūf is composed of the two words ''ʿilm'' ({{lang-ar|عِلْم}}) meaning "science", and ''ḥurūf'' ({{lang-ar|حُرُوف}}), the plural of the word ''ḥarf'' ({{lang-ar|حَرْف}}), meaning "letters".
