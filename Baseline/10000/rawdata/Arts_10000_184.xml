The '''architecture of Mongolia''' is largely based on traditional dwellings, such as the [[yurt]] ({{lang-mn|гэр}}, ''ger'') and the tent. During the 16th and 17th centuries, [[Monastery#Buddhist monasteries|lamaseries]] were built throughout the country as [[Temple#Temples and non-Western architecture|temples]] which were later enlarged to accommodate a growing number of worshipers. Mongolian architects designed their temples with six and twelve angles and pyramidal roofs approximating the yurt's round shape. Further expansion led to a quadratic shape in the design of the temples, with roofs in the shape of [[pole marquee]]s.&lt;ref name="Chultem"&gt;{{cite book

Mongolian artist and art historian N. Chultem identified three styles of traditional Mongolian architecture (Mongolian, Tibetan and Chinese), alone or in combination. Batu-Tsagaan (1654), designed by [[Zanabazar]], was an early quadratic temple. The Dashchoilin Khiid monastery in [[Ulaanbaatar]] is an example of yurt-style architecture. The 18th century Lavrin Temple in the [[Erdene Zuu monastery|Erdene Zuu]] lamasery was built in the Tibetan tradition. The Choijin Lama Süm temple (1904), now a museum, is an example of a temple built in the Chinese tradition. The quadratic Tsogchin Temple, in Ulaanbaatar's [[Gandantegchinlen Monastery|Gandan]] monastery, combines Mongolian and Chinese traditions. The Maitreya Temple (demolished in 1938) was an example of Tibeto-Mongolian architecture.&lt;ref name="Chultem" /&gt; The Dashchoilin Khiid monastery has begun a project to restore this temple and the {{convert|80|ft|adj=on}} sculpture of [[Maitreya]]. Indian influences can also be seen in Mongolian architecture, especially in the design of Buddhist [[stupa]]s.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; their chief city was Luut Hot (Dragon City).

Powerful states developed by [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] and [[Uyghurs|Uigur]] tribes from the sixth through ninth centuries dominated the region. and there were several Turkic cities and towns in the [[Orkhon River|Orkhon]], [[Tuul River|Tuul]] and [[Selenga River]] valleys.&lt;ref name="Maidar"/&gt; The main city of the [[Turkic Khaganate]] was Balyklyk. The [[Uyghur Khaganate]] which succeeded the Turks centred on the city of [[Ordu-Baliq|Kara Balgasun]], founded during the early eighth century. A portion of the {{convert|12|m|adj=on}}-high fortress wall with a watchtower has been preserved. A large craft trading district existed in the city,&lt;ref name="Maidar"/&gt; whose architecture was influenced by [[Sogdiana|Sogdian]] and Chinese traditions.&lt;ref name="Chultem"/&gt;

Archaeological excavations uncovered traces of cities from the 10th- to 12th-century Kidan period. The most significant excavated city was Hatun Hot, founded in 944. Another significant Kidan city was [[Bars-Hot]] in the [[Kherlen River]] valley, which covered an area of {{convert|290|ha|acre}}. The city was surrounded with mud walls which are now {{convert|4|m}} thick and {{convert|1.5|to|2|m}} high.&lt;ref name="Chultem"/&gt;

==Yurts==

[[File:Ger Tereg Blue.jpg|thumb|alt=Drawing of a wheeled yurt pulled by oxen|Ger-tereg on the move]]
[[Image:Panoramique ger.jpg|thumb|alt=Spacious, open interior|Inside a yurt]]
[[Image:Mongolia Ger.jpg|thumb|alt=Two yurts, with people outside for scale|Yurts in the steppe]]
[[Image:Mongolia Dashichoiling 01.jpg|thumb|alt=Yurt-shaped building with cars parked outside|Temple at the Dashichoiling monastery]]
The [[yurt]], traditional dwelling of Mongolian nomads, is a circular structure supported by a collapsible wooden frame and covered with wool [[felt]]. In [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]], a yurt is known as a "ger" (гэр).

During the 12th and 13th centuries, ''ger-tereg'' (yurts on carts) were built for rulers. Large iron [[Plain bearing#Bushing|bushings]] for cartwheel axles were found during excavations at [[Karakorum]].&lt;ref name="Kiselev S. V. and Merpert N. Y"&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Kiselev S. V. and Merpert N. Y

  | location = Moscow
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Axle length was over {{convert|6|m}}, and the cart was pulled by 22 oxen. Such ''ger-teregs'' are mentioned in the ''[[Secret History of the Mongols]]''.

Medieval yurt camps were commonly arranged in a ''huree'' (circle), with the leader's yurt in the centre. ''Hurees'' were replaced by an ''ail'' (neighbourhood) arrangement in the 13th and 14th centuries during the Mongol Khanate and the end of internal strife. After the 15th-century disintegration of the khanate, the ''huree'' was the basic layout of monasteries (which were initially mobile). Another type of monastery layout, ''khiid'' (following the Tibetan arrangement) was used during the 16th and 17th centuries when Buddhism was re-introduced to the region. As ''huree'' monasteries and camps developed into towns and cities, their names retained the word ''huree'' (for example, Niislel Huree and Zasagtu Khaan-u Huree).

Roofs originally had steeper slopes, with a rim around the center opening to allow smoke from central, open fires to vent. During the 18th and 19th centuries, enclosed stoves with chimneys (''zuuh'') were introduced; this permitted a simpler design, with a lower silhouette. Another relatively-recent development is an [[Fly (tent)|additional layer of canvas]] for rain protection.

The organization and furnishings of the interior space mirror family roles and spiritual concepts. Each [[cardinal direction]] is significant, and the door always faces south. Herders use the sun's position in the crown of the yurt as a [[sundial]].

Yurts have been used in Central Asia for thousands of years. In Mongolia they have influenced other architectural forms, particularly temples. Between 30 and 40 percent of the population live in yurts, many in city suburbs.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

==Tents==
[[File:Little world, Aichi prefecture - Tent village - Mongolian Tent in China.jpg|thumb|alt=Yurt-shaped tent under cover|Recreation of a Mongolian tent]]
Tents played a role in the development of Mongolian architecture, and these temporary shelters were frequently used under [[pastoral]] conditions. Tents were erected for [[Naadam]], feasts and other gatherings.

''Jodgor'' is a small tent, accommodating one or two people. ''Maihan'' is a larger tent for a group. ''Tsatsar'' is a fabric shade on vertical supports, replacing a wall. ''Tsachir'' is a large, rectangular tent with vertical fabric walls, and ''Asar'' is a generic name for ''tsatsar'' and ''tsachir''.

[[Giovanni da Pian del Carpine|Giovanni da Pian del Carpine's]] book, ''[[Ystoria Mongalorum]]'' (''History of the Mongols''), reported that during the 1246 enthronement ceremony for [[Güyük Khan|Guyuk Khaan]] a tent with a capacity of 2,000 people was erected on the [[Tamir River]]. The marquee was supported by pillars decorated with gold leaves, and the internal side of the walls were covered with [[Canopy (grape)|canopy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mongoliaeconomy.com/architecture-of-mongolia-2/|title=Architecture Of Mongolia|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later designs of many temples were based on ''tsachir''.

=={{anchor|Imperial Period}}Imperial period==
[[Image:Karakorum Silver Tree.jpg|thumb|alt=Ornate 18th-century drawing|18th-century drawing of Silver Tree fountain in front of [[Tumen Amugulang]] Palace]]

The remains of the [[Mongol Empire]] capital, [[Karakorum]], were first rediscovered and studied by S. V. Kiselev. Karakorum, in the [[Orkhon River]] valley, was founded by [[Genghis Khan]] in 1220 as a military centre; in 15 years, it also became an administrative and cultural centre of the empire.

The Tumen Amugulang palace (palace of the Great Khan) was in the centre of the city. Based on the records of [[William of Rubruck]], most scholars believe that a silver, tree-shaped fountain stood in front of the palace; however, according to others the fountain was inside the palace. According to Rubruck, four silver lions stood at the foot of the Silver Tree and fermented mare's milk (''airag'', a favourite Mongol drink) flowed from their mouths. Four golden serpents twined around the tree. 

[[Image:Turtle-Karakorum.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Large stone tortoise|Tortoise (''[[Bixi (tortoise)#Outside of China|bixi]]'') at Karakorum]]
Wine ran from the mouth of one serpent, ''airag'' from the second serpent, [[mead]] from the third and [[rice wine]] from the fourth. At the top of the tree, an angel blew a bugle. The tree's branches, leaves and fruits were made of silver. It was designed by a captive sculptor, William of Paris.{{cn|date=March 2017}} The khan sat on a throne in the north end of the yard, in front of the palace. Excavations partially confirmed the description, and the buildings were heated by smoke pipes installed under the floors. The khan's palace was built on a {{convert|.2475|ha|acre|adj=on}} platform.

Genghis Khan's son, [[Ögedei Khan|Ögedei]], ordered his brothers, sons and other princes to build palaces in Karakorum. The city contained [[Buddhist]] temples, [[Christian]] churches and [[Muslim]] [[mosque]]s. There were sculptures of tortoises at each gate of the four-sided, walled city. [[Stele]]s on the tortoises' backs were topped with beacons for travellers in the steppe. Karakorun's construction was supervised by Otchigin, youngest brother of Genghis Khan.

[[File:KarakorumPalace.jpg|thumb|alt=Museum exhibit|Artifacts from the 13th-century palace in Karakorum]]
Other cities and palaces existed throughout Mongolia during the 13th and 14th centuries. Best-studied are the ruins of Palace Aurug, near Kerulen, and the cities of Hirhira and Kondui in the trans-Baikal region. The latter two indicate that cities developed not only around the khans' palaces but also around the homes of other nobility; Hirhira developed around the residence of Juchi-Khasar. The Mongolian nobility, dissatisfied with temporary residences, began to build luxurious palaces. The palace in Hirhira was inside a [[citadel]]. The palace in Kondui was built on a platform surrounded by double-tiered terraces, pavilions and pools. The archeological excavations revealed evidence of burning; all three cities fell during the late 14th century,&lt;ref name="S. V. Kiselev"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the Chinese army raided the region and looted the cities. Karakorum, destroyed in 1380, never restored its previous glory. Wars waged by China continued from 1372 to 1422, halting Mongolia's cultural progress during the imperial period. The region experienced a dark age until the second half of the 16th century, when a renaissance began.

==Renaissance==
[[Image:ErdeneZuuKhiidTemple.jpg|thumb|alt=Large, pagoda-style building|Zuu Temple at Erdene Zuu monastery]]
After two centuries of cultural decline, Mongolia began a renaissance during the second half of the 16th century. This was a period of relative peace, free of foreign aggression, and the [[Gelug]] school of [[Buddhism]] was introduced. [[Altan Khan]] of Tumet founded the city of [[Hohhot]] in 1575 as a political and cultural centre. Among the first Buddhist monasteries in Mongolia during this period was temple Thegchen Chonchor Ling in [[Qinghai Lake|Khökh Nuur]], built by Altan Khan to commemorate his 1577 meeting with third [[Dalai Lama]] [[3rd Dalai Lama|Sonam Gyatso]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The Mongolian style began with mobile temples. As the people became more sedentary, the temples evolved into multi-angular and quadratic structures. The roof, supported by pillars and walls, served also as the ceiling.&lt;ref name="Z. Oyunbileg"&gt;{{cite book

[[Image:Złota Stupa w klasztorze Erdene Dzuu 01.jpg|thumb|alt=Large, ornate stupa|Stupa at Erdene Zuu monastery]]
[[Zanabazar]], the first Bogd Gegeen of the [[Khalkha Mongols]], designed many temples and monasteries in traditional Mongolian style and supervised their construction. He merged Oriental architecture with the designs of Mongolian yurts and marquees. Zanabazar's Batu-Tsagaan Tsogchin temple in Ulan Bator was a prototype of the Mongolian architectural style. A large, marquee-shaped structure, its four central columns support the roof. There are 12 columns in the middle row; those in the outer row are slightly taller, and the total number of columns is 108. The temple, designed for expansion, was originally {{convert|42|x|42|m}} and later expanded to {{convert|51|x|51|m}}.&lt;ref name="Z. Oyunbileg"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indian style was most prominent in stupa design. Among the best-known stupas are Ikh Tamir, Altan Suburgan of Erdene Zuu, Jiran Khashir of Gandang and the mausoleums of Abatai Khan and Tüsheetu Khan Gombodorji. The Khögnö Tarni (1600), Zaya-iin Khüree (1616), Baruun Khüree (1647) and Zaya-iin Khiid (1654) monasteries were built during this period.

=={{anchor|Post-Renaissance}}Post-renaissance==

Construction of temples in the renaissance tradition continued into the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries. Ishbaljir (1709–1788) compared building proportions to the proportions of the human body in ''Exquisite Flower Beads'', and Agvaanhaidav (1779–1838) described the process of building a Maitreya temple. Agvaanceren (1785–1849) wrote ''Aahar shaahar'' (''Building and Repairing Temples'').&lt;ref name="Z. Oyunbileg"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Translations of the [[Kangyur]] were also used by Mongolian architects.

The Züün Huree (1711), [[Amarbayasgalant Khiid|Amarbayasgalant]] (1727) and Manjusri Hiid (1733) monasteries were built during this period. The mobile monastery Ihe Huree, founded for Zanabazar, settled at its present Ulaanbaatar location in 1779. The wall around Erdene Yuu monastery, with 108 stupas, began construction in 1734.
 
The temple of the [[boddhisattva]] [[Avalokiteshvara]] was built from 1911 to 1913 as a symbol of the new, independent Bogdo Khanate of Mongolia. The statue of the boddhisattva, believed to opens the eyes of wisdom in sentient beings, symbolised the Mongolian people's step into modern civilisation.

In the beginning of the 20th century, there were about 800 monasteries throughout the country.
The experimental practice of combining traditional Asian architecture with Russian architecture was explored. The [[Bogd Khan]] had his winter palace built as a Russian ''horomy''. Another example of the combining of Asian and Russian styles is the residence of Khanddorji Wang, a leader of the [[Mongolian Revolution of 1911]]. The body of the building is designed as a Russian house, and the top was designed in the Asian style. One of the first European buildings in Mongolia is the 2-storey building housing Zanabazar Museum of Fine Arts, built as a trade centre in 1905.

==Revolutionary architecture==

The [[October Revolution]] destroyed much traditional culture, with over 800 monasteries demolished and thousands of [[lama]]s [[purge]]d. The [[constructivist architecture]] which flourished in the [[Soviet Union]] also took root in Mongolia. The Radio and Postal Communications Committee building, with its pyramid-topped tower, was an example of constructivism. Other examples were the Mongoltrans offices, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Military Club.&lt;ref name="S. Odon"&gt;{{citation

Downtown Ulaanbaatar was designed by Soviet architects, who developed [[Classical architecture|classicism]] as [[Stalinist architecture]]. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the State University, Government House, the Opera House and the State Library exemplify European classicism.

Mongolian architects worked to creatively combine this [[Neoclassical architecture in Russia|neoclassicism]] with traditional Mongolian architecture. The development of downtown Ulaanbaatar continued at the initiative of B. Chimed, who designed the National Theatre, the Natural History Museum and the Ulaanbaatar Hotel. The theatre has the quadratic plane and double-tier marquee roof of Mongolian architecture; it and his other buildings Chimed's use of indigenous traditions in contemporary architecture. This direction was followed by other architects; the Urt Tsagaan (Tourists' Walk) and Ministry of Health by B. Dambiinyam and the Astronomical Observatory, State University Building #2 and Meteorology Building by A. Hishigt are distinct from European architecture.&lt;ref name="S. Odon"/&gt;

[[Image:PalaceOfCulture.JPG|thumb|alt=Large, white Stalinist-style building|Palace of Culture]]
Mongolian architecture was dictated by economy and [[mass production]] during the [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and [[Leonid Brezhnev]] eras in the Soviet Union. The early 1960s were characterised by increased Soviet and [[China|Chinese]] investment due to their competition for Mongolian influence, and the competition resulted in accelerated development. The older districts south of the Middle River (Dund gol) and the [[Peace Bridge (Mongolia)|Peace Bridge]] were built by Chinese workers.

The architecture of the 1960s and 1970s included monotonous four-, five- and nine-storey apartment blocks with simple rectangular shapes, dictated by the need for cheap, speedy construction. Hostility between the Soviet Union and China forced Mongolia to take sides, and the country allied with the former (leading to increased Soviet investment). Apartment districts were built around Ulaanbaatar, including south of the Dund gol river, often by Soviet soldiers. New cities were built ([[Darkhan (city)|Darkhan]], [[Erdenet]] and [[Baganuur]]) during this period.

Brezhnev's 1974 visit was followed by modern housing in Ulaanbaatar's [[Bayangol, Ulaanbaatar|Bayangol]] district. The housing consists of nine-storey apartment blocks and five V-shaped 12-storey buildings on Ayush Street, similar to [[Kalinin Avenue]] in the centre of [[Moscow]]. This street is the city's busiest shopping centre.

The monotony of urban architecture was criticised at four successive congresses of the Mongolian Association of Architects beginning in 1972, but no significant improvement was achieved.&lt;ref name="S. Odon"/&gt; The early 1980s brought new public buildings, such as the Lenin Museum and the Yalalt Cinema (now the Tengis). The Ethnographical Museum, in the centre of Ulaanbaatar's amusement park, was designed as a Mongolian castle surrounded by walls on an island in an artificial lake. The winter house of the international children's Nairamdal camp was designed as an ocean liner travelling in a sea of mountains.{{cn|date=March 2017}} One of the largest monuments of the socialist period is the Palace of Culture. Although it has elements of Mongolian architecture, its basic design is also found in the capitals of many former socialist countries.

Amid a vision of replacing yurts with apartment blocks, the yurt districts were seen as temporary, transient housing. Under socialism the state made little or no effort (except for bathhouses) to develop the yurt districts, which became Mongolian [[shanty town]]s.

==Modern period==
[[Image:ChinggisKhanHotel.JPG|thumb|alt=Large, modern building against a clear blue sky|Rear of Ulaanbaatar's Chinggis Khaan Hotel]]

[[Perestroika]] and the transition to democracy induced interest in traditional history and culture and free thinking in the arts and architecture. Nearly the entire population of Mongolia donated toward repairs to the Chenrezig temple in the [[Gandantegchinlen Khiid Monastery|Gandan Tegchinling]] monastery and the re-casting of the statue of [[Boddhisattva]] [[Avalokiteshvara]].{{cn|date=March 2017}} A group of artists and architects led by the actor Bold, an enthusiast for traditional architecture, developed a project to make Ulaanbaatar an Asian city. They began building traditional gates and shades{{clarify|date=March 2017|reason=What are "shades" in this context?}} in the Street of Revolutionaries and other streets and in the amusement park. Although the project ended at the beginning of the [[1998 Russian financial crisis]], Mongolia's Buddhist [[sangha]] continued restoring and founding monasteries.

Modern architecture returned as the economy began to recover from the financial crisis. The completion of the tall glass Ardiin Bank building (now hosting the Ulaanbaatar Bank) and the glass Chinggis Khan Hotel complex during the second half of 1990s marked the beginning of a new age in Mongolian architecture.

The Bodhi Tower, built in 2004, consists of two buildings. The one facing [[Sükhbaatar Square]] is a four-storey classical building which harmonises with the surrounding 1950s architecture. A high-rise tower, the other building, faces the back street; a similar principle was used in the design of the previous period's Palace of Culture. Another contemporary building is Ulaanbaatar's Narantuul Tower. [[Hotel Mongolia]], in the city's [[Bayanzürkh]] district, has a silver-tree fountain at its centre reminiscent of [[Karakorum]].

Prime Minister [[Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj]] appointed a group of professionals to develop a project for a new city at Karakorum. According to the prime minister, the new city would become the capital of Mongolia. After his resignation and the appointment of [[Miyeegombyn Enkhbold]] as prime minister, the project was abandoned.

'''ArtPrize''' is an art competition and festival in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first= Nancy|last= Tobin |title= West of Chelsea: A Local ArtPrize?
|url= http://maplewood.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/17/west-of-chelsea-a-local-artprize/ |work=The New York Times|date= August 17, 2009|accessdate=August 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anyone over the age of 18 can display their art, and any space within the three-square-mile ArtPrize district can be a venue. There are typically over 160 venues such as museums, galleries, bars, restaurants, hotels, public parks, bridges, laundromats, auto body shops, and more.  

ArtPrize lasts for 19 days beginning in late September, and during each festival $500,000 in cash prizes are awarded based on public voting and a jury of art experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/2009/apr/23/news/chi-ap-mi-artprize-glance|title=Details about the Grand Rapids art contest|date=April 23, 2009|work=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=June 8, 2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt; ArtPrize was originally an annual event; in 2018 it was switched to a biennial schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artprize.org/blog/artprize-gets-ready-for-next-decade|title=ArtPrize Gets Ready for its Next Decade: Introduces Project 1, Shifts to Biennial Schedule|website=www.artprize.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

ArtPrize was created in 2009 by Rick DeVos, the son of Republican gubernatorial candidate [[Dick DeVos]] and United States Secretary of Education [[Betsy DeVos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artprize.org/about/rick-devos|title=Rick DeVos|website=www.artprize.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DeVos family contributes approximately $560,000 annually to the ArtPrize budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artandeducation.net/news/156119/michigan-art-festival-scrutinized-for-ties-to-secretary-of-education-betsy-devos|title=Michigan Art Festival Scrutinized for Ties to Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos  - News - Art &amp; Education|website=www.artandeducation.net|language=en|access-date=2018-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the festival's connection to the DeVos family's wealth and their conservative politics was criticized by artist [[Eric Millikin]] in his “Made of Money” installation, placed within ArtPrize.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/winners-to-be-announced-in-annual-michigan-art-competition|title=Winners to be announced in annual Michigan art competition|date=2017-10-06|work=National Post|access-date=2018-09-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

In 2014, ''The Art Newspaper'' listed ArtPrize as one of the most-attended "big ticket" art events (those where visitors are often counted more than once), with ArtPrize's attendance of 440,000 being roughly one quarter of the 1.6 million who attended the Russian Imperial Costume exhibition at the [[Hermitage Museum|State Hermitage Museum]] in [[Saint Petersburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theartnewspaper.com/news/museums/visitor-figures-2014-top-15-big-ticket-shows/|title=Visitor figures 2014: top 15 Big Ticket shows|last=De Silva|first=Jose|date=April 1, 2015|website=The Art Newspaper|access-date=April 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ArtPrize was highlighted along with [[Slows Bar BQ]] and the [[Frederik Meijer Gardens &amp; Sculpture Park]] as one of the reasons to visit Grand Rapids in ''The New York Times’'' "52 Places To Go in 2016."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/01/07/travel/places-to-visit.html|title=52 Places to Go in 2016|date=2016-01-07|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-04-04|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
[[File:Rob-Bliss-Plane-Drop-B-402 copy.jpg|thumb|540x540px|Thousands of ArtPrize visitors gather in Rosa Parks Circle in downtown Grand Rapids.]]
ArtPrize was conceived by Rick DeVos as an untraditional art contest with its goals being: any artist in the world could compete; anyone with property in downtown Grand Rapids could turn their space into a venue; and any visitor could vote for their favorite artwork. Event organizers would provide no selection committees or curators. And the largest cash prize in the art world would be awarded entirely by popular vote.

At the inaugural ArtPrize, held in 2009, the winners were determined solely by the public, voting from mobile devices and the ArtPrize website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/08/arts/design/08artprize.html|title=Eyes on the ArtPrize|date=October 7, 2009|publisher=The New York Times|access-date=September 24, 2016|author=Micheline Maynard}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2010, ArtPrize added categories judged by art experts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.artprize.org/blog/category/jurors|title=Official ArtPrize Blog:Jurors|publisher=ArtPrize|access-date=September 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2014 restructured the awards format&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artprize.org/blog/harder-better-faster-stronger|title=ArtPrize 2014 Updates Awards Structure|website=www.artprize.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; bringing two parallel tracks of public vote and juried awards with equal prize amounts. The updated award structure includes two Grand Prizes of $200,000, one chosen by public vote and one selected by a panel of three arts experts. An additional $100,000 in awards are given to artists in four entry categories—Two-Dimensional, Three-Dimensional, Time-Based, and Installation—as well as the Outstanding Venue Juried Award for best curatorial presentation.&lt;ref name="2015-jury-winners"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/artprize/index.ssf/2015/10/see_who_won_artprize_2015s_juried_category_awards.html|title=See who won ArtPrize 2015 juried category awards|last=Serba|first=John|date=October 9, 2015|publisher=MLive Media Group|accessdate=September 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mlive.com/artprize/index.ssf/2011/12/artprize_2012_will_introduce_new_100000_juried_grand_prize_for_fourth_exhibition_next_september.html|title=ArtPrize 2012 will introduce new $100,000 juried grand prize for fourth exhibition next September|last=Kaczmarczyk|first=Jeffrey|date=December 6, 2011|publisher=[[MLive.com]]|accessdate=May 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Visitors must attend the annual event in person in order to vote. They can either download the ArtPrize mobile app, free for iOS and Android devices, which uses location services to determine when a visitor has stepped into the three square-mile event district—or visit an [http://www.artprize.org/visit/details#artprize-neighborhood-hubs ArtPrize HUB location] to register in person. Each artist is assigned a 5-digit vote code which is posted near their entry during the event, and available both online and in the mobile app.&lt;ref name="mrak"&gt;{{Cite news|first= Mrak |last= Stryker |title= ArtPrize: where to look and how to vote |url=http://www.freep.com/article/20090920/ENT05/90920012/1115/Ent05/ArtPrize--Where-to-look-and-how-to-vote|newspaper= [[Detroit News]]|id= |date= September 20, 2009 |accessdate=September 20, 2009 |quote= | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091005014056/http://www.freep.com/article/20090920/ENT05/90920012/1115/Ent05/ArtPrize--Where-to-look-and-how-to-vote| archivedate= October 5, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
David Dodde’s ''Fleurs et riviere'' was an entry that placed magnetic flowers on the [[Alexander Calder]] sculpture ''[[La Grande Vitesse]]''. After getting complaints, the City of Grand Rapids contacted the Calder Foundation to get their input. Calder's grandson, Alexander S. C. Rower, replied: "The initiative is luckily temporary and reflects an utter lack of understanding and respect of Calder's genius." The city decided to have the flowers removed before the end of the exhibition.&lt;ref name="2013-controversy-mlive"&gt;{{Cite web|title= Calder's grandson calls ArtPrize flowers an 'abomination' |url= http://www.mlive.com/artprize/index.ssf/2013/09/calders_grandson_calls_artprize_flowers_an_abomination.html |last= Vande Bunte |first= Matt |publisher= MLive Media Group |date= September 26, 2013 |accessdate=October 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''C Both Sides''' is a collective art project that started in 2006 by artists Teresa Doyle and Edel O Reilly Flynn in association with [[Westmeath County Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/features/2008/0328/1206144805872.html |title=Fri, Mar 28, 2008 – Wishing they were here to stay |publisher=The Irish Times |date=3 March 2008 |accessdate=6 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project consisted of people being invited to send postcards from all over Ireland to Doyle and O Reilly Flynn's addresses which were then later displayed in Mullingar Arts Centre in 2007. Knowledge of the project spread through word of mouth, internet postings and press releases in local papers. Over 500 cards were received. One of the main reasons for creating such a project was to revive and reawaken the art of handwriting, in an environment that has become dominated by high speed forms of communication such as email and text messaging. It was also a means of giving people an opportunity to express themselves through this visual and written medium. It was designed to be a project that was accessible to all. Teresa Doyle felt that handwriting was a dying art form, and through this project herself and Edel O Reilly Flynn strived to reawaken it. This small exhibition then travelled to New York, which encouraged a more international group of participants. The project was intended to create a social document of Ireland at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2007/1106/breaking84.html |title=Tue, Nov 06, 2007 – Postcard art exhibition plan unveiled |publisher=The Irish Times |date=11 November 2007 |accessdate=6 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the success of the C Both Sides project, [[An Post]] decided to sponsor the project, which allowed it to reach a wider audience on a national and to an extent an international audience.&lt;ref name="irishtimes2007"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2007/1106/breaking84.html |title=Postcard art exhibition plan unveiled – The Irish Times – Tue, Nov 06, 2007 |publisher=The Irish Times |date=6 November 2007 |accessdate=6 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch of [[An Post]] C Both Sides, a 12-month project, took place in November 2007 at the Gallery of Photography, Meeting House Square in Temple Bar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anpostcbothsides.ie/index.php?item_id=187 |title=An Post |publisher=Anpostcbothsides.ie |date= |accessdate=6 October 2010 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was launched by the Chief Executive of [[An Post]], Donal Connell, who spoke of the lost art of postcards.&lt;ref name="epoch-archive2007"&gt;http://epoch-archive.com/a1/en/ie/nnn/2007/11-Nov/15/ET141107009.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="westmeathexaminer2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westmeathexaminer.ie/news/roundup/articles/2007/11/17/27526-mullingar-art-idea-goes-national--so-get-drawing/ |title=Mullingar art idea goes national – so get drawing! – News – Roundup – Articles – Westmeath Examiner |publisher=Westmeathexaminer.ie |date=24 November 2007 |accessdate=6 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teresa Doyle also made a moving speech about the beginning of Ireland's largest collaborative art exhibition.&lt;ref name="westmeathexaminer2007"/&gt; [[Craig Doyle]], an Irish television personality was on hand to launch the project too.

==Workshops==
Each month had a different theme, which guided the participants when creating a postcard.&lt;ref name="irishtimes2007"/&gt; During the year Teresa Doyle and Edel O Reilly Flynn, with the help of Ursula Meehan held workshops based on the theme of the month. In July, for example, the theme was prisoners. The artists held a workshop in Limerick Prison with some of the inmates. The theme for August was migration and keeping with this a workshop was held in Ilac Centre City Library, with a group of migrants. Postcards were an ideal medium as the people who have moved to Ireland have would use post as a way of communicating with their families in their home country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2008/0728/1217013341477.html |title=Migrants put thoughts into designing postcards as part of An Post scheme – The Irish Times – Mon, Jul 28, 2008 |publisher=The Irish Times |date=28 July 2008 |accessdate=6 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fomacs.org/blog_detail.php?month=July%202008 |title=Forum on Migration and Communications |publisher=FOMACS |date= |accessdate=6 October 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726061213/http://www.fomacs.org/blog_detail.php?month=July%202008# |archive-date=26 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar workshops were held throughout the country for other themes. From the monthly entrants, twelve were chosen and displayed on the C Both Sides website. Each month there was a celebrity invited to make a postcard, which was also featured on the website along with a short interview based on the topic of postcards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anpostcbothsides.ie/index.php?item_id=1159 |title=An Post |publisher=Anpostcbothsides.ie |date= |accessdate=6 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608111410/http://www.anpostcbothsides.ie/index.php?item_id=1159 |archivedate=8 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Project==
With [[An Post]]'s sponsorship, the project was rolled out. Each household in Ireland received a blank postcard. The participants were encouraged to consider "both sides" of the postcard. This highlighted the importance of the recipient and the message as well
as the visual aspects of the postcard. In total over 3,000 submissions were received from throughout the world, of which 250 were chosen, by a panel, to be displayed. Helen Carey was the curator of the exhibition.&lt;ref name="anpostcbothsides.ie"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anpostcbothsides.ie/index.php?item_id=1124 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608111358/http://www.anpostcbothsides.ie/index.php?item_id=1124 |archivedate=8 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibition==
The final culmination of a year’s hard work was the opening of the exhibition in the Dublin Civic Offices, on Wood Quay. Noted travel writer and broadcaster, [[Manchán Magan]] opened the exhibition. He too participated in the project as he sent postcard from his travels to Spain and Peru.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/magazine/2009/0328/1224243360052.html | work=The Irish Times | title=Postcards from home | date=3 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The postcards were displayed in pigeonholes that used to integral to the sorting of post before the new mechanised sorting machines. The use of the pigeonholes allowed for the viewer of the exhibition to view "both sides" of the postcard. The pigeonholes were fitted with clear Perspex frames, which were mounted on a rotating spindle. This allowed the viewer to see "both sides" of the postcard, and thus creating an interactive element to the exhibition. This innovative way of displaying the postcards was designed by Fiona Coffey.&lt;ref name="anpostcbothsides.ie"/&gt;

==Touring==
The exhibition in 2009, toured throughout Ireland, visiting:
Dublin Civic Offices 30 March – 9 April 2009
[[Siamsa Tíre]], Tralee 20 April – 2 May 2009
The Linnenhall, Castlebar 2–13 June 2009
Galway Museum 22 June – 4 July
and finally returning home to the Mullingar Arts Centre, Westmeath 15 July – 1 August.

The '''Catholic Art Association''' (CAA) was founded in 1937 by [[Esther Newport|Sister Esther Newport]] as an organization of artists, art educators and others interested in [[Catholic]] art and its philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

  | isbn = 0-8018-6805-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CAA published the ''[[Catholic Art Quarterly]]'', sponsored annual conventions, and hosted workshops until the organization dwindled and eventually dissolved in 1970.

==History==
In 1936, Sister Esther Newport saw a need for improved art education in [[Catholic school]]s and for a set of standards regarding [[Roman Catholic art|ecclesiastical art]]. She drew up an initial proposal for a '''Catholic College Art Association''' that year but did not find much support at that time. After a Peter Boswell column in the March 1937 issue of ''Art Digest'' addressed similar issues in Catholic art, Newport revisited her idea and sent it to Boswell. He in turn gave the proposal publicity in his April 1937 column and helped to garner public support for the organization.&lt;ref name="Murphy"&gt;{{Cite book

  | id = 
  | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newport then called for an organizational meeting at [[Providence-St. Mel|Providence High School]] in [[Chicago]]. There she and other interested parties founded the Catholic College Art Association and planned for its first general meeting that October on the campus of the [[Sisters of Providence of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods]] in Indiana.&lt;ref name="newLights"&gt;{{cite book | title=New Lights from Old Truths: Living the Signs of the Times | author=Abbott, Maureen | year=2013 | isbn=9780989739719}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophical foundation===
Newport enlisted art critic and philosopher [[Graham Carey (artist)|Graham Carey]] to provide an underlying foundation for the CAA. Carey was already known for his "Catholic Philosophy of Art" and agreed to be an advisor to the organization and to speak at its first general meeting. Carey would go on to be a prominent voice in the CAA, advocating for the integration of social thinking with art and religion.&lt;ref name="Murphy" /&gt;

The Association was unique in its inclusion of women in the fields of art and architecture. Besides the presence of Newport and many Catholic sisters, the CAA employed three women as its executive secretaries. It also worked closely with lay liturgical artist [[Ade Bethune]], co-founder of the [[Catholic Worker Movement]],&lt;ref name="Harmon"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yilLFOeK63wC | title=There Were Also Many Women There: Lay Women in the Liturgical Movement in the United States, 1926-1959 | publisher=Liturgical Press | author=Harmon, Katherine E. | year=2013 | isbn=0814662714}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hildreth Meiere]], who helped to found the Liturgical Arts Society.&lt;ref name="Price"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f8yCTQE4eZsC | title=Temples for a Modern God: Religious Architecture in Postwar America | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Price, Jay M. | year=2013 | isbn=9780199925957}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Celtic cross''' is a form of [[Christian cross]] featuring a [[halo (religious iconography)|nimbus]] or ring that emerged in [[Ireland]] and [[Great Britain|Britain]] in the [[Early Middle Ages]]. A type of [[ringed cross]], it became widespread through its use in the stone [[high cross]]es erected across the islands, especially in regions evangelized by [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Irish missionaries]], from the 9th through the 12th centuries.

A staple of [[Insular art]], the Celtic cross is essentially a [[Latin cross]] with a nimbus surrounding the intersection of the arms and stem. Scholars have debated its exact origins, but it is related to earlier crosses featuring rings. The form gained new popularity during the [[Celtic Revival]] of the 19th century; the name "Celtic cross" is a convention dating from that time. The shape, usually decorated with [[Interlace (art)|interlace]] and other motifs from Insular art, became popular for funerary monuments and other uses, and has remained so, spreading well beyond Ireland.

==Early history==

[[File:032Galarus Oratory.JPG|thumb|Early forms: pillar stone, [[Gallarus Oratory]], [[County Kerry]], Ireland]]

[[Ringed crosses]] similar to older Continental forms appeared in Ireland and Scotland in incised stone slab artwork and artifacts like the [[Ardagh chalice]]. However, the shape achieved its greatest popularity by its use in the monumental stone [[high cross]]es, a distinctive and widespread form of [[Insular art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Herren |first=Michael W. |last2= Brown|first2= Shirley Ann |year= 2002|title= Christ in Celtic Christianity: Britain and Ireland from the Fifth to the Tenth Century|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZFqNUMa8bfYC&amp;pg=PA199&amp;dq=%22Celtic+cross%22+origin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjWh6uw2OrPAhWG4iYKHRZDDrs Q6AEINTAE#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Celtic%20cross%22%20origin&amp;f=false |publisher= Boydell Press|pages= 193–195|isbn=0851158897}}&lt;/ref&gt; These monuments, which first appeared in the 9th century, usually (though not always) take the form of a ringed cross on a stepped or pyramidal base.&lt;ref name=Herren1&gt;{{cite book |last= Herren |first=Michael W. |last2= Brown|first2= Shirley Ann |year= 2002|title= Christ in Celtic Christianity: Britain and Ireland from the Fifth to the Tenth Century|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZFqNUMa8bfYC&amp;pg=PA199&amp;dq=%22Celtic+cross%22+origin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjWh6uw2OrPAhWG4iYKHRZDDrsQ6AEINTAE#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Celtic%20cross%22%20origin&amp;f=false |publisher= Boydell Press|page= 199|isbn=0851158897}}&lt;/ref&gt; The form has obvious structural advantages, reducing the length of unsupported side arms.&lt;ref&gt;Werner, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of theories as to its origin in Ireland and Britain. Some scholars consider the ring a holdover from earlier wooden crosses, which may have required struts to support the crossarm. Others have seen it as deriving from indigenous Bronze Age art featuring a wheel or disc around a head, or from early [[Coptic cross]]es based on the [[ankh]]. However, Michael W. Herren, Shirley Ann Brown, and others believe it originates in earlier ringed crosses in [[Christian art]]. Crosses with a ring representing the [[celestial sphere]] developed from the writings of the [[Church Fathers]]. The "cosmological cross" is an important motif in [[Coelius Sedulius]]'s poem ''[[Carmen Paschale]]'', known in Ireland by the 7th century.&lt;ref name=Herren2&gt;{{cite book |last= Herren |first=Michael W. |last2= Brown|first2= Shirley Ann |year= 2002|title= Christ in Celtic Christianity: Britain and Ireland from the Fifth to the Tenth Century|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZFqNUMa8bfYC&amp;pg=PA199&amp;dq=%22Celtic+cross%22+origin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjWh6uw2OrPAhWG4iYKHRZDDrsQ6AEINTAE#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Celtic%20cross%22%20origin&amp;f=false |publisher= Boydell Press|pages= 199–200|isbn=0851158897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not clear where the first high crosses originated. The first examples date to about the 9th century and occur in two groups: at [[Ahenny]] in Ireland, and at [[Iona]], an Irish monastery off the Scottish coast. The Ahenny group is generally earlier. However, it is possible that St. Johns Cross at Iona was the first high cross; Iona's influence as a center of pilgrimage may have led this cross to inspire the Ahenny group as well as other ringed crosses in [[Pictish stone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Werner, pp. 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of crosses bear inscriptions in [[ogham]]: an early medieval Irish alphabet. Standing crosses in Ireland and areas under Irish influence tend to be shorter and more massive than their Anglo-Saxon equivalents, which have mostly lost their headpieces. Irish examples with a head in cross form include the Cross of [[Kells, County Meath|Kells]], [[Ardboe High Cross]], the crosses at [[Monasterboice]], the Cross of the Scriptures, [[Clonmacnoise]] and those in Scotland at [[Iona]] and the [[Kildalton Cross]], which may be the earliest to survive in good condition. Surviving, free-standing crosses are in [[Cornwall]], including [[St Piran]]'s cross at [[Perranporth]], and [[Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;Langdon, Arthur G. (1896) Old Cornish Crosses. Truro: J. Pollard&lt;/ref&gt; Other stone crosses are found in the former [[Northumbria]] and [[Scotland]], and further south in England, where they merge with the similar Anglo-Saxon cross making tradition, in the [[Ruthwell Cross]] for example. Most examples in Britain were destroyed during the [[Protestant Reformation]]. By about A.D. 1200 the initial wave of cross building came to an end in Ireland.

Popular legend in Ireland says that the Christian cross was introduced by [[Saint Patrick]] or possibly [[Saint Declan]], though there are no examples from this early period. It has often been claimed that Patrick combined the symbol of Christianity with the [[sun cross]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;to give pagan followers an idea of the importance of the cross. By linking it with the idea of the life-giving properties of the sun, these two ideas were linked to appeal to pagans. Other interpretations claim that placing the cross on top of the circle represents Christ's supremacy over the pagan sun.

== Modern times ==

===Celtic Revival===
The [[Celtic Revival]] of the mid-19th century led to an increased use and creation of Celtic crosses in Ireland. In 1853, casts of several historical high crosses were exhibited at the Dublin Industrial Exhibition. In 1857, [[Henry O'Neill (illustrator)|Henry O'Neill]] published ''Illustrations of the Most Interesting of the Sculptured Crosses of Ancient Ireland''. These two events stimulated interest in the Celtic cross as a symbol for a renewed sense of heritage within Ireland.

New versions of the high cross were designed for fashionable cemetery monuments in Victorian Dublin in the 1860s. From Dublin, the revival spread to the rest of the country and beyond. Since the Celtic Revival, the ringed cross became an emblem of Celtic identity, in addition to its more traditional religious symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.celtarts.com/revival_crosses.htm Stephen Walker, "Celtic Revival Crosses"], Celtic Arts website, accessed 22 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern interest in the symbol increased because of Alexander and Euphemia Ritchie. The two worked on the Isle of [[Iona]] in Scotland from 1899 to 1940 and popularised use of the Celtic cross in jewelry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alexander-ritchie.co.uk/history.htm "A Brief History of the Ritchies"], Alexander Ritchie website, accessed 20 Nov 208&lt;/ref&gt; Using the Celtic cross in fashion is still popular today.

&lt;/Gallery&gt;

Since its revival in the 1850s, the Celtic cross has been used extensively as grave markers. Straying from medieval usage, when the symbol was typically used for a public monument. The Celtic cross now appears in various retail items. Both the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] and the [[Northern Ireland national football team]] have used versions of the Celtic cross in their logos and advertising. The [[Church in Wales]] since 1954 have used a flag with a Celtic cross in the centre.

'''''Chadam''''' is an animated web series by artist [[Alex Pardee]] based on characters he created for a number of [[The Used]]'s album artwork and distributed by [[The WB]] and [[Alex Pardee|Eye Suck Ink]]. ''Chadam'' is produced by [[Jason "Jace" Hall]] of HDFILMS Inc. The short series premiered June 15, 2010 on TheWB.com. [[The WB]] and its children's network, [[Kids WB!]] is closed, but the website is still open. ''Chadam'' appeared on the cover of ''[[Lies for the Liars]]''. The episodes are nearly 4 to 5 minutes long. [[iTunes]] has the episodes in a collection called ''Chadam, the Complete Series''. [[iTunes]] episodes are nearly the 13 minute mark because two short episodes are built into one, for example, "Cut from Cardboard" and "Ripley, Believe It or Not" are put together as "The Awakening".

Hall pushed the boundaries of traditional filmmaking by using a computer game engine, [[Unreal Engine 3]], in order to meet the challenge of animating Pardee's surreal work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Hsu | first = Jeremy | title = Gaming Software Offers Cheap Alternative to Hollywood Animation Tools | work = InnovationNewsDaily | date = 2011-04-13 | url = http://www.innovationnewsdaily.com/games-take-aim-big-budget-hollywood-animation-1893/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Christ as the Suffering Redeemer'''''  is a painting by the Italian Renaissance artist [[Andrea Mantegna]], dated to c. 1488-1500 and housed in the [[Statens Museum for Kunst]], Copenhagen, Denmark.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==History==
The work is generally assigned to Mantegna's stay in Rome, due to stylistic similarities with the ''[[Madonna of the Quarry]]'', although other art historians considered it from the 1490s.

The painting appears in an inventory of the [[Gonzaga family]] from 1627, and it belonged to cardinal [[Silvio Valenti Gonzaga]] in 1763 when it became part of the Danish Royal, having been acquired by King [[Frederick IV of Denmark]] to make his collection equal to those of other European reigning families.

==Description==
The painting is signed on the edge of the marble base and his an original version of the traditional ''[[Pietà]]'' theme. Christ, portrayed with open hands to show all the wounds of the crucifixion, is raised on finely sculpted ancient sarcophagus.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

His body is wrapped in a metallic white drape, and his supported by two kneeling angels (a [[seraphim]] and a [[cherubim]]). On the left the tomb's cover is visible, while the background is occupied by a far landscape under the sunset light. On the right is the [[Calvary]] and a quarry in which two men are working a slab, a column and a statue. Two further workers can be seen in a grotto, illuminated by an internal source of light.  Finally, on the left are fields with shepherds and cattle and a walled city, [[Jerusalem]], at the feet of a rocky spur. Two pious women run a path to reach Jesus' tomb.

Cărturești Carusel is a bookstore on [[Lipscani]] 55 Street in the old town of [[Bucharest]], [[Romania]].

The building that currently houses the bookstore was built at the beginning of the 20th century by the Chrissoveloni bankers family. During the first few decades of its existence the building housed the Chrissoveloni Bank headquarters, and afterwards it became a general store. At the end of the 1990s and early 2000s the building fell into decay, up until 2015 when a 5 year long rehabilitation, strengthening and conversion project was complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wall-street.ro/special/cladiri-emblema-ale-romaniei/179664/povestea-carturesti-carusel-mega-libraria-de-800-000-euro-din-lipscani-fotografii-din-seara-dinaintea-deschiderii.html|title=Cărturești Carusel în avanpremieră: o librărie spectacol, amenajată cu 400.000 euro (FOTO)|date=11 February 2015|website=Wall-Street.ro|publisher=|access-date=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''design change''' is the modification conducted to the [[product (business)|product]]. It can happen at any stage in the [[product development]] process.

The design changes that happen early in the [[design]] process are less expensive when compared to those that take place after it is introduced into full-scale production. The cost of the change increases with its development time. Fundamentally, the design changes can be classified into pre production and post production design changes. The pre-production changes can happen in the [[conceptual design]] stage, [[prototype]] stage, detailing stage, testing stage. The post -production stage change will happen almost immediately the product is introduced into the production. This might be due to several reasons such as [[market response]], [[design fault]]s uncovering, design mistakes, not meeting customer requirements, so on and so forth. One of the tools to minimize this type of design change is [[House of Quality]].

The '''Ducal Palace of Vila Viçosa''' ({{lang-pt|Paço Ducal de Vila Viçosa}}) is a royal palace in Portugal, located in the [[freguesia|civil parish]] of [[Nossa Senhora da Conceição (Vila Viçosa)|Nossa Senhora da Conceição]], in the [[concelho|municipality]] of [[Vila Viçosa Municipality|Vila Viçosa]], in the [[Alentejo]], situated about 150 km (93 miles) east of the capital [[Lisbon]]. It was for many centuries the seat of [[House of Braganza]], one of the most important noble houses in Portugal which was the ruling house of the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] from 1640 until 1910 when King [[Manuel II of Portugal|Manuel II]], titular head of the family, was deposed in the [[5 October 1910 Revolution]] which brought in a Republican government.

==History==
[[File:Paço dos Duques de Bragança em Vila Viçosa - Porta dos Nós.jpg|thumb|235px|left|Early example of the Manueline style of the original Palace before reconstruction]]
[[File:Vila Viçosa September 2013-1a.jpg|thumb|235px|left|The statue of John, 6th Duke of Braganza|João I, 6th Duke of Braganza]]
[[File:Vila Viçosa-Palais des Duc de Bragance-1967 08 05.jpg|thumb|235px|left|Tree-lined roadway to the palace, part of the remodelled grounds]]
[[Vila Viçosa]] became a [[fiefdom]] of the [[Dukes of Braganza]] when [[Fernando I of Braganza]] succeeded his father [[Afonso, 1st Duke of Braganza]], and received the title of [[Count of Arraiolos]] from his grandfather, [[Nuno Alvares Pereira]]. Fernando I established his seat at the primitive [[Castelo de Vila Viçosa|Vila Viçosa Castle]]. However, following the 1483 execution of his son, [[Fernando II of Braganza|Fernando II, 3rd Duke of Braganza]], for treason by order of King [[John II of Portugal]], the family was exiled to the [[Kingdom of Castile]]. Returning in 1498 (after the death of King John II in 1495), the family regained its ancestral lands, although [[Jaime, Duke of Braganza|Jaime, 4th Duke of Braganza]] (Fernando II's successor), declined to live in the Castle of Vila Viçosa, owing to its association with his father's betrayal and murder.

Construction of the ducal palace of the Dukes of Braganza began during the tenure of Duke Jaime of Braganza, between 1501–1502.&lt;ref name="SIPA"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.monumentos.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=2750 |title=Paço Ducal de Vila Viçosa (v.PT040714030009) |publisher=SIPA – Sistema de Informação para o Património Arquitectónico |editor=SIPA |location=Lisbon, Portugal|language=Portuguese|first=Castro |last=Nunes|year=1993 |accessdate=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IGESPAR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igespar.pt/en/patrimonio/pesquisa/geral/patrimonioimovel/detail/70205/|title=Paço Ducal de Vila Viçosa|editor=IGESPAR|accessdate=6 April 2012|year=2006|location=Lisbon, Portugal|publisher=IGESPAR – Instituto de Gestão do Património Arquitectónico e Arqueológico|language=Portuguese|first=Catherine|last=Oliveira|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130416224802/http://www.igespar.pt/en/patrimonio/pesquisa/geral/patrimonioimovel/detail/70205/|archivedate=16 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was situated in the ''Horta do Reguengo'' outside the walls of the nearby medieval village, in an area that was ''"characterized by extensive olive orchards and an abundance of water"'', presenting some similarities to the feudal residences of the region, such as the ''Sempre Noiva'' or ''Paço de Alvito''.&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;José Teixeira (1997), pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; The House of Braganza regained much of its power and wealth over time due to Duke Jaime's close kinship with the royal family (he being the nephew of King [[Manuel I of Portugal]]) and his actions in reconciling relations between the nobles. Duke Jaime of Braganza commanded the victorious expedition to Azamor in 1513, and having secured a pardon expanded the wealth of the House of Braganza, and contributed to the growth of the ducal palace.

In 1535 [[Teodósio I, 5th Duke of Braganza]] was appointed ''Constable of the Kingdom''.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; He managed to negotiate the marriage of his sister, [[Isabella of Braganza, Duchess of Guimarães|Isabella of Braganza]], with  [[Infante Edward, 4th Duke of Guimarães]] (a brother of King [[John III of Portugal]]), securing a closer association with the royal family.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;  Following the need to expand the palace for the celebrations of the royal marriage, Teodósio I began the construction of the imposing facade,{{clarify|date=April 2018|which facade?}} faced with marble in the Italianate-style, and in 1558 began the installation of the ''Sala de Música'' (''Hall of Music'').&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; As Rafael Moreira (1997) indicated, the first building was a designed and decorated in the [[Manueline]] style, and was remodelled in classical lines, along with the adjacent buildings and the expansion of the square in front of the building.&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rafael Moreira (1997), p.&amp;nbsp;50&lt;/ref&gt; It was inspired by the profile of the [[Ribeira Palace]] in Lisbon.&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rafael Moreira (1997), p.&amp;nbsp;51&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive remodeling later occurred in 1566, during the tenure of [[João I, Duke of Braganza|João I, 6th Duke of Braganza]].&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; 

It was the 7th Duke, [[Teodósio II, 7th Duke of Braganza|Teodósio II]], who in 1583 began the grand works of the classical facade, completed in 1635 during the regency of King [[John IV of Portugal]],&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; formerly Duke of Braganza. In 1602, Teodósio II married the Spanish noblewoman [[Ana de Velasco y Girón]], hoping to produce heirs. In commemoration of the marriage a composition of [[azulejo]] tiles by Fernando Loyaza, known as the ''Talavera de la Reina'', was installed in the ''Sala Grande'' (''Great Hall'').&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt;&lt;ref name="José Teixeira 1997, p. 11"&gt;José Teixeira (1997), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; The ''Talavera de la Reina'' azulejos in the Great Hall are the only ones of the type to survive in their original setting, after the destruction of [[Guadalajara, Castilla-La Mancha|Guadalajara]], in 1937 during the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;/ref&gt;  The whole project of the classical facade was firstly executed by Nicolau de Frias, royal architect, but was later supplemented by Pedro Vaz Pereira and Manuel Pereira Alvenéo.&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt;&lt;ref name="José Teixeira 1997, p. 11"/&gt;  The monumental facade was completed in the [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] style, consisting of two floors, one with Tuscan capitals, the other with Ionic capitals. Later, in 1610, construction began of an additional third floor.&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt;
In about 1611 the fireplace in the ''Sala de Medusa'' (''Medusa's Hall'') was designed and constructed by Pêro Vaz Pereira.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; Following the 1640  ascension of [[John V of Portugal|João II, 8th Duke of Braganza]] to the throne of Portugal as King John IV, the palace lost its importance as the permanent residence of the Dukes of Braganza.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

The first new remodelling to the Palace occurred in the 18th century, with the installation of an organ in the chapel. In 1716 King John V began minor renovations. Later, in 1762 under Queen [[Maria I of Portugal]],&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt; the construction began of the main tower fronting the Duchess's Garden (or ''Forest Garden'') and of a new wing, formally designated as the ''Quartos Novos'' (''New Quarters''). This included the ''Sala de Jantar'' (''Dining Hall''), which along with the other works, was finally completed under her successor, King [[Joseph I of Portugal]] in 1770.

During the Napoleonic invasion of the Iberian peninsula, the Portuguese royal family fled to [[Brazil]], and the palace was closed.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

Long after the return of the royal family to Portugal, King [[Carlos I of Portugal]] and his wife [[Amélie of Orleans]] began the renovations of the ''New Quarters'', to the designs of the Frenchman Negrier, in order to serve as their residence.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt; After a period of living in these quarters as his semi-official residence, on 1 February 1908 King Carlos I returned with his family to Lisbon, where he was later [[Lisbon Regicide|assassinated]].&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt;

On [[5 October 1910 Revolution|5 October 1910]] a revolution, instigated by Republican sympathizers, caused the royal family to flee to England and the residences of the monarchy were closed to the public.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt;

In 1932, whilst in exile, King [[Manuel II of Portugal]] died from an abnormal swelling in the throat. His will ordered the creation of a foundation to safeguard the royal estate, which led to the creation of the ''Fundação da Casa de Bragança'' (''House of Braganza Foundation'').&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt; As part of this process, a systematic inventory and assessment was undertaken of the contents of the Palace by the DGEMN (''Direcção Geral dos Edifícios e Monumentos Nacionais'', "General-Directorate for Buildings and National Monuments") completed in 1938.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; Between 1945 and 1952 the DGMEN initiated public works to restore the Palace after years of neglect, supplemented by repairs to the roof in 1963.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt;

It was not until 18 May 1984 that the palace was opened to the public, including  one of the largest and most varied permanent expositions of carriages in Europe.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

A re-tiling of the central wing was completed in 1985–1986, followed in 1989 by a similar project in the ''Ala dos Moços'' ("Children's Wing") in 1989.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

[[File:Vila Viçosa September 2013-25a.jpg|thumb|800px|centre|The completed horizontal profile of the Ducal Palace of the Braganzas. On the right, the tower of the Royal Chapel]]

==Architecture==
Located in the urban context of Vila Viçosa, the palace is situated on a stable plain at the foot of the castle hill. Rising {{convert|395|m|ft}} above this context, on a grand space, it fronts other historical buildings, including the Church of the Augustine Friars ({{lang-pt|Igreja dos Agostinhos}}), the Episcopal Palace ({{lang-pt|Paço do Bispo|links=no}}) and Convent of the Stigmata ({{lang-pt|Convento das Chagas|links=no}}).&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

The building consists of a grand rectangular profile, extending east to west, with three floors, and an irregular trapezoid structure to the north-south, with the roofing differently tiled above each of the spaces.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; The principal facade is fully lined with [[ashlar]] masonry and pink Estremoz marble, corresponding to the three respective floors and central pediment broken by two main doorways.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; The rest of the facades are broken by a series of rectangular windows, that harmoniously divide the surface in a rhythmic classic pattern, some with semi-circular pediments and framed cornices. [[Pilaster]]s and [[architrave]]s define the horizontal and vertical frames of many of the windows, giving the whole composition great sobriety and classicism.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

The ''Lady's Garden'' occupies a comparable space by the residence, consisting of symmetrical patterns interspersed with sculptures of ancient shells and royal cavalry.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

===Interior===
Access to the residence is made across the [[Lobby (room)|vestibule]]. From this space is the main marble staircase and marble walls, as well as a painted mural fresco representing the ''Tomada de Azamor'' (''Taking of Azamor'') in northern Africa in 1513 by Portuguese troops, commanded by James, Duke of Braganza. On the left-side is the disembarkation ({{lang-pt|Desembarque}}), to the centre the preparations of the encirclement ({{lang-pt|Preparativos do Cerco|links=no}}) and to the right the conquest of the fortress ({{lang-pt|Conquista da Praça|links=no}}).&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

In the first years of the 17th century, the palace received a decorative palette, considered "one of the richest group of fresco mural paintings encountered in Portuguese art".&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vítor Serrão (1997), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; The rooms in the Palace extend along the horizontal plane, with a single corridor linking the spaces, including the ''Sala das Tapeçarias'' (''Tapestry Hall''), with [[sillar]] covered in 17th-century polychromtic blue-and-white azulejo tile, white marble fireplace, tile floor, and vaulted ceiling with phytomorphic painting.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; Several of the main rooms include spaces with painted fresco ceilings, and 17th-century blue-and-white/yellow azulejo tile, such as the ''Sala do Gigante'' (''Hall of the Giant''), with 16th-century fresco depicting the biblical episode between [[David and Goliath]], which is framed by the arms of the Dukes of Braganza; the ''Oratório da Duquesa'' (''Duchess' Oratory''); and''Sala de Medusa'' (''Hall of Medusa''), with a painted fresco representing the battle between [[Medusa]] and [[Perseus]]. These group of paintings were''"largely faithful to the aesthetic canons of the Italianate Mannerists"''.&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt; The compositions are replent in Moorish-influenced motifs executed between 1600 and 1640 by different painters: Tomás Luís, famous Lisbon painter, was attributed to the ''"two notable mural [ceiling] decorations"'' in the ''Hall of Medusa'' and the gallery of Duchess Catherine and José de Avelar Rebelo painted the ceilings of the ''Music Pavilion''.&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vítor Serrão (1997), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;
The remainder of these rooms extend laterally through the accessway: the ''Sala de D. Duarte'' (''Edwards' Hall''), with a painted ceiling, with anthropomorphic elements and tiled floor; the ''Sala dos Duques'' (''Hall of the Dukes'') or ''Sala dos Tudescos'' is a noble salon and largest room in the building, decorated with frames of 17 Dukes of Braganza, from [[Joseph I of Portugal|Joseph I]]: the ''Sala das Virtues'' (''Hall of Virtues'') has an artesnal ceiling comprising framed paintings showing the seven theological virtues and morals, among them: ''Fé'' (''Faith''), ''Esperança'' (''Hope''), ''Caridade'' (''Charity''),''Prudência'' (''Prudence''), ''Justiça'' (''Justice''), ''Forteleza'' (''Strength''), ''Temperança'' (''Temperance'') and ''Sapiência'' (''Wisdom''); and the''Sala de Jantar'' (''Dining Hall'') there is a similarly paneled ceiling with medallions, decorated in classical and mythological motifs. The rooms five doorways give access to the ''Jardim das Damas'' (''Lady's Garden'').

A chapel, referred to as the ''Sala dos Paramento/Órgãos'' (''Hall of the Vestments/Organ'') is covered in a vaulted ceiling with comparably painted roof frames.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

The ''Pavilhão da Música'' (''Music Pavilion'') is an exceptional example: it consists of a painted wood ceiling, sillar with 17th-century azulejo tile depicting figures in panchromatic tiles in yellow, blue, green and red, representing the history of [[Book of Tobit|Tobit]] ({{lang-pt|Tobiãs}}) with the coat-of-arms of the Dukes of Braganza, and signed FIAB.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

In addition, there are several other "named" rooms in palace, including the ''Sala D. Duarte'' (''[[Edward of Portugal|D. Durate's Hall]]''), ''Sala D. Fernando II'' (''[[Ferdinand II of Portugal|Ferdinand's Hall]]''), ''Sala do Século 17'' (''17th-century Hall''), ''Sala da Restauração'' (''Restoration Hall''), ''Sala de Hércules'' (''Hall of Hercules''), ''Sala Dourada ou da Duquesa'' (''Golden Hall'' or ''Duchess Hall''), named for [[Catherine of Portugal|Catherine]] wife of the 6th Duke, the ''Sala da Cabra Cega'' (''Hall of the Blind Goat''); ''Sala Indo-Portuguesa'' (''Portuguese-India Hall''); ''Sala das Loiças'' (''Hall of Dishware''); ''Sala dos Vidros'' (''Hall of Glass''); ''Sala dos Reis'' (''Kings' Hall''); the armory; and the famous wing of the ''New Quarters'', named for the fact that it acted as the residence and studies for the King, with diverse antechambers, and corridors.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; Near the kitchen are the ovens, wine cellars, avery and storage spaces.

'''Eva Hesse''' (January 11, 1936 – May 29, 1970), was a German-born American sculptor, known for her pioneering work in materials such as [[latex]], [[fiberglass]], and plastics. She is one of the artists who ushered in the [[postminimal]] art movement in the 1960s. &lt;!-- Citation still needed for exact birth and death date--&gt;

==Life==
Hesse was born into a family of [[Judaism|observant Jews]] in [[Hamburg]], Germany, on January 11, 1936.&lt;ref name="EWB3657"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of World Biography|year=2004|publisher=Gale|location=Detroit|pages=365–367|edition=2nd|ref=Gale Virtual Reference Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;SFMOMA exhibit notes, 2002 for Hamburg; Danto 2006, p.32 for family being observant Jews.&lt;/ref&gt; When Hesse was two years old in December 1938, her parents, hoping to flee from [[Nazi Germany]], sent Hesse and her older sister, Helen Hesse Charash, to the Netherlands to escape Nazi Germany, aboard one of the last [[Kindertransport]] trains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sutton|first1=Benjamin|title=Finally, a Documentary About Eva Hesse’s Life and Work|url=https://hyperallergic.com/207327/finally-a-documentary-about-eva-hesses-life-and-work/|website=hyperallergic|publisher=hyperallergic|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vanessa Corby, {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GpKjAQFlBI8C&amp;pg=PA133|title=Eva Hesse: Longing, Belonging and Displacement|pages=133–37|publisher=Books.google.com|accessdate=2012-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After almost six months of separation, the reunited family moved to England and then, in 1939, emigrated to New York City,&lt;ref&gt;Lippard 1992, p. 6  and in the Chronology: THE ARTIST'S LIFE, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; where they settled into [[Manhattan]]'s [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]].&lt;ref name=Danto-32&gt;Danto 2006, p.32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lippard 1992, p. 6"&gt;Lippard 1992, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, Hesse's parents separated; her father remarried in 1945 and her mother committed suicide in 1946.&lt;ref name="Lippard 1992, p. 6"/&gt; In 1962, she met and married sculptor Tom Doyle (1928 - 2016); they divorced in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of World Biography Vol. 7|date=2004|publisher=Gale|location=Detroit|pages=365–367|edition=2nd|ref=Gale Virtual Reference Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1969, she was diagnosed with a [[brain tumor]], and she died on Friday, May 29, 1970. Her death, after three operations within a year,&lt;ref name="Eva Hesse"&gt;[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artists/bios/787 Eva Hesse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029204609/http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artists/bios/787 |date=2013-10-29 }} [[Solomon R.

==Career==
Hesse graduated from New York's [[School of Industrial Art]] at the age of 16, and in 1952 she enrolled in the [[Pratt Institute]] of Design. She dropped out only a year later.&lt;ref name="EWB3657"/&gt; When Hesse was 18, she interned at ''Seventeen'' magazine. During this time she also took classes at the [[Art Students League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theartstory.org/artist-hesse-eva.htm|title=The Art Story|website=The Art Story|access-date=March 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1954-57 she studied at [[Cooper Union]] and in 1959 she received her BA from Yale University.&lt;ref name="EWB3657"/&gt; While at Yale, Hesse studied under [[Josef Albers]] and was heavily influenced by [[Abstract Expressionism]].&lt;ref name="EWB3657"/&gt;&lt;ref name=SFMOMA&gt;SFMOMA exhibit notes, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tate.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web|title=Josef Albers, Eva Hesse, and the Imperative of Teaching  {{!}} Tate|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/research/publications/tate-papers/07/josef-albers-eva-hesse-and-the-imperative-of-teaching|website=www.tate.org.uk|accessdate=11 August 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Yale, Hesse returned to New York, where she became friends with many other young minimalist artists, including [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Donald Judd]], [[Yayoi Kusama]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nemser|first1=Cindy|title=My Memories of Eva Hesse|journal=Woman's Art Journal|date=2007|volume=28|issue=Spring-Summer|page=27|publisher=Old City Publishing, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her close friendship with Sol LeWitt continued until the end of her life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blantonmuseum.org/exhibitions/details/2286|title=Archived copy|accessdate=2014-08-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140817124820/http://blantonmuseum.org/exhibitions/details/2286|archivedate=2014-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two frequently wrote to one another, and in 1965 LeWitt famously counseled a young doubting Eva to "Stop [thinking] and just DO!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=S+ Stimulant: Sol LeWitt's advice to Eva Hessa Hesse|url=http://magazine.seymourprojects.com/2013/02/s-stimulant-sol-lewitts-advice-to-eva-hesse/|website=Seymour Magazine|accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Hesse and LeWitt went on to become influential artists, and their friendship aided in the artistic development of each of their works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mitchell|first1=Samantha|title=Converging Lines: Eva Hesse and Sol LeWitt|url=http://www.brooklynrail.org/2014/04/art_books/converging-lines-eva-hesse-and-sol-lewitt|website=The Brooklyn Rail Critical Perspectives on Arts, Politics, and Culture|publisher=Yale University Press|accessdate=April 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, Eva Hesse married fellow sculptor Tom Doyle, and in 1965, the two moved to Germany so that Doyle could pursue an artist residency from German industrialist and collector Friedrich Arnhard Scheidt.&lt;ref name="EWB3657"/&gt; Hesse and Doyle, whose marriage was falling apart,&lt;ref&gt;Lippard 1992, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; lived and worked in an abandoned textile mill in the [[Ruhr Area|Ruhr]] region of Germany for about a year. Hesse was not happy to be back in Germany,&lt;ref name="Lippard 1992, p. 24"&gt;Lippard 1992, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; but began working with materials that had been left behind in the abandoned factory. Their studio was set up in a disused part of Friedrich Arnhard Scheidt's textile factory in [[Kettwig|Kettwig-on-the-Ruhr]] near [[Essen]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} The building still contained machine parts, tools, and materials from its previous use and the angular forms of these disused machines and tools served as inspiration for Hesse’s mechanical drawings and paintings.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}  Her first sculpture was a relief titled'' Ring Around Arosie'' featured cloth-covered cord, electrical wire, and [[masonite]].&lt;ref name="EWB3657"/&gt; This year in Germany marked a turning point in Hesse's career. From this point on she would continue to make sculptures, which became the primary focus of her work. Returning to New York City in 1965, she began working and experimenting with the unconventional materials that would become characteristic of her work: [[latex]], [[fiberglass]], and plastic.&lt;ref name="tate.org.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theartscouncil.org/artists/eva-hesse/|title=Eva Hesse - The Arts Council|website=The Arts Council|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods, materials, and processes==
Hesse's early work (1960–65) consisted of abstract drawings and paintings.&lt;ref name="EWB3657"/&gt; She is most well known for her sculptures and because of this, her drawings are often regarded as preliminary steps to her later work.&lt;ref name="Corby12"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Corby|first1=Vanessa|title=New Encounters: Arts, Cultures, Concepts: Eva Hesse: Longing, Belonging and Displacement|date=2010|publisher=Tauris|location=London|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; She created her drawings as a separate body of work. She states, "They were related because they were mine but they weren’t related in one completing the other."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Corby|first1=Vanessa|title=New Encounters: Arts, Cultures, Concepts: Eva Hesse: Longing, Belonging, and Displacement|date=2010|publisher=Tauris|location=London, UK|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hesse’s interest in latex as a medium for sculptural forms had to do with immediacy. Keats states, "immediacy may be one of the prime reasons Hesse was attracted to latex".&lt;ref name="Mar 2011"/&gt; Hesse’s first two works using latex, ''Schema'' and ''Sequel'' (1967–68) use latex in a way never imagined by the manufacturer. "Industrial latex was meant for casting. Hesse handled it like house paint, brushing layer upon layer to build up a surface that was smooth yet irregular, ragged at the edges like deckled paper." &lt;ref name="Mar 2011"/&gt;

Hesse's work often employs multiple forms of similar shape organized together in grid structures or clusters. Retaining some of the defining forms of minimalism, modularity, and unconventional materials, she created eccentric work that was repetitive and labor-intensive. Her work "Contingent" from 1968 is an ideal example of this concept. In a statement of her work, Hesse describes her piece titled ''Hang-Up'', "It was the first time my idea of absurdity or extreme feeling came through...The whole thing is absolutely rigid, neat cord around the entire thing . . . It is extreme and that is why I like it and don't like it . . . It is the most ridiculous structure that I ever made and that is why it is really good".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sandler|first1=Irving|title=Art of The Postmodern Era|date=1996|publisher=HarperCollins|location=NY|isbn=0-06-438509-4|page=29|edition=first}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postminimalism and feminism==
Eva Hesse is associated with the [[postminimal]] [[art movement]]; one of the first artists who moved from [[minimalism]] to [[postminimalism]]. [[Arthur Danto]] distinguished post-minimalism from minimalism by its "mirth and jokiness" and "unmistakable whiff of eroticism," its "nonmechanical repetition".&lt;ref name=Danto-33&gt;Danto, 2006, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

She worked and sometimes competed with her male counterparts in post-minimalist art, a primarily male-dominated movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stoops|first1=Susan|title=More Than Minimal: Feminism and Abstraction in the 70's|year=1996|publisher=Brandeis University|location=Waltham, MA|pages=54–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many feminist art historians have noted her work successfully illuminates women’s issues while refraining from any obvious political agenda. She revealed, in a letter to Ethelyn Honig (1965), that a woman is "at disadvantage from the beginning… She lacks conviction that she has the ‘right’ to achievement. She also lacks the belief that her achievements are worthy”.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theories and Documents of Contemporary Art|last=Stiles|first=Kristine|publisher=University of California Press|year=2012|location=Berkeley, CA|page=705}}&lt;/ref&gt; She continued to explain that, “a fantastic strength is necessary and courage. I dwell on this all the time. My determination and will are strong but I am lacking so in self-esteem that I never seem to overcome”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She denied her work was strictly feminist, defending it as feminine but without feminist statements in mind. In an interview with Cindy Nemser for ''Woman's Art Journal'' (1970), she states, "Excellence has no sex."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nemser|first1=Cindy|title=My Memories of Eva Hesse|journal=Woman's Art Journal|date=2007|volume=28|issue=1|page=27|publisher=Old City Publishing, Inc.|jstor=20358108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visual and critical analysis==
Hesse's work often shows minimal physical manipulation of a material while simultaneously completely transforming the meaning it conveys. This simplicity and complexity has evoked controversy among art historians. Debate has focussed pieces are to be considered complete and finished works, and which are studies, sketches, or models for future works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schwabsky|first1=Barry|title=Eva Hesse|journal=Artforum|date=2010|issue=April|pages=205–206|publisher=Camden Arts Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hesse's drawings have been noted as precursory drafts to later sculptures, but Hesse herself disavowed any strong connection.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Her work is often described as anti-form, a term that describes the resistance to uniformity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Danto|first1=Arthur|title=All About Eva|journal=The Nation|date=2006|volume=24|issue=July|pages=30–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work embodies elements of minimalism in its simple shapes, delicate lines, and limited color palette.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fer|first1=Briony|title=Bordering on Blank: Eva Hesse and Minimalism|date=1994|volume=17|issue=3|pages=424–449|publisher=Blackwell Publishers|location=Oxford|issn=0141-6790|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8365.1994.tb00586.x|journal=Art History}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barry Schwabsky]] described her work for the Camden Arts Centre in London, "Things folded, things piled, things twisted, things wound and unwound; tangled things, blunt things to connect to; materials that have a congealed look, materials that seem lost or discarded or mistreated; shapes that look like they should have been made of flesh and shapes, that look like they might be made of flesh but should not have been – you can look at these things, these materials, these shapes, and feel the shudder of an unnamable nanosensation, or you can let your eye pass by them without reaction; maybe you can do both at once."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schwabsky|first1=Barry|title=Eva Hesse|journal=Artforum|date=2010|issue=April|page=206|publisher=Camden Arts Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of her work, and especially her drawings, are based on repetition and simple progressions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Ellen|title=Eva Hesse|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/hesse-untitled-t04151|website=Tate Britain|accessdate=April 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preservation of artworks==
Eva Hesse’s sculptures have been the subject of debate during attempts to understand how to preserve the pieces that have been deteriorating with the passage of time. Except for fiberglass, most of her favored materials age badly, so much of her work presents conservators with an enormous challenge. [[Arthur Danto]], writing of the Jewish Museum's 2006 retrospective, refers to "the discolorations, the slackness in the membrane-like latex, the palpable aging of the material… Yet, somehow the work does not feel tragic. Instead, it is full of life, of eros, even of comedy… Each piece in the show vibrates with originality and mischief."&lt;ref&gt;Danto, 2006, p.30–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, her work is damaged beyond presentation. For instance, ''Sans III'' can no longer be exhibited to the public because the latex boxes have curled in on themselves and crumbled. Hesse’s close friend [[Sol LeWitt]] argued for steps for active conservation, "She wanted her work to last ... She certainly didn't have the attitude that she would mutely sit by and let it disintegrate before her eyes."&lt;ref name="Mar 2011"&gt;Keats, John. "The Afterlife of Eva Hesse." Art &amp; Antiques Magazine. Art &amp; Antiques Magazine, March 31, 2011; accessed March 4, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; LeWitt's response is supported by many of Hesse’s other friends and colleagues. However, Hesse’s dedication to material and process contradicts her intention for these works to attain permanency. When discussing this topic with collectors in mind, she wrote, "At this point, I feel a little guilty when people want to buy it. I think they know but I want to write them a letter and say it's not going to last. I am not sure what my stand on lasting really is. Part of me feels that it’s superfluous and if I need to use rubber that is more important. Life doesn’t last; art doesn't last."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Danto|first1=Arthur|title=All About Eva|journal=The Nation|date=2006|volume=17|issue=24|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Her art is often viewed in the context of the many struggles of her life. This includes escaping from the Nazis, her parents' divorce, the suicide of her mother when she was 10, her failed marriage, and the death of her father. A 2016 documentary entitled ''Eva Hesse'', premiered in New York, illustrated her painful background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creativeplanetnetwork.com/news/shoot/portrait-artist-young-woman-documenting-innovation-and-influence-eva-hesse/614744|title=Portrait of the Artist as a Young Woman: Documenting the Innovation and Influence of Eva Hesse|last=Wolfe|first=Jennifer|date=2016-06-27|publisher=Creative Planet Network|accessdate=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Directed by Marcie Begleiter, the film tells the story of Hesse's "tragically foreshortened life". It "focuses on those years of artistic emergence, a period of rapid development and furious productivity, with few parallels in the history of art."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/27/movies/review-eva-hesse-documentary.html|title=Review: 'Eva Hesse' Offers a Moving Portrait of an Artist's Brief Life|last=Scott|first=A.O.|date=2016-04-26|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While experiences no doubt had profound impressions on Hesse, the true impact of her artwork has been her formal, artistic invention. For example, her inventive uses of material, her contemporary response to the [[minimalist]] movement, and her ability to usher in the postmodern and postminimalist art movements. Arthur Dano connects the two by describing her as "cop[ing] with emotional chaos by reinventing sculpture through aesthetic insubordination, playing with worthless material amid the industrial ruins of a defeated nation that, only two decades earlier, would have murdered her without a second thought."&lt;ref name=Danto-33/&gt;

Hesse was among the first artists of the 1960s to experiment with the fluid contours of the organic world of nature, as well as the simplest of artistic gestures. Some observers see in these qualities latent, proto-feminist references to the female body; others find in Hesse's languid forms expressions of wit, whimsy, and a sense of spontaneous invention with casually found, or "everyday" materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theartstory.org/artist-hesse-eva.htm|title=Eva Hesse Biography, Art, and Analysis of Works|work=The Art Story|access-date=2018-03-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent artists that have noted her as a primary influence include Japanese artist [[Eiji Sumi]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.bangkokpost.com/print/292461/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions==
In 1961, Hesse's gouache paintings were exhibited in Brooklyn Museum’s 21st International Watercolor Biennial. Simultaneously, she showed her drawings in the John Heller Gallery exhibition Drawings: Three Young Americans.&lt;ref name="Corby12"/&gt; In August 1962, she and Tom Doyle participated in an [[Allan Kaprow]] [[Happening]] at the [[Art Students League of New York]] in [[Woodstock, New York]]. In 1963, Hesse had a one-person show of works on paper at the Allan Stone Gallery on New York's [[Upper East Side]].&lt;ref&gt;Lippard 1992, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; Her first solo show of sculpture was presented at the Kunstverein für die Rheinlande und Westfalen, Düsseldorf, in 1965.&lt;ref name="Eva Hesse"/&gt; In November 1968, she exhibited her large-scale sculptures at the [[Fischbach Gallery]] in New York. The exhibition was titled ''Chain Polymers'' and was her only solo sculpture exhibition during her lifetime in the United States.&lt;ref name="Sussman and Wasserman, Preface"&gt;Sussman and Wasserman, Preface&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition was pivotal in Hesse's career, securing her reputation at the time.&lt;ref name="Sussman and Wasserman, Preface"/&gt; Her large piece ''Expanded Expansion'' showed at the [[Whitney Museum]] in the 1969 exhibit "Anti-Illusion: Process/Materials".&lt;ref name=Danto-30&gt;Danto, 2006, p.30.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been dozens of major posthumous exhibitions in the United States and Europe. An early one was at The [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] (1972),&lt;ref&gt;Lippard 1992, pp. 5, 128–29, 138, 180-82.&lt;/ref&gt; while In 1979, three separate iterations of an Eva Hesse retrospective were held, entitled ''Eva Hesse: Sculpture''. These exhibitions took place at the [[Whitechapel Art Gallery]] in London from May 4-June 17, 1979; the [[Kröller-Müller Museum|Kroller-Muller]] in [[Otterlo]] from June 30-August 5, 1979; and the Kestner-Gesellschaft in [[Hannover]] from August 17-September 23, 1979. One artwork featured in the exhibition was ''Aught,'' four double sheets of latex stuffed with polyethylene.&lt;ref&gt;[Artforum, Summer 1979. Page 6]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1992 and 1993, retrospective exhibitions were held in New Haven, Valencia and Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://museum-wiesbaden.de/en/eva-hesse|title=Eva Hesse - Museum Wiesbaden|website=museum-wiesbaden.de|access-date=2018-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st-century, there have been exhibitions in 2002 (organised jointly between the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]], [[Tate Modern]] and [[Museum Wiesbaden]] &lt;ref name="SFMOMA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/eva-hesse|title=Eva Hesse – Exhibition at Tate Modern {{!}} Tate|last=Tate|website=Tate|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Drawing Center]] in New York (2006) and the [[Jewish Museum (Manhattan)|Jewish Museum of New York]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thejewishmuseum.org/exhibitions/eva-hesse-sculpture|title=Eva Hesse: Sculpture|website=The Jewish Museum|access-date=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2006).&lt;ref name="Danto-30" /&gt; In Europe, Hesse had a posthumous exhibition in 2010 at the [[Fundació Antoni Tàpies]] in Barcelona.

==Concept==
Excessivism is a reflection, examination, or investigation of every aspect of life in excessive state with particular consideration to the areas that have real and consequential effect on the members of the society.  Subject areas are, but not limited to, economics, politics and psychology. In the area of economics it is a commentary on [[economic materialism]]. It reflects, examines and investigates the excessive desire to acquire material goods beyond one's needs and often means.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Excessivism depicts the excessive use of resources in an exaggerated way, by means of two- or three-dimensional visual creations, written or spoken words, or in any other manner. It aims at a reflection, examination, or investigation of the capitalist system, devoid of aesthetic, legal, commercial, ethical, moral, racial, or religious considerations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The goal of the capitalist system is to deliver profit for private investors, or corporations (without consideration of consequences including human and environmental), as contrasted to cooperatively or state-owned means of wealth. Said structure provides incomparable contribution to economic growth, employment and prosperity. According to [[determinism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Southern Cone Model: The Political Economy of Regional Capitalist Development in Latin America|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=w0N-AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=excessive+economic+determinism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=excessive%2520economic%2520determinism&amp;f=false|publisher = Routledge|date = 2004-08-02|isbn = 9781134327089|first = Nicola|last = Phillips}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Charting a New Course: The Politics of Globalization and Social Transformation|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5CEGwRutaEEC|publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield|date = 2001-01-01|isbn = 9780742508934|first = Fernando Henrique|last = Cardoso|first2 = Mauricio Augusto|last2 = Font}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Crafting Qualitative Research: Working in the Postpositivist Traditions|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KtDKBgAAQBAJ|publisher = Routledge|date = 2015-02-24|isbn = 9781317473695|first = Pushkala|last = Prasad}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Elgar Companion to Radical Political Economy|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=lc6b1Q1Kf1YC|publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing|date = 1994-01-01|isbn = 9781843768647|first = Philip|last = Arestis|first2 = Malcolm C.|last2 = Sawyer}}&lt;/ref&gt; freedom of choice is illusory and society is positioned to function as a reliable producer of excess, the lubricant of the capitalist engine.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==
The inaugural exhibition of Excessivism took place in LA Artcore Brewery Annex gallery with the title "Excessivist Initiative".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; And the Excessivism Manifesto was published in [[Downtown News]] weekly in September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[[Downtown News]], Excessivism Manifesto, September 28, 2015 page 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|url=http://www.survivorlibrary.com/library/architect_and_engineer_of_california_vol_22_1910.pdf |title=The Architect and Engineer of California Volume 22 |publisher=The Architect and Engineer Co. |date=August 1910 |accessdate=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an art critic Shana Nys Dambrot the idea was conceived in the studio of the founder based on his personal realizations of his relationship as a consumer with the capitalist environment.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;  Excessivism was introduced to the Los Angeles art scene in November 2014 in the Red Pipe gallery in an  exhibition titled ''Excess The New Norm''. It was curated by art critic, publisher and curator Mat Gleason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Red Pipe Gallery: Kaloust Guedel: Excess The New Norm|url=http://www.artslant.com/la/events/show/353832-excess-the-new-norm|publisher=ArtSlant|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Factory service manuals''' (FSM) are the manuals provided by manufacturers which cover the servicing, maintenance and repair of their products.  They were not originally offered to the public as they were developed for the dealerships so that their mechanics were able to fix their own products.

Many after-market manuals are available, with most of them referencing the FSM for topics such as torque specifications, dimensions and part numbers.

For vehicles, the following content are usually covered:
body, frame &amp; mounting, engine, suspension, [[Powertrain|driveline]], brake systems, [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]]/transaxle, clutch, chains, exhaust, fuel, steering, [[shock absorber|shocks]], climate control, instrumentation &amp; Warnings Systems, battery &amp; charging systems, audio, lighting, electrical distribution, and wiring.

[[File:Utrecht (province)-Flag.svg|thumb|right|250px|Flag of Utrecht (ratio 2:3)]]The '''flag of [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]]''' ({{lang-nl|vlag van Utrecht}}) has been in use since 1952. It consists of two horizontal stripes of equal width, the upper one white and the lower one red. Similar to the [[flag of Poland]] or an upside-down [[flag of Monaco]]. In the top left corner of the flag there is a red square with a white cross. The flag originates from two other flags, one part of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Utrecht|Archdiocese of Utrecht]], and the other of the (territorial) [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Utrecht#Roman Catholic archbishops after Restoration of the Episcopal Hierarchy|Archbishopric of Utrecht]]. In 1951 the province was advised by the Hoge Raad van Adel to adopt a flag to represent the province.

[[File:1922 John Singer Sargent - General Officers of World War I.jpg|thumb|400px|[[John Singer Sargent]], ''General Officers of World War I'', 1920-22.]]

'''''General Officers of World War I''''' (originally entitled ''Some General Officers of the Great War'') is an oil painting by [[John Singer Sargent]], completed in 1922.  It was commissioned by South African financier Sir [[Abraham Bailey, 1st Baronet]] to commemorate the generals who commanded British and British Empire armies in the First World War.

==Background==
Sargent was initially unwilling to take on such a large project, but took the commission in January 1919 and began work in August 1920, after he completed his similarly huge painting, ''[[Gassed (painting)|Gassed]]''.  He was also working on murals for the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]] in Boston, Massachusetts.

Sargent found it difficult to find a suitable composition for so many full-length portraits, and Sargent himself foresaw a "horrible failure".  The resulting painting is unsatisfactory,{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} with 22 men in khaki uniforms standing like pillars in a crowd in front of an anonymous brownish void, possibly an open doorway, with the bases of fluted pillars to either side.  Sargent described it as "painting them all standing up in a vacuum".  They look forward with blank stares, with no discernible purpose, almost as if each was unaware of the others around him.

The completed painting measures {{convert|118|xx|208|in|m}}. It was exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]] in 1922.

Bailey commissioned two other commemorative portraits, ''[[Statesmen of World War I]]'' by Sir [[James Guthrie (artist)|James Guthrie]], and ''[[Naval Officers of World War I]]'' by Sir [[Arthur Stockdale Cope]]. Bailey paid £5,000 for each of the three paintings and donated all three to the [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]].

==Generals==
The painting depicts 22 of the approximately 1,500 brigadier-generals, major-generals, lieutenant-generals, generals, and field marshals who served in the British and Imperial armies in the First World War.  All but two of the subjects reached the rank of at least lieutenant-general, and most were commanders of armies or army corps.  The only two divisional commanders are Major-General Lukin and Major-General Russell.

From left to right, they are:
* Field Marshal [[William Birdwood, 1st Baron Birdwood]] (commander of the [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps]] from 1914 to 1916, and of the [[British Fifth Army]] in 1918)
* Field Marshal [[Jan Smuts]] (commander of Imperial forces in east Africa in 1916)
* General [[Louis Botha]] (commander in southwest Africa) (blue lapel flashes)
* Field Marshal [[Julian Byng, 1st Viscount Byng of Vimy]] (commander of the [[British Third Army]] from 1917 to 1918)
* General [[Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baron Rawlinson]] (commander of the [[British Fourth Army]] from 1916 to 1918) (carrying a coat)
* Major-General Sir [[Henry Lukin]] (commander of the [[1st South African Infantry Brigade|South African Brigade]] from 1915 to 1916, and of the [[9th (Scottish) Division]] from 1916 to 1918)
* General Sir [[John Monash]] (commander of the [[Australian Corps]] from 1917 to 1918)
* General [[Henry Horne, 1st Baron Horne]] (commander of the [[British First Army]] from September 1917)
* Field Marshal [[George Milne, 1st Baron Milne]] (commander of British forces in Salonika from 1916 to 1918)
* Field Marshal [[Sir Henry Wilson, 1st Baronet]] ([[Chief of the Imperial General Staff]] from February 1918)
* Major-General Sir [[Andrew Hamilton Russell]] (commander of the [[New Zealand Division]] from 1916 to 1918)
* Field Marshal [[Herbert Plumer, 1st Viscount Plumer]] (commander of the [[British Second Army]] from 1915 to 1917 and in 1918) (white moustache)
* General Sir [[John Cowans]] ([[Quartermaster-General to the Forces]] from 1912 to 1919)
* Field Marshal [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig]] (commander-in-chief of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] in France from December 1915 to 1918) (with baton)
* Field Marshal [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres]] (commander-in-chief of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] in France in 1914 to December 1915) (with baton, wearing coat)
* Field Marshal Sir [[William Robertson (British Army officer)|William Robertson, 1st Baronet]] ([[Chief of the Imperial General Staff]] from December 1915 to February 1918)
* Lieutenant-General Sir [[Frederick Stanley Maude]] (commander of British forces in Mesopotamia from 1916 to his death in 1917)
* Field Marshal [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby]] (commander of the [[British Third Army]] in 1916 to 1917, and the [[Egyptian Expeditionary Force]] in the Middle East) (turning away, with sword)
* Lieutenant-General Sir [[William Marshall (British Army officer)|William Marshall]] (commander of British forces in Mesopotamia from 1917 to 1918)
* General Sir [[Arthur Currie]] (commander of the [[Canadian Corps]] from June 1917 to 1918) (carrying coat)
* Field Marshal [[Rudolph Lambart, 10th Earl of Cavan]] (commander of the [[Italian Tenth Army]] from March 1918) 
* General Sir [[Charles Macpherson Dobell]] (commander in Cameroon from 1914 to 1916, and then in the Middle East until 1917)

The generals are mostly British, but some representatives from the British Empire are also included: Field Marshal Smuts, General Botha and Major-General Lukin from South Africa, Generals Currie and Dobell from Canada, General Monash from Australia, and Major-General Russell from New Zealand.

A list of potential subjects was compiled by [[Evan Charteris]] and [[Lewis Vernon Harcourt, 1st Viscount Harcourt]] and approved by Bailey.  Some were deliberately omitted (for example, General [[Ian Standish Monteith Hamilton|Ian Hamilton]] was blamed for the failure at [[Gallipoli]] and left out).  Others prominent army commanders to be left out include [[Horace Smith-Dorrien]], [[Hubert Gough]], [[Sir Charles Monro, 1st Baronet|Charles Monro]], [[Richard Haking]], [[William Peyton]], [[Charles Kavanagh]], [[John Nixon (Indian Army officer)|John Nixon]], [[Percy Lake]], and [[Charles Vere Ferrers Townshend|Charles Townshend]]; administrative officers such as [[Stanley Brenton von Donop]], [[William Furse]], [[Nevil Macready]], [[George Macdonogh]], [[Ronald Charles Maxwell]] and [[Travers Clarke]], several Chiefs of the Imperial General Staff - [[Charles W. H. Douglas]], [[James Wolfe Murray]], and [[Archibald Murray]] - and army chiefs of staff, such as [[Charles Harington Harington|Tim Harington]], [[Archibald Montgomery-Massingberd]], [[Launcelot Kiggell]] and [[Herbert Lawrence]].  There are no officers from the Royal Flying Corps, such as [[Hugh Trenchard]], [[David Henderson (British Army officer)|David Henderson]] and [[John Salmond]], or the Tank Corps, such as [[Hugh Elles]].

'''Geumgang jeondo''' (금강전도 金剛全圖) is a famous landscape painted by [[Jeong Seon]] during the reign of [[Yeongjo of Joseon|King Yeongjo]]. The title literally means "General view of Mt. [[Kumgangsan|Geumgangsan]]" or The Diamond Mountains).&lt;ref name="Koreandb"&gt;{{cite web |title=Ideal of Korean people: Geumgang jeondo |url=http://www.koreandb.net/OldPaint/op_sansu07_1.htm |publisher=[[Empas]]/ [[EncyKorea]] |language=Korean |accessdate=2008-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512235729/http://www.koreandb.net/OldPaint/op_sansu07_1.htm |archivedate=2008-05-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was classified as the 217th [[National Treasures of South Korea|National Treasure of South Korea]] on August 6, 1984. The painting is currently held and managed by the [[Ho-Am Art Museum]] in [[Yongin]], [[Gyeonggi-do|Gyeonggi Province]] and is owned by [[Lee Kun-hee]].

While many contemporaneous painters imitated the latest art trends from China, Jeong Seon ignored these to create unique themes based on Korean landscapes.  His catalogue of paintings of Geumgansan made him famous and the preeminent painter of his time at the age of 37.  He eventually painted around 100 images of the mountains which still exist to this day.  The artist’s love of the mountains influenced other artists to depict the Diamond Mountains and even encouraged mapmakers to make maps of the area.

Although Jeong Seon made many paintings of Mt. Geumgangsan, this painting is the largest and considered his best.  Like many of his paintings, Jeong Seon painted this landscape while actually viewing the mountains.  The painting is 130.7 centimeters in height and 94.1 centimeters in width.  It is painted with India ink.  The painting is of Naegeumgang, the Inner Mt. Geumgangsan.  The painting depicts a total of twelve thousand peaks.  The highest peak, Birobong, lies in the background and water flows from it toward a valley called Manpokdong which is divided from the left and right. The high sharp peaks are depicted by the artist with lines painted up and down while the artist used a dotting brush method to depict the earthen peaks, making them appear relatively soft and lush.  This composition harmonizes the contrasting sharp edges of the rocky peaks with the softer earthen peaks.
  
The painter included the title of the painting, some comments, and his pen name, Gyeomjae, in the upper right hand corner.  The inscription also dates the painting to 1734 when Jeong Seon was 59 years old.  The artist’s comments reads: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Even if you visit the mountain yourself and tread on its every nook and cranny, how can your joy be compared with what you feel upon viewing this picture from your bedside?''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Henry VIII's writing desk''' is a portable [[writing desk]], made in about 1525-6 for [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. It is currently in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]].

The desk is a product of the royal workshops and is lavishly embellished with ornamental motifs introduced to the [[Kingdom of England]] by continental artists. The gilded leather lining is painted with figures and profile heads that are close in style to contemporary [[portrait miniature]]s, while the figures of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] in armour and [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] with cupid are taken from [[woodcut]]s by the German artist [[Hans Burgkmair]] (1473-1531), which were published in 1510. The desk also bears the [[coat of arms]] and personal badges of Henry and his first queen [[Catherine of Aragon]]. Such images conveyed powerful messages of allegiance and were used extensively in the decorative schemes of Henry VIII's royal palaces. The [[Latin]] inscription on the inner lid reads 'God of Kingdoms great Protector of the authority of the Christian Church give to your servant Henry VIII King of England a great victory over his enemies'. 

The exterior of the desk is covered with [[shagreen]] (possibly sharkskin) and fitted with metal-gilt angle-mounts, loop handles and ball feet, all added during the 18th century. The interior surfaces of the compartments are lined with red silk velvet, probably added during the 19th century. The writing surface and the large compartment have been relined very crudely with a crimson silk velvet, the appearance of which is considerably older than that of the red velvet.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1941">'''Interpretive communities''' are a theoretical concept stemming from [[reader-response criticism]] and publicized by [[Stanley Fish]] although it was in use in other fields and may be found as early as 1964 in the "Historical News and Notices" of the ''Tennessee Historical Quarterly'' (p.&amp;nbsp;98) and also, and again before Fish's usage, in Richard Crouter's 1974 "H. Reinhold Neibuhr and Stoicism" in ''The Journal of Religious Ethics''.
They appeared in an article by Fish in 1976 entitled "Interpreting the ''Variorum''".&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Fish, ''Is There A Text in This Class'', Harvard U. Press, (1980), 147–174&lt;/ref&gt; Fish's theory states that a text does not have meaning outside of a set of cultural assumptions regarding both what the characters mean and how they should be interpreted. This cultural context often includes [[Authorial intentionality|authorial intent]], though it is not limited to it. Fish claims that we as individuals interpret texts because each of us is part of an interpretive community that gives us a particular way of reading a text. Furthermore, he claims, we cannot know whether someone is a part of our interpretive community or not, because any act of communication that we could engage in to tell whether we are part of the same interpretive community would have to be interpreted. That is, because we cannot escape our interpretive community, we can never really know its limits.

The idea has been very influential in reader-response criticism, though it has also been very controversial. It is often interpreted as a relativistic standpoint that "words have no meaning," though this is not what Fish means. Quite the contrary, Fish is a staunch advocate of his own readings of various texts. Rather, he means to point out that readings of a text are culturally constructed.

== Life ==
Gropius was born in [[Braunschweig]], the son of Wilhelm Ernst Gropius and his wife Lucie (née Graeffer). When he was still a child the family moved to Berlin where his father opened a mask factory and shop.&lt;ref name="db"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wirth |first1=Irmgard |title=Gropius, Carl |url=https://www.deutsche-biographie.de/pnd11686625X.html |website=www.deutsche-biographie.de |publisher=Deutsche Biographie |accessdate=28 August 2018 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; After training under his father in his teens he travelled in Europe to broaden his artistic education. In [[Paris]] he became familiar with the [[Louis Daguerre#Diorama theatres|diorama theatre]] invented by [[Louis Daguerre]] and [[Charles Marie Bouton]].&lt;ref name="Meyerbeer1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Giacomo Meyerbeer|title=The Diaries of Giacomo Meyerbeer: The years of celebrity, 1850-1856|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NyPsNbLpntEC|accessdate=28 August 2018|year=1999|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press|isbn=978-0-8386-3844-6|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to Berlin he trained under the artist and architect [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]] as a [[landscape painter]]. From 1819 he worked as stage designer, artist and decorator for the ''Hoftheater'' (court theatre) and other Berlin theatres. In this capacity he designed inter alia the stage settings and backdrops for the premiere of ''[[Der Freischütz]]'' by [[Carl Maria von Weber]] which on 18 June 1821 opened the newly-rebuilt [[Schauspielhaus Berlin]], designed by his teacher Schinkel.&lt;ref&gt;Mark A Radice (ed.), 2003: ''Opera in Context: Essays on Historical Staging from the Late Renaissance to the Time of Puccini'' [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IesGLcf-2DMC&amp;pg=PA344&amp;lpg=PA344&amp;dq=gropius+ansichten&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=A-7WzLSo4d&amp;sig=PeiJN3H2AHQeeDotbTJ33j8jkfY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjO5JbzrYndAhWaOsAKHaMgBrgQ6AEwDHoECAEQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=gropius%20ansichten&amp;f=false (online version)]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--In 1846 he published a collection of views of different places, the fruits of his travels, in 12 parts. A collection of his decorative work in various architectural styles also appeared in 1846. - yet to find any confirmation of this--&gt;

He had many pupils, including [[Eduard Gaertner]] and [[:sv:Emil Roberg|Emil Roberg]].

In 1822 Gropius was elected a member of the [[Prussian Academy of Arts]].&lt;ref name="Meyerbeer1999" /&gt;

In 1836 he opened a factory producing ''[[:de:Steinpappe|Steinpappe]]'' ("stone paper"), which was basically [[papier maché]] strengthened with glue and [[precipitated calcium carbonate]] (or precipitate chalk; ''Schwämmkreide''). This set to a stonelike consistency that took gilding well and was extremely easy to shape and cut, and was thus ideal for Gropius' stage settings and interior decorations.&lt;ref name="etz"&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?isbn=3861532611 Arnold Etzold and Wolfgang Türk, 2002: ''Der Dorotheenstädtische Friedhof''. p.124.

Gropius died in Berlin on 20 February 1870 and was buried in the [[Neue Dorotheenstädtische Friedhof]].&lt;ref name="etz" /&gt;

==Family==
In 1820 Gropius married Claudine Coste (1801–1827), with whom he had three children:&lt;ref name="db" /&gt; Paul, who was also an artist and took over his father's businesses and succeeded him as the decorator and scenic artist in the ''Hoftheater'';&lt;ref name="db" /&gt; and two daughters, one of whom, Antonie, was the mother of the landscape artist [[:de:Paul Flickel|Paul Flickel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digishelf.de/objekt/733558798/99/ Ludwig Pietsch, ''"Waldlandschaft von Vilm" by Paul Flickel'' in ''Die deutsche Malerei der Gegenwart auf der Jubiläums-Ausstellung der Kgl.

The '''Madre della Consolazione''' (Crete) is an icon depicting the [[Virgin Mary]] holding baby [[Christ]]. It is believed to have originated during the mid-fifteenth century by [[Nikolaos Tzafouris]].

==Iconography==
The iconography of the Madre della Consolazione type is of Western origin.&lt;ref name=Evans&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OvCiDQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA483&amp;ots=4jncWiQyI6&amp;dq=Madre%20della%20Consolazione%20(Crete)%20%2B%20Nikolaos%20Tzafouris&amp;pg=PA483#v=onepage&amp;q=Madre%20della%20Consolazione%20(Crete)%20+%20Nikolaos%20Tzafouris&amp;f=false|title=Byzantium: Faith and Power (1261-1557)|last=[[Helen C. Evans|Evans]] |first=Helen C.|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, N.Y.)|page=483|date=March 28, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has clearly been influenced by Italian prototypes from the 14th century. The icon’s Italian title refers to the suffering of Christ, as anticipated by his mother. The type was probably introduced to the Orthodox-Christian world by the famous icon painter Nikolaos Tzafouris in the second half of the 15th century; his oeuvre is typified by combined Byzantine and Italian iconographical types. Our icon is painted in a highly refined style and can be dated in the late 15th century.

==Attribution==
Very similar floral punched motifs can be found in the halos of the signed Tzafouris [[Pieta]] icon in the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in Vienna and in the halos of the signed Tzafouris Madre della Consolazione icon in a Dutch private collection (currently on loan to the [[Ikonen-Museum Recklinghausen]], Germany). The punching, the specific iconography and the refined style of the painting, all point towards [[Nikolaos Tzafouris]] or a painter from his immediate circle.

==Location==
The icon was in the collection of [[Morsink Icon Gallery]], [[Amsterdam]] till 2016 and then was purchased by a private collector from the [[Netherlands]].

The '''''Magischer Zirkel der Deutschen Demokratischen Republik''''' (Magic Circle of the German Democratic Republic) was a national [[magic (illusion)|magicians']] association that was active in [[East Germany]] from 1956 to 1969, and again briefly in 1990.

== History ==

The organization was founded on 20 October 1956 following a meeting between Theo Bozenhard, Hans Marian, Hans Hander (Tosari), Hans-Gerhard Stumpf, and GDR Culture Minister [[Johannes R. Becher]].  Erich Kluge served as the organization's first chairman until January 1959, when he stepped down for reasons of ill health.  Hans Hander took over as interim leader, becoming first chairman on 12 January 1962 upon Kluge's death.  Siegfried Nitsche then served as first chairman from Hander's death in January 1968 until the organization was dissolved in December 1969.&lt;ref name="happel" /&gt;

Following the group's dissolution, magicians' associations in East Germany were confined to the local level.  In 1974 there were forty such associations, with a total membership of around 600.  By 1990 the number of associations had risen to 52.&lt;ref name="happel" /&gt;

On 11 November 1989, ten magicians convened in [[Leipzig]] and made an application to the Ministry of Culture to revive the ''Magischer Zirkel der DDR''.  Among the refounders were Hans-Georg Bucsi, Klaus Fürst, Hans-Gerhard Stumpf, and Annette Kirberg-Stumpf.  The association was officially re-established on 6 January 1990.  At its first conference on 10 March of that year, Hans-Gerhard Stumpf was elected president.  Within a few months, Stumpf and the managing directors of the association met with their [[West Germany|West German]] counterparts in the ''[[Magischer Zirkel von Deutschland]]'' to discuss unification of the two groups.  The merger was effected on 29 September 1990.&lt;ref name="happel" /&gt;

'''Man Ray''' (born '''Emmanuel Radnitzky'''; August 27, 1890&amp;nbsp;– November 18, 1976) was an American visual artist who spent most of his career in [[Paris]]. He was a significant contributor to the [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] movements, although his ties to each were informal. He produced major works in a variety of [[List of artistic media|media]] but considered himself a painter above all. He was best known for his photography, and he was a renowned [[fashion photography|fashion]] and portrait photographer. Man Ray is also noted for his work with [[photogram]]s, which he called "rayographs" in reference to himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,743589,00.html |title=Rayograms by Man Ray |work=Time |date=April 18, 1932 |accessdate=January 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==

===Background and early life===
[[File:WLA amart 1913 watercolor Landscape.jpg|thumb|upright|Man Ray, 1913, ''Landscape'' (''Paysage Fauve''),  watercolor on paper, 35.2 x 24.6 cm, [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]]]]
During his career as an artist, Man Ray allowed few details of his early life or family background to be known to the public. He even refused to acknowledge that he ever had a name other than Man Ray.&lt;ref name= BaldwinBio&gt;[[Neil Baldwin (writer)|Baldwin, Neil]]. &lt;cite&gt;Man Ray: American Artist&lt;/cite&gt;; Da Capo Press; {{ISBN|0-306-81014-X}} (1988, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

Man Ray's birth name was Emmanuel Radnitzky in [[South Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], US, in 1890.&lt;ref name="Jewish Identity" /&gt; He was the eldest child of [[History of the Jews in Russia#United States|Russian Jewish immigrants]]&lt;ref name="Jewish Identity" /&gt; Max, a tailor, and Minnie Radnitzky.&lt;ref name="Federal Census"&gt;1900 United States Federal Census&lt;/ref&gt; He had a brother, Sam, and two sisters, Dora and Essie,&lt;ref name="Federal Census" /&gt; the youngest born in 1897 shortly after they settled in the [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]]&lt;ref name="Jewish Identity" /&gt; neighborhood of [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. In early 1912, the Radnitzky family changed their surname to Ray. Man Ray's brother chose the surname in reaction to the [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] discrimination and [[antisemitism]] prevalent at the time. Emmanuel, who was called "Manny" as a nickname, changed his first name to Man and gradually began to use Man Ray as his name.&lt;ref name=BaldwinBio/&gt;&lt;ref name=Conv2Mod&gt;[[Francis Naumann]]; &lt;cite&gt;Conversion to Modernism: The Early Work of Man Ray&lt;/cite&gt;; Rutgers University Press; {{ISBN|0-8135-3148-9}} (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

Man Ray's father worked in a garment factory and ran a small tailoring business out of the family home. He enlisted his children to assist him from an early age. Man Ray's mother enjoyed designing the family's clothes and inventing [[patchwork]] items from scraps of fabric.&lt;ref name=BaldwinBio/&gt; Man Ray wished to disassociate himself from his family background, but their tailoring left an enduring mark on his art.

Mason Klein, curator of a Man Ray exhibition at the [[Jewish Museum (Manhattan)|Jewish Museum]] in New York, ''Alias Man Ray: The Art of Reinvention'', suggests that the artist may have been "the first Jewish avant-garde artist."&lt;ref name="Jewish Identity"&gt;{{ citation | url= http://www.thejewishweek.com/viewArticle/c347_a17217/The_Arts/Museums.html | date= November 10, 2009 | title= Man Ray's Jewish Identity: 'Concealing And Revealing' | first= Eric | last= Herschthal | work = [[The Jewish Week]] | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100127075614/http://www.thejewishweek.com/viewArticle/c347_a17217/The_Arts/Museums.html | archivedate = January 27, 2010 | deadurl=yes | quote=Klein suggests that Ray may have even been the first Jewish avant-garde artist, though it is a tenuous claim given both the movement and Man Ray's disavowal of ethnic identity.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Man Ray was the uncle of the photographer [[Naomi Savage]], who learned some of his techniques and incorporated them into her own work.&lt;ref name="HellerHeller2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jules Heller|author2=Nancy G.

===First artistic endeavors===

Man Ray displayed artistic and mechanical abilities during childhood. His education at Brooklyn's [[Boys and Girls High School|Boys' High School]] from 1904 to 1909 provided him with solid grounding in [[technical drawing|drafting]] and other basic art techniques. While he attended school, he educated himself with frequent visits to the local art museums, where he studied the works of the [[Old Master]]s. After his graduation, Ray was offered a scholarship to study architecture but chose to pursue a career as an artist. Man Ray's parents were disappointed by their son's decision to pursue art, but they agreed to rearrange the family's modest living quarters so that Ray's room could be his [[studio]].&lt;ref name=BaldwinBio/&gt; The artist remained in the family home over the next four years. During this time, he worked steadily towards becoming a professional painter. Man Ray earned money as a [[commercial art]]ist and was a [[Technical illustration|technical illustrator]] at several [[Manhattan]] companies.&lt;ref name=BaldwinBio/&gt;&lt;ref name=Conv2Mod/&gt;

The surviving examples of his work from this period indicate that he attempted mostly paintings and drawings in 19th-century styles. He was already an avid admirer of contemporary avant-garde art, such as the European modernists he saw at [[Alfred Stieglitz]]'s "[[291 (art gallery)|291]]" gallery and works by the [[Ashcan School]]. However, with a few exceptions, he was not yet able to integrate these trends into his own work. The art classes he sporadically attended, including stints at the [[National Academy of Design]] and the [[Art Students League of New York|Art Students League]], were of little apparent benefit to him. When he enrolled in the [[Modern School (United States)|Ferrer School]] in the autumn of 1912, he began a period of intense and rapid artistic development.&lt;ref name=Conv2Mod/&gt;

While living in New York City, Man Ray was visually influenced by the 1913 [[Armory Show]] and galleries of European contemporary works. His early paintings display facets of [[cubism]]. After befriending [[Marcel Duchamp]], who was interested in showing movement in static paintings, his works began to depict movement of the figures. An example is the repetitive positions of the dancer's skirts in ''The Rope Dancer Accompanies Herself with Her Shadows'' (1916).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?criteria=O%3AAD%3AE%3A3716&amp;page_number=5&amp;template_id=1&amp;sort_order=1 |title=The Collection &amp;#124; Man Ray. The Rope Dancer Accompanies Herself with Her Shadows. 1916 |publisher=MoMA |accessdate=January 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1915, Man Ray had his first solo show of paintings and drawings after he had taken up residence at an art colony in [[Grantwood, New Jersey]], across the [[Hudson River]] from New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Staff. [https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10D14FF345C137B93CBA8178AD95F428785F9 "Man Ray Is Dead in Paris at 86; Dadaist Painter and Photographer"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 19, 1976. Retrieved December 15, 2013. "His style changed in 1915 to 'reducing human figures to flat-patterned disarticulated forms.' He was living at the time in Ridgefield, N.&amp;nbsp;J."&lt;/ref&gt; His first proto-Dada object, an assemblage titled ''Self-Portrait'', was exhibited the following year. He produced his first significant photographs in 1918.

Man Ray abandoned conventional painting to involve himself with [[Dada]], a radical anti-art movement. He started making objects and developed unique mechanical and photographic methods of making images. For the 1918 version of ''Rope Dancer'', he combined a spray-gun technique with a pen drawing. Like Duchamp, he did ''[[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymades]]''—ordinary objects that are selected and modified. His ''[[The Gift (sculpture)|Gift]]'' readymade (1921) is a [[Clothes iron|flatiron]] with metal tacks attached to the bottom, and ''Enigma of Isidore Ducasse''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imj.org.il/imagine/collections/item.asp?table=comb&amp;itemNum=194410 |title=IMAGINE – The Israel Museum's searchable collections database |publisher=Imj.org.il |accessdate=January 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an unseen object (a sewing machine) wrapped in cloth and tied with cord. ''Aerograph'' (1919), another work from this period, was done with airbrush on glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.stedelijk.nl/en/artwork/27789-aerograph |title=Man Ray, ''Aerograph'', 1919, Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam |access-date=June 18, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150618235648/http://www.stedelijk.nl/en/artwork/27789-aerograph |archive-date=June 18, 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920, Man Ray helped Duchamp make the ''[[Marcel Duchamp#Kinetic art|Rotary Glass Plates]]'', one of the earliest examples of [[kinetic art]]. It was composed of glass plates turned by a motor. That same year, Man Ray, [[Katherine Dreier]], and Duchamp founded the [[Société Anonyme (art)|Société Anonyme]], an itinerant collection that was the first museum of [[modern art]] in the U.S. In 1941 the collection was donated to [[Yale University Art Gallery]].&lt;ref name="Cabanne, P"&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=4SNKDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT14&amp;dq=cabanne,+Marcel+Duchamp+military+service&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwje6oi3mMDXAhXHWxQKHTsbBb8Q6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=cabanne%2C%20Marcel%20Duchamp%20military%20service&amp;f=false Cabanne, P., &amp; Duchamp, M.

Man Ray teamed up with Duchamp to publish one issue of ''[[New York Dada]]'' in 1920. For Man Ray, Dada's experimentation was no match for the wild and chaotic streets of New York.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/man-ray/prophet-of-the-avant-garde/510/ |title=Man Ray – Prophet of the Avant-Garde &amp;#124; American Masters |publisher=PBS |date=September 17, 2005 |accessdate=January 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that "Dada cannot live in New York. All New York is dada, and will not tolerate a rival."&lt;ref name="pbs.org"/&gt;

In 1913, Man Ray met his first wife, the Belgian poet Adon Lacroix (Donna Lecoeur) (1887–1975), in New York. They married in 1914, separated in 1919, and formally divorced in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Lacroix's first marriage had been to Adolf Wolff, an immigrant anarchist sculptor and poet, born in Brussels, Belgium.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paris===

In July 1921, Man Ray went to live and work in Paris, France. He soon settled in the [[Montparnasse]] quarter favored by many artists. Shortly after arriving in Paris, he met and fell in love with Kiki de Montparnasse ([[Alice Prin]]), an artists' model and celebrated character in Paris bohemian circles. Kiki was Man Ray's companion for most of the 1920s. She became the subject of some of his most famous photographic images and starred in his experimental films, ''[[Le Retour à la Raison]]'' and ''[[L'Étoile de mer]]''. In 1929, he began a love affair with the Surrealist photographer [[Lee Miller]]. Miller left him in 1932.

For the next 20 years in Montparnasse, Man Ray was a distinguished photographer. Significant members of the art world, such as [[James Joyce]], [[Gertrude Stein]], [[Jean Cocteau]], [[Bridget Bate Tichenor]],&lt;ref name="Man Ray"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=1015080 |title=Christie's Photography Auction, London, May 1, 1996, Lot 213/Sale 558 ''Man Ray – Bridget Bate, 1941'' |publisher=Christies.com |accessdate=January 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Antonin Artaud]], posed for his camera.

Man Ray was represented in the first [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] exhibition with [[Jean Arp]], [[Max Ernst]], [[André Masson]], [[Joan Miró]], and [[Pablo Picasso]] at the Galerie Pierre in Paris in 1925. Important works from this time were a metronome with an eye, originally titled ''[[Object to Be Destroyed]]'', and the ''Violon d'Ingres,''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artObjectDetails?artobj=61240 Getty collection].

''Violon d'Ingres'' is a popular example of how Man Ray could juxtapose disparate elements in his photography to generate meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Penrose, Roland. Man Ray. 1. Boston: New York Graphic Society, 1975. Pg 92&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, surrealist artist [[Méret Oppenheim]], known for her fur-covered teacup, posed nude for Man Ray in a well-known series of photographs depicting her standing next to a [[printing press]].

With [[Lee Miller]], his [[photographic assistant]] and lover, Man Ray reinvented the photographic technique of [[solarisation|solarization]]. He also created a type of [[photogram]] he called "rayographs", which he described as "pure dadaism".

Man Ray was in a relationship with the model Adrienne Fidelin during some time between 1936 and 1940, the two parting ways after Ray fled the Nazi occupation in France, while Adrienne chose to stay behind to care for her family.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/25/style/tmagazine/25tmodel.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Man Ray directed a number of influential [[avant-garde]] short films, known as ''[[Cinéma Pur]]''. He directed ''[[Le Retour à la Raison]]'' (2 mins, 1923); ''[[Emak-Bakia]]'' (16 mins, 1926); ''[[L'Étoile de Mer]]'' (15 mins, 1928); and ''[[Les Mystères du Château de Dé]]'' (27 mins, 1929). Man Ray also assisted Marcel Duchamp with the cinematography of his film ''[[Anemic Cinema]]'' (1926), and Ray personally manned the camera on [[Fernand Léger]]'s ''[[Ballet Mécanique]]'' (1924). In [[René Clair]]'s film ''[[Entr'acte (film)|Entr'acte]]'' (1924), Man Ray appeared in a brief scene playing [[chess]] with Duchamp.

Duchamp, Man Ray, and [[Francis Picabia]] were friends and collaborators. The three were connected by their experimental, entertaining, and innovative art.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title= Winter Museum Preview: Top 5 London | first= Chris | last= Bors | work=Art+Auction  | date= January 9, 2008 | url=http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/26385/winter-museum-preview-top-5-london/ | accessdate=April 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=k5qvm7pOI8AC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=man%20ray%20american%20artist&amp;pg=PA64#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Neil Baldwin, ''Man Ray American Artist''].

Man Ray was forced to return from Paris to the United States due to the [[Second World War]]. He lived in Los Angeles from 1940 to 1951 where he focused his creative energy on painting. A few days after arriving in Los Angeles, Man Ray met [[Juliet Browner]], a first-generation [[Romanian American|American]] of [[Romanian-Jewish]] lineage. She was a trained dancer, who studied dance with [[Martha Graham]],&lt;ref name="Juliet's obituary"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/21/obituaries/juliet-man-ray-79-the-artist-s-model-and-muse-is-dead.html | title=Juliet Man Ray, 79, The Artist's Model And Muse, Is Dead | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=January 21, 1991 | accessdate=December 3, 2014 | author=Flint, Peter B.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an experienced artists' model. The two married in 1946 in a double wedding with their friends [[Max Ernst]] and [[Dorothea Tanning]]. In 1948 Man Ray had a solo exhibition at the [[William Copley (artist)|Copley Galleries]] in Beverly Hills, which brought together a wide array of work and featured his newly painted canvases of the ''Shakespearean Equations'' series.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Strauss, "To Be Continued Unnoticed: Mathematics and Shakespeare in Hollywood," in Wendy A.

===Later life===
[[File:Man Ray by Wolleh.jpg|thumb|Man Ray portrayed by [[Lothar Wolleh]], Paris, 1975]]

Man Ray returned to Paris in 1951, and settled with Juliet into a studio at 2 bis rue Ferou near the Luxembourg Gardens in St. Germain des Pres, where he continued his creative practice across mediums.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Baldwin, Man Ray: American Artist, p. 278&lt;/ref&gt; During the last quarter century of his life, he returned to a number of his iconic earlier works, recreating them in new form. He also directed the production of limited-edition replicas of several of his objects, working first with Marcel Zerbib and later [[Arturo Schwarz]].

In 1963, he published his autobiography, ''Self-Portrait'', which was republished in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ray|first1=Man|year=1999|title=Self Portrait: Man Ray|edition=First paperback|publisher=Bulfinch|isbn=0-8212-2474-3|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in Paris on November 18, 1976, from a lung infection. He was interred in the [[Cimetière du Montparnasse]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Scott. ''Resting Places: The Burial Sites of More Than 14,000 Famous Persons'', 3d ed.: 2 (Kindle Locations 38837-38838). McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., Publishers. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; Ray's [[epitaph]] reads "unconcerned, but not indifferent". When Juliet Browner died in 1991, she was interred in the same tomb. Her epitaph reads "together again". Juliet organized a trust for his work and donated much of his work to museums. Her plans to restore the studio as a public museum proved too expensive; such was the structure's disrepair. Most of the contents were stored at the [[Pompidou Center]].&lt;ref name="Juliet's obituary"/&gt;

==Accolades==
In 1974, Man Ray received the [[Royal Photographic Society]]'s Progress Medal and Honorary Fellowship "in recognition of any invention, research, publication or other contribution which has resulted in an important advance in the scientific or technological development of photography or imaging in the widest sense."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rps.org/about/awards/history-and-recipients/progress-medal|title=Progress Medal|date=1974|website=Royal Photographic Society|access-date=December 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, ''[[ARTnews]]'' magazine named Man Ray one of the 25 most influential artists of the 20th century. The publication cited his groundbreaking photography, "his explorations of film, painting, sculpture, [[collage]], [[assemblage (art)|assemblage]] and prototypes of what would eventually be called [[performance art]] and [[conceptual art]]." ''ARTnews'' further stated that "Man Ray offered artists in all media an example of a [[Transcendental Meditation#Science of Creative Intelligence|creative intelligence]] that, in its 'pursuit of pleasure and liberty', unlocked every door it came to and walked freely where it would." Seeking pleasure and liberty was one of Ray's guiding principles, along with others such as doing things that are socially prohibited.&lt;ref name=artnews&gt;Coleman, A. D. "Willful Provocateur"; ''ARTnews'', May 1999.

* "There is no progress in art, any more than there is progress in making love. There are simply different ways of doing it."&amp;nbsp;– 1948 essay, "To Be Continued, Unnoticed".
*  "An original is a creation motivated by desire. Any reproduction of an original is motivated by necessity. It is marvelous that we are the only species that creates gratuitous forms.

*  "I paint what cannot be photographed, that which comes from the imagination or from dreams, or from an unconscious drive. I photograph the things that I do not wish to paint, the things which already have an existence."&amp;nbsp;– Undated interview, circa 1970s; published in ''Man Ray: Photographer'', 1981.

===About Man Ray===
* "Man Ray, n.m. synon. de Joie jouer jouir." (Translation: "Man Ray, masculine noun, synonymous with joy, to play, to enjoy.")&amp;nbsp;— [[Marcel Duchamp]], as the opening epigram for Man Ray's memoir ''Self-Portrait'', 1963.
* "With him you could try anything—there was nothing you were told not to do, except spill the chemicals. With Man Ray, you were free to do what your imagination conjured, and that kind of encouragement was wonderful."&amp;nbsp;– Artist and photographer, Naomi Savage, Man Ray's niece and protégée, in a 2000 newspaper interview.
* "Man Ray is a youthful alchemist forever in quest of the painter's [[philosopher's stone]]. May he never find it, as that would bring an end to his experimentations which are the very condition of living art expression."&amp;nbsp;– Adolf Wolff, "Art Notes", ''International 8'', no. 1 (January 1914), p.&amp;nbsp;21.
* "[Man Ray was] a kind of short man who looked a little like [[Mister Peepers]], spoke slowly with a slight Brooklynese accent, and talked so you could never tell when he was kidding."&amp;nbsp;– Brother-in-law Joseph Browner on his first impression of the artist; quoted in the ''Fresno Bee'', August 26, 1990.

The '''''Martyrdom of the Ten Thousand''''' is an [[oil painting]] by [[Albrecht Dürer]], dating to 1508 and now at the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] of [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. It is signed on a [[cartouche]] which hangs from the artist's self-portrait in the center, saying ''Iste fatiebat Ano Domini 1508 Albertus Dürer Aleman''.

==History==
The painting was commissioned by [[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony]] for the [[All Saints' Church, Wittenberg]].&lt;ref name="posselt"&gt;{{cite web|last=Posselt|first=Christina|title=Kommentar|url=http://ta.sandrart.net/-annotation-635|work=sandrart.net|accessdate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frederick had been Dürer's patron since 1496. He himself chose the subject, as his collection of relics included some of the [[Ten thousand martyrs]].
[[File:Martirio dei diecimila, incisione.jpg|left|220px|thumb|The similar  1496 woodcut.]]
Dürer had used the same subject for a [[woodcut]] of some ten years before, but in the new work he eliminated some macabre details such as the torture of the bishop [[St. Acacius (Ten thousand martyrs)|Acacius]],  having his eyes stripped through a drill. This scene was replaced by a crucifixion on the right and by the presence of the bishop in chains behind it.
[[File:Durer, Martyrdom of the Ten Thousand 04.jpg|260px|Detail of the forest.|thumb]]
The work was repeatedly mentioned in the correspondence between the artist and  [[Jakob Heller]] of [[Frankfurt]].  Dürer received  280 [[florin (coin)|florin]]s for it.

==Description==
The painting illustrates the legendary martyrdom of ten thousand Christian soldiers perpetrated on [[Mount Ararat]] by the King of Persia, [[Shapur I]], by the order of the Roman emperor [[Hadrian]] or [[Antoninus Pius]], or, according to other sources, [[Diocletian]].

Dürer painted numerous different martyrdom scenes within a forest with clearings and cliffs. In the foreground are crucifixions, decapitations, crushing with a hammer. The Persian King is portrayed as an Ottoman sultan, riding a horse on the right. The executioners also wear gaudy [[Ottoman Turks|Ottoman dress]]. In the background are prisoners walking through to a cliff from where they are thrown down against rocks and thorny bushes, as well as scenes of fighting, stoning and hitting with huge clubs.

At the center of the crowded scene, dressed in black, are two characters who walk placidly, apparently unaware of the horrors around them: one is Dürer's self-portrait (holding his signature), the other his friend and humanist [[Conrad Celtes]], who had died a few months before the execution of the painting.&lt;ref name="posselt"/&gt;

'''''Mary Magdalene''''' is a [[Pre-Raphaelite]] 1858-1860 painting by [[Frederick Sandys]]. [[Mary Magdalene]] was the only figure from the [[Bible]] that Sandys ever painted. Having sharp features reminiscent of [[Lizzie Siddal]] (though the model is unknown),&lt;ref name="MM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shadowlight.gydja.com/preraphaelite.html |title= Shadowlight: The Pre-Raphaelite Goddess|author= |accessdate=2007-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mary is depicted in front of a patterned forest-green [[damask]]. She holds an [[alabaster]] ointment cup, a traditional attribute which associates her with the unnamed sinful woman who anointed [[Jesus]]' feet in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#7:37|Luke 7:37]]. Like other Pre-Raphaelite painters, Frederick Sandys gave Magdalene a sensual look. 

[[Dante Rossetti]] accused Sandys of [[plagiarism]], because of the resemblance to his ''[[Mary Magdalene Leaving the House of Feasting]]'',&lt;ref&gt;The watercolor, dated 1857, is at the [[Tate Gallery]]; it was [http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/walker/exhibitions/rossetti/works/religion.asp exhibited at the Walker Art Gallery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708201508/http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/walker/exhibitions/rossetti/works/religion.asp |date=2008-07-08 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; but when Rossetti came to paint Magdalene some twenty years later, it was his painting that resembled Sandys.&lt;ref name="MM"/&gt;

''Mary Magdalene'' was acquired in 1894 by [[Samuel Bancroft]], the most important American collector of Pre-Raphaelite art, whose family donated his collection to the [[Delaware Art Museum]] in 1935.  Bancroft had bought the painting from [[Charles Fairfax Murray]], an artist in the Pre-Raphaelite circle. 

It has been exhibited as part of a touring exhibition of the Bancroft Collection, at the [[Saint Louis Art Museum]], [[San Diego Museum of Art]], the [[Frick Art &amp; Historical Center]] in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Nottingham Castle]], and other locations.  It was once featured in an oversize advertisement in the [[San Antonio International Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.delart.org/view/collections/pr_home.html |title=Delaware Art Museum |author= |accessdate=2007-10-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626143551/http://www.delart.org/view/collections/pr_home.html |archivedate=2007-06-26 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Metamorphosis III''''' is a [[woodcut]] print by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] artist [[M. C. Escher]] created during 1967 and 1968. Measuring {{cvt|19|×|680|cm|ftin|frac=2}}, this is Escher's largest print. It was printed on thirty-three blocks on six combined sheets and mounted on canvas. This print was partly coloured by hand.

It begins identically to ''[[Metamorphosis II]]'', with the word ''metamorphose'' (the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] form of the word ''[[metamorphosis]]'') forming a grid pattern and then becoming a black-and-white checkered pattern. Then the first set of new imagery begins. The angles of the checkered pattern change to elongated diamond shapes. These then become an image of flowers with bees. This image then returns to the diamond pattern and back into the checkered pattern.

It then resumes with the ''Metamorphosis II'' imagery until the bird pattern. The birds then become sailing boats. From the sailing boats the image changes to a second fish pattern. Then from the fish to horses. The horses then become a second bird pattern. The second bird pattern then becomes black-and-white triangles, which then become envelopes with wings. These winged envelopes then return to the black-and-white triangles and then to the original bird pattern. It then resumes with the ''Metamorphosis II'' print until its conclusion.

The '''Mission Dolores mural''' is an 18th-century work of art in the [[Mission San Francisco de Asís]], the oldest surviving structure in [[San Francisco]].  In 1791, the [[Ohlone people]], Native Americans of the [[San Francisco Bay]] and laborers for the church, painted the mural on the focal wall of the sanctuary.  Five years later, an altarpiece known as a [[reredos]], was constructed in front of the mural, blocking it from view for more than two centuries.  The mural remained mostly unseen in the intervening years, decaying slowly as it was protected from light and moisture behind the reredos enclosure.&lt;ref name="aia"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=[[Archaeological Institute of America]] |date=May–June 2004 |url=http://www.archaeology.org/0405/newsbriefs/heart.html |title=Saved by Neglect |volume=57 |issue=3 |journal=[[Archaeology (magazine)|Archaeology]] |page=11 |issn=0003-8113 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2000s, archaeologist Eric Blind and artist [[Ben Wood]] digitized the mural, allowing the public to view it for the first time.  Painted on plaster, the mural is adorned with abstract patterns and [[Christian art|Christian imagery]], in ochre, white, red, yellow, black, and blue/grey colors.  The mural is an historically significant work of art from the early era of [[Spanish missions in California]] (1769–1833),&lt;ref name="spark" /&gt; and is considered "the best-preserved example of art from the period of first contact with Europeans".&lt;ref name="Nolte"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Nolte |first=Carl |date=2004-01-29 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2004/01/29/MNGC74KEA71.DTL#ixzz0z25ir2Bi |title=Centuries-old murals revealed in Mission Dolores |publisher=''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The construction of adobe walls for the mission church began in 1788 with the manufacture of 36,000 bricks by native laborers. By 1790 the walls were completed, plastered, and whitewashed. It is most likely between this time and the dedication of the church on August 2, 1791 that the mural was painted.  The mural covers the entirety of the rear wall of the church, behind the historic wooden altar. It measures 22 by 20 feet and includes two statuary niches. It was eclipsed in the year 1796 by an impressive baroque-style relief sculpture shipped from San Blas, Mexico, called a ''[[reredos]]''. A reredos is often wooden with niches and holds statues or paintings. This reredos continues to stand as the backdrop to the mission altar and has concealed the wall painting for over 200 years.&lt;ref name="spark"&gt;{{Cite web|author=KQED Arts |date=Jan 2005 |url=http://www.kqed.org/arts/programs/spark/profile.jsp?essid=4210 |title=Spark: Ben Wood |publisher=''[[KQED (TV)|KQED]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; For about five years before the mural was covered by the ornate wooden reredos, friars, soldiers, and native people saw the mural each day.
[[File:sacredheart2.jpg|thumb|300px|Detail of Sacred Heart pierced by three daggers]]

Part of the mural depicts the [[Sacred Heart]]s of Jesus and Mary.  In [[Christian art]], the Sacred Heart is often portrayed as a flaming heart shining with [[Light (theology)|divine light]], pierced by the lance-wound, surrounded by a crown of thorns, surmounted by a cross and bleeding. Sometimes the image is over Jesus' body with his wounded hands pointing at the heart. The wounds and crown of thorns allude to the manner of Jesus' death, while the fire represents the transformative power of love.  In the Mission Dolores mural, the Sacred Heart appears on either side of the upper third of the mural, with a decorative recessed wall, or statuary niche, in the center, decorated at the top with a shell motif. The upper niche is richly ornamented with scroll motifs and flanked on either side with more scrolling decorative patterns. The interior of the lower niche is less decorative and painted in red. Similar ornamental motifs are found elsewhere in the old mission on the archway above the sanctuary, as well as chevron patterns on the ceiling. We know these are original native patterns as we see the same pattern in the original basketry woven by local native women over 200 years ago. According to the California Missions Foundation some of the design resembles traditional Ohlone patterns found on rock art in the region.&lt;ref name="cmf"&gt;{{Cite web |author=California Missions Foundation |url=http://www.californiamissionsfoundation.org/mission-san-francisco-de-asis.html |title=Mission San Francisco de Asís ("Mission Dolores") |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110505165610/http://www.californiamissionsfoundation.org/mission-san-francisco-de-asis.html |archivedate=2011-05-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the mission church behind the huge canvas depicting the last supper there are also decorative patterns painted on the wall.

A defining factor in the preservation of the mural over the centuries is the mural's situation in a dark, cramped space behind the historic reredos. The mural is situated on a wall about two feet behind the reredos. It is only partially visible from an oblique angle through a trap door that opens from the attic above.

Certain areas of the mural have deteriorated over time, particularly a section at the top of the mural that has been severely abraded, possibly when an electrical cable was installed in front of the mural.  Besides being an engaging piece of art, the mural is an intriguing artifact from a seemingly remote past. An artifact which silently stood witness for five years as a few missionaries on the frontier edge of an extended empire endeavored to convert the numerous native peoples to Catholicism and a Spanish colonial vision of civilization.

==Historical accounts==
English captain and geographer [[George Vancouver]] was the first foreign visitor to sail into colonial San Francisco.  He made two trips to San Francisco in 1792 and 1793. Vancouver's praising account of the church is one of the few remarks available from the brief period the mural was displayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Engelhardt |first=Zephyrin |authorlink=Zephyrin Engelhardt |year=1924 |url=http://www.sfmission.com/cgi-bin/gallery/imageFolio.cgi?action=view&amp;link=San_Francisco/Mission_District/History/Birthplace_of_the_SF_Bay_Area/Ohlone_Indians&amp;image=Ohlone-mission_dolores.jpg&amp;img=&amp;tt= |title=San Francisco or Mission Dolores |location=Chicago |publisher=Franciscan Herald Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;...the church, which for its magnitude and architecture and internal decorations, did great credit to the constructors of it....the raising and decorating of this edifice appeared to have greatly attracted the attention of the Fathers, and the comforts they might have provided in their humble habitation, seemed to have been totally sacrificed to their accomplishment of this favorite object.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Vancouver |first=George |authorlink=George Vancouver |editor=Joshua Paddison |year=1999 |chapter=from A Voyage of Discovery to the North Pacific Ocean |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=WEQ6sIjuS6cC&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;pg=PA82#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=A World Transformed: Firsthand Accounts of California Before the Gold Rush |publisher=Heyday Books |isbn=1-890771-13-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first known visual record of any decoration at Mission Dolores was an illustration in 1816 by artist [[Louis Choris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Linenthal |first=Peter |author2=Abigail Johnston |author3=Potrero Hill Archives Project  |year=2005 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xt1BeeB_u7cC&amp;pg=PA14#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=San Francisco's Potrero Hill |publisher=Arcadia Publishing |isbn=0-7385-2937-0 |page=14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Choris' watercolor painting, ''Dance of the California Indians at the Mission of San Francisco'' (1816)&lt;ref&gt;See also [https://books.google.com/books?id=WEQ6sIjuS6cC&amp;pg=PA147#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Paddison 1999, p.147]; [[Louis Choris|Choris, Louis]].

==Rediscovery and archaeology==
[[File:missionbasilica.jpg|thumb|300px|Photo of projection of Sacred Hearts onto basilica dome, January 23 to February 7, 2004]]

During work on the church's exterior walls in 1918, a policeman, Charles Fennell, discovered a frieze in the old sacristy: "Fennell, watching workmen engaged in buttressing the walls of the building, had his attention attracted by streaks of color flashing from pealing kalsomine on what was once the interior of the old sacristy ... one of the details looked like a horse shoe, and what resembled a hand or a running or gesticulating figure of man could also be discerned."&lt;ref name="sfe1918"&gt;{{Cite news |date=June 19, 1918 |title=Indian Fresco Uncovered at Old Mission. Freize Hidden in Dolores Sacristy Perhaps for More than a Century, Brought to Light |newspaper=San Francisco Examiner |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the same article, "The old sacristy walls were preserved with a sheathing of wood by Father Prendergast away back in 1862."&lt;ref name="sfe1918"/&gt; By 1918 the mural had already been covered for over 120 years.

On April 10, 1936, [[Historic American Buildings Survey]] (HABS) documentation was undertaken by photographer [[Robert Kerrigan]], who recorded black and white photographs of the central niche.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/ca0674.photos.016019p/ |title=Detail of Original Altar Niche |last=Kerrigan |first=Robert W. |date=April 10, 1936 |website=Historic American Buildings Survey |publisher=Library of Congress |location=Washington, D.C. |access-date=February 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; From those photographs the central niche appears to be unchanged in condition since that time. The mission church, the mural, and the hatch opening to it are documented in architectural drawings. Detailed drawings of the sanctuary interior show painted ornament on the north and south walls, of which one design clearly resembles the images of hearts found behind the reredos. This design painted in red on natural white plaster is obviously a [[rooster]], with intricately painted feathers and a heart in the center. The rooster is a Christian symbol of the resurrection of Jesus.

During the late 1980s, [[Norman Neuerburg]], a noted mission historian, crawled behind the altar in the cramped space to draw a sketch of the mural.

In the 2000s, archaeologist [[Eric Blind]] and artist [[Ben Wood]] of the Mission Dolores Digital Mural Project captured the first photographs of the mural, keeping the 1796 reredos intact. Digital images were displayed to the public in a projection display onto the interior dome of the Mission Dolores basilica. The Office of Historic Preservation of the [[California Department of Parks and Recreation]] awarded Blind and Wood the California Governor's Historic Preservation Award for their work preserving the mural.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Rosato |first=Joe |date=2004-11-17 |url=http://www.parks.ca.gov/pages/712/files/111704.pdf |title=State Parks Announces 2004 Governor's Awards |publisher=[[California Department of Parks and Recreation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 2007, Blind presented the professional paper, "Visualizing Past Places: The Mission Dolores Mural", at the California Mission Studies Association annual meeting.

It is thought that separating the back altar from the mural would be a very complicated and costly process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Raygoza |first=Octavio |authorlink=Mission Loc@l |year=2010 |url = http://missionlocal.org/2010/10/forgotten-18th-century-mural/|title=Forgotten 18th Century Mural Dolores}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recreation==

'''Order of the National Artists of the Philippines''' ([[Filipino language|Filipino]]: '''''Orden ng mga Pambansang Alagad ng Sining ng Pilipinas''''') is an [[Order (honour)|order]] bestowed by the [[Philippines]] on [[Filipino people|Filipino]]s who have made significant contributions to the development of [[Art of the Philippines|Philippine art]]. Members of the Order are known as '''National Artists'''. Originally instituted as an Award, it was elevated to the status of '''Order''' in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/2003/09/19/executive-order-no-236/ Executive Order No. 236, s. 2003] Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines. Retrieved 24 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Order is administered by the [[Cultural Center of the Philippines]] by virtue of [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]]'s Proclamation № 1001 of April 2, 1972 and the [[National Commission for Culture and the Arts (Philippines)|National Commission for Culture and the Arts]]. The first award was posthumously conferred on Filipino painter [[Fernando Amorsolo]].

== Definition ==
The order of the highest state honor conferred on individuals deemed as having done much for their artistic field. Deserving individuals must have been recommended by both the Cultural Center and the National Commission on Culture and the Arts prior to receiving the award. Such people are then titled, by virtue of a Presidential Proclamation, as ''National Artist'' ([[Filipino language|Filipino]]: ''Gawad Pambansang Alagad ng Sining'', "National Servant of the Arts Award"), and are inducted into the Order.

Recipients attend a conferment ceremony at [[Malacañang Palace]], where the [[President of the Philippines|President]] bestows on them the insignia of the Order: an ornate, gilt [[Neck order|collar]] and a small pin, both depicting the Order's emblem. In addition to the collar, each new Member is given a citation that is presented during the conferment ceremony. The [[Cultural Center of the Philippines]] then presents a Memorabilia Exhibit of the recipients' works, and holds a ''Gabi ng Parangal'' (Night of Tributes) for the National Artists at the ''[[Cultural Center of the Philippines#Tanghalang Pambansa|Tanghalang Pambansa]]''.

==Categories==
Categories under which National Artists can be recognized originally included:&lt;ref name="NCCA"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncca.gov.ph/about-ncca/org-awards/org-awards-national-artist-guidelines.php|title=The National Artists of the Philippines Guidelines|accessdate=2009-08-20|publisher=National Commission for Culture and the Arts|year=2007|work=ncca.gov.ph|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090828140302/http://www.ncca.gov.ph/about-ncca/org-awards/org-awards-national-artist-guidelines.php|archivedate=2009-08-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Music - singing, composition, direction, and/or performance;
*Dance - choreography, direction and/or performance;
*Theater – direction, performance and/or production design;
*Contemporary Arts – painting, sculpture, printmaking, photography, installation art, mixed media works, illustration, graphic arts, performance art and/or imaging;
*Literature – poetry, fiction, essay, playwriting, journalism and/or literary criticism;
*Film and Broadcasting/Broadcast Arts – direction, writing, production design, cinematography, editing, camera work,  and/or performance; and
*Architecture, Design and Allied Arts– architecture design, interior design, industrial arts design, landscape architecture and fashion design.

However, National Artists have since been honored under new categories. The NCCA 'created' the category of National Artist for [[Fashion design|Fashion Design]] when it nominated Ramon Valera, but subsumed that category under "Architecture and Allied Arts". President [[Fidel V. Ramos]] issued an executive order creating the category of National Artist for Historical Literature before conferring the honor to [[Carlos Quirino]].

== Criteria ==
The National Artist of the Philippines are based on a broad criteria, as set forth by the Cultural Center of the Philippines and the National Commission on Culture and the Arts:&lt;ref name="NCCA"/&gt;
# Living artists who have been Filipino citizens for the last ten years prior to nomination as well as those who have died after the establishment of the award in 1972 but were Filipino citizens at the time of their death;
# Artists who have helped build a Filipino sense of nationhood through the content and form of their works;
# Artists who have distinguished themselves by pioneering in a mode of creative expression or style, making an impact on succeeding generations of artists;
# Artists who have created a significant body of works and/or have consistently displayed excellence in the practice of their art form, enriching artistic expression or style; and
# Artists who enjoy broad acceptance through prestigious national and/or international recognition, awards in prestigious national and/or international events, critical acclaim and/or reviews of their works, and/or respect and esteem from peers within an artistic discipline.

Nominations are then submitted to the National Artist Secretariat that is created by the National Artist Award Committee; experts from the different art fields then sit on a First Deliberation to prepare the short list of nominees. A Second Deliberation, which is a joint meeting of the Commissioners of the NCCA and the Board of Trustees of the CCP, decides on the final nominees. The list is then forwarded to the President of the Philippines, who, by Presidential Proclamation, proclaims the final nominees as members of the Order of National Artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quezon.ph/2006/05/24/proclaimed-a-national-artist-not-awarded/|title=Proclaimed a National Artist, not awarded » Manuel L.

== Controversies ==
Over the years there have been several controversies involving the awarding of National Artist or involving awardees.

=== 2009 National Artist of the Philippines controversy ===
{{main|2009 National Artist of the Philippines controversy}}
In August 2009, the conferment of the Order of National Artists on seven individuals by President [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]]&lt;ref name="announcement"&gt;{{cite journal | author=TJ Burgonio | title=Arroyo names 7 National Artists for '09 | journal=Philippine Daily Inquirer | date=July 29, 2009 | url=http://services.inquirer.net/mobile/09/07/29/html_output/xmlhtml/20090729-217787-xml.html | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ipXoRVMW?url=http://services.inquirer.net/mobile/09/07/29/html_output/xmlhtml/20090729-217787-xml.html | archivedate=August 6, 2009 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; became controversial when it was revealed that musician [[Ramon Santos]] had been dropped from the list of nominees short-listed in May that year by the selection committee, and that four other individuals had been nominated via "President’s prerogative": Cecilla Guidote-Alvarez (Theater), [[Magno Jose "Carlo” Caparas|Magno José "Carlo” Caparás]] (Visual Arts and Film), [[Francisco Mañosa]] (Architecture), and [[Jose “Pitoy” Moreno|José “Pitoy” Moreno]] (Fashion Design).&lt;ref name="GMA7"/&gt;&lt;ref name="firstreaction"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Kristine L. Alave, Bayani San Diego Jr| title=Palace choices of 4 nat'l artists protested| journal=Philippine Daily Inquirer| date=August 1, 2009| url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20090801-218247/Palace-choices-of-4-natl-artists-protested| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ipXospc6?url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20090801-218247/Palace-choices-of-4-natl-artists-protested| archivedate=August 6, 2009| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the Philippine art community–including a number of living members of the Order–protested that the proclamation politicised the title of National Artist, and made it "a way for President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo to accommodate her allies." Specific protests were raised regarding the nomination of Guidote-Alvarez, who was also Executive Director of the National Commission for Culture and the Arts, because it was purportedly a breach of protocol and ''delicadeza'' (propriety), and of Caparás, on the grounds that he was unqualified for nomination under both the Visual Arts and the Film categories.&lt;ref name="firstreaction"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alanguilan"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gerry.alanguilan.com/archives/1659|title=Bottom Line: Carlo J.

On June 20, 2014, five years after he was originally shortlisted in 2009, Dr. Ramon Santos was finally conferred National Artist for Music by President [[Benigno S. Aquino III]].&lt;ref name="2014-national-artists" /&gt;

'''Nutcracker dolls''', also known as '''Christmas nutcrackers''', are decorative [[nutcracker]] figurines most commonly made to resemble a [[toy soldier]]. In German tradition, the dolls are symbols of good luck, scaring away bad spirits.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/holidays/2010/12/in_a_nutshell.html|title=In a Nutshell|last=Malone|first=Noreen|date=2010-12-16|newspaper=Slate|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://australianballet.com.au/behind-ballet/the-nutcracker-doll-a-history|title=The nutcracker doll: a history {{!}} The Australian Ballet|website=australianballet.com.au|access-date=2016-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While nearly all nutcrackers from before the first half of the 20th century are functional, a significant proportion of modern nutcrackers are primarily decorative, and not able to crack nuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theplate.nationalgeographic.com/2014/12/08/why-nutcrackers-dont-actually-crack-nuts/|title=Why Fancy Nutcrackers Don't Actually Crack Nuts |first=Mary Beth|last=Albright|work=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]|date=2014-12-08|access-date=2016-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=   http://mrshea.com/germusa/customs/nutcrack.htm|title =  The Story of The Nutcracker  |publisher =   germusa/custom|accessdate= December 15, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Nussknackermuseum 002.jpg|thumb|left|Original nutcracker dolls from [[Nussknacker Museum]] in [[Neuhausen, Saxony]]]]
Nutcracker dolls originate from late-17th century Germany, particularly the [[Ore Mountains]] (German: ''Erzgebirge'') region.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; One origin story attributes the creation of the first nutcracker doll to a craftsman from [[Seiffen]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They were often given as gifts, and at some point they became associated with [[Christmas]] season. They grew in popularity around the 19th century and spread to nearby European countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As the demand grew, nutcracker doll production also began on a mass scale in factories.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; {{ill|Friedrich Wilhelm Füchtner|de}} (1844–1923), commonly known in Germany as "father of the nutcracker", began the first mass production of the design (using a [[lathe]]) at his workshop in [[Seiffen]] in [[Saxony]] during 1872.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nutcrackermuseum.com/history.htm|title=NM The History of Nutcrackers ~ Leavenworth Nutcracker Museum|website=www.nutcrackermuseum.com|access-date=2016-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stanton2011"&gt;{{cite book|first=Maureen |last=Stanton|title=Killer Stuff and Tons of Money: An Insider's Look at the World of Flea Markets, Antiques, and Collecting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JpjtUNexvC4C&amp;pg=PT25|date=9 June 2011|publisher=Penguin Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-101-51605-8|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=   http://www.fuechtnerwerkstatt.de/tradition|title =     Gotthelf Friedrich Füchtner |publisher = Werkstatt alter Volkskunst|accessdate= December 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=    http://www.thechristmashaus.com/craftspeople.htm|title =Füchtner Nutcrackers|publisher =thechristmashaus|accessdate= December 15, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Decorative nutcracker dolls began being popularized outside of Europe after the [[Second World War]], when numerous American soldiers stationed in Germany came home to the United States with German nutcrackers as souvenirs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Further popularization came from [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[The Nutcracker]]'', a ballet adaptation of [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]]'s story ''[[The Nutcracker and the Mouse King]]'', which featured a toy soldier nutcracker.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The ballet, introduced to America during the mid-20th century, became a favorite holiday tradition across the United States&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and helped make nutcracker dolls a [[Christmas decoration]] and a seasonal icon across Western culture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Design==
An average handcrafted nutcracker doll is made out of about 60 separate pieces.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Nutcracker dolls traditionally resemble toy soldiers, and are often painted in bright colors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Different designs proliferated early; by the early 19th century there were ones dressed as miners, policemen, royalty or soldiers from different armies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; More recent variations have been made to resemble various pop-culture or historical figurines, from [[Benjamin Franklin]] to [[Gulf War|Operation Desert Storm]]-uniform American soldiers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8030">[[File:Philly Improv Theater Logo 2017.png|thumb|Logo of the Philly Improv Theater from 2017 (designed by Whitney Harris).]]'''Philly Improv Theater''', or '''PHIT''' (pronounced "fit"), is a [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania comedy theater which produces and presents shows at The Adrienne Theatre in [[Center City, Philadelphia|Center City Philadelphia]]. The theater also operates a training center with programs in improv comedy, [[sketch comedy]] and stand-up comedy. PHIT's most notable alumnus is stand-up comedian [[Kent Haines]], who was the 2008 winner of the Philly's Phunniest contest at [[Helium Comedy Club]] and has appeared on public radio show [[The Sound of Young America]] and Season 4 of [[Comedy Central]]'s program [[Live at Gotham]]. In addition to Haines, other comedians from Philadelphia who appeared on stage at PHIT have gone on to perform at major comedy venues in cities like New York and Los Angeles, founded their own theatre companies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicvsaudience.net/blog/2009/09/01/a-new-non-profit-for-comedy-the-philadelphia-joke-initiative/ |title=A New Non-profit for Comedy: The Philadelphia Joke Initiative |date=09-01-2009 |accessdate=2010-02-15 |work=comicvsaudience.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and appeared in touring productions for [[The Second City]].

== History ==
PHIT was founded as a nonprofit in October 2005 by Greg Maughan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/articles/17590/a-e--stage |title=Improv walks a tight rope |last=Robb |first=J. Cooper |newspaper=The Philadelphia Weekly |date=09-03-2008 |accessdate=2008-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; with assistance from local improvisers Bobbi Block, Matt Holmes and Alexis Simpson. The original purpose of the theater was to offer improv comedy instruction for beginning to advanced students. Over time PHIT expanded its mission to include sketch comedy instruction, and became an important presenter and producer for all varieties of [[alternative comedy]] shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.philly.com/2008-11-13/news/25255998_1_comedysportz-short-form-improv-live-arts-festival |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923034833/http://articles.philly.com/2008-11-13/news/25255998_1_comedysportz-short-form-improv-live-arts-festival |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2016-09-23 |title=No Script, no problem |first=Wendy |last=Rosenfield |date=2008-11-13 |accessdate=2008-11-16 |newspaper=The Philadelphia Inquirer |location=Philadelphia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viewers of Philadelphia's local FOX affiliate, [[WTXF-TV]], voted PHIT as the city's Best Comedy Club in their 2009 Hot List competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://myfoxphilly.cityvoter.com/winners/best-of-the-philly-hot-list/4745/arts-and-entertainment/comedy-club?place=151350 |work=myfoxphilly.com |title=2009 Best Comedy Club - Philly hot list|date=2009-09-21 |accessdate=2010-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Productions ==
PHIT hosts a variety of comedy shows every night of the week:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phitcomedy.com/tickets/|title=GET TICKETS|accessdate=2017-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; improv, sketch, stand-up, and variety comedy shows, as well as occasional movie screenings. The theater produces weekly performances by ten improv comedy house teams (The Future, Big Baby, Hoffman, 1816, Fjord, Channel 77, Swan Year, Metropolis, PG-13, and Hackett Park), three sketch comedy house teams (The Flat Earth, Dog Mountain, and Goat Rodeo) as well as independent improv and sketch groups. Also on PHIT's regular schedule are several variety comedy shows (People of Interest, Theme Show, Gimmick Show, Videostew+Monologues), a Panel Comedy show (A Few Answers Short), a "found comedy" night (Guilty Pleasures), a sketch open mic called Sketch Up or Shut Up, and an open improv jam. PHIT also hosts Dynamite Series covering a wide variety of comedic disciplines (Dirty Laundry, Study Hall).  PHIT has also presented shows by performing groups from New York's [[Upright Citizens Brigade Theater]], Magnet Theater, and The Peoples Improv Theater; and individuals including [[Kevin Allison]] of MTV's [[The State (1993 TV series)|The State]], [[Susan Messing]] of Chicago's [[Annoyance Theater]], [[Kevin McDonald]] of [[The Kids in the Hall]], and [[Dave Hill (comedian)|Dave Hill]]. Every first Sunday of the month PHIT hosts an improvised show Story UP! for kids ages 5 and up.

From March 2006 until January 2008, PHIT produced a monthly improv comedy show at Fergie's Pub in Philadelphia's Center City. From January 2007 until December 2013, the theater has hosted regular performances at The Shubin Theatre, in addition to producing additional shows at others venues. In 2009, the theater produced a weekend of shows collectively titled "Philly Invades NYC" at Under Saint Marks' in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicvsaudience.net/blog/tag/philly-improv-theater-invades-nyc/ |title=PHIT and C vs. A Invade New York City this week |work=ComicVsAudience.com |date=2009-05-26 |accessdate=01-04-2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014 PHIT opened its permanent home on Second Stage at the Adrienne Theater in Center City Philadelphia at 2030 Sansom Street. In 2016 PHIT expanded to occupy the Mainstage in the Adrienne Theater.

=== Philly Fringe Festival ===
PHIT has participated in the Philadelphia Live Arts and Philly Fringe Festival every year since 2006. In 2008, the theater programmed performances by improv and sketch comedy groups on all 16 days of the festival, anchoring these shows around an original improv-to-script musical comedy titled "The Hoppers Hit the Road". The production garnered considerable attention and positive reviews in mainstream local media, including a review by [[The Philadelphia Inquirer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/entertainment/arts/20080901_Seems_like_every_year__at_least_one_Fringe_musical.html |title=Even wordy script can't keep 2 singing brothers down |first=Howard |last=Shapiro |newspaper=The Philadelphia Inquirer |location=Philadelphia |date=09-01-2008 |accessdate=09-03-2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2009 festival, the theater presented an ambitious schedule of performances - this time in the Fringe Festival's newly created Improv/Comedy category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pennsylvania.broadwayworld.com/article/Philly_Improv_Theater_Set_For_16_Days_of_Performances_During_2009_Philly_Fringe_9319_20090919 |title=Philly Improv Theater Set For 16 Days of Performances During 2009 Philly Fringe, 9/3-19 |work=BroadwayWorld.com |date=2009-09-19 |accessdate=2010-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Training program ==
Since its inception, the theater has offered a core curriculum of classes teaching basic to advanced improvising techniques. PHIT's curriculum is based heavily on similar programs at Chicago's [[Second City Training Center]] and [[IO Theater|iO]] (formerly ImprovOlympic), and New York's [[Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre]]. In February 2009, PHIT introduced a similar core curriculum in [[sketch comedy]] writing. PHIT uses local performers as instructors for its improv core curriculum, and a mix of local and nationally recognized teachers (including Kevin Allison of [[MTV]]'s [[The State (1993 TV series)|The State]] and former [[Saturday Night Live]] writer Ali Farahnakian)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pennsylvania.broadwayworld.com/article/Philly_Improv_Theater_Continues_With_New_Shows_and_New_Clases_Throughout_October_20090911 |title=Philly Improv Theater Continues With New Shows and New Clases Throughout October |date=09-11-2009 |accessdate=2010-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; for its sketch comedy program. In 2015 PHIT launched its Kids &amp; Teens program offering classes to kids in grades K-12.

[[File:Pompon.jpg|thumb|right|A pair of [[cheerleading]] pom-poms]]
A '''pom-pom''' &amp;ndash; also spelled '''pom-pon''', '''pompom''' or '''pompon''' &amp;ndash; is a decorative ball or tuft of fibrous material.

The term may refer to large tufts used by [[Cheerleading|cheerleaders]], or a small, tighter ball attached to the top of a hat, also known as a [[Knit cap#British bobble hat|bobble]] or [[Pom-pon#Toorie|toorie]].

Pom-poms may come in many colors, sizes, and varieties and are made from a wide array of materials, including [[wool]], [[cotton]], [[paper]], [[plastic]], [[thread (yarn)|thread]], [[glitter]] and occasionally [[feather]]s. Pom-poms are shaken by [[Cheerleader|cheerleaders]], pom or [[dance|dance teams]], and sports fans during [[spectator sport]]s.

==Spelling and etymology==
*''[[Webster's Third New International Dictionary]]'' (1961) gives the spelling as "pompon."
*The ''[[New Oxford American Dictionary]]'' (third edition, 2010) gives the spelling as "pom-pom."
*The ''[[American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'' (5th edition, 2011) gives the spelling as "pompom" or "pompon."
*''Webster's New World College Dictionary'' (fourth edition) gives the spelling as "pompom."

''Pom-pom'' is derived from the French word ''pompon'', which refers to a small decorative ball made of fabric or feathers. It also means an "ornamental round tuft" and originally refers to its use on a hat, or an "ornamental tuft; tuft-like flower head."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=pompom&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports and cheerleading==
[[File:YouthCheerleadingPompons.jpg|thumb|right|Cheerleaders using pom-poms during an [[American football]] [[halftime show]]]]

Cheerleaders use pom-poms at sports events for six reasons:

*to attract the attention of the spectators
*to accentuate movements
*to add "sparkle" to a cheer, chant, or dance routine
*to distract the opposing team
*to spell out team's name or "go" 
*to use semaphore

Most often, pom-poms are used in pairs (one in each hand), but this may vary with the particular requirements of the [[choreography]] of a dance or cheer.

Cheerleading pom-poms come in a variety of shapes, styles, colors, color combinations, and sizes. Shiny metallic pom-poms have become very popular in recent years.

[[File:Sports-Fest1.jpg|thumb|right|A group performance using pom-poms]]

Pom-poms are also waved by sports fans, primarily at college and high school sports events in the United States, Cheap, light-weight ''faux'' pom-poms in team colors are sometimes given or sold to spectators at such events.

Many schools and universities have dance teams in addition to their cheerleading groups. The dance teams may also use pom-poms occasionally, but many high school dance teams are now referred to as "Poms" squads. These squads are similar to drill teams, but usually have several routines that they strictly use pom-poms. Pom-poms have also come to be included in dance competitions in the United States. In many states, "Pom" or "Open Pom" is considered its own style of dance during competitions. For this style dancers use pom-poms and moves that are specifically choreographed to include pom-poms, but usually incorporate hip-hop and jazz choreography as well. When judging a routine in the Pom or Open Pom category, judges typically look for clean, sharp movements and complete synchronization of the team. These dances occasionally use different colored pom-poms and outfits to convey a theme and the dance team will create pictures from their pom-poms that relate to this theme.

==Clothing==
[[File:Shako-p1000580.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Shako]] dating from the [[Bourbon Restoration]] with a red company pompon]]
Small pom-poms may be used to adorn [[hat]]s (such as [[Tam o' Shanter (cap)|Tam o' Shanters]] and some styles of the [[tuque]]), [[sock]]s, fringed [[dress]]es, and other kinds of clothing.

Pom-poms form a conspicuous part of the uniform of French naval personnel, being sewn onto the crown of their round [[cap]]. Belgian sailors wear a light blue version.

Traditional Italian wedding shoes have small pom-poms, as do some Turkish dancing shoes.

===Roman Catholic clergy===

[[Roman Catholic clergy]] wear the [[biretta]]. The colour of its pom-pom denotes the wearer's rank. Priests wear a black biretta with a black pom. Protonotaries and domestic prelates (now prelates of honour) have a scarlet pom on their black birettas, and Papal Chamberlains (now Chaplains to His Holiness) wear a Roman purple pom on their black birettas.

Bishops and archbishops wear a Roman purple biretta with matching pom. The scarlet birettas of the cardinals have no pom, only a red loop. There is no papal biretta.

Some religious orders and congregations have unique birettas, such as the Norbertines who wear a white biretta with a white pom. Some St. Francis fathers wear a  brown biretta with a black pom. Other orders may wear a black biretta with a white, green, or blue pom, or the black biretta of the secular priesthood.

[[File:Balmoral bonnet black.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Balmoral bonnet]] with a red toorie]]

===Toorie===&lt;!--This section name is linked from [[Glengarry]], [[Balmoral bonnet]] and [[Tam o' Shanter]].--&gt;

In reference to [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Highland dress]] and Scottish military uniforms, the small pom-pom on the crown of such hats as the [[Balmoral bonnet|Balmoral]], the [[Glengarry]], and the [[Tam o' Shanter (cap)|Tam o' Shanter]] is called a "toorie."

The toorie is generally made of yarn and is traditionally red on both Balmorals and Glengarries (although specific units have used other colours). It has evolved into the smaller pom-pom found on older-style [[Flat cap|golf caps]] and the button atop [[baseball cap]]s.

Scots refer to any such hat decoration as a toorie, irrespective of the headgear.

==Flogger==
[[File:Richmond Cheer Squad Rd 21 2006 closeup.jpg|thumb|Fans at Australian rules football matches wave floggers behind the goals to signify that a goal was scored.]]

In [[Australia]], the term "flogger" is sometimes used rather than "pom-pom". Floggers are very large, heavy pom-poms in the team's colours. They sometimes require more than one person to lift them, and they are waved about when a goal is scored.

Floggers are an important part of [[Australian rules football culture]] and cheer-squads.

==Toys and bicycles==
[[File:Pom poms multiple colours.jpg|thumb|Pile of pom-poms used for children's crafts.]]
Pom-poms are sometimes used as children's toys. They are a common feature at the ends of the handlebars of children's [[tricycle]]s and [[bicycle]]s. They are also used in children's artistic crafts to add texture and color.

'''Rag-i-Bibi''' (''Veins of the Lady'') refers to a [[Sassanian]] [[rock relief]] on a cliff in modern [[Afghanistan]]. It first became known to western scholarship in 2002. It is located about a kilometre south of [[Shamarq]] and 10 km south of [[Puli Khumri]]. Rag-i-Bibi is the local name of the relief, which refers to [[Fatimah]] the daughter of [[Muhammad]], who is venerated by the [[Shiites]].

The relief is 4.9 m high and 6.5 m wide. It has been largely destroyed, partially by weathering and partially by [[Taliban]] iconoclasm. At the end of Taliban rule, local villagers reported the relief to local authorities, since they feared it would be damaged. Thus, individual Taliban were conscious of the relief and damaged it on the grounds that local residents "worshipped" it.

The relief shows a Sassanian king hunting an [[Indian rhinoceros]]. The king reins in a galloping horse. His figure would be about 2.4 m high if it were standing upright. Three figures stand around the king. Behind the ruler's horse, another two can be made out, which are poorly preserved. The upper portion of the relief shows a band of poorly preserved architectural features.

The king's head is particularly severely damaged. The crown might enable an identification with a historical king; some stylistic details suggest that [[Shapur I]] is depicted. Stylistically, the relief contains Sassanian features, but also local [[Gandhara art|Gandhara]] ones.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6464">{{Other uses|Silver Bullet (disambiguation)}}
In folklore, a [[bullet]] cast from [[silver]] is often the only weapon that is effective against a [[werewolf]], [[witch]], or other [[monster]]s. The term is also a metaphor for a simple, seemingly magical, solution to a difficult problem: for example, [[penicillin]] was a silver bullet that cured many bacterial infections.

==In folklore==
*The idea of the [[werewolf]]'s supposed vulnerability to silver probably dates back to the legend of the [[Beast of Gévaudan]], in which a gigantic wolf is killed by a hunter with the name of "Argent" which comes from the Latin word for silver, wielding a gun loaded with silver bullets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert|last=Jackson|year=1995|title=Witchcraft and the Occult|publisher=Devizes, Quintet Publishing|page=25|isbn=1-85348-888-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the [[Brothers Grimm]] fairy-tale of ''[[The Two Brothers]]'', a bullet-proof witch is shot down by silver buttons, fired from a gun.
*In some epic folk songs about [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] rebel leader [[Delyo]], he is described as invulnerable to normal weapons, driving his enemies to cast a silver bullet in order to murder him.&lt;ref name="narodna"&gt;{{cite book|last=Стойкова|first=Стефана|title=Българска народна поезия и проза в седем тома.|publisher=ЕИ "LiterNet"|location=Варна|volume= Т. III. Хайдушки и исторически песни|chapter=Дельо хайдутин|isbn=978-954-304-232-6|url=http://liternet.bg/folklor/sbornici/bnpp/haidushki/content.htm|chapterurl=http://liternet.bg/folklor/sbornici/bnpp/haidushki/58.htm|language=Bulgarian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Lone Ranger==
Silver bullets also act as a calling card for [[The Lone Ranger]] in his adventures. The masked man decided to use bullets forged from the precious metal as a symbol of justice, law and order, and to remind himself and others that life, like silver, has value and is not to be wasted or thrown away. In the 3rd episode, his friend, who will be making his bullets for him, mentions killing villains with the bullets and the Lone Ranger explains that he will not shoot to kill; he will let the law dispense justice. The silver bullets will be as symbols of justice. Whether he actually used silver bullets in his guns varies depending on story and medium. In the radio series, the Lone Ranger used only lead bullets as weapons, while the silver bullets were used symbolically. In the [[The Legend of the Lone Ranger|1981 feature film]], The Lone Ranger used silver bullets in his guns as he was told that silver was far more solid than lead slugs and provided a straighter shot. The Lone Ranger's usage of bullet made from valuable metal like silver is satirized in an episode of ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' where after expertly shooting a tin can in the air, the Ranger's sidekick Tonto laments that the amount of silver the Ranger thoughtlessly wasted could have bought enough food to feed Tonto's entire village for a year.

==Ballistic effectiveness==
Silver bullets differ from lead bullets in several respects. [[Lead]] has a 10% higher density than [[silver]], so a silver bullet will have a little less mass than a lead bullet of identical dimensions. Pure silver is less [[malleable]] than lead and falls between [[lead]] and [[copper]] in terms of hardness (1.5 &lt; '''2.5''' &lt; 3.0 [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs]]) and [[shear modulus]] (5.6 &lt; '''30''' &lt; 48 GPa). A silver bullet accepts the [[rifling]] of a gun barrel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.patriciabriggs.com/articles/silver/silverbullet14.shtml | title = History Channel Shoot | first = Michael | last = Briggs | date = September 2008 | publisher = Patricia Briggs | accessdate = January 25, 2017 | quotation = In this photo, you can see the marks the rifling in the barrel left on the bullet when it was fired. I'd like to see a little more on the nose, but the driving bands show very nice engraving.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terminal impact is somewhat speculative and will depend on a variety of factors including bullet size and shape, flight distance, and target material. At short ranges, the silver bullet will most likely give better penetration due to its higher shear modulus, and will not deform as much as a lead bullet. A 2007 episode of ''[[MythBusters]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | url = http://dsc.discovery.com/videos/mythbusters-silver-vs-lead-bullets.html | title = Mythbusters: Silver vs. Lead Bullets | date = 2007 | medium = Television production | publisher = The Discovery Channel | accessdate = January 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated a greater penetration depth of lead bullets vs. silver bullets. Results cannot be considered conclusive, however, as the show utilized a 250-[[Grain (unit)|grain]] lead slug in a [[.45LC|.45-caliber Colt long]] shell vs a lighter (190-grain) silver slug fired at closer range. Another ''MythBusters'' episode, from 2012, showed that silver bullets are less accurate than lead bullets when fired from the M1 Garand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | url = http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/mythbusters/videos/hollywood-gunslingers/ | title = Mythbusters: Hollywood Gunslingers | date = June 17, 2012 | medium = Television production | publisher = The Discovery Channel | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Briggs also did some experiments with silver bullets compared to lead bullets. After making a custom mold to ensure that the sizes of the silver bullets were comparable to the lead bullets, he fired them. He found that the silver bullets were slightly slower than the lead bullets and less accurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.patriciabriggs.com/books/silver/silverbullets.shtml | title = Silver Bullets | first = Michael | last = Briggs | date = | publisher = Patricia Briggs | accessdate = January 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pissarro - La cueillette des pois.jpg|thumb|''Picking Peas'', Camille Pissarro, gouache, 1887. Part of the Bauer collection recovered in France in 2017.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;]]

'''Simon Bauer''' (1862–1947) was a Jewish businessman in France and a collector of Impressionist art. His collection was stolen by the Vichy government in October 1943. While some works have been recovered, most are still missing. The Simon Bauer collection included 93 works from the [[Impressionism|Impressionist movement]]. Since the [[liberation of France]], some of the canvases have reappeared at auctions or exhibitions in museums.

==Early life==
Simon Bauer was born in 1862 to a humble background. He made a fortune in the footwear business, selling his holdings at the age of 40, at which point he began to travel the world to make up for his lack of education.&lt;ref name=20mins/&gt;

==Art collection==
According to the inventory taken at the time of its appropriation on 10 October 1943, Bauer's art collection comprised more than 90 works that included eleven by [[Camille Pissarro|Pissarro]], four by [[Alfred Sisley|Sisley]], four by [[Eugène Boudin|Boudin]], and one each by [[Edgar Degas|Degas]] and [[Berthe Morisot]]. The sale was entrusted to a merchant designated by the General Commissariat for Jewish Affairs ({{Lang-fr|Commissariat Général aux Questions Juives}}).

The following year, in the summer of 1944, Bauer was interned at the [[Drancy internment camp]] but saved from deportation and likely death by a railway strike.&lt;ref name=20mins/&gt; He was released in September 1944 and tried to recover the paintings that had been stolen from him, but with little success. Some of them{{Which one|date=January 2018}} are kept in the Jeu de Paume museum in Paris, but most have disappeared.

==Death and legacy==
Bauer died in 1947. His grandson, Jean-Jacques Bauer, has attempted to recover his grandfather's paintings. In 1965, he managed to locate two Pissarros but could not get restitution. In 2013, the "treasure of Munich" was found in the hoard held by [[Cornelius Gurlitt (art historian)|Cornelius Gurlitt]]. In May 2017, Pissarro's ''Picking Peas'' (1887) was discovered at the [[Musée Marmottan Monet]] to whom it had been lent by [[Bruce Toll|Bruce and Robbi Toll]], Jewish-American art collectors, for an exhibition. They had bought the painting in good faith for $800,000 at [[Christie's]] New York in 1995. A French court ordered the painting's restitution to the Bauer family without compensation to the Tolls.&lt;ref name=times&gt;"Art collectors ordered to give back looted painting", Adam Sage, ''The Times'', 8 November 2017, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=20mins&gt;[http://www.20minutes.fr/paris/2063047-20170506-toile-pissarro-spoliee-pendant-seconde-guerre-mondiale-reapparait-musee-paris Une toile de Pissarro spoliée pendant la Seconde Guerre mondiale réapparaît dans un musée à Paris.] 20minutes.fr AFP, 2017.

'''Systems-oriented design''' ('''S.O.D.''') uses [[system thinking]] in order to capture the [[complexity]] of [[system]]s addressed in [[Design|design practice]]. The main mission of S.O.D. is to build the [[designer]]s' own interpretation and implementation of systems thinking. S.O.D. aims at enabling systems thinking to fully benefit from [[design thinking]] and practice, and design thinking and practice to fully benefit from systems thinking. S.O.D. addresses design for human activity systems, and can be applied to any kind of design problem ranging from [[product design]] and [[interaction design]], through [[architecture]] to [[Decision making|decision making processes]] and policy design.

== Background ==
Design is getting more and more complex for a number of reasons, for example due to [[globalization]], need for [[sustainability]], and the introduction of new [[technology]] and increased use of [[automation]]. Many of the challenges designers meet today can be considered [[wicked problems]].&lt;ref name="Rittel"&gt;Rittel, Horst, and Melvin Webber, 1973. "Dilemmas in a General Theory of Planning."
Policy Sciences 4: 155-169. {{cite web |url=http://www.metu.edu.tr/~baykan/arch467/Rittel%2BWebber%2BDilemmas.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130721100404/http://www.metu.edu.tr/~baykan/arch467/Rittel%2BWebber%2BDilemmas.pdf |archivedate=21 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The characteristics of a wicked problem include among others that there are no definitive formulation of the problem and that the solutions are never true-or-false, but rather better or worse.&lt;ref name="Rittel" /&gt; A traditional problem solving approach is not sufficient in addressing for such design problems. S.O.D. is an approach that addresses the challenges the designer faces when working with [[complex system]]s and wicked problems, providing tools and techniques which makes it easier for the designer to grasp the complexity of the problem at hand. With a systems-oriented approach towards design, the designer acknowledges that the starting point for the design process is constantly moving, and that "every implemented solution is consequential. It leaves "traces" that cannot be undone." (see Rittel and Webber's 5th property of wicked problems&lt;ref name="Rittel" /&gt;).

Designers are well suited to work with complexity and wicked problems for a number of reasons:
* They are trained and experienced in creative thinking and idea generation;
* They know how to synthesize solutions from complex and fuzzy material;
* Designers have an ability to visualize, which is an enormous advantage for understanding and communicating complexity.

S.O.D. emphasizes these abilities as central and seeks to further train the designer in systems thinking and systems practice as a skill and an art.

== Origins ==
Systems-oriented design builds on systems theory and systems thinking in order to develop practices for addressing complexity in design. Particularly influential is soft systems methodology (SSM), acknowledging conflicting worldviews and people's purposeful actions,&lt;ref&gt;Peter Checkland and John Polter, 2006. ''Learning For Action: A Short Definitive Account of Soft Systems Methodology, and its use Practitioners, Teachers and Students.'' Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; and a systems view on creativity. However, S.O.D. is inspired by critical systems thinking and approaches systems theories in an eclectic way transforming the thoughts of the different theories to fit the design process. The design disciplines build on their own traditions and have a certain way of working with problems, often referred to as ''[[design thinking]]''&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The definition of design thinking is not completely agreed upon and the term is used somewhat differently by different people. There is currently considerable academic and business interest in developing further understanding of what design thinking is.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, G. Peter (1987). Design Thinking. Cambridge: The MIT Press. {{ISBN|978-0-262-68067-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tim Brown, 2009. ''Change by Design: How Design Thinking Transforms Organizations and Inspires Innovation''. HarperBusiness. {{ISBN|0-06-176608-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nigel Cross, 2011. Design Thinking: Understanding How Designers Think and Work. Berg Publishers {{ISBN|1-84788-636-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''the design way''.&lt;ref&gt;Harold G. Nelson and Erik Stolterman, 2002. ''The Design Way: Intentional Change in an Unpredictable World : Foundations and Fundamentals of Design Competence''. Educational Technology Pubns {{ISBN|0-87778-305-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Design thinking is a creative process based around the "building up" of ideas. This style of thinking is one of the advantages of the designer and is the reason why simply employing one of the existing systems approach into design, like for example [[systems engineering]], is not found sufficient by the advocates of S.O.D.

Compared with other systems approaches, S.O.D. is less concerned with hierarchies and borders of systems, [[Scientific modelling|modelling]] and [[feedback loops]], and more focused on the whole fields of relations and patterns of interactions. S.O.D. seeks richness rather than simplification of the complex systems.

== Systems thinking in the design process ==
Important in the systems-oriented [[design process]] is to carry out activities in order to grasp the [[complexity]] of the [[system]] designed for, and to accommodate for a [[Creativity|creative process]] taking place. In order to gain the necessary understanding of the complex system, a comprehensive data capture and analysis phase is needed. [[Visualization (computer graphics)|Visualization]]s play a vital role in the design process, both as a means to analyze and understand the information gathered, and in order to communicate. The obtained insight into the complex system is used to come up with solutions for the design problem.

Methods and techniques from other [[academic discipline|disciplines]] are used in order to understand the complexity of the system, including for example [[Ethnography|ethnographic studies]], [[risk analysis]], and [[Scenario|scenario thinking]]. Methods and concepts unique to S.O.D. include for example the Rich Design Space,&lt;ref&gt;Birger Sevaldson, 2008. ''Rich Design Research Space''. Form Akademisk. http://www.formakademisk.org/index.php/formakademisk/article/view/17&lt;/ref&gt; GIGA-mapping,&lt;ref&gt;Birger Sevaldson, 2011. ''GIGA-Mapping: Visualisation for complexity and systems thinking in design''. Paper presented at NORDES 2011, 30 May 2011. http://ocs.sfu.ca/nordes/index.php/nordes/2011/paper/view/409&lt;/ref&gt; and Incubation Techniques.

The Rich Design Space includes the physical space of the design studio with sketches, ideas, mood boards, plans etc. and the virtual digital design space of the design software, media like video and sound recording, traditional design techniques and even the social space created in the project. By paying attention to the richness of the design space, the design space can become a very efficient tool to maintain an overview of the complexity of the project all the way.

GIGA-mapping is the central tool for registering, analyzing and managing complexity in S.O.D.. It is used for systematizing and interrelating the information and knowledge obtained.

[[Incubation (psychology)|Incubation]] is one of the 4 proposed stages of [[creativity]]: preparation, incubation, illumination, and verification.&lt;ref&gt;Hadamard, J. (1945). ''The Psychology of Invention in the Mathematical Field''. Princeton
University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Incubation Techniques are techniques used by the designer in order to acquire the background knowledge needed for an incubation process to take place.

S.O.D. has proved valuable for designers to quickly acquire knowledge of a new domains, and to reveal unexpected parts of a system where a new design can be beneficial.

== Further development and applications ==
The concept of systems-oriented design was initially proposed by professor [[Birger Ragnvald Sevaldson|Birger Sevaldson]] at [[Oslo School of Architecture and Design|the Oslo School of Architecture and Design (AHO)]] in the context of the [[OCEAN Design Research Association|OCEAN design research network]]. The S.O.D. approach is currently under development through teaching and research projects, as well as through the work of design practitioners. AHO provides Master courses in Systems Oriented Design each term as part of their [[Industrial Design]] program. In these courses, design students are trained in using the tools and techniques of S.O.D. in projects with outside partners. Research projects in systems-oriented design are carried out at the Centre for Design Research&lt;ref&gt;Research related to the topic ''Systems'' carried out at AHO Centre for Design Research: http://www.designresearch.no/themes/systems&lt;/ref&gt; at AHO in order to develop the concept, methods and tools further. In 2016 the project Systemic Approach to Architectural Performance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://systemicapproachtoarchitecturalperformance.wordpress.com|title=Systemic Approach to Architectural Performance|author=|date=|website=Systemic Approach to Architectural Performance|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; was announced as an institutional cooperation between the Faculty of Art and Architecture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fua.tul.cz/en/|title=FUA - FAKULTA UMĚNÍ A ARCHITEKTURY|author=|date=|website=www.fua.tul.cz|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Technical University of Liberec]] and the Oslo School of Architecture and Design. Its mission is to link the methodology of systems-oriented design with performance-oriented architecture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.performanceorienteddesign.net|title=Welcome to the Frontpage|author=|date=|website=www.performanceorienteddesign.net|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the case study Marie Davidova's project Wood as a Primary Medium to Architectural Performance.
The Oslo-based design consultancy Halogen (www.halogen.no) has used SOD extensively with a varied range of customers. They have suggested a typology of Gigamaps and contributed with other methodological developments.
Gigamapping and other SOD methods are used by a growing range of businesses and educational institutions.

'''The Dot ''' is a work of art in [[Emmen (Drenthe)|Emmen]] ([[Netherlands]]). It is designed and painted by art collective the [[toyism|toyists]]. The Dot is a former gas container of which only two still exist in Europe. The toyists painted this monumental industrial object and linked it with the theme of Live with energy.

==History==
Toyist Dejo (founder of [[Toyism]]) came up with the idea of painting the gas globe in Emmen in 1997. After the first meetings in 2005 with the owner of the gas container, energy company [[Essent]] (later called Enexis), it would still take until 2008 before the project could finally be put in motion. This was partly due to the establishment of the foundation Living Industry , which deals with the reuse of industrial properties and the redevelopment of industrial sites. After the municipality of Emmen agreed with the project, a scaffolding of eight stories was built around the 22 meter high gas container. On the 27th of July the artist started the project of painting The Dot.&lt;ref&gt;Beek, W. van der (2012), Toyism behind the mask. Zwolle: Publisher Uitgeverij De Kunst, pp. 116. {{ISBN|978-94-91196-20-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Voormalige_gasbol.jpg|thumb|links|150px|Former gas container]]

==Transformation==
The transformation of the former (blue) gas container took several months to complete, from mid July 2009 until the unveiling on June 4 in 2010, with a winter break of two months. The project had 17 toyists from 7 different countries working for 6000 hours, they painted an area of 1250 m2 in multiple layers.&lt;ref&gt;Beek, W. van der (2012), Toyism behind the mask. Zwolle: Publisher Uitgeverij De Kunst, pp. 61. {{ISBN|978-94-91196-20-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theme==
The theme of this art work is live with energy. Figurative imagery in the painting tells the story of the history of energy production. There are four sub designs based on the four elements of life: earth (raw energy), water (hydroelectric power), fire (solar energy) and air (wind power). Each sub-design presents the combination or contrast of old and new forms of energy production and their applications (the sciences). In addition to these four fundamental themes, there is a single, central figure: the tree. The tree is a metaphor for life, energy, growth, development, and change. The province of Drenthe with its rich history of peat production is also represented in the painting. In addition, in the form of standalone motifs, general applications or containers of energy such as ecobunny lights and battery-insects can be seen moving throughout the whole painting.&lt;ref&gt;Beek, W. van der (2012), Toyism behind the mask. Zwolle: Publisher Uitgeverij De Kunst, pp. 108. {{ISBN|978-94-91196-20-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:THE DOT Live with Energy - Toyism.jpg|500px|Design of The Dot]]

==Restoration==
In the summer of 2015 The Dot was repainted. Over the years the paint had peeled off and The Dot needed to be restored to its former state. The toyists set up a crowdfunding project and, when enough money was collected, started the restoration.

In 2013 the toyists did a similar project in Keflavik, Iceland called [[Uppspretta]].

'''The European Fine Art Fair''' (abbreviated: '''TEFAF''') is an annual [[art]], antiques and design fair, organized by ''The European Fine Art Foundation'' in the [[Maastrichts Expositie en Congres Centrum|MECC]] in [[Maastricht]], [[Netherlands]]. It was first held in 1988. The 10-day fair attracts about 75,000 visitors and is considered one of the world's leading art fairs.

==The fair==
Presenting 260 of the world's leading galleries from 20 countries, TEFAF Maastricht showcases some of the best works of art currently on the market  for 10 days each year. In addition to the traditional areas of Old Master Paintings and antique Works of Art, visitors can see and buy a wide variety of Classical Modern and Contemporary Art, as well as Jewellery, 20th Century Design, and Works on Paper. There were 266 dealers from twenty countries at the fair's 2015 edition, showing museum-quality pieces ranging from classical antiquity to the 21st century, valued at 4 billion euros.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tefaf.com/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=33#sthash.tzcqXmvy.dpuf TEFAF History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326094259/http://www.tefaf.com/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=33#sthash.tzcqXmvy.dpuf |date=2014-03-26 }} TEFAF Maastricht.&lt;/ref&gt; TEFAF was reviewed by the [[Global Art Magazine]]&lt;ref&gt;Scott Reyburn (March 19, 2013), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-19/tefaf-in-talks-with-sotheby-s-for-art-event-in-china.html Tefaf in Talks With Sotheby's for Art Event in China] ''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
TEFAF Maastricht is the offspring of two Dutch fairs launched in the mid-1970s: Pictura and De Antiquairs International. Pictura was the first international fine art fair in the Netherlands and launched in 1975. Antiqua, an antiques fair launched in 1978, became De Antiquairs International in 1982. Both fairs merged in 1985 under the banner of the Antiquairs International and Pictura Fine Art fair, held at Maastricht's Eurohal.&lt;ref&gt;Gareth Harris (March 15, 2012), [http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Tefaf:-going-Dutch-has-never-felt-better/26019 Tefaf: going Dutch has never felt better] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215140340/http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Tefaf:-going-Dutch-has-never-felt-better/26019 |date=2013-12-15 }} ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 10-day event organized by dealers,&lt;ref&gt;Scott Reyburn (March 19, 2013), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-19/tefaf-in-talks-with-sotheby-s-for-art-event-in-china.html Tefaf in Talks With Sotheby's for Art Event in China] ''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; TEFAF Maastricht was subsequently launched at the MECC in 1988, with 89 participating dealers, the majority of them Dutch.&lt;ref&gt;Gareth Harris (March 15, 2012), [http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Tefaf:-going-Dutch-has-never-felt-better/26019 Tefaf: going Dutch has never felt better] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215140340/http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Tefaf:-going-Dutch-has-never-felt-better/26019 |date=2013-12-15 }} ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; It grew to rival known art centers like Paris and London and targeted wealthy collectors in Germany and Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Escritt (February 5, 2016), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-artfair-maastricht-idUSKCN0VE1WR Big name Dutch art fair follows flush collectors to New York] ''[[Reuters]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the fair was founded as a fair for dealers in old masters art, more than half the participants have other specialties, including antiquities, furniture, decorative artwork from medieval times to today, rare books and jewelry. By 2014, 43% of dealers at TEFAF specialized in antiques (119 out of 274 galleries).&lt;ref&gt;Gareth Harris and Anny Shaw (March 18, 2014), [http://theartnewspaper.com/articles/A-market-boom-but-only-for-some-/32074 A market boom, but only for some] ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; A shortage of museum-quality historic paintings and collectors' shifting tastes have resulted in an increasing emphasis on more recent material.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Reyburn (March 15, 2012), [http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-03-15/calvin-klein-browses-1-dot-3-billion-fair-warhol-drag-queen-sells Calvin Klein Browses $1.3 Billion Fair, Warhol Drag Queen Sells] ''[[Businessweek]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, for the first time TEFAF launched an independent study about the size and structure of the European art and antiques market, resulting in the annual publication of the Art Market Report.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tefaf.com/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=33#sthash.tzcqXmvy.dpuf TEFAF History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326094259/http://www.tefaf.com/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=33#sthash.tzcqXmvy.dpuf |date=2014-03-26 }} TEFAF Maastricht.&lt;/ref&gt; For years, the fair was considered "a footnote in the annual art market calendar", according to the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''. During the art market boom, collectors put a premium on high-profile contemporary art sales like the [[Art Basel]] fairs in Switzerland and Miami and the biannual modern and contemporary art sales of [[Christie's]] and [[Sotheby's]] in London and New York.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly Crow (March 19, 2010), [https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748703701004575113812459542060 The Old Masters Come Roaring Back] ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The fair celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2012 and is today regarded, along with Swiss modern and contemporary art fair [[Art Basel]],&lt;ref&gt;Scott Reyburn (March 12, 2012), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-03-14/liz-taylor-s-bracelet-gauguin-painting-boost-1-3-billion-fair.html Liz Taylor's Bracelet, Gauguin Painting Boost $1.3 Billion Fair] ''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; as the world's leading art fair.&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Moonan (March 9, 2007), [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/09/arts/design/09anti.html Dealers and Collectors Make the Pilgrimage to Maastricht] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

TEFAF Maastricht is regarded as unequalled in its level of quality and in the methods it employs to establish and guarantee the authenticity of every painting and object on offer. Participating dealers are admitted only after a strict selection process. TEFAF Maastricht's vetting system involves about 175 international experts in 29 different categories, who examine every work of art in the Fair for quality, authenticity and condition. A number of objects deemed inauthentic or of "poor quality" are regularly placed in storage until fair's end.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly Crow (March 19, 2010), [https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748703701004575113812459542060 The Old Masters Come Roaring Back] ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Representatives from about 225 major museums&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Studer (March 11, 2011), [https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748703580004576180191896932766 The Art World's Yearly Pilgrimage] ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; like the [[Louvre]] in Paris,&lt;ref&gt;Scott Reyburn (March 15, 2013), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-15/picasso-sells-kanye-west-lauder-view-5-4-billion-fair.html Picasso Sells: Kanye West, Lauder View $5.4 Billion Fair] ''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Prado]] in Madrid,&lt;ref&gt;Kelly Crow (March 19, 2010), [https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748703701004575113812459542060 The Old Masters Come Roaring Back] ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Frick Collection]] in New York, [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]] in Boston, the [[Rijksmuseum]] in Amsterdam, and the [[Getty Center]] in Los Angeles regularly visit the fair.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Morrison (March 15, 2006), [http://travel2.nytimes.com/2006/03/15/travel/15webletter.html An Art Fair Where Wealth Is on Display With the Rembrandts] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; TEFAF's wealthy visitors, many of whom fly in on about 170 private planes, have recently{{when|date=November 2016}} included [[Saud bin Muhammed Al Thani]], [[Silvio Berlusconi]], [[Calvin Klein]], [[Brad Pitt]], [[Kanye West]]&lt;ref&gt;Scott Reyburn (March 15, 2013), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-15/picasso-sells-kanye-west-lauder-view-5-4-billion-fair.html Picasso Sells: Kanye West, Lauder View $5.4 Billion Fair] ''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Michael Schumacher]].&lt;ref&gt;Scott Reyburn (March 12, 2012), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-03-14/liz-taylor-s-bracelet-gauguin-painting-boost-1-3-billion-fair.html Liz Taylor's Bracelet, Gauguin Painting Boost $1.3 Billion Fair] ''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, 13-year-old Brahm Wachter from New York bought a Rembrandt etching, ''Agony in the Olive Garden'' (1657), from the New York dealer David Tunick at TEFAF, using the money he received from his [[bar mitzvah]].&lt;ref&gt;Gareth Harris (March 15, 2012), [http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Tefaf:-going-Dutch-has-never-felt-better/26019 Tefaf: going Dutch has never felt better] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215140340/http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Tefaf:-going-Dutch-has-never-felt-better/26019 |date=2013-12-15 }} ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expansion plans==
Between 1995 and 1999, TEFAF Basel was held at the Messe Basel.&lt;ref&gt;Gareth Harris (March 15, 2012), [http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Tefaf:-going-Dutch-has-never-felt-better/26019 Tefaf: going Dutch has never felt better] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215140340/http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Tefaf:-going-Dutch-has-never-felt-better/26019 |date=2013-12-15 }} ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, TEFAF Maastricht considered launching a fair in New York, but could not find a site big enough to accommodate around 130 exhibitors. The [[National Building Museum]] in Washington, DC, was also mooted as a fair venue.&lt;ref&gt;Gareth Harris (March 15, 2012), [http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Tefaf:-going-Dutch-has-never-felt-better/26019 Tefaf: going Dutch has never felt better] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215140340/http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Tefaf:-going-Dutch-has-never-felt-better/26019 |date=2013-12-15 }} ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, TEFAF Maastricht announced plans to hold a high-end art and antiques fair in China.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Vogel (March 19, 2013), [http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/19/european-art-fair-may-join-with-sothebys-for-chinese-sales/ European Art Fair May Join With Sotheby's for Chinese Sales] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The new event, which would have been called TEFAF Beijing 2014, was to have been a collaboration between Maastricht and [[Sotheby's]] joint venture with China's state-owned Beijing Gehua Cultural Development Group. A venture between a dealer-organized fair and an international auction house would have been unusual, emphasizing the importance of China for the West's art and antiques trade.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Reyburn (March 19, 2013), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-19/tefaf-in-talks-with-sotheby-s-for-art-event-in-china.html Tefaf in Talks With Sotheby's for Art Event in China] ''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the plans were abandoned shortly after.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Vogel (December 12, 2013), [http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/12/plan-for-art-and-antiques-fair-in-china-falls-through/ Plan for Art and Antiques Fair in China Falls Through] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, TEFAF announced plans to hold additional fairs in New York in 2016 and 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Escritt (February 5, 2016), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-artfair-maastricht-idUSKCN0VE1WR Big name Dutch art fair follows flush collectors to New York] ''[[Reuters]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The Netherlands-based event, organized by dealers under the umbrella of the European Fine Art Foundation, a nonprofit body, is collaborating with the New York art advisers Artvest Partners to hold two annual fairs at the Park Avenue Armory. The first two fairs at the [[Park Avenue Armory]] were TEFAF New York Fall on October 21–26 and TEFAF New York Spring in May 2017.&lt;ref name="The New York Times (TEFAF New York)"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reyburn|first1=Scott|title=Maastricht Art Fair Widens Its Reach, to New York|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/04/arts/design/tefaf-maastricht-art-fair-new-york.html?ribbon-ad-idx=5&amp;rref=world&amp;_r=2&amp;module=ArrowsNav&amp;contentCollection=Art%20%26%20Design&amp;action=swipe&amp;region=FixedRight&amp;pgtype=article|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artfixdaily.com/artwire/release/254-tefaf-new-york-fall-returns-with-new-exhibitors|title=TEFAF New York Fall Returns With New Exhibitors|website=ArtfixDaily|language=en|access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants scheduled for the October fair included Bernard Goldberg Fine Arts, LLC, Carolle Thibaut-Pomerantz, [[Phoenix Ancient Art]] and many others.&lt;ref name="Artnet News (TEFAF)"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boucher|first1=Brian|title=TEFAF Reveals Roster of Exhibitors for Inaugural New York Fair|url=https://news.artnet.com/market/tefaf-exhibitors-inaugural-new-york-fair-517208|publisher=Artnet News|accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Golden Turkey Awards''''' is a 1980 book by film critic [[Michael Medved]] and his brother Harry.

==About==
The book awards "Golden Turkey Awards" to [[film]]s judged by the authors as poor in quality, and to [[film director|directors]] and actors judged to have created a chronically inept body of work. The book features many low-budget obscurities and exploitation films such as ''[[Rat Pfink a Boo Boo]]'', ''[[Attack of the 50 Foot Woman]]'', and the apparently lost ''[[Him (film)|Him]]''. Other categories include expensive, big studio failures like ''[[The Swarm (film)|The Swarm]]'' and popular films such as ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar (film)|Jesus Christ Superstar]]''.

In the introduction the authors admit that "we know our choices will not please everyone&amp;mdash;least of all the actors, producers, writers and directors who are honored in the pages that follow. We further recognize that the number of bad films is so enormous and the competition for the very worst is so intense, that all decisions reached here are subject to considerable second-guessing. Nevertheless, we have researched the subject thoroughly&amp;mdash;sitting through more than 2,000 wretched films in the last few years&amp;mdash;and we believe that our nominees and award winners can stand the test of time."

The Medveds had previously celebrated bad cinema in ''[[The Fifty Worst Films of All Time]]'', many of which were also featured in the various ''Golden Turkey Awards'' categories. Subsequently, they turned their attention to [[box office bomb]]s in ''[[The Hollywood Hall of Shame]]''. They also published a sequel to ''The Golden Turkey Awards'', ''Son of Golden Turkey Awards,'' in 1986. They declared that ''Son of Golden Turkey Awards'' "is our last word...we hereby solemnly pledge that the years ahead will produce no further Golden Turkey publications by the Medved Brothers...we now pass the torch to whichever brave souls feel ready to take up the challenge." ''Son of Golden Turkey Awards'' also listed a "Who's Who in the World of Bad Movies" at the end of its awards presentations.

The Golden Turkey Awards formed the basis of a 1983 television series ''[[The Worst of Hollywood]]'' hosted by Michael Medved.

==Awards given==
In the book ''The Fifty Worst Films of All Time'' the authors invited readers to write in nominating their favorite "worst films". More than 3,000 ballots were received. Based on these votes, the Worst Film of All Time award was given to ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]'' by [[Ed Wood]].

Wood is also awarded the title of Worst Director of All Time, judged by the authors. 
[[Raquel Welch]] is judged the Worst Actress of All Time over nominees including [[Candice Bergen]] and [[Mamie van Doren]].

[[Richard Burton]] is judged as the Worst Actor of All Time over nominees [[John Agar]], [[Tony Curtis]] and [[Victor Mature]]. While conceding he is sometimes brilliant, the authors claim Burton's "occasional triumphs only serve to highlight the pathetic waste in most of his films; for every ''[[Equus (film)|Equus]]'' in which he appears there are at least a half-dozen ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]''s or ''[[Boom!

==Hoax film==
One of the films nominated in the book was in fact an invention of the authors, and readers were challenged to figure out which film was actually fake. The fake film was ''Dog of Norway'' featuring "Muki the Wonder Hound". This film was illustrated using a photo of a co-author's dog. The giveaway was that the same dog was in the photo of the authors in the back of the book. Another film in the book, the now-lost 1974 porn film ''[[Him (film)|Him]]'', has also been cited as the hoax, though it is known to have existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Mark Goodacre |authorlink=Mark Goodacre |date=May 19, 2005 |title=Gay Jesus Film Hoax? |work=NT Blog |url=http://ntweblog.blogspot.com/2005/05/gay-jesus-film-hoax.html |accessdate=2009-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

No formal clarification of the hoax film was provided by the subsequent release, ''The Hollywood Hall of Shame''. That book again features the same dog pictured with the authors (as did the subsequent ''Son of Golden Turkey Awards''). In ''The Hollywood Hall of Shame'', in reference to the dish barbecued dog, the authors explain that it was "a snack which produced a mixed reaction among the representatives of an industry that had given the world [[Lassie]], [[Rin Tin Tin]], [[Benji]], [[Phyllis Diller]], and Muki the Wonder Hound."&lt;ref&gt;Harry Medved and [[Michael Medved]]. ''[[The Hollywood Hall of Shame]]'' London, Sydney, Melbourne, Singapore, Manila: Angus and Robertson Publishers, 1984. {{ISBN|0-207-14929-1}}. p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Acknowledgements" page of ''The Fifty Worst Films of All Time'' ends with:
::And love, most of all, to Muki, who was there to understand when the going got rough.

'''''The straw hat''''' is an oil painting by [[Nikolaos Lytras]] created in 1925, and is considered as one of the most daring and impressive works of early Greek [[Modernism]].

'''''The Submission of Prince Dipo Negoro to General De Kock''''' ({{lang-nl|De onderwerping van Diepo Negoro aan luitenant-generaal baron De Kock}}) is an [[oil painting]] on [[canvas]] painted by [[Nicolaas Pieneman]] between 1830 and 1835. It depicts, from a victorious [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonial]]  perspective, the capture of Prince [[Diponegoro]] in 1830, which signaled the end of the [[Java War]] (1825–1830).

==Description==
The painting depicts the capture of Prince [[Diponegoro]], a [[Javanese people|Javanese]] noble and major leader in the [[Java War]], by Lieutenant General [[Hendrik Merkus de Kock]] on 28 March 1830. The arrest is portrayed from a Dutch colonial perspective, with Diponegoro abandoning his followers and submitting peacefully to a confident De Kock as the Dutch flag flies high above the lieutenant general's home.{{sfn|Rijksmuseum}} Diponegoro stands a step below De Kock, who is pointing towards the carriage which will take the guerrilla leader into exile.{{Sfn|Krauss|2005|p=282}}{{sfn|Rajaram|2014|p=155}}

Diponegoro's soldiers leave their weapons on the ground, following their leader's submission;{{sfn|Rijksmuseum}} some throw themselves to the ground in front of him.{{Sfn|Levie|1978|p=190}} All appear submissive to the Dutch power, in what the art historian Werner Krauss describes as recognition that "de Kock's stern action is for the best of the Javanese, and that poor General de Kock had no choice but to send Pangeran Diponegoro away, just like a loving father has to send a misguided son away in order to teach him a valuable lesson".{{Sfn|Krauss|2005|p=282}}{{sfn|Rajaram|2014|p=155}}

This [[oil painting]] on [[canvas]] measures {{convert|77|by|100|cm}}.{{sfn|Rijksmuseum}}

==History==
Diponegoro (1785–1855), a descendant of the [[Sultan of Yogyakarta|Sultans of Yogyakarta]], was passed over several times for ascension to the throne.{{sfn|Encarta}} In 1825, after declaring himself [[Ratu Adil]] and his enemies infidels for their lax practice of Islam, he began a war against the reigning sultan and the Dutch colonial government. In the five-year struggle that followed, which was waged over much of central [[Java]], over 200,000 [[Javanese people|Javanese]] and 15,000 Dutch soldiers were killed.{{Sfn|Protschky|2011|p=74}} On 28 March 1830, with most other guerrilla leaders captured, Diponegoro was invited to come to Lieutenant General De Kock's home in [[Magelang]] to negotiate an end of hostilities and guaranteed safety of passage. There, after three hours, Diponegoro was arrested.{{sfn|Rijksmuseum}} He was exiled to [[Makassar]], [[Sulawesi]], where he remained until his death.{{sfn|Encarta}}

''The Submission of Prince Dipo Negoro'' was commissioned by De Kock{{Sfn|Krauss|2005|p=279}} or his family.{{Sfn|Levie|1978|p=190}} The artist, [[Nicolaas Pieneman]], never went to the Dutch colony in the Indies, and thus it is unclear upon what he based his depictions of the area around De Kock's home, or the faces and other physical features of those depicted.{{Sfn|Levie|1978|p=190}}
Indeed, the Javanese soldiers appear more Arabian than [[pribumi|indigene]].{{Sfn|Krauss|2005|p=282}} It is possible that Pieneman was inspired by sketches by De Kock or his adjunct, Major Francois Victor Henri Antoine Ridder de Stuer.{{Sfn|Krauss|2005|p=282}}{{Sfn|Levie|1978|p=190}}

[[File:Raden Saleh - Diponegoro arrest.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[The Arrest of Pangeran Diponegoro]]'', by [[Raden Saleh]]]]
This painting was held by the De Kock family, until it was donated to the [[Rijksmuseum]] in Amsterdam on 29 January 1907 by F.L.W. de Kock. Between 1 December 1993 and 31 March 1994, it was part of an exhibition of colonial art in [[Harderwijk]]. In 2014, it was on display in Room 1.17 of the Rijksmuseum.{{sfn|Rijksmuseum}}

Diponegoro's capture is the subject of another painting, ''[[The Arrest of Pangeran Diponegoro]]'' by the Javanese nobleman [[Raden Saleh]], which was completed in 1857 and presented to [[William III of the Netherlands|King William III]].{{Sfn|Protschky|2011|p=74}} Opposed to the submissive and beaten Diponegoro of Pieneman's painting, Saleh depicts him as an angry and defiant man who is struggling to control his emotions, on par with or even having more power than De Kock, who is positioned on the left or "female" side.{{Sfn|Protschky|2011|p=74}}{{Sfn|Krauss|2005|p=284}} The author Susie Protschky describes both Pieneman and Saleh's works as "two of the best known history paintings from the Indies".{{Sfn|Protschky|2011|p=74}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18896">The following is '''a list of [[The Wachowskis]]' unproduced projects''' in roughly chronological order. During their long careers, [[The Wachowskis]] have worked on a number of projects which never progressed beyond the pre-production stage under their direction. Some of these projects fell in [[development hell]] and are presumably or officially canceled.

== 1990s ==

=== ''Plastic Man'' ===
In 1995, [[The Wachowskis]] wrote a script for a film adaptation of the [[Plastic Man]] comic book series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2003/06/05/the-stax-report-script-review-of-plastic-man|title=The Stax Report: Script Review of Plastic Man|first=|last=Stax|date=5 June 2003|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2003/11/matrix/|title=Matrix Revelations|first=Mark|last=Miller|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was planned to be developed by [[Warner Bros.]]. However, due unknown reasons, the film was never made, although the script was finally leaked online by [[Yahoo! Movies]] columnist and reader [[Greg Dean Schmitz]] in June 2003, one month after the release of ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/preview/1808492632|title=Plastic Man|date=2003-11-06|accessdate=2007-07-28|publisher=[[Yahoo! Movies]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Vertical Run'' ===
Around 1996, [[The Wachowskis]] wrote a script for a film adaptation of [[Joseph R. Garber]]'s thriller ''Vertical Run''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://powergrid.thewrap.com/project/vertical-run|title=Vertical Run - PowerGrid|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the film wasn't made, and after Garber's subsequent death in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Joseph-Garber-author-of-thrillers-2665581.php|title=Joseph Garber -- author of thrillers|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; it's very unlikely that the film would be made.

=== ''Carnivore'' ===
This was the first film script written by [[The Wachowskis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/adambvary/the-wachowskis-jupiter-ascending-the-matrix-cloud-atlas|title=The Wachowskis Refuse To Take No For An Answer|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as "a Corman-style, low-budget horror movie that dealt with [[cannibalism]] or, more specifically, millionaires being eaten by cannibals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/05/movies/brothers-unleash-the-comic-book-of-ideas.html|title=Brothers Unleash the Comic Book of Ideas|date=5 April 1999|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The writing was well received and the script made the duo minded, although interest in making the film was low as executives told them "This is a bad idea. I can't make this. I'm rich." On April 6, 1999, a week after ''[[The Matrix]]'' opened in theaters, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that [[Trimark]] was considering purchase of the script and that they were in talks with [[George Romero]] to direct it with production slated to begin in August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1999/film/news/trimark-bites-into-carnivore-1117492968/|title=Trimark bites into ‘Carnivore’|first=Andrew|last=Hindes|date=April 6, 1999|work=variety.com|accessdate=September 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2001, it was reported that [[The Wachowskis]] were producing it for [[Lionsgate]] and looking for a director surfaced again (meaning Romero's departure from the project),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,280905,00.html|title=Reel World: The Wachowski Brothers|last=Ascher|first=Rebecca|date=April 20, 2001|publisher=EW.com|accessdate=August 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in August 2003 a second time, with their go-to cinematographer [[Bill Pope]] supposed to be making his directorial debut with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Dixon |first1=Don |last2=Goldsmith |first2=Jeff |last3=Hewitt |first3=Chris |issue=170 |date=August 2003 |title=The twelve best unmade scripts in Hollywood |magazine=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]] |publisher=[[Bauer Media Group]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, to the disappointment of [[The Wachowskis]], the film was never produced.

=== ''Hard Boiled'' ===
On August 22, 1999, five months after the release of ''[[The Matrix]]'', it was reported that [[The Wachowskis]] were considering an animated film adaptation of the ''[[Hard Boiled (comics)|Hard Boiled]]'' comic book series, in which [[Geof Darrow]], the conceptional designer of [[The Matrix (franchise)|''The Matrix'' trilogy]], participated as cartoonist.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tovima.gr/culture/article/?aid=113699|title=tovima.gr - Λάρι και Αντι Γουατσόφσκι|first=tovima.gr — Δημοσιογραφικός Οργανισμός Λαμπράκη|last=Α.Ε.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Bleeding Cool]] later reported that the project was cancelled due the fact that the ''[[Hard Boiled (comics)|Hard Boiled]]'' creator [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] didn't want to see his creation as an animated film.&lt;ref name="bleedingcool.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2012/07/13/geof-darrow-wachowski-shaolin-cowboy-hard-boiled-sf-superhero/|title=The Hard Boiled Wachowski Movie That Almost Was, The Shaolin Cowboy Movie That Is, And The Darrow/Wachowski SF/Superhero Movie That May Be|date=13 July 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2000s ==

=== ''King Conan: Crown of Iron'' ===
On November 6, 2000, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that [[The Wachowskis]] were working with [[Warner Bros.]] to make a [[Reboot (fiction)|film reboot]] of ''[[Conan the Barbarian]]'', due to the unsuccessful reception of ''[[Conan the Destroyer]]''. [[The Wachowskis]] originally attempted to film ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]'' and ''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]'' and work on this film at the same time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2000/film/news/milius-to-pen-helm-wb-s-conan-1117788858/|title=Milius to pen, helm WB’s ‘Conan’|first=Michael|last=Fleming|date=7 November 2000|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 20, 2004, however, via [[IGN]], [[Lilly Wachowski]] reported that the film entitled ''King Conan: Crown of Iron'' was stalled for years due to her and her sister [[Lana Wachowski|Lana]]'s lack of interest after finishing the filming of ''[[The Matrix]]'' sequels,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/01/20/ign-filmforce-exclusive-the-wachowskis-leave-conan|title=IGN FilmForce Exclusive: The Wachowskis Leave Conan|first=|last=Stax|date=20 January 2004|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Lana and Lilly stated that ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' was their favorite movie based on comics.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

=== ''Batman: Year One'' ===
Around 2001, [[Warner Bros.]] commissioned [[The Wachowskis]] the rewrite of the [[Darren Aronofsky]]'s planned film adaptation of [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s ''[[Batman: Year One]]''. However, [[The Wachowskis]]' script didn't convince Warner and the project was finally cancelled in June 2002 in favor of the also cancelled ''Batman vs. Superman''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warpedfactor.com/2014/09/8-unmade-batman-movies.html|title=8 Unmade BATMAN Movies|publisher=|accessdate=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Shaolin Cowboy and the Tomb of Doom'' ===
In 2008, [[The Wachowskis]] were reported of being working with [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]] to make an animated film adaptation of the ''[[Shaolin Cowboy]]'' comic book series.&lt;ref name="previewsworld.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.previewsworld.com/Article/138165-Giddy-Up-with-Geof-Darrow-Writer-of-Shaolin-Cowboy-from-Dark-Horse|title=Giddy Up with Geof Darrow, Writer of Shaolin Cowboy from Dark Horse|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/4639-c2e2-announces-ten-top-artist-appearances.html|title=C2E2 Announces Ten Top Artist Appearances|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2009/scene/markets-festivals/circle-of-confusion-hires-emery-1118002955/|title=Circle of Confusion hires Emery|first=Dave|last=McNary|date=29 April 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's title was eventually revealed as ''Shaolin Cowboy and the Tomb of Doom''.&lt;ref name="bleedingcool.com"/&gt; Darrow and Japanese director [[Seiji Mizushima]] were attached to direct the film.&lt;ref name="previewsworld.com"/&gt; However, according to Darrow, the film's production was finally left unfinished after the lack of money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbr.com/cci-geof-darrow-remembers-moebius-talks-animated-shaolin-cowboy/|title=CCI: Geof Darrow Remembers Moebius, Talks Animated|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Speed Racer 2'' ===
Before the release of ''[[Speed Racer (film)|Speed Racer]]'', ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' stated that a sequel to the film could happen if the film had a good box office performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2008/film/news/speed-racer-aims-for-multiple-tie-ins-1117979682/|title=‘Speed Racer’ aims for multiple tie-ins|first=Marc|last=Graser|date=26 January 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, a possible sequel was contemplated by [[The Wachowskis]] when [[Rain (entertainer)|Rain]] asked them why his character was so happy that Speed won; they replied it could be explained in the next film. Rain said he was hired for three years, while noting that did not guarantee a sequel would be released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.scifijapan.com/articles/2008/05/09/speed-racer-interview-with-rain/ | title=Speed Racer: Interview with Rain | date=May 9, 2008 | publisher=SciFi Japan | accessdate=August 14, 2013 | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QhgSUKAT | archivedate=June 29, 2014 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christina Ricci]] also considered it a possibility; she stated "When we [the cast] were all leaving, we were like 'write the sequel!' 'We want to come back'. And they [the Wachowskis] were like, 'I know. I know. We're going to. Don't worry'", adding she would like more action scenes for her character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=44448 | title=Christina Ricci on ''Speed Racer'' Sequel | author=Newgen, Heather | date=April 26, 2008 | work=ComingSoon.net | publisher=CraveOnline | accessdate=August 14, 2013 | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QhgTIFAK | archivedate=June 29, 2014 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The producer [[Joel Silver]] said that the Wachowskis "have a great story idea for a sequel" but that it is "a great idea for a sequel if it makes sense to make it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://collider.com/entertainment/interviews/article.asp/aid/7641/tcid/1 | title=Joel Silver talks Ninja Assassin (not Assassins) | date=April 19, 2008 | publisher=Collider.com | accessdate=October 29, 2013 | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QhgTukca | archivedate=June 29, 2014 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, any sequel to this film was not made, implying that the project was cancelled.

=== ''Cobalt Neural 9'' ===
In December 2009, [[Arianna Huffington]] tweeted pictures of herself on the set of "a [[The Wachowskis|Wachowskis]] movie on [[Iraq]] from the perspective of the future".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/wtf-secret-wachowski-brothers-futuristic-war-movie-in-production/|title=WTF: Secret Wachowski Brothers Futuristic War Movie In Production? - /Film|date=December 7, 2009|work=slashfilm.com|accessdate=September 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[CHUD.com]]'' reported what the Wachowskis were doing was camera tests and shooting of test footage on the [[Red Digital Cinema Camera Company|Red digital camera]] for a future movie, but not shooting the movie itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091213004831/http://chud.com/articles/articles/21767/1/THE-WACHOWSKIS-ARE-NOT-SECRETLY-SHOOTING-THEIR-NEXT-MOVIE-RIGHT-NOW/Page1.html|title=THE WACHOWSKIS ARE NOT SECRETLY SHOOTING THEIR NEXT MOVIE RIGHT NOW|date=December 13, 2009|work=archive.org|accessdate=September 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2010, [[Jesse Ventura]] said he had also shot for the project right before Huffington. Both of them were dressed as people from roughly 100 years in the future and they were asked to improvise without a script about the [[Iraq War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/jesse-ventura-also-filmed-role-in-secret-wachowski-brothers-futuristic-war-movie/|title=Jesse Ventura Also Filmed Role in The Wachowskis' Secret Futuristic War Movie - /Film|date=March 10, 2010|work=slashfilm.com|accessdate=September 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2010, ''Deadline'' reported the movie was going to be a hard-R story that would begin in the future but move back to the then-current war in Iraq and center on the homosexual relationship between an American soldier and an Iraqi. The Wachowskis completed the script and were searching for funding to direct it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2010/05/larry-and-andy-wachowski-shop-u-s-iraqi-war-tale-with-hard-r-gay-love-story-41130/|title=Larry And Andy Wachowski Shop U.S.-Iraqi War Tale With 'Hard R' Gay Love Story|first=Mike Fleming|last=Jr|date=May 14, 2010|work=deadline.com|accessdate=September 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2010, the movie was reported to have begun casting under the codename ''CN9'' (or ''CN-9''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/the-wachowskis-gay-iraq-romance-begins-casting-has-a-title-cn9/|title=The Wachowskis Gay Iraq Romance Begins Casting, Has a Title: CN9 - /Film|date=July 13, 2010|work=slashfilm.com|accessdate=September 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in August 2010 the full name was revealed as ''Cobalt Neural 9''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2010/08/no-script-for-you-actors-vying-for-big-parts-cant-read-full-screenplays-59763/|title=NO SCRIPT FOR YOU!

An estimated $20 million budget was reported although they were told a studio would "never, ever" finance it but perhaps the Wachowskis could do it themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2010/09/weve_got_details_on_the_wachow.html|title=We’ve Got Details on the Wachowskis’s Top-Secret Gay Iraq War Romance Cobalt Neural 9|date=September 22, 2010|work=vulture.com|accessdate=September 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2010, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' reported that [[Salman Rushdie]] and [[Cornel West]] had also shot talking head sequences along with the previously reported involvement of Huffington and Ventura but the Wachowskis were currently looking into other movies because of troubles financing it.&lt;ref name="HR"&gt;{{cite news |first=Borys |last=Kit |title=Exclusive: Wachowskis, Warner Bros.

Club|accessdate=December 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2010s ==

=== ''Hood'' ===
In December 2010, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' wrote that [[The Wachowskis]] were planning to direct for [[Warner Bros.]] a script of theirs called ''Hood'', which was a modern adaptation of the [[Robin Hood]] legend. [[The Wachowskis]] were said to be reaching out to actors, including [[Will Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150311043328/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/blogs/heat-vision/wachowskis-warner-bros-aim-hood-57312|title=EXCLUSIVE: Wachowskis, Warner Bros. Take Aim With 'Hood' - Heat Vision|date=11 March 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, no update was made after this, implying that the film likely had been canceled.

=== ''The Matrix 4'' ===
On January 23, 2011, [[Mental Floss]] reported that [[The Wachowskis]] had spoken with [[Keanu Reeves]] to make two more films of ''[[The Matrix (franchise)|The Matrix]]'', with Reeves reprising his role as [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]]. However, it was later discovered that the news were false and that it was all a hoax from [[Ain't It Cool News]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstshowing.net/2011/big-rumor-keanu-says-two-more-matrix-movies-are-in-the-works/|title=Big Rumor: Keanu Says Two More 'Matrix' Movies Are in the Works?|publisher=|accessdate=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, on September 28, 2013, [[Mental Floss]] reported that during an unspecified moment, The Wachowskis planned to make a fourth ''[[The Matrix (franchise)|The Matrix]]'' film, but the project was cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/52785/55-unfortunately-unfinished-films|title=55 Unfortunately Unfinished Films|date=18 September 2013|publisher=|accessdate=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 2016, producer [[Joel Silver]] was asked if any other ''[[The Matrix (franchise)|The Matrix]]'' movie would be made in the future, to what he said that he stated; &lt;blockquote&gt;We haven’t talked about it yet. I hope there’ll be a time we can do that at some point. That was very seriously designed as [[The Matrix (franchise)|three stories]] and that was it, but we’ll see what happens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/new/More-Matrix-Movies-Here-What-Trilogy-Producer-Thinks-134127.html|title=More Matrix Movies?

'''''The cricketers''''' is a [[1948 in art|1948]] painting by the Australian artist [[Russell Drysdale]]. The painting depicts three boys set among the buildings in an empty town; two playing [[cricket]] and the other watching them. The [[National Gallery of Australia]] describes the painting as "one of the most original and haunting images in all Australian art."&lt;ref name="NGA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nga.gov.au/Federation/Detail.cfm?WorkID=26575|title=The cricketers  |work=Federation: Australian art and society|publisher=National Gallery of Australia|accessdate=2009-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' said the work is "possibly the most famous Australian painting of the 20th century."&lt;ref name="Meacham"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/entertainment/arts/montmartre-with-eucalypts/2009/06/05/1243708612484.html|title=Montmartre, with eucalypts|last=Meacham|first=Steve |date=6 June 2009 |work=Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax|accessdate=2009-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The painting was commissioned by Walter Hutchinson, an English publisher, for his own collection, known as the "National Collection of British Sports and Pastimes". Looking for a picture of an Australian cricket match, Hutchinson asked his [[Melbourne]] office to commission a well-known Australian artist for this purpose.  Leonard Voss Smith, an art dealer who often worked for Hutchinson, spoke to Drysdale who was then painting in the town of [[Hill End, New South Wales|Hill End]] in the [[Central West, New South Wales|Central West]] region of [[New South Wales]].&lt;ref name="NGV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/drysdale/paintings/36.htm |title=The cricketers |date=1999 |work=Russell Drysdale |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation &amp; National Gallery of Victoria |accessdate=2009-08-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619120322/http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/drysdale/paintings/36.htm |archivedate=June 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Drysdale accepted the commission, worth £150.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.alphalink.com.au/~loge27/art_aust/art_aus_drysdaleretro.htm|title=Russell Drysdale Retrospective|last=McQueen|first=Humphrey |work=Art - Australian|accessdate=2009-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When complete, Voss Smith sent Drysdale's work through to Hutchinson in England. Hutchinson was shocked, the painting was nothing like what he had expected. Immediately Hutchinson sent a telegram back to Melbourne, firing Smith. The next day Hutchinson reconsidered and rehired Voss Smith, after satisfying himself that Drysdale was a respected artist in Australia.&lt;ref name="NGV" /&gt;

The painting, valued in 2004 at A$6,000,000, is now owned by JGL Investments, a Melbourne-based investment company. It was last on public exhibition in 1998.&lt;ref name="Bernays"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://google.com/search?q=cache%3AWKQfNWdBGcUJ%3Awww.holartbooks.com%2Fdocuments%2Fproject-book-samples%2Fsample_bernays_houseofpictures.pdf+Drysdale+%22The+cricketers%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=au|title=A Game of Cricket|last=Bernays|first=Elizabeth|work=House of Pictures|publisher=Hol Art Books|accessdate=2009-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition and legacy==
The painting was a departure from earlier artistic visions of Australia with a ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' review noting "Drysdale’s large composition of 'cricketers' under leaden skies in the wide open spaces of burning sands dramatises the 'outback' as it has never been dramatised before."&lt;ref name="Metropolis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metropolisgallery.com.au/collectors/collectors0808/meilerts_biography.htm|title=Ludmilla Meilerts|publisher=Metropolis Gallery|accessdate=2009-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Gallery of Australia claim that the work "succeeds as art by abandoning any pretence to illustrative realism."&lt;ref name="NGA" /&gt;

The model&lt;ref name="NGV" /&gt; for the [[batting (cricket)|batsman]] was Teddy Woolard and Roy Holloway was the model for the [[bowling (cricket)|bowler]]. In 1996, after the models were identified, Woolard was asked for his opinion of Drysdale's portrayal; "I just don't rate it ... It makes us all look out of proportion."&lt;ref name="Sport"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2009/02/07/1233423563540.html|title=Sporting masterpieces|last=Tate|first=Andrew|date=8 February 2009|work=The Age|publisher=Fairfax|accessdate=2009-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The town of Hill End itself is not as desolate as shown in the painting, with a later visitor to Hill End remarking "Even the scattered buildings&amp;mdash;so blank and menacing in The Cricketers&amp;mdash;appear as if ripped from the cover of a chocolate box."&lt;ref name="Jinman"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/travel/village-with-an-art-of-gold-20081127-6j53.html|title=Village with an art of gold|last=Jinman|first=Richard|date=29 November 2008|work=Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax|accessdate=2009-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Torque à tampons Somme-Suippe Musée Saint-Remi 120208.jpg|thumb|[[Bronze]] 4th-century&amp;nbsp;BC buffer-type torc from France]]
[[File:StervendeGalaathoofd.jpg|thumb|''[[The Dying Gaul]]'']]
A '''torc''', also spelled '''torq''' or '''torque''', is a large rigid or stiff [[neck ring]] in metal, made either as a single piece or from strands twisted together.  The great majority are open at the front, although some had hook and ring closures and a few had [[mortice and tenon]] locking catches to close them. Many seem designed for near-permanent wear and would have been difficult to remove.  Torcs are found in the [[Scythian]], [[Illyria]]n,&lt;ref&gt;The Illyrians by J. J. Wilkes, 1992, {{ISBN|0-631-19807-5}}, page 223, "Illyrian chiefs wore heavy bronze torques"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thrace|Thracian]], [[Celts|Celtic]], and other cultures of the [[European Iron Age]] from around the 8th century&amp;nbsp;BC to the 3rd century&amp;nbsp;AD.  For the Iron Age Celts the gold torc seems to have been a key object, identifying the wearer as a person of high rank, and many of the finest works of ancient [[Celtic art]] are torcs.  The Celtic torc disappears in the [[Migration Period]], but during the [[Viking Age]] torc-style metal necklaces, now mainly in silver, came back into fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Cornish, [http://www.cdli.ca/CITE/v_hoards.htm Elementary: Viking Hoards] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014141731/http://www.cdli.ca/CITE/v_hoards.htm |date=2007-10-14 }}, on the Centre for Distance Learning &amp; Innovation Website&lt;/ref&gt; Torc styles of neck-ring are found as part of the jewellery styles of various other cultures and periods.

==Terminology and definition==
The word comes from [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:torquis|torquis]]'' (or ''torques''), from ''[[wikt:torqueo|torqueo]]'', "to twist", because of the twisted shape many of the rings have.  Typically, neck-rings that open at the front when worn are called "torcs" and those that open at the back "collars".  Smaller [[bracelet]]s and [[armlet]]s worn around the wrist or on the upper arm sometimes share very similar forms.  Torcs were made from single or multiple intertwined [[metal]] rods, or "ropes" of twisted wire. Most of those that have been found are made from gold or bronze, less often silver, iron or other metals (gold, bronze and silver survive better than other metals when buried for long periods).  Elaborate examples,  sometimes hollow, used a variety of techniques but complex decoration was usually begun by [[casting]] and then worked by further techniques. The [[Ipswich Hoard]] includes unfinished torcs that give clear evidence of the stages of work.&lt;ref&gt;Brailsford, 19&lt;/ref&gt; Flat-ended terminals are called "buffers", and in types like the "fused-buffer" shape, where what resemble two terminals are actually a single piece, the element is called a "muff".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=830688 Example in the British Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bronze Age Europe and the East==
[[File:Bronshalsring fr Badelundaåsen Västmanland (Montelius 1917 fig1458).jpg|thumb|left|Unusually complex Swedish Bronze Age spiral ribbon torc in bronze]]
There are several types of rigid gold and sometimes bronze necklaces and collars of the later [[European Bronze Age]], from around 1200 BC, many of which are classed as "torcs". They are mostly twisted in various conformations, including the "twisted ribbon" type, where a thin strip of gold is twisted into a spiral.  Other examples twist a bar with a square or X section, or just use round wire, with both types in the three 12th– or 11th-century&amp;nbsp;BC specimens found at Tiers Cross, Pembrokeshire, Wales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artfund.org/artwork/2837/three-bronze-age-torcs Art Saved: Three Bronze Age Torcs], on the Art Fund Website&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Milton Keynes Hoard]], contained two large examples of thicker rounded forms, as also used for bracelets.&lt;ref name="tar2000"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncmd.co.uk/docs/treasurereport2000.pdf|title=Treasure Annual Report 2000|publisher=[[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]]|pages=13–15; 133|year=2001|accessdate=2010-07-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301112414/http://www.ncmd.co.uk/docs/treasurereport2000.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Lambourne Hoard.jpg|thumb|Two uncleaned Bronze Age twisted bar torcs with flared cylinder terminals, as often found folded up, with bracelets, England]]

The terminals are not emphasized as in typical Iron Age torcs, though many can be closed by hooking the simple terminals together.  Many of these "torcs" are too small to be worn round the neck of an adult, and were either worn as bracelets or armlets, or by children or statues.  Archaeologists find dating many torcs difficult, with some believing torcs were retained for periods of centuries as heirlooms, and others believing there were two periods of production.  Differing ratios of silver in the gold of other objects—typically up to 15% in the Bronze Age but up to 20% in the Iron Age—can help decide the question.&lt;ref&gt;Cahill, 120−121&lt;/ref&gt;  There are several flared gold torcs with a C-shaped section in the huge [[Mooghaun North Hoard]] of Late Bronze Age gold from 800 to 700 BC found in [[County Clare]] in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, 99; Treasures, no. 8. Nos. 4 and 6 are Bronze Age gold spiral ribbon torcs, and No. 10 is an elaborate flat collar. Taylor has full coverage of British gold Bronze age material.&lt;/ref&gt;

To the East, torcs appear in [[Scythian art]] from the [[Early Iron Age]], and include "classicizing" decoration drawing on styles from the east.  Torcs are also found in [[Thraco-Cimmerian]] art.  Torcs are found in the [[Tolstaya burial]] and the Karagodeuashk kurgan ([[Kuban]] area), both dating to the 4th century&amp;nbsp;BC. A torc is part of the [[Pereshchepina]] hoard dating to the 7th century AD.  Thin torcs, often with animal head terminals, are found in the art of the Persian [[Achaemenid Empire]], with some other elements derived from Scythian art.

==Celtic torcs==
[[File:Gold torque 2.jpg|left|thumb|Gold Celtic torc with three "balusters" and decoration including animals, found in [[Glauberg]], Germany, 400&amp;nbsp;BC]]

Depictions of the gods and goddesses of [[Celtic mythology]] sometimes show them wearing or carrying torcs, as in images of the god [[Cernunnos]] wearing one torc around his neck, with torcs hanging from his antlers or held in his hand, as on the [[Gundestrup cauldron]].  This may represent the deity as the source of power and riches, as the torc was a sign of nobility and high social status.&lt;ref&gt;Green, 78−79&lt;/ref&gt; The famous Roman copy of the original Greek sculpture ''[[Dying Gaul|The Dying Gaul]]'' depicts a wounded Gaulish warrior naked except for a torc, which is how [[Polybius]] described the ''[[gaesatae]]'', Celtic warriors from modern northern Italy or the [[Alps]], fighting at the [[Battle of Telamon]] in 225 BC, although other Celts there were clothed.&lt;ref name="Green, 77"&gt;Green, 77&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest known depictions of a torc can be found on the [[Warrior of Hirschlanden]] (6th century&amp;nbsp;BC), and a high proportion of the few Celtic statues of human figures, mostly male, show them wearing torcs.

Other possible functions that have been proposed for torcs include use as rattles in rituals or otherwise, as some have stones or metal pieces inside them, and representations of figures thought to be deities carrying torcs in their hand may depict this. Some are too heavy to wear for long, and may have been made to place on cult statues. Very few of these remain but they may well have been in wood and not survived. Torcs were clearly valuable, and often found broken in pieces, so being a [[store of value]] may have been an important part of their use. It has been noted that the Iberian gold examples seem to be made at fixed weights that are multiples of the [[Phoenicia]]n [[shekel]].&lt;ref&gt;González-Ruibal, "Torcs"&lt;/ref&gt;

With bracelets, torcs are "the most important category of Celtic gold", though armlets and anklets were also worn; in contrast finger-rings were less common among the early Celts.&lt;ref&gt;Green, 45, 74−77&lt;/ref&gt;  The earliest Celtic torcs are mostly found buried with women, for example, the gold torc from the [[La Tène period]] [[chariot burial]] of a princess, found in the [[Waldalgesheim chariot burial]] in Germany, and others found in female graves at [[Vix Grave|Vix]] in France (illustrated) and [[Reinheim]]. Another La Tène example was found as part of a hoard or ritual deposit buried near [[Erstfeld]] in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hp.uab.edu/image_archive/uj/ujk.html Iron Age Western Europe from c. 800 B.C. − La Tène] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20021008145708/http://www.hp.uab.edu/image_archive/uj/ujk.html |date=2002-10-08 }}, on the Images from World History Website&lt;/ref&gt;  It is thought by some authors that the torc was mostly an ornament for women until the late 3rd century&amp;nbsp;BC, when it became an attribute of warriors.&lt;ref&gt;Green, 45−48, 74&lt;/ref&gt;  However, there is evidence for male wear in the early period; in a rich double burial of the [[Hallstatt period]] at [[Hochmichele]], the man wears an iron torc and the female a necklace with beads.&lt;ref&gt;Green, 73&lt;/ref&gt;  A heavy torc in silver over an iron core with bull's head terminals, weighing over 6 kilos, from [[Trichtingen]], Germany, probably dates to the 2nd century&amp;nbsp;BC (illustrated).&lt;ref&gt;Laings, 69, 71&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Britishmuseumsnettishamgreattorc.jpg|thumb|The [[Snettisham Hoard|Snettishham Torc]]]]

Many finds of torcs, especially in groups and in association with other valuables but not associated with a burial, are clearly deliberate deposits whose function is unclear. They may have been ritual deposits or hidden for safekeeping in times of warfare. Some may represent the work-in-progress of a workshop.&lt;ref&gt;Green, 45, 49, 70&lt;/ref&gt;  After the early period, torcs are especially prominent in the Celtic cultures reaching to a coast of the [[Atlantic]], from modern Spain to Ireland, and on both sides of the [[English Channel]].

Some very elaborately worked torcs with relief decoration in a late form of [[La Tène style]] have been found in Britain and Ireland, dating from roughly the 3rd to 1st centuries BC.  There may be a connection with an older tradition in the British Isles of elaborate gold neckwear in the form of [[gold lunula]]s, which seem centred on Ireland in the [[Bronze Age]], and later flat or curved wide collars; gold twisted ribbon torcs are found from both periods, but also imported styles such as the fused-buffer.&lt;ref&gt;Key examples of all Irish types are in both Wallace and Treasures; see previous reference for older types, the Iron Age ones are: Treasures nos. 14, 15, 21 and Wallace chapter 4, nos. 3, 4 and 10.&lt;/ref&gt;  The most elaborate late Insular torcs are thick and often hollow, some with terminals forming a ring or loop.  The most famous English example is the 1st-century&amp;nbsp;BC multi-stranded [[electrum]] [[Snettisham Torc]] found in northwestern [[Norfolk]] in England (illustrated),&lt;ref&gt;Laings, 110; Green, 48−49&lt;/ref&gt; while the single hollow torc in the [[Broighter Gold]] hoard, with relief decoration all round the hoop, is the finest example of this type from Ireland, also 1st century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Treasures, no. 21; Wallace, 138−153&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stirling Hoard]], a rare find in Scotland of four gold torcs, two of them twisted ribbons, dating from the 3rd to 1st century&amp;nbsp;BC, was discovered in September 2009.&lt;ref name="Wade"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article6901879.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=1m golden hoard rewrites history of ancient Scotland | first=Mike | last=Wade | date=2009-11-04 | accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman [[Titus Manlius Torquatus (347 BC)|Titus Manlius]] in 361&amp;nbsp;BC challenged a Gaul to single combat, killed him, and then took his torc. Because he always wore it, he received the nickname ''Torquatus'' (the one who wears a torc),&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], ''[[De Officiis]]'', III, 31&lt;/ref&gt; and it was adopted by his family.  After this, Romans adopted the torc as a decoration for distinguished soldiers and elite units during [[Roman Republic|Republican]] times.  A few Roman torcs have been discovered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancienttouch.com/172.jpg Roman Silver Torque with Two Roman Denarii Pendants (late 1st−3rd centuries AD)], on Ancient Touch Website&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Pliny the Elder]] records that after a battle in 386 BC (long before his lifetime) the Romans recovered 183 torcs from the Celtic dead, and similar booty is mentioned by other authors.&lt;ref name="Green, 77"/&gt;

It is not clear whether the [[Gallo-Roman]] "Warrior of Vacheres", a sculpture of a soldier in Roman military dress, wears a torc as part of his Roman uniform or as a reflection of his Celtic background.  [[Quintilian]] says that the [[Emperor Augustus]] was presented by [[Gauls]] with a gold torc weighing 100 [[Ancient Roman units of measurement#Weight|Roman pounds]] (nearly {{convert|33|kg|disp=or}}),&lt;ref name="Green, 77"/&gt; far too heavy to wear.  A torc from the 1st century&amp;nbsp;BC [[Winchester Hoard]], is broadly in Celtic style but uses the Roman technique of laced gold wire, suggesting it may have been a "diplomatic gift" from a Roman to a British tribal king.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article1156472.ece|title=Golden hoard of Winchester gives up its secret|author=Alberge, Dalya|date=8 September 2003|publisher=[[The Times]]|accessdate=2010-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncmd.co.uk/docs/treasurereport2000.pdf|title=Treasure Annual Report 2000|publisher=[[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]]|pages=16–18;133|year=2001|accessdate=2010-08-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301112414/http://www.ncmd.co.uk/docs/treasurereport2000.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A very late example of a torc used as ceremonial item in early Medieval Wales can be found in the writings of [[Gerald of Wales]]. The author wrote that there still existed a certain royal torc that had once been worn by Prince [[Cynog ap Brychan]] of [[Brycheiniog]] (fl. 492&amp;nbsp;AD) and was known as Saint Kynauc's Collar. Gerald encountered and described this relic first-hand while travelling through [[Wales]] in 1188. Of it he says, "it is most like to gold in weight, nature, and colour; it is in four pieces wrought round, joined together artificially, and clefted as it were in the middle, with a dog's head, the teeth standing outward; it is esteemed by the inhabitants so powerful a relic, that no man dares swear falsely when it is laid before him."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/text/chap_page.jsp;jsessionid=C38A36A0500F1F9C3F762D6E4846D204?t_id=Cambrensis_Tour&amp;c_id=4 Vision of Britain: Gerald of Wales, The Itinerary of Archbishop Baldwin through Wales, Chapter 2]&lt;/ref&gt; It is of course possible that this torc long pre-dated the reign of Prince Cynog and was a much earlier relic that had been recycled during the [[Sub-Roman Britain|British Dark Ages]] to be used as a symbol of royal authority. It is now lost.

There are mentions in medieval compilations of [[Irish mythology]]; for example in the [[Lebor Gabála Érenn]] (11th century) [[Elatha]] wore 5 golden torcs when meeting [[Eriu]].&lt;ref name="Lady Gregory"&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14465/14465-h/14465-h.htm#L5 |author=Lady Gregory |authorlink=Augusta, Lady Gregory |title=[[Gods and Fighting Men]] |origyear=1905 |year=2004 |publisher=[[Project Gutenberg]] |chapter=The Reign of Bres}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Lebor Gabála Érenn]]''. Online translation at [http://www.ancienttexts.org/library/celtic/ctexts/lebor4.html#62 www.ancienttexts.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shapes and decoration==
[[File:Torque or strié.jpg|thumb|Elegant Bronze Age torc in striated gold, northern France, c. 1200–1000 BC, 794 grams]]
Most Achaemenid torcs are thin single round bars with matching animal heads as the terminals, facing each other at the front. Some Early Celtic forms break from the normal style of torc by lacking a break at the throat, and instead are heavily decorated at the continuous front, with animal elements and short rows of "[[baluster]]s", rounded projections coming to a blunt point; these are seen both on the sculpted torc worn by the stone "[[Glauberg]] Warrior" and a gold torc (illustrated) found in the same [[oppidum]]. Later Celtic torcs nearly all return to having a break at the throat and strong emphasis on the two terminals.  The Vix torc has two very finely made winged horses standing on fancy platforms projecting sideways just before the terminals, which are flattened balls under lions' feet. Like other elite Celtic pieces in the "orientalizing" style, the decoration shows Greek influence but not a classical style, and the piece may have been made by Greeks in the Celtic taste, or a "Graeco-Etruscan workshop", or by Celts with foreign training.&lt;ref&gt;Laings, 31&lt;/ref&gt;

Spiral ribbon torcs, usually with minimal terminals, continue a Bronze Age type and are found in the [[Stirling Hoard]] from Scotland, and elsewhere:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/golden-torc-on-display-at-museum-29430511.html Example found in Northern Ireland in 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; "Although over 110 identifiable British [includes Ireland] ribbon torcs are known, the dating of these simple, flexible ornaments is elusive", perhaps indicating "a long-lived preference for ribbon torcs, which continued for over 1,000 years".&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 63&lt;/ref&gt; The terminals were often slightly flared plain round cylinders which were folded back to hook round each other to fasten the torc at the throat. Other Celtic torcs may use various ways of forming the hoop: plain or patterned round bars, two or more bars twisted together, thin round rods (or thick wire) wound round a core, or woven gold wire. A rarer type twists a single bar with an X profile.

Except in British looped terminals, the terminals of Iron Age torcs are usually formed separately. The "buffer" form of terminal was the most popular in finds from modern France and Germany, with some "fused buffer" types opening at the rear or sides.  In both buffer types and those with projecting fringes of ornament, decoration in low [[relief]] often continues back round the hoop as far as the midpoint of the side view.  In Iberian torcs thin gold bars are often wound round a core of base metal, with the rear section a single round section with a decorated surface.

The c. 150 torcs found in the lands of the [[Iberian Celts]] of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] favoured terminals ending in balls coming to a point or small buffer ("pears"), or a shape with a double moulding called ''scotiae''.&lt;ref&gt;González-Ruibal covers these in detail in the section "Torcs" and the "catalogue" following.  The ancient territory of the [[Gallaeci]] extended further east along the coast than the modern province, and the linguistic make-up of the region remains controversial.&lt;/ref&gt; The pointed ball is also found in northern Italy, where the hoops often end by being turned back upon themselves so that the terminals face out to the sides, perhaps enabling closure by hooking round. Both of these mostly used plain round bars or thin rods wound round a core.  In the terminals of British torcs loops or rings are common, and the main hoop may be two or more round bars twisted together, or several strands each made up of twisted wire. Decoration of the terminals in the finest examples is complex but all abstract. In these two types the hoop itself normally has no extra decoration, though the large torc in the Irish [[Broighter Gold]] hoard is decorated all round the hoop, the only Irish example decorated in this way.

The '''Tree of physiology''' is a Tibetan [[Thangka]] depicting [[human physiology]] and certain [[pathology|pathological]] transformations.

==Epistemology==
[[Tibetan medicine]] had developed a rather sophisticated knowledge of [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]], which was acquired from their long-standing experience with human [[dissection]]. [[Tibetans]] out of necessity, had long ago adopted the practice of ''celestial burial'' (also [[Sky burial]]) because of [[Tibet]]'s harsh terrain in most of the year and deficit of wood for [[cremation]]. This form of [[Sky burial]], still practiced, begins with a ritual [[dissection]] of the deceased, and then followed by the feeding of the parts to [[Vulture]]s on the hill tops. Both the location of the ritual dissection and the place of feeding is understood as the [[charnel ground]]. Over time, [[anatomical]] knowledge found its way into [[Ayurveda]]&lt;ref&gt;The Roots of Ayurveda (Penguin Classics) by Various and Dominik Wujastyk (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; and to an Iesser extent into [[China]]. As result, [[Tibet]] has become a home of the [[Buddhist]] medical centers Chogppori and Menchikhang (or Menhang),&lt;ref&gt;His Holiness the Dalai Lama: The Oral Biography by Deborah Hart Strober and Gerald S. Strober (2005) p.14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tao &amp; Dharma: Chinese Medicine &amp; Ayurveda by Robert Svoboda and Arnie Lade (1995) p.89&lt;/ref&gt; between the twelfth to sixteenth century A.D., where monks came to study even from foreign countries.

==Fisher donation==
Emily Fisher, a trustee at The [[American Museum of Natural History]], donated modern copies of a series of seventy-nine Tibetan [[Buddhist]] [[tangka]]s (religious paintings) that were originally commissioned in 1687 by the [[Lozang Gyatso, 5th Dalai Lama|fifth]] [[Dalai Lama]]'s regent, [[Sangye Gyamtso]] (1653-1705).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tibetan Medical Paintings: Illustrations to the Blue Beryl Treatise of Sangye Gyamtso |first1=Gyurme |last1=Dorje | author-link1=Gyurme Dorje| first2=Yuri | last2=Parfionovitch |first3=Fernand |last3=Meyer| location=London |publisher=Serindia / Harry N Abrams |date= 1992 |isbn= 0810938618}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had the paintings done to elucidate his commentary on the "Four [[Tantras]]" (Tib. ''Gyushi'')&lt;ref&gt;The Quintessence Tantras of Tibetan Medicine by Barry Clark (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; - eighth-century [[vajrayana|Tantric]] [[Buddhist]] texts that form the foundation of Tibetan medicine and cover physiology, pathology, diagnosis, and cure. With such depictions, the [[Tantric Buddhist]] system of healing&lt;ref&gt;Tibetan Book of Healing by Lobsang Rapgay (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; could, according to [[Sangye Gyamtso]], be "perceived by everybody, from the scholar to the child, as dearly as one would see a [[myrobalan]]&lt;ref&gt;Eating And Healing: Traditional Food As Medicine (Crop Science) (Crop Science) by Andrea Pieroni and Lisa Leimer Price (2006) pp.346-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tao &amp; Dharma: Chinese Medicine &amp; Ayurveda by Robert Svoboda and Arnie Lade (1995) p.90&lt;/ref&gt; (the foremost healing plant in the Tibetan tradition) held in the palm of one's hand."

==Art history==
The original set of these [[thangka]]s, which were kept in [[Lhasa]], were destroyed by the [[People's Liberation Army|Chinese military]] in 1959, but these recent copies, based on three surviving sets, were painted over the course of seven years by [[People of Nepal|Nepalese]] atelier Romio Shrestha,&lt;ref&gt;The Tibetan Art of Healing by lan Baker, Dalai Lama, Romio Shrestha, and Deepak Chopra (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; who followed religious and artistic conventions in copying the seventeenth-century originals. Shrestha's paintings on cloth, which are filled with astonishing renditions of a variety of physical conditions and illnesses, have been digitally photographed and incorporated into the Museum of Natural History, [http://anthro.amnh.org/anthro.html Division of Anthropology's] image database.

==History==
Women's Audio Mission (WAM) was founded by Terri Winston in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burgess|first=Richard James|title=The Art of Music Production: The Theory and Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p_UQH6L_n14C&amp;pg=PA195|year=2013|publisher=Oxford UP|isbn=9780199921744|page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winston, who got a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from [[Purdue University]],&lt;ref name="Christensen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spars.com/best-tracks/2012/09/spars-spotlights-womens-audio-mission-qa-with-terri-winston/|title=SPARS Spotlights Women’s Audio Mission: Q&amp;A with Terri Winston|last=Christensen|first=Paul|date=19 September 2012|publisher=Society of Professional Audio Recording Services|accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a multi-instrumentalist who had toured with P.J. Harvey, The Pixies, and The Flaming Lips. Winston had with a career in recording and engineering. Her father was an engineer and she "grew up in research labs around engineers that were always pulling pranks" on her; as a result, she said, she developed the thick skin necessary for a woman to succeed "in male-dominated careers".&lt;ref name="wimn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewimn.com/front-and-center-womens-audio-mission-founder-terri-winston/|title=Front and Center: Women's Audio Mission Founder, Terri Winston|publisher=Women's International Music Network|accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 2000s Winston was a professor at [[City College of San Francisco]], teaching recording engineering, when she founded WAM, the only all-female built and run professional recording studio in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://kalw.org/post/women-stem-terri-winston-and-women-s-audio-mission|title=Women in STEM: Terri Winston and Women’s Audio Mission|last=Chien|first=Jen|date=27 March 2014|publisher=[[KALW]]|accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a world-class facility located in downtown San Francisco, in the former SF Soundworks studio, home to projects by Alanis Morissette, Radiohead, R.E.M., and Timbaland with much of the equipment donated by various manufacturers.&lt;ref name="Christensen"/&gt;

WAM also organizes online classes; their Sound Channel program contains "animated, interactive e-textbooks that include audio examples, video demonstrations, DIY projects and quizzes" and was, according to Winston, used by 6,900 students in more than 131 countries.&lt;ref name="Christensen"/&gt;
