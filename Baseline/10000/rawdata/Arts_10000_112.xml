The '''American Architecture Awards''' &lt;ref&gt;https://chi-athenaeum.org/about-american-architecture.html&lt;/ref&gt; is a national and international awards program for new architecture, landscape architecture, interiors, and urban planning in the United States. The program was launched by the [[Chicago Athenaeum]] Museum of Architecture and Design in 1994 to honor and celebrate the most outstanding architecture designed and built or unbuilt throughout the nation or abroad in foreign countries. The Awards Program is open to all American architecture offices and international firms with projects inside the United States from the past two years. 
 
The '''American Architecture Awards''' are organized annually with The European Center for Architecture Art Design and Urban Studies.

The Awards are the Nation's highest public recognition for architectural design excellence given by a non-commercial, non-trade affiliated  public arts, culture and educational institution in the United States.

The winning projects are selects by a jury from several hundred submissions from architectural practices in the U.S. and around the world. All submitted projects are to be designed by architects in the 50 states  or abroad two years prior to the award year.
 
Recent juries for awards have been conducted in Dublin, Ireland (2007) Athens, Greece (2008); Stuttgart, Germany (2009); Istanbul, Turkey (2010); Vancouver, Canada (2011); Seoul, South Korea (2013); Athens, Greece (2014); Phoenix Arizona (2015);&lt;ref&gt;http://www.architectureanddesign.com.au/news/schools-homes-and-museums-among-60-winning-buildin&lt;/ref&gt; and Denver, Colorado (2016) in coordination with The Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland, The Turkish Camber of Architects in Istanbul, The Frank Lloyd Wright School of Architecture, The Royal Architectural Institute of Canada in Vancouver, The Federation of Institutes of Korean Architects, The Hellenic Institute of Architecture, International Biennial of Architecture Buenos Aires, The Istanbul Design Biennial, and The University of Florence.

The Awards are published each year in Global Design + Urbanism by Metropolitan Arts Press.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

'''Arcane Collective''' is a [[contemporary dance]] production company, producing and presenting work from a [[cooperative]] of international artists from different backgrounds. It was founded in 2011 by [[Morleigh Steinberg]], a dancer and [[choreographer]] and [[Oguri]], a dancer and choreographer from Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/may/17/entertainment/la-et-cm-cold-dream-colour-review-20120516 | title=Review: Striking visuals lift 'Cold Dream Colour' at REDCAT | work=Los Angeles Times | accessdate=June 5, 2013 | last=Bleiberg | first=Laura | year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their performance ''Cold Dream Colour'' was presented in 2012, as a homage to the important Irish artist [[Louis le Brocquy]], the performance being inspired by his paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lhpublicity.ie/arts-culture/cold-dream-colour/ |title=Cold Dream Colour |work=Lindsey Holmes Publicity |accessdate=June 5, 2013 |year=2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303235835/http://www.lhpublicity.ie/arts-culture/cold-dream-colour/ |archivedate=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Morleigh explained "He so often pays homage to different painters, and I thought, for his birthday we could pay homage to him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.u2.com/news/article/6337 | title=Cold Dream Colour, US Premiere | work=U2 | accessdate=7 June 2013 | year=2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The music was composed by [[Paul Chavez]] and performed by [[U2]]'s [[The Edge]] with choreography by Liz Roche&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/calendar-and-events/2013/05/12/arcane-collective-cold-dream-colour/1365 |title=Arcane Collective: Cold Dream Colour |first= |last= |work=guggenheim.org |year=2013 |accessdate=June 5, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510044312/http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/calendar-and-events/2013/05/12/arcane-collective-cold-dream-colour/1365 |archivedate=May 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Steinberg, the artistic director of the piece staged a solo dance as well as a duet with her sister Roxanne, wife of Oguri.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hotpress.com/politics/frontlines/7258734.html? |title=For A Dancer |first=Adrienne |last=Murphy |work=hotpress.com |year=2013 |accessdate=June 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Excerpts from ''Cold Dream Colour'' were performed at the [[Solomon R.

'''''Art on Paper''''' was a bi-monthly [[art magazine]] published from 1996 to 2009. The magazine's editorial scope included limited-edition prints and artists' [[book]]s, [[drawing]]s, [[photograph]]s, and [[ephemera]].

==History==
The magazine was founded in [[New York City]] in 1970 as ''The Print Collectors Newsletter''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Stephanie Murg|title=Art on Paper Folds, but Holds Out Hope for Imminent Revival|url=http://www.adweek.com/fishbowlny/art-on-paper-folds-but-holds-out-hope-for-imminent-revival/278975|accessdate=26 December 2015|work=FishbowlNY|date=22 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Paul Cummings]],&lt;ref name=artf&gt;{{cite news|title=Art on Paper Closes Print Edition After Forty Years|url=http://artforum.com/news/id=24788|accessdate=26 December 2015|work=Art Forum|date=28 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Judith Goldman as [[editor]]. Within a year, Cummings sold it to Jacqueline Brody, who continued to publish it until 1996.

From the start, the title ''The Print Collectors Newsletter,'' was a misnomer. The newsletter covered artists' prints from the [[Renaissance]] to the present, but it also published on artists' books, multiples, ephemera and photography. An issue typically included a feature story or interview, industry news, reviews of recently released prints or photographs, auction reports, and book reviews. Contributors included [[Holland Cotter]], Richard S. Field, Nancy Princenthal, Susan Tallman, [[Larry Qualls]] and others.

In 1996, Gabriella Fanning, the former editor of the art magazine ''Contemporanea,'' purchased ''The Print Collectors Newsletter''. She changed the name to ''On Paper'', converted it to a [[Magazine|journal]] format and expanded its coverage to include drawings. In 1998, she changed its title and format again, this time to a full-color glossy magazine titled ''Art on Paper''. Faye Hirsch, later Senior Editor at ''Art in America'', acted as Editor-in-Chief.

Fanning sold the title in 2004 to Darte Publishing LLC, a company established by the magazine's then editor, Peter Nesbett, and two partners. ''Art on Paper'' ceased publication in December 2009.&lt;ref name=artf/&gt; Nesbett resigned under a cloud of mystery.

''[[Art in Print]]'', the bimonthly journal on artists' prints that began publication in 2011, was founded as a not-for-profit organization and has no formal relationship to ''Art on Paper'', though many of the same writers contribute.

'''Contemporary dance in Australia''' is diverse with [[dance company|dance companies]] performing a broad range of what elsewhere may be termed [[contemporary dance|contemporary]] and [[modern dance|modern]] [[20th century concert dance|dance styles]].

Reduced funding (from the [[Government of Australia|Federal Government]] level down) has led to a reduction in the ability to sustain full-time employment to dancers, with only 5 companies in Australia that ''may'' offer a full year contract.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} All other companies work on a project basis with artists contracted for a set period of time, ranging from days to months, with no guarantee of further employment. Other funding sources include project specific funding for a dance work by example by a festival or performance venue to raise the expenses required to bring it to fruition.

==Dance film==
{{main|Dance film}}
Dance film provides one mode of contemporary dance in Australia with the [[ReelDance Festival]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reeldance.org.au/ ReelDance Festival]&lt;/ref&gt; being the main avenue, with other opportunities being through installations at venues such as night clubs, back alley's to art galleries, shown as part of a live performance, or sometimes purchased for home viewing.

==On television==
[[So You Think You Can Dance Australia]] has drawn criticism for poorly representing dance as an art form.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/news/opinion/australia-you-cant-dance-like-that/2008/03/02/1204402265772.html Valerie Lawson, (3 March 2008), "Australia, you can't dance like that", ''Brisbane Times'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[ABC1]] broadcasts contemporary dance as part of its [[Sunday Arts]] programming.

==Companies==
Australian contemporary dance companies include:
*[[Australian Dance Theatre]]
*[[Bangarra Dance Theatre]]
*[[Chunky Move]]
*[[Dancenorth]]
*[[Force Majeure (dance company)|Force Majeure]]
*[[Expressions Dance Company]]

==Development and overview==
''Auteuring Nollywood'' is a 455-page book and it contains a "collection of scholarly essays," interrogating "the thematic focus and cinematic style employed in ''The Figurine''"; it also  provides series of interviews with the key actors and technicians that featured in the film, and explores the trends in the New Nigerian Cinema.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The idea of a book adaptation of ''The Figurine'' was originally the idea of Shina Afolayan, who is a Scholar in the department of Philosophy, [[University of Ibadan]]. He gave birth to the idea when the film was still in production; after seeing a rough cut of the film, he was very impressed with what he saw that he had to interview Kunle Afolayan, along with the other cast and crew of the film at the time. The idea was not taken seriously, until film scholars in other countries also got keen on writing on the film.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; The book's content was contributed by a number of scholars from various educational institutions, including: Sola Osofisan, Dele Layiwola, Chukwuma Okoye, Jane Thorburn, Matthew H. Brown, Gideon Tanimonure, A.G.A Bello, Foluke Ogunleye and Hyginus Ekwuazi. Foreword was written by Professor Jonathan Haynes of the [[Long Island University]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; an Afterword on "Neo-Nollywood and its Other" by Onookome Okome and the book as a whole was edited by Adeshina Afolayan.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The book is packaged and published by Relentless Media, in conjunction with Golden Effects Services.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;

==Release==
''Auteuring Nollywood'' was launched on 31 July 2014 at the Agip Recital Hall of the Muson Centre, Lagos.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; The event was attended by several political and film stakeholders, including Peace Anyim-Osigwe, the former [[Chief Executive Officer|C.E.O]] of [[Africa Movie Academy Awards|Africa Film Academy]], [[Governor of Kwara State]]: Governor [[Abdulfatah Ahmed]] (represented by Prince Deji Oni), Speaker of the [[Lagos State House of Assembly]]: Honourable Adeyemi Ikuforiji, Corporate Affairs Adviser of [[Nigerian Breweries]]: Kufre Ekanem, Nigerian Guild of Editors: Mr. Femi Adeshina,&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.thecable.ng/from-screen-to-paper-heres-the-figurine | title= From screen to paper, here's 'The Figurine' | publisher=TheCable | work=The Cable News | date=1 August 2014 | accessdate=16 August 2014 | author=Okoye, Chinenye}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chairman of Doyin Group of Companies: Chief Samuel Adedoyin, and the event was chaired by Rasheed Gbadamosi, former Nigerian Minister for National Planning.

==Reception==
The book has been met with positive reception since its release. Ikechukwu Obiaya, the director of Nollywood Study Centre, [[Pan-African University]], commends the quality of the book and stated: "This is a highly impressive book. Hope it will be the first of many more to come of Kunle Afolayan's works". He also comments that the book reveals interesting perspectives into "artistic" life of the filmmaker, Kunle Afolayan.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; Nduka Otiono of [[Association of Nigerian Authors]] (ANA), and African Studies, [[Carlton University]] stated: "this book is seminal in its inauguration of a new chapter in the study of Nigeria's phenomenal contribution to global film culture," "it makes a strong case for a more in-depth artistic and critical approach to the study of Nollywood that triangulates around orality".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; [[Akin Adesokan]] of the [[Indiana University]] comments that the book is: "comprehensive and informed about its subject and in unexpected ways gives solidity to the characterization of Nollywood as 'telling our own stories'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cknnigeria.com/2014/07/kunle-afolayans-figurine-returns-in.html | title=Kunle Afolayan's Figurine Returns In Book Form…set for launch at MUSON Centre | publisher=CKN Nigeria | date=2 July 2014 | accessdate=16 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Steve Ayorinde of Relentless Media, commended that ''Auteuring Nollywood'' arrived  "at a time that the Nigerian film industry is opening up to the Academy Awards and is also being duly acknowledged as a major contributor to the Nigerian economy". He commented that the book is "championing a new and positive development in cinematic and literary studies in Nigeria by focusing exclusively on the work of a single cineaste while also expanding the narrative around a film industry that continues to announce its arrival on the global scene in a spectacular way".&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.topcelebritiesng.com/kunle-afolayans-figurine-returns-in-book-form/ | title=Kunle Afolayan's Figurine Returns In Book Form | publisher=Top Celebrities Online | work=Top Celebrities NG | accessdate=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The director of the original film, [[Kunle Afolayan]] revealed that after reading a copy of the book, he shed tears of joy, "because this is about me and my work, and because I have never read a book so detailed in its analysis". He also commented: "Releasing one's movie to scholarly interrogation like this is one of the next levels for our film industry to climb and I'm excited that this is already happening through my film".&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; Peace Anyiam-Osigwe of [[Africa Movie Academy Awards|Africa Film Academy]] comments that: "AMAA is proud to be associated with this project because it serves an important purpose,"  "It is significant to see that five years after ''The Figurine'' won [[6th Africa Movie Academy Awards|AMAA]]'s top award as [[Africa Movie Academy Award for Best Film|Best Film]], the film is still being discussed and has earned a rich collection of academic essays that are as important to the film as they are to the entire industry". Danjuma Dadu of Nigerian Film Corporation stated: "''Auteuring Nollywood'' was a welcome addition to the body of knowledge on film discourse in Nigeria and that the Film Corporation is proud to be associated with it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ogtv.com.ng/nfc-amaa-endorse-book-on-figurine/ | title=NFC, AMAA Endorse Book On Figurine | publisher=OGTV | work=Ogun State Television | date=22 July 2014 | accessdate=16 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4515">[[File:Rivington place psi.jpg|thumb|Rivington Place, home of Autograph ABP and its sister organisation [[Iniva]]]]'''Autograph ABP''' (previously known as the '''Association of Black Photographers''') is a [[United Kingdom|British]]-based international, non-profit-making, photographic arts agency.

==History==
Autograph ABP was originally established in [[London]] in 1988 by a number of photographers, including Sunil Gupta, Monika Baker, Merle Van den Bosch, [[Pratibha Parmar]], [[Ingrid Pollard]], [[Roshini Kempadoo]], [[Armet Francis]] and [[Rotimi Fani-Kayode]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://autograph-abp.co.uk/multimedia/video/autograph-sees-light-of-day "Autograph Sees Light of Day"], Autograph.&lt;/ref&gt; as the Association of Black Photographers. Through a programme of advocacy, exhibitions and publication, Autograph went on to assist in the career development of a number of black and "culturally diverse" photographers, including [[Faisal Abdu'Allah]], [[Gayle Chong Kwan]], Roshini Kempadoo and [[Yinka Shonibare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carlagirl.net/writing/rbp.html |title=Recent Black Photographers.

In 1991 [[Mark Sealy]] became the director of the organisation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africultures.com/php/?nav=personne&amp;no=14457 Mark Sealy biography], Africultures.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the board changed the name to "Autograph ABP".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intute.ac.uk/artsandhumanities/cgi-bin/fullrecord.pl?handle=artifact141 |title=Full record - Autograph ABP |publisher=Intute |date= |accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the organisation moved into its new home [[Rivington Place]], which it shares with [[Iniva]]. Renowned Cultural Studies theorist [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] served as chair on the boards of both organisations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iniva.org/library/archive/people/h/hall_stuart "Stuart Hall"], Iniva.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the honorary patrons of Autograph ABP are [[David Lammy]] MP, Professor [[Catherine Hall]], [[Lola Young]] (Baroness Young of Hornsey) OBE, and [[Henry Louis Gates, Jr]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://autograph-abp.co.uk/who-we-are/ "Who We Are"], Autograph ABP.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Boot Inn''' is at 17 Eastgate Street and 9 Eastgate Row, [[Chester]], [[Cheshire]], England.  It is recorded in the [[National Heritage List for England]] as a designated Grade&amp;nbsp;II* [[Listed building#England and Wales|listed building]].  The building consists of a shop occupying a former [[undercroft]] at street level, above which is a [[public house]] at the level of the [[Chester Rows|Row]] and above.&lt;ref name=nhl&gt;{{NHLE |num= 1376216|desc= No. 17 Street and No. 9 Row (The Boot Inn), Chester |access-date= 30 October 2011|mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
The Boot Inn was built in the early to middle part of the 17th&amp;nbsp;century, opening as an inn in 1643.  Its façade was rebuilt and restored in the late 19th&amp;nbsp;century.  For many years most of the front section of the building at Row level was occupied by a barber's shop, with a corridor leading to the public house beyond it.  Since alterations and restorations were carried out in 1988 the whole of the Row level has been occupied by a public house.&lt;ref name=lang&gt;{{Citation |editor1-last= Langtree|editor1-first= Stephen|editor2-last= Comyns|editor2-first= Alan| year = 2001| title = 2000 Years of Building: Chester's Architectural Legacy| publication-place = Chester| publisher = Chester Civic Trust| pages = | page = 87|  isbn = 0-9540152-0-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Coat of arms of the Department of Bolívar''' is the official [[Coat of arms]] of the [[Department of Bolívar]]. The Coat of arms had been in used before 1856, but in that year the [[Sovereign State of Bolívar]] was created, and its symbols changed, The new coat of arms, would be the same as the [[Coat of arms of Colombia]] but with a red oval around it, that read “ESTADO SOBERANO DE BOLIVAR”. In 1886 the states were suppressed and [[Department (country subdivision)|Departments]] created instead, the symbols were used once again but the originals were corrupted and so there are some variations on the current coat of arms, and that which was specified on the [[blazon]].

==Design and meanings==

The shield is a traditional in [[Spanish Heraldry]], is of a squared form with a small appendage in the lower middle part. It is also tierced in a party per fess, in chief per pale manner, and fimbriated in [[argent]].

It is crowned by an [[grey-bellied hawk|goshawk]] with a garland of olive, that rests upon the shield, with a scroll behind it, and is mantled in [[Or (heraldry)|Or]] on the sides.

===Divisions===
[[Image:1859-Martinique.web.jpg|right|200px]]
The first division, occupying the upper left corner, is a field of [[or (heraldry)|or]] [[charge (heraldry)|charged]] by [[coconut palm]]. The coconut palm is a distinct feature of the Caribbean. The field represents gold and the richness of the land, the palm tree symbolizes stability and love in heroic enterprises.

The second division, occupying the right upper corner, is a field of [[gules]] with five [[Solidus (coin)|Solidus coins]] in [[argent]] placed in sotuer. The [[gules]], or red, represents valor, honor, fire, and victory, and also loyalty to the crown. The coins are supposed to be in [[argent]] or silver, representing purity, faith and obedience, but instead they are now displayed in [[Or (heraldry)|Or]], or gold, probably to suppress its meaning of obedience, trying to be more independent, and less royalist.

The third division occupies the lower part of the shield. It is a field of [[azure (heraldry)|azure]] with an undulated sea, charged by a [[Barque]] in [[sable]]. The blue, or azure, is an allusion to water, and the [[Caribbean Sea]] which forms an integral element of the department, it also alludes to its hydrological diversity, as the department is bathed by many important rivers and contains many marches and lakes. The black naval ship, it’s a symbol of its maritime status, [[Cartagena de Indias|Cartagena]], its capital, was and is a very important sea port, and the black represents its role in slavery as a slave port also, however, the ship is not black anymore but it has been changed to white and brown.

===Crest and motto===
[[Image:Coat of arms of Colombia.svg|200px|thumb|Coat of arms of Colombia. Crest with no helm or mantling present, a bird with an olive crown, with a scroll in between, much like the Coat of arms of Bolívar.]]

Although very unusual in heraldry, having a [[crest (heraldry)|crest]] with no [[Helmet|helm]] or [[mantling]], it is common in the [[Andes Mountains|Andean]] Countries, as almost all of them display a [[Andean condor|condor]] with a scroll. The coat of arms of Bolívar follows this tradition and it has a [[Grey-bellied hawk|goshawk]] with its wings extended looking to the left, symbolizing power, greatness and strength, holding an olive crown, symbolizing peace. In the [[blazon]] of the coat of arms, it calls for an “Aguila azorada” meaning an eagle in pursuit, but also it hints the species, as “azor” means goshawk in [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

A scroll appears behind the bird, with the motto that reads in [[Latin]], “''Ab Ordine Libertas''”, the old motto of [[Colombia]], that is now translated into Spanish as “''Orden y Libertad''”, but which in a broader sense means, “''From Order, Comes Freedom''”.

The '''coat of arms of Copenhagen''' was granted (under its current form) on 24 June 1661&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Anders Thiset | year = 1894 | title = Om danske By- og Herredsvaaben | journal = Tidsskrift for Kunstindustri | pages = 71 | language = Danish }}&lt;/ref&gt; by king [[Frederick III of Denmark]] in appraisal of  [[Copenhagen]]'s citizen's efforts in repelling the [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[siege of Copenhagen|siege and attack]] in 1658–1659. An accompanying [[Royal charter|royal letter of privilege]] granted the citizens of Copenhagen the same rights to own fixed property as applied to the Danish [[nobility]]. 

The central feature of the full arms are three towers rising above water, a symbol also appearing in [[:Image:København segl 1296.jpg|the town's seal]] from 1296. The water element refers to the city's original name ''Havn'' meaning "Harbour" ({{lang-la|Hafnia}}). The left and right towers represent the [[Absalon's Castle|castle]] of [[Absalon]], while the central tower originally depicted a church building inside that castle.&lt;ref name=Bartholdy&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bartholdy |first1=Nils G. |editor1-first=Peter Wessel|editor1-last=Hansen |editor2-first=Leon|editor2-last=Jespersen |title=Stormen på København&amp;mdash;den svenske belejring 1658&amp;ndash;1660 |series=København.

The central tower features an oval with the king's ''F3'' cypher above the city gate, both elements in [[gold]].

The greater [[coat of arms]] features three [[Helmet (heraldry)|helmets]], banners and a wide assortment of military equipment. An oversized golden crown is shown above, but not affixed to, the central helmet. Two [[lion (heraldry)|lions]] act as [[supporter (heraldry)|supporters]] of the central [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7622">[[Fred Lerdahl]]'s '''"Cognitive Constraints on Compositional Systems"''' cites [[Pierre Boulez]]'s ''[[Le Marteau sans Maître]]'' (1955) as an example of "a huge gap between compositional system and cognized result," though he "could have illustrated just as well with works by [[Milton Babbitt]], [[Elliott Carter]], [[Luigi Nono (composer)|Luigi Nono]], [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], or [[Iannis Xenakis]]". (In [[semiology|semiological]] terms, this is a gap between the [[esthesic and poietic]] processes.) To explain this gap, and in hopes of bridging it, Lerdahl proposes the concept of a [[musical grammar]], "a limited set of rules that can generate indefinitely large sets of musical events and/or their structural descriptions." He divides this further into compositional grammar and listening grammar, the latter being one "more or less unconsciously employed by auditors, that generates mental representations of the music". He divides the former into natural and artificial compositional grammars. While the two have historically been fruitfully mixed, a natural grammar arises spontaneously in a culture while an artificial one is a conscious invention of an individual or group in a culture; the gap can arise only between listening grammar and artificial grammars. To begin to understand the listening grammar Lerdahl and [[Ray Jackendoff]] created a theory of musical cognition, ''[[Generative theory of tonal music|A Generative Theory of Tonal Music]]'' (1983; {{ISBN|0-262-62107-X}}). That theory is outlined in the essay. Lerdahl's constraints on artificial compositional grammars are:

==Constraints on event sequences==

*''Constraint 1'': The musical surface must be capable of being parsed into a sequence of discrete events.
**[counterexample: Ligeti, computer music]
*''Constraint 2'': The musical surface must be available for [[hierarchical]] structuring by the listening grammar.
**[through grouping structure, metrical structure, time-span reduction, and prolongational reduction. "Associational" factors such as [[Motif (music)|motivic]] development and [[timbre|timbral]] relations are ignored, but for "Timbral Hierarchies" see Lerdahl 1987]
*''Constraint 3'': The establishment of local grouping boundaries requires the presence of salient distinctive transitions at the musical surface.
**[counterexample: [[minimal music]]]
*''Constraint 4'': Projections of groups, especially at larger levels, depends on [[symmetry]] and on the establishment of musical [[parallelism (music)|parallelism]]s.
*''Constraint 5'': The establishment of a [[Metre (poetry)|metrical structure]] requires a degree of regularity in the placement of [[Stress (linguistics)|phenomenal accent]]s.
*''Constraint 6'': A complex time-span segmentation depends on the projection of complex grouping and metrical structures.
*''Constraint 7'': The projection of a time-span tree depends on a complex time-span segmentation in conjunction with a set of stability conditions.
*''Constraint 8'': The projection of a prolongational tree depends on a corresponding time-span tree in conjunction with a set of stability conditions.

==Constraints on underlying materials==

*''Constraint 9'': Stability conditions must operate on a fixed collection of elements.
**[usually pitches or rather fundamentals with harmonic partials]
*''Constraint 10'': [[Interval (music)|Intervals]] between elements of a collection arranged along a scale should fall within a certain range of magnitude.
*''Constraint 11'': A [[pitch (music)|pitch]] collection should recur at the [[octave]] to produce [[pitch class]]es.
**[ [[octave equivalency]] ]
*''Constraint 12'': There must be a strong [[psychoacoustic]] basis for stability conditions. For pitch collections, that requires intervals that proceed gradually from very small to comparatively large frequency [[ratio]]s.
**[ [[just intonation]] ]
*''Constraint 13'': Division of the octave into equal parts facilitates [[transposition (music)|transposition]] and reduces memory load.
**[ [[equal temperament]] ]
*''Constraint 14'': Assume pitch sets of ''n''-fold equal divisions of the octave. Then subsets that satisfy uniqueness, coherence, and simplicity will facilitate location within the overall pitch space.
**[only certain divisions of the octave, 12 and 20 included, allow uniqueness, coherence, and transpositional simplicity, and only the diatonic and pentatonic subsets of the 12-tone chromatic set follow these constraints (Balzano, 1980, 1982)]

==Pitch space==

*''Constraint 15'': Any but the most primitive stability conditions must be susceptible to multidimensional representation, where spatial distance correlates with cognitive distance.
*''Constraint 16'': Levels of pitch space must be sufficiently available from musical surfaces to be internalized.
*''Constraint 17'': A reductionally organized pitch space is needed to express the [[steps and skips]] by which cognitive distance is measured and to express degrees of melodic completeness.
**[completedness resembles implication-realization theory (Meyer, 1973 and Narmour, 1977), the ''Zug'', ''[[Urlinie]]'', and ''[[Bassbrechung]]'' (Schenker).]

He concludes, "Some of these constraints seem to me binding, others optional. Constraints 9-12 are essential for the very existence of stability conditions. Constraints 13-17, on the other hand, can be variously jettisoned." Examples given are [[Carnatic music|South Indian music]], which doesn't [[modulation (music)|modulate]] and isn't equally tempered (13 &amp; 14), and music such as that of [[Claude Debussy]], [[Béla Bartók]], and others who "have developed consonance-dissonance patterns directly from the [[total chromatic]]" (14-17).

==Comprehensibility and value==

*''Aesthetic Claim 1'': The best music utilizes the full potential of our cognitive resources.
*''Aesthetic Claim 2'': The best music arises from an alliance of a compositional grammar with the listening grammar.

To these ends he proposes the use of the terms "[[complexity]]" and "complicatedness", complexity being hierarchical structural richness, and complicatedness being "numerous non-redundant events per unit time." On Lerdahl's view complexity has aesthetic value, while complicatedness is neutral. He writes, "All sorts of music satisfy these criteria — for example, Indian [[raga]], Japanese [[Koto (musical instrument)|koto]], [[jazz]], and most Western [[art music]]. [[Rock music]] fails on grounds of insufficient complexity. Much [[contemporary music]] pursues complicatedness as compensation for a lack of complexity. In short, these criteria allow for infinite variety but only along certain lines."

"I find this conclusion both exciting and — initially at least — alarming...the constraints are tighter than I bargained for."

"My second aesthetic claim in effect rejects this ["progressivist"] attitude in favor of the older view that music-making should be based on "nature". For the ancients, nature may have resided in the music of the spheres, but for us it lies in the musical mind."

'''David Henry Friston''' (1820–1906) was a British [[illustrator]] and [[figure painter]] in the [[Victorian Era]].  He is best remembered as the creator of the first illustrations of [[Sherlock Holmes]] in 1887, as well as his illustrations of the female [[vampire]] story ''[[Carmilla]]'' (1872).  He is also remembered for his illustrations accompanying reviews of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] operas and plays of [[W. S. Gilbert]] in ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'' and the ''[[Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News]]'' in the 1870s and 1880s.

==Biography==
Friston produced illustrations and artworks from the 1850s to the late 1880s. His professional career appears to have started by 1853, when he exhibited ''Mazeppa'' at the [[Royal Academy of Art]]. Friston exhibited at the Royal Academy of Art a total of 14 times between 1853 and 1869, though he was never a member of the Academy. He also exhibited at least six examples of his work at the British Institute (between 1854 and 1867). In their critical companion to the 1858 Royal Academy of Arts exhibition, the Council of Four record the presence of Friston's work ''A Rising Artist'', in the West Room of the galleries, noting of Friston "Considerable character in the boy&lt;ref&gt;''The Royal Academy Review: A guide to the Royal Academy of Arts'', The Council of Four, 1858&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1863 Friston had started making illustrations for various books and periodicals, including ''The Churchman's Family Magazine'' (1863), ''Tinsley's Magazine'' (1867), extensively for ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'' between 1869 and 1878, ''[[The Boys' Herald]]'' and ''Dark Blue'' (1871–73).  Among his earlier published works was a [[Book frontispiece|frontispiece]] for Emma Davenport's ''Our Birthdays, and How to Improve Them'' (1864).&lt;ref&gt;Davenport, Emma Anne Georgina, with frontispiece by D. H. Friston, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FXIkHQAACAAJ&amp;dq=%22D+H+Friston%22&amp;lr=&amp;ei=Jts5Sey4N4y4yAT2_ITiCw ''Our Birthdays, and how to Improve Them''], Griffith and Farran, 1864, online at books.google.com, accessed 6 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  His illustrations for journals include many engravings accompanying reviews of the original productions of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] operas or plays of [[W. S. Gilbert]] in the 1870s, including ''[[The Princess (play)|The Princess]]'' (1870), ''[[Thespis (opera)|Thespis]]'' (1871), ''[[The Wicked World]]'' (1873), ''[[The Realm of Joy]]'' (1873), ''[[The Happy Land]]'' (1873), ''[[Sweethearts (play)|Sweethearts]]'' (1874), ''[[Tom Cobb]]'' (1875), ''[[Trial by Jury]]'' (1875), ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' (1878) and ''[[Princess Ida]]'' (1884).  For [[Orion Publishing Group|Cassell]], he illustrated an edition of [[John Bunyan]]'s ''[[Pilgrim's Progress]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Nowell-Smith, Simon, ''The House of Cassell, 1848-1958'' (Cassell, 1958), p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;  He also illustrated short stories such as the cult-classic female [[vampire]] story ''[[Carmilla]]'' (1872), ''The Three Lieutenants'' (1874) and ''The Three Commanders'' (1875) (the last two by [[William Henry Giles Kingston]]).  For Groombridge, he illustrated a volume of children's stories called ''The magnet stories for summer days and winter nights''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/magnetstoriesfor00frisiala ''The magnet stories for summer days and winter nights''], illustrations by D. H. Friston, London: Groombridge and sons&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Image:friston-holmes.gif|left|thumb|150px|Friston's Holmes, 1887]]
In 1887, Friston was chosen by Ward, Lock &amp; Co. to draw the illustrations for the first edition of [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s first [[Sherlock Holmes]] novel, ''[[A Study in Scarlet]]'', which was also the first Sherlock Holmes adventure. Friston created four pictures for the story, which were engraved by W.M.R. Quick, and published in the 1887 issue of ''[[Beeton's Christmas Annual]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Stock, Randall. [http://www.bestofsherlock.com/beetons-christmas-annual.htm "Beeton's Christmas Annual 1887: An Annotated Checklist and Census",] ''The Best of Sherlock Holmes'' website, 7 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Friston's pictures are acknowledged to be the first portraits of the Holmes character.&lt;ref&gt;Klinefelter, Walter. [http://www.bookshare.org/web/SingleTitle.html?submittitleid=30159 "Sherlock Holmes in Portrait and Profile"], Syracuse University Press (1963)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/h/holmes.htm Sherlock Homes] at the International Superheroes site&lt;/ref&gt;  The annual was issued in November at a price of one shilling and had sold out before Christmas.

''[[The Bookman (New York)|The Bookman]]'' of New York noted, in 1932, that Friston's Holmes had attracted some criticism: "For the initial appearance of a detective whose exploits were to be recorded for nearly forty years, a veteran illustrator of that day, D. H. Friston, was called upon.  This first picture of Holmes would distress the devotees.  Friston's Holmes is neither handsome nor intellectual".&lt;ref&gt;''The Bookman: A Review of Books and Life'', vol. 75, p. 354, 1932, [https://books.google.com/books?id=uQwTAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22D+H+Friston%22&amp;dq=%22D+H+Friston%22&amp;lr=&amp;ei=4d05SfriMovkywTTvbHzCw&amp;pgis=1 available online] at books.google.com, accessed 6 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Bedside, Bathtub, and Armchair Companion to Sherlock Holmes'' agreed and described his Holmes as "an outrage".  It noted of the detail of Friston's creation: "His head and hands appear small, almost feminine, his sideburns are ridiculously long, and his figure is plump, dwarfed by the oversize coat.  On his head appears a strange, rounded hat.  This Holmes looks nothing like the detective we know".&lt;ref&gt;''The Bedside, Bathtub, and Armchair Companion to Sherlock Holmes&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- What page number? --&gt;

Also in the late 1880s, Friston illustrated the work of the American [[Mary Noailles Murfree]], writing as [[Charles Egbert Craddock]].&lt;ref&gt;Notice for ''In the Clouds'' (1886) [https://books.google.com/books?id=3DcPAAAAQAAJ&amp;q=%22D+H+Friston%22&amp;dq=%22D+H+Friston%22&amp;lr=&amp;ei=x-A5ScrDKYSUzASrmbT7DA&amp;pgis=1 available online] at books.google.com, accessed 6 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''deathtrap''' is a [[literary]] and [[drama]]tic [[plot device]] in which a [[villain]] who has captured the [[hero]] or another sympathetic character attempts to use an elaborate, improbable, and usually sadistic method of [[murder]]ing them.

It is often used as a means to create dramatic tension in the story and to have the villain reveal important information to the hero, confident that the hero will shortly not be able to use it. It may also be a means to show the hero's resourcefulness in escaping, or the writer's ingenuity at devising a last-minute rescue or [[deus ex machina]].

== History ==
This plot device is generally believed to have been popularized by [[Serial film|movie serials]] and 19th-century theatrical [[melodrama]]s. A well-known example is the [[cliché]] of the moustache-twirling villain leaving the heroine tied to railroad tracks. Its use in the [[James Bond (film series)|James Bond]] film series and [[superhero]] stories is well known.

== Narrative use ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}It is a common criticism that it is unbelievable in story plots to have villains try to kill the heroes in such elaborate ways when they could use simple methods like shooting them. Through the decades, [[comic book]] writers have responded to these complaints by devising ways in which the deathtraps have served other purposes.

For instance, one ''[[Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' story by [[Jim Shooter]] had a team of Legionnaires put into a variety of deathtraps and the villains ''wanted'' the heroes to successfully escape. This was because the real purpose of the deathtraps was to have the Legionnaires use a great deal of energy doing so, which the villains then harnessed for their own benefit. Other stories have had villains use deathtraps as a means of testing the heroes or to distract them while the villain attends to other matters. On some occasions, the deathtrap is a machine that "absorbs" the energy from the hero/heroes.

Another rationalization for a deathtrap is when a particular villain simply enjoys leaving his victims some small chance of survival, just for the sake of sport. Such "sporting" villains include [[Riddler|the Riddler]], who has an uncontrollable compulsion to create intellectual challenges for his enemies. Also included in this list is the [[Jigsaw Killer]], who places his victims in life-or-death situations to prove that they appreciate life. [[Joker (comics)|The Joker]] and [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]] are other villains who simply enjoy the challenge.

On occasion, the villain may employ a slow deathtrap because they enjoy their victim's suffering prior to death, either due to sadistic tendencies or a desire for painful vengeance.

In a similar vein, the villain, often a [[megalomania]]c, may feel that, as a reflection of his own imagined greatness, it would be "beneath him" to murder his enemy like any common criminal, and that his enemy's death should be the worthy spectacle that a successful deathtrap would provide. In contrast, he may feel that his enemy, having provided him with a worthy challenge in their earlier encounters, himself "deserves" such a grandiose death, or that the enmity between the two is so "epic" that it merits no less than such a conclusion.

Conversely, the protagonists' act of falling into such a trap may itself be the reason they are written off and left unattended. The villain, disappointed in such a non-threatening opponent, loses interest, and intentionally leaves some chance of escape for the protagonists to "redeem" themselves. However, the disillusioned villain tends to assume that the chance is minuscule. Despite secretly hoping that the opponent survives and proves worthy of interest, the now-bored villain is invariably shocked when that actually occurs.

If fully serious, the villain may simply be too insane to recognize the impracticality of the situation, although this characterization is rarely seen outside of deliberately parodic characters such as [[Dr. Evil]].

A more recent reason is villains do it simply because it is considered 'tradition' or 'rule' of being a supervillain to place a hero in a deathtrap and then leave them to their fate. This even goes as far as heroes, or other villains, insulting a villain for attempting to avoid using a deathtrap or staying to watch. [[Batmen of All Nations#Club of Villains|El Sombrero]] is one villain who exemplifies this reason.

When a hero's sidekick or loved one is placed in a deathtrap, its purpose is often to distract the hero, occupying time and attention while the villain pursues their evil plan. Less frequently, the villain intends to instill grief and guilt as a means of defeating a hero that cannot be defeated physically. Multiple secondary characters may be placed in deathtraps to offer the hero an agonizing choice, ostensibly forcing the hero to save one victim and leave the other(s) to die.

== Famous examples ==
*''[[The Engineer's Thumb]]'' ([[Sherlock Holmes]] story): the  engineer Victor Hatherley is trapped inside a hydraulic press which would crush him to a pulp 
**Escape method: a woman working for the villains but not sharing their criminal ruthlessness opens a side panel at the last moment, allowing Hatherley to escape
*''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'': Sealing [[Indiana Jones]] and Marion in the Well of Souls
**Escape method: Seeing a possible tunnel entrance, Jones climbed a statue and toppled it towards the wall to create an entrance to a passageway that led to the outside.
*''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]'': Doctor Kananga and a minion tie James Bond and Solitare to a platform to be lowered into a shark infested pool to be eaten alive.
**Escape method: Without the villains seeing, Bond activates his watch's [[rotary saw]] function to cut through his restraints to free himself and attack Kananga.
*''[[Goldfinger (novel)|Goldfinger]]'': James Bond is shackled spreadeagled to a table and a [[circular saw]] (a [[laser]] in the [[Goldfinger (film)|film]]) is approaching to cut him in half. Unlike many deathtrap scenarios, Bond remains under constant supervision, and he does not use (or have) a device or outside help to escape.
**Escape method: Bond bluffs Goldfinger, and persuades him that his replacement "008" also knows about Goldfinger's plans and that Bond's death will immediately summon him to investigate, so Goldfinger elects to not take the chance of another spy coming on the scene to interfere, which he can avoid by holding Bond captive.
*[[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s "[[The Pit and the Pendulum]]": The unnamed character finds himself bound to a large slab, beneath a bladed pendulum that slowly lowers toward him as it swings, with the intention of slicing through his chest.
**Escape method: The character lures mice to the ropes with a piece of meat. They chew through the ropes, allowing him to escape before the pendulum can slice him open.
* In the ''Dudley Do-Right'' cartoon, villain Snidely Whiplash (a parody of the stereotypical "movie-serial" villain) tied up Nell Fenwick on a table-saw conveyor belt.  The narrator (Paul Frees) noted that, "Fortunately, the belt was in need of oiling, so the trip was a slow one."  In elapsed time, through the course of the story, this actually took several hours.
*The 1960s live action [[television program|television series]] ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' usually had two-part episodes use a bizarre deathtrap as a [[cliffhanger]].
**Example: [[Joker (comics)|The Joker]] traps the Dynamic Duo without their utility belts in the bottom of an industrial smokestack and begins to gradually fill it with a deadly heavier-than-air gas.
***Escape method: The pair lock elbows and brace their backs against each other to walk up the smokestack to the top opening and slide down a support cable safely to the ground.
*''[[The Venture Brothers]]'': Doctor Venture in Escape to the House of Mummies Part 2. He described the trap he was in as "Slower than haunted house spiked walls, but not quite as slow as evil scientist spiked walls."
**Escape Method: Magic forcing the walls to stop. A secondary, previously unknown Boiling Oil trap failed when a henchman confused it for "Hot [[Voile]]", which was being warmed in a clothes dryer.
*''[[The Perils of Penelope Pitstop]]'' always involved improbable deathtraps, usually set by the [[Hooded Claw]].
*Disney's ''[[The Great Mouse Detective]]'': Ratigan ties up Basil and Dawson in an intricate mousetrap and tells them about his plot to kill the queen. He then leaves to see his scheme unfold, assuming that they will soon be dead.
**Escape method: Basil activates the mousetrap he and Dawson are trapped in early, catching the ball that was meant to crush them, and setting off a chain reaction that interferes with every other aspect of the trap.
*''[[Saw (franchise)|Saw]]'': The plot of the series revolves around the Jigsaw Killer, a dying vigilante who kidnaps his victims and places them in deadly traps to test them, and give them an opportunity to repent from their former lifestyle in which they took their lives for granted, and where they were unappreciative of their life and the lives and well being of others.
*''[[The Snowman (Nesbø novel)|The Snowman]]'': Rakel, [[Harry Hole]]'s beloved, is forced to sit on a fast-melting snowman; when it had melted she would fall down and the razor-sharp wire around her neck would decapitate her.
**Escape Method: Harry arrives on the scene and extricates Rakel in nick of time, at the acceptable price of the wire cutting off one of his fingers.
*''[[Titanic (1997 film)]]'': Jack Dawson is chained in a room deep down inside the ship, where he is meant to disappear and be conveniently drowned as the ship sinks, but is rescued by his lover Rose. The entire second half of the film can also be seen as an extended deathtrap situation, where the thousands of people on board find themselves faced with a painful and absurd death, due to their having bought tickets or enlisted as crew on the glamorous ship, the epitome of technical progress and luxury, and now have to either reach the lifeboats and escape or else accept their death. The villain here, in a sense, is the ship and its careless masters.
*''[[Final Destination (franchise)|Final Destination]]'': The plot of the series revolves around several people surviving a catastrophe because one of them had a premonition of it. In doing this the survivors have cheated Death, a malevolent and unseen force that sets up deathtraps to kill off the survivors in the order in which they had originally died.


A simpler variation on the deathtrap is the '''villain speech''', also known as ''[[Monologue#Monologuing|monologuing]]''. The villain, after having captured the hero or another victim, gives a long speech taunting and sneering at his victim, pontificating on how said victim will soon die, and reminiscing over how he tried for so long to get his kill and is now about to reap the reward. Villains may also give away details of their evil plots, on the rationale that the victim will die immediately and the villain often believes their victim deserves to know. This speech, given when the villain could have just killed the victim in a matter of seconds, is invariably used to give another character time to come in and save the victim, or for the victim to escape. In ''[[The Incredibles]]'' (which used the term "monologuing"), [[Mr. Incredible]] and [[Frozone]] attacked villains in the middle of their speeches (Mr. Incredible is seen attacking [[Syndrome (The Incredibles)|Syndrome]] and Frozone is mentioned to have attacked Baron von Ruthless off-camera). In a literary sense, the villain speech is also used as a form of [[Exposition (literary technique)|exposition]].

Even in relatively realistic stories, villains will often take a moment to say something pithy before finishing off the victim. The antagonist would often leave the victim to die whilst they commit their evil scheme. This is echoed in the film ''[[2001 - A Space Odyssey]]'' when Hal the supercomputer, confident that Dave will soon perish outside the ship, tells him that he is about to take control of the expedition and then sees Dave off with the flat remark: "This conversation can have no meaningful purpose anymore - goodbye!". Dave manages to make his way inside and kill Hal.

== Spoofs ==
The concept of the deathtrap/monologue is featured in many [[satire]]s.

* Deathtraps were spoofed heavily in the [[Austin Powers (film series)|Austin Powers]] movies, including a replication of [[James Bond]]'s Shark Infested Water deathtrap. It is first introduced as "an easily escapeable situation involving an overly elaborate and exotic death" with Austin placed on a platform over a pool (which [[Dr. Evil]] calls "the unnecessarily slow-moving dipping mechanism"). The trap is escaped by swinging on a grapple of dental floss. As the intended sharks with laserbeams  were unavailable due to the complexities of international law regarding endangered species (much to Dr. Evil's disappointment), ill-tempered [[mutant]] seabass are used instead. As part of the spoof, [[Scott Evil]], Dr. Evil's son, insists that the deathtrap is pointless and that they could simply shoot them with a pistol, which is nearby, and yells at his father for the further incompetence of leaving them alone. Dr Evil responds that not watching the killing but assuming it went well makes perfect sense.
* In the [[sitcom]] ''[[Blackadder]]'', [[Prince Edmund (Blackadder)|Prince Edmund]] is captured by his nemesis, the Hawk, who straps him into a chair which, in sixty seconds, will mutilate him in a variety of ways. Edmund's friends, [[Baldrick]] and [[Lord Percy Percy|Percy]], manage to poison the Hawk and his followers, but while celebrating this unlikely victory, the time runs out, and Edmund suffers a terrible fate. In another episode, Lord Flashheart is confronted by a villain who begins an evil villain speech. However, rather than waiting for him to finish, Flashheart merely shoots him without warning.
* ''[[Curse of Monkey Island]]'' makes fun of this cliché. The villain [[LeChuck]], after capturing [[Guybrush Threepwood]], ''insists'' on telling him his plans before executing him. By this dialogue, interesting background story that connect the games together are given to the player. Guybrush does him the favour to listen, but after a while he is so bored that he refuses to listen any more, even if LeChuck pleads to continue.
* The famous line from ''[[Watchmen]]'' wherein the character Ozymandias takes his time and explains in detail how he will set his plan irrevocably in motion and then, in a deliberate skewering of the monologuing tendencies of supervillains, explains that "[[Nite Owl|Dan]], I'm not a [[Republic Pictures|Republic serial]] villain. I did it thirty-five minutes ago."
* In ''The Simpsons'' episode "[[You Only Move Twice]]", which generally spoofs Bond villain clichés, supervillain/great boss [[Hank Scorpio]] has "Mr. Bont" strapped to a table with a laser à la Goldfinger. Bont manages to escape, only to be tackled by Homer. Scorpio's henchmen promptly shoot Bont.
*Some incarnations of the [[Evil Overlord List]] point out the impracticality of deathtraps. Some examples include making sure the deathtrap has a VERY small estimated time of death or such lines as "Shooting is NOT too good for my enemies."
* Season 5 Episode 8 of the animated classic series ''[[The Flintstones]]'' entitled "[[List of The Flintstones episodes|Dr. Sinister]]" spoofed the James Bond series ("James Bondrock") and featured, among other deathtraps, [[Fred Flintstone|Fred]] and [[Barney Rubble|Barney]] being tied to a slab with a slowly descending pendulum with blade, a la Poe's "[[The Pit and the Pendulum]]". The duo escape when Barney holds his tied hands up and the blade slices through his bonds. He then unties himself and frees Fred before the final swing slices the slab in half.

}}

'''Faxlore''' is a sort of [[folklore]]: [[humor]]ous texts, [[folk poetry]], [[folk art]], and  [[urban legend]]s that are circulated, not by word of mouth, but by [[fax machine]].  '''Xeroxlore''' or '''photocopylore''' is similar material circulated by [[photocopying]]; compare [[samizdat]] in [[Soviet-bloc]] countries.

The first use of the term '''xeroxlore''' was in [[Michael J. Preston (professor of English)|Michael J. Preston]]'s essay ''Xerox-lore'', 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
| last         = Preston

| doi          = 
| accessdate   = 2013-11-23
}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Photocopylore" is perhaps the most frequently encountered name for the phenomenon now, because of [[trademark]] concerns involving the [[Xerox]] Corporation.  The first use of this term came in ''A Dictionary of English Folklore'' by [[Jacqueline Simpson]] and [[Steve Roud]].&lt;ref&gt;(Oxford University Press: 2000; {{ISBN|0-19-860766-0}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Material circulated in faxlore==
Some faxlore is relatively harmless.  [[Cartoon]]s and [[joke]]s often circulate as faxlore, the poor graphic quality becoming worse with each new person who resends the joke to the next recipient. Because faxlore and xeroxlore is the (mis)appropriation of [[technology]] owned by the employer, much [[humour|humorous]] faxlore is mildly subversive of the workplace and its values.  Like [[email]] and [[chain letters]], office technology has given new life to various forms of practical jokes, [[urban legends]], and folklore.  The items are often office-related, such as spoof agenda for meetings, spurious descriptions of ridiculous training programs that all staff will allegedly be required to attend, and so on.  Names may be whited out and replaced with someone in the office, making it a joke on a particular person, or details may be altered making an item more topical.&lt;ref&gt;Michael, 1995; Dundes, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

The semi-traditional lists of reasons "why a cucumber is better than a man" or "why a beer is better than a woman" often circulate as faxlore, as has the well known [[mock German]] variations of the "[[Blinkenlights]]" poster.  Another commonly circulated text contains [[ethnic humor]]; a typical version goes:

:Heaven is where the police are British, the lovers French, the mechanics German, the chefs Italian, and it is all organized by the Swiss.

:Hell is where the police are German, the lovers Swiss, the mechanics French, the chefs British, and it is all organized by the Italians.

Materials of this sort have existed from the beginnings of duplicating technologies.  [[World War II]] era [[blueprint]]s exist of drawings of female nudes with their body parts labeled as if they were the parts of airplanes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} With the widespread adoption of photocopying, amateur duplication of this sort of material became available to a much larger social base.  Cartoons and other amateur materials were distributed in the workplace, usually in violation of [[business management|managerial]] restrictions on the use of office supplies, and often in disregard of [[copyright]] law.&lt;ref name="Preston, 1996"&gt;Preston, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, during the early 1990s, the widespread adoption of telecopiers made it possible to duplicate these materials remotely.  The use of a fax machine  to duplicate these materials also changed the emphases of their subjects; various alarms and urban legends were propagated to distant readers over the telephone lines.  This use of fax has been somewhat supplanted by [[email]] as that technology became more widely used and embedded in the culture; the sort of urban legends that once circulated by fax are now likely to appear as [[email hoax]]es.  Specific computer related alarms are the subject of [[virus hoax]]es; email makes forwarding of texts relatively easy, and the frightening nature of the revelation makes it seem important to pass along, despite any doubts the sender might have.&lt;ref name="Preston, 1996"/&gt;

==Faxlore and urban legends==
[[File:Mickey mouse acid warning.png|thumb|An early example of a distributed warning about tattoo stickers allegedly laced with drugs, collected by [[Jan Brunvand]] in his book ''The Choking Doberman'']]
Other sorts of faxlore have had more serious consequences.  A number of more notorious urban legends have circulated in faxlore. The notorious "[[Blue star tattoo legend|Blue Star]] [[LSD|Acid]]" [[hoax]] is one well known example.

The "lights out" hoax, which claimed that people who were driving in the dark with their headlights out might be gang members, and that those who flashed their headlights at these drivers might be marked for [[murder]] as part of a [[gang]] initiation, was another hoax that was widely circulated as faxlore.&lt;ref&gt;Bunch, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;  The poor graphic quality of the frequently re-sent faxes, which often were made out to appear to have originated with the police department of a distant [[city]], only made these hoaxes seem more credible.&lt;ref&gt;Brunvand, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal aspects==
In the [[United States]], collections of supposedly sinister symbols have been circulated among [[school]] administrators and [[police department]]s; in the 1980s these symbols were frequently alleged to be "[[Satanism|Satanic]] symbols", and in the 1990s they were alleged to be "gang symbols".  [[politics|Political]] or [[religion|religious]] symbols, like the [[peace symbol]], the [[Star of David]], the [[Rosary]], the [[ankh]], or the [[pentagram]] were mingled with other cryptic or fanciful symbols in these faxed and recirculated sheets, and the entire collection was condemned.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

On the authority of these anonymous, hard to trace, and impossible to [[cross-examination|cross-examine]] sources, school administrators sometimes acted to ban the wearing of Stars of David and similar symbols of minority religions.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}  Typically, no compiler or author is given for the collection of symbols, though frightening descriptions are often given about their "secret meaning."  A number of [[civil liberties]] [[lawsuit]]s were filed over actions taken by school administrators who took these anonymous sources seriously.&lt;ref&gt;''Chalifoux'', 1997; ''Jeglin'', 1993; ''Jewish News Weekly'', 1999; ''Free Republic'', 2005; Bunch, 1993; Roberts et al., 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar claim that the [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] logo was a "[[Satanism|satanic symbol]]" was linked in the 1980s to the activity of several [[Amway]] distributors, Amway being one of Procter &amp; Gamble's competitors; the hoax was spread by fax, photocopier, and later by [[voice mail]] and email.&lt;ref&gt;Emery, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Another occasional hoax claims that clothing and memorabilia of various [[university|universities]] or [[sports]] teams are "gang symbols".&lt;ref&gt;''Jeglin'', 1993; Roberts et al., 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

== Growing obsolescence ==
With the rise of the [[Internet]], media such as [[World Wide Web]], [[email]], [[instant messaging]], and [[social networking sites]] are now available to quickly and widely spread the sort of material that formerly circulated as faxlore. The hoax warnings of things such as dire and terrible [[computer virus]]es that still occasionally circulate, carry on one tradition of the bogus [[cautionary tale]] that used to circulate as faxlore.

{{Culture of India}}
'''Indian painting''' has a very long tradition and history in [[Indian art]]. The earliest Indian paintings were the rock paintings of [[pre-historic]] times, the [[petroglyph]]s as found in places like [[Bhimbetka rock shelters]], some of the Stone Age [[Cave painting|rock paintings]] found among the Bhimbetka rock shelters are approximately 30,000 years old.&lt;ref name="klostermaier1989"&gt;{{Citation | title=A survey of Hinduism | author=Klaus K. Klostermaier | authorlink = Klaus Klostermaier | year=1989 | isbn=0-88706-807-3 | publisher=SUNY Press | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ltn3OuF_i4sC | quote=''... prehistoric cave paintings at Bhimbetka (ca. 30000 BCE) ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt; India's [[Buddhist]] literature is replete with examples of texts which describe palaces of the army and the aristocratic class embellished with paintings, but the paintings of the [[Ajanta Caves]] are the most significant of the few survivals. Smaller scale painting in manuscripts was probably also practised in this period, though the earliest survivals are from the medieval period. [[Mughal painting]] represented a fusion of the [[Persian miniature]] with older Indian traditions, and from the 17th century its style was diffused across Indian princely courts of all religions, each developing a local style. [[Company painting]]s were made for British clients under the [[British raj]], which from the 19th century also introduced [[art school]]s along Western lines, leading to modern Indian painting, which is increasingly returning to its Indian roots.

Indian paintings provide an aesthetic continuum that extends from the early civilisation to the present day. From being essentially religious in purpose in the beginning, Indian painting has evolved over the years to become a fusion of various cultures and traditions.

==Shadanga of Indian painting==
Around the 1st century BC the ''Shadanga'' or Six Limbs of Indian Painting, were evolved, a series of canons laying down the main principles of the art.&lt;ref name="Coomaraswamy2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Coomaraswamy|first=Ananda K.|title=History of Indian and Indonesian Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_JPmp2aAQdcC&amp;pg=PA88|accessdate=11 December 2011|year=2003|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|isbn=978-0-7661-5801-6|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vatsyayana, who lived during the third century A.D., enumerates these in his [[Kamasutra]] having extracted them from still more ancient works.

These 'Six Limbs' have been translated as follows:&lt;ref name="Coomaraswamy2003"/&gt;

# ''Rupabheda'' The knowledge of appearances.
# ''Pramanam'' Correct perception, measure and structure.
# ''Bhava'' Action of feelings on forms.
# ''Lavanya Yojanam'' Infusion of grace, artistic representation.
# ''Sadrisyam'' Similitude.
# ''Varnikabhanga'' Artistic manner of using the brush and colours. (Tagore.)

The subsequent development of painting by the Buddhists indicates that these ' Six Limbs ' were put into practice by Indian artists, and are the basic principles on which their art was founded.

==Genres of Indian painting==
[[File:oldpaint file.jpg|thumb|Painting of Mysore style during Tippu Sultan period]]

Indian paintings can be broadly classified as murals and miniatures. Murals are large works executed on the walls of solid structures, as in the [[Ajanta Caves]] and the Kailashnath temple. [[Miniature art|Miniature painting]]s are executed on a very small scale for books or albums on perishable material such as paper and cloth. The Palas of [[Bengal]] were the pioneers of miniature painting in India. The art of miniature painting reached its glory during the Mughal period. The tradition of miniature paintings was carried forward by the painters of different Rajasthani schools of painting like the Bundi, Kishangarh, Jaipur, Marwar and Mewar. The Ragamala paintings also belong to this

school, as does the [[Company painting]] produced for British clients under the [[British Raj]].

Ancient Indian art has seen the rise of the Bengal School of art in 1930s followed by many forms of experimentations in European and Indian styles. In the aftermath of India's independence, many new genres of art developed by important artists like Jamini Roy, [[M. F. Husain]], [[Francis Newton Souza]], and [[Vasudeo S. Gaitonde]]. With the progress of the economy the forms and styles of art also underwent many changes. In the 1990s, Indian economy was liberalised and integrated to the world economy leading to the free flow of cultural information within and without.  Artists include [[Subodh Gupta]], [[Atul Dodiya]], [[Devajyoti Ray]], [[Bose Krishnamachari]] and Jitish Kahllat whose works went for auction in international markets.  Bharti Dayal has chosen to handle the traditional [[Madhubani art|Mithila painting]] in most contemporary way and created her own style through the exercises of her own imagination, they appear fresh and unusual.

== History of Indian painting ==

===Murals===
[[File:Meister des Mahâjanaka Jâtaka 001.jpg|thumb|A mural painting depicting a scene from [[Jataka tales|Mahajanaka Jataka]], Cave 1, [[Ajanta caves|Ajanta]]]]
The [[Cave paintings in India|history of Indian murals]] starts in ancient and early medieval times, from the 2nd century BC to 8th – 10th century AD. There are known more than 20 locations around India containing murals from this period, mainly natural caves and rock-cut chambers. The highest achievements of this time are the caves of [[Ajanta caves|Ajanta]], [[Bagh Caves|Bagh]], [[Sittanavasal]], [[Armamalai Cave]] (Tamil Nadu), [[Ravan Chhaya rock shelter]], Kailasanatha temple in [[Ellora Caves]].

Murals from this period depict mainly religious themes of Buddhist, Jain and Hindu religions. There are though also locations where paintings were made to adorn mundane premises, like the ancient theatre room in Jogimara Cave and possible royal hunting lodge circa 7th-century AD – Ravan Chhaya rock shelter.

The pattern of large scale wall painting which had dominated the scene, witnessed the advent of miniature paintings during the 11th and 12th centuries. This new style figured first in the form of illustrations etched on palm-leaf manuscripts. The contents of these manuscripts included literature on Buddhism and Jainism. In eastern India, the principal centres of artistic and intellectual activities of the Buddhist religion were Nalanda, Odantapuri, Vikramshila and Somarpura situated in the Pala kingdom (Bengal and Bihar).

===Eastern India painting===
In eastern India miniature painting developed in the 10th century. These miniatures, depicting Buddhist divinities and scenes from the life of Buddha were painted on the leaves (about 2.25 by 3&amp;nbsp;inches) of the palm-leaf manuscripts as well as their wooden covers. Most common Buddhist illustrated manuscripts include the texts ''[[Perfection of Wisdom|Astasahasrika Prajnaparamita]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Coomaraswamy, Ananda K. (1999). ''Introduction to Indian Art'',: Munshiram Manoharlal, {{ISBN|81-215-0389-2}} p.68-70&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pancharaksa'', ''Karandavyuha'' and ''Kalachakra Tantra''. The earliest extant miniatures are found in a manuscript of the ''Astasahasrika Prajnaparamita'' dated in the sixth regnal year of [[Mahipala]] (c. 993), presently the possession of [[The Asiatic Society]], Kolkata. This style disappeared from India in the late 12th century.

==== Influences in foreign arts ====
The influence of eastern Indian paintings can be seen in various Buddhist temples in [[Bagan]], [[Myanmar]] particularly [[Abeyadana temple]] which was named after Queen consort of Myanmar, [[Apeyadana|Abeyadana]] who herself had Indian roots and [[Gubyaukgyi Temple (Myinkaba)|Gubyaukgyi Temple]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=The significance of North East India in the development of the sculpture of Bagan|url=https://www.soas.ac.uk/saaap/news/file124891.pdf|journal=University of London|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influences of eastern Indian paintings can also be clearly observed in [[Thangka|Tibetan Thangka]] paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.my/books?id=lTN6hDziKC0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=tibet+painting&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjE47e6--fcAhUPXSsKHc0YBtIQ6AEIRDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=india&amp;f=false|title=Sacred Visions: Early Paintings from Central Tibet|last=Kossak|first=Steven|last2=Singer|first2=Jane Casey|last3=Bruce-Gardner|first3=Robert|last4=N.Y.)|first4=Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York|date=1998|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|isbn=9780870998621|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Western Indian Miniature Painting ===
Miniature paintings are beautiful handmade paintings, which are quite colorful but small in size. The highlight of these paintings is the intricate and delicate brushwork, which lends them a unique identity. The colors are handmade, from minerals, vegetables, precious stones, indigo, conch shells, pure gold and silver. The evolution of Indian Miniatures paintings started in the Western Himalayas, around the 17th century

===Malwa, Deccan and Jaunpur schools of painting===
A new trend in manuscript illustration was set by a manuscript of the ''Nimatnama'' painted at Mandu, during the reign of Nasir Shah (1500–1510). This represent a synthesis of the indigenous and the patronized Persian style, though it was the latter which dominated the Mandu manuscripts.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} There was another style of painting known as Lodi Khuladar that flourished in the Sultanate's dominion of North India extending from Delhi to Jaunpur.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

===Mughal painting===
{{main article|Mughal painting}}
[[File:Meister des Rasikapriyâ-Manuskripts 001.jpg|thumb|A 17th-century [[Mughal painting]]]]
[[Mughal painting]] is a particular style of Indian painting, generally confined to illustrations on the book and done in miniatures, and which emerged, developed and took shape during the period of the [[Mughal Empire]] between the 16th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://artsandculture.google.com/exhibit/XQIC2ZXP7c1MLg|title=Indian Miniature Paintings: The Mughal and Persian Schools - Google Arts &amp; Culture|work=Google Cultural Institute|access-date=2018-11-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mughal paintings were a unique blend of Indian, Persian and Islamic styles. Because the Mughal kings wanted visual records of their deeds as hunters and conquerors, their artists accompanied them on military expeditions or missions of state, or recorded their prowess as animal slayers, or depicted them in the great dynastic ceremonies of marriages.

Akbar's reign (1556–1605) ushered a new era in Indian miniature painting. After he had consolidated his political power, he built a new capital at Fatehpur Sikri where he collected artists from India and Persia. He was the first monarch who established in India an atelier under the supervision of two Persian master artists, Mir Sayyed Ali and [[Khwaja Abdus Samad|Abdus Samad]]. Earlier, both of them had served under the patronage of Humayun in Kabul and accompanied him to India when he regained his throne in 1555. More than a hundred painters were employed, most of whom were Hindus from Gujarat, Gwalior and Kashmir, who gave a birth to a new school of painting, popularly known as the Mughal School of miniature Paintings.

[[File:Meister der Hamza-Nâma-Handschrift 001.jpg|thumb|left|A folio from the [[Hamzanama]]]]
One of the first productions of that school of miniature painting was the [[Hamzanama]] series, which according to the court historian, Badayuni, was started in 1567 and completed in 1582. The [[Hamzanama]], stories of Amir Hamza, an uncle of the Prophet, were illustrated by [[Mir Sayyid Ali]]. The paintings of the Hamzanama are of large size, 20 x 27" and were painted on cloth. They are in the Persian safavi style. Brilliant red, blue and green colours predominate; the pink, eroded rocks and the vegetation, planes and blossoming plum and peach trees are reminiscent of Persia. However, Indian tones appear in later work, when Indian artists were employed.

After him, [[Jahangir]] encouraged artists to paint portraits and durbar scenes. His most talented portrait painters were [[Ustad Mansur]], Abul Hasan and [[Bishandas]].

[[Shah Jahan]] (1627–1658) continued the patronage of painting. Some of the famous artists of the period were Mohammad Faqirullah Khan, Mir Hashim, Muhammad Nadir, [[Bichitr]], Chitarman, Anupchhatar, Manohar and Honhar.

Aurangzeb had no taste for fine arts. Due to lack of patronage artists migrated to Hyderabad in the Deccan and to the Hindu states of Rajasthan in search of new patrons.

===Rajput painting===
{{main article|Rajput painting}}
[[File:Nihâl Chand 001.jpg|thumb|An 18th-century [[Rajput painting]] by the artist [[Nihâl Chand]]]]
Rajput painting, a style of Indian painting, evolved and flourished, during the 18th century, in the royal courts of [[Rajputana]], India. Each Rajput kingdom evolved a distinct style, but with certain common features. Rajput paintings depict a number of themes, events of epics like the [[Ramayana]] and the [[Mahabharata]], Krishna's life, beautiful landscapes, and humans. Miniatures were the preferred medium of Rajput painting, but several manuscripts also contain Rajput paintings, and paintings were even done on the walls of palaces, inner chambers of the forts, havelies, particularly, the [[haveli]]s of [[Shekhawati]].

The colours extracted from certain minerals, plant sources, conch shells, and were even derived by processing precious stones, gold and silver were used. The preparation of desired colours was a lengthy process, sometimes taking weeks. Brushes used were very fine.

===Mysore painting===
{{main article|Mysore painting}}

Mysore painting is an important form of classical [[South India]]n painting that originated in the town of [[Mysore]] in Karnataka. These paintings are known for their elegance, muted colours and attention to detail. The themes for most of these paintings are [[Hindu]] Gods and Goddesses and scenes from [[Hindu mythology]]. In modern times, these paintings have become a much sought-after souvenir during festive occasions in South India.

The process of making a Mysore painting involves many stages. The first stage involves the making of the preliminary sketch of the image on the base. The base consists of cartridge paper pasted on a wooden base. A paste made of [[zinc oxide]] and [[arabic gum]] is made called "gesso paste". With the help of a thin brush all the jewellery and parts of throne or the arch which have some relief are painted over to give a slightly raised effect of carving. This is allowed to dry. On this thin gold foil is pasted. The rest of the drawing is then painted using watercolours. Only muted colours are used.

===Tanjore painting===
{{main article|Tanjore painting}}
[[File:Sikh Gurus with Bhai Bala and Bhai Mardana.jpg|thumb|right|Tanjore style painting depicting the ten [[Sikh Gurus]] with [[Bhai Bala]] and [[Bhai Mardana]].]]
Tanjore painting is an important form of classical [[South India]]n painting native to the town of [[Tanjore]] in Tamil Nadu. The art form dates back to the early 9th century, a period dominated by the [[Chola]] rulers, who encouraged art and literature. These paintings are known for their elegance, rich colours, and attention to detail. The themes for most of these paintings are [[Hindu]] Gods and Goddesses and scenes from [[Hindu mythology]]. In modern times, these paintings have become a much sought-after souvenir during festive occasions in South India.

The process of making a Tanjore painting involves many stages. The first stage involves the making of the preliminary sketch of the image on the base. The base consists of a cloth pasted over a wooden base. Then chalk powder or [[zinc oxide]] is mixed with water-soluble [[adhesive]] and apply it on the base. To make the base smoother, a mild [[abrasive]] is sometimes used. After the drawing is made, decoration of the jewelry and the apparels in the image is done with semi-precious stones. Laces or threads are also used to decorate the jewelry. On top of this, the gold foils are pasted. Finally, [[dyes]] are used to add colours to the figures in the paintings.

===Kangra painting===

The Bengal Patachitra refers to the painting of [[West Bengal]]. It is a traditional and mythological heritage of [[West Bengal]]. The Bengal Patachitra is divided into some different aspects like '''''Durga Pat''''', ''[[Chalchitra]]'', ''Tribal Patachitra'', ''Medinipur Patachitra'', [[Kalighat painting|Kalighat Patachitra]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.anandabazar.com/district/nadia-murshidabad/portrait-art-s-demand-at-nabadwip-1.700221|title=পটচিত্রের চাহিদা বাড়ছে নবদ্বীপের রাসে|last=বন্দ্যোপাধ্যায়|first=দেবাশিস|work=anandabazar.com|access-date=2018-05-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subject matter of Bengal Patachitra is mostly mythological, religious stories, folk lore and social. The Kalighat Patachitra, the last tradition of Bengal Patachitra is developed by [[Jamini Roy]]. The artist of the Bengal Patachitra is called [[Patua]].&lt;ref&gt;Giusti, M. and Chakraborty, U. (ed.). ''Immagini Storie Parole. Dialoghi di formazione coi dipinti cantati delle donne Chitrakar del West Bengal''. Mantova: Universitas Studiorum, 2014, {{ISBN|978-88-97683-39-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Westindischer Maler um 1550 001.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gita Govinda]] depicted in Pattachitra]]
The tradition of Orisha Pattachitra is closely linked with the worship of Lord [[Jagannath]]. Apart from the fragmentary evidence of paintings on the caves of [[Khandagiri]] and [[Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves|Udayagiri]] and Sitabhinji murals of the Sixth century A.D., the earliest indigenous paintings from Odisha are the Pattachitra done by the Chitrakars (the painters are called Chitrakars).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pattachitra.com/pattachitra.htm|title=HugeDomains.com - Pattachitra.com is for sale (Pattachitra)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theme of Oriya painting centres round the [[Vaishnava]] sect. Since beginning of Pattachitra culture Lord Jagannath who was an incarnation of Lord Krishna was the major source of inspiration. The subject matter of Patta Chitra is mostly mythological, religious stories and folk lore. Themes are chiefly on Lord Jagannath and [[Radha]]-[[Krishna]], different "Vesas" of [[Jagannath]], [[Balabhadra]] and [[Subhadra]], temple activities, the ten [[incarnation]]s of [[Vishnu]] basing on the '[[Gita Govinda]]' of [[Jayadeva|Jayadev]], Kama Kujara Naba Gunjara, [[Ramayana]], [[Mahabharata]]. The individual paintings of gods and goddesses are also being painted.The painters use vegetable and mineral colours without going for factory made poster colours. They prepare their own colours. White colour is made from the [[conch]]-shells by powdering, boiling and filtering in a very hazardous process. It requires a lot of patience. But this process gives brilliance and premanence to the [[hue]]. 'Hingula', a mineral colour, is used for red. 'Haritala', king of stone ingredients for yellow, 'Ramaraja' a sort of indigo for blue are being used. Pure [[lamp-black]] or black prepared from the burning of cocoanut shells are used.The brushes that are used by these 'Chitrakaras' are also indigenous and are made of hair of domestic animals. A bunch of hair tied to the end of a bamboo stick make the brush. It is really a matter of wonder as to how these painters bring out lines of such precision and finish with the help of these crude brushes. That old tradition of Oriya painting still survives to-day in the skilled hands of Chitrakaras (traditional painters) in [[Puri]], [[Raghurajpur]], [[Paralakhemundi]], Chikiti and [[Sonepur, Odisha|Sonepur]].

===Bengal school===
{{main article|Bengal school of art}}
[[File:Bharat Mata.jpg|thumb|''Bharat Mata'' by [[Abanindranath Tagore]] (1871–1951), a nephew of the poet [[Rabindranath Tagore]], and a pioneer of the movement]]
The [[Bengal School of Art]] was an influential style of art that flourished in India during the [[British Raj]] in the early 20th century. It was associated with Indian nationalism, but was also promoted and supported by many British arts administrators.

The Bengal school arose as an [[avant garde]] and nationalist movement reacting against the [[academic art]] styles previously promoted in India, both by Indian artists such as [[Raja Ravi Varma|Ravi Varma]] and in British art schools. Following the widespread influence of Indian spiritual ideas in the West, the British art teacher [[Ernest Binfield Havel]] attempted to reform the teaching methods at the [[Calcutta School of Art]] by encouraging students to imitate [[Mughal painting|Mughal]] miniatures. This caused immense controversy, leading to a strike by students and complaints from the local press, including from nationalists who considered it to be a retrogressive move. Havel was supported by the artist [[Abanindranath Tagore]], a nephew of the poet [[Rabindranath Tagore]]. Tagore painted a number of works influenced by Mughal art, a style that he and Havel believed to be expressive of India's distinct spiritual qualities, as opposed to the "materialism" of the West. Abanindranath Tagore's best-known painting, ''Bharat Mata'' (Mother India), depicted a young woman, portrayed with four arms in the manner of Hindu deities, holding objects symbolic of India's national aspirations. Tagore later attempted to develop links with Far-Eastern artists as part of an aspiration to construct a [[pan-Asianism|pan-Asianist]] model of art.  Those associated with this Indo-FarEastern model included [[Nandalal Bose]], [[Mukul Dey]], [[Kalipada Ghoshal]], [[Benode Behari Mukherjee]], Vinayak Shivaram Masoji, [[B.C. Sanyal]], [[Beohar Rammanohar Sinha]], and subsequently their students [[A. Ramachandran]], Tan Yuan Chameli, Ramananda Bandopadhyay and a few others.

[[File:Bengal Women Manishi Dey.jpg|thumb|Bengal Women, painted around 1950 by Manishi Dey]]
The Bengal school's influence on Indian art scene gradually started alleviating with the spread of [[modernist]] ideas post-independence.[[K. G. Subramanyan]]'s role in this movement is significant.

===Contextual Modernism===
{{main article|Santiniketan: The Making of a Contextual Modernism}}
The term [[Contextual Modernism]] that Siva Kumar used in the catalogue of the exhibition has emerged as a [[postcolonial]] critical tool in the understanding of the art the Santiniketan artists had practised.

Several terms including [[Paul Gilroy]]’s ''counter culture of modernity'' and [[Tani Barlow]]'s ''Colonial modernity'' have been used to describe the kind of alternative modernity that emerged in non-European contexts. Professor Gall argues that ‘Contextual Modernism’ is a more suited term because “the colonial in ''colonial modernity'' does not accommodate the refusal of many in colonised situations to internalise inferiority. Santiniketan’s artist teachers’ refusal of subordination incorporated a counter vision of modernity, which sought to correct the racial and cultural essentialism that drove and characterised imperial Western modernity and modernism. Those European modernities, projected through a triumphant British colonial power, provoked nationalist responses, equally problematic when they incorporated similar essentialisms.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huichawaii.org/assets/gall,-david---overcoming-polarized-modernities.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[R. Siva Kumar]] "The Santiniketan artists were one of the first who consciously challenged this idea of modernism by opting out of both internationalist modernism and historicist indigenousness and tried to create a context sensitive modernism."&lt;ref name="humanitiesunderground.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humanitiesunderground.org/all-the-shared-experiences-of-the-lived-world-ii/|title=humanities underground » All The Shared Experiences Of The Lived World II|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had been studying the work of the Santiniketan masters and thinking about their approach to art since the early 80s. The practice of subsuming [[Nandalal Bose]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Ram Kinker Baij]] and [[Benode Behari Mukherjee]] under the [[Bengal School of Art]] was, according to Siva Kumar, misleading. ''This happened because early writers were guided by genealogies of apprenticeship rather than their styles, worldviews, and perspectives on art practice''.&lt;ref name="humanitiesunderground.org"/&gt;

The literary critic [[Ranjit Hoskote]] while reviewing the works of contemporary artist [[Atul Dodiya]] writes, "The exposure to Santinketan, through a literary detour, opened Dodiya’s eyes to the historical circumstances of what the art historian [[R Siva Kumar]] has called a “contextual modernism” developed in eastern India in the 1930s and ’40s during the turbulent decades of the global Depression, the Gandhian liberation struggle, the Tagorean cultural renaissance and World War II."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tehelka.com/creator-of-a-floating-world/|title=Creator of a Floating World - Ranjit Hoskote - Tehelka - Investigations, Latest News, Politics, Analysis, Blogs, Culture, Photos, Videos, Podcasts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Contextual Modernism'' in the recent past has found its usage in other related fields of studies, specially in [[Architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:444711|title="Contextual modernism" – is it possible?

===Modern Indian Painting===
{{main article|Modern Indian painting}}

During the colonial era, Western influences started to make an impact on Indian art. Some artists developed a style that used Western ideas of composition, perspective and realism to illustrate Indian themes. Others, like [[Jamini Roy]], consciously drew inspiration from folk art.Bharti Dayal has chosen to handle the traditional Mithila Painting in most contemporary way and uses both realism as well abstractionism in her work with a lot of fantasy mixed in to both .Her work has an impeccable sense of balance, harmony and grace.

By the time of Independence in 1947, several schools of art in India provided access to modern techniques and ideas. Galleries were established to showcase these artists. Modern Indian art typically shows the influence of Western styles, but is often inspired by Indian themes and images. Major artists are beginning to gain international recognition, initially among the Indian diaspora, but also among non-Indian audiences.

The [[Progressive Artists' Group]], established shortly after India became independent in 1947, was intended to establish new ways of expressing India in the post-colonial era. The founders were six eminent artists – [[K. H. Ara]], [[S. K. Bakre]], [[H. A. Gade]], [[M.F. Husain]], [[S.H. Raza]] and [[Francis Newton Souza|F. N. Souza]], though the group was dissolved in 1956, it was profoundly influential in changing the idiom of Indian art. Almost all India's major artists in the 1950s were associated with the group. Some of those who are well-known today are [[Bal Chabda]], [[Manishi Dey]], [[Vasudeo S. Gaitonde|V. S. Gaitonde]], [[Krishen Khanna]], [[Ram Kumar (artist)|Ram Kumar]], [[Tyeb Mehta]], [[Beohar Rammanohar Sinha]] and [[Akbar Padamsee]]. Other famous painters like [[Jahar Dasgupta]], [[Prokash Karmakar]], [[John Wilkins (Indian artist)|John Wilkins]], and Bijon Choudhuri enriched the art culture of India. They have become the icon of modern Indian art. Art historians like Prof. Rai [[Anand Krishna]] have also referred to those works of modern artistes that reflect Indian ethos.

Also, the increase in the discourse about Indian art, in English as well as vernacular Indian languages, appropriated the way art was perceived in the art schools. Critical approach became rigorous, critics like [[Geeta Kapur]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.khojworkshop.org/user/geeta_kapur |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130924023312/http://khojworkshop.org/user/geeta_kapur |archivedate=24 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afterall.org/online/geeta-kapur-part1|title=Afterall • Online • Geeta Kapur: On the Curatorial in India (Part 1)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[R .

The critics also had an important role as curators of important exhibitions, re-defining modernism and Indian-art.

Indian Art got a boost with the economic liberalisation of the country since the early 1990s. Artists from various fields now started bringing in varied styles of work. Post-liberalisation Indian art thus works not only within the confines of academic traditions but also outside it.  In this phase, artists have introduced even newer concepts which have hitherto not been seen in Indian art. [[Devajyoti Ray]] has introduced a new genre of art called [[Pseudorealism]]. Pseudorealist Art is an original art style that has been developed entirely on the Indian soil.  Pseudorealism takes into account the Indian concept of abstraction and uses it to transform regular scenes of Indian life into a fantastic images.

In post-liberalisation India, many artists have established themselves in the international art market like Anish Kapoor and Chintan whose mammoth artworks have acquired attention for their sheer size. Many art houses and galleries have also opened in USA and Europe to showcase Indian artworks.Some artists like chiman dangi(painter, printmaker) Bhupat Dudi, [[Subodh Gupta]], Piu Sarkar, Vagaram Choudhary, Amitava Sengupta and many others have done magic worldwide.[[Chhaya Ghosh]] is a gifted painter, and is pretty active in Triveni Art Gallery, New Delhi.

The '''International Book Project''' (IBP) is a registered [[501 (c)|501 (c)(3) not-for-profit organization]], founded by Harriet Van Meter in 1966, which has sent more than 7 million [[books]] abroad. Its mission is to promote education and [[literacy]] while broadening Americans' understanding of their neighbors, which it achieves by annually sending more than 300,000 books to schools, libraries, churches, and [[Peace Corps]] volunteers throughout the developing world and in the United States.  The project is based in [[Lexington, Kentucky]], in a warehouse it has owned since 1983.

==History==
Harriet Drury Van Meter visited [[India]] in 1965 by invitation of the [[United States Department of State]]. While in India, she witnessed long lines of people waiting just to borrow a book to study from.  She returned to Kentucky and placed an inquiry in the English-speaking Indian newspaper ''[[The Hindu]]'', offering books.  A large number of people responded, so Harriet Van Meter started sending books from her basement.  In 1986, Harriet Van Meter was nominated for a [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for her efforts, and she was a finalist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://askus.bloginky.com/2007/10/12/kentuckys-brush-with-nobelity/ Lexington Herald-Leader: Kentucky's brush with Nobelity]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, [[Kentucky Educational Television]] aired the documentary ''Harriet Van Meter: A Life Extraordinary''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ket.org/series/KHVAN/|title=Harriet Van Meter: A Life Extraordinary|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Book Project has sent over 7 million books worldwide since 1966. The organization celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kentucky.com/news/local/news-columns-blogs/tom-eblen/article42612801.html|title=Tom Eblen: Started in Lexington basement, International Book Project prepares to celebrate 50 years|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kentucky.com/opinion/op-ed/article100482437.html|title=50 years ago, one Lexington woman began a global outreach|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
By providing needed quality books to the people of the developing world, the International Book Project seeks:

*To promote education and literacy in developing countries and in areas of need within the United States
*To broaden Americans' understanding of their neighbors, and
*To foster global friendships and strengthen world unity

==Shipping Methods==
IBP sends books in the following ways:

*Small Shipment - 35-pound boxes of books, which can be sent to anyone in the developing world with a postal address
*Pallet - A pallet typically contains 700 - 1,000 books. It is often sent to organizations that need more books than a small shipment can provide, but do not need or have funding for a sea container.
*Sea Container - 20' or 40' containers that travel by sea, containing 10,000 - 40,000 books and can stock a University library or provide textbooks for an entire school district. 

===Volunteer Opportunities===
IBP was started when volunteers started sending books from Mrs. Van Meter's basement, and IBP still needs help. IBP is a small organization, a staff of five, with just four full-time employees. 

==Programs==
===Books Out===
''Books Out'' is a self-service program in which representatives from organizations abroad or in areas of need within the United States come to select books at the IBP warehouse and deliver them personally.

===Books as Bridges===
''Books as Bridges'' is an international pen-pal program which partners Central Kentucky classrooms with classrooms in developing countries around the world. Through shared artwork and letters of participants, the program encourages students to develop higher reading levels, cultural awareness, and international friendships. By fostering international friendships, Books as Bridges hopes to spark a passion for social change among Central Kentucky youth.

The classrooms in Central Kentucky receive cultural lessons about their partner classrooms.  In the developing world, the classrooms receive a box of books as an impetus to continue in the program.

==Peace Corps==
IBP often sends books to Peace Corps Volunteers.  In 1992, IBP was named "A Partner for Peace" by the US Peace Corps.

A '''''Lingua Ignota''''' (Latin for "unknown language") was  described by the 12th century [[abbess]] of Rupertsberg, [[Hildegard of Bingen|St. Hildegard of Bingen, OSB]], who apparently used it for mystical purposes. To write it, she used an alphabet of 23 letters denominated ''litterae ignotae''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bingensis|first1=Hildegardis|title=Riesencodex|date=1175-1190|pages=934, 464v|url=http://dfg-viewer.de/show/?tx_dlf%5Bid%5D=http%3A%2F%2Fdokumentserver.hlb-wiesbaden.de%2FHS_2%2Fmets17.xml&amp;tx_dlf%5Bpage%5D=934&amp;tx_dlf%5Bdouble%5D=0&amp;cHash=16dea2091d5605fe4f100c3fd07fdab5|accessdate=2014-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

She partially described the language in a work titled ''Lingua Ignota per simplicem hominem Hildegardem prolata'', which survived in two manuscripts, both dating to ca. 1200, the [[Wiesbaden Codex]] and a Berlin MS (Lat. Quart. 4º 674), previously Codex Cheltenhamensis 9303, collected by Sir [[Thomas Phillipps]].&lt;ref&gt;Steinmayer E; Sievers, E. (1895). [https://archive.org/stream/diealthochdeutsc03steiuoft#page/390/mode/2up ''Sachlich geordnete Glossare''].  Die Althochdeutschen Glossen, Vol. III. pp. 390-404.&lt;/ref&gt; The text is a [[glossary]] of 1011 words in Lingua Ignota, with [[Gloss (transliteration)|gloss]]es mostly in [[Latin]], sometimes in [[Middle High German|German]]; the words appear to be [[A priori (Languages)|a priori]] [[Neologism|coinages]], mostly nouns with a few adjectives. Grammatically it appears to be a partial [[relexification]] of Latin, that is, a language formed by substituting new vocabulary into an existing grammar.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Jean Jeskalian, ''Hildegard of Bingen: the creative dimensions of a Medieval personality."  Graduate Theological Union&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of Lingua Ignota is unknown, and it is not known who, besides its creator, was familiar with it. In the 19th century some{{who?|date=July 2018}} believed that Hildegard intended her language to be an ideal, [[universal language]]. However, nowadays{{when?|reason= starting when?|date=July 2018}} it is generally{{whom?|reason=If you don't mean that in the implausible sense of "by everyone", then by whom?|date=July 2018}} assumed that Lingua Ignota was devised as a secret language; like Hildegard's "unheard music", she would have attributed it to [[divine inspiration]]. Inasmuch as {{vague|reason= is this supposed mean "To the degree that" or "Since (as all readers will agree)"?|date=July 2018}}  the language was constructed by Hildegard, it may be considered one of the earliest known [[constructed language]]s.

In a letter to Hildegard, her friend and provost Wolmarus, fearing that Hildegard would soon die, asks ''[[ubi sunt|ubi]] tunc vox inauditae melodiae? et vox inauditae linguae?'' (Descemet, p.&amp;nbsp;346; "where, then, the voice of the unheard melody? And the voice of the unheard language?"), suggesting that the existence of Hildegard's language was known, but there were no initiates who would have preserved its knowledge after her death.

==Sample text==
The only extant text in the language is the following short passage:
:''O '''orzchis''' Ecclesia, armis divinis praecincta, et hyacinto ornata, tu es '''caldemia''' stigmatum '''loifolum''' et urbs scienciarum. O, o tu es etiam '''crizanta''' in alto sono, et es '''chorzta''' gemma.''
These two sentences are written mostly in Latin with five key words in Lingua Ignota; as only one of these is unambiguously found in the glossary (''loifol'' "people"), it is clear that the vocabulary was larger than 1011 words.  (Higley 2007 finds probable correspondences for two other words.)

:"O ''orzchis'' [[Ecclesia (Church)|Ecclesia]], girded with divine arms, and adorned with hyacinth, you are the ''caldemia'' of the wounds of the ''loifol'', and the city of sciences. O, o, and you are the ''crizanta'' in high sound, and you are the ''chorzta'' gem."
''loifol'' "people" apparently is inflected in Latin, yielding ''loifol-um''.

Newman (1987) conjectures the translation
:"O ''measureless'' Church, / girded with divine arms / and adorned with jacinth, / you are the ''fragrance'' of the wounds of ''nations'' / and the city of sciences. / O, o, and you are ''anointed'' / amid noble sound, / and you are a ''sparkling'' gem."

==The glossary==
The glossary is in a hierarchical order, first giving terms for God and angels, followed by terms for human beings and terms for family relationships, followed by terms for body-parts, illnesses, religious and worldly ranks, craftsmen, days, months, clothing, household implements, plants, and a few birds and insects. Terms for mammals are lacking (except for the [[bat]], Ualueria, listed among birds, and the [[Griffin|gryphon]], Argumzio, a half-mammal, also listed among the birds).

The first 30 entries are (after Roth 1880):
* Aigonz: ''deus'' (God)
* Aieganz: ''angelus'' (angel)
* Zuuenz: ''sanctus'' (saint)
* Liuionz: ''salvator'' (saviour)
* Diueliz: ''diabolus'' (devil)
* Ispariz: ''spiritus''
* Inimois: ''homo'' (human being)
* Jur: ''vir'' (man)
* Vanix: ''femina'' (woman)
* Peuearrez: ''patriarcha''
* Korzinthio: ''propheta''
* Falschin: ''[[vates]]''
* Sonziz: ''apostolus''
* Linschiol: ''martir''
* Zanziuer: ''confessor''
* Vrizoil: ''virgo'' (virgin)
* Jugiza: ''vidua'' (widow)
* Pangizo: ''penitens''
* Kulzphazur: ''attavus'' (great-great-great-grandfather)
* Phazur: ''avus'' (grandfather)
* Peueriz: ''pater'' (father)
* Maiz: ''maler'' (sic, for ''mater'', mother)
* Hilzpeueriz: ''nutricus'' (stepfather)
* Hilzmaiz: ''noverca'' (stepmother)
* Scirizin: ''filius (son)
* Hilzscifriz: ''privignus'' (stepson)
* Limzkil: ''infans'' (infant)
* Zains: ''puer'' (boy)
* Zunzial: ''iuvenis'' (youth)
* Bischiniz: ''adolescens'' (adolescent)

Nominal composition may be observed in ''peueriz'' "father" : ''hilz-peueriz'' "stepfather", ''maiz'' "mother" : ''hilz-maiz'' "stepmother", and ''scirizin'' "son" : ''hilz-scifriz'' "stepson", as well as ''phazur'' : ''kulz-phazur''. Suffixal derivation in ''peueriz'' "father", ''peuearrez'' "patriarch".

This is a list of [[botanical illustrator]]s born or active in Ireland.
[[Botanical illustration]] involves the painting, drawing and illustration of plants and ecosystems.

'''''Mapping the Practice and Profession of Sculpture in Britain and Ireland 1851–1951''''' ('''''Mapping Sculpture''''') is an online [[database]] of [[sculpture|sculptors]] and their works. It is the result of a three-year research programme, funded by the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]] and the [[British Academy]]. The project was a partnership between [[University of Glasgow]], the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] and the [[Henry Moore Institute]], with systems development being carried out by the [[Humanities Advanced Technology and Information Institute]].

The project represents the first authoritative study of sculptors, related businesses and trades, art infrastructures, professional networks and cultural geographies, between the [[Great Exhibition of 1851]], and the [[Festival of Britain]] in 1951. The database contains over 50,000 records about sculptural practice.

''Mapping Sculpture'' was originated by Ann Compton (Institute of Art History, University of Glasgow), who served as Project Director and Editor, with Professor Alison Yarrington (University of Glasgow, now University of Hull) as Principal Investigator and Dr. Marjorie Trusted (Victoria and Albert Museum) as Co-Investigator. HATII's Matthew Barr was the Systems Developer.

An upcoming special issue of the ''[http://www.pmsa.org.uk/publications/sculpture-journal/ Sculpture Journal]'', devoted to the ''Mapping Sculpture'' project, is due to be published in December 2012.

[[File:Tango couple closeup.jpg|thumb|upright|Veteran tango dancers]]
A '''milonguero''' is a person who spends time dancing social [[Tango (dance)|tango]]. The word comes from the term [[Milonga (dance event)|''milonga'']] referring to a tango dance event.

The term was used from the 1870s to mark a man who spent much of his time dancing tango of any style.&lt;ref name=Klein2009&gt;{{cite book |last=Klein |first=Gabriele |title=Tango in Translation: Tanz zwischen Medien, Kulturen, Kunst und Politik |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6VodutecZ48C&amp;pg=PA62 |series=Tanz Scripte |volume=19 |year=2009 |publisher=transcript Verlag |isbn=383761204X |pages=62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the early 20th century the term referred to a man immersed in the tango culture specific to Buenos Aires. A milonguero frequented dance halls, dancing to the music of tango, milonga and vals. Such a man was "raised and groomed on tango" and his "reverence for the dance and its traditions" strongly influenced the way he danced.  The term ''milonguero'' was used by ''others'' to distinguish a skilled and courteous dancer, not a term for oneself.&lt;ref name=Romero2010&gt;{{cite book |last=Romero |first=Migdalia |title=Tango Lover's Guide to Buenos Aires: Insights and Recommendations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fwMyUNxq1TAC&amp;pg=PA78 |year=2010 |publisher=iUniverse |isbn=1440166757 |pages=78–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the [[Revolución Libertadora|1955 coup]] ousted [[Juan Perón]] in Argentina, the tango was repressed, a sort of "dark age" for tango dancing, ending in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history-of-tango.com/dark-age.html |title=The Dark Age of Tango |author=[[Christine Denniston|Denniston, Christine]] |year=2003 |work=History of Tango |publisher=history-of-tango.com |accessdate=May 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the beginning of the 1980s ''milonguero'' also had a strong negative connotation, signaling a womanizer who typically had no job.&lt;ref name=Danteinterview2012&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuralwF3naU |title=Practimilonguero interview with Oscar "Cacho" Dante, dance partner and teacher of Susana Miller |accessdate=Oct 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such womanizers would typically visit downtown milongas and cafes where anonymity was more prevalent than in the clubs of the barrios; the crowded circumstances and the greater intimacy allowed by the greater anonymity fostered a [[close-embrace]] style dancing, which was the motivation of Susana Miller to use the term ''milonguero'' to denote the close embrace style dancing prevalent in downtown milongas.&lt;ref name=Danteinterview2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tangovoice2012&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tangovoice.wordpress.com/2011/07/12/tango-estilo-del-centro-tango-downtown-style-reclaiming-the-term-as-a-replacement-for-tango-milonguero/#comment-378 |title=Tango Estilo del Centro (Tango Downtown Style): Reclaiming the Term as a Replacement for Tango Milonguero - discussion| accessdate=Oct 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''milonguero'' changed to mean one who had been a frequent dancer during [[Tango music#Golden Age|tango's Golden Age]] of the 1930s and '40s&lt;ref name=Denniston2003&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history-of-tango.com/tango-renaissance.html |title=The Tango Renaissance |last=Denniston |first=Christine |year=2003 |work=History of Tango |publisher=history-of-tango.com |accessdate=May 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it also lost its negative connotations. Due to the loss of the negative connotations there are more dancers who would nowadays be considered ''milongueros'' - such as many respected and skillful salon style dancers of the barrios -  and hence the identification of the dance of ''milongueros'' with ''milonguero-style tango'' is no longer apt.&lt;ref name=Tangovoice2012/&gt; 

Though there are many individual differences between men, milongueros generally dress conservatively, wearing a sport coat or suit, dress shirt and often a tie. They do not attempt to converse with their partner during a song. They are keenly aware of others on the dance floor and they maintain the "line of dance", a stately progression of all the couples moving counter-clockwise around the dance floor. The milonguero does not bump into or kick other dancers; he employs mostly circular movements to keep an inward focus for himself and his partner, and to allow for small adornments made with the foot. Above all, he interprets the mood of the music with his dancing.&lt;ref name=Romero2010/&gt; He cherishes each musical pause as it comes, and he executes movements that coincide with musical phrases.&lt;ref&gt;Klein 2009, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

The milonguero generally selects skillful partners to maintain his reputation. He makes certain to lead his partner into movements that will show her in the best light; he does not show off his own skill to the detriment of his partner. He knows that if he makes the woman look good dancing then he looks good dancing.&lt;ref name=Romero2010/&gt;

He dances to songs from his favorite artists, sitting out the others. Many milongueros prefer music of the Golden Age, especially the marked rhythmic music of [[Juan D'Arienzo]], the older rhythmic pulses of [[Francisco Lomuto]], or the sweeping orchestrations of [[Carlos di Sarli]]. Many milongueros will not dance to a song sung by a female vocalist or—out of great respect—a song sung by [[Carlos Gardel]]. Some take this preference further and will not dance to any song containing lyrics. Modern tangos such as those by [[Astor Piazzolla]] are generally avoided; the transitional later tangos of [[Osvaldo Pugliese]], with their emphasis on tempo changes, are shunned by many but particularly favored by others.&lt;ref name=Romero2010/&gt; Recordings produced before 1983 are preferred.&lt;ref name=Albrecht2009&gt;{{cite book |last=Albrecht |first=Madlen |title=Le développement du Tango à partir de 1983: Un travail sur le changement du Tango de 1983 jusqu'à aujourd'hui |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lq6tU5shpoUC&amp;pg=PA6 |year=2009 |publisher=GRIN Verlag |language=French |isbn=3640390946 |pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular tango tunes from the Golden Age never fade for the milonguero: veteran dancer José "Poroto" Oviedo told his friends to "play di Sarli at my wake", a request that was honored at his death in April 2000, the romantic di Sarli song "Bahía Blanca" chosen for the occasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Robert Farris |title=Tango: The Art History of Love |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2Ce8NRaM0GYC&amp;pg=PA189 |year=2006 |publisher=Random House Digital |isbn=1400095794 |page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, the feminine form ''milonguera'' has been used to refer to a woman who is an avid tango dancer, one who goes out dancing as much as possible.&lt;ref name=Washabaugh1998&gt;{{cite book |last=Washabaugh |first=William |title=The Passion of Music and Dance: Body, Gender and Sexuality |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3H7I0T1YL1AC&amp;pg=PA98 |year=1998 |publisher=Berg |isbn=1859739091 |pages=97–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other similar terms are ''tanguero'' for a man and ''tanguera'' for a woman.

'''''Mr. Bliss''''' is a children's [[picture book]] by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], published posthumously in book form in 1982. One of Tolkien's least-known short works, it tells the story of Mr. Bliss and his first ride in his new motor-car.  Many adventures follow: encounters with bears, angry neighbours, irate shopkeepers, and assorted collisions.

The story was inspired by Tolkien's own vehicular mishaps with his first car, purchased in 1932.  The bears were based on [[Teddy bear|toy bears]] owned by Tolkien's sons.  Tolkien was both author and illustrator of the book.  His narrative binds the story and illustrations tightly together, as the text often comments directly on the pictures.

Several commentators have compared ''Mr. Bliss'' with the works of [[Beatrix Potter]] and [[Edward Lear]], and also to ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wayne G. Hammond|Hammond, Wayne G.]] &amp; [[Christina Scull]] (2006), ''[[The J. R. R. Tolkien Companion and Guide]]'', HarperCollins, Reader's Guide p. 592; {{ISBN|978-0-00-714918-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Mr. Bliss'' wasn't published during Tolkien's lifetime. He submitted it to his publishers as a balm to readers who were hungry for more from Tolkien after the success of ''[[The Hobbit]]''.  The ink and coloured pencil illustrations would have made production costs prohibitively expensive.  Tolkien agreed to redraw the pictures in a simpler style, but then found he didn't have time to do it. The manuscript lay in a drawer until 1957, when he sold it (as well as the original manuscripts of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''The Hobbit'', and ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]'') to [[Marquette University]] for £1,250.

The book was published in 1982, with Tolkien's difficult-to-read handwritten story and illustrations on one page, and a typeset transcription on the facing page.

Tolkien used two names from ''Mr. Bliss'' for hobbits in ''The Lord of the Rings'': [[Gaffer Gamgee]] and [[Boffin (hobbit family)|Boffin]].

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to guitars:

A '''[[guitar]]''' is a [[plucked string instrument]], usually played with fingers or a [[guitar pick|pick]]. The guitar consists of a body with a rigid neck to which the strings, generally six in number, are attached. Most guitar necks have metal frets attached (the exception is fretless bass guitars). Guitars are traditionally constructed of various woods and strung with animal gut or, more recently, with either nylon or steel strings. Some modern 2010-era guitars are made of [[polycarbonate]] materials. Guitars are made and repaired by [[luthier]]s. There are two primary families of guitars: acoustic and electric. An acoustic guitar has a wooden top and a hollow body. An electric guitar may be a solid-body or hollow body instrument, which is made louder by using a pickup and plugging it into a [[guitar amplifier|guitar amplifier and speaker]]. Another type of guitar is the low-pitched [[bass guitar]].

== Commissions ==
The first documented reference to Pace di Valentino is for two [[Seal (emblem)|seals]] made in 1257.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/pace-di-valentino_(Dizionario-Biografico)/|title=PACE di Valentino in "Dizionario Biografico"|website=www.treccani.it|access-date=2017-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1265 he received two significant commissions: the first was for a large golden [[chalice]] ("''calicem magnum di auro''") weighing about 11 pounds and a corresponding [[paten]], both of which are now lost; the second was for an elaborate gold-plated silver book cover. These were items not made for daily use, and having received these requests suggests that he was well known and well regarded in his field.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Other notable works attributed to him include the [[chalice]] of San Atto made {{circa|1270}},&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and numerous figures in the late 13th-century Altar of St. James found the [[Pistoia Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=E2CTAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT949&amp;dq=%22pace+di+valentino%22&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22pace%20di%20valentino%22&amp;f=false|title=Medieval Italy: An Encyclopedia|last=Kleinhenz|first=Christopher|date=2004-08-02|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135948801|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some art historians suggest that he made the [[reliquary]] of [[Galgano Guidotti|San Galgano]]'s head, now found in Siena's [[Museo dell'Opera del Duomo (Siena)|Museo dell'Opera del Duomo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.operaduomo.siena.it/museo_approfondimento.htm|title=Opa - cattedrale panorama museo cripta battistero oratorio siena|last=21|first=Studio|website=www.operaduomo.siena.it|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this is disputed by others.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition, other extant documents indicate the details of his purchases of gold, silver, pearls, beads, and precious stones for use in his shop, as well as details of payments for works commissioned.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  

He was the first Sienese goldsmith to work for the papal court (under popes [[Pope Nicholas III|Nicholas III]], [[Martin IV]], [[Honorius IV]], and [[Boniface VIII]])&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and was actively working for Boniface VIII in the region of [[Montefiascone]] until at least 1296.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=cucRAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22pace+di+valentino%22&amp;dq=%22pace+di+valentino%22&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Benedetto XI: papa domenicano (1240-1304)|last=Viganò|first=Alberto|date=2006-01-01|publisher=Nerbini|isbn=9788888625430|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was influential on other goldsmiths of the following generation, including [[Guccio di Mannaia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=pCQ4AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA182&amp;lpg=PA182&amp;dq=pace+di+valentino+guccio+di+mannaia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-ueGqZ7GBo&amp;sig=E9pg1fQgjjWkW4469fZkj4Bd7g0&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjV4vj6merRAhWDmBoKHSw4A1g4ChDoAQgjMAM#v=onepage&amp;q=pace%20di%20valentino%20guccio%20di%20mannaia&amp;f=false|title=Splendori Di Assisi.

'''Paul-Émile Boutigny''' (10 March 1853 in [[Paris]] &amp;ndash; 27 June 1929 in Paris) was a French painter who specialized in military subjects.

==Life and work==
His father was a tailor and his mother worked as a seamstress. Following the [[Franco-Prussian War]], he studied at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] under [[Alexandre Cabanel]]&lt;ref name="N"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/nospeintresetscu00mart#page/70/mode/2up Open Library] ''Nos peintres et sculpteurs, graveurs, dessinateurs : portraits et biographies suivis d'une notice sur les Salons français depuis 1673'', les Sociétés de Beaux-Arts, (1897), p.71&lt;/ref&gt; and developed a unique style of battle painting, drawn from personal experience. He was a regular participant in the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] after 1880.

He was decorated with the [[Légion d'honneur]] in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gouv.fr/public/mistral/leonore_fr?ACTION=CHERCHER&amp;FIELD_1=COTE&amp;VALUE_1=LH%2F340%2F23 Base Léonore] [[Minister of Culture (France)|Ministry of Culture]]&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, he began producing the satirical, artistic and literary journal ''[[Cocorico (magazine)|Cocorico]]'', which promoted [[Art Nouveau]].

He illustrated several works:
* ''Chants du Soldat'', a popular collection of patriotic poems by [[Paul Déroulède]].&lt;ref name="N"/&gt; Calmann Lévy, Paris 1881
* ''[[Boule de Suif]]'' by [[Guy de Maupassant]], Calmann Lévy, Paris 1899
* ''Les Héros de France'' ([[Lazare Hoche|Hoche]], [[François Séverin Marceau|Marceau]] and [[Louis Charles Antoine Desaix|Desaix]]) by {{ill|Théodore Cahu|fr}}, SDL, Paris 1900
* ''L'attaque du Moulin'' by [[Émile Zola]], from the anthology ''[[Les Soirées de Médan]]'',  Collection des Dix, Paris 1901

Some of his most familiar paintings include:
* ''An Episode from the [[Invasion of France (1795)|Quiberon Affair]]'' (1881). Musée des Beaux-Arts et Arts Décoratifs de Mirande
* ''The Seventh Line to Attack [[Aimable Pélissier|Malakoff]] and the Death of Captain Pagès'' (1887). Hall of Honor of the Seventh Infantry Regiment.
* ''Napoléon - The [[Battle of Aspern-Essling]] - Death of [[Jean Lannes]], Marshall of the Empire'' (1894)
* ''Napoléon Bonaparte - The Revolt at [[Pavia]]'' (1895)

'''''Pittura infamante''''' ({{IPA-it|pitˈtuːra imfaˈmante|pron}}; [[Italian language|Italian]] for "defaming portrait"; plural ''pitture infamanti'') is a [[genre]] of [[defamation|defamatory]] [[painting]] and [[relief]], common in [[Italian Renaissance|Renaissance Italy]] in [[city-state]]s in the north and center of the [[Italian Peninsula]] during the [[Trecento]], [[Quattrocento]], and [[Cinquecento]].&lt;ref name="edgerton"/&gt; Popular subjects of ''pittura infamante'' include [[treason|traitors]], [[theft|thieves]], and those guilty of [[bankruptcy]] or public [[fraud]], often in cases where no legal remedy was available. Commissioned by governments of [[city-state]]s and displayed in public centers, ''pittura infamante'' were both a form of "municipal justice" (or "forensic art"&lt;ref name="ed31"&gt;Edgerton, 1980, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;) and a medium for internal political struggles.&lt;ref&gt;Wieruszowski, 1944.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
According to Samuel Edgerton, the genre began to decline precisely when it came to be regarded as a [[form of art]] rather than [[effigy]]; the power of the genre derived from a feudal-based [[code of honor]], where [[shame]] was one of the most significant [[social punishment]]s.&lt;ref name="edgerton"&gt;Edgerton, 1985. Chapters 2 and 3.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, ''pittura infamante'' has its roots in the doctrines of ''[[pheme|fama]]'' and ''[[infamia]]'' in ancient [[Roman law]].&lt;ref name="mills38"&gt;Mills, 2005, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Display==
''Pitture infamanti'' could appear in any public place, but some places were more frequently adorned with them; for example, the first floor exterior of the [[Bargello]] periodically contained numerous, life-size, ''pittura infamante'' [[fresco]]es. Florentine law required the ''[[Podestà]]]'' have such caricatures painted, and accompanied by verbal identification those held in [[contempt of court]] for financial offenses (bad debt, bankruptcy, fraud, forgery, etc.).&lt;ref name="ed2"/&gt; ''Pitture infamanti'' were far more common in [[Republic of Florence|Republican Florence]] than in [[Italian city-states|autocratic city states]], whose rulers often deemed them to be sources of "disrepute."&lt;ref&gt;Dean, 2000, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
Common themes of ''pittura infamante''&amp;mdash;which were meant to be humiliating&amp;mdash;include depicting the subject as wearing a mitre or hanging upside down, being in the presence of unclean animals such as pigs or donkeys or those deemed evil like snakes; ''pittura infamante'' would also contain captions listing the offenses of the subject.&lt;ref name="dean7"&gt;Dean, 2000, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pittura infamante'' could originate as more favorable depictions, only to be transformed after the subject had fallen out of favor.&lt;ref&gt;Dean, 2000, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imagery==
''Pittura infamante'' always depicted men and never women, and generally depicted upper class men (who would have the most to lose from [[character assassination]]).&lt;ref name="mills38"/&gt; The act of hanging itself was also significant, as affluent criminals would generally be afforded the privilege of beheading rather than hanging; hanging was also shameful in religious contexts (e.g. [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]]).&lt;ref name="mills38"/&gt; The [[Literary topos|topos]] of ''mundus inversus'' ("world upside down") is often associated with comedy and humiliation.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, 2005, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Famous artists who painted ''pitture infamanti'' frescoes include [[Andrea del Castagno]], [[Sandro Botticelli]], and [[Andrea del Sarto]].&lt;ref&gt;Edgerton, 1980, p. 30-31.&lt;/ref&gt; There are no surviving examples of ''pitture infamanti'' frescoes, but contemporary sources suggest that they were brightly colored.&lt;ref name="ed31"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dean7"/&gt; Detailed descriptions of ''pitture infamanti'' in primary sources are rare.&lt;ref name="dean45"&gt;Dean, 2000, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; A very few preparatory drawings, however, are extant, and [[The Hanged Man (Tarot card)|The Hanged Man]] from [[Tarot]] cards is thought to resemble the archetypal ''pittura infamante'' theme, as Tarot decks were first produced in northern Italy in the 1440s.&lt;ref name="mills38"/&gt;

==Records==
Documentary evidence for ''pittura infamante'' outside Italy is rarer but existent. For example, records support the use of "very unpleasant pictures" painted on cloths during the [[Hundred Years' War]] and the reign of [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]] in [[France]], and&amp;mdash;later&amp;mdash;in [[England]] and north [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Mills, 2005, p. 43-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pitture infamanti'' were the counterpoint of another contemporary form of secular, full-length portrait: ''uomini famosi'' ("famous men") or ''uomini illustri'' ("illustrious men"), which depicted figures from the [[Old Testament]] or [[classical antiquity|Antiquity]] in a positive context, generally on the interior of private or civic buildings as moral exemplars.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, 2005, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subjects of ''pittura infamante''==
;Bologna
*[[Konrad von Landau]], painted on the walls of [[Bologna]] for treachery; in response Landau created his own "''pittura infamante''" on the saddle of his horse, depicting the local politicians hung upside down by their feet in the hand of a giant whore.&lt;ref&gt;Caferro, 2006, p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt;
;Fermo

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1561">The '''Sarcophagus of Stilicho''' is a marble [[Early Christian art|Early Christian]] [[sarcophagus]] used since before the 10th-century as the base for the pulpit of the church of [[Sant'Ambrogio, Milan|San Ambrogio]] in Milan, Italy. It appears to have been made some decades prior to the death of Stilicho, and thus likely not associated with the Roman General. 

==Description==
The sarcophagus was carved from Marble from quarries near [[Como]], but appears to date stylistically from circa 390 and the reign of [[Theodosius the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1kSpN3Kfgc0C Early Christian and Byzantine Art], by John Beckwith, Richard Krautheimer, Slobodan Ćurčić; page 46.&lt;/ref&gt; The panels depict both New and Old Testament scenes including:&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3-NhdelLo1oC DK Eyewitness Guide to Milan], page 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6831">'''Scene and sequel''' are two types of written passages used by authors to advance the [[plot (narrative)|plot]] of a [[narrative|story]]. ''Scenes'' propel a story forward as the [[character (arts)|character]] attempts to achieve a goal.&lt;ref name="Swain 84-85"&gt;Swain, p. 84-85.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Sequels'' provide an opportunity for the character to react to the scene, analyze the new situation, and decide upon the next course of action.&lt;ref&gt;Swain, p. 96-100.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scene==
The concept of a scene in written [[fiction]] has evolved over many years. [[Dwight V. Swain]], in ''Techniques of the Selling Writer'' (1965) defined a ''scene'' as a unit of [[Conflict (narrative)|conflict]], an account of an effort to attain a goal despite opposition. According to Swain, the functions of a scene are to provide interest and to move the story forward. The structure of a scene, as described by Swain, is (1) goal, (2) conflict, (3) disaster.&lt;ref name="Swain 84-85"/&gt;

In ''The Art of Fiction'' (1983), John Gardner described a scene as having an unbroken flow of action without a lapse of time or leap from one setting to another.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the years, other authors have attempted to improve on the definition of ''scene'', and to explain its use and structure.&lt;ref&gt;Bickham, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. xxii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Obstfeld, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosenfeld, p. 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scofield, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequel==
In addition to defining a scene, Swain described a ''sequel'' as a unit of transition that links two scenes, adding that a sequel functions to translate disaster into goal, telescope reality, and control tempo. Swain also described the structure of a sequel as (1) reaction, (2) [[dilemma]], and (3) decision.&lt;ref&gt;Swain, p. 96, 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors have attempted to improve on the definition of a ''sequel'' and to explain its use and structure.&lt;ref&gt;Bickham, p. 50-51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morrell, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. xxiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proactive vs. reactive==
Rather than viewing scenes and sequels as distinct types of passages, some authors express the concept as two types of scenes: proactive and reactive.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, p. 61, 63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ingermanson and Economy, p. 168, 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scenes and sequels==
Swain defined, described, and explained scene and sequel as if they were separate entities, but then he explained that they must complement each other, linking together smoothly into a story. He went on to observe that

*An author controls [[Pace (narrative)|pacing]] by the way he proportions scene to sequel.
*The peaks and valleys in a diagram of a story correspond to scenes and sequels.
*Flexibility is important, versus a mechanical approach.&lt;ref&gt;Swain, p. 113-115.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structural units of fiction== 
The ''structural units of [[fiction writing]]'' comprise all fiction.&lt;ref name="Klaassen 3"&gt;Klaassen, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
*The smallest units of writing are [[word]]s, [[phrase]]s, [[clause]]s, [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s, and [[paragraph]]s.
*Two or more paragraphs with some common purpose are referred to as ''passages'' or ''segments'' of writing.&lt;ref&gt;Scofield, p. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Scenes and sequels are specialized passages of writing. A ''scene'' is a passage of writing in which the character attempts to achieve a goal. A ''sequel'' is a passage of writing in which the character reacts reflectively to the previous scene.&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
*A [[chapter (books)|chapter]] is a segment of writing delineated by a form of punctuation called a ''chapter break''.&lt;ref&gt;Lukeman, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Prologue]]'' and ''[[epilogue]]'' are two specialized types of chapters.&lt;ref name="Klaassen 3"/&gt;
*A chapter may include one or more ''sections'', passages separated by another form of punctuation called a ''section break''.&lt;ref&gt;Lukeman, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Some [[novel]]s, especially long ones, may be further divided into ''books'' or ''parts'', each including two or more chapters.

==Types of passages==
Passages of writing may be classified into four groups: (1) scenes, (2) sequels, (3) passages that are ''neither'' scenes nor sequels, and (4) passages that include elements of ''both'' scenes and sequels. Examples of passages that are neither scenes nor sequels include ''fragments''&lt;ref&gt;Scofield, p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;  of scenes or sequels and passages of [[narration]], [[description]], or [[Exposition (narrative)|exposition]]. An example of a passage that includes elements of both scenes and sequels is the ''problem-solving passage'', common in [[mystery fiction|mystery]] and [[detective stories]].&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. 81-82.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of scenes==
Scenes may be classified by their position within the story (such as an opening scene or a [[climax (narrative)|climax]] scene). A scene may be classified by the [[fiction-writing mode]] that dominates its presentation (as in an [[action fiction|action]] scene or a [[Dialogue in writing|dialogue]] scene). Some scenes have specialized roles (such as [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] scenes and [[flashforward]] scenes).&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Self-Portrait as the Allegory of Painting''''', also known as '''''Autoritratto in veste di Pittura''''' or simply '''''La Pittura''''', was painted by the Italian Baroque artist [[Artemisia Gentileschi]]. The oil-on-canvas painting measures {{Convert|96.5|x|73.7|cm}} and was probably produced during Gentileschi’s stay in England between 1638 and 1639. It was in the collection of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and was returned to the [[Royal Collection]] at the Restoration (1660) and remains there.  In 2015 it was put on display in the "Cumberland Gallery" in [[Hampton Court Palace]].

The scene depicts Gentileschi painting herself, who is in turn represented as the “Allegory of Painting” illustrated by [[Cesare Ripa]]. It is now in the British [[Royal Collection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Self-Portrait as the Allegory of Painting (La Pittura)|url=http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/eGallery/object.asp?maker=12024&amp;object=405551&amp;row=0&amp;detail=about|work=Royal Collection|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting demonstrates rare feminist themes from a time when women seldom held jobs, let alone were well known for them. Gentileschi’s portrayal of herself as the epitome of the arts was a bold statement to make for the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=France|first=Sarah|title=Self-Portrait as the Allegory of Painting|url=http://rebirthofreason.com/Spirit/Art/129.shtml|work=Rebirth of Reason}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the painting is today overshadowed by many of Gentileschi’s other, more dramatic and raw scenes reflecting the artist’s troubling younger years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kleiner|first=Fred S.|title=Gardner's Art through the Ages|year=2005|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|pages=661–662|edition=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Self-Portrait'' was very controversial in its time.

That it is a [[self-portrait]] as well as an allegory was first proposed by [[Michael Levey]] in the 20th century, and is not universally accepted, as some art historians see the features of the figure here as too different from those in other portraits of the artist.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, 374&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==
Gentileschi was born in Rome in 1593, just at the start of [[Baroque painting]].  Gentileschi’s father, [[Orazio Gentileschi|Orazio]], was a well-known artist, and Artemisia trained in his workshop for a number of years before creating works herself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kleiner|first=Fred S.|title=Gardner's Art through the Ages|year=2005|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|pages=661–662|edition=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1610s, Artemisia was raped by a somewhat older member of the workshop, Agostino Tassi, an event which coloured the rest of her life and is reflected in her art, which often shows subjects with a "[[Power of Women]]" themes such as  ''[[Judith Slaying Holofernes (Artemisia Gentileschi)|Judith Slaying Holofernes]]'' and ''Salome with the Head of St. John the Baptist''. The artist's focus on her work, away from the viewer, highlights the drama of the Baroque period, and the changing role of the artist from craftsperson to singular innovator.&lt;ref&gt;Frances Borzello, ''Seeing Ourselves: Women's Self-Portraiture'', 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Abstract concepts like "Painting" were traditionally represented by female allegorical figures, and therefore the painting was not one that any male painter could present in the same way, as both [[self-portrait]] and [[allegory]].  The ''Self-Portrait'' was also influenced by the works of Cesare Ripa, most notably his ''Iconologia'', in which he suggests how virtues and abstract concepts should be depicted, with human qualities and appearances.  Ripa said "Painting" should be shown as: “A beautiful woman, with full black hair, disheveled, and twisted in various ways, with arched eyebrows that show imaginative thought, the mouth covered with a cloth tied behind her ears, with a chain of gold at her throat from which hangs a mask, and has written in front "imitation." She holds in her hand a brush, and in the other the palette, with clothes of evanescently covered drapery.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lester|first=Maureen|title=Self-Portrait as the Allegory of Painting (La Pittura)|url=https://ritdml.rit.edu/bitstream/handle/1850/6095/MLesterKearse2007.pdf?sequence=1|work=Women and the Visual Arts|date=February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other than the cloth tied around the mouth, Gentileschi follows this prescription quite accurately.

==Description==
The composition of the painting mirrors other artworks of the time, using diagonal lines to flaunt the female figure and emphasize her movement both in toward the canvas and out towards the viewers. The use of foreshortening and other three-dimensional techniques not only demonstrate Gentileschi’s talent as an artist, but also bring the viewers into the painting on physical and emotional levels.

The light is clearly coming from the left, but the source is not visible and is unusually harsh. The front of Gentileschi’s body is lit perfectly, but her back is obscured. Across the forehead and cheeks and down the side of the neck and left shoulder a clear line separates the light from the dark, a [[chiaroscuro]] technique which was used frequently during the Baroque era to add a sense of drama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Machado|first=John|title=Gentileschi's Self-Portrait as the Allegory of Painting|url=http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/gentileschi-self-portrait|work=Smart History |author2=John Machado |author3=Denise Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The textural element, so important in Baroque paintings, is found in the wisps in the disheveled hair, the crinkles in the sleeve with spilled paint cracking near the wrist, and the dirty hands, which augment the painting's realism.

Finally, the colour in the portrait is noteworthy, partially due to the lighting and partially due to the natural difference in tones. Whereas the darker clothing and background nearly seem to blend together, the pale skin of the face and right arm jump out immediately. The gold chain near the neck shimmers, while the chain near the chest (ending in a mask pendant) slowly dies down into a lacklustre brown.

==Interpretation==
Because Ripa’s image of “Painting” took the form of a woman, Gentileschi could use the description to her advantage to paint herself in the best light as an artist. While being a female during the Baroque era was largely negative in terms of rights and lifestyle, Gentileschi found this gem in ''Ideologia'' to amp up her reputation. Additionally, although many of the idealized figures of women evoked salacious or suggestive ideas during this time, Gentileschi was able to successfully manipulate “Painting” to be empowering (not demeaning) to women.

Gentileschi’s depiction of herself as the Allegory of Painting has made her seem somewhat egotistical to some critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=France|first=Sarah|title=Self-Portrait as the Allegory of Painting|url=http://rebirthofreason.com/Spirit/Art/129.shtml|work=Rebirth of Reason}}&lt;/ref&gt; Representing oneself as the epitome of an idea is certainly a huge claim, and it may seem that Gentileschi is proclaiming herself as one of the most magnificent artists, though she was still relatively unknown at the time. However, Gentileschi’s portrayal of herself as the Allegory should be looked at as a positive, showing the world what a woman could do, rather than just Gentileschi as an artist. Furthermore, as art historian [[Mary Garrard]] claims, only a woman artist could present herself in this way, as allegorical figures were limited to the bodies of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garrard|first1=Mary |authorlink=Mary Garrard|title=Artemisia Gentileschi's Self-Portrait as the Allegory of Painting|journal=[[College Art Association|The Art Bulletin]]|date=1980| volume=62|issue=1|pages=97–112|jstor=3049963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article in the Brooklyn ''New York Daily News'', staff writer Elizabeth Lazarowitz quotes Steven Zucker, "Art can be really intimidating for people", said Zucker. "If we can make art feel exciting and interesting and very much relevant to a historical moment...art can have real meaning." Unlike reading about art in a book, "the idea of the audio was to keep a student's eyes on the image", he explained. "It helped students to learn the material a lot better."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/brooklyn/2011/02/25/2011-02-25_masterpiece_theater_vids_new_way_to_look_at_art.html "Brooklyn-based art historians launch website with videos of masterpieces" New York Daily News, 2/25/2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a collaborative article by Beth Harris and Steven Zucker, the founders explain the value of the resource for teachers, students, and informal learners: "Smarthistory is helping teachers who are not specialists in art history find strategies to make the subject accessible and meaningful to students who might otherwise not have cultural resources available to them. And for college students, the site is fast becoming an attractive alternative to the commercial textbook whose short life cycle and $100+ price tag has increasingly become a barrier."&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:bhHeVbf82cEJ:openaccess.uoc.edu/webapps/o2/bitstream/10609/5081/6/Zucker_editat.pdf+beth+harris+smarthistory&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESjS1HrPqlUZBCUfp3VYz0UDmX0KBXi1hn_R1Vra7yaTP9uIjdKlRBELcD0KzrArBHzEjHI7bpvF52q0sVV9r7PUl9nYH10GExmuJ_QhmyveHLm9Gpha9t4dckaOwhzwn74C1YUk&amp;sig=AHIEtbT5zd1NJEjqrV1SEwwquFk6RBcNAw "Conversation is Key: A Short History of Smarthistory.org"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a ''Chronicle for Higher Education'' article, Beth Harris is quoted on the ambitions and goals of Smarthistory: "We really just wanted to re-embed the objects in our world", says Harris, who is the founder and executive editor of Smarthistory as well as the director of digital learning at a New York City museum. "We thought that that would make them more relevant and more engaging for students."&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/%E2%80%98smarthistory%E2%80%99-rethinks-the-art-history-textbook-online/28395 "'Smarthistory' rethinks the art history textbook online"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Basket of Bread''''' is a [[painting]] by [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Surrealism|surrealist]] [[Salvador Dalí]]. The painting depicts four pieces of bread with butter on them sitting in a basket. One is separated from the others and is half-bitten. The basket sits on a white cloth. The painting resides at the [[Salvador Dalí Museum]], [[St. Petersburg, Florida]]. 

The painting was completed in 1926 when Dalí was twenty-two years old, shortly after he had finished his formal art class in Madrid where he was studying the Dutch Masters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daliweb.tampa.fl.us/25.htm The Basket of Bread at Daliweb.tampa.fl.us]&lt;/ref&gt; It is among the earliest of several paintings of bread by Dalí; a later example is ''[[Basket of Bread]]'' (1945).

'''''The Cat in the Hat''''' is a [[children's book]] written and illustrated by Theodor Geisel under the pen name [[Dr. Seuss]] and first published in 1957. The story centers on a tall [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] cat, who wears a red and white-striped hat and a red bow tie. The Cat shows up at the house of Sally and her brother one rainy day when their mother is away. Despite the repeated objections of the children's fish, the Cat shows the children a few of his tricks in an attempt to entertain them. In the process he and his companions, Thing One and Thing Two, wreck the house. The children and the fish become more and more alarmed until the Cat produces a machine that he uses to clean everything up and disappears just before the children's mother comes home.

Geisel created the book in response to a debate in the United States about literacy in [[early childhood]] and the ineffectiveness of traditional [[Primer (textbook)|primers]] such as those featuring [[Dick and Jane]]. Geisel was asked to write a more entertaining primer by William Spaulding, whom he had met during World War II and who was then director of the education division at [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton Mifflin]]. However, because Geisel was already under contract with [[Random House]], the two publishers agreed to a deal: Houghton Mifflin published the education edition, which was sold to schools, and Random House published the trade edition, which was sold in bookstores.

Geisel gave varying accounts of how he created ''The Cat in the Hat'', but in the version he told most often he was so frustrated with the word list from which he could choose words to write his story that he decided to scan the list and create a story based on the first two words he found that rhymed. The words he found were ''cat'' and ''hat''. The book was met with immediate critical and commercial success. Reviewers praised it as an exciting alternative to traditional primers. Three years after its debut, the book had already sold over a million copies, and in 2001 ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' listed the book at number nine on its list of best-selling children's books of all time. The book's success led to the creation of [[Beginner Books]], a publishing house centered on producing similar books for young children learning to read. In 1983, Geisel said, "It is the book I'm proudest of because it had something to do with the death of the Dick and Jane primers." The book was adapted into [[The Cat in the Hat (TV special)|a 1971 animated television special]] and  [[The Cat in the Hat (film)|a 2003 live-action film]].

== Plot ==

The story begins as a girl named Sally and her brother, who serves as the narrator of the book, sit alone in their house on a cold, rainy day, staring wistfully out the window. Then they hear a loud bump which is quickly followed by the arrival of the Cat in the Hat, a tall anthropomorphic cat in a red and white striped hat and a red bow tie. The Cat proposes to entertain the children with some tricks that he knows. The children's pet fish refuses, insisting that the Cat should leave. The Cat responds by balancing the fish on the tip of his umbrella. The game quickly becomes increasingly trickier, as the Cat balances himself on a ball and tries to balance lots of household items on his limbs until he falls on his head, dropping everything he was holding. The fish admonishes him again, but the Cat in the Hat just proposes another game.

The Cat brings in a big red box from outside, from which he releases two identical creatures with blue hair and red suits called Thing One and Thing Two. The Things cause more trouble, such as flying kites in the house, knocking pictures off the wall and picking up the children's mother's new polka-dotted gown. All this comes to an end when the fish spots the children's mother out the window. In response, Sally's brother catches the Things in a net, and the Cat, apparently ashamed, stores them back in the big red box. He takes it out the front door as the fish and the children survey the mess he has made. But the Cat soon returns, riding a machine that picks everything up and cleans the house, delighting the fish and the children. The Cat then leaves just before their mother arrives, and the fish and the children are back where they started at the beginning of the story. As she steps in, the mother asks the children what they did while she was out, but the children are hesitant and do not answer. The story ends with the question, "What would ''you'' do if your mother asked ''you''?"

== Background ==
[[File:Johnhersey.jpg|right|thumb|An article by [[John Hersey]] about literacy in early childhood provided inspiration for ''The Cat in the Hat''.]]
Theodor Geisel, writing as Dr. Seuss, created ''The Cat in the Hat'' partly in response to the May 24, 1954, ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine article by [[John Hersey]] titled "Why Do Students Bog Down on First R? A Local Committee Sheds Light on a National Problem: Reading".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Brien|first=Anne|title=An Educational Innovation: The Cat in the Hat|url=http://www.learningfirst.org/educational-innovation-cat-hat|publisher=Learning First Alliance|accessdate=8 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102012917/http://www.learningfirst.org/educational-innovation-cat-hat|archive-date=2 November 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nel 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;29&lt;/ref&gt; In the article, Hersey was critical of school [[Primer (textbook)|primers]] like those featuring [[Dick and Jane]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the classroom boys and girls are confronted with books that have insipid illustrations depicting the slicked-up lives of other children... All feature abnormally courteous, unnaturally clean boys and girls.... In bookstores anyone can buy brighter, livelier books featuring strange and wonderful animals and children who behave naturally, i.e., sometimes misbehave... Given incentive from school boards, publishers could do as well with primers.&lt;ref&gt;Hersey 1954, pp. 136-137&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

After detailing many issues contributing to the dilemma connected with student reading levels, Hersey asked toward the end of the article:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Why should [school primers] not have pictures that widen rather than narrow the associative richness the children give to the words they illustrate—drawings like those of the wonderfully imaginative geniuses among children's illustrators, [[John Tenniel|Tenniel]], [[Howard Pyle]], "Dr. Seuss", [[Walt Disney]]?&lt;ref&gt;Hersey 1954, p.&amp;nbsp;148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This article caught the attention of William Spaulding, who had met Geisel during the war and who was then the director of Houghton Mifflin's education division.&lt;ref name="Morgan1"&gt;Morgan 1995, pp.&amp;nbsp;153-154&lt;/ref&gt; Spaulding had also read the best-selling 1955 book ''Why Johnny Can't Read'' by [[Rudolf Flesch]].&lt;ref&gt;Menander 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/ref&gt; Flesch, like Hersey, criticized primers as boring but also criticized them for teaching reading through [[word recognition]] rather than [[phonics]].&lt;ref name="Menand 2"&gt;Menand 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, Spaulding invited Geisel to dinner in Boston where he proposed that Geisel create a book "for six- and seven-year-olds who had already mastered the basic mechanics of reading".&lt;ref name="Morgan1"/&gt; He reportedly challenged, "Write me a story that first-graders can't put down!"&lt;ref name="Morgan1"/&gt;

At the back of ''Why Johnny Can't Read'', Flesch had included 72 lists of words that young children should be able to read, and Spaulding provided Geisel with a similar list.&lt;ref name="Menand 2"/&gt; Geisel later told biographers Judith and Neil Morgan that Spaulding had supplied him with a list of 348 words that every six-year-old should know and insisted that the book's vocabulary be limited to 225 words.&lt;ref name="Morgan1"/&gt; However, according to [[Philip Nel]], Geisel gave varying numbers in interviews from 1964 to 1969.&lt;ref name="Nel-background"/&gt; He variously claimed that he could use between 200 and 250 words from a list of between 300 and 400; the finished book contains 236 different words.&lt;ref name="Nel-background"&gt;Nel 2007, pp.&amp;nbsp;24-26&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==
Geisel gave varying accounts of how he conceived of ''The Cat in the Hat''. According to the story Geisel told most often, he was so frustrated with the word list that William Spaulding had given him that he finally decided to scan the list and create a story out of the first two words he found that rhymed. The words he found were ''cat'' and ''hat''.&lt;ref name="Nel-background"/&gt; 
Near the end of his life, Geisel told his biographers, Judith and Neil Morgan, that he conceived the beginnings of the story while he was with Spaulding, in an elevator in the Houghton Mifflin offices in Boston.&lt;ref name= "Morgan 153"&gt;Morgan 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;153&lt;/ref&gt; It was an old, shuddering elevator and was operated by a "small, stooped woman wearing 'a leather half-glove and a secret smile'".&lt;ref name= "Morgan 153"/&gt; [[Anita Silvey]], recounting a similar story, described the woman as "a very elegant, very petite African-American woman named Annie Williams".&lt;ref name="silvey"&gt;{{cite episode |title=How the Cat Got His Smile |date=March 1, 2007 |url=https://www.npr.org/player/v2/mediaPlayer.html?action=1&amp;t=1&amp;islist=false&amp;id=7651308&amp;m=7651309 |network=NPR |last=Silvey |first=Anita|series=Listen Morning Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geisel told Silvey that, when he sketched the Cat in the Hat, he thought of Williams and gave the character Williams' white gloves and "sly, even foxy smile".&lt;ref name="silvey"/&gt;

[[File:Everest North Face toward Base Camp Tibet Luca Galuzzi 2006.jpg|thumb|left|According to Geisel, one of the stories he pitched before ''The Cat in the Hat'' involved scaling [[Mount Everest]].]]
Geisel gave two conflicting, partly fictionalized accounts of the book's creation in two articles, "How Orlo Got His Book" in ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' and "My Hassle with the First Grade Language"  in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', both published on November 17, 1957.&lt;ref name="Nel-background"/&gt; In "My Hassle with the First Grade Language", he wrote about his proposal to a "distinguished schoolbook publisher" to write a book for young children about "scaling the peaks of Everest at 60 degrees below".&lt;ref name="Nel 171"/&gt; The publisher was intrigued but informed him that, because of the word list, "you can't use the word ''scaling''. You can't use the word ''peaks''. You can't use ''Everest''. You can't use ''60''. You can't use ''degrees''. You can't..."&lt;ref name="Nel 171"&gt;"My Hassle With the First Grade Language" 1957, p.&amp;nbsp;171&lt;/ref&gt; Geisel gave a similar account to Robert Cahn for an article in the July 6, 1957, edition of ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''.&lt;ref name="Nel-background"/&gt; In "My Hassle With the First Grade Language", he also told a story of the "three excruciatingly painful weeks" in which he worked on a story about a King Cat and a Queen Cat.&lt;ref&gt;"My Hassle With the First Grade Language" 1957, p.&amp;nbsp;173&lt;/ref&gt; However, "queen" was not on the word list, nor did his first grade nephew, Norval, recognize it. So Geisel returned to the work but could then think only of words that started with the letter "q", which did not appear in any word on the list. He then had a similar fascination with the letter "z", which also did not appear in any word on the list. When he did finally finish the book and showed it to his nephew, Norval had already graduated from the first grade and was learning calculus. Philip Nel notes, in his dissection of the article, that Norval was Geisel's invention. Geisel's niece, Peggy Owens, did have a son, but he was only a one-year-old when the article was published.&lt;ref&gt;"My Hassle With the First Grade Language" 1957, p.&amp;nbsp;170&lt;/ref&gt;

In "How Orlo Got His Book", he described Orlo, a fictional, archetypal young child who was turned off of reading by the poor selection of simple reading material.&lt;ref name="Nel 167"&gt;"How Orlo Got His Book" 1957, p.&amp;nbsp;167&lt;/ref&gt; To save Orlo the frustration, Geisel decided to write a book for children like Orlo but found the task "not dissimilar to... being lost with a witch in a tunnel of love".&lt;ref name="Nel 167"/&gt; He tried to write a story called "The Queen Zebra" but found that both words did not appear on the list. In fact, like Geisel wrote in "My Hassle with the First Grade Language", the letters "q" and "z" did not appear on the list at all. He then tried to write a story about a bird, without using the word ''bird'' as it did not appear on the list. He decided to call it a "wing thing" instead but struggled as he discovered that it "couldn't have ''legs'' or a ''beak'' or a ''tail''. Neither a ''left'' foot or a ''right'' foot."&lt;ref name="Nel 169"&gt;"How Orlo Got His Book" 1957, p.&amp;nbsp;169&lt;/ref&gt; On his approach to writing ''The Cat in the Hat'' he wrote, "The method I used is the same method you use when you sit down to make apple stroodle [sic] without stroodles."&lt;ref name="Nel 169"/&gt;

Geisel variously stated that the book took between nine and 18 months to create.&lt;ref&gt;Nel 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;30&lt;/ref&gt; Donald Pease notes that he worked on it primarily alone, unlike with previous books, which had been more collaborative efforts between Geisel and his wife, [[Helen Palmer Geisel|Helen]].&lt;ref&gt;Pease 2010, pp.&amp;nbsp;112&amp;ndash;115&lt;/ref&gt; This marked a general trend in his work and life. As [[Robert L. Bernstein]] later said of that period, "The more I saw of him, the more he liked being in that room and creating all by himself."&lt;ref name="Pease 114"&gt;Pease 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;114&lt;/ref&gt; Pease points to Helen's recovery from [[Guillain–Barré syndrome]], which she was diagnosed with in 1954, as the marker for this change.&lt;ref name="Pease 114"/&gt;

== Publication history ==
[[File:Bennettcerf.jpg|right|150px|thumb|[[Bennett Cerf]], the head of [[Random House]], negotiated a deal that allowed both Random House and Houghton Mifflin to publish versions of ''The Cat in the Hat''.]]
Geisel agreed to write ''The Cat in the Hat'' at the request of William Spaulding of Houghton Mifflin; however, because Geisel was under contract with Random House, the head of Random House, [[Bennett Cerf]], made a deal with Houghton Mifflin. Random House retained the rights to trade sales, which encompassed copies of the book sold at book stores, while Houghton Mifflin retained the education rights, which encompassed copies sold to schools.&lt;ref name="Morgan1"/&gt;

The Houghton Mifflin edition was released in January or February 1957, and the Random House edition was released on March 1.&lt;ref name=Neary&gt;{{cite web|last=Neary|first=Lynn|title=Fifty Years of 'The Cat in the Hat'|url=https://www.npr.org/2007/03/01/7651308/fifty-years-of-the-cat-in-the-hat#7649624|publisher=[[NPR]]|accessdate=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two editions featured different covers but were otherwise identical.&lt;ref name=Neary/&gt; The first edition can be identified by the "200/200" mark in the top right corner of the front dust jacket flap, signifying the $2.00 selling price. The price was reduced to $1.95 on later editions.&lt;ref&gt;Nel 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;20&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Judith and Neil Morgan, the book sold well immediately. The trade edition initially sold an average of 12,000 copies a month, a figure which rose rapidly.&lt;ref name="morgan bb"/&gt; [[Bullock's]] department store in Los Angeles, California, sold out of its first, 100-copy order of the book in a day and quickly reordered 250 more.&lt;ref name="morgan bb"/&gt; The Morgans attribute these sales numbers to "playground word-of-mouth", asserting that children heard about the book from their friends and nagged their parents to buy it for them.&lt;ref name="morgan bb"/&gt; However, Houghton Mifflin's school edition did not sell as well. As Geisel noted in Jonathan Cott's 1983 profile of him, "Houghton Mifflin... had trouble selling it to the schools; there were a lot of Dick and Jane devotees, and my book was considered too fresh and irreverent. But Bennett Cerf at Random House had asked for trade rights, and it just took off in the bookstores."&lt;ref name= "Cott 115"&gt;Cott 1983, p.&amp;nbsp;115&lt;/ref&gt; Geisel told the Morgans, "Parents understood better than school people the necessity for this kind of reader."&lt;ref name="morgan bb"/&gt;

After three years in print, ''The Cat in the Hat'' had sold nearly one million copies. By then, the book had been translated into French, Chinese, Swedish, and Braille.&lt;ref name="morgan bb"/&gt; In 2001, ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' placed it at number nine on its list of the best-selling children's books of all time.&lt;ref name="pw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA186995.html|title=All-Time Bestselling Children's Books|date= 17 December 2001|work=Publishers Weekly |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051225125934/http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA186995.html|archivedate=December 25, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2007, more than 10 million copies of ''The Cat in the Hat'' have been printed, and it has been translated into more than 12 different languages, including [[Latin]], under the title ''Cattus Petasatus''.&lt;ref name=horrigan&gt;{{cite web|last=Horrigan|first=Kevin|title=The Cat at 50: Still lots of good fun that is funny|url=http://www.jsonline.com/news/opinion/29362154.html|work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]|accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cattus petasatus: The cat in the hat in Latin|year=2000|publisher=Bolchazy-Carducci|isbn=9780865164710|pages=75|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dVVbAAAAMAAJ|author=Dr. Seuss |author2=Jennifer Morrish Tunberg |author3=[[Terence Tunberg]]|accessdate=29 November 2013|language=Latin}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, on the occasion of the book's fiftieth anniversary, Random House released ''The Annotated Cat:  Under the Hats of Seuss and His Cats'', which includes both ''The Cat in the Hat'' and its sequel, with annotations and an introduction by Philip Nel.&lt;ref name=Neary/&gt;

==Reception==
[[File:Ted Geisel NYWTS 2 crop.jpg|left|thumb|Geisel in 1957, holding a copy of ''The Cat in the Hat'']]
The book was published to immediate critical acclaim. Some reviewers praised the book as an exciting way to learn to read, particularly compared to the primers that it supplanted. Ellen Lewis Buell, in her review for ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'', noted the book's heavy use of one-syllable words and lively illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Buell|first=Ellen Lewis|title=High Jinks at Home|newspaper=[[The New York Times Book Review]]|date=17 March 1957 |postscript=, as quoted in Fensch 2001, pp.&amp;nbsp;124–125.}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote, "Beginning readers and parents who have been helping them through the dreary activities of Dick and Jane and other primer characters are due for a happy surprise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Buell|first=Ellen Lewis|title=High Jinks at Home|newspaper=[[The New York Times Book Review]]|date=17 March 1957 |postscript=, as quoted in Nel 2007, pp.&amp;nbsp;9–10.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Helen Adams Masten of the ''[[Saturday Review (U.S. magazine)|Saturday Review]]'' called the book Geisel's ''tour de force'' and wrote, "Parents and teachers will bless Mr. Geisel for this amusing reader with its ridiculous and lively drawings, for their children are going to have the exciting experience of learning that they ''can'' read after all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Masten|first=Helen Adams|title=The Cat in the Hat|newspaper=[[Saturday Review (U.S. magazine)|Saturday Review]]|date=11 May 1957 |postscript=, as quoted in Nel 2007, pp.&amp;nbsp;9–10.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polly Goodwin of the ''[[Chicago Tribune|Chicago Sunday Tribune]]'' predicted that ''The Cat in the Hat'' would cause seven- and eight-year-olds to "look with distinct distaste on the drab adventures of standard primer characters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goodwin|first=Polly|title=Hurray for Dr. Seuss!|newspaper=Chicago Sunday Tribune|date=12 May 1957|location=Chicago IL |postscript=, as quoted in Nel 2007, pp.&amp;nbsp;9–10.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Helen E. Walker of ''[[Library Journal]]'' and Emily Maxwell of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' felt that the book would appeal to older children as well as to its target audience of first- and second-graders.&lt;ref name="Nel-reviews"&gt;Nel 2007, pp.&amp;nbsp;9–10&lt;/ref&gt; The reviewer for ''The Bookmark'' concurred, writing, "Recommended enthusiastically as a picture book as well as a reader".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=Some Early Spring Books for Children and Young People|newspaper=The Bookmark|date=April 1957 |postscript=, as quoted in Fensch 2001, pp.&amp;nbsp;124–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Heloise P. Mailloux wrote in ''[[The Horn Book Magazine]]'', "This is a fine book for remedial purposes, but self-conscious children often refuse material if its seems meant for younger children."&lt;ref name="mailloux"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mailloux|first=Heloise P.|title=Late Spring Book List|newspaper=[[The Horn Book Magazine]]|date=June 1957 |postscript=, as quoted in Nel 2007, pp.&amp;nbsp;9–10.}}&lt;/ref&gt; She felt that the book's limited vocabulary kept it from reaching "the absurd excellence of early Seuss books".&lt;ref name="mailloux"/&gt;

Based on a 2007 online poll, the [[National Education Association]] named ''The Cat in the Hat'' one of its "Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children".&lt;ref name=NEA2007&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nea.org/grants/13154.htm/ |title= Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children |author= National Education Association |year= 2007|accessdate=August 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 it was ranked number 36 among the "Top 100 Picture Books" in a survey published by ''[[School Library Journal]]'' – the third of five Dr. Seuss books on the list.&lt;ref name=SLJPicture2012&gt;{{cite web |url= http://blog.schoollibraryjournal.com/afuse8production/2012/07/06/top-100-picture-books-poll-results |title= Top 100 Picture Books Poll Results |author= Bird, Elizabeth |publisher= ''A Fuse #8 Production''.

The book's fiftieth anniversary in 2007 prompted a reevaluation of the book from some critics. Yvonne Coppard, reviewing the fiftieth anniversary edition in ''Carousel'' magazine, wondered if the popularity of the Cat and his "delicious naughty behavior" will endure another fifty years. Coppard wrote, "The innocent ignorance of bygone days has given way to an all-embracing, almost paranoid awareness of child protection issues. And here we have the mysterious stranger who comes in, uninvited, while your mother is out."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coppard|first1=Yvonne|title=''The Cat in the Hat'' Review|journal=Carousel|date=Autumn 2007|issue=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
Philip Nel places the book's title character in the tradition of con artists in American art, including the title characters from [[Meredith Willson]]'s ''[[The Music Man]]'' and [[L. Frank Baum]]'s ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]''.&lt;ref name="nel-analysis"&gt;Nel 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;118-119&lt;/ref&gt; Nel also contends that Geisel identified with the Cat, pointing to a self portrait of Geisel in which he appears as the Cat, which was published alongside a profile about him in ''The Saturday Evening Post'' on July 6, 1957.&lt;ref name="nel-analysis"/&gt; [[Michael K. Frith]], who worked as Geisel's editor, concurs, arguing that "The Cat in the Hat and Ted Geisel were inseparable and the same. I think there's no question about it. This is someone who delighted in the chaos of life, who delighted in the seeming insanity of the world around him."&lt;ref name="nel-analysis"/&gt; Ruth MacDonald asserts that the Cat's primary goal in the book is to create fun for the children. The Cat calls it "fun that is funny", which MacDonald distinguishes from the ordinary, serious fun that parents subject their children to.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald 1986, pp.&amp;nbsp;110&amp;ndash;111&lt;/ref&gt; In an article titled "Was the Cat in the Hat Black?", Philip Nel draws connections between the Cat and stereotyped depictions of African-Americans, including [[minstrel shows]], Geisel's own minstrel-inspired cartoons from early in his career, and the use of the term "cat" to refer to jazz musicians.&lt;ref name="Cat-Black"/&gt; According to Nel, "Even as [Geisel] wrote books designed to challenge prejudice, he never fully shed the cultural assumptions he grew up with, and was likely unaware of the ways in which his visual imagination replicated the racial ideologies he consciously sought to reject."&lt;ref name="Cat-Black"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nel|first1=Philip|title=Was the Cat in the Hat Black?: Exploring Dr. Seuss’s Racial Imagination|journal=Children's Literature|date=2014|volume=42|issue=1|pages=71-98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cotton Mather.jpg|thumb|right|Geisel once called the fish in ''The Cat in the Hat'' "my version of [[Cotton Mather]]".]]
Geisel once called the fish "my version of [[Cotton Mather]]", the Puritan moralist who advised the prosecutors during the [[Salem witch trials]].&lt;ref name="nel 40"&gt;Nel 2007,&amp;nbsp;40&lt;/ref&gt; Betty Mensch and Alan Freeman support this view, writing, "Drawing on old Christian symbolism (the fish was an ancient sign of Christianity) Dr. Seuss portrays the fish as a kind of ever-nagging superego, the embodiment of utterly conventionalized morality."&lt;ref name="nel 40"/&gt; Philip Nel notes that other critics have also compared the fish to the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Super-ego|superego]]. Anna Quindlen called the Cat "pure id" and marked the children, as mediators between the Cat and the fish, as the ego.&lt;ref name="nel 40"/&gt; Mensch and Freeman, however, argue that the Cat shows elements of both id and ego.&lt;ref name="nel 40"/&gt;

In her analysis of the fish, MacDonald asserts that it represents the voice of the children's absent mother.&lt;ref name="macdonald-fish"&gt;MacDonald 1986, pp.&amp;nbsp;114&amp;ndash;115&lt;/ref&gt; Its conflict with the Cat, not only over the Cat's uninvited presence but also their inherent predator-prey relationship, provides the tension of the story. She points out that on the last page, while the children are hesitant to tell their mother about what happened in her absence, the fish gives a knowing look to the readers to assure them "that something did go on but that silence is the better part of valor in this case".&lt;ref name="macdonald-fish"/&gt; [[Alison Lurie]] agrees, writing, "there is a strong suggestion that they might not tell her."&lt;ref name="lurie"&gt;Lurie 1992, p.&amp;nbsp;70&lt;/ref&gt; She argues that, in the Cat's destruction of the house, "the kids&amp;mdash;and not only those in the story, but those who read it&amp;mdash;have vicariously given full rein to their destructive impulses without guilt or consequences."&lt;ref name="lurie"/&gt; For a 1983 article, Geisel told Jonathan Cott, "''The Cat in the Hat'' is a revolt against authority, but it's ameliorated by the fact that the Cat cleans up everything at the end. It's revolutionary in that it goes as far as [[Alexander Kerensky|Kerensky]] and then stops. It doesn't go quite as far as [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]]."&lt;ref&gt;Cott 1983, p.&amp;nbsp;117&lt;/ref&gt;

Donald Pease notes that ''The Cat in the Hat'' shares some structural similarities with other Dr. Seuss books. Like earlier books, ''The Cat in the Hat'' starts with "a child's feeling of discontent with his mundane circumstances" which is soon enhanced by make believe.&lt;ref name="Pease 103"&gt;Pease 2010, pp.&amp;nbsp;103&amp;ndash;105&lt;/ref&gt; The book starts in a factual, realistic world, which crosses over into the world of make believe with the loud bump that heralds the arrival of the Cat.&lt;ref name="Pease 103"/&gt; However, this is the first Dr. Seuss book in which the fantasy characters, i.e. the Cat and his companions, are not products of the children's imagination.&lt;ref name="Pease 103"/&gt; It also differs from previous books in that Sally and her brother actively participate in the fantasy world; they also have a changed opinion of the Cat and his world by the story's end.&lt;ref name="Pease 103"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Ruth MacDonald asserts, "''The Cat in the Hat'' is the book that made Dr. Seuss famous. Without ''The Cat'', Seuss would have remained a minor light in the history of children's literature."&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald 1988, p.&amp;nbsp;105&lt;/ref&gt; Donald Pease concurs, writing, "''The Cat in the Hat'' is the classic in the archive of Dr. Seuss stories for which it serves as a cornerstone and a linchpin. Before writing it Geisel was better known for the [[FLIT#"Quick, Henry, the Flit!"|'Quick, Henry, the Flit!']] ad campaign than for his nine children's books."&lt;ref name="pease-popularity"&gt;Pease 2010, pp.&amp;nbsp;111&amp;ndash;112&lt;/ref&gt; The publication and popularity of the book thrust Geisel into the center of the United States literacy debate, what Pease called "the most important academic controversy" of the [[Cold War]] era.&lt;ref name="pease-popularity"/&gt; Academic [[Louis Menand]] contends that "''The Cat in the Hat'' transformed the nature of primary education and the nature of children's books. It not only stood for the idea that reading ought to be taught by phonics; it also stood for the idea that language skills—and many other subjects—ought to be taught through illustrated storybooks, rather than primers and textbooks."&lt;ref&gt;Menand 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;3&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, Geisel told Jonathan Cott, "It is the book I'm proudest of because it had something to do with the death of the ''Dick and Jane'' primers."&lt;ref name = "Cott 115"/&gt;

[[File:WhiteHouseTheCatintheHat2003.jpg|left|300px|thumb|A ''Cat in the Hat'' Christmas decoration in the [[White House]], 2003]]

The book led directly to the creation of [[Beginner Books]], a publishing house centered on producing books like ''The Cat in the Hat'' for beginning readers.&lt;ref name="morgan bb"/&gt; According to Judith and Neil Morgan, when the book caught the attention of Phyllis Cerf, the wife of Geisel's publisher, [[Bennett Cerf]], she arranged for a meeting with Geisel, where the two agreed to create Beginner Books.&lt;ref name="morgan bb"&gt;Morgan 1995, pp.&amp;nbsp;156&amp;ndash;157&lt;/ref&gt; Geisel became the president and editor, and the Cat in the Hat served as their mascot. Geisel's wife, Helen, was made third partner. Random House served as distributor&lt;ref name="morgan bb"/&gt; until 1960, when Random House purchased Beginner Books.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;167&lt;/ref&gt; Geisel wrote multiple books for the series, including ''[[The Cat in the Hat Comes Back]]'' (1958), ''[[Green Eggs and Ham]]'' (1960), ''[[Hop on Pop]]'' (1963), and ''[[Fox in Socks]]'' (1965).&lt;ref name="first edition"&gt;{{cite web|title=First Edition Beginner Books|url=http://1stedition.net/beginnerbooks.html|publisher=1stedition.net|accessdate=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He initially used word lists of limited vocabularies to create these books, as he had with ''The Cat in the Hat'', but moved away from the lists as he came to believe "that a child could learn any amount of words if fed them slowly and if the books were amply illustrated".&lt;ref&gt;"Somebody's Got to Win" 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;126&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors also contributed notable books to the series, including ''A Fly Went By'' (1958), ''[[Sam and the Firefly]]'' (1958), ''[[Go, Dog. Go!]]'' (1961), and ''[[The Big Honey Hunt]]'' (1962).&lt;ref name="first edition"/&gt;

The book, or elements of it, has been mentioned multiple times in United States politics. The image of the Cat balancing many objects on his body while in turn balancing himself on a ball has been included in political cartoons and articles. Political caricaturists have portrayed both [[Bill Clinton]] and [[George W. Bush]] in this way.&lt;ref&gt;Nel 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;48&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, [[Mad (magazine)|''MAD'' magazine]] published "The Strange Similarities Between the Bush Administration and the World of Dr. Seuss", an article which matched quotes from White House officials to excerpts taken from Dr. Seuss books, and in which [[George W. Bush]]'s [[State of the Union]] promises were contrasted with the Cat vowing (in part), "I can hold up the cup and the milk and the cake!  I can hold up these books!  And the fish on a rake!"&lt;ref&gt;MAD Magazine #447, November 2004, Drucker/Devlin&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, during the [[110th United States Congress|110th Congress]], Senate Majority Leader [[Harry Reid]] compared the impasse over a bill to reform immigration with the mess created by the Cat. He read lines of the book from the Senate floor.&lt;ref name="Senate"&gt;{{cite news|title=Snubbing the White House, Without Snubbing the White House|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/07/AR2007060702206_2.html|author=Dana Milbank|date=June 8, 2007 | work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then carried forward his analogy hoping the impasse would be straightened out for "If you go back and read Dr. Seuss, the cat manages to clean up the mess."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Senate tries to cool immigration bill heat|author=Stephen Dinan|work=The Washington Times|date=June 6, 2007 |url=http://www.washtimes.com/national/20070606-123944-6924r.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, the [[United States Postal Service]] issued a stamp featuring the Cat in the Hat.&lt;ref&gt;Fensch 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;176&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Cat in the Hat''{{'}}s popularity also led to increased popularity and exposure for Geisel's previous children's books. For example, 1940's ''[[Horton Hatches the Egg]]'' had sold 5,801 copies in its opening year and 1,645 the following year. In 1958, the year after the publication of ''The Cat in the Hat'', 27,643 copies of ''Horton'' were sold, and by 1960 the book had sold a total of over 200,000 copies.&lt;ref name="pease-popularity"/&gt;

In 2012, following the financial success of ''[[The Lorax (film)|The Lorax]]'', the animated film adaptation of [[The Lorax|the Dr. Seuss book of the same name]], [[Universal Pictures]] and [[Illumination Entertainment]] announced plans to produce a CGI adaptation of the book.&lt;ref name="cartoon"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blog.bcdb.com/cat-hat-animated-feature-3528/ |title=The Cat In The Hat comes back as animated feature |first=Ethan |last=Minovitz |newspaper=Big Cartoon News |date=March 18, 2012 |accessdate=March 18, 2012 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121203093819/http://blog.bcdb.com/cat-hat-animated-feature-3528/ |archive-date=December 3, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rob Lieber was set to write the script, with [[Chris Meledandri]] as producer, and [[Audrey Geisel]] as the executive producer. However, the project never came into fruition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/new-cat-hat-movie-works-warner-bros-1077973|title=New 'Cat in the Hat' Movie in the Works From Warner Bros.|publisher=The Hollywood Reporter|date=January 24, 2018|last1=Kit|first1=Borys|accessdate=January 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On January 24, 2018, it was announced that [[Warner Animation Group]] was in development of an animated ''Cat in the Hat'' film as part of a creative partnership with Seuss Enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thewrap.com/cat-in-the-hat-animated-film-dr-seuss-franchise-warner-bros/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stage adaptation===
In 2009, the [[Royal National Theatre]] created a stage version of the book, adapted and directed by [[Katie Mitchell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Spencer|first=Charles|title=The Cat in the Hat at the National Theatre, review|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturecritics/6835238/The-Cat-in-the-Hat-at-the-National-Theatre-review.html|accessdate=27 November 2013|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=17 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Seussical]]'', a musical adaptation that incorporates aspects of many Dr. Seuss works, features the Cat in the Hat as narrator.&lt;ref name=connema&gt;{{cite web|last=Connema|first=Richard|title=Seussical is a Charming Musical|url=http://www.talkinbroadway.com/regional/sanfran/s808.html|publisher=Talkin Broadway|accessdate=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The musical received weak reviews when it opened, in November 2001, but eventually became a staple in regional and school theaters.&lt;ref name=connema/&gt; 

===Attraction===
A ride at Universal Studios' [[Islands of Adventure]] park in Orlando, Florida, has a ''Cat in the Hat'' theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orlandoinformer.com/universal/cat-in-the-hat/|title=Cat in the Hat at Universal's Islands of Adventure|work=Orlando Informer|accessdate=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Educational Software===
In 1997, The book was made into a [[Living Books]] adaption for the PC and then, there were similar differences to reflect the new media such as Conrad sings his lines at the subtitles of the story as the narrator in the rainy day.

'''The Economic Survey of the Book Industry''', known informally as '''The Cheney Report''', was a paper written by retired New York banker O.H. Cheney, between 1930 and 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JfEsX04jKuUC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=ted+striphas+late+age+of+print&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQ_rft_YvLAhVGeSYKHW9jAzYQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Late Age of Print|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was commissioned by the [[National Association of Book Publishers]], and later published in 1932. The purpose of the report was to analyze the overall structure of the book publishing industry and to find ways to improve the system as a whole. The report advocated for several revisions to the book publishing industry including standardization of the physical size of books, increasing the number of children reading books in the education system, and constructing more bookstores in more parts of the country in the United States. Cheney also correctly anticipated the increasing demand for more books at the end of the [[Second World War]], and sought to find ways to better distribute them.

The most important contribution of The Cheney Report to the market of American book publishing, and to American culture as a whole, was his insistence on the implementation of a standardized form of communication within the book publishing world. Cheney was the first person to suggest some kind of machine based coding system for the organization of books. While he did not present a specific plan for this machine based coding system in his report, Cheney’s revolutionary ideas helped spur the creation and implementation, several decades later, of the [[International Standard Book Number]] (ISBN) that the United States adopted to categorize books.

On the 60th anniversary of The Cheney Report in 1992, Publishers Weekly reprinted the report in full and began to revisit some of the ideas the report originally proposed.

==Reception==
While the ideas presented in the report later helped establish a system as effective as the ISBN, The Cheney Report was not well received at the time of publication. Cheney claimed to have written the report “in the spirit of objective sympathy”, but the report was mostly met with harsh criticism and considered wildly ineffective by most book industry insiders at the time. Many people felt the ideas he proposed were farfetched, while today the idea of a book coding system, like the ISBN, seems completely logical. One of The Cheney Report supporters did give an alternative reading of The Cheney Report in a 1932 edition of [[Publishers Weekly]]:

{{Quote|text="Mr. Cheney was not hired to tell us what fine fellows and wonderful men we are. We must have known something was wrong with us or we wouldn't have ordered any survey...Why spend valuable time now looking at what may be wrong with Mr. Cheney? It would be more profitable for each of us to dig out of the report the mass of useful and interesting information, new information, and the many useful and definite suggestions." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LxODZ0Q8-HcC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=whats+changed+since+cheney&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oWoduyhc01&amp;sig=TV9Xmw7YxNN1tvpT-RBui8vJ06o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjtzb_L84vLAhXLQCYKHZmvAEsQ6AEIMDAD#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Rise of Corporate Publishing and Its Effects on Authorship in Early ...|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;|character=[[Alfred A. Knopf, Sr.]]|author=[[Publishers Weekly]]|source=January 16th, 1932}}

Almost none of the ideas presented in the report were taken seriously, and it was not until much later in American history that the machine based coding system was invented and implemented. Cheney did not gain much notoriety from this report and the report has largely gone unnoticed in current American culture. Cheney died in 1939 and never got to see his ideas and concepts implemented.

Ten years after the death of their son, a divorced couple is suddenly reunited by supernatural events that offer them a chance at forgiveness.

== Plot ==
The movie opens with a couple preparing for a wedding at their home. Mark and Elizabeth already have a son, Jacob. After eight years they make the relationship official, exchange wedding vows, and enjoy a day long reception with family and friends. Time flashes to the future with the couple divorced after the son was killed in an automobile accident. The father was driving and the mother thinks she failed to secure the boy's seat belt. Each blame the other parent and yet themselves for the tragic death.

Mark is an attorney busy working at a large law firm. Elizabeth has remarried, wrote a book and lives in an expensive home with her step-daughters.  Mark is bothered with tenants who abandoned the rented former marital home. Marks inspects the home where lights flicker and he hears strange noises.  He hears footsteps and he finds Jacob's toys in the attic. He sees Jacob and passes out. After time and adjustment, Mark accepts Jacob's ghost as real. After Jacob asks Dad about Mommy. Mark brings Elizabeth to the home.  She sees her son and thinks Mark has played some cruel trick on her. She learns to accept reality and is happy the boy is back in their lives. Neither parent can touch the boy.

Mark quits his job to make time to be with Jacob. Elizabeth visits the house each day.  Jacob tells his parents he wants things back to normal including the couple back together loving one another. They all do things to make up for lost opportunities. Mom reads bedtime stories and Dad plays games.  Jacob wants that real train set that he never got. The couple become close again.  They learn that Jacob can leave the house so they go to the beach and build sand castles and watch a beautiful sunset.

Jacob tells Dad that he pushed the red button that released the seat belt. Jacob caused his own death and Dad should not feel guilty and he should forgive Mom.  Elizabeth has been having nose bleeds and passed out after claiming to see her deceased mother.  After an emergency room visit, Elizabeth tells Mark she stopped her depression medicine and the fainting was isolated and nothing to worry about.  When Dad gets home, Jacob has his train set up and fully running.  Jacob tells Dad that Mom has to take a long train ride with him.  Mark confronts Elizabeth and she tells him she has terminal cancer.  Mark tells her that Jacob told him that he unlatched the seat belt and she was not at fault.  Later, Jacob comes to his Mom's hospital room and she hugs him and they both disappear into a white light.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4685">'''Verdadism''' is the word created by artist, designer and writer, [[Soraida Martinez]], to describe her art.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rowanmagazine.com/assets/pdfs/1995/mastersofarts.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The word is a combination of the Spanish word for truth (Verdad) and the English suffix for theory (ism). This contemporary art style, created in 1992, juxtaposes figurative abstract paintings with written social commentaries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.camdencountywoman.com/articles/187/1/Outstanding-Woman--Soraida-Martinez/Page1.html&lt;/ref&gt; The technique used is mixed media, with oil or acrylic on canvas paintings with written social commentaries. The commentaries are based on the artist's personal life experiences or observations and address issues affecting American society from the late 20th century to the present. Racism, sexism, stereotyping, abortion, feminism, alienation, ethnocentrism and relationships are common themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Soraida's Verdadism : The Intellectual Voice of a Puerto Rican Woman on Canvas; Unique, Controversial Images and Style|last = Martinez|first = Soraida|publisher = Soraida|year = 1999|isbn = 978-0967671901|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soraida Martinez==
An American artist of Puerto Rican heritage, Soraida Martinez was born in 1956 in [[Harlem, New York City]] to Puerto Rican parents who came to the United States during the [[Puerto Rican migration to New York City]] starting in the 1950s. The [[civil rights movement]], [[feminism]] and the social upheavals of the late 1960s to early 1970s were instrumental in shaping the artist's socially conscious philosophy. The first Verdadism exhibition, Soraida's Verdadism: The Intellectual Voice of A Puerto Rican Woman on Canvas; Unique, Controversial Images and Style, was held in 1994 at the Walt Whitman Cultural Arts Center in [[Camden, New Jersey]] - considered one of the poorest cities in the U.S., with one of the highest crime rates.

==Elements of Verdadism==
Verdadism consists of two distinct, integral, parts: the visual component and the written commentary. The visual style was influenced by [[American Abstract Expressionism]], [[Fauvist]] principles, elements of [[Surrealism]] and [[West African sculpture]]. The visual components include purposeful simplification of form and structure, broad areas of flat, primary colors and geometric shapes, and abstract human figures with blocks for hands or elongated shapes for bodies. The artist's written commentaries are influenced by the tenets of [[Existentialist]] philosophy. These social commentaries contribute to an understanding of the Verdadism painting by describing the emotions, situations, and experiences that became the impetus for creating the work-of-art. The written commentary is an essential aspect of Verdadism and denotes a literary expression of the artist's feelings towards a particular subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;http://soraida.com/definition.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 

The visual style of Verdadism is influenced by [[American Abstract Expressionism]], [[Fauvist]] principles, elements of [[Surrealism]] and [[West African sculpture]]. The social commentaries are influenced by the principles of [[civil rights]] and [[human rights]] in the US, including the [[Feminist Movement]] and the social political activism of the [[Young Lords]].

==Purpose==
The primary purpose behind the paintings is to precipitate social change, to promote an understanding of humanity and to teach tolerance and the self-empowerment of the individual. In Verdadism, the intent of the artist is to make a personal connection with the viewer through the act of involving the viewer in an actual experience in the artist's life. The viewer is encouraged to acknowledge the universality of human nature and the artist invites the viewer to open their mind to the concept that we are all human beings with shared common experiences.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48491">{{Culture of Vietnam}}
'''Vietnamese art'''  is [[visual art]] that, whether ancient or modern, originated in or is practiced in Vietnam or by Vietnamese artists.

==Introduction==
Vietnamese art has a long and rich history, the earliest examples of which date back as far as the [[Stone Age]] around 8,000 [[BCE]] &lt;ref name="vietnamese art artists history"&gt;{{cite web|publisher= widewalls|title=vietnamese art artists history|url= https://www.widewalls.ch/vietnamese-art-artists-history/    }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

With the millennium of [[History of Vietnam|Chinese domination]] starting in the 2nd century BC, Vietnamese art undoubtedly absorbed many Chinese influences, which would continue even following independence from China in the 10th century AD.  However, Vietnamese art has always retained many distinctively Vietnamese characteristics.

By the 19th century, the influence of [[French art]] took hold in Vietnam, having a large hand in the birth of modern Vietnamese art.

==Vietnamese art throughout the ages==

===Neolithic art===
[[File:Gom1.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Terracotta pieces used to imprint decoration patterns on cloth]]
Pottery dating to the [[Stone Age]] [[(c. 8000 BCE)]] has been found in Bac Son, Vietnam.  This pottery was made from clay, and in its beginnings was largely basic and lacking any artistic flare.  Moving into the neolithic era, however, [[Vietnamese pottery]] and ceramics started to develop rapidly, showing signs of decor.

===Bronze Age art===

The highly developed [[Đông Sơn culture]] that flourished in [[North Vietnam]] (from about 1000 BC to the 4th century BC) was the civilization responsible for the world-famous [[Đông Sơn drums]], a product of their advanced bronze-casting skills.

These drums give us an important peek into early Vietnamese life.  They were elaborately decorated with [[geometric patterns]], and most importantly, depicted scenes of everyday life such as farming, warriors donning feather headdresses, construction of ships, musicians, etc.

Archaeological evidence from this period also shows that people in the area had long been weaving cloth.  Many of the people depicted on the drums are shown as wearing elaborate clothing.

===Chinese domination from 111 BC to 939 AD===
During the ten centuries of rule by the Chinese, Vietnamese began to apply newly learned Chinese techniques to art and specifically ceramics, however this was in conjunction with the continued production of art based on native methods; this is proven by excavation of Chinese tombs in the area.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vietnamartbooks.com/articles/article.html?id=67 Pottery and ceramics during Chinese rule&lt;/ref&gt;

===From the Ngô to Trần Dynasty===

Vietnamese art and ceramics during this period of independence (approximately 10th to 15th centuries) flourished.  The ceramics from this period were thought to have been largely influenced by both ancient native styles and the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] and later [[Song Dynasty]]'s art, including applying the "three colors" concept to its ceramics.  Chinese-influenced philosophies adopted by the Vietnamese such as [[Confucianism]], [[Mahayana Buddhism]] and [[Taoism]] all had a lasting impression on Vietnamese art. Some also claim there are small traces of [[Art of Champa|Cham]] influences to be found as well.

The [[Lý Dynasty]], beginning in the 11th century is viewed specifically as the golden age of Vietnamese art, and its ceramics became famous across East and Southeast Asia.  The Lý Dynasty also saw the construction of many of Vietnam's landmark structures, including the [[Temple of Literature, Hanoi|Temple of Literature]], One-pillar pagoda, and Quynh Lam pagoda.  The [[Trần Dynasty]] that immediately followed in the 13th century saw a more subdued approach to art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://english.vietnamnet.vn/lifestyle/2005/10/501151/ |title=VietNamNet Bridge&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2007-04-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504205207/http://english.vietnamnet.vn/lifestyle/2005/10/501151/ |archive-date=2007-05-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fourth Chinese domination and Lê Dynasty===
[[File:DoGo.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Pieces of wooden art from 17th and 18th century]]
The [[fourth Chinese domination of Vietnam]] was quite short-lived, lasting only about 2 decades, yet it was also seen as the harshest domination.  Many if not most classical Vietnamese books were burnt, and thus much documentation of the era of independence lost.  It is said that a more extreme than-ever process of [[sinicization]] was enforced, and countless Vietnamese resources and goods were removed and taken to China.

Consequently, much of the art in this period and even after liberation by the [[Lê Dynasty]] was heavily influenced by the [[Ming Dynasty]]'s art.

====Nguyễn Dynasty====
The [[Nguyễn Dynasty]], the last ruling dynasty of Vietnam, saw a renewed interest in ceramics and porcelain art.  Imperial courts across Asia imported Vietnamese ceramics.

Despite how highly developed the performing arts (such as imperial court music and dance) became during the Nguyễn Dynasty, some view other fields of arts as beginning to decline during the latter part of the Nguyễn Dynasty.

==Modern art==
Vietnam Modern Art includes artistic work materialized during colonial period between 1860s to 1970s, and significantly ascribed to the founding of “[[École Supérieure des Beaux-Arts de L'Indochine|Ecole Supérieure des Beaux-Arts de l'Indochine]]” in October 1925.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Viet Nam Plastic and Visual Arts from 1925 to Our Time|last=|first=|publisher=|year=1998|isbn=|location=Esapce Méridien|pages=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before 1925, paintings and carvings were mainly created for religious purpose, in a decorative manner for example lacquered furniture and utilitarian ceramic and porcelains, subordinated to demands by the local temples and pagodas use.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A striking “shift” was obvious after the founding of [[Ecole des Beaux-Arts de l'Indochine|Ecole des Beaux-Arts de l'Indohine]] EBAI, observing a gradual change in perception of art, and the beginning recognition of art for art’s sake.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essays on Modern and Contemporary Vietnamese Art|last=|first=|publisher=Singapore Art Museum for Symposium on modern and contemporary Vietnamese art|year=2008|isbn=|location=Singapore|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vietnamese artists experimented with new ways of seeing, with ideas from 2 important French teachers, it marks an intensifying [[Cultural transformation theory|cultural transfer]] and [[modernity]].  

=== The Colonial Period 1925 - 1945 ===
[[File:Xã-Xệ et Lý-Toét.jpg|thumb|An cartoon illustrated in Phong Hoa|alt=|left]]
[[Ecole des Beaux-Arts de l'Indochine|Ecole des Beaux-Arts de l'Indohine]] EBAI was founder by [[Victor Tardieu]], a French academic and naturalist painter.&lt;ref&gt;ibid, p5&lt;/ref&gt; With a report commission sent to the general Government of Indochina, Victor Tardieu recommended setting up a school “EBAI in Indochina” to train real artists.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vietnam Plastic and Visual Art from 1925 to Our Time|last=|first=|publisher=Espace Méridien|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike, Ecole professionnelle” in Hanoi, “Ecole des Arts Cambodgeins”  and other three schools set up in Cochinchina between 1902 – 1913 these schools were professional schools to train craftsmen.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Tardieu’s idea was to adapt exiting curriculum used in “Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris” by including art history; technical course like oil painting and perspective, to train student into real artist.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He planned to “help the Vietnamese artist to get back in touch with the deep meaning and fundamental inspiration of their own traditions”.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vietnam Plastic and Visual Arts from 1925 to Our Time|last=|first=|publisher=Espace Méridien|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ngay Nay (Nowadays) Phong Hoa (mores) which was associated with Tu Luc Vaan Doan (Self Reliance Literary Association), were committed to modernising Vietnamese culture through the crucial assessment of both Vietnam's tradition and Western modernity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A City that remembers in the making of modern vietnam|last=Nguyen|first=Van Ky|publisher=|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;Students in the EBAI were columnist in this 2 weekly magazines, illustrating cartoons and exhibition information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essays on Modern and Contemporary Vietnamese Art|last=Scott|first=Phoebe|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stylized cartoon illustration were in fact very modern, depicting simple messages.

===== Oil Painting =====
[[File:Hai thieu nu va em be.JPG|thumb|To Ngoc Van, Deux Jeunes filles et un enfants, 1944, oil on canvas, Museum of Fine Arts, Hanoi|alt=|270x270px]]
Following closely to the curriculum of [[École des Beaux-Arts de Paris|Ecole des Beaux-Arts de Paris]], oil painting was first introduced to students as a completely new medium.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essays on Modern and Contemporary Vietnamese Art|last=|first=|publisher=Singapore Art Museum for symposium on modern and contemporary Vietnamese art|year=2008|isbn=|location=Singapore|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although western art, in this case, oil painting, was likely first encountered by Le Van Mien (1873-1943) in L’Ecole Nationale Superieure des Beaux- Arts de Paris, who returned to Hanoi in 1895, no record shows that he taught and trained craftsman in Bien Hoa or Gia Dinh this western medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Post Dôi Mói Vietnamese Art After 1990|last=|first=|publisher=Singapore Art Museum for the exhibition Post-Doi Moi: Vietnamese Art after 1990|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This medium was thoroughly unknown to the students, and [[Joseph Inguimberty]] though it would be hard to assimilate the oil painting techniques to them.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 
Artist like [[Tô Ngọc Vân|To Ngoc Van]] was able to combine western aesthetic techniques like linear perspective, imitation of nature and modelling in the round into his own oriental traditions with oil medium.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Stylized as the ‘poetic reality’ style, his works sets female ideals into a linear perspective in an enclosed space, juxtapositioned with flat coloured area, his works emulates with the tendency idealization imagery.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===== En Plein Air =====

Similarly, en plein air was another major practice instituted in EBAI’s curriculum.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essays on Modern and Contemporary Vietnamese Art|last=|first=|publisher=Singapore Art Museum for symposium on modern and contemporary Vietnamese art|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Students were brought outdoor for field trips to develop their painting sense of the environment. As noted by art historian Nora Taylor, &lt;blockquote&gt;“[He … propped his easel under a tree by rice paddy, took off his shirt and proceeded to sketch farmers planting their rice seedlings. Needless to say he earned quite a few giggles and embarrassed glances from his subjects.’ Nobody took off their shirts in public, not even the farmers in the fields. The French did and so did [[Tô Ngọc Vân|To Ngoc Van]].”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Nora|date=1997|title=The Artist and the state|url=|journal=The Politics of painting and National Identity in Hanoi, Vietnam 1925 - 1999|volume=|pages=50|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;This example quoted by Taylor, argues that the tendency of idealization, we see in To Nga Van’s painting reflects a distancing and detachment with the subject matter, a result of artist’s attempt to emulate their French teachers inclusive of whatever they do.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
Other than oil medium and en plein air painting method, significant assimilation and adaption of local culture were encouraged by [[Victor Tardieu]] and his successor [[Joseph Inguimberty|Joseph Imguimberty]]. 

==== Lacquer Painting ====
[[File:Confucius - Temple of Literature, Hanoi - DSC04635.JPG|thumb|Interior of Temple of Literature|alt=|left]]
[[File:Confucius - Temple of Literature, Hanoi - DSC04600.JPG|thumb|The wares placed on altar were lacquered wares that inspired Joseph Imguimberty to plan a workshop for lacquer painting the studenst in EBAI|alt=]]
[[Joseph Inguimberty|Joseph Imguimberty]] was fascinated by the lacquered cultural objects and architecture fixtures after visiting the [[Temple of Literature, Hanoi|Temple of Literature]] in Hanoi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Post Dôi Mói Vietnamese Art After 1990|last=|first=|publisher=Singapore Art Museum for the exhibition Post-Doi Moi: Vietnamese Art after 1990|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He encouraged his students to start using lacquer as a fine art medium, and set up workshops in EBAI with old artisans, playing an renaissance role in Lacquer painting. &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;“falling back on the past will be efficient only if it is used as a starting point for a new research, for an evolution in line with the contemporary eras; to summarise, the question is to evolve as contemporaries within an extensive of tradition.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vietnam Plastic and Visual Arts from 1925 to Out Time|last=|first=|publisher=Espace Méridien|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;''[[Victor Tardieu]]''&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[File:Nguyen Gia Tri Women in the Garden.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|303.993x303.993px|Lacquer painting by Nguyen Gia Tri shows distinctive french influence of "romantic realism" style, yet a blend of localized culture iconography within the work]]
Making lacquer painting takes several months, using resin from Son tree taken from the plantation from [[Sơn mài|Son Mai]] region, numerous layers of application are applied to acquire the desired colour and effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Post Dôi Mói Vietnamese Art After 1990|last=|first=|publisher=Singapore Art Museum for the exhibition Post-Doi Moi: Vietnamese Art after 1990|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most notable artist who excelled in this medium is [[Nguyễn Gia Trí|Nguyen Gia Tri]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Although artists like [[Trần Quang Trân|Tran Quang Tran]], [[Lê Phổ|Le Pho]], Phan Hau, [[Nguyễn Khang (painter)|Nguyen Khang]] and Nguyen Van Que attempted lacquer painting, [[Nguyễn Gia Trí|Nguyen Gia Tri]]'s achievement in lacquer painting is remarkable for his research on pigments and exploration of new lacquer colours.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essays on Modern and Contemporary Vietnamese Art|last=|first=|publisher=Singapore Art Museum for symposium on modern and contemporary Vietnamese art|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nguyen Gia Tri's aim “ was to obtain the same level of painting as with the oil medium regarding perspective, modelling in the round, and infinite variation of colours”.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 

==== Silk Painting ====
[[File:Le Pho Maternity.jpg|thumb|Le Pho silk painting styled closely similar to a classic "Madonna nursing baby" triangle composition]]
Other artists like [[Nguyễn Phan Chánh|Nguyen Phanh Chanh]], [[Lê Phổ|Le Pho]], [[Mai Thứ|Mai Trung Thu]], [[Trần Văn Cẩn|Tan Van Can]], [[Lê Văn Đệ|Le Van De]],  who were the first batch of students to be admitted in EBAI, are most notable for their silk painting.&lt;ref&gt;ibid, pg 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Like lacquer painting, silk painting was much encouraged for exploration in the school. Different from similar practice of silk painting in China and Japan, an intensifying of cultural transfer was observed in Vietnamese silk painting, artist like [[Nguyễn Phan Chánh|Nguyen Phan Chan]] blended western composition principle with eastern tradition like calligraphy and brush paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vietnam Plastic and Visual Arts from 1925 to Our Time|last=|first=|publisher=Espace Méridien|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Choi o an quan-Nguyen Phan Chanh.jpg|left|thumb|269.983x269.983px|Choi o an quan (Mandarin square) Children Playing a Game of Squares]]
In 1931, Paris International Colonial Exhibition, [[Nguyễn Phan Chánh|Nguyen Phan Chan]]’s work titled ''Children Playing a Game of Squares'' was well-received and this recognition firmly established the medium as a modern Vietnamese expression.

Between 1930 – 1936, Nguyen Phan Chan, Le Pho, Mai Trung Thu and Nguyen Gia Tri, graduated from EBAI. Victor Tardieu passed away in 1937 and he was took after by [[Évariste Jonchère|Evariste Jonchere]]. [[Tô Ngọc Vân|To Ngoc Van]] begin teaching in EBAI in 1937. Artists like Bui Xuan Phai and Nguyen Tu Nghiem who entered EBAI in 1941 was unable to complete the full five-year programme due to the 1945 revolution.

A bombing of Hanoi that was intended for Japanese target destroyed part of the EBAI painting department in 1943, resulting the sculpture department to be moved to Son Tay; Architecture and sculpture department to Dalat while applied arts went to Phu Ly.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Post Dôi Mói Vietnamese Art After 1990|last=|first=|publisher=Singapore Art Museum for the exhibition Post-Doi Moi: Vietnamese Art after 1990|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Time of Resistance wars 1945 - 1975 ===
Resistance war uproar marks the official close down of EBAI in 1945. Democratic Republic of Vietnam reopened a fine arts school in Hanoi for a short period of time in September 1945 ruled by To Ngoc Van. However, artist were sympathetic of the Viet Minh and decided to leave Hanoi to join the resistance movement against French in the Hills of [[Northwest (Vietnam)|Tay Bac]]. &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; 

==== Artists in the North ====
Notable group of artists in the North during the Cold War were [[Tô Ngọc Vân]], [[Trần Văn Cẩn]], Huỳnh Phương Đong, Phạm Thanh Tâm, Minh Tuyen, Hoang Trung.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cfa.nus.edu.sg/calendar/19-wwrw|title="Who Wants To Remember A War?"

When Ho Chi Minh declared Vietnam’s independence in 2 September 1945,  Vietnamese artist begin to resist the influence of romantic realism, tendency for nostalgia past and melancholic dreams. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vietnam Plastic and Visual Arts from 1925 to Our Time|last=|first=|publisher=Espace Méridien|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artist like [[Tô Ngọc Vân|To Ngoc Van]] shook off his romantic style and turned towards modern realism, he moved the closed EBAI (after the Japanese coup de force in March 1945) to Viet Bac in 1950, the military base of the Revolutionary Army under Ho Chi Minh.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essays on Modern and Contemporary Vietnamese Art|last=|first=|publisher=Singapore Art Museum for symposium on modern and contemporary Vietnamese art|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“[He]… decided that art, as the French saw it, died in 1945 when Viet Nam declared its independence and was reborn in 1946 when the Viet Minh moved the art school to the hills of Viet Bac, the seat of the revolutionary movement. In 1946, He declared proudly ‘tradition starts now.’” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Nora|date=1997|title=The Artist and the State|url=|journal=The Politics of Painting and National Identity in Hanoi, Vietnam 1925 - 75|volume=|pages=84|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Hình ảnh Tô Ngọc Vân vẽ về cuộc di tản.jpg|thumb|To Ngoc Van's painting style changed drastically away from the usual ideal women he painted before the resistance war.]]
[[Tô Ngọc Vân|To Ngoc Van]] begin teaching resistance art classes in the Northern zone during the war with the French. This includes setting up the "School of Fine Arts in the Resistance Zone", and combating against decadent art being scientific, national and popular,  art have to abandon religion, mythical and idealists theme, focusing solely on the inspiration and needs of the revolution and being appealing and educational to a majority of people.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Hence artists like Nguyen Hiem, [[Nguyễn Sáng|Nguyen Sang]], Phan Van Don and [[Trần Văn Cẩn|Tran Van Can]] created works that depicted the countrysides, portraits of peasants, soldiers battles scenes, they uphold the belief that artist should show the reality of society instead of idealised imageries.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
[[Tô Ngọc Vân|To Ngoc Van]] died in 1954 as the result of injuries received at the [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu]], School of Fine Arts in the Resistance Zone was later moved to Hanoi in 1955 and named as the “Vietnam College of Fine Arts” with [[Trần Văn Cẩn|Tran Van Can]] as the principal.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

[[File:Gap Nhau by Mai Van Hien.jpg|left|thumb|302.986x302.986px|'''Mai Van Hien, Meeting (Gap Nhau), gouache on paper, 1954''']]
First National Art Exhibition in the Democratic Republic of Vietna in 1955, after the victory at [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu|Dien Bein Phu]] where Meeting (Gap Nhau) by [[Mai Van Hien]] was praised as the ideal painting that illustrates the idea of community and solidarity between the soldiers and the common people.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; "The mood of the painting is reflected in the artist’s simple descriptive style, which lends itself well to its content."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Nora|date=December 2011|title=Framing the National Spirit – Viewing and Reviewing Painting under the Revolution|url=|journal=http://www.vxartnews.com/2011/12/framing-the-national-spirit-viewing-and-reviewing-painting-under-the-revolution-part-2/|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In a Painting Exhibition that in happened December 10, 1951, Ho Chi Minh sent a message to the artists that  "you, in the artistic field, have your own responsibilities - to serve the resistance, the Fatherland and the people, first and foremost the workers, peasants and soldiers,"&lt;ref&gt;Ho Chi Minh, “Message sent to the artists on the occasion of the 1951 Paintings Exhibition (December 10, 1951)”, Selected Works of Ho Chi Minh Vol. 3, Publisher: Foreign Languages Publishing House. Reproduced on &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/ho-chi-minh/works/1951/12/10.htm&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;However, various debates erupted in Hanoi on the role of artists in Society in 1956, during the first meeting of the writers and artist associations, members demanded for greater freedom of expression which went against what Ho Chi Minh had earlier laid down. Two art and literature journals Nhan Van (humanism) and Gia Pham (Art Works) that supported the argument were subsequently banned. &lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Following year, [[Vietnam Association of Fine Arts in Hanoi]] or National Arts Association was established with 108 member headed by Thai Ba Van. These members were required to be members of the association if they wished their works to be exhibited or sold. There were no private galleries where artists can displayed their work formally. Eventually, this association was governed with official rules and regulations, members are obligated to hold one exhibition at local level annually and another at national level every 5 years. Non members were not considered artist, hence they have no opportunity to display any form of art publicly.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Between 1950 to 70s, members were paid as “art workers” for the poster designs and illustrations, among few were elites who painted paintings for state visitors. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essays on Modern and Contemporary Vietnamese Art|last=|first=|publisher=Singapore Art Museum for symposium on modern and contemporary Vietnamese art|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Realist style, which corresponded with Northern artists initial aspirations, was vital in the early days of revolution, however, due to the strict constraints by the DVR regime and decreasing subsidies, realist trend reached an apex in the 60s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vietnam Plastic and Visual Arts from 1925 to Our Time|last=|first=|publisher=Espace Méridien|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strict guidelines were attempted to established in 1962, on the productions of artists artworks, they need to portray a "National Character", subject matters were usually the countryside, battle scene, portrait of Uncle Ho.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

==== National Paintings ====
Anti-colonial and resistance war culminated the appropriation of “national” art. It was a period to essentially erase the impact and influence of the French. Works painted by [[Nam Sơn|Nam Son]], Tran Van Can, Nguyen Sang, Tran Dong Luon were in fact in the medium Lacquer, silk and oil medium. The 3 media, encouraged and culturally transferred by the French during colonial period were renamed as “national”.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;
[[File:Tran Van Can - Painting 2.jpg|thumb]]
[[File:Female Militia in the Sea Tran Van Can.jpg|left|thumb|Female Militia in the Sea 1960 Tran Van Can]]
In [[Trần Văn Cẩn|Tran Van Can]]’s Portrait painting “''Militia women of a costal region''”, the artist depicted a robust figure and confronting gaze, she is a comrade ready to face the enemy. It is a politically correct painting, filled with characteristic that fulfills the national painting.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Another theme commonly captured by artist was the landscape around Viet Bac. In the [[Diệp Minh Châu|Diep Minh Chau]]’s “Uncle Ho’s House in Viet Bac” show clear proficiency with the medium oil painting, the impressionist strokes of capturing the light through filtering leaves. 

In [[Duong Huong Minh]]’s “Hauling Up Canons” a work on lacquer captures dramatic scene of soldiers hauling heavy weapons up a steep slope. The bravery of the men eventually brought the Viet Minh their victory against the French in Bien Dien Phu.
[[File:Approaching Khe Sanh Pham Thanh Tam.jpg|left|thumb|Approaching Khe Sanh. A watercolour completed by Pham Thanh Tam in December 1967]]
Similarly, in watercolour painting painted by [[Pham Thanh Tam]] during resistance war ‘shows a clear French influence. His professors in the resistance zone were trained from the EBAI” the drawings and diary clearly contents “lyrical and poetic quality” it was regarded as ideal paintings.&lt;sup&gt;[21]&lt;/sup&gt;  

Hence, art curator Joyce Fan argues that “the realist techniques thus imparted by the French continue to manifest in the paintings with the sense of detachment and distancing, unlike the social realist use of emotive values to heighten the pathos in the imagery.”&lt;sup&gt;[22]&lt;/sup&gt; Likewise, the undeniable fact that, the intense cultural transfer during colonial period continues to influence local artist after the exit of the French. 

==== '''Propaganda Posters''' ====
[[File:South Vietnam propaganda poster.jpg|thumb|poster that depict the countryside]]
Propaganda poster painted during the period of “operation rolling thunder” in 1965 reflects a clear anti-colonial and anti-imperial messages. Likely inspired by the Soviet and Communist Chinese, they carried a political intention. Following strictly to the culture of new Vietnam in Ho Chi Minh’s concept, was to "stimulate intellectual and artistic creativity for art and cultural development".&lt;sup&gt;[23]&lt;/sup&gt;

“Culture is seen as a powerful motor of development, and cultural identity as a constant in the harmonious development of society and the individual.” &lt;sup&gt;[24]&lt;/sup&gt;

"images such as those presented in the propaganda posters and paintings of the time were key indicators of how the population was to perceive the environment, the government, and the future. the posters and paintings were sometimes the only voices the people heard, the only clues they had to knowing and how to respond."&lt;sup&gt;[25]&lt;/sup&gt;

==== '''Artists in the South''' ====
Vietnam was divided at the 17 parallel after the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference]] in 1954 separating themselves into the Soviet and Chinese supported North against the Southern Republic reinforced by the United Stated of America. This divided Vietnam forced some artists to fled to Saigon and continue their practices in the republic of Vietnam, most notable artist is [[Tạ Tỵ|Ta Ty]], who " considerably bolstered the South’s artistic development in the following years and profoundly contributed to the foundation of the Young Artists Association in 1966, though he chose to remain anonymous in its list of founding members due to privacy reasons."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://artradarjournal.com/2015/10/09/5-artists-to-know-from-the-vietnamese-young-artists-association/|title=5 artists to know from the Vietnamese Young Artists Association|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nguyen Gia Tri decided to move to Gia Dinh and eventually became the director for “[[Ecole des beaux-art in Gia Dinh]]" founded in 1954.&lt;sup&gt;[26]&lt;/sup&gt; Evident in their works, due to accessibility of information, their artworks were styled as western influenced, more eclectic, experimental, subjective and individualism. They enjoyed more freedom in the subject matters and exhibited freely until 1975.&lt;sup&gt;[27]&lt;/sup&gt;

In 1962, the first international Exhibition of Fine Arts of Saigon was held with 21 countries participating it. Southern artist encountered abstract painting for the first time. Following up, a second exhibition was planned for 1966, but unfortunately cancelled due to the increase intensity of the war. In 1966, Saigon Society of Young Artist (Hoi Hoa Si Tre Saigon) was founded campaigning to develop modern art, members include Nguyen Trung and Trinh Cung.&lt;sup&gt;[14]&lt;/sup&gt;

Between 1960s - 70s artists in Saigon experimented abstraction and other contemporary expressions. As noted by Vietnamese art historian Hyunh-Beattie, Southern artists did not readily accepted and took in American culture, which they deem as inferior to the French. Although Americans were heavily involved in Saigon, Beattie argues that little had influenced on the art scene in republic.

After the [[Reunification Day|reunification of Vietnam]], southern artists were sent for re-education in 1975.&lt;sup&gt;[14]&lt;/sup&gt; 

1976, Hanoi government merged Ho Chi Minh city and Gia Dinh National School for decorative Arts and the Saigon College of Fine Arts into Ho Chi Minh City Fine Arts College, and established Ho Chi Minh City branch of The Vietnam Association of Fine Arts.&lt;sup&gt;[14]&lt;/sup&gt;

=== '''The Period of Renewal from 1985''' ===
Artists benefited greater freedom of expression after the launch of Doi Moi Campaign. The establishment of open market allowed artist a greater outlet of creative expressions. &lt;sup&gt;[14]&lt;/sup&gt; 

However, Nguyen Quan who was elected into the executive committee of Vietnam Association of Fine Arts and holding position as the chief editor of the Association's Magazine My Thuat (Fine Arts) was removed from his position after organizing a workshop with 30 artist in Dai Lai, North of Hanoi in 1986.&lt;sup&gt;[28]&lt;/sup&gt; The workshop was not acceptable by authority for "the retreat not only promoted individual expression and art for art's sake, it also went against what the state had instituted over the past three decades in that it allowed for artists to explore their individuality rather than represent that collective sentiments of their community."&lt;sup&gt;[29]&lt;/sup&gt;

==Contemporary Art==
Nowadays, besides working with traditional material like oil, acrylic, lacquer on wood, the younger generation of Vietnamese artists have become very active in involving different forms of arts, such as installation, performance and video art with many of them attaining international recognition for their artworks and exhibitions worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;http://hyperallergic.com/181080/in-vietnam-contemplating-the-future-of-contemporary-art/&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Nha San Collective]] (formerly Nha San Studio) - established in 1998,  was the first artist-led, non-profit initiative to be run in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;http://theculturetrip.com/asia/vietnam/articles/the-most-influential-contemporary-art-spaces-in-vietnam/&lt;/ref&gt; Nha San studio nurtured the first generation of Vietnamese avant-garde artists emergent in the early 1990s

==Architecture==
It is believed that in prehistoric times, Vietnamese people lived in stilt-houses, as depicted on the bronze Dong Son drums.  Similar kinds of houses can still be found in Vietnam today.

When Chinese influence permeated Vietnam, [[Chinese architecture]] had a large influence on the basic structure of many types of Vietnamese buildings, mostly pagodas and temples, communal houses, houses of [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|scholar-bureaucrats]], aristocracy, and imperial palaces and quarters.  Nevertheless, these structures combined both Chinese influences and native style.
With French colonization of Vietnam in the 19th century, many French-styled buildings were constructed, including villas, government buildings, opera houses, etc.  Many of these buildings still stand in Vietnam and are one of the clearest remnants of the [[French Indochina|French colonial legacy]].

Some of Vietnam's most notable architectural structures include:

*The [[Temple of Literature, Hanoi|Temple of Literature]] or (Văn Miếu): Located in [[Hanoi]], [[North Vietnam]].  It was constructed during the [[Lý Dynasty]] and dedicated to [[Confucius]] and his disciples.  It is a fine example of the elegance of Lý Dynasty architecture, although much if it is in need of repair.  The Temple of Literature is a series of courtyards, buildings and pavilions, the center of which houses the famed stone [[stele]]s.  These steles are placed on top of [[bixi (tortoise)|stone turtles]], and are inscribed with the names of doctorate candidates successful at the [[Imperial examination]].  Also within the temple lies the "Quốc Tử Giám" or National University, which functioned for approximately 700 years, from 1076 to 1779.
*[[Imperial City, Huế]]: During the reign of the [[Nguyễn Dynasty]], a new imperial citadel in [[Huế]] was built, largely based on the Chinese [[Forbidden City]] in [[Beijing]], and also called the [[Imperial City, Huế|Purple forbidden city]].  However, it still employed many obviously Vietnamese characteristics in its design.  Other imperial structures built much later, such as the outlying tomb of [[Khải Định]], used French architectural elements as well.  The tomb of [[Minh Mạng]] is often considered one of the most beautiful structures in the Huế area, situated near a vast lotus pond, its construction was not completed until after Minh Mạng's death.

The citadel formerly sprawled a vast estate, but during subsequent wars and conflicts, much of it has been destroyed and later turned into [[rice paddy|rice paddies]].  The remaining areas are currently being restored by [[UNESCO]].

*[[One Pillar Pagoda]]: The one pillar pagoda is one of the most ancient structures of [[Hanoi]], its design credited to Emperor Lý Thái Tổ.  The story goes that the emperor had longed for a son, and one day dreamed that the Goddess of Mercy was sitting on a lotus flower offering him a son. In grattitude and reverence of his dream he ordered construction of a small pagoda in the form of a lotus, overlooking a pond. The pagoda has been rebuilt countlessly due to it being destroyed and burnt in wars by opponents.
*[[Perfume Pagoda]] and the surrounding area:  The Perfume pagoda is an ancient structure in Ha Tay province, located specifically in Perfume mountain, and is the site for a yearly festival attended by hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese.  Most people reach the pagoda by taking an hour boat ride across the scenic river (passing the countryside scattered with smaller pagodas) before reaching the Perfume Pagoda itself.  Inside are a series of temples and structures, and a grotto with stairs leading to two paths: "Heaven's gate" and "Hell's gate".  Descending deep into the grotto one finds the Inner temple.

The beauty of the Perfume Pagoda and surrounding area have served as the subject in many Vietnamese poems.

==Calligraphy==
{{main|Vietnamese calligraphy}}
Calligraphy has had a long history in Vietnam, previously using [[Chinese characters]] along with [[chữ nôm]].  However, most modern Vietnamese calligraphy instead uses the Roman-character based [[quốc ngữ]], which has proven to be very popular.

In the past, with literacy in the old character-based writing systems of Vietnam being restricted to scholars and elites, calligraphy nevertheless still played an important part in Vietnamese life.  On special occasions such as the [[Tết|Lunar New Year]], people would go to the village teacher or scholar to make them a calligraphy hanging (often poetry, folk sayings or even single words).  People who could not read or write also often commissioned scholars to write prayers which they would burn at [[temple]] shrines.

==Visual arts==

===Silk painting===
[[File:Nguyen Trai.jpg|thumb|190px|left|The [[silk painting]] of [[Nguyễn Trãi]] (15th century)]]
Vietnamese [[silk painting]] is one of the most popular forms of art in Vietnam, favored for the mystical atmosphere that can be achieved with the medium.  During the 19th and 20th centuries, French influence was absorbed into Vietnamese art and the liberal and modern use of color especially began to differentiate Vietnamese silk paintings from their Chinese, Japanese and Korean counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asia-art.net/vietnam_silk.html Art of Vietnam&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Vietnamese silk paintings typically showcase the countryside, landscapes, pagodas, historical events or scenes of daily life.

===Woodblock prints===
[[File:Dong Ho painting - Ly Ngu vong nguyet.jpg|thumb|160px|right|Typical [[Vietnamese woodblock prints|Đông Hồ folk woodblock print]] of a carp]]
A folk art with a long history in Vietnam, [[Vietnamese woodblock prints]] have reached a level of popularity outside of Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, Andrew, and Henley, David: ''Vietnam Past and Present: The North'' (History and culture of Hanoi and Tonkin). Chiang Mai. Cognoscenti Books, 2012. ASIN: B006DCCM9Q.&lt;/ref&gt;  Organic materials are used to make the paint, which is used on wood and pressed on paper.  The process is repeated with different colors.

===Photography===
{{See also|Photography in Vietnam}}
Photographic technology was introduced to Vietnam in the mid 19th century by French and Chinese commercial photographers.&lt;ref name="NDP"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nguyen |first1=Duc Hiep |last2=Takata |first2=Ellen |title=Photography in Vietnam from the End of the Nineteenth Century to the Start of the Twentieth |journal=Trans Asia Photography Review |date=2014 |volume=4 |issue=2 |page=1-35 |url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/spo.7977573.0004.204 |accessdate=15 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its introduction a diverse range of photography practices have emerged such as [[fine art photography]], [[documentary photography]], and [[landscape photography]]. The development of such practices have been accelerated following [[Đổi Mới]], that has resulted in a diversification of funding for artists and increased international exposure.&lt;ref name="Zhuang"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zhuang |first1=Wubin |title="Vietnam" in Photography in Southeast Asia: A Survey |date=2016 |publisher=National University of Singapore Press |location=Singapore |isbn=978-981-4722-12-4 |page=271-313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performing arts==

===Traditional music===
{{main|Music of Vietnam}}
Traditional Vietnamese music is extremely diverse, consisting of many different styles varying from region to region.  Some of the most widely known genres include:

*[[Quan họ]]: A type of improvisational music, it is sung a cappella and has a longstanding tradition in Vietnam, used in courtship rituals.
*Imperial Court music:  Music performed in the Vietnamese court during feudalistic times.  When referring specifically to the "[[Nhã nhạc]]" form it includes court music from the [[Trần Dynasty]] on to the [[Nguyễn Dynasty]].  It features an array of instruments, featuring musicians and dancers adorned in elaborate garb.
*[[Ca trù]]: An ancient form of [[chamber music]] which originated in the imperial court.  It gradually came to be associated with a [[geisha]]-type of entertainment where talented female musicians entertained rich and powerful men, often scholars and [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|bureaucrats]] who most enjoyed the genre.  It was condemned in the 20th century by the government, being tied falsely with [[prostitution]], but recently it has seen a revival as appreciation for its cultural significance has grown.  Vietnam has completed documents to have Ca tru recognized by [[UNESCO]] as a potential [[Intangible Cultural Heritage]].

===Traditional theatre===
[[File:Gánh hát Nam Định trong lễ Tứ tuần Đại khánh của Hoàng đế Khải Định (1924).jpg|thumb|300px|Tuong theatre actors.]]
Genres include:
*[[Cải lương]]: A kind of modern folk opera originating in [[South Vietnam]], which utilizes extensive [[vibrato]] techniques.  It remains very popular in modern Vietnam when compared to other folk styles.
*[[Hát chèo]]: The most mainstream of theatre/music forms in the past, enjoyed widely by the public rather than the more obscure Ca trù which was favored more by scholars and elites.
*Hát tuồng (also known as Hát bội): A theatre form strongly influenced by [[Chinese opera]], it transitioned from being entertainment for the royal court to travelling troupes who performed for commoners and peasants, featuring many well-known [[stock characters]].

===Traditional dance===
{{main|Traditional Vietnamese dance}}
Vietnam has 54 different ethnics, each with their own traditional dance.  Among the ethnic Vietnamese majority, there are several traditional dances performed widely at festivals and other special occasions, such as the [[lion dance]].

In the imperial court there also developed throughout the centuries a series of complex court dances which require great skill. Some of the more widely known are the imperial lantern dance, fan dance, and platter dance, among others.

===Water puppetry===
[[File:Thang Long Water Puppet Theatre2.JPG|thumb|Water puppetry theatre in Hanoi]]
[[Water puppetry]] is a distinct Vietnamese art which had its origins in the 12th century. In water puppetry, a split-bamboo screen obscures puppets which stand in water and are manipulated using long poles hidden beneath the water.  Epic storylines are played out with many different characters, often depicting traditional scenes of Vietnamese life.  Despite nearly dying out in the 20th century, it has been saved by efforts of preservation and is now largely seen by tourists to Vietnam.

==Language arts==

===Literature===
{{main|Vietnamese literature}}
'''Vietnamese literature''' is [[literature]], both oral and written, created largely by [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese-speaking]] people, although Francophone Vietnamese and English-speaking Vietnamese authors in Australia and the United States are counted by many critics as part of the national tradition.  For much of its history, Vietnam was dominated by China and as a result much of the written work during this period was in [[Classical Chinese]].  [[Chữ nôm]], created around the 10th century, allowed writers to compose in Vietnamese using modified Chinese characters. Although regarded as inferior to Chinese, it gradually grew in prestige.  It flourished in the 18th century when many notable Vietnamese writers and poets composed their works in ''chữ nôm'' and when it briefly became the official written script.  While the [[quốc ngữ]] script was created in the 17th century, it did not become popular outside of missionary groups until the early 20th century, when the French colonial administration mandated its use in [[French Indochina]].  By the mid-20th century, virtually all Vietnamese works of literature were composed in ''quốc ngữ''.

Some defining works of literature include ''[[The Tale of Kieu]]'' by [[Nguyễn Du]], and ''[[Lục Vân Tiên]]'' by [[Nguyễn Đình Chiểu]].

===Poetry===
Poet [[Hồ Xuân Hương]] (born during the end of the 18th century) composed much of her poetry in [[Chữ Nôm]], and most of it has been translated into [[quốc ngữ]] for modern Vietnamese.  Her poetry continues to be widely popular.  Other poets such as the famous [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|Mandarin official]] [[Duong Khue]] had some of his poetry adapted into songs that are still famous today, such as the [[Ca trù]]-genre song "Hồng hồng, tuyết tuyết".

Many Vietnamese poems, along with folk "literature" in general, tends to be much more of an oral tradition - as literacy (as it is defined today) in the past was restricted mostly to scholars and the elite.

'''''Woodstock Mural''''' is a [[mural]] designed by artist Mike Lawrence, painted on the west side of the [[New Seasons Market]] store in the [[Woodstock, Portland, Oregon|Woodstock]] neighborhood of [[Portland, Oregon]], in the United States. The painting has three sections, each representing a theme: commerce, education, and the outdoors. It depicts figures adorned with symbolism related to characters in [[Greek mythology]], including [[Hermes]], [[Athena]], and [[Demeter]], along with local businesses and local landmarks such as the neighborhood [[farmers' market]], [[Grand Central Bakery]], Portland Fish Market, [[Woodstock Park (Portland, Oregon)|Woodstock Park]], and the [[Woodstock Library]].

The Woodstock Neighborhood Association (WNA) originally made plans for a mural on the exterior wall of [[Lutz Tavern]]. Following an outreach effort to identify an artist, Lawrence and WNA met for a brainstorming session, during which they agreed on theme's for the proposed public artwork. Even after some funding was secured, efforts stalled. The association later proposed a mural for the nearby Red Fox Vintage building.

The original mural was completed on the Red Fox Vintage building by Heidi Schultz in November 2013. However, shortly after its completion, New Seasons announced the construction of a new grocery store next to the mural. The company offered to reproduce the painting on the east side of an adjacent building or the west side of the planned building. Dan Cohen and his assistant were hired to reproduce the mural, which was completed in October 2015.

According to the [[Regional Arts &amp; Culture Council]] (RACC), each section includes a central figure adorned with symbolism associated with [[Greek mythology]], representing one of three themes: commerce, education, and the outdoors.&lt;ref name=RACC&gt;{{cite web|title=New mural for the Woodstock Neighborhood|url=http://www.racc.org/public-art/new-mural-woodstock-neighborhood|publisher=Regional Arts &amp; Culture Council|accessdate=November 7, 2015|date=December 5, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117022813/http://www.racc.org/public-art/new-mural-woodstock-neighborhood|archive-date=November 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Portland Tribune]]'' described the mural as "rich in latent symbolism with more mysterious content", referring to the mythological symbolism in particular.&lt;ref name=Finally&gt;{{cite news|last=MacKinnon|first=Merry|title=Woodstock finally gets its neighborhood mural on the boulevard|url=http://portlandtribune.com/sb/75-features/204786-woodstock-finally-gets-its-neighborhood-mural-on-the-boulevard|accessdate=November 7, 2015|work=[[Portland Tribune]]|publisher=[[Pamplin Media Group]]|date=December 22, 2013|oclc=46708462}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original painting measured {{Convert|54|ft|m}} x {{Convert|15|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=Finally/&gt; In 2015, the mural was reproduced on another wall following construction of an adjacent new building housing a [[New Seasons Market]]; the new building hid the original mural. The "imposing" reproduction, as described by ''The Bee'', a community newspaper, measures {{Convert|52|ft|m}} x {{Convert|15|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=Bee&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gross|first1=Elizabeth Ussher|title=Mural, covered by New Seasons Market, reappears as promised|url=http://www.readthebee.com/businesswantads.html|accessdate=November 7, 2015|work=The Bee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commerce, represented on the left side, is depicted by a shopkeeper wearing a hat with the wings of [[Hermes]], the Greek god of commerce (or, according to some sources, [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], the Roman god of commerce).&lt;ref name=RACC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Finally/&gt; The business owner is bearded and wears a [[crocus]] flower in his apron. He has a tattoo of the [[caduceus]], the staff carried by [[Hermes Trismegistus]] in [[Egyptian mythology]] and Hermes in Greek mythology.&lt;ref name=RACC/&gt; In his store is a shelf with other symbolic items that represent local businesses.&lt;ref name=Bee/&gt;

The center section is devoted to education and depicts [[Athena]], the Greek goddess of wisdom, in the form of a girl in the [[Woodstock Library]].&lt;ref name=RACC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Finally/&gt; She is adorned with an owl on her shoulder and an [[olive branch]] necklace. She holds a tiger lily in her hand. [[Woodstock School (Portland, Oregon)|Woodstock School]]'s Mandarin Immersion Program is honored with an arc of [[Chinese characters]] above the girl's head, written on a chalkboard. The [[Mandarin Chinese]] text translates to "A nice place to live"&lt;ref name=Bee/&gt; or "It's a great place to live", which is Woodstock's motto.&lt;ref name=RACC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Finally/&gt; According to ''The Bee'', the central section also represents other neighborhood schools and the neighborhood's close proximity to [[Reed College]].&lt;ref name=Bee/&gt;

The mural's right section depicts [[Demeter]], the Greek goddess of the harvest, in the form of an Asian female urban farmer at the neighborhood [[farmers' market]]. She wears [[Poppy (flower)|poppies]] in her headdress, giving the appearance of a crown, and has a tattoo of a [[Sheaf (agriculture)|sheaf]] of wheat. Next to her is a [[cornucopia]], which symbolizes abundance and nourishment. She holds a lotus staff, described as a "flaming torch".&lt;ref name=RACC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Finally/&gt; The figure also represents "the love of gardening". [[Douglas fir]] trees and [[Woodstock Park (Portland, Oregon)|Woodstock Park]], specifically its off-leash dog area, are also depicted in the painting's right section.&lt;ref name=Bee/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Lutz Tavern (2014) - 1.jpg|thumb|left|The mural was originally planned for the exterior wall of [[Lutz Tavern]].]]

The Woodstock Neighborhood Association (WNA) originally made plans to paint a community mural on the east exterior of [[Lutz Tavern]].&lt;ref name=Finally/&gt; Following an outreach effort to locate an artist, WNA and Lawrence held a brainstorming session. Kenny Heggem, who served as the project manager of the mural committee,&lt;ref name=Bee/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Outreach &amp; Communications|url=http://woodstockpdx.org/committees/communications/|publisher=Woodstock Neighborhood Association|accessdate=November 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; recalled, "We talked about our fantastic park and its leash-free dog area, Woodstock Elementary's Mandarin Immersion Program, and our awesome library."&lt;ref name=Bee/&gt; The session resulted in the group's choosing the mural's three themes.&lt;ref name=Bee/&gt;

In August 2012, RACC confirmed funding of $6,000 for the {{Convert|60|ft|m|adj=on}} x {{Convert|15|ft|m|adj=on}} painting. The mural's design was divided into three parts to accommodate the exterior wall's three sections. RACC published an image of Lawrence's proposed mural and said the goal of the project was to "highlight the best of the neighborhood and instill a sense of community pride".&lt;ref name=Six&gt;{{cite web|title=Portland will add six new public art murals to its collection this summer|url=https://racc.org/2012/08/10/portland-will-add-six-new-public-art-murals-to-its-collection-this-summer/|publisher=Regional Arts &amp; Culture Council|accessdate=November 7, 2015|date=August 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agency also said the project was still raising funds and hoped to start in the spring of 2013.&lt;ref name=Six/&gt; Efforts stalled, but WNA later proposed a mural with a different design for the east side of the Red Fox Vintage building, located at the intersection of Southeast 46th Avenue and Southeast Woodstock Boulevard.&lt;ref name=Finally/&gt;

According to the ''[[Portland Tribune]]'', the project was a collaboration between local businesses, institutions, and neighborhood residents. Beaver State Scaffolding and [[Sherwin-Williams]] both contributed resources to the project.&lt;ref name=Finally/&gt; RACC awarded partial grant funding through its Public Art Murals Program, which is funded by the City of Portland and "provides funding for community murals that reflect diversity in style and media and encourages artists from diverse backgrounds and range of experience to apply".&lt;ref name=RACC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Six/&gt; WNA volunteers also assisted, led by Heggem and Becky Luening, head of the neighborhood association.&lt;ref name=Finally/&gt;&lt;ref name=Binder&gt;{{cite news|last=Binder|first=Melissa|title=New Seasons in Woodstock: Neighborhood mural will be replicated, traffic guided by audible, visual signals (Q&amp;A)|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2014/03/new_seasons_in_woodstock_updat.html|accessdate=November 7, 2015|work=[[The Oregonian]]|publisher=[[Advance Publications]]|issn=8750-1317|date=March 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heidi Schultz of Schultz Art &amp; Design served as the project's production manager.&lt;ref name=RACC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Finally/&gt; She created a pattern against the wall using Lawrence's digital design, then mixed the paint, completed the mural, and added a clear coating for protection.&lt;ref name=Finally/&gt; Painting the mural took about six weeks, and it was mostly finished by November 2013.&lt;ref name=RACC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Finally/&gt; Red Fox Vintage hosted a party to celebrate the work's completion on December 14.&lt;ref name=Finally/&gt; The mural took nearly two years to plan and complete, which was longer than expected.&lt;ref name=RACC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Binder/&gt;

===Reproduction===
[[File:Woodstock Mural (covered), 2015.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The original mural covered by new construction]]

Not long after the mural's completion, New Seasons Market announced plans to build a new store immediately adjacent to the mural.&lt;ref name=Binder/&gt; In January 2014, the co-owner of Red Fox Vintage, said, "We're going to have a sit-down with New Seasons about the mural. To the best of my knowledge, New Seasons will make it right."&lt;ref name=Official&gt;{{cite news|last1=MacKinnon|first1=Merry|title=Finally official: New Seasons IS coming to Woodstock|url=http://pamplinmedia.com/sb/75-features/209044-66200-finally-official-new-seasons-is-coming-to-woodstock|accessdate=November 7, 2015|work=The Bee|date=January 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She shared three options to discuss with the company: repainting the mural on Red Fox's east wall, transferring it to the new store's exterior wall, or keeping the original mural in place and making it visible from the grocery store's interior.&lt;ref name=Official/&gt;

New Seasons met with WNA and offered to reproduce the painting, either on the east side of the Red Fox Vintage building or the west side of the planned grocery store.&lt;ref name=Binder/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Binder|first1=Melissa|title=New Seasons Woodstock|url=http://photos.oregonlive.com/oregonian/2014/03/new_seasons_woodstock.html|accessdate=November 7, 2015|work=The Oregonian|date=March 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luening said the latter option was more practical, because the artist could paint on panels in her studio instead of working outside.&lt;ref name=Binder/&gt; New Seasons hired Dan Cohen of Dan Cohen Creative Labs to duplicate the mural using a method similar to one he uses in his work as a "mega mural" painter. He said of the process: &lt;blockquote&gt;I paint giant advertising murals all over the country. I do about one mural a month. We create the pattern using the original image, and paint on top of it. We use a special machine [to create the underlying design] that works like an arc welder.&lt;ref name=Bee/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During construction of the new building and the mural's transfer, New Seasons displayed a banner which read, "The mural will return".&lt;ref name=Ashton&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ashton|first1=David F.|title=Woodstock's New Seasons to open October 21|url=http://portlandtribune.com/sb/75-features/275290-150504-woodstocks-new-seasons-to-open-october-21|accessdate=November 7, 2015|work=The Bee|date=October 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cohen and his assistant, Christo Wunderlich, transferred the design using a machine, then painted the art by hand. The duo also added bread and a fish to the mural to represent the local businesses [[Grand Central Bakery]] and Portland Fish Market, respectively.&lt;ref name=Bee/&gt; The new store opened in October 2015.&lt;ref name=Ashton/&gt;

'''Yaddo''' is an [[artists' community]] located on a {{convert|400|acre|ha|adj=on}} estate in [[Saratoga Springs, New York]].  Its mission is "to nurture the creative process by providing an opportunity for artists to work without interruption in a supportive environment."&lt;ref name = "History"&gt;{{Citation | url = http://yaddo.org/yaddo/history.shtml | title = Yaddo | contribution = History}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On March&amp;nbsp;11, 2013 it was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doi.gov/news/pressreleases/americas-great-outdoors-secretary-salazar-director-jarvis-designate-13-new-national-historic-landmarks.cfm|title=New Sites Recognize More Complete Story of America, including Significant Latino, African American and Indian Sites|publisher=US Department of the interior|accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It offers residencies to artists working in choreography, film, literature, musical composition, painting, performance art, photography, printmaking, sculpture, and video. Collectively, artists who have worked at Yaddo have won 66 [[Pulitzer Prizes]], 27 [[MacArthur Fellowships]], 61 [[National Book Awards]], 24 [[National Book Critics Circle Award]]s, 108 [[Rome Prize]]s, 49 [[Whiting Writers' Award]]s, a Nobel Prize ([[Saul Bellow]], who won the Pulitzer Prize in Fiction and [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1976), and countless other honors.&lt;ref name = "History" /&gt; Yaddo is included in the [[Union Avenue Historic District (Saratoga Springs, New York)|Union Avenue Historic District]].

==History==
The estate was purchased in 1881 by the financier [[Spencer Trask]] and his wife, the writer [[Katrina Trask]]. The first mansion on the property burned down in 1893, and the Trasks then built the current house.  Yaddo is a [[neologism]] invented by one of the Trask children and was meant to rhyme with "shadow".&lt;ref name="YaddoSubstance"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,760139,00.html |title= Yaddo and Substance |work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date= September 5, 1938 | quote= Creating at Yaddo last week, at mid-season of the colony's twelfth year &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;1938&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, was a typical group of writers and artists who have given substance to Katrina's vision. But whether or not they fit her romantic conception was an open question. By contrast with aristocratic Katrina and the elegant surroundings she provided, most of the season's 27 guests stood out in striking left-wing contrast: Poet [[Kenneth Fearing]] ''(Angel Arms, Poems),''  Critic [[Newton Arvin]] ''(Hawthorne),''  Novelists [[Joseph Vogel (writer)|Joseph Vogel]] ''(At Madame Bonnard's),''  [[Leonard Ehrlich]] ''(God's Angry Man),''  [[Henry Roth]] ''(Call It Sleep),''  [[Daniel Fuchs]] ''(Low Company).'' &lt;br /&gt; "One of the show places of the U.S., Yaddo is a {{convert|500|acre|km2|adj=on}} estate with pine groves, vast lawns, artificial lakes with ducks, famous rose gardens, and white marble fountains. The name Yaddo was a baby pronunciation given by the Trask children (all four of whom died in childhood) to The Shadows, a famous [[Public house#Inns|inn]] formerly on the site of the Trask estate, where the Trasks had spent their summers. It was one of the dozen places where [[Edgar Allan Poe|Poe]] was supposed to have written ''[[The Raven]]'', and Katrina said it inspired her own poetry. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artists' colony===
In 1900, after the premature deaths of the Trasks' four children,&lt;ref name= "YaddoSubstance"/&gt; Spencer Trask decided to turn the estate into an artists' retreat as a gift to his wife.  He did this with the financial assistance of philanthropist [[George Foster Peabody]].  The first artists arrived in 1926. The success of Yaddo encouraged Spencer and Katrina later to donate land for a working women's retreat center as well, known as [[Wiawaka Holiday House]], at the request of Mary Wiltsie Fuller.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.wiawaka.org/history.html | title = History | publisher = Wiawaka | accessdate = June 9, 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949 during the [[McCarthy Era]], a news story accurately accused writer [[Agnes Smedley]] of spying for the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Price, ''The Lives of Agnes Smedley'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), 5-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Smedley had traveled with [[Mao Zedong]] to report on the Chinese Communist Revolution and, beginning in 1943, had spent five years at Yaddo. Poet [[Robert Lowell]] pushed the Board of Directors to oust Yaddo's director, Elizabeth Ames, who was being questioned by the [[FBI]].  Ames was eventually exonerated of all charges but learned from the investigation that her assistant Mary Townsend was an FBI informant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://exhibitions.nypl.org/exhibits/yaddo/contention/3 | title = The Lowell Affair: Yaddo's Red Scare | publisher = NYPL}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.poetryfoundation.org/journal/feature.html?id=178893 | title = Deeply and mysteriously implicated | first = Carla | last = Blumenkranz | publisher = Poetry Foundation}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ames remained director until her retirement in 1969, having overseen the Yaddo community from its creation in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;"Elizabeth Ames, Creator of Yaddo, Upstate Cultural Haven, Dies at 92," ''New York Times'', March 30, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; Ames was succeeded by Newman E. Waite who served as president from 1969 until 1977 when Curtis Harnack assumed the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://archives.nypl.org/mss/4795 | title = Guide to the Yaddo records| publisher = NYPL}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Literary critic and eventual Yaddo board member [[Louis Kronenberger]] wrote in his memoir that to call Yaddo "a mixture of some of the most attractive, enjoyable, generous-minded people and of others who were weird, megalomaniac, intransigent, pugnacious is only to say that it has housed and nourished most of the finest talents in the arts of the past forty-odd years—the immensely fruitful years of Elizabeth Ames's directorship."&lt;ref&gt;Louis Kronenberger, ''No Whippings, No Gold Watches'' (Boston: Little Brown, 1970), 269.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In literature ===
The retreat was the partial setting of [[Jonathan Ames]]' book ''Wake Up Sir!'' (2004).

Entering its second century, Yaddo accepts contributions to its endowment and underwriting for specific projects to ensure that the artists' community will always be a place of inspiration.

[[File:YaddoPergola.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Pergola]] in Yaddo's gardens, photographed c. 1900–20]]
Yaddo's gardens are modeled after the classical Italian gardens the Trasks had visited in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.yaddo.org/yaddo-gardens/about/ Yaddo Gardens website].&lt;/ref&gt; The Four Seasons statues were acquired and installed in the garden in 1909.&lt;ref name="dailygazette.com"&gt;[https://dailygazette.com/article/2017/01/01/at-yaddo-statues-truly-are-for-all-seasons "At Yaddo, statues truly are for all seasons,"] ''Daily Gazette'' [[Schenectady, New York]], January 21, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; There are many statues and sculptures located within the estate, including a sundial that bears the inscription, "Hours fly, Flowers die, New days, New ways, Pass by, Love stays."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theotherpages.org/poems/vandyke1.html Poetry of [[Henry van Dyke]]].  The poem was written specifically for the Yaddo Garden.&lt;/ref&gt; While visitors are not admitted to the main mansion or artists' residences, they may visit the gardens.&lt;ref name="dailygazette.com"/&gt;
