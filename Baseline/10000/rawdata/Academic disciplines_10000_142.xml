{{italic title}}

'''''A capriccio''''' {{IPA-it|a kaˈprittʃo|}} (Italian: "following one's fancy") is a [[tempo]] marking indicating a free and [[Wiktionary:capricious|capricious]] approach to the tempo (and possibly the style) of the piece. This marking will usually modify another, such as ''lento a capriccio'', often used in the [[Hungarian Rhapsodies]] of [[Franz Liszt]]. Perhaps the most famous piece to use the term is [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s ''Rondò a capriccio'' (Op. 129), better known as ''[[Rage Over a Lost Penny]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5527">[[Image:RibonucleaseA SS paleRib.png|thumb|right| Folded, 3-D structure of ribonuclease A]]
'''Anfinsen's dogma''' (also known as the '''thermodynamic hypothesis''') is a postulate in [[molecular biology]] that states that, at least for a small globular protein in its standard physiological environment, the [[protein structure|native structure]] is determined only by the protein's [[amino acid]] [[primary structure|sequence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Anfinsen CB | title=Principles that govern the folding of protein chains | journal=Science | volume=181 |issue=4096 |year=1973 | pages=223–230 | pmid=4124164 | doi=10.1126/science.181.4096.223}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dogma was championed by the [[List of Nobel laureates|Nobel Prize Laureate]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1972/press.html|title=Press Release: The 1972 Nobel Prize in Chemistry|website=Nobelprize.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christian B. Anfinsen]] from his research on the folding of ribonuclease A.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=White FH | title=Regeneration of native secondary and tertiary structures by air oxidation of reduced ribonuclease | journal=J. Biol. Chem. | volume=236 |year=1961 | pages=1353–1360 | pmid=13784818}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Anfinsen CB, Haber E, Sela M, ((White FH Jr)) | title=The kinetics of formation of native ribonuclease during oxidation of the reduced polypeptide chain | journal=PNAS | volume=47 | issue=9 |year=1961 | pages=1309–1314 | pmid=13683522 | doi=10.1073/pnas.47.9.1309 | pmc=223141}}&lt;/ref&gt; The postulate amounts to saying that, at the environmental conditions (temperature, solvent concentration and composition, etc.) at which folding occurs, the native structure is a unique, stable and kinetically accessible minimum of the free energy.
The three conditions:

:'''Uniqueness''': requires that the sequence does not have any other configuration with a comparable free energy. Hence the free energy minimum must be ''unchallenged''.

:'''Stability''': small changes in the surrounding environment cannot give rise to changes in the minimum configuration. This can be pictured as a free energy surface that looks more like a funnel (with the native state in the bottom of it) rather than like a soup plate (with several closely related low-energy states); the free energy surface around the native state must be rather steep and high, in order to provide stability.

:'''Kinetical accessibility''': means that the path in the free energy surface from the unfolded to the folded state must be reasonably smooth or, in other words, that the folding of the chain must not involve highly complex changes in the shape (like knots or other high order conformations).

How the protein reaches this structure is the subject of the field of [[protein folding]], which has a related concept called [[Levinthal's paradox]]. The Levinthal paradox states that the number of possible conformations available to a given protein is astronomically large, such that even a small protein of 100 residues would require more time than the universe has existed (10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; seconds) to explore all possible conformations and choose the appropriate one, it would also arguably make computational prediction of protein structures under the same basis unfeasible if not impossible.

Also, some proteins need the assistance of another protein called a [[Chaperone (protein)|chaperone protein]] to fold properly. It has been suggested that this disproves Anfinsen's dogma. However, the chaperones do not appear to affect the final state of the protein; they seem to work primarily by preventing [[Protein aggregation|aggregation]] of several protein molecules prior to the final folded state of the protein.

[[Prion]]s are an exception to Anfinsen's dogma. Prions are stable conformations of proteins which differ from the native folding state. In [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (Mad Cow Disease), native proteins re-fold into a different stable conformation, which causes fatal [[amyloid]] buildup. Other amyloid diseases, including [[Alzheimer's disease]] and [[Parkinson's disease]], are also exceptions to Anfinsen's dogma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/rhoadeslab/research.html |title=Protein Folding and Misfolding |publisher=Yale University Rhoades Lab |accessdate=2012-08-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120719110222/http://www.yale.edu/rhoadeslab/research.html |archivedate=2012-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Applied Drama''''', also known as '''''Applied Theatre, Interactive Theatre&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sant|first=Toni|title=The Applied and Interactive Theatre Guide|date=22 Sep 2006|url=http://www.interactiveimprov.com/aitg.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''or '''Applied Drama''' '''and Theatre (ADT)''''' is an [[umbrella term]] for the use of [[drama]] practice in an educational, community or therapeutic context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Phillip|title=Applied Theatre/Drama: an e-debate in 2004|journal=Research in Drama Education: The Journal of Applied Theatre and Performance J|date=February 2006|volume=11|issue=1|pages=90–95|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13569780500437960#.UZmDvSsa-nk|doi=10.1080/13569780500437960}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often done in non-theatrical spaces, with participants who do not consider themselves to be artists.

There are several forms and practices considered to be under the umbrella of Applied Drama. In all these fields approaches and methods of [[Applied improvisation|Applied Improvisation]] are used. 

==History and definition==
Applied Drama is a term that has been contested{{By whom|date=August 2015}}, gaining popularity towards the end of the 20th century to describe drama practice in an educational, community or therapeutic context.

James Thompson states that "Applied theatre is a participatory theatre created by people who would not usually make theatre. It is, I would hope, a practice by, with and for the excluded and marginalised." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Applied Theatre: Bewilderment and Beyond|last = Thompson|first = James|publisher = Peter Lang|year = 2008|isbn = |location = Oxford|pages = 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judith Ackyroyd confirms the inclusion of both of these elements in ADT: "I have identified two features which I believe to be central to our understanding of applied theatre; an intention to generate change (of awareness, attitude, behaviour, etc), and the participation of the audience."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Applied Theatre: Problems and Possibilities|last = Ackroyd|first = Judith|date = 2000|journal = Applied Theatre Researcher|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Applied drama can be either scripted or unscripted.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|quote = |title = Applied Theatre, International Case Studies and Challenges for Practice|year = 2009|publisher = Intellect Publishers|location = Briston, UK|page = 7|editor1=Monica Prendergast |editor2=Juliana Saxton }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some practitioners focus primarily on improvisation, whereas others  introduce a range of artistic practices, such as developing scripted plays,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cleanbreak.org.uk retrieved 30 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; devised performances,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oilycart.org.uk.retrieved{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} 30 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; or indigenous forms of cultural performance, sometimes combined with new forms of digital communication.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example www.charles-royal.com, www.africanperformers.com, www.storyworkshop.org. retrieved 30 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fields associated with applied drama==

===Playback Theatre===
{{Main|Playback Theatre}}
[[Playback Theatre]] involves audience or group members telling stories from their lives and viewing them as enacted by actors improvising. It can also be used in conjunction with [[Narrative Therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Playback theatre and narrative therapy: introducing a new model|journal=Dramatherapy |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=108–119 |quote=Article elaborates how such integration (Playback theatre with Narrative Therapy) can be achieved and how it can contribute to the process of narrative re-authoring.|doi=10.1080/02630672.2013.821865|year=2013|last1=Barak|first1=Adi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drama in Health Education===
Drama in healthcare is drama created in medical contexts, often with the intention of rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Warren|first=Bernie|title=Using the Creative Arts in Therapy and Healthcare: A Practical Introduction|publisher=Routledge|pages=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This form of Applied Drama focuses on using theatre to educate, engage, and stimulate healing in medical professionals, patients, and the general public. Theatre and drama in healthcare are tilted towards conscientizing the populace about their health and improving their health and longevity irrespective of status or social stratification. This form of drama is often used to educate people on important health issues such as healthy eating, grief and loss, exercise, and sexual assault prevention. Examples include using actors to [[Role-playing|role-play]] health ailments in order to train healthcare professionals, performing plays focused on [[Preventive healthcare|primary prevention]], and facilitating drama workshops for patients.

===Drama Therapy===
{{Main|Drama therapy}}
[[Drama therapy]] is the use of Applied Drama techniques to facilitate personal growth and promote mental health.&lt;ref&gt;Loretta Gallo-Lopez, Lawrence C. C. Rubin -Play-Based Interventions for Children and Adolescents on the ...  2012- Page 100 "An overview of drama therapy is provided next, along with support for the use of drama therapy with children with ASd."&lt;/ref&gt;

Drama therapy is rooted in a clinical practice, facilitated by licensed clinicians, that stimulates language, cognitive development and builds resilience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Clinical Applications of Drama Therapy in Child and Adolescent Treatment|last = Weber|first = Anna Marie|publisher = Brunner-Routledge|year = 2005|isbn = |location = New York|pages = |last2 = Haen|first2 = Craig}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatre for Development===
{{Main|Theatre for Development}}
Theatre for Development uses Applied Drama techniques to facilitate development in [[less developed countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kabaso|first=Sydney|title=Theater for Development in Zambia|year=2013|publisher=Kabsy Digital Media|location=Zambia|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drama in Education ===
{{Confusing section|date=August 2015}}
Drama in Education can allow students to develop an understanding of themselves and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Arts, The Ontario Curriculum, Grades 1-8|url=http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/curriculum/elementary/arts18curr.pdf|publisher=Ontario Ministry of Education and Training|accessdate=20 May 2013|page=5|quote=Education in the arts is essential to students’ intellectual, social, physical, and emotional growth.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kathleen Galllagher has argued that 'What is clear is that there is no correct pedagogical model on offer for drama education. [...] In theatre pedagogy, we not only endow experience with meaning, but we are - as players - invited to make manifest our own subjectivities in the world evoked through character and play, a world laden with metaphor and nuance, a world where relationship to other and self-spectatorship are in dynamic and unrelenting interaction.'&lt;ref&gt;See 'Emergent Conceptions in Theatre Pedagogy and Production' in  ''How Theatre Education: Convergences and Counterpoints'' 3-13, pp. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatre in Education===
{{Main|Theatre in education}}
{{Overly detailed|date=August 2015|section=yes}}
Theatre in education (TIE) originated in Britain in the mid-1960s. Monica Prendergast and Juliana Saxton cite TIE as "one of the two historic roots of applied theatre practice."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; TIE typically includes a theatre company performing in an educational setting (i.e. a school) for youth, including interactive and performative moments.

Practitioner Lynn Hoare defines TIE as a combination of "theatrical elements with interactive moments in which audience participants (in or out of role) work with actor-teachers towards an educational or social goal, using the tools of theatre in service of this goal."&lt;ref&gt;Hoare, Lynn. Considering the Form: Fundamental Factors in Devising for Theatre-In-Education. Thesis. University of Texas at Austin. n.p. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholar Helen Nicholson notes that this work "involves professional theatre-makers working with young people in all kinds of educational settings and learning environments, including schools, hospitals, theaters, museums and heritage sites."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Nicholson, Helen, Applied Drama: The Gift of Theatre, Palgrave MacMillan, Basingstoke, UK, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

TIE seeks to educate young people in issues that are relevant to both them and their communities, for example: bullying, dating violence, environmental preservation, and peer conflict resolution. "TIE companies have always been among the most socially conscious of theatre groups, consistently choosing to examine issues they believe to be of direct relevance to the lives of the children with whom they work."&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Anthony, and Chris Vine. Learning through Theatre: The Changing Face of Theatre in Education. 3rd ed. New York: Routledge, 2013. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Theatre for Dialogue" (TFD) is a more recent term describing a model that was created specifically for the University of Texas at Austin campus community which pulls methods and theory from a variety of applied theatre practices such as TO and TIE. In her thesis, Spring Snyder explains that "Theatre For Dialogue performances explore the intersection between theatre and education as a way to investigate, reflect, provoke dialogue and serve as a rehearsal for reality without asking participants to share their own personal experiences. Although some of the Theatre For Dialogue’s roots originate from an adapted form of Boal’s Theatre of the Oppressed’s forum structure, it is Theatre in Education (TIE) that more closely aligns with TFD."&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Spring. A Transformative Classroom Experience: Exploring Campus Mental Health through Theatre For Dialogue. Thesis. University of Texas at Austin. 2015. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prison Theatre===
In prison theatre, practitioners engage offenders in correctional facilities, jails, prisons, and detention centers in exploring drama work often with the objective of education or rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shailor|first1=Jonathan|title=Performing New Lives: Prison Theatre|date=2010|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|quote=In the prison setting, as elsewhere, the needs that theatre addresses are those of self-expression and identity, freedom (of the imagination), creativity, and community.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples include Wabash Valley Correctional Facility’s ''Shakespeare in Shackles'' where maximum security prisoners learn about and perform [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]. The University of Texas’ Center for Women and Gender Studies’ Performing Justice Project works with incarcerated female youth to learn about gender and racial justice while devising a play based on the youth’s unique experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Drama Workshops for Anger Management and Offending Behaviour|last = Thompson|first = James|publisher = Jessica Kingsley Publishers|year = 1999|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===  Theatre of the Oppressed ===
{{Main|Theatre of the Oppressed}}The '''Theatre of the Oppressed''' (TO) describes theatrical forms that the Brazilian theatre practitioner Augusto Boal first developed in the 1960s, initially in Brazil and later in Europe. Boal's techniques aim to use theatre as means of promoting social and political change through allowing the audience to take an active role in the creation of the show. Theatre of the Oppressed can include aspects of [[Forum Theatre]], [[Invisible theater|Invisible Theatre]], Legislative Theatre and [[Image theatre|Image Theatre]].

=== Museum Theatre ===
{{Main|Museum theatre}}Museum theatre aims to use theatrical techniques to add emotion and value to the museum experience.&lt;ref name="IMTAL {{!}} IMTAL"&gt;{{Cite web|title = IMTAL {{!}} IMTAL|url = http://imtal-europe.net/|website = imtal-europe.net|accessdate = 2015-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is typically more common in cultural institutions like heritage sites, history museums, and science and industry museums.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Hughes. Museum theatre: Communicating with visitors through drama. Heinemann Drama, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Genshaft, Lindsay Michelle. "Bridging theatre and visual art: the role of an applied theatre practitioner in a fine art museum." (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; As with the other forms of applied drama, it can involve a variety of theatrical techniques.&lt;ref name="IMTAL {{!}} IMTAL" /&gt;

Community '''assembly rules''' are a set of controversial rules in [[ecology]], first proposed by [[Jared Diamond]].&lt;ref name="Diamond1975"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ecology and Evolution of Communities |editor=Cody ML, Diamond JM |publisher=Belknap Press, [[Harvard University Press]] |location=Cambridge, MA |year=1975 |url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674224445 |pages=342&amp;ndash;444}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==

The rules were developed after more than a decade of research into the avian assemblages on islands near [[New Guinea]]. The rules assert that competition is responsible for determining the patterns of assemblage composition.  Diamond's paper sparked nearly two decades worth of controversy in the literature, from the late seventies through the late nineties{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} and is considered a turning point in community ecology{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}. The disagreement continues to this day.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

===Rule 1: Forbidden species combinations===
The first rule is "forbidden species combinations". Diamond's hypothesis was that competition, not random immigration, was the main force structuring the species composition of islands.

So for example, the [[Bismarck black myzomela]] (''Myzomela pammelaena'') excludes the [[black sunbird]] (''Nectarinia sericea''). The Bismarck black myzomela lives on 23 of the 41 surveyed islands in the Bismarck Archipelago, but not on any of the 14 islands inhabited by the black sunbird. The two birds are about the same size, and both use their curved bills to sip nectar; Diamond argued that competition affects their distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Erik Stokstad (2009) 'On the Origin of Ecological Structure', ''Science'' 2 Oct 2009 pp. 33&amp;ndash;35.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rule 2: Reduced niche overlap===

Case tested the assembly rule that species occurring together on islands should have less [[Ecological niche|niche]] overlap than random assemblages because they have undergone specialization.&lt;ref name="Ted1983"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Case |first=Ted |year=1983 |title=Niche overlap and the assembly of island lizard communities |jstor=3544102 |journal=Oikos |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=427&amp;ndash;433 |doi=10.2307/3544102}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His study measured niche overlap of lizards on 37 islands near [[Baja California]] and compared niche overlap to the median niche overlap of computer generated random species assemblages. Case found that 30 of the 37 islands had lower niche overlap than the random assemblages and that some of the competition is due to [[interspecific competition]].

==Testing==
Testing the assembly rules is a complex process that often uses computer simulations to compare experimental data with characteristics of random assemblages of species.  The rules are generally regarded as hypotheses that need to be tested on an individual basis, not as accepted conclusions.

==Alternative theory==

As a reaction to the assembly rules controversy, ecologist [[Stephen Hubbell]] proposed that the abundance and diversity of species in a community is determined mainly by random dispersal, speciation, and extinction. This came to be known as the [[unified neutral theory of biodiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Hubbell, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bayesian probability''' is an [[Probability interpretations|interpretation of the concept of probability]], in which, instead of [[frequentist probability|frequency]] or [[propensity probability|propensity]] of some phenomenon, probability is interpreted as reasonable expectation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cox |first=R. T. |author-link=Richard Threlkeld Cox |doi=10.1119/1.1990764 |title=Probability, Frequency, and Reasonable Expectation |journal=American Journal of Physics |volume=14 |pages=1–10 |year=1946 |ref=harv|bibcode=1946AmJPh..14....1C }}&lt;/ref&gt; representing a state of knowledge&lt;ref name = "ghxaib"&gt;{{cite book |author=Jaynes, E.T. |year=1986 |contribution=Bayesian Methods: General Background |title=Maximum-Entropy and Bayesian Methods in Applied Statistics |editor=Justice, J. H. |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as quantification of a personal belief.&lt;ref name="Finetti, B. 1974"&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Finetti|first1=Bruno|title=Theory of Probability: A critical introductory treatment|date=2017|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons ltd.|location=Chichester|isbn=9781119286370|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bayesian interpretation of probability can be seen as an extension of [[propositional logic]] that enables reasoning with hypotheses, i.e., the propositions whose [[truth value|truth or falsity]] is uncertain. In the Bayesian view, a probability is assigned to a hypothesis, whereas under [[frequentist inference]], a hypothesis is typically tested without being assigned a probability.

Bayesian probability belongs to the category of evidential probabilities; to evaluate the probability of a hypothesis, the Bayesian probabilist specifies some [[prior probability]], which is then updated to a [[posterior probability]] in the light of new, relevant [[data]] (evidence).&lt;ref name="paulos"&gt;{{cite web |author-link=John Allen Paulos |last=Paulos |first=John Allen |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/07/books/review/the-theory-that-would-not-die-by-sharon-bertsch-mcgrayne-book-review.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=thomas%20bayes&amp;st=cse |title=The Mathematics of Changing Your Mind [by Sharon Bertsch McGrayne] |department=Book Review |newspaper=New York Times |date=5 August 2011 |access-date=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bayesian interpretation provides a standard set of procedures and formulae to perform this calculation.

The term ''Bayesian'' derives from the 18th&amp;nbsp;century mathematician and theologian [[Thomas Bayes]], who provided the first mathematical treatment of a non-trivial problem of statistical [[data analysis]] using what is now known as [[Bayesian inference]].&lt;ref name="HOS"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stigler|first1=Stephen M.|title=The history of statistics|date=March 1990|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674403413|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|131}} Mathematician [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] pioneered and popularised what is now called Bayesian probability.&lt;ref name="HOS" /&gt;{{rp|97–98}}

==Bayesian methodology==
Bayesian methods are characterized by concepts and procedures as follows:
* The use of [[random variable]]s, or more generally unknown quantities,&lt;ref name="rbp"/&gt; to model all sources of uncertainty in statistical models including uncertainty resulting from lack of information (see also [[Uncertainty quantification#Aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty|aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty]]).
* The need to determine the prior probability distribution taking into account the available (prior) information.
* The sequential use of [[Bayes' formula]]: when more data become available, calculate the posterior distribution using Bayes' formula; subsequently, the posterior distribution becomes the next prior.
* While for the frequentist a [[null hypothesis|hypothesis]] is a [[Proposition#Treatment in logic|proposition]] (which must be [[principle of bivalence|either true or false]]), so that the frequentist probability of a hypothesis is either 0 or 1, in Bayesian statistics the probability that can be assigned to a hypothesis can also be in a range from 0 to 1 if the truth value is uncertain.

==Objective and subjective Bayesian probabilities==
Broadly speaking, there are two interpretations on Bayesian probability. For ''[[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivists]]'', interpreting probability as extension of [[logic]], ''probability'' quantifies the reasonable expectation everyone (even a "robot") sharing the same knowledge should share in accordance with the rules of Bayesian statistics, which can be justified by [[Cox's theorem]].&lt;ref name="ghxaib" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "vkdmsn"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cox|first1=Richard T.|title=The algebra of probable inference|date=1961|publisher=Johns Hopkins Press ; Oxford University Press [distributor]|location=Baltimore, Md. : London|isbn=9780801869822|edition=[Repr.].|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For ''[[Subjectivism|subjectivists]]'', ''probability'' corresponds to a personal belief.&lt;ref name="Finetti, B. 1974" /&gt; Rationality and coherence allow for substantial variation within the constraints they pose; the constraints are justified by the [[Dutch book]] argument or by the [[decision theory]] and [[de Finetti's theorem]].&lt;ref name="Finetti, B. 1974" /&gt; The objective and subjective variants of Bayesian probability differ mainly in their interpretation and construction of the prior probability.

==History==
{{Main|History of statistics#Bayesian statistics}}

The term ''Bayesian'' refers to [[Thomas Bayes]] (1702–1761), who proved a special case of what is now called [[Bayes' theorem]] in a paper titled "[[An Essay towards solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances]]".&lt;ref&gt;McGrayne, Sharon Bertsch. (2011). {{Google books|_Kx5xVGuLRIC|''The Theory That Would Not Die,'' p. 10.|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that special case, the prior and posterior distributions were [[Beta distribution]]s and the data came from [[Bernoulli trial]]s. It was [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] (1749–1827) who introduced a general version of the theorem and used it to approach problems in [[celestial mechanics]], medical statistics, [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]], and [[jurisprudence]].&lt;ref&gt;Stigler, Stephen M. (1986) ''The history of statistics.'' Harvard University press. Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Early Bayesian inference, which used uniform priors following Laplace's [[principle of insufficient reason]], was called "[[inverse probability]]" (because it [[Inductive reasoning|infer]]s backwards from observations to parameters, or from effects to causes).&lt;ref name=Fienberg2006&gt;Fienberg, Stephen. E. (2006) [http://ba.stat.cmu.edu/journal/2006/vol01/issue01/fienberg.pdf ''When did Bayesian Inference become "Bayesian"?''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910070556/http://ba.stat.cmu.edu/journal/2006/vol01/issue01/fienberg.pdf |date=September 10, 2014 }} ''Bayesian Analysis'', 1 (1), 1–40. See page 5.&lt;/ref&gt; After the 1920s, "inverse probability" was largely supplanted by a collection of methods that came to be called [[frequentist statistics]].&lt;ref name=Fienberg2006/&gt;

In the 20th century, the ideas of Laplace developed in two directions, giving rise to ''objective'' and ''subjective'' currents in Bayesian practice.
[[Harold Jeffreys]]' ''Theory of Probability'' (first published in 1939) played an important role in the revival of the Bayesian view of probability, followed by works by [[Abraham Wald]] (1950) and [[Leonard J. Savage]] (1954). The adjective ''Bayesian'' itself dates to the 1950s;  the derived ''Bayesianism'', ''neo-Bayesianism'' is of 1960s coinage.&lt;ref&gt;
"The works of [[Abraham Wald|Wald]], ''Statistical Decision Functions'' (1950) and [[Leonard J. Savage|Savage]], ''The Foundation of Statistics'' (1954) are commonly regarded starting points for current Bayesian approaches";
"Recent developments of the so-called Bayesian approach to statistics"
Marshall Dees Harris, ''Legal-economic research'', University of Iowa. Agricultural Law Center (1959), p. 125 (fn. 52); p. 126.

"This revolution, which may or may not succeed, is neo-Bayesianism. Jeffreys tried to introduce this approach, but did not succeed at the time in giving it general appeal."  ''Annals of the Computation Laboratory of Harvard University'' 31 (1962), p. 180.
"It is curious that even in its activities unrelated to ethics, humanity searches for a religion. At the present time, the religion being 'pushed' the hardest is Bayesianism."
Oscar Kempthorne, 'The Classical Problem of Inference—Goodness of Fit', ''Proceedings of the Fifth Berkeley Symposium on Mathematical Statistics and Probability''  (1967), [https://books.google.com/books?id=IC4Ku_7dBFUC&amp;pg=PA235#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 235].&lt;/ref&gt;
In the objectivist stream, the statistical analysis depends on only the model assumed and the data analysed.&lt;ref name=Bernardo&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bernardo | first1 = J.M. | authorlink = José-Miguel Bernardo | year = 2005 | title = Reference analysis | url = | journal = Handbook of statistics | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 17–90 }}&lt;/ref&gt; No subjective decisions need to be involved. In contrast, "subjectivist" statisticians deny the possibility of fully objective analysis for the general case.

In the 1980s, there was a dramatic growth in research and applications of Bayesian methods, mostly attributed to the discovery of [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] methods and the consequent removal of many of the computational problems, and to an increasing interest in nonstandard, complex applications.&lt;ref&gt;Wolpert, R.L. (2004) ''A conversation with James O. Berger'', Statistical science, 9, 205–218&lt;/ref&gt; While frequentist statistics remains strong (as seen by the fact that most undergraduate teaching is still based on it &lt;ref&gt;[[José-Miguel Bernardo|Bernardo, José M.]] (2006) [http://www.ime.usp.br/~abe/ICOTS7/Proceedings/PDFs/InvitedPapers/3I2_BERN.pdf ''A Bayesian mathematical statistics primer'']. ICOTS-7&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}), Bayesian methods are widely accepted and used, e.g., in the field of [[machine learning]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Bishop, C.M. ''Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning.'' Springer, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Justification of Bayesian probabilities==
The use of Bayesian probabilities as the basis of [[Bayesian inference]] has been supported by several arguments, such as [[Cox's theorem|Cox axioms]], the [[Dutch book|Dutch book argument]], arguments based on [[decision theory]] and [[de Finetti's theorem]].

===Axiomatic approach===
[[Richard Threlkeld Cox|Richard T. Cox]] showed that&lt;ref name = "vkdmsn" /&gt; Bayesian updating follows from several axioms, including two [[functional equations]] and a hypothesis of differentiability. The assumption of differentiability or even continuity is controversial; Halpern found a counterexample based on his observation that the Boolean algebra of statements may be finite.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, J. ''A counterexample to theorems of Cox and Fine'', Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 10: 67–85.&lt;/ref&gt; Other axiomatizations have been suggested by various authors with the purpose of making the theory more rigorous.&lt;ref name="rbp"&gt;Dupré, Maurice J., Tipler, Frank J. [http://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.ba/1340369856 ''New Axioms For Rigorous Bayesian Probability''], Bayesian Analysis (2009), Number 3, pp. 599–606&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dutch book approach===
The Dutch book argument was proposed by de Finetti; it is based on betting. A [[Dutch book]] is made when a clever gambler places a set of bets that guarantee a profit, no matter what the outcome of the bets. If a [[bookmaker]] follows the rules of the Bayesian calculus in the construction of his odds, a Dutch book cannot be made.

However, [[Ian Hacking]] noted that traditional Dutch book arguments did not specify Bayesian updating: they left open the possibility that non-Bayesian updating rules could avoid Dutch books. For example, [[Ian Hacking|Hacking]] writes&lt;ref&gt;Hacking (1967, Section 3, page 316), Hacking (1988, page 124)&lt;/ref&gt; "And neither the Dutch book argument, nor any other in the personalist arsenal of proofs of the probability axioms, entails the dynamic assumption. Not one entails Bayesianism. So the personalist requires the dynamic assumption to be Bayesian. It is true that in consistency a personalist could abandon the Bayesian model of learning from experience. Salt could lose its savour."

In fact, there are non-Bayesian updating rules that also avoid Dutch books (as discussed in the literature on "[[probability kinematics]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Skyrms|first=Brian|date=1987-01-01|title=Dynamic Coherence and Probability Kinematics|journal=Philosophy of Science|volume=54|issue=1|pages=1–20|doi=10.1086/289350|jstor=187470}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the publication of [[Richard Jeffrey|Richard C. Jeffreys]]' rule, which is itself regarded as Bayesian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bayes-theorem/|title=Bayes' Theorem|work=stanford.edu|accessdate=2016-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The additional hypotheses sufficient to (uniquely) specify Bayesian updating are substantial&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-21329-8_15|title=Probability in Physics|last=Fuchs|first=Christopher A.|last2=Schack|first2=Rüdiger|date=2012-01-01|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|year=|isbn=9783642213281|editor-last=Ben-Menahem|editor-first=Yemima|series=The Frontiers Collection|location=|pages=233–247|language=en|arxiv=1103.5950|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-21329-8_15|editor-last2=Hemmo|editor-first2=Meir}}&lt;/ref&gt; and not universally seen as satisfactory.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bas van Fraassen|van Frassen, B.]] (1989) ''Laws and Symmetry'', Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-824860-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decision theory approach===
A [[statistical decision theory|decision-theoretic]] justification of the use of Bayesian inference (and hence of Bayesian probabilities) was given by [[Abraham Wald]], who proved that every [[admissible decision rule|admissible]] statistical procedure is either a Bayesian procedure or a limit of Bayesian procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Wald, Abraham. ''Statistical Decision Functions.'' Wiley 1950.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, every Bayesian procedure is [[admissible decision rule|admissible]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernardo, José M., Smith, Adrian F.M. ''Bayesian Theory.'' John Wiley 1994. {{ISBN|0-471-92416-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal probabilities and objective methods for constructing priors==
Following the work on [[expected utility]] [[optimal decision|theory]] of [[Frank P. Ramsey|Ramsey]] and [[John von Neumann|von Neumann]],  decision-theorists have accounted for [[optimal decision|rational behavior]] using a probability distribution for the [[Agent-based model|agent]]. Johann Pfanzagl completed the ''[[Theory of Games and Economic Behavior]]'' by providing an axiomatization of subjective probability and utility, a task left uncompleted by von Neumann and [[Oskar Morgenstern]]: their original theory supposed that all the agents had the same probability distribution, as a convenience.&lt;ref&gt;Pfanzagl (1967, 1968)&lt;/ref&gt; Pfanzagl's axiomatization was endorsed by Oskar Morgenstern: "Von Neumann and I have anticipated...[the question whether probabilities] might, perhaps more typically, be subjective and have stated specifically that in the latter case axioms could be found from which could derive the desired numerical utility together with a number for the probabilities (cf. p. 19 of The [[Theory of Games and Economic Behavior]]). We did not carry this out; it was demonstrated by Pfanzagl ... with all the necessary rigor".&lt;ref&gt;Morgenstern (1976, page 65)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramsey and [[Leonard Jimmie Savage|Savage]] noted that the individual agent's probability distribution could be objectively studied in experiments. The role of judgment and disagreement in science has been recognized since [[Aristotle]] and even more clearly with [[Francis Bacon]]. The objectivity of science lies not in the psychology of individual scientists, but in the process of science and especially in statistical methods, as noted by [[Charles Sanders Peirce|C. S. Peirce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stigler |first=Stephen M. |year=1978 |authorlink=Stephen Stigler |title=Mathematical statistics in the early States |journal=Annals of Statistics |volume=6 |issue=March |pages=239–265 esp. p. 248 |publisher= |doi=10.1214/aos/1176344123 |jstor=2958876 |mr=483118 |url=http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aos/1176344123 |accessdate= |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recall that the objective methods for falsifying propositions about personal probabilities have been used for a half century, as noted previously. Procedures for [[statistical hypothesis testing|testing hypotheses]] about probabilities (using finite samples) are due to [[Frank P. Ramsey|Ramsey]] (1931) and [[Bruno de Finetti|de Finetti]] (1931, 1937, 1964, 1970). Both [[Bruno de Finetti]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galavotti|first=Maria Carla|date=1989-01-01|title=Anti-Realism in the Philosophy of Probability: Bruno de Finetti's Subjectivism|journal=Erkenntnis (1975-)|volume=31|issue=2/3|pages=239–261|doi=10.1007/bf01236565|jstor=20012239}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galavotti|first=Maria Carla|date=1991-12-01|title=The notion of subjective probability in the work of Ramsey and de Finetti|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1755-2567.1991.tb00839.x/abstract|journal=Theoria|language=en|volume=57|issue=3|pages=239–259|doi=10.1111/j.1755-2567.1991.tb00839.x|issn=1755-2567}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Frank P.

Peirce]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The "Ramsey test" for evaluating probability distributions is implementable in theory, and has kept experimental psychologists occupied for a half century.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson et al. (1957)&lt;/ref&gt;
This work demonstrates that Bayesian-probability propositions can be [[Falsifiability|falsified]], and so meet an empirical criterion of [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Charles S. Peirce]], whose work inspired Ramsey. (This [[falsifiability]]-criterion was popularized by [[Karl Popper]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/popper/#ProDem "Karl Popper" in ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Popper, Karl. (2002) [https://books.google.com/books?id=T76Zd20IYlgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=logic+of+scientific+discovery&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eGfU8COmAA&amp;sig=W8TTt29x5sG8aCGpYuWnonDFH8M&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=crC3TJKND46ssAPp06jkCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=falsifiability&amp;f=false ''The Logic of Scientific Discovery''] 2nd Edition, Routledge {{ISBN|0-415-27843-0}} (Reprint of 1959 translation of 1935 original) Page 57.&lt;/ref&gt;)

Modern work on the experimental evaluation of personal probabilities uses the randomization, [[double blind|blinding]], and Boolean-decision procedures of the Peirce-Jastrow experiment.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce &amp; Jastrow (1885)
&lt;/ref&gt; Since individuals act according to different probability judgments, these agents' probabilities are "personal" (but amenable to objective study).

Personal probabilities are problematic for science and for some applications where decision-makers lack the knowledge or time to specify an informed probability-distribution (on which they are prepared to act). To meet the needs of science and of human limitations, Bayesian statisticians have developed "objective" methods for specifying prior probabilities.

Indeed, some Bayesians have argued the prior state of knowledge defines ''the'' (unique) prior probability-distribution for "regular" statistical problems; cf. [[well-posed problem]]s. Finding the right method for constructing such "objective" priors (for appropriate classes of regular problems) has been the quest of statistical theorists from Laplace to [[John Maynard Keynes]], [[Harold Jeffreys]], and [[Edwin Thompson Jaynes]]. These theorists and their successors have suggested several methods for constructing "objective" priors (Unfortunately, it is not clear how to assess the relative "objectivity" of the priors proposed under these methods):
* [[principle of maximum entropy|Maximum entropy]]
* [[Haar measure|Transformation group analysis]]
* [[José-Miguel Bernardo|Reference analysis]]

Each of these methods contributes useful priors for "regular" one-parameter problems, and each prior can handle some challenging [[statistical model]]s (with "irregularity" or several parameters). Each of these methods has been useful in Bayesian practice. Indeed, methods for constructing "objective" (alternatively, "default" or "ignorance") priors have been developed by avowed subjective (or "personal") Bayesians like [[James Berger (statistician)|James Berger]] ([[Duke University]]) and [[José-Miguel Bernardo]] ([[University of Valencia|Universitat de València]]), simply because such priors are needed for Bayesian practice, particularly in science.&lt;ref name="refa"&gt;Bernardo, J. M. (2005). [http://www.uv.es/~bernardo/RefAna.pdf ''Reference Analysis'']. ''Handbook of Statistics'' 25 (D. K. Dey and [[C. R. Rao]] eds). Amsterdam: Elsevier, 17–90&lt;/ref&gt; The quest for "the universal method for constructing priors" continues to attract statistical theorists.&lt;ref name="refa" /&gt;

Thus, the Bayesian statistician needs either to use informed priors (using relevant expertise or previous data) or to choose among the competing methods for constructing "objective" priors.

The '''Boston Psychoanalytic Society and Institute''' is a [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] research, training, education facility that is affiliated with the [[American Psychoanalytic Association]] and the [[International Psychoanalytic Association]]. There were no psychoanalytic societies devoted to [[Sigmund Freud]] in Boston prior to his visit to [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] in 1909, though after 1909 there were individuals interested in Freud's writings, including [[James Jackson Putnam]], [[L. Eugene Emerson]], [[Isador Coriat]], [[William Healy (physician)|William Healy]], and [[Augusta Bronner]]. The present society and institute (abbreviated BPSI) was founded by psychoanalyst [[Franz Alexander]] only after 1931.  The BPSI is the third oldest psychoanalytic institute in the United States; only the [[New York Psychoanalytic Institute]] and [[Chicago Institute for Psychoanalysis]] are older.  

Major psychoanalysts who have been associated with the institute include [[Franz Alexander]], [[Hans Sachs]], [[Helene Deutsch]], [[Felix Deutsch]], Hans and [[Greta Bibring]], [[Ives Hendrix]], and more recently [[Philip Holzman]] and [[Arnold Modell]].  In its early years, the Department of Psychiatry at the [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] was strongly associated with BPSI, especially through its first chief [[Stanley Cobb]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19120">The '''change management''' process in [[systems engineering]] is the process of requesting, determining attainability, planning, implementing, and evaluating of changes to a [[system]]. Its main goals are to support the processing and traceability of changes to an interconnected set of factors.&lt;ref&gt;Crnkovic, Asklund &amp; Persson-Dahlqvist, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
There is considerable overlap and confusion between change management, [[change control]] and [[configuration management]]. The definition below does not yet integrate these areas.

Change management has been embraced for its ability to deliver benefits by improving the affected system and thereby satisfying "customer needs," but has also been criticized for its potential to confuse and needlessly complicate change administration. In some cases, notably in the [[Information Technology]] domain, more funds and work are put into system maintenance (and change management) than into the initial creation of a system.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis, Wixom &amp; Tegarden, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  Typical investment by organizations during initial implementation of large [[Enterprise resource planning | ERP]] systems is 15 to 20 percent of overall budget.

In the same vein, Hinley &lt;ref&gt;Hinley 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; describes two of [[Lehman's laws of software evolution]]:
* '''The law of continuing change''': Systems that are used must change, or else automatically become less useful.
* '''The law of increasing complexity''': Through changes, the structure of a system becomes ever more complex, and more resources are required to simplify it.

Change management is also of great importance in the field of manufacturing, which is confronted with many changes due to increasing and worldwide [[competition]], technological advances and demanding customers.&lt;ref&gt;Huang &amp; Mak, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Because many systems tend to change and evolve as they are used, the problems of these industries are experienced to some degree in many others.

Notes: In the process below, it is arguable that the change committee should be responsible not only for accept/reject decisions, but also prioritization, which influences how change requests are batched for processing.

==The process and its deliverables==
For the description of the change management process, the [[meta-modeling technique]] is used. Figure 1 depicts the [[process-data diagram]], which is explained in this section.

[[Image:Metamodel change management.png|800px|Figure 1: Process-data model for the change management process]]

===Activities===
There are six main activities, which jointly form the change management process. They are: Identify potential change, Analyze change request, Evaluate change, Plan change, Implement change and Review and close change. These activities are executed by four different [[role]]s, which are discussed in Table 1. The activities (or their sub-activities, if applicable) themselves are described in Table 2.

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:left"
|+ Table 1: Role descriptions for the change management process
|-
! Role !! Description
|-
|'''Customer'''
|The [[customer]] is the role that requests a change due to problems encountered or new functionality requirements; this can be a person or an organizational entity and can be in- or external to the company that is asked to implement the change.
|-
|'''Project manager'''
|The [[project manager]] is the owner of the [[project]] that the CHANGE REQUEST concerns. In some cases there is a distinct change manager, who in that case takes on this role.
|-
|'''Change committee'''
|The change [[committee]] decides whether a CHANGE REQUEST will be implemented or not. Sometimes this task is performed by the project manager as well.
|-
|'''Change builder'''
|The change builder is the person who plans and implements the change; it could be argued that the planning component is (partially) taken on by the project manager.
|}

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:left"
|+ Table 2: Activity descriptions for the change management process
|-
! Activity !! Sub-activity !! Description
|-
|'''Identify potential change'''
|Require new functionality&lt;ref name="note"&gt;Actually, not ''both'' Require new functionality and Encounter problem ''have'' to occur in order to get a CHANGE REQUEST; usually only one of the two will. Modeling them as unordered activities approximately approaches this meaning; an alternative would be to create two separate ‘starting points’ (i.e. initial states), both pointing to Request change.&lt;/ref&gt;
|A customer desires new functionality and formulates a REQUIREMENT.
|-
|
|Encounter problem&lt;ref name="note"/&gt;
|A customer encounters a problem (e.g. a [[Software bug|bug]]) in the system and this leads to a PROBLEM REPORT.
|-
|
|Request change
|A customer proposes a change through creation of a CHANGE REQUEST.
|-
|'''Analyze change request'''
|Determine technical feasibility
|The project manager determines the technical feasibility of the proposed CHANGE REQUEST, leading to a CHANGE TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY.
|-
|
|Determine costs and benefits
|The project manager determines the costs and benefits of the proposed CHANGE REQUEST, resulting in CHANGE COSTS AND BENEFITS. This and the above sub-activity can be done in any order and they are independent of each other, hence the modeling as unordered activities.
|-
|'''Evaluate change'''
|
|Based on the CHANGE REQUEST, its CHANGE TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY and CHANGE COSTS AND BENEFITS, the change committee makes the go/no-go decision. This is modeled as a separate activity because it is an important process step and has another role performing it. It is modeled as a sub-activity (without any activity containing it) as recommended by Remko Helms (personal communication).
|-
|'''Plan change'''
|Analyze change impact
|The extent of the change (i.e. what other items the change effects) is determined in a CHANGE IMPACT ANALYSIS. It could be argued that this activity leads to another go/no-go decision, or that it even forms a part of the Analyze change request activity. It is modeled here as a planning task for the change builder because of its relationship with the activity Propagate change.
|-
|
|Create planning
|A CHANGE PLANNING is created for the [[implementation]] of the change. Some process descriptions (e.g. Mäkäräinen, 2000) illustrate that is also possible to ‘save’ changes and process them later in a [[Batch production|batch]]. This activity could be viewed as a good point to do this.
|-
|'''Implement change'''
|Execute change
|The change is ‘programmed’; this activity has a strong relationship with Propagate change, because sometimes the change has to be adapted to other parts of the system (or even other systems) as well.
|-
|
|Propagate change
|The changes resulting from Execute change have to be propagated to other system parts that are influenced by it. Because this and the above sub-activity are highly dependent on each other, they have been modeled as concurrent activities.
|-
|
|Test change
|The change builder tests whether what (s)he has built actually works and satisfies the CHANGE REQUEST. As depicted in the diagram, this can result in an [[iterative]] process together with the above two sub-activities.
|-
|
|Update documentation
|The DOCUMENTATION is updated to reflect the applied changes.
|-
|
|Release change
|A new SYSTEM RELEASE, which reflects the applied change, is made public.
|-
|'''Review and close change'''
|Verify change
|The implementation of the change in the new SYSTEM RELEASE is verified for the last time, now by the project manager. Maybe this has to happen before the release, but due to conflicting literature sources and diagram complexity considerations it was chosen to model it this way and include this issue.
|-
|
|Close change
|This change [[Instruction cycle|cycle]] is completed, i.e. the CHANGE LOG ENTRY is wrapped up.
|}

===Deliverables===
Besides activities, the process-data diagram (Figure 1) also shows the [[deliverable]]s of each activity, i.e. the data. These deliverables or concepts are described in Table 3; in this context, the most important concepts are: [[Change request|CHANGE REQUEST]] and CHANGE LOG ENTRY.

A few concepts are defined by the author (i.e. lack a reference), because either no (good) definitions could be found, or they are the obvious result of an activity. These concepts are marked with an asterisk (‘*’). Properties of concepts have been left out of the model, because most of them are trivial and the diagram could otherwise quickly become too complex. Furthermore, some concepts (e.g. CHANGE REQUEST, SYSTEM RELEASE) lend themselves for the [[Version control|versioning]] approach as proposed by Weerd,&lt;ref&gt;Weerd 2006&lt;/ref&gt; but this has also been left out due to diagram complexity constraints.

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:left"
|+ Table 3: Concept descriptions for the change management process
|-
! Concept !! Description
|-
|'''[[Requirement|REQUIREMENT]]'''
|A required functionality of a component (or item; NASA, 2005).
|-
|'''PROBLEM REPORT'''
|Document describing a [[problem]] that cannot be solved by a level 1 help desk employee; contains items like date, contact info of person reporting the problem, what is causing the problem, location and description of the problem, action taken and disposition, but this is not depicted in the diagram (Dennis, et al., 2002).
|-
|'''[[Change request|CHANGE REQUEST]]'''
|Document that describes the requested change and why it is important; can originate from PROBLEM REPORTS, system enhancements, other projects, changes in underlying systems and senior management, here summarized as REQUIREMENTS (Dennis, et al., 2002). Important attribute: ‘go/no-go decision’, i.e. is the change going to be executed or not?
|-
|'''CHANGE LOG ENTRY*'''
|Distinct entry in the collection of all changes (e.g. for a project); consists of a CHANGE REQUEST, CHANGE TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY, CHANGE COSTS AND BENEFITS, CHANGE IMPACT ANALYSIS, CHANGE PLANNING, TEST REPORT and CHANGE VERIFICATION. Not all these have to be included if the process is terminated earlier (i.e. if the change is not implemented).
|-
|'''[[Feasibility Study|CHANGE TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY]]'''
|Concept that indicates whether or not “reliable hardware and software, technical resources capable of meeting the needs of a proposed system [i.e. change request] can be acquired or developed by an organization in the required time” (Vogl, 2004).
|-
|'''[[Costs and benefits|CHANGE COSTS AND BENEFITS]]'''
|The expected effort required to implement and the advantages (e.g. cost savings, increased revenue) gained by implementing the change. Also named economic feasibility (Vogl, 2004).
|-
|'''[[Change impact analysis|CHANGE IMPACT ANALYSIS]]'''
|An assessment of the extent of the change (Rajlich, 1999).
|-
|'''[[Plan|CHANGE PLANNING]]'''
|“A scheme, method or design for the attainment of some objective or to achieve something [i.e. the change]” (Georgetown University, n.d.), in this case the change.
|-
|'''[[wikt:item|ITEM]]'''
|“A non-specific term used to denote any [[Product (business)|product]], including systems, subsystems, assemblies, subassemblies, units, sets, accessories, computer programs, computer software or parts” (Rigby, 2003); has (overlapping) [[subtype]]s ADDED ITEM and CHANGED ITEM.
|-
|'''ADDED ITEM*'''
|Self-explanatory: a newly created ITEM; subtype of ITEM.
|-
|'''CHANGED ITEM*'''
|Self-explanatory: an ITEM that already existed, but has been altered; subtype of ITEM.
|-
|'''[[Program evaluation|TEST REPORT]]'''
|“A document that describes the conduct and results of the testing carried out for a system or component [affected by the change]” (IEEE, 1991).
|-
|'''[[Documentation|DOCUMENTATION]]'''
|According to the Pennsylvania State University Libraries (2004) definition, DOCUMENTATION is “[p]rinted material which accompanies other materials (usually non-book), and which explains, gives instructions for use, or otherwise functions as a guide to the major materials.” In this context, it can also be digital materials or even training, as long as it relates to (pieces of) the system.
|-
|'''SYSTEM RELEASE'''
|“[M]erchandise issued for sale or public showing” (Princeton University, 2003). Consists of one or more ITEMS and the accompanying DOCUMENTATION.
|-
|'''CHANGE VERIFICATION'''
|A determination of whether or not the result of the change implementation fulfills the requirements established earlier (Rigby, 2003).
|}

Besides just ‘changes’, one can also distinguish deviations and waivers.&lt;ref&gt;Scott &amp; Nisse, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; A deviation is an authorization (or a request for it) to depart from a requirement of an item, prior to the creation of it. A waiver is essentially the same, but than during or after creation of the item. These two approaches can be viewed as minimalistic change management (i.e. no real solution to the problem at hand).

===Examples===
A good example of the change management process in action can be found in [[software development]]. Often users report bugs or desire new functionality from their software programs, which leads to a [[change request]]. The [[product software]] company then looks into the technical and economical feasibility of implementing this change and consequently it decides whether the change will actually be realized. If that indeed is the case, the change has to be planned, for example through the usage of [[function point]]s. The actual execution of the change leads to the creation and/or alteration of [[software code]] and when this change is propagated it probably causes other code fragments to change as well. After the initial test results seem satisfactory, the documentation can be brought up to date and be released, together with the software. Finally, the project manager verifies the change and closes this entry in the change log.

[[Image:Example change request.png|right|350px|Figure 2: Example change request for the car industry]]

Another typical area for change management in the way it is treated here, is the [[manufacturing]] domain. Take for instance the design and production of a [[car]]. If for example the vehicle’s air bags are found to automatically fill with air after driving long distances, this will without a doubt lead to customer complaints (or hopefully problem reports during the testing phase). In turn, these produce a change request (see Figure 2 on the right), which will probably justify a change. Nevertheless, a – most likely simplistic – cost and benefit analysis has to be done, after which the change request can be approved. Following an analysis of the impact on the car design and production schedules, the planning for the implementation of the change can be created. According to this planning, the change can actually be realized, after which the new version of the car is hopefully thoroughly tested before it is released to the public.

==In industrial plants==
Since complex processes can be very sensitive to even small changes, proper management of change to industrial facilities and processes is recognized as critical to safety. In the US, [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] has regulations that govern how changes are to be made and documented. The main requirement is that a thorough review of a proposed change be performed by a multi-disciplinary team to ensure that as many possible viewpoints are used to minimize the chances of missing a hazard. In this context, change management is known as Management of Change, or MOC. It is just one of many components of [[Process Safety Management]], section 1910.119(l).1

A '''computer architecture simulator''' is a [[Computer program|program]] that simulates the [[Execution (computing)|execution]] of [[computer architecture]].

Computer architecture simulators are used for the following purposes:
* Lowering cost by evaluating hardware designs without building physical hardware systems.
* Enabling access to unobtainable hardware.
* Increasing the precision and volume of computer performance data.
* Introducing abilities that are not normally possible on real hardware such as running code backwards when an error is detected or running in faster-than-[[Real-time computing|real time]].

==Categories==

Computer architecture simulators can be classified into many different categories depending on the context.
* '''Scope''': [[Microarchitecture simulation|Microarchitecture simulators]] model the [[microprocessor]] and its components. [[Computer architecture simulator#Full-system simulator|Full-system simulators]] also model the processor, memory systems, and I/O devices.
* '''Detail''': Functional simulators, such as [[instruction set simulator]]s, achieve the same function as modeled components. They can be simulated faster if timing is not considered. Timing simulators are functional simulators that also reproduce timing. Timing simulators can be further categorized into digital cycle-accurate and analog sub-cycle simulators.
* '''Workload''': Trace-driven simulators (also called event-driven simulators) react to pre-recorded streams of instructions with some fixed input. Execution-driven simulators allow dynamic change of instructions to be executed depending on different input data.

===Full-system simulators===

A '''full-system simulator''' is execution-driven architecture simulation at such a level of detail that complete software stacks from real systems can run on the simulator without any modification. A full system simulator provides virtual hardware that is independent of the nature of the host computer. The full-system model typically includes [[processor core]]s, [[peripheral device]]s, [[computer memory|memories]], interconnection buses, and [[computer networking|network]] connections. [[Emulator]]s are full system simulators that imitate obsolete hardware instead of under development hardware.

The defining property of full-system simulation compared to an [[Instruction Set Simulator|instruction set simulator]] is that the model allows real [[Device driver wrapper|device drivers]] and [[operating system]]s to be run, not just single programs.  Thus, full-system simulation makes it possible to simulate individual computers and networked computer nodes with all their [[software]], from network device drivers to operating systems, [[network stack]]s, [[middleware]], [[Server (computing)|server]]s, and [[application program]]s.

Full system simulation can speed the system development process by making it easier to detect, recreate and repair flaws. The use of [[multi-core processor]]s is driving the need for full system simulation, because it can be extremely difficult and time-consuming to recreate and debug errors without the controlled environment provided by virtual hardware.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ddj.com/184406408 Debugging and Full System Simulation]&lt;/ref&gt; This also allows the software development to take place before the hardware is ready,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2009|author=Vania Joloboff|url=http://www.irisa.fr/archi09/joloboff.pdf|title=Full System Simulation of Embedded Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus helping to validate design decisions.

===Cycle-accurate simulator===

A '''cycle-accurate simulator''' is a computer program that simulates a [[microarchitecture]] on a cycle-by-cycle basis. In contrast an [[instruction set simulator]] simulates an [[instruction set architecture]] usually faster but not cycle-accurate to a specific implementation of this architecture; they are often used when emulating older hardware, where time precisions are very important from legacy reasons. Often, a cycle-accurate simulator is used when designing new microprocessors{{spaced ndash}}they can be tested, and benchmarked accurately (including running full operating system, or compilers) without actually building a physical chip, and easily change design many times to meet expected plan.

Cycle-accurate simulators must ensure that all operations are executed in the proper virtual (or real if it is possible) time{{spaced ndash}}branch prediction, cache misses, fetches, pipeline stalls, thread context switching, and many other subtle aspects of microprocessors.

A '''crisis actor''' (aka '''actor-patient''' or '''actor victim''') is a trained [[actor]], role player, volunteer, or other person engaged to portray a disaster victim during [[safety drill|emergency drills]] to train first responders such as police, firefighters or EMT personnel. Crisis actors are used to create high-fidelity simulations of disasters in order to allow first responders to practice their skills and help emergency services organizations to prepare and train in realistic scenarios as part of full-scale disaster exercises.&lt;ref name="CrisisActors"&gt;{{cite web|title=Crisis Actors.

== Disaster training simulations ==
Actors take on the role of mock victims and simulate specific injuries from a disaster to add life-like realism to an emergency exercise. Theatrical [[makeup]] and cosmetics, plus rubber and latex appliances, are often used to simulate a variety of wounds or medical conditions that realistically portray victim's injuries, a practice known as [[Moulage|medical moulage]].&lt;ref name="Merica2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bobbie J Merica|title=Medical Moulage: How to Make Your Simulations Come Alive|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hX_2AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR32|date=22 November 2011|publisher=F.A.

Actors who portray news reporters, relatives of victims, and concerned citizens are also used during drills to train [[emergency operations center]] personnel to cope with a variety of emotionally-charged demands and requests.&lt;ref name="Hiatt2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charlotte J.

== Conspiracy theories and defamation ==
The term has been used by [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theorists]] who claimed that some [[mass shootings]] and other disasters were staged, and victims and their families were being played by crisis actors. Conspiracy theorists' use of the term is thought to have originated in 2012, when a blog post by former professor and professional conspiracy theorist [[James Tracy (communication scholar)|James Tracy]] suggested that the government could have hired an [[Talent agent|acting agency]] named [[Visionbox]], which supplied crisis actors who were "trained in criminal and victim behavior, and bring intense realism to simulated mass casualty incidents in public places" to help stage the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting|Sandy Hook shooting]].

Tracy also promoted a crisis actor conspiracy theory of the [[Boston Marathon bombing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/pammy8/what-is-a-crisis-actor-conspiracy-theory-explanation-parkland-shooting-sandy-hook|title=Where the 'Crisis Actor' Conspiracy Theory Comes From|last1=Koebler|first1=Jason|date=22 February 2018|work=Motherboard|accessdate=22 February 2018|agency=[[Vice Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vox2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/2/22/17036018/parkland-conspiracy-theories|title=The Parkland conspiracy theories, explained Crisis actors? The deep state?|last1=Yglesias|first1=Matthew|publisher=Vox|accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conspiracy theorists have claimed such attacks are "[[false flag]] operations" staged by conspirators, usually government or corporate forces, in order to achieve some goal such as justifying increased [[government surveillance]], disarmament of the population, or military action against blamed nations or groups. Crisis actors are claimed in this context to play the part of bystanders or witnesses, emergency response personnel, and (with the aid of stage makeup) wounded victims of the attack.

Popularizers of the conspiracy theory include commentators such as [[Alex Jones]] and outlets such as ''True Pundit''.&lt;ref name="NYT2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/29/us/after-orlando-shooting-false-flag-and-crisis-actor-conspiracy-theories-surface.html|title=After Orlando Shooting, 'False Flag' and 'Crisis Actor' Conspiracy Theories Surface|last1=Mele|first1=Christopher|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian12"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/21/crisis-actors-deep-state-false-flag-the-rise-of-conspiracy-theory-code-words |title=Crisis actors, deep state, false flag: the rise of conspiracy theory code words|last1=Wilson|first1=Jason|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vox2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Snopes12"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.snopes.com/same-girl-crying-now-oregon/|title=Crisis Actors Uncovered?|publisher=Snopes |accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2018, the parents of two children killed in the Sandy Hook shooting launched a lawsuit against Alex Jones for defamation "accusing him and his website [[InfoWars]] of engaging in a campaign of 'false, cruel, and dangerous assertions'".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-texas-lawsuit-alexjones/sandy-hook-parents-sue-conspiracy-theorist-alex-jones-for-defamation-idUSKBN1HO2FU|title=Sandy Hook parents sue conspiracy theorist Alex Jones for defamation|author=Editorial |publisher=Reuters |access-date=2018-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[transport]], '''D-value''' is a rating in [[Kilonewton|kN]] that is typically attributed to mechanical [[coupling]]s, and reflects [[dynamic loading]] limits between a towing vehicle and a [[trailer (vehicle)|trailer]].  
The corresponding formula for a truck and trailer combination, used to determine the required D-value of a coupling, is:

T = Weight of towing vehicle including the vertical load on the fifth wheel&lt;br /&gt;
R = Total weight of the loaded semi-trailer&lt;br /&gt;
U = Vertical load on the fifth wheel&lt;br /&gt;
g = Acceleration due to gravity (assumed to be 9.81&amp;nbsp;m/s 2 )

D (kN) = g x ((0.6 x T x R)/(T + R - U))&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Calculation of D-Value for Tractor and Semi-Trailer Combinations|url=http://ww1.safholland.pl/quicklit/XL-FW01055SB-en-DE.pdf|website=www.safholland.com|ref=1|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606201932/http://ww1.safholland.pl/quicklit/XL-FW01055SB-en-DE.pdf|archivedate=2014-06-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37086">The '''Democratic National Committee cyber attacks''' took place in 2015 and 2016, in which [[hacker (computer security)|computer hackers]] infiltrated the [[Democratic National Committee]] (DNC) [[computer network]], leading to a [[data breach]]. Some [[cybersecurity]] experts, as well as the U.S. government, stated that the [[cyberespionage]] was the work of Russian intelligence agencies.

Forensic evidence analyzed by several cybersecurity firms, [[CrowdStrike]], [[Fidelis Security Systems (company)|Fidelis]], and [[Mandiant]] (or [[FireEye]]), strongly indicates that two [[Russian Federation|Russian]] intelligence agencies infiltrated the DNC computer systems. The American [[cybersecurity]] firm CrowdStrike, which removed the hacking programs, revealed a history of encounters with both groups and had already named them, calling one of  them [[Cozy Bear]] and the other [[Fancy Bear]], names which are used in the media.&lt;ref name=thomas&gt;{{cite news|last=Rid|first=Thomas|title=All Signs Point to Russia Being Behind the DNC Hack|newspaper=Motherboard|publisher=Vice Media|date=July 25, 2016|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/all-signs-point-to-russia-being-behind-the-dnc-hack|access-date=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nakashima/&gt;&lt;ref name=sanger/&gt;&lt;ref name=alperovitch/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sanger |first1=David E. |last2=Schmitt |first2=Eric |date=July 26, 2016 |title=Spy Agency Consensus Grows That Russia Hacked D.N.C. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/27/us/politics/spy-agency-consensus-grows-that-russia-hacked-dnc.html |newspaper=New York Times|access-date=July 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 9, 2016, the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] told U.S. legislators the [[United States Intelligence Community|U.S. Intelligence Community]] concluded Russia conducted the [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|cyberattacks and other operations during the 2016 U.S. election]] to assist [[Donald Trump]] in winning the presidency.&lt;ref name=secretcia /&gt; Multiple U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that specific individuals tied to the Russian government provided WikiLeaks with the stolen emails from the DNC, as well as stolen emails from [[Hillary Clinton]]'s campaign chairman, who was also the target of [[Podesta emails|a cyberattack]].&lt;ref name=secretcia /&gt; These intelligence organizations additionally concluded Russia hacked the [[Republican National Committee]] (R.N.C.) as well as the D.N.C., but chose not to leak information obtained from the R.N.C.&lt;ref name=russiahackedrepublican /&gt;

== Cyber attacks and responsibility==
Cyber attacks that successfully penetrated the DNC computing system began in 2015. Attacks by "Cozy Bear" began in the summer of 2015. Attacks by "Fancy Bear" began in April 2016. It was after the "Fancy Bear" group began their activities that the compromised system became apparent. The groups were presumed to have been spying on communications, stealing [[opposition research]] on [[Donald Trump]], as well as reading all [[email]] and chats. Both were finally identified by CrowdStrike in May 2016. Both groups of intruders were successfully expelled from the DNC systems within hours after detection. These attacks are considered to be part of a group of recent attacks targeting U.S. government departments and several political organizations, including 2016 campaign organizations.&lt;ref name=thomas/&gt;&lt;ref name=nakashima/&gt;&lt;ref name=sanger/&gt;&lt;ref name=alperovitch/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

President Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin had a discussion about [[computer security]] issues, which took place as a side segment during the [[2016 G20 Hangzhou summit|then-ongoing G20 summit]] in China in September 2016.

== Background ==
As is common among Russian intelligence services, both groups used similar hacking tools and strategies. It is believed that neither group was aware of the other. Although this is antithetical to American [[espionage|computer intelligence]] methods, for fear of undermining or defeating [[American intelligence|intelligence operation]]s of the other, this has been common practice in the Russian intelligence community since 2004.&lt;ref name=nakashima/&gt;&lt;ref name=alperovitch/&gt;&lt;ref name=ecfr&gt;

Both are believed connected to the Russian intelligence services. Also, both access resources and demonstrate levels of proficiency matching nation-state capabilities.

"Cozy Bear" has in the past year infiltrated unclassified computer systems of the [[White House]], the [[U.S. State Department]], and the [[U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff]]. According to [[CrowdStrike]], other targeted sectors include''':''' Defense, Energy, [[Mining industry|Mining]], Financial, Insurance, Legal, Manufacturing, Media, [[Think tank]]s, Pharmaceutical, [[Research]] and [[Technology]] industries as well as universities. "Cozy Bear" observed attacks have occurred in [[Western Europe]], Brazil, [[China]], Japan, Mexico, [[New Zealand]], South Korea, [[Turkey]] and [[Central Asia]].&lt;ref name=nakashima/&gt;&lt;ref name=alperovitch/&gt;

"Fancy Bear" has been operating since the mid-2000s. [[CrowdStrike]] reported targeting has included [[Aerospace]], Defense, Energy, Government and the Media industries. "Fancy Bear" intrusions have occurred in [[United States]], Western Europe, Brazil, [[Canada]], China, [[Georgia (country)|Republic of Georgia]], [[Iran]], Japan,  [[Malaysia]] and [[South Korea]]. Targeted [[defense ministries]] and military organizations parallel Russian Federation government interests. This may indicate affiliation with the [[Main Intelligence Directorate]] (GRU, a Russian military intelligence service). Specifically, "Fancy Bear" has been linked to intrusions into the [[German Bundestag]] and France’s [[TV5 Monde]] (television station) in April 2015.&lt;ref name=nakashima/&gt;&lt;ref name=alperovitch/&gt; [[SecureWorks]], a cybersecurity   firm headquartered in the United States, concluded that from March 2015 to May 2016, the "Fancy Bear" target list included not merely the DNC, but tens of thousands of foes of Putin and the Kremlin in the United States, Ukraine, Russia, Georgia, and Syria. Only a handful of Republicans were targeted, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =  | first =  | title = Russian hackers pursued Putin foes, not just U.S. Democrats | url = https://www.staradvertiser.com/2017/11/01/breaking-news/hit-list-exposes-russian-hacking-beyond-u-s-elections/ | work = [[Star-Advertiser]] | agency = [[Associated Press]] | date = November 1, 2017 | accessdate = November 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hacking the DNC ==
On January 25, 2018 [[Netherlands|Dutch]] newspaper [[de Volkskrant]] and TV program [[Nieuwsuur]] reported that in 2014 the Dutch Intelligence agency [[General Intelligence and Security Service]] (AIVD) successfully infiltrated the computers of [[Cozy Bear]] and observed the hacking of the head office of the DNC and subsequently The White House and were the first to alert the [[National Security Agency]] about the cyber-intrusion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nos.nl/nieuwsuur/artikel/2213767-dutch-intelligence-first-to-alert-u-s-about-russian-hack-of-democratic-party.html Dutch intelligence first to alert U.S. about Russian hack of Democratic Party]&lt;/ref&gt;

"Cozy Bear" had access to DNC systems since the summer of 2015; and "Fancy Bear", since April 2016. There was no evidence of collaboration or knowledge of the other's presence within the system. Rather, the "two Russian espionage groups compromised the same systems and engaged separately in the theft of identical credentials".&lt;ref name=alperovitch/&gt;&lt;ref name=ecfr/&gt;&lt;ref name=npr&gt;

at various times and in various DNC systems. "Fancy Bear" employed [[X Agent (spyware)|X Agent]] malware, which enabled distant [[command (computing)|command execution]], [[file transfer|transmissions of files]] and [[keylogging]], as well as the "X-Tunnel" malware.

DNC leaders became aware of the compromise in April 2016. These attacks broadly reflect Russian government interest in the U.S. political system, as well as political leaders' policies, tendencies and  proclivities while assessing possible beneficial outcomes. The attacks also broadly reflect Russian government interest in the strategies, policies, and practices of the U.S. Government. This also globally reflects foreign governments' interest in ascertaining information on Donald Trump as a new entry into U.S. political leadership roles, in contrast to information likely to have been garnered over the decades pertaining to the Clintons.&lt;ref name=nakashima/&gt;&lt;ref name=alperovitch/&gt;

The DNC commissioned the cybersecurity company, [[CrowdStrike]], to defeat the intrusions. Its [[Chief Technology Officer]], [[Dmitri Alperovitch]], who is also a cybersecurity expert, stated:

{{quote|CrowdStrike stands fully by its analysis and findings identifying two separate Russian intelligence-affiliated adversaries present in the DNC network in May 2016[...] We've had lots of experience with both of these actors attempting to target our customers in the past and know them well. In fact, our team considers them some of the best adversaries out of all the numerous nation-state, criminal and hacktivist/terrorist groups we encounter on a daily basis. Their [[tradecraft]] is superb, [[operational security]] second to none and the extensive usage of 'living-off-the-land' techniques enables them to easily bypass many security solutions they encounter.&lt;ref name=alperovitch/&gt;}}

[[File:Portrait of Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon]], after whom the Edward Grey Institute is named.]]
The '''Edward Grey Institute of Field Ornithology''' ('''EGI'''), at [[Oxford University]] in [[England]], is an academic body that conducts research in [[ornithology]] and the general field of [[evolutionary ecology]] and [[conservation biology]], with an emphasis on understanding organisms in natural environments. It is named in honour of [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon]], a notable politician and ornithologist, and is part of the [[Department of Zoology, University of Oxford|Department of Zoology]] at Oxford University.

The Institute houses the [[Alexander Library]], the best ornithological library in [[Europe]] and one of the best in the world, which is named after [[Wilfred Backhouse Alexander|W. B. Alexander]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://libguides.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/alexanderlibrary |title=Alexander Library of Ornithology Guide: Home |website=[[Bodleian Library]] |accessdate=22 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Edward Grey Institute (EGI) was founded in 1938, having grown out of the Oxford Bird Census, itself founded in 1927. It was the brainchild of [[Max Nicholson]], [[Bernard Tucker]], and [[Wilfred Backhouse Alexander|Wilfred ('W. B.') Alexander]], and was initially founded to promote the economic study of ornithology. It took its name from [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Viscount Grey]], at one time [[Chancellor of the University of Oxford|Chancellor of the University]] and [[UK Foreign Secretary]], and a lifelong birdwatcher, perhaps best known as the man who remarked, on the eve of the [[First World War]]: "The lamps are going out all over Europe; we shall not see them lit again in our lifetime."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9038083/Sir-Edward-Grey-3rd-Baronet Sir Edward Grey, 3rd Baronet] [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] Article. Other common versions of the quote are:
* ''The lights are going out all over Europe and I doubt we will see them go on again in our lifetime''. (Sources: [http://www.doi.gov.mt/EN/commentaries/2004/05/tim01.asp Malta in Europe – a new dawn] Department of Information – Government of Malta, 2000–2006. Ambassador [[Guenter Burghardt]] [http://www.eurunion.org/news/speeches/2003/030604gb.htm The State of the Transatlantic Relationship] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001235943/http://www.eurunion.org/news/speeches/2003/030604gb.htm |date=2006-10-01 }}, 4 June 2003.)

&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Director of the fledgling Institute was W. B. Alexander, remembered in the name of the EGI's library, the Alexander Library. Alexander was succeeded in 1945 by former school-teacher [[David Lack]], one of the pioneers of [[population biology]], who had already published ''The Life of the Robin''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} Lack served as Director until his death in 1973, working with field assistants such as [[Denis Owen]], and oversaw the growth of the EGI into an internationally known centre for research into population biology of birds.

Lack was succeeded by [[Chris Perrins]] in 1974, who continued as Director until his official retirement in 2002.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} During this time, work in the EGI expanded from the field of population biology to encompass the new field of [[behavioural ecology]], with [[John Krebs]] and Nick Davies (then at Oxford, later Professor of Behavioural Ecology at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]) co-authoring the textbooks that defined the field. The EGI was also the centre for work on ''[[The Birds of the Western Palearctic]]'', up to its completion in 1990s, and became increasingly important as a training centre for ornithologists who went on to play important roles in conservation.

Following Perrins' retirement, a major endowment in honour of Dr [[Luc Hoffmann]]'s eightieth birthday led to the establishment of the Luc Hoffmann Chair in Field Ornithology.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} [[Ben Sheldon]] was elected as the first holder of this chair, and as Director of the EGI in 2004.

By the end of 2006, a total of 165 DPhil students had successfully defended their theses based on work carried out at the EGI; this number is at least matched by the number of postdoctoral and other research visitors who have spent time at the Institute.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} Scientific research work on birds has been conducted on all continents and the major research themes of the EGI, population and evolutionary ecology of birds have been supplemented by a very wide range of research activities.

'''Foam lines''' are accumulations of [[foam]], with trapped insects, [[exuvia]], etc. found on the surface of freshwater water courses or bodies.&lt;ref name=l&gt;[http://www.lovetheoutdoors.com/freshwater-fishing/Stream-Characteristics/Foam-Lines.html Love the Outdoors] Retrieved : 2013-10-21&lt;/ref&gt; Lines appear as individual islands of foam that accumulate against obstructions, shorelines, etc.&lt;ref name=w/&gt; Foam lines have some characteristics in common with [[sea foam]] from the marine environment which may form lines of spume as the tides rise and fall.

==Characteristics==
===Foam lines===
[[File:River Deveron - geograph.org.uk - 1721017.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Ice sheet and 'ice pancakes' on the [[River Deveron]].]]
Most foam is very light, white to start with, often turning brown after a period of time if sediment builds up and forms discernible lines as individual mats accumulate.&lt;ref name=w/&gt; Foam lines are usually non-toxic.&lt;ref name=a/&gt; Natural foam may have an earthy or fishy smell and is white, off-white, becoming brownish;&lt;ref name=w/&gt; characteristically it breaks apart with comparative ease when disturbed.&lt;ref name=w/&gt;

===Ice pancakes===
Dinner plate sized 'ice pancake' discs are sometimes seen in the winter and can reportedly have a thickness of up to 3.9 inches with a diameter of 12 inches to 9ft. It is thought that the foam lines on the water freeze at night with the current causing repeated collisions against each other to eventually become circular with a distinct rim. When the temperatures fall again fresh foam is added so that existing 'pancakes' enlarge and new ones form.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKvwzXfQM-4 Ice Pancakes on the River Dee, Scotland] Retrieved : 24-12-14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
[[Dissolved organic carbon]] (DOC) compounds include natural organic surfactants which reduce the surface tension of water and permit the formation of foam bubbles. DOCs derived from decomposing algae and other plants in water courses are one important source, however DOCs derived from bogs and wetlands are very important. Brown-water streams with brown water contain high levels of DOC and much of the foam forms after snowmelt, after prolonged heavy rains and in autumn.&lt;ref name=a/&gt; The foam decreases quickly when water flow reduces.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;
 
;Natural pollution
[[File:Foam lines on the Veil Burn.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Detail of the foam]]
[[File:Leptothrix discophora oil film.JPG|thumb|An oily sheen of 'Iron Bacteria' that contribute to the formation of Foam Lines.]] 
Foam lines are found on stream and river surfaces and banks when water is strongly mixed with air at waterfalls and where rocky substrates have fast currents of water passing over them.&lt;ref name=a/&gt; Loch or lake shores accumulate foam lines due to waves breaking against rocky substrates and outcrops.&lt;ref name=w/&gt;&lt;ref name=a&gt;[http://www.arrialaska.org/foam-in-streams.html Aquatic Restoration &amp; Research Institute] Retrieved : 2013-10-21&lt;/ref&gt; As stated, decaying plants and animals release dissolved organic compounds and these compounds lessen the surface tension of water to create the bubbles that adhere together to form the foam.&lt;ref name=w&gt;[http://www.umaine.edu/waterresearch/fieldguide/onthewater.htm#foam A Field Guide to Aquatic Phenomena] Retrieved : 2013-10-21&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike with man made pollution the foam lines are found along long stretches as no one source exists.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;

;Man made pollution
The reduction of effluents from wastewater treatment plants and the introduction of biodegradable detergents have greatly reduced the incidence of pollution-related foam, the presence of which can be ascertained by a fragrant or perfume-like smell.&lt;ref name=w/&gt; The foam lines are restricted to the part of the water course in the vicinity of the source of the pollution.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;

==Biotic and abiotic effects==
Stillborn, emerging and drowned terrestrial insects progressively accumulate within foam lines in summer, trapped and held in place by the surface tension of the bubbles within. These dense foam lines restrict the penetration of sunlight.&lt;ref name=l/&gt;

The foam lines vary in thickness and this creates an overhead shelter that protects fish and insects from birds and other 'above surface' predators.&lt;ref name=l/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4598">The '''Global Network for Advanced Management''' is a collaboration of [[graduate school]]s of business that seeks to foster intellectual ties among [[business school]]s, students and deans&lt;ref name="GlobeandMail"&gt;[http://m.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/careers/business-education/b-schools-create-alliance-to-prosper-in-a-global-market/article4170273/?service=mobile B-schools create alliance to prosper in a global market]. ''The Globe and Mail''.&lt;/ref&gt; from both economically strong regions and those on the horizon of [[economic development]]. It was founded by a consortium of 21 schools and launched on April 27, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.advancedmanagement.net/#missionSub1 {{Failed verification|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Global Network has since expanded to include 30 member schools.&lt;ref name="advancedmanagement.net"&gt;http://advancedmanagement.net/whos&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==
The Global Network for Advanced Management was founded on the premise that enterprises need leaders who understand how markets and organizations work in increasingly diverse and complex contexts.&lt;ref name="GNFAM"&gt;[http://www.advancedmanagement.net/ Global Network for Advanced Management&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The network provides an organizational structure to facilitates connections among faculty, students, and alumni from diverse regions, cultures, and economies in different phases of development. Chief goals are the exchange of ideas, collaboration on [[data collection]], and the promotion of research in areas of interest to global [[commerce]]. Member schools share course materials, including [[Case study|case studies]] that incorporate specialized regional expertise.

==Activities==
The Global Network is a platform for innovation, hosting programs that include Global Network Weeks, which give students at network schools the opportunity to travel to another Network school for a one-week intensive mini-course that takes advantage of localized expertise;&lt;ref&gt;http://advancedmanagement.net/programs/network-weeks&lt;/ref&gt; Global Network Courses, online graduate-level business courses that connect students at member schools in group project work;&lt;ref&gt;http://advancedmanagement.net/programs/global-network-courses&lt;/ref&gt; and Global Network cases, teaching materials that examine business challenges from the points of view of at least two Global Network regions.&lt;ref&gt;http://advancedmanagement.net/cases&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, the Global Network hosted two sessions at "Business + Society: Leadership in an Increasingly Complex World," a conference at the [[Yale School of Management]]. Deans and directors from nine Global Network schools discussed the skills they believed critical to leaders with moderator [[Margaret Warner]] in a panel entitled "Preparing Leaders for a Flatter World."&lt;ref&gt;http://som.yale.edu/our-approach/edward-p-evans-hall/opening-events/business-society-leadership-increasingly-complex-world/preparing-leaders-flatter-world&lt;/ref&gt; Faculty, deans, and students from three network schools participated in "Bank of Ireland: A Raw Case Study" with American investor [[Wilbur Ross]].&lt;ref&gt;http://som.yale.edu/our-approach/edward-p-evans-hall/opening-events/business-society-leadership-increasingly-complex-world/bank-ireland-raw-case-study&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members==
The network includes graduate management schools on six continents, with members in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Costa Rica, France, Germany, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, Nicaragua, Nigeria, the Philippines, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States.&lt;ref name="advancedmanagement.net"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9884">[[Image:ViennaDioscoridesAuthorPortrait.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The ''[[Vienna Dioscurides]]'' manuscript of ''[[De Materia Medica]]'', from the early sixth century, is one of the oldest herbals in existence. [[Dioscorides]] wrote the book between 50 and 60 AD.]]

The '''history of plant systematics'''&amp;mdash;the [[biological classification]] of [[plant]]s&amp;mdash;stretches from the work of ancient Greek to modern [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologists]].  As a field of science, plant systematics came into being only slowly, early plant lore usually being treated as part of the study of medicine.  Later, classification and description was driven by [[natural history]] and [[natural theology]]. Until the advent of [[Evolution|the theory of evolution]], nearly all classification was based on the [[scala naturae]].  The professionalization of botany in the 18th and 19th century marked a shift toward more holistic classification methods, eventually based on evolutionary relationships.

==Antiquity==

The Sushrut (800-1000 BC) (Indian Scholar of ayurveda) first classify plant in 4 categories on basis of flowering pattern structure and life span.  
(1) vanspataya (2) Vruksha () (3) Virudh (4) Aushodh
तासां स्थावराश्चतुर्विधाः- वनस्पतयो, वृक्षा, वीरुध, ओषधय इति |
तासु, अपुष्पाः फलवन्तो वनस्पतयः, पुष्पफलवन्तो वृक्षाः, प्रतानवत्यः स्तम्बिन्यश्च वीरुधः, फलपाकनिष्ठा ओषधय इति ||Sushrut Sutra 1/21|| &lt;&lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushruta&gt;&gt;

The [[peripatetic philosophy|peripatetic philosopher]] [[Theophrastus]] (372–287 BC), as a student of  [[Aristotle]] in [[Ancient Greece]], wrote ''[[Historia Plantarum (Theophrastus)|Historia Plantarum]]'', the earliest surviving treatise on plants, where he listed the names of over 500 plant species.&lt;ref name="est"&gt;''Concise Encyclopedia Of Science And Technology'', McGraw-Hill&lt;/ref&gt; He did not articulate a formal classification scheme, but relied on the common groupings of [[folk taxonomy]] combined with growth form: tree shrub; undershrub; or herb.

The ''[[De Materia Medica (Dioscorides)|De Materia Medica]]'' of [[Dioscorides]] was an important early compendium of plant descriptions (over five hundred), classifying plants chiefly by their medicinal effects; it was in use from its publication in the 1st century until the 16th century, making it the major [[herbal]] throughout the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name="Mayr"&gt;{{cite book | last = Mayr | first = Ernst | title = The Growth of Biological Thought: Diversity, Evolution, and Inheritance | publisher = The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Great Naturalists | publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson, with the Natural History Museum | author=Sutton, David; Robert Huxley (editor) | year=2007 | location=London | pages=32–37 | chapter=Pedanios Dioscorides: Recording the Medicinal Uses of Plants | isbn=978-0-500-25139-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early modern period==

In the 16th century, works by [[Otto Brunfels]], [[Hieronymus Bock]], and [[Leonhart Fuchs]] helped to revive interest in natural history based on first-hand observation; Bock in particular included environmental and life cycle information in his descriptions. With the influx of exotic species in the [[Age of Exploration]], the number of known species expanded rapidly, but most authors were far more interested in the medicinal properties of individual plants than an overarching classification system. Later influential Renaissance books include those of [[Caspar Bauhin]] and [[Andrea Cesalpino]]. Bauhin described over 6000 plants, which he arranged into 12 books and 72 sections based on a wide range of common characteristics. Cesalpino based his system on the structure of the organs of fructification, using the Aristotelian technique of [[Arbor porphyriana|logical division]].&lt;ref name="Mayr"/&gt;

In the late 17th century, the most influential classification schemes were those of English botanist and natural theologian [[John Ray]] and French botanist [[Joseph Pitton de Tournefort]]. Ray, who listed over 18,000 plant species in his works, is credited with establishing the [[monocot]]/[[dicot]] division and some of his groups — [[Brassicaceae|mustards]], [[Lamiaceae|mints]], [[Fabaceae|legumes]] and [[Poaceae|grasses]] — stand today (though under modern family names). Tournefort used an artificial system based on logical division which was widely adopted in France and elsewhere in Europe up until Linnaeus.&lt;ref name="Mayr"/&gt;

The book that had an enormous accelerating effect on the science of plant systematics was ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' (1753) by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]]. It presented a complete list of the plant species then known to Europe,&lt;ref name="est" /&gt; ordered for the purpose of easy identification using the number and arrangement of the male and female sexual organs of the plants. Of the groups in this book, the highest rank that continues to be used today is the [[genus]]. The consistent use of [[binomial nomenclature]] along with a complete listing of all plants provided a huge stimulus for the field.

Although meticulous, the classification of Linnaeus served merely as an identification manual; it was based on [[phenetics]] and did not regard evolutionary relationships among species.&lt;ref name="est" /&gt; It assumed that plant species were given by God and that what remained for humans was to recognise them and use them (a Christian reformulation of the ''scala naturae'' or ''Great Chain of Being''). Linnaeus was quite aware that the arrangement of species in the  ''Species Plantarum'' was not a natural system, i.e. did not express relationships. However he did present some ideas of plant relationships elsewhere.

==Modern and Contemporary periods==

Significant contributions to plant classification came from [[de Jussieu system|de Jussieu]] (inspired by the work of [[Adanson]]) in 1789 and the early nineteenth century saw the start of work by de Candolle, culminating in the ''Prodromus''.

A major influence on plant systematics was the theory of [[evolution]] ([[Charles Darwin]] published ''[[Origin of Species]]'' in 1859), resulting in the aim to group plants by their [[phylogenetic]] relationships. To this was added the interest in [[plant anatomy]], aided by the use of the [[light microscope]] and the rise of chemistry, allowing the analysis of [[secondary metabolites]].

Currently, the strict use of epithets in botany, although regulated by international codes, is considered unpractical and outdated. The very notion of [[species]], the fundamental classification unit, is often up to subjective intuition and thus can not be well defined. As a result, estimate of the total number of existing "species" (ranging from 2 million to 100 million) becomes a matter of preference.&lt;ref name="est" /&gt;

While scientists have agreed for some time that a functional and objective classification system must reflect actual evolutionary processes and genetic relationships, the technological means for creating such a system did not exist until recently. In the 1990s DNA technology saw immense progress, resulting in unprecedented accumulation of [[DNA sequencing|DNA sequence data]] from various genes present in compartments of plant cells. In 1998 a ground-breaking classification of the angiosperms (the [[APG system]]) consolidated [[molecular phylogenetics]] (and especially [[cladistics]] or '''phylogenetic systematics''') as the best available method. For the first time relatedness could be measured in real terms, namely similarity of the molecules comprising the genetic code.&lt;ref name="est" /&gt;

[[File:How to draw manga.jpg|thumb|The cover of ''How to Draw Manga: Bodies &amp; Anatomy'']]
'''''How to Draw Manga''''' is a series of instructional books on drawing [[manga]] published by Graphic-sha, by a variety of authors. Originally in Japanese for the Japanese market, many volumes have been translated into English and published in the United States. Of the wide range of manga-how-tos available for westerners, the series is seen as one of the more useful, both for its provenance and wide range of practical tips.{{ref|twoeasylessons}} The English-language volumes in the series were co-produced by Graphic-sha and two other Japanese companies, Japanime Co. Ltd. and Japan Publications Trading Co.

== List of books in the series ==
This is a list of books in the main ''HTDM'' set and other sets that relate to the main series.

=== ''How to Draw Manga'' ===
Originally there were no volume numbers on the English versions, because the original [[Japanese language|Japanese]] version did not have them. Only volumes 1 - 8 were given numbers. With continued reprints and more books being released, all volumes gained a number. The dates given are the first printing. Several of these books have been discontinued, and are considered hard to find. 
&lt;!--all were given volume numbers with reprints, do not change them please, thank you--&gt;
&lt;!--I have been following this series since 1999 and own almost every book in it. (some Japanese and many English, 1st printings) The dates are straight out of the books, used the ones I own for reference, others I researched.--&gt;

'''Infant sleep training''' refers to a number of different regimens parents employ to adjust their child's sleep behaviors.

==The development of sleep over the first year==

During the first year of life, infants spend most of their time in the sleeping state. Assessment of sleep during infancy presents an opportunity to study the impact of sleep on the maturation of the [[central nervous system]] (CNS), overall functioning, and future cognitive, psychomotor, and temperament development. Sleep is essential to human life and involves both physiologic and behavioral processes. Sleep is now understood as not simply a resting state, but a state that involves intense brain activity.&lt;ref&gt;Carskadon MA, Dement WC. Normal human sleep: an overview. In: Kryger MH, Roth T, Dement WC, editors. Principles and practice of sleep medicine. 4th ed. Philadelphia: Elsevier Saunders; 2005. pp. 13–23.&lt;/ref&gt;
The first year of life is a time of substantial change in the development of both the human brain and sleep. The relationship between the two is vital, as the control of sleep and the sleep-wake cycle are regulated by the CNS.&lt;ref name='Sheldon 1996'&gt;Sheldon SH. In: Evaluating sleep in infants and children. Philadelphia: Lippincott-Raven; 1996. Development of CNS function; pp.&amp;nbsp;71–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''long sustained sleep period (LSP)'' is the period of time that a child sleeps without awaking.  The length of this period increases dramatically between the first and second months. Between the ages of three and twenty-one months, LSP plateaus, increasing on average only about 30 minutes.&lt;ref name = "henderson"&gt;Henderson, J.M.T., France, K.G. &amp; Blampied, N.M. (2010). The consolidation of infants' nocturnal sleep across the first year of life. Sleep Medicine Reviews, 15 (4), 211-220.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, a child’s ''longest self-regulated sleep period (LSRSP)'' is the period of time where a child, without sleep problems, is able to self-initiate sleep without parental intervention upon waking.&lt;ref name = "henderson"/&gt; This self-regulation, also called ‘’’self-soothing’’’, allows the child to consistently use these skills during the nocturnal period. LSRSP dramatically increases in length over the first 4 months, plateaus, and then steadily increases at 9 months. By about 6 months, most infants can sleep 8 hours or more at night uninterrupted or without parental intervention upon awaking.&lt;ref name = "henderson"/&gt;

In terms of actual numbers, an infant from one to three months of age may sleep sixteen to eighteen hours a day in periods that last from three to four hours. By three months the period of sleep lengthens to about four or five hours, with a decrease in the total sleep time to about fourteen or fifteen hours. At three months, they also start to sleep when it is dark and wake when it is light. By 4 months there are 2 distinct napping periods, mid-morning and late afternoon. By 6 months the longest LSP is 6 hours and occurs during the night. There are two 3-or-more hour naps with a total average sleep time of fourteen hours.&lt;ref name = "Yale" &gt;Mayes, L.C. &amp; Cohen, D.J. (2002). The Yale Child Study Center Guide to Understand Your Child. United States: Little, Brown and Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though sleep is a primarily biological process, it can be treated as a behavior. This means that it can be altered and managed through practice and can be learned by the child. Healthy sleep habits can be established during the first four months to lay a foundation for healthy sleep. These habits typically include sleeping in a crib (instead of a car seat, stroller, or swing), being put down to sleep drowsy but awake, and avoiding negative sleep associations, such as nursing to sleep or using a pacifier to fall asleep, which may be hard to break in the future.&lt;ref name="Yale"/&gt;

Every child is different and each child’s sleep becomes regular at different ages within a particular range. In the first few months of life, each time the baby is laid down for bed and each time he or she awakens is an opportunity for the infant to learn sleep self-initiation and to fall asleep without excessive external help from their caregiver.
Experts say that the ideal bedtime for an infant falls between 6 pm and 8 pm, with the ideal wake-up time falling between 6 am and 7 am. At four months of age, infants typically take hour naps two to three times a day, with the third nap dropped by about 9 months. By 1 year of age, the amount of sleep that most infants get nightly approximates to that of adults.&lt;ref name="Yale"/&gt;

== Good sleep conditions ==
Many parents try to understand, once the baby is asleep, how to keep them sleeping through the night. It is thought that it is important to have structure in the way a child is put to sleep so that he or she can establish good sleeping patterns.&lt;ref name="Yale"/&gt; Dr Sylvia Bell of Johns Hopkins University reported:&lt;ref name="Bell"&gt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/1127506?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents&lt;/ref&gt; by the end of the first year individual differences in crying reflect the history of maternal responsiveness rather than constitutional differences in infant irritability. She also notes: consistency and promptness of maternal response is associated with decline in frequency and duration of infant crying. The sleep position is also important to prevent SIDS ([[Sudden infant death syndrome|Sudden Infant Death Syndrome]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://medlineplus.gov/suddeninfantdeathsyndrome.html|title=Sudden Infant Death Syndrome: MedlinePlus|access-date=2017-10-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies in sleep training==

A key debate in sleep training revolves around getting the right balance between parental soothing and teaching the baby to self-soothe. Parents who practice attachment parenting think the parent should attend to the baby whenever he or she cries, and limit tears as much as possible.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} However, many popular sleep training methods, such as the [[Ferber Method]] rely on letting the baby "cry it out" for a certain number of minutes, so that so-called "self-soothing" skills are fostered instead of an over-reliance upon externally-provided soothing. The Ferber method has been criticized by some for being harsh, but sleep scientists have yet to find evidence of it causing lasting harm to a child. &lt;ref&gt;Storrs, Carina [http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/24/health/cry-it-out-sleep-training-ok/ "It's OK to let your baby cry himself to sleep, study finds"], ''[[CNN]]''.  Retrieved on 2 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some psychologists say the sleep scientists are failing to take into account the subtle psychological effects of being left alone to cry yourself out: they say: "The fact is that caregivers who habitually respond to the needs of the baby before the baby gets distressed, preventing crying, are more likely to have children who are independent than the opposite. Soothing care is best from the outset. Once patterns of distress get established, it's much harder to change them."&lt;ref&gt;Narvaez, Darcia Ph.D.  [https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/moral-landscapes/201112/dangers-crying-it-out "Dangers of “Crying It Out"], ''[[Psychology Today]]''.  Retrieved on 2 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}}

Baby soothing techniques include bouncing, jiggling, rocking baby while sitting in a rocking chair, doing knee bends while holding them, doing comfort feeding, providing them with a pacifier, using a white noise machine or app, swaddling them, skin-to-skin contact, using a bouncer or swing to mechanically rock them, and more. Some parents reject the use of most or all baby soothing techniques under the idea that you should teach a baby to self-soothe. Other parents think having devices such as white noise machines and swings are crucial because they allow the parents' to take breaks and get things done other than just holding their baby.

Another method is [[Sleep disorder|Behavioral Infant Sleep Intervention]] to effectively reduce infant sleep problems and associated maternal depression in the short- to medium-terms. This method randomized tried and found effective though, despite their effectiveness, theoretical concerns persist about long-term harm on children’s emotional development, stress regulation, mental health, and the child-parent relationship &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Price|first=Anna M. H.|last2=Wake|first2=Melissa|last3=Ukoumunne|first3=Obioha C.|last4=Hiscock|first4=Harriet|date=2012-10-01|title=Five-Year Follow-up of Harms and Benefits of Behavioral Infant Sleep Intervention: Randomized Trial|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/130/4/643|journal=Pediatrics|language=en|volume=130|issue=4|pages=643–651|doi=10.1542/peds.2011-3467|issn=0031-4005|pmid=22966034}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This method proves to be causing no long-lasting harms or benefits to child, child-parent, or maternal outcomes. Parents and health professionals can feel comfortable about using these techniques to reduce the population burden of infant sleep problems and maternal depression.

== Other influences on infant sleep ==

A number of factors have been shown to be associated with problems in sleep consolidation, including a child’s temperament, the degree to which s/he is breast-fed vs. bottle-fed, and his/her activities and sleepiness during the day.  Moreover, co-sleeping, which is defined here as sharing a room or bed with parents or siblings in response to an awakening, can be detrimental to sleep consolidation. It is important to note that none of these factors have been directly shown to cause children’s sleep consolidation issues. 
In terms of infant feeding, breastfeeding has been found to be associated with more waking at night than bottle-fed infants because of the infant’s ability to digest breast milk more quickly than formula.  Thus, breast-fed infants have been observed to begin sleeping through the night at a later age than bottle-fed infants: bottle fed infants tend to begin sleeping through the night between 6–8 weeks, while breastfed infants may take until 17 weeks before sleeping through the night.  Seventeen weeks of age is still within the first 4–5 months of the infants’ life; therefore, this cannot really be considered a delay in sleep consolidation.  There are many benefits to breastfeeding infants. 
Lastly, temperament also seems to yield correlations with sleep patterns. Researchers believe that infants classified as “difficult,” as well as those who are very sensitive to changes in the environment, tend to have a harder time sleeping through the night. Parents whose infants sleep through the night generally rate their infant’s temperaments more favorably than parents whose infant continue to wake; however, it is hard to determine if a given temperament causes sleep problems or if sleep problems promote specific temperaments or behaviors.&lt;ref name = "Pinilla"&gt;Pinilla, T. &amp; Birch, L. (1993). Help me make it through the night: Behavioral entertainment of breast-fed infants’ sleep patterns. Pediatrics 91 (2), 436-444.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{sexual orientation}}'''Innate bisexuality''' (or ''predisposition to bisexuality'') is a term introduced by [[Sigmund Freud]] (based on work by his associate [[Wilhelm Fliess]]), that expounds all humans are born [[bisexuality|bisexual]] but through psychological development (which includes both external and internal factors) most become [[monosexuality|monosexual]] while the bisexuality remains in a latent state.&lt;ref name=Huffpost&gt;{{cite web|last1=Packman|first1=Carl|title=Gore Vidal: 'We are all Bisexual'|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/carl-packman/gore-vidal-we-are-all-bis_b_1729265.html|website=huffingtonpost.co.uk|publisher=Huffpost Culture|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Christopher Carey|title=Trials from Classical Athens|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=406CCTn4AAQC&amp;pg=PA1101&amp;dq=freud+innate+bisexuality&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6KwVT9-WCeHz0gHxv_n_Ag&amp;redir_esc=y|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no modern scientific consensus as to how biology influences sexual orientation (see [[biology and sexual orientation]]).

== ''Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex'' ==
In his ''Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex'' (1920), Freud discusses the concept of ''inversion'' (i.e. [[homosexuality]]) with respect to its ''innateness'', or the biological predisposition to homosexuality or bisexuality.

The conclusions that he draws are based on the fact that at early stages of development, humans undergo a period of [[hermaphrodism]]. Based on this, he asserts that, "the conception which we gather from this long known anatomical fact is the original predisposition to [[bisexuality]], which in the course of development has changed to monosexuality, leaving slight remnants of the stunted sex."

This develops into a general theory that attraction to both sexes is possible, but that one is more common for each sex. He explains the inversion of homosexual attraction as the result of a traumatic episode or episodes that prevent the normal development of an attraction for the opposite sex.

Freud famously characterized humans as naturally "polymorphously perverse," meaning either that practically any object can be a source of erotic fulfillment, or that babies are relatively indifferent to the object of erotic fulfillment.

== Different usages ==
Many modern uses of the term ''innate bisexuality'' are more indicative of [[Alfred Kinsey]]'s research than Freud's. In this sense, it is a suggestion that most or all human beings are functionally bisexual to some degree, but may not express that bisexuality as behavior.

Both theories have a great deal of controversy surrounding them, so it is particularly important to be aware of which is being discussed.

== Dora ==
"[[Dora (case study)|Dora]]" was Ida Bauer (1882–1945), a patient of Freud's. He used the [[pseudonym]] Dora when writing about their sessions. Often the theory of innate bisexuality is discussed in association with Freud's sessions with Dora.

== Wolf Man ==
Another study often associated with this theory is that of the "[[Sergei Pankejeff|Wolf Man]]", a patient who tried to repress his homosexual tendencies. Freud explained the Wolf Man's development in terms of an inability to repress his innate feminine nature.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7426">The '''Institute of Atmospheric Physics AS CR''', also designated as the '''IAP''',  is part of the [[Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic]] '''(AS CR)'''.  Within the IAP research institutions are combined in order to cover the whole field of [[science]] and [[humanities]].

The IAP was established in 1964, developed from a previously existing institute.  This former institute's main focus was observation, and interpretation of data of [[tropospheric]] processes. In 1994 another former institute joined the IAP which then extended its [[research]] purview to the entire [[atmosphere]], from the [[boundary layer]] up to [[interplanetary space]]. In 2007-2008 the IAP organized several international workshops and meetings.

The institute is staffed by 111 persons (2008) and forty percent of those hold the PhD degree or its equivalent. Throughout the years staff members have published research in a variety of international and national [[peer review]]ed journals, as well as various books, chapters in books, and [[monographs]].  Also, the IAP participates in international research programs, and many international research projects. For example it participates in the Climate and Weather of the Sun-Earth System (CAWSES) program, and the GEO-6 (Galileo for Scientific User Community) research project.&lt;ref name=desribe-info/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ufa.cas.cz/en/publications.html List of Publications 1992 - 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science investigations==
Scientific investigation for the IAP is defined by the vertical extent of the atmosphere. Types of investigations include [[theory|theoretical models]], [[numerical simulation]], and [[experiment]] for the Earth's [[boundary layer]], [[troposphere]], [[atmosphere|middle atmosphere]], [[ionosphere]] and [[magnetosphere]].&lt;ref name=desribe-info/&gt;

The main research topic areas currently include mesoscale, dynamical, and applied [[meteorology]]. Furthermore, the processes of the atmospheric boundary layer are also of interest.  In addition,  climate variability and [[climate change]] are studied. Other research is conducted that concerns the [[ozone]], along with the previously mentioned ionosphere and magnetosphere. Regarding these upper atmosphere domains, the IAP conducts its own [[satellite]] experiments. Other research extends into space [[plasma physics]]  and solar-terrestrial interactions.&lt;ref name=desribe-info&gt;

==Department of Climatology==
The Department of Climatology of the IAP is concerned with two broad research areas. These are climate change research, and statistical climatology.&lt;ref name=Dep-Clim&gt;

{{Cite web| last=Kyselý| first=Jan| author2=Dagmar Novotná (head of department)| title=Department of Climatology (IAP)| date=2010-02-02 | url=http://www.ufa.cas.cz/html/climaero/| format =| accessdate=2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate change research===
Climate change research includes the observation, analysis, and establishing trends regarding the variations of long-term  extreme warm and cold temperature phenomena in central and south-eastern Europe. Of note is a prevailing warming trend when analysing both the warm and cold events during the 20th century. Also of note are changes in the atmospheric circulation patterns. [[Global Circulation Model]] (GCM) outputs are related to the region of the Czech Republic and central Europe. In addition, this department is developing a ''Regional Climate Model'' in conjunction with another Czech institute and [[Charles University]]. Included in this departments work are impact assessments by constructing climate change scenarios for selected experimental units in the Czech Republic.&lt;ref name=clim-chg-res&gt;{{Cite web

  | accessdate =2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statistical climatology===
Various validated statistical models and predictors are employed which provide a platform for research in climate change.  These include ''extreme value analysis'', ''non-linear time series analysis'', ''statistical downscaling'', and the ''stochastic weather generator''.

===Research projects===
The Department of Climatology is involved in research projects listed from ''starting in 2004'' to ''starting in 2008''. Some of the titles are as follows:&lt;ref name=Dep-Clim/&gt;

====2008====
* Probabilistic climate scenarios for the Czech Republic.
* Extraterrestrial effects on atmospheric circulation in mid and high latitudes.
* Effect of climate variability and meteorological extremes on the production of selected crops between 1801 and 2007.&lt;ref name=Dep-Clim/&gt;

====2007====
* Meteorological causes and human mortality impacts of extreme hot weather in summer: a comparative study.
* Effects of short-term and long-term variability of weather on mortality.&lt;ref name=Dep-Clim/&gt;

====2006====
* Central and Eastern Europe Climate Change Impacts and Vulnerability Assessment (CECILIA).
* Climate change impacts on the crop growth and development of selected crops.&lt;ref name=Dep-Clim/&gt;

==Department of Space Physics==

==IASA aims==
The IASA constitution &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iasa-web.org/iasa-constitution IASA constitution]&lt;/ref&gt;  states the following purposes: 
* To strengthen co-operation between archives and other institutions which preserve sound and audiovisual documents.
* To initiate and encourage activities that develop and improve the organisation, administration and contents of recorded sound and audiovisual collections, and, in pursuance of these aims, to co-operate with other organisations in related fields.
* To study all techniques relevant to the work of sound and audiovisual archives and other institutions which preserve these documents and to disseminate the results of such study on an international scale.
* To encourage, on an international level, the exchange of sound and audiovisual documents and of literature and information relating to these documents.
* To stimulate and further by every means the preservation, documentation and dissemination of all recorded sound and audiovisual collections.

==Membership==
IASA has members from more than 70 countries representing a broad palette of audiovisual archives and personal interests which are distinguished by their focus on particular subjects and areas, for example: archives for all sorts of musical recordings, historic, literary, folkloric and ethnological sound documents, theatre productions and oral history interviews, bio-acoustics, environmental and medical sounds, linguistic and dialect recordings, as well as recordings for forensic purposes.

==IASA activities==
IASA promotes the open and ongoing exchange of ideas and information on current issues in the audiovisual field via annual conferences, an IASA Journal, [http://www.iasa-web.org/listserv list-serve] and the IASA web site.

==Annual conferences==
IASA has held a conference each year since its inception, sometimes in partnership with related organisations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iasa-web.org/past-conferences IASA conferences]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2010, IASA and the [[Association of Moving Image Archivists]] (AMIA) came together for the first time in a [http://2010.iasa-conference.com/ joint IASA-AMIA conference] held in Philadelphia, USA. With more than 750 participants and more than 100 presentations and lectures this was one of the biggest conferences in the audiovisual archiving field ever. The [http://2013.iasa-web.org/ 2013 conference] in Vilnius, Lithuania, was held in association with the Baltic Audiovisual Archival Council. The [http://2019.iasa-web.org/ 2019 conference] will be in Amsterdam, Netherlands.

==Publications==
IASA follows closely the progress of technology and members can call upon a pool of expertise for help and advice on various aspects, ranging from digitisation to metadata to technical issues. In this regard, IASA has published a number of [https://www.iasa-web.org/iasa-special-and-technical-publications special publications]:
* ''The Safeguarding of the Audio Heritage: Ethics, Principles and Preservation Strategy'' (IASA-TC 03)
* ''Guidelines on the Production and Preservation of Digital Audio Objects'' (IASA-TC 04)
* ''Handling and Storage of Audio and Video Carriers'' (IASA-TC 05)
* ''IASA Cataloguing Rules'' (also a Spanish version as ''Reglas de Catalogación de IASA'')
* ''Task Force on Selection for Digital Transfer''.
* ''Ethical Principles for Sound and Audiovisual Archives''

An initial version of video digitisation and preservation standards, ''Guidelines for the Preservation of Video Recordings'' (IASA-TC 06), was published in 2018.

==Awards and grants==
The organisation issues awards for outstanding contributions to the profession of sound and audiovisual archiving, as well as financial support for research and for participating in annual conferences:
* Since 2004 the IASA Award of Recognition for outstanding service has been awarded each year to an IASA member  
* The status of Honorary Member of IASA is awarded to individuals as a mark of special service in the work of sound and audiovisual archives
* Travel Awards are awarded annually to selected IASA members to offset the costs of active participation in an annual conference.
* Research Grants are awarded on an occasional basis to support original research and publication on audiovisual archiving.

==Collaboration==
IASA has long standing relationships with international organisations such as [[UNESCO]] and [[Europeana]] and is a respected partner in various international audiovisual archive projects. IASA is a founding member of the CCAAA (Co-ordinating Council of Audiovisual Archive Associations).

In 2012 and 2013, IASA hosted the official website of the [[UNESCO]] [[World Day for Audiovisual Heritage]], an event held annually on 27 October to raise awareness of the significance of and threats to sound and moving image heritage worldwide.

==Committees and Sections==
''IASA Committees'' focus on topics that are of common interest to all archives and collections:
* The Organising Knowledge Committee concerns itself with standards and rules as well as with systems, automated or manual, for the documentation and cataloguing of audiovisual media;
* The Discography Committee deals with standards and recommended practices, as well as current and ongoing projects involving published recordings;
* The Technical Committee devotes itself to all technical aspects of recording, storage, preservation and reproduction, including new recording transfer and storage technologies.
* The Training and Education Committee concerns itself with audiovisual archiving Training &amp; Education, as well as concentrated actions in gaining multifunctional training and education material.


''IASA Sections'' provide a platform for the exchange of information between specific types of archives and collections:
* The National Archives Section considers issues facing national collections, whether held in archives, libraries, museums or research institutions, e.g. acquisition policies, legal deposit, the management of large collections;
* The Broadcast Archives Section handles the special responsibilities of audiovisual archives in broadcasting companies;
* The Research Archives Section is concerned with special issues relating to audiovisual archives whose holdings include collections of recordings originally made for research purposes.

==Regional branches==
National and regional branches of IASA, with their own membership and activities, exist for Austria, Britain and Ireland, German-Swissgerman regions, Nordic countries, and Italy.

A '''mechanical powder press''' is a [[machine press]] designed to compress powders, commonly used in the [[Ceramic forming techniques#Technical ceramics|production of technical ceramics]].

==Function-Principles of mechanical presses in the field of Technical Ceramics==
The function principles of the mechanic press machines differ in how to ensure the upper punch–main movement by cams, spindles-and friction drives, [[Eccentric (mechanism)| eccentric]], knuckle-joints or by the round table principle, independent if the die-or lower punch movement is realized by cams- or eccentric systems or other mechanically or hydraulically combined systems.
The executions of auxiliary movements are also not decisive for a term-classification.
These auxiliary movements can also base on pneumatic and hydraulic principles.
In comparison to hydraulic press machines the maximum compaction forces of mechanical [[Powder metallurgy | powder presses]] are limited and are placed in the range &lt;/= 5000 kN.
For the requirements of wet-and dry pressing techniques in the field of Technical Ceramics cams-, eccentric-, knuckle joint- as well as round table presses have proved and tested, whereas cam-presses especially used for wet-press-techniques of pourable materials.
The range of compaction force of mechanical presses for products of the Technical Ceramics is
&lt; 2500 kN, what is caused from the less density of the ceramic materials.
Normally the upper punch-, lower punch- and die systems of mechanical presses don’t work on base of multi-subdivided punches.

==Application-Advantages in the field of Technical Ceramics==
Adaptable cam-executions, which can be made suitable individually to the concerned products, will meet especially the requirements of wet-press-technique of pourable compounds, while applications of eccentric-, knuckle-joint and round table presses are particularly related on the dry-press-technique of compounds with gliding characteristics.
The sinusoidal movement of eccentric presses offers advantages especially for bigger strokes &lt; 100 strokes per minute and the distorted sinusoidal movement of the knuckle joint is especially used for products, which need a longer time for deairing in the phase of compaction and a longer time for decompression after the bottom dead centre.
For this kind of compaction technology the strokes are limited &lt; 35 strokes per minute, but in contrast to that the compaction speed of round table presses for small and simple shaped products are especially high and quantities &lt; 30,000 pcs per minute can be realized.

==Context between ceramic compaction technology and design principles of the mechanical presses==
The unit of product–technology–press machine / tooling is characterizing the context between the ceramic compaction technology and the design principles of the mechanical presses.
Distinctions of the die- withdrawal- and the ejection technology of the uniaxial dry- and wet-press- technique in the technical ceramics influence the approachable quality of the compactions in depending of the geometric shape of the products and in depending of the selected type of press.
Because the achievement of a speed-proportional compaction relation with pure mechanical presses is very difficult to realize and high mechanical investments are necessary, more and more combined mechanic-hydraulic function principles on base of subdivided punches will win a higher signification, because the requirements of the high-accuracy-pressing can be met better.
The design principles of particularly mechanical powder presses, explained in a [http://www.fromos.de/en/cooperation-china/dissertation-mechanical-presses.html dissertation of Dr.B.Froherz] offer some base confrontation of advantages and disadvantages related to technology and presses especially for tool designers.

'''Medieval technology''' is the technology used in [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]] under [[Christendom|Christian rule]]. After the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]], medieval Europe saw a radical change in the rate of new inventions, innovations in the ways of managing traditional means of production, and economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Crosby described some of this technological revolution in his ''The Measure of Reality: Quantification in Western Europe, 1250-1600'' and other major historians of technology have also noted it.&lt;/ref&gt; The period saw major [[technology|technological]] advances, including the adoption of [[gunpowder]], the invention of vertical [[windmill]]s, [[spectacles]], [[mechanical clock]]s, and greatly improved [[water mill]]s, building techniques ([[Gothic architecture]], [[medieval castle]]s), and [[agriculture]] in general ([[three-field crop rotation]]).

The [[List of early medieval watermills|development of water mills]] from their [[List of ancient watermills|ancient origins]] was impressive, and extended from agriculture to [[sawmill]]s both for timber and stone. By the time of the ''[[Domesday Book]]'', most large villages had turnable mills, around 6,500 in [[England]] alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Holt|1988|pp=7–8, 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water-power was also widely used in [[mining]] for raising ore from shafts, crushing ore, and even powering [[bellows]].

European technical advancements from the 12th to 14th centuries were either built on long-established techniques in medieval Europe, originating from [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] antecedents, or adapted from cross-cultural exchanges through trading networks with the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]], [[China]], and [[History of India|India]]. Often, the revolutionary aspect lay not in the act of invention itself, but in its technological refinement and application to political and economic power. Though [[gunpowder]] along with other weapons had been started by Chinese, it was the Europeans who developed and perfected its military potential, precipitating European expansion and eventual imperialism in the Modern Era.

Also significant in this respect were advances in maritime technology. Advances in shipbuilding included the multi-masted [[ship]]s with [[lateen]] sails, the [[Rudder|sternpost-mounted rudder]] and the skeleton-first [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] construction. Along with new navigational techniques such as the [[Compass|dry compass]], the [[Jacob's staff]] and the [[astrolabe]], these allowed economic and military control of the seas adjacent to Europe and enabled the global navigational achievements of the dawning [[Age of Exploration]].

At the turn to the [[Renaissance]], [[Johann Gutenberg|Gutenberg]]’s invention of [[Printing press|mechanical printing]] made possible a dissemination of knowledge to a wider population, that would not only lead to a gradually more egalitarian society, but one more able to dominate other cultures, drawing from a vast reserve of knowledge and experience. The technical drawings of late-medieval artist-engineers [[Guido da Vigevano]] and [[Villard de Honnecourt]] can be viewed as forerunners of later Renaissance works such as [[Taccola]] or [[Leonardo da Vinci|da Vinci]].

== Civil technologies ==
The following is a list of some important medieval technologies. The approximate date or first mention of a technology in medieval Europe is given. Technologies were often a matter of cultural exchange and date and place of first inventions are not listed here (see main links for a more complete history of each).

=== Agriculture ===

The first part was a [[Coulter (agriculture)]] at the bottom of the plough.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This knife was used to vertically cut into the top sod to allow for the [[plowshare]] to work.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The plowshare was the second pair of knives which cut the sod horizontally, detaching it from the ground below.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The third part was the moldboard, which curled the sod outward.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Technology in Medieval European Life|last=Wigelsworth|first=Jeffery R.|publisher=The Greenwood Press|year=2006|isbn=0-313-33754-3|location=Westport, CT|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth part of the device was the team of eight oxen guided by the farmer.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This type of plough eliminated the need for cross-plowing by turning over the furrow instead of merely pushing it outward.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Life and Thought in the Early Middle Ages|last=Hoyt|first=Robert S|publisher=University of Minnesota|year=1967|isbn=|location=Lund Press, Minneapolis|pages=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of wheeled plough made seed placement more consistent throughout the farm as the blade could be locked in at a certain level relative to the wheels.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A disadvantage to this type of plough was its maneuverability.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Since this equipment was large and lead by a small herd of oxen, turning the plough was difficult and time-consuming.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This caused many farmers to turn away from traditional square fields and adopt a longer, more rectangular field to ensure maximum efficiency.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Technology in Medieval European Life|last=Wigelsworth|first=Jeffery R.|publisher=The Greenwood Press|year=2006|isbn=0-313-33754-3|location=Westport, CT|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Ard (plough)]]''' (5th century)

An early medieval plough that consisted of a sharpened wooden post pulled by either animals or humans.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This lightweight and primitive plough was used primarily before the invention of the [[carruca]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The ard was inefficient in more firm northern soil but did decent work in southern areas where the soil was much softer.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Although the ard required the user to apply constant pressure to the plough in order to make sure the edge could break the ground, the soil was merely pushed to the sides instead of being properly turned over.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Technology in Medieval European Life|last=Wigelsworth|first=Jeffery R.|publisher=The Greenwood Press|year=2006|isbn=0-313-33754-3|location=Westport, CT|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Horse collar]]''' (6th to 9th centuries)

Once oxen started to be replaced by horses on farms and in fields, the [[yoke]] became obsolete due to its shape not working well with a horses' posture.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The first design for a horse collar was a throat-and-girth-harness.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; These types of harnesses were unreliable though due to them not being sufficiently set in place.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The loose straps were prone to slipping and shifting positions as the horse was working and often caused asphyxiation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Around the eighth century, the introduction of the rigid collar eliminated the problem of choking.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The rigid collar was "placed over the horses head and rested on its shoulders.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This permitted unobstructed breathing and placed the weight of the plow or wagon where the horse could best support it."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Technology in Medieval European Life|last=Wigelsworth|first=Jeffery R.|publisher=The Greenwood Press|year=2006|isbn=0-313-33754-3|location=Westport, CT|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Horseshoe]]s''' (9th century)

Allowed horses to carry larger loads and move around with greater traction on hard to walk surfaces.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The practice of shoeing horses was initially practiced in the Roman Empire but lost popularity throughout the Middle Ages until around the 11th century.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Technology in Medieval European Life|last=Wigelsworth|first=Jeffery R.|publisher=The Greenwood Press|year=2006|isbn=0-313-33754-3|location=Westport, CT|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although horses in the southern lands could easily work while on the softer soil, the rocky soil of the north proved to be damaging to the horses' hooves.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Since the north was the problematic area, this is where shoeing horses first became popular.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The introduction of gravel roadways was also cause for the popularity of horseshoeing.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The loads a shoed horse could take on these roads were significantly higher than one that was barefoot.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; By the 14th century, not only did horses have shoes, but many farmers were shoeing oxen and donkeys in order to help prolong the life of their hooves.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The size and weight of the horseshoe changed significantly over the course of the middle ages.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In the 10th century, horseshoes were secured by six nails and weighed around one-quarter of a pound, but throughout the years, the shoes grew larger and by the 14th century, the shoes were being secured with eight nails and weighed nearly half a pound.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Technology in Medieval European Life|last=Wigelsworth|first=Jeffery R.|publisher=The Greenwood Press|year=2006|isbn=0-313-33754-3|location=Westport, CT|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Crop rotation]]''' (8th century)

Also called the Two-field system. This system included the farmers' field being divided into two separate crops.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; One field would grow a crop while the other was allowed to lie fallow and was used to feed livestock and regain lost nutrients.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Every year, the two fields would switch in order to ensure fields did not become nutrient deficient.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In the 11th century, this system was introduced into Sweden and spread to become the most popular form of farming.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Technology in Medieval European Life|last=Wigelsworth|first=Jeffery R.|publisher=The Greenwood Press|year=2006|isbn=0-313-33754-3|location=Westport, CT|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Three-field system]]''' (8th century)
[[File:De Grey Hours f.9.r Wine pressing.jpg|thumb|An individual grape stomping as a form of wine pressing.]]
The ideal three-field system is one that separates a section of land into three equal parts.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Each one of the three parts holds a different crop.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; One part holds a spring crop, such as barley or oats, another part holds a winter crop, such as wheat or rye, and the third part is an off-field that is left alone to grow and is used to help feed livestock.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; By rotating the three crops to a new part of the land after each year, the off-field regains some of the nutrients lost during the growing of the two crops.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; This system increases agricultural productivity over the [[Two-field system]] by only having one-third of the field not being used instead of one half.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Another advantage of crop rotation is that many scholars believe it helped increase yields by up to 50%.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Technology in Medieval European Life|last=Wigelsworth|first=Jeffery R.|publisher=The Greenwood Press|year=2006|isbn=0-313-33754-3|location=Westport, CT|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Wine press]]''' (12th century)

This device was the first practical means of [[Pressing (wine)]] on a plane surface.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The wine press was an expensive piece of machinery that only the wealthy could afford.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The method of [[Grape stomping]] was often used as a less expensive alternative.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; While white wines required the use of a wine press in order to preserve the color of the wine by removing the juices quickly from the skin, red wine did not need to be pressed until the end of the juice removal process since the color did not matter.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Many red wine winemakers used their feet to smash the grapes then used a press to remove any juice that remained in the grape skins.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Technology in Medieval European Life|last=Wigelsworth|first=Jeffery R.|publisher=The Greenwood Press|year=2006|isbn=0-313-33754-3|location=Westport, CT|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Qanat]]''' (5th century)

An underground passage used to water fields, crops, and provide drinking water.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; These tunnels had a gradual slope which used gravity to pull the water from either an [[aquifer]] or [[water well]].&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Medieval Folk Astronomy and Agriculture in Arabia and the Yemen|last=Varisoc|first=Daniel Martin|publisher=Ashgate Publishing Company|year=1997|isbn=0-86078-651-X|location=Brookfield, Vermont|pages=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system was originally found in middle eastern areas and is still used today in places where surface water is hard to find.

=== Architecture and construction ===
'''[[Pendentive]] architecture''' (6th century)

A specific spherical form in the upper corners to support a dome. Although the first experimentation was made in the 200s, it was in the 6th century in the [[Byzantine Empire]] that its potential was fully achieved.

'''[[Artesian well]]''' (1126)

A thin rod with a hard iron cutting edge is placed in the bore hole and repeatedly struck with a hammer, underground water pressure forces the water up the hole without pumping. Artesian wells are named after the town of Artois in France, where the first one was drilled by Carthusian monks in 1126.

'''[[Central heating]] through [[Underfloor heating|underfloor channels]]''' (9th century)

In the early medieval Alpine upland, a simpler central heating system where heat travelled through underfloor channels from the furnace room replaced the Roman [[hypocaust]] at some places. In [[Reichenau Abbey]] a network of interconnected underfloor channels heated the 300 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; large assembly room of the monks during the winter months. The degree of efficiency of the system has been calculated at 90%.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hägermann|Schneider|1997|pp=456–459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Vault (architecture)#Rib vault|Rib vault]]''' (12th century)

An essential element for the rise of [[Gothic architecture]], rib vaults allowed vaults to be built for the first time over rectangles of unequal lengths. It also greatly facilitated scaffolding and largely replaced the older [[groin vault]].

'''[[Chimney]]''' (12th century)

The earliest true chimneys appeared in Northern Europe during the 12th century, and with them came the first true fireplaces.

'''[[Arch bridge|Segmental arch bridge]]''' (1345)

The [[Ponte Vecchio]] in [[Florence]] is considered medieval Europe's first stone segmental arch bridge.

[[File:Treadmillcrane.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Treadwheel crane]]]]
'''[[Treadwheel crane]]''' (1220s)

The earliest reference to a [[treadwheel]] in archival literature is in France about 1225,&lt;ref name="Andrea Matthies, p.515"&gt;{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=515}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by an illuminated depiction in a manuscript of probably also French origin dating to 1240.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=526}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from tread-drums, windlasses and occasionally cranks were employed for powering cranes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|1979|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[List of historical harbour cranes|Stationary harbour crane]]''' (1244)

Stationary harbour cranes are considered a new development of the Middle Ages; its earliest use being documented for Utrecht in 1244.&lt;ref name="Matheus 1996, 345"&gt;{{harvnb|Matheus|1996|p=345}}&lt;/ref&gt; The typical harbour crane was a pivoting structure equipped with double treadwheels. There were two types: wooden gantry cranes pivoting on a central vertical axle and stone tower cranes which housed the windlass and treadwheels with only the jib arm and roof rotating.&lt;ref name="Matheus 1996, 346"&gt;{{harvnb|Matheus|1996|p=346}}&lt;/ref&gt; These cranes were placed on docksides for the loading and unloading of cargo where they replaced or complemented older lifting methods like [[see-saw]]s, [[winch]]es and [[Yard (sailing)|yards]].&lt;ref name="Matheus 1996, 345"/&gt; '''Slewing cranes''' which allowed a rotation of the load and were thus particularly suited for dockside work appeared as early as 1340.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=534}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Crane vessel|Floating crane]]'''

Beside the stationary cranes, floating cranes which could be flexibly deployed in the whole port basin came into use by the 14th century.&lt;ref name="Matheus 1996, 346"/&gt;

'''[[Crane (machine)|Mast crane]]'''

Some harbour cranes were specialised at mounting masts to newly built sailing ships, such as in Gdańsk, Cologne and Bremen.&lt;ref name="Matheus 1996, 346"/&gt;

'''[[Wheelbarrow]]''' (1170s)

The wheelbarrow proved useful in building construction, mining operations, and agriculture. Literary evidence for the use of wheelbarrows appeared between 1170 and 1250 in north-western Europe. The first depiction is in a drawing by [[Matthew Paris]] in the mid-13th century.

=== Art ===
[[File:Jan van Eyck 091.jpg|thumb|180px|''[[Portrait of a Man in a Turban]]'', oil painting by [[Jan van Eyck]] (1433)]]
'''[[Oil paint]]''' (by 1125)

As early as the 13th century, oil was used to add details to tempera paintings and paint wooden statues. Flemish painter [[Jan van Eyck]] developed the use of a stable oil mixture for [[panel painting]] around 1410.&lt;ref&gt;[[Giorgio Vasari]] and [[Karel van Mander]] propagated a myth that van Eyck invented oil painting, but [[Theophilus Presbyter|Theophilus]] ([[Roger of Helmarshausen]]?) clearly gives instructions in his 1125 treatise, ''On Divers Arts''. The van Eyck brothers were among the earliest Early Netherlandish painters to employ it for detailed panel painting and achieved new effects through the use of glazes, [[wet-on-wet]] and other techniques. {{cite book|authorlink=Ernst Gombrich|last=Gombrich|first=E. H.|title=The Story of Art|pages=236–39|publisher=Phaidon|year=1995|isbn=0-7148-3355-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clocks ===
'''[[Hourglass]]''' (1338)

Reasonably dependable, affordable and accurate measure of time. Unlike water in a [[Water clock|clepsydra]], the rate of flow of sand is independent of the depth in the upper reservoir, and the instrument is not liable to freeze. Hourglasses are a medieval innovation (first documented in [[Siena]], Italy).

'''[[Clock|Mechanical clocks]]''' (13th to 14th centuries)

A European innovation, these weight-driven clocks were used primarily in clock towers.

=== Mechanics ===
'''[[Crank (mechanism)|Compound crank]]'''

The Italian physician [[Guido da Vigevano]] combines in his 1335 ''Texaurus'', a collection of war machines intended for the recapture of the Holy Land, two simple cranks to form a compound crank for manually powering war carriages and [[Paddle steamer#History|paddle wheel boats]]. The devices were fitted directly to the vehicle's axle respectively to the shafts turning the paddle wheels.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|p=112}}; {{harvnb|Hall|1979|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metallurgy ===
'''[[Blast furnace]]''' (1150–1350)

Cast iron had been made in China before the 4th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Genius of China: 3000 years of science, discovery and invention |last1=Temple|first1= Robert|coauthors= Joseph Needham|year= 1986|publisher = Simon and Schuster|location=New York |isbn= |pages=| postscript = &lt;Based on the works of Joseph Needham&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  European cast iron first appears in Middle Europe (for instance Lapphyttan in Sweden, Dürstel in Switzerland and the Märkische Sauerland in Germany) around 1150,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-muenster.de/UrFruehGeschichte/kier1.htm Archaeological Investigations on the Beginning of Blast Furnace-Technology in Central Europe] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208193313/http://www.uni-muenster.de/UrFruehGeschichte/kier1.htm |date=2007-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in some places according to recent research even before 1100.&lt;ref&gt;Radomir Pleiner: Vom Rennfeuer zum Hochofen.

=== Milling ===
{{Further|List of early medieval watermills}}
'''[[Ship mill]]''' (6th century)

The ship mill is a Byzantine invention, designed to mill grains using hydraulic power. The technology eventually spread to the rest of Europe and was in use until ca. 1800.
'''[[Paper mill]]''' (13th century)

The first certain use of a water-powered [[paper mill]], evidence for which is elusive in both Chinese&lt;ref&gt;[[Tsien, Tsuen-Hsuin]] 1985, pp. 68−73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lucas|2005|p=28, fn. 70}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Muslim paper making,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|1996|pp=414f.}}; {{harvnb|Thompson|1978|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; dates to 1282.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|1996|p=418}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Rolling mill]]''' (15th century)

Used to produce metal sheet of an even thickness. First used on soft, malleable metals, such as [[lead]], [[gold]] and [[tin]]. Leonardo da Vinci described a rolling mill for wrought iron.

'''[[Tide mill|Tidal Mill]]s''' (6th century)

The earliest tidal mills were excavated on the Irish coast where watermillers knew and employed the two main [[waterwheel]] types: a 6th-century tide mill at Killoteran near [[Waterford]] was powered by a vertical waterwheel,&lt;ref name="Murphy 2005"&gt;{{harvnb|Murphy|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the tide changes at [[Little Island, Cork|Little Island]] were exploited by a twin-flume horizontal-wheeled mill (c. 630) and a vertical undershot waterwheel alongside it.&lt;ref name="Wikander 1985, 155–157"&gt;{{harvnb|Wikander|1985|pp=155–157}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harnvb|Rynne|2000|pp=17, 49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another early example is the [[Nendrum Monastery mill]] from 787 which is estimated to have developed seven to eight [[horsepower]] at its peak.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McErlean|Crothers|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nendrum.utvinternet.com/tmill/ Nendrum Monastery mill] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927225336/http://www.nendrum.utvinternet.com/tmill/ |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Windmill|Vertical windmill]]s''' (1180s)

Invented in Europe as the pivotable post mill, the first surviving mention of one comes from Yorkshire in England in 1185. They were efficient at grinding grain or draining water. Stationary tower mills were also developed in the 13th century.

'''[[Trip hammer|Water hammer]]''' (12th century at the latest)

Used in metallurgy to forge the metal blooms from [[bloomery|bloomeries]] and [[Catalan forge]]s, they replaced manual hammerwork. The water hammer was eventually superseded by [[steam hammer]]s in the 19th century.

=== Navigation ===
'''[[History of the compass#Dry compass|Dry compass]]''' (12th century)

The first European mention of the directional compass is in [[Alexander Neckam]]'s ''On the Natures of Things'', written in Paris around 1190.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara M. Kreutz, “Mediterranean Contributions to the Medieval Mariner's Compass,” ''Technology and Culture'', Vol. 14, No. 3. (July 1973), p.368&lt;/ref&gt; It was either [[Compass#Question of diffusion|transmitted from China or the Arabs]] or an [[Compass#Question of independent European invention|independent European innovation]]. Dry compass were invented in the Mediterranean around 1300.&lt;ref&gt;Frederic C. Lane, “The Economic Meaning of the Invention of the Compass,” ''The American Historical Review'', Vol. 68, No. 3. (April 1963), p.615ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Compass|Astronomical compass]]''' (1269)

The French scholar [[Pierre de Maricourt]] describes in his experimental study ''Epistola de magnete'' (1269) three different compass designs he has devised for the purpose of astronomical observation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|1951|pp=2ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pintle and gudgeon rudder system scheme.svg|thumb|180px|Scheme of a sternpost-mounted medieval rudder]]
'''[[Rudder|Stern-mounted rudders]]''' (1180s)

The first depiction of a pintle-and-gudgeon rudder on church carvings dates to around 1180. They first appeared with [[Cog (ship)|cog]]s in the North and Baltic Seas and quickly spread to Mediterranean. The iron hinge system was the first stern rudder permanently attached to the ship hull and made a vital contribution to the navigation achievements of the [[age of discovery]] and thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nautarch.tamu.edu/pdf-files/Mott-MA1991.pdf Lawrence V. Mott, ''The Development of the Rudder, A.D. 100-1600: A Technological Tale'', Thesis May 1991, Texas A&amp;M University]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Printing, paper and reading ===
'''[[Movable type]] [[printing press]]''' (1440s)

[[Johannes Gutenberg]]'s great innovation was not the printing itself, but instead of using carved plates as in [[woodblock printing]], he used separate letters (''types'') from which the printing plates for pages were made up. This meant the types were recyclable and a page cast could be made up far faster.

'''[[Paper]]''' (13th century)

Paper was invented in China and transmitted through Islamic Spain in the 13th century. In Europe, the paper-making processes was mechanized by water-powered mills and paper presses (see [[paper mill]]).

[[File:Friedrich Herlin, Reading Saint Peter (1466).jpg|thumb|180px|Reading [[Saint Peter]] with eyeglasses (1466)]]

'''[[Rotating bookmark]]''' (13th century)

A rotating disc and string device used to mark the page, column, and precise level in the text where a person left off reading in a text.  Materials used were often leather, velum, or paper.

'''[[Spectacles]]''' (1280s)

The first spectacles, invented in Florence, used convex lenses which were of help only to the far-sighted. Concave lenses were not developed prior to the 15th century.

'''[[Watermark]]''' (1282)

This medieval innovation was used to mark paper products and to discourage counterfeiting. It was first introduced in [[Bologna]], Italy.

=== Science and learning ===

'''[[Theory of impetus]]''' (6th century)

A scientific theory that was introduced by [[John Philoponus]] who made criticism of Aristotelian principles of physics, and it served as an inspiration to medieval scholars as well as to [[Galileo Galilei]]  who ten centuries later, during the [[Scientific Revolution]], extensively cited Philoponus in his works while making the case as to why Aristotelian physics was flawed. It is the intellectual precursor to the concepts of [[inertia]], [[momentum]] and [[acceleration]] in [[classical mechanics]].

'''[[Arabic numerals]]''' (13th century)

The first recorded mention in Europe was in 976, and they were first widely published in 1202 by [[Leonardo of Pisa|Fibonacci]] with his ''Liber Abaci''.

'''[[University]]'''

The first [[medieval universities]] were founded between the 11th and 13th centuries leading to a rise in literacy and learning. By 1500, the institution had spread throughout most of Europe and played a key role in the [[Scientific Revolution]]. Today, the educational concept and institution has been globally adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Makdisi|1970|p=264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Textile industry and garments ===
'''[[button|Functional button]]''' (13th century)

German buttons appeared in 13th-century Germany as an indigenous innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn White: "The Act of Invention: Causes, Contexts, Continuities and Consequences", ''Technology and Culture'', Vol. 3, No. 4 (Autumn, 1962), pp. 486-500 (497f. &amp; 500)&lt;/ref&gt; They soon became widespread with the rise of snug-fitting clothing.

'''[[Loom|Horizontal loom]]''' (11th century)

Horizontal looms operated by foot-treadles were faster and more efficient.

'''[[Silk]]''' (6th century)

Manufacture of silk began in Eastern Europe in the 6th century and in Western Europe in the 11th or 12th century. Silk had been imported over the [[Silk Road]] since antiquity. The technology of "silk throwing" was mastered in Tuscany in the 13th century. The silk works used waterpower and some regard these as the first mechanized textile mills.

'''[[Spinning wheel]]''' (13th century)

Brought to Europe probably from India.

=== Miscellaneous ===
[[File:KnightsTemplarPlayingChess1283.jpg|thumb|right|[[Knights Templar]] playing chess, ''[[Libro de los juegos]]'' (1283)]]
'''[[Chess]]''' (1450)

The earliest predecessors of the game originated in 6th-century AD India and spread via Persia and the Muslim world to Europe. Here the game evolved into its current form in the 15th century.

'''[[Forest glass]]''' (c. 1000)

This type of glass uses [[wood ash]] and sand as the main raw materials and is characterised by a variety of greenish-yellow colours.

'''[[Grindstone (tool)|Grindstone]]s''' (834)

Grindstones are a rough stone, usually sandstone, used to sharpen iron.

'''[[Liquor]]''' (12th century)

Primitive forms of distillation were known to the [[Babylonia]]ns,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Levey |first=Martin |title=Chemistry and Chemical Technology in Ancient Mesopotamia |date=1959 |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |page=36 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=76ILAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Indians in the first centuries AD.&lt;ref name="habib"&gt;[[Irfan Habib]] (2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=K8kO4J3mXUAC&amp;pg=PA55 ''Economic History of Medieval India, 1200-1500'', page 55], [[Pearson Education]]&lt;/ref&gt; Early evidence of distillation also comes from [[Alchemy|alchemists]] working in [[Alexandria, Egypt|Alexandria]], [[Roman Egypt]], in the 1st century.&lt;ref name="Forbes1970"&gt;{{cite book|last=Forbes|first=Robert James|title=A short history of the art of distillation: from the beginnings up to the death of Cellier Blumenthal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XeqWOkKYn28C|accessdate=29 June 2010|year=1970|publisher=BRILL|pages=57, 89|isbn=978-90-04-00617-1|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111220084813/http://books.google.com/books?id=XeqWOkKYn28C|archivedate=20 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Alchemy and chemistry in medieval Islam|medieval Arabs]] adopted the distillation process,&lt;ref name="Gorak"&gt;{{cite book|title=Distillation: Fundamentals and Principles|page=5-10|editor=Andrzej Gorak, Eva Sorensen|publisher=Academic Press|year=2014|isbn=9780123865489}}&lt;/ref&gt; which later spread to Europe. Texts on the distillation of waters, wine, and other spirits were written in [[Salerno]] and [[Cologne]] in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.&lt;ref name="Gorak" /&gt;

Liquor consumption rose dramatically in Europe in and after the mid-14th century, when distilled liquors were commonly used as remedies for the [[Black Death]]. These spirits would have had a much lower [[Alcohol by volume|alcohol content]] (about 40% ABV) than the alchemists' pure distillations, and they were likely first thought of as medicinal [[elixir]]s. Around 1400, methods to distill spirits from wheat, barley, and rye were discovered. Thus began the [[List of national liquors|"national" drinks]] of Europe, including  [[gin]] (England) and ''[[grappa]]'' (Italy). In 1437, "burned water" ([[brandy]]) was mentioned in the records of the [[County of Katzenelnbogen]] in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.graf-von-katzenelnbogen.com/begriffe.html graf-von-katzenelnbogen.com], ''Trinkglas.''&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''[[Magnet]]s''' (12th century)

Magnets were first referenced in the ''[[Roman d'Enéas]]'', composed between 1155 and 1160.

'''[[Mirror]]s''' (1180)

The first mention of a "glass" mirror is in 1180 by [[Alexander Neckham]] who said "Take away the lead which is behind the [[glass]] and there will be no image of the one looking in."

'''Illustrated surgical atlas''' (1345)

Guido da Vigevano (c. 1280 − 1349) was the first author to add illustrations to his anatomical descriptions. His ''Anathomia'' provides [[picture]]s of [[neuroanatomy|neuroanatomical]] structures and techniques such as the dissection of the head by means of [[trephination]], and depictions of the [[meninges]], [[cerebrum]], and [[spinal cord]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Di Ieva|2007|pp=1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Quarantine]]''' (1377)

Initially a 40-day-period, the quarantine was introduced by the [[Republic of Ragusa]] as a measure of disease prevention related to the [[Black Death]]. It was later adopted by Venice from where the practice spread all around in Europe.

'''[[Mouse trap|Rat trap]]s''' (1170s)

The first mention of a rat trap is in the medieval romance ''[[Yvain, the Knight of the Lion]]'' by [[Chrétien de Troyes]].

'''[[Soap]]''' (9th century)

Soap came into widespread European use in the 9th century in semi-liquid form, with hard soap perfected by the Arabs in the 12th century.

== Military technologies ==

=== Armour ===
'''[[Gambeson|Quilted Armour]]''' (pre 5th - 14th Century)

There was a vast amount of armour technology available through the 5th to 16th centuries. 
Most soldiers during this time wore padded or quilted armor. This was the cheapest and most available armor for the majority of soldiers. Quilted armour was usually just a jacket made of thick linen and wool meant to pad or soften the impact of blunt weapons and light blows. Although, this technology predated the 5th century, it was still extremely prevalent because of the low cost and the weapon technology at the time made the bronze armor of the Greeks and Romans obsolete. Quilted armour was also used in conjunction with other types of armour. Usually worn over or under leather, mail, and later plate armour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeVries|first1=Kelly|last2=Smith|first2=Robert Douglas|title=Medieval Military Technology|date=2012|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto, Ontario|isbn=978-1-4426-0497-1|page=72|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Boiled_leather|Cuir Bouilli]]''' (5th-10th Century)

Hardened leather armour also called Cuir Bouilli was a step up from quilted armour. Made by boiling leather in either water, wax or oil to soften it so it can be shaped, it would then be allowed to dry and become very hard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Flank|first1=Lenny|title=A History of European Armor|journal=Hidden History|date=May 24, 2016|url=https://lflank.wordpress.com/2016/05/24/a-history-of-european-armor/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large pieces of armour could be made such as breast plates, helmets, and leg guards, but many times smaller pieces would be sewn into the quilting of quilted armour or strips would be sewn together on the outside of a linen jacket. This was not as affordable as the quilted armour but offered much better protection against edged slashing weapons.

'''[[Chain mail|Chain Mail]]''' (11th-16th Century)

The most common type during the 11th through the 16th centuries was the '''[[Hauberk]]''', also known earlier than the 11th century as the Carolingian byrnie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeVries|first1=Kelly|last2=Smith|first2=Robert Douglas|title=Medieval Military Technologies|date=2012|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto, Ontario|isbn=978-1-4426-0497-1|page=64|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Made of interlinked rings of metal, it sometimes consisted of a coif that covered the head and a tunic that covered the torso, arms, and legs down to the knees. Chain mail was very effective at protecting against light slashing blows but ineffective against stabbing or thrusting blows. The great advantage was that it allowed a great freedom of movement and was relatively light with significant protection over quilted or hardened leather armour. It was far more expensive than the hardened leather or quilted armour because of the massive amount of labor it required to create. This made it unattainable for most soldiers and only the more wealthy soldiers could afford it. Later, toward the end of the 13th century '''[[banded mail]]''' became popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ashdown|first1=Charles Henry|title=European Arms &amp; Armour|date=1967|publisher=Brussel &amp; Brussel|location=New York|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Constructed of washer shaped rings of iron overlapped and woven together by straps of leather as opposed to the interlinked metal rings of chain mail, banded mail was much more affordable to manufacture. The washers were so tightly woven together that it was very difficult penetrate and offered greater protection from arrow and bolt attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ashdown|first1=Charles Henry|title=European Arms &amp; Armour|date=1967|publisher=Brussel &amp; Brussel|location=New York|pages=134-138}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Banded_Mail_Armour.jpg|thumb|right|Banded Mail Armour Construction]]

'''[[Jazerant]]''' (11th century)

The Jazerant or Jazeraint was an adaptation of chain mail in which the chain mail would be sewn in between layers of linen or quilted armour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Andre-Driussi|first1=Micheal|title=Lexicon Urthus|date=2008|publisher=Sirius Fiction|isbn=0964279517|page=192|edition=second}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exceptional protection against light slashing weapons and slightly improved protection against small thrusting weapons, but little protection against large blunt weapons such as maces and axes. This gave birth to reinforced chain mail and became more prevalent in the 12th and 13th century. Reinforced armour was made up of chain mail with metal plates or hardened leather plates sewn in. This greatly improved protection from stabbing and thrusting blows. 

'''[[Scale Armour]]''' (12th century)

A type of '''[[Lamellar armour]]''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeVries|first1=Kelly|last2=Smith|first2=Robert Douglas|title=Medievil Militay Technology|date=2012|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Canada|isbn=978-1-4426-0497-1|page=70|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt; was made up entirely of small, overlapping plates. Either sewn together, usually with leather straps, or attached to a backing such as linen, or a quilted armor. Scale armour does not require the labor to produce that chain mail does and therefore is more affordable. It also affords much better protection against thrusting blows and pointed weapons. Though, it is much heavier, more restrictive and impedes free movement. 

[[File:KHM Wien S XIII - Jousting armour by Jörg and Lorenz Helmschmid front.jpg|thumb|180px|Jousting armor commissioned by [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] in 1494]]

'''[[Plate armour|Plate Armour]]''' (14th century)

Plate armour covered the entire body. Although parts of the body were already covered in plate armour as early as 1250, such as the Poleyns for covering the knees and Couters - plates that protected the elbows,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeVries|first1=Kelly|last2=Smith|first2=Robert Douglas|title=Medieval Military Technology|date=2012|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Canada|isbn=978-1-4426-0497-1|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first complete full suit without any textiles was seen around 1410-1430. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ashdown|first1=Charles Henry|title=European Arms &amp; Armour|date=1967|publisher=Brussel &amp; Brussel|location=New York|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''[[Components of medieval armour]]''' that made up a full suit consisted of a cuirass, a gorget, vambraces, gauntlets, cuisses, greaves, and sabatons held together by internal leather straps. Improved weaponry such as crossbows and the long bow had greatly increased range and power. This made penetration of the chain mail hauberk much easier and more common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeVries|first1=Kelly|last2=Smith|first2=Robert Douglas|title=Medieval Military Technology|date=2012|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Canada|isbn=978-1-4426-0497-1|page=74|edition=second}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid 1400's most plate was worn alone and without the need of a hauberk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ashdown|first1=Charles Henery|title=European Arms &amp; Armour|date=1967|publisher=Brussel &amp; Brussel|location=New York|page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advances in metal working such as the blast furnace and new techniques for carburizing made plate armour nearly impenetrable and the best armour protection available at the time. Although plate armour was fairly heavy, because each suit was custom tailored to the wearer, it was very easy to move around in. A full suit of plate armour was extremely expensive and mostly unattainable for the majority of soldiers. Only very wealthy land owners and nobility could afford it. The quality of plate armour increases as more armour makers became more proficient in metal working. A suit of plate armour became a symbol of social status and the best made were personalized with embellishments and engravings. Plate armour saw continued use in battle until the 17th century.

=== Cavalry ===
'''[[Saddle|Arched saddle]]''' (11th century)

The arched saddle enabled mounted [[knight]]s to wield [[lance]]s underarm and prevent the charge from turning into an unintentional pole-vault. This innovation gave birth to true shock [[cavalry]], enabling fighters to charge on full gallop.

'''[[Spur]]s''' (11th century)

Spurs were invented by the Normans and appeared at the same time as the cantled saddle. They enabled the horseman to control his horse with his feet, replacing the whip and leaving his arms free. Rowel spurs familiar from cowboy films were already known in the 13th century. Gilded spurs were the ultimate symbol of the knighthood - even today someone is said to "earn his spurs" by proving his or her worthiness.

'''[[Stirrup]]''' (6th century)

Stirrups were invented by steppe nomads in what is today Mongolia and northern China in the 4th century. They were introduced in Byzantium in the 6th century and in the Carolingian Empire in the 8th. They allowed a mounted knight to wield a sword and strike from a distance leading to a great advantage for mounted cavalry.

=== Gunpowder weapons ===
'''[[Cannon]]''' (1324)

Cannons are first recorded in Europe at the siege of Metz in 1324. In 1350 [[Petrarch]] wrote "these instruments which discharge balls of metal with most tremendous noise and flashes of fire...were a few years ago very rare and were viewed with greatest astonishment and admiration, but now they are become as common and familiar as any other kinds of arms."&lt;ref name="Matheus 1996, 346"/&gt;

'''[[Volley gun]]'''

See [[Ribauldequin]].

'''[[Gunpowder|Corned gunpowder]]''' (late 14th century)

First practiced in Western Europe, corning the black powder allowed for more powerful and faster ignition of cannons. It also facilitated the storage and transportation of black powder. Corning constituted a crucial step in the evolution of gunpowder warfare.

[[File:Mons Meg, Medieval Bombard, Edinburgh, Scotland. Pic 01.jpg|thumb|180px|Scottish bombard [[Mons Meg]]]]
'''[[Supergun]]''' (late 14th century)

Extant examples include the wrought-iron [[Pumhart von Steyr]], [[Dulle Griet]] and [[Mons Meg]] as well as the cast-bronze [[Faule Mette]] and [[Faule Grete]] (all from the 15th century).

=== Mechanical artillery ===
'''[[Trebuchet|Counterweight trebuchet]]''' (12th century)

Powered solely by the force of gravity, these catapults revolutionized medieval siege warfare and construction of fortifications by hurling huge stones unprecedented distances. Originating somewhere in the eastern Mediterranean basin, counterweight trebuchets were introduced in the [[Byzantine Empire]] around 1100 CE, and was later adopted by the [[Crusader states]] and as well by the other armies of Europe and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doaks.org/DOP54/DP54ch4.pdf Paul E. Chevedden, "The Invention of the Counterweight Trebuchet: A Study in Cultural Diffusion", ''Dumbarton Oaks Papers'', No. 54 (2000), pp.71-116 (104f.)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205183303/http://www.doaks.org/DOP54/DP54ch4.pdf |date=2007-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Missile weapons ===
'''[[Greek fire]]''' (7th century)

An incendiary weapon which could even burn on water is also attributed to the Byzantines where they installed it on their ships. It played a crucial role in the Byzantine Empire's victory over the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] during the [[Siege of Constantinople (717–718)]]

'''[[Grenade]]''' (8th century) [[File:Liquid fire granades Chania.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Ceramic grenades that were filled with Greek fire, surrounded by [[caltrop]]s, 10th–12th century, [[National Historical Museum (Greece)|National Historical Museum]], Athens, Greece]]

Rudimentary incendiary grenades appeared in the [[Byzantine Empire]], as the Byzantine soldiers learned that [[Greek fire]], a Byzantine invention of the previous century, could not only be thrown by [[flamethrower]]s at the enemy, but also in stone and ceramic jars. 

'''[[English longbow|Longbow]] with massed, disciplined archery''' (13th century)

Having a high rate of fire and penetration power, the longbow contributed to the eventual demise of the medieval [[knight]] class{{dubious|date=July 2016}}. Used particularly by the English to great effect against the French cavalry during the [[Hundred Years' War]] (1337–1453).

'''[[Arbalest|Steel crossbow]]''' (late 14th century)

European innovation. Came with several different cocking aids to enhance draw power, making the weapons also the first hand-held mechanical crossbows.

=== Miscellaneous ===
'''[[Combined arms]] tactics''' (14th century)

The [[battle of Halidon Hill]] 1333 was the first battle where intentional and disciplined combined arms infantry tactics were employed.{{dubious|date=October 2012}} The English men-at-arms dismounted aside the archers, combining thus the staying power of super-heavy infantry and striking power of their two-handed weapons with the missiles and mobility of the archers using longbows and shortbows
. Combining dismounted knights and men-at-arms with archers was the archetypal Western Medieval battle tactics until the [[battle of Flodden]] 1513 and final emergence of firearms.

'''NuCaptcha''' is an early fraud detection service which utilises behavior analytics to provision threat appropriate, animated video [[CAPTCHA]]'s. NuCaptcha is developed and operated by [[Canada|Canadian]]-based firm, NuData Security.&lt;ref name="reg"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/07/01/animated_captcha/|title=Animated CAPTCHA tech aims to fox spambots|work=[[The Register]]|accessdate=14 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theh"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.h-online.com/security/news/item/NuCaptcha-Flash-CAPTCHAs-to-combat-spambots-1032147.html|title=NuCaptcha Flash CAPTCHAs to combat spambots|accessdate=14 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eweek"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Security/Company-Looks-to-Slow-Spammers-With-Video-CAPTCHA-Technology-127193/|title=Spammers to Face Video CAPTCHA Technology - Security from eWeek|work=[[eWeek]]|accessdate=14 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gartner Security &amp; Risk Management Summit|url=http://agendabuilder.gartner.com/SEC19/webpages/VendorDetail.aspx?Vendor=96|work=[[Gartner]]|accessdate=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Static image-based CAPTCHAs are routinely used to prevent automated sign-ups to websites by using text or images of words disguised so that [[optical character recognition]] (OCR) software has trouble reading them.&lt;ref name="reg" /&gt; However, in common CAPTCHA systems, users often fail to correctly solve the CAPTCHA 7% - 25% of the time.&lt;ref name="captcha-evaluation"&gt;{{cite web |first=Elie|last=Bursztein |author2=Bethard, Steven |author3=Fabry, Celine |author4=Mitchell, John C. |author5= Jurafsky, Dan  |url=http://www.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/burszstein_2010_captcha.pdf|title= How Good are Humans at Solving CAPTCHAS?

[[File:NuCaptcha logo.png|right|frameless]]

== Technology ==
NuCaptcha attempts to solve usability of static image-based CAPTCHAS using two main technologies: 1) video animation to display CAPTCHA puzzles, and 2) a behaviour analysis system to monitor interactions with the platform.
# Video animation. CAPTCHAS are displayed as a video, and rendered in the web browser.  A variety of technologies can be used to display the animated CAPTCHA, such as Flash video, HTML5, or GIF.  Standard CAPTCHA techniques such as character crowding, once animated, are easier for humans to detect because of an innate motion-detecting ability.
# Behavior Analysis. Using machine-learning algorithms, NuCaptcha monitors platform interactions to tune the security of each CAPTCHA delivered to the user. Suspected attackers are given progressively more secure CAPTCHAS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/nucatpcha_introduces_video_CAPTCHAS_better_securit.php|title=Video CAPTCHAs Promise Better Security, Less Frustration|work=Read, Write, Web|accessdate=30 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Security ==
Security researcher [[Elie Bursztein]] demonstrated a practical attack against NuCaptcha's video CAPTCHA scheme by employing [[optical flow]] techniques to isolate individual CAPTCHA characters. The proposed attack is able to break the video CAPTCHAs in more than 90% of cases.&lt;ref name="elinucaptcha"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bursztein|first=Elie|title=How we broke the NuCaptcha video scheme and what we propose to fix it|url=http://elie.im/blog/security/how-we-broke-the-nucaptcha-video-scheme-and-what-we-propose-to-fix-it/|accessdate=20 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, NuCaptcha noted that Bursztein’s findings underscore the need for CAPTCHA puzzles to be part of a larger security construct, such as behavior monitoring to assess the risk of individual users. NuCaptcha also pointed out that the CAPTCHAS analyzed in Bursztein's blog post were middle-security puzzles focused on usability, and not the stronger puzzles presented to high-risk users.  In addition to this, NuCaptcha noted that the optical flow technique relies on static non-animated features of the puzzle.  Changes were made to NuCaptcha puzzles to remove the static non-animated features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B9OASUKWKndeMmZlZDYzNDEtZjBhOS00N2NhLTgwNGYtMWYyYmJlYzRhNjQ2/edit|title= NuCaptcha’s Thoughts on Elie Bursztein’s Document|accessdate=7 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Plant stress measurement''' is the [[Quantification (science)|quantification]] of environmental effects on plant health. When plants are subjected to less than ideal growing conditions, they are considered to be under stress. Stress factors can affect growth, survival and crop yields. Plant stress research looks at the response of plants to limitations and excesses of the main abiotic factors ([[Ecophysiology|light, temperature, water and nutrients]]), and of other stress factors that are important in particular situations (e.g. pests, pathogens, or  pollutants). Plant stress measurement usually focuses on taking measurements from living plants. It can involve visual assessments of plant vitality, however, more recently the focus has moved to the use of instruments and protocols that reveal the response of particular processes within the plant (especially, [[photosynthesis]], [[plant cell signalling]] and [[plant secondary metabolism]])
*Determining the optimal conditions for plant growth, e.g. optimising water use in an agricultural system
*Determining the climatic range of different species or subspecies
*Determining which species or subspecies are resistant to a particular stress factor

==Instruments used to measure plant stress==

Measurements can be made from living plants using specialised equipment. Among the most commonly used instruments are those that measure parameters related to photosynthesis ([[chlorophyll meter|chlorophyll content]], [[chlorophyll fluorescence]], [[photosynthesis system|gas exchange]]) or water use (porometer, [[pressure bomb]]). In addition to these general purpose instruments, researchers often design or adapt other instruments tailored to the specific stress response they are studying.

==Photosynthesis systems==
Photosynthesis systems use [[infrared gas analyzer]]s (IRGAS) for measuring photosynthesis. [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] concentration changes in leaf chambers are measured to provide carbon assimilation values for leaves or whole plants. Research has shown that the rate of photosynthesis is directly related to the amount of carbon assimilated by the plant. Measuring CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the air, before it enters the leaf chamber, and comparing it to air measured for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; after it leaves the leaf chamber, provides this value using proven equations. These systems also use IRGAs, or solid state humidity sensors, for measuring H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O changes in leaf chambers. This is done to measure leaf [[transpiration]], and to correct CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; measurements. The light absorption spectrum for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O overlap somewhat, therefore, a correction is necessary for reliable CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; measuring results.&lt;ref name="Long S.P., Farage P.K., Garcia R.L., (1996)"/&gt; The critical measurement for most plant stress measurements is designated by “A” or carbon assimilation rate. When a plant is under stress, less carbon is assimilated.&lt;ref name="Baker N.R. (2008)"/&gt; CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; IRGAs are capable of measuring to approximately +/- 1 µmol or 1ppm of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

Because these systems are effective in measuring carbon assimilation and transpiration at low rates, as found in stressed plants,&lt;ref name="Long S.P., and Bernacchi C.J. (2003)"/&gt; they are often used as the standard to compare to other types of instruments.&lt;ref name="Edwards GE and Baker NR (1993)"/&gt; Photosynthesis instruments come in field portable and laboratory versions. They are also designed to measure ambient environmental conditions, and some systems offer variable microclimate control of the measuring chamber. Microclimate control systems allow adjustment of the measuring chamber temperature, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; level, light level, and humidity level for more detailed investigation.

The combination of these systems with fluorometers, can be especially effective for some types of stress, and can be diagnostic, e.g. in the study of cold stress and drought stress.&lt;ref name="Baker N. R., Oxborough K., (2004)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Baker N.R. (2008)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fryer M. J. (1998)"/&gt;

==Chlorophyll fluorometers==

[[Chlorophyll fluorescence]] emitted from plant leaves, gives an insight into the health of the photosynthetic systems within the leaf.  Chlorophyll fluorometers are designed to measure variable fluorescence of [[photosystem II]]. This variable fluorescence can be used to measure the level of plant stress. The most commonly used protocols include those aimed at measuring the [[Measuring fluorescence|photosynthetic efficiency]] of photosystem II, both in the light (ΔF/Fm’) and in a dark-adapted state (Fv/Fm).
Chlorophyll fluorometers are, for the most part, less expensive tools than photosynthesis systems, they also have a faster measurement time and tend to be more portable. For these reasons they have become one of the most important tools for field measurements of plant stress.

==Fv/Fm==

Fv/Fm tests whether or not plant stress affects photosystem II in a dark adapted state. Fv/Fm is the most used chlorophyll fluorescence measuring parameter in the world. “The majority of fluorescence measurements are now made using modulated fluorometers with the leaf poised in a known state.” (Neil Baker 2004)&lt;ref name="Baker N. R., Oxborough K., (2004)"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosyara, U. R., S. Subdedi, R. C. Sharma and E. Duveiller. 2010. Photochemical Efficiency and SPAD Value as Indirect Selection Criteria for Combined Selection of Spot Blotch and Terminal Heat Stress in Wheat. Journal of Phytopathology Volume 158, Issue 11-12, pages 813–821&lt;/ref&gt;

Light that is absorbed by a leaf follows three competitive pathways. It may be used in photochemistry to produce ATP and NADPH used in photosynthesis, it can be re-emitted as fluorescence, or dissipated as heat.&lt;ref name="Baker N.R. (2008)"/&gt; The Fv/Fm test is designed to allow the maximum amount of the light energy to take the fluorescence pathway. It compares the dark-adapted leaf pre-photosynthetic fluorescent state, called minimum fluorescence, or Fo, to maximum fluorescence called Fm. In maximum fluorescence, the maximum number of reaction centers have been reduced or closed by a saturating light source. In general, the greater the plant stress, the fewer open reaction centers available, and the Fv/Fm ratio is lowered. Fv/Fm is a measuring protocol that works for many types of plant stress.&lt;ref name="Maxwell K., Johnson G. N, (2000)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Baker N.R, Rosenquist E. (2004)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Baker N.R. (2008)"/&gt;

In Fv/Fm measurements, after dark adaption, minimum fluorescence is measured, using a modulated light source. This is a measurement of antennae fluorescence using a modulated light intensity that is too low to drive photosynthesis. Next, an intense light flash, or saturation pulse, of a limited duration, is used, to expose the sample, and close all available reaction centers. With all available reaction centers closed, or chemically reduced, maximum fluorescence is measured. The difference between maximum fluorescence and minimum fluorescence is Fv, or variable fluorescence. Fv/Fm is a normalize ratio created by dividing variable fluorescence by maximum fluorescence. It is a measurement ratio that represents the maximum potential quantum efficiency of Photosystem II if all capable reaction centers were open. An Fv/Fm value in the range of 0.79 to 0.84 is the approximate optimal value for many plant species, with lowered values indicating plant stress (Maxwell K., Johnson G. N. 2000), (Kitajima and Butler, 1975).&lt;ref name="Kitajima M, Butler WL (1975)"/&gt; Fv/Fm is a fast test that usually takes a few seconds. It was developed in and around 1975 by Kitajima and Butler. Dark adaptation times vary from about fifteen minutes to overnight. Some researchers will only use pre-dawn values.&lt;ref name="Maxwell K., Johnson G. N, (2000)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Baker N.R. (2008)"/&gt;

==Y(II) or ΔF/Fm’ and ETR==
Y(II) is a measuring protocol that was developed by Bernard Genty with the first publications in 1989 and 1990.&lt;ref name="Genty B., Briantais J. M. &amp; Baker N. R. (1989)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Genty B., Harbinson J., Baker N.R. (1990)"/&gt; It is a light adapted test that allows one to measure plant stress while the plant is undergoing the photosynthetic process at steady-state photosynthesis lighting conditions. Like FvFm, Y(II) represents a measurement ratio of plant efficiency, but in this case, it is an indication of the amount of energy used in photochemistry by photosystem II under steady-state photosynthetic lighting conditions. For most types of plant stress, Y(II) correlates to plant carbon assimilation in a linear fashion in C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; plants. In C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; plants, most types of plant stress correlate to carbon assimilation in a curve-linear fashion. According to Maxwell and Johnson, it takes between fifteen and twenty minutes for a plant to reach steady-state photosynthesis at a specific light level. In the field, plants in full sunlight, and not under canopy, or partly cloudy conditions, are considered to be at steady state. In this test, light irradiation levels and leaf temperature must be controlled or measured, because while the Y(II) parameter levels vary with most types of plant stress, it also varies with light level and temperature.&lt;ref name="Genty B., Briantais J. M. &amp; Baker N. R. (1989)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Genty B., Harbinson J., Baker N.R. (1990)"/&gt; Y(II) values will be higher at lower light levels than at higher light levels. Y(II) has the advantage that it is more sensitive to a larger number of plant stress types than Fv/Fm.{{cn|date=September 2016}}

'''ETR, or [[electron transport chain|electron transport]] rate''', is also a light-adapted parameter that is directly related to Y(II) by the equation, ETR = Y(II) × PAR × 0.84 × 0.5. By multiplying Y(II) by the irradiation light level in the PAR range (400&amp;nbsp;nm to 700&amp;nbsp;nm) in μmols, multiplied by the average ratio of light absorbed by the leaf 0.84, and multiplied by the average ratio of PSII reaction centers to [[Photosystem I|PSI]] reaction centers, 0.50,&lt;ref name="Edwards GE and Baker NR (1993)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Laisk A and Loreto F (1996)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Eichelman H. (2004)"/&gt; relative ETR measurement is achieved.&lt;ref name="Schreiber U, (2004)"/&gt;

Relative ETR values are valuable for stress measurements when comparing one plant to another, as long as the plants to be compared have similar light absorption characteristics.&lt;ref name="Baker N.R. (2008)"/&gt; Leaf absorption characteristics can vary by water content, age, and other factors.&lt;ref name="Baker N.R. (2008)"/&gt; If absorption differences are a concern, absorption can be measured with the use of an [[integrating sphere]].&lt;ref name="Baker N.R, Rosenquist E. (2004)"/&gt; For more accurate ETR values, the leaf absorption value and the ratio of PSII reaction centers to PSI reaction centers can be included in the equation. If different leaf absorption ratios are an issue, or they are an unwanted variable, then using Y(II) instead of ETR, may be the best choice. Four electrons must be transported for every CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule assimilated, or O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule evolved, differences from gas exchange measurements, especially in C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; plants, can occur under conditions that promote photorespiration, cyclic electron transport, and nitrate reduction.&lt;ref name="Baker N. R., Oxborough K., (2004)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Baker N.R. (2008)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Flexas (2000)"/&gt; For more detailed information concerning the relationship between fluorescence and gas exchange measurements again refer to Opti-Sciences application note #0509 on Yield measurements.

==Quenching measurements==

Quenching measurements have been traditionally used for light stress, and heat stress measurements.{{cn|date=September 2016}} In addition, they have been used to study plant photoprotective mechanisms, state transitions, plant photoinhibition, and the distribution of light energy in plants.&lt;ref name="Quenching application note"/&gt; While they can be used for many types of plant stress measurement, the time required, and the additional expense required for this capability, limit their use. These tests commonly require overnight dark adaptation, and fifteen to twenty minutes in lighted conditions to reach steady state photosynthesis before measurement.&lt;ref name="Quenching application note"/&gt;

=== Puddle model and lake model quenching parameters ===

“Understanding of the organization of plant [[Light-harvesting complexes of green plants|antennae]], or plant light collection structures, and [[Photosynthetic reaction centre|reaction centers]], where the photosynthetic light reaction actually takes place, has changed over the years. It is now understood that a single antennae does not link only to a single reaction center, as was previously described in the puddle model. Current evidence indicates that reaction centers are connected with shared antennae in terrestrial plants.” As a result, the parameters used to provide reliable measurements have changed to represent the newer understanding of this relationship. The model that represents the newer understanding of the antennae - reaction center relationship is called the lake model.&lt;ref name="Quenching application note"/&gt;

Lake model parameters were provided by Dave Kramer in 2004.&lt;ref name="Kramer D. M. (2004)"/&gt; Since then, Luke Hendrickson has provided simplified lake model parameters that allow the resurrection of the parameter NPQ, from the puddle model, back into the lake model.&lt;ref name="Klughammer C., and Schreiber U. (2008)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hendrickson L., Furbank R., &amp; Chow (2004)"/&gt; This is valuable because there have been so many scientific papers that have used NPQ for plant stress measurement, as compared to papers that have used lake model parameters.&lt;ref name="Quenching application note"/&gt;

For an in depth overview of quenching, refer to the OSI quenching application note.
It discusses all of the parameters used in lake models by Kramer, Hendrickson, and Klughammer.&lt;ref name="Klughammer C., and Schreiber U. (2008)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hendrickson L., Furbank R., &amp; Chow (2004)"/&gt; In addition it also reviews puddle model parameters, and quenching relaxation measurements.&lt;ref name="Quenching application note"/&gt;

==OJIP or OJIDP==
OJIP or OJIDP is a dark adapted chlorophyll fluorescence technique that is used for plant stress measurement. It has been found that by using a high time resolution scale, the rise to maximum fluorescence from minimum fluorescence has intermediate peaks and dips, designated by the OJID and P nomenclature. Over the years, there have been multiple theories of what the rise, time scale, peaks and dips mean. In addition, there is more than one school as to how this information should be used for plant stress testing (Strasser 2004), (Vredenburg 2004, 2009, 2011).&lt;ref name="Baker N.R. (2008)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Strasser R.J (2004)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vredenberg, W.J., (2004)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vredenberg, W.J., Prasil, O., (2009)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vredenberg, W.J (2011)"/&gt; Like Fv/Fm, and the other protocols, the research shows that OJIP works better for some types of plant stress than it does for others.{{cn|date=September 2016}}

==Choosing the best chlorophyll fluorescence protocol and parameter==

When choosing the correct protocol, and measuring parameter, for a specific type of plant stress, it is important to understand the limitations of the instrument, and the protocol used. For example, it was found that when measuring Oak leaves, a photosynthesis system could detect heat stress at 30&amp;nbsp;°C and above, Y(II) could detect heat stress at 35&amp;nbsp;°C and above, NPQ could detect heat stress at 35&amp;nbsp;°C and above, and Fv/Fm could only detect heat stress at 45&amp;nbsp;°C and above.

The relationship between carbon assimilation measurements made by photosynthesis systems of the dark Calvin cycle, and measurements of variable fluorescence of photosystem II (PSII), made by chlorophyll fluorometers of the light reaction, are not always straightforward.&lt;ref name="Rosenqvist E., van Kooten O., (2006)"/&gt; For this reason, choosing the correct chlorophyll fluorescence protocol can also be different for [[C3 carbon fixation|C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[C4 carbon fixation|C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] plants. It has been found, for example, that Y(II) and ETR are good tests for drought stress in [[C4 carbon fixation|C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] plants,&lt;ref name="Cavender-Bares J. &amp; Fakhri A. Bazzaz (2004)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="da Silva J. A. &amp; Arrabaca M.C. (2008)"/&gt; but a special assay is required to measure drought stress in most C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; plants at usable levels.&lt;ref name="Burke J. (2007)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Burke J., Franks C.D. Burow G., Xin Z. (2010)"/&gt; In C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; plants, photorespiration, and the Mehler reaction, are thought to be a principal cause. (Flexas 2000)&lt;ref name="Flexas (2000)"/&gt;

==Chlorophyll content meters==
These are instruments that use light transmission through a leaf, at two wavelengths, to determine the greenness and thickness of leaves. Transmission in the infrared range provides a measurement related to leaf thickness, and a wavelength in the red light range is used to determine greenness. The ratio of the transmission of the two wavelengths provides a chlorophyll content index that is referred to as CCI or alternatively as a SPAD index.&lt;ref name="Knighton N., Bugbee B., (2004)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Richardson A. D., Duigan S.P., Berlyn G.P., (2002)"/&gt; CCI is a linear scale, and SPAD is a logarithmic scale.&lt;ref name="Knighton N., Bugbee B., (2004)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Richardson A. D., Duigan S.P., Berlyn G.P., (2002)"/&gt; These instruments and scales have been shown to correlate to chlorophyll chemical tests for chlorophyll content except at very high levels.&lt;ref name="Knighton N., Bugbee B., (2004)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Richardson A. D., Duigan S.P., Berlyn G.P., (2002)"/&gt;

Chlorophyll content meters are commonly used for nutrient plant stress measurement, that includes nitrogen stress, and sulfur stress. Because research has shown, that if used correctly, chlorophyll content meters are reliable for nitrogen management work, these meters are often the instruments of choice for crop fertilizer management because they are relatively inexpensive.&lt;ref name="Shapiro C., Schepers J., Francis D., Shanahan J., (2006)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Francis D.D."/&gt; Research has demonstrated that by comparing well fertilized plants to test plants, the ratio of the chlorophyll content index of test plants, divided by the chlorophyll content index of well fertilized plants, will provide a ratio that is an indication of when fertilization should occur, and how much should be used. It is common to use a well fertilized stand of crops in a specific field and sometimes in different areas of the same field, as the fertilization reference, due to differences from field to field and within a field. The research done to date uses either{{What|date=July 2013|reason="either" without "or"}} ten and thirty measurements on test and well fertilized crops, to provide average values. Studies have been done for corn and wheat. One paper suggests that when the ratio drops below 95%, it is time to fertigate. The amounts of fertilizer are also recommended.&lt;ref name="Shapiro C., Schepers J., Francis D., Shanahan J., (2006)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Francis D.D."/&gt;

Crop consultants also use these tools for fertilizer recommendations. However, because strict scientific protocols are more time consuming and more expensive, consultants sometimes use well-fertilized plants located in low-lying areas as the standard well-fertilized plants. They typically also use fewer measurements. The evidence for this approach involves anecdotal discussions with crop consultants.
Chlorophyll content meters are sensitive to both nitrogen and sulfur stress at usable levels. Chlorophyll fluorometers require a special assay, involving a high actinic light level in combination with nitrogen stress, to measure nitrogen stress at usable levels.&lt;ref name="Cheng L., Fuchigami L., Breen P., (2001)"/&gt; In addition, chlorophyll fluorometers will only detect sulfur stress at starvation levels.&lt;ref name="Baker N.R, Rosenquist E. (2004)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Baker N.R. (2008)"/&gt; For best results, chlorophyll content measurements should be made when water deficits are not present.{{cn|date=September 2016}} Photosynthesis systems will detect both nitrogen and sulfur stress.{{cn|date=September 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2937">In [[sociology]] and especially the [[sociology of religion|sociological study of religion]], '''plausibility structures''' are the sociocultural contexts for systems of meaning within which these meanings make sense, or are made plausible. Beliefs and meanings held by individuals and groups are supported by, and embedded in, sociocultural institutions and processes.

==Origins==

The term was coined by [[Peter L. Berger]], who says he draws his meaning of it from the ideas of [[Karl Marx]], [[G. H. Mead]], and [[Alfred Schutz]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Berger, ''The Sacred Canopy - Elements of a Sociological Theory of Religion'' (1967) p. 45 and p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; For Berger, the relation between plausibility structure and social "world" is dialectical, the one supporting the other which, in turn, can react back upon the first. Social arrangements may help, say, a certain religious world appear self-evident. This religious outlook may then help to shape the arrangements that contributed to its rise.

==Decline of religious plausibility==

Berger was particularly concerned with the loss of plausibility of the sacred in a modernist/postmodern world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.change.freeuk.com/learning/socthink/berger.html Peter Berger's ''the Homeless Mind'' thesis]&lt;/ref&gt; Berger considered that history "constructs and deconstructs plausibility structures", and that the plurality of modern social worlds was "an important cause of the diminishing plausibility of religious traditions."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Berger, ''A Rumour of Angels'' (1971) p. 121 and p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Critics have argued that Berger pays too much attention to discourse analysis and not enough to the institutional frameworks that continue to support religious belief.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Wuthnow, ''Rediscovering the Sacred'' (1992) p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

Berger may also underestimate the role of self-selected [[reference group]]s in maintaining one's plausibility structures,&lt;ref&gt;E. R. Smith/D. M. Mackie, ''Social Psychology (2007) p. 319-20&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the erosion of the modernist trend of secularization that took place with [[postmodernism]].&lt;ref&gt;T. R. Phillips/D. L. Okholm, ''Christian Apologetics in the Postmodern World'' (1995) p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Political methodology''' is a subfield of [[Political science]] that studies the [[quantitative property|quantitative]] methods used to study politics. It combines [[statistics]], [[mathematics]], and [[formal theory (political science)|formal theory]]. Political methodology is often used for [[positive science|positive]] research, in contrast to [[normative]] research. It is similar to [[econometrics]].

== Journals ==

Political methodology is often published in the "top 3" journals ([http://www.apsanet.org/utils/journal.cfm?Journal=APSR&amp;CFID=31778852&amp;CFTOKEN=52017342 American Political Science Review], [http://ajps.org/ American Journal of Political Science], and [http://www.journalofpolitics.org/ Journal of Politics]), in sub-field journals, and in methods-focused journals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4782">'''Rudi Lissau''', born 26 June 1911 in [[Vienna]] and died 30 January 2004 in [[Brookthorpe]], United Kingdom, was a Steiner school teacher, author, lecturer and anthroposophist.

==Biography==

Rudolf Lissau’s parents were both of Jewish origin but had become students of [[Rudolf Steiner]] and founded, together with an uncle, the Viennese branch of the [[Theosophical Society]] as a forum for his work in Vienna. Rudolf Steiner visited the family in their home from time to time. Rudi was impressed by the obvious awe in which his parents held Steiner and from the age of sixteen began to study [[Anthroposophy]]. From the time he completed school and began his studies at the university, he was a member of the “Vienna Youth Group” of gifted, young people, predominantly from assimilated Jewish backgrounds, who came together to study Rudolf Steiner’s works. The focal point of this group became, after he arrived in Vienna, Dr [[Karl Koenig]], whose drive and idealism led them to agree to set up and work together in some common initiative.&lt;ref&gt;‘’The Builders of Camphill: Lives and Destinies of the Founders’’ Edited by Friedwart Bock, Article by Christine Polyblank, Floris Books, 2004 {{ISBN|0863154425}}, 9780863154423&lt;/ref&gt;

After obtaining his PhD, Rudi took a position teaching in a school for the blind. On the day Hitler’s armies occupied Austria in 1938, Rudi Lissau, who, like most of the other members of the group, had laid his plans, left Austria for Britain. One of the few who did not go with them was his sister, who decided to throw in her lot with the Jewish people and did not survive the war. Rudi was the only one of the group that had made it to England who did not join with Dr Koenig in the founding of [[Camphill]], though he remained on terms of intimate friendship with all of them.

In London, Rudi began once again to work in a school for the blind until, like other enemy aliens, he was interned on the Isle of Man. His wife Hedda, also from Vienna, found him a post at the recently founded [[Wynstones School]] in Gloustershire and so obtained his release. He determined to make a success of this although he had never taught seeing children or applied the Steiner methods in his teaching – and he ended up staying for forty years. It was he that built up the high school at Wynstones and taught History, Geography, Latin, Greek, German and Music, being himself an accomplished pianist. He conducted hikes and ski tours with his students and encouraged their love of the countryside.

Though he greatly valued life in Britain, he never lost his love for his home in Austria or his gratitude for the outstanding classical education he had received in Vienna. He met and conferred with [[Viktor Frankl]] and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] who both made a deep impression on him and stimulated his profound interest for contemporary issues that were the basis of his extraordinary knowledge and ability to address such a variety of subjects in his teaching and lecturing. Vienna had also given him his background in classical music, his love for the mountains and the landscape that he imparted to his own daughters and the many children in his classes.

It was also in Vienna that he had schooled himself in the ideas of Rudolf Steiner, something that turned into a lifelong study and passion. It was this extensive knowledge and understanding of Steiner’s work that led him to his final engagement as the author of several books, a large number of articles and a sought-after lecturer on Anthroposophy all over Europe, North America and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biographien.kulturimpuls.org/detail.php?&amp;id=390 Rudi Lissau – Article by Marjatta van Boeschoten, Biographien Dokumentation der Forschungsstelle Kulturimpuls retrieved 2014.09.12]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sanchi Yakshi Figure''' is a sandstone statue of the [[Shalabhanjika]] [[Yakshi]] from the ancient Buddhist site of [[Sanchi]] in the state of [[Madhya Pradesh]], India. One of the earliest Buddhist sculptures from the [[Indian subcontinent]], it has been part of the [[British Museum]]'s collection since 1842.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=226080&amp;partId=1&amp;place=40492&amp;plaA=40492-3-2&amp;page=1 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/asia/s/sandstone_figure_of_shalabhanj.aspx British Museum Highlights]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==
The bejewelled figure of the [[yakshi]] was originally installed on one of the gateways that surrounded the Great [[Stupa]] at Sanchi, which is said to have contained the relics of the [[Buddha]]. In the 1st century AD four [[torana]]s or large gateways were erected around the stupa, which served as the main entrances to a circular processional walkway that surrounded the holy building. Made of [[sandstone]], the gateways were elaborately decorated with some of the earliest surviving forms of buddhist [[iconography]]. The beam of the western gateway was originally supported by this bracket figure.  During the preliminary excavations at the site in the early nineteenth century, it came into the possession of a Mrs Tucker, who donated it to the British Museum in 1842. One of the few figures from the site in the [[Western World|West]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/torso-of-a-fertility-goddess-yakshi-from-the-great-stupa-at-sanchi-17530 The Boston Museum of Fine Arts has another Sanchi figure]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://collections.lacma.org/node/250015 The Los Angeles County Museum of Art has two similar figures]&lt;/ref&gt; it remains one of the most important early [[Buddhist]] sculptures in the museum's collection.

[[File:Northern Gate, Sanchi Stupa built in 3rd century BC.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Detail of the northern gate at Sanchi, with similar yakshi brackets below the upper and middle beams.]]

==Description==
Carved in white sandstone, the almost nude figure of the yakshi figure is shown clasping onto the branches of a tree with her arms, with her right leg wrapped around its [[Trunk (botany)|trunk]]. She is weighed down with ornate [[jewellery]] around her neck, waist and ankles. The sculpture also acted as an [[architectural]] bracket, supporting a long sandstone [[Beam (structure)|beam]] that once ran above the yakshi's head. The [[Shalabhanjika]] Yakshi thus served two purposes: as a fertility [[symbol]] associated with the vitality of the fruit-bearing tree and as a structural element supporting the whole configuration of the gateway.

{{Complex systems}}
'''Scalability''' is the capability of a system, network, or process to handle a growing amount of work, or its potential to be enlarged to accommodate that growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference|doi=10.1145/350391.350432|title=Characteristics of scalability and their impact on performance|conference=Proceedings of the second international workshop on Software and performance – WOSP '00|year=2000|last1=Bondi|first1=André B.|isbn=158113195X|page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a system is considered scalable if it is capable of increasing its total output under an increased load when resources (typically hardware) are added. An analogous meaning is implied when the word is used in an [[economics|economic]] context, where a company's scalability implies that the underlying [[business model]] offers the potential for [[economic growth]] within the company.

Scalability, as a property of systems, is generally difficult to define&lt;ref&gt;See for instance, {{cite journal|doi=10.1145/121973.121975|title=What is scalability?|year=1990|last1=Hill|first1=Mark D.|journal=ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News|volume=18|issue=4|page=18}} and {{cite conference|doi=10.1145/1134285.1134460|title=A framework for modelling and analysis of software systems scalability|conference=Proceedings of the 28th international conference on Software engineering – ICSE '06|year=2006|last1=Duboc|first1=Leticia|last2=Rosenblum|first2=David S.|last3=Wicks|first3=Tony|isbn=1595933751|page=949}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in any particular case it is necessary to define the specific requirements for scalability on those dimensions that are deemed important. It is a highly significant issue in electronics systems, databases, routers, and networking. A system whose performance improves after adding hardware, proportionally to the capacity added, is said to be a '''''scalable system'''''.

An [[algorithm]], design, [[Protocol (computing)|networking protocol]], [[Computer program|program]], or other system is said to ''scale'' if it is suitably [[Algorithmic efficiency|efficient]] and practical when applied to large situations (e.g. a large input data set, a large number of outputs or users, or a large number of participating nodes in the case of a distributed system). If the design or system fails when a quantity increases, it ''does not scale''. In practice, if there are a large number of things ({{mvar|n}}) that affect scaling, then resource requirements (for example, algorithmic time-complexity) must grow less than {{mvar|n&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} as {{mvar|n}} increases. An example is a search engine, which scales not only for the number of users, but also for the number of objects it indexes. Scalability refers to the ability of a site to increase in size as demand warrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/E_commerce.html?id=n4bUGAAACAAJ|title=E-commerce: Business, Technology, Society|first1=Kenneth Craig|last1=Laudon|first2=Carol Guercio|last2=Traver
|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall/Pearson Education|year=2008|isbn=9780136006459}}&lt;/ref&gt;
   
The concept of scalability is desirable in technology as well as [[business]] settings. The base concept is consistent{{snd}} the ability for a business or technology to accept increased volume without impacting the [[contribution margin]] (= [[revenue]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus; [[variable cost]]s). For example, a given piece of equipment may have a capacity for 1&amp;ndash;1000 users, while beyond 1000 users additional equipment is needed or performance will decline (variable costs will increase and reduce contribution margin).

Another example is the Incident Command System (ICS), the emergency management system used across response agencies in the United States.  ICS can scale resource coordination from a single-engine roadside brushfire to an interstate wildland fire, for example. The first resource on scene establishes IC, with authority to order resources and delegate responsibility within the span of control (managing five to seven officers, who will again delegate to up to seven, and on as the incident grows).  Senior officers assume command at the top as complexity warrants.  This proven system is remarkably simple, fully scalable and has been saving lives and property for nearly half a century.[http://amj.aom.org/content/44/6/1281.short]


Scalability can be measured in various dimensions, such as:

* ''Administrative scalability'': The ability for an increasing number of organizations or users to easily share a single distributed system.
* ''Functional scalability'': The ability to enhance the system by adding new functionality at minimal effort.
* ''Geographic scalability'': The ability to maintain performance, usefulness, or usability regardless of expansion from concentration in a local area to a more distributed geographic pattern.
* ''Load scalability'': The ability for a [[distributed system]] to easily expand and contract its resource pool to accommodate heavier or lighter loads or number of inputs. Alternatively, the ease with which a system or component can be modified, added, or removed, to accommodate changing load.
* ''Generation scalability'': The ability of a system to scale up by using new generations of components. Thereby, [[Open architecture|''heterogeneous scalability'']] is the ability to use the components from different vendors.&lt;ref name="parallel_arch"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hesham El-Rewini and Mostafa Abd-El-Barr|title=Advanced Computer Architecture and Parallel Processing|url=https://books.google.ee/books?id=7JB-u6D5Q7kC&amp;pg=PA63&amp;dq=parallel+architectures+scalability&amp;hl=et&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bQZtUtTKC6SO4gT27oC4Ag&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=parallel%20architectures%20scalability&amp;f=false|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|date=April 2005|isbn=978-0-471-47839-3|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;



* A [[routing protocol]] is considered scalable with respect to network size, if the size of the necessary [[routing table]] on each node grows as [[Big O notation|O]](log ''N''), where ''N'' is the number of nodes in the network.
* A scalable [[online transaction processing]] system or [[database management system]] is one that can be upgraded to process more transactions by adding new processors, devices and storage, and which can be upgraded easily and transparently without shutting it down.
* Some early [[peer-to-peer]] (P2P) implementations of [[Gnutella]] had scaling issues. Each node query [[Query flooding|flooded]] its requests to all peers. The demand on each peer would increase in proportion to the total number of peers, quickly overrunning the peers' limited capacity. Other P2P systems like [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] scale well because the demand on each peer is independent of the total number of peers. There is no centralized bottleneck, so the system may expand indefinitely without the addition of supporting resources (other than the peers themselves).
* The distributed nature of the [[Domain Name System]] allows it to work efficiently even when all [[server (computing)|hosts]] on the worldwide [[Internet]] are served, so it is said to "scale well".

=={{Anchor|HORIZONTAL-SCALING|VERTICAL-SCALING}}Horizontal and vertical scaling==
Methods of adding more resources for a particular application fall into two broad categories: horizontal and vertical scaling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=4228359|conference=2007 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium|date=March 26, 2007|doi=10.1109/IPDPS.2007.370631|title=Scale-up x Scale-out: A Case Study using Nutch/Lucene|last1=Michael|first1=Maged|last2=Moreira|first2=Jose E.|last3=Shiloach|first3=Doron|last4=Wisniewski|first4=Robert W.|isbn=1-4244-0909-8|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* To '''scale horizontally''' (or '''scale out/in''') means to add more nodes to (or remove nodes from) a system, such as adding a new computer to a distributed software application. An example might involve scaling out from one Web server system to three. As computer prices have dropped and performance continues to increase, high-performance computing applications such as seismic analysis and biotechnology workloads have adopted low-cost "[[commodity server|commodity]]" systems for tasks that once would have required [[supercomputer]]s. System architects may configure hundreds of small computers in a [[computer cluster|cluster]] to obtain aggregate computing power that often exceeds that of computers based on a single traditional processor. The development of high-performance interconnects such as [[Gigabit Ethernet]], [[InfiniBand]] and [[Myrinet]] further fueled this model. Such growth has led to demand for software that allows efficient management and maintenance of multiple nodes, as well as hardware such as shared data storage with much higher I/O performance. ''Size scalability'' is the maximum number of processors that a system can accommodate.&lt;ref name="parallel_arch"/&gt;
* To '''scale vertically''' (or '''scale up/down''') means to add resources to (or remove resources from) a single node in a system, typically involving the addition of CPUs or memory to a single computer. Such vertical scaling of existing systems also enables them to use [[platform virtualization|virtualization]] technology more effectively, as it provides more resources for the hosted set of [[operating system]] and [[application software|application]] modules to share. Taking advantage of such resources can also be called "scaling up", such as expanding the number of [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]] daemon processes currently running. ''Application scalability'' is the improved performance of running applications on a scaled-up version of the system.&lt;ref name="parallel_arch"/&gt;

There are tradeoffs between the two models. Larger numbers of computers means increased management complexity, as well as a more complex programming model and issues such as throughput and latency between nodes; also, [[Amdahl's Law|some applications do not lend themselves to a distributed computing model]]. In the past, the price difference between the two models has favored "scale up" computing for those applications that fit its paradigm, but recent advances in virtualization technology have blurred that advantage, since deploying a new virtual system over a [[hypervisor]] (where possible) is often less expensive than actually buying and installing a real one. Configuring an existing idle system has always been less expensive than buying, installing, and configuring a new one, regardless of the model.

'''Note that [[Network function virtualization|NFV]] defines these terms differently''': scaling out/in is the ability to scale by add/remove resource instances (e.g. virtual machine), whereas scaling up/down is the ability to scale by changing allocated resources (e.g. memory/CPU/storage capacity)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Network Functions Virtualisation (NFV); Terminology for Main Concepts in NFV|url=http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/NFV/001_099/001/01.01.01_60/gs_NFV003v010201p.pdf}} {{Dead link|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Database scalability==
A number of different approaches enable [[database]]s to grow to very large size while supporting an ever-increasing rate of [[Transactions Per Second|transactions per second]]. The rapid pace of hardware advances in both the speed and capacity of [[mass storage]] devices, as well as similar advances in CPU and networking speed is also important.

One technique supported by most of the major [[Database management system|database management system (DBMS)]] products is the [[Partition (database)|partitioning]] of large tables, based on ranges of values in a key field. In this manner, the database can be ''scaled out'' across a cluster of separate [[database server]]s. Also, with the advent of 64-bit [[microprocessor]]s, [[Multi-core (computing)|multi-core]] CPUs, and large [[Symmetric multiprocessing|SMP multiprocessors]], DBMS vendors have been at the forefront of supporting [[Thread (computer science)|multi-threaded]] implementations that substantially ''scale up'' [[transaction processing]] capacity.

[[Network-attached storage|Network-attached storage (NAS)]] and [[Storage area network|Storage area networks (SANs)]] coupled with fast local area networks and [[Fibre Channel]] technology enable still larger, more loosely coupled configurations of databases and distributed computing power. The widely supported [[X/Open XA]] standard employs a global transaction monitor to coordinate [[distributed transaction]]s among semi-autonomous XA-compliant database resources. [[Oracle RAC]] uses a different model to achieve scalability, based on a "shared-everything" architecture that relies upon high-speed connections between servers.

While DBMS vendors debate the relative merits of their favored designs, some companies and researchers question the inherent limitations of [[relational database management system]]s. [[GigaSpaces]], for example, contends that an entirely different model of distributed data access and transaction processing, [[space-based architecture]], is required to achieve the highest performance and scalability. On the other hand, [[Base One]] makes the case for extreme scalability without departing from mainstream relational database technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Base One|url=http://www.boic.com/scalability.htm|title=Database Scalability - Dispelling myths about the limits of database-centric architecture|year=2007|accessdate=May 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; For specialized applications, [[NoSQL]] architectures such as Google's [[Bigtable]] can further enhance scalability. Google's horizontally distributed [[Spanner (distributed database technology)|Spanner]] technology, positioned as an relational alternative to Bigtable&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Google|url=https://cloud.google.com/storage-options/|title=Choosing a storage option|year=2018|accessdate=January 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, supports general-purpose [[database transaction]]s and provides a more conventional [[SQL]]-based query language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://static.googleusercontent.com/external_content/untrusted_dlcp/research.google.com/en//archive/spanner-osdi2012.pdf|title=Spanner: Google's Globally-Distributed Database|year= 2012|accessdate=September 30, 2012|isbn=978-1-931971-96-6|series=OSDI'12 Proceedings of the 10th USENIX conference on Operating Systems Design and Implementation|pages=251–264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strong versus eventual consistency (storage)==
In the context of scale-out [[Computer data storage|data storage]], scalability is defined as the maximum storage cluster size which guarantees full data consistency, meaning there is only ever one valid version of stored data in the whole cluster, independently from the number of redundant physical data copies. Clusters which provide "lazy" redundancy by updating copies in an asynchronous fashion are called [[Eventual consistency|'eventually consistent']]. This type of scale-out design is suitable when availability and responsiveness are rated higher than consistency, which is true for many web file hosting services or web caches (''if you want the latest version, wait some seconds for it to propagate''). For all classical transaction-oriented applications, this design should be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Eventual consistency by Werner Vogels|author=Sadek Drobi|url=http://www.infoq.com/news/2008/01/consistency-vs-availability|date=January 11, 2008|accessdate=April 8, 2017|publisher=InfoQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many open source and even commercial scale-out storage clusters, especially those built on top of standard PC hardware and networks, provide [[eventual consistency]] only. Idem some NoSQL databases like [[CouchDB]] and others mentioned above. Write operations invalidate other copies, but often don't wait for their acknowledgements. Read operations typically don't check every redundant copy prior to answering, potentially missing the preceding write operation. The large amount of metadata signal traffic would require specialized hardware and short distances to be handled with acceptable performance (i.e. act like a non-clustered storage device or database).

Whenever strong data consistency is expected, look for these indicators: 
* the use of InfiniBand, Fibrechannel or similar low-latency networks to avoid performance degradation with increasing cluster size and number of redundant copies. 
* short cable lengths and limited physical extent, avoiding signal runtime performance degradation.
* majority / quorum mechanisms to guarantee data consistency whenever parts of the cluster become inaccessible.

Indicators for [[Eventual consistency|eventually consistent]] designs (not suitable for transactional applications!) are:
* write performance increases linearly with the number of connected devices in the cluster.
* while the storage cluster is partitioned, all parts remain responsive. There is a risk of conflicting updates.

==Performance tuning versus hardware scalability==
It is often advised to focus system design on hardware scalability rather than on capacity. It is typically cheaper to add a new node to a system in order to achieve improved performance than to partake in [[performance tuning]] to improve the capacity that each node can handle. But this approach can have diminishing returns (as discussed in [[performance engineering]]). For example: suppose 70% of a program can be sped up if parallelized and run on multiple CPUs instead of one. If &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of a calculation that is sequential, and &lt;math&gt;1-\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction that can be parallelized, the maximum [[speedup]] that can be achieved by using P processors is given according to [[Amdahl's Law]]:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac 1 {\alpha+\frac{1-\alpha} P}.&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the value for this example, using 4 processors we get

: &lt;math&gt;\frac 1 {0.3+\frac{1-0.3} 4} = 2.105.&lt;/math&gt;

If we double the compute power to 8 processors we get

: &lt;math&gt;\frac 1 {0.3+\frac{1-0.3} 8} = 2.581.&lt;/math&gt;

Doubling the processing power has only improved the speedup by roughly one-fifth. If the whole problem was parallelizable, the speed would also double. Therefore, throwing in more hardware is not necessarily the optimal approach.

==Weak versus strong scaling==
In the context of [[high performance computing]] there are two common notions of scalability:
* The first is ''strong scaling'', which is defined as how the solution time varies with the number of processors for a fixed ''total'' problem size.
* The second is ''weak scaling'', which is defined as how the solution time varies with the number of processors for a fixed problem size ''per processor''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stfc.ac.uk/cse/25052.aspx|title=The Weak Scaling of DL_POLY 3|publisher=STFC Computational Science and Engineering Department|accessdate=March 8, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307224104/http://www.stfc.ac.uk/cse/25052.aspx|archivedate=March 7, 2014|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Semiotics}}
'''Semiosis''' (from the {{lang-el|σημείωσις}}, ''sēmeíōsis'', a derivation of the verb {{lang|grc|σημειῶ}}, ''sēmeiô'', "to mark") is any form of activity, conduct, or process that involves [[sign (semiotics)|signs]], including the production of [[meaning (semiotics)|meaning]]. Briefly – semiosis is sign process. The term was introduced by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] (1839–1914) to describe a process that interprets signs as referring to their objects, as described in his theory of [[sign relation]]s, or [[semiotics]]. Other theories of sign processes are sometimes carried out under the heading of semiology, following on the work of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] (1857–1913).

==Introduction to theory==

Peirce was interested primarily in [[logic]], while Saussure was interested primarily in [[linguistics]], which examines the functions and structures of [[language]]. However, both of them recognized that there is more to significant representation than language in the narrow sense of speech and writing alone.  With this in mind, they developed the idea of semiosis to relate language to other [[sign systems]] both human and nonhuman. Today, there is disagreement as to the operating cause and effect.  One school of thought argues that language is the semiotic prototype and its study illuminates principles that can be applied to other sign systems{{Citation needed|reason=Who?|date=February 2018}}. The opposing school argues that there is a metasign system and that language is simply one of many [[code (semiotics)|codes]] for communicating meaning, citing the way in which human infants learn about their environment before they have acquired verbal language{{Citation needed|reason=Who?|date=February 2018}}.  Whichever may be right, a preliminary definition of semiosis is any action or influence for communicating meaning by establishing relationships between signs which are to be interpreted by an [[audience]].

==Discussion==
Semiosis is the performance element involving signs. Although a human can communicate many ''things'' unintentionally, individuals usually speak or write to elicit some kind of response. Yet there is little real explanation of how semiosis produces its effects, which is odd given that the word "sign" is in everyday use and most people would understand what it means. But semiotics has not offered clear technical definitions, nor is there agreement about how signs should be classified. 

As an insect or animal, human or otherwise, moves through its environment (sometimes termed the [[umwelt]]), all the senses collect data that are made available to the brain. However, to prevent sensory overload, only [[Salience (semiotics)|salient]] data will receive the full attention of the cognitive elements of the mind. This indicates that a part of the process must be controlled by a [[model (abstract)|model]] of the real world capable of ranking data elements in terms of their significance and filtering out the data irrelevant to survival. A sign cannot function until the brain or audience distinguishes it from the background ''noise''. When this happens, the sign then triggers [[cognitive]] activity to interpret the data input and so convert it into meaningful information. This would suggest that, in the [[semiosphere]], the process of semiosis goes through the following cycle:
*The plant, insect, or animal with the need to communicate (e.g., to recognise an object of food) will ''know'' what needs to be ''said'' and assess the best means of ''saying'' it (e.g., starting a searching behaviour);
*This information will then be [[encode (Semiotics)|encoded]] and relevant muscle groups will effect transmission — although to some extent intentional in the human, the actual movements of the body are autonomic, i.e. the individual is not aware of moving individual muscles, but achieves the desired result by an act of will (see [[H. L. A. Hart]] on the nature of an [[Philosophy of action|action]]);
*The audience filters ambient data and perceives the uttered code as a grouping of signs;
*The audience then interprets the signs (sometimes termed [[decode (Semiotics)|decoding]]) to attribute meaning. This involves matching the signs received against existing patterns and their meanings held in memory (i.e. it is learned and understood within the [[community]]). In plants, insects and animals, the results of a successful interpretation will be an observable response to the stimuli perceived.
In [[biology]], scout bees and ants will return home to ''tell'' the others where food is to be found, the fact of fertility must be announced to prospective mates from the same species, and the presence of danger must be passed as a warning to others in the group. Such transmission may be chemical, auditory, visual, or tactile whether singly or in combination. There is a new field of research activity termed [[biosemiotics]], and Jesper Hoffmeyer claims that [[endosymbiosis]], self-reference, code duality, the availability of receptors, [[autopoiesis]], and others are the general properties of all living systems. [[Thomas Sebeok]]  suggests that a similar list of properties for life may coincide with the definition of semiosis, i.e. that the test of whether ''something'' is alive, is a test to determine whether and how it communicates meaning to another of its kind, i.e., whether it has semiosis. This has been called the Sebeok's Thesis.

For humans, semiosis is an aspect of the wider systems of social interaction in which information is exchanged. It can result in particular types of social encounter, but the process itself can be constrained by social [[Convention (norm)|convention]]s such as propriety, privacy, and disclosure. This means that no social encounter is reducible to semiosis alone, and that semiosis can only be understood by identifying and exploring all the conditions that make the transmission and reception of signs possible and effective. When two individuals meet, the ways in which they think, the specific identities they assume, the emotional responses they make, and the beliefs, motives, and purposes they have, will frame the situation as it develops dynamically and potentially test the legitimacy of the outcomes. All these elements are, to a greater or lesser extent, semiotic in nature in that prevailing codes and [[value (Semiotics)|values]] are being applied. Consequently, where the line is drawn between semiosis and semiotics will always be somewhat arbitrary.

'''Sensor-based sorting''', is an umbrella term for all applications where particles are singularly detected by a [[sensor]] technique and rejected by an amplified [[Mechanical system|mechanical]], [[Hydraulics|hydraulic]] or [[Pneumatics|pneumatic]] process. The technique is generally applied in the three industries [[mining]], [[recycling]] and [[food processing]] and used in the particle size range between {{convert|0.5|and|300|mm|in|abbr=on}}. Since sensor-based sorting is a single particle separation technology, the throughput is proportional to the average particle size and weight fed onto the machine.

== Functional principle of sensor-based sorting ==
The main subprocesses of sensor-based sorting are material conditioning, material presentation, detection, data processing and separation.&lt;ref&gt;Kleine, Christopher; Wotruba, Hermann and Robben, Mathilde: ''A new tool for mining engineers – The sensor-based sorter''. Sustainable Development in the Minerals Industry (SDIMI) Conference 2011, Aachen, Germany, {{ISBN|978-3-86797-119-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Material conditioning includes all operations which prepare the particles for being detected by the sensor. All optical sensors need clean material to be able to detect optical characteristics. Conditioning includes screening and cleaning of the feed material. The aim of the material presentation is the isolation of the particles by creating a single particle layer with the densest surface cover possible without particles touching each other and enough distance to each other allowing for a selective detection and rejection of each single particle.&lt;ref&gt;Wotruba, Hermann: ''Sensor Sorting Technology – Is the Minerals Industry Missing a Chance?''. Proceedings of XXIII International Minerals Processing Congress, IMPC 2006, Istanbul, Turkey&lt;/ref&gt; There are two types of sensor-based sorters: the chute type and the belt type. For both types the first step in acceleration is spreading out the particles by a vibrating feeder followed by either a fast belt or a chute. On the belt type the sensor usually detects the particles horizontally while they pass it on the belt. For the chute type the material detection is usually done vertically while the material passes the sensor in a free fall. The data processing is done in real time by a computer. The computer transfers the result of the data processing to an ultra fast ejection unit which, depending on the sorting decision, ejects a particle or lets it pass.&lt;ref&gt;Kleine, Christopher and Wotruba, Hermann: ''Added value to the mining industry by the integration of sensor based sorting''. Aachen international mining symposia, Mineral Resources and Mine Development, Institute of Mining Engineering I, May 26th and 27th 2010, 411-434&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sensor-based ore sorting ==

Sensor-based ore sorting is the terminology used for sensor-based sorting in the mining industry. It is a coarse physical coarse particle separation technology usually applied in the size range for {{convert|25|-|100|mm|in|abbr=on}}. Aim is either to create a lumpy product in [[ferrous]] metals, coal or industrial minerals applications or to reject waste before it enters production bottlenecks and more expensive comminution and concentration steps in the process. In the majority of all mining processes, particles of sub-economic grade enter the traditional comminution, classification and concentration steps. If the amount of sub-economic material in the above-mentioned fraction is roughly 25% or more, there is good potential that sensor-based ore sorting is a technically and financially viable option. High added value can be achieved with relatively low capital expenditure, especially when increasing the productivity through downstream processing of higher grade feed and through increased overal recovery when rejecting deleterious waste.

=== Introduction ===
Sensor-based sorting is a coarse particle separation technology applied in mining for the dry separation of bulk materials. The functional principle does not limit the technology to any kind of segment or mineral application but makes the technical viability mainly depend on the liberation characteristics at the size range {{convert|25|-|100|mm|in|abbr=on}}, which is usually sorted. If physical liberation is present there is a good potential that one of the sensors available on industrial scale sorting machines can differentiate between valuable and non-valuable particles. The separation is based on features measured with a detection technology that are used to derive a yes/no decision for actuation of usually pneumatic impulses. Sensor-based sorting is a disruptive technology in the mining industry which is universally applicable for all commodities. A comprehensive study examines both the technology's potential and its limitations, whilst providing a framework for application development and evaluation. All relevant aspects, from sampling to plant design and integration into mining and mineral processing systems, are covered.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Robben C, Characteristics of sensor-based sorting technology and implementation in mining [Book]. - Shaker Verlag GmbH, in der Schriftenreihe zur Aufbereitung und Veredlung, {{ISBN|978-3-8440-2498-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other terminologeis used in the industry include ''ore sorting, automated sorting, electronic sorting, '' and '' optical sorting''.

=== Definition ===
Sensor-based sorting has been introduced by Wotruba and Harbeck as an umbrella term for all applications where particles are singularly detected by a sensor technique and then rejected by an amplified mechanical, hydraulic or pneumatic process.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Wotruba, Hermann, und Hartmut Harbeck. "Sensor-Based Sorting." In Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry. Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Liberation characteristics ===
As for any other physical separation process, liberation is pre-requisite for possible separation. Liberation characteristics are well known and relatively easy to study for particulate lots in smaller size ranges, e.g. flotation feed and products. The analysis is essential for understanding the possible results of physical separation and relatively easy to conduct in laboratory on a couple of dozens of grams of sample which can be studied using optical methods or such as the QEMSCAN. For larger particles above {{convert|10|mm|in|abbr=on}} it is widely known for applications that are treated using density separation methods, such as coal or [[iron ore]]. Here, the washability analysis can be conducted on sample masses up to 10 tonnes in equipped laboratories.
For sensor-based sorting, where laboratory methods can only tell about the liberation characteristics where the describing feature is the density (e.g. iron ore, coal), hand counting, single-particle tests and bulk tests can reveal the liberation characteristics of a bulk material: Hereby, only single particle tests reveal the true liberation, while hand counting and bulk testing give a result which also incorporates the separation efficiency of the type of analysis.
More information on the testing procedures used in technical feasibility evaluation can be found in the respective chapter.

=== Historical development ===
The oldest form of mineral processing practiced since the [[Stone Age]] is hand-picking. [[Georgius Agricola]] also describes hand-picking is his book ''[[De re metallica]]'' in 1556.&lt;ref&gt;Agricola G De Re Metallica Libri XII [Book]. - Wiebaden : Fourier Verlag GmbH 2003, 1556.&lt;/ref&gt; Sensor-based sorting is the automation and extension to hand picking. In addition to sensors that measure visible differences like color (and the further interpretation of the data regarding texture and shape), other sensors are available on industrial scale sorters that are able to measure differences invisible for the human eye (EM, XRT, NIR).
The principles of the technology and the first machinery has been developed since the 1920s (.&lt;ref&gt;Sweet A T [Patent] : 1678884. - United States of America, 1928.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, widely applied and standard technology it is only in the industrial [[mineral]]s and [[gemstone]] segments. Mining is benefiting from the step change developments in sensing and computing technologies and from machine development in the recycling and food processing industries.
In 2002, Cutmore and Eberhard stated that the relatively small installed base of sensor-based sorters in mining is more a result of insufficient industry interest than any technical barriers to their effective use &lt;ref&gt;Cutmore, N. G. and Eberhardt, J. E. “The future of ore sorting in sustainable processing”. Cairns, Australia : s.n., 2002. Processing Conference 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
Nowadays sensor-based sorting is beginning to reveal its potential in various applications in basically all segments of mineral production (industrial minerals, gemstones, base-metals, precious metals, ferrous metals, fuel). Precondition is physical liberation in coarse size ranges (~{{convert|10|-|300|mm|abbr=on}}) to make physical separation possible. Either the product fraction, but more often the waste fraction needs to be liberated. If liberation is present, there is good potential that one of available detection technologies on today's sensor-based sorters can positively or negatively identify one of the two desired fractions.

=== Feed preparation ===
A size range coefficient of approximately three is advisable. A minimum amount of undersized fine material must enter the machines to optimize availability.
Moisture of the feed is not important, if the material is sufficiently dewatered and the undersize fraction is efficiently removed. For surface detection technologies sometimes spray water on the classifying screen is required to clean the surfaces. Surface detection technologies would otherwise measure the reflectance of the adhesions on the surface and a correlation to the particle's content is not given.

=== Main machine types ===
During the more than 80 years of technical development of sensor-based ore sorting equipment, various types of machines have been developed. This includes the channel-type, bucket-wheel type and cone type sorters.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton C G and Spackman R Gold ore sorting Nr. 4830193 [Patent]. - United States of America, Dec 29 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blagden T and Verboomen J Clean coal at the speed of light [Report]. - Caboolture, Australia : Australian Coal Industry's Research Program (ACARP) Project No C13052, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
The main machine types being installed in the mining industry today are belt-type and chute-type machines. Harbeck made a good comparison of both disadvantages and advantages of the systems for different sorting applications.&lt;ref&gt;Harbeck H and Kroog H New developments in sensor-based sorting [Journal] // Aufbereitungs Teechnik 49. - 2008. - pp. 4-11.&lt;/ref&gt; The selection of a machine-type for an application depends various case-dependent factors, including the detection system applied, particle size, moisture, yield amongst others.

==== Chute-type machine ====
The chute-type machine has a lower footprint and fewer moving parts which results in lower investment and operating costs. In general, it is more applicable to well liberated material and surface detection, because a double sided scanning is possible on a more reliable on the system. The applicable top size of the chute-type machine is bigger, as material handling of particles up to {{convert|300|mm|in|abbr=on}} is only technically viable on this setup.
[[File:Chute-type machine.jpg|thumb|Side view and working principle of chute-type sensor-based ore sorting machine]]

==== Belt-type machine ====
The belt-type machine is generally more applicable to smaller and to adhesive feed. In addition, the feed presentation is more stable which makes it more applicable for more difficult and heterogienous applications.
[[File:Belt-type machine.jpg|thumb|Side view and working principle of belt-type sensor-based ore sorting machine]]

=== Sub-processes ===
The separation in both machine types comprises the following sub-processes:

==== Feed distribution ====
A sized screen fraction with a size range coefficient (d95/d5) of 2-5 (optimal 2-3) is fed onto a vibratory feeder which has the function to create a mono-layer, by pre-accelerating the particles. A common misunderstanding in plant design is, that you can use the vibratory feeder to discharge from a buffer bunker but a separate units needs to be applied, since the feed distribution is very important to the efficiency of the sensor-based sorter and different loads on the feeder change its position and vibration characteristics.

==== Presentation ====
The feed is then transferred to the presentation mechanism which is the belt or the chute in the two main machine types respectively. This sub-process has the function to pass single particles of the material stream in a stable and predictable manner, thus in a unidirectional movement orthogonal to the detection line with uniform speed profile.

==== Detection ====
In the detection sub-process location and property vectors are recorded to allow particle localization for ejection and material classification for discrimination purposes. All detection technologies applied have in common to be cheap, contactless and fast. The technologies are subdivided in transmitting and reflecting groups, the first measuring the inner content of a particle while the later only uses the surface reflection for discrimination. Surface, or reflection technologies have the disadvantage that the surfaces need to be representing the content, thus need to be clean from clay and dust adhesions. But by default surface reflection technologies violate the Fundamental Sampling Principle because not all components of a particle have the same probability of being detected. The main transmitting technologies are EM ([[Electromagnetism|Electromagnetics]]) and XRT ([[X-ray]]-Transmission). EM detection is based on the conductivity of the material passing an alternating [[electromagnetic field]]. The principle of XRT is widely known through the application in medical diagnostics and airport luggage scanners. The main surface or reflection technologies are traditionally X-ray [[luminescence]] detectors capturing the [[fluorescence]] of [[diamond]]s under the [[Excited state|excitation]] of X-ray radiation and color cameras detecting brightness and colour difference. Spectroscopic methods such as [[Infrared spectroscopy|near-infrared spectroscopy]] known from remote sensing in exploration in mining for decades, have found their way into industrial scale sensor-based sorters. Advantage of the application of near-infrared spectroscopy is that the evidence can be measured on the presence of specific [[Covalent bond|molecular bonds]], thus minerals composition of the near-infrared active minerals.&lt;ref&gt;Wotruba, H., Robben, M.R., Balthasar, D., Near-infrared sensor-based sorting in the minerals industry. In Proc. Conference in minerals engineering. Luleå Technical University, Lulea (Sweden), 2009, pp. 163–176)&lt;/ref&gt; There is more detection technologies available on industrial scale sensor-based ore sorters. Readers that want to go into detail can find more in the literature.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==== Data processing ====
Spectral and spatial is collected by the detection system. The spatial component catches the position of the particles distribution across the width of the sorting machine, which is then used in case the ejection mechanism is activated for a single particle. Spectral data comprises the features that are used for material discrimination. In a superseding processing step, spectral and spatial can be combined to include patterns into the separation criterion.
Huge amount of data is collected in real time multiple processing and filtering steps are bringing the data down to the Yes/no decision – either for ejecting a particle or for keeping the ejection mechanism still for that one.

==== Ejection ====
The state-of-the-art mechanism of today's sensor-based ore sorters is a pneumatic ejection. Here, a combination of high speed air valves and an array of nozzles perpendicular to the acceleration belt or chute allows precise application of air pulses to change the direction of flight of single particles. The nozzle pitch and diameter is adapted to the particle size. The air impulse must be precise enough to change the direction of flight of a single particle by applying the drag force to this single particle and directing it over the mechanical splitter plate.

=== Installations ===
Sensor-based sorting installations normally comprise the following basic units; crusher, screen, sensor-based sorter and compressor. There are principally two different kinds of installations that are described in the following paragraphs – stationary and semi-mobile installations.

==== Semi-mobile installations ====
Transportable semi-mobile installations have gained increasing popularity in the last two decades. They are enabled by the fact that complete sensor-based sorting systems are relatively compact in relation to the capacity in tonnes per hour. This is mainly because little infrastructure is needed. The picture shows a containerised sensor-based sorter which is applied in Chromitite sorting. The system is operated in conjunction with a Diesel-powered mobile crusher and screen. Material handling of the feed, undersize fraction, product and waste fraction is conducted using a wheel loader. The system is powered by a Diesel generator and a compressor station delivers the instrument quality air needed for the operation.
Semi-mobile installations are applied primarily to minimise material handling and save transport costs. Another reason for choosing the semi-mobile option for an installation is bulk testing of new ore bodies.
Capacity of a system very much depends on the size fraction sorted, but a 250tph capacity is a good estimate for semi-mobile installations, considering a capacity of 125tph sorter feed and 125tph undersize material.
During the last decade both generic plant designs and customised designs have been developed, for example in the framework of the i2mine project.&lt;ref&gt;i2mine Innovative technologies and concepts for the intelligent deep mine of the future – European Commission under the Cooperation Programme of the 7th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development in the 'Nanosciences, Nanotechnologies, Materi [Online] // Project overview. - 2012. - 22 May 2012. - http://www.i2mine.eu/.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Modular Plant.jpg|thumb|Containerised sensor-based ore sorter applied in a modular plant operated as semi-mobile installation]]

==== Stationary installations ====
To cope with high volume mass flows and for application, where a changing physical location of the sensor-based sorting process is of no benefit for the financial feasibility of the operation, stationary installations are applied. Another reason for applying stationary installations are multistage (Rougher, Scavenger, Cleaner) sensor-based ore sorting processes. Within stationary installations, sorters are usually located in parallel, which allows transport of the discharge fractions with one product and one waste belt respectively, which decreases plant footprint and amount of conveyors.

=== Positions in the flow-sheet ===

==== Lumpy ore production ====
For higher grade applications such as ferrous metals, coal and industrial minerals, sensor-based ore sorting can be applied to create a final product. Pre-condition is, that the liberation allows for the creation of a sellable product. Undersize material is usually bypassed as product, but can also be diverted to the waste fraction, if the composition does not meet the required specifications. This is case and application dependant.
[[File:Lumpy ore production.tif|thumb|Simplified flow-sheet for lumpy ore production]]

==== Waste rejection ====
Most prominent example of the application of sensor-based ore sorting is the rejection of barren waste before transporting and comminution. Waste rejection is also known under the term pre-concentration. A discrimination has been introduced by Robben.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Rule of thumb is that at least 25% of liberated barren waste must be present in the fraction to be treated by sensor-based ore sorting to make waste rejection financially feasible.
Reduction of waste before it enters comminution and grinding processes does not only reduce the costs in those processes, but also releases the capacity that can be filled with higher grade material and thus implies higher productivity of the system. A prejudice against the application of a waste rejection process is, that the valuable content lost in this process is a penalty higher than the savings that can be achieved. But it is reported in the literature that the overall recovery even increases through bringing higher grade material as feed into the mill. In addition, the higher productivity is an additional source of income. If noxious waste such as acid consuming calcite is removed, the downstream recovery increases and the downstream costs decrease disproportionally as reported for example by Bergmann.&lt;ref&gt;Bergmann, J. Sensor-Based Sorting – Experience, Technology and Opportunities. Falmouth, UK : Minerals Engineering International, 2011. Proceedings of Physical Separation 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The coarse waste rejected can be an additional source of income if there is a local market for aggregates.
[[File:Waste rejection.tif|thumb|Simplified flow-sheet for waste rejection with sensor-based ore sorting]]

==== Marginal ore treatment ====
Sensor-based ore sorting is financially especially attractive for low grade or marginal ore or waste dump material.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; This described scenario describes that waste dump material or marginal ore is sorted and added to the run-of-mine production. The needed capacity for the sensor-based ore sorting step is less in this case such as the costs involved. Requirement is that two crude material streams are fed in parallel, requiring two crushing stations. Alternatively, marginal and high grade ore can be buffered on an intermediate stockpile and dispatched in an alternating operation. The latter option has the disadvantage that the planned production time, the loading, of the sensor-based ore sorter is low, unless a significant intermediate stockpile or bunker is installed.
Treating the marginal ore separately has the advantage that less equipment is needed since the processed material stream is lower, but it has the disadvantage that the potential of the technology is not unfolded for the higher grade material, where sensor-based sorting would also add benefit.
[[File:Marginal ore treatment.tif|thumb|Simplified flow-sheet for marginal ore treatment with sensor-based ore sorting]]

==== Sensor-based ore sorting in pebble-circuit of autogenious and semi-autogenious mills ====
Pebble circuits are a very advandageous location for the application of sensor-based ore sorters. Usually it is hard waste recirculating and limiting the total mill capacity. In addition, the tonnage is significantly lower in comparison to the total run-of-mine stream, the size range is applicable and usually uniform and the particles' surfaces are clean. High impact on total mill capacity is reported in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;K. Seerane (Rio Tinto Group) and G. Rech (CommodasUltrasort), "Investigation of sorting technology to remove hard pebbles and recover copper bearing rocks from an autogenious mill circuit", The Southern African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy (SAIMM) 6th Southern African Base Metals Conference 2011, Phalaborwa, Republic of South Africa&lt;/ref&gt;

Sensor-based sorting can be applied to separate the coarse fraction of the run-of-mine material according to its characteristics. Possible separation criteria are grade, mineralogy, grade and grindability amongst others. Treating different ore types separately results either in an optimised cash flow in the sense, that revenue ist shifted to an earlier point in time, or increased overall recovery which translates to higher productivity and thus revenue. If two separate plant lines are installed, the increased productivity must compensate for the overall higher capital expenditure and operating costs.

=== Economic impact ===
Sensor-based ore sorting is in comparison to other coarse particle separation technologies relatively cheap. While the costs for the equipment itself are relatively high in capital expenditure and operating costs, the absence of extensive infrastructure in a system results in operating costs that are to be compared to jigging. The specific costs are very much depending on the average particle size of the feed and on the ease of the separation. Coarser particles imply higher capacity and thus less costs. Detailed costing can be conducted after the mini-bulk stage in the technical feasibility evaluation.
Prejudice against waste rejection with sensor-based sorting widely spread, that the loss of valuables, thus the recovery penalty of this process, supersedes the potential downstream cost savings and is therefore economically not viable. It must be noted that for waste rejection the aim for the separation with sensor-based ore sorting must be put onto maximum recovery, which means that only low grade or barren waste is rejected because the financial feasibility is very much sensitive to that factor. Nevertheless, through the rejection of waste before comminution and concentration steps, recovery can be often increased in the downstream process, meaning that the overall recovery is equal or even higher than the one in the base case, meaning that instead of losing product, additional product can be produced, which adds the additional revenue to the cost savings on the positive side in the cash flow.
If the rejected material is replaced with additional higher grade material, the main economic benefit unfolds through the additional production. It implies, that in conjunction with sensor-based ore sorting, the capacity of the crushing station is increased, to allow for the additional mass-flow that is subsequently taken out by the sensor-based ore sorters as waste.

=== Technical feasibility testing ===

==== Bulk characterisation ====
Precondition for the applicability of sensor-based ore sorting is the presence of liberation at the particle size of interest. Before entering into sensor-based ore sorting testing procedures there is the possibility to assess the degree of liberation through the inspection of drill cores, hand-counting and washability analysis. The quantification of liberation does not include any process efficiencies, but gives an estimate of the possible sorting result and can thus be applied for desktop financial feasibility analysis.
Drill core analysis
Both for green-field and brown-field applications, inspection of drill core in combination with the grade distribution and mineralogical description is a good option for estimation of the liberation characteristics and the possible success of sensor-based ore sorting. In combination with the mining method and mine plan, an estimation of possible grade distribution in coarse particles can be done.

===== Hand counting =====
Hand-counting is a cheap and easy to conduct method to estimate the liberation characteristics of a bulk sample wither originating from run-of-mine material, a waste dump or for example exploration trenching. Analysis of particles in the size range 10-100mm has been conducted on a total sample mass of 10 tonnes. By visual inspection of trained personnel, a classification of each particle into different bins (e.g. lithology, grade) is possible and the distribution is determined by weighing each bin. A trained professional can quickly estimate the efficiency of a specific detection and process efficiency of sensor-based ore sorting knowing the sensor response of the mineralogy of ore in question and other process efficiency parameters.

===== Washability analysis =====
The washability analysis is widely known in bulk material analysis, where the specific density is the physical property describing the liberation and the separation results, which is then in the form of the partition curve. The partition curve is defined as the curve which gives as a function of a physical property or characteristic, the proportions in which different elemental classes of raw feed having the same property are split into separate products.&lt;ref&gt;Sanders G J The principles of coal preparation [Book]. - Newcastle, Australia: Australian Coal Preparation Society, 2007. - Vol. IV.&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus per its definition not limited to, but predominantly applied in analysis of liberation and process efficiency of density separation processes.
For sensor-based ore sorting, the partition (also called Tromp) curves for chromite, iron ore and coal are known and can thus be applied for process modelling.

===== Single particle testing =====
Single particle testing is an extensive but powerful laboratory procedure developed by Tomra. Outo of a sample set of multiple hundreds of fragments in the size range 30-60mm are measured individually on each of the available detection technologies. After recording of the raw data, all the fragments are comminute and assayed individually which then allows plotting of the liberation function of the sample set and in addition, the detection efficiency of each detection technology in combination with the calibration method applied. This makes the evaluation of detection and calibration and subsequently the selection of the most powerful combination possible. This analysis is possible to be applied on quarters or half sections of drill core.

===== (Mini-) bulk testing =====
Mini-bulk tests are conducted with 1-100t of samples on industrial scale sensor-based ore sorters. The size fraction intervals to be treated are prepared using screen classifications. Full capacity is established then with each fraction and multiple cut-points are programmed in the sorting software. After creating multiple sorting fractions in rougher, scavenger and cleaner steps these weighed are sent for assays. The resulting data delivers all input for flow-sheet development. Since the tests are conducted on industrial scale equipment, there is no scale-up factor involved when designing a flow-sheet and installation of sensor-based ore sorting.

===== Bulk/ pilot testing =====
To gather relevant statistical data higher sample masses are needed in some cases. Thus, transportation of the sample into the mini-bulk testing facility becomes unviable and the equipment is set up in the field. Containerised units in conjunction with Diesel-powered crushing and screening equipment are often applied and used for production test runs under full scale operating conditions.

=== Process efficiency ===
The process efficiency of sensor-based ore sorting is described in detail by C. Robben in 2014.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  The total process efficiency is subdivided into the following sub-process efficiencies; Platform efficiency, preparation efficiency, presentation efficiency, detection efficiency and separation efficiency. All the sub-process contribute to the total process efficiency, of course in combination with the liberation characteristics of the bulk material that the technology is applied to. The detailed description of the sib-processes and their contribution to the total process efficiency can be found in the literature.

In an article in the Brooklyn ''New York Daily News'', staff writer Elizabeth Lazarowitz quotes Steven Zucker, "Art can be really intimidating for people", said Zucker. "If we can make art feel exciting and interesting and very much relevant to a historical moment...art can have real meaning." Unlike reading about art in a book, "the idea of the audio was to keep a student's eyes on the image", he explained. "It helped students to learn the material a lot better."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/brooklyn/2011/02/25/2011-02-25_masterpiece_theater_vids_new_way_to_look_at_art.html "Brooklyn-based art historians launch website with videos of masterpieces" New York Daily News, 2/25/2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a collaborative article by Beth Harris and Steven Zucker, the founders explain the value of the resource for teachers, students, and informal learners: "Smarthistory is helping teachers who are not specialists in art history find strategies to make the subject accessible and meaningful to students who might otherwise not have cultural resources available to them. And for college students, the site is fast becoming an attractive alternative to the commercial textbook whose short life cycle and $100+ price tag has increasingly become a barrier."&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:bhHeVbf82cEJ:openaccess.uoc.edu/webapps/o2/bitstream/10609/5081/6/Zucker_editat.pdf+beth+harris+smarthistory&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESjS1HrPqlUZBCUfp3VYz0UDmX0KBXi1hn_R1Vra7yaTP9uIjdKlRBELcD0KzrArBHzEjHI7bpvF52q0sVV9r7PUl9nYH10GExmuJ_QhmyveHLm9Gpha9t4dckaOwhzwn74C1YUk&amp;sig=AHIEtbT5zd1NJEjqrV1SEwwquFk6RBcNAw "Conversation is Key: A Short History of Smarthistory.org"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a ''Chronicle for Higher Education'' article, Beth Harris is quoted on the ambitions and goals of Smarthistory: "We really just wanted to re-embed the objects in our world", says Harris, who is the founder and executive editor of Smarthistory as well as the director of digital learning at a New York City museum. "We thought that that would make them more relevant and more engaging for students."&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/%E2%80%98smarthistory%E2%80%99-rethinks-the-art-history-textbook-online/28395 "'Smarthistory' rethinks the art history textbook online"]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''spatial network''' (sometimes also '''[[Geometric graph theory|geometric graph]]''') is a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] in which the [[Vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] or [[Edge (graph theory)|edges]] are ''spatial elements'' associated with [[Geometry|geometric]] objects, i.e. the nodes are located in a space equipped with a certain [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]].&lt;ref name="Bart"&gt;M. Barthelemy, "Spatial Networks", Physics Reports 499:1-101 (2011) ( https://arxiv.org/abs/1010.0302 ).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bart2"&gt;M. Barthelemy, "Morphogenesis of Spatial Networks", Springer (2018).&lt;/ref&gt; The simplest mathematical realization is a [[Lattice graph|lattice]] or a [[random geometric graph]], where nodes are distributed uniformly at random over a two-dimensional plane; a pair of nodes are connected if the [[Euclidean distance]] is smaller than a given neighborhood radius. [[Transport network|Transportation and mobility networks]], [[Internet]], [[cellular network|mobile phone networks]], [[electrical grid|power grids]], [[social network|social and contact networks]] and [[neural network]]s are all examples where the underlying space is relevant and where the graph's [[topology]] alone does not contain all the information. Characterizing and understanding the structure, resilience and the evolution of spatial networks is crucial for many different fields ranging from urbanism to epidemiology.

== Examples ==
An urban spatial network can be constructed by abstracting intersections as nodes and streets as links, which is referred to as, [[Transportation network (graph theory)|transportation network]]. Beijing traffic was studied as a dynamic network and its percolation properties have been found useful to identify systematic bottlenecks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=D.|last2=Fu|first2=B.|last3=Wang|first3=Y.|last4=Lu|first4=G.|last5=Berezin|first5=Y.|last6=Stanley|first6=H.E.|last7=Havlin|first7=S.|date=2015|title=Percolation transition in dynamical traffic network with evolving critical bottlenecks|url=|journal=PNAS|volume=112|pages=669|via=|bibcode=2015PNAS..112..669L|doi=10.1073/pnas.1419185112|pmc=4311803}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One might think of the 'space map' as being the negative image of the standard map, with the open space cut out of the background buildings or walls.&lt;ref name="SocLo"&gt;Hillier B, Hanson J, 1984, The social logic of space (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characterizing spatial networks==
The following aspects are some of the characteristics to examine a spatial network:&lt;ref name="Bart" /&gt;
* Planar networks
In many applications, such as rail, roads, and other transportation networks the network is assumed to be [[planar graph|planar]]. Planar networks build up an important group out of the spatial networks, but not all spatial networks are planar. Indeed, the airline passenger
networks is a non-planar example: All airports in the world are connected through direct flights. 
* The way it is embedded in space
There are examples of networks, which seem to be not "directly" embedded in space. Social networks for instance
connect individuals through friendship relations. But in this case, space intervenes in the fact that the connection
probability between two individuals usually decreases with the distance between them.
* Voronoi tessellation
A spatial network can be represented by a [[Voronoi diagram]], which is a way of dividing space into a number of regions.  The dual graph for a Voronoi diagram corresponds to the [[Delaunay triangulation]] for the same set of points.
Voronoi tessellations are interesting for spatial networks in the sense that they provide a natural representation model
to which one can compare a real world network.
* Mixing space and topology

[[File:Lattice network 2d.png|alt=Lattice network in two dimensions|thumb|Fig. 1. Lattice network in two dimensions. The balls are the nodes the edges connecting neighboring nodes are the links.]]
[[File:Spatially interdependent networks.png|alt=Spatially interdependent networks|thumb|Fig. 2. Spatially interdependent networks. Two square lattices A and B, where in each lattice a node has two types of links: connectivity links and dependency links. Every node is connected (with connectivity links) to its four nearest neighbors within the same lattice via connectivity links and a fraction of nodes in each network have dependency links to the other network. If a node fail in one network its dependent node in the other network will also fail, even if it is still connected to its network via connectivity links.]]
Examining the topology of the nodes and edges itself is another way to characterize networks.  The distribution of [[Degree (graph theory)|degree]] of the nodes is often considered, regarding the structure of edges it is useful to find the [[Minimum spanning tree]], or the generalization, the [[Steiner tree]] and the [[relative neighborhood graph]].
[[File:Lattice-layout-z15.png|thumb|Fig. 3:  Spatially embedded multiplex networks. The nodes occupy regular locations in two-dimensional lattice  while the links in each layer (blue and green) have lengths
that are exponentially distributed with characteristic length
ζ = 3 and are connected at random with degree k=4.]]

==Lattice networks==
 
Lattice networks (see Fig. 1) are useful models  for spatial embedded networks. Many physical phenomenas have been studied on these structures. Examples include Ising model for spontaneous magnetization,&lt;ref name="McCoyWu1968"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCoy|first1=Barry M.|last2=Wu|first2=Tai Tsun|title=Theory of a Two-Dimensional Ising Model with Random Impurities.

==Probability and spatial networks ==
In the "real" world many aspects of networks are not deterministic - randomness plays an important role. For example, new links, representing friendships, in social networks are in a certain manner random. Modelling spatial networks in respect of stochastic operations is consequent. In many cases the [[spatial Poisson process]] is used to approximate data sets of processes on spatial networks. Other stochastic aspects of interest are: 
* The [[Poisson line process]]
* Stochastic geometry: the [[Erdős–Rényi model|Erdős–Rényi graph]]
* [[Percolation theory]]

==Approach from the theory of space syntax==
Another definition of spatial network derives from the theory of [[space syntax]]. It can be notoriously difficult to decide what a spatial element should be in complex spaces involving large open areas or many interconnected paths. The originators of space syntax, Bill Hillier and Julienne Hanson use [[axial line]]s and [[convex space]]s as the spatial elements. Loosely, an axial line is the 'longest line of sight and access' through open space, and a convex space the 'maximal convex polygon' that can be drawn in open space. Each of these elements is defined by the geometry of the local boundary in different regions of the space map. Decomposition of a space map into a complete set of intersecting axial lines or overlapping convex spaces produces the axial map or overlapping convex map respectively. Algorithmic definitions of these maps exist, and this allows the mapping from an arbitrary shaped space map to a network amenable to graph mathematics to be carried out in a relatively well defined manner. Axial maps are used to analyse [[urban network]]s, where the system generally comprises linear segments, whereas convex maps are more often used to analyse [[building|building plans]] where space patterns are often more convexly articulated, however both convex and axial maps may be used in either situation.

Currently, there is a move within the space syntax community to integrate better with [[geographic information system]]s (GIS), and much of the [[Spatial network analysis software|software]] they produce interlinks with commercially available GIS systems.

==History==
While networks and graphs were already for a long time the subject
of many studies in [[mathematics]], physics, mathematical sociology,
[[computer science]], spatial networks have been studied intensively during the 1970s in quantitative geography. Objects of studies in geography are inter alia locations, activities and flows of individuals, but also networks evolving in time and space.&lt;ref name="NetAnal"&gt;P. Haggett and R.J. Chorley. ''Network analysis in geog-
raphy''. Edward Arnold, London, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the important problems such
as the location of nodes of a network, the evolution of
transportation networks and their interaction with population
and activity density are addressed in these earlier
studies. On the other side, many important points still remain unclear, partly because at that time datasets of large networks and larger computer capabilities were lacking.  
Recently, spatial networks have been the subject of studies in [[Statistics]], to connect probabilities and stochastic processes with networks in the real world.&lt;ref name="David"&gt;http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/206-SNET/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''stamped circuit board''' ('''SCB''') is used to mechanically support and electrically connect [[electronic component]]s using [[Conductor (material)|conductive]] pathways, tracks or [[signal trace|trace]]s [[industrial etching|etch]]ed from copper sheets [[laminated]] onto a non-conductive ''substrate''. This technology is used for small circuits, for instance in the production of [[Light-emitting diode|LED]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ledsmagazine.com/press/21258 Heraeus SCB technology enhances thermal management in LED luminaires], LEDs Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to [[printed circuit board]]s this layer structure may comprise glass-fibre reinforced epoxy resin and copper. Basically, in the case of LED substrates three variations are possible: 
# the PCB (printed circuit board),
# plastic-injection molding and
# the SCB.

Using the SCB technology it is possible to structure and laminate the most widely differing material combinations in a reel-to-reel production process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.displayplus.net/xe/37141 Heraeus SCB technology enhances thermal management in LED luminaires], Display Plus&lt;/ref&gt; As the layers are structured separately, improved design concepts are able to be implemented. Consequently, a far better and quicker heat dissipation from within the chip is achieved.

== Production ==
Both the plastic and the metal are initially processed on separate reels, .i.e. in accordance with the requirements the materials are individually structured by stamping (“brought into form“) and then merged.

== Advantages ==
The engineering respectively choice of substrates actually comes down to the particular application, module design/substrate assembly, material and thickness of the material involved.

Taking these parameters it is possible to attain a good thermal management by using SCB technology, because rapid heat dissipation from beneath the chip means a longer service life for the system. Furthermore, SCB technology allows the material to be chosen to correspond to the pertinent requirements and then to optimize the design to arrive at a “perfect fit”.

'''Structural genomics''' seeks to describe the [[Protein Structure|3-dimensional structure]] of every protein encoded by a given [[genome]]. This genome-based approach allows for a high-throughput method of structure determination by a combination of [[protein structure prediction|experimental and modeling approaches]]. The principal difference between structural genomics and [[protein structure prediction|traditional structural prediction]] is that structural genomics attempts to determine the structure of every protein encoded by the genome, rather than focusing on one particular protein. With full-genome sequences available, structure prediction can be done more quickly through a combination of experimental and modeling approaches, especially because the availability of large number of sequenced genomes and previously solved protein structures allows scientists to model protein structure on the structures of previously solved homologs.

Because protein structure is closely linked with protein function, the structural genomics has the potential to inform knowledge of protein function. In addition to elucidating protein functions, structural genomics can be used to identify novel protein folds and potential targets for drug discovery. Structural genomics involves taking a large number of approaches to structure determination, including experimental methods using genomic sequences or modeling-based approaches based on sequence or [[homology modeling|structural homology]] to a protein of known structure or based on chemical and physical principles for a protein with no homology to any known structure.

As opposed to traditional [[structural biology]], the determination of a [[protein structure]] through a structural genomics effort often (but not always) comes before anything is known regarding the protein function. This raises new challenges in [[structural bioinformatics]], i.e. determining protein function from its [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] structure.

Structural genomics emphasizes high throughput determination of protein structures. This is performed in dedicated [[Protein Structure Initiative#External links|centers of structural genomics]].

While most structural biologists pursue structures of individual proteins or protein groups, specialists in structural genomics pursue structures of proteins on a genome wide scale. This implies large-scale cloning, expression and purification. One main advantage of this approach is economy of scale. On the other hand, the scientific value of some resultant structures is at times questioned. A ''Science'' article from January 2006 analyzes the structural genomics field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chandonia JM, Brenner SE |title=The impact of structural genomics: expectations and outcomes |journal=Science |volume=311 |issue=5759 |pages=347–51 |date=January 2006 |pmid=16424331 |doi=10.1126/science.1121018 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/311/5759/347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One advantage of structural genomics, such as the [[Protein Structure Initiative]], is that the scientific community gets immediate access to new structures, as well as to reagents such as clones and protein. A disadvantage is that many of these structures are of proteins of unknown function and do not have corresponding publications. This requires new ways of communicating this structural information to the broader research community. The Bioinformatics core of the Joint center for structural genomics (JCSG) has recently developed a wiki-based approach namely [[Open protein structure annotation network]] (TOPSAN) for annotating protein structures emerging from high-throughput structural genomics centers.

== Goals==
One goal of structural genomics is to identify novel protein folds. Experimental methods of protein structure determination require proteins that express and/or crystallize well, which may inherently bias the kinds of proteins folds that this experimental data elucidate. A genomic, modeling-based approach such as [[de novo protein structure prediction|''ab initio'' modeling]] may be better able to identify novel protein folds than the experimental approaches because they are not limited by experimental constraints.

Protein function depends on 3-D structure and these 3-D structures are more highly conserved than [[peptide sequence|sequences]]. Thus, the high-throughput structure determination methods of structural genomics have the potential to inform our understanding of protein functions.  This also has potential implications for drug discovery and protein engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kuhn P, Wilson K, Patch MG, Stevens RC |title=The genesis of high-throughput structure-based drug discovery using protein crystallography |journal=Curr Opin Chem Biol |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=704–10 |date=October 2002 |pmid=12413557 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1367593102003617 |doi=10.1016/S1367-5931(02)00361-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, every protein that is added to the structural database increases the likelihood that the database will include homologous sequences of other unknown proteins. The [[Protein Structure Initiative]] (PSI) is a multifaceted effort funded by the [[National Institutes of Health]] with various academic and industrial partners that aims to increase knowledge of protein structure using a structural genomics approach and to improve structure-determination methodology.

== Methods ==
Structural genomics takes advantage of completed genome sequences in several ways in order to determine protein structures.  The gene sequence of the target protein can also be compared to a known sequence and structural information can then be inferred from the known protein’s structure. Structural genomics can be used to predict novel protein folds based on other structural data.  Structural genomics can also take modeling-based approach that relies on homology between the unknown protein and a solved protein structure.

=== ''de novo'' methods ===
Completed genome sequences allow every [[open reading frame]] (ORF), the part of a gene that is likely to contain the sequence for the [[messenger RNA]] and protein, to be cloned and expressed as protein. These proteins are then purified and crystallized, and then subjected to one of two types of structure determination: [[X-ray crystallography]] and [[Protein nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR).  The whole genome sequence allows for the design of every primer required in order to amplify all of the ORFs, clone them into bacteria, and then express them.  By using a whole-genome approach to this traditional method of protein structure determination, all of the proteins encoded by the genome can be expressed at once.  This approach allows for the structural determination of every protein that is encoded by the genome.

=== Modelling-based methods===

==== ''ab initio''  modeling====
This approach uses protein sequence data and the chemical and physical interactions of the encoded amino acids to predict the 3-D structures of proteins with no homology to solved protein structures. One highly successful method for ''ab initio'' modeling is the [[Rosetta@home|Rosetta]] program, which divides the protein into short segments and arranges short polypeptide chain into a low-energy local conformation.  Rosetta is available for commercial use and for non-commercial use through its public program, Robetta.

====Sequence-based modeling====
This modeling technique compares the gene sequence of an unknown protein with sequences of proteins with known structures. Depending on the degree of similarity between the sequences, the structure of the known protein can be used as a model for solving the structure of the unknown protein. Highly accurate modeling is considered to require at least 50% amino acid sequence identity between the unknown protein and the solved structure. 30-50% sequence identity gives a model of intermediate-accuracy, and sequence identity below 30% gives low-accuracy models.  It has been predicted that at least 16,000 protein structures will need to be determined in order for all structural motifs to be represented at least once and thus allowing the structure of any unknown protein to be solved accurately through modeling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Baker D, Sali A |title=Protein structure prediction and structural genomics |journal=Science |volume=294 |issue=5540 |pages=93–6 |date=October 2001 |pmid=11588250 |doi=10.1126/science.1065659 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11588250}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One disadvantage of this method, however, is that structure is more conserved than sequence and thus 	sequence-based modeling may not be the most accurate way to predict protein structures.

====Threading====
[[Threading (protein sequence)|Threading]] bases structural modeling on fold similarities rather than sequence identity.  This method may help identify distantly related proteins and can be used to infer molecular functions.

== Examples of structural genomics ==
There are currently a number of on-going efforts to solve the structures for every protein in a given proteome.

===''Thermotogo maritima'' proteome===
One current goal of the [[Joint Center for Structural Genomics]] (JCSG), a part of the [[Protein Structure Initiative]] (PSI) is to solve the structures for all the proteins in ''[[Thermotoga|Thermotogo maritima]]'', a thermophillic bacterium. ''T. maritima'' was selected as a structural genomics target based on its relatively small genome consisting of 1,877 genes and the hypothesis that the proteins expressed by a thermophilic bacterium would be easier to crystallize.

Lesley ''et al'' used ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' to express all the open-reading frames (ORFs) of ''T. martima''. These proteins were then crystallized and structures were determined for successfully crystallized proteins using X-ray crystallography.  Among other structures, this structural genomics approach allowed for the determination of the structure of the TM0449 protein, which was found to exhibit a novel fold as it did not share structural homology with any known protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Lesley SA, Kuhn P, Godzik A, etal |title=Structural genomics of the Thermotoga maritima proteome implemented in a high-throughput structure determination pipeline |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=99 |issue=18 |pages=11664–9 |date=September 2002 |pmid=12193646 |pmc=129326 |doi=10.1073/pnas.142413399 |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12193646}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Mycobacterium tuberculosis'' proteome===
The goal of the [[Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Structural Genomics Consortium|TB Structural Genomics Consortium]] is to determine the structures of potential drug targets in ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'', the bacterium that causes tuberculosis. The development of novel drug therapies against tuberculosis are particularly important given the growing problem of [[multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis]].

The fully sequenced genome of ''M. tuberculosis'' has allowed scientists to clone many of these protein targets into expression vectors for purification and structure determination by X-ray crystallography.  Studies have identified a number of target proteins for structure determination, including extracellular proteins that may be involved in pathogenesis, iron-regulatory proteins, current drug targets, and proteins predicted to have novel folds. So far, structures have been determined for 708 of the proteins encoded by ''M. tuberculosis''.

The '''theta-criterion''' (also named '''θ-criterion''') is a constraint on [[x-bar theory]] that was first proposed by {{harvs|txt|first=Noam|last=Chomsky|author-link=Noam Chomsky|year=1981}} as a rule within the system of principles of the [[government and binding theory]], called theta-theory (θ-theory).  As theta-theory is concerned with the distribution and assignment of [[theta roles|theta-roles]] (a.k.a. thematic roles), the theta-criterion describes the specific match between [[Argument (linguistics)|arguments]] and theta-roles (θ-roles) in [[logical form]] (LF):
{|
|-
|
{{Quote box
 |quote  = '''θ-criterion:''' ''Each argument bears one and only one θ-role, and each θ-role is assigned to one and only one argument.''
 |source = {{harv|Chomsky|1981|p=35}}
 |align  = center
 |fontsize=14
}}

Being a constraint on x-bar theory, the criterion aims to parse out ill-formed sentences. Thus, if the number or categories of arguments in a sentence does not meet the theta-role assigner's requirement in any given sentence, that sentence will be deemed ungrammatical. {{harv|Carnie|2007|p=224}}. In other words, theta-criterion sorts sentences into grammatical and ungrammatical bins based on [[Selection (linguistics)|c-selection and s-selection]].

== Applied ==

=== Theta grid ===
A [[Theta role|theta-role]] is a status of [[thematic relation]] {{harv|Chomsky|1981|p=35}}. In other words, a theta-role describes the connection of meaning between a [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] or a [[verb]] and a [[Constituent (linguistics)|constituent]] selected by this predicate. The number, types and positions of theta-roles that a lexicon assigns is encoded in its lexical entry {{harv|Chomsky|1981|p=38}} and must be satisfied in syntactic structure following [[Projection Principle]].{{efn|Note that this doesn't mean that all theta-roles are obligatorily assigned. If a structural position that can be theta-marked is obligatory, then the theta-role assignment is also obligatory. Otherwise it is not {{harv|Chomsky|1981|p=40}}. See Transitivity section}} The [[Selection (linguistics)|selection]] of a constituent by a head based on meaning is called s-selection (semantic-selection) and those based on grammatical categories are called c-selection.{{efn|Such selection (theta-role assignment) is strictly local and only occurs between sister nodes. A lexical head assigns a theta-role to its complement, and the subject of this XP can receive a theta-role from the [[X']] including the head and its complement. The argument in subject position is called external argument, and the one in object position is called internal argument.{{harv|Williams|1981}} Adjuncts don't receive theta-roles so are not restricted by theta-criterion.}} {{harv|Sportiche|Koopman|Stabler|2014|p=141}} Such information can be expressed with a theta grid.

In the example below the verb 'love' has two theta-roles to assign: [[Thematic relation|agent]] (the entity who loves) and [[Thematic relation|theme]] (the entity being loved). In accordance with the theta-criterion, each theta-role must have its argument counterpart.
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center"
!Theta-roles
!&lt;AGENT&gt;
!
!&lt;THEME&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;       |&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;      |&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|-
|(1a)
|Megan
|loves
|Kevin
|-
| colspan="4" |{{harv|Carnie|2007|p=225 (22)}}
|}
In Example 1a, '''Megan''' and '''Kevin''' are the arguments that the verb assigns the agent and theme theta-roles to, respectively. Because there is a one-to-one mapping of argument to theta-role, the theta-criterion is satisfied and the sentence is deemed [[Grammaticality|grammatical]] {{harv|Carnie|2007|p=225}}. Below are two examples where the theta-criterion has not been fulfilled and are thus ungrammatical.
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center"
!Theta-roles
!&lt;AGENT&gt;
!
!&lt;THEME&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;       |&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;      |&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|-
|(1b)
|Megan
|loves
|
|-
| colspan="4" |{{harv|Carnie|2007|p=225 (24)}}
|}
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center"
!Theta-roles
!&lt;AGENT&gt;
!
!&lt;THEME&gt;
!
|-
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;        |&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;      |&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|&lt;nowiki&gt;    |&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|-
|(1c)
|Megan
|loves
|Jason
|Kevin
|-
| colspan="5" |{{harv|Carnie|2007|p=226 (26)}}
|}
Example 1b is ungrammatical (marked with '''*''') because there are more theta-roles available than there are arguments. The theta-role '''theme''' does not have an argument matched to it. On the other hand, in example (1c), there are more arguments than theta-roles. Both theta-roles are matched to arguments ('''Megan''' with '''Agent''' and '''Jason''' with '''theme'''), but there is an argument left without a corresponding theta-role (Kevin has no theta-role) {{harv|Carnie|2007}}. Thus for reasons of inequality in number between theta-roles and arguments, with either having more than the other, the result will be ungrammatical.

=== Consequence on movement ===
Since [[Trace (linguistics)|trace]] transmits theta-role, [[Syntactic movement|movements]] resulting in non-local relations between theta-role assigners and receivers in [[Transformational grammar|surface structure]] don't violate theta-criterion. This allows us to generate sentences with [[Raising (linguistics)|DP-raising]], head movement, [[wh-movement]], etc. However, if a phrase occupies a theta-position (complement or selected subject) in [[D-structure]], it can no longer move to another theta-position or it will receive two theta-roles {{harv|Chomsky|1981|p=46}}.

== Special cases ==

=== Transitivity ===

[[Verb]]s that can be either [[Transitive verb|transitive]] or [[Intransitive verb|intransitive]] at the first glance could present a problem for the theta-criterion. For a transitive verb, such as "hit," we assign the [[theta role|theta-role]]s agent and theme to the arguments, as shown in (2b), (2c), and (2d):
[[File:MaryArrived-D.jpg|thumb|(3c). The underlying representation of "Mary arrived." by a [[Concrete syntax tree|syntactic tree]].]]
[[File:MaryArrived-S.png|thumb|(3d). The surface representation of "Mary arrived." by a syntactic tree. "Mary" is projected to the spec-TP position by the [[Extended Projection Principle|extended projection principle]] triggered by the [+tense] tense morpheme.]]
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center"
!Theta-roles
!&lt;AGENT&gt;
!
!&lt;THEME&gt;
!
|-
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|
|-

|-
|(2d)
|John

|
|-
| colspan="5" |(adapted from {{harv|Rice|1988|p=207}})
|}
The action of hitting here requires an animate subject, an [[Thematic relation|agent]], carry out the action. The [[Thematic relation|theme]] is then someone or something that undergoes the action.
For an intransitive verb, such as "arrive," we assign the theta-role theme to the sole argument, since "Mary" is the one the undergoes the action:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center"
!Theta-roles
!&lt;THEME&gt;
!
!
|-
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|
|
|-
|(3a)
|Mary
|arrived.
|
|-
|(3b)
|*Mary
|arrived
|an arrival.
|-
| colspan="4" |adapted from {{harv|Pesetsky &amp; Torrego|2002|p=22 (36a)}}
|}

The theta-criterion assigns the theta-role in the [[underlying structure]], as shown by (3c). The past-tense morpheme then requires a subject at the spec-TP position and forces the [[Syntactic movement|movement]] of "Mary," as shown by (3d).
A verb like "eat" can choose to take an object, as shown in (4):
{|
|-
|
 (4) a. ''John ate.''
     b. ''John ate something.''
     c. ''John ate a big lunch.''
         {{harv|Rice|1988|p=203 (1b-d)}}
|}
For this type of verb, the potential object is usually semantically limited and therefore can be inferred from the verb at a default value {{harv|Rice|1988|pp=203–4}}. For instance, for (4a), the listener/reader automatically assumes that John ate "something." What necessitates the object in (4c) is the distinction from the default meaning achieved by specifying what John ate {{harv|Rice|1988|p=208}}. As a result, this type of verbs can be treated the same as transitive verbs. The theta-roles of "agent" and "theme" can be assigned:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center"
!Theta-roles
!&lt;AGENT&gt;
!
!(&lt;THEME&gt;)
|-
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;(|)&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|-
|(4a)
|John
|ate.
|
|-
|(4b)
|John
|ate
|something.
|-
|(4c)
|John
|ate
|a big lunch.
|-
| colspan="4" |{{harv|Rice|1988|p=203 (1b-d)}}
|}

In summary, by assigning the correct theta-roles, theta-criterion is able to tell the real intransitive verbs, such as "arrive" apart from verbs that can appear intransitive, such as "eat."

=== PRO and pro ===

==== PRO ====
[[PRO (linguistics)|PRO]] (pronounced 'big pro') is a null pronoun phrase that occurs in a position where it does not get case (or gets null case){{efn|There are exceptions. For example, Icelandic PRO is argued to bear normal cases {{harv|Sigurðsson|2008}}}} but takes the theta-role assigned by the [[Nonfinite verb|non-finite verb]] to its subject. PRO's meaning is determined by the precedent DP that [[Control (linguistics)|controls]] it {{harv|Carnie|2012|p=429}}. As theta criterion states that each argument is assigned a theta-role, and those theta-roles must consist of a syntactic category that the verb selects even when there is no overt subject. This is where PRO comes in to help satisfy theta-criterion by appearing as the null subject attaining the appropriate theta role {{harv|Camacho|2013}}.
Below is an example containing PRO in a sentence:

 (5) a. ''Jean&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is likely  [t&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; to leave]''.
     b. ''Jean is reluctant [PRO to leave]''.
        {{harv|Carnie|2012|p=430 (1)}}

Example (5a) is a [[Raising (linguistics)|raising]] sentence,and in contrast, (5b) is a [[Control (linguistics)|control]] sentence, meaning it does not involve any DP [[Syntactic movement|movement]]. The PRO, which is a "null DP" is in the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] position of the [[Dependent clause|embedded clause]].

 (6) a. ''Jean wants Brian&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; [t&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; to leave]''.
     b. ''Jean persuaded Brian [PRO to leave]''.
       {{harv|Carnie|2012|p=430 (4}}

Similarly, example (6a) is a raising-to-object sentence; "Brian" raises to the object position of the verb ''want.''{{efn|This movement won't cause ''Brian'' to get a theta-role from the verb ''want'' because 1) ''want'' only assigns a proposition role to its complement, and that role is already assigned to the clause ''Brain to leave''. 2) ''Brian'' in such cases moved to the specifier position of AgrOP rather than directly into the complement position of ''want''. {{harvtxt|Carnie|2007|page=411}}}} In contrast, (6b) is an object control sentence.{{harv|Carnie|2012|p=430}} The verb ''persuade'' has three theta-roles to assign: "agent" to ''Jean'', "theme" to ''Brian'', and "proposition" to the clause [''PRO to leave'']. There is no raising, but there is a PRO in the subject position of the embedded clause that takes the verb leave's only theta-role, "agent". Since Brian does not receive theta-role from ''leave'', it only bears one theta-role, nor does PRO receive a second theta-role from ''persuade''. Every argument only receives one theta-role, and every theta-role of the two predicates is assigned to only one argument. The sentence is thus grammatical.

==== pro ====
[[Empty category#pro (little pro)|pro]], also known as little pro, is an [[empty category]] that occurs in a subject or object position of a [[finite clause]] (finite clauses must contain a verb which shows tense) in languages like Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, and some Arabic dialects ({{harvnb|Jaeggli|Safir|1989}}; {{harvnb|Rizzi|1986}}). pro differs from PRO in that it contains [[Case (linguistics)|case]]. The meaning of pro is determined not by its [[Antecedent (grammar)|antecedent]] but by verb [[Agreement (grammar)|agreement]] in the sentence. The DP is 'dropped' from a sentence if its reference can be recovered from the context.{{harv|Carnie|2012|p=429}} For example:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center"
!Theta-roles
!&lt;AGENT&gt;
!
!&lt;THEME&gt;
!&lt;GOAL&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|-
|(7a)
|Un bravo psicanalista
(A good psychoanalyst)
|può restituire
(can give back)
|'''pro'''
|a se stessi
(to themselves)
|-
| colspan="5" |'A good psychoanalyst can return people to themselves'.
|-
| colspan="5" |(Adapted from {{harvtxt|Rizzi|1986|page=504 (11b)}})
|}
The verb ''restituire'' 'give back' assigns three theta-roles, but there are only two overt arguments in the sentence. It ultimately satisfies theta-criterion because the role, theme, is taken by a pro, whose existence can be proved by the properly [[Binding (linguistics)|bound]] reflexive pronoun ''se stessi''. Compare (7a) with (7b) below:
 (7b) *''Un bravo psicanalista può dare aiuto a  se stessi''.
       A  good  psychoanalyst can give help  to oneself.
       'A good psychoanalyst can give help to themselves'.
      (Adapted from {{harvtxt|Rizzi|1986|page=504 (13b)}})
When the reflexive pronoun ''se stessi'' 'themselves' doesn't have a proper [[Antecedent (grammar)|antecedent]] to co-refer to, the sentence can't be grammatical. This indicates that in (7a) ''se stessi'' must have a proper antecedent in the sentence—the pro that takes the theme role.

=== Cognate object ===
[[Cognate object]]s are nominal complements of their cognate verbs that are normally [[Intransitive verb|intransitive]]. For example,
 (8) ''John died a gruesome death.''
      {{harv|Jones|1988|p=89 (1a)}}
Such a structure posed a problem for theta-criterion because normally the verb assigns only one theta-role, theme, which is already taken by the [[Determiner phrase|DP]], "John." The sentence should be thus predicted ill-formed. To explain the phenomenon, one way is to re-categorize such a verb as "die" so as to change the way it assigns theta-roles. For that purpose, (8) can be interpreted as follows:
 (9) ''John met a gruesome death.''
      {{harv|Jones|1988|p=91 (5a)}}
Or John ''underwent'' a gruesome death. If the verb "die" is essentially similar to the operation-verb "meet," the cognate objects should be assigned a theta-role—one restricted to the nominal form of the verb head {{harv|Jones|1988}}. In other words, "die" is now classified as a potentially transitive verb, assigning two theta-roles, agent to "John" and theme to "a gruesome death." Such a possibility is falsified, however, because cognate object constructions cannot be passivized {{harv|Jones|1988}}.
[[File:JohnDiedAGruesomeDeath.jpg|thumb|(11c) Tree structure of (11a) "John died a gruesome death." The adjunct phrase is highlighted in yellow. Substituting the adjunct DP "a gruesome death" with the [[adverbial phrase]] "gruesomely" will derive (11b).]]
 (10) a. ''A gruesome death was met by John.''
      b. ''*A gruesome death was died by John.''
      {{harv|Jones|1988|p=91 (6a), p=92 (11a)}}
As we can no longer consider verbs that take cognate objects the same as potentially transitive verbs, {{harvtxt|Jones|1988}} argues, based on the framework of {{harvtxt|Zubizarreta|1982}}, that cognate objects are [[Adjunct (grammar)|adjuncts]] rather than [[Argument (grammar)|arguments]], having the same meaning and structure as the manner [[adverb]]s in (12b).
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center"
!Theta-role
!&lt;THEME&gt;
!
!
|-
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|
|
|-
|(11a)
|John
|died
|a gruesome death.
|-
|(11b)
|John
|died
|gruesomely.
|-
| colspan="4" |{{harvtxt|Jones|1988|p=89 (1a), p. 93 (12a)}}
|}

Such an analysis restores cognate objects to the group of arguments satisfying the theta-criterion, as adjuncts, by definition, are not counted as arguments and therefore need not be restricted by theta criterion. The tree form (11c) shows the adjunct DP in its relative position.

=== Deverbal nouns ===

[[Deverbal noun]]s are derived from verbs and thus assign theta-roles as their verb stems do. For example,

 (12) (i) ''the barbarians' destruction of Rome''
     (ii) ''Rome's destruction (by the barbarians)''
    (iii) ''the destruction of Rome (by the barbarians)''
     (iv) ''*the barbarian's destruction''
    ({{harv|Chomsky|1981|p=104 (7)}})

According to {{harvtxt|Chomsky|1981|p=104}}, the constructions in (10) are analogous to "the barbarians destroyed Rome" and ''destruction'' needs to assign theta-roles in line with theta-criterion. It assigns "agent" to ''the barbarians'' and "theme" to ''Rome'' so (i) is fine. The verb "destroy" alone doesn't obligatorily assign theta-role to its subject so (ii) and (iii) is well-formed, too. However, "destroy" must assign a "theme", so (iv) is ruled out.

== Alternative approaches ==
Theta-criterion experienced its golden age in the 1980s when people discussed its application to various languages and structures and developed many other theories from it. However, after the [[minimalist program]] challenged some cornerstones of government and binding theory, people started to question the validity of this criterion, especially the number of theta-roles allowed to be taken by an argument. Hornstein and Boeckx, for example, proposed that there is no upper limit on the number of theta-roles an argument can receive during derivation. In their theory, the function of selecting correct number of arguments is shouldered by [[case theory]], and theta-roles are just features on verbs that needs to be checked {{harv|Hornstein|1999}}.

The '''USC Jane Goodall Research Center''' is a part of the department of [[Anthropology]] at the [[University of Southern California]]. It is co-directed by professors of anthropology [[Craig Stanford]], Chris Boehm, Nayuta Yamashita, and Roberto Delgado.

The center was established in 1991 with the joint appointment of [[Jane Goodall]] as Distinguished Emeritus Professor in Anthropology and Occupational Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cool.org/anthropology/goodallcenter.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100121005721/http://cool.org/anthropology/goodallcenter.html |archivedate=2010-01-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://college.usc.edu/labs/janegoodall/home/index.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091129165105/http://college.usc.edu/labs/janegoodall/home/index.cfm |archivedate=2009-11-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Center offers USC students the chance to study in Gombe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.africanconservation.org/content/view/998/406/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123055133/http://www.africanconservation.org/content/view/998/406/ |archivedate=2008-11-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Information School''' or '''iSchool''' of the [[University of Sheffield]], in [[Sheffield]], [[South Yorkshire]], [[England]], was founded in 1963 as the University's '''Postgraduate School of Librarianship''' and became in 2010 the first UK [[iSchool]]. Other names were the '''Postgraduate School of Librarianship and Information Science''' ('''PGSLIS''', 1967-81) and '''Department of Information Studies''' (1981-2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=iSchool Timeline|url=http://www.shef.ac.uk/is/about/history.html|work=University of Sheffield: Information School|accessdate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2015}}, it employs 28 academic staff, 12 administrative/support staff, 7 affiliated research staff, and has about 50 research students. The current head of school is Professor Peter Bath.

The department opened in 1964 as a library school, becoming only the second university-based department in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/016555158901500402 |last=Saunders |first=W. |year=1989|title=The University of Sheffield Department of Information Studies|journal=Journal of Information Science|volume=15 |issue=4-5| pages = 193–202}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, like many [[information science]] departments it has grown to encompass teaching and research in [[cheminformatics]], educational informatics, [[health informatics]], [[information retrieval]], [[information systems]], knowledge and information management, as well as libraries and information society. Such is the status of the school, that it has twice been honoured with a special issue of the ''[[Journal of Information Science]]'' devoted entirely to the department, its staff and its research outputs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=1989 | journal=Journal of Information Science|volume=15 |issue=4-5|url=http://jis.sagepub.com/content/vol15/issue4-5/|title=The University of Sheffield Department of Information Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=2003|title=Special Issue, 40 years of the Department of Information Studies, University of Sheffield|journal=Journal of Information Science|volume=29 |issue=4|url=http://jis.sagepub.com/content/vol29/issue4/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research achievements==
The school has ranked highest or joint highest in its subject rating in every [[Research Assessment Exercise]] since the running of the first exercise in 1986. In this UK-government sponsored assessment of research outputs, no other department in its subject field (or its [[University of Sheffield|University]]) achieved this consistency; few departments of any subject area in UK universities managed such a high level of continuous research output (see the following links to the 1992,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rae.ac.uk/1992/c26_92t64.html |title=UFC 26/92 - RAE92: The Outcome Table 64 |publisher=Rae.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1996,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rae.ac.uk/1996/1_96/t61.html |title=1996 RAE - Unit of Assessment: 61 |publisher=Rae.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rae.ac.uk/2001/results/byuoa/uoa61.htm |title=Results : 2001 Research Assessment Exercise : Unit of Assessment : 61 Library and Information Management |publisher=Rae.ac.uk |accessdate=2015-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; RAE results). In 2008, rankings of departments was left to news organizations; the [[Times Higher Education]] placed Sheffield at No. 1 again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/Journals/THE/THE/18_December_2008/attachments/RAE_2008_THE_RESULTS.pdf |format=PDF |title=Times Higher Education Table of Excellence |publisher=Timeshighereducation.co.uk |accessdate=2015-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, an analysis of citations showed four of the ten most cited UK information studies academics were working in the Sheffield department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/asi.20771 |url=http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/4579/ |last=Sanderson |first=M. | year=2008 | title=Revisiting h measured on UK LIS and IR academics| journal=Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology (JASIST) |volume=59 |issue=7| pages=1184–1190}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the first UK-based (and 2nd European) department to be become an [[i-school|iSchool]].

The original paper has been cited over 2000 times.

== Background ==
The three dimensional structure of biological macromolecules like [[protein]]s and [[nucleic acid]]s play critical role in determining their functional role.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Introduction to Protein Structure|url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0307441292901326|journal = Biochemical Education|volume = 20|issue = 2|doi = 10.1016/0307-4412(92)90132-6|first = F.|last = Vella|pages=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process of decoding function from the sequence is an experimentally and computationally challenging question addressed widely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Prediction of protein function from protein sequence and structure|url = http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0033583503003901|journal = Quarterly Reviews of Biophysics|date = 2003-08-01|issn = 1469-8994|pages = 307–340|volume = 36|issue = 03|doi = 10.1017/S0033583503003901|first = James C.|last = Whisstock|first2 = Arthur M.|last2 = Lesk|pmid=15029827}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Predicting protein function from sequence and structure|url = http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nrm2281|journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology|pages = 995–1005|volume = 8|issue = 12|doi = 10.1038/nrm2281|first = David|last = Lee|first2 = Oliver|last2 = Redfern|first3 = Christine|last3 = Orengo}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[RNA]] structures form complex secondary and [[RNA Structure|tertiary structures]] compared to [[DNA]] which form [[Nucleic acid double helix|duplexes]] with full [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementarity]] between two strands. This is partially because the extra oxygen in RNA increases the propensity for hydrogen bonding in the nucleic acid backbone. The [[base pairing]] and [[base stacking]] interactions of RNA play critical role in formation of [[ribosome]], [[spliceosome]], or [[tRNA]].

[[Nucleic_acid_structure|Secondary structure]] prediction is commonly done using approaches like dynamic programming, energy minimisation (for most stable structure) and generating suboptimal structures. A large number of [[List_of_RNA_structure_prediction_software|structure prediction tools]] have been implemented as well.

== Development ==
The first version of the ViennaRNA Package was published by Hofacker et al. in 1994.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The package distributed tools to compute either minimum free energy structures or partition functions of RNA molecules; both using the idea of [[dynamic programming]]. Non-thermodynamic criterion like formation of maximum matching or various versions of kinetic folding along with an inverse folding heuristic to determine structurally neutral sequences were implemented. Additionally, the package also contained a statistics suite with routines for [[cluster analysis]], statistical geometry, and split decomposition.

The package was made available as library and a set of standalone routines.

=== Version 2.0 ===
A number of major systemic changes were introduced in this version with the use of a new parametrized energy model (''Turner 2004''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Incorporating chemical modification constraints into a dynamic programming algorithm for prediction of RNA secondary structure|url = http://www.pnas.org/content/101/19/7287|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date = 2004-05-11|issn = 0027-8424|pmc = 409911|pmid = 15123812|pages = 7287–7292|volume = 101|issue = 19|doi = 10.1073/pnas.0401799101|first = David H.|last = Mathews|first2 = Matthew D.|last2 = Disney|first3 = Jessica L.|last3 = Childs|first4 = Susan J.|last4 = Schroeder|first5 = Michael|last5 = Zuker|first6 = Douglas H.|last6 = Turner}}&lt;/ref&gt; restructuring of the RNAlib to support concurrent computations in thread-safe manner, improvements to the [[Application programming interface|API]], and inclusion of several new auxiliary tools. For example, tools to assess RNA-RNA interactions and restricted ensembles of structures. Furthermore, other features included additional output information such as centroid structures and maximum expected accuracy structures derived from base pairing probabilities, or ''z-scores'' for locally stable secondary structures, and support for input in [[FASTA]] format. The updates, however, are compatible with earlier versions without affecting the computational efficiency of the core algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = ViennaRNA Package 2.0|url = http://www.almob.org/content/6/1/26|journal = Algorithms for Molecular Biology|date = 2011-11-24|pmc = 3319429|pmid = 22115189|volume = 6|issue = 1|doi = 10.1186/1748-7188-6-26|first = Ronny|last = Lorenz|first2 = Stephan H|last2 = Bernhart|first3 = Christian Höner zu|last3 = Siederdissen|first4 = Hakim|last4 = Tafer|first5 = Christoph|last5 = Flamm|first6 = Peter F|last6 = Stadler|first7 = Ivo L|last7 = Hofacker|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Web server ===
The tools provided by the ViennaRNA Package are also available for public use through a web interface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Vienna RNA Websuite|url = http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/36/suppl_2/W70|journal = Nucleic Acids Research|date = 2008-07-01|issn = 0305-1048|pmc = 2447809|pmid = 18424795|pages = W70-W74|volume = 36|issue = suppl 2|doi = 10.1093/nar/gkn188|first = Andreas R.|last = Gruber|first2 = Ronny|last2 = Lorenz|first3 = Stephan H.|last3 = Bernhart|first4 = Richard|last4 = Neuböck|first5 = Ivo L.|last5 = Hofacker}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Vienna RNA secondary structure server|url = http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/31/13/3429|journal = Nucleic Acids Research|date = 2003-07-01|issn = 0305-1048|pmid = 12824340|pages = 3429–3431|volume = 31|issue = 13|doi = 10.1093/nar/gkg599|first = Ivo L.|last = Hofacker|pmc=169005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''World Book Day'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.worldbookday.com/about/| title = What is World Book Day?|publisher =Worldbookday.com| accessdate = 16 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''World Book and Copyright Day''' (also known as '''International Day of the Book''' or '''World Book Days''') is a yearly event on April 23rd, organized by the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO), to promote [[reading (activity)|reading]], [[publishing]] and [[copyright]]. In the [[United Kingdom]], the day is recognized on the first Thursday in March. World Book Day was celebrated for the first time on 23 April 1995.

==Date selection==
The original idea was of the Valencian writer Vicente Clavel Andrés as a way to honour the author [[Miguel de Cervantes]], first on 7 October, his birth date, then on 23 April, his death date. In 1995 UNESCO decided that the World Book and Copyright Day would be celebrated on 23 April, as the date is also the anniversary of the death of [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Inca Garcilaso de la Vega]], as well as that of the birth or death of several other prominent authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/events/bookday/ |title=World Book and Copyright Day, 23 April |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; (In a historical coincidence, Shakespeare and Cervantes died on the same ''date'' — 23 April 1616 — but not on the same ''day'', as at the time, Spain used the [[Gregorian calendar]] and England used the [[Julian calendar]]; Shakespeare actually died 10 days after Cervantes died, on 3 May of the Gregorian calendar.)
