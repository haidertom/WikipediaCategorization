'''Anna Hornby''', N.E.A.C (1914–1996) was an English painter, [[calligrapher]] and member of the [[New English Art Club]].&lt;ref name="Who 1986"&gt;Who's Who in Art (Twenty-Second Edition, Art Trade Press 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==

Anna Hornby was born on 6 April 1914 and educated at the independent [[Westonbirt School]], Gloucestershire.&lt;ref name="Who 1986"/&gt; She went on to study art in [[Florence]] with landscape and flower painter Aubrey Waterfield in 1934, and later that year enrolled at the [[Byam Shaw School of Art]] in London where she studied under [[Francis Ernest Jackson]], graduating in 1940.&lt;ref name="Who 1986"/&gt;

Apart from painting, Calligraphy was Anna's other great passion - in 1952 she was appointed Honorary Secretary of the Society for Italic Handwriting, a post she held until 1962. Through her interest in calligraphy and her association with the Society, she became acquainted with [[Alfred John Fairbank]], whose portrait Anna painted (exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1961).&lt;ref name="archiveshub.ac.uk"&gt;{{Cite web

Anna was also a member of the Art Works’ Guild and was elected member of the [[New English Art Club]] in 1971. She exhibited widely with no fewer than 13 pictures at the Royal Academy, additionally she exhibited at the Royal Society of Painters in Watercolours, The Royal Society of Portrait Painters and the Royal Society of British Artists.&lt;ref&gt;Royal Academy Exhibitors 1905-1970, Vol I (EP Publishing LTD, 1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

Anna Hornby died in 1996, bequeathing paintings by Peter Greenham and Francis Ernest Jackson to the [[Ashmolean]] Museum of Art, Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Harrison, Catherine Casley, Jon Whiteley

==Background==
The concept of the oceanic anoxic event (OAE) was first proposed in 1976 by Seymour Schlanger (1927–1990) and geologist Hugh Jenkyns&lt;ref name="HistOfOil-2"&gt;History Channel, "The History of Oil" (2007), Australian Broadcasting System, Inc.&lt;!--may be out of context --&gt;, aired: 2:00-4:00 pm EDST, 2008-07-08; Note: [[Geologist]] Hugh Jenkyns was interviewed in the History Channel's (re: footnote:3 History Channel, "The History of Oil" (2007)) documentary "The History of Oil" and attributed the matching occurrence high in the [[Apennine Mountains]]' meter thick black shale band put together with the findings from the [[Deep Sea Drilling Project]] as triggering the theory and work that followed from a beginning ca 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; and arose from discoveries made by the [[Deep Sea Drilling Project]] (DSDP) in the Pacific Ocean. It was the finding of black carbon-rich shales in Cretaceous sediments that had accumulated on submarine [[volcanic plateau]]s ([[Shatsky Rise]], [[Manihiki Plateau]]), coupled with the fact that they were identical in age with similar deposits cored from the Atlantic Ocean and known from outcrops in Europe - particularly in the geological record of the otherwise limestone-dominated [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]]&lt;ref name="HistOfOil-2"/&gt; chain in Italy - that led to the realization that these widespread similar [[stratigraphy|strata]] recorded highly unusual oxygen-depleted conditions in the world ocean during several discrete periods of [[geological time scale|geological time]].

Sedimentological investigations of these organic-rich sediments, which have continued to this day, typically reveal the presence of fine laminations undisturbed by bottom-dwelling fauna, indicating anoxic conditions on the sea floor, believed to be coincident with a low lying poisonous layer of hydrogen sulfide.&lt;ref name="HistOfOil"/&gt; Furthermore, detailed organic [[geochemical]] studies have recently revealed the presence of molecules (so-called biomarkers) that derive from both [[purple sulfur bacteria]]&lt;ref name="HistOfOil"/&gt; and [[green sulfur bacteria]]: organisms that required both light and free [[hydrogen sulfide|hydrogen sulfide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S)]], illustrating that anoxic conditions extended high into the illuminated upper water column.

There are currently several places on earth that are exhibiting the features of anoxic events on a localized scale such as algal/bacterial blooms and localized "dead zones". [[Dead zone (ecology)|Dead zones]] exist off the East Coast of the United States in the [[Chesapeake Bay]], in the Scandinavian strait [[Kattegat]], the [[Black Sea]] (which may have been anoxic in its deepest levels for millennia, however), in the northern Adriatic as well as a dead zone off the coast of Louisiana. The current{{When|date=May 2016}} surge of [[jellyfish]] worldwide is sometimes regarded as the first stirrings of an anoxic event{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}. Other marine dead zones have appeared in coastal waters of South America, China, Japan, and [[New Zealand]]. A 2008 study counted 405 dead zones worldwide.[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/08/080814154325.htm]

This is a recent understanding. This picture was only pieced together during the last three decades{{When|date=May 2016}}. The handful of known and suspected anoxic events have been tied geologically to large-scale production of the world's oil reserves in worldwide bands of black [[shale]] in the [[geologic record]]. Likewise the high relative temperatures believed linked to so called "[[super-greenhouse event]]s".&lt;ref

===Euxinia===
{{See also|Phosphorus cycle}}
Oceanic '''anoxic events''' with [[Euxinia|euxinic]] (i.e. sulfidic) conditions have been linked to extreme episodes of volcanic outgassing. Thus, volcanism contributed to the buildup of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the atmosphere, increased global temperatures, causing an accelerated hydrological cycle that introduced nutrients to the oceans to stimulate planktonic productivity. These processes potentially acted as a trigger for euxinia in restricted basins where water-column stratification could develop. Under anoxic to euxinic conditions, oceanic phosphate is not retained in sediment and could hence be released and recycled, aiding continued high productivity.&lt;ref name="Kump 2008" /&gt;

Temperatures throughout the Jurassic and Cretaceous are generally thought to have been relatively warm, and consequently dissolved oxygen levels in the ocean were lower than today - making anoxia easier to achieve. However, more specific conditions are required to explain the short-period (less than a million years) oceanic anoxic events. Two hypotheses, and variations upon them, have proved most durable.

One hypothesis suggests that the anomalous accumulation of organic matter relates to its enhanced preservation under restricted and poorly oxygenated conditions, which themselves were a function of the particular geometry of the ocean basin: such a hypothesis, although readily applicable to the young and relatively narrow Cretaceous Atlantic (which could be likened to a large-scale Black Sea, only poorly connected to the World Ocean), fails to explain the occurrence of coeval black shales on open-ocean Pacific plateaus and shelf seas around the world.  There are suggestions, again from the Atlantic, that a shift in oceanic circulation was responsible, where warm, salty waters at low latitudes became hypersaline and sank to form an intermediate layer, at {{convert|500|to|1000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} depth, with a temperature of {{convert|20|C|F|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|25|C|F|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="ngeo217"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second hypothesis suggests that oceanic anoxic events record a major change in the fertility of the oceans that resulted in an increase in organic-walled plankton (including bacteria) at the expense of calcareous plankton such as [[coccoliths]] and [[foraminifera]].
Such an accelerated flux of organic matter would have expanded and intensified the [[oxygen minimum zone]], further enhancing the amount of organic carbon entering the sedimentary record. Essentially this mechanism assumes a major increase in the availability of dissolved nutrients such as nitrate, phosphate and possibly iron to the phytoplankton population living in the illuminated layers of the oceans.

For such an increase to occur would have required an accelerated influx of land-derived nutrients coupled with vigorous [[upwelling]], requiring major climate change on a global scale. Geochemical data from oxygen-[[isotope]] ratios in carbonate sediments and fossils, and magnesium/calcium ratios in fossils, indicate that all major oceanic anoxic events were associated with thermal maxima, making it likely that global weathering rates, and nutrient flux to the oceans, were increased during these intervals.  Indeed, the reduced solubility of oxygen would lead to phosphate release, further nourishing the ocean and fuelling high productivity, hence a high oxygen demand - sustaining the event through a positive feedback.&lt;ref name="10.1146.2Fannurev.earth.36.031207.124256"/&gt;

Here is another way of looking at oceanic anoxic events.  Assume that the earth releases a huge volume of carbon dioxide during an interval of intense volcanism; global temperatures rise due to the [[greenhouse effect]]; global weathering rates and fluvial nutrient flux increase; organic productivity in the oceans increases; organic-[[Carbon sequestration|carbon burial]] in the oceans increases (OAE begins); carbon dioxide is drawn down due to both burial of organic matter and weathering of silicate rocks (inverse greenhouse effect); global temperatures fall, and the ocean–atmosphere system returns to equilibrium (OAE ends).

In this way, an oceanic anoxic event can be viewed as the Earth’s response to the injection of excess carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and [[hydrosphere]].  One test of this notion is to look at the age of [[large igneous province]]s (LIPs), the extrusion of which would presumably have been accompanied by rapid effusion of vast quantities of volcanogenic gases such as carbon dioxide.  Intriguingly, the age of three LIPs ([[Karoo-Ferrar]] flood basalt, [[Caribbean large igneous province]], [[Ontong Java Plateau]]) correlates uncannily well with that of the major [[Jurassic]] (early [[Toarcian]]) and Cretaceous (early [[Aptian extinction|Aptian]] and [[Cenomanian-Turonian boundary event|Cenomanian–Turonian]]) oceanic anoxic events, indicating that a causal link is feasible.

==Occurrence==
Oceanic anoxic events most commonly occurred during periods of very warm [[climate]] characterized by high levels of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and mean surface temperatures probably in excess of {{Convert|25|°C}}. The [[Quaternary]] levels, the current [[period (geology)|period]], are just {{Convert|13|°C}} in comparison. Such rises in carbon dioxide may have been in response to a great outgassing of the highly flammable [[natural gas]] (methane) that some call an "oceanic burp".&lt;ref name="HistOfOil"/&gt;&lt;ref

|quote=With extreme weather continuing to bite -- hurricanes may increase in power by half a category above today’s top-level Category Five -- world food supplies will be critically endangered. :And: The Eocene greenhouse event fascinates scientists not just because of its effects, which also saw a major mass-extinction in the seas, but also because of its likely cause: [[methane hydrate]]s. This unlikely substance, a sort of ice-like combination of methane and water that is only stable at low temperatures and high pressure, may have burst into the atmosphere from the seabed in an immense '''“ocean burp”''', sparking a surge in global temperatures (methane is even more powerful as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide). Today vast amounts of these same methane hydrates still sit on sub-sea continental shelves. As the oceans warm, they could be released once more in a terrifying echo of that methane belch of 55 million years ago.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vast quantities of [[methane]] are normally locked into the Earth's crust on the continental plateaus in one of the many deposits consisting of compounds of [[methane hydrate]], a solid precipitated combination of methane and water much like ice. Because the methane hydrates are unstable, except at cool temperatures and high (deep) pressures, scientists have observed smaller "burps" due to [[tectonic]] events.  Studies suggest the huge release of natural gas&lt;ref name="HistOfOil"/&gt; could be a major climatological trigger, methane itself being a [[greenhouse gas]] many times more powerful than carbon dioxide.  However, anoxia was also rife during the [[Hirnantian]] (late Ordovician) ice age.

The [[Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum]] (PETM), which was characterized by a global rise in temperature and deposition of organic-rich shales in some shelf seas, shows many similarities to oceanic anoxic events.

Typically, oceanic anoxic events lasted for less than a million years, before a full recovery.

==Consequences==
Oceanic anoxic events have had many important consequences. It is believed that they have been responsible for mass [[extinction events|extinctions]] of marine organisms both in the [[Paleozoic]] and [[Mesozoic]].&lt;ref name="10.1146.2Fannurev.earth.36.031207.124256"&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = K. M.| first2 = L.

  |bibcode = 2008AREPS..36..251M }}&lt;/ref&gt; The early Toarcian and [[Cenomanian-Turonian anoxic event]]s correlate with the [[Toarcian turnover|Toarcian]] and [[Cenomanian-Turonian extinction event]]s of mostly marine life forms. Apart from possible atmospheric effects, many deeper-dwelling marine organisms could not adapt to an ocean where oxygen penetrated only the surface layers.

An economically significant consequence of oceanic anoxic events is the fact that the prevailing conditions in so many Mesozoic oceans has helped produce most of the world's [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]] reserves. During an oceanic anoxic event, the accumulation and preservation of organic matter was much greater than normal, allowing the generation of potential petroleum [[source rock]]s in many environments across the globe. Consequently, some 70 percent of oil source rocks are Mesozoic in age, and another 15 percent date from the warm Paleogene: only rarely in colder periods were conditions favorable for the production of source rocks on anything other than a local scale.

===Atmospheric effects===
A model put forward by Lee Kump, Alexander Pavlov and Michael Arthur in 2005 suggests that oceanic anoxic events may have been characterized by upwelling of water rich in highly toxic hydrogen sulfide gas, which was then released into the atmosphere. This phenomenon would probably have poisoned plants and animals and caused mass extinctions. Furthermore, it has been proposed that the hydrogen sulfide rose to the upper atmosphere and attacked the [[ozone layer]], which normally blocks the deadly [[ultraviolet radiation]] of the [[Sun]]. The increased UV radiation caused by this [[ozone depletion]] would have amplified the destruction of plant and animal life. Fossil spores from strata recording the [[Permian-Triassic extinction event]] show deformities consistent with UV radiation. This evidence, combined with fossil [[Bioindicator|biomarker]]s of [[green sulfur bacteria]], indicates that this process could have played a role in that [[mass extinction]] event, and possibly other extinction events. The trigger for these mass extinctions appears to be a warming of the ocean caused by a rise of carbon dioxide levels to about 1000 parts per million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ocean chemistry effects===
Reduced oxygen levels are expected to lead to increased seawater concentrations of redox-sensitive metals. The reductive dissolution of [[iron]]–[[manganese]] oxyhydroxides in seafloor sediments under low-oxygen conditions would release those metals and associated trace metals. Sulfate reduction in such sediments could release other metals such as [[barium]]. When heavy-metal-rich anoxic deep water entered continental shelves and encountered increased O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels, precipitation of some of the metals, as well as poisoning of the local biota, would have occurred. In the late Silurian mid-[[Silurian#Pridoli|Pridoli]] event, increases are seen in the Fe, Cu, As, Al, Pb, Ba, Mo and Mn levels in shallow-water sediment and microplankton; this is associated with a marked increase in the malformation rate in [[chitinozoan]]s and other microplankton types, likely due to metal toxicity.&lt;ref name="Vandenbroucke2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vandenbroucke|first1=T.

==Anoxic events in Earth's history==

===Cretaceous===
{{Main|Cretaceous}}
{{See also|Cenomanian-Turonian boundary event}}
Sulfidic (or euxinic) conditions, which exist today in many [[water bodies]] from [[pond]]s to various land-surrounded [[mediterranean sea]]s&lt;ref
 name="dicdef-1"&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/mediterranean definition of mediterranean sea]; "6. surrounded or nearly surrounded by land."&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[Black Sea]], were particularly prevalent in the [[Cretaceous]] Atlantic but also characterized other parts of the world ocean. In an ice-free sea of these supposed super-greenhouse worlds, oceanic waters were as much as 200 meters higher, in some eras. During the time spans in question, the [[continental plate]]s are believed to have been well separated, and the [[mountain]]s we know today were (mostly) future [[tectonic]] events—meaning the overall landscapes were generally much lower— and even the half super-greenhouse climates would have been eras of highly expedited water erosion&lt;ref name="HistOfOil"/&gt;  carrying massive amounts of nutrients into the world oceans fueling an overall explosive population of microorganisms and their predator species in the oxygenated upper layers.

Detailed stratigraphic studies of Cretaceous black shales from many parts of the world have indicated that two oceanic anoxic events (OAEs) were particularly significant in terms of their impact on the chemistry of the oceans, one in the early [[Aptian]] (~120 Ma), sometimes called the [[Selli Event]] (or OAE 1a) &lt;ref name="oaedef"&gt;{{cite journal

* Insofar as the Cretaceous OAEs can be represented by type localities, it is the striking outcrops of laminated black shales within the vari-colored claystones and pink and white limestones near the town of Gubbio in the Italian [[Apennines]] that are the best candidates.
* The 1-meter thick black shale at the Cenomanian–Turonian boundary that crops out near Gubbio is termed the ‘Livello Bonarelli’ after the man who first described it in 1891.

More minor oceanic anoxic events have been proposed for other intervals in the Cretaceous (in the [[Valanginian]], [[Hauterivian]], [[Albian]] and [[Coniacian]]–[[Santonian]] stages), but their sedimentary record, as represented by organic-rich black shales, appears more parochial, being dominantly represented in the Atlantic and neighboring areas, and some researchers relate them to particular local conditions rather than being forced by global change.

===Jurassic===
{{Main|Jurassic}}
The only oceanic anoxic event documented from the Jurassic took place during the early [[Toarcian]] (~183 Ma).&lt;ref name="Gronstal 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohen 2008"/&gt; Because no DSDP ([[Deep Sea Drilling Project]]) or ODP ([[Ocean Drilling Program]]) cores have recovered black shales of this age – there being little or no Toarcian ocean crust remaining in the world ocean – the samples of black shale primarily come from outcrops on land.  These outcrops, together with material from some commercial oil wells, are found on all major continents and this event seems similar in kind to the two major Cretaceous examples.

===Paleozoic===
{{Main|Paleozoic}}
The boundary between the Ordovician and Silurian periods is marked by repetitive periods of anoxia, interspersed with normal, oxic conditions. In addition, anoxic periods are found during the Silurian.  These anoxic periods occurred at a time of low global temperatures (although {{co2}} levels were high), in the midst of a glaciation.&lt;ref name=Page2007&gt;{{palAss2007|author=Page, A. |author2=Zalasiewicz, J. |author3=Williams, M |last-author-amp=yes |title=Deglacial anoxia in a long-lived Early Palaeozoic Icehouse. |pages=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeppsson (1990) proposes a mechanism whereby the temperature of polar waters determines the site of formation of downwelling water.&lt;ref name=Jeppsson1990&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the high latitude waters are below {{convert|5|C|F|0|abbr=on}}, they will be dense enough to sink; as they are cool, oxygen is highly soluble in their waters, and the deep ocean will be oxygenated.  If high latitude waters are warmer than {{convert|5|C|F|0|abbr=on}}, their density is too low for them to sink below the cooler deep waters.  Therefore, thermohaline circulation can only be driven by salt-increased density, which tends to form in warm waters where evaporation is high.  This warm water can dissolve less oxygen, and is produced in smaller quantities, producing a sluggish circulation with little deep water oxygen.&lt;ref name=Jeppsson1990/&gt;  The effect of this warm water propagates through the ocean, and reduces the amount of {{co2}} that the oceans can hold in solution, which makes the oceans release large quantities of {{co2}} into the atmosphere in a geologically short time (tens or thousands of years).&lt;ref name=Jeppsson1997/&gt;  The warm waters also initiate the [[Clathrate gun hypothesis|release of clathrates]], which further increases atmospheric temperature and basin anoxia.&lt;ref name=Jeppsson1997/&gt;  Similar positive feedbacks operate during cold-pole episodes, amplifying their cooling effects.

The periods with cold poles are termed "P-episodes" (short for ''primo''&lt;ref name=Jeppsson1997&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and are characterised by [[Bioturbation|bioturbated]] deep oceans, a humid equator and higher weathering rates, and terminated by extinction events - for example, the [[Ireviken event|Ireviken]] and [[Lau event]]s.  The inverse is true for the warmer, oxic "S-episodes" (''secundo''), where deep ocean sediments are typically [[graptolit]]ic black shales.&lt;ref name=Jeppsson1990/&gt;
A typical cycle of ''secundo-primo'' episodes and ensuing ''event'' typically lasts around 3&amp;nbsp;Ma.&lt;ref name=Jeppsson1997/&gt;

The duration of events is so long compared to their onset because the positive feedbacks must be overwhelmed.  Carbon content in the ocean-atmosphere system is affected by changes in weathering rates, which in turn is dominantly controlled by rainfall. Because this is inversely related to temperature in Silurian times, carbon is gradually drawn down during warm (high {{co2}}) S-episodes, while the reverse is true during P-episodes.  On top of this gradual trend is overprinted the signal of [[Milankovic cycles]], which ultimately trigger the switch between P- and S- episodes.&lt;ref name=Jeppsson1997/&gt;

These events become longer during the Devonian; the enlarging land plant biota probably acted as a large buffer to carbon dioxide concentrations.&lt;ref name=Jeppsson1997/&gt;

The end-Ordovician Hirnantian event may alternatively be a result of algal blooms, caused by sudden supply of nutrients through wind-driven upwelling or an influx of nutrient-rich meltwater from melting glaciers, which by virtue of its fresh nature would also slow down oceanic circulation.&lt;ref name="Lüning2006"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archean and Proterozoic===
It has been thought that through most of Earth's history, oceans were largely oxygen-deficient. During the [[Archean]], euxinia was largely absent because of low availability of [[sulfate]] in the oceans,&lt;ref name="Kump 2008"/&gt; but during the Proterozoic, it would become more common.

{{italictitle}}
'''''Antidosis''''' ([[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀντίδοσις}}), is the title of a speech treatise by the ancient Greek [[rhetoric]]ian, [[Isocrates]].  The ''Antidosis'' can be viewed as a defense, an [[autobiography]], or rhetorical treatise. However, since Isocrates wrote it when he was 82 years old, it is generally seen by some people as an autobiography.  The title literally translates as “an exchange,” and was applied in ancient [[Greece|Greek]] courts as a peculiar law pertaining to an exchange of estates between two parties.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.stoa.org/projects/demos/article_law_glossary?page=5&amp;greekEncoding= ''Antidosis'' as an Ancient Athenian legal term]&lt;/ref&gt;  If one of the 1200 wealthiest Athenians eligible was tasked with the performance of a public liturgy and financing one of the many public concerns of [[Athens]], then he could avoid the duty by nominating a richer man who was more qualified than himself to perform it.  If the supposedly richer man disagreed with the terms, then the entirety of their estates would be exchanged and the now more wealthy man would have to perform the [[liturgy]], as originally planned.  The law inspired Isocrates' ''Antidosis'', which was written in the form of a [[Legal case|court case]] where Isocrates had to defend himself from a charge of corrupting the youth by teaching them how to speak well in order for them to gain an unfair advantage over their peers.  Although this work is put forward by Isocrates as his imagined defense in a legal case, it is more a treatise on [[morality]] and teaching.

== As a Court Case ==
Although it is assumed that he is defending himself from a charge of corrupting the youth, nowhere in his Antidosis does Isocrates mention what [[crime]] he is charged with and from which he must defend, nor does it say what the penalty would be for being found guilty.  Isocrates also does not make any attempt to offer evidence in his favor, yet presents the defense that he is a good [[teacher]] to his students as the full defense for the crime that he has committed.  There is no specific mention of anything that would prove him innocent in this particular case.

Another idea by scholars is that early on in the ''Antidosis'', Isocrates reads aloud that he is being indicted for corrupting his students.  He is accused of educating his students to speak against the courts, question the laws, and think for themselves.  Isocrates says, “Here is the indictment my accuser endeavors to vilify me, charging that I corrupt young men by teaching them to speak and gain their won advantage in the courts contrary to justice…”&lt;ref&gt;Isocrates. The Antidosis. Harvard: Harvard UP, 1929. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Isocrates is being charged by Lysimachus who has accused Isocrates of receiving money from his students.  In return, Isocrates has been teaching them how to become better public speakers and leaders.  Isocrates proves his innocence by showing, that through teaching his students rhetoric, he is teaching them how to become better citizens and leaders of Athens.  Isocrates proved his rationale by citing the accomplishments and devotion to the state his students displayed after being educated by him.  Isocrates says in his defense, “But, I beg of you, consider well whether I appear to you to corrupt the young by my words, or, on the contrary, to inspire them to a life of valor and of dangers endured for their country…”&lt;ref&gt;Isocrates. The Antidosis. Harvard: Harvard UP, 1929. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  B. Keith Murphy says of Isocrates’s defense, “For Isocrates, it is through rhetoric that we can approximate truth, or at least a consensual truth. A man who is trained in rhetoric is trained in truth, and the creation of that truth through oratory.”&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, B. Keith. "Isocrates." Salem Press, 1998. Web. 29 Apr 2011. &lt;http://www.keithmurphy.info/399/Isoc.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  

In the sense that he is defending himself from an onerous charge to perform a liturgy, Isocrates makes a claim that his value to the city was provided through his teaching.  He states that as a lifelong teacher, the value of the [[education]] that he has provided for students is worth far more than any monetary donation he can give to Athens.  His teaching has provided for civic-minded and properly educated [[Citizenship|citizen]]s that contribute to the orderly running of the city-state.  For Isocrates to be sentenced to death would be to ignore the public service that he has performed for the city, by which he has devoted his life to giving its citizens a proper rhetorical education.

== As an Autobiography ==
Isocrates was 82 years old at the time he wrote ''Antidosis'', the longest work of his life.  Antidosis is used by the author to depict himself as a model citizen and a contributor to the city-state of Athens.  Since he was nearing the end of his life, he presumably would have wanted to leave behind a legacy of a devoted and moderate citizen to his home town and to justify his life as a service to Athens and the citizens to whom he taught rhetoric.  Isocrates presents himself as a quiet citizen who avoids the public light, where [[Public speaking|oratory]] is used in a way to bring many different cases of [[Lawsuit|litigation]] against each other - which the elite believed to negatively affect the way in which the [[republic]] was run.  He tries to withdraw himself from the public interfering and intrusive efforts made into [[Democracy|democratic]] politics.

The ''Antidosis'' is not seen by some as an autobiography of Isocrates; it was written later in his life as a fictionalized story similar to his own court trial.  While there are similarities between Isocrates’s real court case and the one in the ''Antidosis'', many aspects of the case were fictionalized.  Examples are Lysimachus being the person who has brought Isocrates to trial for this crime, and the crime being different from the one with which he was actually accused.  According to George Norlin, “At any rate, in the ''Antidosis''-a title which he borrows from the actual suit to which he had just been subjected-he adopts the fiction of a capital charge brought against him by an informer named Lysimachus, and of a trial before a court with its accessories.”&lt;ref&gt;Norlin, George. The Antidosis. Harvard: Harvard UP, 1929. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  

It is known that in his own life Isocrates did in fact go to court in his own defense over an amount of money he was made to pay.  Isocrates argued this fine was based on the fact people thought he was wealthier than he actually was.  He claimed this distorted perception of his wealth was due to his popularity as a public figure.  This is similar to Isocrates’s defense in the ''Antidosis'' in which he claims he has been indicted due to the fact he is a very successful person, people are jealous of him, and people want to publicly embarrass him.  In the ''Antidosis'', Isocrates is charged with corrupting the youth by teaching them to become good public speakers.  With this ability, the students may trick people by convincing them of false truths which could ultimately allow the students to corrupt the government.  This is an obvious defense of his life’s work of teaching.

==As a Rhetorical Treatise==
Isocrates states that the teacher should be judged by his students, in that if they do good and moral works then the teacher has done a good job and should be [[praise]]d.  This directly opposes [[Gorgias]]’ view that it is not up to him how his students use what he teaches them.  

At the end of his Antidosis, Isocrates explains how he attempts to keep his students in high moral standing by discouraging some of the more debaucherous behaviors available in the city, such as “participating in drinking-bouts and [[Gambling|tossing dice]] in gambling dens.”  He posits the idea that as a teacher, he can be judged as successful by the moral ways in which his students live their lives when compared to other young men who are wasting their youth in revelry. Hence he agrees to submit to the punishment if any of his students can be shown to be bad influences on [[society]] and challenges his accuser to present even one student who could be said to belong to the group of degenerate youth.

Another important topic is natural talent. Isocrates argues that native ability is necessary for becoming a good orator, along with a proper education on the subject and practical experience.

==Commentary==
D. S. Hutchinson and Monte Johnson (2010) pointed out&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.protrepticus.info/2011/06/antidosis-and-protrepticus.html|title=Antidosis and Protrepticus|year=2011|authors=D. S. Hutchinson and Monte Ransome Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''Aristotle’s Protrepticus was written in the late 350s in polemical response to a work by the Athenian philosopher and teacher Isocrates called the Antidosis. In this work, Isocrates contested the application of the word philosophy to the kind of abstract and speculative mathematical preoccupations current in Plato’s Academy. For him, education and philosophy meant training men to become effective political leaders, and the means to this was training in rhetoric. Speculation about advanced mathematics, astronomy, and the “elements” or “principles” of nature were useful as “mental gymnastic” for the young but, according to the argument, in adulthood become distractions from the important business of military, political, and legal action. In the Protrepticus, Aristotle responded to Isocrates’ attack on Academic philosophy by defending the search for the elements and principles of nature as the best means not only for political science, but for every other goal in life as well.''

'''Arthur Asa Berger''' (born 1933) is Professor Emeritus in Broadcast and Electronic Communication Arts at [[San Francisco State University]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sagepub.com/authorDetails.nav?contribId=501254&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
He received a "Catholic" education in his public high school despite the fact that he is Jewish. Most of his teachers were [[Catholics]] who were educated at [[Boston College]] or [[College of the Holy Cross]]. He gradually developed interest in writing and drawing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.enculturation.net/writing-myself-into-existence&lt;/ref&gt;
He got a B.A. in literature and philosophy at the University of Massachusetts in 1954, assuming that a good education would fit him for any job. Then he applied to graduate school in journalism, thinking that he liked to write and might find journalism an interesting career. He was accepted into the [[University of California Berkeley]] journalism school and started there in the summer of 1954 but transferred to the University of Iowa where he could work with people like Marguerite Young. He was also able to take a couple of philosophy courses with [[Gustav Bergmann]] from the Vienna Circle. He was drafted in the summer of 1956, eleven days after he received his MA. He got out of the Army in 1958 and went to Europe for a year.

==Academic career==
[[File:پروفسور برگر.jpg|thumb|Arthur Asa Berger during a lecture at [[University of Tehran]] in May 2015]]
A year after he came back from Europe, he enrolled at the University of Minnesota’s program for a Ph.D in [[American Studies]]. In time, he ended up teaching in the Broadcast and Electronic Communication Arts department at [[San Francisco State University]] where he taught courses on writing and media criticism. Berger has published more than 130 articles and more than 70 books in the course of his career.  He spent 1963-64 as a [[U.S.-Italy Fulbright Commission|Fulbright]] scholar at the University of Milan and has also taught at Jinan University and Tsing Hua university in China, spent a month as a Fulbright Senior Specialist lecturing on semiotics in Argentina and lectured in more than a dozen universities in various countries.&lt;ref&gt;Ralon, L. (2012), Interview with Arthur Asa Berger Professor Emeritus Broadcast and Electronic Communication Arts [[San Francisco State University]].The Popular Culture Studies Journal, Vol. 1, No. 1&amp;2,  126-137&lt;/ref&gt; His works have been cited thousands of times by international academics.&lt;ref&gt;https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RPJrfN0AAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Berger is married to Philis Berger and they have two children. Their son Gabriel went to [[Harvard University|Harvard]] for his BA and has a Ph.D. in
mathematics from Columbia.  He works for Google now.  Their daughter Nina has a doctorate from an institute that trains psychoanalysts and is a psychoanalyst. [[Jason Berger]] was his brother. He manages his personal weblog named ''Decoder Man''.&lt;ref&gt;http://decoderman.blogspot.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Assembly Rooms, Bath - geograph.org.uk - 979274.jpg|thumb|The Assembly Rooms, Bath]]
In [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]], especially in the [[18th century Britain|18th]] and 19th centuries, '''assembly rooms''' were gathering places for members of the higher [[social class]]es open to members of both sexes. At that time most entertaining was done at home and there were few public places of entertainment open to both sexes besides theatres (and there were few of those outside London). [[Upper class]] men had more options, including [[coffee house]]s and later [[gentlemen's club]]s. 

Major sets of assembly rooms in London, in [[spa town]]s such as [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], and in important provincial cities such as [[York]], were able to accommodate hundreds, or in some cases over a thousand people for events such as [[masquerade ball]]s (masked balls), [[Ball (dance)|conventional balls]], public concerts and assemblies (simply gatherings for conversation, perhaps with incidental music and entertainments) or [[Salon (gathering)|Salons]]. By later standards these were formal events: the attendees were usually screened to make sure no one of insufficient rank gained admittance; admission might be subscription only; and unmarried women were [[Chaperone (social)|chaperoned]]. Nonetheless, assemblies played an important part in the marriage market of the day.  

A major set of assembly rooms consisted of a main room and several smaller subsidiary rooms such as card rooms, tea rooms and supper rooms. On the other hand, in smaller towns a single large room attached to the best inn might serve for the occasional assembly for the local [[landed gentry]]. 

Formal assemblies and the associated assembly rooms faded away in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, as the range of places of public entertainment increased (for example public dance halls and nightclubs) and attitudes became more accepting of women from the higher social classes attending them. Also to some extent they were supplanted by the ballrooms of major hotels as British hotels became larger from the railway age onwards.

==Examples==

*[[Pantheon, London|The Pantheon]] - an architecturally grander but more briefly fashionable set of assembly rooms in London.
*[[Bath Assembly Rooms]] - the assembly rooms in England's most fashionable spa.

==Public gardens==
London also had a number of outdoor "public gardens" where similar entertainments took place. They were more commercial establishments and tended to have less exclusive rules on admission. Each had at least one major indoor space for balls and the like. See: [[Marylebone Gardens]], [[Vauxhall Gardens]], [[Ranelagh Gardens]] and [[Cremorne Gardens, London|Cremorne Gardens]].

Augustine is credited with developing the first form of the [[theodicy]] now named for him.]]
{{Philosophy of religion sidebar |challenges}}

The '''Augustinian theodicy''', named for the 4th- and 5th-century theologian, philosopher and (according to some [[Christian denominations]]) [[Saint#Christianity|Saint]] [[Augustine of Hippo]], is a type of [[Christian theology|Christian]] [[theodicy]] designed in response to the [[evidential problem of evil]]. As such, it attempts to explain the probability of an [[omnipotence|omnipotent]] (all-powerful) and [[omnibenevolence|omnibenevolent]] (all-good) [[God in Christianity|God]] amid evidence of evil in the world. A number of variations of this kind of theodicy have been proposed throughout history; their similarities were first described by the 20th-century philosopher [[John Hick]], who classified them as "Augustinian". They typically assert that God is perfectly (ideally) [[good and evil|good]]; that he created the world [[Ex nihilo|out of nothing]]; and that evil is the result of humanity's [[original sin]]. The entry of evil into the world is generally explained as punishment for [[sin]] and its continued presence due to humans' misuse of [[free will]]. God's goodness and benevolence, according to the Augustinian theodicy, remain perfect and without responsibility for evil or suffering.

Augustine of Hippo was the first to develop the theodicy. He rejected the idea that evil exists in itself, instead regarding it as a corruption of goodness, caused by humanity's abuse of free will. Augustine believed in the existence of a physical [[Hell]] as a punishment for sin, but argued that those who choose to accept the [[salvation (Christianity)|salvation]] of [[Jesus Christ]] will go to [[Heaven]]. In the 13th century, [[Thomas Aquinas]] &amp;ndash; influenced by Augustine &amp;ndash; proposed a similar theodicy based on the view that God is goodness and that there can be no evil in him. He believed that the existence of goodness allows evil to exist, through the fault of humans. Augustine also influenced [[John Calvin]], who supported Augustine's view that evil is the result of free will and argued that sin corrupts humans, requiring God's [[grace (Christianity) |grace]] to give moral guidance.

The theodicy was criticised by Augustine's contemporary Fortunatus, a [[Manichaeism|Manichaean]] who contended that God must still be somehow implicated in evil, and 18th-century theologian [[Francesco Antonio Zaccaria]] criticised Augustine's concept of evil for not dealing with individual human suffering. Hick regards evil as necessary for the moral and spiritual development of humans, and [[process theology|process theologians]] have argued that God is not omnipotent and so cannot be responsible for any evil. The logic of Augustine's approach has been adapted by [[Alvin Plantinga]], among others. Plantinga's adapted Augustinian theodicy, the [[free will defence]] &amp;ndash; which he proposed in the 1980s &amp;ndash; attempts to answer only the [[logical problem of evil]]. Such a defence (not a "theodicy" proper) does not demonstrate the existence of God, or the probable existence of God, but attempts to prove that the existence of God and the presence of evil (or ''[[privatio boni]]'') in the world are not logically contradictory.

==General forms==
The Augustinian theodicy was first distinguished as a form of [[theodicy]] by [[John Hick]] in ''Evil and the God of Love'', written in 1966, in which he classified Augustine's theodicy and its subsequent developments as "Augustinian". Hick distinguished between the Augustinian theodicy, which attempts to clear God of all responsibility for evil, based on human free will, and the [[Irenaean theodicy]], which casts [[God]] as responsible for evil but justified because of its benefits for human development.&lt;ref name=Hall2003&gt;Hall 2003, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

The Augustinian theodicy is a response to the [[Problem of evil#Evidential problem of evil|evidential problem of evil]],&lt;ref name=S&amp;P2010&gt;Svendsen &amp; Pierce 2010, pp. 48–49&lt;/ref&gt; which raises the concern that if God is [[omnipotent]] and [[omnibenevolent]], there should be no evil in the world. Evidence of evil can call into question God's nature or his existence&amp;nbsp;– he is either not omnipotent, not benevolent, or does not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evil/#DirIndVerEviArgEvi | title=The Problem of Evil |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | origyear=16 September 2002 |date=21 August 2009 | accessdate=8 February 2012 | author=Tooley, Michael|authorlink=Michael Tooley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theodicy is an attempt to reconcile the existence and nature of God with evidence of evil in the world by providing valid explanations for its occurrence.&lt;ref name=S&amp;P2010 /&gt; The Augustinian theodicy asserts that God created the world ''[[ex nihilo]]'' (out of nothing), but maintains that God did not create evil and is not responsible for its occurrence.&lt;ref name=Bennett2008&gt;Bennett, Peters, Hewlett &amp; Russell 2008, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; Evil is not attributed existence in its own right, but is described as the [[privation]] of good&amp;nbsp;– the corruption of God's good creation.&lt;ref name="Menn"&gt;Menn 2002, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;

The Augustinian theodicy supports the notion of [[original sin]]. All versions of this theodicy accept the theological implications of the [[Genesis creation narrative]], including the belief that God created human beings without sin or suffering. Evil is believed to be a just punishment for the [[fall of man]]: when Adam and Eve first disobeyed God and were exiled from the [[Garden of Eden]].&lt;ref&gt;Corey 2000, pp. 177–178&lt;/ref&gt; The free will of humans is offered by the Augustinian theodicy as the continued reason for [[moral evil]]: people commit immoral acts when their will is evil.&lt;ref name="Svendsen&amp;Pierce2010"/&gt; The evil nature of human will is attributed to original sin; Augustinian theologians argue that the sin of Adam and Eve corrupted the will of human beings,&lt;ref&gt;Green 2011, p. 779&lt;/ref&gt; maintaining that God is blameless and good, and not himself responsible for evil.&lt;ref name=Geivett&gt;Geivett 1995, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

===Augustine===
[[Augustine of Hippo]] (354–430 AD) was a philosopher and theologian born in [[Africa (Roman province)|Roman Africa]] (present-day [[Algeria]]). He followed the [[Manichaeism|Manichaean religion]] during his early life, but converted to Christianity in 386. His two major works, ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]'' and ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'', develop key ideas regarding his response to suffering. In ''Confessions'', Augustine wrote that his previous work was dominated by [[materialism]] and that reading [[Plato]]'s works enabled him to consider the existence of a non-physical [[substance theory|substance]]. This helped him develop a response to the problem of evil from a theological (and non-Manichean) perspective,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/augustine/#OntEud | title=Saint Augustine |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | origyear=24 March 2000 |date=12 November 2010 | accessdate=9 October 2011 | author=Mendelson, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on his interpretation of the first few chapters of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] and the writings of [[Paul the Apostle]].&lt;ref&gt;Korsmeyer 1995, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; In ''City of God'', Augustine developed his theodicy as part of his attempt to trace human history and describe its conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/augustine/#HisEsc | title=Saint Augustine |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | origyear=24 March 2000 |date=12 November 2010 | accessdate=9 October 2011 | author=Mendelson, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine proposed that evil could not exist within God, nor be created by God, and is instead a by-product of God's creativity.&lt;ref&gt;Menn 2002, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; He rejected the notion that evil exists in itself, proposing instead that it is a privation of (or falling away from) good, and a corruption of nature.&lt;ref name="Menn" /&gt; He wrote that "evil has no positive nature; but the loss of good has received the name 'evil.'"&lt;ref&gt;''The City of God'', Augustine of Hippo, Book XI, Chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt; Both moral and [[natural evil]] occurs, Augustine argued, owing to an evil use of free will,&lt;ref name=Bennett2008 /&gt; which could be traced back to [[Adam and Eve|Adam and Eve's]] original sin.&lt;ref name=Svendsen&amp;Pierce2010&gt;Svendsen &amp; Pierce 2010, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that this evil will, present in the [[soul|human soul]], was a corruption of the will given to humans by God, making suffering a just punishment for the sin of humans.&lt;ref&gt;Menn 2002, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; Because Augustine believed that all of humanity was "[[Preformationism|seminally present in the loins of Adam]]", he argued that all of humanity inherited Adam's sin and his just punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, Peters, Hewlett &amp; Russell 2008, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; However, in spite of his belief that free will can be turned to evil, Augustine maintained that it is vital for humans to have free will, because they could not live well without it. He argued that evil could come from humans because, although humans contained no evil, they were also not perfectly good and hence could be corrupted.&lt;ref&gt;Menn 2002, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine believed that a physical [[Hell]] exists, but that physical punishment is secondary to the punishment of being separated from God. He proposed two reasons for this: Firstly, humans have free will, and only those who choose to follow God will be forgiven and able to avoid Hell.&lt;ref&gt;Cavadini 1999, p. 422&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, he believed that Adam and Eve's choice to sin affected our free choice, and that humans are left unable to resist sin.&lt;ref name=Cavadini1999p423&gt;Cavadini 1999, p. 423&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine proposed that the grace of Jesus Christ freed humans from original sin, but he maintained that humans can only be saved if they choose to receive grace, and that this choice is formed by the character of individual humans. Accepting that even those who will be saved continue to sin, Augustine proposed that those who choose God's grace will still go to Hell for a time to purge them of their sin, before going to Heaven.&lt;ref name=Cavadini1999p423 /&gt;

===Thomas Aquinas===
[[File:Gentile da Fabriano 052.jpg|thumb|[[Gentile da Fabriano]]'s portrait of Thomas Aquinas, who developed a theodicy heavily influenced by Augustine]]
Thomas Aquinas, a thirteenth-century [[scholasticism|scholastic]] philosopher and theologian heavily influenced by Augustine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aquinas/#ThoAri | title=Saint Thomas Aquinas | work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | origyear=12 July 1999 | date=30 September 2009 | accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a form of the Augustinian theodicy in his ''[[Summa Theologica]]''. Aquinas began by attempting to establish the existence of God,&lt;ref name="Little"&gt;Little 2005, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; through his [[Quinque viae|Five Ways]], and then attested that God is good and must have a morally sufficient reason for allowing evil to exist.&lt;ref&gt;Geivett 1995, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas proposed that all goodness in the world must exist perfectly in God, and that, existing perfectly, God must be perfectly good. He concluded that God is goodness, and that there is no evil in God.&lt;ref name=Geivett /&gt;

Aquinas supported Augustine's view that evil is a privation of goodness, maintaining that evil has existence as a privation intrinsically found in good.&lt;ref&gt;Geivett 1995, pp. 19–20&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of this evil, Aquinas believed, can be completely explained by free will. Faced with the assertion that humans would have been better off without free will, he argued that the possibility of sin is necessary for a perfect world, and so individuals are responsible for their sin.&lt;ref name=Svendsen&amp;Pierce2010 /&gt; Good is the cause of evil, but only owing to fault on the part of the [[moral agency|agent]]. In his theodicy, to say something is evil is to say that it lacks goodness which means that it could not be part of God's creation, because God's creation lacked nothing. Aquinas noted that, although goodness makes evil possible, it does not necessitate evil. This means that God (who is good) is not cast as the cause of evil, because evil arises out of a defect in an agent, and God is seen to be without defect.&lt;ref&gt;Little 2005, pp.&amp;nbsp;42–43&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher Eleonore Stump, considering Aquinas' commentary on the [[Book of Job]], argues that Aquinas has a positive view of suffering: it is necessary to contrast Earth with [[heaven]] and remind humans that they still have the propensity to commit evil.&lt;ref name="Little" /&gt; Aquinas believed that evil is acceptable because of the good that comes from it, and that evil can only be justified when it is required in order for good to occur.&lt;ref&gt;Howard-Snyder 1996, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; Attempting to relieve God of responsibility for the occurrence of evil, Aquinas insisted that God merely permits evil to happen, rather than willing it.&lt;ref&gt;Korsmeyer 1995, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; He recognised the occurrence of what seems to be evil, but did not attribute to it the same level of existence that he attributed to spirituality. Like Augustine, Aquinas asserted that humans bear responsibility for evil owing to their abuse of free will.&lt;ref&gt;Wawrykow 2005, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Calvin===

[[John Calvin]], a sixteenth-century French theologian and principal figure in the development of [[Calvinism]], was influenced by Augustine's works.&lt;ref name="Cavadini"&gt;Cavadini 1999, pp. 116–118&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Augustine, Calvin was willing to accept that God is responsible for evil and suffering; however, he maintained that God cannot be [[indictment|indicted]] for it.&lt;ref&gt;Case-Winters 1990, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; Calvin continued the Augustinian approach that sin is the result of the fall of man, and argued that the human [[mind]], [[Will (philosophy)|will]], and [[Emotion|affections]] are corrupted by sin. He believed that only the grace of God is sufficient to provide humans with ongoing ethical guidance, arguing that reason is blinded by humans' sinful nature.&lt;ref&gt;McKim 2004, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; Calvin proposed that humanity is [[predestined]], divided into the elect and the [[Reprobation|reprobate]]: the elect are those who God has chosen to save and are the only ones who will be saved.&lt;ref&gt;Steele &amp; Thomas 1963, pp. 15–17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[File:Hortus Deliciarum - Hell.jpg|thumb|John Hick criticised the Augustinian concept of Hell, vividly depicted in this twelfth-century painting by Herrad von Landsberg.]]

===Fortunatus===
Augustine's ''Acts or Disputation Against Fortunatus the Manichaean'', which partly touches on the problem of evil, records a public debate between Augustine and the Manichaean teacher Fortunatus. Fortunatus criticised Augustine's theodicy by proposing that if God gave free will to the human soul, then he must be implicated in human sin (a problem that Augustine had himself considered four years earlier, in ''Free Will''). Quoting the [[New Testament]], Fortunatus proposed that evil exists beyond the evil acts people commit, and that people commit such acts because of their own flawed nature.&lt;ref&gt;Fredriksen 2010, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine replied by arguing that the sin of Adam constrained human freedom, in a way similar to the formation of [[Habit (psychology)|habits]].&lt;ref&gt;''Acts or Disputation Against Fortunatus the Manichaean'', Augustine of Hippo, Ch. XXII&lt;/ref&gt; This was not a teaching on original sin (a view that Augustine was yet to formulate), but on the limitations of human freedom caused by sin.&lt;ref&gt;Fredriksen 2010, pp. 146–147&lt;/ref&gt; Fortunatus proposed that Augustine was reducing the scope of evil only to what is committed by humans, though Augustine writes that Fortunatus finally conceded the debate when he admitted that he could not defend his views on the origin of evil.&lt;ref&gt;Fredriksen 2010, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
Scholars of religion Paul Ingram and Frederick Streng argued that the teachings of [[Buddhism]] challenge Augustine's view of good and evil, proposing a [[dualistic cosmology|dualism]] in which good and evil have equal value instead of casting good over evil, as Augustine did. This is similar to the Manicheist account of good and evil&amp;nbsp;– that the two are equal and in conflict&amp;nbsp;– though Buddhism teaches that the two will come to a final conclusion and transcend the conflict.&lt;ref name="Ingram"&gt;Ingram &amp; Streng 1986, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; Ingram and Streng argued that the Augustinian theodicy fails to account for the existence of evil before Adam's sin, which Genesis presents in the form of the [[Serpent (Bible)|serpent's]] temptation.&lt;ref name="Ingram" /&gt;

===Francesco Antonio Zaccaria===
The Italian theologian [[Francesco Antonio Zaccaria]] criticised Augustine's concept of evil in the eighteenth century. He noted a distinction between using the term evil to imply blame (sin) and to imply lament (suffering) and argued that Augustine posited sin to have occurred before suffering. This was problematic for Zaccaria, who believed that it made Augustine seem offhand and uninterested in human suffering. For Zaccaria, Augustine's perception of evil as a privation did not satisfactorily answer the questions of modern society as to why suffering exists.&lt;ref&gt;Zaccaria 2009, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Hick===
John Hick criticised the Augustinian theodicy when he developed his own theodicy in 1966. Hick supported the views of the German theologian [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]], which he classified as Irenaean, who argued that the world is perfectly suited for the moral development of humans and that this justifies the existence of evil. He insisted that, while the Augustinian theodicy attempted to justify historical occurrences of evil, the [[Irenaean theodicy]] seeks to justify God eternally. Hick saw Augustine's view that a perfect world went wrong as incoherent and contradictory, and argued that, if humans were made perfectly good, then it should have been impossible for them to have made an immoral choice. He questioned the success of the theodicy with the charge that it does not remove the blame for evil from God: Augustine presented a theology of predestination; Hick argued that, if God knew the choices that his creation would make, he must be responsible for them.&lt;ref&gt;Cheetham 2003, pp. 40–42&lt;/ref&gt; Hick's theodicy rejected the idea of the inheritance of sinfulness, and he believed that an eternal hell would render "a Christian theodicy impossible".&lt;ref&gt;Hick 2010, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; The Irenaean theodicy does not, as the Augustinian theodicy does, attempt to protect God from being responsible for evil; rather, it argues that God is responsible but justified for it because of the benefits it has for human development. Both theodicies stress the perfection of God's creation, but differ in why the world is seen as perfect. Augustine also believed, as Hick did, that bringing good out of evil is preferable to the evil not occurring in the first place.&lt;ref name=B&amp;N2005&gt;Barber &amp; Neville 2005, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

===Process theology===
In ''God, Power and Evil: A Process Theodicy'', published in 1976, [[David Ray Griffin]] criticised Augustine's reliance on free will and argued that it is incompatible with divine [[omniscience]] and omnipotence. Griffin argued in later works that humans cannot have free will if God is omniscient. He contented that, if God is truly omniscient, then he will know infallibly what people will do, meaning that they cannot be free. Griffin argued that the human will could not oppose God's will, if God is omnipotent. He proposed that original sin as Augustine conceived it must itself be caused by God, rendering any punishment he wills unjust.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin 1976, pp. 60–66&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Process theology]] argues that God is not omnipotent: rather than coercion, he has the power of divine persuasion, but he cannot force his will. Griffin, a prominent process theologian, argues that God feels the pain of the world (both physically and emotionally) and does everything within his power to achieve good, but he can neither force beings to be good nor prevent evil because he does not play a coercive role in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Melse 1993, pp. 13–24&lt;/ref&gt; Process theology teaches that, rather than creating the world ''ex nihilo'' (as Augustine proposed), God created it out of a pre-existent chaos.&lt;ref&gt;Cobb &amp; Griffin 1976, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alvin Plantinga===
[[File:AlvinPlantinga.JPG|thumb|[[Alvin Plantinga]], who presented a version of the free will defence as an alternative response to the problem of evil]]
In the 1980s, [[Alvin Plantinga]] presented a version of the free will defence which, he argued, demonstrated that the existence of an omnipotent benevolent God and of evil are not inconsistent. He believed that, unless it could be shown that the two are not inconsistent, they would be necessarily contradictory.&lt;ref&gt;Plantinga &amp; Sennett 1998, pp. 22–23&lt;/ref&gt; To do this, Plantinga believed that a "possible state of affairs" must be proposed which, if actual, would make God's existence and the existence of evil consistent.&lt;ref&gt;Plantinga &amp; Sennett 1998, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that a third proposition&amp;nbsp;– that evil is the result of the actions of free, rational, fallible human beings&amp;nbsp;– allows the existence of God and evil to be consistent.&lt;ref name=McGrath1995&gt;McGrath 1995, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga supported this argument by claiming that there are some things that an omnipotent God could not do, yet remain omnipotent&amp;nbsp;– for example, if an omnipotent God has necessary existence, he could not create a world in which he does not exist. For this reason, Plantinga argued that an omnipotent God could not create any universe that he chooses, as Leibniz had proposed. He suggested that, even in a world where humans have free will, their actions may be so predictable that God could not create a world where they would do something unpredictable.{{efn|Steve Duncan used the example of a rational man who is offered $5 for a Rembrandt. Assuming that he understands the meaning of the transaction and has no other reason to accept the offer, it can be predicted that he will reject the offer. Duncan holds that God could not create a world where the man freely accepts the offer (without changing the situation), illustrating Plantinga's point. {{refn|Duncan 2007, p. 105}} }} Finally, he argued that if every moral agent freely makes at least one bad moral decision in any possible universe, God cannot create a universe where there is human freedom and no evil. Plantinga maintained that the existence of an omnipotent, benevolent God and the existence of evil are not inconsistent.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan 2007, pp. 105–106&lt;/ref&gt;

Plantinga's version of the defence embraces Augustine's view of free will, but not his [[natural theology]].&lt;ref&gt;Geivett 1995, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than attempt to show the existence of God as likely in the face of evil, as a theodicy does, Plantinga's free will defence attempts to show that belief in God is still logically possible, despite the existence of evil.&lt;ref&gt;Geivett 1995, pp. 60–61&lt;/ref&gt; Theologian [[Alister McGrath]] has noted that, because Plantinga only argued that the coexistence of God and evil are logically possible, he did not present a theodicy, but a defence. Plantinga did not attempt to demonstrate that his proposition is true or plausible, just that it is logically possible.&lt;ref name=McGrath1995 /&gt;

===Critique from an evolutionary scientific position===
Supposing that the evolutionary theory, the current consensus, is correct, John Hick criticised Augustine's theory for being "implausible" in light of Darwin's theory of [[evolution]], as it would make Augustine's idea of a fall from perfection inaccurate;&lt;ref&gt;Davis 2001, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; this is reiterated by professors [[Nancey Murphy]] and [[George Francis Rayner Ellis]], who also contend that Augustine's idea of transmitting original sin from Adam to the rest of humanity requires biological explanation.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis &amp; Murphy 1996, p. 244&lt;/ref&gt; Professor of Comparative Religion [[Arvind Sharma]] has argued that natural evil cannot be the result of moral evil in the way Augustine suggested: scientific consensus is that natural disasters and disease existed before humans and hence cannot be the result of human sin.&lt;ref&gt;Sharma 2006, pp. 85–86&lt;/ref&gt; 

The twentieth-century philosopher [[Reinhold Niebuhr]] attempted to reinterpret the Augustinian theodicy in the light of evolutionary science by presenting its underlying argument without [[Creation myth|mythology]]. Niebuhr proposed that Augustine rejected the Manichean view that grants evil [[ontology|ontological]] existence and ties humans' sin to their created state. Augustine's argument continued, according to Niebuhr, by proposing that humans have a tendency to sin because of a biologically inherited nature and rejected the [[Pelagian view]] that human will could overcome sin on its own.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, Peters, Hewlett &amp; Russell 2008, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; Niebuhr believed Augustine's argument placed sin in the human will, which was corrupted by Adam's original sin. He argued that the logic behind Augustine's theodicy described sin as inevitable but unnecessary, which he believed captured the argument without relying on a literal interpretation of the fall, thus avoiding critique from scientific positions.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, Peters, Hewlett &amp; Russell 2008, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aahl-geelong-australia.jpg|thumb|230px|Australian Animal Health Laboratory]]
'''The Australian Animal Health Laboratory''' ''(AAHL)'' in [[Geelong]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]] is a high security laboratory, run by the [[CSIRO]] for exotic animal disease diagnosis and research. The lab is one of four [[Biosafety Level]]-4 labs in the country.

It opened in 1985 costing $185 million, built on [[Corio Oval]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csiro.au/en/Organisation-Structure/National-Facilities/Australian-Animal-Health-Laboratory.aspx CSIRO: Geelong - Australian Animal Health Laboratory]&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012 it delivered an experimental vaccine to help protect horses against the deadly Hendra virus. &lt;ref&gt;http://csironewsblog.com/2012/11/01/vaccine-arrives-to-boost-the-frontline-fight-against-hendra-virus/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10577">In [[science studies]], '''boundary-work''' comprises instances in which boundaries, demarcations, or other divisions between fields of knowledge are created, advocated, attacked, or reinforced. Academic scholarship on boundary-work{{which|date=August 2013}} has emphasized that such delineations often have high stakes involved for the participants, and carries with it the implication that such boundaries are flexible and [[social construction|socially constructed]].

== Thomas F. Gieryn ==
The original use of the term "boundary-work" for these sorts of issues has been attributed to [[Thomas F. Gieryn]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gieryn|first1=Thomas F.|title=Cultural Boundaries of Science|date=1999|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-29262-2|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[sociology|sociologist]], who initially used it to discuss the [[problem of demarcation]], the philosophical difficulty of coming up with a rigorous delineation between what is "science" and what is "[[non-science]]".&lt;ref&gt;In 1999 Gieryn (1999a, p.5) stated that the “boundary” concept he introduced in his 1983 paper had been suggested by a presentation by [[Steve Woolgar]] to a meeting of the [[Society for the Social Studies of Science]] in November 1981. He attributed the mature development of his ideas to the influences of (in order of publication) Geertz (1973), Serres, (1982), Geertz (1983), Gilbert and Mulkay (1984), Shapin and Schaffer (1985), Yearley (1988), Holmquest (1990), Reichert (1992), Abbot (1995), Silber (1995), McOmber (1996), Taylor (1996), Kerr, Cunningham-Burley, and Amos (1997), and Wolfe (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

Gieryn defined boundary-work as the "attribution of selected characteristics to [an] institution of science (i.e., to its practitioners, methods, stock of knowledge, values and work organization) for purposes of constructing a social boundary that distinguishes some intellectual activities as [outside that boundary]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gieryn|first1=Thomas|title=Boundary-work and the demarcation of science from non-science: Strains and interests in professional ideologies of scientists|journal=American Sociological Review|date=1983|volume=48|issue=6|pages=781–795|url=http://www3.nd.edu/~sskiles/boundaries/Gieryn%201983.pdf|doi=10.2307/2095325|jstor=2095325}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philosophy of science|Philosophers]] and [[sociology of science|sociologists of science]], such as [[Karl Popper]] and [[Robert K. Merton]], long struggled to come up with a criterion which would distinguish science as unique from other knowledge-generating activities, but never were able to come up with one that was stable, transhistorical, or worked reliably.

Gieryn's 1983 paper on boundary-work and demarcation emphasized that the very discussions of demarcation between science and non-science were "ideological"; that there were strong stakes for scientists to erect such boundaries both in arguing for their own [[Objectivity (science)|objectivity]] and the need for [[wikt:autonomy|autonomy]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Gieryn looked specifically at instances of boundary-work in 19th-century Britain, in which scientists attempted to characterize the [[relationship between religion and science]] as one of sharp distinction,&lt;ref&gt;See, in particular, Gieryn, T.F., "John Tyndall's Double Boundary-Work: Science, Religion, and Mechanics in Victorian England", pp.37-64 in Gieryn, T.F., ''Cultural Boundaries of Science: Credibility on the Line'', University of Chicago Press, (Chicago), 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; and also looked at instances in which scientists attempted to argue that science and politics and/or ideology were inherently separate as well. Many other works{{which|date=August 2013}} by sociologists and historians have since looked at boundary-work in many other situations, usually focusing on the [[rhetoric]] of scientists (or their opponents) and their interpersonal and intersocial interactions.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Studies in boundary-work have also focused on how individual scientific disciplines are created.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Yeates (2013, esp. pp.93-101, and 309-349) for an account of the extended boundary-work performed by [[James Braid (surgeon)|James Braid]] in relation to the creation of the domain of hypnotism.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the work of [[Pierre Bourdieu]] on the "scientific field", many have looked at ways in which certain "objects" are able to bridge the erected boundaries because they satisfy the needs of multiple social groups ([[boundary object]]s).

==Examples==
An example of such boundary-work can be found in the study of science and literature. One instance of these studies is [[Aldous Huxley]]'s book [[Literature and Science]] (see also Edward M. Jennings's (Ed.)1970 ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=OtFCAAAAIAAJ&amp;pgis=1 Science and Literature: New Lenses for Criticism]'', [[Anchor Books]] and Harry Raphael Garvin and James M. Heath's ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=PUlhiPtQxJgC Science and Literature]'', [[Bucknell University Press]])

Another example of boundary-work occurred when individual scientists and scientific institutions published statements responding to the allegations of scientific fraud during the "Climategate" episode ([http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09505431.2015.1041902 Ramírez-i-Ollé, 2015]).

'''''The Chamber Music Journal''''' is a [[periodical]] devoted exclusively to non-standard, rare or unknown chamber music of merit. (i.e., not Beethoven, Mozart, Brahms etc.) Between 1990 and 2010, it was published in hardcopy and available by subscription only. Since 2011, it has been exclusively published online. All issues, past and current, are available at no cost. It is under the general editorship of R.H.R. Silvertrust.

The Chamber Music Journal is considered one of the leading chamber music reference sources in English. It features articles with hard-to-find information that often has been published nowhere else, an example being a 13-part series on the 36 string quartets of the important 19th-century French composer [[George Onslow (composer)|George Onslow]]. The chamber music of [[Borodin]], [[Ottorino Respighi|Respighi]], [[Camille Saint-Saëns|Saint-Saëns]], the piano trios of [[Richard Strauss]], the chamber music of the [[Terezin Composers]], [[Joseph Rheinberger]], [[Eric Zeisl]],  [[Max Bruch]], [[Willem Pijper]], [[Zdenek Fibich]], [[Alexander Glazunov|Glazunov]], [[Edmund Rubbra]], [[Luigi Cherubini]], [[Wilhelm Stenhammar]] are among the subjects which appeared in past issues.

}}'''''Engare''''' is a [[Puzzle video game|puzzle game]] created by Iranian game designer Mahdi Bahrami and soundtracked by Mim Rasouli, playable on [[PC game|PC]] and [[MacOS]]. Describing itself as "a game about motion and geometry", ''Engare''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s design is based upon [[Islamic art]] and [[sacred geometry]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.engare.design/|title=Engare|website=www.engare.design|language=en|access-date=2018-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game consists of two gameplay modes: a puzzle-solving mode, where the player has to recreate shapes shown onscreen by placing a point on a moving object, akin to a [[Spirograph]] tool, and a free-form art tool allowing the player to design their own patterns. First prototyped in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/11/07/engare-indie-game-iran-mahdi-bahrami-islamic-art-steam/|title=The surprising Islamic beauty of 'Engare'|work=Engadget|access-date=2018-01-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Engare'' was released in October 2017, and retails for $6.99 on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] and Bahrami's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/415170/Engare/|title=Engare on Steam|website=store.steampowered.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The game's release was delayed by difficulties caused by international [[Sanctions against Iran|sanctions imposed upon Iran]], making it difficult for Bahrami to travel and access resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/glixel/news/what-its-like-to-be-an-iranian-game-creator-in-trumps-america-w463982|title=What It's Like To Be An Iranian Game Creator in Trump's America|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

Bahrami has described the influences behind both the game's aesthetics and mechanics. The traditional Islamic geometric patterns featured in the game are widespread in Iran, and particularly in Bahrami's hometown of [[Isfahan]], including the central [[Naqsh-e Jahan Square]], a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage site]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hyperallergic.com/416579/engare-game-islamic-design/|title=A Puzzle Game Inspired by the Mathematics of Islamic Art|date=2017-12-14|work=Hyperallergic|access-date=2018-01-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game's mechanic was inspired by a question asked by Bahrami's high-school [[geometry]] teacher, when he asked students to imagine what shape would be traced by a point fixed to a ball when rolled across a flat surface - the result being a series of loops.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://killscreen.com/articles/engare-a-videogame-about-the-mathematical-beauty-of-islamic-art/|title=Engare, a videogame about the mathematical beauty of Islamic art - Kill Screen|date=2016-04-01|work=Kill Screen|access-date=2018-01-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahrami explains that even students who did not understand geometry were interested in the answer to this puzzle,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2014/5/12/5696024/engare-mahdi-bahrami|title=An Iranian developer's entrancing game about his culture and the mathematics of art|last=Lien|first=Tracey|date=2014-05-12|website=Polygon|access-date=2018-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he was interested in using ''Engare'' to "explore mathematics in different ways [...] for some people it's easier to explore maths when it's visualised," and that "video games as a medium have great potential [for] these visualisations." &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Despite this, Bahrami says, he did not originally set out to make an [[Educational video game|educational game]]. The game is Bahrami's second to be inspired by traditional Islamic patterns, following ''Farsh,'' a game inspired by [[Persian carpet]]s, which his mother wove when he was growing up.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Gameplay ==

''Engare'' has two gameplay modes. The first is a puzzle-solving mode, where the player must recreate a shape shown on-screen by placing a point on a moving object that is drawn into a line as the object moves. As the puzzles become more complex, the player is rewarded with the creation of more and more intricate patterns created from their solution; in later levels these patterns repeat themselves and are coloured in.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/10/engare-review-spirographs-math-and-islamic-art-blend-for-quite-the-game/|title=Engare review: The geometry of Islamic art becomes a treasure of a game|work=Ars Technica|access-date=2018-01-07|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; After enough puzzles are solved, a second gameplay mode is unlocked: a pattern [[design tool]] where the player can place dots and lines or colour in tiles to create repeating geometric patterns. These patterns can then be mapped onto a 3-D [[Dome|mosque-like dome]] and explored from different perspectives.

== Reception ==

''Engare'' has been received positively, with a demo version presented at the 2014 [[Game Developers Conference#Experimental Gameplay Workshop|GDC Experimental Gameplay Workshop]] generating positive press coverage.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Since its release, ''Engare'' has been praised by Sam Machkovech of ''[[Ars Technica]]'', who describes the game as "[feeling] absolutely magical and unique in the gaming realm," &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and [[Robin Hunicke]] of [[Electronic Arts|EA]] and [[Funomena]], who was "blown away [by] the cleverness of the puzzles".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Rami Ismail of [[Vlambeer]] has praised the game on several occasions, naming it as one of his top 10 games of 2017 in an article for [[Giant Bomb]], and as 'one of the games that he admires the most' in a [[GameSpot]] feature. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.giantbomb.com/articles/rami-ismails-top-10-games-of-2017/1100-5677/|title=Rami Ismail's top 10 games of 2017|last=Ismail|first=Rami|date=2017-12-26|website=Giant Bomb|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nier-psychonauts-and-other-devs-share-what-games-t/1100-6457827/|title=Nier, Psychonauts, And Other Devs Share What Games They Admire Most|last=|first=|date=2018-03-31|website=GameSpot|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game has been similarly well-received by players on Steam, where it holds an overall 'very positive' rating, and has won several awards, including the Student Showcase at the [[Independent Games Festival]] and the 'Excellence in Design' and 'Culture Award' categories at the [[Iran Computer and Video Games Foundation#Festivals and Exhibitions|Tehran Video Game Festival]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18746">'''EyesOn Design''' are a series of events including an annual [[car show]] and a [[fundraiser]] for the Detroit Institute of Ophthalmology. It has become a national event focused on the emotion and character of [[automotive design]].

== History ==
The Eyes on Design Show was established on the late-1986 as both celebration of [[automotive design]] and a fundraiser for the Detroit Institute of Ophthalmology, a [[nonprofit organization]] in [[Grosse Pointe Park, Michigan]], devoted to matters pertaining to the [[Ophthalmology|eye and vision]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.eyeson.org/index.php/eyeson/as-history |title=The History of the EyesOn Design Car Show in June at the Edsel &amp; Eleanor Ford House in Grosse Pointe |first=Philip C. |last=Hessburg |publisher=Detroit Institute of Ophthalmology |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130128132027/http://www.eyeson.org/index.php/eyeson/as-history |archivedate=28 January 2013 |accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url= http://www.3ds.com/company/news-media/press-releases-detail/release/dassault-systemes-continues-tradition-of-sponsoring-eyeson/single/2492/?cHash=52d09b3ccc0fc59eaa396693b0dd4e7b |title=Dassault Systèmes Continues Tradition of Sponsoring EyesOn Design Competition |date=8 January 2008 |publisher=Dassault Systèmes |accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first shows were called "Eyes On The Classics". The first shows were held in the [[Grosse Pointe Academy]] parking lots. Initially focused on the domestic "[[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|Big Three]]" ([[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[Chrysler LLC|Chrysler]]), the show was expanded to include automakers from around the world. The name was also changed to "EyesOn Design". For its third show, the venue moved to the grounds of the [[Edsel and Eleanor Ford House]].

To ease access and accommodate the increasing public attendance, the design chiefs at DaimlerChrysler, Ford, and General Motors suggested that the event be hosted by one of their companies each year.&lt;ref name="beauregard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.cardesignnews.com/features/2002/020715eyesondesign/index.html |title=Eyes on Design 2002 - A weekend of classic design |first=Marc |last=Beauregard |date=15 July 2002| publisher=Car Design News |accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2002 show was held at the [[Chrysler Headquarters and Technology Center]] in Auburn Hills, Michigan. The theme for this 15th anniversary weekend-long show was "Performance Vehicles".&lt;ref name="beauregard"/&gt;

In 2003, the [[General Motors Technical Center]] in Warren, Michigan hosted the event. According to [[General Motors]], the 2003 event was the largest, most complete collection of concept vehicles ever assembled representing the very best efforts of GM, Ford, Chrysler, and other automakers.&lt;ref name="gmpr03"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.gmeurope.info/social_media_newsroom/news/2003/news_030603b.html |title=Design Automotive Exhibit at the GM Technical Center |publisher=General Motors |date=6 March 2003 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120311212908/http://www.gmeurope.info/social_media_newsroom/news/2003/news_030603b.html |archivedate=11 March 2012 |accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three-day event was also the first time the GM Design Center was open to the general public.&lt;ref name="gmpr03"/&gt; Attendees also had the opportunity to purchase rides in notable GM [[concept car]]s.&lt;ref name="gmpr03"/&gt;

A Founding Chairman of the annual EyesOn Design event, Chuck Jordan, was commemorated during the January 2011 [[North American International Auto Show]] in Detroit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cardesignnews.com/site/home/rss_display/item214620/|title=2011 EyesOn Design Awards |first=Eric |last=Gallina |date=21 January 2011| publisher=Car Design News |accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EyesOn Design show celebrated its 25th anniversary during summer 2012, on the grounds of the Edsel and Eleanor Ford House with over 200 vehicles displayed by invitation only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.candgnews.com/news/eyeson-design-celebrates-25-years-visionary-vehicles |title=EyesOn Design celebrates 25 years of visionary vehicles |first=K. Michelle |last=Moran |publisher=C and G news |date=7 June 2012 |accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design focus ==
The "Eyes on Design Show" has grown from an East Side show to an automobile exhibition of national and international significance.&lt;ref name="wright"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://apps.detnews.com/apps/joyrides/index.php?id=408 |last=Wright |first=Richard A. |title=From modest beginnings, Eyes on Design is now a major show| newspaper=The Detroit News |date=7 July 2003 |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20120318005148/http://apps.detnews.com/apps/joyrides/index.php?id=408 |archivedate=18 March 2012 |accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Ford Motor Company]], the Eyes on Design Show is the world's only car show to focus on the emotion and character of automotive design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url= http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=8089 |title= Honorary Chairman Announced for 2001 Eyes On Design |date=20 April 2001 |publisher= Ford Motor |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121007092232/http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=8089 |archivedate=7 October 2012 |accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bringing together some 250 concept cars in one place is the secret of the show's success that has been driven by the enthusiastic assistance of automotive design executives.&lt;ref name="wright"/&gt; In addition to vehicles from various automakers, the event also features concept cars by invitation from some of the world's most renowned vintage automobile collectors and restorers.&lt;ref name="gmpr03"/&gt;

The vehicles shown at the annual event are by invitation. Judging in numerous classes is "based not on the quality of the restoration or authenticity"; rather it is on the basis of their "the design character, emotional appeal and artistic excellence of the vehicle."&lt;ref name="beauregard"/&gt;

== Lifetime Design Achievement ==
The EyesOn Design celebrations include the prestigious "Lifetime Design Achievement" award. This recognition is given to an accomplished automotive designer selected by previous winners of this award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.dbusiness.com/DBusiness/January-February-2010/EyesOn-Design-Celebrates-23-Years-with-the-Launch-of-its-2010-Season/ |title=EyesOn Design Celebrates 23 Years with the Launch of its 2010 Season |date=23 December 2009 |journal=dbusiness |accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Carl F. Eyring Science Center''' (ESC) is one of the science buildings on the [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU) campus in [[Provo, Utah]].  It was built in 1950 and named after [[Carl F. Eyring]] in 1954.

The ESC houses the departments of Physics and Astronomy, Geology, and Food Science and Nutrition.  The Department of Chemistry has in the past been located at the ESC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc=51304 | year=1991 | author1=Xie | first1=W.

In 1968 an underground physics research lab was added to the north end of the building.  Research on plasma, atomic processes, lasers, high-pressure physics, nanotechnology, [[acoustics]], and cold fusion have been conducted here. It is the home of two modern TEMs.

The [[Royden G. Derrick]] Planetarium is also in the building.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lds.org.uk/church_world_news.php?id=141&lt;/ref&gt; This 119-seat facility with a {{convert|39|ft|m|adj=on}} acoustically-treated dome was built in 2005 to replace the smaller, outdated Sarah Barrett Summerhays Planetarium.  In the summer of 2006 a new dome was installed on the ESC's observatory to better allow for astronomical study on campus. The building also has several acoustics labs including two [[anechoic chamber]]s and two [[reverberation chamber|reverberation chambers]] for performing acoustics research.

The 5th and 6th floors of the ESC constitute the [[Orson Pratt]] Observatory.&lt;ref&gt;http://astronomy.byu.edu/opo.php&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early years of the ESC, [[James A. Jensen]]'s dinosaur displays were often in the lobby.  However, since the building of the [[BYU Earth Science Museum]], dinosaur displays are less common.

The main lobby of the building is noted for its [[Foucault pendulum]].  It also houses a student-run restaurant, the Pendulum Court, during the fall and winter semesters.

The ESC was the first building at BYU to have an elevator.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10255">'''The Four Minute Men''' were a group of volunteers authorized by United States President [[Woodrow Wilson]], to give four-minute speeches on topics given to them by The [[Committee on Public Information]] (CPI). In 1917-1918, around 7,555,190 speeches were given in 5,200 communities&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Liberal-Fascism-American-Mussolini-Politics/dp/0767917189&lt;/ref&gt;. The topics dealt with the American war effort in the First World War and were presented during the four minutes between reels changing in movie theaters across the country. Also, the speeches were made to be four minutes so that they could be given at town meetings, restaurants, and other places that had an audience. This is an instance of "viral marketing" before its time.

== History==
{{Main|Presidency of Woodrow Wilson#Propaganda}}
On April, 6th 1917 the [[United States Congress|US Congress]] declared war on Germany. President Wilson was determined to rouse the public.

Wilson established the first modern propaganda office, the [[Committee on Public Information]] (CPI), headed by [[George Creel]].&lt;ref&gt;George Creel,  [https://archive.org/details/howweadvertameri00creerich ''How We Advertised America: The First Telling of the Amazing Story of the Committee on Public Information That Carried the Gospel of Americanism to Every Corner of the Globe.'' (1920)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Vaughn, ''Holding Fast the Inner Lines: Democracy, Nationalism, and the Committee on Public Information'' (1980). [https://www.questia.com/library/1664084/holding-fast-the-inner-lines-democracy-nationalism online]&lt;/ref&gt;  Creel set out to systematically reach every person in the United States multiple times with patriotic information about how the individual could contribute to the war effort. It also worked with the post office to censor seditious counter-propaganda.   Creel set up divisions in his new agency to produce and distribute innumerable copies of pamphlets, newspaper releases, magazine advertisements, films, school campaigns, and the speeches of the Four Minute Men.  CPI created colorful posters that appeared in every store window, catching the attention of the passersby for a few seconds.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine H. Adams, ''Progressive Politics and the Training of America’s Persuaders'' (1999) &lt;/ref&gt; Movie theaters were widely attended, and the CPI trained thousands of volunteer speakers to make patriotic appeals during the four-minute breaks needed to change reels.  They also spoke at churches, lodges, fraternal organizations, labor unions, and even logging camps. Speeches were mostly in English, but ethnic groups were reached in their own languages.

CPI Director [[George Creel]] boasted that in 18 months his 75,000 volunteers delivered over 7.5 million four minute orations to over 300 million listeners, in a nation of 103 million people.  The speakers attended training sessions through local universities, and were given pamphlets and speaking tips on a wide variety of topics, such as buying Liberty Bonds, registering for the draft, rationing food, recruiting unskilled workers for munitions jobs, and supporting Red Cross programs.  Ethnic groups were reached in their own languages.&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Mastrangelo,  "World War I, public intellectuals, and the Four Minute Men: Convergent ideals of public speaking and civic participation."

== Purpose==
With many millions of [[German Americans]] in the United States, as well as [[Irish Americans]] and [[Scandinavian Americans]] and poor rural Southerners, with strong isolationist feelings, there was a strong need for a [[propaganda]] campaign to stir support for the war. This effort had many unique challenges to meet to address the existing [[political climate]]. Wilson needed to speak directly to the fragmented and spread out audience in the United States.  He had to address the country's self-perception to generate support for the war. The Four-Minute Men provided an answer to these challenges.&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Mastrangelo,  "World War I, public intellectuals, and the Four Minute Men: Convergent ideals of public speaking and civic participation." ''Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs'' 12#4 (2009): 607-633.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the Four Minute Men urged citizens to purchase [[Liberty Bonds]] and Thrift Stamps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3qhRAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA796|title=The American Year Book: A Record of Events and Progress, Volume 1918|date=1919|publisher=T.

==Addressing challenges==
The Four Minute Men idea became a useful tool in the propaganda campaign because it addressed a specific [[rhetorical situation]]. One of the challenges of the effort was the fragmented audience of the United States. Many different heritages were represented in the United States, and the president needed their support for the war. To address each groups specific needs, the director of the Four Minute Men, William McCormick Blair, delegated the duty of speaking to local men. Well known and respected community figures often volunteered for the Four Minute Men program. This gave the speeches a local voice. Also, the four minute men were given general topics and talking points to follow and rotated between theaters to help the speeches seem fresh, instead of generic propaganda speeches.

These speeches usually celebrated Woodrow Wilson as a larger than life character and the Germans as less-than-human huns. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Liberal-Fascism-American-Mussolini-Politics/dp/0767917189&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
The four minute men was a division of the Committee on Public Information, headed by [[George Creel]]. The Committee on Public Information appointed William McCormick Blair as director of the Four Minute Men. Blair appointed state chairmen of the Four Minute Men, who then would appoint a city or community chairman. Each of these appointments needed to be approved in Washington. The local chairman would then appoint a number of speakers to cover the theaters in the city or community for which he is responsible.

{{for|the exclamation attributed to Archimedes|Eureka (word)}}
'''Heureka''' is a Finnish [[Science museum#Science_center|science center]] in [[Vantaa]], [[Finland]], north of [[Helsinki]], designed by [[Heikkinen – Komonen Architects]]. The aim of the science centre, which opened its doors to the public in 1989, is to popularize scientific information and to develop the methods used to teach science and scientific concepts. The name ‘Heureka’ (eureka in English) refers to the Greek exclamation, presumably uttered by Archimedes, to mean “I’ve found it!” (made a discovery). The Science Centre Heureka features both indoor and outdoor interactive exhibitions with exhibits that enable visitors to independently test different concepts and ideas. There is also a digital planetarium with 135 seats.

The Heureka Science Centre is a non-profit organization run by the Finnish Science Centre Foundation. The Finnish Science Centre Foundation is a broadly based co-operation organization that includes the Finnish scientific community, education sector, trade and industry, and national and local government. The ten background organisations of the Foundation support, develop and actively participate in the activities of Heureka. The foundation’s highest body is the Board of Trustees, whose decisions are implemented by the Governing Board. Everyday activities are the responsibility of Heureka’s Director assisted by a management team and other staff.

==History==
[[File:Vantaa-heureka.jpg|thumb|320px|The Heureka science center]]
The roots of the Finnish Science Centre Heureka can be traced back to the University of Helsinki and scientists, who had become acquainted with different science centres located around the world. The initial spark was lit by Adjunct Professors Tapio Markkanen, Hannu I. Miettinen and Heikki Oja. It all began with the Physics 82 exhibition held at the [[House of the Estates]] in Helsinki on 20–26 May 1982. During autumn of that same year, the science centre project was launched with the initial support of the Academy of Finland, the Ministry of Education, and various foundations. The project led to the establishment of the Finnish Science Centre Foundation during 1983-1984. The original founding members of the foundation included the University of Helsinki, the Helsinki University of Technology, the Federation of Finnish Learned Societies, and the Confederation of Industries.

In 1984, the City of Vantaa offered to be the host city and partial financier for the Science Centre, and also designated a property lot located in the southern end of Tikkurila as the future site of the centre. An architectural competition, held in 1985, turned out two first prizes from which the winning design was selected; namely the “Heureka” design submitted by Mikko Heikkinen, Markku Komonen and Lauri Anttila. That's how the Finnish Science Centre Heureka got its apt name!
Before the building was completed, a number of test exhibitions were set up at other sites. The interior plan for the Science Centre was completed in 1986. The foundation for the building was laid in October 1987, and the construction work was completed one year later. The overall area of the building is 8,200 m2, of which 2,800 m2 is exhibition space. The Finnish Science Centre Heureka opened its doors to the public on 28 April 1989.

==Exhibitions and planetarium==
[[File:Cubes at Heureka, optical illusion.jpg|thumb|The symbol of Heureka, ''Neljä kuutiota'' ("Four cubes"), is an optical illusion appearing to be a group of cubes]]

===Interior of the building===

The main exhibition hall houses about 200 exhibits related to different fields of science. The main exhibition was renewed completely in 1999, but there are small changes taking place in the main exhibition hall each year as well. The topics include, for example, digestion and the functions of the intestines, the production of money and traffic. The exhibition ‘The Wind in the Bowels’ has been designed in co-operation with the Finnish Medical Society Duodecim.  The exhibition ‘About a Coin’ was implemented through collaboration with the Mint of Finland to mark the company’s 150th anniversary.

As an extension of the main exhibition, the Heureka Classics exhibition was opened in 2009 in honour of Heureka’s 20th anniversary. From the beginning of August 2009, Heureka has also had the Science on a Sphere exhibit on display. 

In addition to the main exhibition, Heureka generally also houses two temporary exhibitions. The topics of past temporary exhibitions have included, for example, dinosaurs, humans, sports, forests, the art of film, flying and ancient cultures. Since Heureka’s opening, the most successful exhibitions have been the dinosaur exhibitions. The 2001 exhibition about the family life of dinosaurs, for example, attracted 406,000 visitors. Many of the exhibitions independently produced by Heureka have made guest appearances in numerous science centres all over the world. Heureka also features exhibitions imported from abroad.

===Outdoor areas===

Heureka’s outdoor exhibition area, Science Park Galilei, opened in 2002. This area of the centre can be visited annually during the summer season. Galilei is a sort of “scientific playground”. The 7,500 m2 area holds dozens of exhibits, many of which feature water as the primary element. The exhibits are based on mathematical, physical and musical phenomena. The outdoor park also contains moving works of art, such as the sand plotter created by well-known Finnish artist Osmo Valtonen. Galilei also features an arboretum with species of conifers from the northern hemisphere.

The area in front of Heureka features a permanent bedrock exhibition, which contains both common and rare types of rocks found in Finland’s bedrock. The rocks are situated to reflect their distribution throughout different geographical provinces of Finland. Leading up to the front entrance, visitors are also greeted by perennial gardens that were planted in accordance with the historical classification system designed by Carolus Linnaeus. The front of the entrance is tiled in [[Penrose tiling]].

===Heureka’s planetarium===

The hemispheric-shaped planetarium primarily presents films dealing with astronomy. Until 2007, the theatre was called the Verne Theatre, and it ran super films and multimedia programmes made with special slide projectors that took advantage of the entire 500 m2 surface of the hemispheric screen. At the end of 2007, the theatre was entirely renovated, and reopened on 26 December 2007 as one of Europe’s most modern digital planetariums. There are altogether 135 seats in Heureka’s planetarium.

===Other daily programmes===

In addition to the exhibitions and planetarium films, Heureka also offers the opportunity to view daily science theatre shows, to participate in supervised programmes and to watch Rat Basketball games. Furthermore, a number of other individual events, such as Science Days, science holidays and science camps in the summer are organised at Heureka. Public lectures with different themes are also regularly held in Heureka’s auditorium. Public lectures are given in the planetarium as well. Other services at Heureka include a science shop and a restaurant, as well as conference facilities and a 220-seat auditorium for meetings.

==Facts about Heureka==

===Visitors===

From 1989 to 2011, an average of about 280,000 people has visited Heureka each year. The total number of visitors exceeded six million in May 2010. Altogether more than 22 million people have viewed Heureka’s exhibitions on display both in Finland and abroad.
Of the average 280,000 people who visit Heureka each year, more than half represent families, one fourth school students, about 10% are corporate visits, and the rest are individual visitors. About 6-10% of the visitors arrive from abroad, with the highest percentage coming from Russia and Estonia. The number of visitors is affected by, for example, the general economic situation, the weather and the excursion funds available to school groups.

===The Finnish Science Centre Foundation and funding===

Heureka is run by the Finnish Science Centre Foundation, whose original members include the University of Helsinki, the Helsinki University of Technology (nowadays Aalto University), the Federation of Finnish Learned Societies, and the Confederation of Industries (nowadays Confederation of Finnish Industries, EK), the City of Vantaa, the Ministry of Education (nowadays Ministry of Education and Culture), the Ministry of Trade and Industry (nowadays Ministry of Employment and the Economy), the Ministry of Finance, the Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions (SAK), and the Trade Union of Education in Finland (OAJ).

Heureka’s funding is provided through subsidies from the City of Vantaa and the Ministry of Education and Culture, as well as through its own operational revenue: admission and rental fees, fundraising and exhibition export. Heureka’s overall funding is approximately nine million euro, of which the revenue from own operations was 48% in 2011. The share of the funding provided by the City of Vantaa and the Ministry of Education and Culture was altogether 52% in 2011. The public support is notably less than for many other cultural institutions. Part of the funding also comes through corporate co-operation. The temporary exhibitions are often sponsored by main partners and other partners. Heureka also has two companies owned entirely by the Foundation, namely the Science Shop Magneetti Oy, which runs the Heureka Shop at Heureka and at the Kamppi Shopping Centre in central Helsinki, and Heureka Overseas Productions Oy Ltd, which manages the export activities of Heureka.

===Other===

At the end of 2014, the Foundation had a staff of 68 full-time salaried employees and 32 part-time or fixed-term employees. The total number of person-years was 77. Additionally 7 206 hours were carried out by volunteers. There have been volunteers in Heureka since 1998, and there are currently about 60-70 volunteers in the service of Heureka.

The center is a member of three associations of science centers:
*ASTC ([[Association of Science-Technology Centers]])
*ECSITE ([[The European Collaborative for Science, Industry and Technology]])
*NSCF ([[Nordic Science Centre Association|Nordisk Science Centerförbundet]])

'''hprints''' ([[pronunciation|pronounced]] in [[English language|English]] as '''aitch prints''') is an [[archive]] for electronic [[preprint]]s of academic papers in the fields of [[humanities|arts and humanities]]. It can be accessed freely via the [[Internet]] since it is an [[open access]] [[repository (publishing)|repository]] aiming at making scholarly documents publicly available to the widest possible audience.

==The hprints project==
The aim of hprints is to make [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] research available through an open access online electronic full text archive, but the limitation to Nordic countries is claimed to be mainly an initial restriction for funding reasons. The archive will primarily contain electronic research documents in the form of preprints, reprints, working papers, book chapters, conference reports, invited lecture manuscripts etc. The archive is set up, maintained and promoted by [[Copenhagen University]] Library and consortium members. The consortium original members were:
* [[Copenhagen University]] Library, part of the [[Danish Royal Library]])
* The Faculty of Humanities, at [[Copenhagen University]]
* [[Lund University]] Library
* [[Museum Tusculanum Press]], an academic publisher
* [[University of Oslo]] Library
Submissions of electronic text material to the archive is decentral and take place at the local individual researcher, or research group level.

==Using hprints==
Hence hprints is a tool for scientific communication between academic scholars, who can upload full-text research material such as articles, papers, conference papers, book chapters etc. The content of the deposited material should be comparable to that of a scientific paper that a scholar would consider suitable for publication in for example a peer reviewed scientific journal.

It is possible to search and find the paper by defined topics through an Internet search. Secondly, all submitted papers are stored permanently and receive a stable web address, as for example the paper in this example:

 Pietism and the politics of catechisms

 http://www.hprints.org/hprints-00254947/en/

==History==
May 2007 the Nordic funding agency for libraries, [[Nordbib]], granted the hprints project 287,000 DKK as part of its financing programme ''Work Package 2: Focus area on Content and Accessibility''. The plan was to launch an archive one year from this date i.e. approximately June 2008: The hprints project wishes to provide a policy and a technical infrastructure that permits [[open access]] to research within the arts and humanities. The assumption was that this will result in a number of advantages with respect to the electronic accessibility and visibility of the arts and humanities research area.

October 2007, the Advisory Board of the [[Nordbib]] "hprints project" chose the system to be used for the Nordic arts and humanities e-print archive. Three possible alternatives existed: [[EPrints]] from the [[University of Southampton]], LUR from [[Lund University]] Libraries, and [[Hyper Articles en Ligne|HAL]] from the French national research council (CNRS). Both EPrints and LUR are free [[Open-source software|open source]] software that can be set up locally  or hosted commercially, while HAL is a functioning archive, to which portals can be set up.

At the hprints Advisory Board meeting in October, it was decided to collaborate with the French research council, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS). Hence, the hprints e-print archive for Nordic arts and humanities is set up as a [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] HAL portal with its own layout and adapted to the requirements of hprints.

March 2008 hprints opened for public access. Since the archive is a part of HAL and  papers will be shared with the French national archive.

'''Immunopathology''' is a branch of medicine that deals with immune responses associated with disease.  It includes the study of the pathology of an [[organism]], [[organ system]], or disease with respect to the [[immune system]], immunity, and immune responses. In biology, it refers to damage caused to an organism by its own immune response, as a result of an infection. It could be due to mismatch between pathogen and host species, and often occurs when an animal pathogen infects a human (e.g. [[avian flu]] leads to a [[cytokine storm]] which contributes to the increased mortality rate).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Us|first1=Dürdal|title=[Cytokine storm in avian influenza]|journal=Mikrobiyoloji Bulteni|date=1 April 2008|volume=42|issue=2|pages=365–380|issn=0374-9096|pmid=18697437}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

When a foreign antigen enters the body, there is either an antigen specific or nonspecific response to it. These responses are the immune system fighting off the foreign antigens, whether they are deadly or not. Immunopathology could refer to how the foreign antigens cause the immune system to have a response or problems that can arise from an organism’s own immune response on itself. There are certain problems or faults in the immune system that can lead to more serious illness or disease. These diseases can come from one of the following problems. The first would be Hypersensitivity reactions, where there would be a stronger immune response than normal. There are four different types (type one, two, three and four), all with varying types and degrees of an immune response. The problems that arise from each type vary from small allergic reactions to more serious illnesses such as tuberculosis or arthritis. The second kind of complication in the immune system is Autoimmunity, where the immune system would attack itself rather than the antigen. Inflammation is a prime example of autoimmunity, as the immune cells used are self-reactive. A few examples of autoimmune diseases are Type 1 diabetes, Addison’s disease and Celiac disease. The third and final type of complication with the immune system is Immunodeficiency, where the immune system lacks the ability to fight off a certain disease. The immune system’s ability to combat it is either hindered or completely absent. The two types are Primary Immunodeficiency, where the immune system is either missing a key component or does not function properly, and Secondary Immunodeficiency, where disease is obtained from an outside source, like radiation or heat, and therefore cannot function properly. Diseases that can cause immunodeficiency include HIV, AIDS and leukemia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1710-1492-7-S1-S1|title=An introduction to immunology and immunopathology|first1=Richard|last1=Warrington|first2=Wade|last2=Watson|first3=Harold L.|last3=Kim|first4=Francesca Romana|last4=Antonetti|date=1 January 2011|publisher=|journal=Allergy, Asthma &amp; Clinical Immunology|volume=7|issue=1|pages=S1|via=BioMed Central|doi=10.1186/1710-1492-7-S1-S1|pmid=22165815|pmc=3245432}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Warrington|first1=Richard|title=An introduction to immunology and immunopathology|url=http://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1710-1492-7-S1-S1|website=BioMed Central|publisher=Warrington et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In all vertebrates, there are two different kinds of immune responses: Innate and Adaptive immunity. Innate immunity is used to fight off non-changing antigens and is therefore considered nonspecific. It is usually a more immediate response than the adaptive immune system, usually responding within minutes to hours.&lt;ref&gt;Warrington, Richard''. [http://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1710-1492-7-S1-S1 "An introduction to immunology and immunopathology"].'' BioMed Central. Warrington et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; It is composed of physical blockades such as the skin, but also contains nonspecific immune cells such as dendritic cells, macrophages, T Cells, and basophils. The second for of immunity is Adaptive immunity. This form of immunity requires recognition of the foreign antigen before a response is produced. Once the antigen is recognized, a specific response is produced in order to destroy the specific antigen. Because of this idea, adaptive immunity is considered to be specific immunity. A key part of adaptive immunity that separates it from innate is the use of memory to combat the antigen in the future. When the antigen is originally introduced, the organism does not have any receptors for the antigen so it must generate them from the first time the antigen is present. The immune system then builds a memory of that antigen, which enables it to recognize the antigen quicker in the future and be able to combat it quicker and more efficiently. The more the system is exposed to the antigen, the quicker it will build up its responsiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Iwasaki A., Medzhitov R. | year = 2010 | title = Regulation of Adaptive Immunity by the Innate Immune System | url = | journal = Science | volume = 327 | issue = 5963| pages = 291–95 | doi=10.1126/science.1183021| pmc = 3645875}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7526">The '''Indices of deprivation 2004''' ('''ID 2004''') is a [[deprivation index]] at the small [[area]] level, created by the British [[Department for Communities and Local Government]](DCLG).

It is unusual in its inclusion of a measure of geographical access as an element of deprivation and in its direct measure of [[poverty]] (through data on benefit receipts). The ID 2004 is based on the idea of distinct dimensions of deprivation which can be recognised and measured separately. These are then combined into a single overall measure. The Index is made up of seven distinct dimensions of deprivation called Domain Indices. Whilst it is known as the ID2004, most of the data actually dates from 2001.

==History==
Communities and Local Government (previously the Office of Deputy Prime Minister) commissioned the Social Disadvantage Research Centre (SDRC) at the Department of Social Policy and Social Work at the University of Oxford to update the Indices of  deprivation 2004 (ID 2004) for England. Following an extensive public consultation (see Annex A), an independent academic peer review and a significant programme of work, the new Indices of Deprivation 2007 were produced in December 2007.

The new Index of Multiple Deprivation 2007 (IMD 2007) is a Lower layer Super Output Area (LSOA) level measure of multiple deprivation, and is made up of seven LSOA level domain indices. There are also two supplementary indices (Income Deprivation Affecting Children and Income Deprivation Affecting Older People). Summary measures of the IMD 2007 are presented at local authority district level and county council level. The LSOA level Domain Indices and IMD 2007, together with the local authority district and county summaries are referred to as the Indices of Deprivation 2007 (ID 2007).(Rusty 2009)

The ID 2007 are based on the approach, structure and methodology that were used to create the previous ID 2004. The ID 2007 updates the ID 2004 using more up-to-date data. The new IMD 2007 contains seven domains which relate to income deprivation, employment deprivation, health deprivation and disability, education skills and training deprivation, barriers to housing and services, living environment deprivation, and crime.

==Domain Indices==

*'''Income'''

:The purpose of this Domain is to capture the proportions of the population experiencing income deprivation in an area. 
*'''Employment'''

:This Domain measures employment deprivation by considering people of working age who are involuntarily excluded from the world of work, either through unemployment. ill health or family circumstances. 

*'''Health and disability'''

:This Domain identifies areas with relatively high rates of people who die prematurely or whose quality of life is impaired by poor health or who are disabled, across the whole population. 

*'''Education, skills and training'''

:The purpose of the Domain is to capture the extent of deprivation in education, skills and training in a local area. The indicators fall into two sub-domains: one relating to lack of attainment among children and young people and one relating to lack of qualifications in terms of skills. These two sub-domains are designed to reflect the ‘flow’ and ‘stock’ of educational disadvantage within an area respectively. That is, the children/young people sub-domain measures the deprivation in the attaining of qualifications, while the skills sub-domain measures the deprivation in the resident working age adult population. 

*'''Barriers to Housing and Services'''

:The purpose of this Domain is to measure barriers to housing and key local services. The indicators fall into two sub-domains: ‘geographical barriers’ and ‘wider barriers’ which includes issues relating to access to housing such as affordability. 

*'''Living environment'''

:This Domain focuses on deprivation in the living environment. It comprises two sub-domains: the ‘indoors’ living environment which measures the quality of housing and the ‘outdoors’ living environment which contains two measures about air quality and road traffic accidents. 

*'''Crime'''

:This Domain measures the rate of recorded crime for four major crime themes – burglary, theft, criminal damage and violence - representing the occurrence of personal and material victimisation at a small area level.

Each Domain contains a number of indicators, totalling 37. Two supplementary indexes have been created as a subset of the Income domain. These relate to income deprivation affecting children and income deprivation affecting older people.

==Geography==

The Indices of deprivation 2004 are measured at the Lower Layer Super Output Area level. [[Super Output Areas]] were developed by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) from the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|Census 2001]] Output Areas. There are two levels, the lowest (which the Index is based upon) being smaller than wards and containing a minimum of 1,000 people and 400 households. The middle layer contains a minimum of 5,000 people and 2,000 households. Earlier proposals to introduce Upper Layer Super Output Areas were dropped due to lack of demand. 

In addition to Super Output Areas, Summaries of the ID 2004 are presented at District level, County level and Primary Care Trust (PCT) level.

While each SOA is of higher resolution than the highest resolution ''ward'' index data of the IMD2000 and therefore better at identifying "pockets" of deprivation within wards the 2004 system has its problems. Some areas of deprivation can still be hidden because of the size of SOAs. Examples of this can be found by comparing central areas of [[Keighley]] using the Bradford District Deprivation Index (a [[Deprivation index]] developed by [[City of Bradford|Bradford Council]] produced at 1991 Census [[Enumeration District]] level) with the ID2004.
Additionally SOAs were tasked with providing complete coverage of England and Wales - this combined with the minimum population and household counts within each SOA means that large areas of agricultural, commercial and industrial land have to be included within a residential area that borders them - thus when some very deprived residential areas are mapped, a large area of supposed deprivation emerges, however most of it may not be so but rather has a wide area of relative affluence around it - these can appear to be a greater problem than many smaller completely residential SOAs in which higher concentrations of deprived people live but mixed with more affluent neighbours.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8251">{{short description|A non-profit organisation that promotes interdisciplinary, international studies in the research of oceanic spreading centres}}
'''InterRidge''' is a non-profit organisation that promotes interdisciplinary, international studies in the research of oceanic spreading centres, including mid-ocean ridge and back-arc basin systems. It does so by creating a global research community, planning and coordinating new science programmes that no single nation can achieve alone, exchanging scientific information, and sharing new technologies and facilities. InterRidge is dedicated to reaching out to the public, scientists and governments, and to providing a unified voice for ocean ridge researchers worldwide.

It was launched in 1992, and in 2011 InterRidge has 6 principal, 3 associate, and 21 corresponding member nations and regions. InterRidge has more than 2500 individual member scientists in disciplines ranging from marine geology to chemistry, biology, and ocean engineering.

The InterRidge Office rotates every 3 years. During 2013-2015, InterRidge is being hosted by the [http://geophy.pku.edu.cn/itag/en/ Institute of Theoretical and Applied Geophysics], [[Peking University]], Beijing, China. InterRidge is governed by a steering committee consisting of delegates from the principal and associate member nations and regions.

== Main functions ==

InterRidge has [http://www.interridge.org/4mainfunctions four main functions], which may be summarised as: 
# Building a community of ridge scientists
# Identifying important scientific questions through working groups and workshops
# Acting as a voice for ridge scientists
# Education and outreach.

InterRidge serves as a "clearinghouse" for information on mid-ocean ridge research across the globe. InterRidge publishes an [http://www.interridge.org/IRNewsletter annual newsletter] with preliminary results from field work, national and regional reports, and working group updates. InterRidge maintains 3 databases:
*[http://www.interridge.org/en/members member database]
*[http://www.interridge.org/IRcruise research cruise database] (past and upcoming cruises to the ridge crest)
*[http://www.interridge.org/irvents/ database of active hydrothermal vent fields]

==Development==

=== First decade ===

InterRidge began at a meeting in France in 1990 that gathered ridge scientists from 10 nations and regions with reports submitted by Canada, France, Iceland, Japan, Portugal, USSR, UK, and USA. The rationale for this meeting developed from a recommendation at a previous U.S. RIDGE initiative workshop that an international initiative be pursued. Following the first InterRidge meeting, an "Interim Steering Group" was formed and the first programme plan was produced in 1992.

As stated on the InterRidge website, the first decade (1992-2003) of the organisation "produced a coordinated, international ridge community of member countries that had previously been working alone, and left a string of success stories in its wake. Two examples are the first-ever mapping and sampling of one of the slowest spreading and remote centres known to date, the Gakkel Ridge&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/details.php?id=319 |title=IPY: International Polar Year |publisher=Classic.ipy.org |date= |accessdate=2011-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Arctic Ocean, and the exploration and study of the Southwest Indian Ridge."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.whoi.edu/science/GG/interridge/oldIR/SCIENCE/Historic_WG/SWIRWG.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second decade&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ir-china.geophy.pku.edu.cn/english/interridge/about.htm |title=Interridge |publisher=Ir-china.geophy.pku.edu.cn |date=2000-09-30 |accessdate=2011-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;===

Two functions of InterRidge were developed more fully in the second decade (2004-2013) of the organisation:
# The scientific working groups
# Education and outreach

Scientific working groups are a key metric for success as to how InterRidge is delivering on its mission. These working groups are proposed by an international group of scientists, usually following a call for proposals issued by the InterRidge Office.  Working groups in 2011 are Hydrothermal Energy and Ocean Carbon Cycles, Long-Range Exploration, Mantle Imaging,  Seafloor Mineralisation, and Vent Ecology.

In 2008, InterRidge began offering fellowships for student research projects, and in 2009 InterRidge began a partnership with the International Seabed Authority Endowment Fund to expand the programme into the [http://www.interridge.org/en/fellowship InterRidge Student and Postdoctoral Fellowship Programme].

In 2011, InterRidge began a [http://www.interridge.org/en/cruisebursary "Cruise Travel Bursary"] scheme to enable early-career scientists to participate in research cruises.

==Associated research==

In 2009, scientists from USA, Japan and the UK laid the foundations for finding the deepest-ever hydrothermal vents, in a research cruise to the Mid-Cayman Rise, in April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18759-first-footage-from-worlds-deepest-volcanic-vents.html |title=First footage from world's deepest volcanic vents - life - 12 April 2010 |publisher=New Scientist |date= |accessdate=2011-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ridge-crest scientists are also exploring the East Scotia Ridge in the Southern Ocean, part of a 3-year programme,&lt;ref&gt;[http://wayback.vefsafn.is/wayback/20100417011621/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/science/earth-environment/article6863801.ece ]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the Russian branch of InterRidge which has studied hydrothermal clusters along part of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/j066238352572x96/ |title=Geochemistry International, Volume 44, Number 4 |publisher=SpringerLink |date= |accessdate=2011-02-03 |doi=10.1134/S0016702906040082 |volume=44 |journal=Geochemistry International |pages=419–421}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As economic growth puts pressure on resources, new sources of minerals and materials are needed, and licences are being sought for the exploration of seafloor massive sulphides. InterRidge coordinates neutral scientific input to these discussions.&lt;ref&gt;http://s3.amazonaws.com/files.posterous.com/jeanraymondboulle/pznhCLByqoT7XLFy4znWtlJNrgmgBaRwTBz3Jn5hjMdN9P5E9C6nI5ThTVYQ/SMS_Deposits.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=1C9REJR1EMRZ83Q7QRG2&amp;Expires=1296565595&amp;Signature=D83wWyBCEGzUBOiUnoFkzZ0GzIE%3D&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interactions with international organisations ==
InterRidge is an affiliated program to [http://www.scor-int.org/coop.htm SCOR] (Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research), has a liaison to [http://www.iodp.org/index.php IODP] (Integrated Ocean Drilling Program), and is in close communication with other organizations such as [https://web.archive.org/web/20110210102637/http://www.noc.soton.ac.uk/chess/ ChEss] (Chemosynthetic Ecosystem science), a field project of the [http://www.coml.org/ Census of Marine Life] programme (CoML).

==Code of conduct==

Starting in 2000 with a workshop on "Management and Conservation of Hydrothermal Vent Ecosystems," the InterRidge Biology Working Group developed a set of six guidelines which was published in 2006 as "Responsible Science at Hydrothermal Vents".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tos.org/oceanography/issues/issue_archive/issue_pdfs/20_1/20.1_devey_et_al.pdf Responsible Science at Hydrothermal Vents."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723054816/http://www.tos.org/oceanography/issues/issue_archive/issue_pdfs/20_1/20.1_devey_et_al.pdf |date=2011-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2011, 180 people had signed to support this statement.

'''Iran computer and video games foundation''' ''(AKA Iran National Foundation of Computer Games or shortly IRCG)'' is a [[non-profit]], [[Semi-government]]al organization established in 2007 to control and support video game industry in Iran.

Iran computer and video games foundation is responsible for publishing and releasing any kind of [[video game]]s (including PC games and mobile games), supporting local game manufacturers, instructing students in video game development and organize, control and monitor the activities of [[LAN gaming center]]s in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.heraldboy.com/irans-national-foundation-of-computer-games-to-organize-game-centers/242/|title=Iran's National Foundation of Computer Games to Organize Game Centers  –  Herald Boy|website=www.heraldboy.com|access-date=2016-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IRCG is also responsible for banning foreign video games that are not compatible with Iran’s governmental political views and filtering video game’s websites that they might not meet the governmental rules of Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tehrantimes.com/news/300689/Iran-plans-to-block-websites-offering-1979-Revolution|title=Iran plans to block websites offering "1979 Revolution"|date=2016-04-17|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/pc-game-1979-revolution-black-friday-banned-iran-accused-hostile-intentions-1564600|title=Acclaimed PC game banned in Iran due to "hostile intentions"|date=2016-06-09|access-date=2016-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kate Harvey''' (13 November 1862 – 29 April 1946) was an [[England|English]] suffragist, [[physiotherapist]], and charity worker. Profoundly [[deaf]] and widowed at a young age, she operated a home for women and children, and then later for disabled children. She participated in the [[Women's Tax Resistance League]] and was jailed for her refusal to pay tax if she were not allowed the right to vote. She was the first person imprisoned for failure to pay a tax under the Insurance Act.

==Early life==
Felicia Catherine Glanvill was born on November the 13th, 1862 in [[Peckham]], London.&lt;ref&gt;Doreen A. Woodford, 'A Deaf Fighter for the Rights of Women.' Deaf History Journal, Vol.2 (3) p.7-21)&lt;/ref&gt; She married Frank Harvey and had three daughters, before she was widowed.{{sfn|Wojtczak|2008|p=257-258}}{{sfn|English Births|1892}} She operated a home in her residence in [[Bromley]] for disabled children and was an early practitioner of physical therapy, at a time when [[Victorian era|Victorian society]] frowned upon women working in medicine, especially in a field which used physical contact.{{sfn|Vallely|2005}} 

==Suffrage==
Harvey joined the [[Women's Freedom League|Women's Freedom League (WFL)]]’s Bromley branch and by 1910 was one of the leading members of the organization.{{sfn|Crawford|2013|p=194}} She met and became close friends with [[Charlotte Despard]], another widow involved in charitable works, who operated a home for the poor in [[Wandsworth]]. The exact nature of their relationship is unknown, but Despard recorded in her diary that "the anniversary of our love" began on 12 January 1912.{{sfn|Vallely|2005}} Harvey organized the suffrage march which took place in June 1911 as part of the [[Women's Coronation Procession]] for [[George V]]. Despard, who was president of the WFL, led the suffrage march.{{sfn|Dixon|2003|p=1861}}

As early as 1911 Harvey,{{sfn|Eustance|1993|p=177}}{{sfn|''The Vote''|1911|p=105}} who had become a member of the [[Women's Tax Resistance League]], engaged in a protracted battle with the Kent County Council for refusal to pay a stamp tax to obtain a license for her gardener.{{sfn|Vallely|2005}} ''The Vote'', the press organ of the WFL gave constant coverage of the conflict over the next two years.{{sfn|Eustance|1993|p=177}} After several months, a warrant was issued for Harvey's arrest and she barricaded herself in her home.{{sfn|Vallely|2005}}{{sfn|''The Guardian''|1913|p=7}} Refusing to pay taxes without having the ability to vote for her representation,{{sfn|''The Vote''|1912|p=231}} after eight months, the barricade was broken and some of her property was seized in lieu of payment of the tax. A year later, having built stronger barricades and still refusing to pay, bailiffs broke through using a battering ram.{{sfn|Vallely|2005}} Harvey was arrested and taken to the Bromley Police Court in August 1913, where she was ordered to pay fines under the Insurance Act. She refused to pay and was sentenced to serve two months in [[HM Prison Holloway|Holloway Prison]].{{sfn|''The Times''|1913|p=4}} She was the first person sentenced under the Insurance Act, though two other suffragists had been imprisoned for failure to pay taxes in previous years{{sfn|''The Guardian''|1913|p=7}} for such things as dog licenses, carriage duties and inhabitant taxes.{{sfn|Eustance|1993|p=177}} Protests to her arrest, attended by both men and women, cited the inequity of her fines being much higher than those imposed upon men for the same offence.{{sfn|''The Guardian''|1913|p=7}} After serving only one month of her sentence, Harvey was released because of concerns for her health.{{sfn|Vallely|2005}} In November, authorities attempted to auction her belongings to pay her fines, but were forced to close the sale when no bids were made.{{sfn|''The Observer''|1913|p=14}} She was awarded a medal from suffragists depicting the entry of Holloway Prison.{{sfn|Wojtczak|2008|p=257-258}}{{sfn|Vallely|2005}}

During the war, most suffragists suspended the campaign for enfranchisement, but Harvey and Despard, continued to press for reform and were ardent pacifists, speaking against war.{{sfn|Vallely|2005}} The pair attended the [[Seventh Conference of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance|Seventh Conference]] of the [[International Woman Suffrage Alliance]] in [[Budapest]] and were interested in promoting the international feminist movement.{{sfn|Eustance|1993|p=247}} Both were also involved in the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] movement, believing that moral and spiritual development of the individual would result in societal change.{{sfn|Eustance|1993|p=205}} Harvey was described as "intensely pious" and conducted religious instruction for the children in her care in a chapel she built in her home.{{sfn|Wojtczak|2008|p=257-258}} In 1916, Harvey and Despard bought a large house together, along with two cottages and a wood shed on twelve acres of land in [[Upper Hartfield]] at the edge of the [[Ashdown Forest]]. Naming the facility "Kurundai", they created a thirty-one-bed hospital for women and children.{{sfn|Wojtczak|2008|p=257-258}} Though initially Despard paid expenses for some of the hospital patients,{{sfn|Vallely|2005}} in 1917, the [[Theosophical Society]] became involved and the home was renamed as the Brackenhill Theosophical Home School. It housed children from broken homes, illegitimate children, as well as those who were sick or disabled and was directed by Harvey.{{sfn|Dixon|2003|p=5}} In 1920, the Theosophical Society withdrew their support and moved the Theosophical Home School to the Old Rectory in [[Letchworth]]{{sfn|McNab|2014|p=17}} but Harvey continued operating the facility at Kurundai.{{#tag:ref|The naming is confusing as there were two facilities with this name. Brackenhill's name apparently followed the school supported by the Theosophical Society, which later became [[St Christopher School, Letchworth]]. In 1925 a decision was made to close the theosophical school and use the facility to house the faculty for St. Christopher. When Harvey resumed directorship of her property in 1928, she called her boarding school the Brackenhill Open Air Home School, which had no relationship to the earlier organization.{{sfn|Baigent|Cursons|2015}}|group="Notes"}} In 1921, Harvey and Despard split up after nine years together when Despard moved to Ireland.{{sfn|Vallely|2005}} Harvey maintained sole ownership of the facility, but between 1923 and 1928 it was operated by the Invalid Children’s Aid Association as a convalescent center for children who had [[rheumatic diseases]] and she moved to a house near the facility known as "Wroth Tyes".{{sfn|Wojtczak|2008|p=257-258}}

In 1928, Harvey took over management again and converted Kurundai to a [[boarding school]], which she called Brackenhill Open Air Home School.{{sfn|Wojtczak|2008|p=257-258}}{{sfn|Baigent|Cursons|2015}} An open-air, facility, she focused on vegetarianism and physical exercise, providing the children with a "natural" life where they slept in the open air in shuttered shelters. The sides of the roofed dwellings only were shuttered in extremely poor weather. She continued to live at Wroth Tyes with the headmistress of the school, Helen Smith. The two women operated the school until the advent of the [[WWII|Second World War]], when the government repurposed the estate for the war effort.{{sfn|Wojtczak|2008|p=257-258}}

==Death and legacy==
Harvey died at Wroth Tyes, in [[Hartfield]], [[East Sussex]], England on 29 April 1946 and left the Brackenhill property to Smith.{{sfn|Wojtczak|2008|p=257-258}}{{sfn|''The London Gazette''|1946|p=4615}} In 2005, Harvey's suffragette medal was auctioned by [[Bonhams]] bringing £840 and renewed interest in the suffragette.{{sfn|Vallely|2005}}

'''Leibniz's gap''' is a [[philosophy of mind]] term that is used to refer to the problem that thoughts cannot be observed or perceived solely by examining [[brain]] properties, events, and processes. Here the word 'gap' is a [[metaphor]] of a subquestion regarding the [[mind–body problem]] that allegedly must be answered in order to reach more profound understanding of [[consciousness]] and [[emergence]]. A [[theory]] that could correlate brain phenomena with [[Psychology|psychological]] phenomena would "bridge the gap." The term is named after [[Gottfried Leibniz]] who first presented the problem in his work ''[[The Monadology]]'' in 1714. Leibniz's passage describing the gap goes as follows:

{{cquote|It must be confessed, moreover, that perception, and that which depends on it, are inexplicable by mechanical causes, that is, by figures and motions, And, supposing that there were a mechanism so constructed as to think, feel and have perception, we might enter it as into a mill. And this granted, we should only find on visiting it, pieces which push one against another, but never anything by which to explain a perception. This must be sought, therefore, in the simple substance, and not in the composite or in the machine.|author=Gottfried Leibniz|source=[http://people.uvawise.edu/philosophy/phil206/Leibniz.html ''Monadology'']}}

Leibniz himself sought to bridge the gap by introducing monads to explain the existence of immaterial, eternal souls. Leibniz's gap, however, applies to [[materialism]] and [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]] alike. This brought late 19th century scientists to conclude that psychology must build on [[introspection]]; thus [[introspectionism]] was born. [[Computationalism]] seeks to answer the problem proposed by Leibniz's gap through functional analysis of the brain and its processes. Today the term Leibniz's gap is still in wide use in scientific debate as the mind body problem remains unsolved.

'''''Living Witchcraft: A Contemporary American Coven''''' is a [[sociology|sociological]] study of an American [[coven]] of [[Wicca]]ns who operated in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] during the early 1990s. It was co-written by the sociologist Allen Scarboro, psychologist Nancy Campbell and literary critic Shirley Stave and first published by [[Praeger Publishers|Praeger]] in 1994. Although largely sociological, the study was interdisciplinary, and included both insider and outsider perspectives into the coven; Stave was an initiate and a practicing Wiccan while Scarboro and Campbell remained non-initiates throughout the course of their research.

The trio became friends after meeting at an academic seminar devoted to the study of religion held at [[Emory University]], Atlanta in 1990. Stave subsequently revealed herself to the group as a Wiccan, a member of a [[new religious movement]] that interested Scarboro and Campbell, and together the three decided to undertake a study of the Wiccan coven to which Stave belonged. This, the Ravenwood coven, met in the local area, where it was led by a High Priestess named Lady Sintana. Learning of their proposals, Lady Sintana gave them her permission to attend the coven's rituals, classes and open houses and also to interview its members.

Divided into three parts, ''Living Witchcraft'' offers a sociological investigation of a coven of Wiccans located in Atlanta known as Ravenwood.

==Background==

===Wicca in the United States===

Contemporary Paganism, which is also referred to as Neo-Paganism, is an [[umbrella term]] used to identify a wide variety of [[new religious movement|modern religious movements]], particularly those influenced by or claiming to be derived from the various [[Paganism|pagan]] beliefs of pre-modern Europe.&lt;ref name="Carpenter 1996 40"&gt;[[#Car96|Carpenter 1996]]. p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lew04|Lewis 2004]]. p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The religion of Pagan Witchcraft, or [[Wicca]], was developed in England during the first half of the 20th century and is one of several pagan religions. The figure at the forefront of Wicca's early development was the English occultist [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]] (1884&amp;ndash;1964), the author of ''[[Witchcraft Today]]'' (1954) and ''[[The Meaning of Witchcraft]]'' (1959) and the founder of a tradition known as [[Gardnerian Wicca]]. Gardnerian Wicca revolved around the veneration of both a [[Horned God]] and a [[Mother Goddess]], the celebration of eight seasonally-based festivals in a [[Wheel of the Year]] and the practice of magical rituals in groups known as [[coven]]s. Gardnerianism was subsequently brought to the U.S. in the early 1960s by an English initiate, [[Raymond Buckland]] (1934&amp;ndash;), and his then-wife Rosemary, who together founded a coven on [[Long Island]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]] pp. 205&amp;ndash;252.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cli06|Clifton 2006]]. pp. 24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., new variants of Wicca developed, including [[Dianic Wicca]], a tradition founded in the 1970s which was influenced by [[second wave feminism]], emphasized female-only covens, and rejected the veneration of the Horned God. One initiate of both the Dianic and Gardnerian traditions was a woman known as [[Starhawk]] (1951&amp;ndash;) who went on to found her own tradition, [[Reclaiming (Neopaganism)|Reclaiming Wicca]], as well as publishing ''[[The Spiral Dance|The Spiral Dance: a Rebirth of the Ancient Religion of the Great Goddess]]'' (1979), a book which helped spread Wicca throughout the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]]. pp. 340&amp;ndash;351&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cli06|Clifton 2006]]. pp. 122&amp;ndash;123&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic fieldwork into Wicca===

Prior to the authors' work, several American researchers working in the field of [[Pagan studies]] had separately published investigations of the Pagan community in both the United States and the United Kingdom. The first of these had been the practicing Wiccan, journalist and political activist [[Margot Adler]] in her ''[[Drawing Down the Moon (book)|Drawing Down the Moon: Witches, Druids, Goddess-Worshippers, and Other Pagans in America Today]]'', which was first published by [[Viking Press]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Adl79|Adler 1979]].&lt;/ref&gt; A second study was produced by the anthropologist [[Tanya Luhrmann|Tanya M. Luhrmann]] in her ''[[Persuasions of the Witch's Craft|Persuasions of the Witch's Craft: Ritual Magic in Contemporary England]]'' (1989), in which she focused on both a Wiccan coven and several ceremonial magic orders that were then operating in London.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Luh89|Luhrmann 1989]].&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time as Scarboro, Campbell and Stave were undertaking their research, the American anthropologist and practicing Wiccan Loretta Orion was also undertaking an investigation into the Pagan movement in the East Coast and Midwest of the United States. Orion's work would come to be published as ''[[Never Again the Burning Times|Never Again the Burning Times: Paganism Revisited]]'' by Waveland Press in 1995, although would be heavily criticized in reviews written by both Luhrmann and T.O. Beidelman, both of whom were of the opinion that Orion's Pagan beliefs had clouded her critical interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;See [[#Ori95|Orion 1995]], and also [[#Bei95|Beidelman 1995]] and [[#Luh96|Luhrmann 1996]].&lt;/ref&gt; The sociologist [[Helen A. Berger]] of the [[West Chester University of Pennsylvania]] had also been undertaking fieldwork among the Wiccan community of [[New England]] during that decade, having developed an interest in researching the subject in 1986. The results of Berger's 11 years of research would come to be published by the [[University of South Carolina Press]] in 1999 as ''[[A Community of Witches|A Community of Witches: Contemporary Neo-Paganism and Witchcraft in the United States]]'', to predominantly positive academic reviews.&lt;ref&gt;See [[#Ber99|Berger 1999]], and also [[#Fol99|Foltz 1999]], [[#Gla99|Glazier 1999]], [[#Kos99|Kostarelos 1999]], [[#Sch00|Schnurbein 2000]] and [[#Nei00|Neitz 2000]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scarboro, Campbell, Stave and their research===

The project that resulted in ''Living Witchcraft'' originated at a seminar led by Robert Detweiler, a professor at [[Emory University]]'s Graduate Institute of the Liberal Arts. Sponsored by the [[Dana Foundation]], the seminar took place in Autumn 1990, and involved six professors from various U.S. colleges meeting together in Atlanta to share their research into various different aspects of religion and discuss conceptions of [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|duality between the mind and the body]].&lt;ref name="Scarboro ix"/&gt; One of the academics attending the seminar, Shirley "Holly" Stave, a literary critic and untenured faculty member at Emory, soon admitted to the group that she was a practicing Wiccan, and told them of her belief that her religion could provide "a way of reuniting mind and body."&lt;ref name="Scarboro ix"/&gt; Stave later explained to the group that she felt "moved" by "Spirit" to inform them of her own spiritual beliefs, in spite of the discrimination that this could bring upon her in the largely Christian state of Georgia. She also felt that in helping to educate others about Wiccan beliefs, it would ultimately help to prevent the misinformation and persecution that many Wiccans faced.&lt;ref name="Scarboro x"&gt;[[#Scar94|Scarboro, Campbell and Stave 1994]]. p. x.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the other academics attending the seminar were already familiar with the Wiccan movement. Allen Scarboro, then studying the [[sociology of religion]], had previously undertaken magico-religious practices with two Native American shamans, and had a basic knowledge of various new religious movements including Wicca, while Nancy Campbell, an academic psychologist, had previously attended the rituals of a feminist Wiccan group. Wanting to learn more about the faith, Scarboro and Campbell approached Stave, asking her if they could witness any of the rituals performed by her coven, which was known as Ravenwood. After gaining the permission of the coven's High Priestess, Lady Sintana, they attended the group's [[Sabbat]] rite at [[Hallowmas]], later deciding that they wanted to undertake research into the group for an interdisciplinary project, imagining that it would result in an extended [[academic paper]].&lt;ref name="Scarboro x"/&gt;

Agreeing to their proposals, the only two constraints that Lady Sintana imposed on the researchers was that Scarboro and Campbell, the two non-initiates, could not "observe, know, or report the text for the circle-building procedures that immediately precede and prepare the energy circle for rituals", and that they also could not attend initiation rituals or learn the text for the Ravenwood initiation rites. These things, Lady Sintana maintained, were secrets that only those initiated into the coven could know.&lt;ref name="Scarboro xi-xii"&gt;[[#Scar94|Scarboro, Campbell and Stave 1994]]. pp. xi&amp;ndash;xii.&lt;/ref&gt; In putting together their [[research design]], the trio were aided by Robin Ingalls, a student with a background in psychology and spirituality who was studying at [[Georgia State University]], while another student, Gilbert Bond, who was then studying at Emory University's Graduate Institute of Liberal Arts, also aided them in their research.&lt;ref name="Scarboro xii"&gt;[[#Scar94|Scarboro, Campbell and Stave 1994]]. p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt; The group began their project in October 1990, having gathered most of their data by June 1991, by which time they had also written early drafts for several chapters of what would later come to be published as ''Living Witchcraft'' in 1994.&lt;ref name="Scarboro xii"/&gt;

==Synopsis==

===Part I: Ravenwood: A Living Atlanta Coven===
The first part of ''Living Witchcraft'' was devoted to describing the ritual activities which members of the Ravenwood coven took part in.&lt;ref name="Scarboro 1-2"&gt;[[#Scar94|Scarboro, Campbell and Stave 1994]]. pp. 1&amp;ndash;2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments==

===Insider/outsider dichotomy===
Regarding their approach to fieldwork, the authors noted that they had given "serious consideration" to whether Stave, being a practicing Wiccan, could be [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] in her participation in the study. However, as they later noted, "poststructural theoretical perspective[s]" had shown that "pure objectivity is never possible", and that the "context of each researcher &amp;ndash; gender, race, socioeconomic level, sexual orientation, one's biography as a whole &amp;ndash; shapes that person's understanding."&lt;ref name="Scarboro xi"&gt;[[#Scar94|Scarboro, Campbell and Stave 1994]]. p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than aiming to achieve a positivist objectivity, they instead focused on achieving what American anthropologist [[Clifford Geertz]] (1926&amp;ndash;2006) referred to as a "[[thick description]]" in his book ''The Interpretation of Cultures'' (1973). This "thick description" approach would not only present the Wiccans themselves in a manner that they would recognize, but also related what a "non-Witch, specifically a thinking, reflective, non-Witch, would experience were she or he to participate in rituals and classes at Ravenwood."&lt;ref name="Scarboro xi"/&gt;

==Reception and recognition==

===Academic reviews===
The anthropologist [[Tanya Luhrmann]] (1959&amp;ndash;) of the [[University of California, San Diego]], published a review of both ''Living Witchcraft'' and Loretta Orion's ''[[Never Again the Burning Times]]'' (1995) in the ''Journal of Anthropological Research''. Noting that ''Living Witchcraft'' was "as sympathetic to the practice" of Wicca as Orion's study, she believed however that it had the advantage of being "written from the more distanced stand of the participant-observer as understood in mainstream anthropology." In focusing in on one particular coven rather than trying to provide a broader study of the Wiccan movement, Luhrmann felt that ''Living Witchcraft'' had provided a study which was "unusual and fascinating and remarkably rich in its detail." She proceeded to note that in her opinion, the "eye-opening" feature of the book was its examination of what life was like for public Witches living in the [[Deep South]], a predominantly conservative and Christian part of the United States. In summing up her review, Luhrmann stated that "witchcraft remains an important study for anthropological research, if only because so many people have such peculiar ideas about it."&lt;ref name="Luhrmann 1996"&gt;[[#Luh96|Luhrmann 1996]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Malagana''', also known as the '''Malagana Treasure''' is an [[Archaeological sites in Colombia|archaeological site of Colombia]] named after the same name [[sugarcane]] [[estate (house)|estate]] where it was accidentally discovered in 1992 (Malagana being a [[misspelling]] of [[Málaga]]).  During a few days after its discovery, the place was subject to a large scale [[grave robbing|looting]] with a rough estimated of 4 [[ton]]s of [[pre-Columbian]] [[artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] illegally removed from the [[burial mound]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eldoradocolombia.com/guaqueria.html&lt;/ref&gt;  A rescue archaeological mission was sent by the National Institute of Anthropology and History (ICANH), led by archaeologist [[Marianne Cardale de Schrimpff]]. Archaeological excavations at the site established a previously unknown cultural complex, designated as Malagana-Sonsoid, that dates between 300 BC to 300 AD

== Discovery ==
The discovery of the Malagana Treasure began with an accident in a sugar-cane field at [[Hacienda]] Malagana, which is situated on the flatlands of the fertile [[Cauca river]] valley, near the city of Palmira in western Colombia.   A worker was driving a piece of heavy equipment (a tractor)&lt;ref name="Warwick-p94-111"&gt;Bray Warwick (2000). "Malagana and the Goldworking Tradition of Southwest Colombia".  In ''Precolumbian Gold: Technology, Style and Iconography'' (Colin McEwan, ed.). British Museum Press, London. {{ISBN|0-7141-2534-2}}, pp.94-111.&lt;/ref&gt; across the field when the ground suddenly [[cave in|collapsed]], and the vehicle fell into a large hole.  As the driver inspected his predicament, something shiny caught his eye.  The object was made of gold, and the hole turned out to be an ancient [[hypogeum]].  The worker removed some of the [[Goldsmith|goldwork]] items and quietly sold them.  Before long, his activities caught the attention of others.  Between October and December 1992, [[gold rush|hoards of gold-seekers]] arrived to Hacienda Malagana's sugar-cane field.&lt;ref name="Warwick-p94-111" /&gt;  According to newspaper accounts, the looters numbered as many as 5,000.  Reporters on the scene captured the bedlam on camera and published their photographs in newspapers.&lt;ref name="IARC"&gt;IARC [Illicit Antiquities Research Center] Colombia, illicit antiquities and ICOM Red List Latin America.  Culture Without Context, Issue 12, Spring 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Even the police and army on the scene were ineffective in controlling the chaos, including one murder, and the wide scale destruction of the ancient cemetery.  Countless artifacts were carried off by the treasure hunters.  The weight of the gold objects that were taken from the site has been estimated at 160 kilograms (352 pounds) by one source (Bray 2000:94) and between 140 kilograms (308 pounds) and 180 kilograms (396 pounds) by another, who speculates that the amount might even have been greater than 180 kilograms.&lt;ref name="IARC" /&gt;

Late in 1992 the [[Gold Museum, Bogotá|Gold Museum]] in Bogotá received an impressive assortment of the gold objects made in an unfamiliar style.  Research revealed that the source of the artifacts was the Hacienda Malagana site.&lt;ref&gt;Banco de la República (2005a).  From Board Room to Modern Museum: Gold Ended Up Asserting its Authority.  Museo del Oro, Bogotá, D.C.  {{cite web |url=http://www.banrep.gov.co/museo/eng/nm_moderno.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-12-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924031513/http://www.banrep.gov.co/museo/eng/nm_moderno.htm |archivedate=2006-09-24 |df= }} Retrieved November 29, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Archaeological excavations ==
Even though plunderers were still present, archaeological investigations of the Hacienda Malagana cemetery were attempted in March 1993, but had to be discontinued after only a few days.  In that brief period the archaeologists were able to examine three of the tombs and to observe the site's [[stratigraphy]], which indicated a record of prolonged habitation.  One grave yielded two gold beads and a pottery vessel that the looters had overlooked.  A [[radiocarbon date]] of AD 70 +/- 60 (uncalibrated) was obtained from the debris inside the pottery vessel.  After the site had finally been abandoned by the treasurer hunters, more extensive excavations were conducted late in 1994.  Because the cemetery area of the site had been destroyed, the 1994 excavations focused on a residential area some 500 meters from the ransacked cemetery area.  These excavations revealed a lengthy and complex stratigraphy, seventeen burials, four occupation periods, and additional radiocarbon dates.  The occupational periods were designated as "Proto-Llama" (earliest period), "Llama," "Malagana," and "Sonsoid" (latest) (Bray 2000:94-95).  Links in the form of trade by the inhabitants of Malagana with groups in the San Agustín and Tierradentro areas to the south and with the Tolima and Quimbaya areas to the east and north are apparent in the artifact assemblies.  By the Malagana period, Malagana had developed as a regional culture with a distinguishable style.

== Museo del Oro (Gold Museum) ==
After receiving the initial gold items, the Museum of Gold launched a campaign to locate and recover as many artifacts as possible that were stolen from the tombs of the main cemetery at Hacienda Malagana.  Over 150 objects were acquired as a result of this endeavor.  While the gold items themselves are spectacular to look at, their ability to give important data about the people who created them was lost in the 1992 "gold rush" when they were ripped from tombs in which they had been placed many centuries before.  Although some physical information about the artifacts themselves may be gained by careful study of the objects, their true value of providing clues to the past is possible only when the objects are found in their [[archaeological context|original cultural context]].  Remarkably, museum archaeologists were able to obtain general information about the archaeological context for a number of these objects by pursuing accounts from individuals who had witnessed the plundering frenzy of 1992.  As a result, the archaeologists were able to designate the artifact assemblies for twenty-nine of the graves, which provides important knowledge not only about religion and burial practices, but also about the political and social structures and value systems of the Malagana culture (Bray 2000:94-95).

== Description of Tomb 1 and its contents, main cemetery ==
In several instances interviews with the 1992 observers coupled with meticulous study of the artifacts, the actual arrangement of the gold, pottery and other items in the tombs have been able to be reconstructed by the archaeologists.  One such tomb is Tomb 1, which is among the most prolific from the main cemetery of the site.  Bray describes the layout of the tomb, as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt; The tomb consisted of a rectangular shaft about 3 m deep, filled with [[gravel]] and river sand containing specks of alluvial gold.  The floor was paved with rectangular slabs of a white granitic stone foreign to the [[Cauca River|Cauca]] [[floodplain]], and a single course of more rounded stones had been placed around the base of the wall to define the funerary area.  A conical object of carved stone lay somewhere in the burial zone.

The body was stretched out on its back on the floor of the tomb, and the face was covered by three large [[Metal leaf#Gold leaf|gold leaf]] [[death mask|masks]], one on top of the other.  In the neck area were tubular gold beads and little gold birds, together with necklaces of coloured stone beads, carved [[emerald]]s and red [[Spondylus]] shells, and enough tiny stone beads to form a string about 50 m long.  Gold beads were found in the neck area and in a single row on the chest.  A sheet-gold mask concealed the feet of the corpse.  The published accounts also list two pendant-plaques and two plaques for sewing onto textiles.  A set of bone tubes (or cylindrical beads) found just below the waist may have been attached to a loincloth or kilt like those represented on miniature gold figurines, and the legs of the skeleton were separated by a line of rock crystal beads.  In a niche in the wall above the head of the corpse were two Ilama-style pots: one a bowl with four feet and the other an alcarraza (a vessel with two spouts joined by a bridge handle) in the form of a recumbent woman.  A layer of between fifty and one hundred stone slabs of various sizes covered and protected the entire funerary deposit (Bray 2000:96-97).  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Malagana treasure preserved ==
Prior to 1939 the gold objects that treasure hunters removed illegally from archaeological sites were either taken to the bank to be exchanged for cash or were sold to gallery owners and dealers in art and antiquities.  The gold purchased by the bank was melted down.  The items acquired by the galleries and dealers were resold to private collectors, museums, and other institutions, many of which were destined for other countries.  In 1939 a man named Julio Caro convinced the board of the Banco de la República in Bogotá that the gold items should be preserved and retained within Colombia.  The gold artifacts that were accumulated were kept in the bank's boardroom and, from 1947 to 1959, were shown only to important visitors.  In 1959 the bank constructed a new building, which contained a long room in the basement lined with showcases displaying the artifacts.  For the first time the public was permitted to see the golden treasures of the past.  When another new building for the bank was under construction in 1970, several individuals associated with the bank promoted the idea of making it into a first-class scientific museum for the exhibition of their collection.  Museum experts and anthropologists were called in to bring order and cultural milieu to the exhibits.  Upon completion of the four-storied, prism-shaped Museo del Oro building, the treasures of the Malagana culture and the other cultures of Colombia received the finest of accommodations for their preservation and for the enlightenment of present and future generations &lt;ref&gt;The Renovation of the Gold Museum, Bogotá, Colombia.

In 2004, the Museo del Oro launched the first of a three-stage renovation to its facilities and exhibits.  When the project is completed in 2007, the treasures will be displayed with the latest, state-of-the-art techniques.  One of the goals of the renovations is to communicate to the viewer the lives of the objects and their makers in the most effective way possible (Banco de la República, 2005b).

Some of the gold artifacts were recently displayed in the United States.  The Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C., presented an exhibit entitled "The Spirit of Ancient Colombia Gold" from November 9, 2005, through April 9, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Smithsonian Institution.  The Spirit of Ancient Colombian Gold.  Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, Washington, D.C., 2005.  [http://www.mnh.si.edu/exhibits/gold/index.htm]  Retrieved on November 29, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  A total of 280 gold objects were loaned from the Museo del Oro of Bogotá for the exhibition.  A funerary mask, made of hammered-sheet gold in the Malagana style and dating between 200 BC and 200 AD, is depicted on the Smithsonian Institution's webpage announcing the exhibit (Smithsonian Institution 2005).
Sometime between 200 BC and AD 200, the Malagana treasure was laid with respect in tombs in a cemetery near Hacienda Malagana.  In 1992 the major portion of these treasures were ripped from their earthen resting places and were melted or transported to unknown places.  Now, the few examples that remain of the Malagana treasure, along with artifacts of its neighboring cultures, are once again under the control of their home country and housed with respect.  The treasure inspires its makers' descendants and the rest of the world with a sense of awe and utmost esteem for the craftsmen and culture of its origin.

Manichaeism taught an elaborate [[dualistic cosmology]] describing the [[conflict between good and evil|struggle]] between a [[goodness and value theory|good]], spiritual world of light, and an [[evil]], material world of darkness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/cosmogony-iii|title=COSMOGONY AND COSMOLOGY iii.

Its beliefs were based on local Mesopotamian religious movements and [[Gnosticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Widengren, Geo ''Mesopotamian elements in Manichaeism (King and Saviour II): Studies in Manichaean, Mandaean, and Syrian-gnostic religion'', Lundequistska bokhandeln, 1946.&lt;/ref&gt;

Manichaeism was quickly successful and spread far through the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]-speaking regions.&lt;ref name="BeDuhnMirecki2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jason BeDuhn|author2=Paul Allan Mirecki|title=Frontiers of Faith: The Christian Encounter With Manichaeism in the Acts of Archelaus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JQd8b5s5QBUC&amp;pg=PA6|year=2007|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-16180-1|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It thrived between the third and seventh centuries, and at its height was one of the most widespread religions in the world. Manichaean churches and scriptures existed as far east as [[China]] and as far west as the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Welburn, ''Mani, the Angel and the Column of Glory: An Anthology of Manichaean Texts'' (Edinburgh: Floris Books, 1998), p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; It was briefly the main rival to [[Christianity]] before the spread of Islam in the competition to replace [[Hellenistic religion|classical paganism]]. Manichaeism survived longer in the east than in the west, and it appears to have finally faded away after the 14th century in [[south China]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Jason BeDuhn|Jason David BeDuhn]] ''The Manichaean Body: In Discipline and Ritual'' Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. 2000 republished 2002 p.IX&lt;/ref&gt; contemporary to the decline of the [[Church of the East]] in [[Ming dynasty|Ming China]]. While most of Manichaeism's original writings have been lost, numerous translations and fragmentary texts have survived.

An adherent of Manichaeism is called a ''Manichaean'' or ''Manichean'', or ''Manichee'', especially in older sources.&lt;ref&gt;Such as the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers First Series, ed. Philip Schaff, writing of Augustine&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Manichaean Merriam-Webster ─ Manichaean]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Mani (prophet)}}
Mani was an [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]]&lt;ref&gt;Mary Boyce, ''Zoroastrians: their religious beliefs and practices'', Routledge, 2001. p. 111: "He was Iranian, of noble Parthian blood..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Warwick Ball, ''Rome in the East: the transformation of an empire'', Routledge, 2001. p. 437: "Manichaeism was a syncretic religion, proclaimed by the Iranian Prophet Mani...&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{quote|According to the ''Fehrest'', Mani was of [[Parthian Empire|Arsacid]] stock on both his father's and his mother's sides, at least if the readings al-ḥaskāniya (Mani's father) and al-asʿāniya (Mani's mother) are corrected to al-aškāniya and al-ašḡāniya (ed. Flügel, 1862, p. 49, ll. 2 and 3) respectively. The forefathers of Mani's father are said to have been from Hamadan and so perhaps of Iranian origin (ed. Flügel, 1862, p. 49, 5–6). The ''Chinese Compendium'', which makes the father a local king, maintains that his mother was from the house Jinsajian, explained by Henning as the Armenian Arsacid family of Kamsarakan (Henning, 1943, p. 52, n. 4 1977, II, p. 115). Is that fact, or fiction, or both? The historicity of this tradition is assumed by most, but the possibility that Mani's noble Arsacid background is legendary cannot be ruled out (cf. Scheftelowitz, 1933, pp. 403–4). In any case, it is characteristic that Mani took pride in his origin from time-honored [[Babylon|Babel]], but never claimed affiliation to the Iranian upper class.|{{iranica|mani-founder-manicheism}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; born in 216 in or near [[Seleucia]]-[[Ctesiphon]] (now [[al-Mada'in]]) in the [[Parthian Empire]].&lt;ref name="Coyle2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Kevin Coyle|title=Manichaeism and Its Legacy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wnFz3tI0qOwC&amp;pg=PR13|accessdate=27 August 2012|date=15 September 2009|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-17574-7|pages=13–}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Cologne Mani-Codex]]'',&lt;ref name="Mani-Kodex"&gt;L. Koenen and C. Römer, eds., ''Der Kölner Mani-Kodex. Über das Werden seines Leibes. Kritische Edition'', (Abhandlung der Reinisch-Westfälischen Akademie der Wissenschaften: Papyrologica Coloniensia '''14''') (Opladen, Germany) 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Mani's parents were members of the [[Jewish Christian]] [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] [[sect]] known as the [[Elcesaites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{iranica|mani-founder-manicheism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mani composed seven works, six of which were written in the [[Syriac language]], a late variety of Aramaic. The seventh, the ''[[Shabuhragan]]'',&lt;ref name="Shabuhragan"&gt;Middle Persian Sources: D. N. MacKenzie, ''Mani's Šābuhragān'', pt. 1 (text and translation), BSOAS 42/3, 1979, pp. 500–34, pt. 2 (glossary and plates), BSOAS 43/2, 1980, pp. 288–310.&lt;/ref&gt; was written by Mani in [[Middle Persian]] and presented by him to the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian emperor]], [[Shapur I]]. Although there is no proof Shapur I was a Manichaean, he tolerated the spread of Manichaeism and refrained from persecuting it within his empire's boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;Welburn (1998), pp. 67–68&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one tradition, it was Mani himself who invented the unique version of the Syriac script known as the [[Manichaean alphabet]]{{citation needed|date = November 2018}}, which was used in all of the Manichaean works written within the Sasanian Empire, whether they were in Syriac or [[Middle Persian]], and also for most of the works written within the [[Uyghur Khaganate]]. The primary language of [[Babylon]] (and the administrative and cultural language of the Sassanid Empire) at that time was [[Middle Aramaic|Eastern Middle Aramaic]], which included three main dialects: [[Jewish Babylonian Aramaic]] (the language of the [[Babylonian Talmud]]), [[Mandaic language|Mandaean]] (the language of [[Mandaeism]]), and Syriac, which was the language of Mani, as well as of the [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac Christians]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

While Manichaeism was spreading, existing religions such as [[Zoroastrianism]] were still popular and [[Christianity]] was gaining social and political influence. Although having fewer adherents, Manichaeism won the support of many high-ranking political figures. With the assistance of the Sasanian Empire, Mani began missionary expeditions. After failing to win the favour of the next generation of Persian royalty, and incurring the disapproval of the Zoroastrian clergy, Mani is reported to have died in prison awaiting execution by the Persian Emperor [[Bahram I]]. The date of his death is estimated at 276–277.&lt;ref name="Coyle2009"/&gt;

[[File:Sermon on Mani's Teaching of Salvation. Cathayan Manichaean silk painting, 13th-century.jpg|thumb|''[[Sermon on Mani's Teaching of Salvation]]'', 13th-century Chinese Manichaean silk painting.]]
Mani believed that the teachings of [[Gautama Buddha]], [[Zoroaster]], and [[Jesus]] were incomplete, and that his revelations were for the entire world, calling his teachings the "Religion of Light".&lt;ref name="Coyle2009" /&gt; Manichaean writings indicate that Mani received revelations when he was 12 and again when he was 24, and over this time period he grew dissatisfied with the Elcesaite sect he was born into.&lt;ref name="Reeves1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=John C. Reeves|title=Heralds of That Good Realm: Syro-Mesopotamian Gnosis and Jewish Traditions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ewM1xTuRQaoC&amp;pg=PA6|accessdate=27 August 2012|year=1996|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-10459-4|pages=6–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mani began preaching at an early age and was possibly influenced by contemporary Babylonian-Aramaic movements such as Mandaeism, and Aramaic translations of [[Jewish eschatology|Jewish apocalyptic writings]] similar to those found at [[Qumran]] (such as the [[book of Enoch]] literature), and by the Syriac dualist-gnostic writer [[Bardaisan]] (who lived a generation before Mani). With the discovery of the Mani-Codex, it also became clear that he was raised in a Jewish-Christian baptism sect, the [[Elcesaites]], and was influenced by their writings, as well. According to biographies preserved by [[Ibn al-Nadim]] and the Persian [[polymath]] [[al-Biruni]], he received a revelation as a youth from a spirit, whom he would later call his Twin ({{lang-arc|[[wikt:תאומא|תאומא]]}} {{ipa|tɑʔwmɑ}}, from which is also derived the name of the [[Thomas the Apostle]], the "twin"), his ''Syzygos'' ({{lang-grc-koi|[[wikt:σύζυγος|σύζυγος]]}} "spouse, partner", in the ''[[Cologne Mani-Codex]]''), his Double, his Protective Angel or Divine Self. It taught him truths that he developed into a religion. His divine Twin or true Self brought Mani to [[self-realization]]. He claimed to be the ''[[Paraclete]] of the Truth'', as promised by Jesus in the New Testament.&lt;ref name="THE ROLE OF THE PARACLETE"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lutkemeyer |first=Lawrence J. |last2= |first2= |title=THE ROLE OF THE PARACLETE (Jn. 16:7-15) |jstor=43719890|journal=The Catholic Biblical Quarterly |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=220–229 |doi= |year=1946 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manichaeism's views on Jesus are described by historians:
{{quote|Jesus in Manichaeism possessed three separate identities: (1) Jesus the Luminous, (2) Jesus the Messiah and (3) Jesus patibilis (the suffering Jesus). (1) As Jesus the Luminous... his primary role was as supreme revealer and guide and it was he who woke Adam from his slumber and revealed to him the divine origins of his soul and its painful captivity by the body and mixture with matter. Jesus the Messiah was a historical being who was the prophet of the Jews and the forerunner of Mani. However, the Manichaeans believed he was wholly divine. He never experienced human birth as notions of physical conception and birth filled the Manichaeans with horror and the Christian doctrine of virgin birth was regarded as equally obscene. Since he was the light of the world, where was this light, they asked, when he was in the womb of the Virgin? (2) Jesus the Messiah was truly born at his baptism as it was on that occasion that the Father openly acknowledged his sonship. The suffering, death and resurrection of this Jesus were in appearance only as they had no salvific value but were an exemplum of the suffering and eventual deliverance of the human soul and a prefiguration of Mani's own martyrdom. (3) The pain suffered by the imprisoned Light-Particles in the whole of the visible universe, on the other hand, was real and immanent. This was symbolized by the ''mystic placing of the Cross whereby the wounds of the passion of our souls are set forth''. On this mystical Cross of Light was suspended the Suffering Jesus (Jesus patibilis) who was ''the life and salvation of Man''. This mystica cruxificio was present in every tree, herb, fruit, vegetable and even stones and the soil. This constant and universal suffering of the captive soul is exquisitely expressed in one of the Coptic Manichaean psalms.&lt;ref name="SNC Lieu"&gt;{{cite book |title=Manichaeism in the Later Roman Empire and Medieval China |first=Samuel N. C. |last=Lieu |url=https://books.google.com/?id=hmNPz9teHqUC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;lpg=PA161&amp;dq=manichaeism+divinity+of+Jesus#v=onepage&amp;q=manichaeism%20divinity%20of%20Jesus&amp;f=false |publisher= |isbn=9783161458200 |date=1992-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Historians also note that Mani declared himself to be an "apostle of Jesus Christ".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=57nFeeC3GKoC&amp;pg=PA315&amp;lpg=PA315&amp;dq=Mani+declared+he+was+an+apostle+of+Jesus#v=onepage&amp;q=Mani%20declared%20he%20was%20an%20apostle%20of%20Jesus&amp;f=false |title=The Manichean Debate, by Saint Augustine (Bishop of Hippo) |accessdate=2012-08-18|isbn=9781565482470|year=2006|last1=) |first1=Saint Augustine (Bishop of Hippo }}&lt;/ref&gt; Manichaean tradition is also noted to have claimed that Mani was the reincarnation of different religious figures such as Buddha, [[Krishna]], Zoroaster, and Jesus.&lt;ref name="Silkspice.wordpress.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://silkspice.wordpress.com/2011/04/ |title=The movement of the Manichaean tradition along the Silk Road |publisher=Silkspice.wordpress.com |date=2011-04-05 |accessdate=2012-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Other than incorporating the symbols and doctrine of dominant religious traditions, Manichaeism also incorporated the symbols and deities of indigenous traditions, in particular the [[Hindu]] deity [[Ganesha]] into its fold, demonstrated by the image available in the article, "Manichaean Art and Calligraphy" by Hans-Joachim Klimkeit. Mani was claiming to be the reincarnation of the Buddha, Lord Krishna, Zoroaster and Jesus depending on the context in which he was carrying out his preachings. Such strategic claims fostered a spirit of toleration among the Manichaeans and the other religious communities and this particular feature greatly assisted them in gaining the approval of authorities to practice in different regions along the [[Silk Road]].&lt;ref name="Silkspice.wordpress.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://silkspice.wordpress.com/2011/04/ |title=The movement of the Manichaean tradition along the Silk Road |publisher=Silkspice.wordpress.com |date=2011-04-05 |accessdate=2012-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Academics also note that since much of what is known about Manichaeism comes from later 10th- and 11th-century Muslim historians like [[Al-Biruni]] and especially [[ibn al-Nadim]] (and his ''Fihrist''), "Islamic authors ascribed to Mani the claim to be the Seal of the Prophets."&lt;ref&gt;{{iranica|eschatology-ii|ESCHATOLOGY ii. Manichean Eschatology}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, for Mani the expression "seal of prophecy" refers to his disciples, who testify for the veracity of his message, as a seal does.&lt;ref&gt;C. Colpe, ''Das Siegel der Propheten: historische Beziehungen zwischen Judentum, Judenchristentum, Heidentum und frühem Islam'', Arbeiten zur neutestamentlichen Theologie und Zeitgeschichte, 3 (Berlin: Institut Kirche und judentum, 1990), 227-43; G.G. Stroumsa, ''The Making of the Abrahamic Religions in Late Antiquity'', Oxford Studies in the Abrahamic Religions (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2015), 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ManichaeanElectaeKocho10thCentury.jpg|thumb|10th century Manichaean Electae in [[Gaochang]] (Khocho), China.]]
Another source of Mani's scriptures was original Aramaic writings relating to the ''Book of Enoch'' literature (see the [[Book of Enoch]] and the [[Second Book of Enoch]]), as well as an otherwise unknown section of the Book of Enoch called ''[[The Book of Giants]]''. This book was quoted directly, and expanded on by Mani, becoming one of the original six Syriac writings of the Manichaean Church. Besides brief references by non-Manichaean authors through the centuries, no original sources of ''The Book of Giants'' (which is actually part six of the Book of Enoch) were available until the 20th century.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Scattered fragments of both the original Aramaic "Book of Giants" (which were analyzed and published by [[Józef Milik]] in 1976)&lt;ref&gt;J. T. Milik, ed. and trans., ''The Books of Enoch: Aramaic Fragments of Qumran Cave 4'', Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; and of the Manichaean version of the same name (analyzed and published by [[Walter Bruno Henning]] in 1943)&lt;ref name="Henning"&gt;In: Henning, W. B., ''The Book of Giants'', BSOAS, Vol. XI, Part 1, 1943, pp. 52–74.&lt;/ref&gt; were found with the discovery in the twentieth century of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] in the Judaean Desert and the Manichaean writings of the [[Uyghurs|Uyghur]] Manichaean kingdom in [[Turpan]]. Henning wrote in his analysis of them:

{{quote|It is noteworthy that Mani, who was brought up and spent most of his life in a province of the Persian empire, and whose mother belonged to a famous Parthian family, did not make any use of the Iranian mythological tradition. There can no longer be any doubt that the Iranian names of [[Sām]], [[Nariman (Shahnameh)|Narīmān]], etc., that appear in the Persian and Sogdian versions of the Book of the Giants, did not figure in the original edition, written by Mani in the Syriac language.&lt;ref name="Henning"/&gt;}}

By comparing the cosmology in the Book of Enoch literature and the Book of Giants, alongside the description of the Manichaean myth, scholars have observed that the Manichaean cosmology can be described as being based, in part, on the description of the cosmology developed in detail in the Book of Enoch literature.&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, John C. ''Jewish Lore in Manichaean Cosmogony: Studies in the Book of Giants Traditions'' (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; This literature describes the being that the prophets saw in their ascent to heaven, as a king who sits on a throne at the highest of the heavens. In the Manichaean description, this being, the "Great King of Honor", becomes a deity who guards the entrance to the world of light, placed at the seventh of ten heavens.&lt;ref&gt;See Henning, ''A Sogdian Fragment of the Manichaean Cosmogony'', BSOAS, 1948&lt;/ref&gt; In the Aramaic Book of Enoch, in the Qumran writings in general, and in the original Syriac section of Manichaean scriptures quoted by [[Theodore bar Konai]],&lt;ref name="Konai"/&gt; he is called "malka raba de-ikara" (the Great King of Honor).{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Mani was also influenced by writings of the Assyrian gnostic [[Bardaisan]] (154–222), who, like Mani, wrote in Syriac, and presented a dualistic interpretation of the world in terms of light and darkness, in combination with elements from Christianity.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

[[File:Akshobya in His Eastern Paradise with Cross of Light.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Akshobhya]] in the [[Abhirati]] with the Cross of Light, a symbol of Manichaeism.]]
Noting Mani's travels to the [[Kushan Empire]] (several religious paintings in [[Bamyan]] are attributed to him) at the beginning of his proselytizing career, [[Richard Foltz]] postulates Buddhist influences in Manichaeism:
{{quote|Buddhist influences were significant in the formation of Mani's religious thought. The transmigration of souls became a Manichaean belief, and the quadripartite structure of the Manichaean community, divided between male and female monks (the "elect") and lay followers (the "hearers") who supported them, appears to be based on that of the Buddhist [[sangha]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Foltz]], ''Religions of the Silk Road'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2nd edition, 2010, p. 71 {{ISBN|978-0-230-62125-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Kushan Empire|Kushan]] monk [[Lokaksema (Buddhist monk)|Lokakṣema]] began translating [[Pure Land Buddhism|Pure Land Buddhist]] texts into Chinese in the century prior to Mani arriving there, and the Chinese texts of Manichaeism are full of uniquely Buddhist terms taken directly from these Chinese Pure Land scriptures, including the term "[[pure land]]" (淨土 Jìngtǔ) itself.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Bryder, ''The Chinese Transformation of Manichaeism: A Study of Chinese Manichaean Terminology'', 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the central object of veneration in Pure Land Buddhism, [[Amitābha]], the Buddha of Infinite Light, does not appear in [[Chinese Manichaeism]], and seems to have been replaced by another deity.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

===Spread===
[[File:Spread of Manicheanism.png|alt=|thumb|310x310px|The spread of Manichaeism (300–500). ''World History Atlas'', Dorling Kindersly.]]
Manichaeism spread with extraordinary speed through both the East and West. It reached Rome through the apostle Psattiq by 280, who was also in [[Egypt]] in 244 and 251. It was flourishing in the [[Faiyum]] in 290.

Manichaean monasteries existed in Rome in 312 during the time of [[Pope Miltiades]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In 291, persecution arose in the Sasanian Empire with the murder of the apostle Sisin by Emperor [[Bahram II]], and the slaughter of many Manichaeans. In 296, [[Diocletian]] decreed against the Manichaeans: "We order that their organizers and leaders be subject to the final penalties and condemned to the fire with their abominable scriptures." This resulted in martyrdom for many in Egypt and [[North Africa]] (see [[Diocletianic Persecution#Manichean persecution|Diocletian Persecution]]). By 354, [[Hilary of Poitiers]] wrote that Manichaeism was a significant force in [[Roman Gaul]]. In 381, Christians requested [[Theodosius I]] to strip Manichaeans of their civil rights. Starting in 382, the emperor issued a series of edicts to suppress Manichaeism and punish its followers.&lt;ref&gt;Lieu, Samuel (1992) ''Manichaeism in the Later Roman Empire and Medieval China'' 2d edition, pp. 145-48&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tiffany Window of St Augustine - Lightner Museum.jpg|thumb|[[Augustine of Hippo]] was once a Manichaean.]]
[[Augustine of Hippo]] (354–430) converted to Christianity from Manichaeism in the year 387. This was shortly after the Roman emperor [[Theodosius I]] had issued a decree of death for all Manichaean monks in 382 and shortly before he declared Christianity to be the only legitimate religion for the Roman Empire in 391. Due to the heavy persecution, the religion almost disappeared from western Europe in the 5th century and from the eastern portion of the empire in the 6th century.&lt;ref name="Wendy"/&gt; According to his ''[[Confessions (Augustine)|Confessions]]'', after nine or ten years of adhering to the Manichaean faith as a member of the group of "hearers", Augustine became a Christian and a potent adversary of Manichaeism (which he expressed in writing against his Manichaean opponent [[Faustus of Mileve]]), seeing their beliefs that knowledge was the key to salvation as too passive and not able to effect any change in one's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=418 |title=St. Augustine of Hippo |publisher=Catholic.org |accessdate=2012-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I still thought that it is not we who sin but some other nature that sins within us. It flattered my pride to think that I incurred no guilt and, when I did wrong, not to confess it... I preferred to excuse myself and blame this unknown thing which was in me but was not part of me. The truth, of course, was that it was all my own self, and my own impiety had divided me against myself. My sin was all the more incurable because I did not think myself a sinner.&lt;ref&gt;''Confessions, Book V, Section 10''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some modern scholars have suggested that Manichaean ways of thinking influenced the development of some of Augustine's ideas, such as the nature of good and evil, the idea of hell, the separation of groups into elect, hearers, and sinners, and the hostility to the flesh and sexual activity, and his dualistic theology.&lt;ref&gt;A. Adam, ''Das Fortwirken des Manichäismus bei Augustin''. In: ZKG (69) 1958, S. 1–25.&lt;/ref&gt; These influences of Manichaeism in Augustine's Christian thinking may well have been part of the conflict between Augustine and [[Pelagius]], a British monk whose theology, being less influenced by the [[Latin Church]], was non-dualistic, and one that saw the created order, and mankind in particular, as having a Divine core, rather than a 'darkness' at its core.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

How Manichaeism might have influenced Christianity continues to be debated. Manichaeism could have influenced the [[Bogomilism|Bogomils]], [[Paulicianism|Paulicians]], and [[Catharism|Cathars]]. However, these groups left few records, and the link between them and Manichaeans is tenuous. Regardless of its accuracy, the charge of Manichaeism was leveled at them by contemporary orthodox opponents, who often tried to make contemporary heresies conform to those combatted by the church fathers. Whether the [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]] of the Paulicians, Bogomils, and Cathars and their belief that the world was created by a Satanic [[demiurge]] were due to influence from Manichaeism is impossible to determine. The Cathars apparently adopted the Manichaean principles of church organization. [[Priscillian]] and his followers may also have been influenced by Manichaeism. The Manichaeans preserved many [[apocrypha]]l Christian works, such as the [[Acts of Thomas]], that would otherwise have been lost.&lt;ref name="Runciman"&gt;Runciman, Steven, ''The Medieval Manichee: a study of the Christian dualist heresy''. Cambridge University Press, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt;

Manichaeism maintained a sporadic and intermittent existence in the west ([[Mesopotamia]], [[Africa]], [[Spain]], [[France]], North [[Italy]], the [[Balkans]]) for a thousand years, and flourished for a time in Persia and even further east in Northern [[India]], Western China, and [[Tibet]]. While it had long been thought that Manichaeism arrived in China only at the end of the 7th century, a recent archaeological discovery demonstrated that it was already known there in the second half of the 6th century.&lt;ref name="La Vaissiere"&gt;Étienne de la Vaissière, "Mani en Chine au VIe siècle", ''Journal asiatique'', 293–1 (2005): 357–378.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Song dynasty|Song]] and [[Yuan Dynasty|Yuan]] dynasties of China remnants of Manichaeism continued to leave a legacy contributing to sects such as the [[Red Turban Rebellion|Red Turbans]]. During the Song Dynasty, the Manichaeans were derogatorily referred by the Chinese as ''chicai simo'' (meaning that they "abstain from meat and worship demons"). An account in ''Fozu Tongji'', an important historiography of Buddhism in China compiled by Buddhist scholars during 1258-1269, says that the Manichaens worshipped the "white Buddha" and their leader wore a violet headgear, while the followers wore white costumes. Many Manichaeans took part in rebellions against the Song government and were eventually quelled.

During the early caliphates, Manichaeism attracted many followers. It had a significant appeal among the Muslim society, especially among the elites. Due to the appeal of its teachings, many Muslims adopted the ideas of its theology and some even became dualists. An apologia for Manichaeism ascribed to [[ibn al-Muqaffa']] defended its phantasmagorical cosmogony and attacked the [[fideism]] of Islam and other monotheistic religions.

[[File:Manichaean Diagram of the Universe (Detail 12).jpg|thumb|The four primary prophets of Manichaeism in the ''[[Manichaean Diagram of the Universe]]'', from left to right: [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]], [[Zoroaster]], [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] and [[Jesus]].]]
Manichaeism claimed to present the complete version of teachings that were corrupted and misinterpreted by the followers of its predecessors Adam, Zoroaster, Buddha and Jesus. Accordingly, as it spread, it adapted new deities from other religions into forms it could use for its scriptures. Its original Aramaic texts already contained stories of Jesus. When they moved eastward and were translated into Iranian languages, the names of the Manichaean deities (or angels) were often transformed into the names of Zoroastrian [[yazata]]s. Thus ''Abbā dəRabbūṯā'' ("The Father of Greatness", the highest Manichaean deity of Light), in [[Middle Persian]] texts might either be translated literally as ''pīd ī wuzurgīh'', or substituted with the name of the deity ''[[Zurvan|Zurwān]]''. Similarly, the Manichaean primal figure ''Nāšā Qaḏmāyā'' "The Original Man" was rendered ''Ohrmazd Bay'', after the Zoroastrian god [[Ahura Mazda|Ohrmazd]]. This process continued in Manichaeism's meeting with [[Chinese Buddhism]], where, for example, the original Aramaic {{lang|arc|קריא}} ''qaryā'' (the "call" from the World of Light to those seeking rescue from the World of Darkness), becomes identified in the Chinese scriptures with [[Guanyin]] ({{script|Hant|觀音}} or [[Avalokiteśvara]] in Sanskrit, literally, "watching/perceiving sounds [of the world]", the [[bodhisattva]] of Compassion).{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

===Persecution and extinction===
Manichaeism was repressed by the [[Sasanian Empire]].&lt;ref name="Andrew"/&gt; In 291, persecution arose in the Persian empire with the murder of the apostle Sisin by [[Bahram II]], and the slaughter of many Manichaeans. In 296, the Roman emperor [[Diocletian]] decreed all the Manichaean leaders to be burnt alive along with the Manichaean scriptures and many Manichaeans in Europe and North Africa were killed. This policy of persecution was also followed by his successors. [[Theodosius I]] issued a decree of death for all Manichaean monks in 382 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=bI9_AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA361|title= Faiths Across Time: 5000 years of Religious History|author= J. Gordon Melton|publisher= [[ABC-CLIO]]|year= 2014|page= 361|isbn= 9781610690263}}&lt;/ref&gt; The religion was vigorously attacked and persecuted by both the [[Catholic Church|Christian Church]] and the Roman state. [[Augustine of Hippo]], one of the early Doctors of the Catholic Church was a Manichaean until his conversion to Christianity in 386. He was never persecuted for this and he freely converted.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} Due to the heavy persecution upon its followers in the Roman Empire, the religion almost disappeared from western Europe in the 5th century and from the eastern portion of the empire in the sixth century.&lt;ref name="Wendy"&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZP_f9icf2roC&amp;pg=PA689|title= Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions|author= [[Wendy Doniger]]|publisher= [[Merriam-Webster]]|year= 1999|pages= 689, 690|isbn= 9789068310023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 732, [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang]] banned any Chinese from converting to the religion, saying it was a heretic religion that was confusing people by claiming to be Buddhism. However the foreigners who followed the religion were allowed to practice it without punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=cO7g4WBBK9YC&amp;pg=PA182|title= Silk and Religion: An Exploration of Material Life and the Thought of People, AD 600-1200, Parts 600–1200|first= Xinru|last= Liu|publisher= [[Oxford University Press]]|year= 1997|page= 182|isbn= 9780195644524}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of the Uyghur Khaganate in 840, which was the chief patron of Manichaeism (which was also the state religion of the Khaganate) in China, all Manichaean temples in China except in the two capitals and [[Taiyuan]] were closed down and never reopened since these temples were viewed as a symbol of foreign arrogance by the Chinese (see [[Cao'an]].) Even those that were allowed to remain open did not for long. The Manichaean temples were attacked by Chinese people who burned the images and idols of these temples. Manichaean priests were ordered to wear [[hanfu]] instead of their traditional clothing, which was viewed as un-Chinese. In 843, [[Emperor Wuzong of Tang]] gave the order to kill all Manichaean clerics as part of his [[Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution]], and over half died. They were made to look like Buddhists by the authorities, their heads were shaved, they were made to dress like [[bhikkhu|Buddhist monks]] and then killed.&lt;ref name="S.N.C.L."/&gt; Although the religion was mostly forbidden and its followers persecuted thereafter in China, it survived till the 14th century in the country. Under the [[Song dynasty]], its followers were derogatorily referred to with the [[chengyu]] {{lang|zh|吃菜祀魔}} ({{zh|p=chī cài sì mó}}) "vegetarian demon-worshippers".

Many Manichaeans took part in rebellions against the Song dynasty. They were quelled by Song China and were suppressed and persecuted by all successive governments before the Mongol [[Yuan dynasty]]. In 1370, the religion was banned through an edict of the [[Ming dynasty]], whose [[Hongwu Emperor]] had a personal dislike for the religion.&lt;ref name="S.N.C.L."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Xisha2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=O_vnAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA261|title= Manichaeism in the Later Roman Empire and Medieval China: A Historical Survey|author= Samuel N.C.

According to [[Wendy Doniger]], Manichaeism may have continued to exist in the modern-[[East Turkestan]] region until the [[Mongol conquest of the Qara Khitai|Mongol conquest in the 13th century]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZP_f9icf2roC&amp;pg=PA690|title= Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions|author= [[Wendy Doniger]]|publisher= [[Merriam-Webster]]|year= 1999|page= 690|isbn= 9789068310023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manicheans also suffered persecution for some time under the Abbasid Caliphate of Baghdad. In 780, the third Abbasid Caliph, [[al-Mahdi]], started a campaign of inquisition against those who were "dualist heretics" or "Manichaeans" called the ''zindīq''. He appointed a "master of the heretics" ({{lang-ar|الزنادقة صاحب}} ''ṣāhib al-zanādiqa''), an official whose task was to pursue and investigate suspected dualists, who were then examined by the Caliph. Those found guilty who refused to abjure their beliefs were executed. This persecution continued under his successor, Caliph [[al-Hadi]], and continued for some time during reign of [[Harun al-Rashid]], who finally abolished it and ended it.&lt;ref name="Christine"/&gt; During the reign of the 18th Abbassid Caliph [[al-Muqtadir]], many Manichaeans fled from [[Mesopotamia]] to [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] from fear of persecution by him and about 500 of them assembled in [[Samarkand]]. The base of the religion was later shifted to this city, which became their new Patriarchate.&lt;ref name="Wendy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jacques"&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=YdUUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA658|title= Papers in Honor of Professor Mary Boyce|author= Jacques Duchesne-Guillemin, Pierre Lecoq|publisher= [[Brill Publishers]]|year= 1985|page= 658|isbn= 9789068310023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later movements accused of "Neo-Manichaeism"===
During the Middle Ages, several movements emerged that were collectively described as "Manichaean" by the Catholic Church, and persecuted as Christian heresies through the establishment, in 1184, of the [[Medieval Inquisition|Inquisition]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Guy Stroumsa|Stroumsa, Gedaliahu G.]], ''Anti-Cathar Polemics and the Liber de duobus principiis'', in B. Lewis and F. Niewöhner, eds., Religionsgespräche im Mittelalter (Wolfenbütteler Mittelalter-Studien, 4; Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 1992), 169–183, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; They included the [[Cathar]] churches of Western Europe. Other groups sometimes referred to as "neo-Manichaean" were the [[Paulicianism|Paulician]] movement, which arose in Armenia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11583b.htm |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Paulicians |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1911-02-01 |accessdate=2012-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Bogomilism|Bogomils]] in Bulgaria.&lt;ref name="Runciman"/&gt; An example of this usage can be found in the published edition of the Latin Cathar text, the ''Liber de duobus principiis'' (''Book of the Two Principles''), which was described as "Neo-Manichaean" by its publishers.&lt;ref&gt;Dondaine, Antoine.

==Teachings and beliefs==
===General===
Mani's teaching dealt with the origin of evil,&lt;ref name="Coyle2009"/&gt; by addressing a theoretical part of the [[problem of evil]] by denying the omnipotence of God and postulating two opposite powers. Manichaean theology taught a [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] view of good and evil. A key belief in Manichaeism is that the powerful, though not omnipotent good power (God), was opposed by the semi-eternal evil power (Satan). Humanity, the world and the soul are seen as the byproduct of the battle between God's proxy, Primal Man, and Satan. The human person is seen as a battleground for these powers: the soul defines the person, but it is under the influence of both [[light]] and [[dark]]. This contention plays out over the world as well as the human body—neither the Earth nor the flesh were seen as intrinsically evil, but rather possessed portions of both [[light]] and [[dark]]. Natural phenomena (such as rain) were seen as the physical manifestation of this spiritual contention. Therefore, the Manichaean worldview explained the existence of evil by positing a flawed creation in the formation of which God took no part and which constituted rather the product of a rebellion by Satan against God.&lt;ref name="Bevan, A.

Manichaeism presented an elaborate description of the conflict between the spiritual world of light and the material world of darkness. The beings of both the world of darkness and the world of light have names. There are numerous sources for the details of the Manichaean belief. There are two portions of Manichaean scriptures that are probably the closest thing to the original Manichaean writings in their original languages that will ever be available. These are the Syriac-Aramaic quotation by the [[Church of the East|Nestorian Christian]] [[Theodore bar Konai]], in his Syriac "Book of [[Scholia]]" (''Ketba de-Skolion''z, 8th century),&lt;ref name="Konai"/&gt; and the Middle Persian sections of Mani's [[Shabuhragan]] discovered at [[Turpan]] (a summary of Mani's teachings prepared for [[Shapur I]]&lt;ref name="Shabuhragan"/&gt;). These two sections are probably the original Syriac and Middle Persian written by Mani.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

From these and other sources, it is possible to derive an almost complete description of the detailed Manichaean vision&lt;ref&gt;A completely sourced description (built around bar-Khoni's account, with additional sources), is found in: Jonas, Hans ''The Gnostic Religion'', 1958, Ch. 9: ''Creation, World History, Salvation According to Mani''.&lt;/ref&gt; (a complete list of Manichaean deities is outlined below). According to Mani, the unfolding of the universe takes place with three "creations":{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

'''The First Creation''': Originally, good and evil existed in two completely separate realms, one the ''World of Light'', ruled by the ''Father of Greatness'' together with his five ''Shekhinas'' (divine attributes of light), and the other the ''World of Darkness'', ruled by the ''King of Darkness''. At a certain point, the ''Kingdom of Darkness'' notices the ''World of Light'', becomes greedy for it and attacks it. The ''Father of Greatness'', in the first of three "creations" (or "calls"), calls to the ''Mother of Life'', who sends her son ''Original Man'' (''Nāšā Qaḏmāyā'' in Aramaic), to battle with the attacking powers of Darkness, which include the ''Demon of Greed''. The ''Original Man'' is armed with five different shields of light (reflections of the five ''Shekhinas''), which he loses to the forces of darkness in the ensuing battle, described as a kind of "bait" to trick the forces of darkness, as the forces of darkness greedily consume as much light as they can. When the ''Original Man'' comes to, he is trapped among the forces of darkness.

'''The Second Creation''': Then the ''Father of Greatness'' begins the ''Second Creation'', calling to the ''Living Spirit'', who calls to his five sons, and sends a call to the ''Original Man'' (''Call'' then becomes a Manichaean deity). An answer (''Answer'' becomes another Manichaean deity) then returns from the ''Original Man'' to the ''World of Light''. The ''Mother of Life'', the ''Living Spirit'', and his five sons begin to create the universe from the bodies of the evil beings of the ''World of Darkness'', together with the light that they have swallowed. Ten heavens and eight earths are created, all consisting of various mixtures of the evil material beings from the ''World of Darkness'' and the swallowed light. The sun, moon, and stars are all created from light recovered from the ''World of Darkness''. The waxing and waning of the moon is described as the moon filling with light, which passes to the sun, then through the [[Milky Way]], and eventually back to the ''World of Light''.

[[File:Analysis of Doctrinal Iconography of Mani’s Cosmology.jpg|thumb|400px|An analysis on Mani's cosmology.]]
'''The Third Creation''': Great demons (called ''[[archon (Gnosticism)|archons]]'' in bar-Khonai's account) are hung out over the heavens, and then the ''Father of Greatness'' begins the ''Third Creation''. Light is recovered from out of the material bodies of the male and female evil beings and demons, by causing them to become sexually aroused in greed, towards beautiful images of the beings of light, such as the ''Third Messenger'' and the ''Virgins of Light''. However, as soon as the light is expelled from their bodies and falls to the earth (some in the form of abortions – the source of [[fallen angel]]s in the Manichaean myth), the evil beings continue to swallow up as much of it as they can to keep the light inside of them. This results eventually in the evil beings swallowing huge quantities of light, copulating, and producing Adam and Eve. The ''Father of Greatness'' then sends the ''Radiant Jesus'' to awaken Adam, and to enlighten him to the true source of the light that is trapped in his material body. Adam and Eve, however, eventually copulate, and produce more human beings, trapping the light in bodies of mankind throughout human history. The appearance of the Prophet Mani was another attempt by the ''World of Light'' to reveal to mankind the true source of the spiritual light imprisoned within their material bodies.

===Outline of the beings and events in the Manichaean mythos===
[[File:Manichaean picture from cave 25 at Bezeklik Caves.jpg|thumb|Worshiping the Tree of Life in the Kingdom of Light.]]
Beginning with the time of its creation by Mani, the Manichaean religion had a detailed description of deities and events that took place within the Manichaean scheme of the universe. In every language and region that Manichaeism spread to, these same deities reappear, whether it is in the original Syriac quoted by Theodore bar Konai,&lt;ref name="Konai"/&gt; or the Latin terminology given by Saint Augustine from Mani's ''[[Fundamental Epistle|Epistola Fundamenti]]'', or the Persian and Chinese translations found as Manichaeism spread eastward. While the original Syriac retained the original description that Mani created, the transformation of the deities through other languages and cultures produced incarnations of the deities not implied in the original Syriac writings. This process began in Mani's lifetime, with "The Father of Greatness", for example, being translated into Middle Persian as [[Zurvanism|Zurvan]], a Zoroastrian supreme being.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

== The Manichaean Church ==
=== Organization ===
The Manichaean Church was divided into the Elect, who had taken upon themselves the vows of Manicheaism, and the Hearers, those who had not, but still participated in the Church. The terms for these divisions were already common since the days of [[early Christianity]]. In Chinese writings, the Middle Persian and Parthian terms are transcribed phonetically (instead of being translated into Chinese).&lt;ref&gt;G. Haloun and W. B. Henning, ''The Compendium of the Doctrines and Styles of the Teaching of Mani, the Buddha of Light'', Asia Major, 1952, pp. 184–212, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; These were recorded by [[Augustine of Hippo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09591a.htm|title=Manichæism |encyclopedia=The Catholic Encyclopedia |date=1910 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''Leader''', (Syriac: &lt;span lang="syr"&gt;[[wikt:ܟܗܢܐ|ܟܗܢܐ]]&lt;/span&gt; {{ipa|/kɑhnɑ/}}; Parthian: ''yamag''; {{zh|c=閻默|p=yánmò}}) Mani's designated successor, seated as Patriarch at the head of the Church, originally in [[Ctesiphon]], from the ninth century in [[Samarkand]]. Two notable leaders were [[Mār Sīsin]] (or Sisinnios), the first successor of Mani, and [[Abū Hilāl al-Dayhūri]], an eighth-century leader.
* 12 '''[[Apostles]]''' (Latin: ''magistrī''; Syriac: &lt;span lang="syr"&gt;[[wikt:ܫܠܝܚܐ|ܫܠܝܚܐ]]&lt;/span&gt; {{ipa|/ʃ(ə)liħe/}}; Middle Persian: ''možag''; {{zh|c=慕闍|p=mùdū}}). Three of Mani's original apostles were Mār Pattī (Pattikios; Mani's father), [[Akouas]] and [[Mar Ammo]].
* 72 '''[[Bishop]]s''' (Latin: ''episcopī''; Syriac: &lt;span lang="syr"&gt;[[wikt:ܐܦܣܩܘܦܐ|ܐܦܣܩܘܦܐ]]&lt;/span&gt; {{ipa|/ʔappisqoppe/}}; Middle Persian: ''aspasag'', ''aftadan''; {{zh|c=薩波塞|p=sàbōsāi}} or {{zh|c=拂多誕|p=fúduōdàn}}; see also: [[seventy disciples]]). One of Mani's original disciples who was specifically referred to as a bishop was Mār Addā.
* 360 '''[[Presbyter]]s''' (Latin: ''presbyterī''; Syriac: &lt;span lang="syr" dir="rtl"&gt;[[wikt:ܩܫܝܫܐ|ܩܫܝܫܐ]]&lt;/span&gt; {{ipa|/qaʃʃiʃe/}}; Middle Persian: ''mahistan''; {{zh|c=默奚悉德|p=mòxīxīdé}})
* The general body of the '''Elect''' (Latin: ''ēlēctī''; Syriac: &lt;span lang="syr" dir="rtl"&gt;[[wikt:ܡܫܡܫܢܐ|ܡܫܡܫܢܐ]]&lt;/span&gt; {{ipa|/m(ə)ʃamməʃɑne/}}; Middle Persian: ''ardawan'' or ''dēnāwar''; {{zh|c=阿羅緩|p=āluóhuǎn}} or {{zh|c=電那勿|p=diànnàwù}})
* The '''Hearers''' (Latin: ''audītōrēs''; Syriac: &lt;span lang="syr"&gt;[[wikt:ܫܡܘܥܐ|ܫܡܘܥܐ]]&lt;/span&gt; {{ipa|/ʃɑmoʿe/}}; Middle Persian: ''niyoshagan''; {{zh|c=耨沙喭|p=nòushāyàn}})

=== Religious practices ===
The most important religious observance of the Manichaeans was the Bema Fest, observed annually:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The [[Bema#Christianity|Bema]] was originally, in the Syriac Christian churches, a seat placed in the middle of the nave on which the bishop would preside and from which the Gospel would be read. In the Manichaean places of worship, the throne was a five-stepped altar, covered by precious cloths, symbolizing the five classes of the hierarchy. The top of the Bema was always empty, as it was the seat of Mani. The Bema was celebrated at the [[vernal equinox]], was preceded by fasts, and symbolized the [[Passion (Christianity)|passion]] of Mani, thus it was strictly parallel to the Christian [[Easter]].&lt;ref&gt;Skjærvø, Prods Oktor, ''An Introduction to Manicheism'', 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While it is often presumed that the Bema seat was empty, there is some evidence from the Coptic Manichaean ''Bema Psalms'', that the Bema seat may have actually contained a copy of Mani's picture book, the [[Arzhang]].&lt;ref&gt;
Ort, L. J. R., ''Mani: a religio-historical description of his personality'', 1967, p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Primary sources ==
[[File:Image of Buddha on a Manichaean Pictorial Roll.jpg|thumb|240px|Image of the [[Buddha]] as one of the primary prophets on a Manichaean pictorial roll fragment from [[Gaochang|Chotscho]], 10th century.]]
Mani wrote either seven or eight books, which contained the teachings of the religion. Only scattered fragments and translations of the originals remain.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

The original six Syriac writings are not preserved, although their Syriac names have been. There are also fragments and quotations from them. A long quotation, preserved by the eighth-century [[Nestorianism|Nestorian Christian]] author [[Theodore Bar Konai]],&lt;ref name="Konai"&gt;Original Syriac in: Theodorus bar Konai, ''Liber Scholiorum, II'', ed. A. Scher, ''Corpus Scriptorum Christianorum Orientalium scrip. syri'', 1912, pp. 311–8, {{ISBN|978-90-429-0104-9}}; English translation in: A.V.W. Jackson, ''Researches in Manichaeism'', New York, 1932, pp. 222–54.&lt;/ref&gt; shows that in the original Syriac Aramaic writings of Mani there was no influence of Iranian or [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] terms. The terms for the Manichaean deities in the original Syriac writings are in Aramaic. The adaptation of Manichaeism to the Zoroastrian religion appears to have begun in Mani's lifetime however, with his writing of the Middle Persian ''[[Shabuhragan]]'', his book dedicated to the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian emperor]], [[Shapur I]].&lt;ref name="Shabuhragan"/&gt; In it, there are mentions of Zoroastrian divinities such as [[Ahura Mazda]], [[Angra Mainyu]], and Āz. Manichaeism is often presented as a Persian religion, mostly due to the vast number of Middle Persian, Parthian, and [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]] (as well as Turkish) texts discovered by German researchers near [[Turpan]] in what is now [[Xinjiang]], China, during the early 1900s. However, from the vantage point of its original Syriac descriptions (as quoted by Theodore Bar Khonai and outlined above), Manichaeism may be better described as a unique phenomenon of Aramaic Babylonia, occurring in proximity to two other new Aramaic religious phenomena, [[Talmudic Academies in Babylonia|Talmudic Judaism]] and [[Mandaeism]], which also appeared in Babylonia in roughly the third century.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

The original, but now lost, six sacred books of Manichaeism were composed in [[Syriac language|Syriac Aramaic]], and translated into other languages to help spread the religion. As they spread to the east, the Manichaean writings passed through [[Middle Persian]], [[Parthian language|Parthian]], [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]], [[Tocharian languages|Tocharian]], and ultimately [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]] translations. As they spread to the west, they were translated into [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Coptic language|Coptic]], and [[Latin]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Manicheism in Chinese Turkestan and China}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Walter Bruno Henning|Henning]] describes how this translation process evolved and influenced the Manichaeans of Central Asia:
{{quote|Beyond doubt, [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]] was the national language of the Majority of clerics and propagandists of the Manichaean faith in Central Asia. Middle Persian (Pārsīg), and to a lesser degree, Parthian (Pahlavānīg), occupied the position held by [[Medieval Latin|Latin in the medieval church]]. The founder of Manichaeism had employed Syriac (his own language) as his medium, but conveniently he had written at least one book in Middle Persian, and it is likely that he himself had arranged for the translation of some or all of his numerous writings from Syriac into Middle Persian. Thus the Eastern Manichaeans found themselves entitled to dispense with the study of Mani’s original writings, and to continue themselves to reading the Middle Persian edition; it presented small difficulty to them to acquire a good knowledge of the Middle Persian language, owing to its affinity with Sogdian.&lt;ref&gt;W. B. Henning, ''Sogdica'', 1940, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In Iranian tradition, this was one of Mani's holy books that became remembered in later Persian history, and was also called Aržang, a [[Parthian language|Parthian]] word meaning "Worthy", and was beautified with paintings. Therefore, Iranians gave him the title of "The Painter".
* The [[Kephalaia of the Teacher]] (Κεφαλαια), "Discourses", found in Coptic translation.
* ''On the Origin of His Body'', the title of the [[Cologne Mani-Codex]], a Greek translation of an Aramaic book that describes the early life of Mani.&lt;ref name="Mani-Kodex"/&gt;

===Non-Manichaean works preserved by the Manichaean Church===
* Portions of the [[Book of Enoch]] literature such as the [[Book of Giants]]
* Literature relating to the [[Thomas the Apostle|apostle Thomas]] (who by tradition went to India, and was also venerated in Syria), such as portions of the Syriac [[Acts of Thomas|The Acts of Thomas]], and the [[Psalms of Thomas]]. The [[Gospel of Thomas]] was also attributed to Manichaeans by Cyril of Jerusalem, a fourth-century Church Father.&lt;ref&gt;''"Let none read the gospel according to Thomas, for it is the work, not of one of the twelve apostles, but of one of [[Mani (prophet)|Mani's]] three wicked disciples."''—[[Cyril of Jerusalem]], ''Cathechesis'' V (4th century)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The legend of [[Barlaam and Josaphat]] passed from an Indian story about the Buddha, through a Manichaean version, before it transformed into the story of a Christian Saint in the west.

===Later works===
[[File:摩尼教文獻.jpg|thumb|摩尼教文獻 The Chinese Manichaean "Compendium"]]
In later centuries, as Manichaeism passed through [[Greater Iran|eastern Persian-speaking lands]] and arrived at the [[Uyghur Khaganate]] (回鶻帝國), and eventually the Uyghur kingdom of [[Turpan]] (destroyed around 1335), Middle Persian and Parthian prayers (''āfrīwan'' or ''āfurišn'') and the Parthian hymn-cycles (the ''Huwīdagmān'' and ''Angad Rōšnan'' created by [[Mar Ammo]]) were added to the Manichaean writings.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [[Mary Boyce|Boyce, Mary]] ''The Manichaean hymn-cycles in Parthian'' (London Oriental Series, Vol. 3). London: Oxford University Press, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; A translation of a collection of these produced the ''Manichaean Chinese Hymnscroll'' ({{zh|c=摩尼教下部讚|p=Móní-jiào Xiàbù Zàn}}, which Lieu translates as "Hymns for the Lower Section [i.e. the Hearers] of the Manichaean Religion"&lt;ref&gt;Lieu, Samuel N. C., ''Manichaeism in Central Asia and China'', 1998, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;). In addition to containing hymns attributed to Mani, it contains prayers attributed to Mani's earliest disciples, including Mār Zaku, Mār Ammo and Mār Sīsin. Another Chinese work is a complete translation of the ''Sermon of the Light [[Nous]]'', presented as a discussion between Mani and his disciple Adda.&lt;ref&gt;"The Traité is, despite its title (Moni jiao cao jing, lit. "fragmentary [Mathews, no. 6689] Manichean scripture"), a long text in an excellent state of preservation, with only a few lines missing at the beginning. It was first fully published with a facsimile by [[Édouard Chavannes|Edouard Chavannes]] (q.v.) and [[Paul Pelliot]] in 1911 and is frequently known as Traité Pelliot. Their transcription (including typographical errors) was reproduced in the Chinese translation of the [[Taishō Tripiṭaka|Buddhist Tripiṭaka]] (Taishō, no. 2141 B, LIV, pp. 1281a16-1286a29); that text was in turn reproduced with critical notes by Helwig Schmidt-Glintzer (1987b, pp. T. 81–86). A more accurate transcription was published by Chen Yuan in 1923 (pp. 531–44), and a new collation based on a reexamination of the original photographs of the manuscript has now been published by Lin Wu-shu (1987, pp. 217–29), with the photographs", {{iranica|chinese-turkestan-vii|CHINESE TURKESTAN vii. Manicheism in Chinese Turkestan and China}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical and polemic sources===
Until discoveries in the 1900s of original sources, the only sources for Manichaeism were descriptions and quotations from non-Manichaean authors, either Christian, Muslim, Buddhist, or Zoroastrian. While often criticizing Manichaeism, they also quoted directly from Manichaean scriptures. This enabled [[Isaac de Beausobre]], writing in the 18th century, to create a comprehensive work on Manichaeism, relying solely on anti-Manichaean sources.&lt;ref&gt;[[Isaac de Beausobre|de Beausobre, Isaac]], ''Histoire critique de Manichée et du Manichéisme'', 1734–1739, Amsterdam.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus quotations and descriptions in Greek and Arabic have long been known to scholars, as have the long quotations in Latin by Saint Augustine, and the extremely important quotation in Syriac by [[Theodore Bar Konai]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

====Patristic depictions of Mani and Manichæeism====
[[Eusebius]] commented as follows:
{{quotation|''The error of the Manichees, which commenced at this time.''|In the mean time, also, that madman Manes, (Mani is of Persian or Semitic origin) as he was called, well agreeing with his name, for his demoniacal heresy, armed himself by the perversion of his reason, and at the instruction of Satan, to the destruction of many. He was a barbarian in his life, both in speech and conduct, but in his nature as one possessed and insane. Accordingly, he attempted to form himself into a Christ, and then also proclaimed himself to be the very paraclete and the Holy Spirit, and with all this was greatly puffed up with his madness. Then, as if he were Christ, he selected twelve disciples, the partners of his new religion, and after patching together false and ungodly doctrines, collected from a thousand heresies long since extinct, he swept them off like a deadly poison, from Persia, upon this part of the world. Hence the impious name of the Manichaeans spreading among many, even to the present day. Such then was the occasion of this knowledge, as it was falsely called, that sprouted up in these times.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius. ''The Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius Pamphilus, Bishop of Caesarea'', Translated from the originals by Christian Frederick Cruse.1939. Ch. XXXI.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Acta Archelai====
An example of how inaccurate some of these accounts could be is seen in the account of the origins of Manichaeism contained in the ''Acta Archelai''. This was a Greek anti-manichaean work written before 348, most well known in its Latin version, which was regarded as an accurate account of Manichaeism until refuted by Isaac de Beausobre in the 18th century:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the time of the Apostles there lived a man named [[Scythianus]], who is described as coming "from Scythia", and also as being "a Saracen by race" ("ex genere Saracenorum"). He settled in Egypt, where he became acquainted with "the wisdom of the Egyptians", and invented the religious system that was afterwards known as Manichaeism. Finally he emigrated to Palestine, and, when he died, his writings passed into the hands of his sole disciple, a certain [[Terebinthus]]. The latter betook himself to Babylonia, assumed the name of Budda, and endeavoured to propagate his master's teaching. But he, like Scythianus, gained only one disciple, who was an old woman. After a while he died, in consequence of a fall from the roof of a house, and the books that he had inherited from Scythianus became the property of the old woman, who, on her death, bequeathed them to a young man named Corbicius, who had been her slave. Corbicius thereupon changed his name to Manes, studied the writings of Scythianus, and began to teach the doctrines that they contained, with many additions of his own. He gained three disciples, named Thomas, Addas, and Hermas. About this time the son of the Persian king fell ill, and Manes undertook to cure him; the prince, however, died, whereupon Manes was thrown into prison. He succeeded in escaping, but eventually fell into the hands of the king, by whose order he was flayed, and his corpse was hung up at the city gate.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A. A. Bevan, who quoted this story, commented that it "has no claim to be considered historical".&lt;ref&gt;Bevan, A. A. (1930). "Manichaeism". ''Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics'', Volume VIII. Ed. [[James Hastings]]. London.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====View of Judaism in the ''Acta Archelai''=====
According to [[Hegemonius]]' portrayal of Mani, the [[Demiurge#Gnosticism|evil demiurge]] who created the world was the Jewish [[Jehovah]]. Hegemonius reports that Mani said,
{{quote|"It is the [[Prince of darkness (Manichaeism)|Prince of Darkness]] who spoke with [[Moses]], the [[Jews]] and their [[kohen|priests]]. Thus the [[Christian]]s, the Jews, and the Pagans are involved in the same error when they worship this God. For he leads them astray in the lusts he taught them." He goes on to state: "Now, he who spoke with Moses, the Jews, and the priests he says is the [[archon]]t of Darkness, and the Christians, Jews, and pagans (ethnic) are one and the same, as they revere the same god. For in his aspirations he seduces them, as he is not the god of truth. And so therefore all those who put their hope in the god who spoke with Moses and the prophets have (this in store for themselves, namely) to be bound with him, because they did not put their hope in the god of truth. For that one spoke with them (only) according to their own aspirations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Classical Texts: Acta Archelai of Mani |url=http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~iranian/Manicheism/Manicheism_II_Texts.pdf |format=PDF |page=76 |publisher=Iranian Studies at Harvard University}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Central Asian and Iranian primary sources===
In the early 1900s, original Manichaean writings started to come to light when German scholars led by [[Albert Grünwedel]], and then by [[Albert von Le Coq]], began excavating at [[Gaochang]], the ancient site of the Manichaean Uyghur Kingdom near Turpan, in Chinese Turkestan (destroyed around AD 1300). While most of the writings they uncovered were in very poor condition, there were still hundreds of pages of Manichaean scriptures, written in three Iranian languages (Middle Persian, Parthian, and Sogdian) and old Uyghur. These writings were taken back to Germany, and were analyzed and published at the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Preußische Akademie der Wissenschaften]] in Berlin, by Le Coq and others, such as [[Friedrich W. K. Müller]] and [[Walter Bruno Henning]]. While the vast majority of these writings were written in a version of the Syriac script known as [[Manichaean script]], the German researchers, perhaps for lack of suitable fonts, published most of them using the [[Hebrew alphabet]] (which could easily be substituted for the 22 Syriac letters).{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Perhaps the most comprehensive of these publications was ''Manichaeische Dogmatik aus chinesischen und iranischen Texten'' (''Manichaean Dogma from Chinese and Iranian texts''), by [[Ernst Waldschmidt]] and Wolfgang Lentz, published in Berlin in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst Waldschmidt|Waldschmidt, E.]], and Lentz, W., ''Manichäische Dogmatik aus chinesischen und iranischen Texten'' (SPAW 1933, No. 13)&lt;/ref&gt; More than any other research work published before or since, this work printed, and then discussed, the original key Manichaean texts in the original scripts, and consists chiefly of sections from Chinese texts, and Middle Persian and Parthian texts transcribed with the Hebrew alphabet. After the Nazi party gained power in Germany, the Manichaean writings continued to be published during the 1930s, but the publishers no longer used Hebrew letters, instead transliterating the texts into Latin letters.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

===Coptic primary sources===
Additionally, in 1930, German researchers in Egypt found a large body of Manichaean works in Coptic. Though these were also damaged, hundreds of complete pages survived and, beginning in 1933, were analyzed and published in Berlin before World War II, by German scholars such as [[Hans Jakob Polotsky]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Jakob Polotsky]] and Karl Schmidt, ''Ein Mani-Fund in Ägypten, Original-Schriften des Mani und seiner Schüler''. Berlin: Akademie der Wissenschaften 1933.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these Coptic Manichaean writings were lost during the war.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

===Chinese primary sources===
After the success of the German researchers, French scholars visited China and discovered what is perhaps the most complete set of Manichaean writings, written in Chinese. These three Chinese writings, all found at the [[Mogao Caves]] among the [[Dunhuang manuscripts]], and all written before the 9th century, are today kept in London, Paris, and Beijing. Some of the scholars involved with their initial discovery and publication were [[Édouard Chavannes]], [[Paul Pelliot]], and [[Aurel Stein]]. The original studies and analyses of these writings, along with their translations, first appeared in French, English, and German, before and after World War II. The complete Chinese texts themselves were first published in Tokyo, Japan in 1927, in the [[Taishō Tripiṭaka]], volume 54. While in the last thirty years or so they have been republished in both Germany (with a complete translation into German, alongside the 1927 Japanese edition),&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt-Glintzer, Helwig, ''Chinesische Manichaeica'', Wiesbaden, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; and China, the Japanese publication remains the standard reference for the Chinese texts.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

===Greek life of Mani, Cologne codex===
[[File:Kölner Mani-Kodex.jpg|thumb|right|Cologne Mani-Codex]]
In Egypt, a small [[codex]] was found and became known through antique dealers in [[Cairo]]. It was purchased by the [[University of Cologne]] in 1969. Two of its scientists, Henrichs and Koenen, produced the first edition known since as the [[Cologne Mani-Codex]], which was published in four articles in the ''Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik''. The ancient [[papyrus]] manuscript contained a [[Greek language|Greek]] text describing the life of Mani. Thanks to this discovery, much more is known about the man who founded one of the most influential world religions of the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/cologne-mani-codex-parchment |title= Cologne Mani Codex |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Iranica |date= |year= |publisher= |location= |id= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Figurative use ==
The terms "Manichaean" and "Manichaeism" are sometimes used figuratively as a synonym of the more general term "[[Dualistic cosmology|dualist]]" with respect to a philosophy, outlook or worldview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/Manichaean|title=Manichaean - definition of Manichaean in English from the Oxford dictionary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms are often used to suggest that the world view in question simplistically reduces the world to a struggle between good and evil. For example, [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] used the phrase "Manichaean paranoia" in reference to [[POTUS|U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]]'s world view (in ''[[The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]'', March 14, 2007); Brzezinski elaborated that he meant "the notion that he [Bush] is leading the forces of good against the empire of evil". Philosopher [[Frantz Fanon]] frequently invoked the concept of Manicheanism in his discussions of violence between colonizers and the colonized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/fanon/|title=Frantz Fanon|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saint Augustine of Hippo]] was deeply influenced by Manicheanism prior to his conversion to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, Confessions, 5:3-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Author and journalist [[Glenn Greenwald]] followed up on the theme in describing Bush in his book ''[[A Tragic Legacy]]'' (2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://launiusr.wordpress.com/2017/06/28/notes-on-an-important-book-glenn-greenwalds-a-tragic-legacy-how-a-good-vs-evil-mentality-destroyed-the-bush-presidency/|title=Wednesday’s Book Review: “A Tragic Legacy: How a Good vs. Evil Mentality Destroyed the Bush Presidency”|date=2017-06-28|work=Roger Launius's Blog|access-date=2018-11-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the story "[[Memoirs of Hecate County|The Man Who Shot Snapping Turtles]]" (published in ''Memoirs of Hecate County''), [[Edmund Wilson]]'s narrator refers to Asa Stryker's argument as "the Manichaean heresy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/97/11/23/home/wilson-hecate2.html|title=Home|website=archive.nytimes.com|access-date=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is frequently used by critics to describe the attitudes and foreign policies of the present-day [[United States]] and its leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thefederalist.com/2015/07/09/the-revenge-of-the-lost-boys/|title=The Revenge Of The Lost Boys|date=9 July 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/2017/04/ode-philistine-howard-jacobsons-pussy|title=Ode to a philistine: Howard Jacobson's Pussy|website=www.newstatesman.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/obit/2004/10/paul_nitze.html|title=Paul Nitze|first=Fred|last=Kaplan|date=21 October 2004|publisher=|via=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cato.org/events/why-america-misunderstands-world-national-experience-roots-misperception|title=Why America Misunderstands the World: National Experience and Roots of Misperception|date=29 November 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-33440287|title=The decline of US power?|first=Nick|last=Bryant|date=10 July 2015|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com|newspaper=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3460">The '''Manley–Rowe relations''' are [[mathematical expression]]s developed originally for [[electrical engineer]]s to predict the amount of [[energy]] in a wave that has multiple frequencies.

was for an [[electrical circuit]] containing [[nonlinear]] [[capacitor]]s and [[inductor]]s.  One or more [[oscillator]]s, operating at specified frequencies, are connected to the input of this circuit. The Manley–Rowe relations predict the energy present in waves at various frequencies, including new frequencies (such as [[harmonics]] and [[sideband]]s) that arise in the circuit due to [[nonlinearity]]. The theory is based partly on the [[principle of conservation of energy]]. It requires that [[energy storage]] in the circuit is a [[stationary process]] that varies with time only due to the oscillations and not due to some steady increase or decrease with time.

Because the Manley–Rowe relations are based on general concepts like nonlinear [[wave]]s and [[conservation of energy]], their use is not limited to the original application in [[RF engineering|radio-frequency electrical circuit]]s. They have also found use in other scientific fields, for example [[nonlinear optics]].&lt;ref&gt;

In the electrical circuit for the original derivation of Manley–Rowe relations, capacitors and inductors store energy from a wave and then release it. Other physical systems that involve energy storage for waves, and nonlinear generation of new waves, can make use of the same relations.

John Manley and Harrison Rowe were protégés of [[Ralph Hartley]] at Bell Laboratories (although I believe that this information is not related to the Manley–Rowe relations). The work with nonlinear reactances (inductors and capacitors) was started back in 1917 by John Burton and Eugene Peterson.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson E., “Atomic Physics and Circuit Theory”; Bell Laboratories Record, Volume 7, February 1929, pp 231–233&lt;/ref&gt; When Hartley joined Bell Laboratories after being part of Western Electric, he started a research group on nonlinear oscillations. This group was later joined by Peterson, Manley, and Rowe.

{{Refimprove|date=August 2009}}
{{Postmodernism}}

'''Neotribalism''' (a.k.a. '''neo-tribalism''' and '''modern tribalism''') is a sociological concept which postulates that [[human evolution|human beings have evolved]] to live in [[tribalism|tribal society]], as opposed to [[mass society]], and thus will naturally form [[social network]]s constituting new  "[[tribe]]s".

==Sociological theory==
French sociologist [[Michel Maffesoli]] was perhaps the first to use the term ''neotribalism'' in a scholarly context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maffesoli|first=Michel |title=The Time of the Tribes: The Decline of Individualism in Mass Society|year=1996|publisher=Sage|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maffesoli predicted that as the culture and institutions of [[modernism]] declined, societies would embrace [[nostalgia]] and look to the organizational principles of the distant past for guidance, and that therefore the [[post-modern]] era would be the era of neotribalism.

Work by researchers such as American political scientist [[Robert D. Putnam]] and a 2006 study by McPherson, Smith-Lovin and Brasiers published in the ''[[American Sociological Review]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Social Isolation in America: Changes in Core Discussion Networks over Two Decades |url=http://asr.sagepub.com/content/71/3/353.short |last1=McPherson |first1=M. |last2=Smith-Lovin |first2=L. |last3=Brashears |first3=M. E. |year=2006 |work=[[American Sociological Review]] |issue=71 |pages=353–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; seem to support at least the more moderate neotribalist arguments. Data has pointed to a general breakdown in the [[social structure]] of modern [[civilization]] due to more frequent [[Immigration#Economic migrant|moves for economic reasons]], longer [[commuting|commutes]] and a lack of emphasis in the media [[narrative]] on the desirability of strong [[friendship]]s and [[community]] bonds.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

An '''operational definition''' is the articulation of [[operationalization]] (or statement of procedures) used in defining the terms of a process (or set of [[Formal verification|validation tests]]) needed to determine the nature of an item or phenomenon (a [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]], [[terminology|term]], or [[object (philosophy)|object]]) and its properties such as duration, quantity, extension in space, [[chemical composition]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;Adanza, Estela G. (1995) [https://books.google.com/books?id=yNmTHbQiPEUC&amp;pg=PA21 ''Research methods: Principles and Applications''] p.21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sevilla, Consuelo G. ''et al.'' (1992) [https://books.google.com/books?id=SK18tR3vTucC&amp;pg=PA20 ''Research methods''], revised edition p.20&lt;/ref&gt; Since the degree of operationalization can vary itself, it can result in a [[Levels of measurement#Ordinal scale|more or less]] operational definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Shoemaker, Pamela J.|title=How to build social pyramid |publisher=SAGE |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-7619-2667-2 |page=29 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NKs83Ypq5KgC&amp;pg=PA29|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The procedures included in definitions should be repeatable by anyone or at least by [[peer review|peers]].

An example of operational definition of the term ''weight'' of an object, operationalized to a degree, would be the following: "weight is the numbers that appear when that object is placed on a [[weighing scale]]". According to it, the weight can be any of the numbers shown on the scale after, including the very moment the object is put on it. Clearly, the inclusion of the moment when one can start reading the numbers on the scale would make it more fully an operational definition. Nonetheless, it is still in contrast to those purely [[theoretical definition]]s.

[[File:Pbnjmpegman.jpg|thumb|right|300px|An operational definition can, when operationalized to a greater degree, besides the procedure needed to bring something into existence, include also [[measurement|measuring]] the stuff, time sequences at which every step should be done, and the duration of each step.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} Simply stating that a [[peanut butter]] sandwich might be ''"the result of putting peanut butter on a slice of bread with a butter knife and laying a second equally sized slice of vegan milk on top"'' is only [[operationalization|operationalized]] to a degree.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} Besides such a simple [[recipe]] as the one for making the sandwich, the [[sheet music]] is another example of definitions that are operationalized to a certain degree.]]

==Overview==
Properties described in this manner must be sufficiently accessible so that people other than the definer may independently measure or test for them at will.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} An operational definition is generally designed to model a [[theoretical definition]].
The most operational definition is a process for [[Identity (philosophy)|identification]] of an object by distinguishing it from its background of empirical experience.

The binary version produces either the result that the object exists, or that it doesn't, in the experiential field to which it is applied. The [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifier]] version results in discrimination between what is part of the object and what is not part of it. This is also discussed in terms of [[semantics]], [[pattern recognition]], and operational techniques, such as [[Calibration (statistics)|regression]].

Operationalize means to put into operation or use. Operational definitions are also used to define system states in terms of a specific, publicly accessible process of preparation or validation &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/validation|title=the definition of validation|website=www.dictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;testing, which is repeatable at will. For example, 100 degrees Celsius may be crudely defined by describing the process of heating water at sea level until it is observed to boil. An item like a brick, or even a photograph of a brick, may be defined in terms of how it can be made. Likewise, iron may be defined in terms of the results of testing or measuring it in particular ways.

Vandervert (1980/1988) described in scientific detail a simple, everyday illustration of an operational definition in terms of making a cake (i.e., its recipe is an operational definition used in a specialized laboratory known as the household kitchen).&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert, L. (1988). Operational definitions made simple, useful, and lasting. In M. Ware &amp; C. Brewer (Eds.), Handbook for teaching statistics and research methods (pp.&amp;nbsp;132–134). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. (Original work published 1980)&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the saying, ''if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it must be some kind of duck'', may be regarded as involving a sort of measurement process or set of tests (see [[duck test]]).

==Application==
Despite the controversial [[philosophical]] origins of the concept, particularly its close association with [[logical positivism]], operational definitions have undisputed practical applications. This is especially so in the social and medical sciences, where operational definitions of key terms are used to preserve the unambiguous empirical testability of hypothesis and theory. Operational definitions are also important in the [[physical sciences]].

===Philosophy===
The ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' entry on scientific realism, written by [[Richard Boyd]], indicates that the modern concept owes its origin in part to [[Percy Williams Bridgman]], who felt that the expression of scientific concepts was often abstract and unclear. Inspired by [[Ernst Mach]],  in 1914 Bridgman attempted to redefine unobservable entities concretely in terms of the physical and mental operations used to measure them.&lt;ref name=Boyd&gt;{{cite web|last=Boyd|first=Richard|title=Scientific Realism|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2010/entries/scientific-realism/|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the definition of each unobservable entity was uniquely identified with the instrumentation used to define it. From the beginning objections were raised to this approach, in large part around the inflexibility. As Boyd notes, "In actual, and apparently reliable, scientific practice, changes in the instrumentation associated with theoretical terms are routine, and apparently crucial to the progress of science. According to a 'pure' operationalist conception, these sorts of modifications would not be methodologically acceptable, since ''each'' definition must be considered to identify a ''unique'' 'object' (or class of objects)."&lt;ref name=Boyd/&gt; However, this rejection of operationalism as a general project destined ultimately to define all experiential phenomena uniquely did not mean that operational definitions ceased to have any practical use or that they could not be applied in particular cases.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===Science===
The [[theory of relativity|special theory of relativity]] can be viewed as the introduction of operational definitions for [[relativity of simultaneity|simultaneity of events]] and of [[length contraction|distance]], that is, as providing the operations needed to define these terms.&lt;ref name=Woodhouse&gt;{{cite book |title=Special relativity |author=NMJ Woodhouse |page=58 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ggPXQAeeRLgC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=isbn=1852334266#PPA58,M1 |isbn=1-85233-426-6 |publisher=Springer |location=London |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[quantum mechanics]] the notion of operational definitions is closely related to the idea of [[observables]], that is, definitions based upon what can be measured.&lt;ref name=Isham&gt;{{cite book |title=Lectures on Quantum Theory |author= C. J. Isham |page=95 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xR3sS2hEFzcC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq=observable+operational+definition+quantum|isbn=1-86094-001-3 |publisher=Imperial College Press |year=1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Blank&gt;{{cite book |title=Hilbert Space Operators in Quantum Physics |author1=Jiří Blank |author2=Pavel Exner |author3=Miloslav Havlíček |isbn=1-56396-142-3 |publisher=Springer |year=1994 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V0BSIoGXHLQC&amp;pg=PA252&amp;dq=observable+operational+definition+quantum|page=252 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Operational definitions are often most challenging in the fields of [[psychology]] and [[psychiatry]], where intuitive concepts, such as [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] need to be operationally defined before they become amenable to scientific investigation, for example, through processes such as [[IQ test]]s.

===Business===
On October 15, 1970, the [[West Gate Bridge]] in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] collapsed, killing 35 construction workers. The subsequent enquiry found that the failure arose because engineers had specified the supply of a quantity of ''flat steel plate.'' The word ''flat'' in this context lacked an operational definition, so there was no test for accepting or rejecting a particular shipment or for controlling quality.

In his managerial and statistical writings, [[W. Edwards Deming]] placed great importance on the value of using operational definitions in all agreements in business. As he said:

::"An '''operational definition''' is a procedure agreed upon for translation of a concept into measurement of some kind." – W. Edwards Deming

::"There is no true value of any characteristic, state, or condition that is defined in terms of measurement or observation. Change of procedure for measurement (change of '''operational definition''') or observation produces a new number." – W. Edwards Deming

===General process===
'''Operational''', in a process context, also can denote a working method or a philosophy that focuses principally on cause and effect relationships (or stimulus/response, behavior, etc.) of specific interest to a particular domain at a particular point in time. As a working method, it does not consider issues related to a domain that are more general, such as the [[ontological]], etc.

=== In computing ===
Science uses computing. Computing uses science. We have seen the development of Computer Science. There are not many who can bridge all three of these. One effect is that, when results are obtained using a computer, the results can be impossible to replicate if the code is poorly documented, contains errors, or if parts are omitted entirely. &lt;ref&gt;Collberg, C., Roebsting, T. (2016) "Repeability in Computer Systems Research" Communications of the ACM, Vol. 59, No. 3, pages 62–69 (via [http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/3/198873-repeatability-in-computer-systems-research/abstract acm.org])&lt;/ref&gt;

Many times, issues are related to persistence and clarity of use of variables, functions, and so forth. Also, systems dependence is an issue. In brief, length (as a standard) has matter as its definitional basis. What pray tell can be used when standards are to be computationally framed?

Hence, operational definition can be used within the realm of the interactions of humans with advanced computational systems. In this sense, one area of discourse deals with computational thinking in, and with how it might influence, the sciences.&lt;ref&gt;"Computational Thinking in Science" American Scientist, Jan/Feb 2017 (via [http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/2017/1/computational-thinking-in-science My American Scientist])&lt;/ref&gt; To quote the American Scientist: 
* The computer revolution has profoundly affected how we think about science, experimentation, and research.

One referenced project pulled together fluid experts, including some who were expert in the numeric modeling related to computational fluid dynamics, in a team with computer scientists. Essentially, it turned out that the computer guys did not know enough to weigh in as much as they would have liked. Thus, their role, to their chagrin, many times was "mere" programmer.

Some [[knowledge-based engineering]] projects experienced similarly that there is a trade-off between trying to teach programming to a domain expert versus getting a programmer to understand the intricacies of a domain. That, of course, depends upon the domain. In short, any team member has to decide which side of the coin to spend one's time.

The International Society for Technology in Education has a brochure detailing an "operational definition" of computational thinking. At the same time, the ISTE made an attempt at defining related skills.&lt;ref&gt;"Operational Definition of Computational Thinking" (for K–12 Education) 2011 (via [http://www.iste.org/docs/ct-documents/computational-thinking-operational-definition-flyer.pdf website])&lt;/ref&gt;

A recognized skill is tolerance for ambiguity and being able to handle open-ended problems. For instance, a [[knowledge-based engineering]] system can enhance its operational aspect and thereby its stability through more involvement by the [[subject matter expert]], thereby opening up issues of limits that are related to being human. As in, many times, computational results have to be taken at face value due to several factors (hence the [[duck test]]'s necessity arises) that even an expert cannot overcome. The end proof may be the final results (reasonable facsimile by [[simulation]] or [[artifact (observational)|artifact]], working design, etc.) that are not guaranteed to be repeatable, may have been costly to attain (time and money), and so forth.

In advanced modeling, with the requisite computational support such as knowledge-based engineering, mappings must be maintained between a real-world object, its abstracted counterparts as defined by the domain and its experts, and the computer models. Mismatches between domain models and their computational mirrors can raise issues that are apropos to this topic. Techniques that allow the flexible modeling required for many hard problems must resolve issues of identity, type, etc. which then lead to methods, such as duck typing. Many domains, with a [[Numerical analysis|numerics]] focus, use limit theory, of various sorts, to overcome the duck test necessity with varying degrees of success. Yet, with that, issues still remain as representational frameworks bear heavily on what we can know.

In arguing for an object-based methodology, Peter Wegner&lt;ref&gt;Wegner, P. () "Beyond Computable Functions" ''Specification of Parallel Algorithms'' Page 37 American Mathematical Society (via [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg5RyQ1bcPYC&amp;pg=PA37#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Google])&lt;/ref&gt;  suggested that "positivist scientific philosophies, such as operationalism in [[physics]] and behaviorism in psychology" were powerfully applied in the early part of the 20th century. However, computation has changed the landscape. He notes that we need to distinguish four levels of "irreversible physical and computational abstraction" (Platonic abstraction, computational approximation, functional abstraction, and value computation). Then, we must rely on interactive methods, that have behavior as their focus (see duck test).

==Examples==

===Temperature===
The thermodynamic definition of [[temperature]], due to [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot]], refers to heat "flowing" between "infinite reservoirs". This is all highly abstract and unsuited for the day-to-day world of science and trade. In order to make the idea concrete, temperature is defined in terms of operations with the gas thermometer. However, these are sophisticated and delicate instruments, only adapted to the national standardization laboratory.

For day-to-day use, the [[International Temperature Scale of 1990]] (ITS) is used, defining temperature in terms of characteristics of the several specific sensor types required to cover the full range. One such is the [[electrical resistance]] of a [[thermistor]], with specified construction, [[calibration|calibrated]] against operationally defined fixed points.

===Electric current===
[[Electric current]] is defined in terms of the [[force]] between two [[infinity|infinite]] [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] conductors, separated by a specified distance. This definition is too abstract for practical measurement, so a device known as a [[current balance]] is used to define the [[ampere]] operationally.

===Mechanical hardness===
Unlike [[temperature]] and [[electric current]], there is no abstract physical concept of the [[hardness]] of a material. It is a slightly vague, subjective idea, somewhat like the idea of [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]]. In fact, it leads to three more specific ideas:

# Scratch hardness measured on [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs' scale]];
# Indentation hardness; and
# Rebound, or dynamic, hardness measured with a [[Shore scleroscope]].

Of these, indentation hardness itself leads to many operational definitions, the most important of which are:

# [[Brinell hardness test]] – using a 10&amp;nbsp;mm steel ball;
# [[Vickers hardness test]] – using a pyramidal diamond indenter; and
# [[Rockwell hardness test]] – using a diamond cone indenter.

In all these, a process is defined for loading the indenter, measuring the resulting indentation and calculating a hardness number. Each of these three sequences of measurement operations produces numbers that are consistent with our subjective idea of hardness. The harder the material to our informal perception, the greater the number it will achieve on our respective hardness scales. Furthermore, experimental results obtained using these measurement methods has shown that the hardness number can be used to predict the stress required to permanently deform steel, a characteristic that fits in well with our idea of resistance to permanent deformation. However, there is not always a simple relationship between the various hardness scales. Vickers and Rockwell hardness numbers exhibit qualitatively different behaviour when used to describe some materials and phenomena.

===The constellation Virgo===
{{See also|Axial precession}}
The [[Virgo (constellation)|constellation Virgo]] is a specific constellation of stars in the sky, hence the process of forming Virgo cannot be an operational definition, since it is historical and not repeatable. Nevertheless, the process whereby we locate Virgo in the sky ''is'' repeatable, so in this way, Virgo is operationally defined. In fact, Virgo can have any number of definitions (although we can never prove that we are talking about the ''same'' Virgo), and any number may be operational.

===Academic discipline===
New [[academic discipline]]s appear in response to [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] activity at universities. An academic suggested the following operational definition for when a new discipline is recognized:
:'''Discipline''' is a term used to describe a subject matter area when there are more than approximately a dozen university departments using the same name for roughly the same subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rustum Roy]] (1977) "Interdisciplinary science on campus – the elusive dream", [[Chemical and Engineering News]] 55(35): 28–40&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Parking-guidance-system-outdoor-variable-message-sign_ladot-via-fhwa.jpg|thumb|Variable message sign showing people driving where parking spaces are available.]]

'''Parking guidance and information''' ('''PGI''') systems, or '''car park guidance systems''', present drivers with dynamic information on [[parking]] within controlled areas. The systems combine traffic monitoring, communication, processing and [[variable message sign]] technologies to provide the service.

Modern parking lots utilize a variety of technologies to help motorists find unoccupied parking spaces, [[car location]] when returning to the vehicle and improve their experience.  This includes adaptive lighting [[sensor]]s and parking space indicators (red for occupied, green for available and blue is reserved for the disabled; above every parking space), and [[indoor positioning system]] (IPS).

PGI systems are a product of the worldwide initiative for the development of [[intelligent transportation system]] in [[urban areas]]. PGI systems can assist in the development of safe, efficient and environmentally friendly transportation network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Traffic Advisory Leaflet ITS 4/03| work=Parking Guidance and Information | url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roads/tpm/tal/its/parkingguidanceandinformation | accessdate = 13 April 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070206041939/http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roads/tpm/tal/its/parkingguidanceandinformation &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 6 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PGI systems are designed to aid in the search for vacant [[parking space]]s by directing drivers to [[car parks]] where occupancy levels are low. The objective is to reduce search time, which in turn reduces [[Traffic congestion|congestion]] on the surrounding roads for other [[traffic]] with related benefits to [[air pollution]] with the ultimate aim of enhancement of the urban area.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38436">'''Radiometric dating''' or '''radioactive dating''' is a technique used to [[Chronological dating|date]] materials such as [[Rock (geology)|rocks]] or [[carbon]], in which trace radioactive [[impurity|impurities]] were selectively incorporated when they were  formed. The method compares the abundance of a naturally occurring [[Radionuclide|radioactive isotope]] within the material to the abundance of its [[Radioactive decay|decay]] products, which form at a known constant rate of decay.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=radioactive dating|file=R05082}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of radiometric dating was first published in 1907 by [[Bertram Boltwood]]&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | author = Boltwood, Bertram | year = 1907 | title = The Ultimate Disintegration Products of the Radio-active Elements. Part II. The disintegration products of uranium | journal = American Journal of Science | series = 4 | volume = 23 | issue = 134 | pages = 77–88 | doi=10.2475/ajs.s4-23.134.78}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is now the principal source of information about the [[Absolute dating|absolute age]] of rocks and other [[Geology|geological features]], including the age of [[Paleontology|fossilized life forms]] or the [[age of the Earth]] itself, and can also be used to date a wide range of natural and [[Artifact (archaeology)|man-made materials]].

Together with [[Stratigraphy|stratigraphic principles]], radiometric dating methods are used in [[geochronology]] to establish the [[geologic time scale]].&lt;ref&gt;McRae, A. 1998. ''Radiometric Dating and the Geological Time Scale: Circular Reasoning or Reliable Tools?'' [http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dating.html Radiometric Dating and the Geological Time Scale [[TalkOrigins Archive]]]&lt;/ref&gt; Among the best-known techniques are [[radiocarbon dating]], [[potassium–argon dating]] and [[uranium–lead dating]]. By allowing the establishment of geological timescales, it provides a significant source of information about the ages of [[fossil]]s and the deduced rates of [[evolution]]ary change. Radiometric dating is also used to date [[archaeology|archaeological]] materials, including ancient artifacts.

Different methods of radiometric dating vary in the timescale over which they are accurate and the materials to which they can be applied.

==Fundamentals==

===Radioactive decay===
[[Image:Thorium decay chain from lead-212 to lead-208.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Example of a radioactive [[decay chain]] from lead-212 (&lt;sup&gt;212&lt;/sup&gt;Pb) to lead-208 (&lt;sup&gt;208&lt;/sup&gt;Pb) . Each parent nuclide spontaneously decays into a daughter nuclide (the [[decay product]]) via an [[alpha decay|α decay]] or a [[beta decay|β&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; decay]]. The final decay product, lead-208 (&lt;sup&gt;208&lt;/sup&gt;Pb), is stable and can no longer undergo spontaneous radioactive decay.]]
All ordinary [[matter]] is made up of combinations of [[chemical element]]s, each with its own [[atomic number]], indicating the number of [[proton]]s in the [[atomic nucleus]]. Additionally, elements may exist in different [[isotope]]s, with each isotope of an element differing in the number of [[neutron]]s in the nucleus. A particular isotope of a particular element is called a [[nuclide]]. Some nuclides are inherently unstable. That is, at some point in time, an atom of such a nuclide will undergo [[radioactive decay]] and spontaneously transform into a different nuclide. This transformation may be accomplished in a number of different ways, including [[alpha decay]] (emission of [[alpha particle]]s) and [[beta decay]] ([[electron]] emission, [[positron]] emission, or [[electron capture]]). Another possibility is [[spontaneous fission]] into two or more nuclides.

While the moment in time at which a particular nucleus decays is unpredictable, a collection of atoms of a radioactive nuclide decays [[exponential decay|exponentially]] at a rate described by a parameter known as the [[half-life]], usually given in units of years when discussing dating techniques. After one half-life has elapsed, one half of the atoms of the nuclide in question will have decayed into a "daughter" nuclide or [[decay product]]. In many cases, the daughter nuclide itself is radioactive, resulting in a [[decay chain]], eventually ending with the formation of a stable (nonradioactive) daughter nuclide; each step in such a chain is characterized by a distinct half-life. In these cases, usually the half-life of interest in radiometric dating is the longest one in the chain, which is the rate-limiting factor in the ultimate transformation of the radioactive nuclide into its stable daughter. Isotopic systems that have been exploited for radiometric dating have half-lives ranging from only about 10 years (e.g., [[tritium]]) to over 100 billion years (e.g., [[samarium-147]]).&lt;ref name="Bernard-Griffiths1989"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bernard-Griffiths|first1=J.|last2=Groan|first2=G.|editor1-last=Roth|editor1-first=Etienne|editor2-last=Poty|editor2-first=Bernard|title=Nuclear Methods of Dating|date=1989|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=978-0-7923-0188-2|pages=53 – 72|chapter=The samarium–neodymium method}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For most radioactive nuclides, the half-life depends solely on nuclear properties and is essentially a constant. It is not affected by external factors such as [[temperature]], [[pressure]], chemical environment, or presence of a [[magnetic field|magnetic]] or [[electric field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1146/annurev.ns.22.120172.001121 |title=Perturbation of Nuclear Decay Rates |year=1972 |author=Emery, G T |journal=Annual Review of Nuclear Science |volume=22|issue=1 |pages=165–202|bibcode = 1972ARNPS..22..165E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1038/264340a0 |title=Direct test of the constancy of fundamental nuclear constants |year=1976 |author=Shlyakhter, A. I. |journal=Nature |volume=264|issue=5584 |pages=340 |bibcode=1976Natur.264..340S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, B. 1993. ''How to Change Nuclear Decay Rates'' [http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/ParticleAndNuclear/decay_rates.html Usenet Physics FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; The only exceptions are nuclides that decay by the process of electron capture, such as [[beryllium-7]], [[strontium-85]], and [[zirconium-89]], whose decay rate may be affected by local electron density. For all other nuclides, the proportion of the original nuclide to its decay products changes in a predictable way as the original nuclide decays over time. This predictability allows the relative abundances of related nuclides to be used as a [[clock]] to measure the time from the incorporation of the original nuclides into a material to the present.

===Accuracy of radiometric dating===
[[Image:Thermal ionization mass spectrometer.jpg|thumb|[[Thermal ionization mass spectrometer]] used in radiometric dating.]]
The basic equation of radiometric dating requires that neither the parent nuclide nor the daughter product can enter or leave the material after its formation. The possible confounding effects of contamination of parent and daughter isotopes have to be considered, as do the effects of any loss or gain of such isotopes since the sample was created. It is therefore essential to have as much information as possible about the material being dated and to check for possible signs of [[Metasomatism|alteration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/0012-821X(96)00132-X |title=3-D, &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Ar---&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt;Ar geochronology in the Paraná continental flood basalt province |year=1996 |author=Stewart, K,, Turner, S, Kelley, S, Hawkesworh, C Kristein, L and Manotvani, M |journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters |volume=143|issue=1–4 |pages=95–109 |bibcode=1996E&amp;PSL.143...95S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Precision is enhanced if measurements are taken on multiple samples from different locations of the rock body. Alternatively, if several different minerals can be dated from the same sample and are assumed to be formed by the same event and were in equilibrium with the reservoir when they formed, they should form an [[isochron dating|isochron]]. This can reduce the problem of [[contamination]]. In [[uranium–lead dating]], the [[concordia diagram]] is used which also decreases the problem of nuclide loss. Finally, correlation between different isotopic dating methods may be required to confirm the age of a sample. For example, the age of the Amitsoq [[gneiss]]es from western [[Greenland]] was determined to be {{Ma|3.60|million years ago (MA)|error=0.05|round=2}} using uranium–lead dating and {{Ma|3.56|Ma|error=0.10|round=2}} using lead–lead dating, results that are consistent with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dalrymple|first1=G. Brent|title=The age of the earth|date=1994|publisher=Stanford Univ. Press|location=Stanford, Calif.|isbn=9780804723312}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|142&amp;ndash;143}}

Accurate radiometric dating generally requires that the parent has a long enough half-life that it will be present in significant amounts at the time of measurement (except as described below under "Dating with short-lived extinct radionuclides"), the half-life of the parent is accurately known, and enough of the daughter product is produced to be accurately measured and distinguished from the initial amount of the daughter present in the material. The procedures used to isolate and analyze the parent and daughter nuclides must be precise and accurate. This normally involves [[isotope-ratio mass spectrometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dickin|first1=Alan P.|title=Radiogenic isotope geology|date=2008|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521530170|pages=15&amp;ndash;49|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The precision of a dating method depends in part on the half-life of the radioactive isotope involved. For instance, carbon-14 has a half-life of 5,730 years. After an organism has been dead for 60,000 years, so little carbon-14 is left that accurate dating cannot be established. On the other hand, the concentration of carbon-14 falls off so steeply that the age of relatively young remains can be determined precisely to within a few decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Closure temperature===
{{Main article|Closure temperature}}

If a material that selectively rejects the daughter nuclide is heated, any daughter nuclides that have been accumulated over time will be lost through [[diffusion]], setting the isotopic "clock" to zero. The temperature at which this happens is known as the [[closure temperature]] or blocking temperature and is specific to a particular material and isotopic system. These temperatures are experimentally determined in the lab by [[Petrology#Branches|artificially resetting sample minerals]] using a high-temperature furnace. As the mineral cools, the crystal structure begins to form and diffusion of isotopes is less easy. At a certain temperature, the crystal structure has formed sufficiently to prevent diffusion of isotopes. This temperature is what is known as closure temperature and represents the temperature below which the mineral is a closed system to isotopes. Thus an igneous or metamorphic rock or melt, which is slowly cooling, does not begin to exhibit measurable radioactive decay until it cools below the closure temperature. The age that can be calculated by radiometric dating is thus the time at which the rock or mineral cooled to closure temperature.&lt;ref name=Faure&gt;{{Cite book|first=Gunter |last=Faure |title=Principles and applications of geochemistry: a comprehensive textbook for geology students |publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] |location=[[Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey]] |year=1998 |pages= |edition=2nd |isbn=978-0-02-336450-1 |oclc=37783103}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rollinson&gt;{{Cite book|first=Hugh R. |last=Rollinson |title=Using geochemical data: evaluation, presentation, interpretation |publisher=[[Longman]] |location=[[Harlow]] |year=1993 |pages= |isbn=978-0-582-06701-1 |oclc=27937350}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dating of different minerals and/or isotope systems (with differing closure temperatures) within the same rock can therefore enable the tracking of the thermal history of the rock in question with time, and thus the history of metamorphic events may become known in detail. This field is known as [[thermochronology]] or thermochronometry.

The equation is most conveniently expressed in terms of the measured quantity ''N''(''t'') rather than the constant initial value ''N&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;''.

The above equation makes use of information on the composition of parent and daughter isotopes at the time the material being tested cooled below its closure temperature.

==Modern dating methods==
Radiometric dating has been carried out since 1905 when it was [[Age of the Earth#Invention of radiometric dating|invented]] by [[Ernest Rutherford]] as a method by which one might determine the [[age of the Earth]]. In the century since then the techniques have been greatly improved and expanded.&lt;ref name=usgs/&gt; Dating can now be performed on samples as small as a nanogram using a [[mass spectrometer]]. The mass spectrometer was invented in the 1940s and began to be used in radiometric dating in the 1950s. It operates by generating a beam of [[ion|ionized atoms]] from the sample under test. The ions then travel through a magnetic field, which diverts them into different sampling sensors, known as "[[Faraday cup]]s", depending on their mass and level of ionization. On impact in the cups, the ions set up a very weak current that can be measured to determine the rate of impacts and the relative concentrations of different atoms in the beams.

===Uranium–lead dating method===

[[Uranium–lead radiometric dating]] involves using uranium-235 or uranium-238 to date a substance's absolute age. This scheme has been refined to the point that the error margin in dates of rocks can be as low as less than two million years in two-and-a-half billion years.&lt;ref name=Oberthuer/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2004.12.003 |title=The age and petrology of the Chimbadzi Hill Intrusion, NW Zimbabwe: first evidence for early Paleoproterozoic magmatism in Zimbabwe |year=2004 |first=Tawanda D. |last=Manyeruke |author2=Thomas G.

Uranium–lead dating is often performed on the [[mineral]] [[zircon]] (ZrSiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), though it can be used on other materials, such as [[baddeleyite]], as well as [[monazite]] (see: [[monazite geochronology]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.2113/104.1.13 |title=SHRIMP baddeleyite and zircon ages for an Umkondo dolerite sill, Nyanga Mountains, Eastern Zimbabwe |year=2001 |first=M.T.D. |last=Wingate |journal=South African Journal of Geology |volume=104|issue=1 |pages=13–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zircon and baddeleyite incorporate uranium atoms into their crystalline structure as substitutes for [[zirconium]], but strongly reject lead. Zircon has a very high closure temperature, is resistant to mechanical weathering and is very chemically inert. Zircon also forms multiple crystal layers during metamorphic events, which each may record an isotopic age of the event. ''In situ'' micro-beam analysis can be achieved via laser [[ICP-MS]] or [[Secondary ion mass spectrometry|SIMS]] techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.286.5448.2289 |title=Isotope Geochemistry: New Tools for Isotopic Analysis |date=December 1999 |first=Trevor |last=Ireland |journal=Science |volume=286 |issue=5448 |pages=2289–2290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of its great advantages is that any sample provides two clocks, one based on uranium-235's decay to lead-207 with a half-life of about 700 million years, and one based on uranium-238's decay to lead-206 with a half-life of about 4.5 billion years, providing a built-in crosscheck that allows accurate determination of the age of the sample even if some of the lead has been lost. This can be seen in the concordia diagram, where the samples plot along an errorchron (straight line) which intersects the concordia curve at the age of the sample.

===Samarium–neodymium dating method===
{{Main article|Samarium–neodymium dating}}

This involves the [[alpha decay]] of &lt;sup&gt;147&lt;/sup&gt;Sm to &lt;sup&gt;143&lt;/sup&gt;Nd with a [[half-life]] of 1.06 x 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; years. Accuracy levels of within twenty million years in ages of two-and-a-half billion years are achievable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0012-821X(98)00228-3 |title=A multielement geochronologic study of the Great Dyke, Zimbabwe: significance of the robust and reset ages |date=December 1998 |first=S.

===Potassium–argon dating method===
{{Main article|Potassium–argon dating}}

This involves [[electron capture]] or [[positron]] decay of potassium-40 to argon-40. Potassium-40 has a half-life of 1.3 billion years, and so this method is applicable to the oldest rocks. Radioactive potassium-40 is common in [[mica]]s, [[feldspar]]s, and [[hornblende]]s, though the closure temperature is fairly low in these materials, about 350&amp;nbsp;°C (mica) to 500&amp;nbsp;°C (hornblende).

===Rubidium–strontium dating method===
{{Main article|Rubidium–strontium dating}}

This is based on the beta decay of [[rubidium-87]] to [[strontium-87]], with a half-life of 50 billion years. This scheme is used to date old [[igneous rock|igneous]] and [[metamorphic rock]]s, and has also been used to date [[moon rock|lunar samples]]. Closure temperatures are so high that they are not a concern. Rubidium-strontium dating is not as precise as the uranium-lead method, with errors of 30 to 50 million years for a 3-billion-year-old sample.

===Uranium–thorium dating method===
{{Main article|Uranium–thorium dating}}

A relatively short-range dating technique is based on the decay of uranium-234 into thorium-230, a substance with a half-life of about 80,000 years. It is accompanied by a sister process, in which uranium-235 decays into protactinium-231, which has a half-life of 32,760 years.

While [[uranium]] is water-soluble, [[thorium]] and [[protactinium]] are not, and so they are selectively precipitated into ocean-floor [[sediment]]s, from which their ratios are measured. The scheme has a range of several hundred thousand years. A related method is [[ionium–thorium dating]], which measures the ratio of [[ionium]] (thorium-230) to thorium-232 in ocean sediment.

===Radiocarbon dating method===
{{Main article|Radiocarbon dating}}
[[Image:Ales stenar bred.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|right|[[Ale's Stones]] at Kåseberga, around ten kilometres south east of [[Ystad]], [[Sweden]] were dated at 56 CE using the carbon-14 method on organic material found at the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.raa.se/cms/extern/en/places_to_visit/our_historical_sites/ales_stenar.html |title=Ales stenar |publisher=The Swedish National Heritage Board |date=11 October 2006 |accessdate=9 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331132307/http://www.raa.se/cms/extern/en/places_to_visit/our_historical_sites/ales_stenar.html |archivedate=31 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;]] [[Radiocarbon dating]] is also simply called Carbon-14 dating. Carbon-14 is a radioactive isotope of carbon, with a half-life of 5,730 years,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clark |first=R. M. |year=1975 |title=A calibration curve for radiocarbon dates |journal=Antiquity |volume=49 |pages=251–266 |url=http://www.antiquity.ac.uk/ant/049/Ant0490251.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.5194/angeo-20-115-2002 |first=S.

Carbon-14, though, is continuously created through collisions of neutrons generated by [[cosmic rays]] with nitrogen in the [[upper atmosphere]] and thus remains at a near-constant level on Earth. The carbon-14 ends up as a trace component in atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

A carbon-based life form acquires carbon during its lifetime. Plants acquire it through [[photosynthesis]], and animals acquire it from consumption of plants and other animals. When an organism dies, it ceases to take in new carbon-14, and the existing isotope decays with a characteristic half-life (5730 years). The proportion of carbon-14 left when the remains of the organism are examined provides an indication of the time elapsed since its death. This makes carbon-14 an ideal dating method to date the age of bones or the remains of an organism. The carbon-14 dating limit lies around 58,000 to 62,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Wolfango |last=Plastino |author2=Lauri Kaihola |author3=Paolo Bartolomei |author4=Francesco Bella |year=2001 |title=Cosmic background reduction in the radiocarbon measurement by scintillation spectrometry at the underground laboratory of Gran Sasso |url=http://digitalcommons.library.arizona.edu/objectviewer?o=http%3A%2F%2Fradiocarbon.library.arizona.edu%2FVolume43%2FNumber2A%2Fazu_radiocarbon_v43_n2A_157_161_v.pdf |journal=Radiocarbon |volume=43 |issue=2A |pages=157–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rate of creation of carbon-14 appears to be roughly constant, as cross-checks of carbon-14 dating with other dating methods show it gives consistent results. However, local eruptions of [[volcano]]es or other events that give off large amounts of carbon dioxide can reduce local concentrations of carbon-14 and give inaccurate dates. The releases of carbon dioxide into the [[biosphere]] as a consequence of [[industrialization]] have also depressed the proportion of carbon-14 by a few percent; conversely, the amount of carbon-14 was increased by above-ground [[nuclear bomb]] tests that were conducted into the early 1960s. Also, an increase in the [[solar wind]] or the Earth's [[magnetic field]] above the current value would depress the amount of carbon-14 created in the atmosphere.

===Fission track dating method===
{{Main article|fission track dating}}
[[Image:Apatite Canada.jpg|thumb|[[Apatite]] crystals are widely used in fission track dating.]]
This involves inspection of a polished slice of a material to determine the density of "track" markings left in it by the [[spontaneous fission]] of uranium-238 impurities. The uranium content of the sample has to be known, but that can be determined by placing a plastic film over the polished slice of the material, and bombarding it with [[thermal neutrons|slow neutrons]]. This causes induced fission of &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U, as opposed to the spontaneous fission of &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U. The fission tracks produced by this process are recorded in the plastic film. The uranium content of the material can then be calculated from the number of tracks and the [[neutron flux]].

This scheme has application over a wide range of geologic dates. For dates up to a few million years [[mica]]s, [[tektite]]s (glass fragments from volcanic eruptions), and meteorites are best used. Older materials can be dated using [[zircon]], [[apatite]], [[titanite]], [[epidote]] and [[garnet]] which have a variable amount of uranium content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0899-5362(01)80066-X |title=A titanite fission track profile across the southeastern Archæan Kaapvaal Craton and the Mesoproterozoic Natal Metamorphic Province, South Africa: evidence for differential cryptic Meso- to Neoproterozoic tectonism |date=August 2001 |first=J. |last=Jacobs |author2=R. J. Thomas |journal=Journal of African Earth Sciences |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=323–333|bibcode = 2001JAfES..33..323J }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the fission tracks are healed by temperatures over about 200&amp;nbsp;°C the technique has limitations as well as benefits. The technique has potential applications for detailing the thermal history of a deposit.

===Chlorine-36 dating method===
Large amounts of otherwise rare [[chlorine-36|&lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;Cl]] (half-life ~300ky) were produced by irradiation of seawater during atmospheric detonations of [[nuclear weapon]]s between 1952 and 1958. The residence time of &lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;Cl in the atmosphere is about 1 week. Thus, as an event marker of 1950s water in soil and ground water, &lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;Cl is also useful for dating waters less than 50 years before the present. &lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;Cl has seen use in other areas of the geological sciences, including dating ice and sediments.

===Luminescence dating methods===
{{Main article|Luminescence dating}}

Luminescence dating methods are not radiometric dating methods in that they do not rely on abundances of isotopes to calculate age. Instead, they are a consequence of [[background radiation]] on certain minerals. Over time, [[ionizing radiation]] is absorbed by mineral grains in sediments and archaeological materials such as [[quartz]] and [[potassium feldspar]]. The radiation causes charge to remain within the grains in structurally unstable "electron traps". Exposure to sunlight or heat releases these charges, effectively "bleaching" the sample and resetting the clock to zero. The trapped charge accumulates over time at a rate determined by the amount of background radiation at the location where the sample was buried. Stimulating these mineral grains using either light ([[optically stimulated luminescence]] or infrared stimulated luminescence dating) or heat ([[thermoluminescence dating]]) causes a luminescence signal to be emitted as the stored unstable electron energy is released, the intensity of which varies depending on the amount of radiation absorbed during burial and specific properties of the mineral.

These methods can be used to date the age of a sediment layer, as layers deposited on top would prevent the grains from being "bleached" and reset by sunlight. Pottery shards can be dated to the last time they experienced significant heat, generally when they were fired in a kiln.

==Dating with decay products of short-lived extinct radionuclides==
Absolute radiometric dating requires a measurable fraction of parent nucleus to remain in the sample rock. For rocks dating back to the beginning of the solar system, this requires extremely long-lived parent isotopes, making measurement of such rocks' exact ages imprecise. To be able to distinguish the relative ages of rocks from such old material, and to get a better time resolution than that available from long-lived isotopes, short-lived isotopes that are no longer present in the rock can be used.&lt;ref&gt;Imke de Pater and Jack J. Lissauer: ''Planetary Sciences'', page 321. Cambridge University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-521-48219-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the solar system, there were several relatively short-lived radionuclides like &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al, &lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Fe, &lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;Mn, and &lt;sup&gt;129&lt;/sup&gt;I present within the solar nebula. These radionuclides—possibly produced by the explosion of a supernova—are extinct today, but their decay products can be detected in very old material, such as that which constitutes [[meteorite]]s. By measuring the decay products of extinct radionuclides with a [[mass spectrometer]] and using isochronplots, it is possible to determine relative ages of different events in the early history of the solar system. Dating methods based on extinct radionuclides can also be calibrated with the U-Pb method to give absolute ages. Thus both the approximate age and a high time resolution can be obtained. Generally a shorter half-life leads to a higher time resolution at the expense of timescale.

Samples are exposed to neutrons in a nuclear reactor.  This converts the only stable isotope of iodine (&lt;sup&gt;127&lt;/sup&gt;I) into &lt;sup&gt;128&lt;/sup&gt;Xe via neutron capture followed by beta decay (of &lt;sup&gt;128&lt;/sup&gt;I).  After irradiation, samples are heated in a series of steps and the xenon [[isotopic signature]] of the gas evolved in each step is analysed.  When a consistent  &lt;sup&gt;129&lt;/sup&gt;Xe/&lt;sup&gt;128&lt;/sup&gt;Xe ratio is observed across several consecutive temperature steps, it can be interpreted as corresponding to a time at which the sample stopped losing xenon.

Samples of a meteorite called Shallowater are usually included in the irradiation to monitor the conversion efficiency from &lt;sup&gt;127&lt;/sup&gt;I to &lt;sup&gt;128&lt;/sup&gt;Xe.  The difference between the measured &lt;sup&gt;129&lt;/sup&gt;Xe/&lt;sup&gt;128&lt;/sup&gt;Xe ratios of the sample and Shallowater then corresponds to the different ratios of &lt;sup&gt;129&lt;/sup&gt;I/&lt;sup&gt;127&lt;/sup&gt;I when they each stopped losing xenon.  This in turn corresponds to a difference in age of closure in the early solar system.

===The &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al – &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Mg chronometer===
Another example of short-lived extinct radionuclide dating is the [[Aluminium-26|&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al]] – &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Mg chronometer, which can be used to estimate the relative ages of [[chondrules]]. &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al decays to &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Mg with a [[half-life]] of 720 000 years. The dating is simply a question of finding the deviation from the [[natural abundance]] of &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Mg (the product of &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al decay) in comparison with the ratio of the stable isotopes &lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;Al/&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;Mg.

The excess of &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Mg (often designated &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Mg* ) is found by comparing the &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Mg/&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;Mg ratio to that of other Solar System materials.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander N. Krot(2002) Dating the Earliest Solids in our Solar System, Hawai'i Institute of Geophysics and Planetology http://www.psrd.hawaii.edu/Sept02/isotopicAges.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

The &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al – &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Mg chronometer gives an estimate of the time period for formation of primitive meteorites of only a few million years (1.4 million years for Chondrule formation).&lt;ref&gt;Imke de Pater and Jack J.

The expression '''''to earn one's red wings''''' means to perform [[cunnilingus]] on a [[Menstruation|menstruating]] partner.&lt;ref name="court"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hendley"/&gt; The phrase is a reference to menstrual blood stains in the shape of a small bird's wings that are liable to form on the giving partner's cheeks during the act.&lt;ref name="Hendley"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hendley| first=Nate |date=23 December 2009 |title=American Gangsters, Then and Now: An Encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.co.il/books?id=yQqSToDPO5sC&amp;dq=earning+red+wings&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |location= |publisher=ABC-CLIO |page=94 |isbn=0313354529 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fritscher| first1=John |last2=Fritscher |first2=Jack |date=1973 |title=Popular Witchcraft |url=https://books.google.co.il/books?id=hiwvAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=earn+red+wings+cunnilingus&amp;dq=earn+red+wings+cunnilingus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiYmurE0ZzZAhXEL8AKHR1KAMEQ6AEITjAH |location= |publisher=Citadel Press |page=131 |isbn=0806503807 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Victor de Riqueti, marquis de Mirabeau|The elder Mirabeau]], in his ‘’Erotika Biblion’’ of 1783,&lt;ref&gt;A Wyngaard, ''Bad Books'' (2013) p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; saw cunnilingus during menstruation as an extreme act, linked with the submissive worship of the [[Mother goddess]],&lt;ref&gt;J Fritscher, ''Popular Wtchcraft'' (2004) p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; and by extension to the [[Black Mass]].&lt;ref&gt;G Legman, ''Rationale of the Dirty Joke Vol II'' (Herts 1973) p. 192-3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biker culture==
The red wing patch was common among the [[Hells Angels]] by the mid-[[Sixties]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Hunter S. Thompson]], ''Hell's Angels'' (1966) Ch. 10&lt;/ref&gt; and the slang term continued to be known among [[biker gang]]s in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="court"&gt;''[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=lzBOAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=earn+red+wings+cunnilingus&amp;dq=earn+red+wings+cunnilingus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiYmurE0ZzZAhXEL8AKHR1KAMEQ6AEINzAD  North Carolina Reports: Cases Argued and Determined in the Supreme Court of North Carolina]'', volume 304. Published by Edwards &amp; Broughton, in 1981. P.454.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gershon Legman]] saw the act/badge not only as functioning a [[Homosociality|homosocial]] tie, but also as reflecting a deep and primitive belief in the lifegiving powers of blood.&lt;ref&gt;G Legman, ''Rationale of the Dirty Joke Vol II'' (Herts 1973) p. 195-200&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical perspective==

Cunnilingus during menstruation is high risk for the partner performing cunnilingus because there may be a high concentration of virus in menstrual blood,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pinsky| first1=Laura | last2=Douglas | first2=Paul Harding | last3=Metroka | first3=Craig | date=1992 |title=The Essential HIV Treatment Fact Book |url=https://books.google.co.il/books?id=Uz9KQRjWNToC&amp;dq=cunnilingus+during+menstruation&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |location= |publisher=Simon and Schuster |page=105 |isbn=0671725289 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[hepatitis B]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Newman| first1=Felice | date=1 January 1999 |title=The Whole Lesbian Sex Book: A Passionate Guide for All of Us |url=https://books.google.co.il/books?id=l5s4qoozxPcC&amp;q=cunnilingus+during+menstruation&amp;dq=cunnilingus+during+menstruation&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjgiq2o0pzZAhVMGsAKHddyBHgQ6AEIUjAH |location= |publisher=Cleis Press |page=241 |isbn=1573440884 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6378">'''Science information on Wikipedia''' includes the information which Wikipedia presents about science. It critiques and discusses the impact and quality of that information, and the culture of Wikipedia editors, scientists, and layman engagement with this information.

==Impact==
A 2017 study found evidence that Wikipedia's popularity as the most popular general information source has influenced how everyone talks and writes about science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thompson|first1=Neil|last2=Hanley|first2=Douglas|title=Science Is Shaped by Wikipedia: Evidence from a Randomized Control Trial|journal=[[Social Science Research Network]]|date=19 September 2017|issue=MIT Sloan Research Paper No. 5238-17.|url=https://ssrn.com/abstract=3039505}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zastrow|first1=Mark|title=Wikipedia shapes language in science papers|url=https://www.nature.com/news/wikipedia-shapes-language-in-science-papers-1.22656|website=Nature|publisher=[[Nature Publishing Group]]|language=en|doi=10.1038/nature.2017.22656|date=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 study found evidence that Wikipedia increases the distribution and impact of [[open access]] science publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Teplitskiy|first1=Misha|last2=Lu|first2=Grace|last3=Duede|first3=Eamon|title=Amplifying the impact of open access: Wikipedia and the diffusion of science|journal=Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology|date=September 2017|volume=68|issue=9|pages=2116–2127|doi=10.1002/asi.23687|arxiv=1506.07608}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[UNESCO]] reports that Wikipedia is a popular source of science information because Wikipedia has high ranking in [[search engines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Natural Sciences Sector|title=The UNESCO Science Report finds a new public on Wikipedia|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/science-technology/single-view-sc-policy/news/the_unesco_science_report_finds_a_new_public_on_wikipedia/|website=[[UNESCO]]|publisher=[[United Nations]]|language=en|date=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 study examined the way that Wikipedia integrates new scientific information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Benjakob |first1=Omer |last2=Aviram |first2=Rona |title=A Clockwork Wikipedia: From a Broad Perspective to a Case Study |journal=Journal of Biological Rhythms |date=17 April 2018 |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=233–244 |doi=10.1177/0748730418768120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editors==
In 2016 the [[Wiki Education Foundation]] and the [[Simons Foundation]] presented an outreach program called the "Year of Science". In this program, Wikipedia educators visited academic conferences and invited scientists to contribute information from their field of expertise to Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[Simons Foundation]]|title=Mind the Gaps: Improving the Science on Wikipedia|url=https://www.simonsfoundation.org/2017/03/01/mind-the-gaps-improving-the-science-on-wikipedia/|website=Simons Foundation|date=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some universities have programs to encourage students to edit Wikipedia's science articles as part of the learning experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Neal|first1=Meghan|title=Science Students Are Writing Wikipedia Articles Instead of Term Papers|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/qkjbbw/science-students-are-writing-wikipedia-articles-instead-of-term-papers|website=[[Vice (magazine)|Motherboard]]|language=en-us|date=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wikipedia community invites academics to edit Wikipedia articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shafee|first1=Thomas|last2=Mietchen|first2=Daniel|last3=Su|first3=Andrew I.|title=Academics can help shape Wikipedia|journal=Science|date=11 August 2017|volume=357|issue=6351|pages=557.2–558|doi=10.1126/science.aao0462|bibcode=2017Sci...357..557S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various academic societies have encouraged their membership to edit Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goldstein|first1=Evan B.|title=Three Reasons Why Earth Scientists Should Edit Wikipedia|url=https://eos.org/opinions/three-reasons-why-earth-scientists-should-edit-wikipedia|website=Eos|publisher=[[American Geophysical Union]]|date=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quality==
A 2005 study published in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' compared 40 Wikipedia articles on science topics to their ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' counterpart. Subject experts found four "serious errors" in each encyclopedia. They also found 162 less serious problems in Wikipedia, and 123 in ''Britannica''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/study-wikipedia-as-accurate-as-britannica/|title=Study: Wikipedia as accurate as Britannica|work=CNET|access-date=2018-01-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[popular science]] writer for ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' complained in 2017 that Wikipedia's science articles were too technical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Byrne|first1=Michael|title=Wikipedia’s Science Articles Are Elitist|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/ne7xzq/wikipedias-science-articles-are-elitist|website=[[Vice (magazine)|Motherboard]]|language=en-us|date=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various scientists and media organizations have questioned and critiqued the extent to which Wikipedia articles on science influence political decisions relating to science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lucassen|first=Teun|last2=Dijkstra|first2=Roald|last3=Schraagen|first3=Jan Maarten|date=2012-08-20|title=Readability of Wikipedia|url=http://journals.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/3916|journal=First Monday|language=en|volume=0|issue=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clark|first1=Liat|title=Wikipedia wars are harming politically charged science|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/wikipedia-wars-are-killing-politically-charged-science|website=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Collins|first1=Nathan|title=The Political Controversy of Wikipedia Science Articles|url=https://psmag.com/environment/according-to-wikipedia-acid-rain-is-a-load-of-bullshit|website=[[Pacific Standard]]|language=en|date=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''secondary city''' often follows after a [[primate city]] and can be seen in the [[urban hierarchy]].
Secondary cities have between “500,000 to 3 million inhabitants, but are often unknown outside of their national or regional context. Many secondary cities in the [[Global South]] are expected to undergo massive expansions in the next few decades, comparable to city growth in Europe and North America over the past two centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Alfredo Brillembourg &amp; Hubert Klumpner, "[http://www.nsl.ethz.ch/index.php/content/view/full/2582 Gran Horizonte: Taking a Walk in the Urban Planet]", Network City and Landscape. Accessed September 14, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

"A secondary city is largely determined by population, size, function, and economic status. Commonly, secondary cities are geographically defined urban jurisdictions or centres performing vital governance, logistical, and production functions at a sub-national or sub-metropolitan region level within a system of cities in a country. In some cases, their role and functions may expand to a geographic region of the global realm. The population of secondary-cities range between 10 and 50% of a country's largest city, although some can be smaller than this. They will likely constitute a sub-national or sub-metropolitan second-tier level of government, acting as centres for public administration and delivery of education, knowledge, health, community, and security services; an industrial centre or development growth pole; a new national capital; or a large city making up a cluster of smaller cities in a large metropolitan region."&lt;ref name=Roberts2014&gt;Roberts B. and Hohmann R. (2014), [http://www.citiesalliance.org/sites/citiesalliance.org/files/CIVIS%20SECONDARY%20CITIES_Final.pdf The Systems of Secondary Cities - The neglected drivers of urbanizing economies], CIVIS #7, Cities Alliance: Brussels&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, secondary cities “usually form more recent poles of growth, often also with a more diffuse genealogy, than larger metropoles. The ambivalent situation of these towns (in the periphery of the center and in the center of the periphery, in so far as these notions still retain their meaning) generates a particular, and by definition highly hybrid, socio-cultural urban dynamic which in turn influences the outlook of social, political and economic life in the more visible national metropoles.”&lt;ref&gt;Ann Cassiman, Filip De Boeck, Steven Van Wolputte,(2009, September), ''Recentering the City: An Anthropology of Secondary Cities in Africa.'' Institute for Anthropological Research in Africa (IARA), University of Leuven, Belgium.&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondary cities have their own socio-economic and political culture that may differ from other cities such as Primate cites. Moreover, in the '''secondary city''' (and more generally in the margin of the state) there often is more room for improvisation. Local commerce, trading routes and smuggling networks determine the economic sphere in important ways; local forms of associational life (the middle ground of ‘civil society’) has a far greater influence on local politics than is the case in larger urban centers, and the functioning of local, decentralized political authorities is often shaped and cross-cut to a far greater extent by constantly shifting alliances between local stakeholders.”&lt;ref&gt;Dennis A. Rondinelli, "Dynamics of Growth of Secondary Cities in Developing Countries". In ''Geographical Review'', American Geographical Society, '''Vol. 73''', No. 1 (Jan., 1983), pp. 42-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
According to [[UN-HABITAT]], "slum population now expands annually by 25 million. In 1950 there were 86 cities in the world with a population over one million, today there are 400, and by 2015, there will be at least 550."&lt;ref&gt;UN Population Division,''[https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/wup2007/2007WUP_Highlights_web.pdf World urbanization prospects]'', 2007 Revision, New York 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, cities have absorbed nearly two-thirds of the global population explosion since 1950 and are currently growing by a million babies and migrants each week.&lt;ref&gt;''Population information program, population reports: meeting the urban challenge,'' '''Vol. xxx''', No. 4, fall 2002, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Consequently, countries like India are developing secondary cities to absorb informals—as India's chief economic planner, Montek singh Ahluwalia in 2007, observes: "One hundred million people are moving to cities in the next 10 years, and it’s important that these 100 million are absorbed into second-tier cities instead of showing up in Delhi or Mumbai."&lt;ref&gt;Anand Giridharadas,"[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/13/world/asia/13nagpur.html?_r=0 Second Tier’ City to Rise Fast Under India’s Urban Plan]", New York Times, May 13, 2007. Accessed September 14, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In Latin America, where primary cities long monopolized growth, secondary cities like Tijuana, Curitiba, Temuco, Salvador and Belem are now booming, "with the fastest growth of all occurring cities with between 100,000 and 500,000 inhabitants."&lt;ref&gt;Miguel villa and Jorge Rodriguez, "Demographic trends in Latin America’s metropolises,1950-1990", in Alan Gilbert, ''The mega-city in Latin America'', Tokyo 1996, pp. 33-34&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, China "may still be under the radar for many westerners but China's second and third-level cities will rise in profile over the next few years."&lt;ref&gt;The Travel and Expense News Source, [http://www.berteloot.com/2013/02/02/special-report-chinas-secondary-cities/ "Special Report: China's Secondary Cities"], February 2, 2013. Accessed September 14, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; New city developments by governments and other organizations are now focusing on secondary cities. Sociologist [[Saskia Sassen]] suggests that “small cities can be a global platform for companies' global expansion.”&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.forbes.com/2008/10/23/cities-world-ten-forbeslife-cx_mw_1023cities.html World's Next Great Cities]", Forbes, October 23, 2010. Accessed September 14, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in China, "[t]he world's top hotel companies are clambering to open properties in China's second- and third-tier cities across all their brands. The sheer size of even tertiary cities, coupled with the growth in domestic travel and the potential gains of modern, international meeting facilities, has led to hotel development at unprecedented levels."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cei.asia/Article/308459,big-hotel-openings-in-chinas-secondary-cities.aspx Big Hotel openings in China's Secondary Cities], CEI Asia, July 12, 2012. Accessed September 14, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; These new developments are tying to integrate secondary cities into the global and local economy as well from the examples that are seen from China. Another development is that [[China Eastern Airlines]] has increased its number of flights to secondary cities in China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businesstraveller.asia/asia-pacific/news/china-eastern-linking-up-secondary-chinese-cities China Eastern links secondary Chinese cities], ''Business Traveller'', November 18, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== Importance ==
According to the World Bank, secondary Cities make up almost 40% of the world cities population. Nearly two-thirds of these are located in Africa and Asia: "They form an important part of an emerging global system of cities."&lt;ref&gt;World Bank, ''Systems of Cities Integrating National and Local Policies Connecting Institutions and Infrastructures.'' 2009, World Bank: Washington.&lt;/ref&gt; While the large cities play a significant role in shaping the new economic geography of cities in fostering global trade, travel and investment, it is secondary cities which will have a much stronger influence in the future upon the economic development of countries."&lt;ref name=Roberts2014a&gt;Roberts B. and Hohmann R. (2014), [https://www.conftool.com/landandpoverty2014/index.php/Roberts-348_paper.doc?page=downloadPaper&amp;filename=Roberts-348_paper.doc&amp;form_id=348&amp;form_version=final Secondary Cities: Managing Urban Land Governance Systems]. Paper presented at the World Bank and Land Poverty 2014: Uses of Spatial Data in Urban Management&lt;/ref&gt;

===Categories===
Secondary cities fall into three categories or typologies:

# Sub-national cities being centres of local government, industry, agriculture, tourism and mining; 
# City cluster development associated with expanded, satellite and new town cities which surround large urban metropolitan regions, and; 
# Economic trade corridors which are urban growth centre or poles planned or developing along major transport corridors.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts B. (2014) The Systems of Secondary Cities. Definition, Trends and Policy Responses in International Development. Cities Alliance: Brussels&lt;/ref&gt;

"While the industrial revolution and 20th century national self-sufficiency industrialization policies, were to have a profound impact in shaping the development of countries, the current thrust of globalization is changing the dynamics and development of cities, especially developing cities, in ways few would have envisaged half a century ago. There is now growing levels of functional specialization and linkages occurring within the system of secondary cities. The new economic geography has increased competition in small, medium sized cities from international producers and markets. Growing specialization of production systems, supply chains, SMART logistics and inter-modal transfer systems, and the externalization of decision making by expanded consultation, decision-making and investment decisions well outside local government jurisdictions."&lt;ref name=Roberts2014a/&gt; If the efficiency of secondary cities were to improve this could double or triple the GDP of many poor cities and rural regions. In the countries where there is a less distorted system of secondary cities, countries that are not dominated by one mega city, there is generally lower levels of regional development disparities, higher levels of national productivity and income per capita"&lt;ref&gt;Roberts B. (2014), "System of Secondary Cities: Why they are Important to the Sustainable Development of Nations and Regions", Power Point presentation for the Networking Event: Secondary Cities- Key Links for Equitable and Sustainable City Systems organised by Cities Alliance and IADB at the WUF 7 in Medellin&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Shabda''''', or '''{{IAST|Śabda}}''', is the [[Sanskrit]] word for "speech sound". In [[Sanskrit grammar]], the term refers to an [[utterance]] in the sense of [[linguistic performance]].

==History==
In classical Indian [[philosophy of language]], the grammarian [[Katyayana]] stated that ''shabda'' ("speech") is eternal (''nitya''), as is ''[[artha]]'' "meaning", and that they share a mutual co-relation. According to [[Patanjali]], the permanent aspect of ''shabda'' is [[sphoṭa|{{IAST|sphoṭa}}]] ("meaning"), while ''dhvani'' ("sound, acoustics") is ephemeral to ''shabda''.

Om, or [[Om|Aum]], a sacred syllable of [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Jainism]], is considered to be the first resonating vibrational sound within an individual being. It also denotes the non-dualistic universe as a whole. In Buddhism, Om corresponds to the [[crown chakra]] and white light.

[[Bhartrihari]], on the other hand, held a ''shabda-[[advaita]]'' position, identifying ''shabda'' as indivisible, and unifying the notions of cognition and linguistic performance, which is ultimately identical to [[Brahman]]. Bhartrhari recognised two entities, both of which may be referred to as ''shabda''. One entity is the underlying cause of the articulated sounds, while the other entity is the functionality that is used to express meaning. Bhartrhari thus rejected the difference posited between the ontological and the linguistic by [[Indian logic|logicians]]. His concept of ''shabda-brahman'' which identified linguistic performance and creation itself ran parallel to the Greek concept of ''[[logos]]''.

Language philosophy in Medieval India was dominated by the dispute of the "naturalists" to the [[Mimamsa]] school, notably defended by [[Kumarila]], who held that ''shabda'' designates the actual phonetic utterance, and the Sphota school, defended by [[Mandana Mishra]], which identifies ''[[sphota]]'' and ''shabda'' as a mystical "indivisible word-whole".

==In religion==

===Hinduism===
''Shabda'' is a [[Sanskrit]] word that was first used as a religio-philosophic term in the context of Hindu religion. It refers to the verbal testimony (of revealed scriptures: ''[[shruti]]'' that is indispensable to gaining knowledge of the ultimate reality, Brahman.

===Sikhism===
In [[Sikhism]] the term ''Shabad'' has two primary meanings. The first context of the term is to refer to a hymn or paragraph or sections of the [[Holy Text]] that appears in [[Guru Granth Sahib]], the main holy scripture of the Sikhs. The Guru Granth Sahib is organised by chapters of ''[[ragas]]'', with each chapter containing many ''shabads'' of that ''raga''. The first ''Shabad'' in Guru Granth Sahib is the [[Mool Mantar]]. The script used for the ''Shabad'' is [[Gurmukhi]]. ''Shabad'' is the term also used to refer to hymns within other Sikh scriptures, like [[Deh Siva Var Mohe]]. The second use of the term ''Shabad'' in Sikhism is for the holy name of God, [[Waheguru]].

===Other faiths and philosophies===
Esoterically, ''Shabd'' is the “Sound Current vibrating in all creation. It can be heard by the inner ears.”&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.ruhanisatsangusa.org/gloss.htm Glossary of Oriental terms and important names of persons and places] ''&lt;/ref&gt; Variously referred to as the ''Audible Life Stream'', ''Inner Sound'', ''Sound Current'' or ''Word'' in English,{{source?|date=January 2018}} the ''Shabd'' is the [[Esotericism|esoteric]] essence of [[God]] which is available to all human beings, according to the Shabd path teachings of [[Sant Mat]], [[Surat Shabd Yoga]], [[Eckankar]], Vardankar (a split-off from Eckankar),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Giamboi|first1=Heather|title=Thousands of Visits to Heaven and the Heart of God: "The Most Profound, Vividly Detailed Out of Body Discoveries Yet!"|publisher=Direct Path Publishing|isbn=978-0996907309}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Twitchell|first1=Paul|title=The Shariyat-Ki-Huray Book Two|publisher=Direct Path Publishing|isbn=978-0996907378}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness]].

Adherents believe that a ''[[satguru]]'', [[Eck Master]], or VARDAN Master, who is a [[human]] being, has merged with the ''Shabd'' in such a manner that he or she is a living manifestation of it at its highest level (the “Word made flesh”). However, not only can the ''Satguru'' attain this, but all human beings are inherently privileged in this way. Indeed, in [[Sant Mat]] the ''[[wikt:raison d'être|raison d’être]]'' for the human form is to meditate on the Sound Current, and in so doing merge with it until one’s own divinity is ultimately realized.

''Naam'' ("Word") has been described through the use of several different terms. [[Sant Baljit Singh]], a contemporary Sant Mat Master, uses the term "Light and Sound Current". He describes it as the connecting link between human beings and God.

{{Sociology}}
'''Sociology of terrorism''' is an emerging field in [[sociology]] seeking to understand [[terrorism]] as a [[social phenomenon]] and how individuals as well as [[State (polity)|states]] respond to such events. It is not to be confused with [[critical terrorism studies]] which sometimes overlaps with the [[psychology of terrorism]].

==History==

===Pre-September 11 attacks===
After the [[September 11 attacks]], there has been a spike of interest in various sociological traditions related to terrorism, such as [[moral panic]], organizational response and media coverage, and [[counter-terrorism]].

The most comprehensive study into the definition of terrorism comes from a study by Weinberg, Pedahzur and Hirsch-Hoefler (2004) who examined 73 definitions of terrorism from 55 articles and concluded that terrorism is: "a politically motivated tactic involving the threat or use of force or violence in which the pursuit of publicity plays a significant role."&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg, Pedahzur and Hirsch-Hoefler 2004&lt;/ref&gt; However, Weinberg ''et al.'' point out that definitions of terrorism often ignore [[Symbolism of terrorism|symbolic aspects of terrorism]].  Due to its focus on symbolism, sociology has a unique vantage point from which to assess [[Fear|terror]].

===Post-September 11 attacks===
Since the September 11 attacks, Mathieu Deflem ([[University of South Carolina]]), S.E. Costanza ([[Central Connecticut State University]]) and John C. Kilburn Jr. ([[Texas A&amp;M International University]]) are among the sociologists to call for the development of a sub-field in sociology related to terrorism. Common topics that are part of the discourse in the sociology of terrorism include: [[military spending]], counter-terrorism, [[immigration]], privacy issues, and the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], where within these contexts questions of power, the definition of terrorism, propaganda, nationality, the media, etc. are being deliberated upon.

Early peer-reviewed literature after the September 11 attacks examined policing and citizen responses to terror during the September 11 attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer 2002&lt;/ref&gt; It also examined interactions between [[first responder]]s (police, rescue teams, etc.) and communities. Ramirez, Hoopes and Quinlan (2003) rightly predicted that police organizations would change fundamental styles of [[Racial profiling|profiling]] people&lt;ref&gt;Ramirez, Hoopes and Quinlan 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and police agencies would alter their [[mission statement]]s after the September 11 attacks. There is strong reason to believe that even the smallest of local police agencies are apt to feel some kind of pressure to deal with the issue of terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;DeLone 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent work in the sociology of terrorism field is philosophical and reflective and has focused on issues such as moral panic and over-spending after the September 11 attacks. Costanza and Kilburn (2005), in an article entitled ''Symbolic Security, Moral Panic and Public Sentiment: Toward a sociology of Counterterrorism'' argued that the issue of symbolism is of much importance to understanding the war on terror.&lt;ref&gt;Costanza and Kilburn 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Using a classic [[symbolic interactionist]] perspective, they argue that strong public sentiment about the [[homeland security]] issue has driven policy more to superficial threats than real and concrete threats. Others argue that symbolism has led to agency a policy of “[[hypervigilance]]” in agency decision-making that is costly and [[Falsifiability|untestable]].

Some sociologists and legal scholars have contemplated the potential consequences of aggressive (or [[militaristic]]) policing of terror threats that may have negative implications for human rights which are of great interest to sociologists as a matter of [[social justice]].  For instance, in a peer-reviewed article ''Crouching tiger or phantom dragon? Examining the discourse on global cyber-terror'', Helms, Costanza and Johnson (2011) ask if it is possible that media hype at the national level could prompt an unnecessary and systemic over-pursuit of [[cyberterrorism]]. They warn that such overreaction might lead to a "[[killswitch]]" policy which could give the federal government ultimate power over the internet.

Despite the [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] lean of modern sociology; Kilburn, Costanza, Borgeson and Metchik (2011) point out that there are several methodological barbs to effectively and scientifically assessing the effect of homeland security measures.&lt;ref&gt;Kilburn, Costanza, Borgeson and Metchik 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  In traditional [[criminology]], the most quantitatively amenable starting point for measuring the effectiveness of any policing strategy (i.e., [[Neighborhood Watch|neighborhood watch]], [[gun control]], foot patrols, etc.) is to assess total financial costs against [[clearance rates]] or [[arrest rates]]. Since terrorism is such a rare event phenomena, measuring arrests would be a naive way to test policy effectiveness.

Another methodological problem in the development of sociology of terrorism as a sub-field is one of finding operational measures for key concepts in the study of homeland security.&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg et al 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Both terrorism and homeland security are relatively new concepts for social scientists, and academicians have yet to agree on the matter of how to properly conceptualize these ideas.

==Three sociological perspectives==

===Structural functionalism===
{{Main|Structural functionalism}}
Functionalism is “the theory that various social institutions and processes in society exists to serve some important (or necessary) function to keep society running.” This sociological perspective draws on the work of sociologists like [[Émile Durkheim]], and gets its name from the idea that the best way to study society is to identify the [[Role|roles]] that different aspects of society play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conley|first1=Dalton|title=You May Ask Yourself: An Introduction to Thinking Like a Sociologist|date=2013|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|page=29|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deviance (sociology)|Social deviance]], loosely understood, can be taken to mean any "transgression of socially established [[Social norm|norms]]." This can range from the minor–slamming a door in someone's face–to the major–a terrorist act. Thus terrorism is a deviant behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conley|first1=Dalton|title=You May Ask Yourself: An Introduction to Thinking Like a Sociologist|date=2013|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|page=189|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Functionalism sees terrorism–which is a form of [[crime]]–as a temporary deviation from the normal goings on of society, and is in a way functional to society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cinoglu|first1=H.|last2=Ozeren|first2=S|title=Classical Schools of Sociology and  Terrorism|url=http://sbd.ogu.edu.tr/makaleler/1488711_2_Makale_3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sociologist that utilizes structural functionalism would explain the existence of any social phenomena by the function they perform. Therefore, terrorism is functional because it joins individuals together in opposition, and brings a sense of belonging to the group opposing it. This feeling of [[group solidarity]] would help prevent [[Anomie|''anomie'']], which is the stage where people do not need to follow any norms of society in order to survive in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cinoglu|first1=H.|last2=Ozeren|first2=S|title=Classical Schools of Sociology and Terrorism|url=http://sbd.ogu.edu.tr/makaleler/1488711_2_Makale_3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terrorists, like other criminals, become what is known as a reference point; individuals use a reference point as a standard for evaluation. The norms and rules of society become clearer, and are seen as necessary, in comparison to terrorism. In order to protect the [[Status quo|''status quo'']], society uses terrorism as a way to reassert the importance of social norms in the lives of individuals. Thus individuals see terrorism as a threat to the [[social equilibrium]] and their life in a functioning society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cinoglu|first1=H.|last2=Ozeren|first2=S|title=Classical Schools of Sociology and Terrorism|url=http://sbd.ogu.edu.tr/makaleler/1488711_2_Makale_3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Functionalists believe that social change is required to keep a healthy society. Slow, well-planned, and evolutionary method-types change a healthy society socially. These social changes often come about from a drastic need for change and are preceded by a social shock.  Terrorism brings about a social shock that moves society towards a change in direction that enables it to find new ways in which to protect itself. Functionalists view these new changes as providing society with a healthy and slow-paced [[social change]] that was needed. Terrorism thus becomes an expected and needed shock, and therefore can be seen in a sense to encourage society to change for the better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cinoglu|first1=H.|last2=Ozeren|first2=S|title=Classical Schools of Sociology and Terrorism|url=http://sbd.ogu.edu.tr/makaleler/1488711_2_Makale_3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflict theory===
{{Main|Conflict theories}}
Conflict theory is “the idea that conflict between competing interests is the basic, animating force of social change and society in general." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conley|first1=Dalton|title=You May Ask Yourself: An Introduction to Thinking Like a Sociologist|date=2013|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|page=30|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A conflict theorist generally sees that the control of conflict equals the ability of one group to suppress the group that they are opposing, and that [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]] is a technique of defining and maintaining a social order that benefits some at the expense of others.

Conflict theorists view terrorism as a reaction to [[injustice]], which is probably created in the minds of terrorists due to misguidance, illiteracy, or unrealistic goals, and that violent behaviors expressed by terrorist organizations are the result of individual frustration, aggression or showing a readiness to fight. [[Political conflict]] makes people look for ways to explain and solve the problems they are facing. If the conflict is deeply rooted, and the current ideology proves unable to deal with the problems, people begin to turn to other ideologies that can often carry a religious theme to them. This is not to say that all forms of terrorist acts are committed by people that are religious. In 83% of the [[Suicide attack|suicide attackers]] worldwide, between 1980 and 2003, only 43% were identifiably religious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hartmann|first1=Douglas|last2=Uggen|first2=Christopher|title=The Contexts Reader|date=2012|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York, New York|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brym|first1=Robert|title=Six Lessons of Suicide Bombers|date=2007|pages=22–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terrorists use violence because they believe that if they did not use violence they would lose a power struggle, which lead many conflict theorists to view it as a weapon of the weak. In [[Iraq]], between March 2003 and February 2006, 443 suicide missions took place with 71% belonging to [[al-Qaeda]]. They justified their actions in religious terms; viewing the [[Shia Islam in Iraq|Shi'a control of Iraq]] as abandoning religious principles. Suicide attacks against the Iraqi regime and its American and British supporters were seen as the means in which to accomplish this. Yet it was only under certain political conditions that suicide bombings spiked. The first condition being that it was in relation with the [[Counter-insurgency|counterinsurgency]] of the American and British militaries. The second being a strategic response to the [[Shia Islam|Shi'a]] control becoming more stabilized in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hartmann|first1=Douglas|last2=Uggen|first2=Christopher|title=The Contexts Reader|date=2012|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York, New York|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brym|first1=Robert|title=Six Lessons of Suicide Bombers|date=2007|pages=22–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terrorists do not have the money or the political power that is needed to wage war, so they use terrorism as a means, not a goal, to agitate the government in order to achieve their political objectives.  Before committing an act of terror, a terrorist does not always weigh the cost and benefits of their actions, but rather is reacting from the humiliation and frustration they feel they are being subjected too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hartmann|first1=Douglas|last2=Uggen|first2=Christopher|title=The Contexts Reader|date=2012|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York, New York|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brym|first1=Robert|title=Six Lessons of Suicide Bombers|date=2007|pages=22–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbolic interactionism===
{{Main|Symbolic interactionism}}
Symbolic interactionism is “a [[Microsociology|micro-level theory]] in which shared meanings, originations, and assumptions form the basic motivations behind peoples’ actions." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conley|first1=Dalton|title=You May Ask Yourself: An Introduction to Thinking Like a Sociologist|date=2013|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|page=31|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In symbolic interactionism, [[face-to-face interaction]] creates the social world. Individuals act on perceived meanings that appear to be self-constituting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conley|first1=Dalton|title=You May Ask Yourself: An Introduction to Thinking Like a Sociologist|date=2013|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|page=32|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Group membership is one of the major determinations if individual interpretations of reality, which enables symbolic interactionism to explain crime, and thus terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cinoglu|first1=H.|last2=Ozeren|first2=S|title=Classical Schools of Sociology and Terrorism|url=http://sbd.ogu.edu.tr/makaleler/1488711_2_Makale_3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deviance, which terrorism falls under, can be explained by [[labeling theory]]. Labeling theory is “the belief that individuals subconsciously notice how others see or label them, and their reactions to those labels, over time, form the basis of their [[Self-concept|self-identity]]." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conley|first1=Dalton|title=You May Ask Yourself: An Introduction to Thinking Like a Sociologist|date=2013|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|page=206|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social groups]] create rules about what is acceptable behavior for people in society. When a rule is broken, society determines if the act was deviant. A person can only become deviant after a social reaction to an act committed is labeled deviant, and that original act is referred to as the [[primary deviance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conley|first1=Dalton|title=You May Ask Yourself: An Introduction to Thinking Like a Sociologist|date=2013|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|page=209|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being labeled deviant causes a person to see themselves as deviants, which leads to said person performing more deviant acts, with each act being referred to as [[secondary deviance]]. Secondary deviance can quickly turn into a [[Social stigma|stigma]], which is a label that changes the way people see someone, and how individuals view themselves&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conley|first1=Dalton|title=You May Ask Yourself: An Introduction to Thinking Like a Sociologist|date=2013|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|page=2011|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to symbolic interactionism, terrorism is treated as learned behaviors. Each person learns how to commit terrorism through interactions with terrorists. Involvement in the group is important in the learning process, and members, upon joining, are resocialized to the group’s version of [[Social reality|reality]]. The best way to accomplish this is to involve new members in terrorist acts, which leads the terrorist organization to become the only reference point for its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cinoglu|first1=H.|last2=Ozeren|first2=S|title=Classical Schools of Sociology and  Terrorism|url=http://sbd.ogu.edu.tr/makaleler/1488711_2_Makale_3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social learning theory plays a part in the [[socialization]] of terroristic behaviors. Learning theory states that a person becomes deviant because of an abundance of definitions that favor deviant behavior versus definitions that are unfavorable to such behaviors. This theory is broken down into four learning mechanisms: differential association, definitions, differential reinforcement, and imitation.

The first learning mechanism is [[differential association]], which refers to "direct association and interaction with others who engage in certain kinds of behaviors or express norms, values, and attitudes supportive of such behavior, as well as indirect association and identification with more distant reference groups." The groups that an individual are differentially associated with provides the context in which the social learning is operated. The greater the priority, intensity, duration, and frequency of the differential association the greater the effect on behavior. Hence, the theory in relation to terrorism is that the stronger someone's connection is towards a terrorist organization the better chance that person has of also exhibiting terroristic behaviors.

The second learning mechanism is definitions. Definitions refer to an "individual's own value and belief system about what is and is not acceptable behavior." These values are learned and reinforced through differential association. There are two types of definitions, general definition and specific definition. General definitions include broad beliefs about conformity that are influenced through conventional means and are often influenced by religious or moral values. Specific definitions are seen as those that align an individual with particular acts of crime. The greater the number of definitions the more likely a person will engage in criminal behavior. So the more definitions an individual has that favor terroristic behavior the greater chance that person has of committing a terroristic acts.

The third learning mechanism is [[differential reinforcement]]. Differential reinforcement "refers to the balance of anticipated or actual rewards and punishments that follow behavior." An individual refraining from committing a crime depends on a balance of past, present, and anticipated future rewards or punishments for their actions. In regards to terrorism, the more direct or indirect social interaction a person has towards terrorism the more likely they are to commit a terroristic act.

The fourth and final learning mechanism is [[imitation]]. "Imitation is the notion that individuals engage in behaviors that they have previously witnessed others doing." The characters being observed, the behaviors that are being witnessed, and the consequences for those behaviors determine how much an individual imitates a behavior. All of these things need to fall into place in order for an individual to imitate a terrorist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Pauwels|first1=Lieven|last2=Schils|first2=Nele|title=Differential Online Exposure to Extremist Content and Political Violence: Testing the Relative Strength of Social Learning and Competing Perspectives|journal=Terrorism and Political Violence|volume=28|pages=1|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09546553.2013.876414|doi=10.1080/09546553.2013.876414|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Star Walk''''' is an application developed for [[iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] by [[Vito Technology]] presented in the mobile software market since 2001.

The objective of ''Star Walk'' is to help [[astronomy]] amateurs, students and professionals locate and identify over 200,000 stars, [[planets]], [[constellations]] and [[satellites]] in the night sky. Since its release ''Star Walk'' has been downloaded more than 5 million times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=17 of Apple's Favorite Apps|url=http://money.cnn.com/gallery/magazines/fortune/2013/04/08/17-of-apples-favorite-apps.fortune/9.html|publisher=Money.cnn.com|accessdate=2014-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functionality==
[[File:StarWalk-iPad-screenshot.png|left|upright|thumb|300px|''Time Machine'' will help users explore the map of the night sky of tomorrow or years ago.]]

The application allows users to explore [[astronomical objects]] in real time, watch moon phases, [[meteor showers]], [[iridium flares]], see daily [[sunset]] and [[sunrise]] times, elevation angle, and day length. Most of the objects in the application are complemented with extensive information about them.

''Star Walk'' shows users a list of upcoming celestial events which they can add to the calendar and set a reminder for.

Also, the application is equipped with time machine feature which gives an opportunity to explore the map of the night sky in the past and future.
Besides, ''Star Walk'' uses iOS device camera for [[augmented reality]] feature. It combines the image data from camera with the star map to give the user a real time view of [[celestial objects]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chen|first=Jason|title=iPad App Review Marathon Live (Part 2)|url=https://gizmodo.com/5509335/ipad-app-review-marathon-live-part-2|publisher=Gizmodo.com|accessdate=2014-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stemettes''' is a [[social enterprise]] which encourages girls aged between 5–22 years old to pursue careers in Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths, or [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]]. Stemettes runs panel events, [[hackathon]]s, the Student to Stemette mentoring programme supported by [[Deutsche Bank]], Outbox Incubator and an app, OtotheB, an online platform for girls interested in STEM and [[entrepreneurship]].

==History==
Stemettes was started in 2013 by British mathematics and computing child prodigy [[Anne-Marie Imafidon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Lydia|title=Women in Science: Meet the Stemettes star inspiring more girls into STEM|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/women-science-meet-stemettes-star-inspiring-more-girls-into-stem-1543094|accessdate=23 August 2016|date=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Jacquelyn Guderley became co-founder of Stemettes alongside Imafidon.{{clarify|reason=makes no sense - if she joined 2 years after it was started then she cannot be co-founder|date=December 2017}}

Stemettes has partnered with organisations including [[Deutsche Bank]], [[Salesforce]], [[Accenture]], [[Bank of America Merrill Lynch]], [[BP]] and [[Microsoft]]. The organisation is regularly called upon by the [[Government of the United Kingdom|UK Government]] and [[European Commission]] to consult on matters related to women in STEM.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Outbox Incubator==
For six weeks from July–August 2015, Stemettes ran Outbox Incubator in London. This residential business incubator for girls with STEM start-ups became known as the “X-men house for girls”&lt;ref&gt;Ravanona, Anna. [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/anne-ravanona/inside-outbox-incubator-m_b_8423472.html Inside Outbox Incubator: Meet the Startups Built By Girls in STEM - Part 1], [[The Huffington Post]], 29 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, the Outbox Incubator spin-off app, OtotheB, was officially launched. The app is an online platform for girls interested in STEM and entrepreneurship. The app has been well received by some STEM figures such as academic and campaigner [[Sue Black (computer scientist)|Sue Black]], who described the app as a “…fantastic new resource for young women interested in technology”.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, John.

'''''The Last Heathen: Encounters with Ghosts and Ancestors in Melanesia''''' is a book by [[Charles Montgomery (writer)|Charles Montgomery]], published in Canada by [[Douglas and McIntyre]] in 2004. In 2006 it was published in the United States by [[HarperCollins]] as ''The Shark God''.

''The Last Heathen'' is the autobiographical account of the author in his journey to [[Melanesia]], following in the footsteps of his great-grandfather, [[Henry Montgomery (bishop)|Henry Montgomery]], [[Bishop of Tasmania]], and to study the effect of his great-grandfather's religion on the people. Montgomery traveled to Melanesia expecting to find a volatile mixture of the tribal, pagan religion and Christianity. He found a comfortable hybrid instead, the two religions living in harmony. The book details his journey as well as his discoveries, from an atheistic point of view.

The book won the [[Charles Taylor Prize]] for Literary Non-fiction in 2005. The book has also won the [[Hubert Evans Non-Fiction Prize]].

'''Toxicity characteristic leaching procedure''' (TCLP) is a soil sample extraction method for chemical analysis employed as an analytical method to simulate [[leachate|leaching]] through a [[landfill]].  The testing methodology is used to determine if a waste is characteristically hazardous, i.e., classified as one of the "D" listed wastes by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA). The extract is analyzed for substances appropriate to the protocol.
[[File:D-Codes.pdf|thumb|List of "D" wastes published by US EPA]]

==Background==
In the United States, the [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] (RCRA) of 1976 led to establishment of federal standards for the disposal of [[solid waste]] and [[hazardous waste]]. RCRA requires that [[industrial waste]]s and other wastes must be characterized following testing protocols published by EPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=July 1992 |title=Method 1311: Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure |url=https://www.epa.gov/hw-sw846/sw-846-test-method-1311-toxicity-characteristic-leaching-procedure |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, DC}} Part of [https://www.epa.gov/hw-sw846 "Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods."]  Document no. SW-846.&lt;/ref&gt; TCLP is one of these tests.

==Application of test==
The Environmental Compliance Supervisor (the "gatekeeper") at a typical municipal [[landfill]] (as defined by RCRA [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act#Subtitle D: Non-hazardous Solid Wastes|Subtitle D]]) uses TCLP data to determine whether a waste may be accepted into the facility. If TCLP analytical results are below the TCLP D-list maximum contamination levels (MCLs) the waste can be accepted. If they are above these levels the waste must be taken to a [[Hazardous_waste#Final disposal of hazardous waste|hazardous waste disposal facility]] and the cost of disposal may increase from about $50.00/ton to as much as $1200.00/ton.

As extremely contaminated material is expensive to dispose, grading is necessary to ensure safe disposal and to avoid paying for disposal of "clean fill."  The TCLP procedure is generally useful for classifying waste material for disposal options.  


Spent abrasive or soil from a construction site usually need to have a TCLP for lead done to determine where the waste goes next.

==Procedure==
TCLP comprises four fundamental procedures:
* Sample preparation for leaching
* Sample leaching
* Preparation of leachate for analysis
* Leachate analysis

In the TCLP procedure the pH of the sample material is first established, and then leached with an [[acetic acid]] / [[sodium hydroxide]] solution at a 1:20 mix of sample to solvent. For example, a TCLP jug may contain 100g of sample and 2000 mL of solution. The leachate mixture is sealed in extraction vessel for general analytes, or possibly pressure sealed as in zero-headspace extractions (ZHE) for [[volatile organic compound]]s and tumbled for 18 hours to simulate an extended leaching time in the ground. It is then filtered so that only the solution (not the sample) remains and this is then analyzed.

The comic strip is a [[Text comics|text-based comic]], that answers readers' questions, with illustrations of the main characters, various objects, and, or the experiments being discussed. It is run as a single panel comic that appears in newspapers as a color, or black and white Sunday feature, in either a 1/4 page strip, or 1/2 tab format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://images.amuniversal.com/ups/sales/UPS_Factsheet6_06.pdf|title=Universal Press Syndicate: Fact Sheet, June 2006 |publisher=[[Universal Press Syndicate]]|pages=2, 3|date=June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The comic has reached a readership of 52 million readers, in 13 countries.&lt;ref name=SFBay/&gt; About 80 percent of the letters it receives are from females.&lt;ref name=SFBay/&gt; From its comic origins, its lead character Beakman would later star in his own [[live action]] [[television series]], ''[[Beakman's World]]''.&lt;ref name="Post2006"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2006/06/20/DI2006062000567.html|title=Comics: Meet the Artist|first=Suzanne |last=Tobin|work=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|date=2006-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The comic also branched out into other media, gaining numerous awards along the way. The comic continued for several months after its author died of a heart attack on April 29, 2016.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Jok-Church-Beakman-and-Jax-cartoon-strip-for-7396400.php|title=Jok Church, of Beakman and Jax cartoon strip for kids, dies at 67|author=Steve Rubenstein|date=5 May 2016|work=SFGate|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jok's final remaining comic was published on July 17, 2016, just three days after its 25th anniversary of publication.&lt;ref name=GoComics/&gt;

The comic strip was originally named ''You Can with Beakman'' (also called ''U Can with Beakman''.&lt;ref name="BrnLW"/&gt; Its only main character at the time was '''Beakman Place''', a male figure with spiky blue hair, glasses, a neck tie, and a breast pocket full of instruments. Beakman is a non-[[scientist]] that learns about the world through books, and then finds ways to prove what he's read about.&lt;ref name=ADE&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nyshistoricnewspapers.org/lccn/sn86033360/1994-05-10/ed-1/seq-10/png/ |title=National News: Cartoonist defends 'explosive' comic strip experiment|work=Adirondack Daily Enterprise|publisher=Northern New York Library Network Newspaper.com |date=1994-05-10 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was named after [[Beekman Place]], a small street on the east side of Manhattan, New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= The Real Breakman, by Brenden Shea|work=Odyssey. March 2000, Vol. 9 Issue 3, page 45|publisher=[[Odyssey (children's magazine)]] |date=March 2000|page=C4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The comic is in a question-and-answer format, in which a reader asks a question, addressed to either Beakman, or also later, his sister '''Jax Place''',&lt;ref name="Post2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Amzn&gt;{{Cite book|isbn=0836270215|title=Beakman and Jax's Microscope Book: Product description|publisher=Amazon.com|date=December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; a red head, with her hair curled up behind her head in blue circular bands, she wears glasses, and [[Knucklebones|jacks]] in her hair, and as [[earring]]s. Church provides the answer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amuniversal.com/ups/speakers/church/ |title=Jok Church: INTERNATIONALLY SYNDICATED SCIENCE NERD |publisher=Universal Press Syndicate |accessdate=2013-10-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051024023930/http://www.amuniversal.com/ups/speakers/church/ |archivedate=October 24, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; usually by means of a simple experiment the children reading can do (often with parental assistance or supervision). A paragraph after the results of the experiment, in inverted text at the bottom of the comic, would explain the answer.

==Concept==
The idea for doing a comic strip came to Jok while he was working for [[Lucasfilm]], and answering questions from [[George Lucas]]' [[fan mail]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cincypost.com/living/1998/beak030298.html|title=Beakman's World: Museum hosts hands-on show|first=Connie|last=Yeager|work=[[The Cincinnati Post]]|publisher=[[E. W. Scripps Company]]|date=1998-03-02|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040906044215/http://www.cincypost.com/living/1998/beak030298.html|archivedate=2004-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that he was “overcome by the bravery children showed by asking Mr. Lucas anything at all" and he "decided to write about real questions from real kids".&lt;ref name=SFBay&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfbaytimes.com/?sec=article&amp;article_id=8445 |title=Introducing Jok Church’s Comic - You Can with Beakman &amp; Jax|first=Tom W.|last=Kelly|work=[[San Francisco Bay Times]]|publisher=sfbaytimes.com|archivedate=2008-10-11 |deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011132457/http://www.sfbaytimes.com/?sec=article&amp;article_id=8445}}&lt;/ref&gt; While working at [[Lucasfilm]], Jok began working on a project called "Here's How" a comicstrip and educational television series featuring [[C-3PO]] teaching foreign language and [[R2-D2]] explaining the more physical world", the idea was eventually shelved, but the concept later evolved into Jok's Comicstrip featuring a character named Beakman.&lt;ref name="AMU"/&gt; He would receive these science questions from children, and he would choose to answer them based on subjects that he didn't know about, and wanted to learn.&lt;ref name="Post2006"/&gt; The comic was written for an audience that includes children, but not exclusively children.&lt;ref name="Post2006"/&gt; He felt his purpose in making the comics was "to make sure my readers are not intimidated by the world through which they walk".&lt;ref name=SFBay/&gt; He would then research the subject, write, draw, and color the comics by using a Macintosh computer.&lt;ref name=UCan1&gt;{{cite book | last = Church | first = Jok  | title = You Can with Beakman: Science Stuff You Can Do  | publisher = Andrews McMeel Publishing | year = 1992 | page = 4 | isbn = 0836270045}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process gained him criticism in May 1994 when he explained how to do an experiment separating [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]] from water, through [[electrolysis]] using a single jar, and a [[nine-volt battery]], for which he defended the comic strip, by explaining the small amount of gas that would be produced in this way would not be overly dangerous. This was reported to be the first time an experiment's safety was questioned.&lt;ref name=ADE/&gt;

Besides answering questions from children, Jok also took questions from adults. One such question came from the Canadian Prime Minister, [[Jean Chrétien]], who asked about why golf balls had little dents. Jok later explained that he "has world leaders periodically contribute to his&amp;nbsp;... feature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Syndicates/News Services: Prime minister asks.|work=Editor &amp; Publisher |volume= 127 |issue=40|publisher=[[Editor &amp; Publisher]] |date=1994-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the comic strip Jok also introduced an annual "Beakman and Jax Make Up Your Own Rules Contest", in which the reader could report on an experiment or research they did. There were up to 100 winners from around the world, and the prizes were such things as a free telescopes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Life: Your Family, Melissa Baird|work=Marysville/Yuba City's Appeal-Democrat November 12, 1995, page C4|publisher=[[Appeal-Democrat]] |date=1995-10-12 |page=C4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and copies of the Beakman &amp; Jax books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Briefs: Cedar Rapids, Student wins book|work=The Cedar Rapids Gazette: Thursday, Nov. 10,1994, Page 3Y|publisher=[[The Gazette (Cedar Rapids)]] |date=1994-11-10 |page=3Y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and media==
The comic first appeared in the [[Marin Independent Journal]], and was offered to them for free.&lt;ref name=SFBay/&gt; The earlier comic strips were then reprinted in three "Science Stuff You Can Do"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openlibrary.org/search?q=Science+Stuff+You+Can+Do |title=Science Stuff You Can Do, Search on Open Library.org |publisher=Open Library|date=2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; books, a ''Best of'', and was the bases for two specialty books, ''Beakman &amp; Jax's Bubble Book'' and ''Beakman &amp; Jax's Microscope Book''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openlibrary.org/works/OL2697013W/The_Best_of_You_Can_With_Beakman_and_Jax |title=The Best of You Can With Beakman and Jax, on Open Library.org |publisher=Open Library|date=2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the release of the first book June 1, 1992,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780836270044 |title=You Can with Beakman: Science Stuff You Can Do, publication information. |publisher=[[American Booksellers Association]]

"Sound Barrier, Beak-mania and Healthy Living" |newspaper=[[TV.com]]|date=1995-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 an official website opened for the strip published by the "North Bay Network", it won many awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/virtual_disk_library/index.cgi/4273355/FID3542/res/encat/102981.htm |title=You can with Beakman and Jax |publisher=[[Indiana University]].com|date=2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It later moved to its current location in 1996, published by [[Network Solutions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whoismind.com/whois/beakman.com.html |title=Beakman.com - Whois Data |publisher=[[Whois]].com|date=2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where it has received several positive reviews from such internet guides as "The parents' pocket guide to kids &amp; computers" by Family Computer Workshop, which gave the site 5 out of 5 stars and recommended it for readers 7–13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Parents' Pocket Guide to Kids &amp; Computers |authors=Family Computer Workshop Staff| publisher = Family Computer Workshop | year = 1998 | page = 166 | isbn = 0966645634}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time the site contained questions and answers, as well as hands-on activities, some of which required [[Netscape]] and [[Shockwave]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Elizabeth B. | last = Miller | title = The Internet Resource Directory for K–12 Teachers and Librarians | publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group | year = 2001 | page = 174 | isbn = 1563089130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final strip was published on July 17, 2016, three days after its 25th anniversary and three months after Jok Church died.
