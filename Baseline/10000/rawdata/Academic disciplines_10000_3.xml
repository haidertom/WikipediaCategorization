'''''A Vedic Word Concordance''''' ([[Sanskrit]]: ''{{IAST|Vaidika-Padānukrama-Koṣa}}'' ) is a multi-volume [[Concordance (publishing)|concordance]] of the corpus of [[Vedic Sanskrit]] texts. It has been under preparation from 1930 and was published in 1935-1965 under the guidance of {{IAST|Viśvabandhu Śāstrī}} (d. 1973), with an introduction in Sanskrit and English. It aims to be "a universal vocabulary register" of "Vedic works, with complete textual reference and critical [[Commentary (philology)|commentary]] bearing on [[phonology]], [[Vedic accent|accent]], etymo-morphology, grammar, [[Vedic meter|metre]], text-criticism, and [[Proto-Indo-Iranian|Ur-Aryan]] philology".

==Contents==
The work covers 123,000 word-bases and 5,000,000 word forms found in about 400 Vedic and [[Vedanga]] texts, including [[Vedas|Samhitas]], [[Brahmanas]], [[Aranyakas]] and [[Upanishads]] (even very late ones). The Vedanga section does not cover all the published Shrauta or Grihya texts, however, while the Upanishad section also includes the [[Bhagavad Gita]].

The concordance extends to about  11,000 pages, published in 16 parts:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jamison |first= Stephanie W.|author2= [[Michael Witzel|Witzel, Michael]]|editor= Sharma, Arvind|title= The Study of Hinduism |year= 2003|publisher= University of S. Carolina Press|location= |language= |isbn= 1-57003-449-4|pages= 109–110|chapter= Vedic Hinduism}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Section: Samhitas (6 parts), 1942-63.
:Section II: Brahmanas and Aranyakas (2 parts), 1935,36
:Section III: Upanishads (2 parts), 1945
:Section IV: Vedangas (4 parts), 1958-61
:Index (2 parts), 1964-65.

A revised and enlarged edition was published 1973-1976.

==History of development==
[[Acharya Vishva Bandhu|Vishva Bandhu Shastri]] continued the work of Vishveshvaranand and Nityanand, who had published word indices to the four Vedic Samhitas in 1908-1910, leading the ''Vishveshvaranand Institute'' from 1924 until his death in 1973.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|title = Education in Hoshiarpur |url = http://hoshiarpur.nic.in/html/education.htm| publisher = Hoshiarpur District Administration|accessdate = 2008-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[partition of India]], the institute moved to its present premises at Sadhu Ashram, [[Hoshiarpur]], [[Punjab, India]]. Most of the approximately 6000 Sanskrit manuscripts formerly located at the Dayanand College of Lahore were clandestinely brought to Hoshiarpur at the time. Since 1965, the institute has been incorporated in the [[Panjab University, Chandigarh]] as the ''Vishveshvaranand Institute of Sanskrit and Indological Studies'' (VISIS).&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

Based on the ''Vedic Word Concordance'', the institute currently compiles a ''Dictionary of Vedic Interpretation'', of which the first volume, running up to the lemma ''Agni'', has been completed.

[[Image:Excerpt from CDC 2003 Table 1.pdf|thumb|right|2003 US mortality ([[life table|life]]) table, Table 1, Page 1]]'''Actuarial science''' is the discipline that applies [[mathematics|mathematical]] and [[statistics|statistical]] methods to [[Risk assessment|assess risk]] in [[insurance]], [[finance]] and other industries and professions. [[Actuary|Actuaries]] are professionals who are qualified in this field through intense education and experience. In many countries, actuaries must demonstrate their competence by passing a series of rigorous professional examinations.

Actuarial science includes a number of interrelated subjects, including [[mathematics]], [[probability theory]], [[statistics]], [[finance]], [[economics]], and [[computer science]]. Historically, actuarial science used deterministic models in the construction of tables and premiums. The science has gone through revolutionary changes since the 1980s due to the proliferation of high speed computers and the union of [[stochastic]] actuarial models with modern financial theory {{harv|Frees|1990}}.

Many universities have undergraduate and graduate degree programs in actuarial science. In 2010, a study published by job search website CareerCast ranked actuary as the #1 job in the United States {{harv|Needleman|2010}}. The study used five key criteria to rank jobs: environment, income, employment outlook, physical demands, and stress. A similar study by ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' in 2006 included actuaries among the 25 Best Professions that it expects will be in great demand in the future {{harv|Nemko|2006}}.

==Life insurance, pensions and healthcare==
Actuarial science became a formal mathematical discipline in the late 17th century with the increased demand for long-term insurance coverage such as burial, [[life insurance]], and annuities. These long term coverages required that money be set aside to pay future benefits, such as annuity and death benefits many years into the future. This requires estimating future contingent events, such as the rates of mortality by age, as well as the development of mathematical techniques for discounting the value of funds set aside and invested. This led to the development of an important actuarial concept, referred to as the [[present value]] of a future sum. Certain aspects of the actuarial methods for discounting pension funds have come under criticism from modern [[financial economics]].

* In traditional life insurance, actuarial science focuses on the analysis of [[mortality rate|mortality]], the production of [[life table]]s, and the application of [[interest|compound interest]] to produce life insurance, annuities and endowment policies. Contemporary life insurance programs have been extended to include credit and mortgage insurance, [[key person insurance]] for small businesses, [[long term care insurance]] and [[Medical savings account|health savings accounts]] {{harv|Hsiao|2001}}.
* In health insurance, including insurance provided directly by employers, and social insurance, actuarial science focuses on the analysis of rates of disability, morbidity, mortality, fertility and other contingencies. The effects of consumer choice and the geographical distribution of the utilization of medical services and procedures, and the utilization of drugs and therapies, is also of great importance. These factors underlay the development of the Resource-Base Relative Value Scale ([[RBRVS]]) at Harvard in a multi-disciplined study {{harv|Hsiao|2004}}. Actuarial science also aids in the design of benefit structures, reimbursement standards, and the effects of proposed government standards on the cost of healthcare {{harv|CHBRP|2004}}.
* In the pension industry, actuarial methods are used to measure the costs of alternative strategies with regard to the design, funding, accounting, administration, and maintenance or redesign of pension plans. The strategies are greatly influenced by short-term and long-term bond rates, the funded status of the pension and benefit arrangements, [[collective bargaining]]; the employer's old, new and foreign competitors; the changing demographics of the workforce; changes in the internal revenue code; changes in the attitude of the internal revenue service regarding the calculation of surpluses; and equally importantly, both the short and long term financial and economic trends. It is common with mergers and acquisitions that several pension plans have to be combined or at least administered on an equitable basis. When benefit changes occur, old and new benefit plans have to be blended, satisfying new social demands and various government discrimination test calculations, and providing employees and retirees with understandable choices and transition paths. Benefit plans liabilities have to be properly valued, reflecting both earned benefits for past service, and the benefits for future service. Finally, funding schemes have to be developed that are manageable and satisfy the standards board or regulators of the appropriate country, such as the [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]] in the United States.
* In social welfare programs, the [[Office of the Chief Actuary]] (OCACT), [[Social Security Administration]] plans and directs a program of actuarial estimates and analyses relating to SSA-administered retirement, survivors and disability insurance programs and to proposed changes in those programs. It evaluates operations of the [[Social Security (United States)|Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund]] and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund, conducts studies of program financing, performs actuarial and demographic research on social insurance and related program issues involving mortality, morbidity, utilization, retirement, disability, survivorship, marriage, unemployment, poverty, old age, families with children, etc., and projects future workloads. In addition, the Office is charged with conducting cost analyses relating to the [[Supplemental Security Income]] (SSI) program, a general-revenue financed, means-tested program for low-income aged, blind and disabled people. The Office provides technical and consultative services to the Commissioner, to the Board of Trustees of the Social Security Trust Funds, and its staff appears before Congressional Committees to provide expert testimony on the actuarial aspects of Social Security issues.

==Applied to other forms of insurance==
Actuarial science is also applied to [[Property insurance|property]], [[Casualty insurance|casualty]], [[Liability insurance|liability]], and [[general insurance]]. In these forms of insurance, coverage is generally provided on a renewable period, (such as a yearly). Coverage can be cancelled at the end of the period by either party.

[[Property insurance|Property]] and [[casualty insurance]] companies tend to specialize because of the complexity and diversity of risks.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} One division is to organize around personal and commercial lines of insurance. Personal lines of insurance are for individuals and include fire, auto, homeowners, theft and umbrella coverages. Commercial lines address the insurance needs of businesses and include property, business continuation, product liability, fleet/commercial vehicle, workers compensation, fidelity &amp; surety, and [[Directors and officers liability insurance|D&amp;O]] insurance. The insurance industry also provides coverage for exposures such as catastrophe, weather-related risks, earthquakes, patent infringement and other forms of corporate espionage, terrorism, and "one-of-a-kind" (e.g., satellite launch). Actuarial science provides data collection, measurement, estimating, forecasting, and valuation tools to provide financial and underwriting data for management to assess marketing opportunities and the nature of the risks. Actuarial science often helps to assess the overall risk from catastrophic events in relation to its underwriting capacity or surplus.

In the [[reinsurance]] fields, actuarial science can be used to design and price reinsurance and retrocession arrangements, and to establish reserve funds for known claims and future claims and catastrophes.

==Development==

===Pre-formalization===
Elementary [[mutual aid (organization)|mutual aid]] agreements and pensions arose in antiquity {{harv|Thucydides}}. Early in the [[Roman Empire|Roman empire]], associations were formed to meet the expenses of burial, cremation, and monuments—precursors to [[Burial society|burial insurance]] and [[Friendly society|friendly societies]]. A small sum was paid into a communal fund on a weekly basis, and upon the death of a member, the fund would cover the expenses of rites and burial. These societies sometimes sold shares in the building of [[Columbarium|columbāria]], or burial vaults, owned by the fund—the precursor to [[Mutual insurance|mutual insurance companies]] {{harv|Johnston|1932|loc=§475–§476}}. Other early examples of mutual [[surety]] and assurance pacts can be traced back to various forms of fellowship within the Saxon clans of England and their Germanic forebears, and to Celtic society {{harv|Loan|1992}}. However, many of these earlier forms of surety and aid would often fail due to lack of understanding and knowledge {{harv|Faculty and Institute of Actuaries|2004}}.

===Initial development===
The 17th century was a period of advances in mathematics in Germany, France and England. At the same time there was a rapidly growing desire and need to place the valuation of personal risk on a more scientific basis. Independently of each other, [[compound interest]] was studied and [[probability theory]] emerged as a well-understood mathematical discipline. Another important advance came in 1662 from a London [[draper]] named [[John Graunt]], who showed that there were predictable patterns of longevity and death in a group, or [[Cohort (statistics)|cohort]], of people of the same age, despite the uncertainty of the date of death of any one individual. This study became the basis for the original [[life table]]. One could now set up an insurance scheme to provide life insurance or pensions for a group of people, and to calculate with some degree of accuracy how much each person in the group should contribute to a common fund assumed to earn a fixed rate of interest. The first person to demonstrate publicly how this could be done was [[Edmond Halley]] (of [[Halley's comet]] fame). Halley constructed his own life table, and showed how it could be used to calculate the [[Insurance|premium]] amount someone of a given age should pay to purchase a life annuity {{harv|Halley|1693}}.

===Early actuaries===
[[James Dodson (mathematician)|James Dodson]]'s pioneering work on the long term insurance contracts under which the same premium is charged each year led to the formation of the Society for Equitable Assurances on Lives and Survivorship (now commonly known as [[The Equitable Life Assurance Society|Equitable Life]]) in London in 1762 {{harv|Lewin|2007|p=38}}. Many other life insurance companies and pension funds were created over the following 200 years. Equitable Life was the first to use the word "actuary" for its chief executive officer in 1762 {{harv|Ogborn|1956|p=235}}. Previously, "actuary" meant an official who recorded the decisions, or "acts", of ecclesiastical courts {{harv|Faculty and Institute of Actuaries|2004}}. Other companies that did not use such mathematical and scientific methods most often failed or were forced to adopt the methods pioneered by Equitable {{harv|Bühlmann|1997|p=166}}.

===Technological advances===
In the 18th and 19th centuries, calculations were performed without computers. The calculations of life insurance premiums and reserving requirements are rather complex, and actuaries developed techniques to make the calculations as easy as possible, for example "commutation functions" (essentially precalculated columns of summations over time of discounted values of survival and death probabilities) {{harv|Slud|2006}}. Actuarial organizations were founded to support and further both actuaries and actuarial science, and to protect the public interest by promoting competency and ethical standards {{harv|Hickman|2004|p=4}}. However, calculations remained cumbersome, and actuarial shortcuts were commonplace. Non-life actuaries followed in the footsteps of their life insurance colleagues during the 20th century. The 1920 revision for the New-York based National Council on Workmen's Compensation Insurance rates took over two months of around-the-clock work by day and night teams of actuaries {{harv|Michelbacher|1920|pp=224, 230}}. In the 1930s and 1940s, the mathematical foundations for [[stochastic]] processes were developed {{harv|Bühlmann|1997|p=168}}. Actuaries could now begin to estimate losses using models of random events, instead of the [[deterministic]] methods they had used in the past. The introduction and development of the computer further revolutionized the actuarial profession. From pencil-and-paper to punchcards to current high-speed devices, the modeling and forecasting ability of the actuary has rapidly improved, while still being heavily dependent on the assumptions input into the models, and actuaries needed to adjust to this new world {{harv|MacGinnitie|1980|pp=50–51}}.

===Actuarial science related to modern financial economics===
Traditional actuarial science and modern [[financial economics]] in the US have different practices, which is caused by 1) different ways of calculating funding and investment strategies and 2) different regulations.

Regulations are from the [[Armstrong investigation of 1905]], the [[Glass–Steagall Act of 1932]], the adoption of the [[Mandatory Security Valuation Reserve]] by the [[National Association of Insurance Commissioners]], which cushioned market fluctuations, and the [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]], (FASB) in the US and Canada, which regulates pensions valuations and funding.

====History====
Historically, much of the foundation of actuarial theory predated modern financial theory. In the early twentieth century, actuaries were developing many techniques that can be found in modern financial theory, but for various historical reasons, these developments did not achieve much recognition {{harv|Whelan|2002}}.

As a result, actuarial science developed along a different path, becoming more reliant on assumptions, as opposed to the [[arbitrage-free]] [[Rational pricing#Risk neutral valuation|risk-neutral valuation]] concepts used in modern finance. The divergence is not related to the use of historical data and statistical projections of liability cash flows, but is instead caused by the manner in which traditional actuarial methods apply market data with those numbers. For example, one traditional actuarial method suggests that changing the [[asset allocation]] mix of investments can change the value of liabilities and assets (by changing the [[discounted cash flow|discount rate]] assumption). This concept is inconsistent with [[financial economics]].

The potential of modern financial economics theory to complement existing actuarial science was recognized by actuaries in the mid-twentieth century {{harv|Bühlmann|1997|pp=169–171}}. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, there was a distinct effort for actuaries to combine financial theory and stochastic methods into their established models {{harv|D’Arcy|1989}}. Ideas from financial economics became increasingly influential in actuarial thinking, and actuarial science has started to embrace more sophisticated mathematical modelling of finance {{harv|Economist|2006}}. Today, the profession, both in practice and in the educational syllabi of many actuarial organizations, is cognizant of the need to reflect the combined approach of tables, loss models, stochastic methods, and financial theory {{harv|Feldblum|2001|pp=8–9}}. However, assumption-dependent concepts are still widely used (such as the setting of the discount rate assumption as mentioned earlier), particularly in North America.

Product design adds another dimension to the debate. Financial economists argue that pension benefits are bond-like and should not be funded with equity investments without reflecting the risks of not achieving expected returns. But some pension products do reflect the risks of unexpected returns. In some cases, the pension beneficiary assumes the risk, or the employer assumes the risk. The current debate now seems to be focusing on four principles:
# financial models should be free of arbitrage
# assets and liabilities with identical cash flows should have the same price. This is at odds with [[FASB]]
# the value of an asset is independent of its financing
# the final issue deals with how pension assets should be invested

Essentially, financial economics state that pension assets should not be invested in equities for a variety of theoretical and practical reasons {{harv|Moriarty|2006}}.

===Actuaries in criminal justice===
There is an increasing trend to recognize that actuarial skills can be applied to a range of applications outside the traditional fields of insurance, pensions, etc. One notable example is the use in some US states of actuarial models to set criminal sentencing guidelines. These models attempt to predict the chance of re-offending according to rating factors which include the type of crime, age, educational background and ethnicity of the offender {{harv|Silver|Chow-Martin|2002}}. However, these models have been open to criticism as providing justification for discrimination against specific ethnic groups by law enforcement personnel.  Whether this is statistically correct or a self-fulfilling correlation remains under debate {{harv|Harcourt|2003}}.

Another example is the use of actuarial models to assess the risk of sex offense recidivism. Actuarial models and associated tables, such as the MnSOST-R, Static-99, and SORAG, have been used since the late 1990s to determine the likelihood that a sex offender will re-offend and thus whether he or she should be institutionalized or set free {{harv|Nieto|Jung|2006|pp=28–33}}.

When a member died, a stated sum was drawn from the treasury for his funeral....If the purpose of the society was the building of a columbārium, the cost was first determined and the sum total divided into what we should call shares (sortēs virīlēs), each member taking as many as he could afford and paying their value into the treasury.&lt;/small&gt;

'''Adaptive performance''' in the work environment refers to adjusting to and understanding change in the [[workplace]].&lt;ref name=pulakos2000&gt;Pulakos, E. D., Arad, S., Donovan, M. A., &amp; Plamondon, K. E. (2000). Adaptability in the workplace: development of a [[taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] of adaptive performance. Journal of Applied Psychology, 85(4), 612-624.&lt;/ref&gt;   An [[employee]] who is versatile is valued and important in the success of an organization. [[Employers]] seek employees with high [[adaptability]], due to the positive outcomes that follow, such as excellent [[Job performance|work performance]], work attitude, and ability to handle [[stress (psychological)|stress]].&lt;ref&gt;Leiz, Niessan, Swarowsky. "Age and adaptation to changes in the workplace". Journal of Managerial Psychology.  2009, p. 356-383.&lt;/ref&gt;  Employees, who display high adaptive performance in an organization, tend to have more advantages in career opportunities unlike employees who are not adaptable to change.&lt;ref name=pulakos2000 /&gt;   In previous literature, Pulakos and colleagues&lt;ref name=pulakos2000 /&gt; established eight dimensions of adaptive performance.

== Dimensions ==

Pulakos et al.&lt;ref name=pulakos2000 /&gt; proposed the following dimensions for adaptive performance: 
*'''Handling emergencies and crisis situations''': making quick decisions when faced with an [[emergency]].
*'''Handling stress in the workforce''': keeping composed and focused on task at hand when dealing with high demand tasks
*'''Creative problem solving''': thinking outside the boundary limits, and innovatively to solve a problem.
*'''Dealing with uncertain and unpredictable work situations''': able to become productive despite the occurrence of unknown situations.
*'''Learning and manipulating new technology, task, and procedures''': approach new methods and technological constructs in order to accomplish a work task.
*'''Demonstrating interpersonal adaptability''': being considerate of other people's points of view when working in a team to accomplish a certain goal.
*'''Demonstrating cultural adaptability''': being [[Diversity (business)|respectful and considerate of different cultural backgrounds]].
*'''Demonstrating physically oriented adaptability''': physically adjusting one's self to better fit the surrounding environment.

== Measurement==
Pulakos et al.&lt;ref name=pulakos2000 /&gt; developed a scale for adaptive performance based on their eight-dimension model. This scale, the Job Adaptability Inventory (JAI), contains 132 questions (15 – 18 questions per dimension).
Another similar tool is the I-ADAPT measure (I-ADAPT-M) developed by Ployhart and Bliese,&lt;ref name=ployhart2006&gt;Ployhart, Robert E.; Bliese, Paul D. Burke, C. Shawn (Ed); Pierce, Linda G. (Ed); Salas, Eduardo (Ed), (2006). ''Understanding adaptability: A prerequisite for effective performance within complex environments. Advances in human performance and cognitive engineering research'' (Vol 6)., (pp. 3-39).  Amsterdam, Netherlands: Elsevier, xi, 287 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; based on their I-ADAPT theory. They focused on [[adaptability]] as a personality-like trait which describes individual's ability to adapt to organizational changes. Therefore, there is a difference between I-ADAPT-M and the JAI which measures adaptive performance as behaviors. The I-ADAPT-M also has eight [[dimension]]s (crisis adaptability, stress adaptability, creative adaptability, uncertain adaptability, learning adaptability, interpersonal adaptability, cultural adaptability, and physical adaptability), with 5 items for every [[dimension]].

== Work stress ==
[[stress (psychological)|Work stress]] has been considered as a major factor of many work outcomes, like [[Work performance|performance]], nonproductive behavior and [[turnover (employment)|turnover]].&lt;ref&gt;Agolla, J., &amp; Ongori, H. (2008). Occupational stress in organizations and its effects on organizational performance. ''Journal of Management Research, 8''(3), 123-135.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rajkumar, S., &amp; Swaminathan, R. (2013). Stress levels in organizations and their impact on employee's behavior. ''BVIMR Management Edge, 6''(1), 79-88.&lt;/ref&gt;  An employee being able to adapt to change within an organization is more focused, and able to deal with stressful situations.&lt;ref name=pulakos2000 /&gt;  An employee who is unable to absolve their strain is unable to focus on what is occurring in the [[organization]], such as [[organizational change]].&lt;ref name=folkman1986&gt;Folkman, S., Lazarus, R. S., Dunkel-Schetter, C., DeLongis, A., &amp; Gruen, R. J. (1986). Dynamics of a stressful encounter: cognitive appraisal, coping, and encounter outcomes. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 50''(5), 992.&lt;/ref&gt;  Not only can work stress predict adaptive performance to a considerable extent, there are also a lot of overlaps between adaptive performance and [[Coping (psychology)|stress coping]].

=== Stress appraisal ===
It has been long recognized that work stress generally has a negative effects on [[job performance]],&lt;ref&gt;Motowidlo, S. J., Packard, J. S., &amp; Manning, M. R. (1986). Occupational stress: its causes and consequences for [[job performance]]. ''Journal of Applied Psychology, 71''(4), 618.&lt;/ref&gt; but there is differential influence resulting from different perceptions of stressors.  When faced with a new situation, individuals would spontaneously begin to evaluate their own abilities and skills as compared with the requirements of the situation, which is referred to as stress appraisals.&lt;ref name=folkman1986 /&gt;  Such stress appraisal has two stages: primary appraisal and secondary appraisal.  In the primary appraisal stage, individuals evaluate what potential threats there will be, concerning the demands from situation and the goals and values of themselves.  In the secondary appraisal stage, individuals evaluate the resources they have to deal with those requirements.  The results of appraisal, after two stages, are indicated to fall on a continuum between two extremes of being challenged and threatened.&lt;ref&gt;Blascovich, J., &amp; Mendes, W.B. (2000). Challenge and threat appraisals: The role of affective cues. In J. Forgas (Ed.), ''Feeling and thinking: The role of affect in social cognition'' (pp. 59-82). New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Challenge appraisals mean that individuals feel their resources, like abilities and social support to be abundant sufficient to fulfill requirements of the situation.  Threat appraisals, on the other hand, mean that individuals are not confident about their abilities or other resources to respond to the situation demands.  
Threat appraisals and challenge appraisals could influence [[job performance]] distinctively.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, T. R. (2004). The role of neuroticism on psychological and psychological stress responses. ''Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,40''(6), 795-804.&lt;/ref&gt;  As for adaptive performance, the more challenging (i.e., the less threatening) one's stress appraisals are, the more adaptive performance he/she would have.&lt;ref&gt;Stokes, C. K., Schneider, T. R., &amp; Lyons, J. B. (2008). Predicting Adaptive Performance in Multicultural Teams: a Causal Model. In ''NATO HFM Symposium on Adaptability in Team Coalitions, Copenhagen, Denmark''.&lt;/ref&gt;  This relationship is mediated by [[self-efficacy]], which is a belief about one's capacities for certain tasks.  Challenging rather than threatening appraisals would lead to higher levels of self-efficacy, and thus benefit individuals' adaptive performance.

=== Stress coping ===
[[Coping (psychology)|Coping]], as a form of response to [[stressors]], describes how individuals handle stressful events.  It is very close to one dimension of adaptive performance by definition (i.e., the Handling Work Stress dimension), and coping has been suggested to be another form of [[adaptation]].&lt;ref name=ployhart2006 /&gt;  However, they are still different constructions.  
[[coping (psychology)|Stress coping]] could be divided into several styles and strategies based on several theories.  One general idea is to divide coping as active coping and avoidant coping.&lt;ref&gt;Aspinwall, L. G., &amp; Taylor, S. E. (1997). A stitch in time: self-regulation and proactive [[Coping (psychology)|coping]]. ''Psychological bulletin, 121''(3), 417.&lt;/ref&gt;  Active coping means to proactively address and resolve stressful events, like quitting a stressful job and changing into a less overwhelming one.  Avoidant [[coping (psychology)|coping]] means to reduce stress by ignoring it, like involving in problematic drinking.  Another set of coping strategy types includes problem-focused coping and emotion-focused coping.&lt;ref&gt;Carver, C. S., &amp; Connor-Smith, J. (2010). Personality and coping. ''Annual Review of Psychology, 61'', 679-704.&lt;/ref&gt;  Problem-focused coping involves using skills and knowledge to deal with the cause of their problems.  Emotion-focused coping involves releasing negative emotions by ways like distracting or disclaiming.
Adaptive performance involves a mixture of different coping strategies.  Because adaptive performance concerns positive aspects of behaviors, it is more closely related to coping strategies that have positive effects, such as active coping and problem-focused coping.&lt;ref&gt;Shields, N. (2001). Stress, active coping, and academic performance among persisting and nonpersisting college students. ''Journal of Applied Biobehavioral Research, 6''(2), 65-81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Struthers, C. W., Perry, R. P., &amp; Menec, V. H. (2000). An examination of the relationship among academic stress, coping, motivation, and performance in college. ''Research in higher education, 41''(5), 581-592.&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, adaptive performance is more likely to contain such behaviors in stressful situations.

== Team adaptive performance ==

=== Definition ===
In addition to individual adaptive performance, psychologists are also interested in adaptive performance at team level.  Team adaptive performance is defined as an emergent phenomenon that compiles over time from the unfolding of a recursive cycle whereby one or more team members use their resources to functionally change current cognitive or behavioral goal-directed action or structures to meet expected or unexpected demands.  It is a multilevel phenomenon that emanates as team members and teams recursively display behavioral processes and draw on and update emergent cognitive states to engage in change.  Team adaptive performance is considered as the core and proximal temporal [[antecedent (behavioral psychology)|antecedents]] to team adaptation, which could be seen as a change in team performance in response to a salient cue or cue stream that leads to a functional outcome for the entire team.&lt;ref name=burke2006&gt;Burke, C. S., Stagl, K. C., Salas, E., Pierce, L., &amp; Kendall, D. (2006). Understanding team adaptation: a conceptual analysis and model. The Journal of Applied Psychology, 91(6), 1189–207.&lt;/ref&gt;
Along with the definition of team adaptive performance, researchers came up with a four-stage model to describe the process of team adaptive performance.  The four core constructs characterizing this adaptive cycle include: (1) situation assessment; (2) plan formulation; (3) plan execution, via adaptive interaction processes; and (4) team learning, as well as emergent cognitive states (i.e., shared mental models, team [[situational awareness]], [[psychological safety]]), which serve as both proximal outcomes and inputs to this cycle.&lt;ref name=burke2006 /&gt;
Team adaptive performance differs from individual adaptive performance from several aspects.  Team adaptive performance reflects the extent to which the team meets its objectives during a transfer performance episode, whereas individual adaptive performance reflects the extent to which each member effectively executes his or her role in the team during the transfer episode.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, G., Thomas, B., &amp; Wallace, J. C. (2005). A multilevel examination of the relationships among training outcomes, mediating regulatory processes, and adaptive performance. The Journal of Applied Psychology, 90(5), 827–41.&lt;/ref&gt;  Team adaptive performance also has different antecedents compared with individual adaptive performance.

=== Predictors ===
People have identified several dispositional and contextual factors that would affect team adaptive performance.  The most obvious and natural predictor of team adaptive performance is characteristics of team members, or [[team composition]].  Team composition with respect to members' cognitive ability is positively associated with team adaptive performance, with a moderation effect of [[goal orientation|team goals]].  Teams with difficult goals and staffed with high-performance orientation members are especially unlikely to adapt. Teams with difficult goals and staffed with high-learning orientation members are especially likely to adapt.&lt;ref&gt;LePine, J. a. (2005). Adaptation of teams in response to unforeseen change: effects of goal difficulty and team composition in terms of cognitive ability and goal orientation. The Journal of Applied Psychology, 90(6), 1153–67.&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, team members' self-leadership, conscientiousness, and attitudes could also influence team adaptive performance.&lt;ref&gt;Hauschildt, K., &amp; Konradt, U. (2012). Self-leadership and team members' work role performance. Journal of Managerial Psychology, 27(5), 497–517.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thoms, P., Pinto, J. K., Parente, D. H., &amp; Druskat, V. U. (2002). Adaptation to Self-Managing Work Teams. Small Group Research, 33(1), 3–31.&lt;/ref&gt;
Other factors are more related to interactions between team members and team environment, like [[organisation climate|team learning climate]]).&lt;ref name=han2008&gt;Han, T. Y., &amp; Williams, K. J. (2008). Multilevel Investigation of Adaptive Performance: Individual- and Team-Level Relationships. Group &amp; Organization Management.&lt;/ref&gt;  Among them coordination of team members has been proved to be a most influential factor.  Teams' ability to adapt their coordination activities to changing situational demands is crucial to team performance.  A stronger increase in the teams' adaptive coordination was found to be related to better performance.&lt;ref&gt;Burtscher, M. J., Wacker, J., Grote, G., &amp; Manser, T. (2010). Managing Nonroutine Events in Anesthesia: The Role of Adaptive Coordination. Human Factors: The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society, 52(2), 282–294.&lt;/ref&gt;  Researchers have posited that the maintenance of coordinated effort and activities ("coordination maintenance") is necessary for high team adaptive performance. This is because even with well-adapted individual performance, [[workflow]] at the team level often becomes disrupted, "overflowing" in particular directions. Overflow may create excessive work demands for some team members, while encouraging social loafing among those who are in the ebb of the workflow (see [[social loafing]]).&lt;ref&gt;Karau, S. J., &amp; Williams, K. D. (1993). Social loafing: A meta-analytic review and theoretical integration. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 65(4), 681.&lt;/ref&gt;  This suggests that, although team members may have their own task boundaries, and individual adaptive performance may depend on each member's individual capabilities, however to the team, each employee's adaptive performance may result in successful completion of the team task only if all activities are coordinated and synchronized in a holistic fashion.  Team learning climate also displays a significant, positive relationship with team adaptive performance.&lt;ref name=han2008 /&gt;

==Leadership==
Studies show that for an individual to show [[leadership]], they must not only perform well but the individual would need to be an adaptive learner as well.&lt;ref name=hall2006&gt;Hall, D., &amp; Karaevli, A. (2006). How career variety promotes the adaptability of managers: a theoretical model. Journal of Vocational Behavior, 69(6), 359-373.&lt;/ref&gt; An individual who displays adaptive qualities and productivity in a team will most likely also display strong leadership characteristics.&lt;ref name=curnow2011&gt;Curnow, C., Fallesen, J., &amp; Glaze, H. (2011). A selective review of leadership studies in the u.s. army. MILITARY PSYCHOLOGY, 23(1), 462-478.&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations value adaptive performance in the leadership characteristics an individual possess, as it has proven to help workers maintain productivity in a dynamic work environment.&lt;ref&gt;Xenikou, A., &amp; Simosi, M. (2006). Organizational culture and transformational leadership as predictors of business unit performance. Journal of Managerial Psychology, 21(6), 566-579.&lt;/ref&gt; For leaders to successfully perform their roles, they must be able to effectively address tasks and also be able to overcome social challenges.&lt;ref&gt;Halpin, S. (2011). Historical influences on the changing nature of leadership within the military environment. MILITARY PSYCHOLOGY, 23(1), 479-488.&lt;/ref&gt; Adaptive performance is a critical characteristic to have when being the leader of an organization because it aids in successfully handling any workplace situations that may arise and helping an organization progress.&lt;ref name=herman2010&gt;Herman, J., Nelson, J., &amp; Zaccaro, S. (2010). Strategic information provision and experiential variety as tools for developing adaptive leadership skills. Consulting Psychology Journal:Practice and Research, 62(2), 131-142.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of resisting change in the workplace, a team leader with adaptive performance establishes a new behavior appropriate to the situation to shift a potential problem into a positive outcome.&lt;ref name=mason2010&gt;Mason, C., &amp; Parker, M. (2010). Leader vision and the development of adaptive and proactive performance: a longitudinal study. Journal of Applied Psychology, 95(1), 174-182.&lt;/ref&gt; The correct type of leadership makes a positive change in the characteristics of a team's adaptability to assist in maintaining a healthy and positive workforce.&lt;ref name=hall2006 /&gt; Employees who display adaptive performance in leadership set an example for their colleagues specifically in showcasing the best way to prepare and handle adaptation in occurring organizational changes.&lt;ref name=akremi&gt;Akremi, A., Vandenberghe, C., &amp; Voirin, A. (2010). A multilevel model of transformational leadership and adaptive performance and the moderating role of climate for innovation. Group &amp; Organization Management, 35(3), 699-726.&lt;/ref&gt; Adaptive performance in leadership is valued by employers because an employee who displays those two characteristics tends to exemplify and motivate adaptive behavior within other individuals in the workforce.&lt;ref name=herman2010 /&gt;

===Transformational leadership===
In organizational situations where adaptability to the environment and difficult challenges occur often, an individual who possess [[transformational leadership]] is preferred.&lt;ref name=conchie2013&gt;Conchie, S. (2013). Transformational leadership, intrinsic motivation, and trust: a moderated-mediated model of workplace safety. Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 18(2), 198-210.&lt;/ref&gt; Transformational leadership is a leadership style that encourages team members to imagine new ideas of change and to take action on these ideas to help handle certain situations.&lt;ref name=akremi /&gt; This particular leadership style is commonly used in organizations, due to its positive outcomes such as higher [[work engagement]], [[motivation]], and [[creativity]] in employees.&lt;ref name=conchie2013 /&gt; 
Parker and Mason's 2010 study introduced a relationship between transformational leadership with work adaptation and work performance.&lt;ref name=mason2010 /&gt; The study stated that transformational leadership relates to adaptive performance by having team members become creative in the different strategies that can be used when approaching a certain situation which eventually leads to a higher performance.&lt;ref name=mason2010 /&gt; Being creative and handling stressful situations the team leader as well as the team exemplifies the dimensions of adaptive performance.&lt;ref name=balthazard2013&gt;Balthazard, P., Hannah, S., Jennings, P., &amp; Waldman, D. (2013). The psychological and neurological bases of leader self-complexity and effects on adaptive decision-making. Journal of Applied Psychology,98(3), 393-411.&lt;/ref&gt; This particular leadership style has also been shown as a motivator to increase the behavior of performance and adaptability in employees.&lt;ref name=akremi /&gt;  An individual showcasing transformational leadership has the ability to encourage more adaptive and productive behavior within team members through presenting new ideas and possible outcomes in the workplace.&lt;ref name=akremi /&gt;

===Leadership and adaptive decision making===
An individual who displays leadership adaptability is one who is able to adjust their thoughts and behavior to attain appropriate responses to complex situations helping them make [[decision-making|appropriate decisions]].&lt;ref name=balthazard2013 /&gt; A leader must make decisions and be adaptable to any organizational changes in order for the team to collectively continue workplace productivity.&lt;ref name=hall2006 /&gt;  An adaptive leader makes decisions to perform a specific action to better fit the organization and help it become productive.&lt;ref name=kwantes2013&gt;Kwantes, P., Neal, A., &amp; Vuckovic, A. (2013). Adaptive decision making in a dynamic environment: a test of a sequential sampling model of relative judgment. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied, 19(3), 266-284.&lt;/ref&gt; By a leader displaying adaptive performance when making a decision, the team leader shows their awareness of a situation leading to new actions and strategies to reestablish fit and effectiveness.&lt;ref name=curnow2011 /&gt; Organizations value the characteristic of adaptive decision making in an individual as it displays an individual's understanding and adjusting capabilities to a difficult situation further aiding in the decision making process.&lt;ref name=kwantes2013 /&gt;

[[File:William Morris design for Trellis wallpaper 1862.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|[[William Morris]] design for "Trellis" wallpaper, 1862]]
The '''Arts and Crafts movement''' was an international movement in the decorative and fine arts that began in Britain and flourished in Europe and North America between about 1880 and 1920, emerging in Japan (the [[Mingei]] movement) in the 1920s. It stood for traditional craftsmanship using simple forms, and often used medieval, romantic, or folk styles of decoration. It advocated economic and social reform and was essentially anti-industrial.&lt;ref name="king"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moses N. Ikiugu and Elizabeth A. Ciaravino, ''Psychosocial Conceptual Practice models in Occupational Therapy''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher= [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] | url= http://www.vam.ac.uk/vastatic/microsites/british_galleries/bg_styles/Style09a/index.html | title= Arts and Crafts Style Guide | work=British Galleries | accessdate= 2007-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had a strong influence on the arts in Europe until it was displaced by [[Modernism]] in the 1930s,&lt;ref name="grove"/&gt; and its influence continued among craft makers, designers, and town planners long afterwards.&lt;ref name=maccarthy2014/&gt;

The term was first used by [[T. J. Cobden-Sanderson]] at a meeting of the [[Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society]] in 1887,&lt;ref name=crawford&gt;Alan Crawford, ''C. R. Ashbee: Architect, Designer &amp; Romantic Socialist'', Yale University Press, 2005. {{ISBN|0300109393}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the principles and style on which it was based had been developing in England for at least twenty years. It was inspired by the ideas of architect [[Augustus Pugin]], writer [[John Ruskin]], and designer [[William Morris]].&lt;ref name=triggs&gt;{{Cite book| url = https://books.google.com/?id=1woOAQAAIAAJ | first= Oscar Lovell | last=Triggs | title=Chapters in the History of the Arts and Crafts Movement | year = 1902}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement developed earliest and most fully in the British Isles,&lt;ref name="grove"&gt;{{Cite book | title = The Grove Encyclopedia of [[Decorative Arts]], Volume 1 | isbn = 978-0-19-518948-3 | first = Gordon | last = Campbell | publisher = Oxford University Press| year = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and spread across the British Empire and to the rest of Europe and North America.&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Kaplan and Alan Crawford, ''The Arts &amp; Crafts Movement in Europe &amp; America: Design for the Modern World'', Los Angeles County Museum of Art&lt;/ref&gt; It was largely a reaction against the perceived impoverished state of the [[decorative arts]] at the time and the conditions in which they were produced.&lt;ref name="king"&gt;Brenda M. King, ''Silk and Empire''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and influences==
===Design reform===
The Arts and Crafts movement emerged from the attempt to reform design and decoration in mid 19th century Britain. It was a reaction against a perceived decline in standards that the reformers associated with machinery and factory production. Their critique was sharpened by the items they saw in [[the Great Exhibition of 1851]], which they considered to be excessively ornate, artificial and ignorant of the qualities of the materials used.


The art historian [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] has said that exhibits in the Great Exhibition showed "ignorance of that basic need in creating patterns, the integrity of the surface" and "vulgarity in detail".&lt;ref name=pevsner/&gt; Design reform began with the organisers of the Exhibition itself, [[Henry Cole]] (1808–1882), [[Owen Jones (architect)|Owen Jones]] (1809–1874), [[Matthew Digby Wyatt]] (1820–1877) and [[Richard Redgrave]] (1804–1888),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/w/wallpaper-design-reform/ V&amp;A, "Wallpaper Design Reform"]&lt;/ref&gt; who deprecated excessive ornament and impractical and badly made things.{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=21}} The organisers were "unanimous in their condemnation of the exhibits."{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=20}} Owen Jones, for example, complained that "the architect, the upholsterer, the paper-stainer, the weaver, the calico-printer, and the potter" produce "in art novelty without beauty, or beauty without intelligence."{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=20}} From these criticisms of the contemporary state of manufactured goods emerged several publications which set out what the writers considered to be the correct principles of design. Richard Redgrave's ''Supplementary Report on Design'' (1852) analysed the principles of design and ornament and pleaded for "more logic in the application of decoration."{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=21}} Other works followed in a similar vein: Wyatt's ''Industrial Arts of the Nineteenth Century'' (1853), [[Gottfried Semper]]'s ''Wissenschaft, Industrie und Kunst'' ("Science, Industry and Art") (1852), [[Ralph Wornum]]'s ''Analysis of Ornament'' (1856), Redgrave's ''Manual of Design'' (1876) and Jones's ''Grammar of Ornament'' (1856).{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=21}} The ''Grammar of Ornament'' was particularly influential, liberally distributed as a student prize and running into nine reprints by 1910.{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=21}}

Jones declared that "Ornament ... must be secondary to the thing decorated", that there must be "fitness in the ornament to the thing ornamented", and that wallpapers and carpets must not have any patterns "suggestive of anything but a level or plain".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Nikolaus Pevsner, ''Pioneers of Modern Design''&lt;/ref&gt; Where a fabric or wallpaper in the Great Exhibition might be decorated with a natural motif made to look as real as possible, these writers advocated flat and simplified natural motifs. Redgrave insisted that "style" demanded sound construction before ornamentation, and a proper awareness of the quality of materials used. "''Utility'' must have precedence over ornamentation."{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=22}}

[[File:Kelmscott Press - The Nature of Gothic by John Ruskin (first page).jpg|thumb|upright|''The Nature of Gothic'' by John Ruskin, printed by William Morris at the Kelmscott Press in 1892 in his [[Golden Type]] inspired by the 15th century printer [[Nicolas Jenson]]. This chapter from ''The Stones of Venice'' was a sort of manifesto for the Arts and Crafts movement.]]

However, the design reformers of the mid 19th century did not go as far as the designers of the Arts and Crafts Movement: they were more concerned with ornamentation than construction, they had an incomplete understanding of methods of manufacture,{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=22}} and they did not criticise industrial methods as such. By contrast, the Arts and Crafts movement was as much a movement of social reform as design reform and its leading practitioners did not separate the two.

===A. W. N. Pugin===

[[File:The Grange, Ramsgate 1.jpg|thumb|right|Pugin's house, "The Grange", in Ramsgate, 1843. Its simplified Gothic style, adapted to domestic building, helped shape the architecture of the Arts and Crafts Movement.]]

Some of the ideas of the movement were anticipated by [[A.W.N. Pugin]] (1812–1852), a leader in the [[Gothic revival architecture|Gothic revival in architecture]]. For example, he, like the Arts and Crafts artists, advocated truth to material, structure and function.&lt;ref name=V&amp;A /&gt; Pugin articulated the tendency of social critics to compare the faults of modern society (such as the sprawling growth of cities and the treatment of the poor) unfavorably with the Middle Ages,&lt;ref name=hill&gt;Rosemary Hill, ''God's Architect: Pugin and the Building of Romantic Britain'', London: Allen Lane, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; a tendency that became routine with Ruskin, Morris and the Arts and Crafts movement. His book ''Contrasts'' (1836) drew examples of bad modern buildings and town planning in contrast with good medieval examples, and his biographer [[Rosemary Hill]] notes that in it he "reached conclusions, almost in passing, about the importance of craftsmaship and tradition in architecture that it would take the rest of the century and the combined efforts of Ruskin and Morris to work out in detail." She describes the spare furnishings he specified for a building in 1841—"rush chairs, oak tables"—as "the Arts and Crafts interior in embryo."&lt;ref name=hill /&gt;

===John Ruskin===
{{expand section|date=December 2014}}
The Arts and Crafts philosophy derived in large measure from [[John Ruskin]]'s social criticism, which related the moral and social health of a nation to the qualities of its architecture and to the nature of work. Ruskin (1819–1900) considered the sort of mechanized production and division of labour that had been created in the [[industrial revolution]] to be "servile labour" and he thought that a healthy and moral society required independent workers who designed the things they made. His followers favoured craft production over industrial manufacture and were concerned about the loss of traditional skills, but they were arguably more troubled by the effects of the [[factory system]] than by machinery itself&lt;ref name=sarsby&gt;Jacqueline Sarsby" Alfred Powell: Idealism and Realism in the Cotswolds", ''Journal of Design History'', Vol. 10, No. 4, pp. 375-397&lt;/ref&gt; and William Morris's idea of "handicraft" was essentially work without any division of labour rather than work without any sort of machinery.&lt;ref name=pye&gt;David Pye, ''The Nature and Art of Workmanship'', Cambridge University Press, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

===William Morris===
[[File:William Morris age 53.jpg|thumb|upright|William Morris, the main influence on the Arts and Crafts Movement]]
[[William Morris]] (1834–1896), the towering figure in late 19th century design, was the main influence on the Arts and Crafts movement. The aesthetic and social vision of the Arts and Crafts movement derived from ideas he developed in the 1850s with a group of students at the [[University of Oxford]], who combined a love of [[Romantic literature]] with a commitment to social reform.{{sfn|Naylor|1971|pp=96-97}} By 1855 they had discovered Ruskin and, believing there to be a contrast between the barbarity of contemporary art and the painters preceding [[Raphael]] (1483-1530), they formed themselves into the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] to pursue their artistic aims. The [[medieval]]ism of [[Mallory]]'s ''[[Morte d'Arthur]]'' set the standard for their early style.{{sfn|Wildman|1998|p=49}} In [[Edward Burne-Jones]]' words, they intended to "wage Holy warfare against the age".{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=97}}

[[File:The Red House, Bexleyheath.JPG|thumb|William Morris's [[Red House (London)|Red House]] in London designed by Philip Webb. Completed 1860, it is one of the most significant buildings of the Arts and Crafts Movement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/red-house#Overview National Trust, "Iconic Arts and Crafts home of William Morris"]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Morris began experimenting with various crafts and designing [[furniture]] and [[interior design|interiors]].{{sfn|MacCarthy|2009}} He was personally involved in manufacture as well as design,{{sfn|MacCarthy|2009}} which was to be the hallmark of the Arts and Crafts movement. Ruskin had argued that the separation of the intellectual act of design from the manual act of physical creation was both socially and aesthetically damaging; Morris further developed this idea, insisting that no work should be carried out in his workshops before he had personally mastered the appropriate techniques and materials, arguing that "without dignified, creative human occupation people became disconnected from life".{{sfn|MacCarthy|2009}}

[[File:Morris and Company Weaving at Merton Abbey.jpg|thumb|The weaving shed in Morris &amp; Co's factory at [[Merton (historic parish)|Merton]], which opened in the 1880s]]

In 1861 Morris began making furniture and decorative objects commercially, modeling his designs on medieval styles and using bold forms and strong colors. His patterns were based on flora and fauna  and his products were inspired by the vernacular or domestic traditions of the British countryside. In order to display the beauty of the materials and the work of the craftsman, some were deliberately left unfinished, creating a rustic appearance. Truth to materials, structure and function became characteristic of the Arts and Crafts movement.

Unlike their counterparts in the United States, most Arts and Crafts practitioners in Britain had strong, slightly incoherent, negative feelings about machinery. They thought of 'the craftsman' as free, creative, and working with his hands, 'the machine' as soulless, repetitive, and inhuman. These contrasting images derive in part from John Ruskin's (1819-1900) ''The Stones of Venice'', an architectural history of Venice that contains a powerful denunciation of modern industrialism to which Arts and Crafts designers returned again and again. Distrust for the machine lay behind the many little workshops that turned their backs on the industrial world around 1900, using preindustrial techniques to create what they called 'crafts.'

===Critique of industry===
William Morris shared Ruskin's critique of industrial society and at one time or another attacked the modern factory, the use of machinery, the division of labour, capitalism and the loss of traditional craft methods. But his attitude to machinery was inconsistent. He said at one point that production by machinery was "altogether an evil",&lt;ref name=pevsner/&gt; but at others he was willing to commission work from manufacturers who were able to meet his standards with the aid of machines;&lt;ref&gt;Graeme Shankland, "William Morris - Designer", in Asa Briggs (ed.) ''William Morris: Selected Writings and Designs'', Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1980 {{ISBN|0-14-020521-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he said that, in a "true society", where neither luxuries nor cheap trash were made, machinery could be improved and used to reduce the hours of labour.&lt;ref&gt;William Morris, "Useful Work versus Useless Toil", in Asa Briggs (ed.) ''William Morris: Selected Writings and Designs'', Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1980 {{ISBN|0-14-020521-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fiona MacCarthy says that "unlike later zealots like [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]], William Morris had no practical objections to the use of machinery ''per se'' so long as the machines produced the quality he needed."{{sfn|MacCarthy|1994|p=351}}

Morris insisted that the artist should be a craftsman-designer working by hand&lt;ref name=pevsner/&gt; and advocated a society of free craftspeople, such as he believed had existed during the Middle Ages. "Because craftsmen took pleasure in their work", he wrote, "the Middle Ages was a period of greatness the art of the common people. ... The treasures in our museums now are only the common utensils used in households of that age, when hundreds of medieval churches—each one a masterpiece—were built by unsophisticated peasants."&lt;ref name=mingei/&gt; Medieval art was the model for much Arts and Crafts design and medieval life, literature and building was idealised by the movement.

Morris's followers also had differing views about machinery and the factory system. [[Charles Robert Ashbee|C.&amp;nbsp;R. Ashbee]], for example, a central figure in the Arts and Crafts Movement, said in 1888, that, "We do not reject the machine, we welcome it. But we would desire to see it mastered."&lt;ref name=pevsner/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ashbee, C.&amp;nbsp;R., ''A Few Chapters on Workshop Construction and Citizenship'', London, 1894.&lt;/ref&gt; After unsuccessfully pitting his Guild and School of Handicraft guild against modern methods of manufacture, he acknowledged that "Modern civilization rests on machinery",&lt;ref name=pevsner/&gt; but he continued to criticize the deleterious effects of what he called "mechanism", saying that "the production of certain mechanical commodities is as bad for the national health as is the production of slave-grown cane or child-sweated wares."&lt;ref&gt;"C.&amp;nbsp;R. Ashbee, ''Should We Stop Teaching Art?'', New York and London: Garland, 1978, p.12 (Facsimile of the 1911 edition)&lt;/ref&gt;  [[William Arthur Smith Benson]], on the other hand, had no qualms about adapting the Arts and Crafts style to metalwork produced under industrial conditions. (See quotation box.)

Morris and his followers believed the division of labour on which modern industry depended was undesirable, but the extent to which every design should be carried out by the designer was a matter for debate and disagreement. Not all Arts and Crafts artists carried out every stage in the making of goods themselves, and it was only in the twentieth century that that became essential to the definition of craftsmanship. Although Morris was famous for getting hands-on experience himself of many crafts (including weaving, dying, printing, calligraphy and embroidery), he did not regard the separation of designer and executant in his factory as problematic. Walter Crane, a close political associate of Morris's, took an unsympathetic view of the division of labour on both moral and artistic grounds, and strongly advocated that designing and making should come from the same hand. Lewis Foreman Day, a friend and contemporary of Crane's, as unstinting as Crane in his admiration of Morris, disagreed strongly with Crane. He thought that the separation of design and execution was not only inevitable in the modern world, but also that only that sort of specialisation allowed the best in design and the best in making.&lt;ref&gt;[https://marshallcolman.blogspot.co.uk/2017/06/designer-and-executant-argument-between.html Designer and Executant: An Argument Between Walter Crane and Lewis Foreman Day]&lt;/ref&gt;  Few of the founders of the [[Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society]] insisted that the designer should also be the maker. Peter Floud, writing in the 1950s, said that "The founders of the Society ... never executed their own designs, but invariably turned them over to commercial firms."&lt;ref name=floud&gt;Peter Floud, "The crafts then and now", ''The Studio'', 1953, p.127&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that the designer should be the maker and the maker the designer derived "not from Morris or early Arts and Crafts teaching, but rather from the second-generation elaboration doctrine worked out in the first decade of [the twentieth] century by men such as [[W. R. Lethaby]]".&lt;ref name=floud/&gt;

===Socialism===
Many of the Arts and Crafts Movement designers were socialists, including Morris, [[T. J. Cobden Sanderson]], [[Walter Crane]], C.R.Ashbee, [[Philip Webb]], [[Charles Joseph Faulkner|Charles Faulkner]] and [[A.H.Mackmurdo]].{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=109}} In the early 1880s Morris was spending more of his time on socialist propaganda than on designing and making.{{sfn|MacCarthy|1994|page=640-663}} Ashbee established a community of craftsmen, the Guild of Handicraft, in east London, later moving to [[Chipping Campden]].&lt;ref name=crawford/&gt; Those adherents who were not socialists, for example, [[Alfred Hoare Powell]],&lt;ref name=sarsby/&gt; advocated a more humane and personal relationship between employer and employee. [[Lewis Foreman Day]], a very successful and influential Arts and Crafts designer, was not a socialist either, despite his long friendship with Crane.

===Association with other reform movements===
{{expand section|date=November 2017}}
In Britain the movement was associated with [[dress reform]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/v/victorian-dress-at-v-and-a/ V&amp;A, "Victorian Dress at the V&amp;A"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[ruralism]], the [[garden city movement]]&lt;ref name=maccarthy2014&gt;Fiona MacCarthy, ''Anarchy and Beauty: William Morris and his Legacy 1860-1960'', London: National Portrait Gallery, 2014 {{ISBN|978 185514 484 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cecil Sharp|the folk-song revival]]. All were linked, in some degree, by the ideal of "the Simple Life".&lt;ref&gt;Fiona McCarthy. ''The Simple Life'', Lund Humphries, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; In continental Europe the movement was associated with the preservation of national traditions in building, the applied arts, domestic design and costume.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==Development==
Morris's designs quickly became popular, attracting interest when his company's work was exhibited at the [[1862 International Exhibition]] in London. Much of Morris &amp; Co's early work was for churches and Morris won important interior design commissions at [[St James's Palace]] and the [[South Kensington Museum]] (now the Victoria and Albert Museum). Later his work became popular with the middle and upper classes, despite his wish to create a democratic art, and by the end of the 19th century, Arts and Crafts design in houses and domestic interiors was the dominant style in Britain, copied in products made by conventional industrial methods.

The spread of Arts and Crafts ideas during the late 19th and early 20th centuries resulted in the establishment of many associations and craft communities, although Morris had little to do with them because of his preoccupation with socialism at the time. A hundred and thirty Arts and Crafts organisations were formed in Britain, most between 1895 and 1905.{{sfn|MacCarthy|1994|page=602|}}

In 1881, [[Eglantyne Louisa Jebb]], [[Mary Fraser Tytler]] and others initiated the [[Home Arts and Industries Association]] to encourage the working classes, especially those in rural areas, to take up handicrafts under supervision, not for profit, but in order to provide them with useful occupations and to improve their taste. By 1889 it had 450 classes, 1,000 teachers and 5,000 students.{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=120}}

In 1882, architect [[A.H.Mackmurdo]] formed the [[Century Guild of Artists|Century Guild]], a partnership of designers including [[Selwyn Image]], [[Herbert Horne]], Clement Heaton and [[Benjamin Creswick]].{{sfn|MacCarthy|1994|page=591}}{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=115}}

In 1884, the [[Art Workers Guild]] was initiated by five young architects, [[William Lethaby]], [[Edward Schroeder Prior|Edward Prior]], [[Ernest Newton]], Mervyn Macartney and [[Gerald C. Horsley]], with the goal of bringing together fine and applied arts and raising the status of the latter. It was directed originally by [[George Blackall Simonds]]. By 1890 the Guild had 150 members, representing the increasing number of practitioners of the Arts and Crafts style.{{sfn|MacCarthy|1994|page=593}} It still exists.

The London department store [[Liberty &amp; Co.]], founded in 1875, was a prominent retailer of goods in the style and of the "[[artistic dress]]" favoured by followers of the Arts and Crafts movement.

In 1887 the [[Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society]], which gave its name to the movement, was formed with [[Walter Crane]] as president, holding its first exhibition in the [[New Gallery (London)|New Gallery]], London, in November 1888.&lt;ref&gt;Parry, Linda, ''William Morris and the Arts and Crafts Movement: A Sourcebook'', New York, Portland House, 1989 {{ISBN|0-517-69260-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first show of contemporary decorative arts in London since the [[Grosvenor Gallery]]'s Winter Exhibition of 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chestofbooks.com/arts/essays/Theoretical-Practical-Critical-Ideals/Of-The-Arts-And-Crafts-Movement-Part-4.html |title=Crane, Walter, "Of the Arts and Crafts Movement", in '&amp;#39;Ideals In Art: Papers Theoretical Practical Critical'&amp;#39;, George Bell &amp; Sons, 1905 |publisher=Chestofbooks.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Morris &amp; Co.]] was well represented in the exhibition with furniture, fabrics, carpets and embroideries. [[Edward Burne-Jones]] observed, "here for the first time one can measure a bit the change that has happened in the last twenty years".{{sfn|MacCarthy|1994|page=596}} The society still exists as the Society of Designer Craftsmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.societyofdesignercraftsmen.org.uk/ |title=Society of Designer Craftsmen |publisher=Society of Designer Craftsmen |date= |accessdate=2010-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1888, [[Charles Robert Ashbee|C.R.Ashbee]], a major late practitioner of the style in England, founded the [[Guild and School of Handicraft]] in the East End of London. The guild was a craft co-operative modelled on the medieval guilds and intended to give working men satisfaction in their craftsmanship. Skilled craftsmen, working on the principles of Ruskin and Morris, were to produce hand-crafted goods and manage a school for apprentices. The idea was greeted with enthusiasm by almost everyone except Morris, who was by now involved with promoting [[socialism]] and thought Ashbee's scheme trivial. From 1888 to 1902 the guild prospered, employing about 50 men. In 1902 Ashbee relocated the guild out of London to begin an experimental community in [[Chipping Campden]] in the [[Cotswolds]]. The guild's work is characterized by plain surfaces of hammered silver, flowing wirework and colored stones in simple settings. Ashbee designed jewellery and silver tableware. The guild flourished at Chipping Camden but did not prosper and was liquidated in 1908. Some craftsmen stayed, contributing to the tradition of modern craftsmanship in the area.&lt;ref name=V&amp;A/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utopia-britannica.org.uk/pages/Ashbee.htm |title=Utopia Britannica |publisher=Utopia Britannica |date= |accessdate=2010-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courtbarn.org.uk/home |title=Court Barn Museum |publisher=Courtbarn.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[C.F.A. Voysey]] (1857–1941) was an Arts and Crafts architect who also designed fabrics, tiles, ceramics, furniture and metalwork.  His style combined simplicity with sophistication. His wallpapers and textiles, featuring stylised bird and plant forms in bold outlines with flat colors, were used widely.&lt;ref name=V&amp;A/&gt;

Morris's thought influenced the [[distributism]] of [[G. K. Chesterton]] and [[Hilaire Belloc]].&lt;ref&gt;Letter, Joseph Nuttgens, London Review of Books, 13 May 2010 p 4&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the nineteenth century, Arts and Crafts ideals had influenced architecture, painting, sculpture, graphics, illustration, book making and photography, domestic design and the decorative arts, including furniture and woodwork, stained glass,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cormack|first1=Peter|title=Arts and Crafts Stained Glass|date=2015|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven and London|isbn=978-0-300-20970-9|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt; leatherwork, lacemaking, embroidery, rug making and weaving, jewelry and metalwork, [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]]ing and ceramics.&lt;ref name="dublin"/&gt; By 1910, there was a fashion for "Arts and Crafts" and all things hand-made. There was a proliferation of amateur handicrafts of variable quality&lt;ref&gt;"Arts and Crafts", ''Journal of the Royal Society of Arts'', Vol. 56, No. 2918, 23 October 1908, pp. 1023-1024&lt;/ref&gt; and of incompetent imitators who caused the public to regard Arts and Crafts as "something less, instead of more, competent and fit for purpose than an ordinary mass produced article."&lt;ref&gt;[[Noel Rooke]], "The Craftsman and Education for Industry", in ''Four Papers Read by Members of the Arts &amp; Crafts Exhibition Society'', London: Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society, 1935&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society held eleven exhibitions between 1888 and 1916. By the outbreak of war in 1914 it was in decline and faced a crisis. Its 1912 exhibition had been a financial failure.&lt;ref name=harrod&gt;Tania Harrod, ''The Crafts in Britain in the 20th Century'', Yale University Press, 1999. {{ISBN|0-300-07780-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; While designers in continental Europe were making innovations in design and alliances with industry through initiatives such as the [[Deutsche Werkbund]] and new initiatives were being taken in Britain by the [[Omega Workshops]] and the [[Design in Industries Association]], the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society, now under the control of an old guard, was withdrawing from commerce and collaboration with manufacturers into purist handwork and what Tania Harrod describes as "decommoditisation"&lt;ref name=harrod/&gt; Its rejection of a commercial role has been seen as a turning point in its fortunes.&lt;ref name=harrod/&gt; Nikolaus Pevsner in his book ''Pioneers of Modern Design'' presents the Arts and Crafts Movement as design radicals who influenced the modern movement, but failed to change and were eventually superseded by it.&lt;ref name=pevsner/&gt;

===Later influences===
The British artist potter [[Bernard Leach]] brought to England many ideas he had developed in Japan with the social critic [[Yanagi Soetsu]] about the moral and social value of simple crafts; both were enthusiastic readers of Ruskin. Leach was an active propagandist for these ideas, which struck a chord with practitioners of the crafts in the inter-war years, and he expounded them in ''A Potter's Book'', published in 1940, which denounced industrial society in terms as vehement as those of Ruskin and Morris. Thus the Arts and Crafts philosophy was perpetuated among British craft workers in the 1950s and 1960s, long after the demise of the Arts and Crafts movement and at the high tide of Modernism. British [[Utility furniture]] of the 1940s also derived from Arts and Crafts principles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vads.ahds.ac.uk/learning/designingbritain/html/crd_desref.html Designing Britain] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100515141802/http://vads.ahds.ac.uk/learning/designingbritain/html/crd_desref.html |date=May 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of its main promoters, [[Sydney Gordon Russell|Gordon Russell]], chairman of the Utility Furniture Design Panel, was imbued with Arts and Crafts ideas. He manufactured furniture in the Cotswold Hills, a region of Arts and Crafts furniture-making since Ashbee, and he was a member of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society. William Morris's biographer, [[Fiona MacCarthy]], detected the Arts and Crafts philosophy even behind the [[Festival of Britain]] (1951), the work of the designer [[Terence Conran]] (b. 1931)&lt;ref name=maccarthy2014/&gt; and the founding of the British [[Crafts Council]] in the 1970s.{{sfn|MacCarthy|1994|page=603}}

==Outside England==

===Ireland===
The movement spread to Ireland, representing an important time for the nation's cultural development, a visual counterpart to the literary revival of the same time&lt;ref&gt;Nicola Gordon Bowe, ''The Irish Arts and Crafts Movement (1886-1925)'', Irish Arts Review Yearbook, 1990-91, pp. 172-185&lt;/ref&gt; and was a publication of Irish nationalism. The Arts and Crafts use of stained glass was popular in Ireland, with [[Harry Clarke]] the best-known artist and also with [[Evie Hone]]. The architecture of the style is represented by the [[Honan Chapel]] (1916) in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] in the grounds of [[University College Cork]]. Other architects practicing in Ireland included Sir [[Edwin Lutyens]] (Heywood House in Co. Laois, Lambay Island and the [[Irish National War Memorial Gardens]] in Dublin) and Frederick 'Pa' Hicks ([[Malahide Castle]] estate buildings and round tower). Irish Celtic motifs were popular with the movement in silvercraft, carpet design, book illustrations and hand-carved furniture.

===Scotland===

The beginnings of the Arts and Crafts movement in Scotland were in the stained glass revival of the 1850s, pioneered by [[James Ballantine]] (1808–77). His major works included the great west window of [[Dunfermline Abbey]] and the scheme for [[St. Giles Cathedral]], Edinburgh. In Glasgow it was pioneered by [[Daniel Cottier]] (1838–91), who had probably studied with Ballantine, and was directly influenced by [[William Morris]], [[Ford Madox Brown]] and [[John Ruskin]]. His key works included the ''Baptism of Christ'' in [[Paisley Abbey]], (c. 1880). His followers included Stephen Adam and his son of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;M. MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), {{ISBN|0500203334}}, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; The Glasgow-born designer and theorist [[Christopher Dresser]] (1834–1904) was one of the first, and most important, independent designers, a pivotal figure in the [[Aesthetic Movement]] and a major contributor to the allied [[Anglo-Japanese]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;H. Lyons, ''Christopher Dresser: The People Designer - 1834–1904'' (Antique Collectors' Club, 2005), {{ISBN|1851494553}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The movement had an "extraordinary flowering" in Scotland where it was represented by the development of the '[[Glasgow Style]]' which was based on the talent of the [[Glasgow School of Art]].  Celtic revival took hold here, and motifs such as the Glasgow rose became popularised. [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] and the Glasgow School of Art were to influence others worldwide.&lt;ref name="grove" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dublin"&gt;Nicola Gordon Bowe and Elizabeth Cumming, ''The Arts And Crafts Movements in Dublin and Edinburgh''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continental Europe===
{{refimprove section|date=September 2014}}

In continental Europe, the revival and preservation of national styles was an important motive of Arts and Crafts designers; for example, in Germany, after unification in 1871 under the encouragement of the ''Bund für Heimatschutz'' (1897)&lt;ref&gt;Ákos Moravánszky, ''Competing visions: aesthetic invention and social imagination in Central European Architecture 1867-1918'', Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Vereinigte Werkstätten für Kunst im Handwerk'' founded in 1898 by Karl Schmidt; and in Hungary [[Károly Kós]] revived the vernacular style of [[Transylvania]]n building. In central Europe, where several diverse nationalities lived under powerful empires (Germany, Austria-Hungary and Russia), the discovery of the vernacular was associated with the assertion of national pride and the striving for independence, and, whereas for Arts and Crafts practitioners in Britain the ideal style was to be found in the medieval, in central Europe it was sought in remote peasant villages.&lt;ref&gt;Andrej Szczerski, "Central Europe", in Karen Livingstone and Linda Parry (eds.), ''International Arts and Crafts'', London: V&amp;A Publications, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Till en liten vira.jpg|thumb|The Swedish artists [[Carl Larsson]] and [[Karin Bergöö Larsson]] were inspired by the Arts and Crafts movement when designing their home.]]
Widely exhibited in Europe, the Arts and Crafts style's simplicity inspired designers like [[Henry van de Velde]] and styles such as [[Art Nouveau]], the Dutch [[De Stijl]] group, [[Vienna Secession]], and eventually the [[Bauhaus]] style. Pevsner regarded the style as a prelude to [[Modernism]], which used simple forms without ornamentation.&lt;ref name="pevsner" &gt;Nikolaus Pevsner, ''Pioneers of Modern Design'', Yale University Press, 2005, {{ISBN|0-300-10571-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest Arts and Crafts activity in continental Europe was in [[Belgium]] in about 1890, where the English style inspired artists and architects including can de Velde, [[Gabriel Van Dievoet]], [[Gustave Serrurier-Bovy]] and a group known as ''[[La Libre Esthétique]]'' (Free Aesthetic).

Arts and Crafts products were admired in Austria and Germany in the early 20th century, and under their inspiration design moved rapidly forward while it stagnated in Britain.{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=183}} The [[Wiener Werkstätte]], founded in 1903 by [[Josef Hoffmann]] and [[Koloman Moser]], was influenced by the Arts and Crafts principles of the "unity of the arts" and the hand-made. The [[Deutscher Werkbund]] (German Association of Craftsmen) was formed in 1907 as an association of artists, architects, designers, and industrialists to improve the global competitiveness of German businesses and became an important element in the development of [[modern architecture]] and industrial design through its advocacy of standardized production. However, its leading members, van de Velde and [[Hermann Muthesius]], had conflicting opinions about standardization. Muthesius believed that it was essential were Germany to become a leading nation in trade and culture. Van de Velde, representing a more traditional Arts and Crafts attitude, believed that artists would forever "protest against the imposition of orders or standardization," and that "The artist ... will never, of his own accord, submit to a discipline which imposes on him a canon or a type." {{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=189}}

In Finland, an idealistic artists' colony in [[Helsinki]] was designed by [[Herman Gesellius]], [[Armas Lindgren]] and [[Eliel Saarinen]],&lt;ref name="grove"/&gt; who worked in the [[National Romantic style]], akin to the British [[Gothic Revival]].

In [[Hungary]], under the influence of Ruskin and Morris, a group of artists and architects, including [[Károly Kós]], [[Aladár Körösfői-Kriesch]] and Ede Toroczkai Wigand, discovered the [[folk art]] and vernacular architecture of [[Transylvania]]. Many of Kós's buildings, including those in the [[Budapest Zoo &amp; Botanical Garden|Budapest zoo]] and the [[Wekerle estate]] in the same city, show this influence.&lt;ref&gt;Széleky András, ''Kós Károly'', Budapest, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

In Russia, [[Viktor Hartmann]], [[Viktor Vasnetsov]], [[Yelena Polenova]] and other artists associated with [[Abramtsevo Colony]] sought to revive the quality of medieval Russian [[decorative arts]] quite independently from the movement in Great Britain.

In Iceland, [[Sölvi Helgason]]'s work shows Arts and Crafts influence.

===North America===

In the United States, the Arts and Crafts style initiated a variety of attempts to reinterpret European Arts and Crafts ideals for Americans. These included the "Craftsman"-style architecture, furniture, and other decorative arts such as designs promoted by [[Gustav Stickley]] in his magazine, ''The Craftsman'' and designs produced on the Roycroft campus as publicized in Elbert Hubbard's ''The Fra''.  Both men used their magazines as a vehicle to promote the goods produced with the Craftsman workshop in Eastwood, NY and Elbert Hubbard's [[Roycroft]] campus in [[East Aurora, NY]]. A host of imitators of Stickley's furniture (the designs of which are often mislabelled the "[[American Craftsman|Mission Style]]") included three companies established by his brothers.

The terms ''[[American Craftsman]]'' or ''Craftsman style'' are often used to denote the style of architecture, interior design, and decorative arts that prevailed between the dominant eras of [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Art Deco]] in the USA, or approximately the period from 1910 to 1925.  The movement was particularly notable for the professional opportunities it opened up for women as artisans, designers and entrepreneurs who founded and ran, or were employed by, such successful enterprises as the [[Kalo Shops]], [[Rookwood Pottery]], and [[Tiffany Studios]]. In Canada, the term ''Arts and Crafts'' predominates, but ''Craftsman'' is also recognized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/acam/hd_acam.htm |title=Metropolitan Museum of Art: Monica Obniski, "The Arts and Crafts Movement in America" |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date=1972-02-20 |accessdate=2010-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Europeans tried to recreate the virtuous crafts being replaced by industrialisation, Americans tried to establish a new type of virtue to replace heroic craft production: well-decorated middle-class homes. They claimed that the simple but refined aesthetics of Arts and Crafts decorative arts would ennoble the new experience of industrial consumerism, making individuals more rational and society more harmonious. The American Arts and Crafts movement was the aesthetic counterpart of its contemporary political philosophy, [[progressivism]]. Characteristically, when the Arts and Crafts Society began in October 1897 in Chicago, it was at [[Hull House]], one of the first American [[settlement house]]s for social reform.&lt;ref name="Obniski"&gt;Obniski.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arts and Crafts ideals disseminated in America through journal and newspaper writing were supplemented by societies that sponsored lectures.&lt;ref name="Obniski"/&gt; The first was organized in Boston in the late 1890s, when a group of influential architects, designers, and educators determined to bring to America the design reforms begun in Britain by William Morris; they met to organize an exhibition of contemporary craft objects. The first meeting was held on January 4, 1897, at the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]] (MFA) in Boston to organize an exhibition of contemporary crafts. When craftsmen, consumers, and manufacturers realised the aesthetic and technical potential of the applied arts, the process of design reform in Boston started. Present at this meeting were General Charles Loring, Chairman of the Trustees of the MFA; [[William Sturgis Bigelow]] and [[Denman Ross]], collectors, writers and MFA trustees; Ross Turner, painter; [[Sylvester Baxter]], art critic for the ''Boston Transcript''; Howard Baker, [[Alexander Wadsworth Longfellow, Jr.|A.W. Longfellow Jr.]]; and Ralph Clipson Sturgis, architect.

The first American Arts and Crafts Exhibition began on April 5, 1897, at [[Copley Hall, Boston]]{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} featuring more than 1000 objects made by 160 craftsmen, half of whom were women. Some of the advocates of the exhibit were Langford Warren, founder of Harvard's School of Architecture; Mrs. Richard Morris Hunt; Arthur Astor Carey and Edwin Mead, social reformers; and [[Will H. Bradley]], graphic designer. The success of this exhibition resulted in the incorporation of The Society of Arts and Crafts (SAC), on June 28, 1897, with a mandate to "develop and encourage higher standards in the handicrafts." The 21 founders claimed to be interested in more than sales, and emphasized encouragement of artists to produce work with the best quality of workmanship and design. This mandate was soon expanded into a credo, possibly written by the SAC's first president, [[Charles Eliot Norton]], which read:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This Society was incorporated for the purpose of promoting artistic work in all branches of handicraft. It hopes to bring Designers and Workmen into mutually helpful relations, and to encourage workmen to execute designs of their own. It endeavors to stimulate in workmen an appreciation of the dignity and value of good design; to counteract the popular impatience of Law and Form, and the desire for over-ornamentation and specious originality. It will insist upon the necessity of sobriety and restraint, or ordered arrangement, of due regard for the relation between the form of an object and its use, and of harmony and fitness in the decoration put upon it.&lt;ref&gt;Brandt, Beverly Kay. ''The Craftsman and the Critic: Defining Usefulness and Beauty in the Arts and Crafts-era Boston.'' University of Massachusetts Press, 2009. p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also influential were the [[Roycroft]] community initiated by [[Elbert Hubbard]] in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and [[East Aurora, New York]], [[Joseph Marbella]],  utopian communities like [[Byrdcliffe Colony]] in [[Woodstock, New York]], and [[Rose Valley, Pennsylvania]], developments such as [[Mountain Lakes, New Jersey]], featuring clusters of bungalow and chateau homes built by Herbert J. Hapgood, and the contemporary studio craft style. [[Studio pottery]]—exemplified by the [[Grueby Faience Company]], [[Newcomb Pottery]] in [[New Orleans]], [[Marblehead Pottery]], [[Teco pottery]], [[Overbeck Sisters|Overbeck]] and [[Rookwood pottery]] and [[Mary Chase Perry Stratton]]'s [[Pewabic Pottery]] in [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]], as well as the art [[tile]]s made by [[Ernest A. Batchelder]] in [[Pasadena, California]], and idiosyncratic furniture of [[Charles Rohlfs]] all demonstrate the influence of Arts and Crafts.

====Architecture and Art====
The "[[Prairie School]]" of [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], [[George Washington Maher]] and other architects in Chicago, the [[Country Day School movement]], the [[bungalow]] and [[ultimate bungalow]] style of houses popularized by [[Greene and Greene]], [[Julia Morgan]], and [[Bernard Maybeck]] are some examples of the American Arts and Crafts and [[American Craftsman]] style of architecture. Restored and landmark-protected examples are still present in America, especially in California in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] and [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], and the sections of other towns originally developed during the era and not experiencing post-war urban renewal. [[Mission Revival Style architecture|Mission Revival]], Prairie School, and the '[[California bungalow]]' styles of residential building remain popular in the United States today.

As theoreticians, educators, and prolific artists in mediums from printmaking to pottery and pastel, two of the most influential figures were [[Arthur Wesley Dow]] (1857-1922) on the East Coast and [[Pedro Joseph de Lemos]] (1882-1954) in California.  Dow, who taught at [[Columbia University]] and founded the Ipswich Summer School of Art, published in 1899 his landmark ''Composition'', which distilled into a distinctly American approach the essence of Japanese composition, combining into a decorative harmonious amalgam three elements: simplicity of line, "notan" (the balance of light and dark areas), and symmetry of color.&lt;ref name="green"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Green|first1=Nancy E. and Jessie Poesch| title=Arthur Wesley Dow and American arts &amp; crafts| date=1999|publisher=Harry N.

His student de Lemos, who became head of the [[San Francisco Art Institute]], Director of the [[Stanford University]] Museum and Art Gallery, and Editor-in-Chief of the ''School Arts Magazine'', expanded and substantially revised Dow's ideas in over 150 monographs and articles for art schools in the United States and Britain.&lt;ref name="edwardsrw"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=Robert W.| title=Pedro de Lemos, Lasting Impressions: Works on Paper| date=2015|publisher=Davis Publications Inc.| location=Worcester, Mass.|isbn=9781615284054|pages=4–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among his many unorthodox teachings was his belief that manufactured products could express "the sublime beauty" and that great insight was to be found in the abstract "design forms" of pre-Columbian civilizations.

===Asia===
In Japan, [[Yanagi Sōetsu]], creator of the [[Mingei]] movement which promoted folk art from the 1920s onwards, was influenced by the writings of Morris and Ruskin.&lt;ref name=mingei&gt;Elisabeth Frolet, Nick Pearce, Soetsu Yanagi and Sori Yanagi, ''Mingei: The Living Tradition in Japanese Arts'', Japan Folk Crafts Museum/Glasgow Museums, Japan: Kodashani International, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Arts and Crafts movement in Europe, Mingei sought to preserve traditional crafts in the face of modernising industry.

The movement ... represents in some sense a revolt against the hard mechanical conventional life and its insensibility to beauty (quite another thing to ornament). It is a protest against that so-called industrial progress which produces shoddy wares, the cheapness of which is paid for by the lives of their producers and the degradation of their users. It is a protest against the turning of men into machines, against artificial distinctions in art, and against making the immediate market value, or possibility of profit, the chief test of artistic merit. It also advances the claim of all and each to the common possession of beauty in things common and familiar, and would awaken the sense of this beauty, deadened and depressed as it now too often is, either on the one hand by luxurious superfluities, or on the other by the absence of the commonest necessities and the gnawing anxiety for the means of livelihood; not to speak of the everyday uglinesses to which we have accustomed our eyes, confused by the flood of false taste, or darkened by the hurried life of modern towns in which huge aggregations of humanity exist, equally removed from both art and nature and their kindly and refining influences.

Many of the leaders of the Arts and Crafts movement were trained as architects (e.g. William Morris, A. H. Mackmurdo, C. R. Ashbee, W. R. Lethaby) and it was on building that the movement had its most visible and lasting influence.

[[Red House (London)|Red House]], in [[Bexleyheath]], London, designed for Morris in 1859 by architect [[Philip Webb]], exemplifies the early Arts and Crafts style, with its well-proportioned solid forms, wide porches, steep roof, pointed window arches, brick fireplaces and wooden fittings.  Webb rejected classical and other revivals of historical styles based on grand buildings, and based his design on British [[vernacular architecture]], expressing the texture of ordinary materials, such as stone and tiles, with an asymmetrical and picturesque building composition.&lt;ref name=V&amp;A&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/vastatic/microsites/british_galleries/bg_styles/Style09a/index.html |title=Victoria and Albert Museum |publisher=Vam.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The London suburb of [[Bedford Park, London|Bedford Park]], built mainly in the 1880s and 1890s, has about 360 Arts and Crafts style houses and was once famous for its [[Aestheticism|Aesthetic]] residents. Several [[Almshouse]]s were built in the Arts and Crafts style, for example, [[Whiteley Village]], Surrey, built between 1914 and 1917, with over 280 buildings, and the [[Dyers Almshouses]], Sussex, built between 1939 and 1971. [[Letchworth Garden City]], the first garden city, was inspired by Arts and Crafts ideals.&lt;ref name=maccarthy2014/&gt; The first houses were designed by [[Richard Barry Parker|Barry Parker]] and [[Raymond Unwin]] in the [[vernacular]] style popularized by the movement and the town became associated with high-mindedness and simple living. The sandal-making workshop set up by [[Edward Carpenter]] moved from Yorkshire to Letchworth Garden City and [[George Orwell]]'s jibe about "every fruit-juice drinker, nudist, sandal-wearer, sex-maniac, Quaker, 'Nature Cure' quack, pacifist, and feminist in England" going to a socialist conference in Letchworth has become famous.&lt;ref&gt;George Orwell, ''The Road to Wigan Pier''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Garden design==
{{expand section|date=August 2015}}
[[Gertrude Jekyll]] applied Arts and Crafts principles to garden design. She worked with the English architect, Sir [[Edwin Lutyens]], for whose projects she created numerous landscapes, and who designed her home ''[[Munstead Wood]]'', near Godalming in Surrey.&lt;ref&gt;Tankard, Judith B. and Martin A. Wood. Gertrude Jekyll at Munstead Wood. Bramley Books, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Jekyll created the gardens for ''Bishopsbarns'',&lt;ref name="HEBishopsbarns"&gt;{{NHLE|num=1256793 |desc=Bishopsbarns|accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the home of York architect [[Walter Brierley]], an exponent of the Arts and Crafts movement and known as the "Lutyens of the North".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/goddards-house-and-garden/documents/download-the-goddards-the-art-of-design-leaflet.pdf |title=The Art of Design |website=www.nationaltrust.org.uk| accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The garden for Brierley's final project, ''[[Goddards House and Garden|Goddards]]'' in York, was the work of George Dillistone, a gardener who worked with Lutyens and Jekyll at ''[[Castle Drogo]]''.&lt;ref name="HE1000452"&gt;{{NHLE|num=1000452 |desc=Castle Drogo park and garden|accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At ''Goddards'' the garden incorporated a number of features that reflected the arts and crafts style of the house, such as the use of hedges and [[herbaceous border]]s to divide the garden into a series of outdoor rooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/goddards-house-and-garden/features/the-gardens-at-goddards- |title=The Gardens at Goddards|website=www.nationaltrust.org.uk| accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another notable Arts and Crafts garden is ''[[Hidcote Manor Garden]]'' designed by [[Lawrence Johnston]] which is also laid out in a series of outdoor rooms and where, like ''Goddards'', the landscaping becomes less formal further away from the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/hidcote/features/the-garden-at-hidcote |title=The Garden at Hidcote|website=www.nationaltrust.org.uk| accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of Arts and Crafts gardens include ''[[Hestercombe House|Hestercombe Gardens]]'', ''[[Lytes Cary|Lytes Cary Manor]]'' and the gardens of some of the architectural examples of arts and crafts buildings (listed above).

==Art education==
Morris's ideas were adopted by the [[New Education Movement]] in the late 1880s, which incorporated handicraft teaching in schools at Abbotsholme (1889) and [[Bedales]] (1892), and his influence has been noted in the social experiments of [[Dartington Hall]] during the mid-20th century.{{sfn|MacCarthy 1994|p=603}}

Arts and Crafts practitioners in Britain were critical of the government system of art education based on design in the abstract with little teaching of practical craft. This lack of craft training also caused concern in industrial and official circles, and in 1884 a Royal Commission (accepting the advice of William Morris) recommended that art education should pay more attention to the suitability of design to the material in which it was to be executed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.morrissociety.org/publications/JWMS/AU94.11.1.HarveyPress.pdf Charles Harvey and Jon Press, "William Morris and the Royal Commission on Technical Instruction", ''Journal of the William Morris Society''  11.1, August 1994, pp. 31-34] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150105132211/http://www.morrissociety.org/publications/JWMS/AU94.11.1.HarveyPress.pdf |date=2015-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first school to make this change was the [[Birmingham Art School|Birmingham School of Arts and Crafts]], which "led the way in introducing executed design to the teaching of art and design nationally (working in the material for which the design was intended rather than designing on paper). In his external examiner's report of 1889, Walter Crane praised Birmingham School of Art in that it 'considered design in relationship to materials and usage.'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://fineart.ac.uk/institutions.php?idinst=9 "Birmingham Institute of Art and Design" fineart.ac.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; Under the direction of Edward Taylor, its headmaster from 1877 to 1903, and with the help of [[Henry Payne (artist)|Henry Payne]] and [[Joseph Southall]], the Birmingham School became a leading Arts-and-Crafts centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Everitt|first=Sian|title=Keeper of Archives|url=http://fineart.ac.uk/institutions.php?idinst=9|work=Birmingham Institute of Art and Design|accessdate=17 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other local authority schools also began to introduce more practical teaching of crafts, and by the 1890s Arts and Crafts ideals were being disseminated by members of the Art Workers Guild into art schools throughout the country. Members of the Guild held influential positions: Walter Crane was director of the [[Manchester School of Art]] and subsequently the [[Royal College of Art]]; F.M. Simpson, [[Robert Anning Bell]] and C.J.Allen were respectively professor of architecture, instructor in painting and design, and instructor in sculpture at [[Liverpool School of Art]]; Robert Catterson-Smith, the headmaster of the Birmingham Art School from 1902-1920, was also an AWG member; [[W. R. Lethaby]] and [[George Frampton]] were inspectors and advisors to the [[London County Council]]'s (LCC) education board and in 1896, largely as a result of their work, the LCC set up the [[Central School of Arts and Crafts]] and made them joint principals.&lt;ref name=macdonald/&gt; Until the formation of the Bauhaus in Germany, the Central School was regarded as the most progressive art school in Europe.{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=179}} Shortly after its foundation, the [[Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts]] was set up on Arts and Crafts lines by the local borough council.

As head of the Royal College of Art in 1898, Crane tried to reform it along more practical lines, but resigned after a year, defeated by the bureaucracy of the [[Board of Education]], who then appointed Augustus Spencer to implement his plan. Spencer brought in Lethaby to head its school of design and several members of the Art Workers' Guild as teachers.&lt;ref name=macdonald&gt;Stuart Macdonald, ''The History and Philosophy of Art Education'', London: University of London Press, 1970.  {{ISBN|0 340 09420 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten years after reform, a committee of inquiry reviewed the RCA and found that it was still not adequately training students for industry.&lt;ref&gt;''Report of the Departmental Committee on the Royal College of Art'', HMSO, 1911&lt;/ref&gt; In the debate that followed the publication of the committee's report, C.R.Ashbee published a highly critical essay, ''Should We Stop Teaching Art'', in which he called for the system of art education to be completely dismantled and for the crafts to be learned in state-subsidised workshops instead.&lt;ref&gt;C.R.Ashbee, ''Should We Stop Teaching Art?'', 1911&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lewis Foreman Day]], an important figure in the Arts and Crafts movement, took a different view in his dissenting report to the committee of inquiry, arguing for greater emphasis on principles of design against the growing orthodoxy of teaching design by direct working in materials. Nevertheless, the Arts and Crafts ethos thoroughly pervaded British art schools and persisted, in the view of the historian of art education, Stuart MacDonald, until after the Second World War.&lt;ref name=macdonald/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4723">The '''Barcelona Charter''', in full the '''European Charter for the Conservation and Restoration of Traditional Ships in Operation''' is an informal but widely accepted [[Technical standard|standard]] for maintenance and [[Conservation-restoration|restoration]] projects on [[historic watercraft]] that are still in operation as active [[sailing ship|sailing vessels]].

== Background ==
More than a thousand historic [[watercraft]] of all sizes are still in operation in [[Europe]]. Only a small number of them are registered monuments or real [[museum ships]], while nearly all of them have a certain historic or [[cultural value]] in the context of [[Maritime history|maritime]] or [[regional history]]. The wide majority of historic watercraft are owned and operated by private owners, associations, foundations etc. 
[[European Maritime Heritage]], the European [[umbrella organization]] for [[traditional vessel]]s in operation, decided to develop a code of best practice for the conservation and restoration of such vessels to safeguard the historic value of these vessels and to define minimum methodological standards for any work to be carried out on these vessels.
A working group mainly consisting of [[Arne Gotved]], [[John Robinson (Barcelona Charter)|John Robinson]] and the professional maritime historian [[Ingo Heidbrink]] drafted the text of the Charter which was finally adopted by European Maritime Heritage in 2003.

== Contents ==
The Barcelona Charter describes in a few paragraphs how conservation and restoration of traditional [[ship]]s in operation should be done. The basic principles are developed on the basis of the [[Venice Charter|Charter of Venice]] and include for example the requirement for proper documentation of all work carried out as well as proper historical background research as a basis for all work to be done. The aim of all paragraphs is to safeguard the particular historic value of a vessel for future generations although the vessel is still in operation and therefore certain safety-regulations of today have to be matched.
The original text of the Charter was written in [https://web.archive.org/web/20080513173350/http://www.european-maritime-heritage.org/EMHsite/Cultural%20Council/barcelona%20charter.htm English], but unofficial translations are available for a number of European languages ([https://web.archive.org/web/20080513173350/http://www.european-maritime-heritage.org/EMHsite/Cultural%20Council/barcelona%20charter.htm Catalan, Dutch, French, German and Portuguese]). 
A detailed commentary on all paragraphs of the Charter was developed by the maritime historian [[Ingo Heidbrink]].&lt;ref&gt;Ingo Heidbrink (ed.), The Barcelona Charter, European Charter for the Conservation and Restoration of Traditional Ships in Operation. Bremen (Hauschild Vlg) 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relevance ==
Although the Barcelona Charter is not a binding legal instrument it is widely accepted as a code of best practice and is recognized by several European marine safety authorities as well as national owner organizations of historic watercraft.
Despite the fact that the Barcelona Charter was written mainly as a European Charter the principles of the Charter can be applied globally and were for example published by the National Research Institute for Restoration and Conservation of Japan.&lt;ref&gt;National Research Institute for Cultural Properties, Tokyo, Conservation of Vessels, Tokyo (Office Hans)2004&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bengal studies''' ({{lang-bn|বঙ্গবিদ্যা}}; ''Bangabidya'') is an interdisciplinary academic field devoted to the study of the [[Bengali people]], [[Bengali culture|culture]], [[Bengali language|language]], [[Bengali literature|literature]], and [[History of Bengal|history]]. The focus of this field, which qualifies as [[area studies]] and [[cultural studies]], is on Indic Bengalis who follow an indigenous system of faith and refer to themselves as Bengalis. It is a subset of [[South Asian studies]] and [[Indology]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bangabidya.net/isbs/idea/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bengalistudies.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of the history and culture of the Bengali people have been undertaken by the Bengalis themselves and others travelling to Bengal since earliest times.{{vague|When?|date=November 2018}} The work of [[Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay]] is often considered{{by who?|date=November 2018}} to be a forerunner of Bengali studies in the modern period, while [[Ishwar Chandra Gupta]] pioneered the study of Bengali poets through a critically annotated collection of the diverse oral poetic traditions of Bengal. Twentieth century Bengali historians like [[Ramesh Chandra Majumdar]] and [[Niharranjan Ray]] were champions of the study of the history and culture of the Bengali people.

'''CLARIN''' is a European research network working in the field of archiving and processing of language-related resources in the [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]]. 

CLARIN is an [[acronym]] for ''Common Language Resources and Technology Infrastructure''. CLARIN is a community of scholars of various disciplines and a network of institutions. The scholars use CLARIN as a forum for joined developments and exchange of resources. They also exchange information on [[Technical standard|standards]] and [[Standard Operating Procedure|procedure]]s for long time [[archiving]] of research data. The institutions of CLARIN offer services in the same field. 

On the European level, CLARIN is an independent body operating under [[European law]] as a [[European Research Infrastructure Consortium|European Research Infrastructure Community]] (ERIC). CLARIN ERIC represents the CLARIN community in the public and coordinates individual efforts in the field.

CLARIN is listed in the [[Registry of Research Data Repositories]] re3data.org.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CLARIN entry in re3data.org|url=http://service.re3data.org/repository/r3d100010209|website=www.re3data.org|accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

([https://www.clarin.eu/sites/default/files/EH%2BSK-CLARIN.bib_.txt BiBTeX])

== Objective ==
CLARIN's objective is to provide a research infrastructure for researchers of the humanities and social sciences working with language related material. The network should allow the persistent storage and access to the data in an archive, to disseminate the material and to reuse it in other research contexts. By exchanging material, effects of synergy are achieved by not duplicating work and participating at each other's development. Additionally new research questions can follow and the material can be used for quality assurance in the research process. 
By offering depositing services, tutorials and support for archiving, special search engines for language resources and web based analysis systems the infrastructure becomes usable for the research community.

'''CLARIN Vision'''

All digital language resources and tools from all over Europe and beyond are accessible through a single sign-on online environment for the support of researchers in the humanities and social sciences.

'''CLARIN Mission'''

Create and maintain an infrastructure to support the sharing, use and sustainability of language data and tools for research in the humanities and social sciences.

'''CLARIN Value proposition'''

CLARIN makes digital language resources available to scholars, researchers, students, and citizen-scientists from all disciplines, especially in the humanities and social sciences, through single sign-on access. CLARIN offers long-term solutions and technology services for deploying, connecting, analysing and sustaining digital language data and tools. CLARIN supports scholars who want to engage in cutting edge data-driven research, contributing to a truly multilingual European Research Area.

For details please see: [https://www.clarin.eu/value-proposition CLARIN Value proposition, 2017].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.clarin.eu/value-proposition|title=Value Proposition {{!}} CLARIN ERIC|website=www.clarin.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Services offered ==
CLARIN offers a wide range of services to the research community, for example:
* Virtual Language Observatory,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.clarin.eu/vlo Virtual Language Observatory]&lt;/ref&gt; a special search engine for language resources available to the academic community via CLARIN
* Depositing services,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.clarin.eu/content/depositing-services Depositing Services]&lt;/ref&gt; where scholars can deposit their own language related materials resulting from academic research processes 
* Web based analysis tools&lt;ref&gt;[http://weblicht.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/weblichtwiki/index.php/Main_Page Web based analysis tools]&lt;/ref&gt; (webservices), offering software from computational linguistics for the academic community.

In addition to such technical services, tutorials are prepared, standards and processes developed and implemented. Researchers receive support in the archiving process, for example by reference material.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.dwds.de/clarin/userguide/text/ CLARIN User handbook by CLARIN-D]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Membership ==
The majority of operations, services and centres of the CLARIN infrastructure is provided and funded by CLARIN ERICmembers (and observers). Members and observers can be countries or intergovernmental organizations. They set up a national consortium, typically consisting of universities, research institutions, libraries and public archives, of which at least one has the status of CLARIN centre (see [https://www.clarin.eu/content/overview-clarin-centres overview of CLARIN centres]). The contribution expected from members and observers is to create and provide access to digital language data collections, and digital tools and expertise for researchers to work with them.

Below is the list of current CLARIN ERIC members, observers and third parties:

'''Members:'''
* [[Austria]]
* [[Bulgaria]]
*[[Croatia]]
* [[Czech Republic]]
* [[Denmark]]
* [[Estonia]]
* [[Finland]]
* [[Germany]]
* [[Greece]]
* [[Hungary]] 
* [[Italy]]
* [[Latvia]]
* [[Lithuania]]
* [[Netherlands]]
* [[Norway]] 
* [[Poland]]
* [[Portugal]]
* [[Slovenia]]
* [[Sweden]]

The [[Dutch Language Union]] (DLU) is an [[intergovernmental organization]] and member of CLARIN as well.

'''Observers:'''
* [[France]] 
* [[United Kingdom]]

'''Third party:'''
* Carnegie Mellon University (US)

== Type of organization ==
The CLARIN consortium is organized as a [[European Research Infrastructure Consortium]] (ERIC) under [[European law]], which is a special type of organization created for [[research infrastructures]].
It is hence part of the activities in the [[European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures]] ([http://www.esfri.eu/ ESFRI]) context.

== Government ==
On the European level CLARIN is governed by the following structures:

* CLARIN General Assembly: Assembly of all members of CLARIN ERIC, represented by a delegate of the appropriate ministries. There is one delegate per country who may bring a subject matter expert.
* CLARIN Board of Directors: Assembly of the directors for coordinating the committees, serving as contact points and for the administration of the consortium. It is the highest body outside of the General Assembly. The directors are nominated by the General Assembly. The chair persons of the National Coordinators' Forum and of the Standing Committee of CLARIN Technical centers are ex officio members of the Board of Directors.
* CLARIN National Coordinators' Forum: committee of national subject matter experts with one delegate per member. 
* CLARIN Standing Committee of Technical Centers (also: ''Centre Committee'' or ''SCCTC''): Delegates of the different CLARIN centres.
* CLARIN Scientific Advisory Board: consulting body of international experts who are not part of CLARIN but nominated by the General Assembly. 
* Other consulting committees as needed. At the moment there is the CLARIN Legal Issues Committee, (CLIC) and the CLARIN Standards Committee.

The seat of CLARIN ERIC is at the [[University of Utrecht]] with the office of the Executive Director. The staff of the office and all other institutions works distributed, the participants can be from all EU countries, and the staff may work from their home institutions.

Every member has a national CLARIN partner organization, often organized as national project networks. Every member supports at least one CLARIN centre, providing a repository for the [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]] scholar working with language oriented research data. Often these centres offer additional technical services and some [[webservice]]s beyond the national community.

Scholars of the CLARIN community meet every year for the CLARIN Annual Meeting. For this every member may send delegates, experts from CLARIN centres. These meetings are also used for the committees to report on their progress and inform about new developments.

[[Image:Capandshare02outline.jpg|thumb|300px|A diagram which sets out the basic process of the policy]]

'''Cap and Share''' was originally developed by [[Foundation for the Economics of Sustainability|Feasta]] (the Foundation for the Economics of Sustainability) and is a regulatory and economic framework for controlling the use of fossil fuels in relation to climate stabilisation. Accepting that climate change is a global problem and that there is a need to cap and reduce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions globally, the philosophy of Cap and Share maintains that the earth’s atmosphere is a fundamental common resource. Consequently, it is argued, each individual should get an equal share of the benefits from the limited amount of fossil fuels that will have to be burned and their emissions released into the atmosphere in the period until the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases has been stabilised at a safe level.

== Design ==

This market based mechanism was devised by [[Foundation for the Economics of Sustainability|Feasta]] in 2005 and 2006, and they have set out the case for the introduction of Cap and Share globally in policy documents.&lt;ref name=Feasta1&gt;The Foundation for the Economics of Sustainability, 2008. [http://www.feasta.org/documents/energy/Cap-and-Share-May08.pdf Cap and Share: A Fair Way to Cut Greenhouse Gas Emissions]. Feasta, Dublin.&lt;/ref&gt; It calls for global emissions to be capped at their current level and then brought down year by year at a rate fast enough to prevent catastrophic climate change. Each year, the emissions tonnage involved would be shared equally amongst the Earth's adult population, each of whom would receive a certificate representing their individual entitlement. The recipients would then sell their certificates through the banking system to oil, coal and gas producers who would need to acquire enough of them to cover the carbon dioxide emissions that would be emitted from all of the fossil fuel they sold. Everyone would receive at least partial compensation for the higher cost of fossil fuels that limiting their availability would necessarily involve.

Comhar, the National Sustainable Development Council of Ireland, commissioned a report on the mechanism which incorporates policy&lt;ref name=AEAReport&gt;AEA Energy and Environment, 2008. [http://www.feasta.org/documents/energy/AEA_cap_and_share.pdf Cap and Share: Phase 1; Policy Options for Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions.] Report to Comhar Sustainable Development Council. AEA, Didcot.&lt;/ref&gt; and economic analysis of using Cap and Share to control emissions in Ireland, particularly from the transport sector. The final report&lt;ref name=AEAReport2&gt;AEA Energy and Environment and Cambridge Econometrics, 2008. [http://www.feasta.org/documents/energy/Comhar_Cap_and_Share_Report.pdf A Study in Personal Carbon Allocation: Cap and Share]. Comhar Sustainable Development Council, Dublin.&lt;/ref&gt; was published in December 2008.

Cap and Share is partly an extension and popularisation of the [[Contraction and Convergence]] proposal developed by the Global Commons Institute, which also calls for an equal per capita distribution of emissions. Cap and Share differs in that it insists that emissions allocations should be distributed equally to individuals as their right, whereas Contraction and Convergence (C&amp;C) allows governments to decide if this is the way they wish to share out what is, essentially, their national allocation. C&amp;C also allows for (but does not insist on) a convergence period, during which the richer countries would receive higher per capita emissions allowances than poorer countries. Cap and Share says people in rich countries should get the same emissions entitlement as those in poor countries from the start, but suggests that in the early years of the system, a portion of everyone's emissions entitlement should be held back and distributed to governments of countries which were facing exceptional difficulties in adapting to climate change or to low levels of fossil energy use. The governments involved would sell their certificates to raise money for remedial works. For example, the government of Bangladesh might sell its allocation to pay for better defences against rising sea levels.

== Principles ==

# That a ceiling or cap on carbon dioxide and other green house gas (ghg) emissions from fossil fuels should be calculated that prevents an average global temperature rise of over 2 degrees Celsius.
# That the right to emit such ghgs is a human right, and should be shared on an equal-per-capita basis, with permits going to each individual rather than to their governments.
# That the permits would be saleable through the post office and banking system to the importers and producers of fossil fuels who would need to acquire enough permits to cover the emissions from the fuels they introduce.
# That any national or European Union scheme should be designed as a possible prototype for a global system that will also help set the conditions for the alleviation of poverty and the maintenance of biodiversity.

== Economic assessment ==

If the future were known with certainty, then the economic implications of Cap and Share would equal the economic implications of a carbon tax with lump sum recycling—that is, the carbon tax revenue would be used to send every household a cheque in the post. Some argue that lump sum recycling is an inferior way to recycle the revenue of environmental taxes,&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence H. Goulder (1995), Effects of Carbon Taxes in an Economy with Prior Tax Distortions: An Intertemporal General Equilibrium Analysis, Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, 29, 271-297.&lt;/ref&gt; and that this has been repeatedly confirmed for Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Adele Bergin et al. (2004), [http://www.epa.ie/downloads/pubs/research/econ/epa_reducing_greenhouse_gas.pdf   The macroeconomic effects of using fiscal instruments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions], Environmental Protection Agency, Johnstown Castle.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Conefrey et al. (2008), [http://ideas.repec.org/p/esr/wpaper/wp251.html The impact of a carbon tax on economic growth and carbon dioxide emissions in Ireland], Working Paper 251, [[Economic and Social Research Institute]], Dublin.&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale is that with the carbon tax revenue coming into government coffers, it could be directly spent by the government rather than distributed to the population via cheques, and that other kinds of taxation, such as labour taxation, could be decreased correspondingly. It is argued that this would have a positive effect on GDP since there would be a greater incentive for firms to increase employment, and that it would also positively affect social equity, since labour taxes are regressive by nature.

The NGO that developed Cap and Share, Feasta, argues that while it is definitely a good idea to shift the tax burden away from labour and towards capital, a carbon tax is not the optimal instrument for this purpose. Carbon taxes do not establish a predictable level of emissions cuts, unlike a cap, and can be vulnerable to short-term political pressures such as an increase in the price of oil, since a country's tax policy is usually adjusted each year in the annual Budget.   Feasta suggests that if a carbon tax were to be introduced, it would work best in tandem with Cap and Share. The two policies could be used to help countries fine-tune their responses to climate change and [[Peak Oil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feasta.org/documents/papers/IIEA_Occasional_Paper_4.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217174252/http://www.feasta.org/documents/papers/IIEA_Occasional_Paper_4.pdf |archivedate=2008-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feasta also advocates the introduction of a [[land value tax|land-value-based tax]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.feasta.org/documents/landhousing/coritax.html&lt;/ref&gt; which they believe could be used as a substitute for taxation on labour and could therefore have a similar effect on the market to a carbon tax.

As the future is not known with certainty, some argue that cap and share has all the drawbacks of quantity-based regulation for a stock pollutant.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Weitzman]] (1974), Prices vs Quantities, [[Review of Economic Studies]], 41 (4), 477-491.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of greenhouse gas emissions, the argument goes, price-based regulation (incl. a carbon tax with lump-sum recycling) is more robust to uncertainty and leads to lower welfare losses.&lt;ref&gt;William A. Pizer (1999), The optimal choice of climate change policy in the presence of uncertainty, Resource and Energy Economics, 21, 255-287.&lt;/ref&gt; Again, however, Cap and Share advocates argue that the problem of assuring that specific emissions targets are reached is not properly addressed by using a purely price-based mechanism for emissions reduction. From their perspective, a definite, substantial decrease in greenhouse gas emissions, carried out in an equitable way so that the poor are not adversely affected, is well worth a possible decrease in "welfare" as measured by GDP (a highly problematic instrument for measuring wellbeing&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUaJMNtW6GA&lt;/ref&gt;).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24261">'''Chemometrics''' is the science of extracting information from chemical systems by data-driven means.  Chemometrics is inherently interdisciplinary, using methods frequently employed in core data-analytic disciplines such as [[multivariate statistics]], [[applied mathematics]], and [[computer science]], in order to address problems in [[chemistry]], [[biochemistry]], [[medicine]], [[biology]] and [[chemical engineering]].  In this way, it mirrors other interdisciplinary fields, such as [[psychometrics]] and [[econometrics]].

==Introduction==
Chemometrics is applied to solve both descriptive and predictive problems in experimental natural sciences, especially in chemistry.   In descriptive applications, properties of chemical systems are modeled with the intent of learning the underlying relationships and structure of the system (i.e., model understanding and identification).  In predictive applications, properties of chemical systems are modeled with the intent of predicting new properties or behavior of interest.  In both cases, the datasets can be small but are often very large and highly complex, involving hundreds to thousands of variables, and hundreds to thousands of cases or observations.

Chemometric techniques are particularly heavily used in [[analytical chemistry]] and [[metabolomics]], and the development of improved chemometric methods of analysis also continues to advance the state of the art in analytical instrumentation and methodology.  It is an application-driven discipline, and thus while the standard chemometric methodologies are very widely used industrially, academic groups are dedicated to the continued development of chemometric theory, method and application development.

==Origins==
Although one could argue that even the earliest analytical experiments in chemistry involved a form of chemometrics, the field is generally recognized to have emerged in the 1970s as computers became increasingly exploited for scientific investigation.  The term ‘chemometrics’ was coined by Svante Wold in a grant application 1971,&lt;ref name="Wold1974"&gt;As recounted in {{cite journal |first=S. |last=Wold |title=Chemometrics; what do we mean with it, and what do we want from it? |journal=Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems |volume=30 |issue=1 |year=1995 |pages=109–115 |doi=10.1016/0169-7439(95)00042-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the International Chemometrics Society was formed shortly thereafter by Svante Wold and Bruce Kowalski, two pioneers in the field.  Wold was a professor of organic chemistry at [[Umeå University]], Sweden, and Kowalski was a professor of analytical chemistry at University of Washington, Seattle.

Many early applications involved multivariate classification, numerous quantitative predictive applications followed, and by the late 1970s and early 1980s a wide variety of data- and computer-driven chemical analyses were occurring.

Multivariate analysis was a critical facet even in the earliest applications of chemometrics.  The data resulting from infrared and UV/visible spectroscopy are often easily numbering in the thousands of measurements per sample.  Mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance, atomic emission/absorption and chromatography experiments are also all by nature highly multivariate.  The structure of these data was found to be conducive to using techniques such as [[principal components analysis]] (PCA), and [[partial least squares regression|partial least-squares]] (PLS).  This is primarily because, while the datasets may be highly multivariate there is strong and often linear low-rank structure present.  PCA and PLS have been shown over time very effective at empirically modeling the more chemically interesting low-rank structure, exploiting the interrelationships or ‘latent variables’ in the data, and providing alternative compact coordinate systems for further numerical analysis such as [[regression analysis|regression]], [[cluster analysis|clustering]], and [[pattern recognition]].  Partial least squares in particular was heavily used in chemometric applications for many years before it began to find regular use in other fields.

Through the 1980s three dedicated journals appeared in the field: ''[[Journal of Chemometrics]]'', ''[[Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems]]'', and ''[[Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling]]''. These journals continue to cover both fundamental and methodological research in chemometrics.  At present, most routine applications of existing chemometric methods are commonly published in application-oriented journals (e.g., ''Applied Spectroscopy, ''[[Analytical Chemistry (journal)|Analytical Chemistry]]'', ''Anal. Chim. Acta.'', ''Talanta''). Several important books/monographs on chemometrics were also first published in the 1980s, including the first edition of Malinowski’s ''Factor Analysis in Chemistry'',&lt;ref name="Malinowski1980"&gt;{{cite book |first=E. R. |last=Malinowski |first2=D. G. |last2=Howery |title=Factor Analysis in Chemistry |publisher=Wiley |location=New York |year=1980 |isbn=0471058815 }} (other editions followed in 1989, 1991 and 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Sharaf, Illman and Kowalski’s ''Chemometrics'',&lt;ref name="Sharaf1984"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=M.

Some large chemometric application areas have gone on to represent new domains, such as molecular modeling and [[Quantitative structure–activity relationship|QSAR]], [[cheminformatics]], the ‘-omics’ fields of [[genomics]], [[proteomics]], [[metabonomics]] and [[metabolomics]], process modeling and [[process analytical technology]].

An account of the early history of chemometrics was published as a series of interviews by Geladi and Esbensen.&lt;ref name="Geladi2005"&gt;{{cite journal |first=P. |last=Geladi |first2=K. |last2=Esbensen |title=The Start and Early History of Chemometrics: Selected Interviews. Part 1 |journal=[[Journal of Chemometrics|J. Chemometrics]] |volume=4 |year=2005 |issue=5 |pages=337–354 |doi=10.1002/cem.1180040503 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Esbensen2005"&gt;{{cite journal |first=K. |last=Esbensen |first2=P. |last2=Geladi |title=The Start and Early History of Chemometrics: Selected Interviews. Part 2 |journal=[[Journal of Chemometrics|J. Chemometrics]] |volume=4 |issue=6 |year=2005 |pages=389–412 |doi=10.1002/cem.1180040604 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==

===Multivariate calibration===
Many chemical problems and applications of chemometrics involve [[calibration]].  The objective is to develop models which can be used to predict properties of interest based on measured properties of the chemical system, such as pressure, flow, temperature, [[infrared spectroscopy|infrared]], [[Raman spectroscopy|Raman]], [[NMR|NMR spectra]] and [[mass spectrometry|mass spectra]].  Examples include the development of multivariate models relating 1) multi-wavelength spectral response to analyte concentration, 2) molecular descriptors to biological activity, 3) multivariate process conditions/states to final product attributes.  The process requires a calibration or training data set, which includes reference values for the properties of interest for prediction, and the measured attributes believed to correspond to these properties.  For case 1), for example, one can assemble data from a number of samples, including concentrations for an analyte of interest for each sample (the reference) and the corresponding infrared spectrum of that sample.  Multivariate calibration techniques such as partial-least squares regression, or principal component regression (and near countless other methods) are then used to construct a mathematical model that relates the multivariate response (spectrum) to the concentration of the analyte of interest, and such a model can be used to efficiently predict the concentrations of new samples.

Techniques in multivariate calibration are often broadly categorized as classical or inverse methods.&lt;ref name="Martens1989" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Franke2002"&gt;{{cite book |first=J. |last=Franke |chapter=Inverse Least Squares and Classical Least Squares Methods for Quantitative Vibrational Spectroscopy |title=Handbook of Vibrational Spectroscopy |publisher=Wiley |year=2002 |location=New York |pages= |isbn=0471988472 |doi=10.1002/0470027320.s4603 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The principal difference between these approaches is that in classical calibration the models are solved such that they are optimal in describing the measured analytical responses (e.g., spectra) and can therefore be considered optimal descriptors, whereas in inverse methods the models are solved to be optimal in predicting the properties of interest (e.g., concentrations, optimal predictors).&lt;ref name="Brown2004"&gt;{{cite journal |first=C. D. |last=Brown |title=Discordance between Net Analyte Signal Theory and Practical Multivariate Calibration |journal=Analytical Chemistry |volume=76 |year=2004 |issue=15 |pages=4364–4373 |doi=10.1021/ac049953w |pmid=15283574}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Inverse methods usually require less physical knowledge of the chemical system, and at least in theory provide superior predictions in the mean-squared error sense,&lt;ref name="krutchkoff1969"&gt;{{cite journal |first=R. G. |last=Krutchkoff |title=Classical and inverse regression methods of calibration in extrapolation |journal=Technometrics |volume=11 |issue=3 |year=1969 |pages=11–15 |doi=10.1080/00401706.1969.10490714 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kowalski1984"&gt;{{cite book |first=W. G. |last=Hunter |chapter=Statistics and chemistry, and the linear calibration problem |title=Chemometrics: mathematics and statistics in chemistry |editor-first=B. R. |editor-last=Kowalski |publisher=Riedel |location=Boston |year=1984 |pages= |isbn=9027718466 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tellinghuisen2000"&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. |last=Tellinghuisen |title=Inverse vs. classical calibration for small data sets |journal=Fresenius' J. Anal. Chem. |volume=368 |year=2000 |issue=6 |pages=585–588 |doi=10.1007/s002160000556 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and hence inverse approaches tend to be more frequently applied in contemporary multivariate calibration.

The main advantages of the use of multivariate calibration techniques is that fast, cheap, or non-destructive analytical measurements (such as optical spectroscopy) can be used to estimate sample properties which would otherwise require time-consuming, expensive or destructive testing (such as [[Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry|LC-MS]]).  Equally important is that multivariate calibration allows for accurate quantitative analysis in the presence of heavy interference by other analytes.  The selectivity of the analytical method is provided as much by the mathematical calibration, as the analytical measurement modalities.  For example, near-infrared spectra, which are extremely broad and non-selective compared to other analytical techniques (such as infrared or Raman spectra), can often be used successfully in conjunction with carefully developed multivariate calibration methods to predict concentrations of analytes in very complex matrices.

===Classification, pattern recognition, clustering===
Supervised multivariate classification techniques are closely related to multivariate calibration techniques in that a calibration or training set is used to develop a mathematical model capable of classifying future samples.  The techniques employed in chemometrics are similar to those used in other fields – multivariate discriminant analysis, logistic regression, neural networks, regression/classification trees.  The use of rank reduction techniques in conjunction with these conventional classification methods is routine in chemometrics, for example discriminant analysis on [[principal component analysis|principal components]] or [[partial least squares regression|partial least squares]] scores.

Unsupervised classification (also termed [[cluster analysis]]) is also commonly used to discover patterns in complex data sets, and again many of the core techniques used in chemometrics are common to other fields such as machine learning and statistical learning.

===Multivariate curve resolution===
In chemometric parlance, multivariate curve resolution seeks to deconstruct data sets with limited or absent reference information and system knowledge.  Some of the earliest work on these techniques was done by Lawton and Sylvestre in the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lawton |first=W. H. |last2=Sylvestre |first2=E. A. |year=1971 |title=Self Modeling Curve Resolution |journal=Technometrics |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=617–633 |doi=10.1080/00401706.1971.10488823 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sylvestre |first=E. A. |last2=Lawton |first2=W. H. |last3=Maggio |first3=M. S. |year=1974 |title=Curve Resolution Using a Postulated Chemical Reaction |journal=Technometrics |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=353–368 |doi=10.1080/00401706.1974.10489204 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These approaches are also called self-modeling mixture analysis, [[blind signal separation|blind source/signal separation]], and spectral unmixing.  For example, from a data set comprising fluorescence spectra from a series of samples each containing multiple fluorophores, multivariate curve resolution methods can be used to extract the fluorescence spectra of the individual fluorophores, along with their relative concentrations in each of the samples, essentially unmixing the total fluorescence spectrum into the contributions from the individual components. The problem is usually ill-determined due to rotational ambiguity (many possible solutions can equivalently represent the measured data), so the application of additional constraints is common, such as non-negatively, unmodality, or known interrelationships between the individual components (e.g., kinetic or mass-balance constraints).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=de Juan |first=A. |last2=Tauler |first2=R. |year=2003 |title=Chemometrics Applied to Unravel Multicomponent Processes and Mixtures. Revisiting Latest Trends in Multivariate Resolution |journal=Analytica Chimica Acta |volume=500 |issue=1–2 |pages=195–210 |doi=10.1016/S0003-2670(03)00724-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=de Juan |first=A. |last2=Tauler |first2=R. |year=2006 |title=Multivariate Curve Resolution (MCR) from 2000: Progress in Concepts and Applications |journal=Critical Reviews in Analytical Chemistry |volume=36 |issue=3–4 |pages=163–176 |doi=10.1080/10408340600970005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other techniques===
'''[[design of experiments|Experimental design]]''' remains a core area of study in chemometrics and several monographs are specifically devoted to experimental design in chemical applications.&lt;ref name="Deming1987"&gt;{{cite book |first=S. N. |last=Deming |first2=S. L. |last2=Morgan |title=Experimental design: a chemometric approach |publisher=Elsevier |year=1987 |isbn=0444427341 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bruns2006"&gt;{{cite book |first=R. E. |last=Bruns |first2=I. S. |last2=Scarminio |first3=B. |last3=de Barros Neto |title=Statistical design – chemometrics |publisher=Elsevier |location=Amsterdam |year=2006 |isbn=044452181X }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sound principles of experimental design have been widely adopted within the chemometrics community, although many complex experiments are purely observational, and there can be little control over the properties and interrelationships of the samples and sample properties.

'''[[Signal processing]]''' is also a critical component of almost all chemometric applications, particularly the use of signal pretreatments to condition data prior to calibration or classification.  The techniques employed commonly in chemometrics are often closely related to those used in related fields.&lt;ref name="Wentzell2000"&gt;{{cite book |first=P. D. |last=Wentzell |first2=C. D. |last2=Brown |chapter=Signal Processing in Analytical Chemistry |title=Encyclopedia of Analytical Chemistry |editor-first=R. A. |editor-last=Meyers |publisher=Wiley |year=2000 |pages=9764–9800 |isbn= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Performance characterization, and figures of merit'''  Like most arenas in the physical sciences, chemometrics is quantitatively oriented, so considerable emphasis is placed on performance characterization, model selection, verification &amp; validation, and [[figure of merit|figures of merit]].  The performance of quantitative models is usually specified by [[root mean squared error]] in predicting the attribute of interest, and the performance of classifiers as a true-positive rate/false-positive rate pairs (or a full ROC curve).  A recent report by Olivieri et al. provides a comprehensive overview of figures of merit and uncertainty estimation in multivariate calibration, including multivariate definitions of selectivity, sensitivity, SNR and prediction interval estimation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=A.

'''Multivariate [[statistical process control]] (MSPC)''', modeling and optimization accounts for a substantial amount of historical chemometric development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=D.

Specifically in terms of MSPC, multiway modeling of batch and continuous processes is increasingly common in industry and remains an active area of research in chemometrics and chemical engineering.  Process analytical chemistry as it was originally termed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=T. |last=Hirschfeld |first2=J. B. |last2=Callis |first3=B. R. |last3=Kowalski |title=Chemical sensing in process analysis |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=226 |year=1984 |issue=4672 |pages=312–318 |doi=10.1126/science.226.4672.312 |bibcode=1984Sci...226..312H }}&lt;/ref&gt; or the newer term [[process analytical technology]] continues to draw heavily on chemometric methods and MSPC.

'''Multiway methods''' are heavily used in chemometric applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=A. K. |last=Smilde |first2=R. |last2=Bro |first3=P. |last3=Geladi |title=Multi-way analysis with applications in the chemical sciences |publisher=Wiley |year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=R. |last=Bro |first2=J.

For example, while the analysis of a table (matrix, or second-order array) of data is routine in several fields, multiway methods are applied to data sets that involve 3rd, 4th, or higher-orders.  Data of this type is very common in chemistry, for example a liquid-chromatography / mass spectrometry (LC-MS) system generates a large matrix of data (elution time versus m/z) for each sample analyzed.  The data across multiple samples thus comprises a data cube.  Batch process modeling involves data sets that have time vs. process variables vs. batch number.  The multiway mathematical methods applied to these sorts of problems include [[PARAFAC]], trilinear decomposition, and multiway PLS and PCA.

'''Choice editing''' refers to the active process of controlling or limiting the choices available to consumers so as to drive to an end goal, specifically by [[ban (law)|banning things]] or imposing [[pigovian tax|punitive taxation]].  The term has gained currency in discussions about [[sustainability]].

==Definition==
The [[Sustainable Development Commission]] defined "choice editing" as "...shifting the field of choice for mainstream consumers: cutting out unnecessarily damaging products and getting real sustainable choices on the shelves."&lt;ref name=SDC2006&gt;
{{cite report
  |publisher=[[Sustainable Development Commission]]

  |title=Looking Back, Looking Forward: Lessons in Choice Editing for Sustainability
  |date=May 2006
  |page=2
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process involves "...[removing] environmentally offensive products from commercial consideration or [making] such products expensive to use."&lt;ref name=Maniates&gt;

  |first=Michael|last=Maniates
  |title=Editing out Unsustainable Behavior
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Choice editing is a direct control of the impact from consumption and aims to only provide sustainable products in the market. Not only products can be edited out or replaced, but also product components, processes and business models.&lt;ref name=WBCSD&gt;
{{cite report
  |publisher=World Business Council for Sustainable Development
  |title=Sustainable consumption facts and trends: from a business perspective
  |year=2008
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Choice editing is nothing new. It has been around through standards, [[tax]]es, [[tariff]]s and [[subsidy|subsidies]] that made certain products more desirable for consumers than others. The Sustainable Development Roundtable in 2006 announced that in the past choice editing was a major driver of “green” innovations, which suggests its potential to increase [[sustainable consumption]].&lt;ref name=WorldWatch2010&gt;

  |year=2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Actors==
Governments and policy makers can edit citizens’ choices through laws, taxes, subsidies and voluntary bans. Businesses can edit choice by removing products from their range that might have negative impact on health or environment. Additionally, they can control their value chain and together with suppliers, processors and retailers develop solutions for more sustainable products and processes. A close collaboration along the value chain is important as the product’s environmental and social performance reflects the whole life cycle assessment. 

Retailers can actively "edit out" choices by not stocking products that they, or the state, consider to have an unacceptable environmental impact, thus being unsustainable options. Moreover, retailers can edit choice by requiring their suppliers to meet certain criteria.&lt;ref name=WBCSD/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
; Editing by policy makers - light bulb ban
The [[Australia]]n government phased out [[incandescent light bulb]]s by 2010 as a step towards preventing possible electricity shortages and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. They were replaced by [[compact fluorescent lamp]]s (CFLs) and [[LED lamp]]s. The expected consequences are reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 4 million tons per year from 2012. The [[European Union]] is following Australia’s example by removing all incandescent bulbs by 2012. Many other countries such as [[Canada]], the [[United States]] and [[Indonesia]] will do so as well.&lt;ref name=WorldWatch2010/&gt;

; Banning a product component – Henkel
[[Henkel]] took over the [[Brazil]]ian company Alba in 2006. Some of the company’s adhesive products contained toluene, which was misused by young people for [[Inhalant abuse|glue sniffing]]. After the takeover, Henkel developed a toluene-free formula and by 2007 introduced the toluene-free brand Cascola. 

; Editing the supply chain – Adidas
[[Adidas]] supports its suppliers in order to reduce their environmental impact by developing training materials, technical guidelines and workshop tailored to each supplier’s special need. 

This way Adidas actively edits the environmental impact of its supply chain.&lt;ref name=WBCSD/&gt;

; Editing processes – Tijin
Tijin is a Japanese company operating in the chemical industry. They edited their business processes by developing a recycling system for polyester. This reduces energy and resource use, CO2 emission and waste. Tijin established a global network with companies that collect polyester garments for recycling and support the expansion of products containing recycled polyester.&lt;ref name=WBCSD/&gt;

; Editing the corporate behavior - Hipp
As assessed by Belz and Peattie (2009), Prof. Dr Claus Hipp's philosophy of appropriate corporate behavior covering market, employees, the state and nature makes his baby foods company highly coveted by consumers. The company's ethics commission believes in economic fair play that can match the consumer's willingness to pay while processing the highest quality of organic raw materials that are sustainably grown. While many manufacturing companies' sustainability goals are towards the nature and the environment, Hipp takes a long-term ambition to survive in nature, as a part of it.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
An often raised ethical question in this matter is, whether consumers should choose freely or not. Should items be simply removed from their choices? Who decides what is removed and why? Some argue that instead of choice editing, labeling should provide information about the social and environmental performance of a product. Based on that, consumers are free to choose between sustainable and unsustainable products themselves.&lt;ref name=Maniates/&gt;

The opposite opinion is held by Tim Lang, professor of food policy at [[City University London]] and a prominent figure in Britain's food industry. In an interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'' journalist Leo Hickman, Lang argues that the consumer need not be bothered in the supermarket aisle to agonise over complex issues such as animal welfare, carbon footprints, workers' rights and excessive packaging, often without any meaningful data on the label to inform their decision-making. Lang instead suggested that the manufacturers and retailers should take more responsibility by making most of these decisions on consumer's behalf before the product even reaches the shelves. This would in turn allow the consumer to avoid endorsing products that are damaging to the environment as well as the society.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news

  |accessdate=June 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Furthermore, there is still no agreement on who defines if a product is sustainable or unsustainable. Therefore, decisions made about the availability of a product can cause conflicts between the different actors like government, policy makers, businesses and consumers as they might have varying views concerning the sustainable or unsustainable nature of a product.&lt;ref name=WBCSD/&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''''Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga'''''|鳥獣人物戯画||literally "Animal-person Caricatures"}}, commonly shortened to {{Nihongo|'''''Chōjū-giga'''''|鳥獣戯画||literally "Animal Caricatures"}}, is a famous set of four [[Emakimono|picture scroll]]s, or ''emakimono'', belonging to [[Kōzan-ji]] temple in [[Kyoto]], [[Japan]]. The ''Chōjū-giga'' scrolls are also referred to as '''''Scrolls of Frolicking Animals''''' and '''''Scrolls of Frolicking Animals and Humans''''' in English. Some think that [[Toba Sōjō]] created the scrolls; however, it seems clear from the style that more than one artist is involved.&lt;ref&gt;Paine and Soper, 139&lt;/ref&gt;  The right-to-left reading direction of ''Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga '' is  traditional in East Asia, and is still common in Japan. ''Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga '' is also credited as the oldest work of [[manga]]. The scrolls are now entrusted to the [[Kyoto National Museum]] and [[Tokyo National Museum]].

The scrolls are the earliest in a linear monochrome drawing style that was to continue in use in [[Japanese painting]] (as they are all done with the usual writing and painting brush, they count as painting).&lt;ref&gt;Paine and Soper, 139-140&lt;/ref&gt;  

As opened, the first scroll illustrates [[anthropomorphic]] rabbits and monkeys bathing and getting ready for a ceremony, a monkey thief runs from animals with sticks and knocks over a frog from the lively ceremony. Further on, the rabbits and monkeys are playing and wrestling while another group of animals participate in a funeral and frog prays to Buddha as the scroll closes.

The scrolls were also adapted into several novels published by Geijutsuhiroba, the first book simply compiled the scrolls into one publication, now out of print. One of the books participated as part of the company's ''Fine Arts Log'' series as well as some were exclusive to certain exhibitions. Other companies like Misuzu Shobo and Shibundō also published books based on the ''Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga'' emakimono.

Although ''Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga'' is sometimes credited as the first manga,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Ivanov| first=Boris| title=Vvedenie v iaponskuiu animatsiiu| publisher=Фонд развития кинематографии; РОФ «Эйзенштейновский центр исследований кинокультуры» |edition=2| location=Moscow| year=2001 |pages=11| isbn=5-901631-01-3|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; there have been some disputes with the ''[[Yomiuri Shimbun]]'' newspaper. Seiki Hosokibara pointed to the ''[[Shigisan-engi]]'' scrolls as the first manga, and [[Kanta Ishida]] explained that the scrolls should be treated as masterpieces in their own right.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

== Disputes ==
The ''[[Yomiuri Shimbun]]'' newspaper with Kanta Ishida discussed different theories of what really is the "first manga". [[Mangaka|Manga artist]], Seiki Hosokibara pointed to ''[[Shigisan-engi]]'' as the first manga in history. Ishida said that the scrolls be treated as masterpieces in their own right, and not be cubby-holed as just the origin of manga and they have no connection with contemporary manga and the domestic works we are familiar with today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=''Yomiuri'' Newspaper Discusses History's First Manga |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=2008-01-03 |work=[[Yomiuri Shimbun]] |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-01-03/yomiuri-first-manga |accessdate=2009-01-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Comparative religion''' is the branch of the [[study of religions]] concerned with the systematic comparison of the doctrines and practices of the world's [[religion]]s. In general the comparative study of religion yields a deeper understanding of the fundamental philosophical concerns of religion such as [[ethics]], [[metaphysics]], and the nature and forms of [[salvation]]. Studying such material is meant to give one a broadened and more sophisticated understanding of human beliefs and practices regarding the [[sacred]], [[numinous]], [[Spirituality|spiritual]], and [[Divinity|divine]].&lt;ref&gt;"Human beings' relation to that which they regard as holy, sacred, spiritual, and divine" [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] (online, 2006), cited after {{cite web |url=http://www.religionfacts.com/religion/quotes.htm |title=Definitions of Religion |website=Religion facts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of comparative religion, a common geographical classification&lt;ref name="EB" /&gt; of the [[Major religious groups|main world religions]] includes [[Religion in the Middle East|Middle Eastern religions]] (including [[Iranian religions]]), [[Indian religions]], [[East Asian religions]], [[African religions]], [[Native American religion|American religions]], [[Religion in Oceania|Oceanic religions]], and 
[[Classical antiquity|classical]] [[Hellenistic religion]]s.&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/497215/classification-of-religions/38029/Normative Charles Joseph Adams, ''Classification of religions: geographical'', Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Social scientists in the 19th century took a strong interest in comparative and "primitive" religion through the work of [[Max Müller]], [[Edward Burnett Tylor]], [[William Robertson Smith]], [[James George Frazer]], [[Émile  Durkheim]], [[Max Weber]], and [[Rudolf Otto]].&lt;ref&gt; Hans Kippenberg, ''Discovering Religious History in the Modern Age'' (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nicholas de Lange]], Professor of Hebrew and Jewish Studies at [[Cambridge University]], says that

{{quote|The comparative study of religions is an academic discipline which has been developed within Christian theology faculties, and it has a tendency to force widely differing phenomena into a kind of strait-jacket cut to a Christian pattern. The problem is not only that other 'religions' may have little or nothing to say about questions which are of burning importance for Christianity, but that they may not even see themselves as religions in precisely the same way in which Christianity sees itself as a religion.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas de Lange, ''Judaism'', Oxford University Press, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Geographical classification ==
According to Charles Joseph Adams, in the field of comparative religion, a common geographical classification discerns&lt;ref name="EB"/&gt; the [[Major religious groups|main world religions]] as follows:&lt;ref name="EB" /&gt;

# Middle Eastern religions, including Judaism, Christianity, Islam and a variety of ancient cults; 
# East Asian religions, the religious communities of China, Japan, and Korea, and consisting of Confucianism, Daoism, the various schools of [[Mahayana]] (“Greater Vehicle”) Buddhism, and [[Shinto|Shintō]]; 
# Indian religions, including early Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism, Sikhism, and Zoroastrianism, and sometimes also the [[Theravada]] (“Way of the Elders”) Buddhism and the Hindu- and Buddhist-inspired religions of South and Southeast Asia; 
# African religions, the ancient belief systems of the various indigenous peoples of Africa, excluding [[ancient Egyptian religion]], which is considered to belong to the ancient Middle East;
# American religions, the beliefs and practices of the various Indigenous peoples of the two American continents; 
# Oceanic religions, the religious systems of the peoples of the Pacific islands, Australia, and New Zealand; and 
# Classical religions of ancient Greece and Rome and their Hellenistic descendants.

=== Middle Eastern religions ===
==== Abrahamic or Western Asian religions ====
{{Main|Abrahamic religion|Western religion|Islamic religion}}

In the study of comparative religion, the category of Abrahamic religions consists of the three [[monotheistic]] religions, [[Christianity]], [[Islam]] and [[Judaism]], which claim [[Abraham]] (Hebrew ''Avraham'' אַבְרָהָם; Arabic ''Ibrahim'' إبراهيم ) as a part of their sacred history. Smaller religions such as [[Bahá'í Faith]] that fit this description are sometimes included but are often omitted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lisar.lss.wisc.edu/welcome/abrahamic.html Why Abrahamic?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070908060636/http://lisar.lss.wisc.edu/welcome/abrahamic.html |date=8 September 2007 }} Lubar Institute for the Study of the Abrahamic Religions at the University of Wisconsin&lt;/ref&gt;

The original belief in the [[One God]] of Abraham eventually became strictly monotheistic present-day [[Rabbinic Judaism]]. Christians believe that Christianity is the [[Supersessionism|fulfillment]] and continuation of the Jewish [[Tanakh|Old Testament]]. Christians believe that [[Jesus]] (Hebrew ''Yeshua'' יֵשׁוּעַ) is the [[Messiah]] (Christ) foretold in the [[Old Testament]] [[prophecy]], and believe in subsequent New Testament revelations based on the divine authority of Jesus in Christian belief (as the [[Incarnation|Incarnation of God]]). Islam believes the present Christian and Jewish scriptures have been [[Tahrif|corrupted]] over time and are no longer the original divine revelations as given to the [[Revelation#Mass revelation|Jewish people]] and to [[Mosaic authorship|Moses]], [[Pauline Christianity|Jesus]], and other prophets. For Muslims, the [[Qur'an]] is the final, complete revelation from [[God]] (Arabic الله ''[[Allah]]''), who believe it to have been [[divine revelation|revealed]] to [[Muhammad]] alone, who is believed by Muslims to be the [[Prophet of Islam|final prophet of Islam]], and the [[Khatam an-Nabiyyin]], meaning the last of the prophets ever sent by Allah ("seal of the prophets").
Based on the Muslim figure of the [[Mahdī]], the ultimate savior of humankind and the final Imām of the Twelve Imams, [[Báb|Ali Muhammad Shirazi]], later known as Bab, created the Bábí movement out of the belief that he was the gate to the Twelfth Imām. This signaled a break with Islam and started a new religious system, [[Bábism]]. However, in the 1860s a split occurred after which the vast majority of Bábís who considered Mirza Husayn `Ali or [[Bahá'u'lláh]] to be Báb's spiritual successor founded the Bahá'í Movement, while the minority who followed Subh-i-Azal came to be called Azalis.&lt;ref&gt;"But the upshot of the whole matter is, that out of every hundred Bábís probably not more than three or four are Ezelís &lt;nowiki&gt;[sic]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, all the rest accepting Behá'u'lláh &lt;nowiki&gt;[sic]&lt;/nowiki&gt; as the final and most perfect manifestation of the Truth." (Browne (1889) [http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/diglib/articles/A-E/browne/brbabism.htm p. 351])&lt;/ref&gt; The Bahá'í division eventually became a full-fledged religion of its own, the [[Bahá'í Faith]]. In comparison to the other Abrahamic religions, Judaism, Christianity and Islam, the number of adherents for Bahai faith and other minor Abrahamic religions are not very significant.

Out of the three major Abrahamic faiths, [[Christianity and Judaism]] are the two religions that diverge the most in theology and practice.

The historical interaction of [[Islam and Judaism]] started in the 7th century CE with the origin and spread of Islam. There are many common aspects between Islam and Judaism, and as Islam [[History of Islam|developed]], it gradually became the major religion closest to Judaism. As opposed to Christianity, which originated from interaction between ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]], [[Roman empire|Roman]], and [[Hebrew]] cultures, Judaism is very similar to Islam in its fundamental religious outlook, structure, jurisprudence and practice.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rabbi David Rosen]], [http://rabbidavidrosen.net/doc/Muslim-Jewish%20Relations/Jewish-Muslim%20Relations,%20Past%20&amp;%20Present%20Nov%2003.doc Jewish-Muslim Relations, Past and Present] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070616163849/http://rabbidavidrosen.net/doc/Muslim-Jewish%20Relations/Jewish-Muslim%20Relations%2C%20Past%20%26%20Present%20Nov%2003.doc |date=16 June 2007 }}, November 2003&lt;/ref&gt; There are many traditions within Islam originating from traditions within the [[Hebrew Bible]] or from post-biblical Jewish traditions. These practices are known collectively as the ''[[Isra'iliyat]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Justin Jaron Lewis, [http://post.queensu.ca/~jjl/islam.html  Islam and Judaism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405102236/http://post.queensu.ca/~jjl/islam.html |date=5 April 2007 }}, October 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The historical interaction between [[Christianity and Islam]] connects fundamental ideas in Christianity with similar ones in Islam. Islam accepts many aspects of Christianity as part of its faith{{snd}}with some differences in interpretation{{snd}}and rejects other aspects. Islam believes the [[Qur'an]] is the final revelation from [[God]] and a completion of all previous revelations, including the [[Bible]].

==== Iranian religions ====
{{Main|Proto-Indo-Iranian religion|Iranian religions}}

Several important religions and religious movements originated in [[Greater Iran]], that is, among [[Iranian peoples|speakers of various Iranian languages]]. They include [[Mithraism]], [[Ætsæg Din]], [[Yazdanism]], [[Yarsanism|Ahl-e Haqq]], [[Zurvanism]], [[Mandaeism]], [[Manichaeism]], and [[Mazdakism]].

[[Gautama Buddha]] is mentioned as an [[Avatar]] of [[Vishnu]] in the [[Puranic]] texts of Hinduism. Most Hindus believe the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] accepted and incorporated many tenets of Hinduism in his doctrine, however, Buddhists disagree and state there was no such thing as Hinduism at the time of Buddha and in fact, "Indeed, it absorbed so many Buddhist traits that it is virtually impossible to distinguish the latter in medieval and later Hinduism."&lt;ref&gt;MLA style:

=== East Asian or Taoic religions ===
[[File:Tao.svg|thumb|150px|The [[Chinese character]] depicting ''[[Tao]]'', the central concept in Taoism]]

{{Main|East Asian religions|East Asian Buddhism}}
{{See also|Tao|De (Chinese)}}

A Taoic religion is a religion, or religious philosophy, that focuses on the [[East Asian]] concept of ''[[Tao]]'' ("The Way"). This forms a large group of religions including [[Taoism]], [[Confucianism]], [[Jeung San Do]], [[Shinto]], [[I-Kuan Tao]], [[Cheondoism|Chondogyo]], [[Chen Tao (True Way Cult)|Chen Tao]] and [[Cao Dai]]. In large parts of East Asia, [[Buddhism]] has taken on some taoic features.

''Tao'' can be roughly stated to be the flow of the universe, or the force behind the natural order. It is believed to be the influence that keeps the universe balanced and ordered and is associated with nature, due to a belief that nature demonstrates the ''Tao''. The flow of ''[[Ch'i]]'', as the essential energy of action and existence, is compared to the universal order of ''Tao''. Following the ''Tao'' is also associated with a "proper" attitude, morality and lifestyle. This is intimately tied to the complex concept of ''[[De (Chinese)|De]]'', or literally "virtue" or "power." ''De'' is the active expression of ''Tao''.

Taoism and [[Chinese Chán|Ch'an Buddhism]] for centuries had a mutual influence on each other in China, Korea and Vietnam. These influences were inherited by [[Zen Buddhism]] when Ch'an Buddhism arrived in Japan and adapted as Zen Buddhism.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9128">'''Complementary holism''' is a [[social theory]] or conceptual framework proposed by [[Michael Albert]] and [[Robin Hahnel]], that sees all societies as consisting of a Human Center and Institutional Boundaries, and that all social relations in the political, economic, community/cultural and kinship "spheres" as mutually interacting to defining our social experiences. Complementary holism does not rest on an ''a priori'' assumption that a particular sphere is the base and all else is superstructure, as [[historical materialism]] does, but rather that we must take an empirical look at society's development and assess how it has been shaped by all social forces. Complementary holists agree with [[Marxists]] that economics is important to human and social development, just as they do with [[anarchists]] in regard to the [[State (polity)|State]] or with [[feminists]] in regard to [[gender inequality]], but they assert that Marxists see economics, or [[class conflict]], as the sole factor, and they don't believe that economics is always the most important factor.

In ''Liberating Theory'', Michael Albert, Robin Hahnel et al. write that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Just as Marx and Engels paid strict attention to "state of the art" science in their time, we should keep up with contemporary developments. Ironically, however, though most contemporary Marxists pride themselves on being "scientific," few bother to notice that "state of the art" science has changed dramatically in the last hundred years. While avoiding simplistic mimicry and misapplication of scientific principles, we should update our methods by seriously examining contemporary science for new ideas relevant to our theoretical efforts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Modern quantum physics, for example, teaches that reality is not a collection of separate entities but a vast and intricate "unbroken whole." Ilya Prigogine comments, "The new paradigms of science may be expected to develop into the new science of connectedness which means the recognition of unity in diversity." When thinking about phenomena, we inevitably conceptually abstract parts from the whole in which they reside, but they then exist as separate entities only in our perceptions. There are no isolated electrons, for example, only fields of force continually ebbing and flowing in a seamless web of activity which manifests events that we choose to call electrons because it suits our analytic purposes. For the physicist, each electron, quark, or whatever is a "process" and a "network." As a process it has a developmental trajectory--extending through all time. As a network, it is part of an interactive pattern--stretching throughout all space. Every part embodies and is subsumed in a larger whole.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Human Center and Institutional Boundary==
Each society has a human center where we find people, their consciousness, personalities, talents and needs. Each society also has an institutional boundary consisting of social institutions and their role structures. Just as our consciousnesses, needs and desires are shaped by the institutions we create to facilitate our social activities so are our institutions shaped by our cultural traditions. How we define our institutions and the roles we play in society has an important effect on what kind of people we become.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Society's center and boundary are ''complementary'' aspects of a single unbroken whole. Both center and boundary are complex dissipative systems. Whatever society's defining features may be, they will necessarily pervade both society's center and boundary. They will persist through evolutionary changes since such changes necessarily involve limited adaptations of both center and boundary. Revolution, however, will alter these defining features. Since we know that historically people universally engage in certain social activities, which in turn involve social relations contouring daily life and governing group interactions, as our next conceptual step it makes sense to subdivide society along lines highlighting these activities, social relations, and social groups. (''Liberating Theory'')&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Spheres==
Complementary holism carves out the Human Center and Institutional Boundary into four separate but interconnecting social spheres: the Economic Sphere, the Kinship Sphere, the Community Sphere and the Political Sphere.

# The [[Economic]] Sphere is where the production, consumption, and allocation of material means of life occur. The key institutions for the economy are workplaces, allocation mechanisms, property relations, and remuneration schemes.
# The [[Kinship]] Sphere is where child rearing, nurturing future generations, socializing and care giving occur. Key institutions are the family, with parental and child rearing roles, where gender and sexuality, and other relations form for boys and girls, men and women, fathers and mothers, adults, children and the elderly.
# The [[Political]] Sphere is where adjudication, policy regulation and law making occur with courts, a legislature and police.
# The [[Community]] Sphere is where identity, religion, and spirituality occur with race, ethnicity, places of worship, beliefs about life and death, celebration of cultural traditions, etc.

Like the human center and institutional boundary, these four spheres interconnect with one another:

&lt;blockquote&gt;People aren't economically-affected in one part of their lives and gender-affected in another; state-influenced one day of the week and community-influenced some other day. Instead, they simultaneously experience economic, kinship, governance, and community involvements, and this guarantees that spheres interact. At a particular time class may have more influence on molding a person's consciousness and behavior than gender, or vice-versa. But these influences must co-exist. ''(Liberating Theory)''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Accommodation==
Accommodation describes a particular way in which the four spheres interact with each other. The assigned roles that are a feature of one sphere may be accommodated in another. How our roles are divided in the workplace may accommodate with sexist and racist divisions found as central features in our Kinship and Community Spheres so that economic activity subjugates women and non-whites to lower pay and positions of power than men and whites.

==Co-Definition==
Another way the four spheres can interact is by co-defining each other. For example, workplace roles are often determined by more than "class divisions."

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is nothing inherent in capitalist economic relations that requires the activity of coffee-making to be assigned to the role of secretary. There is no purely economic reason why in the U.S., women are ghettoized into so-called "pink collar" jobs: clerical work, nursing, domestic work, restaurant and food service, retail sales, elementary school teaching, etc. There is nothing about economics that requires that in addition to different levels of compensation, women's and men's activities must or even should involve different degrees of oversight and mobility. Purely economic dynamics cannot explain such profound gender differentiations. In this sense, then, not only do economic relations accommodate kinship hierarchies, by placing women in the lowest "economicallydefined" positions, but patriarchy "co-defines" basic economic relations. (''Liberating Theory'')&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Social Change==
Proponents of complementary holism feel the social theory is not only helpful in understanding society as it is but in understanding how society can be changed. By recognizing the interconnecting social forces - the human center, institutional boundary and four social spheres - and how they shape and are shaped by the intertwining relationship with each other, complementary holists feel we are better equipped to transform society and overcome social oppressions.

Complementary holism sees two ways in which societies can change:

# ''Reproduction'': This is where a change recreates a past social feature. An example could be where a revolution overthrows one hierarchical political system and replaces it with another.
# ''Transformation'': This is where social activities create an entirely new characteristics that differ from the past. For example, a social revolution may overthrow a [[market economy]] and replace it with a self-managed [[participatory economy]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1675">{{for|other meanings|Contrast (disambiguation)}}

In [[literature]], an author uses '''contrast''' when he or she describes the difference(s) between two or more entities. For example, in the first four lines of [[William Shakespeare|William Shakespeare's]] ''[[Sonnet 130]]'', Shakespeare contrasts a [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]] to the sun, coral, snow, and wire.

Contrast is the antonym of [[simile]]. In poetic compositions, it is common for poets to set out an elaborate contrast or elaborate simile as the argument. For example, [[John Donne]] and the [[metaphysical poetry|metaphysical poets]] developed the [[conceit]] as a literary device, where an elaborate, implausible, and surprising analogy was demonstrated. In [[Renaissance]] poetry, and particularly in [[sonnet]]s, the contrast was similarly used as a poetic argument. In such verse, the entire poem argues that two seemingly alike or identical items are, in fact, quite separate and paradoxically different. These may take the form of ''my love is unlike all other women'' or ''I am unlike her other loves''.

In the early 18th century, a theory of [[wit]] developed by English writers (particularly [[John Locke]]) held that judgement sees the differences in like things, or imagination or fancy sees the likeness in different things, and wit operates properly by employing judgement and fancy to form sound propositions. In [[lyric poetry]], the author is often attempting to show how what seems to be solely an exercise of judgement or fancy is, in fact, wit.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1197">'''Ecosharing''' is an environmental ethic for people to live by: that their own impact on the Earth’s [[biosphere]] be limited to no more than their own fair ecoshare. The term seems to have been first used by G. Tyler Miller, Jr. in the 1975 edition of his ''Living in the Environment'' text.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Jr., G. Tyler ''Living in the Environment'' CA: Wadsworth Publishing Co, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; The 1990 book ''Coming of Age in the Global Village'' sought to quantify an "ecoshare" by linking it to average world per capita income and energy use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.projectworldview.org/comingofage.htm Cook, Stephen P. and Meadows, Donella H. ''Coming of Age in the Global Village'' AR: Parthenon Books, 1990]&lt;/ref&gt; A more modern approach might extend this by also including one's [[carbon footprint]]. However it is gauged, an ecoshare is determined by overall assessment of the human impact on the biosphere, computer models of its future condition, and necessary limits imposed by [[sustainability]] criteria.

According to some theories, [[emotion]]s are universal phenomena, albeit affected by [[culture]]. Emotions are "internal phenomena that can, but do not always, make themselves observable through expression and behavior".&lt;ref name=Ni&gt;{{cite book|author=Niedenthal, Paula M.|author2=Silvia Krauth-Gruber|author3=Francois Ric|year=2006|title=Psychology of Emotion Interpersonal, Experiential, and Cognitive Approaches|pages=5, 305–342|location=New York, NY|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-1841694023}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some emotions are universal and are experienced in similar ways as a reaction to similar events across all cultures, other emotions show considerable cultural differences in their antecedent events, the way they are experienced, the reactions they provoke and the way they are perceived by the surrounding society. According to other theories, termed [[social constructionist]], emotions are more deeply culturally influenced.  The components of emotions are universal, but the patterns are social constructions. Some also theorize that culture is affected by emotions of the people.

==Cultural studies of emotions==
Research on the relationship between culture and emotions dates back to 1872 when Darwin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Darwin|first=C|title=The expression of emotions in man and animals.|year=1998|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  argued that emotions and the expression of emotions are universal. Since that time, the universality of the [[Discrete emotion theory|six basic emotions]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ekman|first=P|title=Are there basic emotions?|journal=Psychological Review|year=1992|volume=99|pages=550–553|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.99.3.550|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (i.e., happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise) has ignited a discussion amongst psychologists, anthropologists, and sociologists.  While emotions themselves are universal phenomena, they are always influenced by culture.  How emotions are experienced, expressed, perceived, and regulated varies as a function of culturally normative behavior by the surrounding society.  Therefore, it can be said that culture is a necessary framework for researchers to understand variations in emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Richeson|first=P. J. &amp; Boyd, R.|title=Not by genes alone:  How culture transformed human evolution|year=2005|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pioneers==
In Darwin's opening chapter of ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]'', (1872/1998) Darwin considered the face to be the preeminent medium of emotional expression in humans, and capable of representing both major emotions and subtle variations within each one.  Darwin's ideas about facial expressions and his reports of cultural differences became the foundation for ethological research strategies.  [[Silvan Tomkins]]' (1962) ''[[Affect Theory]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tomkins|first=S.S.|title=Affect, imagery, consciousness: Vol 1. The positive effects|year=1962|publisher=Springer|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1963&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tomkins|first=S. S.|title=Affect, imagery, consciousness: Vol 2. The positive affects|year=1962|publisher=Springer|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;) built upon Darwin's research, arguing that facial expressions are biologically based, and universal manifestations of emotions. The research of [[Paul Ekman]] (1971)&lt;ref name="Ekman1971"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ekman|first=P.|title=Universal and cultural differences in facial expressions of emotion|year=1971|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Carroll Izard (1971)&lt;ref name="Izard1971"&gt;{{cite book|last=Izard|first=C. E.|title=The face of emotions|year=1971|publisher=Appleton-Century-Crofts|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; further explored the proposed universality of emotions, showing that the expression of emotions were recognized as communicating the same feelings in cultures found in Europe, North and South America, Asia, and Africa. Ekman (1971)&lt;ref name="Ekman1971" /&gt; and Izard (1971)&lt;ref name="Izard1971" /&gt; both created sets of photographs displaying emotional expressions that were agreed upon by Americans.  These photographs were then shown to people in other countries with the instructions to identify the emotion that best describes the face. The work of Ekman, and Izard, concluded that facial expressions were in fact universal, innate, and phylogenetically derived.  Some theorists, including Darwin, even argued that "Emotion ... is neuromuscular activity of the face". Many researchers since have criticized this belief and instead argue that emotions are much more complex than initially thought.
In addition to pioneering research in psychology, ethnographic accounts of cultural differences in emotion began to emerge.  Margaret Mead, a cultural anthropologist writes about unique emotional phenomena she experienced while living among a small village of 600 Samoans on the island of Ta'u in her book ''Coming of Age in Samoa''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mead|first=M.|title=Coming of age in Samoa: A psychological study of primitive you for western civilization|year=1961|publisher=Morrow|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gregory Bateson, an English anthropologist, social scientist, linguist, and visual anthropologist used photography and film to document his time with the people of Bajoeng Gede in Bali.  According to his work, cultural differences were very evident in how the Balinese mothers displayed muted emotional responses to their children when the child showed a climax of emotion.  In displays of both love (affection) and anger (temper) Bateson's notes documented that mother and child interactions did not follow Western social norms.  The fieldwork of anthropologist [[Jean Briggs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Briggs|first=J. L.|title=Never in anger: Portrait of an Eskimo family|year=1970|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;  details her almost two year experience living with the Utku Inuit people in her book ''Never in Anger: Portrait of an Eskimo Family'' .  Briggs lived as the daughter of an Utku family describing their society as particularly unique emotional control.  She rarely observed expressions of anger or aggression and if it were expressed, it resulted in ostracism.

Scholars working on the [[history of emotions]] have provided some useful terms for discussing cultural emotion expression. Concerned with distinguishing a society's emotional values and emotional expressions from an individual's actual emotional experience, William Reddy has coined the term ''[[emotive (sociology)|emotive]]''. In ''The Making of Romantic Love'', Reddy uses cultural counterpoints to give credence to his argument that romantic love is a 12th-century European construct, built in a response to the parochial view that sexual desire was immoral. Reddy suggests that the opposition of sexual ardor and true love was not present in either Heain Japan or the Indian kingdoms of Bengal and Orissa.&lt;ref name=Reddy&gt;{{cite book|author=Reddy, W.|year=2012|title=The Making of Romantic Love: Longing and Sexuality in Europe, South Asia, and Japan, 900–1200 CE|publisher=University Of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL|isbn=978-0226706276}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, these cultures did not share the view of sexual desire as a form of appetite, which Reddy suggests was widely disseminated by the Church. Sexuality and spirituality were not conceived in a way which separated lust from love: indeed, sex was often used as a medium of spiritual worship, emulating the divine love between Krishna and Rada.&lt;ref name=Reddy/&gt; Sexual desire and love were inextricable from one another. Reddy therefore argues that the emotion of romantic love was created in Europe in the 12th century, and was not present in other cultures at the time.&lt;ref name=Reddy/&gt;

==Cultural norms of emotions==
Culture provides structure, guidelines, expectations, and rules to help people understand and interpret behaviors.  Several ethnographic studies suggest there are cultural differences in social consequences, particularly when it comes to evaluating emotions.  For example, as [[Jean Briggs]] described in the Utku Eskimo population, anger was rarely expressed, and in the rare occasion that it did occur, it resulted in social ostracism.  These cultural expectations of emotions are sometimes referred to as display rules.  Psychologists (Ekman &amp; Friesen, 1969;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ekman|first=P.|author2=Friesen, W. V.|title=The repertoire of nonverbal behavior: Categories, origins, usage, and coding|journal=Semiotica|year=1969|volume=1|pages=49–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; Izard, 1980;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Izard|first=C. E.|title=Cross-cultural perspectives on emotion and emotion communication|year=1980|publisher=American Psychological Association|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=23–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarni, 1999&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sarni|first=C.|title=The development of emotional competence|year=1990|publisher=Guilford|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;) believe that these rules are learned during a socialization process.  Ekman and Friesen (1975)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ekman, P.|first=Friesen, W. V.|title=Unmasking the face|year=1975|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=New Jersey}}&lt;/ref&gt;   have also suggested that these  "unwritten codes" govern the manner in which emotions may be expressed, and that different rules may be internalized as a function of an individual's culture, gender or family background.  
Miyamoto &amp; Ryff (2011)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miyamoto|first=Y.|author2=Ryff, C|title=Cultural differences in the dialectical and non-dialectical emotional styles and their implications for health|journal=Cognition and Emotion|year=2011|volume=25|pages=22–30|doi=10.1080/02699931003612114|pmc=3269302}}&lt;/ref&gt;   used the term cultural scripts to refer to cultural norms that influence how people expect emotions to be regulated.   Cultural scripts dictate how positive and negative emotions should be experienced and combined. Cultural scripts may also guide how people choose to regulate their emotions which ultimately influences an individual's emotional experience.  For example, research suggests that in Western cultures, the dominant social script is to maximize positive emotions and minimize negative emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kityama|first=S.|author2=Markus, H. |author3=Kityama, S. |title=Is there a universal need for positive self-regard?|journal=Psychological Review|year=1999|volume=106|pages=766–794|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.106.4.766|pmid=10560328|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Eastern cultures, the dominant cultural script is grounded in "dialectical thinking" and seeking to find a middle way by experiencing a balance between positive and negative emotions.  Because normative behaviors in these two cultures vary, it should also be expected that their cultural scripts would also vary.  
Tsai et al. (2007)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tsai|first=J. L.|author2=Louie, J. Y. |author3=Chen, E. E. |author4=Uchida, Y. |title=Learning what feelings to desire: Socialization of ideal affect through children's storybooks|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|year=2007|volume=33|pages=17–30|doi=10.1177/0146167206292749|pmid=17178927|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  argues that not only do cultural factors influence ideal affect (i.e., the affective states that people ideally want to feel) but that the influence can be detected very early.  Their research suggests that preschool aged children are socialized to learn ideal affect through cultural products such as children storybooks.  They found that European American preschool children preferred excited (vs. calm) smiles and activities more and perceived an excited (vs. calm) smile as happier than Taiwanese Chinese preschoolers.  This is consistent with American best sellers containing more excited and arousing content in their books than the Taiwanese best sellers.  These findings suggest that cultural differences in which emotions are desirable or, ideal affect, become evident very early.

===Culture and emotional experiences===
A cultural syndrome as defined by Triandis (1997)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Harry C. Triandis|last=Triandis|first=H.|title=Cross-cultural perspectives on personality|year=1997|publisher=Academic Press|location=San Diego|pages=439–464}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is a "shared set of beliefs, attitudes, norms, values, and behavior organized around a central theme and found among speakers of one language, in one times period, and in one geographic region".  Because cultures are shared experiences, there are obvious social implications for emotional expression and emotional experiences.  For example, the social consequences of expressing or suppressing emotions will vary depending upon the situation and the individual.  Hochschild (1983)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hochschild|first=R.|title=The managed heart|year=1983|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;   discussed the role of feeling rules, which are social norms that prescribe how people should feel at certain times (e.g. wedding day, at a funeral).  These rules can be general (how people should express emotions in general) and also situational (events like birthdays).
Culture also influences the ways emotions are experienced depending upon which emotions are valued in that specific culture.  For example, happiness is generally considered a desirable emotion across cultures.  In countries with more individualistic views such as America, happiness is viewed as infinite, attainable, and internally experienced. In collectivistic cultures such as Japan, emotions such as happiness are very relational, include a myriad of social and external factors, and reside in shared experiences with other people.  Uchida, Townsend, Markus, &amp; Bergseiker (2009)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Uchida|first=Y.|author2=Townsend, S.S.M. |author3=Markus, H.R. |author4=Bergseiker, H.B |title=Emotios as within or between people? Cultural variations in lay theories of emotion expression and inference|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|year=2009|volume=35|pages=1427–1438|doi=10.1177/0146167209347322|issue=11 |pmid=19745200}}&lt;/ref&gt;   suggest that Japanese contexts reflect a conjoint model meaning that emotions derive from multiple sources and involve assessing the relationship between others and the self.  However, in American contexts, a disjoint model is demonstrated through emotions being experienced individually and through self-reflection.  Their research suggests that when Americans are asked about emotions, they are more likely to have self-focused responses "I feel joy" whereas as Japanese typical reaction would reflect emotions between the self and others "I would like to share my happiness with others."

==Culture and emotion regulation==
Emotions play a critical role in interpersonal relationships and how people relate to each other.   Emotional exchanges can have serious social consequences that can result in either maintaining and enhancing positive relationships, or becoming a source of antagonism and discord (Fredrickson, 1998;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fredrickson|first=B. L.|title=What good are positive emotions?|journal=Review of General Psychology|year=1998|volume=2|pages=300–319|doi=10.1037/1089-2680.2.3.300|pmid=21850154|issue=3|pmc=3156001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gottman &amp; Levenson, 1992)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gottman|first=J. M.|author2=Levensen, R. W.|title=Marital processes predictive of later dissolution: Behavior, physiology, and health|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1992|volume=63|pages=221–233|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.63.2.221|pmid=1403613|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Even though people may generally "want to feel better than worse" (Larsen, 2000),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Larsen|first=R.|title=Toward a science of mood regulation|journal=Psychological Inquiry|year=2000|volume=11|pages=129–141|doi=10.1207/S15327965PLI1103_01|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;) how these emotions are regulated may differ across cultures.  Research by [[Yuri Miyamoto]] suggests that cultural differences influence emotion regulation strategies.  Research also indicates that different cultures socialize their children to regulate their emotions according to their own cultural norms.  For example, ethnographic accounts suggest that American mothers think that it is important to focus on their children's successes while Chinese mothers think it is more important to provide discipline for their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=P.|author2=Wang, S.|author3=Sandel, T.|author4=Cho, G.|title=Self-esteem as folk theory: A comparison of European American and Taiwanese mothers' beliefs|journal=Parenting: Science and Practice|year=2002|volume=2|pages=209–239|doi=10.1207/S15327922PAR0203_02|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To further support this theory, a laboratory experiment found that when children succeeded on a test, American mothers were more likely than Chinese mothers to provide positive feedback (e.g. "You're so smart!"), in comparison to Chinese mothers who provided more neutral or task relevant feedback (e.g. "Did you understand the questions or did you just guess?"; Ng, Pomerantz, &amp; Lam, 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ng|first=F.|author2=Pomerantz, E. |author3=Lam, S. |title=European American and Chinese parents' responses to children's success and failure: Implications for children's responses|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=2007|volume=43|pages=1239–1255|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.43.5.1239|pmid=17723048|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;).   This shows how American mothers are more likely to "up-regulate" positive emotions by focusing on their children's success whereas Chinese mothers are more likely to "down-regulate" children's positive emotions by not focusing on their success.
Americans see emotions as internal personal reactions; emotions are about the self (Markus &amp; Kityama, 1991&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Markus|first=H. R.|author2=Kityama, S.|title=Culture and the self: Implications for cognition, emotion, and motivation|journal=Psychological Review|year=2007|volume=98|pages=224–253|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.98.2.224|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  In America, emotional expression is encouraged by parents and peers while suppression is often disapproved.  Keeping emotions inside is viewed as being insincere as well as posing a risk to one's health and well being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Richards|first=J. M.|author2=Gross, J. J.|title=Emotion regulation and memory:  The cognitive costs of keeping one's cool|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2000|volume=79|pages=410–424|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.79.3.410|pmid=10981843|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Japanese cultures, however, emotions reflect relationships in addition to internal states.  Some research even suggests that emotions that reflect the inner self cannot be separated from emotions that reflect the larger group.  Therefore, unlike American culture, expression of emotions is often discouraged, and suppressing one's individual emotions to better fit in with the emotions of the group is looked at as mature and appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rothbaum|first=F.|author2=Pott, M. |author3=Azuma, H. |author4=Miyake, K. |author5=Weisz, J. |title=The development of close relationships in Japan and the US: Pathways of symbiotic harmony and generative tension|journal=Child Development|year=2000|volume=71|pages=1121–1142|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00214|pmid=11108082|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emotional perception and recognition===
The role of facial expressions in emotional communication is often debated.  While Darwin believed the face was the most preeminent medium of emotion expression, more recent scientific work challenges that theory.  Furthermore, research also suggests that cultural contexts behave as cues when people are trying to interpret facial expressions.  In everyday life, information from people's environments influences their understanding of what a facial expression means. According to research by Masuda et al. (2008),&lt;ref name=Masuda&gt;{{cite journal|last=Masuda|first=T.|author2=Ellsworth, P. C.|author3=Mequita, B.|author4=Leu, J.|author5=Tanida, S.|author6=Van de Veerdonk, E.|title=Placing the face in context: Cultural differences in the perception of facial emotion|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2008|volume=94|pages=365–381|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.94.3.365|pmid=18284287|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; people can only attend to a small sample of the possible events in their complex and ever- changing environments, and increasing evidence suggests that people from different cultural backgrounds allocate their attention very differently. This means that different cultures may interpret the same social context in very different ways.  Since Americans are viewed as individualistic, they should have no trouble inferring people's inner feelings from their facial expressions, whereas Japanese people may be more likely to look for contextual cues in order to better understand one's emotional state.  
Evidence of this phenomenon is found in comparisons of Eastern and Western artwork.  In Western art there is a preoccupation with the face that does not exist in Eastern art. For example, in Western art the figure occupies a larger part of the frame and is clearly noticeably separated from the ground. In East Asian artwork, the central figure is significantly smaller and also appears to be more embedded in the background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nisbett|first=R. E.|author2=Masuda, T.|title=Culture and point of view|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|year=2003|volume=100|pages=11163–70|doi=10.1073/pnas.1934527100|pmc=196945|bibcode=2003PNAS..10011163N}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a laboratory setting, Masuda et al.&lt;ref name=Masuda/&gt; also tested how sensitive both Americans and Japanese would be to social contexts by showing them pictures of cartoons that included an individual in the context of a group of four other people. They also varied the facial expressions of the central figure and group members.  They found that American participants were more narrowly focused with judging the cartoon's emotional states than the Japanese participants were.  In their recognition task they also observed that the Japanese participants paid more attention to the emotions of the background figures than Americans did.

==Individualistic vs. collectivistic cultures==
Contemporary literature has traced the influence of culture on a variety of aspects of emotion, from emotional values to [[Regulation of emotion|emotion regulation]]. Indeed, culture may be best understood as a channel through which emotions are molded and subsequently expressed. Indeed, this had been most extensively discussed in psychology by examining [[Individualism|individualistic]] and [[Collectivism|collectivistic]] cultures.

The individualistic vs. collectivistic cultural paradigm has been widely used in the study of emotion psychology. Collectivistic cultures are said to promote the [[interdependence]] of individuals and the notion of social harmony.  Indeed, Niedenthal suggests that: "The needs, wishes, and desires of the collectives in which individuals find themselves are emphasized, and the notion of individuality is minimized or even absent from the cultural model".&lt;ref name=Ni/&gt; Individualistic cultures, however, promote individual autonomy and [[independence]]. Individual needs, wishes, and desires are emphasized and the possibility of personal attainment is encouraged. Collectivistic cultures include those of Asia and Latin America, whilst individualistic cultures include those of North America and Western Europe. North America, specifically, is seen to be the prototype of an individualistic culture.&lt;ref name=Ni/&gt;
 
Research has shown that the collectivism vs. individualism paradigm informs cultural emotional expression. An influential paper by Markus &amp; Kitayama, on the influence of culture on emotion, established that in more collectivistic cultures, emotions were conceived as relational to the group.&lt;ref name=Markus&gt;{{cite journal|author=Markus, H.|author2=Kitayama, S.|last-author-amp=yes|year=1991|title=Culture and the self: Implications for cognition, emotion, and motivation|journal=Psychological Review|volume=98|pages=224–253|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.98.2.224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in collectivistic cultures, emotions are believed to occur between people, rather than within an individual.&lt;ref name= Markus/&gt; When Japanese school students were asked about their emotions, they usually stated than an emotion comes from their outside social surroundings.&lt;ref name=Uchida/&gt; When asked about where the emotions they feel originate from, Japanese school students never referred to themselves first.&lt;ref name=Uchida/&gt; This suggests that Japanese people believe emotions exist within the environment, between individuals, in line with collectivistic values.&lt;ref name=Uchida&gt;{{cite journal|author=Uchida, Y.|author2=Townsend, S. S. M.|author3=Markus, H. R.|author4=Bergsieker, H. B.|last-author-amp=yes|year=2009|title=Emotions as within or between people? Cultural variation in lay theories of emotion expression and inference|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|volume=35|pages=1427–1439|doi=10.1177/0146167209347322|pmid=19745200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individualistic cultures, however, conceive emotions as independent internal experiences, occurring within an individual. When American school students were asked about their emotions, they usually stated that they experienced emotions within themselves.&lt;ref name=Uchida/&gt; This suggests that Americans consider emotions as personal, experienced internally and independently.  Markus &amp; Kitayama purport that emotions like friendliness and shame - which promote interconnectedness - are predominant in Asian culture. Conversely, European-American cultures were shown to be predominated by individualistic emotions, such as pride or anger.&lt;ref name=Markus/&gt;

===Emotion suppression===
Collectivistic cultures are believed to be less likely to express emotions, in fear of upsetting social harmony. Miyahara, referencing a study conducted on Japanese interpersonal communication, purports that the Japanese "are low in self disclosure, both verbally and non-verbally....Most of these attributes are ascribed to the Japanese people's collectivistic orientations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Miyahara, Akira|title=Toward Theorizing Japanese Communication Competence from a Non-Western Perspective|journal=American Communication Journal|volume=3|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study conducted showed that Japanese individuals have a relatively low expression of emotion. Niedenthal further suggests that: "Emotional moderation in general might be expected to be observed in collectivist cultures more than in individualistic cultures, since strong emotions and emotional expression could disrupt intra-group relations and smooth social functioning".&lt;ref name=Ni/&gt;

Individualistic cultures are seen to express emotions more freely than collectivistic cultures. In a study comparing relationships among American and Japanese individuals, it was found that: "People in individualistic cultures are motivated to achieve closer relationships with a selected few, and are willing to clearly express negative emotions towards others".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Takahashi, Keiko Naomi Ohara|author2=Toni C. Antonucci|author3=Hiroko Akiyama|title=Commonalities and differences in close relationships among the Americans and Japanese: A comparison by the individualism/collectivism concept|journal=International Journal of Behavioral Development|volume=26|number=5|date=September 1, 2002|pages=453–465|doi=10.1080/01650250143000418}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research by Butler et al., found that the social impact of [[Regulation of emotion|emotion suppression]] is moderated by the specific culture. Whilst the suppression of emotion by those with European Americans values led to non-responsive reactions and hostility, individuals with bicultural Asian-American values were perceived as less hostile and more engaged when they suppressed their emotions.&lt;ref name=Butler&gt;{{cite journal|author=Butler, E. A.|author2=Lee, T. L.|author3=Gross, J. J.|last-author-amp=yes|year=2007| title=Emotion regulation and culture: Are the social consequences of emotion suppression culture-specific?|journal=Emotion|volume=7|pages=30–48|pmid=17352561|doi=10.1037/1528-3542.7.1.30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, individuals with Asian-American values were more skilled in emotional suppression than individuals with European-American values. The article explanation is that Asian-Americans may engage in habitual suppression more often as negative emotions are seen to cause social disharmony and thus contradict cultural values.&lt;ref name=Butler/&gt;

===Culture and emotion socialization===
Research undertaken in the socialization of children cross-culturally has shown how early cultural influences start to affect emotions. Studies have shown the importance of socializing children in order to imbue them with emotional competence.&lt;ref name=Fried&gt;{{cite journal|author=Friedlmeier, W.|author2=Corapci, F.|author3=Cole, P. M.|last-author-amp=yes|year=2011|title=Socialization of emotions in cross-cultural perspective|journal=Social and Personality Psychology Compass|volume=5|issue=7|pages=410–427|doi=10.1111/j.1751-9004.2011.00362.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research by Friedlmeier et al., suggests children must be socialized in order to meet the emotional values and standards of their culture.&lt;ref name=Fried/&gt; For instance, in dealing with negative emotions, American parents were more likely to encourage emotion expression in children, thus promoting autonomy and individualistic competence.&lt;ref name=Fried/&gt; East Asian parents, however, attempted to minimize the experience of the negative emotion, by either distracting their child or trying to make their child suppress the emotion. This promotes relational competence and upholds the value of group harmony.&lt;ref name=Fried/&gt; Children are thus socialized to regulate emotions in line with cultural values.
 
Further research has assessed the use of storybooks as a tool with which children can be socialized to the emotional values of their culture.&lt;ref name=Tsai&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tsai J.L.|author2=Louie J.Y.|author3=Chen E.E.|author4=Uchida Y.|year=2007|title=Learning what feelings to desire: Socialization of ideal affect through children's storybooks|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|volume=33|issue=1|pages=17–30|doi=10.1177/0146167206292749|pmid=17178927}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taiwanese values promote ideal affect as a calm happiness, where American ideal affect is excited happiness.&lt;ref name=Tsai/&gt; Indeed, it was found that American preschoolers preferred excited smiles and perceived them as happier than Taiwanese children did, and these values were seen to be mirrored in storybook pictures.&lt;ref name=Tsai/&gt; Importantly, it was shown that across cultures, exposure to story books altered children's preferences. Thus, a child exposed to an exciting (versus calm) book, would alter their preference for excited (versus calm) activity.&lt;ref name=Tsai/&gt; This shows that children are largely malleable in their emotions, and suggests that it takes a period of time for cultural values to become ingrained.

Another study has shown that American culture values ''high arousal positive states'' such as excitement, over ''low arousal positive states'' such as calmness.&lt;ref name=Miao&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tsai J.L.|author2=Miao F.F.|author3=Seppala E.|author4=Fung H.H.|author5=Yeung D.Y. |year=2007 |title=Influence and adjustment goals: Sources of cultural differences in ideal affect |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=92 |issue=6 |pages=1102–1117 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.92.6.1102 |url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/30495759/tsai2007.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ56TQJRTWSMTNPEA&amp;Expires=1450571293&amp;Signature=jtDjE233%2B5nTM9%2Fdit%2FASsPegUs%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DInfluence_and_Adjustment_Goals_Sources_o.pdf |format=PDF |pmid=17547491}}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in Chinese culture ''low arousal positive states'' are preferable to ''high arousal positive states''. The researchers provide a framework to explain this, suggesting that ''high arousal positive states'' are needed in order to influence someone else, where ''low arousal positive states'' are useful for adjusting to someone else.&lt;ref name=Miao/&gt; This explanation is in line with the collectivism-individualism dichotomy: American values promote individual autonomy and personal achievement, where Asian values promote relational harmony. Emotion expression is consequently seen to be influenced largely by the culture in which a person has been socialized.

===Culture of honor===
Nisbett &amp; Cohen's 1996 study ''Culture of Honor'' examines the violent [[Culture of honor (Southern United States)|honor culture]] in the Southern states of the USA. The study attempts to address why the southern USA is more violent, with a higher homicide rate, than its northern counterpart.  It is suggested that the higher rate of violence is due to the presence of a 'culture of honor' in the southern USA.&lt;ref name=Nisbett&gt;{{cite book|author=Nisbett, R.E.|author2=Cohen, D.|last-author-amp=yes|year=1996|title=Culture of honor: The psychology of violence in the South |location=Boulder, CO|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=978-0813319933}}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of experiments was designed to determine whether southerners got angrier than northerners when they were insulted. In one example, a participant was bumped into and insulted, and their subsequent facial expressions were coded. Southerners showed significantly more anger expressions.&lt;ref name=Nisbett/&gt; Furthermore, researchers measured cortisol levels, which increase with stress and arousal, and testosterone levels, which increase when primed for aggression. In insulted southerners, cortisol and testosterone levels rose by 79% and 12% respectively, which was far more than in insulted northerners.&lt;ref name=Nisbett/&gt; With their research, Nisbett &amp; Cohen show that southern anger is expressed in a culturally specific manner.

==Challenges in cultural research of emotions==
One of the biggest challenges in cultural research and human emotions is the lack of diversity in samples.  Currently, the research literature is dominated by comparisons between Western (usually American) and Eastern Asian (usually Japanese or Chinese) sample groups.  This limits our understanding of how emotions vary and future studies should include more countries in their analyses.
Another challenge outlined by Matsumoto (1990)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Matsumoto|first=D.|title=Cultural similarities and differences in display rules|journal=Motivation and Emotion|year=1990|volume=14|issue=3|pages=195–214|doi=10.1007/BF00995569}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is that culture is ever changing and dynamic.  Culture is not static.  As the cultures continue to evolve it is necessary that research capture these changes.  Identifying a culture as "collectivistic" or "individualistic" can provide a stable as well as inaccurate picture of what is really taking place.  No one culture is purely collectivistic or individualistic and labeling a culture with these terms does not help account for the cultural differences that exist in emotions.   As Matsumoto argues, a more contemporary view of cultural relations reveals that culture is more complex than previously thought.  
Translation is also a key issue whenever cultures that speak different languages are included in a study.  Finding words to describe emotions that have comparable definitions in other languages can be very challenging.  For example, happiness, which is considered one of the six basic emotions, in English has a very positive and exuberant meaning.  In Hindi, [[Sukhi]] is a similar term however it refers to peace and happiness. Although happiness is a part of both definitions, the interpretation of both terms could lead to researchers to making assumptions about happiness that actually do not exist.

===Further research===
Studies have shown that Western and Eastern cultures have distinct differences in emotional expressions with respect to hemi-facial asymmetry; Eastern population showed bias to the right hemi-facial for positive emotions, while the Western group showed left hemi-facial bias to both negative and positive emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mandal M. K.|author2=Harizuka S.|author3=Bhushan B.|author4=Mishra R.C.|last-author-amp=yes|year=2001|title=Cultural variation in hemi-facial asymmetry of emotion expressions|journal=British Journal of Social Psychology|volume=40|pages=385–398|doi=10.1348/014466601164885}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, the valence and arousal of the twelve most popular emotion keywords expressed on the micro-blogging site Twitter were measured using latent semantic clustering in three geographical regions: Europe, Asia and North America. It was demonstrated that the valence and arousal levels of the same emotion keywords differ significantly with respect to these geographical regions — Europeans are, or at least present themselves as more positive and aroused, North Americans are more negative and Asians appear to be more positive but less aroused when compared to global valence and arousal levels of the same emotion keywords.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Bann, E. Y.|author2=Bryson, J. J. |year=2013|contribution=Measuring Cultural Relativity of Emotional Valence and Arousal using Semantic Clustering and Twitter|title=Proceedings of the 35th Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society|pages=1809–1814|arxiv=1304.7507 |bibcode=2013arXiv1304.7507Y}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shows that emotional differences between Western and Eastern cultures can, to some extent, be inferred through their language style.

===Conclusion===
Culture affects every aspect of emotions.  Identifying which emotions are good or bad, when emotions are appropriate to be expressed, and even how they should be displayed are all influenced by culture.  Even more importantly, cultures differentially affect emotions, meaning that exploring cultural contexts is key to understanding emotions.  Through incorporating sociological, anthropological, and psychological research accounts it can be concluded that exploring emotions in different cultures is very complex and the current literature is equally as complex, reflecting multiple views and the hypothesis.

== Miniature books ==


Since 1980s Ksenevich has been collecting rare and [[miniature book]]s. These are books of the early 19th century, pocket-sized, containing a variety of subjects, including those published in different languages in Belarus and many other countries all over the world: composite books containing works of classics of Belarusian, Russian and world poetry, selected prose, reference books and encyclopedias, researches in the branch of history and art history, comic editions and children's books, books of the Bible and Christian literature, as well as cook, chess and philosophy books. Ksenevich considers a miniature book to be a high-water mark of printing art. Publishing of such books requires delicate cooperation of highly professional artists, print workers, designers. In an interview he pointed out the following: "miniature books are a trademark of the country's printing industry. And Belarus is famous for its books. First books were published pocket-sized in Minsk in 1833. And this tradition has existed ever since: many publishing houses issue wonderful miniature books, which win awards at international competitions". Evgeny Ksenevich more than once organized exhibitions of miniature books from his collection. The most significant exhibitions are: Exhibition in the Petrus Brovka State Literary Museum (2009); exhibition of miniature books in the State Museum of the History of Belarusian Literature, commemorating the 520th birthday of [[Francysk Skaryna|Francisk Skorina]] (2010).

'''Gaunilo''' or '''Gaunillon'''{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=93}} ({{floruit|11th}} century) was a [[Benedictine]] [[monk]] of [[Marmoutier Abbey, Tours|Marmoutier Abbey]] in [[Tours]], [[France]]. He is best known for his contemporary criticism of the [[ontological argument]] for the [[existence of God]] which appeared in [[St&amp;nbsp;Anselm]]'s ''[[Proslogion]]''. In his work ''In Behalf of the Fool'',{{refn|The title of Gaunilo's book repeats Anselm's use of the fool mentioned in the [[Psalms]] who doubts the existence of God.&lt;ref&gt;Psalm 14:1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Psalm 53:1&lt;/ref&gt;}} Gaunilo contends that St&amp;nbsp;Anselm's ontological argument fails because logic of the same kind would force one to conclude many things exist which certainly do not.&lt;ref&gt;''An Introduction to the Philosophy of Religion'', Michael J. Murray and Michael Cannon Rea, [[Cambridge University Press]], 2008, pg. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; An [[empiricist]], Gaunilo thought that the human intellect is only able to comprehend information provided by the senses.&lt;ref&gt;''The History of Theology: Middle Ages'', Giulio D'Onofrio and Basil Studer, Liturgical Press, 2008, pg. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

Little beyond this essay is known of Gaunilo; no other extant writings bear his name. Anselm wrote a [[Reply to Gaunilo|reply to it]], essentially arguing that Gaunilo had missed his point.
==The "Lost Island" refutation==
Anselm claimed his ontological argument as proof of the existence of God, whom he described as that being for which no greater can be conceived.  A god that does not exist cannot be that than which no greater can be conceived, as existence would make it greater.  Thus, according to St. Anselm, the concept of God necessarily entails His existence. He denies Gaunilo a Godless [[epistemology]].&lt;ref&gt;''Anselm of Canterbury: The beauty of Theology'', David S. Hogg,
Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2004, pg. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaunilo [[Ontological argument#Gaunilo|criticised Anselm's argument]] by employing the same reasoning, via ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'', to "prove" the existence of the mythical "Lost Island", the greatest or most perfect island: if the island of which we are thinking does not exist, it cannot be the greatest conceivable island, for, to be the greatest conceivable island, it would have to exist, as any existent island would be greater than an imaginary one.  This, of course, is merely a direct application of Anselm's own premise that existence is a perfection.  Since we can conceive of this greatest or most perfect island, it must, by Anselm's way of thinking, exist.  While this argument is absurd, Gaunilo claims that it is [[reductio ad absurdam|no more so]] than Anselm's.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Anselm had no difficulty in rejecting this parody, because Gaunilo had described the Lost Island as "an island more excellent than any other lands".  Anselm correctly pointed out that nowhere had he had put forward the kind of argument which Gaunilo alleged, "because the phrase 'greater than everything' does not have the same force for the purpose of proving that what is spoken of is in reality as [his own phrase] "than which a greater cannot be conceived" &lt;Anselm's Reply V&gt;. Because Gaunilo's phrase did not contain the words "can be conceived", his counter-argument cannot generate the contradiction from which Anselm concludes that something than which a greater cannot be conceived is in reality.   


Philosophers often attempt to prove the [[ontological]] argument wrong by comparing Anselm's with Gaunilo's.  The former runs:  

# God is that being than which no greater can be conceived.
# It is greater to exist in reality than merely as an idea.
# If God does not exist, we can conceive of an even greater being, ''that is'' one that ''does'' exist.
# Therefore, God must indeed exist in reality.

Gaunilo's parody runs along the same lines:

# The Lost Island is that island than which no greater can be conceived.
# It is greater to exist in reality than merely as an idea.
# If the Lost Island does not exist, one can conceive of an even greater island, that is one that does exist.
# Therefore, the Lost Island exists in reality.

If one of these arguments is sound, it has been asserted, they must both be sound.  By Gaunilo's reckoning, however, one (and, therefore, the other, too) is unsound.  The Lost Island does not exist, so there is something wrong with the logic that proves that it does.  Because the argument proves true in one case that which is patently false (the Lost Island), it is fair to ask whether it may fairly be regarded as proving true the other case.  The fact that there is no perfect island is put forth by Gaunilo as showing that Anselm's argument for God's existence is flawed.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} Such objections are called overload objections: they do not claim to show where or how the argument goes wrong; they merely argue that, if it is unsound in one application, it is unsound in all others.&lt;ref&gt;"Philosophy of Religion." Gaunilo of MarmoutiersÂ Objection to AnselmÂs Argument. N.p., n.d. Web. 30 Sept. 2012. &lt;http://www.scandalon.co.uk/philosophy/gaunilo.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  Simply put, they are arguments that would overload the world with an indefinitely large number of things, like perfect islands.

==Criticisms==
Gaunilo's objection to the ontological argument has been criticised on several grounds. [[Reply to Gaunilo|Anselm's own reply]] was essentially that Gaunilo had missed his point: any ''other'' being's existence is derived from God's, unnecessary in itself, and nonamenable to his ontological argument which can only ever properly apply to the single greatest being of all beings. Indeed, while we can try and conceive of a perfect island, that island is yet greater if it creates other beings, whereupon it would no longer be an island as we can understand it. Similarly, [[Alvin Plantinga]] tendered a reply to Gaunilo's remonstrance by arguing that the concept of "''that than which nothing greater can be conceived''" is not applicable to an island, or any other object, in the special way that it is applicable to God.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}  Plantinga defends Anselm's proof by averring that it applies exclusively to Him. A [[necessary being]] is both existent and the greatest conceivable and greatest possible being.  Only God, as Anselm defines him, meets all of those criteria and can, therefore, be dubbed a necessary being.

Another criticism of Gaunilo's argument points out that, whereas God is that ''thing'' than which no greater can be conceived, Gaunilo's is that ''island'' than which no greater can be conceived.  Thus, while no island may exceed it in greatness, it is perfectly reasonable to suppose that some non-island could.  "''Consequently,''" wrote [[William L. Rowe]] in his summary of the polemic, "''if we follow Anselm's reasoning exactly, it does not appear that we can derive an absurdity from the supposition that the island than which none greater is possible does not exist.''"&lt;ref&gt;William L. Rowe: "The Ontological Argument" in Feinberg; Shafer-Landau: ''Reason &amp; Responsibility'', p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaunilo's refutation is also criticized on the grounds that it misinterprets the argument set forth by Anselm. Richard Campbell contends that the argument criticized by Gaunilo is incomplete because it represents only one of three stages of a larger argument, one that is not meant to be read as a proof for God but rather as the basis for the following chapter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rethinking Anselm's Arguments: A Vindication of his Proof of the Existence of God|last=Campbell|first=Richard|publisher=Brill|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parallels==
David and Marjorie Haight took a very similar tack with Anselm's proof attempt as did Gaunilo.  However, whereas Gaunilo changed the target noun of Anselm's proof, "God", to an alternate noun that he felt was more obviously absurd, a "Lost Island", the Haights inverted the adjective in Anselm's reasoning.  Where Anselm used the word "greater" to define god into existence, the Haights point out that the logic can be inverted by replacing "greater" with "worse".  The statement then follows to a conclusion that the very most bad thing has to be an existent bad thing, because it would be worse for this bad thing to exist than to not exist, therefore it must exist in its absolute badness.  Therefore, the Devil must also exist, so long as Anselm's proof is held as consequential.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Both Gaunilo and the Haights arguments point out that there may be other nouns, and other bivalent adjectives that when conceived as an Anselm proof (in an extreme that demands existence) could also be argued to necessitate their existence as well.  For example, with cold or heat: Surely an absolutely cold (or hot) being that exists in reality is more absolutely cold (or hot) than one that only exists in imagination.  Therefore, it must indeed exist in reality.  And so on.  The Haights show that the word "great" may not be the only adjective that pushes for existence when conceived in the extreme, just as the phrase "that God thing" may not be the only noun interacting with "great" in this way, as Gaunilo observed.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

==The remainder of Gaunilo's text==
Gaunilo's treatise is divided into eight sections. The first seven of these sections are criticisms of Anselm's argument from the point of view of a rational non-believer. The last section (8) is simply praise for the remaining chapters of the Proslogion. The full title of Gaunilo's treatise is: 'What Someone in Behalf of the Fool Replies to these Arguments'.&lt;ref&gt;Gaunilo's name does not appear in early manuscripts.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=July 2014}} This means Gaunilo does not write as a fellow Christian who believes, rather, he pretends to be a rational non-believer. The scholarly debate has focused on section 6 (the Lost Island Refutation). Very few scholars&lt;ref&gt;See Thomas Losoncy and recently Miroslav Imbrisevic&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=July 2014}} engage with the remaining sections of Gaunilo's text.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12569">'''Geovisualization''' or '''Geovisualisation''', short for ''Geographic Visualization'', refers to a set of tools and techniques supporting the analysis of [[geospatial data]] through the use of [[interactive visualization]].

Like the related fields of [[scientific visualization]]&lt;ref name= "ME97"&gt;MacEachren, A.M. and Kraak, M.J. 1997 Exploratory cartographic visualization: advancing the agenda. Computers &amp; Geosciences, 23(4), pp. 335-343.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[information visualization]] &lt;ref name= "Card99"&gt;[[Stuart K. Card]], Mackinlay, J.D., and Shneidermann, B. 1999. Reading in Information Visualization: Using Vision to Think. San Francisco: Morgan Kaumann Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;  geovisualization emphasizes knowledge construction over knowledge storage or information transmission.&lt;ref name= "ME97"/&gt; To do this, geovisualization communicates geospatial information in ways that, when combined with human understanding, allow for data exploration and decision-making processes.&lt;ref name= "ME97"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jiang2005"&gt;Jiang, B., and Li, Z. 2005. Editorial: Geovisualization: Design, Enhanced Visual Tools and Applications. The Cartographic Journal, 42(1), pp. 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "ME04"&gt;[[Alan MacEachren|MacEachren, A.M.]] 2004. Geovisualization for knowledge construction and decision support. IEEE computer graphics and applications, 24(1), pp.13-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional, static maps have a limited exploratory capability; the graphical representations are inextricably linked to the geographical information beneath. [[GIS]] and geovisualization allow for more interactive maps; including the ability to explore different layers of the map, to zoom in or out, and to change the visual appearance of the map, usually on a computer display.&lt;ref name= "Jiang03"&gt;Jiang, B., Huang, B., and Vasek, V. 2003. Geovisualisation for Planning Support Systems. In Planning Support Systems in Practice, Geertman, S., and Stillwell, J. (Eds.). Berlin: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; Geovisualization represents a set of cartographic technologies and practices that take advantage of the ability of modern microprocessors to render changes to a map in real time, allowing users to adjust the mapped data on the fly.&lt;ref name= "ME97"/&gt;

==History==
The term visualization is first mentioned in the cartographic literature at least as early as 1953, in an article by [[University of Chicago]] geographer Allen K. Philbrick. New developments in the field of computer science prompted the [[National Science Foundation]] to redefine the term in a 1987 report which placed visualization at the convergence of computer graphics, image processing, computer vision, computer-aided design, signal processing, and user interface studies &lt;ref&gt;McCormick, B.H., DeFanti, T.A., and Brown, M.D. (Eds.). 1987. Visualization in Scientific Computing. Computer Graphics, 21(6). p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; and emphasized both the knowledge creation and hypothesis generation aspects of scientific visualization.&lt;ref name= "ME97"/&gt;

Geovisualization developed as a field of research in the early 1980s, based largely on the work of French graphic theorist [[Jacques Bertin]].&lt;ref name= "ME04"/&gt; Bertin’s work on cartographic design and information visualization share with the National Science Foundation report a focus on the potential for the use of “dynamic visual displays as prompts for scientific insight and on the methods through which dynamic visual displays might leverage perceptual cognitive processes to facilitate scientific thinking”.&lt;ref name= "ME04"/&gt;

Geovisualization has continued to grow as a subject of practice and research. The [[International Cartographic Association]] (ICA) established a Commission on Visualization &amp; Virtual Environments in 1995.

==Related Fields==
Geovisualization is closely related to other visualization fields, such as [[scientific visualization]]&lt;ref name= "ME97"/&gt; and [[information visualization]].&lt;ref name= "Card99"/&gt; Owing to its roots in [[cartography]], geovisualization contributes to these other fields by way of the map metaphor, which “has been widely used to visualize non-geographic information in the domains of information visualization and [[domain knowledge]] visualization."&lt;ref name="Jiang2005"/&gt;  It is also related to [[UrbanSim|urban simulation]].

==Practical Applications==
Geovisualization has made inroads in a diverse set of real-world situations calling for the decision-making and knowledge creation processes it can provide. The following list provides a summary of some of these applications as they are discussed in the geovisualization literature.
E

=== Wildland fire fighting ===
Firefighters have been using sandbox environments to rapidly and physically model topography and fire for wildfire incident command strategic planning. The SimTable is a 3D interactive fire simulator, bringing sandtable exercises to life. The SimTable uses advanced computer simulations to model fires in any area, including local neighborhoods, utilizing actual slope, terrain, wind speed/direction, vegetation, and other factors. SimTable Models were used in Arizona's largest fire on record, the [[Wallow Fire]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kob.com/article/stories/S2149915.shtml?cat=0&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Forestry ===
Geovisualizers, working with European foresters, used CommonGIS and Visualization Toolkit ([[VTK]]) to visualize a large set of spatio-temporal data related to European forests, allowing the data to be explored by non-experts over the Internet. The report summarizing this effort “uncovers a range of fundamental issues relevant to the broad field of geovisualization and information visualization research”.&lt;ref name= "GA07"&gt;Andrienko, G., Andrienko, N., Jankowski, P, Keim, D., Kraak, M.-J., MacEachren, A.M., and Wrobel, S. 2007. Geovisual analytics for spatial decision support: Setting the research agenda. International Journal of Geographical Information Science, 21(8), pp. 839-857.&lt;/ref&gt;

The research team cited the two major problems as the inability of the geovisualizers to convince the foresters of the efficacy of geovisualization in their work and the foresters’ misgivings over the dataset’s accessibility to non-experts engaging in “uncontrolled exploration”. While the geovisualizers focused on the ability of geovisualization to aid in knowledge construction, the foresters preferred the information-communication role of more traditional forms of cartographic representation.&lt;ref name= "GA07"/&gt;

===Archaeology===
Geovisualization provides archaeologists with a potential technique for mapping unearthed archaeological environments  as well as for accessing and exploring archaeological data in three dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;Watters, M. 2005. Geovisualization: an Example from the Catholme Ceremonial Complex. Archaeological Prospection, 13, pp. 282-290.&lt;/ref&gt;

The implications of geovisualization for archaeology are not limited to advances in archaeological theory and exploration but also include the development of new, collaborative relationships between archaeologists and computer scientists.&lt;ref&gt;Watters, M. 2005. Review of Exploring Geovisualization , Dykes, J., MacEachren, A.M., and Kraak, M.J. (Eds.). Amsterdam: Elsevier Science, 2004. In Archaeological Prospection, 12, pp. 265-266.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental Studies===
Geovisualization tools provide multiple stakeholders with the ability to make balanced environmental decisions by taking into account “the complex interacting factors that should be taken into account when studying environmental changes".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gasco|first=Luis|last2=Asensio|first2=Cesar|last3=de Arcas|first3=Guillermo|date=2017-05-15|title=Communicating airport noise emission data to the general public|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969717303042|journal=Science of the Total Environment|volume=586|pages=836–848|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.02.063}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geovisualization users can use a [[georeference]]d model to explore a complex set of environmental data, interrogating a number of scenarios or policy options to determine a best fit.&lt;ref&gt;Danada, J., Dias, E., Romao, T., Correia, N., Trabuco, A., Santos, C., Serpa, J., Costa, M., Camara, A. 2005. Mobile Environmental Visualization. The Cartographic Journal, 42(1), pp. 61-68.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Urban Planning===
Both planners and the general public can use geovisualization to explore real-world environments and model ‘what if’ scenarios based on spatio-temporal data. While geovisualization in the preceding fields may be divided into two separate domains—the private domain, in which professionals use geovisualization to explore data and generate hypotheses, and the public domain, in which these professionals present their “visual thinking” to the general public&lt;ref name= "Jiang03"/&gt;—planning relies more heavily than many other fields on collaboration between the general public and professionals.

Planners use geovisualization as a tool for modeling the environmental interests and policy concerns of the general public. Jiang et al.&lt;ref name= "Jiang03"/&gt; mention two examples, in which “3D photorealistic representations are used to show urban redevelopment [and] dynamic computer simulations are used to show possible pollution diffusion over the next few years.” The widespread use of the Internet by the general public has implications for these collaborative planning efforts, leading to increased participation by the public while decreasing the amount of time it takes to debate more controversial planning decisions.&lt;ref name= "Jiang03"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9991">'''The Global Environment &amp; Trade Study (GETS)''' was a non-profit research institute established in 1994 to study the complex linkages between international trade and environmental sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;Global Environment &amp; Trade Study, ''1995–1996 Biennial Report'', p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  GETS supported numerous research projects on the legal, economic, and ecological aspects of trade and environment.

GETS was centered at [[Yale University]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yale.edu/envirocenter/research_completed.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

GETS also studied the expanding role of civil society in [[global governance]].

In 2004, the GETS Board decided that a sufficient amount had been accomplished over the decade, and that it was time to terminate the project.

==Major Accomplishments==
GETS had four major accomplishments:  
* First, GETS helped to raise the consciousness of international institutions and governments about the importance of the trade-environment linkage and about the need for better analytical underpinnings of intergovernmental decisionmaking.  GETS was pleased in 2001 when environment was incorporated as a specific goal of the [[World Trade Organization]] Doha negotiating round.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/envir_e/envir_negotiations_e.htm WTO | Environment - Negotiations on trade and environment&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Second, GETS advocated greater transparency at the WTO in documentation and called for opportunities for [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs) to submit amicus curiae briefs.  GETS was happy to see the WTO agree to release more documentation and to see the Appellate Body permit [[amicus briefs]] in the United States – Shrimp case.&lt;ref&gt;David Palmeter &amp; Petros C. Mavroidis, ''Dispute Settlement in the World Trade Organization'', Cambridge U. Press, 2d ed. 2004, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Third, GETS called for a more environment-friendly interpretation of trade rules, particularly regarding environmental measures being reviewed under Article XX of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT). The Appellate Body did so in several landmark WTO cases.&lt;ref&gt;John H. Jackson, "Justice Feliciano and the WTO Environmental Cases: Laying the Foundations of a 'Constitutional Jurisprudence' with Implications for Developing Countries," in Steve Charnovitz, Debra P. Steger &amp; Peter van den Bossche, ''Law in the Service of Human Dignity'', Cambridge U. Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fourth, GETS called for the inclusion of an environmental dimension in emerging bilateral and regional free trade agreements, especially in Latin America.  Progress continues to be made in doing so.

==Board Members and Staff==
The founders of GETS were:  James Cameron, [[Steve Charnovitz]], [[Daniel C. Esty|Daniel Esty]], and [[Mark Ritchie]].&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/&gt;1995–86 Biennial Report, ibid, pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* James Cameron brought his years of experience at building environmental law institutions and led the GETS work on climate change, the interplay of international tribunals, and the precautionary principle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reeep.org/index.cfm?articleid=37&amp;iid=906 Home - REEEP - The Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnership&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Steve Charnovitz]] brought his years of experience in the international trade policy arena and was the overall project director.
* [[Daniel C. Esty|Daniel Esty]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.yale.edu/faculty/estypublications.htm Yale Law School | Faculty | Publications&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; brought his years of experience as a U.S. environmental regulator and led the GETS work on data-generated policymaking, optimal environmental governance, and environmental policy in China.
* [[Mark Ritchie]] brought his years of experience in NGO networking and agricultural policy, and led the GETS work on agriculture, social development, and public communications.

In 2000, Monica Araya [http://www.monica-araya.com] joined the GETS Board and focused on environment, trade and investment issues in developing countries.

Some staff associated with GETS included Orin Kirshner, who served as Executive Director from 2001–2003, Beatrice Chaytor, Hari Osofsky, and John Wickham.

==Institutional Participation and Collaboration==
GETS had three major participating institutions—the Foundation for International Environmental Law and Development (located in London),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.field.org.uk/ Foundation for International Environmental Law and Development&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy (located in Minneapolis),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iatp.org/ Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 
and the [[Yale Center for Environmental Law and Policy|Yale Center for Environmental Law &amp; Policy]] (located in New Haven)
.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/envirocenter/ Untitled Document&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, GETS collaborated with numerous research institutes in developed and developing countries.

==Conferences==
GETS held policy conferences or workshops in Cancun, Geneva, London, Miami, New York, Seattle, Tokyo, and Washington.

GETS also held a major Conference in Singapore in June 1996 co-sponsored with the [[National University of Singapore]]. At the end of that Conference, the co-chairs ([[Tommy Koh]], Dan Esty, and James Cameron) issued a statement with several recommendations,&lt;ref&gt;'' 1995–96 Biennial Report'', ibid., pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; many of which were adopted by the WTO, other international organizations, and governments in subsequent years.

==Funding==
The major funders of GETS included: the Ford Foundation, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Netherlands Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment, the German-Marshall Fund, the John D. &amp; Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the Center for Global Partnership/Japan Foundation, the Pew Charitable Trusts, and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund.

Retrieved 2010-08-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Music writer Mickey Hess expands the term as follows: "a hype man is a figure who plays a central but supporting role within a group, making his own interventions, generally aimed at hyping up the crowd while also drawing attention to the words of the [[Master_of_ceremonies#Hip_hop|MC]]".&lt;ref name=IconsofHipHop&gt;Hess, Mickey, 2007, ''Icons of Hip Hop: An Encyclopedia of the Movement, Music, and Culture'', Greenwood Publishing Group, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussing the role of the hype man in the book ''[[How to Rap]]'', [[Royce da 5'9"]] describes how a hype man can contribute to a live performance: "a lot of my verses [can] be so constant with the flow [that] I'd need somebody to help me."&lt;ref name="autogenerated304"&gt;Edwards, Paul, 2009, ''[[How to Rap]]: The Art &amp; Science of the Hip-Hop MC'', Chicago Review Press, p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lateef the Truthspeaker|Lateef]] has stated, "You're gonna have to have somebody say something somewhere to give you a breath... usually it's just a matter of getting somebody to hit some line or some word in a line—that's all you really need."&lt;ref name="autogenerated304"/&gt;

==Origins==
Early [[hip hop]] hype men included Cowboy and Creole of [[Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five]].&lt;ref name= Hilltop/&gt;&lt;ref name=IconsofHipHop/&gt; [[Kool Moe Dee]] calls Creole “the original hype man”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thafoundation.com/moedee.htm |title=Kool Moe Dee |publisher=Thafoundation.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Public Enemy 4.jpg|thumb|right|American rapper [[Flavor Flav]] hyping up a crowd in May 2008]]
The quintessential hype man, for many fans and musicians of the era, was [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]]'s hype man [[Flavor Flav]], whose exuberant approach to the art in the group's recordings and videos made him, arguably, the first household-name hype man, a figure more famous than many MCs. He established many of the conventions of the craft, such as an outlandish sense of style (epitomized by his wearing of large clocks around his neck) and a vocal style that contrasted dramatically with that of the MC (his rasping high voice was a counterpoint to [[Chuck D]]'s booming baritone).
[[File:Hype-Man Relione with Chef Sean .jpg|thumb|right|Hype man Relione (right) performing with rapper Chef Sean]]
[[Jay-Z]] began his career as a hype man for [[Jaz-O]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsroom.mtv.com/2009/08/26/jay-z-record-executives/ |title=Record Executives Thought Jay-Z Was No Good » MTV Newsroom |publisher=Newsroom.mtv.com |date=2009-08-26 |accessdate=2010-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vibe magazine, Jan 2004, Vol. 12, No. 1, published by Vibe Media Group, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; and was later the hype man for [[Big Daddy Kane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jonathan Cunningham |url=http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/2007-03-15/music/kane-s-domain |title=Kane's Domain - Page 1 - Music - Broward/Palm Beach - Broward-Palm Beach New Times |publisher=Broward/Palm Beach |date=2007-03-15 |accessdate=2010-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==&lt;!-- DO NOT ADD MORE WITHOUT RELIABLE CITATIONS --&gt;

Examples of hype men include [[Freaky Tah]] of the [[The Lost Boyz|Lost Boyz]], [[Memphis Bleek]] for [[Jay-Z]], and [[Proof (rapper)|Proof]] and [[Mr. Porter]] of [[D12]] for [[Eminem]].&lt;ref name="IconsofHipHop" /&gt; ''Icons of Hip Hop'' also notes that some producers, such as [[Sean Combs|Diddy]], [[Lil Jon]], [[Swizz Beatz]], and [[Jermaine Dupri]], "have transitioned from a hype man role to become [[rapper]]s and stars in their own right".&lt;ref name="IconsofHipHop" /&gt;

Occasionally pop groups include a member up front alongside the lead singer who may perform backup vocals or percussion but largely functions to excite the audience through dancing and/or stage patter. Examples include [[Bob Nastanovich]] for [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grantland.com/features/indie-rock-legend-bob-nastanovich-pavement-silver-jews-horse-racing/|title='It Hasn't Been a Disaster: Indie-rock legend Bob Nastanovich on Pavement, the Silver Jews, and horse racing.

The '''Idiap Research Institute''' is a semi-private non-profit [[research institute]] at [[Martigny]] in the [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]] of [[Valais]], in south-western Switzerland. It conducts research in the areas of [[speech processing]], [[computer vision]], [[information retrieval]], [[Biometrics|biometric authentication]], [[multimodal interaction]] and [[machine learning]]. The institute is affiliated with the [[École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne]] (EPFL), and with the [[Université de Genève]].&lt;ref name=esv&gt;[http://esv2000.edi.admin.ch/f/entry.asp?Id=2048 Fondation de l'Institut de Recherche Idiap (Foundation of the Idiap Research Institute)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913145657/http://esv2000.edi.admin.ch/f/entry.asp?Id=2048 |date=13 September 2014 }} (in French).

==History==

The institute was founded as the Istituto Dalle Molle di Intelligenza Artificiale Percettiva ({{lang-fr|{{noitalic|Institut Dalle Molle d'intelligence artificielle perceptive}}}}) in 1991 by the Italian entrepreneur [[Angelo Dalle Molle]] through the [[Fondation Dalle Molle]], in collaboration with the [[École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne]] and with local, cantonal and federal government bodies. Its purpose was to investigate the application of [[artificial intelligence]] to human perception in general, and to recognition and analysis of patterns in particular. In 1996, with the participation of the town of [[Martigny]], the [[canton of Valais]], the EPFL, the [[University of Geneva]] and [[Swisscom]], it became a research foundation independent of the Dalle Molle foundation, and shortly after changed its name to Idiap Research Institute.&lt;ref name=fond3&gt;[http://www.dallemolle.ch/en/the-institutes/idiap-research-institute Research Institute Idiap, Martigny]. Fondation Dalle Molle. Accessed September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Idiap is one of the four Swiss research organisations founded by the Dalle Molle foundation, of which three are in the field of artificial intelligence.

The '''Institute of Promotional Marketing''' is a [[marketing]] organization in the [[United Kingdom]].

Originally set up in 1933 as the British Sales Promotion Association, it was known by various names until it was awarded Institute status in 1979 as the Institute of Sales Promotion. In the UK, "[[Institute]]" is a legally protected term which is only granted to organisations that can demonstrate achievement in areas such as education, development and research.

The organisation continued to be known as the ISP until June 2010, when it changed to the Institute of Promotional Marketing.

The IPM provides professional diplomas and certificates, best-practice guidelines and legal and copy clearance advice for the promotional marketing industry in the UK. It also represents the interests of promotional marketing practitioners with regulators, government officials and politicians, both in the UK and in the European Union.

The decision to change the organisation's name from the Institute of Sales Promotion to the Institute of Promotional Marketing was the result of many years' debate. It was eventually decided that the term "sales promotion" was restrictive, because, strictly speaking, it refers to a relatively small number of techniques traditionally used only with the retail environment. While Institute members may still run some promotions that use these sales promotions techniques, the majority of the work they do involves other promotional marketing techniques.

In [[applied mathematics]], '''lambda-connectedness ''' (or '''&amp;lambda;-connectedness''') deals with partial connectivity for a [[discrete space]].

Assume that a function on a discrete space (usually a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]) is given. A degree of connectivity (connectedness) will be defined to measure the connectedness of the space with respect to the function. It was invented to create a new method for image [[Segmentation (image processing)|segmentation]]. The method has expanded to handle other problems related to uncertainty for incomplete information analysis.  
&lt;ref name="lambda-connectedness"&gt;L. Chen, O. Adjei, D. Cooley, lambda-connectedness: Method and Applications, Proc. IEEE Conf on System, Man and Cybernetics 2000, pp 1157–1562, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lambda-connectedness1"&gt;L. Chen, O. Adjei, lambda-connectedness and its applications, Journal of Scientific and Practical Computing
Vol.3, No.1 (2009) 19–52 .&lt;/ref&gt;

For a digital image and a certain value of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, two pixels are called &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;-connected if there is a path linking those two pixels and the connectedness of this path is at least &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.  &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;-connectedness is an equivalence relation.&lt;ref name="fuzzy subfiber"&gt;L. Chen, H.D. Cheng, and J. Zhang, Fuzzy subfiber and its application to seismic lithology classification, Information Sciences: Applications, Vol 1, No 2, pp 77–95, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Connectedness is a basic measure in many areas of mathematical science and social sciences. In graph theory, two vertices are said to be connected if there is a path between them. In [[topology]], two points are connected if there is a continuous
function that could move from one point to another continuously. In management science, for example, in an institution,
two individuals are connected if one person is under the supervision of the other. Such connected relations only describe either full connection or no connection. lambda-connectedness is introduced to measure incomplete or fuzzy relations between two vertices, points, human beings, etc.

In fact, partial relations have been studied in other aspects. [[Random graph]] theory allows one to assign a [[probability]] to each edge of a graph. This method assumes, in most cases, each edge has the same probability. On the other hand, [[Bayesian networks]] are often used for inference and analysis when relationships between each pair of states/events, denoted by vertices, are known. These relationships are usually represented by conditional probabilities
among these vertices and are usually obtained from outside of the system.

&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;-connectedness is based on graph theory; however, graph theory only deals with vertices and edges with or without weights. In order to define a partial, incomplete, or fuzzy connectedness, one needs to assign a function on the vertex in the graph. Such a function is called a potential function. It can be used to represent the intensity of an image, the surface of a ''XY''-domain, or the utility function of a management or economic network.

==Basic concepts==

A generalized definition of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;-connectedness can be described as follows: a simple system &lt;math&gt;\langle G,\rho\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is called a potential function of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\langle G,\rho\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is an image, then &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a 2D or 2D grid space and &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is an intensity function. For a color image, one can use &lt;math&gt;f=(\text{red},\text{green},\text{blue})&lt;/math&gt; to represent &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;.
 
A neighbor connectivity will be first defined on a pair of adjacent points. Then one can define the general connectedness for any two points.

Assume &lt;math&gt;\alpha_\rho(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; is used to measure the neighbor-connectivity of x,y where x and y are adjacent.
In graph ''G''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''V'',&amp;nbsp;''E''), a finite sequence &lt;math&gt;x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n&lt;/math&gt; is called a path, if &lt;math&gt;(x_i,x_{i+1})\in E&lt;/math&gt;.

The path-connectivity &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; of a path &lt;math&gt;\pi=\pi(x_1,x_n)=\{x_1,x_2,...,x_n\}&lt;/math&gt;
is defined as
 
: &lt;math&gt; \beta_\rho(\pi(x_1,x_n)) =  \min \{ \alpha_{\rho}(x_i,x_{i+1}) | i=1,\ldots,n-1 \} &lt;/math&gt;
 
Finally,  the degree of connectedness (connectivity) of two vertices x,y with respect to &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is defined as
 
: &lt;math&gt; C_\rho(x,y) = \max \{ \beta(\pi(x,y)) | \pi \text { is a (simple) path}. \}&lt;/math&gt;
 
For a given &lt;math&gt;\lambda \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt;, point &lt;math&gt;p=(x,\rho(x))&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q=(y,\rho(y))&lt;/math&gt; are said to be &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;-connected if &lt;math&gt;C_{\rho}(x,y)\ge \lambda&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;-connectedness is a equivalence relation. It can be used in image segmentation.

'''Lyndon State College,''' a [[Public university|public]] [[liberal arts]] college located at [[Lyndon, Vermont|Lyndon Center]] in [[Lyndon, Vermont|Lyndon]], [[Caledonia County, Vermont|Caledonia County]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Vermont]], is now the Lyndon campus of Northern Vermont University.  In addition to a range of [[Bachelor's Degree]] programs, the college offered [[Master's Degree]] programs in Clinical Mental Health Counseling, Education, and Liberal Arts. Lyndon State College was accredited by the [[New England Association of Schools and Colleges]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gateway.lsc.vsc.edu/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100607091729/http://gateway.lsc.vsc.edu/ |archivedate=2010-06-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 1, 2018, [[Johnson State College]] and Lyndon State College formally merged, creating [[Northern Vermont University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsc.edu/who-we-are/northern-vermont-university|title=Northern Vermont University - Johnson - Johnson State College|website=www.jsc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1911, the college was founded as a one-year normal school housed in rented space in nearby [[Lyndon Institute]]. The term "[[normal school]]" is based on the French ''école normale supérieure'', a school to educate teachers. Consistent with education tradition of the times, the Lyndon Training Course expanded its curriculum in one-year increments, and the first two-year class graduated in 1923. In 1927, Rita Bole became principal of the school. The first three-year class, consisting of nine students, graduated in 1934. In 1944, the state allowed Lyndon to grant four-year degrees so long as it remained a teacher training institution. The first four-year degrees were granted to 18 students in 1944. It was during these years that the [[Northeast Kingdom]] began to depend on Lyndon to address the educational needs of its residents.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Bole, who led the school until 1955, encouraged the Vermont State Legislature to establish Lyndon Teachers College, saw the admission of the first male and first out-of-state students during the 1940s, and oversaw the move to the [[Theodore Newton Vail]] estate. Vail had been instrumental in the establishment of Lyndon Institute, and Bole recognized his vacant estate as the perfect place to house the growing school. The move to Vail Manor was completed on June 30, 1951, the final day of the school's lease at Lyndon Institute.

In 1961, the State Legislature established the [[Vermont State Colleges]] system, a consortium of Vermont's five public colleges governed by a common board of trustees, chancellor and [[Council of Presidents]] and Lyndon Teachers College became Lyndon State College. This marked the beginning of a period of rapid growth and, in 1964, the campus began to expand. A library, a dormitory, a dining hall, a science wing, a gymnasium, and a theater were built. These additions began meeting the needs of a growing student population that also brought a rapid expansion of the Lyndon curriculum.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} In the 1970s, new majors were developed in business administration, special education, recreations, meteorology, communications, human services, and physical education. It was also during this decade that the original Vail Manor was deemed unsafe and was replaced with the Theodore N. Vail Center that now houses the Vail Museum and preserves the name that has become an integral part of the Lyndon State tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Lyndon State College Undergraduate Catalog, 2007-2008, p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, a new residence hall was constructed near Wheelock Hall. The building was named The Rita L. Bole Complex, after the principal of Lyndon Normal School.

In 2009, the Academic and Student Activity Center, a [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]]-certified, or "green" building, was constructed to house Lyndon's Business, Exercise Science and Meteorology majors. It also contains computer labs, classrooms and a student event center.

In September 2016, the VSC board of trustees voted to merge Lyndon State College with [[Johnson State College]], located roughly 50 miles away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sevendaysvt.com/vermont/shotgun-marriage-johnson-and-lyndon-state-colleges-rush-to-the-altar/Content?oid=3669084|title=Shotgun Marriage?

==Campus==

The Vail Center has classrooms, and teachers' offices, especially English, mathematics, and education. It also contains the bookstore, student center, and snack bar. The science wing contains classrooms and laboratories. There is a television wing for the television studies and is home to News 7, LSC's daily live broadcast facility. It also contains the small [[Alexander Twilight]] Theater. It is connected to the Library and Academic Center (LAC).

LAC contains classrooms, a 24-hour computer lab, and the three-floor [[Samuel Read Hall Library]].

The Harvey Academic Center is located at the center of campus, and houses offices and classrooms for Recreation Studies, as well as for other classes.

The center of campus is around the fountain, which sprays into a small pond. There is a larger pond across from the library. Adjacent to the fountain is Stevens Dining Hall.

Adjacent to the theater is the Stannard Gymnasium. The smaller gym, known as the Rita Bole Gymnasium (There is also a Rita Bole residence hall.) is used for basketball games, floor hockey, and a wide variety of intramural sports. In this complex is a {{convert|25|m}} swimming pool, racquetball court, rock climbing wall and a fitness center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://community.lyndonstate.edu/Athletics/Facilities/tabid/730/Default.aspx Lyndon State College Hornets: Facilities]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the north side of the campus, across from the baseball fields is the Brown House containing a dispensary. The Gray House is a special residential opportunity, currently for those performing service to the community.

No smoking is allowed on campus, except for in nearby parking lots.

&lt;!---because of name change, some of this stuff may need to be moved---&gt;
Half of the student population lives on campus in one of the nine residence halls. The Stonehenge residence hall complex is located on the southern end of campus, and consists of six residence halls: Whitelaw/Crevecoeur (first-year students), Arnold/Bayley, and Poland/Rogers. They are clustered around a central courtyard and shaped in a circle, hence the nickname "Stonehenge." Wheelock is a residence hall that is located in the center of campus. Rita Bole is the newest of the residence halls, which features apartment-style living for upperclassmen, as well as accessible. The ninth hall, Grey House, is a living-learning community dedicated to performing community service on campus and in the local area.

The '''Mittag-Leffler Institute''' is a [[mathematics|mathematical]] research institute located in [[Djursholm]], a suburb of [[Stockholm]]. It invites scholars to participate in year-long or half-year programs in specialized mathematical subjects. The Institute is run by the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] on behalf of research societies representing all the [[Scandinavia]]n countries.

The Institute's main building was originally the residence of [[Magnus Gustaf (Gösta) Mittag-Leffler]], who donated it along with his extensive mathematics library. At his death in 1927, however, Mittag-Leffler's fortune was insufficient to set up an active research institute, which began operation only in 1969 under the leadership of [[Lennart Carleson]].

The journals [[Acta Mathematica]] and [[Arkiv för Matematik]] are published by the institute. For a number of years at the beginning of the 20th century, Mittag's villa hosted a celebratory dinner for [[Nobel Prize]] laureates.

==Notable visitors==

Each year the institute invites the best mathematician in their fields to work on specific mathematical themes. Some notable past visitors include:

[[Louis Billera]], [[Sy Friedman]], [[John B. Garnett]], [[Roger Heath-Brown]], [[Sigurður Helgason (mathematician)|Sigurður Helgason]], [[Helge Holden]], [[Harry Kesten]], [[Donald Knuth]], [[George Lusztig]], [[Paul Malliavin]], [[Benoit Mandelbrot]], [[Lynn Steen]], [[André Weil]], [[Jean-Christophe Yoccoz]], [[Günter M.

The '''Museum Of Bad Art''' ('''MOBA''') is a privately owned museum whose stated aim is "to celebrate the labor of artists whose work would be displayed and appreciated in no other forum".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Frank|Sacco|2008|p=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally in [[Dedham, Massachusetts|Dedham]] with current branches in [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]], [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]], and [[Weymouth, Massachusetts|South Weymouth]] in [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=Lowbrow&gt;{{cite news |author=Piepenburg, Erik |title=Loving the Lowbrow (It Has Its Own Hall of Fame) |agency= |work=[[The New York Times]] |pages= |page= |date=September 22, 2010|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/03/arts/design/03badart.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its permanent collection includes over 700&amp;nbsp;pieces of "art too bad to be ignored", 25 to 35 of which are on public display at any one time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Walkup, Nancy |title=ArtEd Online&amp;nbsp;— [[National Art Education Association|NAEA]] in Boston&amp;nbsp;— Reproducible Handout |journal=School Arts |volume=104 |issue=7 |pages=36 |date=March 2005 |issn=0036-6463 |oclc=1765119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MOBA was founded in 1994, after antique dealer Scott Wilson showed a painting he had recovered from the trash to some friends, who suggested starting a collection. Within a year, receptions held in Wilson's friends' home were so well-attended that the collection needed its own viewing space. The museum then moved to the basement of a theater in Dedham. Explaining the reasoning behind the museum's establishment, co-founder Jerry Reilly said in 1995: "While every city in the world has at least one museum dedicated to the best of art, MOBA is the only museum dedicated to collecting and exhibiting the worst."&lt;ref name=Mutch&gt;{{cite news |author=Mutch, David |title=Art from the Bottom of the Heap: A 'Museum' Devoted to Bad Painting |agency= |work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |pages= |page=13 |date=November 2, 1995 |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1995/1102/02131.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To be included in MOBA's collection, works must be original and have serious intent, but they must also have significant flaws without being boring; curators are not interested in displaying deliberate [[kitsch]].

MOBA has been mentioned in dozens of off-the-beaten-path guides to [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], featured in international newspapers and magazines, and has inspired several other collections throughout the world that set out to rival its own visual atrocities. [[Deborah Solomon]] of ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' noted that the attention the Museum Of Bad Art receives is part of a wider trend of museums displaying "the best bad art".&lt;ref name="solomon"&gt;Solomon, Deborah. "[https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/24/magazine/in-praise-of-bad-art.html In Praise of Bad Art]". ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 24, 1999 &lt;!--Retrieved on March 2, 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The museum has been criticized for being anti-art, but the founders deny this, responding that its collection is a tribute to the sincerity of the artists who persevered with their art despite something going horribly wrong in the process. According to co-founder Marie Jackson, "We are here to celebrate an artist's right to fail, gloriously."&lt;ref name="irishtimes"&gt;"[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/features/1999/0918/99091800051.html The Gallery of the Garish Masterpieces of Bad Art]". ''[[The Irish Times]]'', September 18, 1999. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Museum Of Bad Art was established in 1994 by antique dealer Scott Wilson, who discovered what has become the museum's signature piece—''Lucy in the Field with Flowers''—protruding from between two trash cans on a [[Roslindale, Massachusetts|Roslindale]]-area curb in Boston, among some garbage waiting to be collected. Wilson was initially interested only in the frame, but when he showed the picture to his friend Jerry Reilly, Reilly wanted both the frame and the painting. He exhibited ''Lucy'' in his home, and encouraged friends to look for other bad art and notify Wilson of what they found.&lt;ref name="gaines"&gt;Gaines, Judith. [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-7775472.html "Exhibiting Works of Trial and Error: Museum Finds Landscapes Gone Awry"]. ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', May 4, 2003. 9&lt;/ref&gt; When Wilson acquired another "equally lovely" piece and shared it with Reilly, they decided to start a collection. Reilly and his wife, Marie Jackson, held a party in their basement to exhibit the collection to date, and hosted a reception they facetiously titled "The Opening of the Museum Of Bad Art".&lt;ref name="english07"&gt;English, Bella. [http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2007/04/29/high_standards_for_low_art/?rss_id=Boston%20Globe%20--%20Globe%20South "High Standards for Low Art"]. ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', April 29, 2007. Reg7&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:MOBA-MensroomEntrance.JPG|thumb|''2:14'' by Kafka Liz (2009). The original stairwell entrance to the Museum of Bad Art and the men's restroom]]
Regular showings of the pieces collected by Wilson, Reilly, and Jackson (and those donated by others), became too much for Reilly and Jackson's small home in [[West Roxbury, Massachusetts]], as hundreds of people attended the receptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Frauenfelder, Mark |title=Canvas Catastrophes |date=July 1995 |work= |publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired Magazine]] |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/3.07/scans.html?pg=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founders' initial attempt at dealing with their constrained exhibition space was to create the Virtual Museum Of Bad Art, a CD-ROM with a cast of 95 people that presented the MOBA art collection in a fictional imaginary museum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cool.conservation-us.org/waac/wn/wn18/wn18-1/wn18-113.html MOBS CD-ROM]&lt;/ref&gt;  This fictional MOBA allowed the visitors not only to view the paintings but to go behind the scenes in the fictional museum.

Word of the museum's collection continued to spread until, according to "Permanent Interim Acting Director" Louise Reilly Sacco, "it got completely out of hand" when a group of senior citizens on a tour bus stopped to see it.&lt;ref name="gaines"/&gt; In 1995 the display space was moved to the basement of the Dedham Community Theatre, a building with an aesthetic described in 2004 as "ramshackle".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Citro|Foulds|2004|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum in Dedham had no fixed operating hours, instead being open while the theater upstairs was open.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foodandwine.com/thingtodo/museum/museum-of-bad-art Museum of Bad Art] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130102163708/http://www.foodandwine.com/thingtodo/museum/museum-of-bad-art |date=2013-01-02 }}". ''[[Food &amp; Wine Magazine]]'', October 2008 &lt;!--Retrieved on March 3, 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; As ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' notes, the art collection was appropriately placed "just outside the men's room",&lt;ref name="english"&gt;English, Bella. "[http://www.boston.com/yourtown/newton/articles/2009/02/08/doing_a_good_deed_with_bad_art/ Doing a Good Deed with Bad Art]". ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', February 8, 2009. Reg1&lt;/ref&gt; where sounds and smells carry to the collection and the constant flushing of the toilet "supposedly helps maintain a uniform humidity", according to the ''[[South China Morning Post]]''.&lt;ref name="wilson"&gt;Wilson, David, "It May Be Art, But They Sure Ain't No Oil Paintings". ''[[South China Morning Post]]'', May 17, 2004. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

In MOBA's early days, the museum hosted traveling shows; on one occasion the works were hung from trees in the woods on [[Cape Cod]] for the "Art Goes Out the Window—The Gallery in the Woods". [[Aesthetics of music#Bad music|Bad music]] was played during the public viewings to complete the ambiance. In an exhibition titled "Awash in Bad Art", 18 pieces of art were covered in shrink wrap for "the world's first drive-thru museum and car wash". Marie Jackson, formerly the Director of Aesthetic Interpretation noted, "We didn't put any watercolors in there."&lt;ref name="irishtimes"/&gt; A 2001 exhibition, "Buck Naked—Nothing But Nudes" featured all of the MOBA nudes hung in a local spa.

MOBA features its works in rotating collections. In 2003, "Freaks of Nature" focused on landscape artwork "gone awry". A 2006 exhibit titled "Hackneyed Portraits" was designed to "pick up some of the slack" when the [[David Hockney]] show at Boston's [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]] closed.&lt;ref name="johnson"&gt;Johnson, Carolyn. [http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2006/06/25/dedham_museum_is_proud_home_to_unforgettable_art_thats_anything_but_fine/ "So Bad It's Good: Dedham Museum Is Proud Home to Unforgettable Art That's Anything But Fine"]. ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', June 25, 2006. 1&lt;/ref&gt; MOBA unveiled its show "Nature Abhors a Vacuum and All Other Housework" in 2006; this format continues on the museum's website.

A second gallery opened in 2008 at the [[Somerville Theatre]] in [[Davis Square]], [[Somerville, Massachusetts]], where the collection was placed near both the women's and men's restrooms.&lt;ref&gt;Smykus, Ed. "[http://www.wickedlocal.com/somerville/archive/x1658008848 Museum of Bad Art Will Open Second Branch at the Somerville Theater"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120917195129/http://www.wickedlocal.com/somerville/archive/x1658008848 |date=2012-09-17 }}.

In February 2009, MOBA announced a fundraiser to assist the [[Rose Art Museum]] at [[Brandeis University]], which was seriously considering whether to sell masterpieces because of the [[global financial crisis of 2008–2009]], made worse for the university by some of its donors losing money in [[Madoff investment scandal|Bernard Madoff's investment scheme]]. Current MOBA curator and [[Balloon modelling|balloon artist]]/musician Michael Frank placed ''Studies in Digestion''—a four-panel piece showing four renditions of the human digestive tract in various media by artist Deborah Grumet—on [[eBay]] for a buy-it-now price of $10,000; the first bid was $24.99.&lt;ref name="english"/&gt; It eventually sold for $152.53 and the meager proceeds went to the Rose Art Museum, while both museums gained publicity.&lt;ref&gt;Bolton, Morgan  Michele.

''[[The Boston Globe]]'', February 15, 2009 &lt;!--Retrieved March 4, 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the museum opened a third location in the offices of the Brookline Interactive Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brookline Gallery|url=http://www.museumofbadart.org/about/brookline.php|website=Museum of Bad Art|publisher=Museum of Bad Art|accessdate=19 January 2016|ref=MOBA Brookline|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203172708/http://www.museumofbadart.org/about/brookline.php|archivedate=3 February 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012, the branch at the Dedham Community Theater closed to convert the space into a screening room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Museum of Bad Art (Gone)|url=http://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/12264|website=Roadside America|accessdate=19 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another branch has since opened at the New England Wildlife Center in [[South Weymouth, Massachusetts|South Weymouth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New England Wildlife Center Gallery|url=http://www.museumofbadart.org/about/newc.php|website=Museum of Bad Art|publisher=Museum of Bad Art|accessdate=19 January 2016|ref=MOBA South Weymouth|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116054437/http://www.museumofbadart.org/about/newc.php|archivedate=16 January 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thefts===

The loss of two MOBA works to theft has drawn media attention and enhanced the museum's stature.&lt;ref name="irishtimes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wulff, Julie "All Things Bad and Beautiful". ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', December 13, 2006. SID2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cobb" /&gt; In 1996, the painting ''Eileen'', by R. Angelo Le, vanished from MOBA.  ''Eileen'' was acquired from the trash by Wilson, and features a rip in the canvas where someone slashed it with a knife even before the museum acquired it, "adding an additional element of drama to an already powerful work", according to MOBA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumofbadart.org/collection/portraiture-9.html Portraiture #9 Eileen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150224234034/http://www.museumofbadart.org/collection/portraiture-9.html |date=2015-02-24 }}. Museum of Bad Art, 2009. Retrieved on March 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum offered a reward of $6.50 for the return of ''Eileen'', and although MOBA donors later increased that reward to $36.73, the work remained unrecovered for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Belanger|Moran|Sceurman|2008|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Boston Police Department|Boston Police]] listed the crime as "larceny, other",&lt;ref name="irishtimes"/&gt; and Sacco was reported saying she was unable to establish a link between the disappearance of ''Eileen'' and a notorious heist at Boston's famed [[Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum]] that occurred in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Chris.

==Collection standards==

Although the museum's motto is "Art too bad to be ignored", MOBA holds rigorous standards as to what they will accept. According to Marie Jackson, "Nine out of ten pieces don't get in because they're not bad enough. What an artist considers to be bad doesn't always meet our low standards."&lt;ref&gt;Swoger, Kate. "Bad Art Finds a Good Home at This Anti-Museum". ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', February 26, 2000. K6&lt;/ref&gt; As stated in the introduction to ''The Museum Of Bad Art: Masterworks'', the primary attribute of an ''[[Work of art|objet d'art]]'' to be acquired by MOBA is that it must have been seriously attempted by someone making an artistic statement. A lack of artistic skill is not essential for a work to be included; a prospective painting or sculpture for the collection ideally should "[result] in a compelling image",&lt;ref name="saccox"&gt;{{harvnb|Frank|Sacco|2008|p=x}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as honorary curator Ollie Hallowell stated, the art must have an "Oh my God" quality.&lt;ref name="english" /&gt;

An important criterion for inclusion is that a painting or sculpture must not be boring. Michael Frank says they are not interested in commercial works like ''[[Dogs Playing Poker]]'': "We collect things made in earnest, where people attempted to make art and something went wrong, either in the execution or in the original premise."&lt;ref name="english"/&gt; Montserrat College of Art used MOBA's exhibition as a demonstration to its students that "sincerity is still important, and pureness of intent is valid".&lt;ref name="hirsch"/&gt;

MOBA accepts unsolicited works if they meet its standards. Frequently, curators consider works by artists who display an intensity or emotion in the art that they are unable to reconcile with their level of skill. The museum dedicated a show to "relentless creativity" in an exhibition titled "I Just Can't Stop" that was covered by local news and [[CNN]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumofbadart.org/about/36.html The MOBA news: The Museum of Bad Art (MOBA) Newsletter, Issue #36 Excerpt] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123224026/http://museumofbadart.org/about/36.html |date=2009-01-23 }}.

Accessed, March 31, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Dean Nimmer, a professor at the [[Massachusetts College of Art]] (also holding the title of MOBA's Executive Director of Good Taste), noted the parallels between the Museum Of Bad Art's standards and those of other institutions: "They take the model of a museum of fine arts and apply the same kind of criteria to acceptance for bad work&amp;nbsp;... [Their rules] are very similar to a gallery or museum that says 'Well, our area is really installation art or realist paintings or neo-post-modern abstractions.{{' "}}&lt;ref name="goldberg"/&gt;

MOBA does not collect art created by children, or art traditionally perceived as lesser in quality, such as [[black velvet painting]]s, [[Paint by number|paint-by-numbers]], [[kitsch]], or factory-produced art—including works specifically created for tourists. Curators are also not interested in crafts such as [[Rug making#Hooking|latch hook rug]] kits.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Frank|Sacco|2008|pp=x–xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; MOBA curators suggest that more appropriate venues for such works would be the "Museum of Questionable Taste, The International Schlock Collection, or the National Treasury of Dubious Home Decoration".&lt;ref name="saccox"/&gt;

The Museum Of Bad Art has been accused of being anti-art, or taking works that were sincerely rendered and mocking them. However, Scott Wilson insists that a work of art accepted into MOBA is a celebration of the artist's enthusiasm.&lt;ref name="goldberg"/&gt; Marie Jackson reiterated this thought, saying "I think it's a great encouragement to people... who want to create [and] are held back by fear, and when they see these pieces, they realize there's nothing to be afraid of—just go for it."&lt;ref name="caro"&gt;Caro, Mark, "Not a Pretty Picture—Boston-Area Museum a Monument to the Absolute Worst in Art". ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', May 20, 1997. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Louise Reilly Sacco agreed, stating, "If we're making fun of something, it's the art community, not the artists. But this is a real museum. It's 10 years. It's 6,000 people on a mailing list. It's recognition all over the world."&lt;ref name="Cobb"&gt;Cobb, Nathan.

''The Boston Globe'', February 28, 2004. C1&lt;/ref&gt; Curators insist that artists whose works are selected by MOBA enjoy the attention and that it is a [[Win-win game|win-win]]; the museum gains another work of art, and the artist receives exposure in a museum. A 1997 article in ''[[The Chicago Tribune]]'' stated that none of the 10 to 15 artists who had stepped forward to acknowledge their work in MOBA had been upset.&lt;ref name="caro"/&gt;

Many of the works in MOBA are donated, often by the artists themselves. Others come from yard sales or [[thrift stores]]; the Trash Collectors Union in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] has donated works rescued from imminent demise. Occasionally a painting may be purchased; at one time MOBA's policy was not to spend more than $6.50 on any piece.&lt;ref name="irishtimes" /&gt; More recently, twice and even three times that amount has been paid for an exceptional work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Belanger|Moran|Sceurman|2008|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those pieces not retained by the museum are included in a "Rejection Collection" that may be sold at auction. In the past, some proceeds went to the [[Salvation Army]] for providing so many of MOBA's pieces; the museum itself usually benefits from most auctions.&lt;ref name="caro"/&gt;

==Collection highlights==
Each painting or sculpture MOBA exhibits is accompanied by a brief description of the medium, size, name of the artist, as well as how the piece was acquired, and an analysis of the work's possible intention or symbolism. ''[[Museums Journal]]'' noted that the discussion accompanying each work would most likely have most visitors reduced "to hysterics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lewis, Jamie |title=Museum of Bad Art, Boston |journal=[[Museums Journal]] |volume=106 |issue=5 |pages=62 |date=May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The captions—described as "distinctly tongue-in-cheek commentaries" by David Mutch of the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]''&lt;ref name=Mutch/&gt;—were primarily written by Marie Jackson, until the "dissolution of the MOBA interpretative staff"; the task was then taken over by Michael Frank and Louise Reilly Sacco.&lt;ref name="saccoxiv"&gt;Frank and Sacco, xiv&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Lucy in the Field with Flowers''===
Many of MOBA's works generate extensive discourse from visitors. ''Lucy in the Field with Flowers'' (oil on canvas by Unknown; acquired from trash in Boston) remains a favorite with the news media and patrons.  As the first work acquired by the museum, ''Lucy'' is "a painting so powerful it commands its own preservation for posterity", setting a standard by which all future acquisitions would be compared, and causing MOBA's founders to question if Scott Wilson found ''Lucy'' or she found him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stankowicz|Jackson|1996|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kate Swoger of ''[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Montreal Gazette]]'' called ''Lucy'' a "gorgeous mistake", describing her thus: "an elderly woman dancing in a lush spring field, sagging breasts flopping willy-nilly, as she inexplicably seems to hold a red chair to her behind with one hand and a clutch of daisies in the other".&lt;ref name="swoger"/&gt; Author [[Cash Peters]], using less florid language, summarized it as "the old woman with an armchair glued to her ass".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peters|2003|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MOBA's statement about ''Lucy'' reads: "The motion, the chair, the sway of her breast, the subtle hues of the sky, the expression on her face—every detail combines to create this transcendent and compelling portrait, every detail cries out 'masterpiece'."&lt;ref name="lucy"&gt;[http://www.museumofbadart.org/collection/portraiture-1.php Portraiture #1 Lucy In the Field With Flowers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226052249/http://www.museumofbadart.org/collection/portraiture-1.php |date=2009-02-26 }}. Museum of Bad Art, 2009. Retrieved on March 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Times]]'' recounted comments left by a museum visitor regarding the "endless layers of mysteries" the image offers: "What is [[Norman Mailer]]'s head doing on an innocent grandma's body, and are those crows or [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16s]] skimming the hills?"&lt;ref name="Mailer"&gt;[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/whats_on/listings/article743688.ece "So Bad It's Good: The Arts Online".] ''[[The Times]]'', March 25, 2006. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

''Lucy''{{'s}} granddaughter, a Boston-area nurse named Susan Lawlor, became a fan of MOBA after seeing the portrait in a newspaper.&lt;ref name="lucy" /&gt; She recognized it as her grandmother, Anna Lally Keane (c. 1890–1968); upon seeing the picture, Lawlor snorted [[Coca-Cola]] from her nose in astonishment.&lt;ref name="stank2"&gt;{{harvnb|Stankowicz|Jackson|1996|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was commissioned by her mother, and it hung in her aunt's house for many years, despite the trepidation family members felt at seeing the final composition. Says Lawlor: "The face is hauntingly hers, but everything else is so horribly wrong. It looks like she only has one breast. I'm not sure what happened to her arms and legs, and I don't know where all the flowers and yellow sky came from."&lt;ref name="caro"/&gt;

===''Sunday on the Pot with George''===

''Sunday on the Pot With George'' (acrylic on canvas by John Gedraitis; donated by Jim Schulman) has been deemed "iconic" by Bella English of ''The Boston Globe'', who assures the work is "100 percent guaranteed to make you burst out laughing".&lt;ref name="english07"/&gt; Wilson has pointed to ''George'' as an example of a technically well-executed piece of art using a subject not usually seen rendered in paint.&lt;ref name="caro"/&gt;

Many admirers of the first work donated to MOBA are hypnotized by the image of a portly man wearing "Y-front" underwear while sitting on a chamber pot, in [[pointillist]] [[impressionism]] similar to the style of [[Georges Seurat]].  One critic speculates the pointillist style in ''George'' may have been acquired "from watching too much TV".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Citro|Foulds|2004|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title refers to the [[Stephen Sondheim]] musical ''[[Sunday in the Park with George]]'', which contains a dramatic recreation of Seurat's painting ''[[A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte]]''. Author Amy Levin suggests that ''George'' is a pastiche of Seurat's painting.&lt;ref name="levin198"&gt;Levin, 198&lt;/ref&gt; The subject of this painting has been "tentatively identified" by the ''[[Annals of Improbable Research]]''—the creators of the [[Ig Nobel]] award—as  [[John Ashcroft]], former [[United States Attorney General]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = The George / John Controversy| work = [[Annals of Improbable Research]]| url = http://improbable.com/projects/george/george-pot.html| accessdate = March 3, 2009| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091008202247/http://www.improbable.com/projects/george/george-pot.html| archivedate = October 8, 2009| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A visitor was so moved by ''George'' he felt compelled to express his gratitude for its display in the Dedham Community Theatre basement, writing "Someone had slipped into the bathroom as I took in this painting and began peeing loudly into a toilet. The reverberating sound of urine splashing while viewing ''George'' brought the painting to life, and when the denouement of the flush sounded, I wept."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stankowicz|Jackson|1996|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; MOBA's accompanying caption introduces questions and observations: "Can the swirling steam melt away the huge weight of George's corporate responsibilities? This pointillist piece is curious for meticulous attention to fine detail, such as the stitching around the edge of the towel, in contrast to the almost careless disregard for the subject's feet."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumofbadart.org/collection/portraiture-2.html Portraiture #2 Sunday on the Pot With George] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226050142/http://www.museumofbadart.org/collection/portraiture-2.html |date=2009-02-26 }}.

===''Bone-Juggling Dog in Hula Skirt''===
In contrast to the pointillist impressionism of ''George'', the museum also features a "fine example of labor-intensive pointlessism",&lt;ref name="newman"/&gt; according to MOBA staff. Mari Newman's ''Bone-Juggling Dog in Hula Skirt'' (tempera and acrylic paint on canvas; donated by the artist), inspired this description by MOBA: "We can only wonder what possesses an artist to portray a dog juggling bones while wearing a hula skirt."&lt;ref name="newman"&gt;"[http://www.museumofbadart.org/collection/recent06.php Juggling Dog in Hula Skirt] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502115700/http://www.museumofbadart.org/collection/recent06.php |date=2009-05-02 }}". Museum of Bad Art, 2009. Retrieved on March 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; MOBA enjoys the mystery as much as any other aspect of art, however.&lt;ref name="wilson"/&gt;

Newman, a professional artist from Minneapolis, responded to the curators' cogitation by describing how the image came into being. She bought used canvases while a poor art student, and was unsure how to use a canvas with these dimensions. Inspired by a cartoon of a [[dachshund]], she chose that as a subject, but was unhappy with the effect until she added a [[grass skirt|hula skirt]] she had seen in a magazine, and colored dog bones she spied in a pet store. Newman wrote to them, saying "I almost threw it out until I heard of MOBA. After many years of slashing rejected work, now I wish I had saved them all for you."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Frank|Sacco|2008|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motifs and interpretations===
Travel writer Cash Peters identifies six characteristics common to many of the museum's artworks. The first is that MOBA artists are unable to render hands or feet, and mask them by extending figures' arms off the canvas, hiding them with long sleeves, or placing shoes on feet in inappropriate scenarios. Second, Peters compared artists [[Rembrandt]] and [[J. M. W. Turner]], masters of landscapes, who "could probably paint with their eyes shut" to MOBA artists who apparently did paint with their eyes shut, as skies are often painted in any color but blue, [[flora]] are created without reference to any existing plant organisms, and [[fauna]] appear so small in the background it is impossible to discern what kind of animals they are. Third, MOBA artists apply [[perspective (visual)|perspective]] inconsistently, either from one painting to the next, or within a single work.  Peters's fourth observation concerns the difficulty MOBA artists seem to have in successfully rendering noses: he writes that a nose will be attempted so many times that the work takes on a third dimension as paint is reapplied over and over. Fifth, bad artists favor "mixed media": if in doubt, they glue feathers, glitter, or hair to their work. Lastly, Peters suggests that artists know their work is bad, but apparently feel the piece may be saved by including a monkey or a poodle in the composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peters|2003|pp=71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since late 2008, MOBA has been experimenting with allowing the public to title and caption some works. According to the curatorial staff, since some of the works are so puzzling, mere artistic interpretation is not sufficient: they must be "interpretated".&lt;ref name="saccoxiv"/&gt; The "Guest Interpretator's Collection" is an invitation for MOBA's visitors to include their thoughts on compelling artworks; a contest decides the best analysis and these interpretations are added as each contest ends.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.museumofbadart.org/interpretations/ The Guest Interpretator's Collection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208065825/http://museumofbadart.org/interpretations/ |date=2009-02-08 }}".

Retrieved on March 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; A professor at [[Boston University]] offered his thoughts: "The location of the museum as much as its collection suggests a commitment to the abject and a belief in the power and force of culture's marginalized effects. I was also reminded that I need to pick up some toilet bowl cleaner on my way home!"&lt;ref name="english07"/&gt;

[[Commedia Beauregard]], a theatre company whose mission focuses on translation, was inspired by MOBA's mission to create their Master Works series of short play festivals.  The company commissioned six playwrights to write short plays based on MOBA artworks. ''Master Works: The MOBA Plays'' was originally performed in January and February 2009 in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]]. The plays were based on the MOBA pieces ''Mana Lisa'', ''Invasion of the Office Zombies'', ''My Left Foot'', ''Bone-Juggling Dog in Hula Skirt'', ''Gina's Demons'', and ''Lulli, Fowl and Gravestone''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tcdailyplanet.net/article/2009/01/30/theater-master-works-blb-bad-art-good-plays.html&lt;/ref&gt;  After moving to [[Chicago]], the company again produced ''The MOBA Plays'' in March and April 2011, using three of the original plays and translating three new paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://centerstage.net/theatre/shows/10735.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314090442/http://centerstage.net/theatre/shows/10735.html |archivedate=2014-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Museum visitors can sign a guest book, and leave comments.  One Canadian visitor wrote:  "This collection is disturbing, yet I can't seem to look away...Just like a hideous car accident."  Another visitor warns: "Her nipples follow you around the room. Creepy!"&lt;ref name=Lowbrow /&gt;

Response to MOBA's opening and continued success is, for some, evocative of the way art is treated in society. MOBA works have been described as "unintentionally hilarious", similar to the atrocious films of [[Ed Wood]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ffwdweekly.com/Issues/1998/0917/art3.html "Exhibit Preview: The Museum of Bad Art"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720110249/http://www.ffwdweekly.com/Issues/1998/0917/art3.html |date=2008-07-20 }}. ''[[Fast Forward Weekly]]'', September 17, 1998 &lt;!--Retrieved on March 6, 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Visitors—and even MOBA staff—often laugh out loud at displays. In ''Gullible's Travels'', Cash Peters  contrasted this behavior with what is expected of patrons at galleries such as [[Southern California]]'s [[J. Paul Getty Museum|Getty Museum]]; though viewers might find the art at the Getty equally hilarious, were they to show it they would almost certainly be thrown out.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peters|2003|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Louise Reilly Sacco participated in a panel discussion with authorities on art and architecture about standards of beauty and ugliness in art, published in ''Architecture Boston''. She remarked that teachers bring high school art students to MOBA, then to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (MFA). Sacco observes, "Somehow MOBA frees kids to laugh and point, to have their own opinions and argue about things. Then they take the experience to the MFA, where they might otherwise feel intimidated... Maybe the ugly&amp;nbsp;... frees us."&lt;ref name="architecture"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.architects.org/emplibrary/AB_May_June_2006_RoundTableB.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110109002239/http://www.architects.org/emplibrary/AB_May_June_2006_RoundTableB.pdf |archivedate=9 January 2011|title=Pretty Ugly |author=Architecture Boston |date=May 2006 |pages=18–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sacco believes that extreme ugliness is more striking than extreme beauty, and it forces people to think more deeply about what is wrong or misplaced. She connects this rigid judgment of what does not conform to beauty with intolerance for physical imperfections in people, noting that such rigidity sometimes causes parents to "fix" the perceived flaws in their children's faces to keep them from suffering later.&lt;ref name="architecture"/&gt;

Jason Kaufman, a [[Harvard]] professor who teaches the sociology of culture, wrote that MOBA is part of a social trend he calls "annoyism", where mass media venues promote performances and artists who mix the deliberately bad with the clever. The Museum Of Bad Art happens to embody this trend, and further illustrates its central aim to mock the judgment system by which people identify what is bad from what is not. For Kaufman, "The beauty of MOBA—though beauty is surely the wrong word—is the way it undermines aesthetic criteria from numerous angles."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kaufman | first1 = J. | title = So bad it's good | doi = 10.1525/ctx.2007.6.4.81 | journal = Contexts | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 81–84| year = 2007 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Amy Levin, describing how American history and culture have been shaped by small local museums, suggests that MOBA is a parody of art itself, and that MOBA's commentary, newsletter, website, and publications mock museums as authorities on what is good art.&lt;ref name="levin198"/&gt; The director of the Ellipse Arts Center, a gallery in [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington, Virginia]], that hosted a traveling exhibition of MOBA works, was astonished to see people's exuberant laughter because no one visiting the Ellipse had ever responded to art this way. She observed, "If I didn't have a sign on the door, people might not think it's so bad. Who's to say what's bad and what's good?"&lt;ref name="lewis"&gt;Lewis, Nicole. [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-694807.html "For Badness' Sake"]. ''[[The Washington Post]]'', October 8, 1998. D5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Deborah Solomon]], in ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'', asserted that MOBA's success reflects a trend in modern art among artists and audiences. The arrival of [[abstraction]] and [[modern art]] in the early 20th century made art appreciation more esoteric and less accessible for the general community, showing that "the American public ... think[s] of museums as intimidating places ruled by a cadre of experts whose taste and rituals [seem] as mysterious as those of Byzantine priests."&lt;ref name="solomon"/&gt; Bad art is in vogue, as a movement that rejects the anti-sentimentalism that marked earlier disdain for artists such as [[Norman Rockwell]] or [[Gustave Moreau]], according to Solomon.  Garen Daly, a MOBA fan on several Boston-area [[Arts council|art councils]], stated in 1995, "I go to a lot of openings, and sometimes they're pretty damn stuffy."&lt;ref name="hirsch"&gt;Hirsch, James "Gosh, That's Awful!

A1&lt;/ref&gt; Not only does the Museum Of Bad Art offer different fare for the eyes, but instead of the wine and cheese that is provided for most museum and art gallery visitors, a MOBA show provides its patrons with [[Kool-Aid]], [[Fluffernutter]]s and [[cheese puffs]].&lt;ref name="lewis"/&gt;

===Use in academic research===
The Museum Of Bad Art has been used in academic studies as a standard of reference for the spectacularly awful. In one such study, published in ''[[Perspectives on Psychological Science#Journals|Perspectives on Psychological Science]]'', researchers tested the consistency of responses between people asked to make "gut" judgments versus those who gave conscious well-reasoned responses regarding the quality of various pieces of art.  The researchers showed respondents images from MOBA and New York's [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA), and asked them to rate each painting on a scale with two ends representing "Very Attractive" and "Very Unattractive". The study found that those who reasoned in conscious thought were neither more accurate nor as consistent in their ratings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dijksterhuis | first1 = A. | last2 = Nordgren | first2 = L.

Furthermore, the deliberators did not find MOBA art as unattractive as those with quicker response times. The study concluded that people who make quick judgments do so more consistently, with no significant change to accuracy.&lt;ref name="Chicago"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Nordgren | first1 = L.

In another study that appeared in the ''[[British Psychological Society|British Journal of Psychology]]'', researchers tested how respondents considered balance in artwork composition of differing qualities. Fifteen pairs of works from [[ArtCyclopedia]] by artists such as [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], and [[Georges-Pierre Seurat]], and fifteen from MOBA by artists including Doug Caderette, Unknown, and D. Alix were shown to participants; in each, an item in the painting was shifted vertically or horizontally, and respondents were asked to identify the original. The researchers hypothesized that respondents would identify balance and composition more easily in the traditional masterworks, and that study participants would find a greater change of quality when items were shifted in traditional masterworks than they would in MOBA pieces. However, the study concluded that balance alone did not define art of higher quality for the participants, and that respondents were more likely to see that original art was more balanced than the altered version, not necessarily that the traditional art was significantly better composed and balanced than MOBA works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

'''''Peace Review''''' is an international research journal in the growing field of [[peace and conflict studies]]. The journal is published quarterly by the [[Taylor &amp; Francis Group]], under the [[Routledge]] imprint, and is a fully peer-reviewed [[academic journal]].&lt;ref&gt;Gavriel Salomon and Ed Cairns, ''Handbook on Peace Education''. Taylor &amp; Francis, 2011
{{ISBN|1136874526}}.  (p. 285)&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal aims to focus on "current issues and controversies that underlie the promotion of a more peaceful world" (journal website). This is a deliberately wide scope, and thus one can find within the journal a wide range of articles on issues relevant for peace, including articles dealing with peace and conflict, education, development, ecology, discrimination, human rights, and culture and ethnicity.

The journal was commenced in 1992 by John Harris at [[Stanford University]], although the editorship was soon assumed by Robert Elias at the [[University of San Francisco]].  The editorial board of the journal has over the years included eminent peace researchers, such as [[Elise M. Boulding]] and [[Johan Galtung]]. The journal currently receives funding from the Catholic Social Thought Project at the [[University of San Francisco]] and the Jesuit Foundation.

As often is the case with scholarly journals, the journal has undergone name changes. The full name of the journal was previously ''Peace Review: A Transnational Quarterly'', although the full name of the journal is now ''Peace Review: A Journal of Social Justice,'' reflecting the way that social justice concerns are now generally regarded as intrinsic to peace.

In 2000 the journal was awarded the Project Censored Award{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} and the journal is currently a [[Utne]] Media Award finalist.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

One of the specific aspects of the journal is the transnational readership, in that the journal is distributed to more than 90 countries.  Thus the journal aims to avoid speaking with the voice of any particular national culture or politics.  Another prominent aspect of the journal is that it aims to reach an informed yet non-specialist readership. Thus the journal attempts to publish accessible and relatively short essays, as free as possible from specialist jargon.  However, being a privatised journal, readers not associated with subscribing universities must pay a fee to access each article, effectively putting the journal beyond the reach of many independent researchers and many students from developing countries.

The journal abstracted in most political and social science abstracts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2872">The '''Perestroika Movement''' is a loose-knit intellectual tendency in academic [[political science]] which seeks to expand [[methodological pluralism]] in order to make the discipline more accessible and relevant to laypeople and non-specialist academics. Established in 2000, the movement was organized in response to the perceived hegemony of quantitative and mathematical methodology in the field. Such dominance breeds academic isolation and poor scholarship, the movement's leaders contend.

==Origins==

The Perestroika Movement began in 2000 with an anonymous e-mail message sent by one “Mr. [[Perestroika]]” to the editors of the ''[[American Political Science Review]]'' calling for "a dismantling of the [[Orwellian system]] that we have in [[American Political Science Association|APSA]]."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/OnTheIrrelevanceOfApsaAndApsrToTheStudyOfPoliticalScience E-mail from Mr. Perestroika, October 17, 2000.]&lt;/ref&gt; The message went to seventeen recipients who quickly forwarded it to others, and within weeks the Perestroika Movement became a force calling for change in the American political science community (Monroe 2005).

'''Planetary science''' or, more rarely, '''planetology''', is the scientific study of [[planet]]s (including [[Earth]]), [[Natural satellite|moons]], and [[planetary system]]s (in particular those of the [[Solar System]]) and the processes that form them. It studies objects ranging in size from [[micrometeoroid]]s to [[gas giant]]s, aiming to determine their composition, dynamics, formation, interrelations and history. It is a strongly [[interdisciplinary]] field, originally growing from [[astronomy]] and [[earth science]],&lt;ref name="Taylor1994"/&gt; but which now incorporates many disciplines, including [[planetary geology]] (together with [[geochemistry]] and [[geophysics]]), [[cosmochemistry]], [[atmospheric science]], [[oceanography]], [[hydrology]], [[theoretical planetary science]], [[glaciology]], and [[exoplanetology]].&lt;ref name="Taylor1994"&gt;{{cite journal

There are interrelated observational and theoretical branches of planetary science. Observational research can involve a combination of [[space exploration]], predominantly with [[robotic spacecraft]] missions using [[remote sensing]], and comparative, experimental work in Earth-based laboratories. The theoretical component involves considerable [[computer simulation]] and mathematical modelling.

Planetary scientists are generally located in the astronomy and physics or Earth sciences departments of universities or research centres, though there are several purely planetary science institutes worldwide. There are several major conferences each year, and a wide range of [[academic journal|peer-reviewed journals]]. In the case of some exclusive planetary scientists, many of whom are in relation to the study of dark matter, they will seek a private research centre and often initiate partnership research tasks.

==History==
The history of planetary science may be said to have begun with the Ancient Greek philosopher [[Democritus]], who is reported by [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]] as saying &lt;blockquote&gt;The ordered worlds are boundless and differ in size, and that in some there is neither sun nor moon, but that in others, both are greater than with us, and yet with others more in number. And that the intervals between the ordered worlds are unequal, here more and there less, and that some increase, others flourish and others decay, and here they come into being and there they are eclipsed. But that they are destroyed by colliding with one another. And that some ordered worlds are bare of animals and plants and all water.&lt;ref name="Philosophumena"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hippolytus (Antipope) |author2=Origen |others=Translation by Francis Legge, F.S.A.|title=Philosophumena|publisher=Society for promoting Christian knowledge|location=Original from Harvard University.|date=1921|volume=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0lrDy9nn1doC&amp;printsec=titlepage|accessdate=22 May 2009|type=Digitized 9 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In more modern times, planetary science began in astronomy, from studies of the unresolved planets. In this sense, the original planetary astronomer would be [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], who discovered the four largest moons of [[Jupiter]], the mountains on the [[Moon]], and first observed the [[rings of Saturn]], all objects of intense later study. Galileo's study of the lunar mountains in 1609 also began the study of extraterrestrial landscapes: his observation "that the Moon certainly does not possess a smooth and polished surface" suggested that it and other worlds might appear "just like the face of the Earth itself".&lt;ref name="Taylor1994b"&gt;{{cite journal
|last=Taylor
|first=Stuart Ross
|date=1994
|title=Silent upon a peak in Darien

|volume=369

|pages=196–7
|bibcode=1994Natur.369..196T
|doi=10.1038/369196a0
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances in telescope construction and instrumental resolution gradually allowed increased identification of the atmospheric and surface details of the planets. The Moon was initially the most heavily studied, as it always exhibited details on its surface, due to its proximity to the Earth, and the technological improvements gradually produced more detailed lunar geological knowledge. In this scientific process, the main instruments were astronomical [[optical telescope]]s (and later [[radio telescopes]]) and finally robotic exploratory [[space probe|spacecraft]].

The Solar System has now been relatively well-studied, and a good overall understanding of the formation and evolution of this planetary system exists. However, there are large numbers of unsolved questions,&lt;ref name="SternPlanetarySoc09"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00001956/|title=Ten Things I Wish We Really Knew In Planetary Science|last=Stern|first=Alan|accessdate=2009-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the rate of new discoveries is very high, partly due to the large number of interplanetary spacecraft currently exploring the Solar System.

==Disciplines==

===Planetary astronomy===
This is both an observational and a theoretical science. Observational researchers are predominantly concerned with the study of the small bodies of the Solar System: those that are observed by telescopes, both optical and radio, so that characteristics of these bodies such as shape, spin, surface materials and weathering are determined, and the history of their formation and evolution can be understood.

Theoretical planetary astronomy is concerned with [[Analytical dynamics|dynamics]]: the application of the principles of [[celestial mechanics]] to the Solar System and [[extrasolar planet]]ary systems.

=== Planetary geology ===
{{main|Planetary geology}}
{{see also|Geology of solar terrestrial planets|Icy moon}}

The best known research topics of planetary geology deal with the planetary bodies in the near vicinity of the Earth: the [[Moon]], and the two neighbouring planets: [[Venus]] and [[Mars]]. Of these, the Moon was studied first, using methods developed earlier on the Earth.

==== Geomorphology ====
{{main|Geomorphology}}

Geomorphology studies the features on planetary surfaces and reconstructs the history of their formation, inferring the physical processes that acted on the surface. Planetary geomorphology includes the study of several classes of surface features:
* Impact features (multi-ringed basins, craters)
* Volcanic and tectonic features (lava flows, fissures, [[rille]]s)
* [[Space weathering]] - erosional effects generated by the harsh environment of space (continuous micro meteorite bombardment, high-energy particle rain, [[impact gardening]]). For example, the thin dust cover on the surface of the [[moon|lunar]] [[regolith]] is a result of micro meteorite bombardment.
* Hydrological features: the liquid involved can range from water to [[hydrocarbon]] and [[ammonia]], depending on the location within the Solar System.

The history of a planetary surface can be deciphered by mapping features from top to bottom according to their [[Law of superposition|deposition sequence]], as first determined on terrestrial [[stratum|strata]] by [[Nicolas Steno]]. For example, [[Stratigraphy|stratigraphic mapping]] prepared the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] astronauts for the field geology they would encounter on their lunar missions. Overlapping sequences were identified on images taken by the [[Lunar Orbiter program]], and these were used to prepare a lunar [[stratigraphic column]] and [[geologic map|geological map]] of the Moon.
{{further|Geology of the Moon}}

====Cosmochemistry, geochemistry and petrology====
{{main|Cosmochemistry|Geochemistry|Petrology}}

One of the main problems when generating hypotheses on the formation and evolution of objects in the Solar System is the lack of samples that can be analysed in the laboratory, where a large suite of tools are available and the full body of knowledge derived from terrestrial geology can be brought to bear. Direct samples from the Moon, [[asteroid]]s and [[Mars]] are present on Earth, removed from their parent bodies and delivered as [[meteorite]]s. Some of these have suffered contamination from the [[oxidise|oxidising]] effect of Earth's atmosphere and the infiltration of the [[biosphere]], but those meteorites collected in the last few decades from [[Antarctica]] are almost entirely pristine.

The different types of meteorites that originate from the [[asteroid belt]] cover almost all parts of the structure of [[planetary differentiation|differentiated]] bodies: meteorites even exist that come from the core-mantle boundary ([[pallasite]]s). The combination of geochemistry and observational astronomy has also made it possible to trace the [[HED meteorite]]s back to a specific asteroid in the main belt, [[4 Vesta]].

The comparatively few known [[Martian meteorites]] have provided insight into the geochemical composition of the Martian crust, although the unavoidable lack of information about their points of origin on the diverse Martian surface has meant that they do not provide more detailed constraints on theories of the evolution of the Martian [[lithosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uwyo.edu&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 24, 2013 65 samples of Martian meteorites have been discovered on Earth. Many were found in either Antarctica or the Sahara Desert.

During the Apollo era, in the [[Apollo program]], 384 kilograms of [[lunar sample]]s were collected and transported to the Earth, and 3 [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Luna programme|Luna]] robots also delivered [[regolith]] samples from the Moon. These samples provide the most comprehensive record of the composition of any Solar System body beside the Earth. The numbers of lunar meteorites are growing quickly in the last few years –&lt;ref&gt;{curator.jsc.nasa.gov/antmet/lmc/lmcintro.pdf}&lt;/ref&gt; as of
April 2008 there are 54 meteorites that have been officially classified as lunar.
Eleven of these are from the US Antarctic meteorite collection, 6 are from the Japanese
Antarctic meteorite collection, and the other 37 are from hot desert localities in Africa,
Australia, and the Middle East. The total mass of recognized lunar meteorites is close to
50&amp;nbsp;kg.

====Geophysics====
{{main|Geophysics|Space physics}}
Space probes made it possible to collect data in not only the visible light region, but in other areas of the electromagnetic spectrum. The planets can be characterized by their force fields: gravity and their magnetic fields, which are studied through geophysics and space physics.

Measuring the changes in acceleration experienced by spacecraft as they orbit has allowed fine details of the [[gravity field]]s of the planets to be mapped. For example, in the 1970s, the gravity field disturbances above [[lunar maria]] were measured through lunar orbiters, which led to the discovery of concentrations of mass, [[Mass concentration (astronomy)|mascons]], beneath the Imbrium, Serenitatis, Crisium, Nectaris and Humorum basins.
[[File:Magnetosphere rendition.jpg|right|thumb|The [[solar wind]] is deflected by the magnetosphere (not to scale)]]
If a planet's [[magnetic field]] is sufficiently strong, its interaction with the solar wind forms a [[magnetosphere]] around a planet. Early space probes discovered the gross dimensions of the terrestrial magnetic field, which extends about 10 Earth radii towards the Sun. The [[solar wind]], a stream of charged particles, streams out and around the terrestrial magnetic field, and continues behind the magnetic tail, hundreds of Earth radii downstream. Inside the magnetosphere, there are relatively dense regions of solar wind particles, the [[Van Allen radiation belt]]s.

Geophysics includes [[seismology]] and [[tectonophysics]], [[geophysical fluid dynamics]], [[mineral physics]], [[geodynamics]], [[mathematical geophysics]], and [[geophysical surveying]].

{{anchor|planetary geodesy}}&lt;!-- used by incoming redirect --&gt;
Planetary [[geodesy]], (also known as planetary geodetics) deals with the measurement and representation of the planets of the Solar System, their [[gravitation]]al fields and geodynamic phenomena ([[polar motion]] in three-dimensional, time-varying space. The science of geodesy has elements of both astrophysics and planetary sciences. The shape of the Earth is to a large extent the result of its rotation, which causes its equatorial bulge, and the competition of geologic processes such as the collision of plates and of [[Volcano|vulcanism]], resisted by the Earth's [[gravity]] field. These principles can be applied to the solid surface of Earth ([[orogeny]]; Few mountains are higher than {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}}, few deep sea trenches deeper than that because quite simply, a mountain as tall as, for example, {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=on}}, would develop so much [[pressure]] at its base, due to gravity, that the rock there would become [[plastic]], and the mountain would slump back to a height of roughly {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} in a geologically insignificant time. Some or all of these geologic principles can be applied to other planets besides Earth. For instance on Mars, whose surface gravity is much less, the largest volcano, [[Olympus Mons]], is {{convert|27|km|0|abbr=on}} high at its peak, a height that could not be maintained on Earth. The Earth [[geoid]] is essentially the figure of the Earth abstracted from its topographic features. Therefore, the Mars geoid is essentially the figure of Mars abstracted from its topographic features. [[Surveying]] and [[map]]ping are two important fields of application of geodesy.

===Atmospheric science===
{{main|Atmospheric science|Global climate model}}
[[File:Jupiter.jpg|right|thumb|Cloud bands clearly visible on [[Jupiter]]. ]]
The [[atmosphere]] is an important transitional zone between the solid planetary surface and the higher rarefied [[Ionisation|ionizing]] and radiation belts. Not all planets have atmospheres: their existence depends on the mass of the planet, and the planet's distance from the Sun&amp;nbsp;— too distant and frozen atmospheres occur. Besides the four [[gas giant]] planets, almost all of the [[terrestrial planets]] ([[Earth's atmosphere|Earth]], [[Atmosphere of Venus|Venus]], and [[Atmosphere of Mars|Mars]]) have significant atmospheres. Two moons have significant atmospheres: [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] and [[Neptune]]'s moon [[Atmosphere of Triton|Triton]]. A tenuous atmosphere exists around [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]].

The effects of the [[Planet#Rotation|rotation rate]] of a planet about its axis can be seen in atmospheric streams and currents. Seen from space, these features show as bands and eddies in the cloud system, and are particularly visible on Jupiter and Saturn.

==Comparative planetary science==

{{main|Comparative planetary science}}

Planetary science frequently makes use of the method of comparison to give a greater understanding of the object of study. This can involve comparing the dense atmospheres of Earth and Saturn's moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], the evolution of outer Solar System objects at different distances from the Sun, or the geomorphology of the surfaces of the terrestrial planets, to give only a few examples.

The main comparison that can be made is to features on the Earth, as it is much more accessible and allows a much greater range of measurements to be made. Earth analogue studies are particularly common in planetary geology, geomorphology, and also in atmospheric science.

A '''political faction''' is a group of individuals within a larger entity, such as a [[political party]], a [[trade union]] or other group, or simply a [[political climate]], united by a particular common political purpose that differs in some respect to the rest of the entity. A faction or political party may include fragmented sub-factions, "parties within a party," which may be referred to as power blocs, or voting blocs. Members of factions band together as a way of achieving these goals and advancing their agenda and position within an organisation.

Factions are not limited to political parties; they can and frequently do form within any group that has some sort of political aim or purpose.

The Latin word ''factio'' denoted originally either of the chariot teams that were organised professionally by private companies in ancient Rome, each recognisable by characteristic colour and arousing supporter hysteria similar to that in modern sports fans. These teams were not unlike gladiator schools, but the lethal nature of that entertainment meant few performers lasted long enough to build up similar crowd loyalty to the "team", while the fighters rarely actually teamed up, but rather fought duels or beasts. In time, political currents could become associated with such a team, although precisely how this happened is unclear. In Byzantine Constantinople, two such chariot factions, blue and green, repeatedly made or broke the claims of candidates to the imperial throne.

Occasionally, the term "faction" is still used more or less as a synonym for political party, but "with opprobrious sense, conveying the imputation of selfish or mischievous ends or turbulent or unscrupulous methods", according to the Oxford English Dictionary. In his Dictionary, Samuel Johnson (a [[Tory]]) dismissively defined [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] as "the name of a faction". Similarly, in the tenth instalment of The Federalist Papers, [[James Madison]] defines a faction as "a number of citizens, whether amounting to a minority or majority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adverse to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community." In plain English this is a group that pursues self-interest at the expense of the greater good.

==Aims of factions==
The aims of a political faction are as diverse as the different types of bodies within which they appear. Typically, however, they include: advancing a particular [[policy]] or policy agenda, preventing the adoption of alternative policies and supporting given individuals to positions of power within the organisation or in the wider political world.  A faction can primarily be based around supporting a given person or group, or a single major aim, with little in the way of common agenda otherwise, or it can have a comprehensive and definitive set of policies.  Either way, factional politics typically revolve around personality, with a few individuals playing key roles, acting as a magnet for like-minded people, leading the activities of the faction, and acting as a prominent voice for the shared objectives of the faction. Such individuals can be referred to by a variety of names, such as “powerbrokers” or “factional chiefs”.

==Organisation==
&lt;!--Please DO NOT change the spelling of "organisation" to "organization". See [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style#National varieties of English]].--&gt;
Factions differ in the amount of organisation and internal structure they possess. On the left, these may take the form of tendencies or [[platform (European politics)|platforms]]. Most factions are very loose organisations, having no definitive list of members, but some factions, have a formal internal structure, with membership lists, regular meetings, official positions – such as negotiators, conveners, [[whip (politics)|whips]] and organisers, – and a definitive policy position on every issue affecting the broader organisation. Such factions will typically be binding; that is, they rely upon all members casting their votes in accordance with the pre-ordained official stance of the faction.

==Operation of factions==
In political organisations that are [[democracy|democratic]] in structure, factions rely heavily on securing enough votes to win important ballots. This process is sometimes referred to as “doing the numbers”. Having the numbers will allow the faction to push policies it supports and elect its members to powerful positions within the broader organisation.

If one faction develops within an organisation, there will usually be at least one other that develops in opposition to it. Opposing factions will try to match each other's level of organisation and internal discipline, but will also engage in negotiations and trade-offs to ensure that the organisation’s activities are not compromised and that every group has a chance to obtain at least some of its goals.

Key to the operation of an organised faction is the existence of a power base. This will typically be some office, division or branch of the broader organisation over which the faction has effective control. Sometimes a power base may be an external or affiliated organisation that is involved with the broader organisation in some way.

A power base serves several key functions:
* It acts as a recruitment centre for new members, and promotes homogeneity within the membership (crucial for maintaining factional cohesion);
* It can be used as an organising centre for factional events and activities;
* It functions as a springboard, advancing the career of selected factional members and allowing them to gain skills that will increase their effectiveness and clout.

==Effects of factions==
The existence of a factional system can have serious negative consequences for a political organisation.  If factional strife becomes intensive and public, the organisation may suffer from perceptions of disunity. Taken one step further, if the conflict is particularly severe, it may cause ruptures within the organisation that seriously impede its effectiveness, leading to break-up or collapse of the organisation.

To avoid harm to the organisation, factional operations are usually conducted under strong secrecy and with minimal public scrutiny. This, however, can lead to the proliferation of unethical behaviour. Warfare between the factions may lead to tactics such as ballot box-stuffing, stack-outs, membership fraud, and other generally fraudulent conduct. Individuals who abandon a faction may be subject to intense personal [[Feud|vendettas]] where their former comrades go about sabotaging their careers.  A climate of intense factional conflict can also motivate individuals to focus on attacking their factional enemies rather than furthering the broader organisation.

Despite this, the benefits of factional systems are often overlooked. It is often incomprehensible to outsiders why members of a broader organisation would engage in factionalism. This stems from the assumption that the natural factional relationship is one of conflict and strife, when in fact, factions are often able to engage in productive co-operation.

In any political organisation there are likely to be many highly opinionated and passionate people. The existence of a factional system allows its operations to be more predictable and stable. Compromise and give-and-take between factions allows the organisation to operate without having to satisfy the whims of many different, uncompromising individuals who might otherwise cause a split. So, somewhat counter-intuitively, factionalism can actually promote organisational harmony.

Factions also help to broaden and diversify the organisation’s appeal. A person who might otherwise find the organisation’s goals unattractive might be persuaded to support a faction within it whose goals are closer to their own. Just as a democratic [[government]] is often invigorated by a strong [[Parliamentary Opposition|opposition]], so having a number of distinct points-of-view with an organisation can energise it and allow it to perform its role more effectively. It is also highly unlikely that any sizeable political organisation is wholly united in purpose, so arguably factions simply represent a way of managing pre-existing differences within the organisation.

The Founding Fathers of the American constitution, explicitly warned against the dangers of party factionalism. Madison, Hamilton, and Washington expressed the belief that factions would create divides that would ultimately dismantle the government. These sentiments can be found in ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'', specifically Federalist 10 and 51 written by Madison.

[[File:Bützflethermoor Rotschlammdeponie Luftaufnahmen 2012-05-by-RaBoe-478-1.jpg|thumb|Red mud near [[Stade]] ([[Germany]])]]
[[File:Bauxite bedarieux herault.jpg|thumb|[[Bauxite]], an aluminum ore ([[Hérault]] department, [[France]]). The reddish color is  due to [[iron oxides]] that make up the main part of the red mud.]]

'''Red mud''', also known as '''[[bauxite tailings]]''', '''red sludge''', bauxite residue, or alumina refinery residues (ARR), is a highly alkaline [[waste]] product composed mainly of iron oxide that is generated in the industrial production of [[alumina]] (aluminium oxide, the principal raw material used in the manufacture of [[aluminium]] metal and also widely used in the manufacture of ceramics, abrasives and refractories). Annually, about 77 million tons of the red [[hazardous material|special waste]] are produced, causing serious disposal problem in the [[mining]] industry.&lt;ref name="Ayr"&gt;Ayres, R. U., Holmberg, J., Andersson, B., "Materials and the global environment: Waste mining in the 21st century", MRS Bull. 2001, 26, 477.  {{DOI|10.1557/mrs2001.119}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scale of production makes the waste product an important one, and issues with its storage are reviewed and every opportunity is explored to find uses for it.  

Over 95% of the alumina produced globally is through the [[Bayer process]]; for every tonne of alumina produced, approximately 1 to 1.5 tonnes of bauxite tailings/residue are also produced.  Annual production of alumina in 2015 was approximately 115 million tonnes resulting in the generation of about 150 million tonnes of bauxite tailings/residue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-aluminium.org/statistics/alumina-production/ Annual statistics collected and published by World Aluminium].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Red mud is a side-product of the [[Bayer process]], the principal means of refining [[bauxite]] en route to [[alumina]]. The resulting alumina is the raw material for producing [[aluminium]] by the [[Hall–Héroult process]].&lt;ref name="hand"&gt;{{cite book | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=WvT2OEf8DskC&amp;pg=PA18 | pages = 18 | chapter = Red Mud Disposal | title = Handbook of aluminium recycling | isbn = 978-3-8027-2936-2 | author1 = Schmitz, Christoph | year = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A typical bauxite plant produces one to two times as much red mud as alumina. This ratio is dependent on the type of bauxite used in the refining process and the extraction conditions.&lt;ref name="waste" /&gt;

Red mud is composed of a mixture of solid and [[metal]]lic oxides. The [[red]] colour arises from [[iron oxide]]s, which comprise up to 60% of the mass. The mud is highly [[base (chemistry)|basic]] with a [[pH]] ranging from 10 to 13.&lt;ref name="hand"/&gt;&lt;ref name="waste"/&gt;&lt;ref name="indust"/&gt; In addition to iron, the other dominant components include [[silica]], unleached residual alumina, and [[titanium oxide]].&lt;ref name=Ayr/&gt;

There are over 60 manufacturing operations across the world using the [[Bayer process]] to make [[alumina]] from [[bauxite]] ore.  Bauxite ore is mined, normally in open cast mines, and transferred to an alumina refinery for processing.  To extract the alumina, the soluble part of the bauxite ore is dissolved using sodium hydroxide under conditions of high temperature and pressure.  The insoluble part of the bauxite (the residue) is removed, giving rise to a solution of [[sodium aluminate]], which is then seeded and allowed to cool and [[aluminium hydroxide]] precipitates from the solution. Though some of the aluminium hydroxide is then returned and used to seed the next batch, the remainder is calcined (heated) at over 1000&amp;nbsp;°C in rotary kilns or fluid flash calciners to produce aluminium oxide (alumina). The alumina content of the bauxite used is normally about 50% but ores with a much wider range of alumina contents can be used; the aluminium compound may be present as [[gibbsite]] (Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[boehmite]] (AlOOH) or [[diaspore]] (AlOOH).  The tailings/residue invariably has a high concentration of [[iron oxide]] which gives the product a characteristic red colour.  A small residual amount of the sodium hydroxide used in the process remains with the tailings, causing the material to have a high pH/alkalinity, normally &gt;12. Various stages in the solid/liquid separation process are introduced to recycle as much sodium hydroxide as possible from the residue back into the Bayer Process in order to make the process as efficient as possible and reduce production costs. This also lowers the final alkalinity of the tailings making it easier to handle.

==Composition==
The main constituents of the residue after the extraction of the aluminium component are unreacted metallic oxides. The percentage of these oxides produced by a particular alumina refinery will depend on the quality and nature of the bauxite ore and the extraction conditions. The table below shows the composition ranges for common chemical constituents, but the values vary widely:

The objective is to remove as much of the aluminium containing component as economically possible. In general, the composition of the residue reflects that of the non-aluminium components, with the exception of part of the silicon component: crystalline silica (quartz) will not react but some of the silica present, often termed, reactive silica, will react under the extraction conditions and form sodium aluminium silicate.

=== Environmental hazards ===
Discharge of red mud is hazardous environmentally because of its [[alkalinity]].

In October 2010, approximately one million cubic meters of red mud from an [[alumina]] plant near [[Kolontár]] in [[Hungary]] was accidentally released into the surrounding countryside in the [[Ajka alumina plant accident]], killing ten people and contaminating a large area.&lt;ref name=npr100510&gt;[https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2010/10/05/130351938/red-sludge-from-hungarian-aluminum-plant-spill-an-ecological-disaster "Toxic Red Sludge Spill From Hungarian Aluminum Plant 'An Ecological Disaster'"], David Gura, NPR, October 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; All life in the [[Marcal]] river was said to have been "extinguished" by the red mud, and within days the mud had reached the [[Danube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Hungarian chemical sludge spill reaches Danube | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11491412| newspaper = BBC| date = 7 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Residue storage areas (RSA)==
Tailings storage methods have changed substantially since the original plants were built. The practice in early years was to pump the tailings slurry, at a concentration of about 20% solids, into lagoons or ponds sometimes created in former bauxite mines or depleted quarries. In other cases, impoundments were constructed with dams or [[levee]]s, whilst for some operations valleys were dammed and the tailings deposited in these holding areas.&lt;ref&gt;K. Evans, E. Nordheim and K. Tsesmelis, "Bauxite Residue Management", Light Metals, 63–66 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also common practice for the tailings to be discharged into rivers, estuaries, or the sea via pipelines or barges; in other instances the residue was shipped out to sea and disposed of in deep ocean trenches many kilometres offshore. All disposal in the sea, estuaries and rivers has now stopped.&lt;ref&gt;G. Power, M. Graefe and C. Klauber, "Bauxite residue issues: Current Management, Disposal and Storage Practices", Hydrometallurgy, 108, 33–45 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; As residue storage space ran out and concern increased over wet storage, since the mid-1980s dry stacking has been increasingly adopted.&lt;ref&gt;B. G. Purnell, “Mud Disposal at the Burntisland Alumina Plant”. Light Metals, 157–159. (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. H. Pohland and A. J. Tielens, “Design and Operation on Non-decanted Red Mud Ponds in Ludwigshafen”, Proc. Int. Conf. Bauxite Tailings, Kingston, Jamaica (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. I. Robinsky, “Current Status of the Sloped Thickened Tailings Disposal System”, Proc. Int. Conf. Bauxite Tailings, Kingston, Jamaica (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Chandler, “The Stacking and Solar Drying Process for disposal of bauxite tailings in Jamaica”, Proc. Int. Conf. Bauxite Tailings, Kingston, Jamaica (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; In this method, tailings are thickened to a high density slurry (48-55% solids or higher), and then deposited in a way that it consolidates and dries.&lt;ref&gt;“Bauxite Residue Management: Best Practice”, published by World Aluminium the European Aluminium available from the International Aluminium Institute, 10 King Charles II Street, London, SW1Y 4AA, UK and on line from http://bauxite.world-aluminium.org/refining/bauxite-residue-management.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

An increasing popular storage method is filtration whereby a filter cake (typically &lt;30% solids) is produced. This cake can be washed with either water or steam to reduce alkalinity before being transported and stored as a semi-dried material.&lt;ref&gt;K. S. Sutherland, "Solid/Liquid Separation Equipment", Wiley-VCH, Weinheim (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;  Residue produced in this form is ideal for reuse as it has lower alkalinity, is cheaper to transport, and is easier to handle and process.

==Use==

Since the [[Bayer process]] was first adopted industrially in 1894, the value of the remaining oxides has been recognised. Attempts have been made to recover the principal components – especially iron. Since mining began, an enormous amount of research effort has been devoted to seeking uses for the residue. 

Many studies have been conducted to develop uses of red mud.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kumar|first=Sanjay|last2=Kumar|first2=Rakesh|last3=Bandopadhyay|first3=Amitava|date=2006-10-01|title=Innovative methodologies for the utilisation of wastes from metallurgical and allied industries|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344906000401|journal=Resources, Conservation and Recycling|volume=48|issue=4|pages=301–314|doi=10.1016/j.resconrec.2006.03.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 2 to 3 million tonnes are used annually in the production of cement,&lt;ref&gt;Y.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13874">'''Scientific consensus''' is the collective judgment, position, and opinion of the [[scientific community|community]] of [[scientist]]s in a [[Scientific discipline|particular field]] of study. Consensus implies general agreement, though not necessarily unanimity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenfacts.org/glossary/abc/consensus.htm|title=Scientific Consensus|publisher=Green Facts|accessdate=October 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Consensus]] is normally achieved through communication  at conferences, the  publication process, replication (reproducible results by others), and [[peer review]]. These lead to a situation in which those within the discipline can often recognize such a consensus where it exists, but communicating to outsiders that consensus has been reached can be difficult, because the 'normal' debates through which science progresses may seem to outsiders as contestation.&lt;ref name="Shwed and Bearman 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Shwed Uri|author2=Peter Bearman|url=http://asr.sagepub.com/content/75/6/817.full.pdf+html|title=The Temporal Structure of Scientific Consensus Formation|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=75|issue=6|date=December 2010|pages=817–40|accessdate=18 December 2010|ref=harv|doi=10.1177/0003122410388488|pmc=3163460 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; On occasion, scientific institutes issue position statements intended to communicate a summary of the science from the "inside" to the "outside" of the scientific community. In cases where there is little controversy regarding the subject under study, establishing what the consensus is can be quite straightforward.

Scientific consensus may be invoked in popular or political debate on subjects that are controversial within the public sphere but which may not be controversial within the scientific community, such as [[evolution]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=Statement on the Teaching of Evolution|url=http://www.aaas.org/news/releases/2006/pdf/0219boardstatement.pdf |publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science |date=2006-02-16 |accessdate=2008-05-02|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=NSTA Position Statement: The Teaching of Evolution|url=http://www.nsta.org/about/positions/evolution.aspx|publisher=National Science Teacher Association |accessdate=2008-05-02|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scientific opinion on climate change#Scientific consensus|climate change]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://nationalacademies.org/onpi/06072005.pdf "Joint Science Academies' Statement"]&lt;/ref&gt; or the lack of a link between [[MMR vaccine controversy|MMR vaccinations and autism]].&lt;ref name="Shwed and Bearman 2010" /&gt;

== Change of consensus over time ==
{{See also|Theories and sociology of the history of science}}
There are many philosophical and historical theories as to how scientific consensus changes over time. Because the history of scientific change is extremely complicated, and because there is a tendency to project "winners" and "losers" onto the past in relation to our ''current'' scientific consensus, it is very difficult to come up with accurate and rigorous models for scientific change.&lt;ref name="Pickering 1993"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Pickering| first= Andrew| authorlink=Andrew Pickering |title = The Mangle of Practice | year = 1995 |publisher = Chicago University Press | location = IL | isbn = 0-226-66802-9 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is made exceedingly difficult also in part because each of the various branches of science functions in somewhat different ways with different forms of evidence and experimental approaches.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

Most models of scientific change rely on new data produced by scientific [[experiment]]. [[Karl Popper]] proposed that since no amount of experiments could ever ''prove'' a scientific theory, but a single experiment could ''disprove'' one, science should be based on [[falsifiability|falsification]].&lt;ref name="PopperLSR"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Popper| first= Karl Raimund| authorlink=Karl Popper |title = The Logic of Scientific Discovery | year = 1934 | edition = 2002| publisher = Routledge Classics | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-415-27844-7 | ref=harv }} Originally published in German as {{cite book |title=Logik der Forschung: zur Erkenntnistheorie der modenen Naturwissenschaft |series=Schriften zur Wissenschaftlichen Weltauffassung |year=1935 |publisher=Springer | location=Vienna |oclc=220936200|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst this forms a logical theory for science, it is in a sense "timeless" and does not necessarily reflect a view on how science should progress over time.

Among the most influential challengers of this approach was [[Thomas Kuhn]], who argued instead that experimental [[data]] always provide some data which cannot fit completely into a theory, and that falsification alone did not result in scientific change or an undermining of scientific consensus. He proposed that scientific consensus worked in the form of "[[paradigm]]s", which were interconnected theories and underlying assumptions about the nature of the theory itself which connected various researchers in a given field. Kuhn argued that only after the accumulation of many "significant" anomalies would scientific consensus enter a period of "crisis". At this point, new theories would be sought out, and eventually one paradigm would triumph over the old one – a series of [[paradigm shift]]s rather than a linear progression towards truth. Kuhn's model also emphasized more clearly the social and personal aspects of theory change, demonstrating through historical examples that scientific consensus was never truly a matter of pure logic or pure facts.&lt;ref name="KuhnSSR"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Kuhn| first= Thomas S. |title=[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]] |year = 1962 | edition = 1996| pages=| publisher = University of Chicago Press, Chicago| isbn = 978-0-226-45808-3 | ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these periods of 'normal' and 'crisis' science are not mutually exclusive. Research shows that these are different modes of practice, more than different historical periods.&lt;ref name="Shwed and Bearman 2010" /&gt;

==Perception and public opinion==
Perception of whether a scientific consensus exists on a given issue, and how strong that conception is, has been described as a "gateway belief" upon which other beliefs and then action are based.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Scientists are from Mars, Laypeople are from Venus: An Evidence-Based Rationale for Communicating the Consensus on Climate|journal=Reports of the National Center for Science Education|date=November-December 2014|volume=34|issue=6|url=http://reports.ncse.com/index.php/rncse/article/viewFile/347/599}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Politicization of science ==
{{Main article|Politicization of science}}

In public policy debates, the assertion that there exists a consensus of scientists in a particular field is often used as an argument for the validity of a theory and as support for a course of action by those who stand to gain from a policy based on that consensus. Similarly arguments for a ''lack'' of scientific consensus are often encouraged by sides who stand to gain from a more ambiguous policy.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

For example, the [[scientific opinion on climate change|scientific consensus on the causes of global warming]] is that global surface temperatures have increased in recent decades and that the trend is caused primarily by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases.&lt;ref name="OreskesBeyondTheIvoryTower"&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Oreskes| first = Naomi| authorlink = Naomi Oreskes| title = Beyond the Ivory Tower: The Scientific Consensus on Climate Change| journal = Science| volume = 306| page = 1686| date = December 2004| url =http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/306/5702/1686| doi = 10.1126/science.1103618| pmid = 15576594| issue = 5702}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "AmericasClimateChoices-2010-SciPanel"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher=The National Academies Press| isbn = 0-309-14588-0| last = America's Climate Choices: Panel on Advancing the Science of Climate Change; National Research Council| title = Advancing the Science of Climate Change| location = Washington, D.C.| year = 2010| url = http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12782}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USNAS-2008-ClimateChoices"&gt;{{cite web | title = Understanding and Responding to Climate Change| url = http://dels-old.nas.edu/dels/rpt_briefs/climate_change_2008_final.pdf|publisher=[[United States National Academy of Sciences]]|accessdate=30 May 2010|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[history of science and technology|historian of science]] [[Naomi Oreskes]] published an article in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' reporting that a survey of the abstracts of 928 science articles published between 1993 and 2003 showed none which disagreed explicitly with the notion of [[anthropogenic global warming]].&lt;ref name="Oreskes_science"&gt;Naomi Oreskes, "[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/306/5702/1686 The Scientific Consensus on Climate Change.]" ''Science'' 306:5702 (3 December 2004): p. 1686. Accessed 7 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In an editorial published in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', Oreskes stated that those who opposed these scientific findings are amplifying the normal range of scientific uncertainty about any facts into an appearance that there is a great scientific disagreement, or a lack of scientific consensus.&lt;ref name="Oreskes_washpost"&gt;Naomi Oreskes, "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A26065-2004Dec25.html Undeniable Global Warming.]" ''The Washington Post'' (26 December 2004): B07.&lt;/ref&gt; Oreskes's findings were replicated by other methods that require no interpretation.&lt;ref name="Shwed and Bearman 2010" /&gt;

The theory of [[evolution|evolution through natural selection]] is also supported by an overwhelming scientific consensus; it is one of the most reliable and empirically tested theories in science.&lt;ref name="NAS"&gt;{{cite book |author=National Academy of Science Institute of Medicine | title=Science, Evolution, and Creationism | publisher=National Academy Press | year=2008|isbn=0-309-10586-2 | url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=11876}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"That this controversy is one largely manufactured by the proponents of creationism and intelligent design may not matter, and as long as the controversy is taught in classes on current affairs, politics, or religion, and not in science classes, neither scientists nor citizens should be concerned." [http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/354/21/2277 Intelligent Judging – Evolution in the Classroom and the Courtroom] George J. Annas, [[New England Journal of Medicine]], Volume 354:2277–81  May 25, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of evolution claim that there is significant dissent on evolution within the scientific community.&lt;ref name="gould"&gt;Stephen Jay Gould, "[http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_fact-and-theory.html Evolution as Fact and Theory,]" May 1981; in ''Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes.'' New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1994: 253–62.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[wedge strategy]], a plan to promote [[intelligent design]], depended greatly on seeding and building on public perceptions of absence of consensus on evolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antievolution.org/features/wedge.pdf "The Wedge Document"] Discovery Institute, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

The inherent [[uncertainty in science]], where theories are never ''proven'' but can only be ''disproven'' (see [[falsifiability]]), poses a problem for politicians, policymakers, lawyers, and business professionals. Where scientific or philosophical questions can often languish in uncertainty for decades within their disciplinary settings, policymakers are faced with the problems of making sound decisions based on the currently available data, even if it is likely not a final form of the "truth". The tricky part is discerning what is close enough to "final truth". For example, social action against smoking probably came too long after science was 'pretty consensual'.&lt;ref name="Shwed and Bearman 2010" /&gt;

Certain domains, such as the approval of certain technologies for public consumption, can have vast and far-reaching political, economic, and human effects should things run awry with the predictions of scientists. However, insofar as there is an expectation that policy in a given field reflect knowable and pertinent data and well-accepted models of the relationships between observable phenomena, there is little good alternative for policy makers than to rely on so much of what may fairly be called 'the scientific consensus' in guiding policy design and implementation, at least in circumstances where the need for policy intervention is compelling. While science cannot supply 'absolute truth' (or even its complement 'absolute error') its utility is bound up with the capacity to guide policy in the direction of increased public good and away from public harm. Seen in this way, the demand that policy rely only on what is proven to be "scientific truth" would be a prescription for policy paralysis and amount in practice to advocacy of acceptance of all of the quantified and unquantified costs and risks associated with policy inaction.&lt;ref name="Shwed and Bearman 2010" /&gt;

No part of policy formation on the basis of the ostensible scientific consensus precludes persistent review either of the relevant scientific consensus or the tangible results of policy. Indeed, the same reasons that drove reliance upon the consensus drives the continued evaluation of this reliance over time – and adjusting policy as needed.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2612">A '''short-term exposure limit''' ('''STEL''') is the acceptable average exposure over a short period of time, usually 15 minutes as long as the time-weighted average is not exceeded.  

STEL is a term used in [[occupational health]], [[industrial hygiene]] and [[toxicology]].  The STEL may be a [[law|legal]] limit in the [[United States]] for exposure of an employee to a [[chemical substance]].  The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (U.S. OSHA) has set OSHA-STELs for [[1,3-Butadiene]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=10087 29CFR1910.1051]&lt;/ref&gt; [[benzene]]   &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=10042 29CFR1910.1028]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[ethylene oxide]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=10070 29CFR1910.1047]&lt;/ref&gt;  For chemicals, STEL assessments are usually done for 15 minutes and expressed in [[parts per million]] (ppm), or sometimes in [[milligram]]s per cubic meter (mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).

The [[American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists]] publishes a more extensive list of  STELs as [[threshold limit value]]s (TLV-STEL).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acgih.org/home.htm American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Slovak Radio Building''' ({{lang-sk|Budova Slovenského rozhlasu}}) is located in [[Bratislava]].

It is shaped like an upside down [[Pyramid|pyramid]]. Architects of this project were [[Štefan Svetko]], [[Štefan Ďurkovič]] and [[Barnabáš Kissling]] and it was completed in 1983. The project began in 1967. The building is 80 metres high and has a 522-seat concert hall with a large concert organ. The first test broadcast was made in 1984 and regular broadcasting began on 27 March 1985.

The building was included in a list of the 30 ugliest buildings in the world,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/propertypicturegalleries/9126031/Are-these-the-ugliest-buildings-in-the-world.html?frame=2159738&lt;/ref&gt; but has been defended by Slovak architects.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thedaily.sk/slovak-radio-building-classed-among-ugliest-in-world/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27316">The environmental '''[[sustainability]]''' problem has proven difficult to solve. The modern [[environmental movement]] has attempted to solve the problem in a large variety of ways. But little progress has been made, as shown by severe [[ecological footprint]] overshoot and lack of sufficient progress on the [[climate change]] problem. Something within the human system is preventing change to a sustainable mode of behavior. That system trait is '''systemic change resistance'''. Change resistance is also known as organizational resistance, barriers to change, or policy resistance.&lt;ref&gt;John Sterman, "Business Dynamics: Systems Thinking and Modeling for a Complex World, 2000, pp 5-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview of resistance to solving the sustainability problem==

While environmentalism had long been a minor force in political change, the movement strengthened significantly in the 1970s with the first [[Earth Day]] in 1970, in which over 20 million people participated, with publication of ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' in 1972, and with the first [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]] in Stockholm in 1972. Early expectations the problem could be solved ran high. 114 out of 132 members of the United Nations attended the Stockholm conference. The conference was widely seen at the time as a harbinger of success:&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Encyclopedia, Second Edition, W. P. Cunningham et al., editors, 1998, page 1054.&lt;/ref&gt;

: "Many believe the most important result of the conference was the precedent it set for international cooperation in addressing environmental degradation. The nations attending agreed they shared responsibility for the quality of the environment, particularly the oceans and the atmosphere, and they signed a declaration of principles, after extensive negotiations, concerning their obligations. The conference also approved an environmental fund and an ‘action program,’ which involved 200 specific recommendations for addressing such problems as global climate change, [[marine pollution]], population growth, the dumping of toxic wastes, and the preservation of biodiversity. A permanent environment unit was established for coordinating these and other international efforts. [This later became] the United Nations Environmental Program [which was] was formally approved by the General Assembly later that same year and its base established in Nairobi, Kenya. This organization not only coordinated action but monitored research, collecting and disseminating information, and it has played an ongoing role in international negotiations about environmental issues.

:"The conference in Stockholm accomplished almost everything the preparatory committed had planned. It was widely considered successful, and many observers were almost euphoric about the extent of agreement."

However, despite the work of a worldwide [[environmental movement]], many national environmental protection agencies, creation of the [[United Nations Environment Programme]], and many international environmental treaties, the sustainability problem continues to grow worse. The latest [[ecological footprint]] data shows the world’s footprint increased from about 50% ''undershoot'' in 1961 to 50% ''overshoot'' in 2007, the last year data is available.&lt;ref&gt;John Talbert et al., The Genuine Progress Indicator 2006, A Tool for Sustainable Development, Redefining Progress, The Nature of Economics, 2006, available at [http://www.rprogress.org/publications/2007/GPI%202006.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972 the first edition of ''The Limits to Growth'' analyzed the environmental sustainability problem using a [[system dynamics]] model. The widely influential book predicted that:&lt;ref&gt;"The Limits to Growth", Meadows et al., 1972, p23.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"If the present trends in world population, industrialization, pollution, food production, and resource depletion continue unchanged, the limits to growth on this planet will be reached sometime within the next one hundred years. The most probable result will be a rather sudden and uncontrollable decline in both population and industrial capacity some time in the 21st century."

Yet thirty-two years later in 2004 the third edition reported that:&lt;ref&gt;"Limits to Growth", Meadows et al., 2004, p xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"[The second edition of Limits to Growth] was published in 1992, the year of the global summit on environment and development in Rio de Janeiro. The advent of the summit seemed to prove that global society had decided to deal seriously with the important environmental problems. But we now know that humanity failed to achieve the goals of Rio. The Rio plus 10 conference in Johannesburg in 2002 produced even less; it was almost paralyzed by a variety of ideological and economic disputes, [due to] the efforts of those pursuing their narrow national, corporate, or individual self-interests.

:"...humanity has largely squandered the past 30 years."

Change resistance runs so high that the world’s top two greenhouse gas emitters, [[China]] and the [[United States]], have never adopted the [[Kyoto Protocol]] treaty. In the US resistance was so strong that in 1999 the US Senate voted 95 to zero against the treaty by passing the [[Byrd–Hagel Resolution]], despite the fact [[Al Gore]] was vice-president at the time. Not a single senator could be persuaded to support the treaty, which has not been brought back to the floor since.

Due to prolonged change resistance, the climate change problem has escalated to the climate change crisis. [[Greenhouse gas]] emissions are rising much faster than [[IPCC]] models expected: “The growth rate of [fossil fuel] emissions was 3.5% per year for 2000-2007, an almost four fold increase from 0.9% per year in 1990-1999. … This makes current trends in emissions higher than the worst case IPCC-SRES scenario.” &lt;ref&gt;"Emissions rising faster this decade than last", CISIRO Media Release, September 25, 2008, available at [http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/global/pdf/Press%20Release_CSIRO_Australia_final.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Copenhagen Climate Summit]] of December 2009 ended in failure.&lt;ref name="Hartwell"&gt;"The Hartwell Paper", Prins, Gwrn et al., May 2010, available at [http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/27939/1/HartwellPaper_English_version.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt; No agreement on binding targets was reached. The [[Cancun climate summit|Cancun Climate Summit]] in December 2010 did not break the deadlock. The best it could do was another non-binding agreement:&lt;ref&gt;Outcome of the work of the Ad Hoc Working Group on long-term Cooperative Action under the Convention, 2010, available at [http://unfccc.int/files/meetings/cop_16/application/pdf/cop16_lca.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

:“Recognizing that climate change represents an urgent and potentially irreversible threat to human societies and the planet, and thus requires to be urgently addressed by all Parties.”

This indicates no progress at all since 1992, when the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] was created at the [[Earth Summit]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. The 2010 Cancun agreement was the functional equivalent of what the 1992 agreement said:&lt;ref&gt;''United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change'', United Nations, 1992, p2-4, available at [http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/convkp/conveng.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

:"The Parties to this Convention... [acknowledge] that the global nature of climate change calls for the widest possible cooperation by all countries and their participation in an effective and appropriate international response.... [thus the parties recognize] that States should enact effective environmental legislation... [to] protect the climate system for the benefit of present and future generations of humankind...."

Negotiations have bogged down so pervasively that: “Climate policy is gridlocked, and there’s virtually no chance of a breakthrough.” &lt;ref&gt;“Disaster at the Top of the World”, Thomas Homer-Dixon, New York Times, August 22, 2010, available at [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/23/opinion/23homer-dixon.html?_r=1&amp;hp=&amp;pagewanted=all].&lt;/ref&gt; “Climate policy, as it has been understood and practised by many governments of the world under the Kyoto Protocol approach, has failed to produce any discernible real world reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases in fifteen years.” &lt;ref name="Hartwell" /&gt;

These events suggest that change resistance to solving the sustainability problem is so high the problem is currently unsolvable.

==The change resistance and proper coupling subproblems==

Understanding change resistance requires seeing it as a distinct and separate part of the sustainability problem. Tanya Markvart’s 2009 thesis on ''Understanding Institutional Change and Resistance to Change Towards Sustainability'' stated that:&lt;ref name="Markvart"&gt;Tanya I. Markvart, ''Understanding Institutional Change and Resistance to Change Towards Sustainability: An Interdisciplinary Theoretical Framework and Illustrative Application to Provincial-Municipal Aggregates Policy'', 2009, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, pages 4, iii, and 157. Available at [http://www.environment.uwaterloo.ca/research/biosphere/Documents/Markvart_Tanya_000.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

:"It has also been demonstrated that ecologically destructive and inequitable institutional systems can be highly resilient and resistant to change, even in the face of social-ecological degradation and/or collapse (e.g., Berkes &amp; Folke, 2002; Allison &amp; Hobbs, 2004; Brown, 2005; Runnalls, 2008; Finley, 2009; Walker et al., 2009)."

The thesis focuses specifically on developing “an interdisciplinary theoretical framework for understanding institutional change and resistance to change towards sustainability.”

Jack Harich's 2010 paper on ''Change Resistance as the Crux of the Environmental Sustainability Problem'' argues there are two separate problems to solve.&lt;ref name="Harich"&gt;Jack Harich, [http://www.thwink.org/sustain/articles/009/ChangeResistanceAsCrux.htm “Change Resistance as the Crux of the Environmental Sustainability Problem”], ''System Dynamics Review'', January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[root cause analysis]] and a [[system dynamics]] model were used to explain how:

:"...difficult social problems [like sustainability must be decomposed] into two sequential subproblems: (1) ''How to overcome change resistance'' and then (2) ''How to achieve proper coupling''. This is the timeless strategy of divide and conquer. By cleaving one big problem into two, the problem becomes an order of magnitude easier to solve, because we can approach the two subproblems differently and much more appropriately. We are no longer unknowingly attempting to solve two very different problems simultaneously."

The paper discussed the two subproblems:

: "''Change resistance'' is the tendency for a system to continue its current behavior, despite the application of force to change that behavior.

: "''Proper coupling'' occurs when the behavior of one system affects the behavior of other systems in a desirable manner, using the appropriate [[feedback loops]], so the systems work together in harmony in accordance with design objectives. … In the environmental sustainability problem the human system has become improperly coupled to the greater system it lives within: the environment.

:"Change resistance versus proper coupling allows a crucial distinction. Society is aware of the proper practices required to live sustainably and the need to do so. But society has a strong aversion to adopting these practices. As a result, problem solvers have created thousands of effective (and often ingenious) proper practices. But they are stymied in their attempts to have them taken up by enough of the system to solve the problem because an 'implicit system goal' is causing insurmountable change resistance. ''Therefore systemic change resistance is the crux of the problem and must be solved first.''"
 
The proper coupling subproblem is what most people consider as “the” problem to solve. It is called [[Decoupling (organizational studies)|decoupling]] in economic and environmental fields, where the term refers to economic growth without additional environmental degradation. Solving the proper coupling problem is the goal of environmentalism and in particular [[ecological economics]]: “Ecological economics is the study of the interactions and co-evolution in time and space of human economies and the ecosystems in which human economies are embedded.” &lt;ref&gt;The New Pelgrave Dictionary of Economics Online, [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_E000221&amp;edition=current&amp;q=ecological%20economics&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=1/ abstract].&lt;/ref&gt;

Change resistance is also called barriers to change. Hoffman and Bazerman, in a chapter on “Understanding and overcoming the organizational and psychological barriers to action,” concluded that:&lt;ref&gt;"Organizations and the Sustainability Mosaic: Crafting Long-Term Ecological and Societal Solutions", Sharma, S. et al., (Ed), 2007. Chapter 4, Hoffman, A. J., and Bazerman, M. H., "Changing practice on sustainability: Understanding and overcoming the organizational and psychological barriers to action," p85.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"In this chapter, we argue that the change in thinking required of the sustainability agenda will never come to fruition within practical domains unless proper attention is given to the sources of individual and social resistance to such change. The implementation of wise management practices cannot be accomplished without a concurrent set of strategies for surmounting these barriers."

[[John Sterman]], current leader of the system dynamics school of thought, came to the same conclusion:&lt;ref&gt;John Sterman, 2008. "Risk Communication on Climate Change: Mental Models and Mass Balance." ''Science'', October 2008, vol. 322, no. 5901, pp 532-533.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"The civil rights movement provides a better analogy for the climate challenge. Then, as now, entrenched special interests vigorously opposed change. … Of course, we need more research and technical innovation—money and genius are always in short supply. But there is no purely technical solution for climate change. For public policy to be grounded in the hard-won results of climate science, we must now turn our attention to the dynamics of social and political change."

These findings indicate there are at least two subproblems to be solved: change resistance and proper coupling. Given the human system’s long history of unsuccessful attempts to self-correct to a sustainable mode, it appears that high change resistance is preventing proper coupling. This may be expressed as an emerging principle: systemic change resistance is the crux of the sustainability problem and must be solved first, before the human system can be properly coupled to the greater system it lives within, the environment.

==Systemic versus individual change resistance==

Systemic change resistance differs significantly from individual change resistance. “Systemic means originating from the system in such a manner as to affect the behavior of most or all social agents of certain types, as opposed to originating from individual agents.” &lt;ref name="Harich" /&gt; Individual change resistance originates from individual people and organizations. How the two differ may be seen in this passage:&lt;ref&gt;Dent, Eric and Goldberg, Susan. 1999. ''Challenging Resistance to Change'', The Journal of Applied Behavioral Science, Vol. 35, No. 1, 25-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"The notion of resistance to change is credited to Kurt Lewin. His conceptualization of the phrase, however, is very different from today’s usage. [which treats resistance to change as a psychological concept, where resistance or support of change comes from values, habits, mental models, and so on residing within the individual] For Lewin, resistance to change could occur, but that resistance could be anywhere in the system. As Kotter (1995) found, ''it is possible for the resistance to be sited within the individual, but it is much more likely to be found elsewhere in the system. ''

:"Systems of social roles, with their associated patterns of attitudes, expectations, and behavior norms, share with biological systems the characteristic of homeostasis—i.e., tendencies to resist change, to restore the previous state after a disturbance.

:"Lewin had been working on this idea, that the status quo represented an equilibrium between the barriers to change and the forces favoring change, since 1928 as part of his field theory. He believed that some difference in these forces—weakening of the barriers or strengthening of the driving forces—was required to produce the unfreezing that began a change."

If sources of systemic change resistance are present, they are the principal cause of individual change resistance. According to the [[fundamental attribution error]] it is crucial to address systemic change resistance when present and avoid assuming that change resistance can be overcome by bargaining, reasoning, inspirational appeals, and so on. This is because:&lt;ref&gt;John Sterman, "Business Dynamics: Systems Thinking and Modeling for a Complex World, 2000, p28.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"A fundamental principle of system dynamics states that the structure of the system gives rise to its behavior. However, people have a strong tendency to attribute the behavior of others to dispositional rather than situational factors, that is, to character and especially character flaws rather than the system in which these people are acting. The tendency to blame the person rather than the system is so strong psychologists call it the 'fundamental attribution error.' "

[[Peter Senge]], a thought leader of [[systems thinking]] for the business world, describes the structural source of systemic change resistance as being due to an “implicit system goal:” &lt;ref&gt;Peter Senge, ''The Fifth Discipline'', 1990, p88.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"In general, balancing loops are more difficult to see than reinforcing loops because it often looks like nothing is happening. There’s no dramatic growth of sales and marketing expenditures, or nuclear arms, or lily pads. Instead, the balancing process maintains the status quo, even when all participants want change. The feeling, as Lewis Carroll’s Queen of Hearts put it, of needing ‘all the running you can do to keep in the same place’ is a clue that a balancing loop may exist nearby.

:"Leaders who attempt organizational change often find themselves unwittingly caught in balancing processes. To the leaders, it looks as though their efforts are clashing with sudden resistance that seems to come from nowhere. In fact, as my friend found when he tried to reduce burnout, the resistance is a response by the system, trying to maintain an ''implicit system goal''. Until this goal is recognized, the change effort is ''doomed to failure.''"

Senge’s insight applies to the sustainability problem. Until the “implicit system goal” causing systemic change resistance is found and resolved, change efforts to solve the proper coupling part of the sustainability problem may be, as Senge argues, “doomed to failure.”

==The current focus is on proper coupling==

Presently environmentalism is focused on solving the proper coupling subproblem. For example, the following are all proper coupling solutions. They attempt to solve the direct cause of the sustainability problem’s symptoms:
* The [[Kyoto Protocol]]
* The [[Waste hierarchy|Three Rs]] of reduce, reuse, recycle
* More use of [[renewable energy]]
* Better [[pollution control]] of many kinds
* Collective management of [[common-pool resources]]
* Certification programs to reduce deforestation such as [[Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification|PEFC]] and [[Forest Stewardship Council|FSC]]
* [[Contour farming]] to reduce soil erosion
* The [[green revolution]]
* [[Zero population growth]]

The direct cause of environmental impact is the three factors on the right side of the [[I PAT|I=PAT equation]] where '''I'''mpact equals '''P'''opulation times '''A'''ffluence (consumption per person) times '''T'''echnology (environmental impact per unit of consumption). It is these three factors that solutions like those listed above seek to reduce.

The top environmental organization in the world, the [[United Nations Environmental Programme]] (UNEP), focuses exclusively on proper coupling solutions:&lt;ref&gt;UNEP 2010 Annual Report, p8, Available at [http://www.unep.org/annualreport/2010/pdfs/UNEP-AR-2010-FULL-REPORT.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

:"2010 marked the beginning of a period of new, strategic and transformational direction for UNEP as it began implementing its Medium Term Strategy (MTS) for 2010-2013 across six areas: Climate change; Disasters and conflicts; Ecosystem management; Environmental governance; Harmful substances and hazardous waste; Resource efficiency, Sustainable consumption and production."

The six areas are all direct practices to reduce the three factors of the I=PAT equation.
 
[[Al Gore]]s' 2006 documentary film ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]'' described the climate change problem and the urgency of solving it. The film concluded with Gore saying:

:"Each one of us is a cause of global warming, but each one of us can make choices to change that with the things we buy, the electricity we use, the cars we drive; we can make choices to bring our individual carbon emissions to zero. The solutions are in our hands, ''we just have to have the determination to make it happen. We have everything that we need to reduce carbon emissions, everything but political will. '' But in America, the will to act is a renewable resource."

The four solutions Gore mentions are proper coupling practices. There is, however, a hint of acknowledgement that overcoming systemic change resistance is the real challenge, when Gore says “...we just have to have the determination to make it happen. We have everything that we need to reduce carbon emissions, everything but political will.”

The twenty-seven solutions that appear during the film’s closing credits are mostly proper coupling solutions. The first nine are:&lt;ref&gt;''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]'': Closing Credits, available at [http://www.folklib.net/index/wi/ait_closing_credits.shtml].&lt;/ref&gt;

* Go to [http://www.climatecrisis.net www.climatecrisis.net]
* You can reduce your carbon emissions. In fact, you can even reduce your carbon emissions to zero.
* Buy energy efficient appliances &amp; light bulbs.
* Change your thermostat (and use clock thermostats) to reduce energy for heating &amp; cooling.
* Weatherize your house, increase insulation, get an energy audit.
* Recycle.
* If you can, buy a hybrid car.
* When you can, walk or ride a bicycle.
* Where you can, use light rail &amp; mass transit.

Some solutions are attempts to overcome individual change resistance, such as:

* Tell your parents not to ruin the world that you will live in.
* If you are a parent, join with your children to save the world they will live in.
* Vote for leaders who pledge to solve this crisis.
* Write to congress. If they don’t listen, run for congress.
* Speak up in your community.

However none of the twenty-seven solutions deal with overcoming systemic change resistance.

==Overcoming systemic change resistance==

Efforts here are sparse because environmentalism is currently not oriented toward treating systemic change resistance as a distinct and separate problem to solve.

On how to specifically overcome the change resistance subproblem, Markvart examined two leading theories that seemed to offer insight into change resistance, [[Panarchy]] theory and [[New institutionalism|New Institutionalism]], and concluded that:&lt;ref name="Markvart" /&gt;

:"...neither theory devotes significant attention to understanding the dynamics of resilient and resistant but inefficient and/or unproductive institutional and ecological systems. Overall, more research is required...."

Taking a [[root cause analysis]] and [[system dynamics]] modeling approach, Harich carefully defined the three characteristics of a [[root cause]] and then found a main systemic root cause for both the change resistance and proper coupling subproblems.&lt;ref name="Harich" /&gt; Several sample solution elements for resolving the root causes were suggested. The point was made that the exact solution policies chosen do not matter nearly as much as finding the correct systemic root causes. Once these are found, how to resolve them is relatively obvious because once a root cause is found by structural modeling, the high leverage point for resolving it follows easily. Solutions may then push on specific structural points in the social system, which due to careful modeling will have fairly predictable effects.

This reaffirms the work of [[Donella Meadows]], as expressed in her classic essay on [[Twelve leverage points|Leverage Points: Places to Intervene in a System]]. The final page stated that:

:"The higher the leverage point, the more the system will resist changing it."

Here Meadows refers to the leverage point for resolving the proper coupling subproblem rather than the leverage point for overcoming change resistance. This is because the current focus of environmentalism is on proper coupling.

However, if the leverage points associated with the root causes of change resistance exist and can be found, the system will not resist changing them. This is an important principle of social system behavior.

For example, Harich found the main root cause of successful systemic change resistance to be high "deception effectiveness." The source was special interests, particularly large for-profit corporations. The high leverage point was raising "general ability to detect manipulative deception." This can be done with a variety of solution elements, such as "The Truth Test." This effectively increases truth literacy, just as conventional education raises reading and writing [[literacy]]. Few citizens resist literacy education because its benefits have become so obvious.

Promotion of [[corporate social responsibility]] (CSR) has been used to try to overcome change resistance to solving social problems, including environmental sustainability. This solution strategy has not worked well because it is voluntary and does not resolve root causes. [[Milton Friedman]] explained why CSR fails: "The social responsibility of business is to increase profits." &lt;ref&gt;"The Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase its Profits", Milton Friedman, September 13, 1970, ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'', available at [http://www.colorado.edu/studentgroups/libertarians/issues/friedman-soc-resp-business.html].&lt;/ref&gt; Business cannot be responsible to society. It can only be responsible to its shareholders.

'''Sustainable development''' is the [[organizing principle]] for meeting [[Human development (humanity)|human development]] goals while at the same time [[Sustainability|sustaining]] the ability of natural systems to provide the [[natural resource]]s and [[ecosystem services]] upon which the [[economy]] and [[society]] depend. The desired result is a state of society where living conditions and resource use continue to meet human needs without undermining the integrity and stability of the natural system. Sustainable development can be classified as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations.

While the modern concept of sustainable development is derived mostly from the 1987 [[Brundtland Commission|Brundtland Report]], it is also rooted in earlier ideas about [[sustainable forest management]] and twentieth century environmental concerns. As the concept developed, it has shifted to focus more on [[economic development]], [[Social change|social development]] and environmental protection for future generations. It has been suggested that "the term 'sustainability' should be viewed as humanity's target goal of human-ecosystem equilibrium (homeostasis), while 'sustainable development' refers to the holistic approach and temporal processes that lead us to the end point of sustainability".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Shaker |first=Richard Ross |date=September 2015 |title=The spatial distribution of development in Europe and its underlying sustainability correlations |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143622815001745 |journal=Applied Geography |volume=63 |pages=&lt;!-- 304–314 --&gt; |at=p. 35 |doi=10.1016/j.apgeog.2015.07.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern economies are endeavouring to reconcile ambitious economic development and obligations of preserving the [[natural resource]]s and [[Ecosystem services|ecosystem]], the two are traditionally seen as of conflicting nature. Instead of holding climate change commitments and other sustainability measures as a drug to economic development, turning and leveraging them into market opportunities will do greater good. The economic development brought by such organized principles and practices in an [[economy]] is called Managed Sustainable Development (MSD).

The concept of sustainable development has been—and still is—subject to criticism, including the question of what is to be sustained in sustainable development. It has been argued{{weasel inline|date=October 2018}} that there is no such thing as a sustainable use of a [[non-renewable resource]], since any positive rate of exploitation will eventually lead to the exhaustion of earth's finite stock. The United Nations organized an international conference in Stockholm, Sweden from 5 to 16 June 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un-documents.net/unchedec.htm|title=Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment - A/CONF.48/14/Rev.1 Chapter I - UN Documents: Gathering a body of global agreements|last=Environment|first=United Nations Conference on the Human|website=www.un-documents.net|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sustainability can be defined as the practice of maintaining processes of productivity indefinitely—natural or human made—by replacing resources used with resources of equal or greater value without degrading or endangering natural biotic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Communicating Sustainability for the Green Economy|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|year=2014|isbn=978-0-7656-3680-5|location=New York|author=Lynn R.

[[Sustainability science]] is the study of the concepts of sustainable development and environmental science. There is an additional focus on the present generations' responsibility to regenerate, maintain and improve planetary resources for use by future generations.&lt;ref name=Finn-2009&gt;{{cite book|last=Finn|first=Donovan|title=Our Uncertain Future: Can Good Planning Create Sustainable Communities?|publisher=University of Illinois|location=Champaign-Urbana|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|3-8}}

Sustainable development has its roots in ideas about [[sustainable forest management]] which were developed in Europe during the 17th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref name="Grober2"&gt;Ulrich Grober: Deep roots&amp;nbsp;— A conceptual history of "sustainable development" (Nachhaltigkeit), Wissenschaftszentrum Berlin für Sozialforschung, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blewitt-2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blewitt|first1=John|title=Understanding Sustainable Development|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780415707824|edition=2nd|url=https://www.routledge.com/Understanding-Sustainable-Development-2nd-Edition/Blewitt/p/book/9780415707824|accessdate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|6-16}} In response to a growing awareness of the depletion of timber resources in England, [[John Evelyn]] argued that "sowing and planting of trees had to be regarded as a national duty of every landowner, in order to stop the destructive over-exploitation of natural resources" in his 1662 essay ''[[Sylva, or A Discourse of Forest-Trees and the Propagation of Timber|Sylva]]''. In 1713 [[Hans Carl von Carlowitz]], a senior mining administrator in the service of Elector [[Augustus II the Strong|Frederick Augustus I of Saxony]] published ''Sylvicultura oeconomica'', a 400-page work on forestry. Building upon the ideas of Evelyn and French minister [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]], von Carlowitz developed the concept of managing forests for [[sustained yield]].&lt;ref name="Grober2" /&gt; His work influenced others, including [[Alexander von Humboldt]] and [[Georg Ludwig Hartig]], eventually leading to the development of a science of forestry. This in turn influenced people like [[Gifford Pinchot]], first head of the [[US Forest Service]], whose approach to forest management was driven by the idea of wise use of resources, and [[Aldo Leopold]] whose [[land ethic]] was influential in the development of the [[environmental movement]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Grober2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Blewitt-2015"/&gt;

Following the publication of [[Rachel Carson]]'s ''[[Silent Spring]]'' in 1962, the developing environmental movement drew attention to the relationship between economic growth and development and environmental degradation. [[Kenneth E. Boulding]] in his influential 1966 essay ''The Economics of the Coming Spaceship Earth'' identified the need for the economic system to fit itself to the ecological system with its limited pools of resources.&lt;ref name="Blewitt-2015"/&gt; One of the first uses of the term sustainable in the contemporary sense was by the [[Club of Rome]] in 1972 in its classic report on the ''[[Limits to Growth]]'', written by a group of scientists led by [[Dennis Meadows|Dennis]] and [[Donella Meadows]] of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. Describing the desirable "state of global equilibrium", the authors wrote: "We are searching for a model output that represents a world system that is sustainable without sudden and uncontrolled collapse and capable of satisfying the basic material requirements of all of its people."&lt;ref name=Finn-2009/&gt;

Following the Club of Rome report, an MIT research group prepared ten days of hearings on "[http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/MIT/Growth%20and%20Its%20Implications.pdf Growth and Its Implication for the Future]" (Roundtable Press, 1973)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/MIT/Growth%20and%20Its%20Implications.pdf|title=Growth and its implications for the future|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the US Congress, the first hearings ever held on sustainable development.

Since the Brundtland Report, the concept of sustainable development has developed beyond the initial intergenerational framework to focus more on the goal of "socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable economic growth".&lt;ref name=Sachs-2015/&gt;{{RP|5}} In 1992, the [[UN Conference on Environment and Development]] published the [[Earth Charter]], which outlines the building of a just, sustainable, and peaceful global society in the 21st century. The action plan [[Agenda 21]] for sustainable development identified information, integration, and participation as key building blocks to help countries achieve development that recognises these interdependent pillars. It emphasises that in sustainable development everyone is a user and provider of information. It stresses the need to change from old sector-centered ways of doing business to new approaches that involve cross-sectoral co-ordination and the integration of environmental and social concerns into all development processes. Furthermore, Agenda 21 emphasises that broad public participation in decision making is a fundamental prerequisite for achieving sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;Will Allen. 2007.[http://learningforsustainability.net/susdev/ "Learning for Sustainability: Sustainable Development."]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the principles of the [[United Nations Charter]] the [[United Nations Millennium Declaration|Millennium Declaration]] identified principles and treaties on sustainable development, including [[economic development]], [[Social change|social development]] and [[environmental protection]]. Broadly defined, sustainable development is a systems approach to growth and development and to manage natural, produced, and [[social capital]] for the welfare of their own and future generations. The term sustainable development as used by the United Nations incorporates both issues associated with [[land development]] and broader issues of [[Human development (humanity)|human development]] such as education, public health, and standard of living.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

A 2013 study concluded that sustainability reporting should be reframed through the lens of four interconnected domains: ecology, economics, politics and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2013|title=Reframing social sustainability reporting: Towards an engaged approach|url=https://www.academia.edu/4362669/Reframing_Social_Sustainability_Reporting_Towards_an_Engaged_Approach|journal=Environment, Development and Sustainability|publisher=University of Melbourne|doi=10.1007/s10668-012-9384-2|author1=Liam Magee |author2=Andy Scerri |author3=Paul James |author4=James A.

==Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)==
In September 2015, the United Nations General Assembly formally adopted the "universal, integrated and transformative" [https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdgs 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development], a set of 17 [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs). The goals are to be implemented and achieved in every country from the year 2016 to 2030.

Sustainable development, or sustainability, has been described in terms of three spheres, dimensions, domains or pillars, i.e. the environment, the economy and society. The three-sphere framework was initially proposed by the economist René Passet in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4RFOAQAAIAAJ|title=L'Économique et le vivant|last=Passet|first=René|date=1979-01-01|publisher=Payot|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been worded as "economic, environmental and social" or "ecology, economy and equity".&lt;ref name="Global Sustainability Report"&gt;{{cite book|last=United Nations|title=Prototype Global Sustainable Development Report|publisher=United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Division for Sustainable Development|location=New York|date=2014|edition=Online unedited|url=http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/globalsdreport/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been expanded by some authors to include a fourth pillar of culture, institutions or governance,&lt;ref name="Global Sustainability Report"/&gt; or alternatively reconfigured as four domains of the social - ecology, economics, politics and culture,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= with Magee | first2= Liam | last3= Scerri | first3= Andy | last4= Steger | first4= Manfred B. | title= Urban Sustainability in Theory and Practice: Circles of Sustainability | url= https://www.academia.edu/9294719/Urban_Sustainability_in_Theory_and_Practice_Circles_of_Sustainability_2015_ | year= 2015 | publisher= Routledge | location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus bringing economics back inside the social, and treating ecology as the intersection of the social and the natural.&lt;ref&gt;[http://citiesprogramme.com/archives/resource/circles-of-sustainability-urban-profile-process Circles of Sustainability Urban Profile Process] and {{Cite journal | year=2010 | first1= Andy |last1= Scerri | first2= Paul |  last2= James | authorlink2= Paul James (academic) | title= Accounting for sustainability: Combining qualitative and quantitative research in developing ‘indicators’ of sustainability | url= https://www.academia.edu/3230887/Accounting_for_Sustainability_Combining_Qualitative_and_Quantitative_Research_in_Developing_Indicators | journal= International Journal of Social Research Methodology | volume= 13 | issue= 1 | pages= 41–53 | doi=10.1080/13645570902864145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental sustainability concerns the [[natural environment]] and how it endures and remains diverse and productive. Since [[natural resources]] are derived from the environment, the state of air, water, and the climate are of particular concern. The [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report]] outlines current knowledge about scientific, technical and socio-economic information concerning [[climate change]], and lists options for [[Adaptation to global warming|adaptation]] and [[Climate change mitigation|mitigation]].&lt;ref name="Climate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental sustainability requires society to design activities to meet human needs while preserving the life support systems of the planet. This, for example, entails using water sustainably, utilizing renewable energy, and sustainable material supplies (e.g. harvesting wood from forests at a rate that maintains the biomass and biodiversity).{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

An unsustainable situation occurs when [[natural capital]] (the sum total of nature's resources) is used up faster than it can be replenished. Sustainability requires that human activity only uses nature's resources at a rate at which they can be replenished naturally. Inherently the concept of sustainable development is intertwined with the concept of carrying capacity. Theoretically, the long-term result of [[environmental degradation]] is the inability to sustain human life.  Such degradation on a global scale should imply an increase in human death rate until population falls to what the degraded environment can support.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}  If the degradation continues beyond a certain [[Planetary boundaries|tipping point]] or critical threshold it would lead to eventual [[extinction]] for humanity.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Integral elements for a sustainable development are research and innovation activities. A telling example is the [[European environmental research and innovation policy]], which aims at defining and implementing a transformative agenda to greening the economy and the society as a whole so to achieve a truly sustainable development. Research and innovation in Europe is financially supported by the programme [[Horizon 2020]], which is also open to participation worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;See Horizon 2020 – the EU's new research and innovation programme http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-13-1085_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt; A promising direction towards sustainable development is to design systems that are flexible and reversible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09613218.2012.702565|date=2012 | doi=10.1080/09613218.2012.702565 | volume=40 |title=Flexible strategies for long-term sustainability under uncertainty |journal=Building Research |pages=545–557 | last1 = Fawcett | first1 = William | last2 = Hughes | first2 = Martin | last3 = Krieg | first3 = Hannes | last4 = Albrecht | first4 = Stefan | last5 = Vennström | first5 = Anders}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vladan_Babovic/publication/269694158_HYDRO-D-09-00078/links/54925b6a0cf2484a3f3e0c41.pdf |last=Zhang|first=S.X.|author2=V.

Pollution of the public resources is really not a different action, it just is a reverse tragedy of the commons, in that instead of taking something out, something is put into the commons.  When the costs of polluting the commons are not calculated into the cost of the items consumed, then it becomes only natural to pollute, as the cost of pollution is external to the cost of the goods produced and the cost of cleaning the waste before it is discharged exceeds the cost of releasing the waste directly into the commons.  So, the only way to solve this problem is by protecting the ecology of the commons by making it, through taxes or fines, more costly to release the waste directly into the commons than would be the cost of cleaning the waste before discharge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Economics, Ecology, Ethics: Essays toward a Steady-State Economy|last=Daly|first=H. E.|publisher=W. H. Freeman and Company|others=Hardin, G. "The tragedy of the commons"|year=|isbn=|location=New York and San Francisco|pages=100–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So, one can try to appeal to the ethics of the situation by doing the right thing as an individual, but in the absence of any direct consequences, the individual will tend to do what is best for the person and not what is best for the common good of the public.  Once again, this issue needs to be addressed.  Because, left unaddressed, the development of the commonly owned property will become impossible to achieve in a sustainable way.  So, this topic is central to the understanding of creating a sustainable situation from the management of the public resources that are used for personal use.

====Agriculture====
{{See also|Sustainable agriculture}}
Sustainable agriculture consists of [[environment friendly]] methods of farming that allow the production of crops or livestock without damage to human or natural systems. It involves preventing adverse effects to soil, water, biodiversity, surrounding or downstream resources—as well as to those working or living on the farm or in neighboring areas. The concept of sustainable agriculture extends intergenerationally, passing on a conserved or improved natural resource, biotic, and economic base rather than one which has been depleted or polluted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Networld-Project |url=http://www.green-networld.com/facts/glossary.htm |title=Environmental Glossary |publisher=Green-networld.com |date=1998-02-09 |accessdate=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elements of sustainable agriculture include [[permaculture]], [[agroforestry]], [[mixed farming]], [[multiple cropping]], and [[crop rotation]].&lt;ref&gt;Ben Falk, ''The resilient farm and homestead: An innovative permaculture and whole systems design approach''. Chelsea Green, 2013. pp. 61-78.&lt;/ref&gt; It involves agricultural methods that do not undermine the environment, smart farming technologies that enhance a quality environment for humans to thrive and reclaiming and transforming deserts into farmlands(Herman Daly, 2017). {{Citation needed|reason=reclaiming and transforming deserts is sustainable|date=December 2017}}

According to ecological economist [[:de:Malte Michael Faber|Malte Faber]], ecological economics is defined by its focus on nature, justice, and time. Issues of [[intergenerational equity]], [[irreversibility]] of environmental change, [[uncertainty]] of long-term outcomes, and sustainable development guide ecological economic analysis and valuation.&lt;ref name=Faber2008&gt;Malte Faber. (2008). How to be an ecological economist. ''Ecological Economics'' '''66'''(1):1-7. [https://ideas.repec.org/p/awi/wpaper/0454.html Preprint].&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as the 1970s, the concept of sustainability was used to describe an [[economy]] "in equilibrium with basic ecological support systems".&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert L. Stivers|Stivers, R.]] 1976. The Sustainable Society: Ethics and Economic Growth. Philadelphia: [[Westminster John Knox Press|Westminster Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists in many fields have highlighted ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Meadows, D.H., D.L. Meadows, J.

In 1987 the economist Edward Barbier published the study ''The Concept of Sustainable Economic Development'', where he recognised that goals of environmental conservation and economic development are not conflicting and can be reinforcing each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Barbier |first=E. |year=1987 |title=The Concept of Sustainable Economic Development |journal=Environmental Conservation |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=101–110 |doi=10.1017/S0376892900011449 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[World Bank]] study from 1999 concluded that based on the theory of genuine savings, policymakers have many possible interventions to increase sustainability, in [[macroeconomics]] or purely environmental.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hamilton |first=K. |first2=M. |last2=Clemens |year=1999 |title=Genuine savings rates in developing countries |journal=World Bank Economy Review |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=333–356 |doi=10.1093/wber/13.2.333 | url=http://wber.oxfordjournals.org/content/13/2/333.abstract }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies have noted that efficient policies for renewable energy and pollution are compatible with increasing human welfare, eventually reaching a golden-rule steady state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=2001 |first=A.

The study, ''Interpreting Sustainability in Economic Terms'', found three pillars of sustainable development, interlinkage, [[intergenerational equity]], and [[dynamic efficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stavins |first=R. |first2=A. |last2=Wagner |first3=G. |last3=Wagner |title=Interpreting Sustainability in Economic Terms: Dynamic Efficiency Plus Intergenerational Equity |journal=[[Economic Letters]] |volume=79 |issue=3 |pages=339–343 |doi=10.1016/S0165-1765(03)00036-3 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But [[Gilbert Rist]] points out that the World Bank has twisted the notion of sustainable development to prove that economic development need not be deterred in the interest of preserving the ecosystem. He writes: "From this angle, 'sustainable development' looks like a cover-up operation. ... The thing that is meant to be sustained is really 'development', not the tolerance capacity of the ecosystem or of human societies."&lt;ref&gt;''The History of Development'', 3rd Ed. (New York: Zed, 2008) 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Bank, a leading producer of environmental knowledge, continues to advocate the win-win prospects for economic growth and ecological stability even as its economists express their doubts.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel P. Castillo, "Integral Ecology as a Liberationist Concept" in ''Theological Studies'', Vol 77, 2, June 2016, 374.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herman Daly]], an economist for the Bank from 1988 to 1994, writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;When authors of ''WDR'' '92 [the highly influential 1992 ''World Development Report'' that featured the environment] were drafting the report, they called me asking for examples of "win-win" strategies in my work. What could I say? None exists in that pure form; there are trade-offs, not "win-wins." But they want to see a world of "win-wins" based on articles of faith, not fact. I wanted to contribute because ''WDR''s are important in the Bank, [because] task managers read [them] to find philosophical justification for their latest round of projects. But they did not want to hear about how things really are, or what I find in my work..."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Goldman, ''Imperial Nature: the World Bank and the Struggle for Justice in the Age of Globalization.''

As countries around the world continue to advance economically, they put a strain on the ability of the natural environment to absorb the high level of pollutants that are created as a part of this economic growth. Therefore, solutions need to be found so that the economies of the world can continue to grow, but not at the expense of the public good.  In the world of economics the amount of environmental quality must be considered as limited in supply and therefore is treated as a scarce resource. This is a resource to be protected. One common way to analyze possible outcomes of policy decisions on the scarce resource is to do a cost-benefit analysis. This type of analysis contrasts different options of resource allocation and, based on an evaluation of the expected courses of action and the consequences of these actions, the optimal way to do so in the light of different policy goals can be elicited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barbier|first1=E.B.|last2=Markandya|first2=A.|last3=Pearce|first3=D.W.|title=Environmental sustainability and cost-benefit analysis|journal=Environment and Planning A|date=1990|volume=22|doi=10.1068/a221259|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.335.1749&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|accessdate=11 November 2016|pages=1259–1266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benefit-cost analysis basically can look at several ways of solving a problem and then assigning the best route for a solution, based on the set of consequences that would result from the further development of the individual courses of action, and then choosing the course of action that results in the least amount of damage to the expected outcome for the environmental quality that remains after that development or process takes place. Further complicating this analysis are the interrelationships of the various parts of the environment that might be impacted by the chosen course of action.  Sometimes it is almost impossible to predict the various outcomes of a course of action, due to the unexpected consequences and the amount of unknowns that are not accounted for in the benefit-cost analysis.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

====Energy====
{{Main|Smart grid|Sustainable energy}}
Sustainable energy is clean and can be used over a long period of time. Unlike fossil fuels and biofuels that provide the bulk of the worlds energy, [[renewable energy]] sources like hydroelectric, solar and wind energy produce far less pollution.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-biofuels-idUSBRE90601A20130107&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fainstein, Susan S. 2000. "New Directions in Planning Theory," ''Urban Affairs Review'' 35:4 (March)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Solar energy]] is commonly used on public parking meters, street lights and the roof of buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bedsworf | first1 = Louise W. | last2 = Hanak | first2 = Ellen | year = 2010 | title = Adaptation to Climate Change | url = | journal = Journal of the American Planning Association | volume = 76 | issue = | page = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wind power]] has expanded quickly, its share of worldwide electricity usage at the end of 2014 was 3.1%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/REN12-GSR2015_Onlinebook_low1.pdf pg31&lt;/ref&gt; Most of California's fossil fuel infrastructures are sited in or near low-income communities, and have traditionally suffered the most from California's fossil fuel energy system.  These communities are historically left out during the decision-making process, and often end up with dirty power plants and other dirty energy projects that poison the air and harm the area. These toxicants are major contributors to health problems in the communities. As renewable energy becomes more common, fossil fuel infrastructures are replaced by renewables, providing better social equity to these communities.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Scott. 1996. "Green Cities, Growing Cities, Just Cities?: Urban planning and the Contradictions of Sustainable Development," Journal of the American Planning Association&lt;/ref&gt;
Overall, and in the long run, sustainable development in the field of energy is also deemed to contribute to economic sustainability and national security of communities, thus being increasingly encouraged through investment policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farah|first1=Paolo Davide|title=Sustainable Energy Investments and National Security: Arbitration and Negotiation Issues|journal=JOURNAL OF WORLD ENERGY LAW AND BUSINESS|date=2015|volume=8|issue=6|ssrn=2695579}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Technology====
{{See also|Appropriate technology|Environmental engineering|Environmental technology}}
One of the core concepts in sustainable development is that technology can be used to assist people meet their developmental needs. Technology to meet these sustainable development needs is often referred to as [[appropriate technology]], which is an ideological movement (and its manifestations) originally articulated as [[intermediate technology]] by the economist [[E. F. Schumacher]] in his influential work, ''[[Small is Beautiful]].'' and now covers a wide range of technologies.&lt;ref name=BrownU&gt;{{cite book|title=Appropriate Technology: Tools, Choices, and Implications|year=1999|publisher=Academic Press|location=New York|isbn=0-12-335190-1|pages=3, 270|author=Hazeltine, B.|author2=Bull, C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Schumacher and many modern-day proponents of appropriate technology also emphasise the technology as people-centered.&lt;ref name=Akubue&gt;{{cite journal|last=Akubue|first=Anthony|title=Appropriate Technology for Socioeconomic Development in Third World Countries|journal=The Journal of Technology Studies|date=Winter–Spring 2000|volume=26|issue=1|pages=33–43.Retrieved March 2011|url=http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/JOTS/Winter-Spring-2000/akabue.html|doi=10.21061/jots.v26i1.a.6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today appropriate technology is often developed using [[Open-source model|open source]] principles, which have led to [[open-source appropriate technology]] (OSAT) and thus many of the plans of the technology can be freely found on the [[Internet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pearce | first1 = Joshua M. | year = 2012 | title = The Case for Open Source Appropriate Technology | url =https://www.academia.edu/1517361/The_Case_for_Open_Source_Appropriate_Technology | journal = Environment, Development and Sustainability | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 425–431 | doi = 10.1007/s10668-012-9337-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; OSAT has been proposed as a new model of enabling [[innovation]] for sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce J., Albritton S., Grant G., Steed G., &amp; Zelenika I. 2012.

====Transport====
{{See also|Sustainable transport}}
Transportation is a large contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. It is said that one-third of all gasses produced are due to transportation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sustainable Transport in Freiburg: Lessons from Germany's Environmental Capital|last = Buehler|first = Ralph|date = 2011|journal = International Journal of Sustainable Transportation&lt;!-- 23:04:16--&gt;|doi = 10.1080/15568311003650531|pmid = |last2 = Pucher|first2 = John|volume=5|pages=43–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motorized transport also releases exhaust fumes that contain particulate matter which is hazardous to human health and a contributor to climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-breathe-clean/?loclang=en_gb|title=LEDS in Practice: Breathe clean|work=The Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sustainable transport has many social and economic benefits that can accelerate local sustainable development. According to a series of reports by the [[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]], sustainable transport can help create jobs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-create-jobs/?loclang=en_gb|title=LEDS in Practice: Create jobs|work=The Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt; improve commuter safety through investment in bicycle lanes and pedestrian pathways,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-make-roads-safe/?loclang=en_gb|title=LEDS in Practice: Make roads safe|work=The Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt; make access to employment and social opportunities more affordable and efficient. It also offers a practical opportunity to save people's time and household income as well as government budgets,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-save-time-money/?loclang=en_gb|title=LEDS in Practice: Save money and time|work=The Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt; making investment in sustainable transport a 'win-win' opportunity.

Some Western countries are making transportation more sustainable in both long-term and short-term implementations.&lt;ref&gt;Barbour, Elissa and Elizabeth A. Deakin. 2012. "Smart Growth Planning for Climate Protection"&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the modification in available transportation in [[Freiburg im Breisgau|Freiburg, Germany]]. The city has implemented extensive methods of public transportation, cycling, and walking, along with large areas where cars are not allowed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Since many Western countries are highly automobile-oriented, the main transit that people use is personal vehicles. About 80% of their travel involves cars.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Therefore, California, is one of the highest [[greenhouse gases]] emitters in the United States. The federal government has to come up with some plans to reduce the total number of vehicle trips in order to lower greenhouse gases emission. Such as:

* Improve public transit through the provision of larger coverage area in order to provide more mobility and accessibility, new technology to provide a more reliable and responsive public transportation network.&lt;ref&gt;Murthy, A.S. Narasimha Mohle, Henry. [http://site.ebrary.com/lib/alltitles/docDetail.action?docID=10447877&amp;p00=transportation%20improvement Transportation Engineering Basics (2nd Edition)]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. (American Society of Civil Engineers 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Encourage walking and biking through the provision of wider pedestrian pathway, bike share stations in downtowns, locate parking lots far from the shopping center, limit on street parking, slower traffic lane in downtown area.
* Increase the cost of car ownership and gas taxes through increased parking fees and tolls, encouraging people to drive more fuel efficient vehicles. This can produce a social equity problem, since lower income people usually drive older vehicles with lower fuel efficiency. Government can use the extra revenue collected from taxes and tolls to improve public transportation and benefit poor communities.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Jonathan. 2013. "Urban Transportation and Social Equity: Transportation Planning Paradigms that Impede Policy Reform," in Naomi Carmon and Susan S. Fainstein, eds. Policy, Planning and people: promoting Justice in Urban Development (Penn)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other states and nations have built efforts to [[knowledge translation|translate knowledge]] in [[behavioral economics]] into [[evidence-based]] [[sustainable transportation]] policies.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

====Business====

{{See also|Corporate sustainability}}
The most broadly accepted criterion for corporate sustainability constitutes a firm's efficient use of natural capital.  This [[eco-efficiency]] is usually calculated as the economic value added by a firm in relation to its aggregated ecological impact.&lt;ref&gt;Schaltegger, S. &amp; Sturm, A. 1998. Eco-Efficiency by Eco-Controlling. Zürich: vdf.&lt;/ref&gt;  This idea has been popularised by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development ([[WBCSD]]) under the following definition: "Eco-efficiency is achieved by the delivery of competitively priced goods and services that satisfy human needs and bring quality of life, while progressively reducing ecological impacts and [[resource intensity]] throughout the life-cycle to a level at least in line with the earth's carrying capacity" (DeSimone and Popoff, 1997: 47).&lt;ref&gt;DeSimone, L. &amp; Popoff, F. 1997. Eco-efficiency: The business link to sustainable development. Cambridge: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to the eco-efficiency concept but so far less explored is the second criterion for corporate sustainability. Socio-efficiency&lt;ref name="Dyllick, T. 2002"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dyllick | first1 = T. | last2 = Hockerts | first2 = K. | year = 2002 | title = Beyond the business case for corporate sustainability | url = | journal = Business Strategy and the Environment | volume = 11 | issue = 2| pages = 130–141 | doi=10.1002/bse.323}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes the relation between a firm's value added and its social impact. Whereas, it can be assumed that most corporate impacts on the environment are negative (apart from rare exceptions such as the planting of trees) this is not true for social impacts. These can be either positive (e.g. corporate giving, creation of employment) or negative (e.g. work accidents, mobbing of employees, human rights abuses). Depending on the type of impact socio-efficiency thus either tries to minimise negative social impacts (i.e. accidents per value added) or maximise positive social impacts (i.e. donations per value added) in relation to the value added.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Both eco-efficiency and socio-efficiency are concerned primarily with increasing economic sustainability. In this process they instrumentalise both natural and social capital aiming to benefit from win-win situations. However, as Dyllick and Hockerts&lt;ref name="Dyllick, T. 2002"/&gt; point out the business case alone will not be sufficient to realise sustainable development. They point towards eco-effectiveness, socio-effectiveness, sufficiency, and eco-equity as four criteria that need to be met if sustainable development is to be reached.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

CASI Global, New York "CSR &amp; Sustainability together lead to sustainable development. CSR as in corporate social responsibility is not what you do with your profits, but is the way you make profits. This means CSR is a part of every department of the company value chain and not a part of HR / independent department. Sustainability as in effects towards Human resources, Environment and Ecology has to be measured within each department of the company." http://casiglobal.us/

====Income====

At the present time, sustainable development can reduce [[poverty]]. Sustainable development reduces [[poverty]] through financial (among other things, a balanced budget), environmental (living conditions), and social (including equality of income) means.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wydawnictwoumk.pl/czasopisma/index.php/CJFA/article/view/CJFA.2014.001/3213 S. Adamiak, D. Walczak, Sustainable development and social solidarism in the context of social security, Copernican Journal of Finance &amp; Accounting, Vol 3, No 1, p. 12,17.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Architecture====

{{See also|Sustainable architecture}}
In sustainable architecture the recent movements of [[New Urbanism]] and [[New Classical architecture]] promote a sustainable approach towards construction, that appreciates and develops [[smart growth]], [[Vernacular architecture|architectural tradition]] and [[Classical architecture|classical design]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnu.org/charter Charter of the New Urbanism]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beauty, Humanism, Continuity between Past and Future|url=http://www.traditionalarchitecture.co.uk/aims.html|publisher=Traditional Architecture Group|accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This in contrast to [[Modern architecture|modernist]] and [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]] architecture, as well as opposing to solitary [[housing estate]]s and [[Urban sprawl|suburban sprawl]], with long commuting distances and large ecological footprints.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aia.org/SiteObjects/files/smartgrowth05.pdf Issue Brief: Smart-Growth: Building Livable Communities]. American Institute of Architects. Retrieved on 2014-03-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Both trends started in the 1980s. (It should be noted that sustainable architecture is predominantly relevant to the economics domain while architectural landscaping pertains more to the ecological domain.){{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Politics===
{{See also|Environmental politics|Environmental governance|Sustainability metrics and indices}}
A study concluded that social indicators and, therefore, sustainable development indicators, are scientific constructs whose principal objective is to inform public policy-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul-Marie Boulanger |url=http://sapiens.revues.org/index166.html |title=Sustainable development indicators: a scientific challenge, a democratic issue. '&amp;#39;S.A.P.I.EN.S.'&amp;#39; '&amp;#39;'1'&amp;#39;' (1) |publisher=Sapiens.revues.org |year=2008 |accessdate=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Institute for Sustainable Development]] has similarly developed a political policy framework, linked to a sustainability index for establishing measurable entities and metrics. The framework consists of six core areas, international trade and investment, economic policy, climate change and energy, measurement and assessment, natural resource management, and the role of communication technologies in sustainable development.

The [[United Nations Global Compact]] Cities Programme has defined sustainable political development in a way that broadens the usual definition beyond states and governance. The political is defined as the domain of practices and meanings associated with basic issues of social power as they pertain to the organisation, authorisation, legitimation and regulation of a social life held in common. This definition is in accord with the view that political change is important for responding to economic, ecological and cultural challenges. It also means that the politics of economic change can be addressed. They have listed seven subdomains of the domain of politics:&lt;ref name="citiesprogramme.com"/&gt;

#Organization and governance
#Law and justice
#Communication and critique
#Representation and negotiation
#Security and accord
#Dialogue and reconciliation
#Ethics and accountability

This accords with the Brundtland Commission emphasis on development that is guided by human rights principles (see above).

===Culture===

[[File:Circles of Sustainability image (assessment - Melbourne 2011).jpg|250px|thumb|Framing of sustainable development progress according to the [[Circles of Sustainability]], used by the [[United Nations Global Compact|United Nations]].]]
Working with a different emphasis, some researchers and institutions have pointed out that a fourth dimension should be added to the dimensions of sustainable development, since the triple-bottom-line dimensions of economic, environmental and social do not seem to be enough to reflect the complexity of contemporary society. In this context, the [[Agenda 21 for culture]] and the [[United Cities and Local Governments]] (UCLG)  Executive Bureau lead the preparation of the policy statement "Culture: Fourth Pillar of Sustainable Development", passed on 17 November 2010, in the framework of the World Summit of Local and Regional Leaders&amp;nbsp;– 3rd World Congress of UCLG, held in Mexico City. This document inaugurates a new perspective and points to the relation between culture and sustainable development through a dual approach: developing a solid [[cultural policy]] and advocating a cultural dimension in all public policies. The [[Circles of Sustainability]] approach distinguishes the four domains of economic, ecological, political and cultural sustainability.&lt;ref name="agenda21culture.net"&gt;United Cities and Local Governments, [http://agenda21culture.net/index.php/16-official-documentation-all/agenda-21-culture-all/437-cultural-policies-and-sustainable-development "Culture: Fourth Pillar of Sustainable Development"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uclg.org/en/node/21824&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/15885475/Assessing_Cultural_Sustainability_Agenda_21_for_Culture&lt;/ref&gt;

Other organizations have also supported the idea of a fourth domain of sustainable development. The Network of Excellence "Sustainable Development in a Diverse World",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.susdiv.org/ |title=Sus.Div |publisher=Sus.Div |accessdate=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; sponsored by the [[European Union]], integrates multidisciplinary capacities and interprets [[cultural diversity]] as a key element of a new strategy for sustainable development. The Fourth Pillar of Sustainable Development Theory has been referenced by executive director of IMI Institute at [[UNESCO]] Vito Di Bari&lt;ref&gt;"Agreement between UNESCO and the City of Milan concerning the International Multimedia Institute (IMI) - Appointment of Executive Director&amp;nbsp;— UNESCO Archives ICA AtoM catalogue". Atom.archives.unesco.org. 1999-10-08. Retrieved 2014-01-17.&lt;/ref&gt; in his manifesto of art and architectural movement [[Neo-Futurism]], whose name was inspired by the 1987 [[United Nations]]’ report [[Our Common Future]]. The [[Circles of Sustainability]] approach used by Metropolis defines the (fourth) cultural domain as practices, discourses, and material expressions, which, over time, express continuities and discontinuities of social meaning.&lt;ref name="citiesprogramme.com"&gt;http://citiesprogramme.com/archives/resource/circles-of-sustainability-urban-profile-process {{Cite journal

===Progress===
{{See also|Sustainable development goals}}
The [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development]] (UNCSD; also known as Rio 2012) was the third international conference on sustainable development,  which aimed at reconciling the economic and environmental goals of the global community. An outcome of this conference was the development of the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] that aim to promote sustainable progress and eliminate inequalities around the world. However, few nations met the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]]'s definition of sustainable development criteria established in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Living Planet Report 2006 |url= http://assets.panda.org/downloads/living_planet_report.pdf |publisher= [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], [[Zoological Society of London]], [[Global Footprint Network]] |date= 24 October 2006 |page= 19 |accessdate= 18 August 2012 }}; [http://www.science.org.au/nova/newscientist/107ns_004.htm World failing on sustainable development] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209164418/http://www.science.org.au/nova/newscientist/107ns_004.htm |date=9 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some nations are more developed than others, all nations are constantly developing because each nation struggles with perpetuating disparities, inequalities and unequal access to fundamental rights and freedoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Creating Capabilities: The Human Development Approach|last = Nussbaum|first = Martha|publisher = The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-674-05054-9|location = Cambridge, Massachusetts and London, England|pages = 16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Amazonie deforestation.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Deforestation and increased road-building in the [[Amazon Rainforest]] are a concern because of increased human encroachment upon [[wilderness]] areas, increased resource extraction and further threats to [[biodiversity]].]]
In 2007 a report for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency stated: "While much discussion and effort has gone into sustainability indicators, none of the resulting systems clearly tells us whether our society is sustainable. At best, they can tell us that we are heading in the wrong direction, or that our current activities are not sustainable. More often, they simply draw our attention to the existence of problems, doing little to tell us the origin of those problems and nothing to tell us how to solve them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/1841126/Environmental-Protection-Agency-hechtepaordpaper |title=Joy E.

Those indicators are expected to be identified and adjusted through empirical observations (trial and error).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2006 | title = An adaptive learning process for developing and applying sustainability indicators with local communities | url = http://km.fao.org/uploads/media/An%20adaptative%20learning%20process%20for%20developing%20and%20applying%20sustainability%20indicators%20with%20local%20communities.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Ecological economics | volume = 59 | issue =  | pages = 406–418 | doi = 10.1016/j.ecolecon.2005.11.008 | last1 = Reed | first1 = Mark S. | access-date = 18 February 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110726045818/http://km.fao.org/uploads/media/An%20adaptative%20learning%20process%20for%20developing%20and%20applying%20sustainability%20indicators%20with%20local%20communities.pdf | archive-date = 26 July 2011 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common critiques are related to issues like data quality, comparability, objective function and the necessary resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nse-netz.de/downloads/nachh.pdf |title=Annette Lang, Ist Nachhaltigkeit messbar?, Uni Hannover, 2003 |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-09-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110802135133/http://www.nse-netz.de/downloads/nachh.pdf |archive-date=2 August 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However a more general criticism is coming from the project management community: How can a sustainable development be achieved at global level if we cannot monitor it in any single project?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://youth-partnership-eu.coe.int/youth-partnership/documents/Publications/T_kits/3/tkit3.pdf |title=Project Management T-kit, Council of Europe and European Commission, Strasbourg, 2000 |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grida.no/publications/et/ep4/page/2653.aspx |title=Do global targets matter?, The Environment Times, Poverty Times #4, UNEP/GRID-Arendal, 2010 |publisher=Grida.no |accessdate=2011-09-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629043039/http://www.grida.no/publications/et/ep4/page/2653.aspx |archive-date=29 June 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reasonable qualifications of sustainability are seen U.S. Green Building Council's (USGBC) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). This design incorporates some ecological, economic, and social elements. The goals presented by LEED design goals are sustainable sites, water efficiency, energy and atmospheric emission reduction, material and resources efficiency, and indoor environmental quality. Although amount of structures for sustainability development is many, these qualification has become a standard for sustainable building.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Recent research efforts created also the [[SDEWES Centre#SDEWES Index|SDEWES Index]] to benchmark the performance of cities across aspects that are related to energy, water and environment systems. The [[SDEWES Centre|SDEWES]] Index consists of 7 dimensions, 35 indicators, and close to 20 sub-indicators. It is currently applied to 58 cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SDEWES Centre - SDEWES Index|url = http://www.sdewes.org/sdewes_index.php|website = www.sdewes.org|accessdate = 2015-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural capital===
[[File:Hillside deforestation in Rio de Janeiro.jpg|300px|thumb|alt=Deforastation of native rain forest in Rio de Janeiro City for extraction of clay for civil construction|[[Deforestation]] of native [[rain forest]] in Rio de Janeiro City for extraction of [[clay]] for [[civil engineering]] (2009 picture).]]
The sustainable development debate is based on the assumption that societies need to manage three types of capital (economic, social, and natural), which may be non-substitutable and whose consumption might be irreversible.&lt;ref name="Dyllick, T. 2002"/&gt; Leading [[Ecological economics|ecological economist]] and [[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state theorist]] [[Herman Daly]],&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt; for example, points to the fact that [[natural capital]] can not necessarily be substituted by economic capital. While it is possible that we can find ways to replace some natural resources, it is much more unlikely that they will ever be able to replace eco-system services, such as the protection provided by the ozone layer, or the climate stabilizing function of the Amazonian forest. In fact natural capital, social capital and economic capital are often complementarities. A further obstacle to substitutability lies also in the multi-functionality of many natural resources. Forests, for example, not only provide the raw material for paper (which can be substituted quite easily), but they also maintain biodiversity, regulate water flow, and absorb CO2.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Another problem of natural and social capital deterioration lies in their partial irreversibility. The [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]], for example, is often definitive. The same can be true for cultural diversity. For example, with globalisation advancing quickly the number of indigenous languages is dropping at alarming rates.  Moreover, the depletion of natural and social capital may have non-linear consequences. Consumption of natural and social capital may have no observable impact until a certain threshold is reached. A lake can, for example, absorb nutrients for a long time while actually increasing its productivity. However, once a certain level of algae is reached lack of oxygen causes the lake's ecosystem to break down suddenly.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Business-as-usual===
[[File:Air pollution by industrial chimneys.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Before [[flue-gas desulfurization]] was installed, the [[air pollution|air-polluting]] emissions from this power plant in [[New Mexico]] contained excessive amounts of [[sulfur dioxide]].]]
If the degradation of natural and social capital has such important consequence the question arises why action is not taken more systematically to alleviate it. Cohen and Winn&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cohen | first1 = B. | last2 = Winn | first2 = M. I. | year = 2007 | title = Market imperfections, opportunity and sustainable entrepreneurship | url = | journal = Journal of Business Venturing | volume = 22 | issue = 1| pages = 29–49 | doi=10.1016/j.jbusvent.2004.12.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; point to four types of market failure as possible explanations: First, while the benefits of natural or social capital depletion can usually be privatised, the costs are often externalised (i.e. they are borne not by the party responsible but by society in general). Second, natural capital is often undervalued by society since we are not fully aware of the real cost of the depletion of natural capital. Information asymmetry is a third reason—often the link between cause and effect is obscured, making it difficult for actors to make informed choices. Cohen and Winn close with the realization that contrary to economic theory many firms are not perfect optimisers. They postulate that firms often do not optimise resource allocation because they are caught in a "business as usual" mentality.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Education===
''Main page: [[Education for sustainable development]]''

Education must be revisited in light of a renewed vision of sustainable human and social development that is both equitable and viable. This vision of sustainability must take into consideration the social, environmental and economic dimensions of human development and the various ways in which these relate to education: ‘An empowering education is one that builds the human resources we need to be productive, to continue to learn, to solve problems, to be creative, and to live together and with nature in peace and harmony. When nations ensure that such an education is accessible to all throughout their lives, a quiet revolution is set in motion: education becomes the engine of sustainable development and the key to a better world.’&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Power of Education: Education for All, Development, Globalisation and UNESCO|last=Power|first=C|publisher=London, Springer|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002325/232555e.pdf|title=Rethinking Education: Towards a global common good?|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100088-1|location=|pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Higher education in sustainability across education streams including engineering, finance, supply chain and operations is gaining weight-age. Multiple institutes including Wharton, Columbia, CASI Global New York offer certifications in Sustainability.
Corporate's prefer employees certified in sustainability.

== Insubstantial stretching of the term ==
It has been argued that since the 1960s, the concept of sustainable development has changed from "conservation management" to "economic development", whereby the original meaning of the concept has been stretched somewhat.&lt;ref name=to01&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Riordan |first=Timothy |date=1993 |chapter=The Politics of Sustainability |editor-last=Turner |editor-first=R. Kerry |title=Sustainable Environmental Economics and Management: Principles and Practice. |location=London |publisher=Belhaven Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|48–54}}

In the 1960s, the international community realised that many African countries needed national plans to safeguard wildlife habitats, and that rural areas had to confront the limits imposed by soil, climate and water availability. This was a strategy of conservation management. In the 1970s, however, the focus shifted to the broader issues of the provisioning of basic human needs, community participation as well as appropriate technology use throughout the developing countries (and not just in Africa). This was a strategy of economic development, and the strategy was carried even further by the [[Brundtland Commission]]'s report on ''[[Our Common Future]]'' when the issues went from regional to international in scope and application.&lt;ref name=to01/&gt;{{rp|48–54}} In effect, the conservationists were crowded out and superseded by the developers.

But shifting the focus of sustainable development from conservation to development has had the imperceptible effect of stretching the original forest management term of [[sustainable yield]] from the use of renewable resources only (like forestry), to now also accounting for the use of non-renewable resources (like [[Natural resource#Classification|minerals]]).&lt;ref name=kt01&gt;{{cite book |last=Turner |first=R. Kerry |date=1988 |chapter=Sustainability, Resource Conservation and Pollution Control: An Overview |editor-last=Turner |editor-first=R. Kerry |title=Sustainable Environmental Management. |location=London |publisher=Belhaven Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13}} This stretching of the term has been questioned. Thus, environmental economist Kerry Turner has argued that literally, there can be no such thing as overall "sustainable development" in an industrialised [[world economy]] that remains heavily dependent on the extraction of earth's finite stock of exhaustible mineral resources: "It makes no sense to talk about the sustainable use of a non-renewable resource (even with substantial [[recycling]] effort and use rates). Any positive rate of exploitation will eventually lead to exhaustion of the finite stock."&lt;ref name=kt01/&gt;{{rp|13}}

In effect, it has been argued that the industrial revolution as a whole is unsustainable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Georgescu-Roegen |first=Nicholas |authorlink=Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen |date=1971 |title=The Entropy Law and the Economic Process |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/267519123/The-Entropy-Law-and-the-Economic-Process-by-Nicholas-Georgescu-Roegen-pdf |format=Full book accessible at Scribd |location=Cambridge |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0674257804 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|20f}}&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;{{rp|22f}}&lt;ref name=jr01&gt;{{cite book |last=Rifkin |first=Jeremy |authorlink=Jeremy Rifkin |date=1980 |title=Entropy: A New World View. |url=http://www.foet.org/FOET-data/uploads/2017/03/Jeremy-Rifkin-Entropy-table-of-contents.pdf |format=PDF contains only the title and contents pages of the book |location=New York |publisher=The Viking Press |isbn=0670297178 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|61–67}}&lt;ref name="Monbiot-20171124"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Monbiot|first1=George|title=Everything Must Go|url=http://www.monbiot.com/2017/11/24/everything-must-go/|website=George Monbiot|accessdate=26 November 2017|date=2017-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One critic has argued that the [[Brundtland Commission]] promoted nothing but a business as usual strategy for world development, with the ambiguous and insubstantial concept of "sustainable development" attached as a public relations slogan:&lt;ref name=ap01&gt;{{cite book |last=Perez-Carmona |first=Alexander |date=2013 |chapter=Growth: A Discussion of the Margins of Economic and Ecological Thought |chapter-url=http://www.slideshare.net/lucieevers1/growth-in-margin-of-ecological-thought-by-perez |editor-last=Meuleman |editor-first=Louis |title=Transgovernance. Advancing Sustainability Governance. |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-28009-2_3 |chapter-format=Article accessible at SlideShare |location=Heidelberg |publisher=Springer |isbn=9783642280085 |pages=83–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|94–99}} The report on ''[[Our Common Future]]'' was largely the result of a political bargaining process involving many special interest groups, all put together to create a common appeal of political acceptability across borders. After World War II, the notion of "development" had been established in the West to imply the projection of the American model of society onto the rest of the world. In the 1970s and 1980s, this notion was broadened somewhat to also imply human rights, basic human needs and finally, ecological issues. The emphasis of the report was on helping poor nations out of poverty and meeting the basic needs of their growing populations—as usual. This issue demanded more economic growth, also in the rich countries, who would then import more goods from the poor countries to help them out—as usual. When the discussion switched to [[Steady-state economy#Present background: Exceeding global limits to growth|global ecological limits to growth]], the obvious dilemma was left aside by calling for economic growth with improved resource efficiency, or what was termed "a change in the ''quality'' of growth". However, most countries in the West had experienced such improved resource efficiency since the early-20th century already and as usual; only, this improvement had been more than offset by continuing industrial expansion, to the effect that world resource consumption was now higher than ever before—and these two historical trends were completely ignored in the report. Taken together, the policy of perpetual economic growth for the entire planet remained virtually intact. Since the publication of the report, the ambiguous and insubstantial slogan of "sustainable development" has marched on worldwide.&lt;ref name=ap01/&gt;{{rp|94–99}}

'''The Society for the Preservation of Wild Culture''' (SPWC) was a Toronto [[Not-for-profit arts organization|arts organization]] in existence from 1986 to 1991 that explored environmental and ecological issues from an artistic perspective in a "quirky and innovative" way.&lt;ref name="RyersonReview"&gt;''Ryerson Review of Journalism'', April 1991, Megan Park, "Call of the Wild", p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; The SPWC was best known for three programs: a literary magazine, The Journal of Wild Culture; artist-guided walks, "landscape readings"; and a series of cabarets, The Café of Wild Culture.

The organization was a unique hybrid. The oxymoron "wild culture" tweaked the interest of contrasting types: artists, scientists and activists, and the efforts made by the organization to develop creative projects and discourse around the term were well received.&lt;ref name="TorontoStar"/&gt; It was concurrently accepted as an arts organization by artists and an environmental organization by environmentalists.

The organisation was resurrected in 2011 and is now producing an online magazine based in London and Toronto.

== Art and ecology ==
The style of the organization was determined by how participating artists expressed themselves around the undefined idea of "wild culture" (also see "[[wildculture]]"). While calling for new articulations of wild culture through its projects, at its height the society filled the cultural vacuum in Toronto with an eclectic kind of "thinking man's" fun and provided a forum for experimentation amongst performance artists.&lt;ref name="MetropolisMarch"&gt;''Metropolis'', March 30, 1989, Donna Lypchuk, "Mock on the Wild Side".&lt;/ref&gt; The broader public was encouraged by the SPWC to engage with questions about nature and art, while frequently congregating in the outdoors. This audience was also attracted to the organization's ability to 'soft pedal doom and gloom while partying for the planet".&lt;ref&gt;''Toronto Star'', April 20, 1990, Vit Wagner, "Wild Culture artists party for the planet"., p. D1.&lt;/ref&gt;

During a landscape reading on the aboriginal history of downtown Toronto, poet M. T. Kelly offered a view of how the SPWC sought to affect its audience: "There is a bridge between history and landscape. To get people to change their view of the environment, you can't just argue in economic terms. It's an emotional thing. People act politically when they get emotionally involved".&lt;ref name="GlobeMail"&gt;''Globe and Mail'', Sept 7, 1988, June Callwood, 'sunday morning landscape readings cultivate food for thought"., p. A2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of "wild culture" grew out of multidisciplinary artist [[Whitney Smith (multidisciplinary artist)|Whitney Smith]]'s experience of "a spiritual updraft in the art spheres" while foraging wild foods in the Ontario forest that he sold to local chefs. From 1982 to 1985 a series of three performances, "Fern Policy", explored the possibilities of artistic growth in the nature-culture ecotone. In May 1985 Smith made the first public announcement on the formation of the society at a Toronto art event, "L'Affaire 'Pataphysique", that presented examples of [['pataphysics]] by local artists parodying theory and methods of modern science. Following this event Smith began recruiting artists to help develop ''The Journal of Wild Culture''.

== Defining wild culture ==
Though there were attempts by the organization to define "wild culture", there was never an accepted definition. Smith preferred his colleagues and audiences to find wild culture's meaning through the titles of the projects in which it appeared,  where the social context was at play; that is, that there existed a serious-sounding and possibly genuine [[academic journal]] published by a preserving society with a long name, all devoted to a subject no one knew anything about.&lt;ref name="TorontoStar"&gt;''Toronto Star'', April 20, 1990, Vit Wagner, "Wild Culture artists party for the planet"., p. D2.&lt;/ref&gt; Negotiating the serious and the non-serious in a way that made sense and entertained became part of the artists' work.

Before there was Smith's recent definition of wild culture ("the articulated [[ecotone]] between what humans do and what they can't control in nature"), no single explanation existed around which the S.P.W.C artists" work was done. Some said that it was the vagueness of the idea, the inability to pin it down, that made it so attractive.&lt;ref name="RyersonReview" /&gt; In the absence of concrete description, Smith offered a metaphor, which he has recently modified: On the surface of a transparent painting&lt;ref name="RyersonReview" /&gt; is the human geographic reality that is part of our everyday life, and in the background are elements of nature, seen and unseen, that are very much alive but that people aren"t always aware of, whether out of convenience, ignorance, apathy, or any state of unconsciousness or self-centeredness that contributes to the disconnection from our primal history and our present psychic hold on the home terrain. Wild culture is the two planes, foreground and background, seen together.&lt;ref name="TorontoStar" /&gt;

== Programs ==

=== ''The Journal of Wild Culture'' ===
The literary organ of the SPWC, its subtitle, ecology, and imagination, spoke to the notion of ''[[The Journal of Wild Culture]]'' being a platform for artists to express themselves through the lens, or mirror, of the natural world. Smith said that "one of the things wild culture ''is'', is a tolerance for ambiguity and an acceptance that things cannot be defined".&lt;ref name="NOW Magazine 1987"&gt;''NOW Magazine'', July 9–15, 1987, Ted Mumford, 'society mines wild culture".&lt;/ref&gt; The "quirky and innovative" magazine carried on its discourse in a way that influenced the way more serious themes could be delivered with a sense of play and timeliness.&lt;ref name="RyersonReview_a"&gt;''Ryerson Review of Journalism'', April 1991, Megan Park, "Call of the Wild", p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Organic start ====
Born out of the wild foods foraging of founder Whitney Smith, the magazine was conceived in 1986-1987 by an editorial team that included Smith and architect [[Peter Ferguson]], public relations consultant [[Kim Obrist]] and filmmaker and publisher [[Christopher Lowry]]. Smith attributed his inspiration for the formation of the society to the [[National Geographic Society]] (which published its own journal) and ''FILE'' magazine, produced by the conceptual and media-based art collective, [[General Idea]], and to the ''[[Utne Reader]]'''s use of other published materials.&lt;ref name="NOW Magazine 1987"/&gt; The SPWC was in production in Toronto from 1986 to 1991. Graphic designer [[Bernard Stockl]] became the art director and quickly established the look of the magazine, including the characteristic contents page. Smith and Lowry assembled a photocopied "Journal of Wild Culture" Preview Issue that was circulated in the arts community, and a donation of $5000 "from an anonymous angel" followed, just enough to pay for the printing of the first issue.&lt;ref name="RyersonReview_a" /&gt;

==== Recruitment through social events ====
The premier issue was launched on July 27, 1987 at the Wild Culture Hoedown on Toronto Island. It was described by Smith at the time as "a cross between a literary journal and an arty comic book with ecology as its theme".&lt;ref&gt;''Toronto Sun'', July 24, 1987, Marion Kane, "Get Down at Wild Culture Hoedown"., p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Future Wild Culture events followed the format and spirit of the Hoedown by offering down-home high-end cuisine using wild foods and made on site by Chris Klugman, a well-known local chef, and featuring artists whose personae related to nature themes: the Marquis de Sod and Mr. Potatohead were the guests of honour at the launch. Poet Christopher Dewdney, an early contributor to the magazine, said that "half of the experience at "The Journal of Wild Culture" is the parties.) Volume I, Number 1 was sold for $3.95 and 3000 copies were widely distributed in Canada by Disticor, and the issue sold out; later distribution of increased numbers went into the U.S. It developed a small but devoted fan base, particularly in British Columbia. In 1990 its southwestern U.S. distributor reported that the magazine had "a cult following in Texas".

==== Visual language ====
Smith said that Stockl, who died of AIDS-related causes in 1992, was a significant contributor to JWC. "Bernie's deep sense of graphic taste and design intelligence struck the right tone with the first issue: serious like an academic journal but also accessible and visually engaging. In order for the quirkiness to work we needed the credible and elegant look that his gave us". Stockl said he modeled the JWC design after "Harper's" and "Arts and Architecture": "The trick was to create certain effects with what was available to us. Trying to cheat our way through it without it looking like that". The Bernard Franklin Stockl Memorial Scholarship is offered annually at the Alberta College of Design for "creative and innovative exploration in the use of typography for the purpose of communication".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acad.ab.ca/award_descriptions_winter.html |accessdate=August 6, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310055407/http://www.acad.ab.ca/award_descriptions_winter.html |archivedate=March 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Difficulties and demise ====
In the late 1980s, when advertisers were slow to embrace the few existing green magazines, and particularly one which the ''Utne Reader'' editor, [[Eric Utne]], called "indescribable", low ad sales made it difficult to pay the bills and meet that quarterly schedule; only seven issues were published. Two Wild Culture auctions and funding from the federal and provincials arts councils helped take up the slack, but with a low subscription base and advertising revenue, a sudden drop in grant revenue, fund-raising and marketing fatigue, Smith's reluctance to step into the role of "a career publisher",&lt;ref&gt;''Ryerson Review of Journalism'', April 1991, Megan Park, "Call of the Wild", p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; the magazine decided to take a sabbatical. More recently Smith commented on his own burn-out keeping the magazine and the SPWC going, the dilemma of the artist-publisher, and the difficulty of keeping cultural magazines afloat in factors relating to demise of JWC. In early 1991, on CBC radio's "Arts Report", it was announced that the magazine was suspending publication. The plan was to pursue a more economically feasible course by following the format of ''[[Granta]]'' magazine, offering it as a trade paperback available in bookstores. A pilot issue of selections from past JWC issues was put out by Somerville House in 1992, ''Wild Culture'', edited by Smith and Lowry, but sales were not encouraging; one explanation for this was that the book did not offer new material.

An attempt by Smith and some new colleagues in 2002 to resurrect the ''Journal of Wild Culture'' online never got off the ground. Smith said that wild culture was "a notion with a mind of its own" and that "the ingredients for a re-launch in 2002 just weren't there".

=== Landscape Readings ===
Landscape Readings were public walking tours led by artists of outdoor environments that held an intellectual or personal interest for the artist. Landscape Readings were a hybrid that combined the attraction of authors reading their own works with a bracing picnic outing in a setting which combines the context for a lecture on ecology, geology, history or biography.&lt;ref name="GlobeMail" /&gt;

The readings were a project initially conceived by Smith to provide a venue for writer and poet Christopher Dewdney to share his extensive knowledge of palaeozoic geology, among other things, and his sense of humour. In July 1987 he gave the first landscape reading of Toronto's High Park Carolinian forest,&lt;ref&gt;''NOW Magazine'', July 9–15, 1987, Ted Mumford, 'society mines wild culture," p. ?.&lt;/ref&gt; which was documented in the forthcoming issue of ''The Journal of Wild Culture''.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Dewdney, photos by David Hlynsky, Fall 1987, "Evidence Revealed During Walk in Park", ''The Journal of Wild Culture'', Vol. I, No. 3., p. 40-43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other artist guides included [[Gordon Rayner]], [[Hank Hedges]], [[M. T. Kelly]], [[June Callwood]], [[Larry Zolf]], [[Joyce Weiland]], and architect [[Donald Schmitt]]. The Readings were created to "give [SPWC participating] artists a new venue".&lt;ref name="GlobeMail" /&gt;

=== The Café of Wild Culture ===
The Café of Wild Culture was conceived in collaboration with bookseller and film programmer [[Marc Glassman]], who recognized that the sense of humour that was so much a part of the 60s and 70s was missing in the 80s.&lt;ref&gt;''Toronto Star'', February 4, 1989, Ingrid Hamilton, "Scene and Heard", p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; The Café was performed first in Toronto at [[The Rivoli]], and later in New York at the Village Gate and at Goddard College in Vermont. Its legitimate non-theatre style &lt;ref name="MetropolisMarch" /&gt; played off the vaudeville and variety revue made up of several short unrelated acts (in the Café's case, no longer than 7 minutes) that caught the wild culture spirit of thoughtful irreverence. Acts ranged from tendentious 'pataphysical lectures, authentic scientific explanations, obtuse dance works, gentlemen's shirt-ironing contests, and wild food cooking demonstrations, in which small servings were provided for the audience, and a game called StorySlide where artists improvised a performed text based on a random photographic slide show.

=== Other programs ===
Smith met his match when he began a project called the Great Festival of the Lakes,&lt;ref name="TorontoStar" /&gt; which was to encourage the presentation of community arts festivals in Great Lakes cities.&lt;ref name="GlobeMail" /&gt; "I was very concerned about water quality issues at the time, and thought that the SPWC needed an activist project to sponsor. I was wrong. Organizing anything around the Great Lakes is like trying to organize Europe. I learned a lot about underestimating scale on that one, and spreading myself too thin". The project was abandoned after a couple of years.

In 1990, the SPWC worked with an organization started by Michael Stadtlander and Jamie Kennedy, Knives and Forks, on Spring Feast,&lt;ref name="TorontoStar" /&gt; which became a precursor of future events promoting local chefs and wild and organic foods.

== The Journal of Wild Culture 2.0 ==
From September 2011 Smith's work on the SPWC focused on the online publishing platform, The Journal of Wild Culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Whitney|title=Wild Culture info|url=http://www.whitneysmith.ca/wildcultureinfo.htm|work=Information page|publisher=Whitney Smith|accessdate=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was beta-launched in December 2012 in London as www.wildculture.com by an editorial and design team including Smith, Joe Hedges of Branding by Garden, Tom Jeffreys, Sarah Lester, Rosie Jackson and Liam Desroy, continued with Smith, Jeffreys and designer Hedges from February to October 2013, at which time Smith took over sole editorial responsibilities, in collaboration, until 2016, with board members Lisa Wilson and Richard Stursberg; Stursberg continues to participate in an advisory role. The publication has no advertising, sends out a weekly newsletter, is supported by donations and the work of a growing community of international contributors. Current editors and contributing editors under publisher/editor Smith include Chellis Glendinning, Herbert Wright, Chris Lowry, Henry Giroux and illustrator Brad Harley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wild Culture, people page|url=http://www.wildculture.com/people|website=The Journal of Wild Culture|publisher=Society for the Preservation of Wild Culture|accessdate=January 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The World's Sixteen Crucified Saviors; Or, Christianity Before Christ, Containing New, Startling, and Extraordinary Revelations in Religious History, which Disclose the Oriental Origin of All the Doctrines, Principles, Precepts, and Miracles of the Christian New Testament, and Furnishing a Key for Unlocking Many of Its Sacred Mysteries, Besides Comprising the History of 16 Heathen Crucified Gods''''' is an 1875 book written by American [[freethought|freethinker]] [[Kersey Graves]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graves|first=Kersey|authorlink=Kersey Graves|title=The World's Sixteen Crucified Saviors: Or, Christianity Before Christ, Containing New, Startling, and Extraordinary Revelations in Religious History, which Disclose the Oriental Origin of All the Doctrines, Principles, Precepts, and Miracles of the Christian New Testament, and Furnishing a Key for Unlocking Many of Its Sacred Mysteries, Besides Comprising the History of 16 Heathen Crucified Gods|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JGAwAQAAMAAJ|year=1875|publisher=Freethought Press|pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; which asserts that [[Jesus]] was not an [[historical Jesus|actual person]], but was a creation largely based on earlier stories of deities or [[demigod|god-men]] [[wiktionary:savior|saviours]] who had been [[crucified]] and descended to and ascended from the underworld.  Parts were reprinted in ''The Book Your Church Doesn't Want You to Read'' edited by Tim C. Leedom in 1994, and it was republished in its entirety in 2001.

The book is often used as a source by [[Christ myth theory]] proponents, such as [[Dorothy M. Murdock]],&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Casey Jesus: Evidence and Argument or Mythicist Myths? T&amp;T Clark 2014 p21-22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.truthbeknown.com/beddru.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tom Harpur]], and [[John G. Jackson (writer)|John G. Jackson]].  Many of the same theories espoused in the book are repeated in the documentaries ''[[The God Who Wasn't There]]'', ''[[The Pagan Christ#CBC documentary|The Pagan Christ]]'', ''[[Zeitgeist: The Movie]]'' and ''[[Religulous]]''.

[[American Atheists]] leader [[Madalyn Murray O'Hair]] was a fan of the book.  While modern-day American historian [[Richard Carrier]] found the book to be incomplete, he appreciated some of its points.&lt;ref&gt;[http://infidels.org/library/modern/richard_carrier/graves.html infidels.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==

Graves, often citing ''[[Anacalypsis]]'' and other works by [[Godfrey Higgins]] (1772–1833) as his source, asserts in the book that many messiah-like "saviors" were crucified on a cross or tree before ascending into heaven.

"One thing is clear — the mythos of the Hindus, the mythos of the Jews and the mythos of the Greeks are all at bottom the same; and what are called their early histories are not histories of humankind, but are contrivances under the appearance of histories to perpetuate doctrines."  (Higgins, ''Anacalypsis'')

The book claims that a number of these deities or god-men shared at least some traits of Jesus as described in the New Testament, drawing the strongest similarities with Krishna.  For example, some figures had miraculous or virgin births, were sons of supreme gods, were born on December 25, had stars point to their birthplaces, were visited by shepherds and magi as infants, fled from death as children, exhibited traits of divinity in childhood, spent time in the desert, traveled as they taught, had disciples, performed miracles, were persecuted, were crucified, descended into hell after death, appeared as resurrections or apparitions, or ascended into heaven.  Graves also devotes chapters to the pagan roots of [[baptism]] and the [[eucharist]], and concludes that Jesus was not a real person.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Here I desire to impress upon the minds of my clerical brethren the important fact, that the gospel histories of Christ were written by men who had formerly been Jews (see Acts xxi. 20), and probably possessing the strong proclivity to imitate and borrow which their bible shows  was characteristic of that nation&amp;nbsp;; and being written many years after Christ's death, according to that standard Christian author, Dr. Lardner, it was impossible, under such circumstances, for them to separate (if they had desired to) the real facts and events of his life from the innumerable fictions and fables then afloat everywhere relative to the heathen Gods who had pre-enacted a similar history. Two reasons are thus furnished for their constructing a history of Christ almost identical with that of other Gods, as shown in chapters XXX., XXXI. and XXXII. of this work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graves|first=Kersey|authorlink=Kersey Graves|title=The World's Sixteen Crucified Saviors: Or, Christianity Before Christ, Containing New, Startling, and Extraordinary Revelations in Religious History, which Disclose the Oriental Origin of All the Doctrines, Principles, Precepts, and Miracles of the Christian New Testament, and Furnishing a Key for Unlocking Many of Its Sacred Mysteries, Besides Comprising the History of 16 Heathen Crucified Gods|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JGAwAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA22|year=1875|publisher=Freethought Press|pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Criticism==

American historian [[Richard Carrier]], a supporter of the [[Christ myth theory]], has written online about his concerns with ''The Sixteen Crucified Saviors''.  For example, Price argues that Graves often omits citations, uses dubious sources, mixes opinions with facts, and draws conclusions beyond the evidence presented. However, according to Carrier, there is no comprehensive rebuttal of the book, and although many of his facts are wrong, others assertions such as a December 25 birthdate among Greco-Roman sun gods are now acknowledged to be correct. Carrier argues there is a better case for the resurrection of Thracian god [[Zalmoxis]] (also called Salmoxis or Gebele'izis) and the crucifixion and resurrection of Sumerian goddess [[Inanna]] (also known as Ishtar), neither of whom are mentioned by Graves.&lt;ref&gt;http://infidels.org/library/modern/richard_carrier/graves.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tomislav Volek''', is a Czech musicologist who is best known for his research on the music of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]].

==Biography==
Spending much of his career in Prague, Volek made a virtue of necessity by exploring the musical life of eighteenth-century Bohemia, with particular emphasis on Mozart’s activities in Prague. Meticulous archival research combined with a willingness to advance daring new hypotheses led to a series of pathbreaking articles, one of which, ''“Über den Ursprung von Mozarts Oper [[La clemenza di Tito]]”'' (''Mozart-Jahrbuch'', 1959), contributed to a fundamental reassessment of one of Mozart’s late operas, although some of his theories, especially the claim that Mozart began work on the opera much earlier than the summer of 1791, have been thoroughy refuted in English-language musicological literature.&lt;ref&gt;For a summary of this literature, see Daniel E. Freeman, ''Mozart in Prague'' (2013), pp. 300-301.&lt;/ref&gt; 

His work on ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' and its Bohemian context is also of crucial importance, as is his edition of Mozart documents, ''“The Mozartiana of Czech and Moravian Archives”'' (Prague, 1991).

Volek is President of the Czech Mozart Society and a member of the Czech Academy of Sciences.

'''Vortextuality''' is a concept developed in the work of Garry Whannel, an academic thinker working in the area of the cultural analysis of media sport. Whannel uses this concept in his work to analyse and account for the ways in which some news stories acquire a rapid momentum, briefly dominating the mediascape and the [[blogosphere]].

In his book, ''Media Sport Stars, Masculinities and Moralities'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Whannel, G|year=2002|title=Media Sport Stars, Masculinities and Moralities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xh4THME06t0C&amp;pg=PT213|isbn=0-415-17038-9|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; he explained this term, noting:"The growth in the range of media outlets, and the vastly increased speed of circulation of information have combined to create the phenomenon of a "vortex" effect".

The vortextual effect produces a compression of the media agenda, in which other news items disappear from the agenda or have to be connected in some way to the dominant event. Developing this idea, Whannel observed that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Various media constantly feed off each other and, in an era of electronic and digital information exchange, the speed at which this happens has become very rapid.  Certain super-major events come to dominate the headlines to such an extent that it becomes temporarily difficult for columnists and commentators to discuss anything else.  They are drawn in, as if by a vortex."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Whannel gives the example of the [[death of Diana, Princess of Wales]] as an example of Vortextuality as this story dominated the media for days, to the extent that it removed most other items from the news agenda. Likewise, during global sporting events, such as the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] or the [[Olympic Games]], journalists and columnists with no expertise or pre-existing interest in sport comment on the event as Marshal et al. (2010) point out. Recent examples, of media vortextuality include the [[election of Barack Obama]] and the [[death of Michael Jackson]].&lt;!-- NOT PUBLISHED YET &lt;ref name=cp65&gt;Whannel, G.

'''Web design''' encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites. The different areas of web design include web graphic design; [[interface design]]; authoring, including standardised code and [[proprietary software]]; [[user experience design]]; and [[search engine optimization]]. Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them all.&lt;ref name="different jobs" &gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term web design is normally used to describe the design process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website including writing mark up. Web design partially overlaps [[web engineering]] in the broader scope of [[web development]]. Web designers are expected to have an awareness of [[Web usability|usability]] and if their role involves creating mark up then they are also expected to be up to date with [[web accessibility]] guidelines.

==History==
[[File:WebDesignBooks.JPG|thumb|Web design books in a store]]

===1988–2001===
Although web design has a fairly recent history, it can be linked to other areas such as graphic design. However, web design can also be seen from a technological standpoint. It has become a large part of people’s everyday lives. It is hard to imagine the Internet without animated graphics, different styles of typography, background, and music.

====The start of the web and web design====
In 1989, whilst working at [[CERN]] [[Tim Berners-Lee]] proposed to create a global hypertext project, which later became known as the [[World Wide Web]]. During 1991 to 1993 the World Wide Web was born. Text-only pages could be viewed using a simple line-mode browser.&lt;ref name="World Wide Web" &gt;{{cite web
  |title=Longer Biography
  |url=http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/Longer.html
  |accessdate=2012-03-16
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1993 [[Marc Andreessen]] and [[Eric Bina]], created the [[Mosaic browser]]. At the time there were multiple browsers, however the majority of them were Unix-based and naturally text heavy. There had been no integrated approach to graphic design elements such as images or sounds. The Mosaic browser broke this mould.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  |title=Mosaic Browser
  |url=http://www.techopedia.com/images/pdfs/history-of-the-internet.pdf
  |accessdate=2012-03-16
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[W3C]] was created in October 1994 to "lead the World Wide Web to its full potential by developing common protocols that promote its evolution and ensure its interoperability."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  |location=United States
  |isbn=1-56592-871-7
  |page=804
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This discouraged any one company from monopolizing a propriety browser and programming language, which could have altered the effect of the World Wide Web as a whole. The W3C continues to set standards, which can today be seen with JavaScript. In 1994 Andreessen formed Communications Corp. that later became known as [[Netscape Communications]], the Netscape 0.9 browser. Netscape created its own HTML tags without regard to the traditional standards process. For example, Netscape 1.1 included tags for changing background colours and formatting text with tables on web pages. Throughout 1996 to 1999 the [[browser wars]] began, as [[Microsoft]] and [[Netscape]] fought for ultimate browser dominance. During this time there were many new technologies in the field, notably [[Cascading Style Sheets]], [[JavaScript]], and [[Dynamic HTML]]. On the whole, the browser competition did lead to many positive creations and helped web design evolve at a rapid pace.&lt;ref name=Browsers &gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Evolution of web design ====
In 1996, Microsoft released its first competitive browser, which was complete with its own features and tags. It was also the first browser to support style sheets, which at the time was seen as an obscure authoring technique.&lt;ref name=Browsers/&gt;  The [[HTML markup]] for [[HTML element#Tables|tables]] was originally intended for displaying tabular data. However designers quickly realized the potential of using HTML tables for creating the complex, multi-column layouts that were otherwise not possible. At this time, as design and good aesthetics seemed to take precedence over good mark-up structure, and little attention was paid to semantics and [[web accessibility]]. HTML sites were limited in their design options, even more so with earlier versions of HTML. To create complex designs, many web designers had to use complicated table structures or even use blank [[spacer .GIF]] images to stop empty table cells from collapsing.&lt;ref name="Chapman, Evolution" &gt;{{citation |last=Chapman  |first=Cameron  |title=The Evolution of Web Design  |url=http://sixrevisions.com/web_design/the-evolution-of-web-design/|publisher=Six Revisions|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030030802/http://sixrevisions.com/web_design/the-evolution-of-web-design/ |archivedate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CSS]] was introduced in December 1996 by the [[W3C]] to support presentation and layout. This allowed [[HTML]] code to be semantic rather than both semantic and presentational, and improved web accessibility, see [[tableless web design]].

In 1996, [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] (originally known as FutureSplash) was developed. At the time, the Flash content development tool was relatively simple compared to now, using basic layout and drawing tools, a limited precursor to [[ActionScript]], and a timeline, but it enabled web designers to go beyond the point of HTML, [[Graphics Interchange Format#Animated GIF|animated GIFs]] and [[JavaScript]]. However, because Flash required a [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-in]], many web developers avoided using it for fear of limiting their market share due to lack of compatibility. Instead, designers reverted to gif animations (if they didn't forego using [[motion graphics]] altogether) and JavaScript for [[software widget|widgets]]. But the benefits of Flash made it popular enough among specific target markets to eventually work its way to the vast majority of browsers, and powerful enough to be used to develop entire sites.&lt;ref name="Chapman, Evolution" /&gt;

====End of the first browser wars====
During 1998 Netscape released Netscape Communicator code under an [[Open-source license|open source licence]], enabling thousands of developers to participate in improving the software. However, they decided to start from the beginning, which guided the development of the open source browser and soon expanded to a complete application platform.&lt;ref name="Browsers"/&gt;  The [[Web Standards Project]] was formed and promoted browser compliance with [[Comparison of layout engines (HTML)|HTML]] and [[Comparison of layout engines (Cascading Style Sheets)|CSS]] standards by creating [[Acid1]], [[Acid2]], and [[Acid3]] tests. 2000 was a big year for Microsoft. Internet Explorer was released for Mac; this was significant as it was the first browser that fully supported HTML 4.01 and CSS 1, raising the bar in terms of standards compliance. It was also the first browser to fully support the [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] image format.&lt;ref name="Browsers"/&gt;  During this time Netscape was sold to [[AOL]] and this was seen as Netscape’s official loss to Microsoft in the browser wars.&lt;ref name="Browsers"/&gt;

===2001–2012===
Since the start of the 21st century the web has become more and more integrated into peoples lives. As this has happened the technology of the web has also moved on. There have also been significant changes in the way people use and access the web, and this has changed how sites are designed.

Since the end of the [[Browser wars|browsers wars]]{{when|date=May 2016}} new browsers have been released. Many of these are [[open-source software|open source]] meaning that they tend to have faster development and are more supportive of new standards. The new options are considered by many{{Weasel inline|date=May 2016}} to be better than Microsoft's [[Internet Explorer]].

The [[World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]] has released new standards for HTML ([[HTML5]]) and CSS ([[CSS3]]), as well as new [[JavaScript]] [[Application programming interface|API's]], each as a new but individual standard.{{when|date=May 2016}} While the term HTML5 is only used to refer to the new version of HTML and ''some'' of the JavaScript API's, it has become common to use it to refer to the entire suite of new standards (HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript).

== Tools and technologies ==
Web designers use a variety of different tools depending on what part of the production process they are involved in. These tools are updated over time by newer standards and software but the principles behind them remain the same. Web designers use both [[Vector graphics editor|vector]] and [[Raster graphics editor|raster]] graphics editors to create web-formatted imagery or design prototypes. Technologies used to create websites include W3C standards like HTML and CSS, which can be hand-coded or generated by [[Website builder|WYSIWYG editing software]]. Other tools web designers might use include mark up [[HTML validator|validators]]&lt;ref name="W3C_validator"&gt;{{cite web|title=W3C Markup Validation Service|url=http://validator.w3.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other testing tools for usability and accessibility to ensure their websites meet web accessibility guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=W3C|title=Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)|url=http://www.w3.org/WAI/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Skills and techniques ==

=== Marketing and communication design ===
Marketing and communication design on a website may identify what works for its target market. This can be an age group or particular strand of culture; thus the designer may understand the trends of its audience. Designers may also understand the type of website they are designing, meaning, for example, that (B2B) [[business-to-business]] website design considerations might differ greatly from a consumer targeted website such as a [[retail]] or entertainment website. Careful consideration might be made to ensure that the aesthetics or overall design of a site do not clash with the clarity and accuracy of the content or the ease of [[web navigation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=THORLACIUS|first=LISBETH|title=The Role of Aesthetics in Web Design|journal=Nordicom Review|year=2007|issue=28|pages=63–76|url=http://www.nordicom.gu.se/en/tidskrifter/nordicom-review-12007/role-aesthetics-web-design|accessdate=2014-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially on a B2B website. Designers may also consider the reputation of the owner or business the site is representing to make sure they are portrayed favourably.

=== User experience design and interactive design ===
User understanding of the content of a website often depends on user understanding of how the website works. This is part of the [[user experience design]]. User experience is related to layout, clear instructions and labeling on a website. How well a user understands how they can interact on a site may also depend on the [[interactive design]] of the site. If a user perceives the usefulness of the website, they are more likely to continue using it. Users who are skilled and well versed with website use may find a more distinctive, yet less intuitive or less [[usability|user-friendly]] website interface useful nonetheless. However, users with less experience are less likely to see the advantages or usefulness of a less intuitive website interface. This drives the trend for a more universal user experience and ease of access to accommodate as many users as possible regardless of user skill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Castañeda|first=J.A Francisco |last2=Muñoz-Leiva|first2=Teodoro Luque|title=Web Acceptance Model (WAM): Moderating effects of user experience|journal=Information &amp; Management |year=2007 |volume=44 |pages=384–396|doi=10.1016/j.im.2007.02.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of the user experience design and interactive design are considered in the [[user interface design]].

Advanced interactive functions may require [[plug-in (computing)|plug-ins]] if not advanced coding language skills. Choosing whether or not to use interactivity that requires plug-ins is a critical decision in user experience design. If the plug-in doesn't come pre-installed with most browsers, there's a risk that the user will have neither the know how or the patience to install a plug-in just to access the content. If the function requires advanced coding language skills, it may be too costly in either time or money to code compared to the amount of enhancement the function will add to the user experience. There's also a risk that advanced interactivity may be incompatible with older browsers or hardware configurations. Publishing a function that doesn't work reliably is potentially worse for the user experience than making no attempt. It depends on the target audience if it's likely to be needed or worth any risks.

=== Page layout ===
Part of the user interface design is affected by the quality of the [[page layout]].  For example, a designer may consider whether the site's page layout should remain consistent on different pages when designing the layout.  Page pixel width may also be considered vital for aligning objects in the layout design. The most popular fixed-width websites generally have the same set width to match the current most popular browser window, at the current most popular screen resolution, on the current most popular monitor size. Most pages are also center-aligned for concerns of [[aesthetics]] on larger screens.

'''Fluid layouts''' increased in popularity around 2000 as an alternative to HTML-table-based layouts and [[Grid (page layout)|grid-based design]] in both page layout design principle and in coding technique, but were very slow to be adopted.&lt;ref group="note" &gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;table&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;-based markup and [[spacer .GIF]] images&lt;/ref&gt; This was due to considerations of [[Screen reader|screen reading devices]] and varying windows sizes which designers have no control over. Accordingly, a design may be broken down into units (sidebars, content blocks, [[Web banner|embedded advertising]] areas, navigation areas) that are sent to the browser and which will be fitted into the display window by the browser, as best it can. As the browser does recognize the details of the reader's screen (window size, font size relative to window etc.) the browser can make user-specific layout adjustments to fluid layouts, but not fixed-width layouts. Although such a display may often change the relative position of major content units, sidebars may be displaced below [[body text]] rather than to the side of it. This is a more flexible display than a hard-coded grid-based layout that doesn't fit the device window. In particular, the relative position of content blocks may change while leaving the content within the block unaffected. This also minimizes the user's need to horizontally scroll the page.

[[Responsive Web Design]] is a newer approach, based on CSS3, and a deeper level of per-device specification within the page's stylesheet through an enhanced use of the CSS &lt;code&gt;@media&lt;/code&gt; rule. In March 2018 Google announced they would be rolling out mobile-first indexing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2018/03/rolling-out-mobile-first-indexing.html|title=Rolling out mobile-first indexing|work=Official Google Webmaster Central Blog|access-date=2018-06-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;Sites using responsive design are well placed to ensure they meet this new approach.

===Typography===
Web designers may choose to limit the variety of website typefaces to only a few which are of a similar style, instead of using a wide range of [[typeface]]s or [[Typeface#Style of typefaces|type styles]]. Most browsers recognize a specific number of safe fonts, which designers mainly use in order to avoid complications.

Font downloading was later included in the CSS3 fonts module and has since been implemented in Safari 3.1, Opera 10 and Mozilla Firefox 3.5. This has subsequently increased interest in [[web typography]], as well as the usage of font downloading.

Most site layouts incorporate negative space to break the text up into paragraphs and also avoid center-aligned text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stone|first=John|title=20 Do’s and Don’ts of Effective Web Typography| url=http://webdesignledger.com/tips/20-dos-and-donts-of-effective-web-typography|accessdate=2012-03-19|date=2009-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motion graphics===
The page layout and user interface may also be affected by the use of motion graphics. The choice of whether or not to use motion graphics may depend on the target market for the website. Motion graphics may be expected or at least better received with an entertainment-oriented website. However, a website target audience with a more serious or formal interest (such as business, community, or government) might find animations unnecessary and distracting if only for entertainment or decoration purposes. This doesn't mean that more serious content couldn't be enhanced with animated or video presentations that is relevant to the content. In either case, [[motion graphic design]] may make the difference between more effective visuals or distracting visuals.

Motion graphics that are not initiated by the site visitor can produce accessibility issues. The World Wide Web consortium accessibility standards require that site visitors be able to disable the animations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/time-limits-pause.html World Wide Web Consortium: Understanding Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.2.2: Pause, Stop, Hide]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Quality of code ===
Website designers may consider it to be good practice to conform to standards. This is usually done via a description specifying what the element is doing. Failure to conform to standards may not make a website unusable or error prone, but standards can relate to the correct layout of pages for readability as well making sure coded elements are closed appropriately. This includes errors in code, more organized layout for code, and making sure IDs and classes are identified properly. Poorly-coded pages are sometimes colloquially called [[tag soup]]. [[W3C Markup Validation Service|Validating via W3C]]&lt;ref name="W3C_validator" /&gt; can only be done when a correct DOCTYPE declaration is made, which is used to highlight errors in code. The system identifies the errors and areas that do not conform to web design standards. This information can then be corrected by the user.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=W3C QA|title=My Web site is standard! And yours?| url=http://www.w3.org/QA/2002/04/Web-Quality|accessdate=2012-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Generated content ===
There are two ways websites are generated: statically or dynamically.

==== Static websites ====
{{Main|Static web page}}
A static website stores a unique file for every page of a static website. Each time that page is requested, the same content is returned. This content is created once, during the design of the website. It is usually manually authored, although some sites use an automated creation process, similar to a dynamic website, whose results are stored long-term as completed pages. These automatically-created static sites became more popular around 2015, with generators such as [[Jekyll (software)|Jekyll]] and [[Adobe Muse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The benefits of a static website are that they were simpler to host, as their server only needed to serve static content, not execute server-side scripts. This required less server administration and had less chance of exposing security holes. They could also serve pages more quickly, on low-cost server hardware. These advantage became less important as cheap web hosting expanded to also offer dynamic features, and [[virtual machine|virtual server]]s offered high performance for short intervals at low cost.

Almost all websites have some static content, as supporting assets such as images and stylesheets are usually static, even on a website with highly dynamic pages.

==== Dynamic websites ====
{{Main|Dynamic web page}}
Dynamic websites are generated on the fly and use server-side technology to generate webpages. They typically extract their content from one or more back-end databases: some are database queries across a relational database to query a catalogue or to summarise numeric information, others may use a [[document database]] such as [[MongoDB]] or [[NoSQL]] to store larger units of content, such as blog posts or wiki articles.

In the design process, dynamic pages are often mocked-up or [[website wireframe|wireframe]]d using static pages. The skillset needed to develop dynamic web pages is much broader than for a static pages, involving server-side and database coding as well as client-side interface design. Even medium-sized dynamic projects are thus almost always a team effort.

When dynamic web pages first developed, they were typically coded directly in languages such as [[Perl]], [[PHP]] or [[Active Server Pages|ASP]]. Some of these, notably PHP and ASP, used a 'template' approach where a server-side page resembled the structure of the completed client-side page and data was inserted into places defined by 'tags'. This was a quicker means of development than coding in a purely procedural coding language such as Perl.

Both of these approaches have now been supplanted for many websites by higher-level application-focused tools such as [[content management system]]s.  These build on top of general purpose coding platforms and assume that a website exists to offer content according to one of several well recognised models, such as a time-sequenced [[blog]], a thematic magazine or news site, a wiki or a user forum. These tools make the implementation of such a site very easy, and a purely organisational and design-based task, without requiring any coding.

Editing the content itself (as well as the template page) can be done both by means of the site itself, and with the use of third-party software. The ability to edit all pages is provided only to a specific category of users (for example, administrators, or registered users). In some cases, anonymous users are allowed to edit certain web content, which is less frequent (for example, on forums - adding messages). An example of a site with an anonymous change is [[Wikipedia]].

==Homepage design==
Usability experts, including [[Jakob Nielsen (usability consultant)|Jakob Nielsen]] and Kyle Soucy, have often emphasised homepage design for website success and asserted that the homepage is the most important page on a website.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.usableinterface.com/articles/homepage.php|first=Kyle|last=Soucy|archivedate=8 June 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608071219/http://www.usableinterface.com/articles/homepage.php |title=Is Your Homepage Doing What It Should?|publisher=Usable Interface}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Nielsen|Tahir|2001}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.nngroup.com/articles/most-violated-homepage-guidelines/|title=The Ten Most Violated Homepage Design Guidelines|date=10 November 2003|first=Jakob|last=Nielsen|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005150112/http://www.nngroup.com/articles/most-violated-homepage-guidelines/ |archivedate=5 October 2013|publisher=Nielsen Norman Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://sixrevisions.com/web_design/essential-tips-for-designing-an-effective-homepage/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821151637/http://sixrevisions.com/web_design/essential-tips-for-designing-an-effective-homepage/ |archivedate=21 August 2013|date=20 August 2009|first=Kayla|last=Knight|publisher=Six Revisions|title=Essential Tips for Designing an Effective Homepage}}&lt;/ref&gt; However practitioners into the 2000s were starting to find that a growing number of website traffic was bypassing the homepage, going directly to internal content pages through search engines, e-newsletters and RSS feeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.uie.com/brainsparks/2005/09/29/is-home-page-design-relevant-anymore/|publisher=User Interface Engineering|first=Jared|last=Spool|date=29 September 2005|archivedate=16 September 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130916092857/http://www.uie.com/brainsparks/2005/09/29/is-home-page-design-relevant-anymore/ |title=Is Home Page Design Relevant Anymore?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading many practitioners to argue that homepages are less important than most people think.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=10 Usability Tips Based on Research Studies|url=http://sixrevisions.com/usabilityaccessibility/10-usability-tips-based-on-research-studies/|first=Cameron|last=Chapman|date=15 September 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902031226/http://sixrevisions.com/usabilityaccessibility/10-usability-tips-based-on-research-studies/ |archivedate=2 September 2013|publisher=Six Revisions}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://uxmyths.com/post/717779908/myth-the-homepage-is-your-most-important-page|title=Myth #17: The homepage is your most important page|first=Zoltán|last=Gócza|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602172028/http://uxmyths.com/post/717779908/myth-the-homepage-is-your-most-important-page |archivedate=2 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://giraffeforum.com/wordpress/2010/04/18/the-decline-of-the-homepage/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524221238/http://giraffeforum.com/wordpress/2010/04/18/the-decline-of-the-homepage/ |archivedate=24 May 2013|title=The decline of the homepage|first=Gerry|last=McGovern|date=18 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Prioritizing Design Time: A Long Tail Approach|first=Joshua|last=Porter|date=24 April 2006|publisher=User Interface Engineering|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514075119/http://www.uie.com/articles/prioritizing_design_time/ |archivedate=14 May 2013|url=http://www.uie.com/articles/prioritizing_design_time/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jared Spool argued in 2007 that a site's homepage was actually the least important page on a website.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.uie.com/brainsparks/2007/08/06/usability-tools-podcast-home-page-design/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130429113949/http://www.uie.com/brainsparks/2007/08/06/usability-tools-podcast-home-page-design/ |archivedate=29 April 2013|first=Jared|last=Spool|date=6 August 2007|title=Usability Tools Podcast: Home Page Design}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 and 2013, carousels (also called 'sliders' and 'rotating banners') have become an extremely popular design element on homepages, often used to showcase featured or recent content in a confined space.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Best practices in carousel design for effective web marketing|first=Chris|last=Bates|date=9 October 2012|publisher=Smart Insights|url=http://www.smartinsights.com/conversion-optimisation/home-page-optimisation/carousels-design-best-practice/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403013507/http://www.smartinsights.com/conversion-optimisation/home-page-optimisation/carousels-design-best-practice/ |archivedate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Messner2013&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.usability.gov/get-involved/blog/2013/04/image-carousels.html |title=Image Carousels: Getting Control of the Merry-Go-Round|first=Katie|last=Messner|publisher=Usability.gov|date=22 April 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010094459/http://www.usability.gov/get-involved/blog/2013/04/image-carousels.html |archivedate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many practitioners argue that carousels are an ineffective design element and hurt a website's search engine optimisation and usability.&lt;ref name=Messner2013/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://searchengineland.com/homepage-sliders-are-bad-for-seo-usability-163496|archivedate=22 November 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131122031942/http://searchengineland.com/homepage-sliders-are-bad-for-seo-usability-163496 |title=Homepage Sliders: Bad For SEO, Bad For Usability|first=Harrison|last=Jones|date=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://conversionxl.com/dont-use-automatic-image-sliders-or-carousels-ignore-the-fad/|title=Don’t Use Automatic Image Sliders or Carousels, Ignore the Fad|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131125013642/http://conversionxl.com/dont-use-automatic-image-sliders-or-carousels-ignore-the-fad/ |archivedate=25 November 2013|first=Peep|last=Laja|date=27 September 2012|publisher=ConversionXL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Occupations ==
There are two primary jobs involved in creating a website: the web designer and [[web developer]], who often work closely together on a website.&lt;ref name ="careersinwebdesign"&gt;{{cite book|last=Oleksy|first=Walter|title=Careers in Web Design| year=2001|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=9780823931910 |pages=9–11|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-OJSA5wS7kQC&amp;pg=PA9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The web designers are responsible for the visual aspect, which includes the layout, coloring and typography of a web page. Web designers will also have a working knowledge of [[markup language]]s such as HTML and CSS, although the extent of their knowledge will differ from one web designer to another.  Particularly in smaller organizations one person will need the necessary skills for designing and programming the full web page, while larger organizations may have a web designer responsible for the visual aspect alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Web Designer|url=http://www.myjobsearch.com/careers/web-designer.html|accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;


Further jobs which may become involved in the creation of a website include:  
*[[Graphic designers]] to create visuals for the site such as logos, layouts and buttons
*Internet marketing specialists to help maintain web presence through strategic solutions on targeting viewers to the site, by using marketing and promotional techniques on the internet
*SEO writers to research and recommend the correct words to be incorporated into a particular website and make the website more accessible and found on numerous search engines
*Internet copywriter to create the written content of the page to appeal to the targeted viewers of the site&lt;ref name="different jobs" /&gt;
*User experience [[User experience design|(UX) designer]] incorporates aspects of user focused design considerations which include information architecture, user centered design, user testing, interaction design, and occasionally visual design.
