Adaptive Physical Education (APE) is a physical education program that accommodates the needs of students with disabilities, that may include or be a combination of mobility or physical impairments, sensory impairments, intellectual disabilities, emotional or behavioural disorders.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Health and Physical Education: Rationale - The Australian Curriculum v7.5|url = http://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/health-and-physical-education/rationale|website = www.australiancurriculum.edu.au|accessdate = 2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Greenwood Dictionary of Education (2nd Edition)|last = Collins|first = J.W.|publisher = Praeger|year = 2011|isbn = |location = Westport, CT|pages = |url = http://www.ebrary.com.ipacez.nd.edu.au|last2 = O'Brien|first2 = N.P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Physical education is important for the health and wellbeing of everyone, regardless of disabilities or not. APE programs are vital in maintaining and enhancing the quality of life for people with disabilities.

Australia’s physical education curriculum for adaptive students is currently the same as students without disabilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Australian education institutions are required by the [[Disability Discrimination Act 1992]] and the [https://education.gov.au/disability-standards-education Disability Standards for Education 2005] to instruct physical education to students with disabilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==
Adaptive physical education evolved from medical treatments that were designed to cope with disabilities. In 1838, [[Perkins School for the Blind|Perkins School]] located in Boston, Massachusetts, an educational institute for visually impaired students, began introducing physical education programs for their students.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Adapted Physical Education and Sport|last = Winnick|first = J.P.|publisher = Human Kinetics|year = 2011|isbn = 9780736089180|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1870s, the [[Ohio School for the Deaf|Ohio school for the Deaf]] instituted organised sports into the school for their students.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Pehr Henrik Ling]], who founded the [http://www.gih.se/in-english/ Swedish School of Sports and Health Sciences] in 1813 in Stockholm, Sweden&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.gih.se/in-english/|title = GIH The Swedish School of Sports and Health Sciences: In English|date = |accessdate = |website = GIH The Swedish School of Sports and Health Sciences|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; developed medical gymnastic programs for people with disabilities in 1884.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Legislation ==
The legislation for the APE in Australia is as follows:
* [[Disability Discrimination Act 1992]] provides protection against any person that is discriminated against because of a disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.humanrights.gov.au/dda-guide-whats-it-all-about|title = D.D.A guide: What's it all about|date = |accessdate = |website = Australian Human Rights Commission|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [https://education.gov.au/disability-standards-education Disability Standards for Education 2005] defines the responsibilities of educational institutions for students with disabilities. It also ensures that students with disabilities have access and are engaging in education on the same basis as students without disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://education.gov.au/disability-standards-education|title = Disability Standards for Education|date = |accessdate = |website = Australian Government Department of Education and Training|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impairments and Disabilities ==

=== Mobility or Physical Impairments ===

==== Cerebral Palsy ====
* Cerebral palsy is a group of disorders that affects a person's motor control areas in the brain that hinders their ability to move. It can affect one or more body parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.cerebralpalsy.org.au/what-is-cerebral-palsy/|title = What is cerebral palsy?|date = |accessdate = |website = Cerebral Palsy Alliance|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Brain Injury.jpg|thumb|Brain Injury]] --&gt;

==== Brain Injuries ====
* Brain injuries are injuries that diminish or impair physical, cognitive, social, behaviour or emotional functions of a person.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Spinal Cord Disabilities ====
* Spinal cord disabilities are damage to the vertebrae or nerves of the spinal column resulting from disease or injury. Spinal cord injuries are generally associated with a degree of [[paralysis]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Muscular, Joint, &amp; Central nervous system (CNS) Disabilities ====
* Muscular, joint, and CNS disabilities are generally progressive and degenerative diseases. They can cause atrophied muscles, reduce motor skills, shorten range of motion and hinder the ability to perform physical activities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
** [[Muscular dystrophy]] is a genetically inherited disease characterised by a progressive spread of weakness through various muscle groups or motor neurones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.mda.org.au/Disorders/Overview.asp|title = What are muscular dystrophies and neuromuscular conditions?|date = |accessdate = |website = Muscular Dystrophy Australia|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Juvenile idiopathic arthritis|Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis]] causes persistent pain and swelling in joints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/juvenile-rheumatoid-arthritis/basics/definition/con-20014378|title = Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis: definition|date = |accessdate = |website = Mayo Clinic|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sensory Impairments ===

==== Visual impairments ====
* Visual impairments as defined by the [[Royal Institute for Deaf and Blind Children]] (RIDBC) as a limitation to one or more functions of the eye or visual systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ridbc.org.au/blindness|title = Vision|date = |accessdate = |website = The Royal Institute for Deaf and Blind Children|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Deaf ====
* Deaf is severe or profound hearing loss that causes insufficient comprehension of auditory information.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Deafblind ====
* The [http://www.deafblind.org.au Australia Deafblind Council] (ADBC) defines deafblindness as an isolated sensory disability that results in a combination of loss to both vision and hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.deafblind.org.au|title = What is deafblindness?|date = |accessdate = |website = Australian Deafblind Council|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intellectual Disabilities &amp; Emotional, Developmental and Behavioural Disorders ===
* Intellectual disabilities are defined, by the [http://aaidd.org American Association of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (AAIDD)], as a serious impediment of intellectual functioning and the ability to adapt behaviour in both social and practical skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://aaidd.org/intellectual-disability/definition#.VeV4D85UTsk|title = Definition of Intellectual Disability|date = |accessdate = |website = American Association of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Down syndrome|Down Syndrome]] is a genetic condition that causes developmental, intellectual and physical disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.downsyndromevictoria.org.au/DSAV/Information/About_Down_syndrome/What_is_Down_syndrome/DSAV/information/What_is_Down_syndrome.aspx?hkey=8593b017-ec7a-47f1-b949-e7e9801b4c39|title = What is Down Syndrome?|date = |accessdate = |website = Down Syndrome Victoria|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Emotional and behavioural disorders are generally labeled as having disruptive hyperactive, distracting, withdrawn and/or impetuous behaviour tendencies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These emotional and behavioural disorders can hinder and negatively affect a student's educational capabilities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
** [[Autism spectrum disorder]]s are developmental disabilities that affect how persons interact with their environment and the people around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.autismspectrum.org.au/content/what-autism|title = What is Autism|date = |accessdate = |website = Autism Spectrum|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disability Specific Guidelines for Instruction of APE ===
Impairments and disabilities for APE students can vary or may even coexist with more than one disability. A students physical capabilities in APE will depend on their impairment or disability. These impairments and/or disabilities need to be addressed in the design of the students APE curriculum by their teachers or instructors of APE to ensure that the student is receiving the most beneficial physical educational program.

=== Mobility Impairments ===
[[File:ParalympicsGB preparing for their 7-a-side game (9375546563).jpg|thumb|People with Cerebral Palsy competing in the Paralympic Games]]

==== Cerebral Palsy ====
* Students with cerebral palsy should carryout moderate aerobic activity for body composition and musculoskeletal functioning. Strength and flexibility training should be focused on maintaining a balance between flexor and extensor muscles. Motor coordination for students with cerebral palsy can be difficult, so balance and body coordination should be integrated into their APE program.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Brain Injuries ====
* Students of APE that have sustained brain injuries will commonly display balance problems and weak muscle movement. These students need to maintain moderate aerobic activity for body composition and musculoskeletal functioning. Strength training should be integrated to improve muscle weakness and motor control skills may need to be relearned.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Spinal Cord Disabilities ====
* Depending on the type of spinal cord disability that a student displays, will determine the type activities that are included in their APE program. Regardless of their spinal cord disability, these students need to engage in APE.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Muscular, Joint, &amp; Central Nervous System (CNS) disabilities ====
* Students that have muscular, joint, or CNS disabilities need to engage in strength training and endurance activities for as long as capably possible, due to the progressive nature of these disabilities. The APE teacher should ensure that an adequate warm-up and cool-down focusing on flexibility are performed by the students.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Sensory Impairments ===

==== Visual impairments ====
* Students with visual impairments have the capabilities to perform all the same physical activities as students without these impairments. However, due to lack or loss of vision, adaptations to some physical activities will need to be made for these students. Depending on the extent of their impairment, APE teachers can introduce bright colours balls or use audial cues to direct the students in physical activities. APE programs for these students should include open sports where there are changing variables, and closed sports where the activity is consistent and predictable.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Deaf ====
* Students that are deaf have no limitations to their physical capabilities. However, communication skills will need to be adapted for their impairment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Deafblind ====
* Students that have deafblindness have the ability to perform same physical activities as students without deafblindness. However, due to their impairment, adaptations that are used for blind and deaf students will need to be implemented into their APE program.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Intellectual Disabilities &amp; Emotional and Behavioural Disorders ===
Students with intellectual disabilities need to have APE programs that are appropriately designed and take into consideration their academic, physical, motor, social and emotional skills.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Students with emotional and behavioural disorders can create instructional dilemmas for APE teachers. Ideas for managing and instructing APE to these students are to have interpersonal communication, active listening, verbal mediation and conflict resolution schemes incorporated into the students physical education program.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
[[File:JBLM hosts Special Olympics 140530-A-QM563-008.jpg|thumb|Down Syndrome students competing in Special Olympics]]

==== Down Syndrome ====
* Students with Down Syndrome that participate in APE need medical clearance due to the many medical problems they face. However they should still engage in aerobic activities, muscle strengthening, motor control skills, and balance building activities. Adapted equipment can be used to engage students in these activities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Autism spectrum disorder ====
* Students that have been diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder do not necessarily need to be in an APE program. However, if it is decided that they need to participate in an APE program, the APE teacher needs to respond to the individual needs required by that student, which maybe one-on-one instruction. These students should engage in as much of the required PE curriculum as possible.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Allan Hills 84001''' (commonly abbreviated '''ALH84001'''&lt;ref name=database&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meteor/metbull.php?sea=alh+84001&amp;sfor=names&amp;ants=&amp;falls=&amp;stype=contains&amp;lrec=50&amp;map=ge&amp;browse=&amp;country=All&amp;srt=name&amp;categ=All&amp;mblist=All&amp;phot=&amp;snew=0&amp;pnt=no&amp;code=604|title=Meteoritical Bulletin Database: Allan Hills 84001}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Martian meteorite]] that was found in [[Allan Hills]], [[Antarctica]] on December 27, 1984, by a team of U.S. meteorite hunters from the [[ANSMET]] project. Like other members of the group of [[Martian meteorite|SNC]]s ([[shergottite]], [[nakhlite]], [[chassignite]]), ALH84001 is thought to be from [[Mars]]. However, it does not fit into any of the previously discovered SNC groups. On discovery, its [[mass]] was {{Convert|1.93|kg}}.

In 1996, a group of scientists claimed to have found evidence for microscopic fossils of Martian bacteria in the meteorite, culminating in then U.S. president Bill Clinton giving a speech about the potential discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/snc/clinton.html|title=President Clinton Statement Regarding Mars Meteorite Discovery|author=|date=|website=www2.jpl.nasa.gov|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These claims were controversial from the beginning, and the wider scientific community ultimately rejected the hypothesis once all the unusual features in the meteorite had been explained without requiring life to be present. Despite there being no convincing evidence of Martian life, the initial paper and scientific and public attention caused by it are considered to be turning points in the history of the developing science of [[astrobiology]].&lt;ref name=disbelief/&gt;

In September 2005, Vicky Hamilton of the [[University of Hawaii at Manoa]] presented an analysis of the origin of ALH84001 using data from the [[Mars Global Surveyor]] and [[Mars Odyssey]] spacecraft orbiting Mars. According to the analysis, [[Eos Chasma]] in the [[Valles Marineris]] canyon appears to be the source of the meteorite.&lt;ref name="location"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn8004|title=Birthplace of famous Mars meteorite pinpointed|work=[[New Scientist]]|accessdate=March 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The analysis was not conclusive, in part because it was limited to areas of Mars not obscured by dust.

The theory holds that ALH84001 was blasted off from the surface of Mars by a meteor impact about 17 million years ago&lt;ref name="impact"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Evidence for ancient Martian life|url=http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mgs/sci/fifthconf99/6142.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fell on Earth roughly 13,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/lpi/meteorites/The_Meteorite.shtml |title=How could ALH84001 get from Mars to Earth? |work=Lunar and Planetary Institute |publisher=LPI |date=2014 |accessdate=2014-05-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These dates were established by a variety of [[radiometric dating]] techniques, including [[samarium–neodymium dating|samarium–neodymium]] (Sm–Nd), [[Rubidium–strontium dating|rubidium–strontium]] (Rb–Sr), [[Potassium–argon dating|potassium–argon]] (K–Ar), and [[Radiocarbon dating|carbon-14]].&lt;ref name="age1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nyquist|first=L.

ALH84001 is the only meteorite collected from such a time period.&lt;ref name=disbelief/&gt;

In October 2011 it was reported that isotopic analysis indicated that the carbonates in ALH84001 were precipitated at a temperature of 18&amp;nbsp;°C with water and carbon dioxide from the [[Martian atmosphere]]. The carbonate carbon and oxygen isotope ratios imply deposition of the carbonates from a gradually evaporating subsurface water body, probably a shallow aquifer meters or tens of meters below the surface.&lt;ref name="aqueous environment"&gt;{{cite web|title=Carbonates in the Martian meteorite Allan Hills 84001 formed at 18 ± 4 °C in a near-surface aqueous environment|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2011/09/26/1109444108.abstract|publisher=[[PNAS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

N.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under a [[scanning electron microscope]], structures were revealed that some scientists interpreted as  [[fossils]] of [[bacteria]]-like lifeforms. The structures found on ALH84001 are {{Nowrap|20–100 [[nanometre]]s}} in diameter, similar in size to theoretical [[nanobacteria]], but smaller than any [[cellular life]] known at the time of their discovery. If the structures had been fossilized lifeforms, as was proposed by the so-called biogenic hypothesis of their formation, they would have been the first solid evidence of the existence of [[extraterrestrial life]], aside from the chance of their origin being terrestrial contamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=McSween, H. Y.|title=Evidence for life in a martian meteorite?|journal=GSA Today|volume=7|issue=7|pages=1–7|date=1997|pmid=11541665}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The announcement of possible [[extraterrestrial life]] caused considerable controversy. When the discovery was announced, many immediately conjectured that the fossils were the first true evidence of extraterrestrial life—making headlines around the world, and even prompting the [[President of the United States]] [[Bill Clinton]] to make a formal televised announcement to mark the event.&lt;ref name="clinton"&gt;{{cite web|title=President Clinton Statement Regarding Mars Meteorite Discovery|url=http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/snc/clinton.html|last=Clinton|first=Bill|publisher=NASA|date=1996-08-07|accessdate=2006-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David S. McKay at NASA argued that likely microbial terrestrial contamination found in other Martian meteorites does not resemble the microscopic shapes in the ALH84001. In particular, the shapes within the ALH84001 look intergrown or embedded in the indigenous material, while likely contamination does not.&lt;ref name="jsc2009"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Origins of magnetite nanocrystals in Martian meteorite ALH84001 |journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta |date=2009 |last= Thomas-Keprta |first=K.

Golden.&lt;ref name="jsc2004"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/news/releases/2004/J04-025.html |title=NASA – Press Release #J04-025 |publisher=Nasa.gov |accessdate=2012-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; David McKay says these results were obtained using unrealistically pure raw materials as a starting point,&lt;ref name=disbelief/&gt; and "will not explain many of the features described by us in ALH84001." According to McKay, a plausible inorganic model "must explain simultaneously all of the properties that we and others have suggested as possible biogenic properties of this meteorite."&lt;ref name="jsc2004"/&gt; The rest of the scientific community disagreed with McKay.&lt;ref name=disbelief/&gt;

In November 2009, a team of scientists at [[Johnson Space Center]], including McKay, argued that since their original paper was published, the biogenic hypothesis has been "further strengthened by the presence of abundant fossil-like structures in other Martian meteorites."{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} &lt;!-- &lt;ref name="jsc2009"/&gt; --&gt;However, the scientific consensus is that "morphology alone cannot be used unambiguously as a tool for primitive life detection."&lt;ref name=morphology&gt;{{cite journal | title = Morphological behavior of inorganic precipitation systems – Instruments, Methods, and Missions for Astrobiology II | journal = SPIE Proceedings | date = December 30, 1999 | first = Juan-Manuel Garcia-Ruiz | volume = Proc.

Features that have been interpreted as suggesting the presence of microfossils include:

* The structures resemble some modern terrestrial bacteria and their appendages. Though some are smaller than any present day Earth microbes, others are of the order of 100 - 200&amp;nbsp;nm in size, within the size limits of [[nanobacteria]] and some are up to 1 to 2 microns in diameter.&lt;ref name="impact" /&gt; The smallest ones are too small to contain all the systems of modern life.&lt;ref name="disbelief" /&gt; 
* Some of the structures resemble colonies and biofilms.&lt;ref name="impact" /&gt; However, there are many instances of morphologies that suggested life and were later shown to be due to inorganic processes.&lt;ref name="impact" /&gt;
* The meteorite contains [[magnetite]] crystals of the unusual rectangular prism type, and organized into domains all about the same size, indistinguishable from magnetite produced biologically on Earth and not matching any known nonbiological magnetite that forms naturally on Earth.&lt;ref name="impact" /&gt; The magnetite is embedded in the carbonate. If found on Earth it would be a very strong biosignature. However, in 2001, scientists were able to explain and produce carbonate globules containing similar magnetite grains through an inorganic process simulating conditions ALH84001 experienced on Mars.&lt;ref name="disbelief" /&gt;
* It contains [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs) concentrated in the regions containing the carbonate globules, and these have been shown to be indigenous. Other organics such as amino acids do not follow this pattern and are probably due to Antarctic contamination. However PAHs are also found in asteroids, comets and meteorites, and in deep space, all in the absence of life.&lt;ref name="disbelief"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1089/ast.2016.1533 Habitability on Early Mars and the Search for Biosignatures with the ExoMars Rover].

===RNA world hypothesis===
{{main|RNA world hypothesis}}
A workshop on the limitations of size of microbes in 1999 found that though modern nanobacteria can't be smaller in volume than the interior of a sphere of diameter 250 ± 50&amp;nbsp;nm, primitive microorganisms based on a single-polymer system could be. They cite the example of RNA based life, with [[ribozymes]] (catalytic RNA) taking the place of the much larger [[ribosomes]] as enzymes for cell replication. The cells also wouldn't have proteins and would have no need to translate DNA to mRNA. The result could be cells as small as a sphere 50&amp;nbsp;nm in diameter. These [[RNA World]] cells are one of the suggestions made to bridge the gap between abiotic chemistry and modern cells.

The main suggestions they gave that could explain the small size are that

* Cells could shrink after death
* The fossils could be remains of fragments of larger organisms
* They could be pathogens or symbiotes which depend on a host
* They could live in consortia of smaller cells unable to survive independently on their own
* They could be based on biological systems different from the ones we understand (such as the RNA World cells).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Size Limits of Very Small Microorganisms: Proceedings of a Workshop (1999)|date=1999|url=https://www.nap.edu/read/9638/chapter/2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RNA world hypothesis is still under consideration, with chemist [[Steven A. Benner]] and physicist [[Paul Davies]] supporting it in a chapter of the book "Frontiers of Astrobiology" published in 2012 by the Cambridge University Press, in the chapter "Towards a Theory of Life"&lt;ref name="Benner"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven a.

'''Biolinguistics''' is the study of the [[biology]] and [[evolution]] of [[language]].  It is a highly interdisciplinary field, including [[Linguistics|linguists]], [[biologist]]s, [[Neuroscience|neuroscientists]], [[psychologists]], [[Mathematician|mathematicians,]] and others. By shifting the focus of investigation in linguistics to a comprehensive scheme that embraces [[natural science]]s, it seeks to yield a framework by which we can understand the fundamentals of the faculty of language.

==Origins==
The biolinguistic perspective began to take shape in the mid-twentieth century, among the linguists influenced by the developments in biology and mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chomsky|first= Noam|year= 2004|title= Biolinguistics and the Human Capacity. Lecture delivered at MTA, Budapest, May 17, 2004|url= http://www.chomsky.info/talks/20040517.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eric Lenneberg|Eric Lenneberg’s]] ''Biological Foundations of Language'' remains a basic document of the field.&lt;ref&gt;Lenneberg, Eric. 1967. ''Biological Foundations of Language''. New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, the first Biolinguistic conference was organized by [[Massimo Piattelli-Palmarini]], bringing together [[Evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologists]], neuroscientists, linguists, and others interested in the development of language in the individual, its origins, and evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boeckx|first1= Cedric |first2= Massimo |last2=Piattelli-Palmarini |year=2005|title= Language as a natural object, linguistics as a natural science. Linguistic Review 22: 447–466 |url=http://www.dingo.sbs.arizona.edu/~massimo/publications/PDF/BoeckxMPPLingReview2005.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developments==
Recent work in [[theoretical linguistics]] and [[Cognitive science|cognitive studies]] at [[MIT]] construes human language as a highly non-redundant species-specific system. [[Noam Chomsky]]'s latest contribution to the study of the mind in general and language in particular is his minimalist approach to syntactic representations. This effort to understand how much of language can be given a principled explanation has resulted in the [[minimalist program]].  In syntax, lexical items are merged externally, building argument representations; next, the internal merge induces movement and creates constituent structures where each is part of a larger unit. This mechanism allows people to combine words into infinite strings. If this is true, then the objective of biolinguists is to find out as much as we can about the principles underlying mental [[recursion]].

==Hypothesis==
It is possible that the core principles of the language faculty be correlated to [[natural law]]s (such as for example, the [[Fibonacci sequence]]&amp;mdash;an array of numbers where each consecutive number is a sum of the two that precede it, see for example the discussion Uriagereka 1997 and Carnie and Medeiros 2005).&lt;ref&gt;Soschen, Alona. 2006. Natural Law: The Dynamics of Syntactic Representations in the Minimalist Program. DEAL. Linguistics in Potsdam 25. {{cite web |url=http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221083019/http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf |archivedate=2007-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the hypothesis being developed, the essential properties of language arise from nature itself: the efficient growth requirement appears everywhere, from the pattern of petals in flowers, leaf arrangements in trees and the spirals of a seashell to the structure of DNA and proportions of human head and body. If this law applies to existing systems of cognition, both in humans and non-humans, then what allows our mind to create language? Could it be that a single cycle exists, a unique component of which gives rise to our ability to construct sentences, refer to ourselves and other persons, group objects and establish relations between them, and eventually understand each other? The answer to this question will be a landmark breakthrough, not only within linguistics but in our understanding of cognition in general.

==Critiques==
David Poeppel, a [[Neuroscience|neuroscientist]] and linguist, has noted that if neuroscience and linguistics are done wrong, there is a risk of "inter-disciplinary cross-sterilization", arguing that there is a ''Granularity Mismatch Problem'', as different levels of representations used in linguistics and neural science lead to vague metaphors linking brain structures to linguistic components. Poeppel and Embick also introduce the ''Ontological Incommensurability Problem'', where computational processes described in linguistic theory cannot be restored to neural computational processes. Poeppel suggests that [[Neurolinguistics|neurolinguistic]] research should try to have theories of how the brain encodes linguistic information and what could be cognitively realistic computation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Poeppel | first=David | last2=Embick | first2=David | chapter=Defining the Relation Between Linguistics and Neuroscience | title=Twenty-First Century Psycholinguistics: Four Cornerstones | editor=Anne Cutler | year=2005 | publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more positive critique comes from the side of [[biosemiotics]], claiming that meaning-making begins far before the emergence of human language.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ekaterina Velmezova|Velmezova, Ekaterina]]; [[Kalevi Kull|Kull, Kalevi]]; Cowley, Stephen (eds.) 2015.

The '''Center for the Evaluation of Language and Communication Technologies (CELCT)''' was an organisation devoted to the evaluation of language technologies, located in [[Povo]], [[Trento]] ([[Italy]]).

CELCT was established in 2003 by [[Fondazione Bruno Kessler|FBK]] (Fondazione Bruno Kessler) and [[German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence|DFKI]] (Deutsches Forschungszentrum für Künstliche Intelligenz), and was funded by the [[Trentino|Autonomous Province of Trento]]. The goals of CELCT were "to set up infrastructures and develop skills in order to operate successfully in the field of the evaluation of language and communication technologies, becoming a reference point in the field at the national and European levels."&lt;ref name="CELCT"&gt;{{cite web|title=CELCT web site|url=http://www.celct.it/about-us.php|accessdate=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
CELCT interpreted its mission by carrying out several activities in the field of [[language technology|HLT]] evaluation, mainly focusing on the organization of national and international evaluation campaigns and on the creation of [[speech corpus|speech]] and [[text corpus|text]] corpora in different [[language]]s and at different linguistic [[annotation]] levels.&lt;ref name="CELCT" /&gt;

CELCT's activities were closed on December 31, 2013. The staff working at CELCT at the time of its closure is continuing their research activities within [[Fondazione Bruno Kessler|FBK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Fondazione Bruno Kessler website|url=http://www.fbk.eu/|accessdate=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''chord''' is a concurrency construct available in [[Polyphonic C sharp|Polyphonic C♯]] and [[Cω]] inspired by the join pattern of the [[join-calculus]].  A chord is a function body that is associated with multiple function headers and cannot execute until all function headers are called.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://research.microsoft.com/Comega/doc/comega_whatis.htm | title=Cω Overview | accessdate=2008-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synchronicity ==
[[Cω]] defines two types of functions synchronous and asynchronous.  A synchronous function acts like a standard function in most Object-Oriented Language, upon invocation the function body is executed and a return value may or may not be returned to the caller.  An asynchronous function acts similar to a function that returns void except that it is guaranteed to return immediately with the execution being done in a separate thread.

[[Greenhouse gas removal]] approaches, of which [[carbon dioxide removal]] represents the most prominent subcategory addresses the cause of global warming by removing [[greenhouse gases]] from the [[atmosphere]]. Solar radiation management attempts to offset effects of greenhouse gases by causing the [[Earth]] to absorb less [[solar radiation]].

Climate engineering approaches are sometimes viewed as additional potential options for limiting [[climate change]] or its impacts, alongside [[mitigation of global warming|mitigation]] and [[adaptation to global warming|adaptation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Climate Intervention: Reflecting Sunlight to Cool Earth {{!}} The National Academies Press|url = http://www.nap.edu/catalog/18988/climate-intervention-reflecting-sunlight-to-cool-earth|doi = 10.17226/18988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Royal Society|url = https://royalsociety.org/~/media/Royal_Society_Content/policy/publications/2009/8693.pdf|website = royalsociety.org|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is substantial agreement among scientists that climate engineering cannot substitute for [[climate change mitigation]]. Some approaches might be used as accompanying measures to sharp cuts in [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = T. M.

Almost all research into solar radiation management has to date consisted of computer modelling or laboratory tests, and an attempt to move to outdoor experimentation has proven controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/geoengineering-technology-could-cool-the-planet-2017-7 |title=A last-resort ‘planet-hacking’ plan could make Earth habitable for longer – but scientists warn it could have dramatic consequences |author=Kevin Loria |date=July 20, 2017 |website=[[Business Insider]] |access-date=August 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some [[carbon dioxide removal]] practices, such as [[tree planting|afforestation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = P.| title = Forests and global warming mitigation in Brazil: opportunities in the Brazilian forest sector for responses to global warming under the "clean development mechanism"| journal = Biomass and Bioenergy| last1 = Fearnside| volume = 16| issue = 3| pages = 171–189| year = 1999| doi = 10.1016/S0961-9534(98)00071-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;, ecosystem restoration and [[bio-energy with carbon capture and storage]] projects, are underway to a limited extent.

Most experts and major reports advise against relying on climate engineering techniques as a main solution to global warming, in part due to the large uncertainties over effectiveness and side effects. However, most experts also argue that the risks of such interventions must be seen in the context of risks of dangerous global warming.&lt;ref name="perspectives"&gt;{{cite book

==History==
{{See also|History of climate change science}}
The 1965 landmark report, "Restoring the Quality of Our Environment" by U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson’s Science Advisory Committee warned of the harmful effects of fossil fuel emissions, the report also mentioned "deliberately bringing about countervailing climatic changes," including by "raising the albedo, or reflectivity, of the Earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/09/03/geoengineering-a-short-history/|title=Geoengineering: A Short History|year=2013|publisher=Foreign Policy}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Teller|Teller]] et al. 1997 suggested to research and deploy reflective particles, to reduce incoming solar radiation, and thus to cancel the effects of fossil fuel burning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dge.carnegiescience.edu/labs/caldeiralab/Caldeira%20downloads/Teller_etal_LLNL231636_1997.pdf|publisher=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|year=1997|title=Global Warming and Ice Ages: Prospects For Physics-Based Modulation Of Global Change}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Proposed strategies==
{{See also|List of proposed geoengineering schemes}}
Several climate engineering strategies have been proposed. IPCC documents detail several notable proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grida.no/publications/other/ipcc_tar/?src=/CLIMATE/IPCC_TAR/wg3/176.htm |title=IPCC Third Assessment Report – Climate Change 2001 – Complete online versions &amp;#124; UNEP/GRID-Arendal – Publications – Other |publisher=[[UNEP/GRID-Arendal]] |accessdate=2012-09-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927031948/http://www.grida.no/publications/other/ipcc_tar/?src=%2FCLIMATE%2FIPCC_TAR%2Fwg3%2F176.htm |archivedate=2012-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These fall into two main categories: [[solar radiation management]] and [[carbon dioxide removal]].

===Solar radiation management===
{{Main|Solar radiation management}}
{{See also|Stratospheric sulfate aerosols (geoengineering)|Marine Cloud Brightening}}
Solar radiation management (SRM)&lt;ref name="Royal Society Policy Document" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thehardlook.typepad.com/thehardlook/files/schnare_supplemental_testimony_a_framework_for_geoengineering.pdf Proposed Outline for Solar Radiation Management (Geoengineering) Framework&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; techniques would seek to reduce sunlight absorbed ([[ultra-violet]], near [[infra-red]] and [[visible light|visible]]).  This would be achieved by deflecting sunlight away from the Earth, or by increasing the reflectivity ([[albedo]]) of the atmosphere or the Earth's surface. These methods would not reduce [[greenhouse gas]] concentrations in the [[atmosphere]], and thus would not seek to address problems such as the [[ocean acidification]] caused by [[CO2|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]. In general, solar radiation management projects presently appear to be able to take effect rapidly and to have very low direct implementation costs relative to greenhouse gas emissions cuts and carbon dioxide removal.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Furthermore, many proposed SRM methods would be reversible in their direct climatic effects. While [[greenhouse gas remediation]] offers a more comprehensive possible solution to global warming, it does not give instantaneous results; for that, solar radiation management is required.{{dubious|date=March 2013}}

Solar radiation management methods&lt;ref name="Royal Society Policy Document" /&gt; may include:
* Surface-based: for example, protecting or expanding polar sea ice and glaciers,&lt;ref&gt;https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016EF000410&lt;/ref&gt; using [[Reflective surfaces (geoengineering)|pale-colored roofing materials]], attempting to change the oceans' brightness, or growing high-albedo crops.
* Troposphere-based: for example, [[Cloud reflectivity modification|marine cloud brightening]], which would spray fine [[sea water]] to whiten clouds and thus increase cloud reflectivity.
* Upper atmosphere-based: creating reflective [[aerosols]], such as [[stratospheric sulfate aerosols (geoengineering)|stratospheric sulfate aerosols]], specifically designed [[photophoresis|self-levitating]] aerosols,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/107/38/16428.full |title=Photophoretic levitation of engineered aerosols for geoengineering |journal=PNAS |accessdate=2012-05-16 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1009519107 |volume=107 |issue=38 |pages=16428–16431 | last1 = Keith | first1 = D. W.|bibcode=2010PNAS..10716428K |year=2010 |pmc=2944714 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or other substances. 
* Space-based: [[space sunshade]]—obstructing [[solar radiation]] with space-based mirrors, dust,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bewick | first1 = R. | last2 = Sanchez | first2 = J. P. | last3 = McInnes | first3 = C.

===Carbon dioxide removal===
{{Main|Carbon dioxide removal|Greenhouse gas remediation|Carbon sequestration}}
{{Refimprove|date=June 2013}}[[File:Phytoplankton SoAtlantic 20060215.jpg|upright|thumb|An oceanic [[phytoplankton]] bloom in the [[South Atlantic Ocean]], off the coast of [[Argentina]]. The aim of ocean [[iron fertilization]] in theory is to increase such blooms by adding some iron, which would then draw [[carbon]] from the atmosphere and fix it on the seabed.]]
[[File:2007 Arctic Sea Ice.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Significant reduction in ice volume in the Arctic Ocean in the range between 1979 and 2007]]

Carbon dioxide removal (sometimes known as negative emissions technologies or greenhouse gas removal) projects seek to remove carbon dioxide from the [[atmosphere]].  Proposed methods include those that directly remove such gases from the atmosphere, as well as indirect methods that seek to promote natural processes that draw down and sequester CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (e.g. tree planting).  Many projects overlap with [[carbon capture and storage]] projects, and may not be considered to be climate engineering by all commentators. Techniques in this category include:
* Creating [[biochar]], which can be mixed with soil to create [[terra preta]]
* [[Bio-energy with carbon capture and storage]] to sequester carbon and simultaneously provide energy
* [[Carbon air capture]] to remove [[carbon dioxide]] from ambient air
* [[Afforestation]], [[reforestation]] and [[forest restoration]] to absorb carbon dioxide
* [[Ocean fertilization]] including [[iron fertilization]] of the oceans

Many of the IPCC model projections to keep global mean temperature below 2C, are based on scenarios assuming deployment of negative emissions technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.carbonbrief.org/in-depth-experts-assess-the-feasibility-of-negative-emissions|title=In-depth: Experts assess the feasibility of ‘negative emissions’|year=2016|publisher=CarbonBrief}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tipping points and positive feedback===
[[File:65 Myr Climate Change.png|thumb|300px|right|Climate change during the last 65 million years. The Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum is labelled PETM.]]
It is argued that [[climate change]] may cross [[tipping point (climatology)|tipping points]]&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lenton | first1 = T.

The precise identity of such "tipping points" is not clear, with scientists taking differing views on whether specific systems are capable of "tipping" and the point at which this "tipping" will occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://researchpages.net/ESMG/people/tim-lenton/tipping-points/ |title=Tipping points in the Earth system |publisher=ResearchPages.net |date=2005-10-06 |accessdate=2012-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a previous tipping point is that which preceded the rapid warming leading up to the [[Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum]]. Once a tipping point is crossed, cuts in anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions will not be able to reverse the change. Conservation of resources and reduction of greenhouse emissions, used in conjunction with climate engineering, are therefore considered a viable option by some commentators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=42662|title= We're Running the Risk of Unstoppable Climate Change|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081213183527/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=42662|archivedate= 2008-12-13|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=42662 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081213183527/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=42662 |archivedate=2008-12-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/global-warming-now-unstoppable-scientists-warn-702979.html | work= The Independent | location=London | title=Global warming now 'unstoppable', scientists warn | first=Charles | last=Arthur | date=2001-01-23 | accessdate=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buying time===
Climate engineering offers the hope of temporarily reversing some aspects of global warming and allowing the natural climate to be substantially preserved whilst greenhouse gas emissions are brought under control and removed from the [[atmosphere]] by natural or artificial processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Geoengineering could buy the time needed to develop a sustainable energy economy|url = http://thebulletin.org/has-time-come-geoengineering/geoengineering-could-buy-time-needed-develop-sustainable-energy-economy|website = Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|access-date = 2016-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Costs===
Estimates of direct costs for climate engineering implementation vary widely. In general, carbon dioxide removal methods are more expensive than the solar radiation management ones. In their 2009 report ''Geoengineering the Climate'' the [[Royal Society]] judged afforestation and stratospheric aerosol injection as the methods with the "highest affordability" (lowest costs). More recently, research into costs of solar radiation management have been published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = McClellan | first1 = J. | last2 = Keith | first2 = D.

Such costs would be within the budget of most nations, and even some wealthy individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/content/thinktank/GeoEng_041209.pdf |title=Unilateral Geoengineering |publisher=CFR |accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics and responsibility===
Climate engineering would represent a large-scale, intentional effort to modify the climate. It would differ from activities such as burning fossil fuels, as they change the climate inadvertently. Intentional climate change is often viewed differently from a moral standpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bodansky | first1 = D | year = 1996 | title = May we engineer the climate? | url = | journal = [[Climatic Change]] | volume = 33 | issue = 3| pages = 309–321 | doi=10.1007/bf00142579 | bibcode=1996ClCh...33..309B}}&lt;/ref&gt; It raises questions of whether humans have the right to change the climate deliberately, and under what conditions. For example, there may be an ethical distinction between climate engineering to minimize global warming and doing so to optimize the climate. Furthermore, ethical arguments often confront larger considerations of worldview, including individual and social religious commitments.  This may imply that discussions of climate engineering should reflect on how religious commitments might influence the discourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Clingerman | first1 = F. | last2 = O'Brien | first2 = K. | year = 2014 | title = Playing God: why religion belongs in the climate engineering debate | url = | journal = [[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]] | volume = 70 | issue = 3| pages = 27–37 | doi=10.1177/0096340214531181}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For many people, religious beliefs are pivotal in defining the role of human beings in the wider world. Some religious communities might claim that humans have no responsibility in managing the climate, instead seeing such world systems as the exclusive domain of a Creator.  In contrast, other religious communities might see the human role as one of "stewardship" or benevolent management of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Clingerman, F. (2012) "Between Babel and Pelagius: Religion, Theology and Geoengineering," in Preston, C. (ed.), ''Engineering the Climate: The Ethics of Solar Radiation Management''. Lantham, MD: Lexington, pp. 201–219.&lt;/ref&gt;  The question of ethics also relates to issues of policy decision-making.  For example, the selection of a globally agreed target temperature is a significant problem in any climate engineering [[governance]] regime, as different countries or interest groups may seek different global temperatures.&lt;ref name = geoengineering_option&gt;Victor, D.

It has been argued that regardless of the economic, scientific and technical aspects, the difficulty of achieving concerted political action on global warming requires other approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/dec/12/environment-climate-change-poznan | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Let's get real on the environment | date=2008-12-12 | accessdate=2010-03-30 | first=David | last=Appell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those arguing political expediency say the difficulty of achieving meaningful emissions cuts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/24/opinion/24caldiera.html?_r=2&amp;ref=opinion&amp;oref=slogin | work=The New York Times | title=How to Cool the Globe | first=Ken | last=Caldeira | authorlink=Ken Caldeira | date=2007-10-24 | accessdate=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the effective failure of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] demonstrate the practical difficulties of achieving carbon dioxide [[emissions reduction]] by the agreement of the [[international community]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/01/climatechange.scienceofclimatechange2 | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Extreme and risky action the only way to tackle global warming, say scientists | first=David | last=Adam | date=2008-09-01 | accessdate=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, others point to support for climate engineering proposals among think tanks with a history of [[global warming skepticism]] and opposition to emissions reductions as evidence that the prospect of climate engineering is itself already politicized and being promoted as part of an argument against the need for (and viability of) emissions reductions; that, rather than climate engineering being a solution to the difficulties of emissions reductions, the prospect of climate engineering is being used as part of an argument to stall emissions reductions in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/009784.html |title=Evaluation + Tools + Best Practices: Geoengineering and the New Climate Denialism |publisher=Worldchanging |accessdate=2012-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various criticisms have been made of climate engineering,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ametsoc.org/policy/2009geoengineeringclimate_amsstatement.pdf|title=AMS Policy Statement on Geoengineering the Climate System|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|accessdate=2009-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly solar radiation management (SRM) methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/jon-taylor/geoengineering-climate-change_b_1873231.html|title=Geo-engineering – A Tool in the Fight to Tackle Climate Change, or a Dangerous Distraction? |publisher=[[Huffington Post]]|accessdate=2012-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decision making suffers from intransitivity of policy choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/2224/1|title=Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock… and Global Warming Policy Choice|author=John Hickman|date=2013-12-28 |publisher=[[The Space Review]]|accessdate=2013-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators appear fundamentally opposed.  Groups such as [[ETC Group (AGETC)|ETC Group]]&lt;ref name="ETC"&gt;{{cite web|title=ETC website|url=http://www.etcgroup.org/issues/climate-geoengineering}}&lt;/ref&gt; and individuals such as [[Raymond Pierrehumbert]] have called for a moratorium on climate engineering techniques.&lt;ref name="worldchanging1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="csmonitor1"&gt;[http://features.csmonitor.com/environment/2008/07/16/can-we-engineer-a-cooler-earth/ ''Can we engineer a cooler earth?'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ineffectiveness===
The effectiveness of the techniques proposed may fall short of predictions. In ocean [[iron fertilization]], for example, the amount of carbon dioxide removed from the [[atmosphere]] may be much lower than predicted, as carbon taken up by [[plankton]] may be released back into the atmosphere from dead plankton, rather than being carried to the bottom of the sea and sequestered.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Author | first1 =  | year = 2007| title = Seasonal rhythms of net primary production and particulate organic carbon flux to depth describe the efficiency of biological pump in the global ocean | url = | journal = [[Journal of Geophysical Research]] | volume = 112 | issue = | page = C10011 | doi = 10.1029/2006JC003706 | bibcode=2007JGRC..11210011L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Model results from a 2016 study, suggest that blooming algae could even accelerate Arctic warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climatecentral.org/news/algae-accelerate-arctic-warming-18929|title=Blooming Algae Could Accelerate Arctic Warming|year=2016|publisher=ClimateCentral}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moral hazard or risk compensation===
The existence of such techniques may reduce the political and social impetus to reduce carbon emissions.&lt;ref&gt;David Adam, "Extreme and risky action the only way to tackle global warming, say scientists",
Guardian, 1 September 2008. Available online at: https://www.theguardian.com/environment/
2008/sep/01/climatechange.scienceofclimatechange2&lt;/ref&gt;  This has generally been called a potential [[Moral Hazard|moral hazard]], although [[risk compensation]] may be a more accurate term. This concern causes many environmental groups and campaigners to be reluctant to advocate or discuss climate engineering for fear of reducing the imperative to cut [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.&lt;ref name="Moral hazard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.celsias.com/article/geo-engineering-a-moral-hazard/|title=Geo-Engineering – a Moral Hazard|date=14 November 2007|publisher=celsias.com|accessdate=9 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, several public opinion surveys and focus groups have found evidence of either assertions of a desire to increase emission cuts in the face of climate engineering, or of no effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report

==Governance==
{{See also|Solar radiation management#Governance}}Climate engineering opens up various political and economic issues. The governance issues characterizing carbon dioxide removal compared to solar radiation management tend to be distinct. Carbon dioxide removal techniques are typically slow to act, expensive, and entail risks that are relatively familiar, such as the risk of carbon dioxide leakage from underground storage formations. In contrast, solar radiation management methods are fast-acting, comparatively cheap, and involve novel and more significant risks such as regional climate disruptions. As a result of these differing characteristics, the key governance problem for carbon dioxide removal (as with emissions reductions) is making sure actors do enough of it (the so-called "[[free rider problem]]"), whereas the key governance issue for solar radiation management is making sure actors do not do too much (the "free driver" problem).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/sjoe.12120 | volume=117 | issue=4 | title=A Voting Architecture for the Governance of Free-Driver Externalities, with Application to Geoengineering | journal=The Scandinavian Journal of Economics | pages=1049–1068 | last1 = Weitzman | first1 = Martin L.| year=2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestic and international governance vary by the proposed climate engineering method. There is presently a lack of a universally agreed framework for the regulation of either climate engineering activity or research. The [[London Convention (1972)|London Convention]] addresses some aspects of the law in relation to [[List of proposed geoengineering schemes|biomass ocean storage]] and [[ocean fertilization]]. Scientists at the [[Oxford Martin School]] at [[Oxford University]] have proposed a set of voluntary principles, which may guide climate engineering research. The short version of the 'Oxford Principles'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rayner | first1 = S. | last2 = Heyward | first2 = C. | last3 = Kruger | first3 = T. | last4 = Pidgeon | first4 = N. | last5 = Redgwell | first5 = C. | last6 = Savulescu | first6 = J. | title = The Oxford Principles | doi = 10.1007/s10584-012-0675-2 | journal = Climatic Change | year = 2013 | pmid =  | pmc = | volume=121 | issue = 3 | pages=499–512}}&lt;/ref&gt; is:
*Principle 1: Geoengineering to be regulated as a [[public good]].
*Principle 2: Public participation in geoengineering decision-making
*Principle 3: Disclosure of geoengineering research and [[open access publication|open publication]] of results
*Principle 4: Independent assessment of impacts
*Principle 5: Governance before deployment
These principles have been endorsed by the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] Science and Technology [[Select Committee]] on “The Regulation of Geoengineering”,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Oxford Geoengineering Programme // History of the Oxford Principles|url = http://www.geoengineering.ox.ac.uk/oxford-principles/history/|website = www.geoengineering.ox.ac.uk|access-date = 2016-02-03|author=Oxford Geoengineering Programme}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have been referred to by authors discussing the issue of governance.&lt;ref name="economist.com"&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/15814427 We all want to change the world]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Asilomar conference]] was replicated to deal with the issue of climate engineering governance,&lt;ref name="economist.com"/&gt; and covered in a [[TV documentary]], broadcast in Canada.

==Implementation issues==
There is general consensus{{Who|date=May 2017}} that no climate engineering technique is currently sufficiently safe or effective to greatly reduce climate change risks, for the reasons listed above. However, some may be able to contribute to reducing climate risks within relatively short times.

All proposed solar radiation management techniques require implementation on a relatively large scale, in order to impact the Earth's climate. The least costly proposals are budgeted at tens of billions of US dollars annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Climate Intervention: Reflecting Sunlight to Cool Earth|url = http://www.nap.edu/catalog/18988/climate-intervention-reflecting-sunlight-to-cool-earth|doi = 10.17226/18988|first = National Research|last = Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Space sunshade]]s would cost far more. Who was to bear the substantial costs of some climate engineering techniques may be hard to agree. However, the more effective solar radiation management proposals currently appear to have low enough direct implementation costs that it would be in the interests of several single countries to implement them unilaterally.

In contrast, carbon dioxide removal, like greenhouse gas emissions reductions, have impacts proportional to their scale. These techniques would not be "implemented" in the same sense as solar radiation management ones. The problem structure of carbon dioxide removal resembles that of emissions cuts, in that both are somewhat expensive [[public good]]s, whose provision presents a [[Collective action|collective action problem]].

Before they are ready to be used, most techniques would require technical development processes that are not yet in place. As a result, many promising proposed climate engineering do not yet have the engineering development or experimental evidence to determine their feasibility or efficacy.

==Public perception==
In a 2017 focus group study conducted by the [[Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences]] (CIRES) in the United States, Japan, New Zealand and Sweden, participants were asked about carbon sequestration options, reflection proposals such as with space mirrors, or brightening of clouds, and their majority responses could be summed up as follows:
*What happens if the technologies backfire with unintended consequences?
*Are these solutions treating the symptoms of climate change rather than the cause?
*Shouldn’t we just change our lifestyle and consumption patterns to fight climate change, making climate engineering a last resort?
*Isn’t there a greater need to address political solutions to reduce our emissions?
Moderators floated then the idea of a future "climate emergency" such as rapid environmental change. The participants felt that mitigation and adaptation to climate change were strongly preferred options in such a situation, and climate engineering was seen as a last resort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cires.colorado.edu/news/study-illuminates-public-perceptions-climate-engineering|date=October 9, 2017|title=Study Illuminates Public Perceptions of Climate Engineering|work=CIRES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evaluation of climate engineering==
Most of what is known about the suggested techniques is based on laboratory experiments, observations of natural phenomena, and on [[computer modelling]] techniques. Some proposed climate engineering methods employ methods that have analogues in natural phenomena such as [[stratospheric sulfur aerosols]] and [[cloud condensation nuclei]]. As such, studies about the efficacy of these methods can draw on information already available from other research, such as that following the 1991 [[volcanic eruption|eruption]] of [[Mount Pinatubo]]. However, comparative evaluation of the relative merits of each technology is complicated, especially given modelling uncertainties and the early stage of engineering development of many proposed climate engineering methods.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imeche.org/media/Public+Affairs/geoenginq.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports into climate engineering have also been published in the [[United Kingdom]] by the [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]]&lt;ref name="imeche09"/&gt; and the [[Royal Society]].&lt;ref name="roysoc09"/&gt; The IMechE report examined a small subset of proposed methods (air capture, urban albedo and algal-based {{co2}} capture techniques), and its main conclusions were that climate engineering should be researched and trialled at the small scale alongside a wider [[decarbonisation]] of the economy.&lt;ref name="imeche09"/&gt;

The Royal Society review examined a wide range of proposed climate engineering methods and evaluated them in terms of effectiveness, affordability, timeliness and safety (assigning [[qualitative data|qualitative]] estimates in each assessment). The report divided proposed  methods into "carbon dioxide removal" (CDR) and "solar radiation management" (SRM) approaches that respectively address longwave and shortwave radiation. The key recommendations of the report were that "Parties to the [[UNFCCC]] should make increased efforts towards mitigating and adapting to climate change, and in particular to agreeing to global emissions reductions", and that "[nothing] now known about climate engineering options gives any reason to diminish these efforts".&lt;ref name="roysoc09"/&gt; Nonetheless, the report also recommended that "research and development of climate engineering options should be undertaken to investigate whether low risk methods can be made available if it becomes necessary to reduce the rate of warming this century".&lt;ref name="roysoc09"/&gt;

In a 2009 review study, Lenton and Vaughan evaluated a range of proposed climate engineering techniques from those that sequester {{co2}} from the atmosphere and decrease [[outgoing longwave radiation|longwave radiation]] trapping, to those that decrease the Earth's receipt of [[shortwave radiation]].&lt;ref name="lenton09"/&gt; In order to permit a comparison of disparate techniques, they used a common evaluation for each technique based on its effect on net radiative forcing. As such, the review examined the scientific plausibility of proposed methods rather than the practical considerations such as engineering feasibility or economic cost. Lenton and Vaughan found that "[air] capture and storage shows the greatest potential, combined with afforestation, reforestation and bio-char production", and noted that "other suggestions that have received considerable media attention, in particular "ocean pipes" appear to be ineffective".&lt;ref name="lenton09"/&gt; They concluded that "[climate] geoengineering is best considered as a potential complement to the mitigation of {{co2}} emissions, rather than as an alternative to it".&lt;ref name="lenton09"/&gt;

In October 2011, a [[Bipartisan Policy Center]] panel issued a report urging immediate researching and testing in case "the [[climate]] system reaches a 'tipping point' and swift remedial action is required".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/04/science/earth/04climate.html "Group Urges Research Into Aggressive Efforts to Fight Climate Change"], October 4, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Academy of Sciences===
The [[National Academy of Sciences]] conducted a 21-month project to study the potential impacts, benefits, and costs of two different types of  climate engineering: carbon dioxide removal and albedo modification (solar radiation management). The differences between these two classes of  climate engineering "led the committee to evaluate the two types of approaches separately in companion reports, a distinction it hopes carries over to future scientific and policy discussions."&lt;ref name="www8.nationalacademies.org"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Home {{!}} The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine {{!}} National-Academies.org {{!}} Where the Nation Turns for Independent, Expert Advice|url = http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=02102015|website = www8.nationalacademies.org|accessdate = 2015-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the two-volume study released in February 2015:&lt;blockquote&gt;Climate intervention is no substitute for reductions in carbon dioxide emissions and adaptation efforts aimed at reducing the negative consequences of climate change. However, as our planet enters a period of changing climate never before experienced in recorded human history, interest is growing in the potential for deliberate intervention in the climate system to counter climate change. ...Carbon dioxide removal strategies address a key driver of climate change, but research is needed to fully assess if any of these technologies could be appropriate for large-scale deployment. Albedo modification strategies could rapidly cool the planet’s surface but pose environmental and other risks that are not well understood and therefore should not be deployed at climate-altering scales; more research is needed to determine if albedo modification approaches could be viable in the future.&lt;ref name="nas-sites.org"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Climate Intervention Reports » Climate Change at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine|url = https://nas-sites.org/americasclimatechoices/other-reports-on-climate-change/2015-2/climate-intervention-reports/|website = nas-sites.org|accessdate = 2015-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The project was sponsored by the [[National Academy of Sciences]], U.S. Intelligence Community, [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]], [[NASA]], and [[United States Department of Energy|U.S. Department of Energy]].&lt;ref name="www8.nationalacademies.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www8.nationalacademies.org/cp/projectview.aspx?key=49540|title=  Geoengineering Climate: Technical Evaluation and Discussion of Impacts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change===

The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) assessed the scientific literature on climate engineering (referred to as "geoengineering" in its reports), in which it considered carbon dioxide removal and solar radiation separately. Its [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report|Fifth Assessment Report]] states:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|IPCC AR5 WG1|pp = 575, 632}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Models consistently suggest that SRM would generally reduce climate differences compared to a world with elevated GHG concentrations and no SRM; however, there would also be residual regional differences in climate (e.g., temperature and rainfall) when compared to a climate without elevated GHGs....&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Models suggest that if SRM methods were realizable they would be effective in countering increasing temperatures, and would be less, but still, effective in countering some other climate changes. SRM would not counter all effects of climate change, and all proposed geoengineering methods also carry risks and side effects. Additional consequences cannot yet be anticipated as the level of scientific understanding about both SRM and CDR is low. There are also many (political, ethical, and practical) issues involving geoengineering that are beyond the scope of this report.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Communication University of China''' ('''CUC''') ({{zh|s=中国传媒大学|p=Zhōngguó Chuánméi Dàxué}}) is a public university in [[Beijing]]. Formerly known as the '''Beijing Broadcasting Institute''' ('''BBI''') ({{zh|s=北京广播学院|p=Běijīng Guǎngbō Xuéyuàn}}), it is one of the [[Project 211]] key universities directly administered by the [[Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China]]. The predecessor of the school was a training center for technicians of the Central Broadcasting Bureau that was founded in 1954. In April 1959, the school was upgraded to the Beijing Broadcasting Institute approved by the State Council. In August 2004, the BBI was renamed into the Communication University of China.
==Rank==
Communication University of China is one of the top public universities in China. It is a Chinese Ministry of Education [[Double First Class University Plan|Double First Class Discipline University]], with Double First Class status in certain discuplines.&lt;ref name="Chinese Department of Education"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.moe.gov.cn/srcsite/A22/moe_843/201709/t20170921_314942.html |title=教育部 财政部 国家发展改革委 关于公布世界一流大学和一流学科建设高校及建设 学科名单的通知 (Notice from the Ministry of Education and other national governmental departments announcing the list of double first class universities and disciplines)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is ranked No.1 of media education and ranked No.1 among language universities in China. According to 2012 China Discipline Ranking approved by the Chinese Ministry of Education, Communication University of China is ranked 1st in "Journalism and Communication" and "Drama Film and Television", 6th in Art Theory, 9th in Design, 17th in Fine Arts, 23rd in Politics and 32nd in Chinese Language and Literature in China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinadegrees.cn/xwyyjsjyxx/xxsbdxz/2012en/index.shtml 2012 China Discipline Ranking 0503  Journalism and Communication]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinadegrees.cn/xwyyjsjyxx/xxsbdxz/2012en/index.shtml 2012 China Discipline Ranking 1303 Drama Film and Television]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Communication University of China.jpg|thumb|left|The Soviet Style Teaching Building of the Newly Established School of Foreign Languages]]
CUC's history dates back to March 3, 1954 when the first training class for broadcasting professionals was held by the then Central Radio Administration. This then led to the founding of Beijing Broadcasting College in 1958. On September 7, 1959, CUC's precursor Beijing Broadcasting Institute (BBI) was established. During the ensuing four decades, BBI remained a relatively small college and only known among the circles of Chinese media professionals.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

On August 19, 2004, the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China]] approved the renaming of the institute to the '''Communication University of China'''. It has now developed into a comprehensive institute of higher learning with broadcasting, film production, journalism, drama, animation, advertising, newscasting, creative cultural industry, Communications engineering, foreign languages (especially minority language),  management and media law education as its major academic disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Campus==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
CUC's 116.88 hectare main campus is located in Dingfuzhuang, eastern part of [[Chaoyang District, Beijing|Chaoyang District]], [[Beijing]]. It is just outside the Eastern [[5th Ring Road]], and is just along the Beijing-Tong County expressway. With increasing number of students and fast development, the university has expanded its campus to nearby areas to provide more space for student and staff accommodation and research institutions. The main campus is composed of teaching and administrative buildings, theatres for cultural activities, large compounds of student dormitories and staff apartments, media production studios and scientific research centers. The campus is linked by the [[Communication University of China Station]] of Beijing subway [[Batong Line, Beijing Subway|Batong Line]].

===Student societies===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
CUC has over 50 Student Societies, including Amigos Latin Dance Society, Association of Green Hope, Association of Luxun Studies, Budai Drama Society, Drama Society Experimental Drama Society, Guitar Club, Minority Languages Society, TYP Animation Society and so on.


===Foreign languages teaching===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
CUC offers 30 foreign languages since its establishment, which includes English (since 1958), Spanish (since 1959), French, Russian, German, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese (since 1960), Italian (since 1960), Hindi (since 1965), Bengali (since 1964), Nepali (since 1964), Assamese (since 1965), Urdu (since 1962), Tamil (since 1959), Sinhalese (since 1965), Pashto (since 1964), Persian (since 1988), Zulu (since 1965), Swahili (since 1960), Esperanto (since 1959), Turkish (since 1959), Swedish, Hausa (since 1965), Malay, Hebrew, Greek (since 1964)，Hungarian, Dutch (since 1965)，Laos (since 1965). It is still the only university in China offers degree courses of Bengali, Tamil, Pashto and Esperanto.And its affiliation "CUC Nanguang Institution (Known as "CUC Nanking")" offers other languages like Arabic, Czech, Thai and so on.According to "2012 Wushulian's Chinese University Ranking", CUC ranks 1st among the "Language Universities" of China.

===Chinese language teaching for foreigners===

The Chinese language school for foreigners is inexpensive but gets relatively poor reviews from students due to relatively disorganization and inexperienced faculty, according to a Global Times report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://beijing.globaltimes.cn/life/edu-tech/2011-06/661375.html |title=How do Beijing's best universities compare for students? |date=June 2, 2011 |accessdate=8 November 2011 |publisher=Global Times |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902135514/http://beijing.globaltimes.cn/life/edu-tech/2011-06/661375.html |archivedate=2 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://beijing.globaltimes.cn/life/edu-tech/2011-06/661373.html |title=Breaking down the best universities for studying Chinese |date=June 2, 2011 |accessdate=8 November 2011 |publisher=Global Times |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902142230/http://beijing.globaltimes.cn/life/edu-tech/2011-06/661373.html |archivedate=2 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cooperation with  National Office for Teaching Chinese as a Foreign Language or [[Hanban]], CUC also operates several [[Confucius Institute]]s with its overseas partner universities, providing Chinese language and cultural education for learners outside of China.{{cn

A '''''Compton telescope''''' (also known as Compton camera or Compton imager) is a [[gamma-ray]] detector which utilizes [[Compton scattering]] to determine the origin of the observed gamma rays.

Compton cameras are usually applied to detect gamma rays in the energy range where Compton scattering is the dominating interaction process, from a few hundred keV to several MeV. They are applied in fields such as [[astrophysics]], [[nuclear medicine]], and nuclear threat detection.

In astrophysics, the most famous Compton telescopes was [[CGRO#COMPTEL|COMPTEL]] aboard the [[CGRO|Compton Gamma-ray Observatory]], which pioneered the observation of the gamma-ray sky in the energy range between 0.75 and 30 MeV. A potential successor is [[Nuclear Compton Telescope|NCT]] - the Nuclear Compton Telescope.

The '''cortical reaction''' is a process initiated during [[fertilisation|fertilization]] by the release of [[cortical granule]]s from the egg, which prevents [[polyspermy]], the fusion of multiple sperm with one egg. In contrast to the [[Polyspermy#Fast block of polyspermy|fast block of polyspermy]] which immediately but temporarily blocks additional sperm from fertilizing the egg, the cortical reaction gradually establishes a permanent barrier to sperm entry and functions as the main part of the [[Polyspermy#Slow block of polyspermy|slow block of polyspermy]] in many animals.

To create this barrier [[cortical granule]]s, specialized [[Vesicle (biology)#Secretory vesicles|secretory vesicles]] located within the egg's [[cell cortex|cortex]] (the region directly below the plasma membrane), are fused with the egg's plasma membrane, causing the contents of the cortical granules to be released outside the cell where they modify an existing extracellular matrix to make it impenetrable to sperm entry. The cortical granules contain [[proteases]] that clip perivitelline tether proteins, [[peroxidases]] that harden the vitelline envelope, and [[glycosaminoglycans]] that attract water into the perivitelline space, causing it to expand and form the [[hyaline layer]]. The trigger for the cortical granules to [[Exocytosis|exocytose]] is the release of calcium ions from cortical [[smooth endoplasmic reticulum]] in response to sperm binding to the egg.

In most animals, the extracellular matrix present around the egg is the [[Vitelline membrane|vitelline envelope]] which becomes the fertilization membrane following the cortical reaction. In mammals, however, the extracellular matrix modified by the cortical reaction is the [[zona pellucida]]. This modification of the zona pellucida is known as the zona reaction. Although highly conserved across the animal kingdom, the cortical reaction shows great diversity between species. While much has been learned about the identity and function of the contents of the cortical granules in the highly accessible sea urchin, little is known about the contents of cortical granules in mammals.

The cortical reaction within the egg is analogous to the [[acrosomal reaction]] within the sperm, where the acrosome, a specialized secretory vesicle that is homologous to cortical granules, is fused with the plasma membrane of the sperm cell to release its contents which degrade the egg's tough coating and allow the sperm to bind to and fuse with the egg.

==Echinoderms==
In the well-studied [[sea urchin]] model system, the granule contents modify a protein coat on the outside of the plasma membrane (the vitelline layer) so that it is released from the membrane. The released cortical granule proteins exert a [[colloid]] [[osmotic pressure]] causing water to enter the space between the plasma membrane and the vitelline layer, and the vitelline layer expands away from the egg surface. This is easily visible through a microscope and is known as "elevation of the fertilization envelope". Some of the former granule contents adhere to the fertilization envelope, and it is extensively modified and cross-linked. As the fertilization envelope elevates, non-fertilizing sperm are lifted away from the egg plasma membrane, and as they are not able to pass through the fertilization envelope, they are prevented from entering the egg. Therefore, the cortical reaction prevents [[polyspermy|polyspermic]] fertilization, a lethal event. Another cortical granule component, polysaccharide-rich hyalin, remains adherent to the outer surface of the plasma membrane, and becomes part of the hyaline layer.

==Mammals==
Although various mammals have been studied, mice represent the best studied animal models for understanding the cortical reaction in mammals. In mammals the cortical reaction leads to a modification of the [[zona pellucida]] that blocks polyspermy; enzymes released by cortical granules digest sperm receptor glycoproteins ZP2 and ZP3 so that they can no longer bind spermatozoon.

Critical geography is one variant of&amp;nbsp;[[Critical theory|critical social science and humanities]]&amp;nbsp;that adopt&amp;nbsp;[[Karl Marx|Marx]]’s thesis to interpret and change the world. Fay (1987) defines contemporary critical science as the effort to understand the&amp;nbsp;[[oppression]]&amp;nbsp;in a society and use this understanding to promote societal change and liberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Critical_social_science.html?id=5K98AAAAIAAJ|title=Critical social science: liberation and its limits|last=Fay|first=Brian|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1987|isbn=9780801494581|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agger (1998) identifies a number of features of critical social theory practiced in fields like geography, which include: a rejection of&amp;nbsp;[[positivism]]; an endorsement of the possibility of progress; a claim for the structural dynamics of&amp;nbsp;[[Social dominance theory|domination]]; an argument that dominance derived from forms of false consciousness, ideology, and myth; a faith in the agency of everyday change and self-transformation and an attendant rejection of&amp;nbsp;[[determinism]]; and a rejection of revolutionary expediency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Critical_Social_Theories.html?id=eB-B6XercZoC|title=Critical Social Theories: An Introduction|last=Agger|first=Ben|publisher=Avalon Publishing|year=1988|isbn=9780813321745|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
Critical geography in the Anglo-American world rooted in the&amp;nbsp;'''radical geography'''&amp;nbsp;that emerged in the early 1970s. Peet (2000) provides an overview of the evolution of radical and critical geography.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peet|first=Richard|year=2000|title=Celebrating Thirty Years of Radical Geography|journal=Environment and Planning A|language=en|volume=32|issue=6|pages=951–953|doi=10.1068/a32202}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1970s, radical geographers tried to transform the scope of the discipline of geography by responding to the great issues of the time - civil rights, environmental pollution, and war. From the mid- to late-1970s saw ascending critiques of the&amp;nbsp;[[quantitative revolution]]&amp;nbsp;and the adoption of&amp;nbsp;[[Marxism|Marxist]]&amp;nbsp;approach. The 1980s is marked by fissures between humanistic, feminist and Marxist streams, and a reversal of structural excess. In the late 1980s, critical geography emerged and gradually became a self-identified field.

Although closely related, critical geography and radical geography are not interchangeable. Critical geography has two crucial departures from radical geography: (1) a rejection of the structural excess of&amp;nbsp;[[Marxism]], in accordance with the&amp;nbsp;[[Postmodernism|post-modern turn]]; and (2) an increasing interest in culture and&amp;nbsp;[[Social representation|representation]], in contrast to radical geography’s focus on the economy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Peet (2000) notices a rapprochement between critical and radical geography after heated debate in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Nevertheless, Castree (2000) posits that critical and radical geography entail different commitments.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He contends that the eclipse of radical geography indicates the professionalization and academicization of Left geography, and therefore worries about the loss of the "radical" tradition.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Common themes ==
As a consequence of the&amp;nbsp;[[Postmodernism|post-modern turn]], critical geography doesn’t have a unified commitment. Hubbard, Kitchin, Bartley, and Fuller (2002) asserts that critical geography has a diverse&amp;nbsp;[[epistemology]],&amp;nbsp;[[ontology]], and&amp;nbsp;[[methodology]], and does not have a distinctive theoretical identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=71SvAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=thinking+geographically#v=onepage&amp;q=thinking%20geographically&amp;f=false|title=Thinking Geographically: Space, Theory and Contemporary Human Geography|last=Hubbard|first=Phil|last2=Bartley|first2=Brendan|last3=Fuller|first3=Duncan|last4=Kitchin|first4=Rob|publisher=A&amp;C Black|year=2002|isbn=9780567259882|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Blomley (2006) identifies six common themes of critical geography,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blomley|first=Nicholas|year=2006|title=Uncritical critical geography?|journal=Progress in Human Geography|language=en|volume=30|issue=1|pages=87–94|doi=10.1191/0309132506ph593pr}}&lt;/ref&gt; encompassing:
# '''A commitment to theory and a rejection of&amp;nbsp;[[empiricism]].'''&amp;nbsp;Critical geographers consciously deploy theories of some form, but they draw from a variety of theoretical wells, such as&amp;nbsp;[[political economy]],&amp;nbsp;[[governmentality]],&amp;nbsp;[[feminism]],&amp;nbsp;[[anti-racism]], and&amp;nbsp;[[anti-imperialism]].
# '''A commitment to reveal the processes that produce&amp;nbsp;[[Social inequality|inequalities]]'''. Critical geographers seek to unveil&amp;nbsp;[[Power (social and political)|power]], uncover&amp;nbsp;[[Social inequality|inequality]], expose resistance, and cultivate liberating politics and&amp;nbsp;[[social change]]s.
# '''An emphasis on&amp;nbsp;[[Social representation|representation]]&amp;nbsp;as a means of domination and resistance'''. A common focus of critical geography is to study how representations of space sustain power; or on the contrary, how representations of space can be used to challenge power.
# '''An optimistic faith in the power of critical scholarship'''. Critical geographers believe that scholarship can be used to resist the dominant representations, and scholar can undo power domination and free the oppressed. There exists an implicit confidence in the power of critical scholarship to reach the ignorant, and in the capacities of people to defeat alienation by means of reflexive self-education.
# '''A commitment to progressive practices'''. Critical geographers want to make a difference. They claim to be united with&amp;nbsp;[[social movement]]s&amp;nbsp;and activists with commitments to&amp;nbsp;[[social justice]]. The relationship between critical geography and&amp;nbsp;[[activism]]&amp;nbsp;has been much debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Radical_Theory_critical_Praxis.html?id=zGabDAEACAAJ|title=Radical Theory/critical Praxis: Making a Difference Beyond the Academy?|last=Fuller|first=Duncan|last2=Kitchin|first2=Rob|publisher=Praxis (e)Press|year=2004|isbn=9780973456103|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''An understanding of&amp;nbsp;[[space]]&amp;nbsp;as a critical tool.'''&amp;nbsp;Critical geographers pay special attention to how spatial arrangements and representations can be used to produce&amp;nbsp;[[oppression]]&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;[[Social inequality|inequality]]. Critical geographers identify to varying degrees how space can be used as both a veil and tool of power.

== Critiques ==
A few important questions remain unsolved in critical geography.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The first one is that there has been relatively limited discussion over the shared commitments of critical geographers, with a few exceptions such as Harvey (2000).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Spaces_of_Hope.html?id=W00VHZg3u2MC|title=Spaces of Hope|last=Harvey|first=David|publisher=University of California Press|year=2000|isbn=9780520225787|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The question such as "what are geographers critical of", and "to what end" needs to be answered.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Barnes (2002) comments that critical geographers are better at providing explanatory diagnoses than offering anticipatory-utopian imaginations to reconfigure the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barnes|first=Trevor J.|year=2002|title=Critical notes on economic geography from an aging radical. Or radical notes on economic geography from a critical age|url=https://ojs.unbc.ca/index.php/acme/article/view/687|journal=ACME: An International Journal for Critical Geographies|language=en|volume=1|issue=1|pages=8–14|issn=1492-9732|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second question concerns the institutionalization of critical geography. Even though critical geographers conceive themselves as rebels and outsiders, critical thinking has become prevalent in geography.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/arts/maps-and-chaps-7142744|title=Maps and Chaps|last=Byles|first=Jeff|date=2001-07-31|work=Village Voice|access-date=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critical geography is now situated at the very heart of the discipline of geography.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some see institutionalization as a natural result of the analytical strength and insights of critical geography, while others fear that institutionalization has entailed cooperation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The question is whether critical geography still holds its commitment to political change.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Lastly, as critical geography is practiced across the world, the insights of critical geographers outside the Anglophone world should be better acknowledged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bialasiewicz|first=Luiza|year=2003|title=The Many Wor(l)ds of Difference and Dissent|journal=Antipode|language=en|volume=35|issue=1|pages=14–23|doi=10.1111/1467-8330.00299|issn=1467-8330}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard, Mizuoka et al. (2005) offered an overview of Japanese critical geography praxis since the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mizuoka|first=Fujio|last2=Mizuuchi|first2=Toshio|last3=Hisatake|first3=Tetsuya|last4=Tsutsumi|first4=Kenji|last5=Fujita|first5=Tetsushi|year=2005|title=The Critical Heritage of Japanese Geography: Its Tortured Trajectory for Eight Decades|journal=Environment and Planning D: Society and Space|language=en|volume=23|issue=3|pages=453–473|doi=10.1068/d2204r}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, critical geography should also forge stronger linkage with critical scholars in other disciplines.

Information security professional Paul Carugati states that training, awareness and education is "the only path forward to holistically protect ourselves against these very dynamic threats".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cyber Self-Defense {{!}} Paul Carugati {{!}} TEDxSpokane|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knLDY7hRm5I|accessdate=13 April 2017|date=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also advises employers to "continue to advance their employees in cyber self defense and look for cyber security skill level".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zurkus|first1=Kacy|title=Social engineering scam doesn't fool this writer|url=http://www.csoonline.com/article/3034218/security/social.html|website=CSO Online|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Hacking back"==
&lt;!--https://www.nap.edu/read/12997--&gt;

Legal theorists and policy makers are increasingly considering authorizing the private sector to take active measures on their own through "hacking-back" (also known as hackbacks).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Law and Private Actor Active Cyber Defensive Measures|url=https://www.lawfareblog.com/international-law-and-private-actor-active-cyber-defensive-measures|website=Lawfare|accessdate=13 April 2017|date=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Brown |first1=Megan L. |title=Authorizing Private Hackback Would Be a Wild West for Cybersecurity |url=https://www.law.com/legaltechnews/2018/09/06/authorizing-private-hackback-would-be-a-wild-west-for-cybersecurity/ |accessdate=7 September 2018 |publisher=Law.com |date=September 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The question: 'when does a cyber-attack (or threat therof) give rise to a right of self-defense?' is the subject of studies and discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Waxman|first1=Matthew C.|title=Self-Defensive Force Against Cyber Attacks: Legal, Strategic and Political Dimensions|date=19 March 2013|ssrn=2235838|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017 [[Tom Graves]] proposed the Active Cyber Defense Certainty Act (ACDC) that would enhance the [[Computer Fraud and Abuse Act]] (CFAA) to allow individuals and the private sector to use limited defensive measures, including tools that are currently restricted under the CFAA, for identification and stopping attackers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hawkins|first1=Garrett|title=Rep.

Brad Maryman warns of [[unintended consequences]], stating that in his view "the notion that we should legislate and accept a level of undocumented and unmonitored cyber actions by anyone who thinks they have been hacked is unfathomable".&lt;ref name=usn1/&gt;

In [[social science]], '''disenchantment''' ({{lang-de|Entzauberung}}) is the cultural [[rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]] and devaluation of [[religion]] apparent in modern society. The term was borrowed from [[Friedrich Schiller]]&lt;ref&gt;Richard Jenkins, [http://maxweberstudies.org/kcfinder/upload/files/MWSJournal/1.1pdfs/1.1%2011-32.pdf Disenchantment, Enchantment and Re-Enchantment] (2000) 1 ''Max Weber Studies'' 11.&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Max Weber]] to describe the character of [[modernized]], [[bureaucratic]], [[secularized]] [[Western World|Western society]], where scientific understanding is more highly valued than belief, and where processes are oriented toward rational goals, as opposed to [[traditional society]], where for Weber, "the world remains a great enchanted garden".&lt;ref&gt;Max Weber, ''The Sociology of Religion'' (1971) p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enlightenment ambivalence==

Weber's ambivalent appraisal of the process of disenchantment as both positive ''and'' negative&lt;ref&gt;A. J. Cascardi, ''The Subject of Modernity'' (1992) p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; was taken up by the [[Frankfurt school]] in their examination of the self-destructive elements in [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] rationalism.&lt;ref&gt;G. Borradori, ''Philosophy in an Age of Terror'' (2004) p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jürgen Habermas|Habermas]] has subsequently striven to find a positive foundation for [[modernity]] in the face of disenchantment, even while appreciating Weber's recognition of how far secular society was created from, and is still "haunted by the ghosts of dead religious beliefs".&lt;ref&gt;Murray E. G. Smith, ''Early Modern Social Theory'' (1998) p. 274&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have seen the disenchantment of the world as a call for [[Existentialism|existentialist]] commitment and individual responsibility before a collective normative void.&lt;ref&gt;L. Embree ed., ''Schutzian Social Science'' (1999) p. 110-1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sacralization==

Disenchantment is related to the notion of desacralization, whereby the structures and institutions that previously channeled spiritual belief into rituals that promoted collective identities came under attack and waned in popularity. According to [[Henri Hubert]] and [[Marcel Mauss]], the ritual of sacrifice involved two processes: sacralization and desacralization. The first process endows a profane offering with sacred properties—consecration—which provides a bridge of communication between the worlds of the sacred and profane. Once the sacrifice has been made, the ritual must be desacralized in order to return the worlds of the sacred and profane to their proper places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Catherine|title=Ritual: Perspectives and Dimensions|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}} p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

Disenchantment operates on a macro-level, rather than the micro-level described above. It also destroys part of the process whereby the chaotic social elements that require sacralization in the first place continue with mere knowledge as their antidote. Thereby disenchantment can be related to Durkheim's concept of [[anomie]]: an un-mooring of the individual from the ties that bind in society.&lt;ref&gt;Bell&lt;/ref&gt;{{RefImprove|section|date=December 2016}}

==Reenchantment==

In recent years, Weber's paradigm has been challenged by thinkers who see a process of "reenchantment" operating alongside that of disenchantment.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joshua Landy]] and Michael Saler, eds., ''The Re-Enchantment of the World: Secular Magic in a Rational Age'', Stanford University Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, enchantment is used to fundamentally change how even low paid service work is experienced.&lt;ref&gt;Endrissat, N., Islam, G., &amp; Noppeney, C. (2015). Enchanting Work: New Spirits of Service Work in an Organic Supermarket. Organization Studies, 36(11), 1555–1576. http://doi.org/10.1177/0170840615593588.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jung]] considered [[Symbol#Psychoanalysis and archetypes|symbols]] to provide a means for the [[numinous]] to return from the unconscious to the desacralized world&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''Man and his Symbols'' (1978) p. 83-94&lt;/ref&gt; - a means for the recovery of [[myth]], and the sense of wholeness it once provided, by a disenchanted modernity.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Casement, ''Who Owns Jung?'' (2007) p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ernest Gellner]] argued that though disenchantment was the inevitable product of modernity, many people just could not stand a disenchanted world, and therefore opted for various "re-enchantment creeds" (as he called them) such as [[psychoanalysis]], [[Marxism]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgensteinianism]]{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}, [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and [[ethnomethodology]]. A noticeable feature of these re-enchantment creeds is that they all tried to make themselves compatible with naturalism: i.e., they did not refer to supernatural forces.&lt;ref&gt;[[John A. Hall]], ''Ernest Gellner: An Intellectual Biography'', Verso, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leo Ruickbie]] showed on the basis of research in the [[Neopagan]] community that modern magical practitioners demonstrated re-enchantment. Using both qualitative participant research and quantitative survey analysis he was able to demonstrate a range of re-enchanted characteristics conforming to those extrapolated from Weber's theories.&lt;ref&gt;Leo Ruickbie, 'The Re-Enchanters: Theorising Re-Enchantment and Testing for its Presence in Modern Witchcraft', unpublished PhD thesis, King's College, London, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leo Ruickbie, 'Weber and the Witches: Sociological Theory and Modern Witchcraft', Journal of Alternative Spiritualities and New Age Studies, 2006, 116-130.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disenchantment as Myth===

American [[historian of religion]] Jason Josesphson-Storm has challenged mainstream sociological and historical interpretations of the ideas of both disenchantment and reenchantment, labeling disenchantment as a "myth." Josephson-Storm argues that there has not been a decline in belief in magic or mysticism in Western Europe or the United States, even after adjusting for religious belief, education, and class.&lt;ref&gt;Josephson-Storm, ''Myth of Disenchantment'' (2017), Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Josephson-Storm has further argued that many influential theorists of disenchantment, including Weber and some members of the [[Frankfurt School]], were not only aware of modern European magical and occult movements but consciously engaged with them.&lt;ref&gt;Josephson-Storm, ''Myth of Disenchantment'' (2017), 215, 269-70.&lt;/ref&gt; Foundational theorists of disenchantment such as Weber and [[James George Frazer]] did not envision a rigid binary between rationality or rationalization and magical thinking and did not describe a process of "reenchantment" to reverse or compensate for disenchantment.&lt;ref&gt;Josephson-Storm, ''Myth of Disenchantment'' (2017), 277-8, 298.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Josephson-Storm, this information necessitates a re-interpretation of Weber's idea of disenchantment as referring more to the sequestering and professionalization of magic.&lt;ref&gt;Josephson-Storm, ''Myth of Disenchantment'' (2017), 299-300.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dynamic Earth''' (originally known as Our Dynamic Earth) is a visitor attraction in [[Edinburgh]], and also functions as a conference venue. It is in the [[Holyrood, Edinburgh|Holyrood]] area, beside the [[Scottish Parliament building]] and at the foot of [[Holyrood Park#Salisbury Crags|Salisbury Crags]].

The principal focus of Dynamic Earth is to facilitate a better public understanding of the processes that have shaped the Earth (known as [[earth science]]). This includes the [[Big Bang]], [[abiogenesis]], [[plate tectonics]] and [[glaciers|glaciation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dynamicearth.co.uk/visit/what-is-dynamic-earth |title=What is Dynamic Earth |publisher=Our Dynamic Earth |accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The centre opened in 1999 as one of the first major projects supported by the [[Millennium Commission]]. The project was part of an [[urban regeneration]] plan for former industrial land at the lower end of Holyrood Road.

In the years 2006−2007 there were more than 200,000 visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/our-dynamic-earth-celebrates-as-holyrood-doubles-its-funds-1-1240449 |title=Our Dynamic Earth celebrates as Holyrood doubles its funds |work=[[The Scotsman]] |date=11 January 2008  |accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The building's structure consists of a steel mast-supported membrane stretched over a steel skeleton. It was designed by architects [[Hopkins Architects|Michael Hopkins and Partners]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hopkins.co.uk/projects/1/75 |title=Dynamic Earth |publisher=Hopkins Architects |accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design incorporates the original wall that formed the outer perimeter of the Abbey Brewery ale stores that were formerly on the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeout.com/edinburgh/blog/old-town-new-life-four-transformed-buildings-in-edinburgh |title=Old Town, new life: four transformed buildings in Edinburgh |first=Gareth |last=Davies |work=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]] |date=26 May 2015 |accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The centre's Scientific Director is the British television and radio presenter specialising in [[scientific]] and [[educational]] programmes [[Hermione Cockburn]]

'''Exhibitionism''' is the act of exposing in a public or semi-public context those parts of one's body that are not normally exposed &amp;ndash; for example, the [[breast]]s, [[Sex organ|genitals]] or [[buttocks]]. The practice may arise from a desire or compulsion to expose themselves in such a manner to groups of friends or acquaintances, or to strangers for their amusement or sexual satisfaction or to shock the bystander.&lt;ref name="baunach"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baunach|first1=Dawn Michelle|title=Sex and Society|date=2010|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7614-7906-2|page=220|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aVDZchwkIMEC&amp;lpg=PA220|accessdate=22 May 2017|chapter=Exhibitionism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exposing oneself only to an [[intimate partner]] is normally not regarded as exhibitionism. In law, the act of exhibitionism may be called [[indecent exposure]], "exposing one's person", or other expressions.

==History==

Public exhibitionism by women has been recorded since classical times, often in the context of women shaming groups of men into committing, or inciting them to commit, some public action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rutgerspress.rutgers.edu/Author/Blackledge/excerpt.html |title=Origin of the world |publisher=Rutgerspress.rutgers.edu |date=1977-09-23 |accessdate=2012-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120094326/http://rutgerspress.rutgers.edu/Author/Blackledge/excerpt.html |archivedate=2012-11-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Greek historian [[Herodotus]] gives an account of exhibitionistic behaviors from the fifth century BC in ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]''. Herodotus writes that: &lt;blockquote&gt;When people travel to [[Bubastis]] for the festival, this is what they do. Every ''baris'' carrying them there overflows with people, a huge crowd of them, men and women together. Some of the women have clappers, while some of the men have pipes which they play throughout the voyage. The rest of the men and women sing and clap their hands. When in the course of their journey they reach a community — not the city of their destination, but somewhere else — they steer the ''bareis'' close to the bank. Some of the women carry on doing what I have already described them as doing, but others shout out scornful remarks to the women in the town, or dance, or stand and pull up their clothes to expose themselves. Every riverside community receives this treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus. ''The Histories''. Trans. R. Waterfield. Oxford: Oxford UP, 1998. Book Two, Chapter 60, Page 119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A case of what appears to be exhibitionism in a clinical sense was recorded in a report by the Commission against Blasphemy in Venice in 1550.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bloch|first=Iwan|title=Fall von Exhibitionismus im 16. Jahrhundert|journal=Zeitschrift für Sexualwissenschaft|year=1914|issue=Born|page=i.289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK the 4th draft of the revised Vagrancy Act of 1824 included an additional clause 'or openly and indecently exposing their persons' which gave rise to difficulties because of its ill-defined scope. During the course of a subsequent debate on the topic in Parliament, the then Home Secretary, Mr Peel, observed that 'there was not a more flagrant offence than that of indecently exposing the person which had been carried to an immense extent in the parks...wanton exposure was a very different thing from accidental exposure'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rooth|first=F.G.|title=Some Historical Notes on Indecent Exposure and Exhibitionism|journal=The Medico-Legal Journal|year=1970|volume=38|issue=4|series=Part 4|pages=135–139|pmid=4923872}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The development of new technologies such as smartphones and tablets has permitted some exhibitionists to reorient their methods such as with nude selfies.&lt;ref&gt;Hart, Matt. "Being naked on the internet: young people’s selfies as intimate edgework." Journal of Youth Studies (2016): 1-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological aspects==
[[File:Charles Lasegue.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Charles Lasègue]] was the first to describe exhibitionism as a disorder in 1877.]]
Exhibitionism was first described as a disorder in 1877 by French physician and psychiatrist [[Charles Lasègue]].&lt;ref&gt;Lasègue C. Les Exhibitionistes. L'Union Médicale (Paris), series 3, vol. 23; 1877. Pages 709–714.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn | Aggrawal | 2009 | p=388 }} When exhibitionistic sexual interest is acted on with a non-consenting person or interferes with a person's quality of life or [[normality (behavior)|normal]] functioning, it can be diagnosed as ''exhibitionistic disorder'' in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'', fifth edition ([[DSM-5]]). The DSM states that the highest possible prevalence for exhibitionistic disorder in men is 2% to 4%. It is thought to be much less common in women.&lt;ref name="DSM-5"&gt;{{cite book | title = Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition | chapter = Exhibitionistic Disorder, 302.4 (F65.2) | editor = American Psychiatric Association | year = 2013 | publisher = American Psychiatric Publishing | pages = 689–691}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a Swedish survey, 2.1% of women and 4.1% of men admitted to becoming sexually aroused from the exposure of their genitals to a stranger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Nolen-Hoeksema, Susan | year = 2014 | title = Abnormal Psychology | edition = 6th | location = New York City, NY | publisher = McGraw-Hill Education | page = 384}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A research team asked a sample of 185 exhibitionists, "How would you have preferred a person to react if you were to expose your privates to him or her?" The most common response was "Would want to have sexual intercourse" (35.1%), followed by "No reaction necessary at all" (19.5%), "To show their privates also" (15.1%), "Admiration" (14.1%), and "Any reaction" (11.9%). Only very few exhibitionists chose "Anger and disgust" (3.8%) or "Fear" (0.5%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Freund, K. |author2=Watson, R. |author3= Rienzo, D. |last-author-amp=yes | year = 1988 | title = The value of self-reports in the study of voyeurism and exhibitionism | journal = Annals of Sex Research | volume = 2 | pages = 243–262 | url = http://sax.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/1/2/243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of exposure==
[[File:Mardi Gras Flashing - Color.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A woman publicly exposing her bare breasts at [[Mardi Gras]], USA, 2008]]
Various types of behavior are classified as exhibitionism,&lt;ref name="baunach"/&gt; including:
*'''[[Anasyrma]]''': the lifting of the [[skirt]] when not wearing [[underwear]], to expose genitals.
*'''[[Candaulism]]''': when a person exposes his or her partner in a sexually provocative manner.
*'''Flashing''': the momentary display of bare female [[breasts]] by a woman with an up-and-down lifting of the shirt or [[bra]] or the exposure of a man's or woman's [[genitalia]].

[[File:Mooning.jpg|thumb|250px|Students mooning at [[Stanford University]], intended as both an unspecified protest and also a [[world record]] attempt of most number of people simultaneously mooning others.]]

*'''Martymachlia''': a [[paraphilia]] which involves [[sexual attraction]] to having others watch the execution of a sexual act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologistanywhereanytime.com/sexual_problems_pyschologist/psychologist_exhibitionism.htm |title=Psychologist Anywhere Anytime |publisher=Psychologist Anywhere Anytime |date= |accessdate=2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Mooning]]''': the display of bare [[buttocks]] by pulling down of [[trousers]] and underwear. The act is most often done for the sake of humour, disparagement, or mockery.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10255">'''The Four Minute Men''' were a group of volunteers authorized by United States President [[Woodrow Wilson]], to give four-minute speeches on topics given to them by The [[Committee on Public Information]] (CPI). In 1917-1918, around 7,555,190 speeches were given in 5,200 communities&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Liberal-Fascism-American-Mussolini-Politics/dp/0767917189&lt;/ref&gt;. The topics dealt with the American war effort in the First World War and were presented during the four minutes between reels changing in movie theaters across the country. Also, the speeches were made to be four minutes so that they could be given at town meetings, restaurants, and other places that had an audience. This is an instance of "viral marketing" before its time.

== History==
{{Main|Presidency of Woodrow Wilson#Propaganda}}
On April, 6th 1917 the [[United States Congress|US Congress]] declared war on Germany. President Wilson was determined to rouse the public.

Wilson established the first modern propaganda office, the [[Committee on Public Information]] (CPI), headed by [[George Creel]].&lt;ref&gt;George Creel,  [https://archive.org/details/howweadvertameri00creerich ''How We Advertised America: The First Telling of the Amazing Story of the Committee on Public Information That Carried the Gospel of Americanism to Every Corner of the Globe.'' (1920)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Vaughn, ''Holding Fast the Inner Lines: Democracy, Nationalism, and the Committee on Public Information'' (1980). [https://www.questia.com/library/1664084/holding-fast-the-inner-lines-democracy-nationalism online]&lt;/ref&gt;  Creel set out to systematically reach every person in the United States multiple times with patriotic information about how the individual could contribute to the war effort. It also worked with the post office to censor seditious counter-propaganda.   Creel set up divisions in his new agency to produce and distribute innumerable copies of pamphlets, newspaper releases, magazine advertisements, films, school campaigns, and the speeches of the Four Minute Men.  CPI created colorful posters that appeared in every store window, catching the attention of the passersby for a few seconds.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine H. Adams, ''Progressive Politics and the Training of America’s Persuaders'' (1999) &lt;/ref&gt; Movie theaters were widely attended, and the CPI trained thousands of volunteer speakers to make patriotic appeals during the four-minute breaks needed to change reels.  They also spoke at churches, lodges, fraternal organizations, labor unions, and even logging camps. Speeches were mostly in English, but ethnic groups were reached in their own languages.
[[File:111-SC-16569 - NARA - 55193236.jpg|thumb|left|Douglas Fairbanks delivering a speech in support of the 3rd Liberty Loan]]

CPI Director [[George Creel]] boasted that in 18 months his 75,000 volunteers delivered over 7.5 million four minute orations to over 300 million listeners, in a nation of 103 million people.  The speakers attended training sessions through local universities, and were given pamphlets and speaking tips on a wide variety of topics, such as buying Liberty Bonds, registering for the draft, rationing food, recruiting unskilled workers for munitions jobs, and supporting Red Cross programs.  Ethnic groups were reached in their own languages.&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Mastrangelo,  "World War I, public intellectuals, and the Four Minute Men: Convergent ideals of public speaking and civic participation." ''Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs'' 12#4 (2009): 607-633.&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref&gt;Committee on public information, ''Complete Report of the Committee on Public Information: 1917, 1918, 1919'' (1920) [https://archive.org/details/CompleteReportCommitteeOnPublicInformation191719181919 online free]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose==
With many millions of [[German Americans]] in the United States, as well as [[Irish Americans]] and [[Scandinavian Americans]] and poor rural Southerners, with strong isolationist feelings, there was a strong need for a [[propaganda]] campaign to stir support for the war. This effort had many unique challenges to meet to address the existing [[political climate]]. Wilson needed to speak directly to the fragmented and spread out audience in the United States.  He had to address the country's self-perception to generate support for the war. The Four-Minute Men provided an answer to these challenges.&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Mastrangelo,  "World War I, public intellectuals, and the Four Minute Men: Convergent ideals of public speaking and civic participation." ''Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs'' 12#4 (2009): 607-633.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the Four Minute Men urged citizens to purchase [[Liberty Bonds]] and Thrift Stamps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3qhRAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA796|title=The American Year Book: A Record of Events and Progress, Volume 1918|date=1919|publisher=T. Nelson &amp; Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv1tAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT87|last1=Stone|first1=Oliver|last2=Kuznick|first2=Peter|title=The Untold History of the United States, Volume 1: Young Readers Edition, 1898-1945|date=2014|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9781481421751}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SvQ-AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA25&amp;lpg=PA25&amp;dq=%22I+sell+Liberty+Bonds+and+Thrift+Stamps%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EOf1CjPvgq&amp;sig=BROyHMYJdoYcguUkjl1hsl7UmGY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjMyJ_X3JvMAhUK0h4KHRPgBesQ6AEIKDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=%22I%20sell%20Liberty%20Bonds%20and%20Thrift%20Stamps%22&amp;f=false|title=The Four Minute Men of Chicago|date=1919|publisher=United States Committee on Public Information|location=Chicago, Illinois|pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Addressing challenges==
The Four Minute Men idea became a useful tool in the propaganda campaign because it addressed a specific [[rhetorical situation]]. One of the challenges of the effort was the fragmented audience of the United States. Many different heritages were represented in the United States, and the president needed their support for the war. To address each groups specific needs, the director of the Four Minute Men, William McCormick Blair, delegated the duty of speaking to local men. Well known and respected community figures often volunteered for the Four Minute Men program. This gave the speeches a local voice. Also, the four minute men were given general topics and talking points to follow and rotated between theaters to help the speeches seem fresh, instead of generic propaganda speeches.

These speeches usually celebrated Woodrow Wilson as a larger than life character and the Germans as less-than-human huns. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Liberal-Fascism-American-Mussolini-Politics/dp/0767917189&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
The four minute men was a division of the Committee on Public Information, headed by [[George Creel]]. The Committee on Public Information appointed William McCormick Blair as director of the Four Minute Men. Blair appointed state chairmen of the Four Minute Men, who then would appoint a city or community chairman. Each of these appointments needed to be approved in Washington. The local chairman would then appoint a number of speakers to cover the theaters in the city or community for which he is responsible.

The '''Full-Scale Tunnel'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/researchernews/rn_FSTdemo.html Langley News (NASA)]&lt;/ref&gt; (abbreviated '''FST''', also known as the '''30-by 60-Foot Tunnel'''&lt;ref name="nrhpinv2"/&gt;) was a [[wind tunnel]] at [[NASA]]'s [[Langley Research Center]]. It was a [[National Historic Landmark]].

In 1929, [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] began construction of the world's first full-scale wind tunnel. The design team was led by Smith J. DeFrance. The tunnel was completed in 1931 (dedicated 27 May) at a cost just under $900,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://crgis.ndc.nasa.gov/historic/643 NASA]&lt;/ref&gt; It was a double-return tunnel capable of moving air at speeds up to 118 miles/hour (190&amp;nbsp;km/h) through its circuit. It had a 30&amp;nbsp;ft by 60&amp;nbsp;ft (9.1 m x 18.3 m) open throat, which is capable of testing aircraft with spans of 40&amp;nbsp;ft (12.2 m).The wind tunnel is a double-return, atmospheric pressure tunnel with two fans powered by 4,000&amp;nbsp;hp electric motors.

The [[Vought O2U Corsair|Vought O3U-1 biplane observation]] airplane was the first complete airplane tested in the tunnel. After that, it was used to test virtually every high-performance aircraft used by the [[United States]] in [[World War II]]. For much of the war, when it was operational 24 hours a day, seven days a week, the full-scale tunnel was the only tunnel in the free world large enough to perform these tests.

[[File:Man examining fan of Langley Research Center 16 foot transonic wind tunnel.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Maintenance on the fan]]

After the war, many types of aircraft were tested in the tunnel including the [[Harrier Jump Jet]] fighter, the [[F-16]], the [[Boeing 2707|American supersonic transport]], the [[Space Shuttle]] and [[Moon landing|Lunar Landing Test Vehicle]]. During the 1950s and 1960s, the tunnel was modified and upgraded several times. The principal improvement was adding the ability to test free-flying scale models in the test throat.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/factsheets/30X60.html NASA Langley's 30- by 60-foot Tunnel]&lt;/ref&gt; The wind tunnel was in use through the 2000s, testing procedures such as free-flight and high angle of attack.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://oea.larc.nasa.gov/PAIS/Landmarks.html#FST NASA Langley's National Historic Landmarks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509185106/http://oea.larc.nasa.gov/PAIS/Landmarks.html |date=2008-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1985.&lt;ref name="nhlsum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nrhpinv2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: 30- by 60-Foot Tunnel / Full Scale Tunnel|url={{NHLS url|id=85002796}}|format=pdf|date=May 15, 1984|author=Harry A.

The distance between the genes (map units) are equal to the percentage of [[Chromosomal crossover|crossing-over]] events that occurs between different alleles. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mader |first=Sylvia |date=2007 |title=Biology Ninth Edition |location= New York |publisher= McGraw-Hill |page= 209 |isbn= 978-0-07-325839-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Gene mapping''' describes the methods used to identify the [[locus (genetics)|locus]] of a gene and the distances between genes.&lt;ref name="Lister Hill"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gene mapping - Glossary Entry |url=http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/glossary=genemapping|date=2013-09-03|work=[http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/ Genetics Home Reference]|publisher=Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications,  an Intramural Research Division of the [[United States National Library of Medicine|U.S. National Library of Medicine]]|accessdate=2013-09-06|location=Bethesda, MD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The essence of all [[genome]] mapping is to place a collection of molecular markers onto their respective positions on the genome. [[Molecular marker]]s come in all forms. Genes can be viewed as one special type of genetic markers in the construction of genome maps, and mapped the same way as any other markers.

==Genetic mapping vs physical mapping==
There are two distinctive types of "Maps" used in the field of genome mapping: genetic maps and physical maps. While both maps are a collection of [[genetic markers]] and gene loci, genetic maps' distances are based on the genetic linkage information, while physical maps use actual physical distances usually measured in number of base pairs. While the physical map could be a more "accurate" representation of the genome, genetic maps often offer insights into the nature of different regions of the chromosome, e.g. the genetic distance to physical distance ratio varies greatly at different genomic regions which reflects different recombination rates, and such rate is often indicative of euchromatic (usually gene-rich) vs heterochromatic (usually gene poor) regions of the genome.

===Gene mapping===
Researchers begin a genetic map by collecting samples of blood or tissue from family members that carry a prominent disease or trait and family members that don't. Scientists then isolate DNA from the samples and closely examine it, looking for unique patterns in the DNA of the family members who do carry the disease that the DNA of those who don't carry the disease don't have. These unique molecular patterns in the DNA are referred to as polymorphisms, or markers.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.genome.gov/10000715&lt;/ref&gt;

The first steps of building a genetic map are the development of [[genetic marker]]s and a mapping population. The closer two markers are on the chromosome, the more likely they are to be passed on to the next generation together. Therefore, the "co-segregation" patterns of all markers can be used to reconstruct their order. With this in mind, the genotypes of each genetic marker are recorded for both parents and each individual in the following generations. The quality of the genetic maps is largely dependent upon these factors: the number of genetic markers on the map and the size of the mapping population. The two factors are interlinked, as a larger mapping population could increase the "resolution" of the map and prevent the map being "saturated".

In gene mapping, any sequence feature that can be faithfully distinguished from the two parents can be used as a genetic marker. Genes, in this regard, are represented by "traits" that can be faithfully distinguished between two parents. Their linkage with other genetic markers are calculated in the same way as if they are common markers and the actual gene loci are then bracketed in a region between the two nearest neighbouring markers. The entire process is then repeated by looking at more markers which target that region to map the gene neighbourhood to a higher resolution until a specific causative locus can be identified. This process is often referred to as "[[positional cloning]]", and it is used extensively in the study of plant species
The great advantage of genetic mapping is that it can identify the relative position of genes based solely on their phenotypic effect.

===Physical mapping===
Since actual base-pair distances are generally hard or impossible to directly measure, physical maps are actually constructed by first shattering the genome into hierarchically smaller pieces. By characterizing each single piece and assembling back together, the overlapping path or "tiling path" of these small fragments would allow researchers to infer physical distances between genomic features. The fragmentation of the genome can be achieved by [[restriction enzyme]] cutting or by physically shattering the genome by processes like sonication. Once cut, the DNA fragments are separated by [[electrophoresis]]. The resulting pattern of DNA migration (i.e. its [[genetic fingerprint]]) is used to identify what stretch of DNA is in the [[Clone (genetics)|clone]]. By analyzing the fingerprints, [[contig]]s are assembled by automated (FPC) or manual means (pathfinders) into overlapping DNA stretches. Now a good choice of clones can be made to efficiently sequence the clones to determine the DNA sequence of the organism under study.

In physical mapping, there are no direct ways of marking up a specific gene since the mapping does not include any information that concerns traits and functions. Genetic markers can be linked to a physical map by processes like [[in situ hybridization]]. By this approach, physical map contigs can be "anchored" onto a genetic map. The clones used in the physical map contigs can then be sequenced on a local scale to help new genetic marker design and identification of the causative loci.

Macrorestriction is a type of physical mapping wherein the high molecular weight DNA is digested with a restriction enzyme having a low number of restriction sites.

There are alternative ways to determine how [[DNA]] in a group of clones overlaps without completely sequencing the clones. Once the map is determined, the clones can be used as a resource to efficiently contain large stretches of the genome. This type of mapping is more accurate than genetic maps.

===Genome sequencing===
Genome sequencing is sometimes mistakenly referred to as "genome mapping" by non-biologists. The process of "shotgun sequencing" resembles the process of physical mapping: it shatters the genome into small fragments, characterizes each fragment, then puts them back together (more recent sequencing technologies are drastically different). While the scope, purpose and process are totally different, a genome assembly can be viewed as the "ultimate" form of physical map, in that it provides in a much better way all the information that a traditional physical map can offer.

==Use==
Identification of genes is usually the first step in understanding a genome of a species; mapping of the gene is usually the first step of identification of the gene. Gene mapping is usually the starting point of many important downstream studies.

===Disease association===
The process to identify a genetic element that is responsible for a [[disease]] is also referred to as "mapping". If the locus in which the search is performed is already considerably constrained, the search is called the ''fine mapping'' of a gene. This information is derived from the investigation of disease manifestations in large families ([[genetic linkage]]) or from populations-based [[genetic association]] studies.

'''Geoinformatics''' is the science and the technology which develops and uses [[information science]] infrastructure to address the problems of [[geography]], [[cartography]], [[geosciences]] and related branches of science and engineering.

==Overview==

Geoinformatics has been described as "the science and technology dealing with the structure and character of spatial information, its capture, its classification and qualification, its storage, processing, portrayal and dissemination, including the infrastructure necessary to secure optimal use of this information"&lt;ref&gt;P.L.N. Raju, Fundamentals of Geographic Information Systems&lt;/ref&gt; or "the art, science or technology dealing with the acquisition, storage, processing production, presentation and dissemination of geoinformation".&lt;ref&gt;M. Ehlers (2008) Geoinformatics and digital earth initiatives: a German perspective, International Journal of Digital Earth, 1:1, 17-30, DOI: 10.1080/17538940701781975&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Geomatics]] is a similarly used term which encompasses geoinformatics, but geomatics focuses more so on [[surveying]]. Geoinformatics has at its core the technologies supporting the processes of acquiring, analyzing and visualizing spatial data. Both geomatics and geoinformatics include and rely heavily upon the theory and practical implications of [[geodesy]].

Geography and earth science increasingly rely on digital spatial data acquired from remotely sensed images analyzed by [[geographical information systems]] (GIS) and visualized on paper or the computer screen.&lt;ref&gt;Bouloucos and Brown, ITC Courses in Remote Sensing, GIS and Photogrammetry&lt;/ref&gt;

Geoinformatics combines geospatial analysis and modeling, development of geospatial databases, information systems design, human-computer interaction and both wired and wireless networking technologies. Geoinformatics uses [[geocomputation]] and [[geovisualization]] for analyzing [[geoinformation]].

Branches of geoinformatics include:

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Research==

Research in this field is used to support global and local environmental, energy and security programs. The Geographic Information Science and Technology group of [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] is supported by various government departments and agencies including the [[United States Department of Energy]]. It is currently the only group in the [[United States Department of Energy National Laboratories|United States Department of Energy National Laboratory System]] to focus on advanced theory and application research in this field. There are also a lot of interdiscipline research involved in geoinformatics fields including computer science, information technology, software engineering, biogeography, geography, conservation, architecture, spatial analysis and reinformacement learning.

==Applications==

Many fields benefit from geoinformatics, including urban planning and land use management, in-car navigation systems, virtual globes, public health, local and national gazetteer management, environmental modeling and analysis, military, transport network planning and management, agriculture, meteorology and climate change, oceanography and coupled ocean and atmosphere modelling, business location planning, architecture and archeological reconstruction, telecommunications, criminology and crime simulation, aviation, biodiversity conservation and maritime transport.
The importance of the spatial dimension in assessing, monitoring and modelling various issues and problems related to sustainable management of natural resources is recognized all over the world. Geoinformatics becomes very important technology to decision-makers across a wide range of disciplines, industries, commercial sector, environmental agencies, local and national government, research, and academia, national survey and mapping organisations, International organisations, United Nations, emergency services, public health and epidemiology, crime mapping, transportation and infrastructure, information technology industries, GIS consulting firms, environmental management agencies), tourist industry, utility companies, market analysis and e-commerce, mineral exploration, etc. Many government and non government agencies started to use spatial data for managing their day-to-day activities.

'''''Growing Up''''' is a [[sex education]] film for schools, 23 minutes in length, first shown in April 1971, which was made by [[Martin Cole (sexologist)|Dr Martin Cole]]. It is now available as part of ''The Joy of Sex Education'' DVD&lt;ref name=BFI&gt;BFI video (2 Feb 2009) ASIN: B001MGUAEW&lt;/ref&gt; and was described by one critic as "the most famous and controversial inclusion",&lt;ref name=Davidson&gt;[http://www.moviemail-online.co.uk/scripts/reviews.pl?attribution=Alex%20Davidson Moviemail] Film Reviews By Alex Davidson&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Peter Bradshaw]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' as the "undoubted masterpiece of this double-DVD set".&lt;ref name=Bradshaw&gt;Peter Bradshaw [https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2009/feb/11/sex-education-films "Sex education films: they don't make them like they used to",] ''The Guardian'' (film blog), 11 Feb 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of its release it was said to be "the most explicit and frank film ever made for use in schools",&lt;ref name=DMirror710113&gt;"A sex-act film for children", ''Daily Mirror'' 13 January 1971&lt;/ref&gt; and attracted condemnation by [[Mary Whitehouse]], [[Lord Longford]],&lt;ref name=DMirror710417&gt;"Peer slams school sex film", ''Daily Mirror'', 17 April 1971&lt;/ref&gt; [[Margaret Thatcher]]&lt;ref name=DMirror710422&gt;"That sex film gets 'X' certificate", ''Daily Mirror'', 22 April 1971&lt;/ref&gt; and members of the [[Women's Liberation Movement]] who all, excepting Thatcher, attended the first public screening.&lt;ref name="Lewin"&gt;Roger Lewin [https://books.google.com/books?id=s_mRNA9HJwgC&amp;pg=PA301&amp;lpg=PA301&amp;dq=%22Martin+Cole%22+biologist+sex&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=N8vs_kRQ5e&amp;sig=d1Cbx3MtEI8UraazkiRdz0y2N48&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=cF-4TLrBJoyOjAfou-WpDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Growing up too fast",] ''New Scientist and Science Journal'', 6 May 1971, p.301&lt;/ref&gt; Made two years before its earliest public showing, Cole though soon regretted a traditionalist description of gender roles in the film's opening commentary. The function of women was described as "giving birth to children", while it claimed men were "better at giving birth to ideas", a sequence which the Women's Liberation Movement objected to.&lt;ref name="Lewin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11691820/Martin-Cole-sexologist-obituary.html "Martin Cole, sexologist - obituary"], ''Daily Telegraph'', 22 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt; There was a version of the film shown to [[Aston University]] students earlier for feedback prior to the final version being released. It features scenes rather than drawings of naked people, which included intercourse and masturbation. Teachers and pupils gave it positive feedback, but the absence of a discussion of [[Sexually transmitted disease|venereal disease]] (VD) was noted by sympathetic reviewers.&lt;ref name="Lewin"/&gt;

The film triggered a national controversy;&lt;ref name=Limond&gt;Limond, David (2008) ''History of Education'' '''37''' (3) 409&amp;ndash;429 "‘I never imagined that the time would come’: Martin Cole, the Growing Up Controversy and the Limits of School Sex Education in 1970s England"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7892257.stm "The Joy of Sex Education"], BBC Magazine, 16 Feb 2009&lt;/ref&gt;"Educationally speaking, it is a rotten film", Whitehouse said after viewing the film, "which makes children no more than animals."&lt;ref name="Sandbrook"&gt;Dominic Sandbrook ''State of Emergency, The Way We Were: Britain 1970-74'', London: Allen Lane, 2010, p.421-22&lt;/ref&gt; Margaret Thatcher, then secretary of state for education who had sent an advisor to view the film, told the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on 21 April that she was "very perturbed" at the thought of the film being shown in schools and suggested local education authorities consider it "with extreme caution".&lt;ref name="Sandbrook"/&gt;

After insisting on a screening, the education authority in [[Birmingham]], where Cole lived, banned the film from being shown in the city's schools.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Arnot [https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/how-lack-of-orgasms-turned-to-lack-of-interest-remember-the-sex-therapist-whose-patients-were-treated-by-surrogate-lovers-chris-arnot-tracked-him-down-happily-practising-in-suburban-birmingham-1487642.html "How lack of orgasms turned to lack of interest",] ''The Independent'', 28 July 1993&lt;/ref&gt; There is no record of the film being shown to school children anywhere by the end of 1971, although it was shown to students at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]].&lt;ref name="Sandbrook"/&gt;

New York:Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to carry out this work, historical ecologists synthesize long-series data collected by practitioners in diverse fields.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Scholl, Michael D., D.

&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than concentrating on one specific event, historical ecology aims to study and understand this interaction across both time and space in order to gain a full understanding of its cumulative effects. Through this interplay, humans adapt to ''and'' shape the environment, continuously contributing to [[landscape]] transformation. Historical ecologists recognize that humans have had world-wide influences, impact landscape in dissimilar ways which increase or decrease species diversity, and that a holistic perspective is critical to be able to understand that system.&lt;ref name="Balee1"&gt;Balée, W. (1998). "Historical ecology: Premises and postulates". In W. Balée (Ed.), Advances in Historical Ecology, (pp 13-29). Columbia University Press, New York. {{ISBN|0-231-10633-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Piecing together landscapes requires a sometimes difficult union between [[natural science|natural]] and [[social science]]s, close attention to geographic and temporal scales, a knowledge of the range of human ecological complexity, and the presentation of findings in a way that is useful to researchers in many fields.&lt;ref&gt;Crumley, Carole L.

1994. Historical Ecology:a Multidimensional Ecological Orientation. In Historical Ecology: Cultural Knowledge and Changing Landscapes, ed. C.L. Crumley, pp. 1-16. Santa Fe: School  of American Research Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Those tasks require theory and methods drawn from [[geography]], [[biology]], [[ecology]], [[history]], [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], and other disciplines. Common methods include historical research, climatological reconstructions, plant and animal surveys, archaeological excavations, [[ethnography|ethnographic interviews]], and landscape reconstructions.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==History==
The discipline has several sites of origins by researchers who shared a common interest in the problem of ecology and history, but with a diversity of approaches.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; [[Edward Smith Deevey, Jr.]] used the term in the 1960s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deevey | first1 = E. S. | year = 1964 | title = General and historical ecology | url = | journal = BioScience | volume = 14 | issue = 7| pages = 33–35 | doi=10.2307/1293234}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to describe a methodology that had been in long development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deevey | first1 = E. S. | year = 1944 | title = Analysis and Mexican archaeology: an attempt to apply the method | url = | journal = American Antiquity | volume = 10 | issue = 2| pages = 135–149 | doi=10.2307/275110}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Deevey wished to bring together the practices of "general ecology" which was studied in an experimental laboratory, with a "historical ecology" which relied on  evidence collected through fieldwork. For example, Deevey used [[radiocarbon dating]] to reconcile biologists’ successions of plants and animals with the sequences of [[material culture]] and sites discovered by archaeologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deevey | first1 = E. S. | year = 1969 | title = Coaxing history to conduct experiments | url = | journal = BioScience | volume = 19 | issue = 1| pages = 40–43 | doi=10.2307/1294629}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, members of the history department at the [[University of Arkansas at Little Rock]] organized a lecture series entitled "Historical Ecology: Essays on Environment and Social Change"&lt;ref&gt;Bilsky, L. J., ed. (1980) ''Historical ecology: essays on environment and social change''. Port Washington, NY: Kenniket Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The authors noted the public’s concerns with pollution and dwindling natural resources, and they began a dialogue between researchers with specialties which spanned the social sciences. The papers highlighted the importance of understanding social and political structures,  personal identities, perceptions of nature, and the multiplicity of solutions for environmental problems.&lt;ref&gt;Moneyhon, C. H. (1980). Introduction. In ''Historical ecology: essays on environment and social change''.ed. L. J. Bilsky, pp. 3-8. Port Washington, NY, Kenniket Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of historical ecology as a coherent discipline was driven by a number of long-term research projects in historical ecology of tropical, temperate and arctic environments:

E.S. Deevey's Historical Ecology of the Maya Project (1973-1984) was carried out by archaeologists and biologists who combined data from lake sediments, settlement patterns, and material from excavations in the central [[Petén District]] of [[Guatemala]] to refute the hypotheses that a collapse of Mayan urban areas was instigated by faltering food production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rice | first1 = D. | last2 = Rice | first2 = P. | year = 1984 | title = Lessons from the Maya | url = | journal = Latin American Research Review | volume = 19 | issue = 3| pages = 7–34 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carole L. Crumley's Burgundian Landscape Project (1974–present) is carried out by a multidisciplinary research team aimed at identifying the multiple factors which have contributed to the long-term durability of the agricultural economy of [[Burgundy, France]].&lt;ref&gt;Carole L. Crumley, W. H. Marquardt (1987) ''Regional Dynamics: Burgundian Landscapes in Historical Perspective''. New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas H. McGovern's Inuit-Norse Project (1976–present) uses archaeology, environmental reconstruction, and textual analysis to examine the changing ecology of Nordic colonizers and indigenous peoples in [[Greenland]], [[Iceland]], [[Faeroes]], and [[Shetland]].&lt;ref&gt;McGovern, T. 1981.

Cambridge: Cambridge  University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years the approaches to historical ecology have been expanded to include coastal and marine environments:

Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary Project (1984–present) examines [[Massachusetts]], USA cod fishing in the 17th through 19th centuries through historical records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosenberg | first1 = A.A. | last2 = Bolster | first2 = W.J. | last3 = Alexander | first3 = K.E. | last4 = Leavenworth | first4 = W.B. | last5 = Cooper | first5 = A.B. | last6 = McKenzie | first6 = M.G. | year = 2005 | title = The history of ocean resources: modeling cod biomass using historical records | doi = 10.1890/1540-9295(2005)003[0078:thoorm]2.0.co;2 | journal = Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 84–90 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Florida Keys Coral Reef Eco-region Project (1990–present) researchers at the [[Scripps Institute of Oceanography]] are examining archival records including natural history descriptions, maps and charts, family and personal papers, and state and colonial records in order to understand the impact of over-fishing and habitat loss in the [[Florida Keys]], USA which contains the third largest coral reef in the world.

==Relations with other disciplines==

[[File:Idaho Falls Idaho Temple 2.jpeg|thumb|Manmade nature: In [[Idaho Falls, Idaho]], these waterfalls replaced naturally occurring ones]]
Historical ecology is interdisciplinary in principle; at the same time, it borrows heavily from the rich intellectual history of [[environmental anthropology]]. Western scholars have known since the time of [[Plato]] that the history of environmental changes cannot be separated from human history. Several ideas have been used to describe human interaction with the environment, the first of which is the concept of the [[Great Chain of Being]], or inherent design in nature. In this, all forms of life are ordered, with Humanity as the highest being, due to its knowledge and ability to modify nature. This lends to the concept of another nature, a manmade nature, which involves design or modification by humans, as opposed to design inherent in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Glacken, C. (1956). Changing ideas of the habitable world. In W. L. Thomas (Ed.), Man's role in changing the phase of the Earth (pp 73). Chicago: University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Interest in environmental transformation continued to increase in the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, resulting in a series of new intellectual approaches. One of these approaches was [[environmental determinism]], developed by geographer [[Friedrich Ratzel]]. This view held that it is not social conditions, but environmental conditions, which determine the culture of a population. Ratzsel also viewed humans as restricted by nature, for their behaviors are limited to and defined by their environment. A later approach was the historical viewpoint of [[Franz Boas]] which refuted environmental determinism, claiming that it is not nature, but specifics of history, that shape human cultures. This approach recognized that although the environment may place limitations on societies, every environment will impact each culture differently. [[Julian Steward]]'s [[cultural ecology]] is considered a fusion of environmental determinism and Boas' historical approach. Steward felt it was neither nature nor culture that had the most impact on a population, but instead, the mode of subsistence used in a given environment.

Anthropologist [[Roy Rappaport]] introduced the field of ecological anthropology in a deliberate attempt to move away from cultural ecology. Studies in ecological anthropology borrow heavily from the natural sciences, in particular, the concept of the ecosystem from [[systems ecology]]. In this approach, also called systems theory, ecosystems are seen as self-regulating, and as returning to a state of equilibrium. This theory views human populations as static and as acting in harmony with the environment.&lt;ref name="balee2"&gt;Balée, W. (2006). "The research program of historical ecology". Annual Review of Anthropology. Vol. 35, pp5.1-5.24.&lt;/ref&gt;

The revisions of anthropologist [[Eric Wolf]] and others are especially pertinent to the development of historical ecology. These revisions and related critiques of environmental anthropology undertook to take into account the temporal and spatial dimensions of history and cultures, rather than continuing to view populations as static. These critiques led to the development of historical ecology by revealing the need to consider the historical, cultural, and evolutionary nature of landscapes and societies. Thus, historical ecology as a research program developed to allow for the examination of all types of societies, simple or complex, and their interactions with the environment over [[Philosophy of space and time|space and time]].

==Landscapes in historical ecology==

In historical ecology, the [[landscape]] is defined as an area of interaction between human culture and the non-human environment.  The landscape is a perpetually changing, physical manifestation of history.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, T. G. (2000). Landscape, ecology and ecosystems management. Retrieved March 15, 2008, from Cooperative Extension Service, University of Kentucky Web site: http://www.ca.uky.edu/agc/pubs/for/for76/for76.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Historical ecology revises the notion of the [[ecosystem]] and replaces it with the landscape. While an ecosystem is static and cyclic, a landscape is historical. While the ecosystem concept views the environment as always trying to return to a state of equilibrium, the landscape concept considers "landscape transformation" to be a process of evolution. Landscapes do not return to a state of equilibrium, but are palimpsests of successive disturbances over time.&lt;ref name=balee2 /&gt; The use of "landscape" instead of "ecosystem" as the core unit of analysis lies at the heart of historical ecology.

[[File:Carl O. Sauer.jpg|thumb|left|Geographer Carl O. Sauer]]
Various individuals and schools of thought have informed the idea of the landscape as historical ecologists conceive of it. The Old English words ''landskift'', ''landscipe'' or ''landscaef'' refer to environments that have been altered by humans.&lt;ref&gt;Calder, W.'', 1981 Beyond the View - our changing landscapes''. Inkata Press, Melbourne.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, J.B., 1986, "The vernacular landscape", in Penning-Rowsell, E.C. &amp; D. Lowenthal, ''Landscape Meanings and Values'', Allen &amp; Unwin, London, p 65-79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = James | first1 = P.E. | year = 1934 | title = The terminology of regional description | url = | journal = Annals of the Association of American Geographers | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 78–79 | doi=10.1080/00045603409357125}}&lt;/ref&gt; As this etymology demonstrates, landscapes have been conceived of as related to human culture since at least the 5th century CE. Cultural and historical geographers have had a more recent influence. They adopted this idea from nineteenth-century German architects, gardeners, and landscape painters in Europe, Australia, and North America.&lt;ref name=Olwig&gt;Olwig, K (2002). ''Landscape, nature, and the body politic''. Madison, Wisconsin: University of Wisconsin Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Landscapes are not only physical objects, but also "forms of knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Carol. 1991. ''On Site: Architectural Preoccupations.'' Princeton: Princeton Architectural Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Landscapes have cultural meanings, for example, the sacredness in many cultures of burial grounds. This recognition of landscapes as forms of knowledge is central to historical ecology, which studies landscapes from an anthropocentric perspective.&lt;ref name=balee2/&gt;

The idea of the cultural landscape is directly attributed to American geographer [[Carl Sauer]]. Sauer's theories developed as a critique of environmental determinism, which was a popular theory in the early twentieth century. Sauer's pioneering 1925 paper "The Morphology of Landscape" is now fundamental to many disciplines and defines the domain. In this, the term landscape is used in a geographical sense to mean an arbitrarily selected section of reality; morphology means the conceptual and methodological processes for altering it. Hence to Sauer, wherever humans lived and impacted the environment, landscapes with determinate histories resulted.&lt;ref name="Kenzer, M. S. 1985"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kenzer | first1 = M. S. | year = 1985 | title = Milieu and the 'intellectual landscape': Carl O. Sauer's undergraduate heritage | url = | journal = Annals of the Association of American Geographers | volume = 75 | issue = 2| pages = 258–270 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8306.1985.tb00085.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The perception of the landscape in historical ecology differs from other disciplines, such as [[landscape ecology]]. Landscape ecologists often attribute the depletion of biodiversity to human disturbance. Historical ecologists recognize that this is not always true. These changes are due to multiple factors that contribute to the ever-changing landscape. Landscape ecology still focuses on areas defined as ecosystems.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Turner | first1 = M. G. | year = 2005 | title = Landscape ecology in North America: Past, present and future | url = | journal = Ecology | volume = 86 | issue = 8| pages = 1967–1974 | doi=10.1890/04-0890}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this, the ecosystem perpetually returns to a state of equilibrium. In contrast, historical ecologists view the landscape as perpetually changing. Landscape ecologists view noncyclical human events and natural disasters as external influences, while historical ecologists view disturbances as an integral part of the landscape's history. It is this integration of the concept of disturbance and history that allows for landscape to be viewed as [[palimpsest]]s, representing successive layers of change, rather than as static entities.

Historical ecologists recognize that landscapes undergo continuous alteration over time and these modifications are part of that landscape's history. Historical ecology recognizes that there is a primary and a secondary succession that occurs in the landscape. These successions should be understood without a preconceived bias against humanity. Landscape transformations are ecological successions driven by human impacts.  Primary landscape transformations occur when human activity results in a complete turnover of species and major [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]] modifications in certain habitats while secondary landscape transformations involve human-induced changes in species proportions. The stages of landscape transformation demonstrate the history of a landscape. These stages can be brought on by humans or natural causes.&lt;ref name=balee2/&gt; Parts of the Amazon rainforest exhibit different stages of landscape transformation such as the impact of indigenous [[slash-and-burn]] horticulture on plant species compositions. Such landscape transformation does not inherently reduce biodiversity or harm the environment. There are many cases in which human-mediated disturbance increases biodiversity as landscapes transform over time.

Historical ecology challenges the very notion of a pristine landscape, such as virgin rainforests.&lt;ref name=balee2/&gt; The idea that the landscape of the New World was uninhabited and unchanged by those groups that did inhabit it was fundamental to the justifications of colonialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Denevan | first1 = William | year = 1992 | title = The Pristine Myth: The Landscape of the Americas in 1492 | url = | journal = Annals of the Association of American Geographers | volume = 82 | issue = 3| pages = 369–385 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8306.1992.tb01965.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, perceptions of landscape have profound consequences on the histories of societies and their interactions with the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Sluyter, Andrew (2002) [https://books.google.com/books/about/Colonialism_and_landscape.html?id=XA6R9UG2WxQC ''Colonialism and Landscape: Postcolonial Theory and Applications'']. New York: Rowman &amp; Littlefield.&lt;/ref&gt; All landscapes have been altered by various organisms and mechanisms prior to human existence on Earth. Humans have always transformed the landscapes they inhabit, however, and today there are no landscapes on Earth that have not been affected by humans in some way.&lt;ref name=balee2/&gt;

Human alterations have occurred in different phases, including the period prior to [[industrialization]]. These changes have been studied through the archeological record of modern humans and their history. The evidence that classless societies, like [[foragers]] and trekkers, were able to change a landscape was a breakthrough in historical ecology and anthropology as a whole.&lt;ref name=balee2/&gt; Using an approach that combines history, ecology, and anthropology, a landscape's history can be observed and deduced through the traces of the various mechanisms that have altered it, anthropogenic or otherwise. Understanding the unique nature of every landscape, in addition to relations among landscapes, and the forms which comprise the landscape, is key to understanding historical ecology.&lt;ref&gt;Sauer, C. 1969 (1925). "The morphology of landscape." In J. Leighly (Ed.), ''Land and Life'' (pp 312-343). Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human-mediated disturbance==

[[File:Dalbek P1210001.JPG|thumb|Man-made irrigation canal]]
''Homo sapiens'' have interacted with the environment throughout history, generating a long-lasting influence on landscapes worldwide. Humans sometimes actively change their landscapes, while at other times their actions alter landscapes through secondary effects. These changes are called human-mediated disturbances, and are effected through various mechanisms. These mechanisms vary; they may be detrimental in some cases, but advantageous in others.&lt;ref name="Kenzer, M. S. 1985"/&gt;

Both destructive and at times constructive, [[anthropogenic fire]] is the most immediately visible human-mediated disturbance, and without it, many landscapes would become denatured.&lt;ref&gt;Pyne, S. J. (1998). "Forged in fire: History, land, and anthropogenic fire". In W. Balée (Ed.), ''Advances in Historical Ecology'', (pp 64-103). Columbia University Press, New York. {{ISBN|0-231-10633-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans have practiced [[controlled burn]]s of forests globally for thousands of years, shaping landscapes in order to better fit their needs. They burned vegetation and forests to create space for crops, sometimes resulting in higher levels of species diversity. Today, in the absence of indigenous populations who once practiced controlled burns (most notably in [[North America]] and [[Australia]]), naturally ignited wildfires have increased. In addition, there has been destabilization of "ecosystem after ecosystem, and there is good documentation to suggest fire exclusion by Europeans has led to floral and faunal extinctions."&lt;ref name="Kenzer, M. S. 1985"/&gt;

[[Invasive species|Biological invasions]] and the spread of [[pathogen]]s and [[disease]]s are two mechanisms that spread both inadvertently and purposefully. Biological invasions begin with introductions of foreign species or biota into an already existing environment. They can be spread by stowaways on ships or even as weapons in warfare.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; In some cases a new species may wreak havoc on a landscape, causing the loss of native species and destruction of the landscape. In other cases, the new species may fill a previously empty niche, and play a positive role. The spread of new pathogens, viruses, and diseases rarely have any positive effects; new pathogens and viruses sometimes destroy populations lacking immunities to those diseases. Some pathogens have the ability to transfer from one species to another, and may be spread as a secondary effect of a biological invasion.

Other mechanisms of human-mediated disturbances include [[water management]] and [[soil management]]. In [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] Europe, these have been recognized as ways of landscape alteration since the [[Roman Empire]]. [[Cicero]] noted that through fertilization, irrigation, and other activities, humans had essentially created a second world.&lt;ref name=balee2 /&gt; At present, [[fertilization]] yields larger, more productive harvests of crops, but also has had adverse effects on many landscapes, such as decreasing the diversity of plant species and adding pollutants to soils.

===Anthropogenic fire===

Anthropogenic fire is a mechanism of human-mediated disturbance, defined within historical ecology as a means of altering the landscape in a way that better suits human needs.&lt;ref name=Balee1 /&gt; The most common form of anthropogenic fire is controlled burns, or broadcast burning, which people have employed for thousands of years.  Forest fires and burning tend to carry negative connotations, yet controlled burns can have a favorable impact on landscape diversity, formation, and protection.

Broadcast burning alters the biota of a landscape. The immediate effect of a forest fire is a decrease in diversity. This negative impact associated with broadcast burning, however, is only temporary. Cycles of burning will allow the landscape to gradually increase in diversity. The time required for this change is dependent on the intensity, frequency, timing, and size of the controlled burns. After a few cycles, however, diversity increases. The adaptation to fire has shaped many of Earth's landscapes.

[[File:SwiddenFire6.jpg|thumb|A swidden fire, an example of a controlled burn]]
In addition to fostering diversity, controlled burns have helped change landscapes. These changes can range from grasslands to woodlands, from prairies or forest-steppes, to scrubland to forest. Whatever the case, these transformations increase diversity and engender landscapes more suitable to human needs, creating patches rich in utilitarian and natural resources.&lt;ref name=balee2 /&gt;

In addition to increasing diversity of landscapes, broadcast burning can militate against catastrophic wildfires. Forest fires gained a negative connotation because of cultural references to uncontrolled fires that take lives and destroy homes and properties. Controlled burns can decrease the risk of wildfires through the regular burning of undergrowth that would otherwise fuel rampant burning. Broadcast burning has helped to fireproof landscapes by burning off undergrowth and using up potential fuel, leaving little or no chance for a wildfire to be sparked by lightning.&lt;ref name=Balee1 /&gt;

Of all of the mechanisms of human-mediated disturbances, anthropogenic fire has become one of great interest to ecologists, geographers, soil scientists, and anthropologists alike. By studying the effects of anthropogenic fires, anthropologists have been able to identify landscape uses and requirements of past cultures. Ecologists became interested in the study of anthropogenic fire as to utilize methods from previous cultures to develop policies for regular burning. Geographers and soil scientists are interested in the utility of anthropic soils caused by burning in the past. The interest in anthropogenic fire came about in the wake of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. This time period included a mass migration from rural to urban areas, which decreased controlled burning in the countryside. This led to an increase in the frequency and strength of wildfires, thus initiating a need to develop proper prevention methods.&lt;ref name="Kenzer, M. S. 1985"/&gt; Historical ecology focuses on the impact on landscapes through human-mediated disturbances, once such being anthropogenic fire. It is a fusion of ecological, geographical, anthropological, and pedological interests.

===Biological invasions===
[[File:Lymantria dispar MHNT Chenille.jpg|thumb|''Lymantria dispar'']]
Biological invasions are composed of exotic biota that enter a landscape and replace species with which they share similarities in structure and ecological function. Because they multiply and grow quickly, invasive species can eliminate or greatly reduce existing flora and fauna by various mechanisms, such as direct competitive exclusion. Invasive species typically spread at a faster rate when they have no natural predators or when they fill an empty niche. These invasions often occur in a historical context and are classified as a type of human-mediated disturbance called human-mediated invasions.

Invasive species can be transported intentionally or accidentally. Many invasive species originate in shipping areas from where they are unintentionally transported to their new location. Sometimes human populations intentionally introduce species into new landscapes to serve various purposes, ranging from decoration to erosion control. These species can later become invasive and dramatically modify the landscape. It is important to note that not all exotic species are invasive; in fact, the majority of newly introduced species never become invasive.&lt;ref name=balee2 /&gt; Humans have on their migrations through the ages taken along plants of agricultural and medicinal value, so that the modern distribution of such favored species is a clear mapping of the routes they have traveled and the places they have settled.

One example of an invasive species that has had a significant impact on the landscape is the [[gypsy moth]] (''Lymantria dispar''). The foliage-feeding gypsy moth is originally from temperate [[Eurasia]]; it was intentionally brought to the United States by an [[entomologist]] in 1869. Many specimens escaped from captivity and have since changed the ecology of deciduous and coniferous forests in North America by defoliation. This has led not only to the loss of wildlife habitat, but also other forest services, such as carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling. After its initial introduction, the continued accidental transport of its larvae across North America has contributed to its population explosion.&lt;ref&gt;Tobin, P.C. and A.M. Liebhold. "Gypsy Moth." pp. 238-241 in: D. Simberloff and M. Rejmanek, eds., ''Encyclopedia of Biological Invasions'', University of California Press, Berkeley, California&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of the medium of introduction, biological invasions have a considerable effect on the landscape. The goal of eliminating invasive species is not new; Plato wrote about the benefits of biotic and landscape diversity centuries ago. However, the notion of eliminating invasive species is difficult to define because there is no canonical length of time that a species must exist in a specific environment until it is no longer classified as invasive. European forestry defines plants as being archaeotypes if they existed in Europe before 1500 and neophytes if they arrived after 1500. This classification is still arbitrary and some species have unknown origins while others have become such key components of their landscape that they are best understood as keystone species. As a result, their removal would have an enormous impact on the landscape, but not necessarily cause a return to conditions that existed before the invasion.

===Epidemic disease===
[[File:San tribesman.jpg|thumb|A San Tribesman: Those living in dry climates have fewer intestinal parasites.]]
A clear relationship between nature and people is expressed through human disease. Infectious disease can thus be seen as another example of human-mediated disturbance as humans are [[Host (biology)|hosts]] for infectious diseases. Historically, evidence of epidemic diseases is associated with the beginnings of agriculture and sedentary communities. Previously, human populations were too small and mobile for most infections to become established as [[chronic diseases]]. Permanent settlements, due to agriculture, allowed for more inter-community interaction, enabling infections to develop as specifically human pathogens.&lt;ref name="Newson, L.A. 1998 pp 42-63"&gt;Newson, L.A. (1998) "A historical-ecological perspective on epidemic disease." In W. Balee (Ed.). ''Advances in historical ecology'' (pp 42-63). New York: Columbia University Press. {{ISBN|0-231-10633-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holistic and interdisciplinary approaches to the study of human disease have revealed a reciprocal relationship between humans and parasites. The variety of parasites found within the human body often reflects the diversity of the environment in which that individual resides. For instance, Bushmen and Australian [[Australian Aborigines|Aborigines]] have half as many intestinal parasites as African and Malaysian hunter-gatherers living in a species-rich tropical rainforest. Infectious diseases can be either chronic or acute, and epidemic or endemic, impacting the population in any given community to different extents. Thus, human-mediated disturbance can either increase or decrease species diversity in a landscape, causing a corresponding change in [[pathogenic diversity]].&lt;ref name="Newson, L.A. 1998 pp 42-63"/&gt;

===Transformation of waterways===
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Amazonia5.jpg |thumb|Satellite view of anthropogenic transformation of [[Amazon basin]] waterways near the city of Manaus, Brazil along the north bank of the Negro River, 11 miles (18 km) above its confluence with the Amazon]] --&gt;

Historical ecologists postulate that landscape transformations have occurred throughout history, even before the dawn of [[western culture|western civilization]]. Human-mediated disturbances are predated by soil [[erosion]] and animals damming waterways which contributed to waterway transformations. [[Landscape]]s, in turn, were altered by waterway transformation.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, M. (1992). ''So shall you reap''. New York: Doubleday.&lt;/ref&gt; Historical ecology views the effects of human-mediated disturbances on waterway transformation as both subtle and drastic occurrences. Waterways have been modified by humans through the building of irrigation canals, expanding or narrowing waterways, and multiple other adjustments done for [[agricultural]] or transportation usage.

The evidence for past and present agricultural use of [[wetlands]] in [[Mesoamerica]] suggests an evolutionary sequence of landscape and [[waterway]] alteration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Surian | first1 = N. | last2 = Rinaldi | first2 = M. | year = 2003 | title = Morphological response to river engineering and management in alluvial channels in Italy | journal = Geomorphology | volume = 50 | issue = | pages = 307–326 | doi=10.1016/s0169-555x(02)00219-2| bibcode = 2003Geomo..50..307S }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Pre-Columbian]], indigenous agriculturalists developed capabilities with which to raise crops under a wide range of ecological conditions, giving rise to a multiplicity of altered, cultivated landscapes. The effects of waterway transformation were particularly evident in Mesoamerica, where agricultural practices ranged from swiddening to multicropped hydraulically transformed wetlands.&lt;ref&gt;Whitmore, T. M. &amp; Turner, B. L. II. (1992). "Landscapes of a cultivation in Mesoamerica on the eve of the conquest."

[[File:Manaus-Amazon-NASA.jpg|thumb|right|[[Manaus]], the largest city on the Amazon, as seen from a [[NASA]] satellite image, surrounded by the muddy Amazon River and the dark Rio Negro]]

Historical ecologists view the [[Amazon basin]] landscape as cultural and embodying social labor. The [[Amazon River]] has been altered by the local population for crop growth and water transportation. Previous research failed to account for human interaction with the Amazon landscape. Recent research, however, has demonstrated that the landscape has been manipulated by its [[indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] population over time. The continual, natural shifting of rivers, however, often masked the human disturbances in the course of rivers. As a result, the indigenous populations in the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] are often overlooked for their ability to alter the land and the river.&lt;ref name=Raffles&gt;Raffles, H. The Amazon: a natural landscape?
http://www.india-seminar.com/2000/486/486%20raffles.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[waterway]] transformation has been successfully identified in the Amazon landscape. Clark Erickson observes that pre-Hispanic [[savanna]] peoples of the [[Bolivia]]n Amazon built an [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] landscape through the construction of raised fields, large settlement mounds, and earthen causeways. Erickson, on the basis of location, form, patterning, associations and ethnographic analogy, identified a particular form of earthwork, the zigzag structure, as fish [[weir]]s in the savanna of [[Baures]], Bolivia. The artificial zigzag structures were raised from the adjacent savanna and served as a means to harvest the fish who used them to migrate and spawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Erickson | first1 = C. L. | year = 2000 | title = An artificial landscape-scale fishery in the Bolivian Amazon | url = http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/%7Ecerickso/fishweir/articles/Nature1.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Nature | volume = 408 | issue = | pages = 190–193 | bibcode = 2000Natur.408..190E | doi = 10.1038/35041555 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further evidence of waterway transformation is found in [[Igarapé]] [[Guariba]] in Brazil. It is an area in the Amazon basin where people have intervened in nature to change rivers and streams with dramatic results. Researcher Hugh Raffles notes that British [[naturalists]] [[Henry Walter Bates]] and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] noted waterway transformation as they sailed through a canal close to the town of Igarapé-Miri in 1848. Archival materials identifies that it had been dug out by slaves. In his studies he notes an abundance of documentary and anecdotal evidence which supports landscape transformation by the manipulation of waterways. Transformation continues in more recent times as noted when in 1961, a group of villagers from Igarapé Guariba cut a canal about two miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) long across fields thick with tall [[papyrus]] grass and into dense tropical rain forest. The narrow canal and the stream that flowed into it have since formed a full-fledged river more than six hundred yards wide at its mouth, and the landscape in this part of the northern Brazilian state of [[Amapá]] was dramatically transformed.&lt;ref name=Raffles/&gt;

In general, with an increase in global population growth, comes an increase in the [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] transformation of waterways. The [[Sumer]]ians had created extensive irrigations by 4000 BC. As the population increased in the 3,000 years of agriculture, the ditches and canals increased in number. By the early 1900s, ditching, dredging, and diking had become common practice. This led to an increase in [[erosion]] which impacted the landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;Siemens, A. H. (1983, April). "Wetland agriculture in Pre-Hispanic [[Mesoamerica]]." ''Geographical Review'', 73 (2), 166-181 {{jstor|214642}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human activities have affected the natural role of rivers and its communal value. These changes in waterways have impacted the floodplains, natural tidal patterns, and the surrounding land.&lt;ref&gt;Carlisle, B. &amp; Smith, T. (2007, October 15). "Reviving a river." Retrieved March 28, 2008, from Massachusetts Wetlands Restoration Program Web site: http://www.mass.gov/czm/coastlines/2006/ebbflow/river.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance of understanding such transformation is it provides a more accurate understanding to long-standing popular and academic insights of the Amazon, as well as other [[ecological]] settings, as places where [[indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] populations have dealt with the forces of [[nature]]. Ecological landscapes have been portrayed as an [[environment (biophysical)|environment]], not a [[society]]. Recent studies supported by historical ecologists, however, understand that ecological landscape like the Amazon are biocultural, rather than simply natural and provide for a greater understanding of [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] transformation of both [[waterways]] and [[landscapes]].&lt;ref name=Raffles/&gt;

===Soil management===

[[Soil management]], or direct human interaction with the soil, is another mechanism of anthropogenic change studied by historical ecologists. Soil management can take place through rearranging soils, altering drainage patterns, and building large earthen formations. Consistent with the basic premises of historical ecology, it is recognized that anthropogenic soil management practices can have both positive and negative effects on local [[biodiversity]]. Some agricultural practices have led to organically and chemically impoverished soils. In the North American Midwest, industrial agriculture has led to a loss in [[topsoil]]. Salinization of the [[Euphrates River]] has occurred due to ancient Mesopotamian irrigation, and detrimental amounts of zinc have been deposited in the New Caliber River of Nigeria.&lt;ref name=Erickson&gt;Erickson, C. &amp; Balée, W. (2006). In time and complexity in historical ecology: Studies in the neotropical lowlands (pp 7-12). New York: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere, soil management practices may not have any effect on soil fertility. The iconic mounds of the Hopewell Indians built in the Ohio River valley likely served a religious or ceremonial purpose, and show little evidence of changing soil fertility in the landscape.

The case of soil management in the Neotropics (including the Amazon) is a classic example of beneficial results of human-mediated disturbance. In this area, prehistoric peoples altered the texture and chemical composition of natural soils. The altered black and brown earths, known as Amazon Dark Earths, or [[Terra preta]], are actually much more fertile than unaltered surrounding soils.&lt;ref name=Erickson/&gt; Furthermore, the increased soil fertility improves the results of agriculture. Terra preta is characterized by the presence of [[charcoal]] in high concentrations, along with pottery shards and organic residues from plants, animal bones, and feces. It is also shows increased levels of nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, zinc, and manganese; along with high levels of microorganic activity.&lt;ref&gt;Terra preta web site. School of geosciences and geography (Universität Bayreuth). Retrieved on April 5, 2008, from {{cite web |url=http://www.geo.uni-bayreuth.de/bodenkunde/terra_preta/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051025170240/http://www.geo.uni-bayreuth.de/bodenkunde/terra_preta/ |archivedate=2005-10-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now accepted that these soils are a product of a labor-intensive technique termed [[slash-and-char]]. In contrast to the commonly known [[slash-and-burn]] technique, this uses a lower temperature burn that produces more charcoal than ashes. Research shows these soils were created by human activity between 9000 and 2500 years ago. Contemporary local farmers actively seek out and sell this dark earth, which covers around 10% of the Amazon basin. Harvesting Terra preta does not deplete it however, for it has the ability to regenerate at the rate of one centimeter per year by sequestering more carbon.&lt;ref name=sington&gt;Sington, D. (Director) (2002). Horizon: The secret of El Dorado [Videotape]. BBC Horizon Series. London: Dox Productions.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DirkvdM santa fe scorched.jpg|thumb|Scorched land resulting from slash-and-burn agriculture]]
Interest in and the study of Amazon dark earths was advanced with the work of Wim Sombroek. Sombroek's interest in soil fertility came from his childhood. He was born in the Netherlands and lived through the Dutch famine of 1944. His family subsided on a small plot of land that had been maintained and improved for generations. Sombroek's father, in turn, improved the land by sowing it with the ash and cinders from their home. Sombroek came across Terra preta in the 1950s and it reminded him of the soil from his childhood, inspiring him to study it further. Soil biologist from the University of Kansas William W. Woods is also a major figure in Terra preta research. Woods has made several key discoveries and his comprehensive bibliography on the subject doubles in size every decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Marris | first1 = E. | year = 2006 | title = Putting the Carbon back: Black is the new green | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 442 | issue = | pages = 624–626 | doi=10.1038/442624a | pmid=16900176| bibcode = 2006Natur.442..624M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globally, forests are well known for having greater biodiversity than nearby savannas or grasslands. Thus, the creation of ‘forest islands’ in multiple locations can be considered a positive result of human activity. This is evident in the otherwise uniform savannas of Guinea and central Brazil that are punctured by scattered clumps of trees.&lt;ref&gt;Fairhead, J. &amp; Leach, M. (1996). ''Misreading the African landscape: Society and ecology in a forest-savanna mosaic.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  These clumps are the result of generations of intense resource management. Earth works and mounds formed by humans, such as the Ibibate mound complex in the Llanos de Mojos in Bolivia, are examples of built environments that have undergone landscape transformation and provide habitats for a greater number of species than the surrounding wetland areas.&lt;ref name=sington/&gt;  The forest islands in the Bolivian Amazon not only increase the local plant species diversity, but also enhance subsistence possibilities for the local people.

==Applied historical ecology==

Historical ecology involves an understanding of multiple fields of study such as archaeology and cultural history as well as ecological processes, species diversity, natural variability, and the impact of human-mediated disturbances. Having a broad understanding of landscapes allows historical ecology to be applied to various disciplines.   Studying past relationships between humans and landscapes can successfully aid land managers by helping develop holistic, environmentally rational, and historically accurate plans of action. As summarized in the postulates of historical ecology, humans play significant roles in the creation and destruction of landscapes as well as in ecosystem function. Through experience, many indigenous societies learned how to effectively alter their landscapes and biotic distributions. Modern societies, seeking to curtail the magnitude of their effects on the landscape, can use historical ecology to promote sustainability by learning from the past. Farmers in the Amazon region, for example, now utilize nutrient-rich terra preta to increase crop yields&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = German | first1 = L.A. | year = 2003 | title = Historical contingencies in the coevolution of environment and livelihood: contributions to the debate on Amazon Black Earth | url = http://www.soils.wisc.edu/soils/courses/875/14Exemplary(A).pdf | format = PDF | journal = Geoderma | volume = 111 | issue = | pages = 307–331 | doi=10.1016/s0016-7061(02)00270-7 | bibcode=2003Geode.111..307G}}&lt;/ref&gt; much like the indigenous societies that lived long before them.

Historical ecology can also aid in the goals of other fields of study. [[Conservation biology]] recognizes different types of land management processes, each attempting to maintain the landscape and biota in their present form. [[Restoration ecology]] restores sites to former function, structure, and components of biological diversity through active modification of the landscapes. Reclamation deals with shifting a degraded ecosystem back toward a higher value or use, but not necessarily to its original state. Replacement of an ecosystem would create an entirely new one. Revegetation involves new additions of biota into a landscape, not limited to the original inhabitants of an area.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, M.L., Gibbs, J.P. (2006) ''Fundamentals of Conservation Biology''. 3rd ed. (pp 252-276). Malden, Massachusetts, Wiley-Blackwell. {{ISBN|978-1-4051-3545-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each method can be enriched by the application of historical ecology and the past knowledge it supplies. The interdisciplinary nature of historical ecology would permit conservation biologists to create more effective and efficient landscape improvements. Reclamation and revegetation can use a historical perspective to determine what biota will be able to sustain large populations without threatening native biota of the landscape.

A tropical forest in particular needs to be studied extensively because it is a highly diverse, heterogeneous setting. Historical ecology can use archaeological sites within this setting to study past successes and failures of indigenous peoples.  The use of swidden fires in Laos is an example of historical ecology as used by current land managers in policy-making. Swidden fires were originally considered a source of habitat degradation. This conclusion led the Laos government to discourage farmers from using swidden fires as a farming technique. However, recent research has found that swidden fires were practiced historically in Laos and were not, in fact, the source of degradation. Similar research revealed that habitat degradation originated from a population increase after the Vietnam War. The greater volume of people compelled the government to put pressure on farmers for increased agricultural production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robichaud | first1 = W. G. | last2 = Sinclair | first2 = A. R.E. | last3 = Odarkor-Lanquaye | first3 = N. | last4 = Klinkenberg | first4 = B. | year = 2009 | title = Stable Forest Cover Under Increasing Populations of Swidden Cultivators in Central Laos: the Roles of Intrinsic Culture and Extrinsic Wildlife Trade | url = http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss1/art33/ | journal = Ecology and Society | volume = 14 | issue = 1| page = 33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Land managers no longer automatically eliminate the use of swidden fires, but rather the number of swidden fires that are set for government-sponsored agricultural purposes.

The San Francisco Estuary Institute also uses historical ecology to study human impacts on the California landscape to guide environmental management.&lt;ref&gt;Grossinger, R.M., Striplen, C.J., Brewster, E., Beller, E.E., Askevold, R. 2007. "Historical landscape ecology of an urbanized California valley: wetlands and woodlands in the Santa Clara Valley."

By using historical data such as maps, charts, and aerial photographs, researchers were able to trace habitat change to built structures that had negatively altered the tidal flow into the estuaries dating from the early 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dyke | first1 = E.V. | last2 = Wasson | first2 = K. | year = 2005 | title = Historical Ecology of a Central California Estuary: 150 Years of Habitat Change | url = http://www.elkhornslough.org | journal = Estuaries | volume = 28 | issue = 2| pages = 173–189 | doi=10.1007/bf02732853}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study further suggested using techniques that "imitate the complex structure of natural tidal wetlands and maintain connectivity with intact wetland habitats as well as with adjoining subtidal and upland habitats."

[[Roller coaster]] amusement rides have origins back to ice slides constructed in 18th-century [[Russia]]. Early technology featured sleds or wheeled carts that were sent down hills of snow reinforced by wooden supports. The technology evolved in the 19th century to feature [[Track (rail transport)|railroad track]] using wheeled cars that were securely locked to the track. Newer innovations emerged in the early 20th century with side friction and underfriction technologies to allow for greater speeds and sharper turns. By the mid-to-late 20th century, these elements intensified with the introduction of steel roller coaster designs and the ability for them to invert riders.

==History==

===Beginnings===
The world's oldest roller coasters descended from the "[[Russian Mountains]]," which were specially constructed hills of snow &lt;ref&gt;Coker, Robert (2002). ''Roller Coasters: A Thrill Seeker's Guide to the Ultimate Scream Machines'', Metrobooks, New York. {{ISBN|1586631721}}. pg 14&lt;/ref&gt; located in the gardens of  palaces around the Russian capital, [[Saint Petersburg]], in the 18th century. This attraction  was called a ''Katalnaya Gorka'' or "sliding mountain" in Russian.  The slides were built to a height of between {{convert|70|ft|m|0}} and {{convert|80|ft|m|0}}, had  a 50 degree drop, and were reinforced by wooden supports.  Sometimes wheeled carts were used instead of sleds.  These slides became popular with the Russian upper class, and with  [[Catherine II of Russia]] herself, who had such mountains built in the gardens of the [[Oranienbaum Palace]] near St. Petersburg, with a pavilion next to it for drinking tea after the sliding.  "Russian mountains" remains the term for roller coasters in many languages, such as Spanish (''[[:es:Montaña rusa|la montaña rusa]]''), Italian (''[[:it:Montagne russe|montagne russe]]''), and French (''[[:fr:Montagnes russes|les montagnes russes]]''). Ironically, the Russian term for roller coaster, ''[[:ru:американские горки|американские горки]]'' (amerikanskie gorki), translates literally as "American mountains."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rambler.ru/dict/new-enru/00/12/99.shtml  Rambler New English-Russian Dictionary: "American"]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Promenades Aeriennes Jardin Baujon.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Promenades-Aeriennes in Paris (1817).]]
Russian soldiers occupying Paris from 1815 through 1816, after the defeat of [[Napoleon]] at Waterloo, may have introduced the Russian amusement of sledding down steep hills.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Valérie RANSON-ENGUIALE, « Promenades aériennes », Histoire par l'image [en ligne], consulté le 28 Mai 2017. URL : http://www.histoire-image.org/etudes/promenades-aeriennes &lt;/ref&gt; In July 1817, a French banker named Nicolas Beaujon opened the Parc Beaujon, an amusement park on the [[Champs Elysees]]. Its most famous feature was the ''Promenades Aériennes'' or "Aerial Strolls." &lt;ref&gt;Fierro, Alfred, ''Histoire et Dictionnaire de Paris'', (1996). Robert Laffont, page 1051. &lt;/ref&gt; It featured wheeled cars securely locked to the track, guide rails to keep them on course, and higher speeds. &lt;ref name=Bennett&gt;David Bennett (1998). ''Roller Coaster: Wooden and Steel Coasters, Twisters and Corkscrews''.  Edison, New Jersey: Chartwell Books. 9. {{ISBN|0-7865-0885-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The three-wheel carts were towed to the top of a tower,  and then released to descend two curving tracks on either side.  King [[Louis XVIII of France]] came to see the park, but it is not recorded if he tried the ride. Before long there were seven similar rides in Paris: ''Les Montagnes françaises'' (The French Mountains), ''le Delta'', ''les Montagnes de Belleville'' (The Mountains of Belleville),  ''les Montagnes américaines'' (the American Mountains), ''Les Montages lilliputiennes'', (The miniature mountains), ''Les Montagnes susses'' (The Swiss mountains)  and ''Les Montagnes égyptiennes'' (The Egyptian mountains).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In the beginning, these attractions were primarily for the upper classes. In 1845 a new amusement park opened in Copenhagen, [[Tivoli Gardens|Tivoli]], which was designed for the middle class. These new parks featured roller coasters as permanent attractions. The first permanent loop track was probably also built in Paris from an English design in 1846, with a single-person wheeled sled running through a 13-foot (4 m) diameter vertical loop. These early single loop designs were called Centrifugal Railways.  In 1887, a French entrepreneur, [[Joseph Oller]], the owner of the [[Moulin Rouge]] music  hall,  built ''Les Montagnes Russes à Belleville'' (''The Russian Mountains of Belleville'')  a permanent  roller coaster with a length of two hundred meters in the form of a double-eight, later enlarged to four figure-eight-shaped loops.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

[[Image:Mount Pisgah plane looking up.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Mount Pisgah with the [[Mauch Chunk Switchback Railway]].]]

===Scenic railways===
In the 1850s, a mining company in [[Summit Hill, Pennsylvania]], constructed the [[Mauch Chunk Switchback Railway|Mauch Chunk]] [[gravity railroad]], a brakeman-controlled, 8.7-mile (14&amp;nbsp;km) downhill track used to deliver coal to Mauch Chunk (now known as [[Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania|Jim Thorpe]]), [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ultimaterollercoaster.com/coasters/history/start/america.shtml Roller Coaster History: Early Years In America]. Retrieved 26 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; By 1872, the "Gravity Road" (as it became known) was selling rides to thrill seekers. Railway companies used similar tracks to provide amusement on days when ridership was low.
[[Image:Thompsons Switchback Railway 1884.jpg|thumb|150px|Thompson's [[Switchback Railway]], 1884.]] 

Using this idea as a basis, [[LaMarcus Adna Thompson]] began work on a gravity [[Switchback Railway]] that opened at [[Coney Island]] in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]] in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Sheedy |title= Icons&amp;nbsp;— In the Beginning...

"Scenic Railways" were soon found in amusement parks across the county,&lt;ref name="Urbanowicz"/&gt; with [[Frederick Ingersoll]]'s construction company building many of them in the first two decades of the 20th century.

===Growing popularity and innovations===
[[File:Coneyisland1906.jpg|thumb|[[Loop the Loop (Coney Island)|Loop the Loop]], an early looping roller coaster at Coney Island, 1906]]
As it grew in popularity, experimentation in coaster dynamics took off. In the 1880s the concept of a vertical loop was again explored by [[Lina Beecher]], and in 1895 the concept came into fruition with the ''[[Flip Flap Railway]]'', located at [[Sea Lion Park]] in Brooklyn, and shortly afterward with ''[[Loop the Loop (Olentangy Park)|Loop the Loop]]'' at [[Olentangy Park]] near [[Columbus, Ohio]] as well as similar coasters in [[Loop the Loop (Young's Million Dollar Pier)|Atlantic City]] and [[Loop the Loop (Coney Island)|Coney Island]]. The rides were incredibly dangerous, and many passengers suffered [[Whiplash (medicine)|whiplash]]. Both were soon dismantled, and looping coasters had to wait for over a half century before making a reappearance.

By 1919, the first [[underfriction]] roller coaster had been developed by [[John Miller (entrepreneur)|John Miller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patimg2.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=01319888&amp;PageNum=&amp;Rtype=&amp;SectionNum=&amp;idkey=NONE&amp;Input=View+first+page|title=Patent Images|website=patimg2.uspto.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, roller coasters spread to amusement parks all around the world. Perhaps the best known historical roller coaster, ''[[Coney Island Cyclone|The Cyclone]]'', was opened at [[Coney Island]] in 1927. Like ''The Cyclone'', all early roller coasters were made of wood. Many old [[wooden roller coaster]]s are still operational, at parks such as [[Kennywood]] near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and [[Pleasure Beach Blackpool]], England. The oldest operating roller coaster is ''[[Leap-The-Dips]]'' at [[Lakemont Park]] in Pennsylvania, a [[side friction roller coaster]] built in 1902. The oldest wooden roller coaster in the [[United Kingdom]] is the ''Scenic Railway'' at [[Dreamland Margate|Dreamland]] Amusement Park in [[Margate]], [[Kent]] and features a system where the brakeman rides the car with wheels. It was severely damaged by fire on April 7, 2008, but was subsequently restored and reopened to the public in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/7335519.stm Retrieved on 8th April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; ''Scenic Railway'' at [[Melbourne's Luna Park]] built in 1912, is the world's oldest continually-operating roller coaster, and it also still features a system where the brakeman rides the car with wheels. One of only 13 remaining examples of John Miller's work worldwide is the wooden roller coaster at Lagoon in Utah.  The coaster opened in 1921 and is the 6th oldest coaster in the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aceonline.org/CoasterAwards/details.aspx?id=46&lt;/ref&gt;

The Great Depression marked the end of the golden age of roller coasters, as amusement parks generally went into a decline that resulted in less demand for new coasters. This lasted until 1972, when ''[[Racer (Kings Island)|The Racer]]'' opened at [[Kings Island]] amusement park located in what was then a part of [[Deerfield Township, Warren County, Ohio|Deerfield Township]] in [[Warren County, Ohio]]. Designed by [[John C. Allen]], the instant success of ''The Racer'' helped to ignite a renaissance for roller coasters, reviving worldwide interest throughout the industry.

===The rise of steel===
[[Image:MatterhornBobsled2000 wb.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Matterhorn Bobsleds]], the world's first tubular [[steel roller coaster]].]]
In 1959, the [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]] theme park introduced a new design breakthrough in roller coasters with the ''[[Matterhorn Bobsleds]]''. This was the first roller coaster to use a tubular [[Steel roller coaster|steel track]]. Unlike conventional wooden rails, which are generally formed using steel strips mounted on laminated wood, tubular steel can be bent in any direction, which allows designers to incorporate loops, corkscrews, and many other maneuvers into their designs. Most modern roller coasters are made of steel, although wooden roller coasters are still being built along with hybrids of steel and wood.

In 1975 the first modern-day roller coaster to perform an inverting element opened: [[Corkscrew (Silverwood)|Corkscrew]], located at [[Knott's Berry Farm]] in [[Buena Park, California|Buena Park]], [[California]]. In 1976 the vertical loop made a permanent comeback with the [[The New Revolution (roller coaster)|Great American Revolution]] at [[Six Flags Magic Mountain|Magic Mountain]] in [[Valencia, California|Valencia]], California.

==Timeline of notable roller coasters==
{{prose|date=November 2018}}
The roller coasters mentioned here are significant for their role in the amusement industry. They were notable for specific reasons, including:

* First roller coaster of a specific kind, style, manufacturing material or unique technology; ground-breaking
* First time a particular record-breaking threshold was crossed
* Historical significance

'''Incarceration prevention''' refers to a variety of methods aimed at reducing prison populations and costs while fostering enhanced social structures. Due to the nature of [[incarceration in the United States]] today caused by issues leading to increased incarceration rates, there are methods aimed at preventing the incarceration of at-risk populations.

== Prison population and cost to society==

{{See also|United States incarceration rate}}

Between 1998 and 2010, prison populations in the United States rose dramatically. This resulted in overcrowded facilities; increased expense to taxpayers; and potential loss of public funding for other community safety activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Examining growth in the federal prison population, 1998 to 2010|url=http://www.urban.org/UploadedPDF/412720-Examining-Growth-in-the-Federal-Prison-Population.pdf|year=2012|publisher=Urban Institute|location=Washington, D.C.|author=Kamala Kane|author2=Barbara Parthasarathy|accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1982 and 2007, corrections expenditures increased by over 250 percent and in 2007 expenditure was over $74 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kyckelhahn|first=Tracey|title=Justice Expenditures and  Employment, FY 1982-2007|date=December 2011|publisher=Bureau of Justice Statistics|url=http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/jee8207st.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the number of youths in detention facilities was 61,423.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Center for Juvenile Justice|url=http://www.ojjdp.gov/ojstatbb/ezacjrp/asp/selection.asp|publisher=Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP), Office of Justice Programs, U.S. Department of Justice.|accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 2012, approximately 2,228,400 individuals were incarcerated in jails and prisons, about 4,781,300 individuals were under some form of community supervision (such as probation or parole), and a total of approximately 6,937,600 individuals were under some form of correctional supervision (1 in 35 adults).&lt;ref name="bjs"&gt;{{cite web|title = Correctional Populations in the United States, 2012|url = http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cpus12.pdf|work = Office of Justice Programs Bureau of Justice Statistics Bulletin|publisher = U.S. Department of Justice|accessdate = 24 February 2014|author = Lauren Glaze|author2 = Erinn Herberman}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average cost of the incarceration of an individual in 2012 was approximately $31,286 per year with a range of $14,603 to $60,076.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Price of Prisons: What Incarceration Costs Taxpayers|date=January 2012|publisher=The VERA Institute of Justice Center on Sentencing and Corrections|location=New York|url=http://www.vera.org/sites/default/files/resources/downloads/Price_of_Prisons_updated_version_072512.pdf|author=Christian Henrichson|author2=Ruth Delaney|accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Economic Interest Convergence in Downsizing Imprisonment|ssrn = 2608698|publisher = Social Science Research Network|date = 2014-01-01|location = Rochester, NY|last = SpearIt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of October 2015, the United States has the second highest incarceration rate in the world with 698 per 100,000 population.&lt;ref name=Walmsley2015&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walmsley|first1=Roy|title=World Prison Population List (Eleventh Edition)|url=http://www.prisonstudies.org/sites/default/files/resources/downloads/world_prison_population_list_11th_edition_0.pdf|website=World Prison Brief|publisher=Institute For Criminal Policy Research|accessdate=25 November 2017|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to other locations, 55% of countries and territories have prison rates lower than 155 per 100,000 population.&lt;ref name=Walmsley2015 /&gt; The average cost of incarceration rose to $31,977.65 in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Federal Bureau of Prisons|first1=Justice Department|title=Annual Determination of Average Cost of Incarceration|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/07/19/2016-17040/annual-determination-of-average-cost-of-incarceration|website=Federal Register|accessdate=25 November 2017|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Factors contributing to incarceration rates==

=== Substance use disorder prevention or treatment ===

Between 1980 and 2005, the number of inmates incarcerated for drug-related crimes increased by 1,000 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stemen|first=Don|title=Reconsidering Incarceration: New Directions for Reducing Crime|date=January 2007|publisher=VERA Institute of Justice Center on Sentencing and Corrections|pages=8|url=http://www.vera.org/sites/default/files/resources/downloads/veraincarc_vFW2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, sixty-five percent of inmates reported a substance addiction or dependence issue.&lt;ref name = casa&gt;{{cite book|title=Shoveling Up II: The Impact of Substance Abuse on Federal, State and Local Budgets|date=May 2009|publisher=The National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University|location=New York, NY|url=http://www.casacolumbia.org/modal_forms/nojs/webform/161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seventy-eight percent of violent crimes and eighty-three percent of property crimes involved drugs.&lt;ref name=casa /&gt; A greater amount of money is spent on incarceration than on prevention and treatment, despite research showing that treating drug addictions is more cost-effective than incarceration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wachendorfer|first=Allan|title=Casualties of the Drug War|journal=Senior Honors Thesis|year=2013|issue=Paper 361|url=http://commons.emich.edu/honors/361}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]], a full year of drug treatment costs approximately $4,700 compared to over $30,000 for a year of imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is drug addiction treatment worth its cost?|url=http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/principles-drug-addiction-treatment-research-based-guide-third-edition/frequently-asked-questions/drug-addiction-treatment-worth-its-cost|publisher=National Institute on Drug Abuse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mental health access/treatment ===

According to statistics produced by the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] in September 2006, over 45% of federal prisoners, 56% of state prisoners, and 64% of jail inmates are [[Mentally ill prisoners in the United States|diagnosed with mental health problems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bureau of Justice Statistics Special Report: Mental Health Problems of Prison  and Jail Inmates|date=September 2006|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice Office of Justice Programs|url=http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/mhppji.pdf|author=Doris James|author2=Lauren Glaze|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests a direct correlation between a decrease in mental health services and facilities and an increase in mental health diagnoses in the prison system. A decrease in mental health funding has taken place on both the state and federal level, especially in changes in block grant funding as part of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1981. The statewide support for mental health services has also seen significant cuts and has barely accounted for annual inflation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Funding for Mental Health Services and Programs|url=//www.bazelon.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=GzmAbAweikQ%3D&amp;tabid=436|publisher=Judge David L. Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall shift from institution-based care to a community-based care model was one that many mental health advocates welcomed; however, the funding appropriated to support such programs was much less than initial estimates and has had a significant impact on the ability of the community care based model to be successful in providing adequate mental health treatment to those in need.&lt;ref&gt;NAMI - State Mental Health Cuts : A National Crisis http://www.nami.org/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm?ContentFileID=126233&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education ===

{{See also|School-to-prison pipeline}}

68% of state prison inmates did not receive a high school diploma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bureau of Justice Statistics Special Report: Education and Correctional Populations|date=January 2003|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice Office of Justice Programs|url=http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/ecp.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research indicates that schooling significantly reduces criminal activity. A significant portion of the effect of education on crime can be attributed to an increase in wages associated with schooling, suggesting that an increased level of education funding will result in decreased criminal activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The E®ect of Education on Crime: Evidence from Prison Inmates, Arrests, and Self-Reports|date=October 2003|url=http://emlab.berkeley.edu/~moretti/lm46.pdf|author=Lance Lochner|author2=Enrico Moretti|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Factors involving race ===

{{see also|Race and the War on Drugs|Stop-and-frisk in New York City|Arizona SB 1070|Race and crime in the United States}}

There are many factors that have direct connections with the rises in the incarcerated population, many of which relate to structural and societal biases that exist in America today. As it relates directly to race, the practice of racial profiling regards policies and personal biases that target minority racial groups and contribute to a greater proportion of minorities being incarcerated compared to the general population. Currently, over sixty percent of inmates in the United States are people of color.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/race/news/2012/03/13/11351/the-top-10-most-startling-facts-about-people-of-color-and-criminal-justice-in-the-united-states/&lt;/ref&gt; These practices have existed in the American Criminal Justice system for decades and although may have gained attention in recent years, still find ways to increase the likelihood of certain demographic groups receiving negative attention from the likes of law enforcement.

=== The war on drugs and longer prison sentences ===

Beginning in the Nixon administration, the war on drugs resulted in stricter drug laws including longer prison sentences for drug use and possession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Travis|first1=Jeremy|last2=Western|first2=Bruce|last3=Redburn|first3=F. Stevens|title=The Growth of Incarceration in the United States: Exploring Causes and Consequences|date=2014|publisher=The National Academic Press|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=118–121|url=https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1026&amp;context=jj_pubs|accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that the drug offender population in federal prisons rose by 63% from 1998 to 2012 and they accounted for 52% of federal prisoners by 2012.&lt;ref name=Taxy2015&gt;{{cite web|last1=Taxy|first1=Sam|last2=Samuels|first2=Julie|last3=Adams|first3=William|title=Drug Offenders in Federal Prison: Estimates of Characteristics Based on Linked Data|url=https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/dofp12.pdf|website=Bureau of Justice Statistics|accessdate=27 November 2017|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 35% of these drug offenders were not reoffenders or had minimal criminal backgrounds.&lt;ref name=Taxy2015 /&gt;

In relation, mandatory minimum penalties have contributed to mass incarceration. The United States Sentencing Commission found that in 2016, 67.3% of offenders charged of a crime with a mandatory minimum penalty were convicted of a drug offense.&lt;ref name=USSC2017&gt;{{cite web|last1=United States Sentencing Commission|title=An Overview of Mandatory Minimum Penalties in the Federal Criminal Justice System|url=https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/research-and-publications/research-publications/2017/20170711_Mand-Min.pdf|accessdate=27 November 2017|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission also found that in 2016, the average sentence length was 110 months in prison compared to 28 months for those charged of a crime with no mandatory minimum penalty.&lt;ref name=USSC2017 /&gt;

== Incarceration prevention ==

Incarceration prevention refers to a variety of methods aimed at reducing prison populations and costs while fostering enhanced social structures for the improvement of society. Incarceration prevention can take place in any of three stages: Primary Prevention, Diversion, or Recidivism Prevention.

===Prevention===

Primary prevention is an attempt to reduce the risk of behaviors that potentially lead to incarceration. The initial stage in this model includes looking at system wide or systemic approaches that ensure people have consistent social and structural interactions.

==== Safety nets ====

Studies suggest that crime and violence are likely to be a byproduct of issues including economic inequality and poverty.&lt;ref name=worldbank&gt;{{cite book|last=Bourguignon|first=F.|title=Facets of globalization international and local dimensions of development|year=2001|publisher=The World Bank|location=Washington, DC|isbn=0-8213-4742-X|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/14014|accessdate=25 February 2014|format=print|chapter=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic theory shows how property crime and violent crimes may partly be consequences of excessive inequality and poverty.&lt;ref name=worldbank /&gt; Not only do crime rates increase with inequality, but propensity to commit crimes also increases with greater income inequality or poverty.&lt;ref name=worldbank /&gt; It follows that programs which elevate families out of poverty decrease behaviors associated with crime. National data indicates that a 10% increase in real wages lowers the crime index by 13%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stemen|first=Don|title=New Directions for Reducing Crime|journal=Federal Sentencing Reporter|date=April 2007|volume=19|issue=4|pages=221–233|doi=10.1525/fsr.2007.19.4.221|jstor=10.1525/fsr.2007.19.4.221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Youth justice ====

{{See also|School-to-prison pipeline}}

Often, primary prevention can be viewed in the context of a school or vocational program in which there is a system of disciplinary action and reactions to behavioral issues. The goal is to institute preventive measures and different methods of support (i.e., restorative justice, restorative circles, proactive circles, and peer mediation) that encourage students/youth to meet the behavioral and academic standards set before them, without instituting harsh punitive measures that disengage students from educational and social resources provided within a school environment.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

=== Diversion ===

Diversion is an attempt to circumvent incarceration and correct problem behaviors after an offense have been committed through alternatives to incarceration. This includes identifying those "most at risk" and setting in place additional supportive measures and strategies to provide opportunities for success.

In a school setting, this most often takes place after a young person has had multiple behavioral incidences within a short period of time and is at risk for more serious punitive measures. Steps for intervention may include (but are not limited to): additional counseling and support services, conflict resolution measures, peer-to-peer resolution groups, and engagement with community partners to provide additional services. The goal is to provide opportunities and support for those who show persistent behavioral issues, as they are most at-risk for future incarceration and/or legal trouble.&lt;ref&gt;EDJ Model: Secondary http://www.edjj.org/prevention/LevelsPrevention.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Deferred sentencing and jail diversion ====

Including but not limited to:
                    	
*[[Alternative sentencing|Community Service]]: Community sentence or alternative sentencing or non-custodial sentence is a collective name in criminal justice for all the different ways, in which courts can punish someone convicted of committing an offense in ways other than prison terms.
*[[Drug courts in the United States|Drug courts]]: Drug courts operate under a model that combines intensive judicial supervision, mandatory drug testing, escalating sanctions and treatment to help substance abusers break the cycle of addiction and the crime that accompanies it.
*[[Mental health court]]s: Mental health courts link offenders who would ordinarily be prison-bound to long-term community-based treatment. They rely on mental health assessments, individualized treatment plans, and ongoing judicial monitoring to address both the mental health needs of offenders and public safety concerns of communities.
*[[Domestic violence court]]s: Specialized domestic violence courts are designed to improve victim safety and enhance defendant accountability. They emerged as problem-solving courts in the 1980s and 1990s in response to frustration among victim advocates, judges and attorneys who saw the same litigants cycling through the justice system.
*[[Problem-solving courts in the United States|Problem-solving courts]]: Problem-solving courts address the underlying problems that contribute to criminal behavior and are a current trend in the legal system of the United States. There were over 2,800 problem-solving courts in 2008, intended to provide a method of resolving the problem in order to reduce recidivism.
*[[Restorative justice in social work|Restorative justice]]: Restorative justice uses dialogue to address the harm that has been done rather than relying solely on jail time as a means of justice.
*[[Ankle monitor|Electronic Monitoring]]: Electronic monitoring is a device that individuals under house arrest or parole are often required to wear. At timed intervals, the ankle monitor sends a radio frequency signal containing location and other information to a receiver. If an offender moves outside of an allowed range, the police will be notified.
*[[Deferred prosecution|Fines/Probation]]: A deferred prosecution agreement is a voluntary alternative to adjudication in which a prosecutor agrees to grant amnesty in exchange for the defendant agreeing to fulfill certain requirements. Fulfillment of the specified requirements will then result in dismissal of the charges.
*[[Diversion program]]s: A diversion program in the criminal justice system is a form of sentencing and such programs are often run by a police department, court, a district attorney's office, or outside agency designed to enable offenders of criminal law to avoid criminal charges and a criminal record.

===Recidivism prevention===

[[Recidivism]] prevention takes place during incarceration and after release back into society. Its purpose is to reduce the risk of an individual reoffending and eventually returning into the prison system. National rates of recidivism over the last three decades have remained relatively steady at approximately 43 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=State of Recidivism April 2011 The Revolving Door of America’s Prisons|date=April 2011|publisher=The Pew Center on States|page=2|url=http://www.pewtrusts.org/uploadedFiles/wwwpewtrustsorg/Reports/sentencing_and_corrections/State_Recidivism_Revolving_Door_America_Prisons%20.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recommendations provided by the "Report of the Re-Entry Policy Council" coordinated by the "Council of State Governments"  reflect the opportunities available for action by entities interested in reducing recidivism. According to the report, there are steps policy makers or practitioners should complete in order to ensure successful programs, such as collaboration, proper funding, system integration, and educating the public. The report also states that policy makers must also consider additional programming needs for incoming offenders, including intake procedures, physical and mental health care, drug treatment, and vocational training. Finally, the report emphasizes the need to address changes in social service delivery, such as housing, workforce development, treatment programs, and mental and physical healthcare systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schrantz|first=Dennis|title=Coordinating Community Development: The Heart of the Michigan Prisoner ReEntry Initiative|journal=Corrections Today Magazine|date=April 2007|volume=69|issue=2|pages=42–49|publisher=http://www.aca.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Prison reform ====

Prison reform seeks to advocate for programming that gives offenders the tools they need for success. Physical and mental health, drug treatment, and educational and vocational programming give offenders the opportunity to begin the process of returning to their communities to become contributing members before they leave the facility.

==== Prisoner reentry initiatives  ====

{{See also|National Criminal Justice Association#Prisoner Reentry|l1=Prisoner reentry}}

The overall purpose of such programs is to provide options, support, and opportunities for prisoners returning home into communities. The goal of preventing crime and reducing recidivism is attained through support programs including vocational and educational programs that provide returning citizens with the skills necessary to succeed in their reintegrated lives. The programs typically start by assessing strengths and risk factors through assessments when offenders begin their sentences, effective support and a plan for success that includes community support, and different strategies to help remediate skill and social deficiencies typically experienced by returning citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Washtenaw Prisoner Re-Entry Program.http://washtenawprisonerreentry.org/contactus.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Juvenile confinement rates on steady decline ==

A study published by the Pew Institute found that there has been a significant decline in at least 37 states for juvenile commitment and violent crime arrest rates between 1997 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Latest Data Show Juvenile Confinement Continues Rapid Decline|url=http://www.pewstates.org/news-room/press-releases/latest-data-show-juvenile-confinement-continues-rapid-decline-85899480842#four|publisher=The Pew Charitable Trust State and Consumer Initiatives|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These decreases in juvenile commitments can be a result of many different factors, including unique programs like the Ohio RECLAIM (Reasonable Equitable Community and Local Alternatives to the Incarceration of Minors) program. This program provides financial incentives that encourage juvenile courts to find and develop community based strategies and programs options that seek to meet the needs of juvenile offenders or at risk offenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ohio Reclaim|url=http://www.dys.ohio.gov/dnn/Community/ReclaimOhio/tabid/131/Default.aspx|publisher=Ohio Department of Youth Services|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This program works to focus the most critical resources for the most serious offenders, such as those committing violent crimes and the most serious of offenses, while encouraging courts to look into community and restorative program placements for the youth who commit crimes not fitting such severe categories. As a result, Ohio has seen a significant decrease in institutional crowding and an 80% decrease in Department of Youth Services (DYS) caseloads from its peak in 1997 to 2012.

An '''[[Inertial frame of reference|inertial]] audio effects controller''' is an electronic device that senses changes in acceleration, angular velocity and/or a magnetic field,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://howtomechatronics.com/how-it-works/electrical-engineering/mems-accelerometer-gyrocope-magnetometer-arduino/|title=MEMS Accelerometer Gyroscope Magnetometer &amp; Arduino|date=2015-11-19|work=HowToMechatronics|access-date=2017-11-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and relays those changes to an effects controller. Transmitting the sensed data can be done via wired or wireless methods. To be of use the effects controller must be connected to an [[Effects unit|effect unit]] so that an effect can be modulated, or connected to a [[MIDI controller]] or [[musical keyboard]]. The [[Wah-wah pedal|Wah-Wah]] effect is a classic example of effect modulation.

An inertial audio effects controller can be compared with a traditional [[expression pedal]] to explain what it does. An inertial effects controller uses an inertial sensor to detect user directed changes, whereas a traditional expression pedal uses an electrically resistive element to detect changes.There are some advantages and disadvantages between the two. The main advantages of inertial control versus a traditional foot pedal, are an increased range of dynamic motion, remote control, finer modulation precision and software enabled features such as motion triggered [[ADSR envelope]]s and bi-directional motion control. The main disadvantages are the requirement for a power source and a more complicated setup.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.expressionpedals.com/inertial-expression&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to their functional similarity with traditional expression pedals, they have been given the informal name, 'Expression box'.

==Availability==

Conceivably any or all of the inertial sensors ([[Accelerometer|accelerometer,]] [[gyroscope]], [[magnetometer]]), could be used for effect modulation. However, currently the only commercially available products use acceleration sensing only&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ehx.com/products/expression-pedal|title=EHX.com {{!}} Expression Pedal - Real-Time Variable Control {{!}} Electro-Harmonix|website=Electro-Harmonix|access-date=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sourceaudio.net/products/hothand/hothand3.php|title=Hot Hand® 3|website=www.sourceaudio.net|access-date=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; or acceleration combined with angular velocity &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ozinventions.com/&lt;/ref&gt;, as sensed by a gyroscope.

==Future==

Inertial control of an audio device, wired or wireless, is a relatively recent and growing trend as technology advances have reduced pricing and size as well as improved usability and performance of the core components.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.electronicproducts.com/Software/EDA_Software_and_Hardware/Thinking_outside_the_chip_for_MEMS_design_success.aspx|title=Thinking outside the chip for MEMS design success - Electronic Products|website=www.electronicproducts.com|access-date=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.allaboutmems.com/memsapplications-wireless.html|title=allaboutmems.com - What is MEMS &gt; MEMS Applications &gt; MEMS in Wireless|website=www.allaboutmems.com|access-date=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically the core components are an inertial device called a Mirco- Electro-Mechanical-System ([[MEMs]]), a [[microcontroller]], and for wireless systems, a [[Transmitter|radio frequency transmitter]]/receiver.

'''Irruptive growth''', sometimes called '''Malthusian growth''', is a growth pattern over time, defined by [[Human overpopulation|population explosions]] and subsequent sharp population crashes, or diebacks.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite book|title=Theory of Population Genetics and Evolutionary Ecology|first=J.|last= Roughgarden|authorlink=Joan Roughgarden|year=1996|publisher= Prentice-Hall, Inc.|isbn=0-13-441965-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an extension of the [[Malthusian growth model]], specifically the growth pattern that causes a [[Malthusian catastrophe]], and can occur when populations overshoot their [[carrying capacity]], a phenomenon typically associated with [[R/K selection theory|r-strategists]]. Populations which exhibit irruptive growth do not stabilize around their carrying capacity, a feature of [[logistic function|logistic growth]]. Irruptive growth occurs when a species reproduces more rapidly than the environment is capable of supporting with the available resources.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.esajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1890/06-2032.1 |title=Irruptive Population Dynamics in Yellowstone Pronghorn|accessdate= 26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Irruptive growth is studied in [[population ecology]].

An '''irruption''' is any sudden change in the population density of an organism.

==K-strategist and r-strategist species==
{{main|r/K selection theory}}
r-strategist species (species that evolve according to r-selection) are characterized by rapid development, early reproduction, small body size, and shorter lifespans, whereas [[r/K selection theory|K-strategist]] species (species that evolve according to K-selection) exhibit slow development, delayed reproduction, large body size, and longer lifespans.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite book|title=Population Ecology: First Principles|author=John H. Vandermeer and Deborah E. Goldberg|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-11440-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are the main two [[evolution]]ary strategies for ensuring the continuation of the species by passing down its [[Genetics|genetic code]]. 

r-strategist species have variable population sizes and are more likely to exhibit irruptive growth than K-strategist species, whose populations are usually constant and remain at or close to the carrying capacity of the environment. r-selection leads to high productivity, while K-selection leads to high efficiency. Productivity refers to the number of offspring produced, whereas efficiency refers to the quality and the probability of survival of individual offspring. 

The [[Human|human species]] is K-strategist; that is, each mating pair has a small number of offspring, of which the majority will survive to adulthood and reach reproductive age. Reproductive age is later in life for K-strategists. r-strategist species, such as some [[insect]]s, have very large numbers of offspring, the majority of which will die before reaching physical maturity. If there is a change in their environment, more of these offspring may survive than is typical, leading to irruptive growth. 

Because of these differences in the number of offspring produced between K- and r-strategists, K-strategist species are more likely to have stable populations and less likely to exhibit irruptive growth.

==Malthusian growth==
{{main|Malthusian growth model}}
One exception to the general rule of K-strategists being less likely to exhibit irruptive growth is people. As Thomas Malthus described in his essay on the [[An Essay on the Principle of Population|Principle of Population]], human overpopulation is a serious issue, and one which can only become more pressing.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;{{cite book|title=An Essay on the Principle of Population|author=Thomas Malthus|publisher=Penguin Books Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to our advanced mental capacity, humans have succeeded in maximizing the carrying capacity of the environment through the invention of higher-yielding crops and transportation to get food from where it is produced to where it is needed for consumption&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/11520695 |title=The Malthus Blues|accessdate=26 September 2011 | work=The Economist|date=9 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the world's population continues to rise, and the capacity of the current food supply to adequately provide for all the people on earth is called ever more into doubt. Thus, we may become one of the few K-strategist species to experience a [[Malthusian catastrophe]].

==In mammal populations==
Populations of some species tend to initially show a lack of response to density-dependent factors that limit population size as it nears carrying capacity. The exhibition of Malthusian growth is dependent on a number of elements including resource availability, degree of both interspecific and intraspecific competition, and strength of [[predator-prey]] relationships.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.esajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1890/06-2032.1 |title=Irruptive Population Dynamics in Yellowstone Pronghorn|accessdate=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irruptive growth patterns are seen in a few mammal species, often in specific locations, and they are usually herbivores with relatively small body size. In cases where a single herbivore prey species is dominant in an ecosystem, there is likely to be a strong link with predator species, which serves to prevent un-checked population growth.&lt;ref name="autogenerated7"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Testing predator-prey theory by studying fluctuating populations of small mammals|author=S. Boutin|year=1995|journal=Wildl. Res.|volume=22|pp=89–100 |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.575.6975&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|citeseerx=10.1.1.575.6975}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbits and house mice of Australia tend to show irruptive growth, likely because when a drought ends, they reproduce at a rapid rate and continue to breed at that rate while predator reproduction is still seasonal in occurrence.&lt;ref name="autogenerated7"/&gt; This allows for the population to explode and to be limited more by a return of dry conditions than by predators.

Larger herbivores like [[pronghorn]] and [[Cervidae|deer]] are also known to exhibit irruptive growth; this occurs in populations with high reproduction and delayed density dependent inhibition.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"/&gt; The time that a species is most likely to irrupt in population growth is when a population is first inhabiting an area or when predators are first removed, and both weather and food supplies are in the species' favor.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"/&gt; When an area is being colonized, populations of species can grow rapidly and predator species are often not present to limit growth. Resource availability is not an issue either for colonizing populations, which will also experience little intraspecific and interspecific competition in early settlement of a location.

Similar to white-tailed deer in North America, roe deer in European locations have shown increases in abundance even in the face of already extremely high densities.&lt;ref name="autogenerated8"&gt;{{cite journal|title= Irruptive potential in roe deer: Density-dependent effects on body mass and fertility|author=R. Andersen |author2=D. C. L. John|year=2000|journal=The Journal of Wildlife Management|volume= 64|issue=3|pp=698–706|doi=10.2307/3802739|jstor=3802739}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deer are able to irrupt and continue to increase in density over their carrying capacity because in particular areas especially, populations show delayed response to density dependent factors.&lt;ref name="autogenerated8"/&gt;  The mammal species that exhibit Malthusian growth are the ones that, under certain conditions, act more like r-strategists than K-strategists compared to surrounding populations.

'''Linguistics''' is the [[science|scientific]] study of [[language]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On Language and Linguistics |first=Michael A.K. |last=Halliday |authorlink=Michael Halliday |author2=Jonathan Webster | publisher= Continuum International Publishing Group |year=2006 |isbn=0-8264-8824-2 |page=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it involves an analysis of language [[Theoretical linguistics|form]], language [[Semantics|meaning]], and language in [[context (language use)|context]].&lt;ref name="Martinet"&gt;{{cite book|title=Elements of General Linguistics |last=Martinet |first=André |authorlink=André Martinet |translator=Elisabeth Palmer Rubbert |series=Studies in General Linguistics, vol. i. |location=London |publisher=Faber |year=1960 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest activities in the [[language documentation|documentation]] and [[descriptive linguistics|description of language]] have been attributed to the 6th century BC [[India]]n grammarian [[Pāṇini]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A New History of the Humanities: The Search for Principles and Patterns from Antiquity to the Present|author=Rens Bod|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0199665214|year=2014|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KaOcAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter =Chapter VI: Sanskrit Literature|title = The Imperial Gazetteer of India|volume = 2 |date=1908|page = 263|url =https://archive.org/details/imperialgazette02hunt}}&lt;/ref&gt; who wrote a formal description of the [[Sanskrit|Sanskrit language]] in his ''{{IAST|Aṣṭādhyāyī}}''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ashtadhyayi of Panini (2 Vols.) |author=S.C.

Linguists traditionally analyse human language by observing an interplay between [[phonetics|sound]] and [[semantics|meaning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Six Lectures on Sound and Meaning |first=Roman |last=Jakobson |publisher=MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=1937 |isbn=0262600102 |url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ru/jakobson.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phonetics]] is the study of speech and non-speech sounds, and delves into their acoustic and articulatory properties. The study of language [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]], on the other hand, deals with how languages encode relations between entities, properties, and other aspects of the world to convey, process, and assign meaning, as well as manage and resolve [[ambiguity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vakyapadiya: Sphota, Jati, and Dravya |author=Sharada Narayanan |year=2010 |url=http://www.thehindu.com/books/power-of-the-word/article3779772.ece}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the study of [[semantics]] typically concerns itself with [[truth condition]]s, [[pragmatics]] deals with how situational context influences the production of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Meaning and Grammar: An Introduction to Semantics |year=2000 |author1=Chierchia, Gennaro |author2=Sally McConnell-Ginet |lastauthoramp=yes|publisher= MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn= 9780262531641}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Grammar]] is a system of rules which governs the production and use of [[utterances]] in a given language. These rules apply to sound&lt;ref&gt;All references in this article to the study of sound should be taken to include the manual and non-manual signs used in [[sign language]]s.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as meaning, and include componential subsets of rules, such as those pertaining to [[phonology]] (the organisation of phonetic sound systems), [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (the formation and composition of words), and [[syntax]] (the formation and composition of phrases and sentences).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Linguistics|year=2010|publisher=The MIT Press|isbn =0-262-51370-6|url= https://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/examrequest.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=12240 |edition= 6th |author1=Adrian Akmajian |author2=Richard A. Demers |author3=Ann K. Farmer |author4=Robert M. Harnish |accessdate= 25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern theories that deal with the principles of grammar are largely based within [[Noam Chomsky]]'s framework of [[generative linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;''Syntax: A Generative Introduction'' (Second Edition), 2013. Andrew Carnie. Blackwell Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] distinguished between the notions of [[langue and parole|''langue'' and ''parole'']] in his formulation of [[structural linguistics]]. According to him, [[speech|''parole'']] is the specific utterance of speech, whereas [[language|langue]] refers to an abstract phenomenon that theoretically defines the principles and system of rules that govern a language.&lt;ref&gt;de Saussure, F. (1986). ''Course in general linguistics'' (3rd ed.). (R. Harris, Trans.). Chicago: Open Court Publishing Company. (Original work published 1972). p. 9-10, 15.&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction resembles the one made by [[Noam Chomsky]] between [[linguistic competence|competence]] and [[Linguistic performance|performance]] in his theory of [[generative grammar|transformative]] or [[universal grammar|generative grammar]]. According to Chomsky, competence is an individual's innate capacity and potential for language (like in Saussure's ''langue''), while performance is the specific way in which it is used by individuals, groups, and communities (i.e., ''parole'', in Saussurean terms).&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam. (1965). ''Aspects of the Theory of Syntax''. Cambridge, MA: [[MIT Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of ''parole'' (which manifests through cultural [[discourse (linguistics)|discourses]] and [[dialects]]) is the domain of [[sociolinguistics]], the sub-discipline that comprises the study of a complex system of linguistic facets within a certain [[speech community]] (governed by its own set of grammatical rules and laws). [[Discourse analysis]] further examines the structure of texts and [[conversations]] emerging out of a speech community's usage of language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sociolinguistic Discontinuity in Minority Language Communities |pages=40–55 |year=1998 |publisher=Linguistic Society of America |author1=Raymond Mougeon |author2=Terry Nadasdi |lastauthoramp=yes|jstor=417564}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is done through the collection of linguistic data, or through the formal discipline of [[corpus linguistics]], which takes naturally occurring [[Text (disambiguation)|texts]] and studies the variation of grammatical and other features based on such corpora (or corpus data).

[[stylistics (field of study)|Stylistics]] also involves the study of written, signed, or spoken [[discourse]] through varying speech communities, [[genres]], and editorial or [[narrative]] formats in the mass media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.uni-giessen.de/anglistik/ling/Staff/mukherjee/pdfs/Stylistics.pdf |title="Stylistics" by Joybrato Mukherjee. Chapter 49.

Antonsen}}&lt;/ref&gt; The formal study of language also led to the growth of fields like [[psycholinguistics]], which explores the representation and function of language in the mind; [[neurolinguistics]], which studies language processing in the brain; [[biolinguistics]], which studies the biology and evolution of language; and [[language acquisition]], which investigates how children and adults acquire the knowledge of one or more languages.

Linguistics also deals with the social, cultural, historical and political factors that influence language, through which linguistic and language-based context is often determined.&lt;ref&gt;[http://benjamins.com/#catalog/journals/jlp/main Journal of Language and Politics]&lt;/ref&gt; Research on language through the sub-branches of [[historical linguistics|historical]] and [[evolutionary linguistics]] also focus on how languages change and grow, particularly over an extended [[diachronic linguistics|period of time]].

[[Language documentation]] combines anthropological inquiry (into the history and culture of language) with linguistic inquiry, in order to describe languages and their grammars. [[Lexicography]] involves the documentation of words that form a vocabulary. Such a documentation of a linguistic vocabulary from a particular language is usually compiled in a [[dictionary]]. [[Computational linguistics]] is concerned with the statistical or rule-based modeling of natural language from a computational perspective. Specific knowledge of language is applied by speakers during the act of [[translation]] and [[Language interpretation|interpretation]], as well as in [[language education]] – the teaching of a second or [[foreign language]]. Policy makers work with governments to implement new plans in education and teaching which are based on linguistic research.

Related areas of study also includes the disciplines of [[semiotics]] (the study of direct and indirect language through signs and symbols), [[literary criticism]] (the historical and ideological analysis of literature, cinema, art, or published material), [[translation]] (the conversion and documentation of meaning in written/spoken text from one language or dialect onto another), and [[speech-language pathology]] (a corrective method to cure phonetic disabilities and dis-functions at the [[cognitive linguistics|cognitive]] level).

==Nomenclature==
Before the 20th century, the term ''[[philology]]'', first attested in 1716,&lt;ref name="Etymonline Definition of Philology"&gt;{{OEtymD|philology|accessdate=2018-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; was commonly used to refer to the study of language, which was then predominantly historical in focus.&lt;ref name="Introduction: Philology in a Manuscript Culture by Stephen G. Nichols (Vol. 65, No. 1 (Jan 1990), pp. 1-10. Published by Medieval Academy of America."&gt;{{cite journal |title=Introduction: Philology in a Manuscript Culture |first=Stephen G. |last=Nichols |journal=Speculum |volume=65 |number=1 |year=1990 |pages=1–10 |jstor=2864468 |doi=10.2307/2864468}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=McMahon |first=A. M. S. |year=1994 |title=Understanding Language Change |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=19 |isbn=0-521-44665-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s insistence on the importance of [[synchronic analysis (linguistics)|synchronic analysis]], however, this focus has shifted&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=McMahon |first=A. M. S. |year=1994 |title=Understanding Language Change |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=9 |isbn=0-521-44665-1 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the term ''philology'' is now generally used for the "study of a language's grammar, history, and literary tradition", especially in the United States&lt;ref&gt;A. Morpurgo Davies Hist. Linguistics (1998) 4 I. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; (where philology has never been very popularly considered as the "science of language").&lt;ref name="Etymonline Definition of Philology"/&gt;

Although the term "linguist" in the sense of "a student of language" dates from 1641,&lt;ref name="etymonline linguist"/&gt; the term "linguistics" is first attested in 1847.&lt;ref name="etymonline linguist"&gt;{{OEtymD|linguist|accessdate=2018-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now the usual term in English for the scientific study of language,{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} though ''linguistic science'' is sometimes used.

Linguistics is a [[Interdisciplinarity|multi-disciplinary]] field of research that combines tools from natural sciences, social sciences, and the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8nc6nRRbMSQC&amp;pg=PA13|title=The Handbook of Educational Linguistics|last=Spolsky|first=Bernard|last2=Hult|first2=Francis M.|date=February 2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=|isbn=9781444331042|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EUMqGSbeEXAC&amp;pg=PA23|title=Concise Encyclopedia of Applied Linguistics|last=Berns|first=Margie|date=2010-03-20|publisher=Elsevier|year=|isbn=9780080965031|location=|pages=23–25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.linguisticsociety.org/resource/science-linguistics|title=The Science of Linguistics|last=|first=|date=|website=Linguistic Society of America|language=en|access-date=2018-04-17|quote=Modern linguists approach their work with a scientific perspective, although they use methods that used to be thought of as solely an academic discipline of the humanities. Contrary to previous belief, linguistics is multidisciplinary. It overlaps each of the human sciences including psychology, neurology, anthropology, and sociology. Linguists conduct formal studies of sound structure, grammar and meaning, but they also investigate the history of language families, and research language acquisition.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many linguists, such as David Crystal, conceptualize the field as being primarily scientific.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Linguistics|last=Crystal|first=David|publisher=Penguin Books|year=1990|isbn=9780140135312|authorlink=David Crystal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term ''linguist'' applies to someone who studies [[language]] or is a researcher within the field, or to someone who uses the tools of the discipline to describe and analyse specific languages.&lt;ref name="American Heritage 2000"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Linguist|encyclopedia=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year=2000|isbn=978-0-395-82517-4|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variation and universality ==
While some theories on linguistics focus on the different varieties that language produces, among different sections of society, others focus on the [[universal grammar|universal]] properties that are common to all human languages. The theory of variation therefore would elaborate on the different usages of popular languages like [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]] across the globe, as well as its smaller [[dialects]] and regional permutations within their national boundaries. The theory of variation looks at the cultural stages that a particular language undergoes, and these include the following.

===Pidgin===

The pidgin stage in a language is a stage when communication occurs through a grammatically simplified means, developing between two or more groups that do not have a language in common. Typically, it is a mixture of languages at the stage when there occurs a [[mixed language|mixing]] between a primary language with other language elements.

===Creole===

A creole stage in language occurs when there is a stable natural language developed from a mixture of different languages. It is a stage that occurs after a language undergoes its pidgin stage. At the creole stage, a language is a complete language, used in a community and acquired by children as their native language.

===Dialect===
A dialect is a [[variety (linguistics)|variety]] of [[language]] that is characteristic of a particular group among the language speakers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50063104?query_type=word&amp;queryword=dialect&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=1&amp;search_id=tFGd-Bh8USU-18775&amp;hilite=50063104 Oxford English dictionary.]&lt;/ref&gt; The group of people who are the speakers of a dialect are usually bound to each other by social identity. This is what differentiates a dialect from a [[register (sociolinguistics)|register]] or a [[discourse]], where in the latter case, cultural identity does not always play a role. Dialects are speech varieties that have their own grammatical and phonological rules, linguistic features, and stylistic aspects, but have not been given an official status as a language. Dialects often move on to gain the status of a language due to political and social reasons. Differentiation amongst dialects (and subsequently, languages too) is based upon the use of grammatical rules, syntactic rules, and stylistic features, though not always on lexical use or vocabulary. The popular saying that "[[a language is a dialect with an army and navy]]" is attributed as a definition formulated by [[Max Weinreich]].

[[Universal grammar]] takes into account general formal structures and features that are common to all dialects and languages, and the template of which pre-exists in the mind of an infant child. This idea is based on the theory of generative grammar and the formal school of linguistics, whose proponents include [[Chomsky|Noam Chomsky]] and those who follow his theory and work.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"We may as individuals be rather fond of our own dialect. This should not make us think, though, that it is actually any better than any other dialect. Dialects are not good or bad, nice or nasty, right or wrong&amp;nbsp;– they are just different from one another, and it is the mark of a civilised society that it tolerates different dialects just as it tolerates different races, religions and sexes."&lt;ref&gt;Trudgill, P. (1994). Dialects. ''Ebooks Online'' Routledge. Florence, KY.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Discourse===
Discourse is language as social practice (Baynham, 1995) and is a multilayered concept.  As a social practice, discourse embodies different ideologies through written and spoken texts. Discourse analysis can examine or expose these ideologies.   Discourse influences genre, which is chosen in response to different situations and finally, at micro level, discourse influences language as text (spoken or written) at the phonological or lexico-grammatical level. Grammar and discourse are linked as parts of a system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ariel|first=Mira|year=2009|title=Discourse, grammar, discourse|jstor=24049745|journal=Discourse Studies|volume=11|issue=1|pages=5–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A particular discourse becomes a language variety when it is used in this way for a particular purpose, and is referred to as a [[register (sociolinguistics)|register]].&lt;ref&gt;Helen Leckie-Tarry, ''Language and Context: a Functional Linguistic Theory of Register'', Continuum International Publishing Group, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;6. {{ISBN|1-85567-272-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; There may be certain [[lexicon|lexical]] additions (new words) that are brought into play because of the expertise of the community of people within a certain domain of specialization. Registers and discourses therefore differentiate themselves through the use of [[vocabulary]], and at times through the use of style too. People in the medical fraternity, for example, may use some medical terminology in their communication that is specialized to the field of medicine. This is often referred to as being part of the "medical discourse", and so on.

===Standard language===

When a dialect is documented sufficiently through the linguistic description of its grammar, which has emerged through the consensual laws from within its community, it gains political and national recognition through a country or region's policies. That is the stage when a language is considered a standard variety, one whose grammatical laws have now stabilised from within the consent of speech community participants, after sufficient evolution, improvisation, correction, and growth. The English language, besides perhaps the French language, may be examples of languages that have arrived at a stage where they are said to have become standard varieties.

The study of a language's universal properties, on the other hand, include some of the following concepts.

===Lexicon===
The [[lexicon]] is a catalogue of words and terms that are stored in a speaker's mind. The lexicon consists of [[words]] and [[bound morphemes]], which are parts of words that can't stand alone, like [[affixes]]. In some analyses, compound words and certain classes of idiomatic expressions and other collocations are also considered to be part of the lexicon. Dictionaries represent attempts at listing, in alphabetical order, the lexicon of a given language; usually, however, bound morphemes are not included. [[Lexicography]], closely linked with the domain of semantics, is the science of mapping the words into an [[encyclopedia]] or a [[dictionary]]. The creation and addition of new words (into the lexicon) is called coining or neologization,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |authorlink=Ghil'ad Zuckermann |last=Zuckermann |first=Ghil'ad |year=2003 |url=http://www.palgrave.com/gb/book/9781403917232 |title=Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=978-1403917232 |pages=2ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the new words are called [[neologism]]s.

It is often believed that a speaker's capacity for language lies in the quantity of words stored in the lexicon. However, this is often considered a myth by linguists. The capacity for the use of language is considered by many linguists to lie primarily in the domain of grammar, and to be linked with [[linguistic competence|competence]], rather than with the growth of vocabulary. Even a very small lexicon is theoretically capable of producing an infinite number of sentences.

===Relativity===
As constructed popularly through the [[linguistic relativity|Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]], relativists believe that the structure of a particular language is capable of influencing the cognitive patterns through which a person shapes his or her [[world view]]. Universalists believe that there are commonalities between human perception as there is in the human capacity for language, while relativists believe that this varies from language to language and person to person. While the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis is an elaboration of this idea expressed through the writings of American linguists [[Edward Sapir]] and [[Benjamin Lee Whorf]], it was Sapir's student [[Harry Hoijer]] who termed it thus. The 20th century German linguist [[Leo Weisgerber]] also wrote extensively about the theory of relativity. Relativists argue for the case of differentiation at the level of cognition and in semantic domains. The emergence of [[cognitive linguistics]] in the 1980s also revived an interest in linguistic relativity. Thinkers like [[George Lakoff]] have argued that language reflects different cultural metaphors, while the French philosopher of language [[Jacques Derrida]]'s writings have been seen to be closely associated with the relativist movement in linguistics, especially through [[deconstructivism|deconstruction]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Writing and Difference |author=Jacques Derrida |translator=Alan Bass |year=1978 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=9780226143293}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was even heavily criticized in the media at the time of his death for his theory of relativism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/nov/18/philosophy |title=Relative Thinking |work=The Guardian |first=Richard |last=Lea |date=18 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structures==
Linguistic structures are pairings of meaning and form.  Any particular pairing of meaning and form is a [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussurean]] [[linguistic sign|sign]].  For instance, the meaning "cat" is represented worldwide with a wide variety of different sound patterns (in oral languages), movements of the hands and face (in [[sign language]]s), and written symbols (in written languages). Linguistic patterns have proven their importance for the knowledge engineering field especially with the ever-increasing amount of available data.

Linguists focusing on structure attempt to understand the rules regarding language use that native speakers know (not always consciously).  All linguistic structures can be broken down into component parts that are combined according to (sub)conscious rules, over multiple levels of analysis.  For instance, consider the structure of the word "tenth" on two different levels of analysis.  On the level of internal word structure (known as morphology), the word "tenth" is made up of one linguistic form indicating a number and another form indicating ordinality.  The rule governing the combination of these forms ensures that the ordinality marker "th" follows the number "ten."  On the level of sound structure (known as phonology), structural analysis shows that the "n" sound in "tenth" is made differently from the "n" sound in "ten" spoken alone.  Although most speakers of English are consciously aware of the rules governing internal structure of the word pieces of "tenth", they are less often aware of the rule governing its sound structure.  Linguists focused on structure find and analyze rules such as these, which govern how native speakers use language.

Linguistics has many sub-fields concerned with particular aspects of linguistic structure. The theory that elucidates on these, as propounded by Noam Chomsky, is known as [[generative linguistics|generative theory]] or [[universal grammar]]. These sub-fields range from those focused primarily on form to those focused primarily on meaning. They also run the gamut of level of analysis of language, from individual sounds, to words, to phrases, up to cultural discourse.

===Grammar===

Sub-fields that focus on a grammatical study of language include the following.

* '''[[Phonetics]]''', the study of the physical properties of speech sound production and perception
* '''[[Phonology]]''', the study of sounds as abstract elements in the speaker's mind that distinguish meaning ([[phonemes]])
* '''[[Morphology (linguistics)|Morphology]]''', the study of [[morphemes]], or the internal structures of words and how they can be modified
* '''[[Syntax]]''', the study of how words combine to form grammatical phrases and [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentences]]
* '''[[Semantics]]''', the study of the meaning of words ([[lexical semantics]]) and fixed word combinations ([[phraseology]]), and how these combine to form the [[meaning (linguistics)|meanings]] of sentences
* '''[[Pragmatics]]''', the study of how [[utterance]]s are used in [[speech acts|communicative acts]], and the role played by context and non-linguistic knowledge in the transmission of meaning
* '''[[Discourse analysis]]''', the analysis of language use in [[Text (literary theory)|texts]] (spoken, written, or signed)
* '''[[Stylistics (field of study)|Stylistics]]''', the study of linguistic factors (rhetoric, diction, stress) that place a discourse in context
* '''[[Semiotics]]''', the study of signs and sign processes (semiosis), indication, designation, likeness, analogy, metaphor, symbolism, signification, and communication

===Style===
[[Stylistics (field of study)|Stylistics]] is the study and interpretation of texts for aspects of their linguistic and tonal style. Stylistic analysis entails the analysis of description of particular [[dialects]] and [[register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] used by speech communities. Stylistic features include [[rhetoric]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Philosophy of Rhetoric |author=IA Richards |year=1965 |publisher=Oxford University Press (New York)}}&lt;/ref&gt; diction, stress, [[satire]], [[irony]], dialogue, and other forms of phonetic variations. Stylistic analysis can also include the study of language in canonical works of literature, popular fiction, news, advertisements, and other forms of communication in popular culture as well. It is usually seen as a variation in communication that changes from speaker to speaker and community to community. In short, Stylistics is the interpretation of text.

==Approaches==

===Theoretical===
One major debate in linguistics concerns the very nature of language and how it should be understood. Some linguists hypothesize that there is a [[language module|module]] in the [[human brain]] that allows people to undertake linguistic behaviour, which is part of the [[formal grammar|formalist]] approach. This "[[universal grammar]]" is considered to guide children when they learn language and to constrain what sentences are considered grammatical in any human language. Proponents of this view, which is predominant in those schools of linguistics that are based on the [[generative linguistics|generative]] theory of [[Noam Chomsky]], do not necessarily consider that language evolved for communication in particular. They consider instead that it has more to do with the process of structuring human thought (see also [[formal grammar]]).

===Functional===
Another group of linguists, by contrast, use the term "language" to refer to a communication system that developed to support [[cooperation|cooperative activity]] and extend cooperative networks. Such [[functional theories of grammar|theories of grammar]], called "functional", view language as a tool that emerged and is adapted to the communicative needs of its users, and the role of [[cultural evolution]]ary processes are often emphasized over that of [[biological evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Daniela | last=Isac |author2=Charles Reiss  | title= I-language: An Introduction to Linguistics as Cognitive Science, 2nd edition |url= http://linguistics.concordia.ca/i-language/ | year=2013 | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=978-0199660179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
Linguistics is primarily [[descriptive linguistics|descriptive]].&lt;ref name="Martinet" /&gt; Linguists describe and explain features of language without making subjective judgments on whether a particular feature or usage is "good" or "bad". This is analogous to practice in other sciences: a [[zoologist]] studies the animal kingdom without making subjective judgments on whether a particular species is "better" or "worse" than another.

[[Linguistic prescription|Prescription]], on the other hand, is an attempt to promote particular linguistic usages over others, often favouring a particular dialect or "[[acrolect]]". This may have the aim of establishing a [[Standard language|linguistic standard]], which can aid communication over large geographical areas. It may also, however, be an attempt by speakers of one language or dialect to exert influence over speakers of other languages or dialects (see [[Linguistic imperialism]]). An extreme version of prescriptivism can be found among [[censorship|censors]], who attempt to eradicate words and structures that they consider to be destructive to society. Prescription, however, may be practised appropriately in the [[teaching of language]], like in [[English language teaching|ELT]], where certain fundamental grammatical rules and lexical terms need to be introduced to a second-language speaker who is attempting to [[language acquisition|acquire]] the language.

===Anthropology===
The objective of describing languages is often to uncover cultural knowledge about communities. The use of [[anthropology|anthropological]] methods of investigation on linguistic sources leads to the discovery of certain cultural traits among a speech community through its linguistic features. It is also widely used as a tool in [[language documentation]], with an endeavour to curate [[endangered languages]]. However, now, linguistic inquiry uses the anthropological method to understand cognitive, historical, sociolinguistic and historical processes that languages undergo as they change and evolve, as well as general anthropological inquiry uses the linguistic method to excavate into culture. In all aspects, anthropological inquiry usually uncovers the different variations and relativities that underlie the usage of language.

===Sources===
Most contemporary linguists work under the assumption that [[spoken language|spoken data]] and [[Sign language|signed data]] are more fundamental than [[written language|written data]]. This is because
* Speech appears to be universal to all human beings capable of producing and perceiving it, while there have been many [[culture]]s and speech communities that lack written communication;
* Features appear in speech which aren't always recorded in writing, including [[phonological rule]]s, [[sound change]]s, and [[speech error]]s;
* All natural writing systems reflect a spoken language (or potentially a signed one), even with [[pictographic]] scripts like [[Dongba]] writing [[Naxi language|Naxi]] [[homophone]]s with the same pictogram, and text in writing systems used for [[List of languages by writing system|two languages]] changing to fit the spoken language being recorded;
* Speech evolved before human beings invented writing;
* People learnt to speak and process spoken language more easily and earlier than they did with [[writing]].

Nonetheless, linguists agree that the study of written language can be worthwhile and valuable. For research that relies on [[corpus linguistics]] and [[computational linguistics]], written language is often much more convenient for processing large amounts of linguistic data. Large corpora of spoken language are difficult to create and hard to find, and are typically [[transcription (linguistics)|transcribed]] and written. In addition, linguists have turned to text-based discourse occurring in various formats of [[computer-mediated communication]] as a viable site for linguistic inquiry.

The study of [[writing systems]] themselves, [[graphemics]], is, in any case, considered a branch of linguistics.

===Analysis===
Before the 20th century, linguists analysed language on a [[diachronic linguistics|diachronic]] plane, which was historical in focus. This meant that they would compare linguistic features and try to analyse language from the point of view of how it had changed between then and later. However, with [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussurean]] linguistics in the 20th century, the focus shifted to a more [[synchronic linguistics|synchronic]] approach, where the study was more geared towards analysis and comparison between different language variations, which existed at the same given point of time.

At another level, the [[syntagmatic analysis|syntagmatic]] plane of linguistic analysis entails the comparison between the way words are sequenced, within the syntax of a sentence. For example, the article "the" is followed by a noun, because of the syntagmatic relation between the words. The [[paradigmatic analysis|paradigmatic]] plane on the other hand, focuses on an analysis that is based on the [[paradigms]] or concepts that are embedded in a given text. In this case, words of the same type or class may be replaced in the text with each other to achieve the same conceptual understanding.

==History==
{{main|History of linguistics}}

===Early grammarians===
{{main|Philology|History of English grammars}}

The formal study of language began in [[India]] with [[Pāṇini]], the 6th century BC grammarian who formulated 3,959 rules of [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. Pāṇini's systematic classification of the sounds of Sanskrit into [[consonant]]s and [[vowel]]s, and word classes, such as nouns and verbs, was the first known instance of its kind. In the [[Middle East]], [[Sibawayh]], a non-Arab, made a detailed description of Arabic in AD 760 in his monumental work, ''Al-kitab fi al-nahw'' ({{lang|ar|الكتاب في النحو}}, ''The Book on Grammar''), the first known author to distinguish between [[phonetics|sounds]] and [[phonology|phonemes (sounds as units of a linguistic system)]].  Western interest in the study of languages began somewhat later than in the East,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloomfield|1983|p=307}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but the grammarians of the classical languages did not use the same methods or reach the same conclusions as their contemporaries in the Indic world. Early interest in language in the West was a part of philosophy, not of grammatical description. The first insights into semantic theory were made by [[Plato]] in his [[Cratylus (dialogue)|''Cratylus'' dialogue]], where he argues that words denote concepts that are eternal and exist in the world of ideas. This work is the first to use the word [[etymology]] to describe the history of a word's meaning. Around 280 BC, one of [[Alexander the Great]]'s successors founded a university (see [[Musaeum]]) in [[Alexandria]], where a school of philologists studied the ancient texts in and taught [[Greek language|Greek]] to speakers of other languages. While this school was the first to use the word "[[grammar]]" in its modern sense, Plato had used the word in its original meaning as "[[Art of Grammar|téchnē grammatikḗ]]" ({{script|Grek|Τέχνη Γραμματική}}), the "art of writing", which is also the title of one of the most important works of the Alexandrine school by [[Dionysius Thrax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Seuren, Pieter A. M.  |year=1998|title=Western linguistics: An historical introduction|publisher=Wiley-blackwell|isbn=0-631-20891-7|pages=2–24|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the [[Middle Ages]], the study of language was subsumed under the topic of philology, the study of ancient languages and texts, practised by such educators as [[Roger Ascham]], [[Wolfgang Ratke]], and [[John Amos Comenius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloomfield|1983|p=308}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparative philology===
In the 18th century, the first use of the [[comparative method]] by [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]] sparked the rise of [[comparative linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloomfield|1983|p=310}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Bloomfield attributes "the first great scientific linguistic work of the world" to [[Jacob Grimm]], who wrote ''Deutsche Grammatik''.&lt;ref name="Bloomfield 1914 311"&gt;{{harvnb|Bloomfield|1983|p=311}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was soon followed by other authors writing similar comparative studies on other language groups of Europe. The study of language was broadened from [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] to language in general by [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]], of whom Bloomfield asserts:&lt;ref name="Bloomfield 1914 311"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This study received its foundation at the hands of the Prussian statesman and scholar Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767–1835), especially in the first volume of his work on Kavi, the literary language of Java, entitled ''Über die Verschiedenheit des menschlichen Sprachbaues und ihren Einfluß auf die geistige Entwickelung des Menschengeschlechts'' (''On the Variety of the Structure of Human Language and its Influence upon the Mental Development of the Human Race'').&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Structuralism===
{{main|Structuralism (linguistics)}}
Early in the 20th century, [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]] introduced the idea of language as a static system of interconnected units, defined through the oppositions between them. By introducing a distinction between [[Diachronic linguistics|diachronic]] and [[Synchronic linguistics|synchronic]] analyses of language, he laid the foundation of the modern discipline of linguistics. Saussure also introduced several basic dimensions of linguistic analysis that are still foundational in many contemporary linguistic theories, such as the distinctions between [[syntagmatic analysis|syntagm]] and [[paradigmatic analysis|paradigm]], and the [[Langue and parole|langue- parole distinction]], distinguishing language as an abstract system (''langue'') from language as a concrete manifestation of this system (''parole'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sources of Semiotic: Readings with Commentary from Antiquity to the Present |first=David S. |last=Clarke |year=1990|location=Carbondale|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|pages=143–144 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-vZDmu_4_CUC&amp;pg=PA143 |isbn=9780809316144 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Substantial additional contributions following Saussure's definition of a structural approach to language came from [[Prague school (linguistics)|The Prague school]], [[Leonard Bloomfield]], [[Charles F. Hockett]], [[Louis Hjelmslev]], [[Émile Benveniste]] and [[Roman Jakobson]].&lt;ref name="Holquist81"&gt;{{harvnb|Holquist|1981|pp=xvii–xviii}}.{{citation not found}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Course in General Linguistics |first=Ferdinand |last=de Saussure |publisher=McGraw Hill |location=New York |isbn=0-8022-1493-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Generativism===
{{main|Generative linguistics}}
During the last half of the 20th century, following the work of [[Noam Chomsky]], linguistics was dominated by the [[Generative grammar|generativist school]]. While formulated by Chomsky in part as a way to explain how human beings [[language acquisition|acquire language]] and the biological constraints on this acquisition, in practice it has largely been concerned with giving formal accounts of specific phenomena in natural languages. Generative theory is [[Language module|modularist]] and formalist in character. Chomsky built on earlier work of [[Zellig Harris]] to formulate the generative theory of language. According to this theory the most basic form of language is a set of syntactic rules universal for all humans and underlying the grammars of all human languages. This set of rules is called [[Universal Grammar]], and for Chomsky describing it is the primary objective of the discipline of linguistics. For this reason the grammars of individual languages are of importance to linguistics only in so far as they allow us to discern the universal underlying rules from which the observable linguistic variability is generated.

In the classic formalization of generative grammars first proposed by [[Noam Chomsky]] in the 1950s,&lt;ref name="Chomsky1956"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Chomsky, Noam | title = Three Models for the Description of Language | journal = [[IRE Transactions on Information Theory]] | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 113 123 | year = 1956 | doi = 10.1109/TIT.1956.1056813 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chomsky1957"&gt;{{Cite book | author = Chomsky, Noam | title = Syntactic Structures | publisher = [[Mouton de Gruyter|Mouton]] | location = The Hague | year = 1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; a grammar ''G'' consists of the following components:

* A finite set ''N'' of ''[[nonterminal symbol]]s'', none of which appear in strings formed from ''G''.
* A finite set &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; of ''[[terminal symbol]]s'' that is [[Disjoint sets|disjoint]] from ''N''.
* A finite set ''P'' of ''production rules'', that map from one string of symbols to another.
A formal description of language attempts to replicate a speaker's knowledge of the rules of their language, and the aim is to produce a set of rules that is minimally sufficient to successfully model valid linguistic forms.

===Functionalism===
{{main|Functional theories of grammar}}
Functional theories of language propose that since language is fundamentally a tool, it is reasonable to assume that its structures are best analysed and understood with reference to the functions they carry out. Functional theories of grammar differ from [[Formal grammar|formal theories of grammar]], in that the latter seek to define the different elements of language and describe the way they relate to each other as systems of formal rules or operations, whereas the former defines the functions performed by language and then relates these functions to the linguistic elements that carry them out. This means that functional theories of grammar tend to pay attention to the way language is actually used, and not just to the formal relations between linguistic elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Functional Theories of Grammar|author=Nichols, Johanna|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=13|year=1984|quote=[Functional grammar] analyzes grammatical structure, as do formal and structural grammar; but it also analyses the entire communicative situation: the purpose of the speech event, its participants, its discourse context. Functionalists maintain that the communicative situation motivates, constrains, explains, or otherwise determines grammatical structure, and that a structural or formal approach is not merely limited to an artificially restricted data base, but is inadequate as a structural account. Functional grammar, then, differs from formulae and structural grammar in that it purports not to model but to explain; and the explanation is grounded in the communicative situation.|doi=10.1146/annurev.an.13.100184.000525|pages=97–117|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Functional theories describe language in term of the functions existing at all levels of language.
*Phonological function: the function of the [[phoneme]] is to distinguish between different lexical material.
*Semantic function: ([[Agent (linguistics)|Agent]], [[Patient (linguistics)|Patient]], Recipient, etc.), describing the role of participants in states of affairs or actions expressed.
*Syntactic functions: (e.g. [[Subject (grammar)|Subject]] and [[Object (grammar)|Object]]), defining different perspectives in the presentation of a linguistic expression
*Pragmatic functions: ([[Topic–comment|Theme and Rheme]], [[Topic (linguistics)|Topic]] and [[Focus (linguistics)|Focus]], [[Predicate (grammar)|Predicate]]), defining the informational status of constituents, determined by the pragmatic context of the verbal interaction. Functional descriptions of grammar strive to explain how linguistic functions are performed in communication through the use of linguistic forms.

===Cognitive linguistics===
{{main|Cognitive linguistics}}
Cognitive linguistics emerged as a reaction to generativist theory in the 1970s and 1980s. Led by theorists like [[Ronald Langacker]] and [[George Lakoff]], cognitive linguists propose that language is an [[emergentism|emergent]] property of basic, general-purpose cognitive processes. In contrast to the generativist school of linguistics, cognitive linguistics is non-modularist and functionalist in character. Important developments in cognitive linguistics include [[cognitive grammar]], [[Frame semantics (linguistics)|frame semantics]], and [[conceptual metaphor]], all of which are based on the idea that form–function correspondences based on representations derived from [[embodied cognition|embodied experience]] constitute the basic units of language.

Cognitive linguistics interprets language in terms of concepts (sometimes universal, sometimes specific to a particular tongue) that underlie its form. It is thus closely associated with [[semantics]] but is distinct from [[psycholinguistics]], which draws upon empirical findings from cognitive psychology in order to explain the mental processes that underlie the acquisition, storage, production and understanding of speech and writing.  Unlike generative theory, [[cognitive linguistics]] denies that there is an ''autonomous linguistic faculty'' in the mind; it understands grammar in terms of ''conceptualization''; and claims that knowledge of language arises out of ''language use''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cognitive Linguistics|author1=Croft, William  |author2=D. Alan Cruse |lastauthoramp=yes|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|year=2004|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its conviction that knowledge of language is learned through use, cognitive linguistics is sometimes considered to be a functional approach, but it differs from other functional approaches in that it is primarily concerned with how the mind creates meaning through language, and not with the use of language as a tool of communication.

==Areas of research==

===Historical linguistics===
[[Historical linguistics|Historical linguists]] study the history of specific languages as well as general characteristics of language change. The study of language change is also referred to as "diachronic linguistics" (the study of how one particular language has changed over time), which can be distinguished from  "synchronic linguistics" (the comparative study of more than one language at a given moment in time without regard to previous stages). Historical linguistics was among the first sub-disciplines to emerge in linguistics, and was the most widely practised form of linguistics in the late 19th century. However, there was a shift to the synchronic approach in the early twentieth century with [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]], and became more predominant in western linguistics with the work of [[Noam Chomsky]].

===Ecolinguistics===
[[Ecolinguistics]] explores the role of language in the life-sustaining interactions of humans, other species and the physical environment. The first aim is to develop linguistic theories which see humans not only as part of society, but also as part of the larger ecosystems that life depends on. The second aim is to show how linguistics can be used to address key ecological issues, from climate change and [[biodiversity loss]] to environmental justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ecolinguistics-association.org/ |title=Ecolinguistics Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociolinguistics===
[[Sociolinguistics]] is the study of how language is shaped by social factors. This sub-discipline focuses on the synchronic approach of linguistics, and looks at how a language in general, or a set of languages, display variation and varieties at a given point in time. The study of language variation and the different varieties of language through dialects, registers, and ideolects can be tackled through a study of style, as well as through analysis of discourse. Sociolinguists research on both style and discourse in language, and also study the theoretical factors that are at play between language and society.

===Developmental linguistics===
[[Developmental linguistics]] is the study of the development of linguistic ability in individuals, particularly [[Language acquisition|the acquisition of language]] in childhood. Some of the questions that developmental linguistics looks into is how children acquire different languages, how adults can acquire a second language, and what the process of language acquisition is.

===Neurolinguistics===
[[Neurolinguistics]] is the study of the structures in the human brain that underlie grammar and communication. Researchers are drawn to the field from a variety of backgrounds, bringing along a variety of experimental techniques as well as widely varying theoretical perspectives. Much work in neurolinguistics is informed by models in [[psycholinguistics]] and [[theoretical linguistics]], and is focused on investigating how the brain can implement the processes that theoretical and psycholinguistics propose are necessary in producing and comprehending language. Neurolinguists study the physiological mechanisms by which the brain processes information related to language, and evaluate linguistic and psycholinguistic theories, using [[aphasiology]], [[brain imaging]], electrophysiology, and computer modelling. Amongst the structures of the brain involved in the mechanisms of neurolinguistics, the cerebellum which contains the highest numbers of neurons has a major role in terms of predictions required to produce language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mariën|first=Peter|last2=Manto|first2=Mario|date=2017-10-25|title=Cerebellum as a Master-Piece for Linguistic Predictability|journal=Cerebellum (London, England)|volume=17|issue=2|pages=101–103|doi=10.1007/s12311-017-0894-1|issn=1473-4230|pmid=29071518}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applied linguistics==
{{Main|Applied linguistics}}
Linguists are largely concerned with finding and [[descriptive linguistics|describing]] the generalities and varieties both within particular languages and among all languages. [[Applied linguistics]] takes the results of those findings and "applies" them to other areas. Linguistic research is commonly applied to areas such as [[language education]], [[lexicography]], [[translation]], [[language planning]], which involves governmental policy implementation related to language use, and [[natural language processing]]. "Applied linguistics" has been argued to be something of a misnomer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Controversies in Applied Linguistics (pp. 288) |author=Barbara Seidlhofer |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2003 |isbn=0194374440}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applied linguists actually focus on making sense of and engineering solutions for real-world linguistic problems, and not literally "applying" existing technical knowledge from linguistics. Moreover, they commonly apply technical knowledge from multiple sources, such as sociology (e.g., conversation analysis) and anthropology. ([[Constructed language]] fits under Applied linguistics.)

Today, computers are widely used in many areas of applied linguistics. [[Speech synthesis]] and [[speech recognition]] use phonetic and phonemic knowledge to provide voice interfaces to computers. Applications of [[computational linguistics]] in [[machine translation]], [[computer-assisted translation]], and [[natural language processing]] are areas of applied linguistics that have come to the forefront. Their influence has had an effect on theories of syntax and semantics, as modelling syntactic and semantic theories on computers constraints.

Linguistic analysis is a sub-discipline of applied linguistics used by many governments to verify the claimed [[nationality]] of people seeking asylum who do not hold the necessary documentation to prove their claim.&lt;ref name="Linguistic Analysis"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Applied Linguistics and Language Analysis in Asylum Seeker Cases | last=Eades | first=Diana | journal=Applied Linguistics | year=2005 | volume=26 | issue=4 | pages=503–526 | doi=10.1093/applin/ami021 | url=http://songchau.googlepages.com/503.pdf | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; This often takes the form of an [[interview]] by personnel in an immigration department. Depending on the country, this interview is conducted either in the asylum seeker's [[native language]] through an [[language interpretation|interpreter]] or in an international ''[[lingua franca]]'' like English.&lt;ref name="Linguistic Analysis"/&gt; Australia uses the former method, while Germany employs the latter; the Netherlands uses either method depending on the languages involved.&lt;ref name="Linguistic Analysis"/&gt; Tape recordings of the interview then undergo language analysis, which can be done either by private contractors or within a department of the government. In this analysis, linguistic features of the asylum seeker are used by analysts to make a determination about the speaker's nationality. The reported findings of the linguistic analysis can play a critical role in the government's decision on the refugee status of the asylum seeker.&lt;ref name="Linguistic Analysis"/&gt;

==Interdisciplinary fields==
Within the broad discipline of linguistics, various emerging sub-disciplines focus on a more detailed description and analysis of language, and are often organized on the basis of the school of thought and theoretical approach that they pre-suppose, or the external factors that influence them.

===Semiotics===
[[Semiotics]] is the study of sign processes (semiosis), or signification and communication, signs, and symbols, both individually and grouped into sign systems, including the study of how meaning is constructed and understood. Semioticians often do not restrict themselves to linguistic communication when studying the use of signs but extend the meaning of "sign" to cover all kinds of cultural symbols. Nonetheless, semiotic disciplines closely related to linguistics are [[literary studies]], [[discourse analysis]], [[text linguistics]], and [[philosophy of language]]. Semiotics, within the linguistics paradigm, is the study of the relationship between language and culture. Historically, [[Edward Sapir]] and [[Ferdinand De Saussure]]'s structuralist theories influenced the study of signs extensively until the late part of the 20th century, but later, post-modern and post-structural thought, through language philosophers including [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], [[Michel Foucault]], and others, have also been a considerable influence on the discipline in the late part of the 20th century and early 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Classical Roots of Post-Structuralism: Lacan, Derrida and Foucault |journal=International Journal of the Classical Tradition  |first= Paul Allen |last=Miller |publisher=Springer |year=1998 |jstor=30222818|ref=harv|volume=5 |issue=2  |pages=204–225 |doi=10.1007/bf02688423}}&lt;/ref&gt; These theories emphasize the role of language variation, and the idea of subjective usage, depending on external elements like social and cultural factors, rather than merely on the interplay of formal elements.

===Language documentation===
Since the inception of the discipline of linguistics, linguists have been concerned with describing and analysing previously [[language documentation|undocumented languages]]. Starting with [[Franz Boas]] in the early 1900s, this became the main focus of American linguistics until the rise of formal structural linguistics in the mid-20th century. This focus on language documentation was partly motivated by a concern to document the rapidly [[language death|disappearing]] languages of indigenous peoples. The ethnographic dimension of the Boasian approach to language description played a role in the development of disciplines such as [[sociolinguistics]], [[anthropological linguistics]], and [[linguistic anthropology]], which investigate the relations between language, culture, and society.

The emphasis on linguistic description and documentation has also gained prominence outside North America, with the documentation of rapidly dying indigenous languages becoming a primary focus in many university programmes in linguistics. Language description is a work-intensive endeavour, usually requiring years of field work in the language concerned, so as to equip the linguist to write a sufficiently accurate reference grammar. Further, the task of documentation requires the linguist to collect a substantial corpus in the language in question, consisting of texts and recordings, both sound and video, which can be stored in an accessible format within open repositories, and used for further research.&lt;ref&gt;Himmelman, Nikolaus "Language documentation: What is it and what is it good for?" in P. Gippert, Jost, Nikolaus P Himmelmann &amp; Ulrike Mosel. (2006) ''Essentials of Language documentation''. Mouton de Gruyter, Berlin &amp; New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Translation===
The sub-field of [[translation]] includes the translation of written and spoken texts across mediums, from digital to print and spoken. To translate literally means to transmute the meaning from one language into another. Translators are often employed by organizations, such as travel agencies as well as governmental embassies to facilitate communication between two speakers who do not know each other's language. Translators are also employed to work within [[computational linguistics]] setups like [[Google Translate]] for example, which is an automated, programmed facility to translate words and phrases between any two or more given languages. Translation is also conducted by publishing houses, which convert works of writing from one language to another in order to reach varied audiences. Academic Translators, specialize and semi specialize on various other disciplines such as; Technology, Science, Law, Economics etc.

===Biolinguistics===
[[Biolinguistics]] is the study of the biology and evolution of language. It is a highly interdisciplinary field, including linguists, biologists, neuroscientists, psychologists, mathematicians, and others. By shifting the focus of investigation in linguistics to a comprehensive scheme that embraces natural sciences, it seeks to yield a framework by which the fundamentals of the faculty of language are understood.

===Clinical linguistics===
Clinical linguistics is the application of linguistic theory to the fields of [[Speech-Language Pathology]]. Speech language pathologists work on corrective measures to cure [[communication disorders]] and swallowing disorders

Chaika (1990) showed that people with schizophrenia who display speech disorders, like rhyming inappropriately, have attentional dysfunction, as when a patient, shown a colour chip and then asked to identify it, responded "looks like clay. Sounds like gray. Take you for a roll in the hay. Heyday, May Day." The color chip was actually clay-colored, so his first response was correct.'

However, most people suppress or ignore words which rhyme with what they've said unless they are deliberately producing a pun, poem or rap. Even then, the speaker shows connection between words chosen for rhyme and an overall meaning in discourse. People with schizophrenia with speech dysfunction show no such relation between rhyme and reason. Some even produce stretches of gibberish combined with recognizable words.&lt;ref&gt;Chaika, Elaine Ostrach. 1990. Understanding Psychotic Speech: Between Freud and Chomsky. Chas. Thomas Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computational linguistics===
[[Computational linguistics]] is the study of linguistic issues in a way that is "computationally responsible", i.e., taking careful note of computational consideration of algorithmic specification and computational complexity, so that the linguistic theories devised can be shown to exhibit certain desirable computational properties and their implementations. Computational linguists also work on computer language and software development.

===Evolutionary linguistics===
[[Evolutionary linguistics]] is the interdisciplinary study of the emergence of the language faculty through [[human evolution]], and also the application of [[evolution|evolutionary theory]] to the study of cultural evolution among different languages. It is also a study of the dispersal of various languages across the globe, through movements among ancient communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Croft | first = William |date=October 2008 | title = Evolutionary Linguistics | journal = Annual Review of Anthropology | volume = 37 | pages = 219–234  | publisher = Annual Reviews | doi = 10.1146/annurev.anthro.37.081407.085156 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forensic linguistics===
[[Forensic linguistics]] is the application of linguistic analysis to [[forensics]]. Forensic analysis investigates on the style, language, lexical use, and other linguistic and grammatical features used in the legal context to provide evidence in courts of law. Forensic linguists have also contributed expertise in criminal cases.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="94241">The United States government established planning organizations to provide for the coordination of land use, transportation and infrastructure. These Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPO) may exist as a separate, independent organization or they may be administered by a city, county, [[regional planning organization]], highway commission or other government organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Regional Councils, COGs &amp; MPOs|url=http://narc.org/about-narc/cogs-mpos/|website=National Association of Regional Councils|accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each MPO has its own structure and governance. The following is a list of the current federally designated MPOs.

[[File:MARPOL 73-78 signatories.png|thumb|MARPOL 73/78 ratifying states]]
The '''International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973 as modified by the Protocol of 1978''' ('''MARPOL 73/78''', MARPOL is short for [[marine pollution]] and 73/78 short for the years 1973 and 1978) is one of the most important international marine [[international environmental law|environmental conventions]]. It was developed by the [[International Maritime Organization]] in an effort to minimize pollution of the oceans and seas, including [[marine debris|dumping]], oil and air pollution.  The objective of this convention is to preserve the marine environment in an attempt to completely eliminate pollution by oil and other harmful substances and to minimize accidental spillage of such substances.

The original MARPOL was signed on 17 February 1973, but did not come into force at the signing date. The current convention is a combination of 1973 Convention and the 1978 Protocol,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Chronology &amp; Search|url = http://www.martinottaway.com/technical-documents/MAX1-Studies/chronology|website = MAX1 Studies|accessdate = 2015-07-15|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304185609/http://www.martinottaway.com/technical-documents/MAX1-Studies/chronology|archivedate = 4 March 2016|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which entered into force on 2 October 1983. As of January 2018, 156 states are parties to the convention, being [[flag state]]s of 99.42% of the world's shipping tonnage.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imo.org/en/About/Conventions/StatusOfConventions/Documents/StatusOfTreaties.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

All ships flagged under countries that are signatories to MARPOL are subject to its requirements, regardless of where they sail and member nations are responsible for vessels registered on their national ship registry.&lt;ref name=crs&gt;Copeland, Claudia.

==Provisions ==
MARPOL is divided into Annexes according to various categories of pollutants, each of which deals with the regulation of a particular group of ship emissions.

=== Annex I ===
[[Marpol Annex I|MARPOL Annex I]] came into force on 2 October 1983 and deals with discharge of oil into the ocean environment.  It incorporates the oil discharge criteria prescribed in the 1969 amendments to the 1954 [[International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil]] (OILPOL). It specifies tanker design features that are intended to minimize oil discharge into the ocean during ship operations and in case of accidents. It provides regulations with regard to treatment of engine room bilge water ([[Oily Water Separator (marine)|OWS]]) for all large commercial vessels and ballast and tank cleaning waste ([[Oil Discharge Monitoring Equipment|ODME]]). It also introduces the concept of "special sea areas (PPSE)" which are considered to be at risk to pollution by oil.  Discharge of oil within them has been completely outlawed, with a few minimal exceptions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.imo.org/KnowledgeCentre/ReferencesAndArchives/HistoryofMARPOL/Documents/MARPOL%2073-78%20Brief%20History%20-%20List%20of%20amendments%20and%20how%20to%20find%20them.htm|title = MARPOL73-78:  Brief history - list of amendments to date and where to find them|date = 2012|accessdate = 3 June 2015|website = MARPOL73-78:  Brief history - list of amendments to date and where to find them|publisher = IMO|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first half of [[Marpol Annex I|MARPOL Annex I]] deals with engine room waste. There are various generations of technologies and equipment that have been developed to prevent waste such as: [[Oily Water Separators|Oily water separators]] (OWS), [[Oil content meter|Oil Content meters]] (OCM), and [[Port Reception Facilities]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL)|url = http://www.imo.org/en/About/Conventions/ListOfConventions/Pages/International-Convention-for-the-Prevention-of-Pollution-from-Ships-(MARPOL).aspx|website = www.imo.org|accessdate = 2015-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second part of the [[Marpol Annex I|MARPOL Annex I]] has more to do with cleaning the cargo areas and tanks. [[Oil Discharge Monitoring Equipment]] (ODME) is a very important technology mentioned in [[Marpol Annex I|MARPOL Annex I]] that has greatly helped improve sanitation in these areas.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The [[Oil record book|Oil Record Book]] is another integral part of [[Marpol Annex I|MARPOL Annex I]].  The [[Oil record book|Oil Record Book]] helps crew members log and keep track of oily waste water discharges among other things.

=== Annex II === 
MARPOL Annex II came into force on 6 April 1987. It details the discharge criteria for the elimination of pollution by noxious liquid substances carried in large quantities. It divides substances into and introduces detailed operational standards and measures. The discharge of pollutants is allowed only to reception facilities with certain concentrations and conditions. No matter what, no discharge of residues containing pollutants is permitted within 12 miles of the nearest land. Stricter restrictions apply to "special areas".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Annex II covers the International Bulk Chemical Code (IBC Code) in conjunction with Chapter 7 of the [[SOLAS Convention]]. Previously, chemical tankers constructed before {{dts|1 July 1986}} must comply with the requirements of the Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Dangerous Chemicals in Bulk (BCH Code).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IBC Code|url=http://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Safety/Cargoes/CargoesInBulk/Pages/IBC-Code.aspx|website=www.imo.org|accessdate=2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Annex III ===
MARPOL Annex III came into force on 1 July 1992.  It contains general requirements for the standards on packing, marking, labeling, documentation, stowage, quantity subtraction, division and notifications for preventing pollution by harmful substances. The Annex is in line with the procedures detailed in the International Maritime Dangerous Goods (IMDG) Code, which has been expanded to include marine pollutants. The amendments entered into force on 1 January 1991.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Annex IV ===
Marpol Annex IV came into force on 27 September 2003.  It introduces requirements to control pollution of the sea by sewage from ships.

=== Annex V ===
MARPOL Annex V (''Regulations for the Prevention of Pollution by Garbage from Ships'') came into force on 31 December 1988.  It specifies the distances from land in which materials may be disposed of and subdivides different types of garbage and marine debris. The requirements are much stricter in a number of "special areas" but perhaps the most prominent part of the Annex is the complete ban of [[Ocean dumping|dumping]] plastic into the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/environment/pollutionprevention/garbage/Pages/Default.aspx|title=Garbage|website=www.imo.org|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Annex VI ===
MARPOL Annex VI came into force on 19 May 2005.  It introduces requirements to regulate the air pollution being emitted by ships, including the emission of ozone-depleting substances, [[NOx|Nitrogen Oxides (NOx)]], [[Sulfur oxide|Sulphur Oxides (SOx)]], [[Volatile organic compound|Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)]] and shipboard incineration. It also establishes requirements for reception facilities for wastes from exhaust gas cleaning systems, incinerators, fuel oil quality, for off-shore platforms and drilling rigs and for the establishment of [[Sulphur Emission Control Area|SOx Emission Control Areas (SECAs)]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Amendments==

MARPOL Annex VI amendments according with [http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090707061408/http://www.imo.org/includes/blastDataOnly.asp/data_id%3D23760/176%2858%29.pdf MEPC 176(58)] came into force 1 July 2010.

Amended [https://web.archive.org/web/20100522170617/http://www.ancomaritime.com/files/Ozone_Depleting_Substances_Marpol_Regulation_12.html Regulations 12] concerns control and record keeping of Ozone Depleting Substances.

Amended [https://web.archive.org/web/20100522170546/http://www.ancomaritime.com/files/Fuel_Oil_Change_over_procedures%20.html Regulation 14] concerns mandatory fuel oil change over procedures for vessels entering or leaving [[Sulphur Emission Control Area|SECA]] areas and FO sulphur limits.

MARPOL Annex V has been amended multiple times, changing different aspects of the original text. 

[http://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Environment/PollutionPrevention/Garbage/Documents/2014%20revision/RESOLUTION%20MEPC.220(63)%20Guidelines%20for%20the%20Development%20of%20Garbage%20Management%20Plans.pdf MEPC.219(63)] came into force on 2 March 2012 to generally prohibit the discharge of any garbage into the ocean, with the exception of food wastes, cargo residues, wash-water, and animal carcasses. There are further provisions describing when and how to dispose of the acceptable wastes.

[http://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Environment/PollutionPrevention/Garbage/Documents/2014%20revision/RESOLUTION%20MEPC.220(63)%20Guidelines%20for%20the%20Development%20of%20Garbage%20Management%20Plans.pdf MEPC.220(63)] came into force on 2 March 2012 to encourage the creation of a waste management plan on-board vessels.

==Implementation and enforcement==
In order for [[International Maritime Organization|IMO]] standards to be binding, they must first be ratified by a total number of member countries whose combined [[gross tonnage]] represents at least 50% of the world's gross tonnage, a process that can be lengthy.  A system of tacit acceptance has therefore been put into place, whereby if no objections are heard from a member state after a certain period has elapsed, it is assumed they have assented to the treaty.

All six Annexes have been ratified by the requisite number of nations; the most recent is Annex VI, which took effect in May 2005. The country where a ship is registered ([[Flag State]]) is responsible for certifying the ship's compliance with MARPOL's [[pollution prevention]] standards. Each signatory nation is responsible for enacting [[municipal law|domestic laws]] to implement the convention and effectively pledges to comply with the convention, annexes, and related laws of other nations.  In the United States, for example, the relevant implementation legislation is the [[Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships]].

One of the difficulties in implementing MARPOL arises from the very international nature of maritime shipping. The country that the ship visits can conduct its own examination to verify a ship's compliance with [[international standard]]s and can detain the ship if it finds significant [[regulatory compliance|noncompliance]]. When incidents occur outside such country's jurisdiction or jurisdiction cannot be determined, the country refers cases to flag states, in accordance with MARPOL. A 2000 US [[Government Accountability Office|GAO]] report documented that even when referrals have been made, the response rate from flag states has been poor.&lt;ref name="U.S. GAO, 2000 Report"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Office|first1=U. S. Government Accountability|title=Marine Pollution: Progress Made to Reduce Marine Pollution by Cruise Ships, but Important Issues Remain|date=March 7, 2000|issue=RCED-00-48|page=20|url=http://www.gao.gov/new.items/rc00048.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306150933/http://www.gao.gov/new.items/rc00048.pdf|archivedate=6 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 1, 2015, maritime shipping levels became legally subject to new MARPOL directives because the SECA (Sulphur Emission Controlled Areas) zone increased in size. This larger SECA zone will include the North Sea, Scandinavia, and parts of the English Channel. This area is set to include all of the Republic of Ireland's international waters in 2020 culminating in all of Western Europe's subjection to the MARPOL directive. This has proven controversial for shipping and ferry operators across Europe.

Concerns have been raised about the environmental damage moving back to the roads by some of the larger ferry operators that ship substantial amounts of freight and passenger traffic via these routes affected by IMO standards. They claim that MARPOL will drive up ferry costs for the consumer and freight forwarding companies pushing them back onto the European roadways as a financially more cost effective measure compared to increased ferry costs, thereby defeating the object of reducing water pollution.&lt;ref name="Freightlink"&gt;[https://www.freightlink.co.uk/knowledge/articles/what-marpol-and-its-impact-freight-market What is MARPOL and its impact to the freight market?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028234749/https://www.freightlink.co.uk/knowledge/articles/what-marpol-and-its-impact-freight-market |date=28 October 2014 }}, www.freightlink.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

The MOS protocol is based on [[XML]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Qureshi |first=Rizwan |url=http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/34527/MOS-Protocol-Fundamentals |title=MOS Protocol Fundamentals – CodeProject® |publisher=Codeproject.com |date=2009-04-01 |accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It enables the exchange of the following types of messages:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mosprotocol.com/mos_faq.htm#what_does_MOS_do |title=Mos Faq |publisher=Mosprotocol.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Descriptive Data for Media Objects. : The MOS "pushes" descriptive information and pointers to the NCS as objects are created, modified, or deleted in the MOS.  This allows the NCS to be "aware" of the contents of the MOS and enables the NCS to perform searches on and manipulate the data the MOS has sent.
; Playlist Exchange. : The NCS can build and transfer playlist information to the MOS.  This allows the NCS to control the sequence that media objects are played or presented by the MOS.
; Status Exchange. : The MOS can inform the NCS of the status of specific clips or the MOS system in general.  The NCS can notify the MOS of the status of specific playlist items or running orders.

MOS was developed to reduce the need for the development of [[Device driver|device specific drivers]]. By allowing developers to embed functionality and handle events, vendors were relieved of the burden of developing device drivers. It was left to the manufacturers to interface newsroom computer systems. This approach affords broadcasters flexibility to purchase equipment from multiple vendors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsmaker.us/TheMOSStory.html |title=Newsmaker |publisher=Newsmaker.us |date= |accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also limits the need to have [[Computer operator|operators]] in multiple locations throughout the studio as, for example, multiple [[character generator]]s (CG) can be fired from a single control [[workstation]], without needing an operator at each CG console.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/topic/Media_Object_Server |title=Media Object Server – eNotes.com Reference |publisher=Enotes.com |date=2002-03-21 |accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MOS enables [[journalists]] to see, use, and control media devices inside [[Associated Press]]'s [[ENPS]] system so that individual pieces of newsroom [[Video production|production]] technology speak a common [[XML]]-based language.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|author=WGN-TV, Chicago, Illinois, USA |url=http://www.enps.com/pages/enps_integration/what_is_mos |title=ENPS and MOS |publisher=Enps.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of MOS ==

The first meeting of the MOS protocol development group occurred at the [[Associated Press]] [[ENPS]] developer's conference in [[Orlando, Florida]] in 1998. The fundamental concepts of MOS were released to the public domain at that conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mosprotocol.com/mos_faq.htm#MOS_group |title=Mos Faq |publisher=Mosprotocol.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an [[open protocol]], the MOS Development Group encourages the participation of broadcast equipment vendors and their customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mosprotocol.com/how_to_participate_in_mos.htm |title=How to Participate in MOS |publisher=Mosprotocol.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927040738/http://www.mosprotocol.com/how_to_participate_in_mos.htm |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 100 companies are said to work with AP on MOS-related projects. Compatible hardware and software includes [[video editing]], [[File server|storage]] and [[Content management system|management]]; [[Broadcast automation|automation]]; machine control; [[Teleprompter|prompters]]; character generators; [[Digital audio editor|audio editing]], store and management; [[web publishing]], [[Interactive television|interactive TV]], [[Electronic field production|field transmission]] and [[Motion graphics|graphics]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

Current development is happening on two tracks: a [[Network socket|socket-based]] version, and a [[web service]] version. The current official versions of the MOS protocol, as of January 2011, are 2.8.4 (sockets) and 3.8.4 (web service).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mosprotocol.com/MOS%20Files/2.8.4/MOS_Protocol_Version_2.8.4.htm |title=MOS Protocol 2.8.4 (Current) |publisher=Mosprotocol.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 proposals began to introduce IP Video support in the MOS protocol. This proposal allows representations of live IP Video sources such as NDI ([[Network Device Interface]]) to be included as MOS objects alongside MOS objects representing files to be played off disk&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sienna-tv.com/ndi/ndimonitor.html|title=NDIMonitor|website=www.sienna-tv.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a [[Java (programming language)|Java]] based implementation called jmos that is currently compatible with MOS specification 2.8.2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://code.google.com/p/jmos/ |title=jmos – Open java implementation for Media Object Server Communications Protocol (MOS) – Google Project Hosting |publisher=Code.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences awarded an Emmy to the MOS Group for "Development and Standardization of Media Object Server (MOS) Protocol."&lt;ref&gt;http://mosprotocol.com/forums/topic/mos-emmy-statues-nominations-and-voting/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Building commissioning (Cx)''' is the process of verifying, in new construction, all (or some, depending on scope) of the subsystems for [[mechanical, electrical, and plumbing|mechanical (HVAC), plumbing, electrical]], fire/life safety, [[building envelope]]s, interior systems (example laboratory units), co-generation, utility plants, sustainable systems, lighting, wastewater, controls, and building security to achieve the owner's project requirements as intended by the building owner and as designed by the building architects and engineers.  Recommissioning is the methodical process of testing and adjusting the aforementioned systems in existing buildings.

Building commissioning is a quality-focused process necessary for both non-complex and complex modern [[construction]] projects.  Normally the initial commissioning team and a team leader (typically known as the commissioning authority or CxA) is involved from project initiation through one year of occupancy.  In many cases and ideally, there is an ongoing building enhancing and commissioning program and team for the life of the building. While the service method can vary from owner to owner and project to project, the basic formula for a successful building commissioning process involves a synergy team from pre-design to develop the owner's project requirements (OPR), commissioning scope and plan, including benchmarks for success, review of design documents and checklists for achieving the Owner's Project Requirements (OPR), development of checklists and verifying a sample of construction checklists and submittals, developing training needs and evaluating training delivered by the contractors, witnessing and verifying construction phase tests, and periodic site observations during the construction phase, and performing commissioning functional testing as the project nears completion.  While the practice of building commissioning process is still fairly new in the construction industry, it has quickly become common practice as building owners and developers try to get more out of their investment.  The commissioning process main goal is to improve a project from the design phase through post construction and occupancy.

== Commissioning authority/agent (CxA) ==

The commissioning authority or commissioning agent (CxA) is generally (and preferably) contracted directly to the building owner to ensure unbiased performance of the CxA.  The CxA may be a subcontractor (or employee) of the building owner, architect, design engineer, test and balance contractor, or other trade contractor (i.e. [[mechanical, electrical, and plumbing|HVAC/mechanical, electrical, Plumbing]], fire protection, security, etc.) for specific trade testing.  It is recommended that the CxA be contracted early in the project planning stages, included in design charrettes, and maintained throughout the design, construction, and final acceptance of the project at a minimum.  Having the CxA on the team early provides opportunity to identify possible operation, installation, testing, and performance issues long before they become a construction issue.  The CxA works closely with the owner's representative, building/facility operating engineer, architect, design engineer, general contractor, and all trade subcontractors.  The CxA typically is responsible for leading and managing the project commission process (design and/or construction) and works closely with the design, construction, and operation teams in a co-operative work environment that focuses on teamwork throughout the building's design, construction, and post construction.

A CxA's ability to add value to a project is rooted in their ability to create positive working relationships with all parties involved and not pointing fingers when issues arise.  It is important that the CxA clearly identifies the communication processes/streams, the project goals and expectations (from the OPR), and the team member responsibilities.  A CxA has to be able to give open constructive criticism while also being able to listen attentively.  The CxA's primary goal is to provide a completed and properly operating product to the building owner and occupant/user.

The CxA's work and performance of service is equally or primarily in the background performing design, submittal, O&amp;M Manual reviews and development of testing and commissioning processes for the project, as well as documenting the commissioning efforts.  The CxA attends design and construction meetings, performs site construction observations, observes factory equipment testing, directs and observes functional performance testing of systems and equipment.  The CxA typically does not actually perform the hands-on testing, as these are actually performed by the manufacturer, vendor, or trade contractors, and directed and observed by the CxA utilizing testing procedures and expected performance outcome previously identified by the CxA during the commissioning document development process.

The CxA typically prepares a commissioning specification and commissioning plan during the project design phase.  The design engineer also may develop the commissioning specification (and rarely the commissioning plan) in situations where the CxA has not been so contracted, or brought into the design team during the design process.  The commissioning plan is a live document that outlines the commissioning processes and expectation based on the Owner's OPR, the design engineer's basis of design (BOD) and the project construction document (drawings and specifications).  The commissioning plan is modified as the commissioning process progresses throughout the design, construction, and final acceptance of the facility.  The functional performance test procedures are typically developed by the CxA with assistance of the trade contractors, vendors, and manufacturers based on the design engineer's contract documents.  These same parties and the design engineer, and owner's representative (typically the facility operating engineer) review the functional performance test procedures and expected outcomes prior to testing.  The systems, equipment, items, processes, modes, and sequences of operations to be tested by the CxA (contractors or others) should be detailed and identified in the design engineer's construction documents (drawings and specifications), the construction request for proposal (RFP), the contractors bid submission, the commissioning specifications, the commissioning plan, and the contractors submittals.  Of utmost importance, often neglected by contractors, are the equipment/systems "installation and operations manuals" (IOM or IO&amp;M) "specific to the project" (not generic).  The IOM's along with complete, and very detailed, sequence of operations (SOO) and control drawings/documents submittal "specific to the project" (not generic) are of utmost importance to the CxA to perform the review and develop proper testing procedures.  Timely delivery of these documents to the CxA is important to facilitate the CxA ample time to review, develop test, obtain reviews, and implement changes prior to scheduling of any testing.

== Building management Systems (BMS) or Building Automation Systems (BAS) ==

[[Building management system]]s (BMS) or [[building automation]] systems (BAS) provide control of the building systems.  These typically include heating, ventilating, air-conditioning and refrigeration (HVAC/R), electrical power, lighting, fire suppression and alarm, and security systems, etc.  Building controls also have the ability to monitor and control systems to improve performance, conserve energy, conserve water, and control lighting.  The greater control provides the ability to improve a buildings performance, environmental impact, and the user/occupant's environment.  Direct digital controls (DDC) with real time monitoring and history provide the ability to acquire system data realtime or with trend-logging, or trending, (over a predetermined period of time) to observe performance, issues/troubles, and identify possible improvements to operations and maintenance.

Building systems and equipment (HVAC, electrical, etc.) operate via the control systems (BAS, BMS, and similar) based on a designed sequence of operations (SOO) typically developed by the design engineer (specification) and modified during the submittal process by the trade contractors (and reviewed and approved by the design engineer). This SOO is also reviewed by the CxA who utilizes the SOO to develop the functional performance test procedures. The functional performance test procedures are typically developed by the CxA with assistance of the trade contractors, vendors, and manufacturers, reviewed by same, and the design engineer. The systems, equipment, items, processes, modes, and sequences of operations to be tested by the CxA (contractors or others) should be detailed and identified in the design engineer's construction documents (drawings and specifications), the construction request for proposal (RFP), the contractors bid submission, and the commissioning specifications and commissioning plan. The commissioning specification and commissioning plan are typically developed by the CxA during the design phase of the project.

The CxA works closely with the controls contractor to verify the control programming and identifies corrective issues during reviews and the functional performance testing. By performing the functional performance testing it is often, if not always, found where there are difficiencies in the systems or control and identifies items for improvement. Each and every point and sequence is typically not required to be tested by the CxA. The contractors typically hold the responsibility of testing and verifying each and every point and sequence, and the CxA performs a test of a sample of the items after the contractors have tested, repaired and verified. Re-Testing of the same, or another sampling, by the CxA is often required to re-verify deficiencies identified during the initial testing.

The integrated operations and performance of the many building systems such as HVAC, life/fire safety, domestic water, power, CO2 ventilation, and similar provide a complex and important performance for the facility and its occupants. Functional performance testing to verify proper operation prior to occupancy it extremely important. Testing of existing facilities is performed similarly by recommissioning (commissioning of a building/system/equipment that has been previously commissioned) and retro-commissioning (commissioning of an existing building/system/equipment that has not been previously commissioned). Assurance of performance and operation by the CxA's commissioning verification of the facility typically provides a better operating, performing, and comfortable environment for the owner and occupants.

== System degradation ==

It is estimated by Texas A&amp;M researchers that as much as 20%&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://esl.tamu.edu/continuous-commissioning# |title=Texas A&amp;M System Energy Systems Lab – Continuous Commissioning&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2013-07-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026054157/http://esl.tamu.edu/continuous-commissioning# |archive-date=2013-10-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the energy used in an average commercial building is waste associated with poorly operated systems.

Buildings systems underperform for several reasons:
# They were never properly configured
# The design did not account for all sources of building efficiency
# The building is not properly maintained
# The use of the building has changed over time

== Commissioning authority or commissioning agent (CxA) ==
{{Original research|section|date=July 2014}}To provide any benefit, the facility, systems, and equipment must be thoroughly designed, submitted to, and approved by a responsible, thorough, professional architectural and engineering design team to function correctly. The design team incorporates the documented owner's program of requirements (OPR) which identifies the owner's systems, equipment, materials, control, and performance expectations. The design team identifies and documents the project basis of design (BOD) which specifically identifies the OPR items, how each was implemented in the design (or modified), and the final design basis for systems, equipment, materials, control, and performance expectations.

The fast-track nature of the design and construction process (experience in 2011) often leads to missed planning, design, and even construction items.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} Items missed during the design and construction process can often be identified by the CxA during development of the functional and performance test procedures or during functional and performance tests.

The commissioning team, led by the CxA, has a primary objective of verifying proper installation, operation, and performance based on the project design (BOD) and the OPR. The commissioning of the facility, systems, and/or equipment provides verification, identifies issues and discrepancies, and if designed and constructed properly, ultimately enhances the facility total quality, control, performance, and efficiency which in turn provides increased sustainability.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21271">'''New Public Management''' (NPM) is an approach to running [[public service]] organizations that is used in government and public service institutions and agencies, at both sub-national and national levels. The term was first introduced by academics in the UK and Australia &lt;ref&gt;Hood 1991 and Hood and Jackson 1991&lt;/ref&gt; to describe approaches that were developed during the 1980s as part of an effort to make the public service more "businesslike" and to improve its efficiency by using private sector management models. As with the private sector, which focuses on "[[customer service]]", NPM reforms often focused on the "...centrality of citizens who were the recipient of the services or customers to the public sector." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.managementstudyguide.com/new-public-management.htm | title=New Public Management Model}}&lt;/ref&gt; NPM reformers experimented with using decentralized service delivery models, to give local agencies more freedom in how they delivered programs or services. In some cases, NPM reforms that used [[e-government]] consolidated a program or service to a central location to reduce costs. Some governments tried using [[quasi-market]] structures, so that the public sector would have to compete against the private sector (notably in the UK, in [[health care]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.managementstudyguide.com/new-public-management.htm | title=New Public Management Model}}&lt;/ref&gt; Key themes in NPM were "...financial control, value for money, increasing efficiency...,identifying and setting targets and continuance monitoring of performance, handing over.. power to the senior management" [[Senior management|executives]]. Performance was assessed with audits, benchmarks and performance evaluations. Some NPM reforms used private sector companies to deliver what were formerly public services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.managementstudyguide.com/new-public-management.htm | title=New Public Management Model}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NPM advocates in some countries worked to remove "...collective agreements [in favour of]...individual rewards packages at senior levels combined with short term contracts" and introduce private sector-style [[corporate governance]], including using a [[Board of Directors]] approach to strategic guidance for public organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.managementstudyguide.com/new-public-management.htm | title=New Public Management Model}}&lt;/ref&gt; While NPM approaches have been used in many countries around the world, NPM is particularly associated with the most industrialized [[OECD]] nations such as the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]] and the [[United States of America]]. NPM advocates focus on using approaches from the private sector–the [[corporation|corporate]] or business world–which can be successfully applied in the public sector and in a [[public administration]] context. NPM approaches have been used to reform the public sector, its policies and its programs. NPM advocates claim that it is a more efficient and effective means of attaining the same outcome. 

In NPM, citizens are viewed as "customers" and public servants are viewed as public managers. NPM tries to realign the relationship between public service managers and their political superiors by making a parallel relationship between the two. Under NPM, public managers have incentive-based motivation such as pay-for-performance, and clear performance targets are often set, which are assessed by using [[performance evaluation]]s. As well, managers in an NPM paradigm may have greater discretion and freedom as to how they go about achieving the goals set for them. This NPM approach is contrasted with the traditional [[public administration]] model, in which institutional decision-making, policy-making and public service delivery is guided by regulations, legislation and [[administrative law|administrative procedures]]. 

NPM reforms use approaches such as disaggregation, customer satisfaction initiatives, [[customer service]] efforts, applying an [[entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial spirit]] to public service, and [[innovation|introducing innovations]]. The NPM system allows "the expert manager to have a greater discretion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farazmand|first1=Ali|title=New Public Management|journal=Handbook of Globalization, Governance, and Public Administration|date=Feb 2, 2006|pages=888}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barzelay|title=The New Public Management: Improving Research and Policy Dialogue|date=2001|publisher=Russell Sage Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Public Managers under the New Public Management reforms can provide a range of choices from which customers can choose, including the right to opt out of the service delivery system completely".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kaboolian|first1=Linda|title=The New Public Management: Challenging the Boundaries of the Management vs. Administration Debate|date=1998|publisher=Public Administration Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The first practices of New Public Management emerged in the United Kingdom under the leadership of Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]]. Thatcher played the functional role of “policy entrepreneur" and the official role of prime minister.{{fact|date=November 2016}} Thatcher drove changes in public management policy in such areas as organizational methods, civil service, labor relations, expenditure planning, financial management, audit, evaluation, and procurement. Thatcher's successor, [[John Major]], kept public management policy on the agenda of the Conservative government, leading to the implementation of the Next Steps Initiative. Major also launched the programs of the Citizens Charter Initiative, Competing for Quality, Resource Accounting and Budgeting, and the Private Finance Initiative.

A term was coined in the late 1980s to denote a new (or renewed) focus on the importance of management and ‘production engineering’ in public service delivery, which often linked to doctrines of economic rationalism (Hood 1989, Pollitt 1993). During this timeframe public management became an active area of policy-making in numerous other countries, notably in New Zealand, Australia, and Sweden.  At the same time, [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ]] (OECD) established its Public Management Committee and Secretariat (PUMA), conferring to public management the status normally accorded more conventional domains of policy. In the 1990s, public management was a major item on President [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]]’s agenda. Early policy actions of the Clinton administration included launching the [[National Partnership for Reinventing Government|National Partnership]] and signing into law the [[Government Performance and Results Act]]. Currently there are few indications that public management issues will vanish from governmental policy agendas. A recent study showed that in Italy, municipal directors are aware of a public administration now being oriented toward new public management where they are assessed according to the results they produce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marozzi|first1=Marco|last2=Bolzan|first2=Mario|title=Skills and training requirements of municipal directors: A statistical assessment|journal=Quality and Quantity|volume=50|issue=3|pages=1093–1115|date=2015|doi=10.1007/s11135-015-0192-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term New Public Management (NPM) expresses the idea that the cumulative flow of policy decisions over the past twenty years has amounted to a substantial shift in the governance and management of the “state sector” in the [[United Kingdom]], [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]], [[Scandinavia]], and [[North America]]. A benign interpretation is that these decisions have been a defensible, if imperfect, response to policy problems. Those problems as well as their solutions were formulated within the policy-making process. The agenda-setting process has been heavily influenced by electoral commitments to improve macro- economic performance and to contain growth in the public sector, as well as by a growing perception of public bureaucracies as being inefficient. The alternative-generation process has been heavily influenced by ideas coming from economics and from various quarters within the field of management.

== Globalization ==
Although the origins of NPM came from Westernized countries it expanded to a variety of other countries in the 1990s. Before the 1990s, NPM was largely associated to an idea utilized by developed countries that are particularly Anglo-Saxon. However the 1990s have seen countries in Africa, Asia and other countries looking into using this method. In Africa, downsizing and decrease of user fees have been widely introduced. These autonomous agencies within the public sectors have been established in these areas. Performance contracting became a common policy in crisis states worldwide. Contracting out of this magnitude can be used to do things such as waste management, cleaning, laundry, catering and road maintenance.

== Aspects  ==

NPM was accepted as the "gold standard for administrative reform"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farazmand|first1=Ali|title=New Public Management: Theory, Ideology, and Practice|journal=Handbook of Globalization, Governance and Public Administration|date=Jan 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1990s. The idea for using this method for government reform was that if the government guided private-sector principles were used rather than rigid hierarchical bureaucracy, it would work more efficiently. NPM promotes a shift from bureaucratic administration to business-like professional management. NPM was cited as the solution for management ills in various organizational context and policy making in education and health care reform.

The basic principles of NPM is can best be described when split into seven different aspects elaborated by Christopher Hood in 1991. Hood also invented the term NPM itself. &lt;ref&gt;in "A Public Management for all seasons?", Public Administration Review, Voæl 69, Spring1991 (3-19).&lt;/ref&gt; They are the following:

=== Management ===
Because of its belief in the importance and strength of privatizing government, it is critical to have an emphasis on management by engaging in hands-on methods. This theory allows leaders the freedom to manage freely and open up discretion.

=== Performance standards ===
Its important to maintain explicit standards and measures of performance in a workforce. Using this method promotes clarification of goals/intent, targets, and indicators for progression.

=== Output controls ===
The third point acknowledges the "shift from the use of input controls and bureaucratic procedures to rules relying on output controls measured by quantitive performance indicators".&lt;ref&gt;Yamaoto, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; This aspect requires using performance based assessments when looking to outsource work to private companies/groups.

=== Decentralization ===
NPM advocates often shifted from a unified management system to a decentralized system in which managers gain flexibility and are not limited to agency restrictions.

=== Competition ===
This characteristic focuses on how NPM can promote competition in the public sector which could in turn lower cost, eliminate debate and possibly achieve a higher quality of progress/work through the term contacts. Competition can also be found when the government offers contracts to the private sectors and the contract is given in terms of the ability to deliver the service effectively, quality of the goods provided, hence this will increase competition because the other private sector which did not get the contract will make strides to improve the quality and ability thereby facilitating competition.

=== Private-sector management ===
This aspect focuses on the necessity to establish short-term labor contracts, develop corporate plans or [[business plan]]s, performance agreements and [[mission statement]]s. It also focuses on establishing a workplace in which public employees or contractors are aware of the goals and intention that agencies are trying to reach.

=== Cost reduction ===
The most effective one which has led to its ascent into global popularity, focuses on keeping cost low and efficiency high. "Doing more with less" &lt;ref&gt;Hood, 1991: 4-5&lt;/ref&gt;
moreover cost reduction stimulates efficiency and is one way which makes it different from the traditional approach of management&lt;ref&gt;Deffy, 1999:67-78&lt;/ref&gt;

== Differences between public and private sectors ==
New Public Management draws practices from the private sector and uses them in the public sector of management. NPM reforms use market forces to hold the public sector accountable and the satisfaction of preferences as the measures of accountability.  In order for this system to proceed, certain conditions, such as the existence of competition, must exist and information about choices must be available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kaboolian|first1=Linda|title=The New Public Management: Challenging the Boundaries of the Management vs. Administration Debate|date=1998|publisher=Public Administration Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reforms that promise to reinvent government by way of focusing on results and customer satisfaction as opposed to administrative and political processes fail to account for legislative self-interest. Institutions other than federal government, the changes being trumpeted as reinvention would not even be announced, except perhaps on hallway bulletin boards.

== Issues ==

===Criticisms===
There are blurred lines between policymaking and providing services in the New Public Management system. Questions have been raised about the potential politicization of the public service, when executives are hired on contract under pay-for-performance systems.  There are concerns that public managers may move away from trying to meet citizens' needs. NPM brings to question integrity and compliance when dealing with incentives for public managers. Questions such as managers being more or less faithful arise. The public interest is at risk and could undermine the trust in government. Accountability can be a big issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barzelay|title=The New Public Management: Improving Research and Policy Dialogue|date=2001|publisher=Russell Sage Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Relevance  ====

Although NPM had a dramatic impact in the 1990s on managing and policymaking, many scholars believe that NPM has hit its prime. Scholars like Frank Dunleavy believe New Public Management is phasing out because of disconnect with “customers” and their institutions. Scholars cite the Digital Era and the new importance of technology that kills the necessity of NPM. In countries that are less industrialized the NPM concept is still growing and spreading. This trend has much to do with a country's ability or inability to get their public sector in tune with the Digital Era. New Public Management was created in the Public Sector to create change based on: disaggregation, competition, and incentives. Using incentives to produce the maximum services from an organization is largely stalled in many countries and being reversed because of increased complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dunleavy|title=New Public Management Is Dead--Long Live Digital-Era Governance|date=2005|publisher=Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternatives===
Post-NPM, many countries explored [[digital era governance]] (DEG). Dunleavy believes this new way of governance should be heavily centered upon information and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dunleavy|title=New Public Management Is Dead--Long Live Digital-Era Governance|date=2005|publisher=Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technology will help re-integrate with digitalization changes. Digital Era Governance provides a unique opportunity for self- sustainability however, there are various factors that will determine whether or not DEG can be implemented successfully. When countries have proper technology, NPM simply can't compete very well with DEG. DEG does an excellent job of making services more accurate, prompt and remove most barriers and conflicts. DEG also can improve the service quality and provide local access to outsourcers.

===Comparisons to New Public Administration===

New Public Management is often mistakingly compared to [[New Public Administration]]. The ‘New Public Administration’ movement was one established in the USA during the late 1960s and early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pfiffner|first1=James|title=Public Administration versus The New Public Management|url=http://pfiffner.gmu.edu/files/pdfs/Book_Chapters/NewPublicMgt.doc.pdf|accessdate=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though there may be some common features, the central themes of the two movements are different. The main thrust of the New Public Administration movement was to bring academic public administration into line with a radical egalitarian agenda that was influential in US university campuses. By contrast, the emphasis of the New Public Management movement a decade or so later was firmly managerial in the sense that it stressed the difference that management could and should make the quality and efficiency of public services. It focuses on public service production functions and operational issues contrasted with the focus on public accountability, ‘model employer’ public service values, ‘due process,’ and what happens inside public organizations in conventional public administration. That meant New Public Management doctrines tended to be opposed to egalitarian ideas of managing without managers, juridical doctrines of rigidly rule-bound administration and doctrines of self-government by public-service professionals like teachers and doctors.

[[File:Moonfromoakland04052006.jpg|thumb|The [[Moon]] is the most often viewed major object in the night sky, while sometimes visible during [[daytime]].]]
[[File:Flammarion.jpg|thumb|The [[Flammarion engraving]], Paris 1888]]

The term '''night sky''', usually associated with [[astronomy]] from [[Earth]], refers to the [[night]]time appearance of [[astronomical object|celestial objects]] like [[star]]s, [[planet]]s, and the [[Moon]], which are visible in a clear [[sky]] between [[sunset]] and [[sunrise]], when the [[Sun]] is below the [[horizon]].

Natural light sources in a night sky include [[moonlight]], [[starlight]], and [[airglow]], depending on location and timing. [[Aurora]]e light up the skies above the [[polar circle]]s. Occasionally, a large [[coronal mass ejection]] from the Sun or simply high levels of [[solar wind]] may extend the phenomenon toward the [[Equator]].&lt;ref name="Northern Lights"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Yukon |first1=Northwestel |title=Aurora Borealis Explained |url=http://www.northernlightscentre.ca/northernlights.html |publisher=Northern Lights Centre |accessdate=2015-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The night sky and studies of it have a historical place in both ancient and modern cultures. In the past, for instance, [[farmer]]s have used the status of the night sky as a [[calendar]] to determine when to [[agriculture|plant crops]]. Many cultures have drawn [[constellation]]s between [[star]]s in the sky, using them in association with [[legend]]s and [[mythology]] about their [[deity|deities]].

The [[history of astrology|anciently developed]] belief of [[astrology]] is generally based on the belief that relationships between heavenly bodies influence or convey information about events on Earth. The ''scientific'' study of celestial objects visible at night takes place in the science of [[observational astronomy]].



The visibility of celestial objects in the night sky is affected by [[light pollution]]. The presence of the Moon in the night sky has historically hindered astronomical observation by increasing the amount of [[sky brightness|ambient brightness]]. With the advent of artificial light sources, however, light pollution has been a growing problem for viewing the night sky. [[Optical filter]]s and modifications to light fixtures can help to alleviate this problem, but for optimal views, both professional and [[amateur astronomy|amateur astronomers]] seek locations far from [[urban area|urban]] [[skyglow]].

== Brightness ==
{{Main|Sky brightness}}

[[File:Starry Night at La Silla.jpg|thumb|The [[Milky Way]] is brighter in the Southern Hemisphere than in the North. (Photo taken at [[La Silla Observatory]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Starry Night at La Silla|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1333a/|accessdate=20 August 2013|newspaper=ESO Picture of the Week}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

The fact that the sky is not completely dark at night, even in the absence of moonlight and city lights, can be easily observed, since if the sky were absolutely dark, one would not be able to see the silhouette of an object against the sky.

The intensity of the sky varies greatly over the day and the primary cause differs as well. During daytime when the sun is above the horizon direct scattering of sunlight ([[Rayleigh scattering]]) is the overwhelmingly dominant source of light. In twilight, the period of time between sunset and sunrise, the situation is more complicated and a further differentiation is required. Twilight is divided in three segments according to how far the sun is below the horizon in segments of 6°.

After sunset the [[civil twilight]] sets in, and ends when the sun drops more than 6° below the horizon. This is followed by the [[nautical twilight]], when the sun reaches heights of -6° and -12°, after which comes the [[astronomical twilight]] defined as the period from -12° to -18°. When the sun drops more than 18° below the horizon the sky generally attains its minimum brightness.

Several sources can be identified as the source of the intrinsic brightness of the sky, namely [[airglow]],  indirect scattering of sunlight, scattering of starlight, and artificial [[light pollution]].

== Visual presentation ==
[[File:Паранальские ночи.jpg|thumb|[[Paranal Observatory]] nights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Paranal Nights|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1401a/|accessdate=7 January 2014|newspaper=ESO Picture of the Week}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of [[noctcaelador]] tackles the aesthetic perception of the night sky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-175442997/academic-orientation-academic-achievement-and-noctcaelador| title =Academic Orientation, Academic Achievement, and Noctcaelador: Does Interest in Night-Sky Watching Correlate with Students' Approach to the Academic Environment?  |publisher =[[Questia]]| author=Kelly, William E.| author2=Daughtry, Don|accessdate =10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Depending on local sky cloud cover, pollution, humidity, and light pollution levels, the stars visible to the unaided naked eye appear as hundreds, thousands or tens of thousands of white pinpoints of light in an otherwise near black sky together with some faint nebulae or clouds of light .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/ast99/ast99238.htm |title=Number of Stars in the Sky |last1=Hawley |work=NEWTON Ask A Scientist |publisher=US Department of Energy |accessdate=October 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In ancient times the stars were often assumed to be equidistant on a dome above the earth because they are much too far away for [[stereopsis]] to offer any depth cues.  Visible stars range in color from blue (hot) to red (cold), but with such small points of faint light, most look white because they stimulate the [[rod cell]]s without triggering the [[cone cell]]s.  If it is particularly dark and a particularly faint celestial object is of interest, [[averted vision]] may be helpful.

The stars of the night sky cannot be counted unaided because they are so numerous and there is no way to track which have been counted and which have not.  Further complicating the count, fainter stars may appear and disappear depending on exactly where the observer is looking.  The result is an impression of an extraordinarily vast star field.

Because [[stargazing]] is best done from a dark place away from city lights, dark [[adaptation (eye)|adaptation]] is important to achieve and maintain.  It takes several minutes for eyes to adjust to the darkness necessary for seeing the most stars, and surroundings on the ground are hard to discern.  A red [[flashlight]] (torch) can be used to illuminate star charts, telescope parts, and the like without undoing the dark adaptation.  (See [[Purkinje effect]]).

[[File:Milky_way_-route_292_shiga_kusatsu_road-_1920x1080.webm|thumb|500px|center|Video of the night sky taken with [[DSLR camera]]s in [[Japan]].]]

=== Constellations ===
There are no markings on the night sky, though there exist many [[star chart|sky maps]] to aid stargazers in identifying [[constellation]]s and other celestial objects.  Constellations are prominent because their stars tend to be brighter than other nearby stars in the sky.  Different cultures have created different groupings of constellations based on differing interpretations of the more-or-less random patterns of dots in the sky.  Constellations were identified without regard to distance to each star, but instead as if they were all dots on a dome.

[[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] is among the most prominent and recognizable constellations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/constellations/Orion.html |title=Orion |first=Chris |last=Dolan |accessdate=2007-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Big Dipper]] (which has a wide variety of other names) is helpful for navigation in the northern hemisphere because it points to [[Polaris]], the north star.

The [[pole star]]s are special because they are approximately in line with the Earth's axis of rotation so they appear to stay in one place while the other stars rotate around them through the course of a night (or a year).

=== Planets ===
[[Planet]]s, named for the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for "wanderer," process through the star field a little each day, executing loops with time scales dependent on the length of the planet's year or orbital period around solar system.  Planets, to the naked eye, appear as points of light in the sky with variable brightness. Planets shine due to sunlight reflecting or scattering from the planets' surface or atmosphere. Thus the relative sun-planet-earth positions determine the planet's brightness. With a telescope or good binoculars, the planets appear as discs demonstrating finite size, and it is possible to observe orbiting moons which cast shadows onto the host planet's surface. [[Venus]] is the most prominent planet, often called the "morning star" or "evening star" because it is brighter than the stars and often the only "star" visible near sunrise or sunset, depending on its location in its orbit. [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]] are also visible to the naked eye.

=== The Moon ===
Earth's [[Moon]] is a grey disc in the sky with cratering visible to the naked eye.  It spans, depending on its exact location, 29-33 [[minute of arc|arcminutes]] - which is about the size of a thumbnail at arm's length, and is readily identified.  Over 28 days, the moon goes through a full cycle of [[lunar phase]]s.  People can generally identify phases within a few days by looking at the moon.  Unlike stars and most planets, the light reflected from the moon is bright enough to be seen during the day. (Venus can sometimes be seen even after sunrise.)

Some of the most spectacular moons come during the full moon phase near sunset or sunrise.  The moon on the horizon benefits from the [[moon illusion]] which makes it appear larger.  The light reflected from the moon traveling through the atmosphere also colors the moon orange and/or red.

=== Comets ===
[[Comet]]s come to the night sky only rarely.  Comets are illuminated by the sun, and their tails extend away from the sun.  A comet with visible tail is quite unusual - a [[great comet]] appears about once a decade.  They tend to be  visible only shortly before sunrise or after sunset because those are the times they are close enough to the sun to show a tail.

=== Clouds===
[[Cloud]]s obscure the view of other objects in the sky, though varying thicknesses of cloudcover have differing effects.  A very thin [[cirrus cloud]] in front of the moon might produce a rainbow-colored ring around the moon.  Stars and planets are too small or dim to take on this effect, and are instead only dimmed (often to the point of invisibility).  Thicker cloudcover obscures celestial objects entirely, making the sky black or reflecting city lights back down.  Clouds are often close enough to afford some depth perception, though they are hard to see without moonlight or light pollution.

=== Other objects ===
{{wide image|Deathvalleysky nps big.jpg|500px|The [[Milky Way]] can be seen as a very large streak or arc across the night sky if the [[visibility]] conditions are good enough. This [[panoramic]] photo was taken at [[Death Valley]].}}

[[File:Where Heaven and Earth Collide.jpg|thumb|The [[Milky Way]] contains billions of stars, arranged in two strikingly different structures: [[Milky Way#Halo|halo]] and [[Disc galaxy|disc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Where Heaven and Earth Collide|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1635a/|website=www.eso.org|accessdate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

On clear dark nights in unpolluted areas, when the moon is thin or below the horizon, the [[Milky Way]], a band of what looks like white dust, can be seen.

The [[Magellanic Clouds]] of the southern sky are easily mistaken to be Earth-based clouds (hence the name) but are in fact collections of stars found outside the Milky Way known as [[Dwarf galaxy|dwarf galaxies]].

[[Zodiacal light]] is a glow that appears near the points where the sun rises and sets, and is caused by sunlight interacting with [[Interplanetary dust cloud|interplanetary dust]].

Shortly after sunset and before sunrise, artificial [[satellite]]s often look like stars—similar in brightness and size—but move relatively quickly. Those that fly in [[low Earth orbit]] cross the sky in a couple of minutes. Some satellites, including [[space debris]], appear to blink or have a periodic fluctuation in brightness because they are rotating. [[Satellite flare|Satellite flares]] can appear brighter than [[Venus]], with notable examples including the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) and [[Iridium satellite constellation|Iridium Satellites]].

[[Meteor]]s (commonly known as shooting stars) streak across the sky very infrequently. During a [[meteor shower]], they may average one a minute at irregular intervals, but otherwise their appearance is a random surprise. The occasional meteor will make a bright, fleeting streak across the sky, and they can be very bright in comparison to the night sky.

[[Aircraft]] are also visible at night, distinguishable at a distance from other objects because their lights blink.

[[File:Steel Joists &amp; Joist Girders.jpg|thumb|Steel joists and Joist Girders being erected.]]
In [[structural engineering]], the '''open web steel [[joist]]''' (OWSJ) is a lightweight [[steel]] [[truss]] consisting, in the standard form, of parallel chords and a triangulated web system, proportioned to span between bearing points.

The main function of an OWSJ is to provide direct support for roof or floor deck and to transfer the load imposed on the deck to the structural frame i.e. [[beam (structure)|beam]] and [[column]].

In order to accurately design an OWSJ, engineers consider the joist span between bearing points, joist spacing, slope, [[live loads]], [[dead loads]], collateral loads, seismic loads, wind uplift, [[Deflection (engineering)|deflection]] criteria and maximum joist depth allowed. Many steel joist manufacturers supply economical load tables in order to allow designers to select the most efficient joist sizes for their projects.

While OWSJs can be adapted to suit a wide variety of architectural applications, the greatest economy will be realized when utilizing standard details, which may vary from one joist manufacturer to another. Some other shapes, in addition to the parallel top and bottom chord, are single slope, double slope, arch, gable and scissor configurations. These shapes may not be available from all joist manufacturers, and are usually supplied at a premium cost that reflects the complexity required.
[[File:Arch Steel Joists.jpg|thumb|Arch steel joists being erected.]]
The manufacture of OWSJ in North America is overseen by the Steel Joist Institute (SJI). The SJI has worked since 1928 to maintain sound engineering practice throughout the industry. As a non-profit organization of active manufacturers, the Institute cooperates with governmental and business agencies to establish steel joist standards. Continuing research and updating are included in this work.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=44th Edition Standard Specifications for K-Series, LH-Series, DLH-Series Open Web Steel Joists and for Joist Girders|last=|first=|publisher=Steel Joist Institute|year=2015|isbn=|location=Florence, SC|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Load tables and specifications are published by the SJI in five categories: K-Series, LH-Series, DLH-Series, CJ-Series, and Joist Girders. Load tables are available in both Allowable Stress Design (ASD) and Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD).

== History ==
The first joist in 1923 was a Warren truss type, with top and bottom chords of round bars and a web formed from a single continuous bent bar.  Various other types were developed, but problems also followed because each manufacturer had their own design and fabrication standards.  Architects, engineers and builders found it difficult to compare rated capacities and to use fully the economies of steel joist construction. 
[[File:Gable Steel Joists.jpg|thumb|Gable steel joists being erected.]]
Members of the industry began to organize the Institute, and in 1928 the first standard specifications were adopted, followed in 1929 by the first load table. The joists covered by these early standards were later identified as open web steel joists, SJ-Series.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== K-Series ==
Open Web Steel Joists, K-Series, were primarily developed to provide structural support for floors and roofs of buildings. They possess multiple advantages and features which have resulted in their wide use and acceptance throughout the United States and other countries.

K-Series Joists are standardized regarding depths, spans, and load-carrying capacities. There are 63 separate designations in the Load Tables, representing joist depths from 10 inches (254&amp;nbsp;mm) through 30 inches (762&amp;nbsp;mm) in 2 inch (51&amp;nbsp;mm) increments and spans through 60 feet (18,288&amp;nbsp;mm). Standard K-Series Joists have a 2 1/2 inch (64&amp;nbsp;mm) end bearing depth so that, regardless of the overall joist depths, the tops of the joists lie in the same plane.  Seat depths deeper than 2 ½” (64&amp;nbsp;mm) can also be specified.

Standard K-Series Joists are designed for simple span uniform loading which results in a parabolic moment diagram for chord forces and a linearly sloped shear diagram for web forces.  When non-uniform and/or concentrated loads are encountered the shear and moment diagrams required may be shaped quite differently and may not be covered by the shear and moment design envelopes of a standard K-Series Joist. When conditions such as this arise, a KCS joist may be a good option.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== KCS Joists ===
[[File:Steel Joists.png|thumb|Common steel joist chord and web configurations.]]
KCS (K-Series Constant Shear) joists are designed in accordance with the Standard Specification for K-Series Joists.

KCS joist chords are designed for a flat positive moment envelope. The moment capacity is constant at all interior panels. All webs are designed for a vertical shear equal to the specified shear capacity and interior webs will be designed for 100% stress reversal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== LH- and DLH-Series ==
Longspan (LH) and Deep Longspan (DLH) Steel Joists are relatively light weight shop-manufactured steel trusses used in the direct support of floor or roof slabs or decks between walls, beams, and main structural members.

The LH- and DLH-Series have been designed for the purpose of extending the use of joists to spans and loads in excess of those covered by Open Web Steel Joists, K-Series.

LH-Series Joists have been standardized in depths from 18 inches (457&amp;nbsp;mm) through 48 inches (1219&amp;nbsp;mm), for spans through 96 feet (29,260&amp;nbsp;mm).

DLH-Series Joists have been standardized in depths from 52 inches (1321&amp;nbsp;mm) through 120 inches (3048&amp;nbsp;mm), for spans up through 240 feet (73,152&amp;nbsp;mm).

Longspan and Deep Longspan Steel Joists can be furnished with either underslung or square ends, with parallel chords or with single or double pitched top chords to provide sufficient slope for roof drainage. Square end joists are primarily intended for bottom chord bearing.

The depth of the bearing seat at the ends of underslung LH- and DLH-Series Joists have been established at 5 inches (127&amp;nbsp;mm) for chord section number 2 through 17. A bearing seat depth of 7 1/2 inches (191&amp;nbsp;mm) has been established for the DLH Series chord section number 18 through 25.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== CJ-Series ==
Open Web Composite Steel Joists, CJ-Series, were developed to provide structural support for floors and roofs which incorporate an overlying concrete slab while also allowing the steel joist and slab to act together as an integral unit after the concrete has adequately cured.

The CJ-Series Joists are capable of supporting larger floor or roof loadings due to the attachment of the concrete slab to the top chord of the composite joist.  Shear connection between the concrete slab and steel joist is typically made by the welding of shear studs through the steel deck to the underlying CJ-Series Composite Steel Joist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Standard Specifications for Composite Steel Joists, CJ-Series|last=|first=|publisher=Steel Joist Institute|year=2010|isbn=|location=Florence, SC|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Joist Girders ==
Joist Girders are open web steel trusses used as primary framing members. They are designed as simple spans supporting equally spaced concentrated loads for a floor or roof system. These concentrated loads are considered to act at the panel points of the Joist Girders.

These members have been standardized for depths from 20 inches (508&amp;nbsp;mm) to 120 inches (3048&amp;nbsp;mm), and spans to 120 feet (36,576&amp;nbsp;mm).

The standard depth at the bearing ends has been established at 7 1/2 inches (191&amp;nbsp;mm) for all Joist Girders. Joist Girders are usually attached to the columns by bolting with two 3/4 inch diameter (19&amp;nbsp;mm) A325 bolts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The term '''p-process''' (''p'' is for [[proton]]) is used in two ways in the scientific literature concerning the [[astrophysics|astrophysical]] origin of the elements ([[nucleosynthesis]]). Originally it referred to a proton capture process which is the source of certain, naturally occurring, proton-rich [[isotope]]s of the [[chemical element|elements]] from [[selenium]] to [[Mercury (element)|mercury]].&lt;ref name="b2fh"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Synthesis of the Elements in Stars | authorlink1 = Margaret Burbidge | author1 = Burbidge, E.

Although it was shown that the originally suggested process cannot produce the p-nuclei, later on the term p-process was sometimes used to generally refer to any [[nucleosynthesis]] process supposed to be responsible for the p-nuclei.&lt;ref name="arnould"&gt;{{ cite journal | author = Arnould, M. | author2 = Goriely, S. | title = The p-Process of Stellar Nucleosynthesis: Astrophysics and Nuclear Physics Status | journal = Physics Reports | date = 2003 | volume = 384 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 1–84 | bibcode = 2003PhR...384....1A | doi = 10.1016/S0370-1573(03)00242-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, the two meanings are confused. Recent scientific literature therefore suggests to use the term p-process only for the actual proton capture process, as it is customary with other nucleosynthesis processes in astrophysics.&lt;ref name="posnic2010"&gt;{{ cite journal | author = Rauscher, T. | title = Origin of p-Nuclei in Explosive Nucleosynthesis | journal = Proceedings of Science | date = 2010 | volume = NIC XI | issue = 59 | arxiv = 1012.2213|bibcode = 2010arXiv1012.2213R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The proton capture p-process==
Proton-rich nuclides can be produced by sequentially adding one or more protons to an [[atomic nucleus]]. Such a [[nuclear reaction]] of type (p,γ) is called ''proton capture reaction''. By adding a proton to a nucleus, the [[chemical element|element]] is changed because the chemical element is defined by the [[proton number]] of a nucleus. At the same time the ratio of protons to [[neutron]]s is changed, resulting in a proton-richer isotope of the next element. This led to the original idea for the production of p-nuclei: free protons (the nuclei of [[hydrogen]] [[atom]]s are present in stellar [[Plasma (physics)|plasmas]]) should be captured on heavy nuclei (''seed nuclei'') also already present in the stellar plasma (previously produced in the [[s-process|s-]] and/or [[r-process]]).&lt;ref name="b2fh" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cameron" /&gt;

Such proton captures on [[stable nuclide]]s (or nearly stable), however, are not very efficient in producing p-nuclei, especially the heavier ones, because the [[electric charge]] increases with each added proton, leading to an increased repulsion of the next proton to be added, according to [[Coulomb's law]]. In the context of nuclear reactions this is called a [[Coulomb barrier]]. The higher the Coulomb barrier the more [[kinetic energy]] a proton requires to get close to a nucleus and be captured by it. The average energy of the available protons is given by the [[temperature]] of the stellar plasma. Even if this temperature could be increased arbitrarily (which is not the case in stellar environments), protons would be removed faster from a nucleus by [[photodisintegration]] than they could be captured at high temperature. A possible alternative would be to have a very large number of protons available to increase the effective number of proton captures per second without having to raise the temperature too much. Such conditions, however, are not found in [[Type II supernova|core-collapse supernovae]] which were supposed to be the site of the p-process.&lt;ref name="arnould" /&gt;&lt;ref name="posnic2010" /&gt;

Proton captures at extremely high proton densities are called [[P-nuclei#Rapid proton capture processes|rapid proton capture processes]]. They are distinct from the p-process not only by the required high proton density but also by the fact that very short-lived [[radionuclides]] are involved and the reaction path is located close to the [[proton drip line]]. Rapid proton capture processes are the [[rp-process]], the [[P-nuclei#The .CE.BDp-process|&amp;nu;p-process]], and the [[P-nuclei#The pn-process|pn-process]].

==History==
The term p-process was originally proposed in the famous "[[B2FH paper|B&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;FH paper]]" in 1957. The authors assumed that this process was solely responsible for the p-nuclei and proposed that it occurs in the hydrogen-shell (see also [[stellar evolution]]) of a [[star]] exploding as a [[type II supernova]].&lt;ref name="b2fh" /&gt;  It was shown later that the required conditions are not found in such supernovae.&lt;ref name="truran"&gt;{{ cite journal | author = Audouze, J. | author2 = Truran, J. W. | title = p-Process Nucleosynthesis in Postshock Supernova Envelope Environments | journal = The Astrophysical Journal | date = 1975 | volume = 202 | issue = 1 | pages = 204–213 | bibcode = 1975ApJ...202..204A | doi = 10.1086/153965 | url = http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1975ApJ...202..204A&amp;amp;data_type=PDF_HIGH&amp;amp;whole_paper=YES&amp;amp;type=PRINTER&amp;amp;filetype=.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time as B&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;FH, [[Alastair Cameron]] independently realized the necessity to add another nucleosynthesis process to [[neutron capture nucleosynthesis]] but simply mentioned proton captures without assigning a special name to the process. He also thought about alternatives, for example photodisintegration (called the [[Gamma process (astrophysics)|&amp;gamma;-process]] today) or a combination of p-process and photodisintegration.&lt;ref name="cameron" /&gt;

''' Peter W. Heller''' (born 5 September 1957) ) is a former Deputy Mayor of the City of [[Freiburg im Breisgau]]/Germany, environmental scientist, and venture philanthropist.

== Early life ==
Peter W. Heller was born in [[Frankfurt am Main]], the son of Wolfgang Heller, entrepreneur in the printing industry, and Ingeborg Heller. He studied economics and philosophy at the [[university of St. Gallen]], [[university of Lausanne]] (Switzerland) and [[university of Freiburg]] (Germany) where he obtained his PhD (Dr. rer.pol.) in 1988 with a thesis on "The Problem of Environmental Degradation in Economic Theory".  In 1988, he married Micaela Heller. They have two children, Julia (born 1989) and Jakob (born 1991).

== Professional career ==
1984 Heller was elected to the City Council of Freiburg and served on the Council’s committees for the municipal budget, environment, and culture. He left the Council in 1990 after his election as Deputy Mayor.

1990 the Council of the City of [[Freiburg im Breisgau]] elected him as Deputy Mayor to head the local administration's environmental protection department,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/1995/34/Alles_Oeko_oder_was_ DIE ZEIT, 34 (1995)]&lt;/ref&gt; the first of its kind in Southern Germany (until 1996). It comprised the offices of municipal environmental law  and regulations, waste management, urban park and forestry services, local energy  management and climate policy.

1993 the Executive Committee of [[ICLEI]] – Local Governments for Sustainability elected him as Chairman (until 1997). ICLEI is a major global network and agency of local governments committed to environmental protection and local sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;Berliner Zeitung: [http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/archiv/staedte-wollen-regierungen-unter-druck-setzen-linz-baut-eine--solar-city--fuer-25-000-menschen,10810590,8930110.html], abgerufen am 12. März 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

1997 Heller founded the investment company forseo GmbH which holds equity stakes in companies of the solar PV, windpower, and energy efficiency industry. He serves as Chairman of the Supervisory Boards of Streb AG (since 2012) and of Fahrenheit GmbH (since 2018). He co-founded solar PV and windpower development companies in Chile, Brazil and France, and provided seed capital for technology developers in the US and Germany.

Heller is the Co-Founder and Executive Director of the [[Canopus Foundation]], a private non-profit organisation which became one of the pioneers of Venture Philanthropy in Germany. Since 2000 the foundation has been providing grants and business development assistance to social enterprises active in the field of rural energy access for low income communities in developing countries. In 2008 the Canopus Foundation and Ashoka International, Arlington Va. (US) jointly founded the Solar for All initiative,.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, A.: „Der Frühphasenstifter“. In: wir - Das Magazin für Unternehmerfamilien, 2 (2012), S. 46-48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mersch, T. &amp; Merx, S.: „Die Business-Wohltäter“. In: enorm - Wirtschaft für den Menschen, 3 (2010), S. 20-27&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2014 the foundation has been promoting initiatives of new economic thinking towards more plurality in economic science, and encourages deliberation on the preconditions of a sustainable economy and society.

2001 he co-founded the „Basel Agency for Sustainable Energy (BASE)“, a „Collaborating Center“ of [[UNEP]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosenkranz, E.: Netzwerk für erneuerbare Energien, in: Basler Zeitung (2002), Nr. 163, Teil II&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2011 Heller serves on the Board of Trustees of the European Environment Foundation, Basel, which holds an annual international convention of Environmental Laureates. In 2018 the Supervisory Board of HUMBOLDT-VIADRINA Governance Platform (HVGP) gGmbH elected him as Chairman.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1165">The '''philosophy of psychiatry''' explores [[philosophical]] questions relating to [[psychiatry]] and [[mental illness]]. The [[philosopher of science]] and [[philosophy of medicine|medicine]] Dominic Murphy identifies three areas of exploration in the philosophy of psychiatry. The first concerns the examination of psychiatry as a [[science]], using the tools of the philosophy of science more broadly. The second entails the examination of the [[concept]]s employed in discussion of mental illness, including the experience of mental illness, and the [[ethics|normative]] questions it raises. The third area concerns the links and discontinuities between the [[philosophy of mind]] and [[psychopathology]].&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Dominic (Spring 2015).

In [[anatomy]], a '''process''' ({{lang-la|processus}}) is a projection or outgrowth of [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] from a larger body.&lt;ref&gt;Dorland's Medical Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in a vertebra, a process may serve for muscle attachment and leverage (as in the case of the [[transverse processes|transverse]] and [[spinous processes]]), or to fit (forming a [[synovial joint]]), with another vertebra (as in the case of the [[articular processes]]).&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Keith L. et al. (2010) ''Clinically Oriented Anatomy'', 6th Ed, p.442 fig. 4.2&lt;/ref&gt; The word is used even at the [[histology|microanatomic]] level, where [[cell (biology)|cells]] can have processes such as [[cilium|cilia]] or [[podocyte#Pedicel|pedicels]]. Depending on the tissue, processes may also be called by other terms, such as ''apophysis'', ''[[tubercle]]'', or ''[[protuberance (disambiguation)|protuberance]]''.

==Archaeology==
Qillqatani is the first archaeological site in the [[Lake Titicaca]] basin to be systematically excavated. Archaeologists have identified 36 cultural strata at the site. From 7500 to 4000 [[Before present|BP]], Qillqatani was inhabited by hunter-gatherers as a seasonal campsite. These early occupants hunted mostly camelids, and some deer.{{sfn|Peregrine|2001}} From 3660 BP onwards, Qillqatani was inhabited by pastoralist camelid-herders who built houses and began to occupy the site long-term.{{sfn|Peregrine|2001}} These later occupants also began to trade with people from lower attitudes to obtain ''[[Chenopodium]]''.{{sfn|Peregrine|2001}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15139">'''Religious skepticism''' is a type of [[skepticism]] relating to [[religion]]. Religious skeptics question religious authority and are not necessarily [[Antireligion|anti-religious]] but skeptical of specific or all religious beliefs and/or practices. [[Socrates]] was one of the most prominent and first religious skeptics of whom there are records; he questioned the legitimacy of the beliefs of his time in the existence of the [[Twelve Olympians|Greek gods]]. Religious skepticism is not the same as [[atheism]] or [[agnosticism]] and some religious skeptics are [[Deism|deists]].

== Overview ==

The word [[skeptic]] (sometimes [[sceptic]]) is derived from the middle [[French language|French]] ''sceptique'' or the [[Latin-language|Latin]] ''scepticus'', literally "sect of the sceptics". Its origin is in the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''skeptikos'', meaning inquiring, reflective or one that doubts.{{R|"defined"}} As such, religious skepticism generally refers to doubting or questioning something about religion. Although, as noted by [[J. L. Schellenberg|Schellenberg]] the term is sometimes more generally applied to anyone that has a negative view of religion.{{R|"schellenberg2"}}

The earliest beginnings of religious skepticism can be traced back to [[Xenophanes]]. He critiqued popular religion of his time, particularly false conceptions of the divine that are a byproduct of the human propensity to [[anthropomorphize]] deities. He took the scripture of his time to task for painting the gods in a negative light and promoted a more rational view of religion. He was very critical of religious people privileging their belief system over others without sound reason{{R|"xenophanes"}}{{R|"vogt"}}

The majority of skeptics are agnostics and atheists but there are also a number of religious people that are skeptical of religion.{{R|"sturgess"}} The religious are generally skeptical about claims of other religions, at least when the two denominations conflict concerning some stated belief. Some philosophers put forth the sheer diversity of religion as a justification for skepticism by theists and non-theists alike.{{R|"schellenberg3"}} Theists are also generally skeptical of the claims put forth by atheists.{{R|"mann"}}

[[Michael Shermer]] wrote that religious skepticism is a process for discovering the truth rather than general non-acceptance.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} For this reason a religious skeptic might believe that [[Jesus]] existed while questioning claims that he was the messiah or performed miracles (see [[historicity of Jesus]]). [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s ''[[The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth]]'', a literal cut and paste of the [[New Testament]] that removes anything [[supernatural]], is a prominent example.

=== Modern religious skepticism ===

The term has morphed into one that typically emphasizes scientific and historical methods of evidence. There are some skeptics that question whether religion is a viable topic for criticism given that it doesn't require proof for belief. Others, however, insist it is as much as any other knowledge. Especially when it makes claims that contradict those made by science.{{R|"novella"}}{{R|"kurtz"}}

There has been much work since the late 20th century by philosophers such as Schellenburg and [[Paul Moser|Moser]] and both have written numerous books pertaining to the topic.{{R|"schellenbergbooks"}}{{R|"moserbooks"}} Much of their work has focused on defining what religion is and specifically what people are skeptical of about it.{{R|"moser2007"}}{{R|"schellenberg2"}} The work of others have argued for the viability of religious skepticism by appeal to higher-order evidence (evidence about our evidence and our capacities for evaluation),{{R|"king"}} what some call meta-evidence.{{R|"wykstra"}}

There are still echos of early Greek skepticism in the way some current thinkers question the intellectual viability of belief in the divine.{{R|"penner"}}

In modern times there is a certain amount of mistrust and lack of acceptance of religious skeptics, particularly towards those that are also atheists.{{R|"hughes"}}{{R|"zuckerman"}}{{R|"edgell"}} This is coupled with concerns many skeptics have about the government in countries, such as the [[U.S.A.]], where [[separation of church and state]] are central tenants.{{R|"coskun"}}

== Selected historical occurrences ==

[[Socrates]] was raised in polytheistic society in which the gods were not omnipotent and required sacrifice and ritual. Socrates' conception of the divine was that they always benevolent, truthful, authoritative, and wise. Divinity was to operate within the standards of rationality.{{R|"socrates"}} This critique ultimately resulted in his [[Trial of Socrates|trial for impiety and corruption]] as documented in [[Apology (Plato)|The Apology]].

In ancient India, there was a materialist philosophical school called the [[Charvaka|Cārvāka]], who were known as being skeptical of the religious claims of [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic religion]], its rituals and texts.

The historian [[Will Durant]] writes that [[Plato]] was "as skeptical of atheism as of any other dogma."{{R|"durant"}}{{R|"vogt"}}

[[Democritus]] was the father of [[Materialism]] and there is no trace of a belief in afterlife in his work. Specifically in ''Those in Hades'' he refers to constituents of the soul as atoms that dissolve upon death.{{R|"Ferwerda"}}

In [[De Natura Deorum]] the Roman statesman [[Cicero]] calls into question the character of the gods, whether or not they participate in earthly affairs, and questions their existence. This a significant evolution from his earlier writings wherein he was more accommodating to religion{{R|"verhine"}}

In the poem [[De rerum natura]] [[Lucretius]] introduces [[epicurean]] philosophy to the Romans and proclaims that the universe operates according to physical principles and guided by ''fortuna'', or chance, instead of the [[Roman gods]].{{R|"lucretius"}}

[[Thomas Hobbes]] took positions that strongly disagreed with church teachings. He argued repeatedly that there are no [[incorporeal]] substances, and that all things, even [[God]], [[heaven]], and [[hell]] are [[Matter|corporeal]], matter in motion. He argued that "though Scripture acknowledge spirits, yet doth it nowhere say, that they are incorporeal, meaning thereby without dimensions and quantity".{{R|"lawler"}}

[[Voltaire]], although himself a deist, was a forceful critic of religion and advocated for acceptance of all religions as well as separation of church and state.{{R|"Pomeau"}}

'''Secondary succession''' is one of the two types [[ecological succession]] of a plants life. As opposed to the first, [[primary succession]], secondary succession is a process started by an event (e.g. [[forest fire]], [[harvest]]ing, [[hurricane]], etc.) that reduces an already established [[ecosystem]] (e.g. a forest or a wheat field) to a smaller population of species, and as such secondary succession occurs on preexisting [[soil]] whereas [[primary succession]] usually occurs in a place lacking soil. Many factors can affect secondary succession, such as trophic interaction, initial composition, and competition-colonization trade-offs.&lt;ref name = "Cook"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cook | first1 = W.M. | last2 = Yao | first2 = J. | last3 = Forster | first3 = B.L. | last4 = Holt | first4 = R.D. | last5 = Patricks | first5 = L.B. | year = 2005 | title = Secondary succession in an experimentally fragmented landscape: Community pattern across space and time | url = | journal = Ecology | volume = 86 | issue = | pages = 1267–1279 | doi=10.1890/04-0320}}&lt;/ref&gt; The factors that control the increase in abundance of a species during succession may be determined mainly by seed production and dispersal, micro climate; landscape structure (habitat patch size and distance to outside seed sources);&lt;ref name = "Cook"/&gt; bulk density, pH, and soil texture (sand and clay).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van der Kamp | first1 = J. | last2 = Yassir | first2 = I. | last3 = Buurman | first3 = P. | year = 2009 | title = Soil carbon changes upon secondary succession in ''Imperata'' grasslands (East Kalimantan, Indonesia) | url = | journal = Geoderma | volume = 149 | issue = | pages = 76–83 | doi=10.1016/j.geoderma.2008.11.033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simply put, secondary succession is the ecological succession that occurs after the initial succession has been disrupted and some plants and animals still exist. It is usually faster than primary succession 
# [[Soil]] is already present
# [[Seeds]], [[root]]s and underground [[vegetative reproduction|vegetative organs]] of plants may still survive in the soil.

==Examples==

=== Imperata ===
[[Imperata cylindrica|''Imperata'']] grasslands are caused by human  activities such as logging, forest clearing for shifting cultivation, agriculture and grazing, and also by frequent fires. The latter is a frequent result of human interference.&lt;ref&gt;MacKinnon, K., Hatta, G., Halim, H., Mangalik, A., 1996. Ecology of Kalimantan. The ecology of Indonesia Seri Vol. III&lt;/ref&gt;  However, when not maintained by frequent fires and human disturbances, they regenerate naturally and speedily to secondary young forest. The time of succession in ''Imperata'' grassland  (for example in Samboja Lestari area), ''Imperata cylindrica'' has the highest coverage but it becomes less dominant from the fourth year onwards. While ''Imperata'' decreases, the percentage of shrubs and young trees clearly increases with time. In the burned plots, ''Melastoma malabathricum, Eupatorium inulaefolium, Ficus'' sp., and ''Vitex pinnata''. strongly increase with the age of regeneration, but these species are commonly found in the secondary forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yassir | first1 = I. | last2 = Van der Kamp | first2 = J. | last3 = Buurman | first3 = P. | year = 2010 | title = Secondary succession after fire in Imperata grasslands of East Kalimantan, Indonesia | url = | journal = Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment | volume = 137 | issue = | pages = 172–182 | doi=10.1016/j.agee.2010.02.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soil properties change during secondary succession in Imperata grassland area. The effects of secondary succession on soil are strongest in the A-horizon (0–10&amp;nbsp;cm), where an increase in carbon stock, N, and C/N ratio, and a decrease in bulk density and pH are observed.  Soil carbon stocks also increase upon secondary succession from ''Imperata'' grassland to secondary forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van der Kamp | first1 = J. | last2 = Yassir | first2 = I. | last3 = Buurman | first3 = P. | year = 2009 | title = Soil carbon changes upon secondary succession in Imperata grasslands (East Kalimantan, Indonesia) | url = | journal = Geoderma | volume = 149 | issue = | pages = 76–83 | doi=10.1016/j.geoderma.2008.11.033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Oak and hickory forest ===
A classic example of secondary succession occurs in [[oak]] and [[hickory]] forests cleared by wildfire. Wildfires will burn most vegetation and kill those animals unable to flee the area. Their nutrients, however, are returned to the ground in the form of ash. Thus, even when areas are devoid of life due to severe fires, the area will soon be ready for new life to take hold. Before the fire, the vegetation was dominated by tall trees with access to the major plant energy resource: sunlight. Their height gave them access to sunlight while also shading the ground and other low-lying species. After the fire, though, these trees are no longer dominant. Thus, the first plants to grow back are usually annual plants followed within a few years by quickly growing and spreading grasses and other pioneer species. Due to, at least in part, changes in the environment brought on by the growth of the grasses and other species, over many years, shrubs will emerge along with small pine, oak, and hickory trees. These organisms are called intermediate species. Eventually, over 150 years, the forest will reach its equilibrium point where species composition is no longer changing and resembles the community before the fire. This equilibrium state is referred to as the climax community, which will remain stable until the next disturbance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cnx.org/contents/GFy_h8cu@10.117:d0xglyLD@4/Community-Ecology|title=45.6 Community Ecology|last=|first=|date=|website=OpenStax CNX|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-fire succession==
{{details|Fire ecology}}

===Soil===
Generation of carbonates from burnt plant material following fire disturbance causes an initial increase in soil pH that can affect the rate of secondary succession, as well as what types of organisms will be able to thrive. Soil composition prior to fire disturbance also influences secondary succession, both in rate and type of dominant species growth. For example, high sand concentration was found to increase the chances of primary ''Pteridium'' over ''Imperata'' growth in ''Imperata'' grassland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yassir|first1=I.|title=Secondary succession after fire in Imperata grasslands of East Kalimantan, Indonesia|journal=Agriculture, Ecosystems &amp; Environment|date=15 April 2010|volume=137|pages=172–182|doi=10.1016/j.agee.2010.02.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The byproducts of combustion have been shown to affect secondary succession by soil microorganisms. For example, certain fungal species such as ''Trichoderma polysporum'' and ''Penicillium janthinellum'' have a significantly decreased success rate in spore germination within fire-affected areas, reducing their ability to recolonize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Widden|first1=P.|title=The effects of a forest fire on soil microfungi|journal=Soil Biology and Biochemistry|date=March 1975|volume=7|issue=2|pages=125–138|doi=10.1016/0038-0717(75)90010-3|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0038071775900103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vegetation===
Vegetation structure is affected by fire. In some types of ecosystems this creates a process of renewal. Following a fire, early successional species disperse and establish first. This is then followed by late successional species. Species that are fire intolerant are those that are more flammable and are desolated by fire. More tolerant species are able to survive or disperse in the event of fire. The occurrence of fire leads to the establishment of deadwood and [[Snag (ecology)|snags]] in forests. This creates habitat and resources for a variety of species.
Fire can act as a seed dispersing stimulant. Many species require fire events to reproduce, disperse, and establish. For example, the knobcone pine ("Pinus attenuata") has closed cones that open for dispersal when exposed to heat caused by forest fires. This particular conifer grows in clusters because of this limited method of seed dispersal. A tough fire resistant outer bark and lack of low branches help the knobcone pine survive fire with minimal damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burczyk|first1=Jaroslaw|last2=Adams|first2=W.

[[File:Optimus Sound Level Meter.jpg|thumb|160px|right|An integrating-averaging Cirrus Optimus which complies with IEC 61672-1:2002]]
A '''sound level meter''' is used for [[acoustics|acoustic]] (sound that travels through air) measurements. It is commonly a hand-held instrument with a [[microphone]]. The [[Diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]] of the microphone responds to changes in air pressure caused by sound waves. That is why the instrument is sometimes referred to as a Sound Pressure Level (SPL) Meter. This movement of the diaphragm, i.e. the sound pressure deviation (pascal Pa), is converted into an [[Signal (electrical engineering)|electrical signal]] ([[volt|volts V]]).

A microphone is distinguishable by the voltage value produced when a known, constant [[sound pressure]] is applied. This is known as the microphone sensitivity. The instrument needs to know the sensitivity of the particular microphone being used. Using this information, the instrument is able to accurately convert the electrical signal back to a sound pressure, and display the resulting [[sound pressure|sound pressure level]] ([[decibels|decibels dB SPL]]).

Sound level meters are commonly used in [[noise pollution]] studies for the quantification of different kinds of noise, especially for industrial, environmental, mining&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kanji|first=Amisha|last2=Khoza-Shangase|first2=Katijah|last3=Ntlhakana|first3=Liepollo|date=2018-02-12|title=Noise-induced hearing loss: what South African mineworkers know|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1080%2F10803548.2017.1412122|journal=International Journal of Occupational Safety and Ergonomics|language=en|pages=1–6|doi=10.1080/10803548.2017.1412122|issn=1080-3548}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[aircraft noise]]. The current international standard that specifies sound level meter functionality and performances is the [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 61672-1:2013. However, the reading from a sound level meter does not correlate well to human-perceived loudness, which is better measured by a loudness meter. Specific loudness is a compressive nonlinearity that depends on level and also frequency, which can be calculated in a number of different ways.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.head-acoustics.de/downloads/eng/application_notes/Psychoacoustic_Analyses_I_e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classification ==

=== Types ===
The IEC 61672-1 specifies "three kinds of sound measuring instruments".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/5708|title=IEC 61672-1:2013 – IEC Webstore|website=webstore.iec.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are the "conventional" sound level meter, the integrating-averaging sound level meter, and the integrating sound level meter.

The standard sound level meter can be called an ''exponentially averaging sound level meter'' as the [[Alternating current|AC]] signal from the microphone is converted to DC by a [[root-mean-square]] (RMS) circuit and thus it must have a time constant of integration;  today referred to as the time-weighting. Three of these time-weightings have been internationally standardized, 'S' (1 s) originally called Slow, 'F' (125 [[millisecond|ms]]) originally called Fast and 'I' (35 ms) originally called Impulse. Their names were changed in the 1980s to be the same in any language. I-time-weighting is no longer in the body of the standard because it has little real correlation with the impulsive character of noise events.

The output of the RMS circuit is linear in voltage and is passed through a logarithmic circuit to give a readout linear in decibels (dB). This is 20 times the base 10 logarithm of the ratio of a given root-mean-square sound pressure to the reference sound pressure. Root-mean-square sound pressure being obtained with a standard frequency weighting and standard time weighting. The reference pressure is set by International agreement to be 20 micropascals for airborne sound. It follows that the decibel is, in a sense, not a unit, it is simply a dimensionless ratio; in this case the ratio of two pressures.

An exponentially averaging sound level meter, which gives a snapshot of the current noise level, is of limited use for hearing damage risk measurements; an integrating or integrating-averaging meter is usually mandated. An integrating meter simply integrates—or in other words 'sums'—the frequency-weighted noise to give sound exposure and the metric used is pressure squared times time, often  Pa²·s, but Pa²·h is also used. However, because the unit of sound was historically described in decibels, the exposure is most often described in terms of sound exposure level (SEL), the logarithmic conversion of sound exposure into decibels.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Note: in acoustics all 'levels' are in [[decibel]]s
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Personal noise dosimeter ===

A common variant of the sound level meter is a [[noise dosemeter]] (dosimeter in American English). However, this is now formally known as a personal sound exposure meter (PSEM) and has its own International standard IEC 61252:1993.

A '''noise dosimeter''' (American) or '''noise dosemeter''' (British) is a specialized sound level meter intended specifically to measure the noise exposure of a person integrated over a period of time; usually to comply with Health and Safety regulations such as the Occupational Safety and Health (OSHA) 29 CFR 1910.95 Occupational Noise Exposure Standard&lt;ref name=OSHA1910_95&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soundmetersource.com/osha-29-cfr-191095-occupational-noise-exposure-standard.html |title=OSHA 29 CFR 1910.95 Occupational Noise Exposure Standard'' |publisher=Occupational Health and Safety Administration  |date=2011-03-03 |accessdate=2012-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[EU Directive]] 2003/10/EC.

This is normally intended to be a body-worn instrument and thus has a relaxed technical requirement, as a body-worn instrument—because of the presence of the body—has a poorer overall acoustic performance. A PSEM gives a read-out based on sound exposure, usually Pa²·h, and the older 'classic'  dosimeters giving the metric of 'percentage dose' are no longer used in most countries. The problem with "%dose" is that it relates to the political situation and thus any device can become obsolete if the "100%" value is changed by local laws.

Traditionally, noise dosemeters were relatively large devices with a microphone mounted near the ear and having a cable going to the instrument body, itself usually belt worn. These devices had several issues, mainly the reliability of the cable and the disturbance to the user's normal work mode, caused by the presence of the cable. In 1997 following a UK research grant an EU patent was issued for the first of a range of devices that were so small that they resembled a radiation badge and no cable was needed as the whole unit could be fitted near the ear. Today these devices measure not only simple noise dose, but some even have four separate dosemeters, each  with many of the functions of a full-sized sound level meter, including in the latest models full octave band analysis.

=== Classes ===
IEC standards divide sound level meters into two "classes". Sound level meters of the two classes have the same functionality, but different tolerances for error. Class 1 instruments have a wider frequency range and a tighter tolerance than a lower cost, Class 2 unit. This applies to both the sound level meter itself as well as the associated calibrator. Most national standards permit the use of "at least a Class 2 instrument". For many measurements, it is not necessary to use a Class 1 unit; these are best employed for research and law enforcement.

Similarly, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) specifies sound level meters as three different Types 0, 1 and 2.  These are described, as follows, in the Occupational Safety and Health OSHA Technical Manual TED01-00-015, Chapter 5, OSHA Noise and Hearing Conservation, Appendix III:A,&lt;ref name="OSHA Technical Manual TED01-00-015, Chapter 5, Appendix III:A, Noise and Hearing Conservation, Instruments used to conduct a Noise Survey"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soundmetersource.com/osha-noise-and-hearing-conservation-section-iiia---instruments-used-to-conduct-a-noise-survey.html|title=OSHA Noise and Hearing Conservation, Appendix III:A'' |publisher=Occupational Health and Safety Administration  |date=1996-03-07 |accessdate=2013-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "These ANSI standards set performance and accuracy tolerances according to three levels of precision: Types 0, 1, and 2. Type 0 is used in laboratories, Type 1 is used for precision measurements in the field, and Type 2 is used for general-purpose measurements.  For compliance purposes, readings with an ANSI Type 2 sound level meter and dosimeter are considered to have an accuracy of ±2 dBA, while a Type 1 instrument has an accuracy of ±1 dBA. A Type 2 meter is the minimum requirement by OSHA for noise measurements and is usually sufficient for general purpose noise surveys. The Type 1 meter is preferred for the design of cost-effective noise controls. For unusual measurement situations, refer to the manufacturer's instructions and appropriate ANSI standards for guidance in interpreting instrument accuracy."

== Measurements ==
{{ Sound Level Label Examples }}
Labels used to describe sound and noise level values are defined in the [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] Standard 61672-1:2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/5708|title=IEC 61672-1:2013 Electroacoustics - Sound level meters - Part 1: Specifications|last=International Electrotechnical Commission|first=IEC|website=iec.ch|access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Level===
For labels, the first letter is always an '''L'''. This simply stands for '''Level''', as in the sound pressure level measured through a microphone or the electronic signal level measured at the output from an audio component, such as a mixing desk.

=== Frequency weighting ===
{{Main|A-weighting}}
[[File:Sound-Pressure-Level-Frequency-Weightings-wiki.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A, C and Z frequency weightings for sound]]
The second letter indicates the frequency weighting. 'Pattern Approved' sound level meters offer noise measurements with A, C and Z frequency weighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nti-audio.com/en/support/faq/frequency-weightings-for-sound-level-measurements.aspx|title=Frequency-Weightings for Sound Level Measurements|first=[[NTi Audio|NTi]]|last=Audio|website=www.nti-audio.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Z-Weighting represents the actual sound produced. A-Weighting, with less lower and higher [[Audio frequency|frequencies]], and a slight boost in the mid-range, represents what humans are capable of hearing. C-Weighting, more sensitive to the lower frequencies, represents what humans hear when the sound is loud (over 100 dB).

The IEC 61672-1:2013 mandates the inclusion of an ''A''-frequency-[[weighting filter]] in all sound level meters, and also describes ''C'' and ''Z'' (zero) frequency weightings. The older ''B'' and ''D'' frequency weightings are now obsolete and are no longer described in the standard.

In almost all countries, the use of A-frequency-weighting is mandated to be used for the protection of workers against noise-induced hearing loss. The A-frequency curve was based on the historical equal-loudness contours and while arguably A-frequency-weighting is no longer the ideal frequency weighting on purely scientific grounds, it is nonetheless the legally required standard for almost all such measurements and has the huge practical advantage that old data can be compared with new measurements. It is for these reasons that A-frequency-weighting is the only weighting mandated by the international standard, the frequency weightings 'C' and 'Z' being optional fitments.

Originally,  the A-frequency-weighting was only meant for quiet sounds in the region of 40&amp;nbsp;dB [[Sound pressure level#Sound pressure level|sound pressure level]] (SPL), but is now mandated for all levels. C-frequency weighting is however still used in the measurement of the peak value of a noise in some legislation, but B-frequency weighting – a halfway house between 'A' and 'C' has almost no practical use. D-frequency-weighting was designed for use in measuring [[aircraft noise]] when non-bypass jets were being measured and after the demise of Concord, these are all military types. For all civil aircraft noise measurements, A-frequency-weighting is used as is mandated by the ISO and ICAO standards.

===Time Weighting===

}}
If the third letter is '''F''', '''S''' or '''I''', this represents the '''time weighting'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nti-audio.com/en/support/know-how/fast-slow-impulse-time-weighting-what-do-they-mean|title=fast slow impulse time weighting what do they mean|last=Audio|first=NTi|website=nti-audio.com|access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;. F = Fast, S = Slow, I = Impulse. Time weighting is applied so that levels measured are easier to read on a sound level meter. The time weighting dampens sudden changes in levels, thus creating a smoother display.

The graph indicates how this works. In this example, the input signal suddenly increases from 50 dB to 80 dB, stays there for 6 seconds, then disappears just as suddenly. 

A Slow measurement (yellow line) will take approximately 5 seconds (attack time) to reach 80 dB and around 6 seconds (decay time) to drop back down to 50 dB. '''S''' is appropriate when measuring a signal that fluctuates a lot. 

A Fast measurement (green line) is quicker to react. It will take approximately 0.6 seconds to reach 80 dB and just under 1 second to drop back down to 50 dB. '''F''' may be more suitable where the signal is less impulsive. 

The decision to use Fast or Slow is often reached by what is prescribed in a standard or a law.

An Impulse measurement (blue line) will take approximately 0.3 seconds to reach 80 dB and over 9 seconds to drop back down to 50 dB. The impulse response, '''I''' can be used in situations where there are sharp impulsive noises, such as when measuring fireworks or gunshots.

=== ''L&lt;sub&gt;AT&lt;/sub&gt;'' or ''L''&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;: Equivalent continuous sound level ===
[[File:LAeq 5 minute.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Graph of LAeq sound level measurement calculated over 5 minutes]]
[[File:LAeq.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Graph of a continuous LAeq sound level measurement]]
'''eq''' = equivalent. Equivalent values are a form of time weighting that is easier to read on a display than the instantaneous sound level.

If you look at these graphs of sound level over time, the area under the blue curve represents the energy. The horizontal red line drawn to represent the same area under the blue curve, gives us the LAeq. That is '''the equivalent value''' or average of the energy over the entire graph.

LAeq is not always a straight line. If the LAeq is plotted as the equivalent from the beginning of the graph to each of the measurement points, the plot is shown in the second graph.

Sound exposure level—in decibels—is not much used in industrial noise measurement. Instead, the time-averaged value is used. This is the time average sound level or as it is usually called the 'equivalent continuous sound level' has the formal symbol ''L&lt;sub&gt;AT&lt;/sub&gt;'' as described in paragraph 3,9 "Definitions" of IEC 61672-1 where many correct formal symbols and their common abbreviations are given. These mainly follow the formal ISO acoustic definitions. However, for mainly historical reasons, ''L&lt;sub&gt;AT&lt;/sub&gt;'' is commonly referred to as  ''L''&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;.

Formally, ''L&lt;sub&gt;AT&lt;/sub&gt;'' is 10 times the base 10 logarithm of the ratio of a root-mean-square A-weighted sound pressure during a stated time interval to the reference sound pressure and there is no time constant involved. To measure ''L&lt;sub&gt;AT&lt;/sub&gt;'' an integrating-averaging meter is needed; this in concept takes the sound exposure, divides it by time and then takes the logarithm of the result.

=== Short ''L''&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; ===
An important variant of overall ''L&lt;sub&gt;AT&lt;/sub&gt;'' is "short ''L''&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;" where very short ''L''&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; values are taken in succession, say at 1/8 second intervals, each being stored in a digital memory. These data elements can either be transmitted to another unit or be recovered from the memory and re-constituted into almost any conventional metric long after the data has been acquired. This can be done using either dedicated programs or standard spreadsheets. Short ''L''&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; has the advantage that as regulations change, old data can be re-processed to check if a new regulation is met. It also permits data to be converted from one metric to another in some cases. Today almost all fixed airport noise monitoring systems, which are in concept just complex sound level meters, use short ''L''&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; as their metric, as a steady stream of the digital one second ''L''&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; values can be transmitted via telephone lines or the Internet to a central display and processing unit. Short ''L''&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; is a feature of most commercial integrating sound level meters—although some manufacturers give it many different names.

Short ''L''&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; is a very valuable method for acoustic data storage; initially, a concept of the French Government's Laboratoire National d'Essais (ref 1), it has now become the most common method of storing and displaying a true time history of the noise in professional commercial sound level meters.   The alternative method, which is to generate a time history by storing and displaying samples of the exponential sound level, displays too many artifacts of the sound level meter to be as valuable and such sampled data cannot be readily combined to form an overall set of data.

Until 2003 there were separate standards for exponential and linear integrating sound level meters, (IEC 60651 and IEC 60804—both now withdrawn), but since then the combined standard IEC 61672 has described both types of meter. For short ''L''&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; to be valuable the manufacturer must ensure that each separate ''L''&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; element fully complies with IEC 61672.

[[File:LAFmax 1 minute.jpg|thumb|250px|Graph of an LAFmax sound level measurement calculated every minute]]
===''L''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt;===
If the words '''max''' or '''min''' appear in the label, this simply represents the maximum or minimum value measured over a certain period of time.

=== ''LC''&lt;sub&gt;pk&lt;/sub&gt;: peak sound pressure level ===
Most national regulations also call for the absolute peak value to be measured to protect workers hearing against sudden large pressure peaks,  using either 'C' or 'Z' frequency weighting. 'Peak sound pressure level' should not be confused with 'MAX sound pressure level'.  'Max sound pressure level' is simply the highest RMS reading a conventional sound level meter gives over a stated period for a given time-weighting (S, F, or I) and can be many decibels less than the peak value. In the European Union, the maximum permitted value of the peak sound level is 140&amp;nbsp;dB(C) and this equates to 200 Pa pressure. The symbol for the ''A''-frequency and ''S''-time weighted maximum sound level is LAS&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;.  For the ''C''-frequency weighted peak it is  ''LC''&lt;sub&gt;pk&lt;/sub&gt; or ''L&lt;sub&gt;C,peak&lt;/sub&gt;''.

Until 2003 there were separate standards for exponential and linear integrating sound level meters, but since then IEC 61672 has described both types.  The classic exponential meter was originally described in IEC 123 for 'industrial' meters followed by IEC 179 for 'precision' meters. Both of these were replaced by IEC 651, later renamed IEC 60651, while the linear integrating meters were initially described by IEC 804, later renamed IEC 60804. Both IEC 60651 and 60804 included four accuracy classes, called "types". In IEC 61672 these were reduced to just two accuracy classes 1 and 2. New in the standard IEC 61672 is a minimum 60&amp;nbsp;dB linear span requirement and ''Z''-frequency-weighting, with a general tightening of limit tolerances, as well as the inclusion of maximum allowable measurement uncertainties for each described periodic test. The periodic testing part of the standard (IEC61672.3) also requires that manufacturers provide the testing laboratory with correction factors to allow laboratory electrical and acoustic testing to better mimic [[Free field (acoustics)]] responses. Each correction used should be provided with uncertainties,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/7225|title=IEC 62585:2012 – IEC Webstore|website=webstore.iec.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt; that need to be accounted for in the testing laboratory final [[Measurement uncertainty]] budget. This makes it unlikely that a sound level meter designed to the older 60651 and 60804 standards will meet the requirements of IEC 61672 : 2013. These 'withdrawn' standards should no longer be used, especially for any official purchasing requirements, as they have significantly poorer accuracy requirements than IEC 61672.

=== Military standards ===
Combatants in every branch of the United States’ military are at risk for auditory impairments from steady state or [[Impulse noise (audio)|impulse noises]]. While applying double hearing protection helps prevent auditory damage, it may compromise effectiveness by isolating the user from his or her environment. With hearing protection on, a soldier is less likely to be aware of his or her movements, alerting the enemy to their presence. Hearing protection devices (HPD) could also require higher volume levels for communication, negating their purpose.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Amrein|first=Bruce E.|date=2015|title=Military standard 1474E: Design criteria for noise limits vs. operational effectiveness|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1121/2.0000207|publisher=Acoustical Society of America|doi=10.1121/2.0000207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this standard, the Department of Defense established guidelines for steady state noise, impulse noise, aural non-detectability, aircraft and aerial systems, and shipboard noise. Unless marked with warning signage, steady state and impulse noises are not to exceed 85 decibels A-weighted (dBA) and, if wearing protection, 140 decibles (dBP) respectively. It establishes acoustical noise limits and prescribes testing requirements and measurement techniques for determining conformance to the noise limits specified herein.  This standard applies to the acquisition and product improvement of all designed or purchased (non-developmental items) systems, subsystems, equipment, and facilities that emit acoustic noise. This standard is intended to address noise levels emitted during the full range of typical operational conditions.  This standard includes two methods for assessing the impulse noise and risk to hearing. 
**The Auditory Hazard Assessment Algorithm for Humans (AHAAH), a one-dimensional electro-acoustic analog of the auditory system, produced MIL-STD 1474E's numerical guidelines. Over time the predictability of this algorithm has been claimed to have increased to 95% accuracy. &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;DePaolis, Annalisa; Bikson, Marome; Nelson, Jeremy; de Ru, J Alexander; Packer, Mark; Cardoso, Luis (Feb 2 2017). "Analytical and numerical modeling of the hearing system: Advances towards the assessment of hearing damage". ''Elsevier''. '''349''': 111–118. [[Digital object identifier|doi]]:10.1016/j.heares.2017.01.015. Retrieved 3 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[United States Army Research Laboratory|US Army Research Laboratory]] researchers state that almost every error resulted in overcalculation of risk. By comparison, the MIL-STD-147D was deemed correct in 38% of cases with the same data.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Originally developed from a cat animal model and later informed by human data, the AHAAH sums the basilar membrane displacements of 23 locations.The AHAAH model calculates the estimated displacement of the basilar membrane and summates the accumulation of the flexure of the basilar membrane.   The user inputs their noise exposure, protection level, and whether they were forewarned of the noise, to receive their hazard vulnerability in auditory risk units (ARU). This value can be converted to compound threshold shifts and the allowed number of exposure (ANE). Compound threshold shifts is a value that integrates both temporary and permanent shifts in auditory threshold, the latter being correlated to hair cell function.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
***The AHAAH’s claimed improvements in accuracy are often attributed to its sensitivity to the flexing of the middle ear muscle (MEM) and annular ligament of the stapes. When someone is forewarned of a sound, the MEM flexes, which is associated with reduced ability of the sound waves to reverberate. When an impulse sound is produced, the stape’s annular ligament flexes and strongly clips the sound’s oscillation peak.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  As the MIL-STD-1474 has evolved, technology and methods have improved the AHAAP’s accuracy. Researchers claim that the AHAAP has been proven to be more accurate in cases of double protection but not always in unwarned impulse noise instances relative to the competitive metric LAeq8hr.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Nakashima, Ann (November 2015). "A comparison of metrics for impulse noise exposure" (PDF). Defence Research and Development Canada. Retrieved 3 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some suggestions for further development focus on creating a more user-friendly software, the placement of the microphone in data collection, the absence of the MEM reflex in populations, and the reevaluation of free-field conditions in calculations. Agencies such as NATO, the American Institute of Biological Sciences, and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health agreed that these suggestions be attended to before the metric is implemented. This shared conclusion was made prior to the development of MIL-STD-1474E. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Pattern approval and Periodic Testing ===
One of the more difficult decisions in selecting a sound level meter is "How do you know if it complies with its claimed standard?" This is a difficult question and IEC 61672 part 2&lt;ref&gt;http://webstore.iec.ch/webstore/webstore.nsf/artnum/048670!opendocument&lt;/ref&gt; tries to answer this by the concept of "pattern approval". A manufacturer has to supply instruments to a national laboratory which tests one of them and if it meets its claims issue a formal Pattern Approval certificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nti-audio.com/Portals/0/data/en/XL2-TA-Type-Approval.pdf|title=Sample Pattern Approval Certificate|first=[[NTi Audio|NTi]]|last=Audio|website=www.nti-audio.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, the most common approval is often considered to be that from the PTB in Germany  ([[Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt]]). If a manufacturer cannot show at least one model in his range that has such approval, it is reasonable to be wary, but the cost of this approval militates against any manufacturer having all his range approved. Inexpensive sound level meters (under $200) are unlikely to have a Pattern Approval and may produce incorrect measurement results.

Even the most accurate approved sound level meter must be regularly checked for sensitivity—what most people loosely call 'calibration'. The procedures for periodic testing are defined within IEC61672.3-2013. To ensure accuracy in periodic testing, procedures should be carried out by a facility that can produce results traceable to [[International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation]], or other local [[International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation]] signatories.

For a simple single level and frequency check, units consisting of a computer controlled generator with additional sensors to correct for humidity, temperature, battery voltage and static pressure can be used. The output of the generator is fed to a transducer in a half-inch cavity into which the sound level meter microphone is inserted. The acoustic level generated is 94&amp;nbsp;dB which is 1 pascal and is at a frequency of 1&amp;nbsp;kHz where all the frequency weightings have the same sensitivity.

For a complete sound level meter check, periodic testing outlined in IEC61672.3-2013 should be carried out. These tests excite the sound level meter across the entire frequency and dynamic range ensuring compliance with expected design goals defined in IEC61672.1-2013.

=== ANSI/IEC: the Atlantic divide ===
Sound level meters are also divided into two types in "the Atlantic divide". Sound level meters meeting the USA [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI) specifications
&lt;ref name=ANSI_S1.4&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soundmetersource.com/ansi-standards.html |title=''American National Standard for Sound Level Meters'' |publisher=American National Standards Institute|year=2006|accessdate=2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; cannot usually meet the corresponding [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) specifications &lt;ref name=IEC_61672-1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soundmetersource.com/iec-standards.html |title=''IEC 61672-1, Electroacoustics – Sound level meters – Part 1: Specifications'' |publisher=International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)|date=May 2002|accessdate=2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the same time, as the ANSI standard describes instruments that are calibrated to a randomly incident wave, i.e. a diffuse sound field, while internationally meters are calibrated to a free field wave, that is sound coming from a single direction. Further, USA dosimeters have an exchange rate of level against time where every 5&amp;nbsp;dB increase in level halves the permitted exposure time; whereas in the rest of the world a 3&amp;nbsp;dB increase in level halves the permitted exposure time. The 3&amp;nbsp;dB doubling method is called the "equal energy" rule and there is no possible way of converting data taken under one rule to be used under the other. Despite these differences, many developing countries refer to both USA and international specifications within one instrument in their national regulations. Because of this, many commercial PSEM have dual channels with 3 and 5&amp;nbsp;dB doubling, some even having 4&amp;nbsp;dB for the U.S. Air Force.

=== Noise monitoring stations ===
[[File:Sound Level Monitor.jpg|thumb|uprught|Noise monitoring station at [[Muir Woods National Monument]] in California&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barringer|first1=Felicity|title=Shhh, and Not Because the Fauna Are Sleeping|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/22/science/earth/22sound.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|accessdate=2 August 2014|publisher=The New York Times|date=21 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Some applications require the ability to monitor noise continuously on a permanent or semi-permanent basis. Some manufacturers offer permanent and semi-permanent noise monitoring stations for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nti-audio.com/en/solutions/noise-monitoring/unattended-monitoring.aspx|title=Noise Monitoring Station|first=[[NTi Audio|NTi]]|last=Audio|website=www.nti-audio.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acousticresearch.com.au/Products/Noise+Loggers/Ngara|title=Acoustic Research Labs Pty Ltd|first=Acoustic Research Labs Pty|last=Ltd|website=www.acousticresearch.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such monitoring stations are typically based on a sound level meter at the heart and some added capabilities such as remote communication, GPS, and weather stations. These can often also be powered using solar power. Applications for such monitoring stations include airport noise, construction noise, mining noise, traffic noise, rail noise, community noise, wind farm noise, industrial noise, etc.

Modern monitoring stations can also offer remote communication capabilities using cellular modems, WiFi networks or direct LAN wires. Such devices allow for real-time alerts and notifications via email and text messages upon exceeding a certain dB level. Systems can also remotely email reports on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. Real-time data publication is often also desired, which can be achieved by pushing data to a website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noisescout.com|title=NoiseScout Unattended Noise Monitoring Solution|first=[[NTi Audio|NTi]]|last=Audio|website=www.noisescout.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acousticresearch.com.au/Products/Noise+Cloud|title=Acoustic Research Labs Pty Ltd|first=Acoustic Research Labs Pty|last=Ltd|website=www.acousticresearch.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Smartphone applications ===
The ubiquity of [[smartphone]]s, their constant network connectivity, the built-in geographic information system functionality and user-interactivity features present a great opportunity to revolutionize the way we look at noise, its measurement, and its effects on hearing and overall health. The ability to acquire and display real-time noise exposure data raises people’s awareness about their work (and off-work) environment and allows them to make informed decisions about hearing hazards and overall well-being. [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|NIOSH]] conducted a pilot study to select and characterize the functionality and accuracy of smartphone sound measurement applications (apps) as an initial step in a broader effort to determine whether these apps can be relied on to conduct participatory noise monitoring studies in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2014/04/09/sound-apps/|title=So How Accurate Are These Smartphone Sound Measurement Apps? |work= NIOSH Science Blog |publisher=Centers for Disease Control|access-date=2017-01-30}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most smartphone sound measurement apps are not accurate enough to be used for legally required measurements, the NIOSH Sound Level Meter app met the requirements of IEC 61672/ANSI S1.4 Sound Level Meter Standards (Electroacoustics - Sound Level Meters - Part 3: Periodic Tests).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Celestina|first=Metod|last2=Hrovat|first2=Jan|last3=Kardous|first3=Chucri A.|date=2018|title=Smartphone-based sound level measurement apps: Evaluation of compliance with international sound level meter standards|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apacoust.2018.04.011|journal=Applied Acoustics|volume=139|pages=119–128|doi=10.1016/j.apacoust.2018.04.011|issn=0003-682X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Building acoustics, Sound insulation and Reverberation time ===
Some advanced sound level meters can also include [[Reverberation time|reverberation time]] (RT60) measurement capabilities. Measurements can be done using the Integrated Impulse Response or Interrupted Noise Methods. Such sound level meters should comply with latest ISO 3382-2 and ASTM E2235-04 measurement standards. Also required for measuring the [[Architectural acoustics|acoustics in buildings]] is a signal generator that provides pink or white noise through an amplifier and omnidirectional speakers. Such measurements are also used for calculation of wall/partition [[Sound reduction index|sound insulation]].

{{Star formation}}
'''Star formation''' is the process by which dense regions within [[molecular cloud]]s in [[&lt;!--Interstellar medium|The "medium" is present further soon.--&gt;interstellar space]], sometimes referred to as "stellar nurseries" or "[[star]]-forming regions", [[Jeans instability|collapse]] and form [[star]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Formation of Stars|author1=Stahler, S. W.  |author2=Palla, F. |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher = Wiley-VCH|year = 2004|isbn = 3-527-40559-3|location = Weinheim}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a branch of [[astronomy]], star formation includes the study of the [[interstellar medium]] (ISM) and [[giant molecular cloud]]s (GMC) as precursors to the star formation process, and the study of [[protostar]]s and [[young stellar object]]s as its immediate products.  It is closely related to [[planet formation]], another branch of [[astronomy]].  Star formation theory, as well as accounting for the formation of a single star, must also account for the statistics of [[binary star]]s and the [[initial mass function]].

===Interstellar clouds===
A [[spiral galaxy]] like the Milky Way contains [[star]]s, [[stellar remnant]]s, and a diffuse [[interstellar medium]] (ISM) of gas and dust. The interstellar medium consists of 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; particles per cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and is typically composed of roughly 70% [[hydrogen]] by mass, with most of the remaining gas consisting of [[helium]]. This medium has been chemically enriched by trace amounts of [[Metallicity|heavier elements]] that were ejected from stars as they passed beyond the end of their [[main sequence]] lifetime. Higher density regions of the interstellar medium form clouds, or ''[[nebula|diffuse nebulae]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=C.

In the dense nebulae where stars are produced, much of the hydrogen is in the molecular (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) form, so these nebulae are called [[molecular cloud]]s.&lt;ref name=prialnik /&gt; Observations indicate that the coldest clouds tend to form low-mass stars, observed first in the infrared inside the clouds, then in visible light at their surface when the clouds dissipate, while giant molecular clouds, which are generally warmer, produce stars of all masses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=James | last=Lequeux | title=Birth, Evolution and Death of Stars | publisher=World Scientific | date=2013 | isbn=978-981-4508-77-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; These giant molecular clouds have typical densities of 100 particles per cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, diameters of {{convert|100|ly|km|lk=on}}, masses of up to 6&amp;nbsp;million [[solar mass]]es ({{Solar mass|link=y}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

===Cloud collapse===
An interstellar cloud of gas will remain in [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] as long as the [[kinetic energy]] of the gas [[pressure]] is in balance with the [[potential energy]] of the internal [[gravitational force]]. Mathematically this is expressed using the [[virial theorem]], which states that,  to maintain equilibrium, the gravitational potential energy must equal twice the internal thermal energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a cloud is massive enough that the gas pressure is insufficient to support it, the cloud will undergo [[gravitational collapse]]. The mass above which a cloud will undergo such collapse is called the [[Jeans mass]]. The Jeans mass depends on the temperature and density of the cloud, but is typically thousands to tens of thousands of solar masses.&lt;ref name=prialnik /&gt; This coincides with the typical mass of an [[open cluster]] of stars, which is the end product of a collapsing cloud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=E. | last=Battaner

In ''triggered star formation'', one of several events might occur to compress a molecular cloud and initiate its [[gravitational collapse]]. Molecular clouds may collide with each other, or a nearby [[supernova]] explosion can be a trigger, sending [[Shock wave|shocked]] matter into the cloud at very high speeds.&lt;ref name=prialnik /&gt; (The resulting new stars may themselves soon produce supernovae, producing [[SSPSF model|self-propagating star formation]].)

A [[supermassive black hole]] at the core of a galaxy may serve to regulate the rate of star formation in a galactic nucleus. A black hole that is accreting infalling matter can become [[Active galactic nucleus|active]], emitting a strong wind through a collimated [[relativistic jet]]. This can limit further star formation. Massive black holes ejecting radio-frequency-emitting particles at near-light speed can also block the formation of new stars in aging galaxies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

As it collapses, a molecular cloud breaks into smaller and smaller pieces in a hierarchical manner, until the fragments reach stellar mass. In each of these fragments, the collapsing gas radiates away the energy gained by the release of [[gravitational]] [[potential energy]].  As the density increases, the fragments become opaque and are thus less efficient at radiating away their energy. This raises the temperature of the cloud and inhibits further fragmentation. The fragments now condense into rotating spheres of gas that serve as stellar embryos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A protostellar cloud will continue to collapse as long as the gravitational binding energy can be eliminated. This excess energy is primarily lost through radiation. However, the collapsing cloud will eventually become opaque to its own radiation, and the energy must be removed through some other means. The dust within the cloud becomes heated to temperatures of {{nowrap|60–100 K}}, and these particles radiate at wavelengths in the far infrared where the cloud is transparent. Thus the dust mediates the further collapse of the cloud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

During the collapse, the density of the cloud increases towards the center and thus the middle region becomes optically opaque first. This occurs when the density is about {{nowrap|10&lt;sup&gt;−13&lt;/sup&gt; g / cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}. A core region, called the First Hydrostatic Core, forms where the collapse is essentially halted. It continues to increase in temperature as determined by the virial theorem. The gas falling toward this opaque region collides with it and creates shock waves that further heat the core.&lt;ref name=larson/&gt;
[[Image:Cepheus B.jpg|thumb|left|[[Composite image]] showing young stars in and around molecular cloud [[Cepheus (constellation)|Cepheus]] B.]]

The combination of convection within the protostar and radiation from its exterior allow the star to contract further.&lt;ref name=larson/&gt; This continues until the gas is hot enough for the internal [[pressure]] to support the protostar against further gravitational collapse—a state called [[hydrostatic equilibrium]]. When this accretion phase is nearly complete, the resulting object is known as a [[protostar]].&lt;ref name=prialnik /&gt;
[[Image:N11 (Hubble).jpg|thumb|right| N11, part of a complex network of gas clouds and star clusters within our neighbouring galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud.]]
Accretion of material onto the protostar continues partially from the newly formed [[circumstellar disc]]. When the density and temperature are high enough, [[deuterium burning|deuterium fusion]] begins, and the outward [[radiation pressure|pressure]] of the resultant radiation slows (but does not stop) the collapse. Material comprising the cloud continues to "rain" onto the [[protostar]]. In this stage bipolar jets are produced called [[Herbig-Haro objects]]. This is probably the means by which excess [[angular momentum]] of the infalling material is expelled, allowing the star to continue to form.
[[File:Star formation region Lupus 3.jpg|left|thumb|Star formation region [[Lupus 3]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glory From Gloom|url=https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1804/|website=www.eso.org|accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
When the surrounding gas and dust envelope disperses and accretion process stops, the star is considered a [[pre–main sequence star]] (PMS star). The energy source of these objects is gravitational contraction, as opposed to hydrogen burning in main sequence stars. The PMS star follows a [[Hayashi track]] on the [[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram|Hertzsprung–Russell (H–R) diagram]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = C. Hayashi | title=Stellar evolution in early phases of gravitational contraction | journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan | date=1961 | volume=13 | pages=450–452 | bibcode=1961PASJ...13..450H }}&lt;/ref&gt; The contraction will proceed until the [[Hayashi limit]] is reached, and thereafter contraction will continue on a [[Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism|Kelvin–Helmholtz timescale]] with the temperature remaining stable. Stars with less than {{Solar mass|0.5}} thereafter join the main sequence. For more massive PMS stars, at the end of the Hayashi track they will slowly collapse in near hydrostatic equilibrium, following the [[Henyey track]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = L. G. Henyey | author2 = R. Lelevier | author3 = R. D.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, [[hydrogen]] begins to fuse in the core of the star, and the rest of the enveloping material is cleared away. This ends the protostellar phase and begins the star's [[main sequence]] phase on the H–R diagram.

The stages of the process are well defined in stars with masses around {{Solar mass|1}} or less. In high mass stars, the length of the star formation process is comparable to the other timescales of their evolution, much shorter, and the process is not so well defined. The later evolution of stars are studied in [[stellar evolution]].

The structure of the molecular cloud and the effects of the protostar can be observed in near-IR [[extinction (astronomy)|extinction]] maps (where the number of stars are counted per unit area and compared to a nearby zero extinction area of sky), continuum dust emission and [[rotational transition]]s of [[Carbon monoxide|CO]] and other molecules; these last two are observed in the millimeter and [[radio astronomy|submillimeter]] range. The radiation from the protostar and early star has to be observed in [[infrared|infrared astronomy]] wavelengths, as the [[extinction (astronomy)|extinction]] caused by the rest of the cloud in which the star is forming is usually too big to allow us to observe it in the visual part of the spectrum. This presents considerable difficulties as the Earth's atmosphere is almost entirely opaque from 20μm to 850μm, with narrow windows at 200μm and 450μm. Even outside this range, atmospheric subtraction techniques must be used.

Stars of different masses are thought to form by slightly different mechanisms.  The theory of low-mass star formation, which is well-supported by a plethora of observations, suggests that low-mass stars form by the gravitational collapse of rotating density enhancements within molecular clouds.  As described above, the collapse of a rotating cloud of gas and dust leads to the formation of an accretion disk through which matter is channeled onto a central protostar.  For stars with masses higher than about {{Solar mass|8}}, however, the mechanism of star formation is not well understood.

Massive stars emit copious quantities of radiation which pushes against infalling material.  In the past, it was thought that this [[radiation pressure]] might be substantial enough to halt accretion onto the massive protostar and prevent the formation of stars with masses more than a few tens of solar masses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = M. G. Wolfire | author2 = J. P. Cassinelli | title = Conditions for the formation of massive stars | journal = Astrophysical Journal | date = 1987 | volume = 319 | issue = 1 | pages = 850–867 | bibcode = 1987ApJ...319..850W  | doi = 10.1086/165503}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent theoretical work has shown that the production of a jet and outflow clears a cavity through which much of the radiation from a massive protostar can escape without hindering accretion through the disk and onto the protostar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = C.

There is mounting evidence that at least some massive protostars are indeed surrounded by accretion disks.  Several other theories of massive star formation remain to be tested observationally.  Of these, perhaps the most prominent is the theory of competitive accretion, which suggests that massive protostars are "seeded" by low-mass protostars which compete with other protostars to draw in matter from the entire parent molecular cloud, instead of simply from a small local region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = I.

Various methods and tools are involved in '''stellar age estimation''', an attempt to identify within reasonable degrees of confidence what the age of a star is. These methods include stellar [[stellar evolution|evolutionary models]], membership in a given [[star cluster]] or [[star system|system]], fitting the star with the standard [[stellar classification|spectral and luminosity classification system]], and the presence of a [[protoplanetary disk]], among others. Nearly all of the methods of determining age require knowledge of the mass of the star, which can be known through various methods. No individual method can provide accurate results for all types of stars.&lt;ref name=astroreview&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1146/annurev-astro-081309-130806|title=The Ages of Stars|year=2010|last1=Soderblom|first1=David R.|journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=48|pages=581|arxiv = 1003.6074 |bibcode = 2010ARA&amp;A..48..581S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Luminosity increase and the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram ==
As stars grow older, their luminosity increases at an appreciable rate.&lt;ref name=theuniverse-2011&gt;{{Cite episode

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the mass of the star, one can use this rate of increase in luminosity in order to determine the age of the star. This method only works for calculating stellar age on the [[main sequence]], because in advanced evolutionary stages of the star, such as the [[red giant]] stage, the standard relationship for the determination of age no longer holds. However, when one can observe a red giant star with a known mass, one can calculate the main-sequence lifetime,&lt;ref name=swin-main-seq&gt;{{cite web|title=Main Sequence Lifetime|url=http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/M/Main+Sequence+Lifetime|work=Swinburne Astronomy Online|publisher=[[Swinburne University of Technology]]|accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus the minimum age of star is known given that it is in an advanced stage of its evolution. As the star spends only about 1% of its total lifetime as a red giant,&lt;ref name=swin-red-giant&gt;{{cite web|title=Red giant stars|url=http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/R/Red+giant+stars|work=Swinburne Astronomy Online|publisher=Swinburne University of Technology|accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is an accurate method of determining age.

==Stellar age estimation of stars==
[[File:EtaCarinae.jpg|250px|thumb|Eta Carinae, a star system that is violently ejecting gas.]]Various properties of stars can also be used to determine their age. For example, the [[Eta Carinae]] system is emitting large quantities of gas and dust. These enormous outbursts can be used to infer that the star system is nearing the end of its life, and will explode as a [[supernova]] within a relatively short period of astronomical time.&lt;ref name=apod-2006&gt;{{Cite APOD|title=Doomed Star Eta Carinae|access-date=7 March 2012|date=26 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Very large stars like [[VY Canis Majoris]], one of the [[List of largest known stars|largest stars known]], together with [[Mu Cephei]], [[Betelgeuse]] and [[UY Scuti]] all have radii larger than that of the average orbital radius of [[Jupiter]] in the [[Solar System]], thus showing that they are in extremely late evolutionary stages.&lt;ref name=vy-cm&gt;{{cite web|last=Cain|first=Fraser|title=VY Canis Majoris|url=http://www.universetoday.com/65650/vy-canis-majoris/|publisher=[[Universe Today]]|accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Betelgeuse in particular is expected to die in a supernova explosion within the next million years.&lt;ref name=oneill-betelgeuse&gt;{{cite news|last=Ian|first=O'Neill|title=DON'T PANIC: Betelgeuse Won't Explode in 2012|url=http://news.discovery.com/space/dont-panic-betelgeuse-wont-explode-in-2012.html|publisher=Discovery News|accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as the scenarios of supermassive stars violently casting off their outer layers before their deaths, other examples can be found of the properties of stars which illustrate their age. For example, [[Cepheid variables]] have a characteristic pattern in their [[lightcurve]]s, the rate of repetition of which is dependent on the luminosity of the star.&lt;ref name=soper-cepheid&gt;{{cite web|last=Soper|first=Davidson E.|title=Cepheid Variable Stars|url=http://zebu.uoregon.edu/~soper/MilkyWay/cepheid.html|work=ASTR 123|accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since Cepheid variables are a relatively short evolutionary stage in the lifecycle of stars, and knowing the mass of the star allows for the star to be tracked in its evolutionary path, one can estimate the age of the Cepheid variable.

Exceptional stellar properties which allow for an estimation of age are not confined to advanced evolutionary stages. When a roughly solar-mass star exhibitis [[T Tauri star|T Tauri variability]], astronomers can locate the age of the star as being before the beginning of the [[main sequence]] phase of the star's life.&lt;ref name=cain-622009&gt;{{cite web|last=Cain|first=Fraser|title=T Tauri Star|url=http://www.universetoday.com/24802/t-tauri-star/|publisher=Universe Today|accessdate=7 March 2012|date=6 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, more massive pre-main-sequence stars could be [[Herbig Ae/Be star]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060917092653/http://astro.berkeley.edu/ay216/NOTES/Lecture27.pdf Herbig Ae/Be stars]&lt;/ref&gt; If a [[red dwarf]] star is emitting immense [[stellar flare]]s and [[x-rays]], the star can be calculated to be in an early stage of its main-sequence lifetime, after which it will become less variable and become stable.&lt;ref name=schirber-2009&gt;{{cite web|last=Schirber|first=Michael|title=Can Life Thrive Around a Red Dwarf Star?|url=http://www.space.com/6560-life-thrive-red-dwarf-star.html|publisher=[[Space.com]]|date=9 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clear}}

== Membership in a star cluster or system ==
[[File:47tuc salt.jpg|thumb|250px|[[47 Tucanae]], a [[globular cluster]].]]Membership in a [[star cluster]] or [[star system]] permits an assignment of rough ages to a large number of stars present within. When one can determine the age of stars through other methods, such as the ones listed above, one can identify the age of all of the bodies in a system.&lt;ref name=jiminez-1998&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jiminez|first=Raul|title=Globular cluster ages|date=6 January 1998|volume=95|issue=1|pages=13–17|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/95/1/13.full|accessdate=7 March 2012|pmid=9419317|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|pmc=34183|doi=10.1073/pnas.95.1.13|bibcode = 1998PNAS...95...13J }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially useful in clusters of stars which exhibit a large amount of variety in their stellar masses, evolutionary stages, and classifications. While not ''entirely'' independent of the properties of the stars in the cluster, system, or other reasonably-sized association of stars, an astronomer would only need a representative sample of stars to determine the age of the cluster, rather than painstakingly finding the age of every star in the cluster through other properties.

In addition, knowing the age of one member of a star system can help determine the age of that system. In a star system, stars almost always form at the same time as each other, and given the age of one star, the age of all of the others can be known.&lt;ref name=astro-161&gt;{{cite web|title=Binary Star Systems Versus Planetary System|url=http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/solarsys/binary.html|work=Astronomy 161 lectures|accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this method does not work for [[galaxies]]. These units are much larger, and are not merely a one-off creation of stars which allows their age to be determined in this fashion. The creation of stars in a galaxy takes place over billions of years,&lt;ref name=utoday-08&gt;{{cite web|last=Wethington|first=Nicholos|title=Age of the Milky Way|url=http://www.universetoday.com/21822/age-of-the-milky-way/|work=Universe Today|accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though star production may long since have ceased (see [[elliptical galaxy]]). The oldest stars in a galaxy can only set a minimum age for the galaxy (when star formation began) but by no means determine the actual age.&lt;ref name=wethington-2008-2&gt;{{cite web|last=Wethington|first=Nicholos|title=Facts about the Milky Way|url=http://www.universetoday.com/22285/facts-about-the-milky-way/|work=Universe Today|accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Presence of a protoplanetary disk ==
{{see also|Protoplanetary disk}}
Along with other factors, the presence of a [[protoplanetary disk]] sets a maximum limit on the age of stars. Stars with protoplanetary disks are typically young, having moved onto the main sequence only a relatively short time ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Initial Conditions of Planet Formation: Lifetimes of Primordial Disks|author=Mamajek, E.E.|year=2009|journal=AIP Conference Proceedings|volume=1158|pages=3–10|bibcode=2009AIPC.1158....3M|doi=10.1063/1.3215910|last2=Usuda|first2=Tomonori|last3=Tamura|first3=Motohide|last4=Ishii|first4=Miki|ref=harv|arxiv = 0906.5011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, this disk would coalesce to form [[planets]], with leftover material being deposited into various [[asteroid belt]]s and other similar locations. However, the presence of [[pulsar planet]]s complicates this method as a determinant of age.

==Gyrochronology==
{{main article|Gyrochronology}}

Gyro-chronology is a method used to determine the age of [[field stars]] by measuring their rotation rate, and then comparing this rate with the rotation rate of the Sun, which serves as a precalibrated clock for this measurement.&lt;ref name=astrobio&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.astrobio.net/pressrelease/2315/gyrochronology | title=Gyrochronology | work=Astrobiology Magazine | accessdate=March 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method has been seen as a more accurate method for the determination of stellar ages than other methods for field stars.&lt;ref name=astrobio /&gt;

[[Image:FlattenedRoundPills.jpg|thumb|Common disk-shaped tablets]]

A '''tablet''' is a [[Pharmacy|pharmaceutical]] dosage form. Tablets may be defined as the solid unit dosage form of medicament or medicaments with or without suitable [[excipient]]s and prepared either by molding or by compression. It comprises a mixture of active substances and excipients, usually in [[powder (substance)|powder]] form, pressed or compacted from a powder into a solid dose. The excipients can include [[diluent]]s, [[Binder (material)|binder]]s or granulating agents, [[glidant]]s (flow aids) and [[lubricant]]s to ensure efficient tabletting; [[Excipient#Disintegrants|disintegrant]]s to promote tablet break-up in the digestive tract; [[sweetener]]s or flavours to enhance taste; and pigments to make the tablets visually attractive or aid in visual identification of an unknown tablet. A polymer coating is often applied to make the tablet smoother and easier to swallow, to [[controlled release|control the release rate]] of the active ingredient, to make it more resistant to the environment (extending its shelf life), or to enhance the tablet's appearance.

The compressed tablet is the most popular [[dosage form]] in use today. About two-thirds of all [[medical prescription|prescription]]s are dispensed as solid dosage forms, and half of these are compressed tablets. A tablet can be formulated to deliver an accurate dosage to a specific site; it is usually taken orally, but can be administered [[Sublingual administration|sublingually]], [[Buccal administration|buccally]], [[rectum|rectally]] or [[Vagina|intravaginally]].  The tablet is just one of the many forms that an oral drug can take such as [[syrup]]s, [[elixir]]s, [[suspension (chemistry)|suspension]]s, and [[emulsion]]s. Medicinal tablets were originally made in the shape of a disk of whatever color their components determined, but are now made in many shapes and colors to help distinguish different medicines. Tablets are often stamped with symbols, letters, and numbers, which enable them to be identified. Sizes of tablets to be swallowed range from a few millimeters to about a centimeter.

==History==
Pills are thought to date back to around 1500 BC.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/mar/25/health/he-booster25|title=The Colorful History of Pills Can Fill Many a Tablet|work=latimes|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919164837/http://articles.latimes.com/2002/mar/25/health/he-booster25|archivedate=2015-09-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier medical recipes, such as those from 4000 BC, were for liquid preparations rather than solids.&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt; The first references to pills were found on papyruses in ancient Egypt, and contained bread dough, honey or grease. Medicinal ingredients, such as plant powders or spices, were mixed in and formed by hand to make little balls, or pills.
In ancient Greece, such medicines were known as ''katapotia'' ("something to be swallowed"), and the Roman scholar Pliny, who lived from 23-79 AD, first gave a name to what we now call pills, calling them ''pilula''.&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt;

Pills have always been difficult to swallow and efforts long have been made to make them go down easier. In medieval times, people coated pills with slippery plant substances. Another approach, used as recently as the 19th century, was to gild them in gold and silver, although this often meant that they would pass through the digestive tract with no effect.&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt; In the 1800s sugar-coating and gelatin-coating was invented, as were [[Capsule (pharmacy)|gelatin capsules]].&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt;

In 1843, the British painter and inventor [[William Brockedon]] was granted a patent for a machine capable of "Shaping Pills, Lozenges and Black Lead by Pressure in Dies". The device was capable of compressing powder into a tablet without use of an adhesive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://archive.org/stream/b19974760M4060#page/n45/mode/2up/search/brockedon | title=Inventor of the Compressed Tablet: William Brockedon | journal=The Chemist and Druggist | date=August 1954 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160514050039/https://archive.org/stream/b19974760M4060#page/n45/mode/2up/search/brockedon | archivedate=2016-05-14 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A pill was originally defined as a small, round, solid pharmaceutical [[oral administration|oral]] [[dosage form]] of medication. The oldest known pills were made of the zinc carbonates [[hydrozincite]] and [[smithsonite]]. The pills were used for sore eyes, and were found aboard a Roman ship [[Relitto del Pozzino]] which wrecked in 140 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23049-worlds-oldest-pills-treated-sore-eyes.html|title=World's oldest pills treated sore eyes|work=New Scientist|date=7 January 2013|accessdate=5 February 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122102750/http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23049-worlds-oldest-pills-treated-sore-eyes.html|archivedate=22 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/110/4/1193|title=Ingredients of a 2,000-y-old medicine revealed by chemical, mineralogical, and botanical investigations|work=PNAS|date=7 January 2013|accessdate=5 February 2013|doi=10.1073/pnas.1216776110|volume=110|pages=1193–1196|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208021858/http://www.pnas.org/content/110/4/1193|archivedate=8 February 2013|df=|pmc=3557061}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, pills include tablets, capsules, and variants thereof like caplets — essentially, any solid form of medication colloquially falls into the pill category.

===Caplet===
[[Image:Four colors of pills.jpg|thumb|Variations on a common tablet design, which can be distinguished by both color and shape]]
A caplet is a smooth, coated, oval-shaped medicinal tablet in the general shape of a [[capsule (pharmacy)|capsule]]. Many caplets have an indentation running down the middle so they may be split in half more easily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.drugs.com/article/pill-splitting.html |title=Pill Splitting - A Safe Way to Save Healthcare Dollars? |last=Anderson |first=Leigh |publisher=[[Drugs.com]] |date=2014-02-24 |accessdate=2016-04-29 |quote=Many pills that can be safely split have a “score”, a line down the middle of the pill, that allows for easier splitting. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160501013112/http://www.drugs.com/article/pill-splitting.html |archivedate=2016-05-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since their inception, capsules have been viewed by consumers as the most efficient method of taking medication.

===Orally disintegrating tablet (ODT)===


An [[orally disintegrating tablet]] or orodispersible tablet (ODT), is a drug [[dosage form]] available for a limited range of [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] (OTC) and [[Prescription drug|prescription]] medications.

==Tabletting formulations==
In the tablet-pressing process, it is important that all ingredients be fairly dry, powdered or granular, somewhat uniform in particle size, and freely flowing. Mixed particle sized powders  segregate during manufacturing operations due to different densities, which can result in tablets with poor drug or active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) content uniformity, but [[Granulation (making of granules)|granulation]] should prevent this. Content uniformity ensures that the same API dose is delivered with each tablet.

Some APIs may be tableted as pure substances, but this is rarely the case; most formulations include [[excipient]]s. Normally, a pharmacologically inactive ingredient (excipient) termed a ''binder'' is added to help hold the tablet together and give it strength. A wide variety of binders may be used, some common ones including [[lactose]], dibasic calcium phosphate, [[sucrose]], corn (maize) starch, microcrystalline [[cellulose]], povidone [[polyvinylpyrrolidone]] and modified cellulose (for example hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and hydroxyethylcellulose).

Often, an ingredient is also needed to act as a ''disintegrant'' to aid tablet dispersion once swallowed, releasing the API for absorption. Some binders, such as starch and cellulose, are also excellent disintegrants.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
Tablets are simple and convenient to use. They provide an accurately measured dosage of the active ingredient in a convenient portable package, and can be designed to protect unstable medications or disguise unpalatable ingredients. Colored coatings, embossed markings and printing can be used to aid tablet recognition. Manufacturing processes and techniques can provide tablets with special properties, for example, [[controlled release|sustained release or fast dissolving formulations]].

Some drugs may be unsuitable for administration by the oral route. For example, [[protein]] drugs such as [[insulin]] may be [[denaturation (biochemistry)|denatured]] by stomach acids. Such drugs cannot be made into tablets. Some drugs may be deactivated by the [[liver]] when they are carried there from the [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]] by the [[hepatic portal vein]] (the "[[first pass effect]]"), making them unsuitable for oral use. Drugs which can be taken [[sublingual administration|sublingually]] are absorbed through the [[oral mucosa]], so that they bypass the liver and are less susceptible to the first pass effect. The oral [[bioavailability]] of some drugs may be low due to poor [[absorption (pharmacokinetics)|absorption]] from the gastrointestinal tract. Such drugs may need to be given in very high doses or by [[injection (medicine)|injection]]. For drugs that need to have rapid onset, or that have severe [[side effect]]s, the oral route may not be suitable. For example, [[salbutamol]], used to treat problems in the [[respiratory system]], can have effects on the [[heart]] and [[circulatory system|circulation]] if taken orally; these effects are greatly reduced by inhaling smaller doses direct to the required site of action. A proportion of the population have difficulties swallowing tablets either because they just don't like taking them or because their medical condition makes it difficult for them ([[dysphagia]], [[vomiting]]).  In such instances it may be better to consider alternative dosage form or administration route.

==Tablet properties==
Tablets can be made in virtually any shape, although requirements of patients and tableting machines mean that most are round, oval or capsule shaped. More unusual shapes have been manufactured but patients find these harder to swallow, and they are more vulnerable to chipping or manufacturing problems.

Tablet diameter and shape are determined by the machine tooling used to produce them - a die plus an upper and a lower punch are required. This is called a station of tooling. The thickness is determined by the amount of tablet material and the position of the punches in relation to each other during compression. Once this is done, we can measure the corresponding pressure applied during compression. The shorter the distance between the punches, thickness, the greater the pressure applied during compression, and sometimes the harder the tablet. Tablets need to be hard enough that they don't break up in the bottle, yet friable enough that they disintegrate in the gastric tract.

Tablets need to be strong enough to resist the stresses of packaging, shipping and handling by the pharmacist and patient.  The mechanical strength of tablets is assessed using a combination of (i) simple failure and erosion tests, and (ii) more sophisticated engineering tests. The simpler tests are often used for quality control purposes, whereas the more complex tests are used during the design of the formulation and manufacturing process in the research and development phase.  Standards for tablet properties are published in the various international pharmacopeias (USP/NF, EP, JP, etc.).  The hardness of tablets is the principle measure of mechanical strength.  Hardness is tested using a [[Tablet hardness testing|tablet hardness tester]].  The units for hardness have evolved since the 1930s, but are commonly measured in kilograms per square centimeter. Models of tester include the Monsanto (or Stokes) Hardness Tester from 1930, the Pfizer Hardness Tester from 1950, the Strong Cob Hardness Tester and the Heberlain (or Schleeniger) Hardness Tester.

Lubricants prevent ingredients from clumping together and from sticking to the tablet punches or capsule filling machine. Lubricants also ensure that tablet formation and ejection can occur with low friction between the solid and die wall, as well as between granules, which helps in uniform filling of the die.

Common minerals like talc or silica, and fats, e.g. vegetable stearin, magnesium stearate or stearic acid are the most frequently used lubricants in tablets or hard gelatin capsules.

==Manufacturing==

===Manufacture of the tableting blend===
In the tablet pressing process, the main guideline is to ensure that the appropriate amount of active ingredient is in each tablet.  Hence, all the ingredients should be well-mixed. If a sufficiently homogenous mix of the components cannot be obtained with simple blending processes, the ingredients must be granulated prior to compression to assure an even distribution of the active compound in the final tablet. Two basic techniques are used to granulate powders for compression into a tablet: wet granulation and dry granulation.  Powders that can be mixed well do not require granulation and can be compressed into tablets through direct compression.

===Wet granulation===
Wet granulation is a process of using a liquid binder to lightly agglomerate the powder mixture.  The amount of liquid has to be properly controlled, as over-wetting will cause the granules to be too hard and under-wetting will cause them to be too soft and friable. Aqueous solutions have the advantage of being safer to deal with than solvent-based systems but may not be suitable for drugs which are degraded by hydrolysis.
;Procedure
# The active ingredient and excipients are weighed and mixed.
# The wet granulate is prepared by adding the liquid binder–adhesive to the powder blend and mixing thoroughly. Examples of binders/adhesives include aqueous preparations of cornstarch, natural gums such as acacia, cellulose derivatives such as methyl cellulose, [[gelatin]], and povidone.
# Screening the damp mass through a mesh to form pellets or granules.
# Drying the granulation.  A conventional tray-dryer or fluid-bed dryer are most commonly used.
# After the granules are dried, they are passed through a screen of smaller size than the one used for the wet mass to create granules of uniform size.

Low shear wet granulation processes use very simple mixing equipment, and can take a considerable time to achieve a uniformly mixed state.  High shear wet granulation processes use equipment that mixes the powder and liquid at a very fast rate, and thus speeds up the manufacturing process. Fluid bed granulation is a multiple-step wet granulation process performed in the same vessel to pre-heat, granulate, and dry the powders.  It is used because it allows close control of the granulation process.

===Dry granulation===
Dry granulation processes create granules by light compaction of the powder blend under low pressures. The compacts so-formed are broken up gently to produce granules (agglomerates). This process is often used when the product to be granulated is sensitive to moisture and heat. Dry granulation can be conducted on a tablet press using slugging tooling or on a roll press called a roller compactor. Dry granulation equipment offers a wide range of pressures to attain proper densification and granule formation. Dry granulation is simpler than wet granulation, therefore the cost is reduced. However, dry granulation often produces a higher percentage of fine granules, which can compromise the quality or create yield problems for the tablet. Dry granulation requires drugs or excipients with cohesive properties, and a 'dry binder' may need to be added to the formulation to facilitate the formation of granules.

===Hot melt extrusion===
Hot melt extrusion is utilized in pharmaceutical solid oral dose processing to enable delivery of drugs with poor solubility and bioavailability. Hot melt extrusion has been shown to molecularly disperse poorly soluble drugs in a polymer carrier increasing dissolution rates and bioavailability. The process involves the application of heat, pressure and agitation to mix materials together and ‘extrude’ them through a die. Twin-screw high shear extruders blend materials and simultaneously break up particles.The extruded particles can then be blended and compressed into tablets or filled into capsules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Extrusion Speheronisation|url=http://www.pharmacmc.com/extrusion-spheronisation/|website=PharmaCMC.com|accessdate=26 September 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161001113908/http://www.pharmacmc.com/extrusion-spheronisation/|archivedate=1 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Granule lubrication===
After granulation, a final lubrication step is used to ensure that the tableting blend does not stick to the equipment during the tableting process.  This usually involves low shear blending of the granules with a powdered lubricant, such as [[magnesium stearate]] or [[stearic acid]].

===Manufacture of the tablets===
[[File:Tabletfailure.jpg|thumb|right|Tablets that failed due to capping and lamination compared to a normal tablet]]
Whatever process is used to make the tableting blend, the process of making a tablet by powder compaction is very similar.  First, the powder is filled into the die from above.  The mass of powder is determined by the position of the lower punch in the die, the cross-sectional area of the die, and the powder density.  At this stage, adjustments to the tablet weight are normally made by repositioning the lower punch.  After die filling, the upper punch is lowered into the die and the powder is uniaxially compressed to a porosity of between 5 and 20%.  The compression can take place in one or two stages (main compression, and, sometimes, pre-compression or tamping) and for commercial production occurs very fast (500–50 [[millisecond|ms]] per tablet). Finally, the upper punch is pulled up and out of the die (decompression), and the tablet is ejected from the die by lifting the lower punch until its upper surface is flush with the top face of the die.  This process is repeated for each tablet.

Common problems encountered during tablet manufacturing operations include:
* Fluctuations in tablet weight, usually caused by uneven powder flow into the die due to poor powder flow properties.
* Fluctuations in dosage of the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient, caused by uneven distribution of the API in the tableting blend (either due to poor mixing or separation in process).
* Sticking of the powder blend to the tablet tooling, due to inadequate lubrication, worn or dirty tooling, or a sticky powder formulation
* Capping, lamination or chipping.  This is caused by air being compressed with the tablet formulation and then expanding when the punch is released: if this breaks the tablet apart, it can be due to incorrect machine settings, or due to incorrect formulation: either because the tablet formulation is too brittle or not adhesive enough, or because the powder being fed to the tablet press contains too much air (has too low bulk density).
* Capping can also occur due to high moisture content.

===Tablet compaction simulator===
Tablet formulations are designed and tested using a laboratory machine called a Tablet Compaction Simulator or Powder Compaction Simulator. This is a computer controlled device that can measure the punch positions, punch pressures, friction forces, die wall pressures, and sometimes the tablet internal temperature during the compaction event. Numerous experiments with small quantities of different mixtures can be performed to optimise a formulation.
Mathematically corrected punch motions can be programmed to simulate any type and model of production tablet press. Initial quantities of active pharmaceutical ingredients are very expensive to produce, and using a Compaction Simulator reduces the amount of powder required for product development.

===Tablet presses===
[[Image:Tablet press animation.gif|thumb|The tablet pressing operation (click image to enlarge)]]
[[Image:Old tablet press.jpg|thumb|An old Cadmach rotary tablet press]]
[[Tablet press]]es, also called tableting machines, range from small, inexpensive bench-top models that make one tablet at a time (single-station presses), with only around a half-ton pressure, to large, computerized, industrial models (multi-station rotary presses) that can make hundreds of thousands to millions of tablets an hour with much greater pressure. The tablet press is an essential piece of machinery for any pharmaceutical and nutraceutical manufacturer. Common manufacturers of tablet presses include Natoli, Stokes, Fette Compacting, Korsch, Kikusui, Manesty, B&amp;D, PTK, IMA and Courtoy. Tablet presses must allow the operator to adjust the position of the lower and upper punches accurately, so that the tablet weight, thickness and density can each be controlled.  This is achieved using a series of cams, rollers, and/or tracks that act on the tablet tooling (punches).  Mechanical systems are also incorporated for die filling, and for ejecting and removing the tablets from the press after compression.  Pharmaceutical tablet presses are required to be easy to clean and quick to reconfigure with different tooling, because they are usually used to manufacture many different products.
There are 2 main standards of tablet tooling used in pharmaceutical industry: American standard ‘TSM’ and European standard ‘EU’. TSM and EU configurations are similar to each other but cannot be interchanged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apteka95.com.ua/en/directions/1861/|title=Articles :: ГК "Аптека-95"|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140127040853/http://apteka95.com.ua/en/directions/1861/|archivedate=2014-01-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tablet coating===
{{see also|Film coating}}
Many tablets today are coated after being pressed. Although sugar-coating was popular in the past, the process has many drawbacks. Modern tablet coatings&lt;ref&gt;Gendre C., Genty M., César da Silva J., Tfayli A., Boiret M., Lecoq O., Baron M., Chaminade P., Péan J-M., Comprehensive study of dynamic curing effect on tablet coating structure, Eur. J. Pharm. Biopharm., 81 (2012), 657-665&lt;/ref&gt; are [[polymer]] and [[polysaccharide]] based, with [[plasticizer]]s and [[pigment]]s included. Tablet coatings must be stable and strong enough to survive the handling of the tablet, must not make tablets stick together during the coating process, and must follow the fine contours of embossed characters or logos on tablets. Coatings are necessary for tablets that have an unpleasant taste, and a smoother finish makes large tablets easier to swallow. Tablet coatings are also useful to extend the shelf-life of components that are sensitive to moisture or oxidation. Special coatings (for example with pearlescent effects) can enhance brand recognition.

If the active ingredient of a tablet is sensitive to acid, or is irritant to the stomach lining, an [[enteric coating]] can be used, which is resistant to [[stomach]] acid, and dissolves in the less acidic area of the intestines. Enteric coatings are also used for medicines that can be negatively affected by taking a long time to reach the [[small intestine]], where they are absorbed. Coatings are often chosen to [[controlled release|control the rate of dissolution]] of the drug in the gastrointestinal tract. Some drugs are absorbed better in certain parts of the digestive system. If this part is the stomach, a coating is selected that dissolves quickly and easily in acid. If the rate of absorption is best in the large intestine or colon, a coating is used that is acid resistant and dissolves slowly to ensure that the tablet reaches that point before dispersing.

There are two types of coating machines used in the pharmaceutical industry: coating pans and automatic coaters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apteka95.com.ua/en/directions/1806/ Coating machines] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328095614/http://apteka95.com.ua/en/directions/1806/ |date=2012-03-28 }}, apteka95.com&lt;/ref&gt; Coating pans are used mostly to sugar coat pellets. Automatic coaters are used for all kinds of coatings; they can be equipped with a remote control panel, a dehumidifier, and dust collectors. An explosion-proof design is required for applying coatings that contain alcohol.

===Pill-splitters===

It is sometimes necessary to split tablets into halves or quarters. Tablets are easier to break accurately if scored, but there are devices called [[Pill splitting|pill-splitters]] which cut unscored and scored tablets. Tablets with special coatings (for example enteric coatings or [[controlled release|controlled-release]] coatings) should not be broken before use, as this will expose the tablet core to the digestive juices, circumventing the intended delayed-release effect.

'''''The Automatic Message''''' (1933) (''Le Message Automatique'') was one of [[André Breton]]'s significant theoretical works about automatism. The essay was first published in the magazine ''[[Minotaure]]'', No. 3-4, (Paris) 1933.

In 1997 it became the title of a compilation of [[surrealism|surrealist]] writing of [[André Breton]], [[Paul Éluard]] and [[Philippe Soupault]], amongst  others. The book includes two vital “automatic” texts of surrealism.

Breton’s prefatory essay ''The Automatic Message'' relates the technique to the underlying concepts and aesthetic of surrealism.

''[[Les Champs Magnétiques|The Magnetic Fields (Les Champs Magnétiques)]]'' (1919) by Breton and Soupault, was the first work of literary surrealism and one of the foundations of modern European thought and writing. ''The Automatic Message'' contains the authorised translation by the poet [[David Gascoyne]], himself a member of the group, and a friend of both authors.

''The Immaculate Conception'' (1930) traces the interior and exterior life of man from ''Conception'' and ''Intra-Uterine Life'' to ''Death and The Original Judgement'', and includes a section with a series of “simulations” of various types of mental instability.
