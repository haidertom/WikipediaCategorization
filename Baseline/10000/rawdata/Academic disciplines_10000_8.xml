Between 1890 and 1918, [[Scramble for Africa|Western colonial expansion in Africa]] led to the removal of many pieces of sub-Saharan [[African art]] that were subsequently brought to Europe and displayed.&lt;ref name="Coombes 1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Coombes|first=Annie E.|title=Reinventing Africa : museums, material culture and popular imagination in late Victorian and Edwardian England|year=1997|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=0300068905|edition=2nd pr}}&lt;/ref&gt; These objects entered the collections of natural history museums, art museums (both encyclopedic and specialist) and private collections in Europe and the United States.

==The removal of African artworks from their source countries during the 19th Century==
Before the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1885, traders and explorers to Africa bought or stole art as souvenirs and [[wikt:curios|curios]],&lt;ref name="Schildkrout and Keim" /&gt; speading beyond the coast; ivory objects made along African coasts had been collected for centuries, and many were made by Africans for European markets in a style matching European taste, mainly in areas reached by the Portuguese, the [[Kongo_ivories#Afro-Portuguese_ivories|Afro-Portuguese ivories]]. The period dominated by curio collecting, in which objects served as souvenirs, was followed by a period of trophy collecting in which large collections of artifacts (mostly weapons), and animal skins, horns, and tusks from hunting expeditions, were a tangible means of showing penetration, conquest and domination.&lt;ref name="Schildkrout and Keim"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Scramble for Art in Central Africa|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|editor=Enid Schildkrout and Curtis A. Keim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the 1870s, thousands of African sculptures arrived in Europe in the aftermath of colonial conquest and exploratory expeditions. They were placed on view in museums such as the [[Musée d'Ethnographie du Trocadéro]], founded in 1878 in Paris, and its counterparts in other European cities.&lt;ref name="Murrell, African Influences" /&gt; At the time, these objects were treated as artifacts of colonized cultures rather than as artworks and were very cheap, often sold in flea markets and pawnshops.&lt;ref name="Murrell, African Influences"&gt;{{cite web|last=Denise|first=Murrell|title=African Influences in Modern Art|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/aima/hd_aima.htm|work=Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|location=New York|date=April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==European collections==
[[File:Musée du Congo, Tervuren, Belgium; one of five interior scen Wellcome V0014543.jpg|thumb|Art on display at the [[Royal Museum of Central Africa]].]]

The different histories of museums inEurope and the United States affected the collecting and display of African art in both places.&lt;ref name="Berzock &amp; Clark 2011" /&gt; European museums typically were founded as state institutions and thus their collections and displays were shaped by national interests. The appreciation of African objects purely as fine art in Europe was largely limited to private galleries in the early twentieth century. In Paris, dealers such [[Paul Guillaume]], [[Charles Ratton]] and [[Louis Carre]] played a role in the formation of major private collections of African art. The latter half of the twentieth century saw the opening of the first European art museums devoted to collecting and displaying African art, including the [[Barbier-Mueller Museum|Musee Barbier-Mueller]] in Geneva (1977), the [[Musee Dapper]] in Paris (1986),&lt;ref name="Berzock &amp; Clark 2011" /&gt; but many if not most general national art museums by then had collections.

===Royal Museum for Central Africa in Belgium===
In 1897, [[King Leopold II]] took advantage of the [[Brussels International Exhibition]] in [[Tervuren]] to promote his holdings of the [[Congo Free State|Congo]]. The [[Brussels International (1897)|1897 International Exhibition]] piqued scientific interest in the people and animals of Central Africa, thus King Leopold II decided to build on his promotion of Congo. The [[Royal Museum of Central Africa]] was established in 1898 as a permanent museum and scientific institution responsible for mounting exhibitions for the Belgian public and encouraging the study of Central Africa.&lt;ref name="Royal Museum for Central Africa"&gt;{{cite web|title=History: From Congo Museum to RMCA|url=http://www.africamuseum.be/museum/about-us/museum/history/Congomuseum|work=Royal Museum for Central Africa|accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===British Museum===

The Sainsbury African Galleries in the [[British Museum]] in London display 600 objects from the greatest permanent collection of African arts and culture in the world. The three permanent galleries provide a substantial exhibition space for the Museum's African collection comprising over 200,000 objects. A curatorial scope that encompasses both archaeological and contemporary material, including both unique masterpieces of artistry and objects of everyday life. A great addition was material amassed by Sir [[Henry Wellcome]], which was donated by the [[Wellcome Collection|Wellcome Historical Medical Museum]] in 1954. 

Highlights of the African collection include the [[Benin Bronzes|Benin]] and [[Igbo-Ukwu]] bronze sculptures, the beautiful [[Bronze Head of Queen Idia]], a magnificent [[Bronze Head from Ife|brass head]] of a Yoruba ruler from [[Ife]], the [[Apapa Hoard]] from Lagos, southern Nigeria, a dozen exquisite [[Kongo ivories#Afro-Portuguese ivories|Afro-Portuguese ivories]], Asante goldwork from Ghana including the [[Thomas Edward Bowdich|Bowdich]] collection, the rare [[Akan Drum]] from the same region in West Africa, a series of soapstone figures from the [[Kissi people]] in Sierra Leone and Liberia, the [[Emil Torday|Torday]] collection of Central African sculpture, textiles and weaponry, important material from Ethiopia following the [[British Expedition to Abyssinia]], the unique [[Luzira Head]] from Uganda, excavated objects from [[Great Zimbabwe]] and satellite towns such as [[Mutare]] including a large hoard of Iron Age soapstone figures, a rare divining bowl from the [[Venda]] peoples and cave paintings and [[petroglyph]]s from [[Wildebeest Kuil Rock Art Centre|South Africa]].


The [[Benin Bronzes]] were seized by a [[United Kingdom|British]] force in the [[Benin Expedition of 1897]] and given to the British [[Foreign Office]]. As Paula Girshick Ben-Amos, a professor of anthropology and African Studies at Indiana University, states in The Art of Benin, “art of the Benin Kingdom came to public and scholarly attention in the West in 1897 when members of a British Punitive Expedition brought out thousands of objects as war booty.”2

Around 200 of the bronzes were passed on to the British Museum, while the remainder were divided among a variety of collections, with the majority being purchased by [[Felix von Luschan]] on behalf of the ''Königliches Museum für Völkerkunde'' in [[Berlin]] (the present-day [[Ethnological Museum of Berlin|Ethnological Museum]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=von Luschan|first=Feliz|title=Die Altertümer von Benin|year=1919|location=Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, Oba [[Akenzua II]] began the movement to return the corpus of objects now known in modern discourse as the 'Benin Bronzes'.

===Musée d'Ethnographie du Trocadéro===
The Musée d'Ethnographie du Trocadéro was the first [[Anthropology|anthropological]] museum in Paris, founded in 1878. It closed in 1935 when the building that housed it, the [[Trocadéro#The old Palais du Trocadéro|Trocadéro Palace]], was demolished; its descendant is the [[Musée de l'Homme]], housed in the [[Trocadéro#The new Palais de Chaillot|Palais de Chaillot]] on the same site, and its French collections formed the nucleus of the [[Musée national des Arts et Traditions Populaires (France)|Musée National des Arts et Traditions Populaires]], also in the Palais de Chaillot. Numerous [[Fauvism|Fauvist]] and [[Cubism|Cubist]] artists discovered African art at the Trocadéro Museum.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Paul Crespelle, ''The Fauves'', tr. Anita Brookner, Greenwich, Connecticut: New York Graphic Society, 1962, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=fLIcTrzKNJOssAPtgrmhBQ&amp;ct=result&amp;id=yxcOAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Fauves+Trocad%C3%A9ro&amp;q=In+1904%2C+the+two+had+been+in+the+habit+of+visiting+the+Trocadero+Museum+%E2%80%94+ancestor+of+the+Musee+de+I%27Homme+%E2%80%94+to+look+at+the+African+and+Polynesian+collections.+They+regarded+them+simply+as+curiosities%2C+and+it+was+not+until#search_anchor p. 114].&lt;/ref&gt; Picasso said that this art taught him "what painting was all about", seeing it in the museum's African masks, which had been created "as a kind of mediation between [humanity] and the unknown hostile forces that [surround us]",&lt;ref name=Gilot266&gt;Françoise Gilot and Carlton Lake, ''Life with Picasso'', 1964, repr. New York: Anchor/Doubleday, 1989, {{ISBN|978-0-385-26186-9}}, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=9eEZTuqRHoiisAPa8fDPDQ&amp;ct=result&amp;sqi=2&amp;id=8TfYAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Picasso+depressed+Gilot&amp;q=Trocadero#search_anchor p. 266].&lt;/ref&gt;  and to have been influenced by the masks in the forms of the figures in [[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]], which eventually led to Cubism.&lt;ref&gt;According to Christopher Green, ''Picasso: Architecture and Vertigo'', New Haven, Connecticut: Yale University, 2005, {{ISBN|978-0-300-10412-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=e2V5dnM_x4UC&amp;pg=PA51 p. 51] this is "generally accepted" although denied by Picasso himself.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur I. Miller]], ''Einstein, Picasso: Space, Time and the Beauty that Causes Havoc'', New York: Basic, 2001, {{ISBN|978-0-465-01859-8}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=VEPaSUitrDkC&amp;pg=PA92 p. 92]: [A]lthough the sharp change in the right-hand demoiselles occurred after Picasso's visit to Trocadéro, . . . . [i]t turns out that African art supported his conceptual approach and convinced him of the deep meaning of geometry as the language of the new art."&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the African collection has since been transferred to the [[Musee du Quai Branly]].

==African art in ethnological collections==
[[File:Drum - Kongo - Royal Museum for Central Africa - DSC05703.JPG|thumb|upright|A [[Kongo people|Kongo]] drum in the ethnographic collection of the Royal Museum for Central Africa.]]
Initially, all African art objects were viewed as [[ethnographic]] specimens.  Notably, during the period of 1890 through 1913, all large museums redefined their public image in terms of an educational prerogative.&lt;ref name="Coombes 1997" /&gt; In response to the debate around the use of the terms ''curio'' and ''curiosity'', the League of the Empire in 1904 recommended the "orderly arrangement and the transformation of mere curios into objects of scientific interest by appropriate classification."{{Ref|1}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=none|journal=Museums Journal|date=September 1904|volume=4|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, as a means of validating the expansion of ethnographic collections, the rhetoric often employed was one of the necessity of conservation and preservation in the face of the inevitable extinction of the producers of the materials culture in their custody (121).

[[Stewart Culin]], curator at the [[Brooklyn Museum]], was the first American curator to display ethnological collections as art objects, not as ethnographic specimens, which he did in 1923. Culin distinguished his installation from those of contemporaneous ethnological collections at institutions such as the [[American Museum of Natural History]] and the [[Smithsonian Museum of Natural History]] in saying that "the objects of Negro art which are displayed publicly form part of museum collections of African ethnology and receive no special attention at the hands of ethnologists... In the majority of these collections their artistic significance is obscured by the wealth of material, and lost, not infrequently, in the efforts made for its elucidation."&lt;ref name="Culin 1923"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Culin|first=Stewart|title=Negro art|journal=Brooklyn Museum Quarterly|year=1923|volume=10|issue=3|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Siegmann 2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Siegmann|first=William C.|title=African art a century at the Brooklyn Museum|year=2009|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|location=Brooklyn, NY|isbn=9780872731639|author2=Dumouchelle, Kevin D. (contributions)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''Art/Artifact'', an exhibition organized by [[Susan Vogel]] in 1988, presented 160 objects of art and ethnography selected from the [[Buffalo Museum of Science]], the [[Hampton University Museum]] (Virginia), and the [[American Museum of Natural History]] (New York City). All three are anthropology museums founded in the 1860s with distinguished African collections. The exhibition examined the shifting definitions of art and artifact, and dealt with the question of how we look at objects from traditional African cultures whose classification systems differ from contemporary Western culture.

==African art and Western Modernism==
During the early 1900s, the aesthetics of traditional African sculpture became a powerful influence among European artists who formed an avant-garde in the development of modern art, known as the "[[Primitivism]]" movement.&lt;ref name="Murrell, African Influences" /&gt; In France, [[Henri Matisse]], [[Pablo Picasso]], and their [[School of Paris]] friends blended the highly stylized treatment of the human figure in African sculptures with painting styles derived from the [[post-Impressionist]] works of [[Cézanne]] and [[Gauguin]]. The resulting pictorial flatness, vivid color palette, and fragmented [[Cubist]] shapes helped to define early [[modernism]]. While these artists knew nothing of the original meaning and function of the West and Central African sculptures they encountered, they claimed to instantly recognize the spiritual aspect of the composition and to adapt these qualities to their own efforts to move beyond the naturalism that had defined Western art since the Renaissance.&lt;ref name="Murrell, African Influences" /&gt;

[[German Expressionist]] painters such as [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]] of [[Die Brücke]] (The Bridge) group, based in [[Dresden]] and [[Berlin]], conflated African aesthetics with the emotional intensity of dissonant color tones and figural distortion, to depict the anxieties of modern life, while [[Paul Klee]] of the [[Blaue Reiter]] (Blue Rider) in [[Munich]] developed transcendent symbolic imagery.&lt;ref name="Murrell, African Influences" /&gt; The Expressionists' interest in non-Western art intensified after a 1910 [[Gauguin]] exhibition in [[Dresden]], while modernist movements in Italy, England, and the United States initially engaged with African art through contacts with School of Paris artists. These [[avant-garde]] artists, their dealers, and leading critics of the era were among the first Europeans to collect African sculptures for their aesthetic value.

==American collections==
The 1913 [[Armory Show]] marked a seminal moment for America’s [[avant-garde]]. An exposition of about 1,300 works, it introduced the New York art audience to movements like [[Cubism]], [[Fauvism]] and [[Futurism]], as well as the work of European artists including [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]]. The Armory Show and its promotion of [[Modernism]] also helped create a taste and a market for African art in New York.&lt;ref name="Murrell, African Influences" /&gt;

Notably, in 1914 two New York galleries introduced African sculpture to their audiences: [[Robert J. Coady]]’s newly opened [[Washington Square Gallery]] and [[Alfred Stieglitz]]'s well-established [[Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession]]. Stieglitz’s held an exhibition in 1914 dedicated entirely to African artifacts as works of art.&lt;ref name="Met Press Room" /&gt;

New York City progressively positioned itself as a central marketplace for African art.&lt;ref name="Murrell, African Influences" /&gt; During the years 1915-19, American dealers began promoting African objects as art to a growing group of collectors. Among the dealers, Mexican artist [[Marius de Zayas]] (1880–1961) was largely responsible for helping some adventurous modern-art collectors, including [[Walter Arensberg|Walter and Louise Arensberg]], [[John Quinn (collector)|John Quinn]], and Agnes and [[Eugene Meyer (financier)|Eugene Meyer]], to build their African art collections. During the early 1920s, several American institutions began opening their doors to African art.&lt;ref name="Met Press Room"&gt;{{cite web|title=Special Exhibition Tells Story of How African Artifacts Were First Recognized as Art in U.S.|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/press-room/exhibitions/2012/african-art-new-york-and-the-avant-garde|work=Press Room|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brooklyn Museum===
[[File:Brooklyn Museum 69.133.5 Mask.jpg|thumb|upright|A mask of the [[We people]] at the Brooklyn Museum.]]
In 1903, [[Stewart Culin]] (1858–1929) became the founding curator of the Department of Ethnology at the Museum of the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences, now the [[Brooklyn Museum]].&lt;ref name="Siegmann 2009" /&gt;  Culin, a self-taught ethnologist, built the foundation of four curatorial collections for the Museum, acquiring objects representing African, Asian, Native American, and Eastern European cultures. Culin was among the first curators to recognize museum installation as an art form. He was also among the first to display ethnological collections as art objects, not as ethnographic specimens. This approach is evidenced in his exhibition "Primitive Negro Art, Chiefly from the Belgian Congo". The exhibition opened in April 1923, and displayed African objects he had acquired in Europe from dealers.

===Barnes Foundation===
[[Albert C. Barnes|Albert Barnes]] was one of the first American collectors to selectively acquire an extensive collection of African sculpture purely on aesthetic merits. In 1923, two years before the [[Barnes Foundation]] opening in [[Merion]], Pennsylvania, Barnes wrote, "When the foundation opens, negro art will have a place among the great manifestations of all times."&lt;ref&gt;Albert C. Barnes to Paul Guillaume, November 5, 1923, the Barnes Foundation Archives, Merion, Pennsylvania.&lt;/ref&gt; Through his active promotion of the foundation's collection of African sculpture and its aesthetic importance, Barnes himself played a critical role in fostering appreciation of African art in the United States in the early twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Berzock &amp; Clark 2011" /&gt;

===Museum of Primitive Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art===

Founded in 1954 by [[Nelson A. Rockefeller]] and [[Rene d'Harnoncourt]], the [[Museum of Primitive Art]] was the first art museum exclusively devoted to exhibiting and collecting works of art from Africa, Oceania, and the Americas for their aesthetic value rather than as ethnographic documents or colonial trophies.&lt;ref name="Ezra 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ezra|first=Kate|title=Representing Africa in American art museums : a century of collecting and display|year=2010|publisher=University of Washington Press|location=Seattle|isbn=9780295989617|authorlink=Collecting African Art at New York's Museum of Primitive Art|editor=Kathleen Bickford Berzock, Christa Clarke}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The museum closed in 1974, and its collection, staff and library were transferred to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] according to an agreement made between Rockefeller and the Met in 1969. The Museum of Primitive Art was in many ways an outgrowth of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA).&lt;ref name="Ezra 2010" /&gt;  It was located directly behind MoMA and was also built on Rockefeller-owned property. Rockefeller was MoMA's president and d'Harnoncourt was its director. MoMA's 1935 landmark exhibition African Negro Art was influential in shaping the director of the Museum of Primitive Art.&lt;ref name="Ezra 2010" /&gt; Today, the Museum of Primitive Art collection is housed in the Metropolitan Michael C. Rockefeller Wing.

===National Museum of African Art===
The [[National Museum of African Art]] in Washington D.C. was founded by [[Warren M. Robbins]] in 1964 as a private and relatively small collection. In 1979 the collection, by then about 8,000 objects, was taken over by the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and is now housed in a central if underground location on the [[National Mall]].

==Problems of display==
Many scholars and curators have debated the efficacy of different modes of display of African art in Western museums. Generally, scholars agree that the Western art museum was, and continues to be, incompatible with the contexts from which most traditional [[African arts]] emerged. The following quotation from Kathleen Bickford Berzock and Christa Clarke's introduction to their book ''Representing Africa in American Art Museum'' summarizes the reasons for this incompatibility:

{{quote|text="Art museums reinforced hierarchies of value based on media or genre, favoring paintings and sculpture created solely for artistic appreciation. In contrast, the visual arts of Africa encompass not only sculpture in wood and metal but also beadwork, textiles, basketry, and other works of diverse media, all of which may hold equal value for their creators. And while aesthetics may guide the production of art in Africa, often there are other social, religious, or political concerns that inform its design and use. With this range of forms and materials and the different circumstances of creation and use within society, the diverse arts of Africa were not suited to the aesthetic hierarchies and systems of classification established by art museums. Moreover, museum practices of collecting and display emphasized the artist as individual genius, the school of artists working in a similar style and vein, and chronology. Such categorization was not easily replicated with African objects, which were often collected with fragmentary documentation that rarely identified the individual artist or the specific time period of creation."&lt;ref name="Berzock &amp; Clark 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Berzock|first=Kathleen Bickford|title=Representing Africa in American Art Museums|year=2011|publisher=University of Washington Press|location=Seattle &amp; London|pages=3–19|authorlink=A Historical Introduction|author2=Christa Clark}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

==Post-1980s African Art==
Post-1980s [[curator]]ial approaches to collecting and displaying historical African art tend towards greater specialization, broadening definitions, and a desire for contextualization.&lt;ref name="Berzock &amp; Clark 2011" /&gt;

Curatorial debate surrounds questions about where boundaries should be drawn between traditional and modern, between African and the [[African diaspora]] in the Americas and Europe, and between [[sub-Saharan]] and [[North African]] art. In certain instances, tradition-based and contemporary works have been exhibited together, a practice that began with the exhibition "Astonishment and Power: Kingo Minkisi &amp; the Art of Renee Stout" at the National Museum of African Art in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="Atwood ARTnews"&gt;{{cite news|last=Atwood|first=Roger|title=African Art: Beyond the Masks|url=http://www.artnews.com/2012/09/17/beyond-the-masks/|accessdate=16 October 2013|newspaper=ARTnews|date=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this exhibition was criticized for suggesting a cultural continuity between pre-modern African art and African-American art today while ignoring crucial cultural differences between these two bodies of work.&lt;ref name="Cotter 1993"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cotter|first=Holland|title=ART VIEW; Art That's Valued for What It Can Do|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/18/arts/art-view-art-that-s-valued-for-what-it-can-do.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|accessdate=16 October 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=18 July 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Benin]] artist [[Meschac Gaba]]'s installation "Museum of Contemporary African Art" at [[Tate Modern]] belies the fact that there is no such thing as a museum of [[contemporary African art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Museum of Contemporary African Art|url=http://www.museumofcontemporaryafricanart.com/entree.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes==
:1.{{Note|1}}In 1903, the League of the Empire was founded in England with the aim of bringing children from different parts of the [[British Empire|Empire]] into contact with one another through correspondence, lectures and exchanges. A distinguished group of museum directors and officials headed a sub-committee of the League entitled 'School Museum Committee.'

'''The Animal Reproduction Research Institute''' (ARRI) may be considered to date back to 1968 when the first center for bull investigation in [[Egypt]] was established. Its main responsibilities were the examination of [[Bull#Artificial insemination|bulls used for artificial insemination]] or natural breeding purposes, in addition to examining samples received from districts throughout Egypt for diagnostic purposes. long before that time, however, different aspects of animal reproduction were practiced in an informal, and later, formal manner. for example, artificial insemination has been applied in a primitive fashion for hundreds of years. Fresh semen, collected from newly impregnated female animals, was injected into other female animals.

==Objectives==
*Improving the reproductive and productive efficiency of farm animals.
*Field application of the scientific research findings.
*Improvement of the laboratory and field studies as well as transfer of modern technologies.
The general goal of ARRI is to raise the reproductive efficiency of farm animals through organized scientific laboratory and field studies. Special consideration is directed towards investigating fertility problems, combating reproductive diseases, applying artificial insemination, conducting research on the freezability of semen, enhancing different aspects of the embryo transfer technique, investigating [[biology]] of reproduction issues, and developing programs for rearing calves and care of the udder.

==Achievements==
Main achievements of the institute in the area of research have influenced and significantly improved the reproductively of cattle, buffalo and sheep through:
*Improving reproductive potentials of farm animals.
*Diagnosis and control of neonatal diseases and mastitis.
*Prevention and treatment of reproductive diseases.
*Expanding of A.I and embryo transfer technique applications.
*Application of frozen semen technology in farms
*Reduction of inter calving intervals
*Detection of veterinary drug Residue in Animal tissue, secretion and products
*Improving Milk quality &amp; quantity 
*Early Pregnancy diagnosis by using Ultrasonography to avoid semen born diseases
*Examination of imported frozen semen for examination of females
*Vet. Companigns all over the country{{clarify|date=April 2016}} 
*Training of veterinarian to update and upgrade their skills

==Departments==
*Field Investigation
*Pathology of Reproduction
*Reproductive Diseases
*Artificial Insemination and Embryo Transfer
*Biology of Reproduction Research
*Biotechnology Unit
*Immunobiology and Immunopharmacology Unit

The '''''Apophthegmata Patrum''''' (lit. '''''Sayings of the Fathers''''')&lt;ref&gt;From the Greek: ''apo'', from; ''phtheggomai'', to cry out; ''pater, father''.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-la|Apophthegmata Patrum Aegyptiorum}} {{lang-el|ἀποφθέγματα τῶν ἁγίων γερόντων, ἀποφθέγματα τῶν πατέρων, τὸ γεροντικόν}})&lt;ref&gt;''Orthodox Encyclopedia, in Russian, Vol. 3, pp. 140-142.''&lt;/ref&gt; is the name given to various collections popularly known as of ''Sayings of the Desert Fathers'', consisting of stories and sayings attributed to the [[Desert Fathers]] and [[Desert Mothers]] from approximately the 5th century AD.&lt;ref name="Gould"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gould|first=Graham|title=Papers presented at the Thirteenth International Conference on Patristic Studies held in Oxford 1999|series=Studia Patristica|year=2001|publisher=Peeters Publishers|isbn=978-90-429-0922-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''W. Bousset. Apophthegmata. Tuebingen, 1923, p. 68.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The collections consist of wisdom stories describing the spiritual practices and experiences of early Christian hermits living in the desert of Egypt. They are typically in the form of a conversation between a younger monk and his spiritual father, or as advice given to visitors. Beginning as an [[oral tradition]] in the [[Coptic language]], they were only later written down as Greek text. The stories were extremely popular among early Christian monks, and appeared in various forms and collections.&lt;ref name="Burton-Christie"&gt;{{cite book |author=Burton-Christie, Douglas |title=The Word in the desert: scripture and the quest for holiness in early Christian monasticism |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=1993|pages=76–84 |isbn=0-19-508333-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SIa0mNas_5MC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original sayings were passed down from monk to monk, though in their current version most simply describe the stories in the form of "Abba X said...." The early Desert Fathers and Desert Mothers also received many visitors seeking counseling, typically by asking "Give me a word, ''abba''" or "Speak a word, ''amma'', how can I be saved?" Some of the sayings are responses to those seeking guidance.&lt;ref name="Chryssavgis"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Chryssavgis, John |author2=Ware, Kallistos |author3=Ward, Benedicta |title=In the Heart of the Desert: Revised Edition: The Spirituality of the Desert Fathers and Mothers (Treasures of the World's Religions) |publisher=World Wisdom |page=4|location=Bloomington, Ind. |year=2008|isbn=1-933316-56-X |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=goeFHFiL2h0C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many notable Desert Fathers are mentioned in the collections, including [[Anthony the Great]], [[Arsenius the Great|Abba Arsenius]], [[Abba Poemen]], [[Macarius of Egypt|Abba Macarius of Egypt]], and Abba [[Moses the Black]].&lt;ref&gt;"Chryssavgis, pp. 19-29.&lt;/ref&gt; The sayings also include those of three different ''ammas'', or Desert Mothers, most notably [[Syncletica of Alexandria]].&lt;ref name="Chryssavgis" /&gt; ''Sayings of the Desert Fathers'' influenced many notable theologians, including [[Saint Jerome]] and [[Saint Augustine]].&lt;ref name="Flood"&gt;{{cite book |author=Flood, Gavin D. |title=The ascetic self: subjectivity, memory and tradition |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=0-521-60401-X |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r3s8zRmr-e8C&amp;pg=PA148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the text==
The Desert Fathers spoke [[Coptic language|Coptic]], a language related to ancient Egyptian. The sayings were originally passed on orally in that language. The earliest written record of the sayings appears to be from the end of the 4th century AD. Two versions from the 5th century, the ''[[Ethiopic Collectio Monastica|Collectio Monastica]]'', written in [[Ethiopic]], and the [[Asceticon|Asceticon of Abba Isaiah]], written in Greek, show how the oral tradition became the written collections.&lt;ref name="Burton-Christie" /&gt;

[[Pelagius]] and [[John the Deacon (Egyptian chronicler)|John the Deacon]] made the first translations of the ''Sayings'' into Latin. [[Martin of Braga]] also translated some of the sayings into Latin, followed by a more extensive translation by Paschasius of Dumium in approximately 555 AD.&lt;ref name="Iberian"&gt;{{cite book |author=Barlow, Claude |title=Fathers of the Church: Iberian Fathers: Martin of Braga/Paschasius of Dumium/Leander of Seville |publisher=Catholic University of America Press |location=Washington, D.C |year=1969 |pages=113–114 |isbn=0-8132-0062-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HaChb7wjNDkC&amp;pg=PA113}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
That work may contain only one-fifth of the original Greek text.&lt;ref&gt;Barlow, p. 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt; In the period 867-872 [[Saint Methodius of Thessaloniki]] translated the text into [[Old Church Slavonic]], of which the original was lost in the 14th century, but several dozen copies of the ''Патерікъ'' survived.&lt;ref name="Slavonic"&gt;{{cite book |author=Veder, William |title=The Scete Patericon v1-3 |publisher=Pegasus |location=Amsterdam |year=2012 |isbn=9789061433323 |url=https://www.pegasusboek.nl/poes-12-the-scete-paterikon.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century, the Dutch [[Jesuit]] [[Heribert Rosweyde]] compiled and translated all the available sources on the Desert Fathers and published them in Latin as the ''[[Vitae patrum]]''.

[[Helen Waddell]] translated a selection of elements from the ''Vitae Patrum'' into English in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Waddell, ''The desert fathers'' (translations from the ''Vitae Patrum''), London: Constable &amp; co., 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; The first complete translation of the "apothegmata" into English is that of [[Benedicta Ward]] (1975).&lt;ref&gt;Benedicta Ward, ''The sayings of the Desert Fathers : the alphabetical collection'', Kalamazoo, Michigan: Cistercian Publications, 1975 (revised edition, 1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Aramis, or the Love of Technology''''', was written by French [[sociologist]]/[[anthropologist]] [[Bruno Latour]]. ''Aramis'' was originally published in French in 1993; the English translation by Catherine Porter, copyrighted in 1996, {{ISBN|978-0-674-04323-7}}, is now in its fourth edition (2002). Latour describes his text as "scientifiction," which he describes as "a hybrid genre... for a hybrid task" (p. ix). The genre includes voices of a young engineer discussing his "sociotechnological initiation," his professor's commentary which introduces [[Actor-network theory]] (ANT), field documents - including real-life interviews, and the voice of Aramis—a failed technology (&lt;ref&gt;Latour, Bruno. (1996). Aramis, or the Love of Technology. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; p. x).

The book is a quasi-mystery, which attempts to discover who killed [[Aramis (personal rapid transit)]]. Aramis was supposed to be implemented as a [[Personal Rapid Transit]] (PRT) system in Paris. Simultaneously, while investigating Aramis's demise, Latour delineates the tenets of Actor-network theory. Latour argues that the technology failed not because any particular actor killed it, but because the actors failed to sustain it through negotiation and adaptation to a changing social situation.

'''Architectural theory''' is the act of thinking, discussing, and writing about [[architecture]]. Architectural theory is taught in most architecture schools and is practiced by the world's leading [[architect]]s. Some forms that architecture theory takes are the [[lecture]] or dialogue, the treatise or book, and the paper project or [[architectural design competition|competition entry]]. Architectural theory is often didactic, and theorists tend to stay close to or work from within schools. It has existed in some form since [[ancient history|antiquity]], and as publishing became more common, architectural theory gained an increased richness. Books, magazines, and journals published an unprecedented number of works by architects and critics in the 20th century. As a result, styles and movements formed and dissolved much more quickly than the relatively enduring modes in earlier history. It is to be expected that the use of the internet will further the discourse on architecture in the 21st century.

==History==

===Antiquity===
[[File:De architectura.jpg|thumb|left|200px|1521 Cesare Cesariano Italian translation of De Architectura Libri Decem (The Ten Books on Architecture) by Marcus Vitruvius Pollio. Preserved in the Smithsonian Museum of American History]]
There is little information or evidence about major architectural theory in antiquity, until the 1st century BCE, with the work of [[Vitruvius]]. This does not mean, however, that such works did not exist, given that many works never survived antiquity.

Vitruvius was a Roman [[writer]], [[architect]], and [[engineer]] active in the 1st century BCE. He was the most prominent architectural theorist in the Roman Empire known today, having written ''[[De architectura]]'' (known today as ''The Ten Books of Architecture''), a treatise written in [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] on architecture, dedicated to the emperor Augustus. Probably written between 27 and 23 BCE,&lt;ref&gt;Kruft, p. 447.&lt;/ref&gt; it is the only major contemporary source on classical architecture to have survived. Divided into ten sections or "books", it covers almost every aspect of Roman architecture, from town planning, materials, decorations, temples, water supplies, etc. It rigorously defines the classical [[orders of architecture]]. It also proposes the three fundamental laws that [[Architecture]] must obey, in order to be so considered: ''firmitas, utilitas, venustas'', translated in the 17th century by [[Sir Henry Wotton]] into the English slogan ''firmness, commodity and delight'' (meaning structural adequacy, functional adequacy, and beauty). The rediscovery of Vitruvius' work had a profound influence on architects of the Renaissance, adding archaeological underpinnings to the rise of the [[Renaissance]] style, which was already under way. Renaissance architects, such as Niccoli, Brunelleschi and Leon Battista Alberti, found in "De Architectura" their rationale for raising their branch of knowledge to a scientific discipline.

===Middle Ages===
Throughout the Middle Ages, architectural knowledge was passed by transcription, word of mouth and technically in master builders' lodges.&lt;ref&gt;Evers, Thoenes, et al., p.13.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the laborious nature of transcription, few examples of architectural theory were penned in this time period. Most works from this period were theological, and were transcriptions of the bible, so the architectural theories were the notes on structures included therein. The [[Abbot Suger]]'s ''Liber de rebus in administratione sua gestis'', was an architectural document that emerged with [[gothic architecture]]. Another was [[Villard de Honnecourt]]'s portfolio of drawings from about the 1230s.

In [[Song Dynasty]] China, Li Jie published the ''[[Yingzao Fashi]]'' in 1103, which was an architectural treatise that codified elements of [[Chinese architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;Liang Ssu-ch'eng. ''A Pictorial History of Chinese Architecture: a Study of the Development of its Structural System and the Evolution of its Types''. MIT press, 1984. {{ISBN|0-262-12103-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nancy
Shatzman Steinhardt ed. ''Chinese Architecture''. Yale University Press, 2002. {{ISBN|0-300-09559-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance===
The first great work of architectural theory of this period belongs to [[Leon Battista Alberti]], ''[[De Re Aedificatoria]]'', which placed Vitruvius at the core of the most profound theoretical tradition of the modern ages. From Alberti, good architecture is validated through the Vitruvian triad, which defines its purpose. This triplet conserved all its validity until the 19th century. A major transition into the 17th century and ultimately to the phase of Enlightenment was secured through the advanced mathematical and optical research of the celebrated architect and geometer [[Girard Desargues]], with an emphasis on his studies on conics, perspective and projective geometry.

===Enlightenment===
The Age of the Enlightenment witnessed considerable development in architectural theory on the European continent. New archeological discoveries (such as those of Pompeii and Herculaneum) drove new interest in Classical art and architecture. Thus the term Neoclassicism, exemplified by the writings of Prussian art critic [Johann Joachim Winkelmann], arose to designate 18th-century architecture which looked to these new Classical precedents for inspiration in building design.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Middleton and David Watkin, Neoclassicism and 19th-century architecture. The MIT Press, 1980 and Barry Bergdoll, European Architecture 1750–1890, Oxford University Press, 2000.l,&lt;/ref&gt;

Major architectural theorists of the Enlightenment include Julien-David Leroy, Abbé Marc-Antoine Laugier, Giovanni Battista Piranesi,  
Robert Adam, James Stuart, [[Georg Friedrich Hegel]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Jarzombek]], *[http://web.mit.edu/mmj4/www/downloads/footprint1.pdf "The Cunning of Architecture's Reason,"] Footprint (#1, Autumn 2007), pp. 31-46.&lt;/ref&gt;
and Nicholas Revett.

===19th century===
[[File:Essai sur l'Architecture - Frontispiece.jpg|thumb|left|200px| Frontispiece of Marc-Antoine Laugier: Essai sur l'Architecture 2nd ed. 1755 by Charles Eisen (1720-1778). Allegorical engraving of the Vitruvian primitive hut.]]
A vibrant strain of [[Neoclassicism]], inherited from [[Marc-Antoine Laugier]]'s seminal Essai, provided the foundation for two generations of international activity around the core themes of classicism, [[primitivism]] and a "return to Nature."

Reaction against the dominance of [[neo-classical architecture]] came to the fore in the 1820s with [[Augustus Pugin]] providing a moral and theoretical basis for [[Gothic Revival architecture]], and in the 1840s [[John Ruskin]] developed this ethos.

The American sculptor [[Horatio Greenough]] published the essay ''American Architecture'' in August 1843 in which he rejected the imitation of old styles of buildings and outlined the functional relationship between architecture and decoration. These theories anticipated the development of [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalism]] in [[modern architecture]].

Towards the end of the century, there occurred a blossoming of theoretical activity. In England, Ruskin's ideals underpinned the emergence of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] exemplified by the writings of [[William Morris]]. This in turn formed the basis for [[Art Nouveau]] in the [[UK]], exemplified by the work of [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]], and influenced the [[Vienna Secession]]. On the Continent, the theories of [[Viollet-le-Duc]] and [[Gottfried Semper]] provided the springboard for enormous vitality of thought dedicated to architectural innovation and the renovation of the notion of style. Semper in particular developed an international following, in [[Germany]], [[England]], [[Switzerland]], [[Austria]], [[Bohemia]], [[France]], [[Italy]] and the [[United States]]. The generation born during the middle-third of the 19th century was largely enthralled with the opportunities presented by Semper's combination of a breathtaking historical scope and a methodological granularity. In contrast to more recent, and thus "modern", thematically self-organized theoretical activities, this generation did not coalesce into a "movement." They did, however, seem to converge on Semper's use of the concept of ''Realismus'', and they are thus labelled proponents of [[architectural realism]]. Among the most active Architectural Realists were: [[Georg Heuser]], [[Rudolf Redtenbacher]], [[Constantin Lipsius]], [[Hans Auer]], [[Paul Sédille]], [[Lawrence Harvey (architect)|Lawrence Harvey]], [[Otto Wagner]] and [[Richard Streiter]].

===20th century===
In 1889 [[Camillo Sitte]] published ''Der Städtebau nach seinem künstlerischen Grundsätzen'' (translated as ''City Planning According to Artistic Principles'') which was not exactly a criticism of architectural form but an aesthetic criticism (inspired by medieval and [[Baroque]] town planning) of 19th-century urbanism. Mainly a theoretical work, it had an immediate impact on architecture, as the two disciplines of architecture and planning intertwined. Demand for it was so high that five editions appeared in German between 1889 and 1922 and a French translation came out in 1902. (No English edition came out until 1945.) For Sitte, the most important issue was not the architectural shape or form of a building but the quality of the urban spaces that buildings collectively enclose, the whole being more than the sum of its parts. The Modern Movement rejected these thoughts and [[Le Corbusier]] energetically dismissed the work. Nevertheless, Sitte's work was revisited by [[post-modern]] architects and theorists from the 1970s, especially following its republication in 1986 by Rizzoli, in an edition edited by Collins and Collins (now published by [[Dover]]). The book is often cited anachronistically today as a vehicle for the criticism of the [[Modern Movement]].

Also on the topic of artistic notions with regard to urbanism was [[Louis Sullivan]]'s ''The Tall Office Building Artistically Considered'' of 1896.&lt;ref&gt;Louis H. Sullivan. ''Kindergarten Chats and Other Writings.'' Courier Dover Publications, 1979. Page 202. {{ISBN|0-486-23812-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this essay, Sullivan penned his famous alliterative adage "form ever follows function"; a phrase that was to be later adopted as a central tenet of Modern architectural theory. While later architects adopted the abbreviated phrase "form follows function" as a polemic in service of functionalist doctrine,  Sullivan wrote of function with regard to biological functions of the natural order. Another influential planning theorist of this time was [[Ebenezer Howard]], who founded the [[garden city movement]]. This movement aimed to form communities with architecture in the [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts style]] at [[Letchworth]] and [[Welwyn Garden City]] and popularised the style as domestic architecture.

In [[Vienna]], the idea of a radically new [[modern architecture]] had many theorists and proponents. An early use of the term ''modern architecture'' in print occurred in the title of a book by [[Otto Wagner]],&lt;ref&gt;Otto Wagner. [https://books.google.com/books?id=AvgjAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq ''Moderne Architektur: Seinen Schülern ein Führer auf diesem Kunstgebiete.''] Anton Schroll. 1902.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Otto Wagner. Translated by Harry Francis Mallgrave. ''Modern Architecture: A Guidebook for His Students to This Field of Art.'' Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities. 1988. {{ISBN|0-226-86938-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; who gave examples of his own work representative of the [[Vienna Secession]] with [[art nouveau]] illustrations, and didactic teachings to his students. Soon thereafter, [[Adolf Loos]] wrote ''[[Ornament and Crime]]'', and while his own style is usually seen in the context of the [[Jugendstil]], his demand for "the elimination of ornament" joined the slogan "[[form follows function]]" as a principle of the architectural so-called [[Modern Movement]] that came to dominate the mid-20th century. [[Walter Gropius]], [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] and [[Le Corbusier]] provided the theoretical basis for the [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]] with aims of using industrialised architecture to reshape society. [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], while modern in rejecting historic revivalism, was idiosyncratic in his theory, which he conveyed in copious writing.  Wright did not subscribe to the tenets of the International Style, but evolved what he hoped would be an American, in contrast to a European, progressive course.  Wright's style, however, was highly personal, involving his particular views of man and nature. Wright was more poetic and firmly maintained the 19th-century view of the creative artist as unique genius.  This limited the relevance of his theoretical propositions.  Towards the end of the century [[postmodern architecture]] reacted against the austerity of High Modern (International Style) principles, viewed as narrowly normative and doctrinaire.

===Contemporary===
[[File:CIDADE - 201405 - 25 (14222237271).jpg|thumb|left|200px|A Cidade da Cultura / Eisenman Architects.]]
In contemporary architectural discourse theory has become more concerned with its position within culture generally, and thought in particular.  This is why university courses on architecture theory may often spend just as much time discussing philosophy and cultural studies as buildings, and why advanced postgraduate research and doctoral dissertations focus on philosophical topics in connection with architectural humanities. Some architectural theorists aim at discussing philosophical themes, or engage in direct dialogues with philosophers, as in the case of [[Peter Eisenman]]'s and [[Bernard Tschumi]]'s interest in [[Derrida]]'s thought, or [[Anthony Vidler]]'s interest in the works of [[Freud]] and [[Lacan]], in addition to an interest in [[Gaston Bachelard]]'s ''Poetics of Space'' or texts by [[Gilles Deleuze]]. This has also been the case with educators in academia like [[Dalibor Vesely]] or Alberto-Perez Gomez, and in more recent years this philosophical orientation has been reinforced through the research of a new generation of theorists (E.G. [[Jeffrey Kipnis]] or [[Sanford Kwinter]]).  Similarly, we can refer to contemporary architects who are interested in philosophy and cultural studies. Some are interested in [[Phenomenology (architecture)|phenomenology]], like [[Christian Norberg-Schulz]], or specialize as philosophers and historians of science, such as [[Nader El-Bizri]]. Others, like Manfredo Tafuri, are interested in new ontological definitions of architecture tracing a new notion of modernity in architecture. The notion that theory entails critique also stemmed from post-structural [[literary studies]] in the work of many other theorists and architects, such as Mark Wigley, among others. In their theories, architecture is compared to a language which can be invented and re-invented every time it is used. This theory influenced the so-called deconstructivist architecture.  In contrast, network society innovators, especially Silicon Valley software developers, have embraced [[Christopher Alexander]]'s emphasis on [[The Timeless Way of Building]] (1979) based on pattern languages that are optimized on-site as construction unfolds.

Since 2000, architectural theory has also had to face the rapid rise of urbanism and [[globalization]]. By developing a new understanding of the city, many theorists developed new understandings of the urban conditions of our planet (E.G. [[Rem Koolhaas]]'s ''Bigness''). Interests in fragmentation and architecture as transient objects further affected such thinking (e.g. the concern for employing high technology), but also related to general concerns such as [[ecology]], [[mass media]], and economism.

In the past decade, there has been the emergence of the so-called "Digital" Architecture. Several currents and design methodologies are being developed simultaneously, some of which reinforce each other, whereas others work in opposition. One of these trends is [[Biomimicry]], which is the process of examining nature, its models, systems, processes, and elements, to emulate or take inspiration from them in order to solve human problems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reading.ac.uk/biomimetics/about.htm Reading University: What is Biomimetics?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323042805/http://www.reading.ac.uk/biomimetics/about.htm |date=March 23, 2012 }} Retrieved 3 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Architects also design organic-looking buildings in the attempt to develop a new formal language. Another trend is the exploration of those computational techniques that are influenced by algorithms relevant to biological processes and sometimes referred to as [[Digital morphogenesis]]. Trying to utilize [[Computational creativity]] in architecture, [[Genetic algorithms]] developed in computer science are used to evolve designs on a computer, and some of these are proposed and built as actual structures. Since these new architectural tendencies emerged, many theorists and architects have been working on these issues, developing theories and ideas such as Patrick Schumacher's Parametricism.

Nonetheless, there is no evidence for claiming that we are witnessing the birth of an entirely new type of architectural theory and practice. 
Contemporary architecture's theoretical world is plural and multicolored. There are different dominant schools of architectural theory which are based on linguistic analysis, philosophy, post-structuralism, or cultural theory. For instance, there is emerging interest in the re-discovery of the post-modernist project ([[Sam Jacob]]), in the definition of new radical tendencies of architecture and its implication in the development of cities ([[Pier Vittorio Aureli]]), and in a new formalist approach to architecture through the appropriation of concepts from the [[Object Oriented philosophy]] ([[Peter Trummer]] or [[Tom Wiscombe]]). It is too early, however, to say whether any of these explorations will have widespread or lasting impact on architecture.

'''BGI''' ({{zh|c=华大基因|p=Huádà Jīyīn}}), known as the '''Beijing Genomics Institute''' prior to 2008, is a [[Whole genome sequencing|genome sequencing]] center, headquartered in [[Shenzhen]], [[Guangdong]], China.&lt;ref name=Beast&gt;Lone Frank, [http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2011/04/24/high-quality-dna.html High-Quality DNA], Apr 24, 2011, The Daily Beast&lt;/ref&gt; It was formed in 1999 to participate in the [[Human Genome Project]], and is the world's largest genetics research center.&lt;ref name="Wired17"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2017/05/chinese-genome-giant-sets-sights-uitimate-sequencer/|title=A Chinese Genome Giant Sets Its Sights on the Ultimate Sequencer|author=Megan Molteni|date=18 May 2017|publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|accessdate=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered to be world's leader in gene-sequencing services, sequencing genome also of other animals, plants and microorganisms.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite new|author=Shu-Ching Jean Chen|date=2 September 2013|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesasia/2013/08/28/genomic-dreams-coming-true-in-china/|title=Genomic Dreams Coming True in China|publisher=Forbes Asia|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 it bought the [[Complete Genomics]] of [[Mountain View, California]] for US$118 million, and develops, manufactures and markets genome sequencing technology.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==History==
Wang Jian, Yu Jun, [[Yang Huanming]] and Liu Siqi created BGI in November 1999,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; in Beijing, China as a non-governmental independent research institute in order to participate in the [[Human Genome Project]] as China's representative.&lt;ref name = BioITWorld/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dragon&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/16349434 The dragon's DNA], Jun 17th 2010, The Economist&lt;/ref&gt; After the project was completed, funding dried up. So BGI moved to [[Hangzhou]] in exchange for funding from the Hangzhou Municipal Government.

In 2002, BGI sequenced the rice genome which was a cover story in the journal [[Science (journal)|Science]]. In 2003 BGI decoded the [[SARS]] virus genome and created a kit for detection of the virus. In 2003, BGI Hangzhou and the [[Zhejiang University]] founded a new research institute, the [[James D. Watson Institute of Genome Sciences, Zhejiang University]]. The Watson Institute was intended to become a major center for research and education in East Asia modeled after the [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]] in the US.

In 2007 BGI's headquarters relocated to [[Shenzhen]] as "the first citizen-managed, non-profit research institution in China". Yu Jun left BGI at this time purportedly selling his stake to the other 3 founders for a nominal sum.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In 2008, BGI-Shenzhen was officially recognized as a non-profit organization by Shenzhen government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.genomics.cn/navigation/show_navigation.action?navigation.id=95 About BGI], BGI&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, BGI published the first human genome of an Asian individual.&lt;ref name = BioITWorld/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ye, Jia (2008) [http://www.asiabiotech.com/publication/apbn/12/english/preserved-docs/1201/0011_0013.pdf An  Interview with a Leader in Genomics — Beijing Genomics Institute] Asia Biotech, Retrieved 14b January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The project was started on 1 August 2009, with the mission to sequence 10,000 microbes within 3 years. It includes sequencing industrial, agricultural, medical microorganism and many others. It is done in collaboration with many institutes, universities and enterprises, including Biotechnology Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and the Tianjin Institute of Industrial Biotechnology of [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925040752/http://english.cas.cn/Ne/CASE/200908/t20090805_44705.shtml|title=''10,000 Microbe Genome Plan'' Starts in Shenzhen|date=5 August 2009|publisher=Chinese Academy of Sciences|accessdate=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bioinformatics technology==
In 2010, the institute 500-node supercomputer processed 10 terabytes of raw sequencing data every 24 hours from its current 30 or so Genome Analyzers from Illumina. The annual budget for the computer center was US$9 million.&lt;ref name="Petsko"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Petsko | first1 = G.

The algorithm, called SOAPdenovo, can assemble a genome in two days and has been used to sequence an array of plant and animal genomes.&lt;ref name="genomeweb.com"/&gt; 

SOAPdenovo is part of "[[Short Oligonucleotide Analysis Package]]" [[SOAP (Bioinformatics)|(SOAP)]], a suite of tools developed by BGI for de novo assembly of human-sized genomes, alignment, SNP detection, resequencing, indel finding, and structural variation analysis. Built for the Illumina sequencers' short reads, SOAPdenovo has been used to assemble multiple human genomes&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wang" /&gt; (identifying an eight kilobase insertion not detected by mapping to the human reference genome&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = BGI Uses New Short-Read Algorithm to Assemble Panda Genome as Proof of Concept for Human Genome &amp;#124; BioInform &amp;#124; Informatics &amp;#124; GenomeWeb | url = http://www.genomeweb.com/informatics/bgi-uses-new-short-read-algorithm-assemble-panda-genome-proof-concept-human-geno | publisher =  | date =  | accessdate = 28 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and animals, like the giant panda.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Until 2015, BGI had released BGISEQ-100, based on [[Thermo Fisher Scientific]]'s [[Ion semiconductor sequencing|Ion Torrent]] device, and BGISEQ-1000, based on similar technology by Complete Genomics, for both of which received an approval from the [[China Food and Drug Administration|CFDA]] for a NIFTY noninvasive prenatal test.&lt;ref name="BIOITW"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bio-itworld.com/2015/10/28/bgi-retools-complete-genomics-technology-new-high-throughput-benchtop-sequencer.html|title=BGI Retools Complete Genomics Technology for Its New High-Throughput Benchtop Sequencer|date=28 October 2015|work=Bio-ITWorld|publisher=Cambridge Healthtech Institute|accessdate=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="360DxBGI50"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.360dx.com/sequencing/bgi-launches-new-desktop-sequencer-china-registers-larger-version-cfda?utm_source=TrendMD&amp;utm_medium=TrendMD&amp;utm_campaign=0&amp;trendmd-shared=0#.XAPlbmhKiUk|title=BGI Launches New Desktop Sequencer in China, Registers Larger Version With CFDA|date=11 November 2016|work=360Dx|publisher=GenomeWeb|accessdate=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015, BGI launched BGISEQ-500,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.genomeweb.com/sequencing-technology/bgi-launches-desktop-sequencer-china-plans-register-platform-cfda|title=BGI Launches Desktop Sequencer in China; Plans to Register Platform With CFDA|author=Julia Karow|date=26 October 2015|publisher=GenomeWeb|accessdate=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; a larger desktop sequencing system, which received an approved registration as a medical device a year later by the CFDA.

'''Bride service''' has traditionally been portrayed in the [[Anthropology|anthropological]] literature as the service rendered by the [[bridegroom]] to a bride's family as a [[bride price]] or part of one (see [[dowry]]). Bride service and [[bride wealth]] models frame anthropological discussions of [[kinship]] in many regions of the world.&lt;ref&gt;

==Patterns==
Patterns of [[matrilocal]] post-marital residence, as well as the practice of temporary or prolonged bride service, have been widely reported for [[indigenous peoples]] of the [[Amazon basin]].&lt;ref&gt;

The length of uxorilocal residence and the duration of bride service are contingent upon negotiations between the concerned parties, the outcome of which has been characterized as an enduring commitment or permanent [[debt]].&lt;ref name=Rosengren&gt;{{cite book |title=In the eyes of the beholder: Leadership and the social construction of power and dominance among the Matsigenka of the Peruvian Amazon |date=1987 |page=127 |last=Rosengren |first=Dan |publisher=Göteborgs etnografiska museum |location=Göteborg}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gow&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gow |first=Peter |date=December 1989 |title=The perverse child: Desire in a native Amazonian subsistence economy |journal=Man |volume=24 |number=4 |pages=299–314}} &lt;/ref&gt; The [[Power (sociology)|power]] wielded by those who “give” wives over those who “take” them is also said to be a significant part of the political relationships in societies where bride service obligations are prevalent.&lt;ref name="Rivière 1997"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Rivière |first=Peter G |date=1977 |title=Some problems in the comparative study of Carib societies |encyclopedia=Carib-speaking Indians: culture, society, and language |editor-last=Basso |editor-first=Ellen B. |location=Tucson |publisher=University of Arizona Press |page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mentore |first=George P. |date=September 1987 |title=Waiwai women: the basis of wealth and power |journal=Man |volume=22 |number=3 |pages=511–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than seeing affinity in terms of a "compensation" model whereby individuals are exchanged as [[Object (philosophy)|object]]s, Dean’s (1995) research on Amazon bride service among the [[Urarina]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dean |first=Bartholomew |url=http://www.upf.com/book.asp?id=DEANXS07 |title=Urarina Society, Cosmology, and History in Peruvian Amazonia |location=Gainesville |publisher=University Press of Florida |date=2009 |isbn=978-0-8130-3378-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrates how differentially situated subjects negotiate the politics of [[marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dean |first=Bartholomew |title=Forbidden fruit: infidelity, affinity and bride service among the Urarina of Peruvian Amazonia |journal=Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute |volume=1 |number=1 |date=March 1995 |pages=87–110 |url=https://www.academia.edu/24961221}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Example==
An example of bride service occurs in the [[Hebrew Bible]], {{bibleverse||Genesis|29:16-29|NIV}}, when [[Jacob]] labored for [[Laban (Bible)|Laban]] for fourteen years to marry [[Rachel]]. Originally the deal was seven years, but Laban tricked Jacob by giving him [[Leah]] on their wedding day, so Jacob had to work another seven years to obtain the girl he had originally fallen in love with, Rachel.

The '''Centre for Polar Observation &amp; Modelling''' ('''CPOM''') is a centre for research into [[polar region]] processes which may affect: polar atmosphere and [[ocean circulation]]; the Earth's [[albedo]]; and global [[sea levels]]. It is funded by the [[Natural Environment Research Council]], a UK [[UK Research Councils|Research Council]].&lt;ref name=CPOM&gt;[http://www.cpom.org/ CPOM Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

CPOM comprises research groups from 3 Universities: [[University College London]], [[University of Bristol]], and [[University of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref name="CPOM"/&gt;

In 2006, research carried out by CPOM resulted in the press report "Secret rivers found in Antarctic".  The survey used the [[European Space Agency]]'s [[ERS-2]] satellite radar to measure a region in [[East Antarctica]] with some of the oldest, thickest ice on the continent. The survey revealed synchronous changes in ice surface height (both rise and falls) at locations hundreds of kilometres apart. According to CPOM Director, [[Duncan Wingham]], the only conceivable mechanism for the observations was the movement of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4908292.stm |author= Helen Briggs |title= Secret rivers found in Antarctic |publisher= BBC News |date= 19 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chiavette''' (plural of {{lang-it|chiavetta}}, {{IPA-it|kjaˈvetta|}} "little clefs") is a system of standard combinations of [[clef]]s used in [[polyphonic]] music of the 16th through 18th centuries, differing from the usual ''chiavi naturali'' (the combination of soprano, alto, tenor, and bass clefs.) Typically, these clefs place each [[staff (music)|staff]] line a third lower than usual.  (A second possible set of clefs, ''in contrabasso,'' places each staff line a third higher; this is less common outside of Franco-Flemish compositions.)

[[File:Chiavette1.svg|400px]]

The first author to mention a standard set of high clefs is [[Silvestro Ganassi dal Fontego]], in his 1543 ''Regula Rubertina'', chapter 22, which instructs the musician to transpose such music down a fifth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ganassi| first=Silvestro|title=Lettione Seconda Pur della prattica di Sonare...|year=1543|location=Venice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grove"&gt;{{cite Grove
  |title = Chiavette
  |last = Barbieri
  |first = Patrizio
  |year = 2001
  |doi = 10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.001.0001/omo-9781561592630-e-0000005567
  |ref = harv
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other theorists, such as [[Adriano Banchieri]] (1601) and Picerli (1631), indicate to transpose down a fifth if there is no key signature, and a fourth if there is a flat indicated. By mid-century, Italian commentators only mention a transposition down a fourth, and still later the practice seems to have been to transpose downward by a third to account for the high pitch of Italian organs.&lt;ref name="Grove"/&gt; The Austrian theorist Johann Baptist Samber (1707), meanwhile, gave as his rule to transpose downward by a fourth if the bass is notated in F3, but a fifth if it is notated in C4.&lt;ref name="Grove"/&gt;

The practice of transposition does not seem to have been universal; [[Thomas Morley]] implies that music ought to be sung in the key in which it was written&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morley| first=Thomas|title=A Plaine and Easie introduction to Practikall Musicke|year=1597|location=London|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Michael Praetorius]] indicates the choice to transpose or not depends on the ensemble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Praetorius| first=Michael|title=Syntagmatis Musici ... Tomus tertius|year=1619|location=Wolfenbüttel|page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Banchieri (1609) indicates that instrumental music should be read at pitch, in the higher clefs, while singers use the ''chiavi naturali'' at the written pitch.

This set of higher clefs was only given the name ''chiavette'' in the eighteenth century, by Girolamo Chiti (1718), by which time the practice itself had largely disappeared; by the mid-seventeenth century, most composers had adopted more flexible notational practices. It continued to linger in Rome, however, and was used at the papal chapel into the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="Grove"/&gt; 

Performance of pieces written in ''chiavette'' approximately a fourth lower than notated often results in a more consistent set of ranges across a given collection, although this is not always reflected in modern performing editions and recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Andrews |first1=H.K. |date=1962 |title="Transposition of Byrd’s Vocal Polyphony"|journal= Music and Letters |volume=43 |pages=25-37 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''China-EU Institute for Clean and Renewable Energy at Huazhong University of Science &amp; Technology''' ('''CE-ICARE'''; {{zh|华中科技大学中欧清洁与可再生能源学院}}) is an education and research institute located in [[Wuhan]], [[China]], created in July 2010 and hosted in [[Huazhong University of Science and Technology]]. ICARE is the third Sino-European institute being created in China after the China-EU International Business School &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceibs.edu China-EU International Business School (CEIBS)]&lt;/ref&gt; in Shanghai in 1994 (as China-EC Management Institute) and the China-EU School of Law&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cesl.edu.cn China-EU School of Law (CESL)]&lt;/ref&gt; in Beijing in 2008. ICARE project has a 5-year funding from EU and Chinese government.

The creation of ICARE follows an agreement signed in 2009 by European Commissioner for External Relations [[Benita Ferrero-Waldner]] and Chinese Minister for Foreign Trade GAO Hucheng in the frame of the collaboration between China and Europe for environmental protection and climate change mitigation.

ICARE mission is to support China in implementing activities in management and technology in order to reduce the consumption of fossil energy and carbon emissions through renewable energies and energy efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.master-clean-renewable-energy.eu/en/page/wrapperEditoFichier/id_fichier/14 Education a weapon in fight against record pollution in University World News]&lt;/ref&gt;

==ICARE ==
ICARE is providing education to university students as well as to Chinese professionals and as the strong will to become the reference institute on [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] and [[renewable energy in China]]. ICARE relies on a partner consortium of higher-education institutions composed of 7 European members from 5 countries and 3 Chinese members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.master-clean-renewable-energy.eu/en/page/wrapperEditoFichier/id_fichier/8 ICARE leaflet]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.master-clean-renewable-energy.eu/en/page/wrapperEditoFichier/id_fichier/12 ICARE poster]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programmes offered==

===Master degree in Clean and Renewable Energy===
It is a Double master's degree Programme, namely, the master programme of energy science and technology conferred by Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) in China, and the master programme of clean and renewable energy granted by ParisTech ([http://www.master-clean-renewable-energy.eu/en/article/43/43-en-general-informatio CARE]), for students who already have a degree in engineering or in another relevant scientific discipline in areas where there is a strong need for additional qualified workforce in China. Courses are taught in English by European and Chinese teachers, all experts in their fields. Main subjects are Solar Energy, Wind Energy, Biomass, Geothermal, Hydrogen and Energy Storage and Energy Efficiency. There is a six-month training period in laboratories in China or in Europe which allows the students to put into practice skills and knowledge acquired during courses. Presently 160 students are following the Master courses. First class was graduated (Master from ParisTech and Master from HuaZhong University) on March 15, 2013.

===Vocational training (VT) for energy professionals===
To meet the needs of domestic and international companies for professional training of their staff (decision makers, engineers, etc.) on CRE, ICARE aims at developing a VT platform. Tailored professional programmes are developed by European partners or associated partners. First sessions were held during three days in January 2013 on Photovoltaic energy technologies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://icare.hust.edu.cn/en/index.php/Index/detail/id/103/navigate/24 EU-funded advanced training course on solar photovoltaic technology] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130407151533/http://icare.hust.edu.cn/en/index.php/Index/detail/id/103/navigate/24 |date=2013-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research Platform==
A Research Platform (RP) is developed to facilitate exchange of Ph.D. students between European and Chinese universities and co-supervision of research activities. RP is also a contact facilitator between European professors, during their teaching stays in ICARE, and Chinese professors to meet and develop common research projects. Every year top specialists in CREN fields are delivering conferences at ICARE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/Conferences_at_ICARE_2012-2013.pdf  Conferences at ICARE 2012-2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Computational physics}}
'''Computational physics''' is the study and implementation of [[numerical analysis]] to solve problems in [[physics]] for which a quantitative theory already exists.&lt;ref name=ThijssenBook/&gt; Historically, computational physics was the first application of modern computers in science, and is now a subset of [[computational science]].

It is sometimes regarded as a subdiscipline (or offshoot) of theoretical physics, but others consider it an intermediate branch between theoretical and [[experimental physics]], a third way that supplements theory and experiment.&lt;ref name=ComPhysPy/&gt;

== Overview ==
[[File:Computational_physics_diagram.svg|thumb|A representation of the multidisciplinary nature of computational physics both as an overlap of physics, applied mathematics, and computer science and as a bridge among them.&lt;ref name=SurveyCompSci/&gt;]]
In physics, different [[theory|theories]] based on mathematical models provide very precise predictions on how systems behave. Unfortunately, it is often the case that solving the mathematical model for a particular system in order to produce a useful prediction is not feasible. This can occur, for instance, when the solution does not have a [[closed-form expression]], or is too complicated. In such cases, numerical approximations are required. Computational physics is the subject that deals with these numerical approximations: the approximation of the solution is written as a finite (and typically large) number of simple mathematical operations ([[algorithm]]), and a computer is used to perform these operations and compute an approximated solution and respective [[approximation error|error]].&lt;ref name=ThijssenBook/&gt;

===Status in physics===
There is a debate about the status of computation within the scientific method.&lt;ref name=ercolessi&gt;[http://www.fisica.uniud.it/~ercolessi/md/md/ A molecular dynamics primer], Furio Ercolessi, [[University of Udine]], Italy. [http://www.fisica.uniud.it/~ercolessi/md/md.pdf Article PDF].&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes it is regarded as more akin to theoretical physics; some others regard computer simulation as "[[computer experiment]]s",&lt;ref name=ercolessi/&gt; yet still others consider it an intermediate or different branch between theoretical and [[experimental physics]], a third way that supplements theory and experiment. While computers can be used in experiments for the measurement and recording (and storage) of data, this clearly does not constitute a computational approach.

==Challenges in computational physics==

Physics problems are in general very difficult to solve exactly. This is due to several (mathematical) reasons: lack of algebraic and/or analytic solubility, [[complexity]], and chaos. 

For example, - even apparently simple problems, such as calculating the [[wavefunction]] of an electron orbiting an atom in a strong [[electric field]] ([[Stark effect]]), may require great effort to formulate a practical algorithm (if one can be found); other cruder or brute-force techniques, such as [[graphical method]]s or [[root finding]], may be required. On the more advanced side, mathematical [[perturbation theory]] is also sometimes used (a working is shown for this particular example [[Perturbation theory#Example of degenerate perturbation theory – Stark effect in resonant rotating wave|here]]).

In addition, the [[computational cost]] and [[computational complexity theory|computational complexity]] for [[many-body problem]]s (and their [[n-body problem|classical counterpart]]s) tend to grow quickly. A macroscopic system typically has a size of the order of &lt;math&gt;10^{23}&lt;/math&gt; constituent particles, so it is somewhat of a problem. Solving quantum mechanical problems is generally of [[EXP|exponential order]] in the size of the system&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feynman|first=Richard P.|date=1982|title=Simulating physics with computers|journal=International Journal of Theoretical Physics|language=en|volume=21|issue=6–7|pages=|doi=10.1007/bf02650179.pdf|issn=0020-7748|doi-broken-date=2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for classical N-body it is of order N-squared.

Finally, many physical systems are inherently nonlinear at best, and at worst [[chaos theory|chaotic]]: this means it can be difficult to ensure any [[numerical error]]s do not grow to the point of rendering the 'solution' useless.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sauer|first=Tim|last2=Grebogi|first2=Celso|last3=Yorke|first3=James A.|date=1997-07-07|title=How Long Do Numerical Chaotic Solutions Remain Valid?|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=79|issue=1|pages=59–62|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.79.59|bibcode=1997PhRvL..79...59S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods and algorithms ==
Because computational physics uses a broad class of problems, it is generally divided amongst the different mathematical problems it numerically solves, or the methods it applies. Between them, one can consider:

* [[Root-finding_algorithm|root finding]] (using e.g. [[Newton's_method|Newton-Raphson method]])
* [[system of linear equations]] (using e.g. [[LU decomposition]])
* [[ordinary differential equation]]s (using e.g. [[Runge–Kutta methods]])
* [[integral|integration]] (using e.g. [[Romberg's_method|Romberg method]] and [[Monte Carlo integration]])
* [[partial differential equation]]s (using e.g. [[finite difference]] method and [[Relaxation_(iterative_method)|relaxation]] method)
* [[matrix eigenvalue problem]] (using e.g. [[Jacobi eigenvalue algorithm]] and [[power iteration]])

All these methods (and several others) are used to calculate physical properties of the modeled systems.

Computational physics also borrows a number of ideas from [[computational chemistry]] - for example, the density functional theory used by computational solid state physicists to calculate properties of solids is basically the same as that used by chemists to calculate the properties of molecules.

Furthermore, computational physics encompasses the [[performance tuning|tuning]] of the [[self-tuning#Examples|software]]/[[:Category:Computer hardware tuning|hardware structure]] to solve the problems (as the problems usually can be very large, in [[high performance computing|processing power need]] or in [[high-throughput computing|memory requests]]).

== Divisions ==

It is possible to find a corresponding computational branch for every major field in physics, for example [[computational mechanics]] and [[computational electrodynamics]]. Computational mechanics consists of [[computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD), computational [[solid mechanics]] and computational [[contact mechanics]]. One subfield at the confluence between CFD and electromagnetic modelling is [[computational magnetohydrodynamics]]. The quantum many-body problem leads naturally to the large and rapidly growing field of [[computational chemistry]].

Computational solid state physics is a very important division of computational physics dealing directly with material science.

A field related to computational condensed matter is computational statistical mechanics, which deals with the simulation of models and theories (such as [[percolation]] and [[spin model]]s) that are difficult to solve otherwise. Computational statistical physics makes heavy use of Monte Carlo-like methods. More broadly, (particularly through the use of [[agent based modeling]] and [[cellular automata]]) it also concerns itself with  (and finds application in, through the use of its techniques) in the social sciences, network theory, and mathematical models for the propagation of disease (most notably, the [[Compartmental models in epidemiology#SIR Model|SIR Model]]) and the [[wildfire modeling|spread of forest fires]].

On the more esoteric side, [[numerical relativity]] is a (relatively) new field interested in finding numeric solutions to the field equations of general (and special) relativity, and [[computational particle physics]] deals with problems motivated by particle physics.

[[Computational astrophysics]] is the application of these techniques and methods to astrophysical problems and phenomena.

[[Computational biophysics]] is a branch of biophysics and computational biology itself, applying methods of computer science and physics to large complex biological problems.

== Applications ==
Due to the broad class of problems computational physics deals, it is an essential component of modern research in different areas of physics, namely: [[accelerator physics]], [[astrophysics]], [[fluid mechanics]] ([[computational fluid dynamics]]), [[lattice field theory]]/[[lattice gauge theory]] (especially [[lattice QCD|lattice quantum chromodynamics]]), [[plasma physics]] (see [[plasma modeling]]), simulating physical systems (using e.g. [[molecular dynamics]]), [[nuclear engineering computer codes]], [[protein structure prediction]], [[weather prediction]], [[solid state physics]], [[soft condensed matter]] physics, hypervelocity impact physics etc.

Computational solid state physics, for example, uses [[density functional theory]] to calculate properties of solids, a method similar to that used by chemists to study molecules.  Other quantities of interest in solid state physics, such as the electronic band structure, magnetic properties and charge densities can be calculated by this and several methods, including the [[Luttinger-Kohn model|Luttinger-Kohn]]/[[k.p method]] and [[ab-initio]] methods.

[[File:Calliostoma tigris.JPG|thumb|''[[Calliostoma tigris]]'']]
[[File:Sea shell (Trinidad &amp; Tobago 2009).jpg|thumb|Shell of ''[[Lobatus gigas]]'', the queen conch]]
'''Conchology''' (from {{lang-grc|[[wikt:κόγχος|κόγχος]]}} ''konkhos'', "cockle") is the study of [[mollusc shell]]s. Conchology is one aspect of [[malacology]], the study of molluscs; however, malacology is the study of molluscs as whole organisms, whereas conchology is confined to the study of their shells. It includes the study of land and freshwater mollusc shells as well as [[seashell]]s and extends to the study of a [[gastropod]]'s [[operculum (gastropod)|operculum]].

Conchology is now sometimes seen as an archaic study, because relying on only one aspect of an organism's [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] can be misleading. However, a shell often gives at least some insight into molluscan [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], and historically the shell was often the only part of exotic species that was available for study. Even in current museum collections it is common for the dry material (shells) to greatly exceed the amount of material that is preserved whole in alcohol.

Conchologists mainly deal with four molluscan orders: the [[gastropod]]s (snails), [[bivalve]]s (clams), [[Polyplacophora]] (chitons) and [[Scaphopoda]] (tusk shells). [[Cephalopod]]s only have small internal shells, with the exception of the [[Nautiloidea]]. Some groups, such as the sea slug [[nudibranch]]s, have lost their shells altogether, while in others it has been replaced by a [[protein]] support structure.

== Shell collecting versus conchology ==
[[File:Seashell vendor.jpeg|thumb|A vendor in [[Tanzania]] with a variety of large [[seashell]]s for sale]]

The terms ''shell collector'' and ''conchologist'' can be regarded as two distinct categories. Not all shell collectors are conchologists; some are primarily concerned with the [[aesthetic]] value of shells instead of their scientific study. It is also true that not all conchologists are shell collectors; this type of research only requires access to private or institutional shell collections. There is some debate in the conchological community, with some people regarding all shell collectors (regardless of motivation) as conchologists.

== History ==
Molluscs have probably been used by [[primate]]s as a food source long before [[human]]s evolved. Shell collecting, the precursor of conchology, probably goes back as far as there have been humans living near beaches.

[[Stone Age]] seashell necklaces have been found, sometimes in areas far from the ocean, indicating that they were traded. Shell [[jewellery]] is found at almost all archaeological sites, including at ancient [[Aztec]] ruins, digs in ancient [[China]], and the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley]].

During the [[Renaissance]] people began taking interest in natural objects of beauty to put in [[Cabinet of curiosities|cabinets of curiosities]]. Because of their attractiveness, variety, durability and ubiquity, shells became a large part of these collections. Towards the end of the 17th century, people began looking at shells with scientific interest. [[Martin Lister]] in 1685–1692 published ''[[Historia Conchyliorum]]'', which was the first comprehensive conchological text, having over 1000 [[Intaglio (printmaking)|engraved plates]].

[[File:Lister Martin conchs 1770.png|thumb|200px|right|A plate from Lister’s book, showing what he calls ''[[buccinis]] shells'']]

[[George Rumpf]], or Rumphius, (1627–1702) published the first mollusc taxonomy. He suggested "single shelled ones" ([[Polyplacophora]], [[limpet]]s, and [[abalone]]), "snails or whelks" ([[Gastropoda]]), and "two-shelled ones" ([[Bivalvia]]). Many of Rumpf's terms were adopted by [[Carl Linnaeus]]. Rumpf continued to do important scientific work after he went blind, working by touch.

The study of [[zoology]], including conchology, was revolutionized by [[Swedish people|Swedish]] [[naturalist]] Carl Linnaeus and his system of [[binomial nomenclature]]. 683 of the 4000 or so animal species he described are now considered to be molluscs, although Linnaeus placed them in several phyla at the time.&lt;ref name="Ref_"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jaxshells.org/|title=Jacksonville Shells – WWW.JAXSHELLS.ORG|work=jaxshells.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The English word "conchology" was coined in the 1770s by the British Sephardi naturalist [[Emanuel Mendez da Costa]], who published [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/46649#page/7/mode/1up/ ''The Elements of Conchology: or, an Introduction to the Knowledge of Shells''] in London in 1776.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/38225/|title=''Oxford English Dictionary'', s.v. conchology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been many prominent conchologists in the past two centuries. The [[Sowerby family]] were famous collectors, dealers, and illustrators. [[John Mawe]] (1764–1829) produced arguably the first conchology guidebook, ''[[The Voyager's Companion or Shell-Collector's Pilot]]'' as well as ''[[The Linnæan System of Conchology]]''. [[Hugh Cuming]] (1791–1865) is famous for his huge collection and numerous discoveries of new species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=British Pioneers in Recent Conchological Science. 1662–1858.|journal=Journal of Conchology|author=J. Cosmo Melville, M.A., F.L.S.|volume=6|date=Jan 1890|pages=190–223|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h-4KAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA190}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Say]] wrote the fundamental work ''[[American Conchology, or Descriptions of the Shells of North America, Illustrated From Coloured Figures From Original Drawings, Executed from Nature]]'' in six volumes (1830–1834).

[[R. Tucker Abbott]] was the most prominent conchologist of the 20th century. He authored dozens of books and was [[museum director]] of the [[Bailey-Matthews Shell Museum]], bringing the world of seashells to the public. His most prominent works are ''[[American Seashells]]'', ''[[Seashells of the World]]'', and ''[[The Kingdom of the Seashell]]''.

Many of the finest collections of seashells are private. [[John DuPont]] and [[Jack Lightbourne]] are known for their extensive collections. John DuPont donated his shell collection to the [[Delaware Museum of Natural History]] in 1984. Emperor [[Hirohito]] of Japan also amassed a huge collection, and was a competent and respected amateur conchologist.

== Museums ==
Many museums worldwide contain very large and scientifically important mollusc collections. However, in most cases these are research collections, behind the scenes of the museum, and thus not readily accessible to the general public in the same way that exhibits are.

The largest assemblage of mollusc shells is housed at the [[Smithsonian Institution]] which has millions of lots representing perhaps 50,000 species, versus about 35,000 species for the largest private collections.

The '''conservation and restoration of wooden furniture''' is an activity dedicated to the preservation and protection of wooden furniture objects of historical and personal value. When applied to [[cultural heritage]] this activity is generally undertaken by a [[conservator-restorer]].  Furniture conservation and restoration can be divided into two general areas: structure and finish. Structure generally relates to wood and can be divided into solid, joined, and veneered wood. The finish of furniture can be painted or transparent.&lt;ref&gt;Podmaniczky, Michael S. (2000) Furniture. In ''The Winterthur Guide to Caring for Your Collections,'' (Pg. 125). London, University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Furniture]] has existed throughout all the years of human existence. Furniture that is very dated or is an [[antique]] can be conserved or restored so that future generations may also enjoy them for cultural, educational and personal benefit. There are many organizations and guidebooks that can be used to understand the techniques that are used to conserve and restore furniture.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.conservation-us.org/membership/find-a-conservator#.VTkUSiFViko "Guide to Finding a Conservator" American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works, accessed 4/23/2015 [http://www.conservation-us.org/membership/find-a-conservator]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation==

The conservation of furniture is the synthesis of three major endeavors, according to the [http://www.si.edu/mci/english/professional_development/past_courses_programs/programs/FCTP.html Smithsonian Museum Conservation Institute]:
# The minimization of deterioration (preservation);
#The consolidation (stabilization) of artifacts as they currently exist;
#Repair/replacement (compensation or restoration) of existing damage.

[[File:American sideboard, late 18th century, Honolulu Museum of Art, 3407.1.JPG|thumb|American sideboard, late 18th century, Honolulu Museum of Art, 3407.1]]
Preventive conservation is the form of conservation recognized here with furniture care. [http://www.conservation-us.org/docs/default-source/public-relations/furniture.pdf?sfvrsn=2 The American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works] declares that stripping and refinishing furniture is no longer standard practice. An early finish is as important to historic furniture as are any of the other original elements. The finish coating offers important data to researchers and is part of the history of the object and once it is removed, it cannot be recovered.  The removal and replacement of a surface finish is considered a last ditch effort after other conservation methods have failed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.conservation-us.org/docs/default-source/public-relations/furniture.pdf?sfvrsn=2 "Caring for Your Treasures" American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works. accessed 4/28/2015 [http://www.conservation-us.org/docs/default-source/public-relations/furniture.pdf?sfvrsn=2]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Institut national du patrimoine ===
In France, conservators specialized in furniture are trained at the [[Institut national du patrimoine|Institut National du Patrimoine]] (The National Institute of Cultural Heritage). Their mission is to intervene when heritage resources are threatened or deteriorated for several reasons. The conservator prevents works of art from disappearing or loses its purpose whilst analyzing the complex stage of its material history and the cause of alteration. 

==Restoration==
[[Antiques restoration]] can be an arduous process if the goal is total and complete authenticity. For conservators, authentic material is the actual original material of the object. For example: A chair with its original [[upholstery]], even if it is faded and shredded, is authentic for the conservator and possesses historic value even though it may not be exhibitable. The same chair can be "restored" and looking as it did when new, with replacement fabric copied from the original weave and colors, and upholstered according to the known design of that particular piece of furniture; this would represent the other kind of authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;Appelbaum, Barbara. (2010) ''Conservation Treatment Methodology'' (Pg. 97).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Original material==
Furniture can be divided into periods dominated by the use of a particular wood.&lt;ref&gt;Capadose, Jeremy. (2011) Furniture. In ''The National Trust Manual of Housekeeping: Care and conservation of collections in historic houses'' (Pg. 363). Swindon, Wiltshire. National Trust Books.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Until the late 17th Century [[oak]] was dominant.
*From the mid-17th Century, [[walnut]] gradually became the main wood for the outside and drawer sides in the best quality pieces with oak still used for the underlying part.
*In the second quarter of the 18th Century the first [[mahogany]] was imported from the [[West Indies]] and eventually replaced walnut.
*By the 1790s, [[satinwood]] was popular as a decorative exotic timber for top quality pieces.
*During the [[Regency]] period [[rosewood]] was predominant.
*'''But since then no one species has dominated.'''

Furniture can consist of many different, and extra, components:&lt;ref&gt;Appelbaum, Barbara. (2010) ''Conservation Treatment Methodology,''(Pg. 257).&lt;/ref&gt;
*Original adhesives
*Upholstery fabric
*Webbing and stuffing
*Casters
*Labels
*Accretions and stains from original use and from later periods
*Old dust in crevices
*Repair hardware and adhesives
*Objects left in drawers or cupboards
*Whole replacement parts
*Carcase (The main structural elements making up the body of a piece of furniture)

== Upholstered furniture ==

Dusting upholstered furniture can be achieved by placing a soft screen on the surface and using a brush attachment on a [[HEPA]] vacuum with gentle suction.&lt;ref&gt;https://sustainingplaces.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/smithsonianmcifurniturecare.pdf Smithsonian ''Museum Conservation Institute,'' "Furniture Care and Handling" Page 12. accessed 4/23/2015 [https://sustainingplaces.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/smithsonianmcifurniturecare.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; For further cleaning of upholstered furniture, such as stains, this may most likely require a textile conservator, in addition to a conservator with knowledge of wooden furniture.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.winterthur.org/?p=457 "Furniture Conservation" Winterthur Museum, Garden and Library. accessed 4/23/2015 [http://www.winterthur.org/?p=457]&lt;/ref&gt;

When a conservator-restorer is working on upholstered furniture it is important for them to consider innovative approaches to reversibility, the maximum preservation of information, and the use of chemically stable materials. Treatments can produce objects that ''appear'' indistinguishable from furniture upholstered in traditional ways, but the actual means of attachment does not include any nails or staples that pierce wood. [[Velcro]] makes it possible to examine the carcass of the furniture without undoing any part of the treatment. When furniture is treated using these techniques, stuffing is typically replaced by [[Ethafoam]] carved to the appropriate shape. The resulting object has a seat that looks like the original one, but is not "sittable."&lt;ref&gt;Appelbaum, Barbara. (2010) ''Conservation Treatment Methodology,'' (pg. 360–361).&lt;/ref&gt;

American furniture from the mid-nineteenth century probably received new upholstery about every thirty years. Sometimes new fabric was placed on top of the old, and at other times worn upholstery was entirely removed before the new covering was applied. Conservator-restorers can sometimes find threads of original fiber evidence on the chair frame, usually around tack holes. This can guide them to the creation of a reproduction of the original upholstery if an original fabric is not available.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Richard. (2009) ''Conservation: MFA Highlights.'' (pg. 50–53) United States: Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marie Antoinette's chair===
The [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] has a '''case study''' on their [http://www.vam.ac.uk/blog/conservation-blog/the-conservation-of-marie-antoinettes-chair website] on the description of the conservation treatment that was carried out on [[Marie Antoinette]]'s chair in preparation for its display in the new Europe galleries due to open later in 2015. The chair was made in 1788 by Jean-Baptiste-Claude Sené (1748–1803). The chair has been re-upholstered several times, re-gilded and over-painted. The last intervention was in the 1970s when it was upholstered in blue swagged fabric and partially painted a greyish blue.

==Varnish==
A [[Chemical synthesis|synthetic]] [[varnish]], [[cellulose nitrate]], was developed in the 1850s but was not available in a formulation suitable for commercial furniture until the late 1920s. Unfortunately, cellulose nitrate discolors and becomes brittle as it ages, so over time, the coating on furniture can turn yellow and opaque. It can also crisscross in some places by a fine network of cracks or the varnish can fall off completely. The early date and rarity of this original coating makes it important to retain the varnish on furniture despite these problems.

In a '''case study''' of an armoire with this condition from the 1930s from [http://www.mfa.org/ The Museum of Fine Arts] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]:
"Conservators used a more stable synthetic [[resin]], a type of acrylic copolymer dissolved in a solvent, to consolidate weakened areas of the original varnish without significantly changing the glossiness of its finish or its color. To provide a consistent overall finish, they tinted a portion of that solution the same color as the aged cellulose nitrate to fill some of the more jarring losses. In the future, the new varnish will not be easy to remove, if it can be removed at all, but the synthetic resin used by the conservators is known to have good aging properties." &lt;ref&gt;Newman, Richard. (2009) ''Conservation: MFA Highlights.''(Pg. 76) United States: Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conditions==
[[File:Braunfaeule Holz FI20070208.jpg|thumb|Dry Rot]]
The following is a list of '''Wood Terms''' to describe conditions, as suggested by ''MRM5: Museum Registration Methods 5th Edition:''&lt;ref&gt;Demeroukas, Marie. Buck, edited by Rebecca A.; Gilmore, Jean Allman (2010). MRM5 : museum registration methods (5th ed. ed.). Washington, DC: AAM Press, American Association of Museums. (pgs. 229–230). {{ISBN|978-1-933253-15-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alligatoring:''' Series of hairline cracks in old varnish, creating the appearance of [[alligator]] hide.

'''Checking:''' Slight gapping between wood cells that creates a [[checkerboard]]-like pattern. Found where wood is cut straight across the grain for carving, such as in a ball-and-claw foot.

'''Dry rot:''' Decay of seasoned timber caused by fungi that consume the [[cellulose]] of wood, leaving a soft skeleton that is readily reduced to powder.

'''Shrinkage:''' A loss of mass or size in response to dry relative humidity conditions.

== Preventable damage ==
Preventive conservation is the best form of conservation that you can do for furniture without a scientific conservation degree.

===The impact of the environment===
A poorly controlled environment can cause detached veneer, cracks, and flaking paint.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.winterthur.org/?p=457 "Preventive Conservation" Winterthur Museum, Garden and Library. accessed 4/23/2015 [http://www.winterthur.org/?p=457]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Light====
Light easily causes color fading. Light is a major concern for furniture because the stains and color of wood are very susceptible to both natural and artificial light.&lt;ref&gt;Podmaniczky, Michael S. (2000) Furniture. In ''The Winterthur Guide to Caring for Your Collections,'' (pg. 131). London, University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Temperature and relative humidity ====
To prevent cracks and veneer cleavage, avoid placing furniture near radiators, heat vents or other areas where temperature and [[relative humidity]] (RH) fluctuate widely. A stable relative humidity is particularly important to furniture since rapid changes cause different parts of the object to expand and contract at different rates and to different degrees.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.winterthur.org/?p=457 "Furniture and Wooden Objects" Winterthur Museum, Garden and Library. accessed 4/23/2015 [http://www.winterthur.org/?p=295]&lt;/ref&gt; If the relative humidity is over 60% [[fungi]], such as molds and mildews, will become rampant on wooden furniture.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.si.edu/mci/english/learn_more/taking_care/biodetwood.html  "Biological Deterioration &amp; Damage to Furniture &amp; Wooden Objects" Smithsonian ''Museum Conservation Institute'' accessed 4/23/2015 [http://www.si.edu/mci/english/learn_more/taking_care/biodetwood.html]&lt;/ref&gt; '''The recommended range for wooden furniture is 45%–55% RH.'''&lt;ref&gt;Klim, Susan. (1992). Furniture Conservation. In ''Conservation Concerns: A Guide for Collectors and Curators,''(Pg.106). Washington, DC: Smithsonian Institution Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Impacts of change in RH on wooden furniture:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/resources-ressources/objectscollectionsobjets/furniture-meubles/449-eng.aspx CCI-ICC, "How to Care for Wooden Furniture," 4/1/2002. accessed 4/23/2015 [http://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/resources-ressources/objectscollectionsobjets/furniture-meubles/449-eng.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Low RH''
*Wood shrinks and splits
*Joints become loose and the elements no longer fir together tightly
*Veneers and inlays suffer – If the underlying carcase wood shrinks, cracks will appear in the veneer and inlays become loose
*When the glues holding them down fail, veneers lift
*Causes polishes to shrink, craze and flake

''High RH''
*Swelling can cause moving parts such as cabinet doors or drawers to jam
*If glue fails, veneer peels away
*[[Corrosion]] affects nails holding things in place, metal inlay and fillings
*Insects and rot may flourish as the content of the wood rises

Fast and constant cycling of RH fluctuations causes the most damage for all of the above to create rapid structural weakening.

====Pests====
[[File:Lyctoxylon dentatum.jpg|thumb|Powderpost Beetle]]
A common furniture pest is the [[powderpost beetle]], less than a quarter-inch long, which lays its eggs in small crevices. The insect larvae burrow into the wood, creating networks of tunnels as they eat their way along the grain. As they mature to adults, they bore out of the wood leaving an “exit” or “flight” hole and fly off to lay their eggs, completing the cycle.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.conservation-us.org/about-conservation/caring-for-your-treasures/furniture#.VTkbESFVikp  "Insect Activity," American Institute for Conservation  of Historic and Artistic Works, accessed 4/23/2015 [http://www.conservation-us.org/about-conservation/caring-for-your-treasures/furniture#.VTJgzSHBzGc]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Photo to the right—''

Here is another '''case study''' of an early 19th-century bed with an infestation of woodworms from The Museum of Fine Arts in Boston:

"To protect the bed from damage and prevent pests from spreading to other works of art, it was critical to treat the new acquisition before it entered the building. Conservators completely sealed the bed in a giant impermeable bag and placed an oxygen scavenger inside. In this case, the scavenger was made of fine iron particles. Iron reacts rapidly with oxygen, binding the gas itself and thereby removing it from the air. With the appropriate amount of scavenger in the sealed environment, the conservators brought the oxygen down from normal air levels of 20 percent to less than 0.1 percent. After about four weeks in containment, all of the bed's woodworms in all life stages suffocated. Then the object could be safely brought into the Museum. No toxic chemicals were involved in the treatment, and the conservators disposed of the spent scavenger safely."&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Richard. (2009) ''Conservation: MFA Highlights.''(Pg. 132) United States: Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Handling and moving furniture====
Perhaps the greatest cause of damage to furniture is people due to misuse and mishandling, creating physical damage.&lt;ref&gt;Capadose, Jeremy. (2011) Furniture. In ''The National Trust Manual of Housekeeping: Care and conservation of collections in historic houses'' (Pg. 365). Swindon, Wiltshire. National Trust Books.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Always'' wear clean cotton gloves and handle objects as little as possible. Check furniture for damage or loose joins before moving it. Remove objects from the surface and then remove drawers, shelves, and doors. Elements that cannot be removed should be secured with soft cloth (cotton) straps.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/resources-ressources/objectscollectionsobjets/furniture-meubles/449-eng.aspx CCI-ICC, "How to Care for Wooden Furniture," 4/1/2002. accessed 4/23/2015 [http://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/resources-ressources/objectscollectionsobjets/furniture-meubles/449-eng.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as structural damage, dents, surface wear, scratches, stains and wax from candles are all evidence of past use. Water splashed from repeated floor washing, or spilt from flower displays damages bare or polished surfaces, most commonly leaving white marks. Cups and glasses leave 'rings' on polished surfaces. Alcohol spilt will remove the polished surface almost instantly.&lt;ref&gt;Capadose, Jeremy. (2011) Furniture. In ''The National Trust Manual of Housekeeping: Care and conservation of collections in historic houses'' (Pg. 365). Swindon, Wiltshire. National Trust Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Furniture maintenance==
For the most part, maintaining furniture simply means keeping it clean, carefully.&lt;ref&gt;https://sustainingplaces.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/smithsonianmcifurniturecare.pdf Smithsonian ''Museum Conservation Institute,'' "Furniture Care and Handling" Page 10. accessed 4/23/2015 [https://sustainingplaces.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/smithsonianmcifurniturecare.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cleaning===
Furniture oils are not recommended for maintenance as many of them contain linseed oil or other drying oils, and when used repeatedly will create a gummy, insoluble surface coating that darkens and obscures the grain of the wood. Other furniture polishes contain non-drying oils such as lemon oil, but attract and entrap dirt and grime. Silicone polishes are also not recommended as they leave a film that is difficult to remove and can interfere with future finish treatments.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.conservation-us.org/about-conservation/caring-for-your-treasures/furniture#.VTkbESFVikp "Caring for Your Treasures," American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works, accessed 4/23/2015 [http://www.conservation-us.org/about-conservation/caring-for-your-treasures/furniture#.VTJgzSHBzGc]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tools for furniture care===
The Hammond-Harwood House and City of Bowie Museums Collector’s Corner Workshop Series provides a resource on Furniture Cleaning and Care which addresses the tools and techniques of furniture cleaning.&lt;ref&gt;https://sustainingplaces.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/furniture-cleaning-and-care-handout.pdf Hammond-Harwood House, City of Bowie Museums. "Furniture Cleaning and Care," Pages 1-2, accessed 4/23/2015 [https://sustainingplaces.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/furniture-cleaning-and-care-handout.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Petroleum-free nitrile gloves
*Cotton cloths
*Synthetic cloths, “Pel cloth” and “Preserve-It” 
*Brushes, “Hake” or “Windsor-Newton” brushes
*Distilled water
*Liquefied hide glue, “Titebond Liquid Hide Glue,” “Old Brown Glue”
*Cotton swab, balls, or wool
*Brush cleaner, “The Master’s”
*Paste or butchers wax, “Butchers,” “Johnson,” “Goddard’s,” and “Trewax,”

[https://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/index-eng.aspx The Canadian Conservation Institute] recommends that Micro-crystalline wax (a scent- and colour-free white paste wax that is available at specialty tool supply stores) can be used to increase the gloss of the finish, which will make it easier to remove fingerprints. Do this only once a year and only to the surfaces that are handled, being careful to avoid wax build-up around metal fittings.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/resources-ressources/objectscollectionsobjets/furniture-meubles/449-eng.aspx CCI-ICC, "How to Care for Wooden Furniture," 4/1/2002. accessed 4/23/2015 [http://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/resources-ressources/objectscollectionsobjets/furniture-meubles/449-eng.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
The [http://www.si.edu/mci/english/professional_development/past_courses_programs/programs/FCTP.html Smithsonian Museum Conservation Institute] has a graduate-level course of study Furniture Conservation Training Program that was established in 1986.

[[Winterthur Museum, Garden and Library]] sponsors two graduate programs with The [http://www.artcons.udel.edu/ University of Delaware]. The [http://www.winterthur.org/?p=634 Winterthur] program in American Material Culture, founded in 1952, and the Winterthur-University of Delaware Program in Art Conservation founded in 1974.

==History==
''De fato'' is part of the second group of Cicero's writings.&lt;ref name='Sharples'&gt;R. W. Sharples. ''Cicero: On Fate (De fato) &amp; Boethius: The Consolation of Philosophy IV.5-7, V (Philosophiae Consolationis). Aris &amp; Phillips Ltd, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Introduction, 3&lt;/ref&gt; The work was composed at Pozzuoli between April 17th and May 23rd of 44 BC.&lt;ref name='Sharples'&gt;R. W. Sharples. ''Cicero: On Fate (De fato) &amp; Boethius: The Consolation of Philosophy IV.5-7, V (Philosophiae Consolationis). Aris &amp; Phillips Ltd, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Introduction, 5&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, the work would have most likely been completed prior to Cicero's abortive departure for Greece in July of that year.&lt;ref name='Sharples'&gt;R. W. Sharples. ''Cicero: On Fate (De fato) &amp; Boethius: The Consolation of Philosophy IV.5-7, V (Philosophiae Consolationis). Aris &amp; Phillips Ltd, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Introduction, 5&lt;/ref&gt; The work was written in haste, as Cicero was planning to return to the political arena.&lt;ref name='Sharples'&gt;R. W. Sharples. ''Cicero: On Fate (De fato) &amp; Boethius: The Consolation of Philosophy IV.5-7, V (Philosophiae Consolationis). Aris &amp; Phillips Ltd, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Preface, iv&lt;/ref&gt;

==Argumentation==
Hirtius notes that Cicero has adopted the [[Platonic Academy|Academic method]] of investigation: arguing against all propositions.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De fato.'' II.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, he outlines the positions of [[Democritus]], [[Heraclitus]], [[Empedocles]], and [[Aristotle]] as those who maintained that everything happens by necessity. As such Cicero develops the propositions of [[Hard determinism|fate and necessity]] as follows:

{{quote|"If all things happen by fate, all things happen with an antecedent cause; and if this is true of desire, it is true also of what follows desire, and therefore true of assent. But if the cause of desire is not within us, desire itself is not in our power; and if this is so, then those things which are brought about by desire are not within us. Therefore neither assent nor action is in our power; and  from this it follows that neither praise nor blame are just, nor honours nor punishment"&lt;ref name='Huby'&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/4181841 Huby, Pamela M. ''An Epicurean Argument in Cicero, "De Fato" XVII-40.''Phronesis 15.1, pp. 83-85. BRILL, 1970. Web.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Cicero essentially dismisses this proposition as [[reductio ad absurdum|antithetical]] to what is observed, but postulates freedom as a necessity for moral life.&lt;ref name='Henry'/&gt; Ultimately, Cicero maintains this position as he is emotionally convinced that it is in man's power to achieve virtue for himself; if determinism were the order of things, then such ability would not be true.&lt;ref name='Henry'/&gt;

'''Equilibrium partitioning Sediment Benchmarks (ESBs)''' are a type of [[Aquatic toxicology#Significance to regulatory world|Sediment Quality Guideline (SQG)]] derived by the USEPA for the protection of [[benthic]] organisms. ESBs are based on the [[bioavailable]] concentration of [[contaminants]] in [[sediment]]s rather than the dry-weight concentration. It has been demonstrated that sediment concentrations on a dry-weight basis often do not predict biological effects.&lt;ref name="USEPA ESB"&gt;United States Environmental Protection Agency. 2003. Technical basis for the derivation of equilibrium partitioning sediment benchmarks (ESBs) for the protection of benthic organisms: [[Nonionic]] organics. EPA-600-R-02-014. Office of Research and Development. Washington, DC. (draft)&lt;/ref&gt; Interstitial water concentrations, however, predict biological effects much better. This is true because the chemical present in the interstitial water (or pore water) is the uncomplexed/free phase of the chemical that is bioavailable and [[toxic]] to benthic organisms. Other phases of the chemical are bound to sediment particles like [[organic carbon]] (OC) or [[acid volatile sulfides]] (AVS) and are not bioavailable. Thus the interstitial water concentration is important to consider for effects to benthic organisms.

Equilibrium partitioning (EqP) predicts the bioavailable concentration of a chemical under given sediment conditions by using partition coefficients. The bioavailable concentration in [[interstitial fluid|interstitial]] water can then be compared to an established water-based effect concentration and used to predict the likelihood of adverse effects. When a chemical exceeds the ESB, an adverse biological effect may occur, and when concentrations are below or equal to an ESB, biological effects are unlikely to occur.

The USEPA's Office of Research and Development (ORD) has published ESBs for approximately 65 pollutants or classes of pollutants including 34 [[Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon|PAHs]],&lt;ref name="PAHs"&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 2003.

Office of Research and Development, Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory ==
[[Partition equilibrium|Equilibrium partitioning theory (EqP)]] forms the basis for ESBs developed to account for bioavailability of contaminants in sediments. The concentration of interstitial water reflects the chemical's activity and is a surrogate for bioavailability.&lt;ref name="DiToro"&gt;Di Toro DM, Zarba CS, Hansen DJ, Berry WJ, Swartz RC, Cowan CE, Pavlou SP, Allen HE, Thomas NA, Paquin PR. 1991. Technical basis for the equilibrium partitioning method for establishing sediment quality criteria. Environ Toxicol Chem 11:1541–1583.&lt;/ref&gt; EqP theory holds that a non-ionic chemical in sediment partitions between sediment OC, interstitial water and benthic organisms. For cationic metals, the chemical also partitions onto sediment AVS, as well as sedimentary OC. At equilibrium, if the partition coefficients are known along with the concentration in any one of the phases, then the concentrations of the other phases can be predicted.

Using EqP theory, the bioavailable concentration of chemicals is predicted and then related to an established toxic effect concentration such as the final chronic value (FCV), which is used to derive water quality criteria (WQC) in the US.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan CE, Mount DI, Hansen DJ, Gentile GH, Chapman GA, Brungs WA. 1985. Guidelines for deriving numerical national water quality criteria for the protection of aquatic organisms and their uses. PB85– 227049. Technical Report. National Technical Information Service, Springfield, VA, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; Other values besides the FCV may also be used when an FCV is not available. Using water-based effects concentration when predicting toxic effects in benthos has been supported by studies showing similar effects occur in pelagic and benthic organisms.&lt;ref name="DiToro"/&gt;

=== Nonionic organic chemicals ===

Experiments have demonstrated that toxicological effects of benthic organisms are not only correlated to interstitial water concentrations, but also to sediment concentrations when expressed on a microgram chemical/gram OC basis.&lt;ref name="USEPA ESB"/&gt; This is because hydrophobic chemicals like PAHs tend to be bound to OC in sediment. The OC-normalized concentration of sediment concentrations is easily calculated by measuring total OC in sediments synoptically with dry weight concentrations. Thus, the freely dissolved interstitial water concentration of nonionic organic chemicals can be predicted using the K&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;, the organic carbon-water partition coefficient, which is a constant for each chemical:

K&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt; = C&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt;

For nonionic organic contaminants, the K&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt; can be determined based on the octanol-water partition coefficient (K&lt;sub&gt;OW&lt;/sub&gt;). C&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt; is the organic carbon normalized sediment concentration (micrograms per kilogram OC) and C&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt; is the dissolved interstitial water concentration (milligrams per liter).

The equation above can be rearranged to:

C&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt; = K&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt;.

Using 1/1000 to convert C&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt; in kilograms OC to grams OC and substituting a known water effects concentrations (e.g. FCV), the ESB (micrograms per gram OC) is calculated as:

ESB = K&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;FCV(1/1000)

The calculated ESB is site-specific.

=== Cationic metals ===

The equation for the bioavailable concentration for cationic metals including cadmium, copper, nickel, lead, silver and zinc that incorporates the AVS phase is as follows:

C&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt; = (SEM-AVS) / (ƒ&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;K&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;)

SEM = simultaneously extract metals

== Government Agency Use ==

=== USEPA ===

The USEPA's Office of Research and Development (ORD) has published ESBs for approximately 65 pollutants or classes of pollutants. Five documents describing the derivation of 34 [[Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon|PAHs]],&lt;ref name="PAHs"/&gt; nonionic organics,&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 2012. Equilibrium Partitioning Sediment Benchmarks (ESBs) for the Protection of Benthic Organisms: Procedures for the Determination of the Freely Dissolved Interstitial Water Concentrations of Nonionic Organics. EPA 600/R-02/012. Technical Report, Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt; metal mixtures (e.g., cadmium, chromium, copper, nickel, lead, silver, and zinc),&lt;ref name="Metals"/&gt; and pesticides [[dieldrin]]&lt;ref name="Dieldrin"/&gt; and [[endrin]]&lt;ref name="Endrin"/&gt; are available on the USEPA's SQG Technical Resources website.&lt;ref&gt;USEPA. (2012, July 21). Technical Resources-Guidelines. Water: Contaminated Sediments. Retrieved May 29, 2015, from http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/sediments/cs/guidelines.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; The USEPA recommends using the ESB approach for the above-mentioned classes of chemicals as well as other nonionic chemicals with hydrophobic chemicals with logK&lt;sub&gt;OW&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 2.00 and sediments containing TOC ≥ 0.2% dry weight (ƒ&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.002). The USEPA provides technical guidance for their use, however there are no legally binding requirements.

== Application ==
The purpose of SQGs are to provide a relatively inexpensive line of evidence (a chemical concentration) to predict adverse toxicological effects. Ideally they are used in conjunction with biological and toxicity assessments to provide an overall estimation of risk from contaminated sediments.

ESBs have been applied to Manufactured Gas Plant Sites where PAHs are a chemical of concern. The ESB approach is based on the additivity of ESBs for the 34 PAHs. Because many historical studies and current studies do not analyze for 34 PAHs, uncertainty factors are employed to calculated ESB for total 34 PAHs.&lt;ref name="PAHs"/&gt; However, it is recommended that all 34 PAHs be analyzed for best results. The site-specific ESB can then be used to determine which sediments should be remediated, and if further toxicity testing should be employed. As mentioned before, it is best to use ESBs as one line of evidence in conjunction with other studies.

== Comparison to other SQGs ==
ESBs are just one of multiple SQGs that have been developed for assessment of contaminated sediments. ESBs are different from other SQGs because they are mechanistically derived using chemical and physical properties. Other SQGs have been derived empirically using databases of synoptically collected sediment chemistry and biological effects. Other SQGs include the apparent effects threshold (AET),&lt;ref&gt;Barrick R, Becker S, Brown L, Beller H, Pastorok R. 1988. ''Sediment Quality Values Refinement: 1988 Update and Evaluation of Puget Sound AET'' Vol 1. PTI Environmental Services, Bellevue, WA, USA. https://fortress.wa.gov/ecy/publications/summarypages/0609094.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Effects range low and effects range median|effects range low/effects range median (ERL/ERM)]],&lt;ref&gt;Long E.R., L.G. Morgan. The Potential for Biological Effects of Sediment-Sorbed Contaminants Tested in the National Status and Trends Program. NOAA Technical Memorandum NOS OMA 52. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Seattle, Washington. 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; threshold effects level/probable effect level (TEL/PEL),&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald DD, Ingersoll CG, Berger T. 2000. Development and evaluation of consensus-based sediment quality guidelines for freshwater ecosystems. Arch Environ Contam Toxicol 39:20–31.&lt;/ref&gt; and a  logistical model.&lt;ref&gt;Field LJ, MacDonald D, Norton SB, Severn CG, Ingersoll CG. 1999. Evaluating sediment chemistry and toxicity data using logistic regression modeling. Environ Toxicol Chem 18:1311–1322.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations ==
ESBs do not predict [[bioaccumulation]] or [[trophic transfer]] to wildlife and humans, which are important considerations in ecological [[risk assessment]]. Bioaccumulative chemicals like [[polychlorinated biphenyl]]s (PCBs) and [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] often affect upper trophic level organisms more seriously than benthic organisms. ESBs, however, are specifically designed for the protection of benthic organisms. As a consequence, the broader ecological risks of bioaccumulative chemicals are not accounted for in the ESB approach.

A second limitation is that the ESB approach assumes that nonionic organic contaminants are associated with the organic carbon portion of the sediment. Recent studies have shown that some organic contaminants are associated with another form of carbon called "black carbon".&lt;ref&gt;Gustafsson O, Haghseta F, Chan C, MacFarlane J, Gschwend PM. 1997. Quantification of the dilute sedimentary soot phase: Implications for PAH speciation and bioavailability. Environ Sci Technol 31:203–209.&lt;/ref&gt; If black carbon constitutes a large fraction of sediment and is not accounted for because only TOC measurements are in the ESB calculation, then ESBs may be overprotective.

A final limitations is that ESBs do not always consider the antagonistic, additive or synergistic effects of sediment contaminants. For the specific cases of metal mixtures and individual PAHs, ESBs do take into account additive effects.

'''Forensic astronomy''' is the use of [[astronomy]], the scientific study of celestial objects, to determine the appearance of the sky at specific times in the past. This has been used, if relatively rarely, in [[forensic science]] (that is, for solving problems of relevance to the legal system) and for resolving [[history|historical]] problems more generally, notably issues in [[art history]].

==Forensic science==
As a forensic science in the strict sense of the term, astronomical knowledge can help resolve certain legal questions. In one reported instance, an astronomer testified in court as an [[expert witness]] as to whether a newly built house would cast a shadow on another house. More generally, questions about the sun's or moon's placement in the sky at certain times of day or night may be legally relevant, such as for determining the date on which a  photograph was made.&lt;ref name="Marché"&gt;{{cite book|last=Marché|first=Jordan D.|title=Theaters of time and space: American planetaria, 1930-1970|year=2005|publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]]|isbn=978-0-8135-3576-0|pages=177|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=olT1ipj-EboC&amp;pg=PA177}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has for instance been reported that [[Abraham Lincoln]] once successfully defended a legal case by describing the location of the Moon on the night of the offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pistalu|first=Mary Ellen|title=Astronomy Takes the Stand: Using the Heavens to Solve Crimes|journal=[[Mercury Magazine]]|issue=January/February 2006|publisher=[[Astronomical Society of the Pacific]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Frederic Church Meteor of 1860.jpg|thumb|[[Frederic Edwin Church]], ''[[The Meteor of 1860]]'']]

By extension, the adjective "forensic" has come to be used for any detailed analysis of past events, whether related to legal questions or not, and so the determination of past celestial constellations more generally is now increasingly referred to as "forensic astronomy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gunn|first=Alan|title=Essential Forensic Biology|year=2009|publisher=[[John Wiley and Sons]]|isbn=978-0-470-75803-8|pages=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eesJuyXhKHoC&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For research in [[art history]], in particular, methods of astronomy are sometimes useful for determining the place and time of creation of a particular work of art, or of the event that inspired it. Such methods have for instance been used to date [[Vincent van Gogh]]'s painting ''[[Evening Landscape with Rising Moon]]'' (to 9:08 pm, 13 July 1889), and to identify the [[meteor]]s described in [[Walt Whitman]]'s poem ''[[Year of Meteors (1859-60)]]'' – in conjunction with [[Frederic Edwin Church]]'s painting of the same event (at right) – as the [[meteor procession]] of [[1860 Great Meteor|1860]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Falk|first=Dan|title=Forensic astronomer solves Walt Whitman mystery|url=https://www.newscientist.com/blogs/culturelab/2010/06/the-forensic-astronomer-donald-olson.php|accessdate=2 June 2010|newspaper=[[New Scientist]] CultureLab|date=1 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2387">'''Forensic metrology''' is [[metrology]], the science of measurement, as it applies to [[forensic science]]s. Forensic [[Laboratory|laboratories]] and [[Criminalistics|criminalistic]] laboratories perform numerous measurements and tests to support both [[Criminal prosecution|criminal]] and [[Civil lawsuit|civil legal actions]].  Examples of forensic metrology include the measurement of blood or breath [[alcohol content]], the quantification of [[controlled substance]]s (both net weights and purity), and length measurements of [[Gun barrel|firearm barrels]].  The results of forensic measurements are used to determine if a person is charged with a crime or may be used to determine a statutory sentencing enhancement.  Other examples of forensic metrology includes tests that measure if there is a presence of a substance (e.g., cocaine), latent print examination, [[questioned document examination|questioned documents examination]], and [[DNA analysis]].

Forensic measurements are all supported by reference standards which are traceable to the [[International System of Units]] (SI) maintained by the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]], to natural constants, or to reference materials such as those provided by the United States' national metrology institute known as the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] in [[Gaithersburg, Maryland]].

Examples of instruments and equipment used in forensic metrology include [[breathalyzer]]s, balances &amp; [[Weighing scale|scales]], [[ruler]]s, [[caliper]]s, [[Gas chromotographer]]s, and [[centrifuge]]s.

Recent attention has been given to forensic metrology and metrological traceability as a result of an international effort to accredit forensic laboratories and criminalistic laboratories to the [[International Organization for Standardization]] [[ISO 17025|17025]] requirements.

The '''French Institute of Petroleum''' (in [[French (language)|French]]: '''''Institut français du pétrole, IFP''''') is a public research organisation in [[France]] founded in 1944&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=French Institute of Petroleum (IFP)|url=http://www.zeroco2.no/projects/developers/french-institute-of-petroleum|journal=http://www.zeroco2.no}}&lt;/ref&gt; as '''Institute of Oil, Fuels and Lubricants''' (''Institut du pétrole, des carburants et des lubrifiants'').

The Institute is based at [[Rueil-Malmaison]] near [[Paris]], and has sites near [[Lyon]] and at [[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]].  {{As of|2004}}, it had 1729 employees, a budget of 253 million euros, and was responsible for a post-graduate training centre, [[IFP School]] (also known as the '''''École du pétrole et des moteurs'''''), and an extensive industrial training programme, IFP Training.

IFP has designed several methods to assess the oil potential of a sedimentary rock, amongst others, the Rock-Eval technique using a standardized [[pyrolysis]] apparatus. This technique is used worldwide amongst petroleum companies to compare their results in the same way.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3891">[[File:Hamburger Druckschrift ab 2011.jpg|thumb|Hamburg's block letters]]

'''Grundschrift''' (''base [[font]]'', literally ''ground script'') is a simplified form of [[handwriting]] adopted by [[Hamburg]] schools, and it is currently endorsed by the German National Primary Schoolteachers' Union.&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian - [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/29/germany-teachers-handwriting-schools-schreibschrift German teachers campaign to simplify handwriting in schools]&lt;/ref&gt;

If nationally adopted, it would replace the three different German [[cursive]]s currently being taught in schools: the [[:de:Lateinische Ausgangsschrift|Lateinische Ausgangsschrift]] (introduced in 1953), the [[:de:Schulausgangsschrift|Schulausgangsschrift]] (1968), and the [[:de:Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift|Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift]] (1969), providing a standardized system of handwriting in German school systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://grundschrift-schreibschrift.de Grundschrift - Schreibschrift: Verlust oder Gewinn?]&lt;/ref&gt;

Grundschrift letters are written separately as [[block letters]] as opposed to cursive script, in which letters are conjoined together in a flowing motion.

== Reception ==
One of the most important critics of the Grundschrift is Ute Andresen. The former president of the German Society for Reading and Writing (1999 to 2002) argues that "children can not teach themselves to write."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/reform-der-lehrplaene-die-schreibschrift-stirbt-aus-12932933.html - Schreibschrift stirbt aus]&lt;/ref&gt;  The introduction of the basic inscription would mean abolishing cursive handwriting. This is "putting a cultural technique at risk, the ability to write a common readable font ". Andresen contradicts in the [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]] interview the statement of the Grundschulverband that the Grundschrift is a connected spelling. "That's wrong. The basic inscription is a modular font, which means the letters are juxtaposed."&lt;ref&gt;[https://handschriftlich.wordpress.com/2014/05/15/kinder-konnen-sich-das-schreiben-nicht-selbst-beibringen/ - Kinder können sich das Schreiben nicht selbst beibringen]&lt;/ref&gt; Andresen is et al. supported by the writer Cornelia Funke. "To master a non-cursive handwriting does not suffice as a script, in my opinion. It does not flow like cursive and is therefore much slower. A flowing script, on the other hand, promotes the flow of thought - and at the same time is so individual that one is completely at one's own."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/cornelia-funke-die-handschrift-soll-gedanken-fliegen-lassen-12933060.html - Die Handschrift soll Gedanken fliegen lassen]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a series of articles for the taz, Andresen already pointed out that learning a bound script is a fundamental learning process for every child.  Failing to learn a script increases the risk of bad education. In this way, it occupies the position of Wilhelm Topsch against the {{ill|Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift|de|Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift|vertical-align=sup}}. The Oldenburger education scientist has proven in 1996 that there were no other scientific reports for the introduction of these in the 1970s than those of their inventor Heinrich Grünewald.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taz.de/1/zukunft/bildung/artikel/1/zurueck-zur-guten-handschrift/ - Zurück zur guten Handschrift]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taz.de/1/zukunft/bildung/artikel/1/gutachter-lobbyisten-und-autoren/ - Gutachter, Lobbyisten und Autoren]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Topsch: Das Ende einer Legende.

'''GEC Hirst Research Centre''' was one of the first specialised industrial research laboratories to be built in Britain, and was part of the [[General Electric Company plc]] empire. It was demolished in the early 1990s primarily because GEC had stopped funding serious research, as it was not immediately profitable. 

It was named after [[Baron Hirst|Hugo Hirst]], one of the founders of the company that would become [[General Electric Company plc]]. One of the centre's most famous achievements was the production of the [[cavity magnetron]] during [[World War II]], the concept of which was established by [[John Randall (physicist)|Randall]] and [[Harry Boot|Boot]] working at [[University of Birmingham|Birmingham University]]. Staff of the center were also important in developing [[radars]] for use during the war.  The 60 m [[Radio mast]] at the back of the building became, along with [[Wembley Stadium (1924)|Wembley Stadium]], one of the landmarks of the area. Hirst was also instrumental in setting up the [[National Grid (UK)|National Grid]] system which provides power to the whole of the UK. The centre also worked on the design of electrical power systems used on the British railways network.

The research centre was based in East Lane, [[Wembley]], [[Middlesex]], [[UK]], and then in the 1990s moved to [[Borehamwood]], [[UK]].

After GEC had left the Wembley site, it was used as the set for some scenes of the 1995 film, [[Young Poisoner's Handbook]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10106">'''Intangible Asset Finance''' is the branch of [[finance]] that deals with [[intangible assets]] such as [[patents]] (legal intangible) and [[reputation]] (competitive intangible). Like other areas of finance, intangible asset finance is concerned with the interdependence of [[Value (economics)|value]], [[risk]], and [[time]].

== Basic principles ==

In 2003, one estimate put the [[economic equilibrium]] of intangible assets in the U.S. [[economy]] at $5 trillion, which represented over one-third or more of the value of U.S. domestic [[corporations]] in the first quarter of 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RmFLUk7NydQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Intangible+Assets:+Values,+Measures+and+Risks,&amp;sig=W2d87NPMzvfWlTDrmUNijOziu-8#PPA28,M1 "A Trillion Dollars A Year In Intangible Investment," Leonard Nakamura in '''Intangible Assets: Values, Measures and Risks''' at 28, Hand &amp; Lev, Oxford University Press (2003).]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the goals of people working in this field is to unlock the "hidden value" found in intangible assets through the techniques of finance. Another goal is to measure how firm performance correlates with intangible asset [[management]].

Intangible assets include [[business processes]], Intellectual Property (IP) such as [[patents]], [[trademarks]], [[reputation]]s for [[ethics]] and [[integrity]], [[Quality (business)|quality]], [[safety]], [[sustainability]], [[security]], and [[Resilience (organizational)|resilience]]. Today, these intangibles drive [[cash flow]] and are the primary sources of risk. Intangible asset information, [[management]], [[risk forecasting]] and [[risk transfer]] are growing services as the [[economic base]] divests itself of physical [[assets]]. Rights to tangible and intangible assets are intangible, and can be traded globally.&lt;ref&gt;Gio Wiederhold; ''Valuing intangible Capital, Multinationals and Taxhavens''; Springer Verlag, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business models ==

A number of intangible asset business models have evolved over the years.

*'''Patent Licensing &amp; Enforcement Companies ("P-LECs")''': These are firms that acquire patents for the sole purpose of securing licenses and/or damages awards from infringing parties. Perhaps the most famous P-LEC is [[NTP, Inc.]], which has successfully asserted patents related to email [[push technology]]. Another name for a P-LEC is "[[patent troll]]," although this is viewed as a pejorative reference. Recently, [[hedge funds]] have raised capital for the specific purpose of investing in patent litigation.   One such hedge fund is Altitude Capital Partners, which is based in [[New York City]].
*'''Royalty stream securitizers''': These are firms that are engaged in the buying and selling of what are essentially specialized [[Asset-backed security|asset-backed securities]]. The assets that are securitized are typically intellectual properties, such as patents, that have been bearing royalties for a period of time. Royalty Pharma is a well known firm that uses this business model, and which has done by far the largest and most high-profile deals in this space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedeal.com/newsweekly/features/a-seller's-market.php#bottom "A seller's market," The Deal, September 5, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; Royalty Pharma handled what many consider to be the first [[pharmaceutical]] patent-backed securitization to be rated by [[Standard and Poors]], which involved a patent on the [[HIV]] drug [[Zerit]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rESRFPqSKzQC&amp;pg=PA487&amp;lpg=PA487&amp;dq=zerit+patent+securitization&amp;source=web&amp;ots=sN9S5ZWcrM&amp;sig=LhlE-nYfxXddjCKeoGql6ap5KxM&amp;hl=en#PPA487,M1 "Avoiding Transaction Peril," Heller et al., in '''From Ideas to Assets: Investing Wisely in Intellectual Property''' at 487, Bruce Berman, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;  The other parties involved in the Zerit transaction were [[Yale]] (the owner of the patent) and [[Bristol Myers Squibb]].
*'''Reinsurers''': These are firms that use the techniques of [[reinsurance]] to mitigate intangible asset risks. In the same way that some firms issue [[Catastrophe bond|cat bonds]] to mitigate the risks associated with [[extreme weather]], [[earthquake]]s, or other natural disasters, firms exposed to substantial intangible risk can issue "intangible asset risk-linked securities" that transfer intangible risk to hedge funds and other players in the capital markets with a sufficient appetite for risk. Steel City Re, which is based in [[Pittsburgh]], is a [[thought leader]] regarding the use of risk transfer techniques to protect and recover intangible asset value.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.steelcityre.com/accelerating_innovation.shtml Steel City Re]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Market makers''': Firms that are working to provide more [[liquidity]] to the market for intellectual property. Early [[market maker]]s offered on-line intellectual property exchanges where buyers and sellers could exchange rights in licensed intellectual property, usually patents. On April 22, 2008, Ocean Tomo reported&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oceantomo.com/press/Europe_Auction_Catalogue_Release_4.22.08.pdf Ocean Tomo Press Release April 22, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; that it had transacted approximately $70 million in its IP auctions across [[Europe]] and the [[United States]]. In 2009, The Intellectual Property Exchange International (IPXI), headquartered in Chicago, will begin operations as the world’s first [[stock exchange]] with an intellectual property focus.
*'''Investment Research Firms''': Companies that provide specific advice to investors on intellectual property issues.   Recently, hedge fund managers have been hiring patent [[Lawyer|attorneys]] to follow and handicap outcomes in high-stakes patent cases.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

== Significant transactions ==

*'''1997''':  [[David Bowie]] securitizes the future royalty revenues earned from his pre-1990 music catalogue by issuing [[Bowie Bonds]].
*'''2000''': BioPharma Royalty Trust completes the $115 million securitization of a single Yale patent with claims covering [[Stavudine]], which is a [[reverse transcriptase inhibitor]] and the active ingredient in the drug Zerit. This was the first publicly rated patent securitization in the U.S. At the time of the deal, Bristol Myers Squibb had the exclusive rights to distribute Zerit in the U.S. Not long after closing slow sales of Zerit along with an accounting [[scandal]] at Bristol Myers Squibb triggered the accelerated and premature [[amortization]] of the transaction. Many observers believe that this deal was ultimately unsuccessful because of a lack of [[Diversification (finance)|diversification]] as it involved a single patent and a single [[licensee]].
*'''2005''': UCC Capital Corporation securitization of BCBG [[Max Azria]]'s royalty receivables generated from worldwide intellectual property rights worth $53 million. This transaction is recognized as the first "whole company securitization" involving primarily intangible assets. UCC Capital Corporation was founded by Robert W. D'Loren, and was acquired by [[NexCen Brands, Inc.]] in 2006. NexCen sold substantially all of its assets to Levine Leichtman Capital Partners in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/05/13/idUS107689+13-May-2010+BW20100513 NexCen Press Release, May 13, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''2005''': Ocean Tomo holds its first live IP auction. Although proceeds from the first auction were unremarkable, the relative success of the Ocean Tomo auctions that followed showed that the live auction is a reasonably viable business model for monetizing intellectual property.
*'''2006''':  [[Marvel Entertainment]]'s film rights securitization in conjunction with [[Ambac Financial Group]] to provide a triple-A financial guarantee on a [[credit facility]] for Marvel backed by a slate of 10 films to be produced by Marvel Studios and [[intellectual property]] related to some of Marvel’s most popular [[comic book]] characters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ambac.com/pdfs%5CDeals%5Cmarvel.pdf Ambac's press release, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Government, societies, think tanks, and other non-profits ==

On June 23, 2008, the [[United States National Academies]] hosted a one-day conference in [[Washington, D.C.]] entitled "Intangible Assets: Measuring and Enhancing Their Contribution to Corporate Value and Economic Growth."

[[The Intangible Asset Finance Society]] provides a forum for finance, innovation, legal and management professionals to discover better ways to create, capture and preserve the value of intangible assets.

The Athena Alliance is a non-profit organization dedicated to
public education and research on the emerging global [[information economy]]. On April 16, 2008 it published&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.athenaalliance.org/pdf/IntangibleAssetMonetization.pdf "Intangible Asset Monetization: The Promise and the Reality"]&lt;/ref&gt; a widely circulated working paper on the topic of intangible asset finance.

'''The Music Department at the University Library of Southern Denmark''' in [[Odense]] has through donations and acquisitions since 1997 achieved the status of research archive of specialised jazz studies.

The Danish Jazz Center closed on 1 July 1997. Much of the collection was transferred to the former [[Odense University]] Library, including the Center's public collection, the [[Timme Rosenkrantz]] Collection, the [[Ben Webster]] Collection, the Radio Jazz Collection, and the Erik Lindemann Collection. A smaller part went to the Danish Jazz Association while that part of the collection which belonged to the Head of the Center, Arnvid Meyer, has been purchased by the [[Danish Royal Library]] although it has up to now remained in Meyer's possession. The collections at the [[University Library of Southern Denmark]] have been enlarged due to purchases and donations, such as the private collections of [[Svend Asmussen]] and [[Richard Boone (musician)|Richard Boone]].

The collections are housed in the Music Department and can be used during the Music Department's open hours. They are only for use on the premises and are not for loan. A room with all forms of listening facilities is available. Indexes to the Jazz Center's collections of tape recordings and videos and the Rosenkrantz, Webster, and Lindemann collections accompanied the collections and they can be used on the premises. All the books, sheet music, records, CDs and DVDs are catalogued and can be retrieved in the library's catalogue. Current registration is concentrated on the reel-to-reel tapes in Rosenkrantz's collection.

==The specific collections (as of June 1, 2007)==

===The Danish Jazz Center's Public Collection===
This part of the Danish Jazz Center's collection was purchased with funds allocated by the former Statens Musikråd. The collection contains more than 50 sheets of music, 49 books, 1516 78-rpm records, 482 LPs, 300 CDs and a number of journals, some of which are not to be found in any other Danish library.

The collection consists of more than 2600 reel-to-reel tapes, 1000 [[Compact Cassette|cassette tapes]] and 500 [[Digital Audio Tape]]s of jazz broadcasts including both music and interviews taped from Denmark's Radio between 1975-1997. These tapes are invaluable documentation of what went on the jazz scene during this period. On top of this there are about 700 [[Videocassette recorder|video tapes]] taped from both Danish, Swedish and [[German television]] between 1980-1997, spanning from old [[Short subject|short films]] to contemporary concert recordings.

===Timme Rosenkrantz's Collection===
Timme Rosenkrantz (1911-1969) was an author, a jazz enthusiast and collector, speaker and radio broadcaster. The collection, which is concentrated on [[Swing (genre)|swing music]], consists of 1679 78’s, 170 EPs, 1055 LPs, 411 acetates, 923 reel-to-reel tapes and 103 books. The acetates are unique as they are privately cut acetate records with recordings made by Rosenkrantz himself in New York during [[World War II|the Second World War]] with famous musicians or recorded from the radio. 
There are rarities as there are many valuable jazz concerts recorded from Danish, Swedish and American radio, which haven't otherwise been preserved. There are also many catalogues, press cuttings and manuscripts for radio broadcasts and articles as well as a fine collection of more than 3000 photos of musicians and orchestras, many of which were taken by Rosenkrantz himself.

===Ben Webster's Collection===
This collection contains 45 78-rpm records, 211 LPs, 12 acetate records, 137 reel-to-reel tapes and one book. They are all catalogued in the library's catalogue. There are some sensational recordings to be found on the privately cut acetate records and reel-to-reel tapes, some of them by Webster himself. There is also a large collection memorabilia in the form of more than 1600 slides, 20 narrow-gauge films, 700 photographs and some private papers.

===Erik Lindemann's Collection===
This collection consists of 160 cassette tapes with recordings made by Lindemann at Copenhagen music clubs from 1994-1995, primarily with groups, which are not otherwise found on any records.

===Radio Jazz's Collection===
Radio Jazz is a Copenhagen local radio programme broadcasting several times a week. The collection consists of 100 reel-to-reel tapes and 600 digital audio tapes containing broadcasts of especially important documentation value, such as interviews and concerts. It documents the jazz scene in Copenhagen since Radio Jazz started broadcasting in 1987. The library hasn't received broadcasts from Radio Jazz since 2006 because it hasn't been possible to get hold of more digital audio tapes. The library has a complete collection of the publication ''Radio Jazz'', which among other things, registers and reviews all the broadcasts.

===Svend Asmussen's Collection===
The library received a collection from Svend Asmussen in September 2003 consisting of 14 LPs, 33 CDs, 25 reel-to-reel tapes, 11 cassette tapes, 2 videos, 8 books and 7 journal issues plus 189 photos and a large collection of concert programmes, reviews, press mentions, posters, and other memorabilia covering all his career.

===Richard Boone's Collection===
The library received a large collection, primarily of a private character, from Inga Boone, widow of the trombone player and singer Richard Boone, in November 2006. This collection contains many private papers, contracts and photos, plus instruments, microphones, cases, hats, portrait paintings, scrapbooks, posters, and other items, plus 2 LPs, 24 CDs and 10 books.

===The Other Collections of SDUB===
Since the introduction in 1991 of a rhythmical line of study at the Carl Nielsen Academy of Music Odense, the library's acquisition within the jazz genre has increased to the point that on 1 May 2007 the collection consisted of more than 900 books, 850 sheet music, 312 78's, 191 EPs, 4100 LPs, 4200 CDs, 179 DAT tapes and 73 videos plus a number of current and ceased to be published journals including older Danish publications. There is a collection of documents in the form of miscellaneous jazz festival and jazz concert programmes from Denmark and abroad, a complete set of programmes from [[Jazzhus Montmartre]] (1983-1990), Jazzhus Sophus Ferdinand, Odense (1974-1986), Værtshuset i Odense (1971-1972), Jazzhus Dexter in Odense (1998- ) as well as Brande Bookshops's postal order catalogue of jazz records (1955-1973). The library has also received minutes of meetings, letters, applications and regulations, and other materials from the Danish Jazz Association (1970-1977) and a very fine donation in the form of Ole "Fessor" Lindgreen's scrapbooks (1957-2001) from his Big City Band in all of 13 volumes.
Much of the collection has been received as donations and the library will be very happy to continue receiving jazz donations but it reserves the right to take out duplicate copies and give them to the students.

'''Global sustainability statistics''' are benchmarks for measuring the status of sustainability parameters. The following agencies provide baseline data for sustainability governance. They are just one form of data used for [[sustainability accounting]] and are valuable for assessing trends and measuring progress. 

'''This list provides sources of statistics at the ''global'' level of governance only.'''

'''Mary Beatrice Midgley''' (née '''Scrutton'''; 13 September 1919 &amp;ndash; 10 October 2018&lt;ref name="nytobit" /&gt;) was a British philosopher. She was a Senior Lecturer in Philosophy at [[Newcastle University]] and was known for her work on science, ethics and [[animal rights]]. She wrote her first book, ''Beast And Man'' (1978), when she was in her fifties. She has since written over 15 other books, including ''Animals and Why They Matter'' (1983), ''Wickedness'' (1984), ''The Ethical Primate'' (1994), ''Evolution as a Religion'' (1985), and ''Science as Salvation'' (1992). She has been awarded honorary doctorates by [[Durham University|Durham]] and [[Newcastle University|Newcastle]] universities. Her autobiography, ''The Owl of Minerva'', was published in 2005.

Midgley strongly opposed [[reductionism]] and [[scientism]], and any attempts to make science a substitute for the humanities—a role for which it is, she argued, wholly inadequate. She wrote extensively about what philosophers can learn from nature, particularly from animals. A number of her books and articles discussed philosophical ideas appearing in popular science, including those of [[Richard Dawkins]]. She also wrote in favour of a moral interpretation of the [[Gaia hypothesis]]. ''The Guardian'' described her as a fiercely combative philosopher and the UK's "foremost scourge of 'scientific pretension.'"&lt;ref name=brown2001&gt;{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Andrew|title=Mary, Mary, quite contrary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/saturday_review/story/0,3605,421561,00.html|work=The Guardian|date=13 January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Midgley was born in London to Lesley and Tom Scrutton.&lt;ref name="nytobit" /&gt; Her father, the son of the eminent judge Sir [[Thomas Edward Scrutton]], was a [[curate]] in Dulwich and later chaplain of [[King's College Chapel, Cambridge|King's College, Cambridge]]. She was raised in Cambridge, Greenford and Ealing, and educated at [[Downe House School]] in [[Cold Ash, Berkshire]], where she developed her interest in classics and philosophy:

[[File:KingsCollegeChapelWest.jpg|thumb|left|Midgley's father was a [[King's College, Cambridge|King's College]] chaplain.]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;[A] new and vigorous Classics teacher offered to teach a few of us [[Classical Greek|Greek]], and that too was somehow slotted into our timetables. We loved this and worked madly at it, which meant that with considerable efforts on all sides, it was just possible for us to go to college on Classics … I had decided to read Classics rather than English – which was the first choice that occurred to me – because my English teacher, bless her, pointed out that English literature is something that you read in any case, so it is better to study something that you otherwise wouldn't. Someone also told me that, if you did Classics at Oxford, you could do Philosophy as well. I knew very little about this but, as I had just found Plato, I couldn't resist trying it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Midgley|first=Mary|title=The Owl of Minerva|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-36788-3|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Somerville College.jpg|thumb|Midgley read [[Literae Humaniores|Greats]] at Oxford, going up to [[Somerville College, Oxford|Somerville]] in 1938.]]
She took the Oxford entrance exam in the autumn of 1937, gaining a place at [[Somerville College]]. During the year before starting university, it was arranged that she would live in [[Austria]] for three months to learn [[German language|German]], but she had to leave after a month because of the [[Anschluss|worsening political situation]]. At Somerville she studied [[Literae Humaniores|Mods and Greats]] alongside [[Iris Murdoch]], graduating with first-class honours.

Several of her lasting friendships that began at Oxford were with scientists, and she credited them with having educated her in a number of scientific disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Midgley|first=Mary|title=The Owl of Minerva|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-36788-3|pages=93–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a split in the Labour club at Oxford over the Soviet Union's actions, she was on the committee of the newly formed Democratic Socialist Club alongside [[Tony Crosland]] and [[Roy Jenkins]]. She writes that her career in philosophy may have been affected by women having a greater voice in discussion at the time, because many male undergraduates left after a year to fight in the [[Second World War]]: "I think myself that this experience has something to do with the fact that [[Elizabeth Anscombe|Elizabeth]] [Anscombe] and I and [[Iris Murdoch|Iris]] [Murdoch] and [[Philippa Foot]] and [[Mary Warnock]] have all made our names in philosophy... I do think that in normal times a lot of good female thinking is wasted because it simply doesn't get heard."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Midgley|first=Mary|title=The Owl of Minerva|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-36788-3|page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Midgley left Oxford in 1942 and went into the [[civil service]], as "the war put graduate work right out of the question". Instead, she "spent the rest of the war doing various kinds of work that were held to be of national importance".&lt;ref name="notdoc"&gt;{{cite web|last=Midgley|first=Mary|title=Proud not to be a doctor|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2005/oct/03/highereducation.uk2|work=The Guardian|date=3 October 2005|accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time she was also a teacher at Downe School and [[Bedford School]]. She returned to Oxford in 1947 to do graduate work with [[Gilbert Murray]]. She began research on [[Plotinus]]'s view of the soul, which she has described as "so unfashionable and so vast that I never finished my thesis".&lt;ref name="notdoc" /&gt; In retrospect Midgley has written of her belief that she is "lucky" to have missed out in having a [[doctorate]]. She argues that one of the main flaws in doctoral training is that, while it "shows you how to deal with difficult arguments", it does not "help you to grasp the big questions that provide its context – the background issues out of which the small problems arose."&lt;ref name="notdoc" /&gt;

In 1949 Midgley went to [[Reading University]], teaching in the philosophy department there for four terms. In 1950 she married [[G.C.J. Midgley|Geoffrey Midgley]] (died 1997),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-geoffrey-midgley-1260317.html|title=Obituary: Geoffrey Midgley|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; also a philosopher. They moved to [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], where he got a job in the philosophy department of [[Newcastle University]].&lt;ref name="observer2014" /&gt; Midgley gave up teaching for several years while she had three sons (Tom, David and Martin),&lt;ref name=brown2001 /&gt; before also getting a job in the philosophy department at Newcastle, where she and her husband were both "much loved".&lt;ref name="observer2014" /&gt; Midgley taught there between 1962 and 1980.&lt;ref name=fellow&gt;{{cite web|title=Honorary Fellow – Mary Midgley|url=http://www.ncl.ac.uk/peals/people/honorary/midgley.htm|accessdate=24 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140324155647/http://www.ncl.ac.uk/peals/people/honorary/midgley.htm|archivedate=24 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her time at Newcastle, she began studying [[ethology]] and this led to her first book, ''Beast and Man'' (1978), published when she was 59. "I wrote no books until I was a good 50, and I'm jolly glad because I didn't know what I thought before then."&lt;ref name="brown2001"/&gt;

==Awards==
Midgley was awarded an honorary [[Doctor of Letters|D.Litt.]] by [[Durham University]] in 1995&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honorary Degrees – Durham University|url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/university.calendar/volumei/honorary_degrees/|accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an honorary [[Doctor of Civil Law]] by [[Newcastle University]] in 2008.&lt;ref name=fellow /&gt; She was an honorary fellow of the Policy, Ethics and Life Sciences Research Centre at Newcastle University.&lt;ref name=fellow /&gt;

==Death==
Midgley died at the age of 99 in [[Jesmond]] on 10 October 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/obituaries/mary-midgley-dead.html|title=Mary Midgley, 99, Moral Philosopher for the General Reader, Is Dead|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardianobit"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Heal|first1=Jane|title=Mary Midgley obituary |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/oct/12/mary-midgley-obituary|work=The Guardian|date=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Ideas and arguments==

===Views on philosophy and religion===
Midgley argued that philosophy is like [[plumbing]], something that nobody notices until it goes wrong. "Then suddenly we become aware of some bad smells, and we have to take up the floorboards and look at the concepts of even the most ordinary piece of thinking. The great philosophers ... noticed how badly things were going wrong, and made suggestions about how they could be dealt with."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Else|first=Liz|title=Mary, Mary quite contrary|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=mg17223154.800|work=New Scientist|date=3 November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite her upbringing, she did not embrace Christianity herself, because, she says, "I couldn't make it work. I would try to pray and it didn't seem to get me anywhere so I stopped after a while. But I think it's a perfectly sensible world view."&lt;ref name=observer2014 /&gt; She also argues that the world's religions should not simply be ignored: "It turns out that the evils which have infested religion are not confined to it, but are ones that can accompany any successful human institution. Nor is it even clear that religion itself is something that the human race either can or should be cured of."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Midgley|first=Mary|title=The myths we live by|year=2003|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Midgley's book ''Wickedness'' (1984) has been described as coming "closest to addressing a theological theme: the problem of evil."&lt;ref name=erasmus&gt;{{cite web|last=McEachran|first=Alan|title=Mary Midgley|url=http://ptolemy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/MaryMidgley.pdf|work=Erasmus Darwin Society|accessdate=27 March 2014|date=May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, Midgley argues that we need to understand the human capacity for wickedness, rather than blaming God for it. Midgley argues that evil arises from aspects of human nature, not from an external force. She further argues that evil is the absence of good, with good being described as the positive virtues such as generosity, courage and kindness. Therefore, evil is the absence of these characteristics, leading to selfishness, cowardice and similar. She therefore criticises existentialism and other schools of thought which promote the 'Rational Will' as a free agent. She also criticises the tendency to demonise those deemed 'wicked', by failing to acknowledge that they also display some measure of some of the virtues.&lt;ref name=erasmus /&gt;

Midgley also expressed her interest in [[Paul Davies]]' ideas on the inherent improbability of the order found in the universe. She argued that "there's some sort of tendency towards the formation of order", including towards life and "perceptive life".&lt;ref name=observer2014 /&gt; The best way, she argued, of talking about this is using the concept of "a life force", although she acknowledged that this is "vague".&lt;ref name=observer2014 /&gt; She also argued that "gratitude" is an important part of the motivation for [[theism]]. "You go out on a day like this and you're really grateful. I don't know who to."&lt;ref name=observer2014 /&gt;

This understanding also links with Midgley's argument that the concept of [[Gaia hypothesis|Gaia]] has "both a scientific and a religious aspect."&lt;ref name=demosp21&gt;{{cite book|last=Midgley|first=Mary|title=Gaia: The next big idea|year=2001|publisher=Demos publications|isbn=1-84180-075-9|page=21|url=http://www.demos.co.uk/catalogue/gaia/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050830013608/http://www.demos.co.uk/catalogue/gaia/|archivedate=30 August 2005|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; She argued that people find this hard to grasp because our views on both science and religion have been narrowed so much that the connections between them are now obscured.&lt;ref name=demosp21 /&gt; This is not, however, about belief in a personal God, but instead about responding to the system of life, as revealed by Gaia, with "wonder, awe and gratitude"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Midgley|first=Mary|title=Gaia: The next big idea|year=2001|publisher=Demos publications|isbn=1-84180-075-9|page=24|url=http://www.demos.co.uk/catalogue/gaia/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050830013608/http://www.demos.co.uk/catalogue/gaia/|archivedate=30 August 2005|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gaia and philosophy===
Midgley was supportive of [[James Lovelock]]'s [[Gaia hypothesis]]. This was part of her "principal passion" of "reviving our reverence for the earth".&lt;ref name=fellow /&gt; Midgley also described Gaia as a "breakthrough", as it was "the first time a theory derived from scientific measurements has carried with it an implicit moral imperative – the need to act in the interests of this living system on which we all depend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wakeford|first=Tom|title=In a climate of change|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/features/in-a-climate-of-change/153581.article|accessdate=28 March 2014|newspaper=Times Higher Education|date=22 September 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 Midgley founded, along with David Midgley and Tom Wakeford, the Gaia Network, and became its first Chair.&lt;ref name&gt;{{cite book|title=Earthly realism|year=2007|publisher=Societas|isbn=978-1845400804|page=vi|editor=Mary Midgley|chapter=Contributors}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=network&gt;{{cite web|title=About us – Gaia Network|url=http://www.gaiaweb.uk.net/GAIAWEB/Gaboutus.php|accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their regular meetings on the implications of Gaia led to the 2007 book ''Earthy realism'' edited by Midgley, which sought to bring together the scientific and spiritual aspects of Gaia theory.&lt;ref name=network /&gt;

Midgley's 2001 pamphlet for [[Demos (UK think tank)|Demos]] ''Gaia: The next big idea'' argues for the importance of the idea of Gaia as a "powerful tool" in science, morality, psychology and politics, to gain a more holistic understanding of the world.&lt;ref name=demosp11&gt;{{cite book|last=Midgley|first=Mary|title=Gaia: The next big idea|year=2001|publisher=Demos publications|isbn=1-84180-075-9|page=11|url=http://www.demos.co.uk/catalogue/gaia/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050830013608/http://www.demos.co.uk/catalogue/gaia/|archivedate=30 August 2005|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Midgley argued that we "must learn how to value various aspects of our environment, how to structure social relationships and institutions so that we value social and spiritual life, as well as the natural world, alongside commercial and economic aspects.&lt;ref name=demosp11 /&gt;

Her book ''Science and Poetry'', also published in 2001, also includes a discussion on the idea of Gaia, which she argued "is not a gratuitous, semi-mystical fantasy", but instead is "a useful idea, a cure for distortions that spoil our current world-view."&lt;ref name=poetry172&gt;{{cite book|last=Midgley|first=Mary|title=Science and poetry|year=2001|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415378482|page=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is useful both in finding practical solutions to environmental problems and also in giving us "a more realistic view of ourselves".&lt;ref name=poetry172 /&gt; Gaia has, Midgely argued, both scientific and moral importance, which also involves politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Midgley|first=Mary|title=Science and poetry|year=2001|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415378482|page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a religious angle to Gaia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Midgley|first=Mary|title=Science and poetry|year=2001|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415378482|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===On reductionism and materialism===
''Beast and Man'' was an examination of human nature and a reaction against the reductionism of [[sociobiology]], and the [[relativism]] and [[behaviorism]] she saw as prevalent in much of social science. She argued that human beings are more similar to animals than many social scientists then acknowledged, while animals are in many ways more sophisticated than was often accepted.&lt;ref name=observer2014 /&gt; She criticised existentialists who argued that there was no such thing as human nature and writers such as [[Desmond Morris]] who she understood as arguing that human nature was "brutal and nasty".&lt;ref name=observer2014 /&gt; Instead, she argued that human beings and their relationship with animals could be better understood by using the [[Qualitative research|qualitative]] methods of ethology and [[comparative psychology]], and that this approach showed that "we do have a nature and it's much more in the middle.&lt;ref name=observer2014 /&gt;

Writing in the 2002 introduction to the reprint of ''Evolution as a Religion'' (1985), Midgley reported that she wrote both this book, and the later ''Science as Salvation'' (1992) to counter the "quasi-scientific speculation"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Midgley|first=Mary|title=Evolution as a Religion|year=2002|page=ix|chapter=New Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; of "certain remarkable [[Prophesy|prophetic]] and [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] passages that appeared suddenly in scientific books, often in their last chapters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Midgley|first=Mary|title=Evolution as a Religion|year=2002|page=iii|chapter=New Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Evolution as a Religion'' dealt with the theories of evolutionary biologists, including [[Richard Dawkins|Dawkins]], while ''Science as Salvation'' dealt with the theories of physicists and [[artificial intelligence]] researchers. Midgley writes that she still believes that these theories, "have nothing to do with any reputable theory of evolution,"&lt;ref name=intropx&gt;{{cite book|last=Midgley|first=Mary|title=Evolution as a Religion|year=2002|page=x|chapter=New Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; and will not solve the real social and moral problems the world is facing, either through [[genetic engineering]] or the use of machines. She concludes: "These schemes still seem to me to be just displacement activities proposed in order to avoid facing our real difficulties."&lt;ref name=intropx /&gt; "[I]n exposing these rhetorical attempts to turn science into a comprehensive ideology," she wrote in ''The myths we live by'', "I am not attacking science but defending it against dangerous misconstructions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Midgley|first=Mary|title=The myths we live by|year=2003|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Midgley argued against reductionism, or the attempt to impose any one approach to understanding the world. She suggests that there are "many maps, many windows," arguing that "we need ''scientific pluralism''—the recognition that there are many independent forms and sources of knowledge—rather than reductivism, the conviction that one fundamental form underlies them all and settles everything." She writes that it is helpful to think of the world as "a huge aquarium. We cannot see it as a whole from above, so we peer in at it through a number of small windows ... We can eventually make quite a lot of sense of this habitat if we patiently put together the data from different angles.  But if we insist that our own window is the only one worth looking through, we shall not get very far."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Midgley|first=Mary|title=The myths we live by|year=2003|pages=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She argued that, "acknowledging matter as somehow akin to and penetrated by mind is not adding a new ... assumption ... it is becoming aware of something we are doing already." She suggested that "this topic is essentially the one which caused Einstein often to remark that the really surprising thing about science is that it works at all ... the simple observation that the laws of thought turn out to be the laws of things."&lt;ref&gt;Midgley 1992, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

Midgley wrote her 2014 book, ''Are you an illusion?'' as a response to [[Francis Crick]]'s argument in his book ''The Astonishing Hypothesis'' that a person's sense of personal identity and free will is no more than the behaviour of nerve cells. She attacks the understanding inherent in this argument that everything, including a sense of self, can be understood through its physical properties.&lt;ref name=observer2014&gt;{{cite web|last=Anthony|first=Andrew|title=Mary Midgley: a late stand for a philosopher with soul|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/23/mary-midgley-philosopher-soul-human-consciousness|work=The Observer|accessdate=24 March 2014|date=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, she argues that there are different levels of explanation, which need to be studied using different methods. This means that thoughts and memories are an integral part of reality for both humans and animals and need to be studied as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cave|first=Stephen|title=Review of Are you an illusion?|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/70476606-ae8e-11e3-aaa6-00144feab7de.html|work=Financial Times|accessdate=24 March 2014|date=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Midgley–Dawkins debate&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Richard Dawkins]] --&gt;===
In volume 53 (1978) of ''Philosophy'', the journal of the [[Royal Institute of Philosophy]], [[J. L. Mackie]] published an article entitled ''The Law of the Jungle: Moral Alternatives and Principles of Evolution'', praising Dawkins's ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', and discussing how its ideas might be applied to moral philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalinstitutephilosophy.org/articles/article.php?id=11 |title=Mackie 1978 |accessdate=2005-09-25 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051031044742/http://www.royalinstitutephilosophy.org/articles/article.php?id=11 |archivedate=31 October 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Midgley responded in volume 54 (1979) with "Gene-Juggling," arguing that ''The Selfish Gene'' was about [[psychological egoism]], rather than evolution.&lt;ref name="Gene Juggling"&gt;Midgley 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; The paper criticised Dawkins' concepts, but was judged by its targets to be intemperate and personal in tone, and as having misunderstood Dawkins' ideas. Midgley disputed this view, arguing that while Dawkins purports to be talking about genes—that is, chemical arrangements—he nonetheless slides over to saying that "we are born selfish" (''The Selfish Gene'', p.&amp;nbsp;3).

She wrote that she had previously "not attended to Dawkins, thinking it unnecessary to '[[Who breaks a butterfly upon a wheel?|break a butterfly upon a wheel]]'. But Mr Mackie's article is not the only indication I have lately met of serious attention being paid to his fantasies."&lt;ref name="Gene Juggling"/&gt; In a rejoinder in 1981, Dawkins retorted that the comment was "hard to match, in reputable journals, for its patronising condescension toward a fellow academic."&lt;ref name=dawkins81&gt;[http://cdn.cloudfiles.mosso.com/c114612/documents/2008/Reply_to_Midgley.pdf Dawkins 1981] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110301125759/http://cdn.cloudfiles.mosso.com/c114612/documents/2008/Reply_to_Midgley.pdf |date=1 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that she "raises the art of misunderstanding to dizzy heights. My central point had no connection with what she alleges. I am not even very directly interested in man, or at least not in his emotional nature. My book is about the evolution of life, not the ethics of one particular, rather aberrant, species."&lt;ref name=dawkins81/&gt; In volume 58 (1983), Midgley replied again, in "Selfish Genes and Social Darwinism": "Apology is due, not only for the delay but for the impatient tone of my article. One should not lose one's temper, and doing so always makes for confused argument ... [but my] basic objections remain."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalinstitutephilosophy.org/articles/article.php?id=15 |title=Midgley 1983 |accessdate=2005-09-25 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051031044834/http://www.royalinstitutephilosophy.org/articles/article.php?id=15 |archivedate=31 October 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bad feeling between Dawkins and Midgley appeared not to diminish. In a note to page 55 in the 2nd edition of ''The Selfish Gene'' (1989), Dawkins refers to her "highly intemperate and vicious paper." Midgley continued to criticise Dawkins' ideas. In her books ''Evolution as a Religion'' (2002) and ''The Myths We Live By'' (2003), she writes about what she sees as his confused use of language—the sleight of hand involved in using terms such as "selfish" in different ways without alerting the reader to the change in meaning—and some of what she regards as his [[rhetoric]] ("genes exert ultimate power over behaviour"), which she argues is more akin to religion than science. She wrote in a letter to ''The Guardian'' in 2005:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[There is] widespread discontent with the [[neo-Darwinist]]—or Dawkinsist—orthodoxy that claims something which Darwin himself denied, namely that natural selection is the sole and exclusive cause of evolution, making the world therefore, in some important sense, entirely random. This is itself a strange faith which ought not to be taken for granted as part of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/science/2005/sep/06/religion.news|title=Letters: Designs on Darwinism|date=5 September 2005|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In an interview with ''[[The Independent]]'' in September 2007, she argued that Dawkins' views on evolution are ideologically driven: "The ideology Dawkins is selling is the worship of competition. It is projecting a [[Thatcherite]] take on economics on to evolution. It's not an impartial scientific view; it's a political drama."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/incoming/article2977701.ece|title=Jackson, 3 January 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2009 Midgley reiterated her critical interpretation of ''The Selfish Gene'' as part of a series of articles on [[Hobbes]] in ''The Guardian''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/apr/20/religion-philosophy-hobbes-dawkins-selfishness|title=Mary Midgley: Selfishness: where Dawkins got it wrong|first=Mary|last=Midgley|date=20 April 2009|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her 2010 book ''The Solitary Self: Darwin and the Selfish Gene'', she argues that "simple one-sided accounts of human motives, such as the "selfish gene" tendency in recent neo-Darwinian thought, may be illuminating but are always unrealistic."&lt;ref&gt;''The Solitary Self'', publisher's description&lt;/ref&gt;

==Midgley in art==
Midgley is referred to in ''[[The Lives of Animals]]'' (1999), an unusual fictional work by the South African novelist [[J. M. Coetzee]]. The book has been likened to a cross between a short story and a philosophical dialogue, as Coetzee's protagonist, Elizabeth Costello, often speaks at length about philosophical ideas. Many reviewers expressed bafflement at the text, which has an enigmatic and riddling style. As one reviewer noted, "the reader is not quite sure whether he is intended to spot some confusion or contradiction or non-sequitur in [the protagonist's] arguments."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2003/11/20/disturbing-the-peace/ | title=Disturbing the Peace - a review of Elizabeth Costello by J.M. Coetzee | work=[[The New York Review of Books]] | date=November 20, 2003 | accessdate=June 15, 2018 | author=Lodge, David| authorlink = David Lodge (author)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics however have noted many affinities between ''The Lives of Animals'' and Midgley's philosophy, and have used Midgley's ideas to make sense of Coetzee's famously confusing work.

The main character, who also appears in Coetzee's novel ''[[Elizabeth Costello]]'', is concerned with the moral status of animals, a subject Midgley addressed in ''Animals and Why They Matter'', and discusses at length the idea of sympathy as an ethical concept, a subject Midgley wrote about in ''Beast and Man''. Andy Lamey wrote that the result of these and other similarities is that Coetzee's work "evoke[s] a particular conception of ethics, one very similar to that of the philosopher Mary Midgley. Such a view affords a central role to sympathy and is fundamentally opposed to a long-standing rival view, most clearly exemplified by the social contract tradition, which prioritizes an instrumental conception of rationality."&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1715344 Lamey 2010], p. 172; for similarities between Midley and Coetzee, see pp. 175–181&lt;/ref&gt;

Coetzee and Midgley additionally shared a longstanding fascination with [[Robinson Crusoe]]. Coetzee retells the Crusoe story in his novel ''[[Foe (novel)|Foe]]'', while Midgley wrote about Crusoe in her essay "Duties Concerning Islands." Midgley's essay argued for the idea that human beings can have ethical obligations to non-human entities such as animals and ecosystems, an idea also found in ''The Lives of Animals'', ''Foe'' and many other works by Coetzee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1715344 Lamey 2010], p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;

Midgley agreed to sit for sculptor [[Jon Edgar]] in Newcastle during 2006, as part of the [[Environment Triptych]], along with heads of [[Richard Mabey]] and [[James Lovelock]].&lt;ref&gt;Edgar 2008&lt;/ref&gt; This was exhibited at [[Yorkshire Sculpture Park]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;''Jon Edgar - Sculpture Series Heads: Terracotta Portraits of Contributors to British Sculpture'' (2013) Scott, M., Hall, P., and Pheby, H. {{ISBN|978-0955867514}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mi'kma'ki''' or '''Mi'gma'gi''' is the traditional and current territories of the [[Mi'kmaq]] people. It is shared by an [[Non-governmental organization|inter-Nation forum]] between Mi'kmaq [[First Nations]] and is divided into seven geographical and traditional districts, with an eighth representing [[Newfoundland (island)|Taqamkuk]] today. Mi'kma'ki is one of the confederate countries within [[Wabanaki Confederacy|Wabanaki]].

Each district was autonomous, headed by a ''[[Sachem|Sagamaw]]'', who would gather alongside [[Wampum]] readers and knowledge keepers called ''Putu's'', a women's council and the ''Kji Sagamaw'', or Grand Chief, to form the [[Grand Council (Mi'kmaq)|''Sante''' or ''Mi'kmawey Mawio'mi'']] (Grand Council).&lt;ref name="Diss"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McMillan|first1=Leslie Jane|title=Mi'kmawey Mawio'mi: Changing Roles of the Mi'kmaq Grand Council From the Early Seventeenth Century to the Present|date=December 1996|pages=219|url=http://www.nlc-bnc.ca/obj/s4/f2/dsk2/ftp04/mq24981.pdf|accessdate=26 September 2017|publisher=Dalhousie University}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seat of the Sante' Mawio'mi is at [[Chapel Island (Canada)|Mniku]] in [[Cape Breton Island|Unama'kik]] and still functions as the capital today in the [[Potlotek]] reserve.

Following contact, Mi'kma'ki was colonized by the French [[Acadia|Acadian]] and British [[Nova Scotia]] colonies and their competing claims for the land. Siding with the French, the Mi'kmaq fought alongside other Wabanaki troops during the [[French and Indian Wars|global wars between 1688-1763]]. The European powers divided Mi'kma'ki in the treaties of [[Treaty of Utrecht|Utrecht]] and [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Paris (1763)]]. The British claimed Mi'kma'ki as their possession by conquest and the defeated Mi'kmaq signed the Peace and Friendship Treaties to end hostilities and encourage cooperation between the Wabanaki countries and the British and ensure the survival of the Mi'kmaq people whose numbers had dwindled to a few thousand from disease and starvation. The power held within Mi'kma'ki faded further after the Confederation of Canada united the colonies and Canada passed the [[Indian Act]], and the loss of autonomous governance. 

Today, the Sante' Mawio'mi functions solely as a spiritual and dialogue forum, with oversight held by the [[Government of Canada]] through Mi'kmaq First Nations instead of Mi'kma'ki and the Kji Sagamaw. The traditional lands' sovereignty has never been ceded by the Mi'kmaq,{{sfn|Paul|2000|p=160}} although legal arguments have been made that the Peace and Friendship treaties legitimized the takeover of the land by Britain.

==Governance==
[[File:Micmac camp.jpg|thumb|left|Mi'kmaq camp in [[Unama'kik]] in 1857]]

Traditionally each district had its own independent government. Those governments were composed of a chief and a council. The council included the band chiefs, elders and other important leaders. The role of the councils was similar to those of any independent government and included to edict laws, establish a justice system, divide the territory for hunting and fishing, make war and search for peace. 

The overarching [[Grand Council (Mi'kmaq)|Grand Council Sante Mawiomi]] was composed of the ''keptinaq'' (captains), the district chiefs. The Grand Council also included elders, ''putus'' (historians reading the belts) and a Council of women. The Grand Council was headed by a grand chief who was one of the district chiefs, generally the Unama'kik chief. Succession was hereditary. The seat of the Grand Council was generally on [[Cape Breton Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mi'kmaq |url=https://intercontinentalcry.org/indigenous-peoples/mikmaq/ |website=Intercontinental Cry |access-date=2 December 2016}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Moshe Idel''' ({{lang-he-n|משה אידל}}) is a Romanian born historian and philosopher of Jewish mysticism. He is Emeritus Max Cooper Professor in Jewish Thought at the [[Hebrew University]], Jerusalem, and a Senior Researcher at the [[Shalom Hartman Institute]].

==Life and scholarship==
{{Kabbalah}}
{{Jewish philosophy}}
Born in [[Târgu Neamț]], [[Romania]], in 1947, Idel was a precocious child, with a passion for reading which made him read all the books in the town, cooperative, then High school Library, in addition to buying more books with the money earned by singing at weddings.&lt;ref name="idee.ro"&gt;http://www.idee.ro/jewish_heritage_2/targu_neamt.html#C05&lt;/ref&gt;
Although the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] did not directly affect the Jewish population of Târgu Neamț, they were affected by the so-called [[World War II evacuation and expulsion|“population displacements”]]. In 1963 he immigrated with his family to Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Garb, Jonathan (2007). "Moshe Idel." ''Encyclopaedia Judaica''. 2nd ed. Macmillan Reference USA. Retrieved via ''Biography in Context'' database, 2016-12-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Enrolled at the [[Hebrew University]], he studied under [[Gershom Scholem]]. After earning his doctorate with a thesis on [[Abraham Abulafia]], he eventually succeeded [[Gershom Scholem|Scholem]] to the chair of Jewish Thought.  He has served as visiting Professor at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]], [[UCLA]], [[Yale University|Yale]], [[Harvard]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[University of Pennsylvania]] and the [[Collège de France]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nyutikvah.org/fellows/moshe_idel.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Idel has undertaken a systematic revision of the history and analysis of [[Jewish mysticism]]. His explorations of the mythical, theurgical, mystical, and messianic dimensions of Judaism have been attentive to history, sociology, and anthropology, while rejecting a naïve historicist approach to Judaism.&lt;ref name="brill.com"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.brill.com/products/book/moshe-idel|title=Moshe Idel: Representing God|author=|date=6 October 2014|website=brill.com|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His 1988 work, ''Kabbalah: New Perspectives'' ([[Yale University Press]]), is said to have revolutionised [[Kabbalah]] studies.&lt;ref name="Mopsik"&gt;[[Charles Mopsik]], ''Moshé Idel, lauréat du prix Israël'', Association Charles Mopsik, en ligne&lt;/ref&gt; His historical and phenomenological studies of rabbinic, philosophic, kabbalistic, and Hasidic texts have transformed the understanding of Jewish intellectual history and highlighted the close relationship between magic, mysticism, and liturgy.&lt;ref name="brill.com"/&gt;

==Awards==
In 1999, Idel was awarded the [[Israel Prize]] for excellent achievement in the field of Jewish philosophy, and in 2002 the [[The EMET Prize for Art, Science and Culture|EMET Prize]] for Jewish Thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hartman.org.il/Faculty_View.asp?faculty_id=39&amp;Cat_Id=333&amp;Cat_Type=About|title=Faculty - Shalom Hartman Institute|first=Shalom Hartman|last=Institute|date=|website=hartman.org.il|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, he received the [[Koret Jewish Book Award|Koret Award]] for Jewish philosophy for his book ''Absorbing Perfections''.&lt;ref name="idee.ro"/&gt; He has been conferred [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorates]] by the universities of [[Yale University|Yale]],{{cn|date=September 2016}} [[Budapest University|Budapest]],{{cn|date=September 2016}} [[University of Haifa|Haifa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.haifa.ac.il/~focus/2003-autumn/05hondocs.html|title=Focus Newspaper - Autumn 2003|author=|date=|website=research.haifa.ac.il|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Babeș-Bolyai University|Cluj]],{{cn|date=September 2016}} [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza University|Iasi]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.agerpres.ro/english/2010/12/17/professor-moshe-idel-phd-doctor-honoris-causa-of-alexandru-ioan-cuza-university-of-iasi-12-56-17&lt;/ref&gt; and [[University of Bucharest|Bucharest]].{{cn|date=September 2016}}

'''Music''' is an art form and [[culture|cultural]] activity whose medium is sound organized in time. In general [[definitions of music]] will include common elements such as [[pitch (music)|pitch]] (which governs [[melody]] and [[harmony]]), [[rhythm]] (and its associated concepts [[tempo]], [[meter (music)|meter]], and [[articulation (music)|articulation]]), [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]] (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of [[timbre]] and [[texture (music)|texture]] (which are sometimes termed the "color" of a musical sound). Different [[Music genre|styles or types]] of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of [[musical instrument|instruments]] and vocal techniques ranging from singing to [[rapping]]; there are solely [[Instrumental music|instrumental pieces]], [[a capella|solely vocal pieces]] (such as songs without instrumental [[accompaniment]]) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] [[wikt:μουσική#Ancient Greek|μουσική]] (''mousike''; "art of the [[Muse]]s").&lt;ref name="perseus.tufts.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2368891 |title=Mousike, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek–English Lexicon'', at Perseus |publisher=perseus.tufts.edu |accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
See [[glossary of musical terminology]].

In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form or [[Culture|cultural]] activity include the creation of works of music ([[song]]s, tunes, [[symphony|symphonies]], and so on), the [[Music criticism|criticism of music]], the [[Musicology|study of the history of music]], and the [[Aesthetics of music|aesthetic examination of music]]. [[Greek philosophy|Ancient Greek]] and [[Ancient philosophy#Ancient Indian philosophers|Indian philosophers]] defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as "the [[harmony of the spheres]]" and "it is music to my ears" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer [[John Cage]] thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, "There is no [[noise]], only sound."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE1DB1E3BF930A2575BC0A964958260 |title=John Cage, 79, a Minimalist Enchanted With Sound, Dies |last=Kozinn |first=Allen |authorlink=Allan Kozinn |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=13 August 1992 |accessdate=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of music vary according to culture and social context. Indeed, throughout history, some new forms or styles of music have been criticized as "not being music", including [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s ''[[Grosse Fuge]]'' [[string quartet]] in 1825,&lt;ref&gt;Watson 2009, 109–10.&lt;/ref&gt; early [[jazz]] in the beginning of the 1900s&lt;ref&gt;Reiland Rabaka. ''Hip Hop's Amnesia: From Blues and the Black Women's Club Movement to Rap and the [[Hip Hop Movement]]''. Lexington Books, 2012. p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; and [[hardcore punk]] in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Manabe, Noriko. ''The Revolution Will Not Be Televised: Protest Music After Fukushima''. Oxford University Press, 2015. p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; There are many types of music, including [[popular music]], [[traditional music]], [[art music]], [[Liturgical music|music written for religious ceremonies]] and [[work song]]s such as [[chantey]]s. Music ranges from strictly organized compositions–such as Classical music symphonies from the 1700s and 1800s, through to spontaneously played [[Musical improvisation|improvisational music]] such as [[jazz]], and [[avant-garde]] styles of [[aleatory|chance-based]] [[contemporary music]] from the 20th and 21st centuries.

Music can be divided into [[music genre|genres]] (e.g., [[country music]]) and genres can be further divided into [[subgenre]]s (e.g., [[country blues]] and [[pop country]] are two of the many country subgenres), although the dividing lines and relationships between music genres are often subtle, sometimes open to personal interpretation, and occasionally controversial. For example, it can be hard to draw the line between some early 1980s [[hard rock]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. Within [[the arts]], music may be classified as a [[performing arts|performing art]], a fine art or as an auditory art. Music may be played or sung and heard live at a [[rock concert]] or orchestra performance, heard live as part of a [[theatre music|dramatic work]] (a [[music theater]] show or opera), or it may be recorded and listened to on a radio, MP3 player, [[CD player]], [[smartphone]] or as [[film score]] or TV show.

In many cultures, music is an important part of people's way of life, as it plays a key role in  [[religious ritual]]s, [[rite of passage]] ceremonies (e.g., graduation and marriage), social activities (e.g., [[dance club|dancing]]) and cultural activities ranging from amateur [[karaoke]] singing to playing in an amateur [[Funk|funk band]] or singing in a community [[choir]]. People may make music as a hobby, like a teen playing cello in a [[youth orchestra]], or work as a professional musician or singer. The [[music industry]] includes the individuals who create new songs and musical pieces (such as songwriters and composers), individuals who perform music (which include orchestra, [[jazz]] band and rock band musicians, singers and conductors), individuals who record music (music producers and [[sound engineer]]s), individuals who organize concert tours, and individuals who sell recordings and [[sheet music]] and scores to customers.

==Etymology==
[[File:Muses sarcophagus Louvre MR880.jpg|thumb|upright=1.75|In [[Greek mythology]], the nine [[Muse]]s were the inspiration for many creative endeavors, including [[the arts]].]]
The word derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] [[wikt:μουσική#Ancient Greek|μουσική]] (''mousike''; "art of the [[Muses]]").&lt;ref name="perseus.tufts.edu"/&gt; In [[Greek mythology]], the nine [[Muse]]s were the goddesses who inspired literature, science, and [[the arts]] and who were the source of the knowledge embodied in the poetry, song-lyrics, and myths in the Greek culture. According to the ''Online Etymological Dictionary'', the term "music" is derived from "mid-13c., musike, from [[Old French]] ''musique'' (12c.) and directly from [[Latin]] ''musica'' "the art of music," also including poetry (also [the] source of Spanish ''musica'', Italian ''musica'', [[Old High German]] ''mosica'', German ''Musik'', Dutch ''muziek'', Danish ''musik'')." This is derived from the "...Greek ''mousike (techne)'' "(art) of the Muses," from fem. of mousikos "pertaining to the Muses," from Mousa "Muse" (see muse (n.)). Modern spelling [dates] from [the] 1630s. In [[classical Greece]], [the term "music" refers to] any art in which the Muses presided, but especially music and [[lyric poetry]]."&lt;ref name="etymonline"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=music |title=music |publisher=Douglas Harper |website=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a form of art or entertainment==
[[File:Photo récital 028.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.9|{{Interlanguage link multi|Jean-Gabriel Ferlan|fr}} performing at a 2008 concert at the collège-lycée Saint-François Xavier]]
Music is composed and performed for many purposes, ranging from aesthetic pleasure, religious or ceremonial purposes, or as an entertainment product for the marketplace. When music was only available through [[sheet music]] scores, such as during the Classical and Romantic eras, music lovers would buy the [[sheet music]] of their favourite pieces and songs so that they could perform them at home on the piano. With the advent of sound recording, records of popular songs, rather than sheet music became the dominant way that music lovers would enjoy their favourite songs. With the advent of home [[tape recorder]]s in the 1980s and [[digital music]] in the 1990s, music lovers could make tapes or [[playlist]]s of their favourite songs and take them with them on a [[Cassette player|portable cassette player]] or MP3 player. Some music lovers create [[mix tape]]s of their favorite songs, which serve as a "self-portrait, a gesture of friendship, prescription for an ideal party... [and] an environment consisting solely of what is most ardently loved."&lt;ref&gt;Kirszner, Laurie G. (January 2012). ''Patterns for College Writing''.

Amateur musicians can compose or perform music for their own pleasure, and derive their income elsewhere. [[Professional musician]]s are employed by a range of institutions and organisations, including armed forces (in [[marching band]]s, [[concert band]]s and popular music groups), churches and synagogues, symphony orchestras, broadcasting or [[filmmaking|film production]] companies, and [[music school]]s. Professional musicians sometimes work as freelancers or [[session musician]]s, seeking contracts and engagements in a variety of settings. There are often many links between amateur and professional musicians. Beginning amateur musicians take [[music lesson|lessons]] with professional musicians. In community settings, advanced amateur musicians perform with professional musicians in a variety of ensembles such as community [[concert band]]s and community orchestras.

A distinction is often made between music performed for a live audience and music that is performed in a studio so that it can be recorded and distributed through the music retail system or the broadcasting system. However, there are also many cases where a live performance in front of an audience is also recorded and distributed. Live concert recordings are popular in both classical music and in [[popular music]] forms such as rock, where [[Bootleg recording|illegally taped live concerts]] are prized by music lovers. In the [[jam band]] scene, live, improvised [[jam session]]s are preferred to studio recordings.

===Composition===
{{Main|Musical composition}}
[[File:Coffee and synths. KayoDot album "Hubardo" recording, 2013-06-13.jpg|thumb|People composing music in 2013 using [[electronic keyboard]]s and computers.]]
[[File:Michel Richard Delalande engraving BNF Gallica.jpg|thumb|French [[Baroque music]] composer [[Michel Richard Delalande]] (1657–1726), pen in hand.]]
"Composition" is the act or practice of creating a song, an [[instrumental music]] piece, a work with both singing and instruments, or another type of music. In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing also includes the creation of [[music notation]], such as a [[sheet music|sheet music "score"]], which is then performed by the composer or by other singers or musicians. In popular music and traditional music, the act of composing, which is typically called songwriting, may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the [[lead sheet]], which sets out the [[melody]], [[lyrics]] and [[chord progression]]. In classical music, the composer typically [[orchestration|orchestrates]] his or her own compositions, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration. In some cases, a songwriter may not use notation at all, and instead compose the song in her mind and then play or record it from memory. In jazz and popular music, notable recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written scores play in classical music.

Even when music is notated relatively precisely, as in classical music, there are many decisions that a performer has to make, because notation does not specify all of the elements of music precisely. The process of deciding how to perform music that has been previously composed and notated is termed "interpretation". Different performers' interpretations of the same work of music can vary widely, in terms of the tempos that are chosen and the playing or singing style or [[musical phrasing|phrasing]] of the melodies. Composers and songwriters who present their own music are interpreting their songs, just as much as those who perform the music of others. The standard body of choices and techniques present at a given time and a given place is referred to as [[Historically informed performance|performance practice]], whereas interpretation is generally used to mean the individual choices of a performer.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Although a musical composition often uses [[musical notation]] and has a single author, this is not always the case. A work of music can have multiple composers, which often occurs in [[popular music]] when a band collaborates to write a song, or in musical theatre, when one person writes the melodies, a second person writes the lyrics, and a third person orchestrates the songs. In some styles of music, such as the [[blues]], a composer/songwriter may create, perform and record new songs or pieces without ever writing them down in music notation. A piece of music can also be composed with words, images, or computer programs that explain or notate how the singer or musician should create musical sounds. Examples range from avant-garde music that uses [[graphic notation (music)|graphic notation]], to text compositions such as ''[[Aus den sieben Tagen]]'', to computer programs that select sounds for musical pieces. Music that makes heavy use of randomness and chance is called [[aleatoric music]], and is associated with contemporary composers active in the 20th century, such as [[John Cage]], [[Morton Feldman]], and [[Witold Lutosławski]]. A more commonly known example of chance-based music is the sound of [[wind chimes]] jingling in a breeze.

The study of composition has traditionally been dominated by examination of methods and practice of Western classical music, but the definition of composition is broad enough to include the creation of [[popular music]] and [[traditional music]] songs and instrumental pieces as well as spontaneously [[Music improvisation|improvised]] works like those of [[free jazz]] performers and African percussionists such as [[Ewe drumming|Ewe drummers]].

===Notation===
{{Main|Musical notation}}
[[File:Adeste Fideles sheet music sample.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Sheet music is written representation of music. This is a [[homorhythm]]ic (i.e., [[hymn]]-style) arrangement of a traditional piece entitled "[[Adeste Fideles]]", in standard two-staff format for mixed voices. {{audio|Adeste Fideles sheet music sample.mid|Play}}]]
In the 2000s, music notation typically means the written expression of music notes and rhythms on paper using symbols. When music is written down, the pitches and rhythm of the music, such as the notes of a [[melody]], are notated. Music notation also often provides instructions on how to perform the music. For example, the sheet music for a song may state that the song is a "slow blues" or a "fast swing", which indicates the tempo and the genre.  To read music notation, a person must have an understanding of [[music theory]], [[harmony]] and the [[performance practice]] associated with a particular song or piece's genre.

Written notation varies with style and period of music. In the 2000s, notated music is produced as [[sheet music]] or, for individuals with computer [[scorewriter]] programs, as an image on a [[computer screen]]. In ancient times, music notation was put onto stone or clay tablets. To perform music from notation, a singer or instrumentalist requires an understanding of the rhythmic and pitch elements embodied in the symbols and the performance practice that is associated with a piece of music or a genre. In genres requiring [[musical improvisation]], the performer often plays from music where only the [[Chord progression|chord changes]] and form of the song are written, requiring the performer to have a great understanding of the music's structure, harmony and the styles of a particular genre (e.g., [[jazz]] or [[country music]]).

In Western art music, the most common types of written notation are scores, which include all the music parts of an ensemble piece, and parts, which are the music notation for the individual performers or singers. In popular music, jazz, and blues, the standard musical notation is the [[lead sheet]], which notates the melody, chords, [[lyrics]] (if it is a vocal piece), and structure of the music. [[Fake book]]s are also used in jazz; they may consist of lead sheets or simply chord charts, which permit [[rhythm section]] members to improvise an [[accompaniment]] part to jazz songs. Scores and parts are also used in popular music and jazz, particularly in large ensembles such as jazz "[[big band]]s." In popular music, guitarists and electric bass players often read music notated in [[tablature]] (often abbreviated as "tab"), which indicates the location of the notes to be played on the instrument using a diagram of the guitar or bass fingerboard. Tabulature was also used in the Baroque era to notate music for the [[lute]], a stringed, fretted instrument.

===Improvisation===
{{Main|Musical improvisation}}
[[Musical improvisation]] is the creation of spontaneous music, often within (or based on) a pre-existing harmonic framework or chord progression. Improvisation is the act of instantaneous composition by performers, where compositional techniques are employed with or without preparation. Improvisation is a major part of some types of music, such as [[blues]], [[jazz]], and [[jazz fusion]], in which instrumental performers improvise solos, melody lines and accompaniment parts. In the Western art music tradition, improvisation was an important skill during the Baroque era and during the Classical era. In the Baroque era, performers improvised ornaments and [[basso continuo]] keyboard players improvised [[chord voicing]]s based on [[figured bass]] notation. In the Classical era, solo performers and singers improvised virtuoso [[cadenza]]s during concerts. However, in the 20th and early 21st century, as "common practice" Western [[art music]] performance became institutionalized in symphony orchestras, opera houses and ballets, improvisation has played a smaller role. At the same time, some modern composers have increasingly included improvisation in their creative work. In [[Indian classical music]], improvisation is a core component and an essential criterion of performances.

===Theory===
{{Main|Music theory}}
Music theory encompasses the nature and mechanics of music. It often involves identifying patterns that govern composers' techniques and examining the [[language]] and [[Musical notation|notation]] of music. In a grand sense, music theory distills and analyzes the [[parameter (music)|parameters]] or elements of music – rhythm, [[harmony]] ([[Diatonic function|harmonic function]]), [[melody]], structure, [[Musical form|form]], and [[Texture (music)|texture]]. Broadly, music theory may include any statement, belief, or conception of or about music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Boretz |first=Benjamin |authorlink=Benjamin Boretz |title=Meta-Variations: studies in the foundations of musical thought… |publisher=Open Space |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who study these properties are known as music theorists. Some have applied [[acoustics]], [[human physiology]], and [[psychology]] to the explanation of how and why music is [[perceive]]d.

==Elements==
{{main|Aspect of music}}
Music has many different fundamentals or elements. Depending on the definition of "element" being used, these can include: pitch, beat or pulse, tempo, rhythm, melody, harmony, texture, style, allocation of voices, timbre or color, dynamics, expression, articulation, form and structure. The elements of music feature prominently in the music curriculums of Australia, UK and US. All three curriculums identify pitch, dynamics, timbre and texture as elements, but the other identified elements of music are far from universally agreed. Below is a list of the three official versions of the "elements of music":

In relation to the UK curriculum, in 2013 the term: "appropriate [[musical notation]]s" was added to their list of elements and the title of the list was changed from the "elements of music" to the "inter-related dimensions of music". The inter-related dimensions of music are listed as: pitch, duration, dynamics, tempo, timbre, texture, structure and appropriate musical notations.&lt;ref&gt;Gov.uk. (2013). ''National curriculum in England: music programmes of study''. Retrieved 6 January 2016, from https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-music-programmes-of-study&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "the elements of music" is used in a number of different contexts. The two most common contexts can be differentiated by describing them as the "rudimentary elements of music" and the "perceptual elements of music".

===Rudimentary elements===
In the 1800s, the phrases "the elements of music" and "the rudiments of music" were used interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;Clementi, M. (1974). Introduction to the art of playing on the piano forte: Da Capo Pr. Cohen, D., &amp; Dubnov, S. (1997). [[Gestalt phenomena]] in musical texture: Springer&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Niecks, F. (1884). A concise dictionary of musical terms. The Musical Times and Singing Class Circular, 25(498), 473. doi: 10.2307/3357513&lt;/ref&gt;  The elements described in these documents refer to aspects of music that are needed in order to become a musician, Recent writers such as Estrella &lt;ref&gt;Estrella, E. (2015). The Elements of music. Retrieved 15 Jan. 2015, 2015, from http://musiced.about.com/od/beginnerstheory/a/musicelements.htm&lt;/ref&gt; seem to be using the phrase "elements of music" in a similar manner. A definition which most accurately reflects this usage is: "the rudimentary principles of an art, science, etc.: the elements of grammar."&lt;ref&gt;Element. (n.d.). In Dictionary.com unabridged.   Retrieved 10 Jun 2015, from  http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/element&lt;/ref&gt; The UK's curriculum switch to the "inter-related dimensions of music" seems to be a move back to using the rudimentary elements of music.

===Perceptual elements===
Since the emergence of the study of [[psychoacoustics]] in the 1930s, most lists of elements of music have related more to how we ''hear'' music than how we learn to play it or study it. C.E. Seashore, in his book ''Psychology of Music'',&lt;ref&gt;Seashore, C. E. (1938). ''Psychology of music'': New York: Dover Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; identified four "psychological attributes of sound". These were: "pitch, loudness, time, and timbre" (p.&amp;nbsp;3). He did not call them the "elements of music" but referred to them as "elemental components" (p.&amp;nbsp;2). Nonetheless these elemental components link precisely with four of the most common musical elements: "Pitch" and "timbre" match exactly, "loudness" links with dynamics and "time" links with the time-based elements of rhythm, duration and tempo. This usage of the phrase "the elements of music" links more closely with ''Webster's New 20th Century Dictionary'' definition of an element as: "a substance which cannot be divided into a simpler form by known methods"&lt;ref&gt;Webster, N. (Ed.) (1947) Webster's New Twentieth Century Dictionary. Clevelend Ohio: The World Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt; and educational institutions' lists of elements generally align with this definition as well.

Although writers of lists of "rudimentary elements of music" can vary their lists depending on their personal (or institutional) priorities, the perceptual elements of music should consist of an established (or proven) list of discrete elements which can be independently manipulated to achieve an intended musical effect. It seems at this stage that there is still research to be done in this area.

===Analysis of styles===
[[File:George Clinton 2006.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Funk]] places most of its emphasis on rhythm and [[groove (music)|groove]], with entire songs based around a [[ostinato#Vamp|vamp]] on a single chord. Pictured are the influential funk musicians [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]] and [[Parliament Funkadelic]] in 2006.]]
Some styles of music place an emphasis on certain of these fundamentals, while others place less emphasis on certain elements. To give one example, while [[Bebop]]-era [[jazz]] makes use of very complex chords, including [[altered dominant]]s and challenging [[chord progression]]s, with chords changing two or more times per bar and keys changing several times in a tune, [[funk]] places most of its emphasis on rhythm and [[groove (music)|groove]], with entire songs based around a [[ostinato#Vamp|vamp]] on a single chord. While Romantic era classical music from the mid- to late-1800s makes great use of dramatic changes of dynamics, from whispering pianissimo sections to thunderous fortissimo sections, some entire Baroque dance suites for [[harpsichord]] from the early 1700s may use a single dynamic. To give another example, while some [[art music]] pieces, such as [[symphony|symphonies]] are very long, some pop songs are just a few minutes long.

===Description of elements===

====Pitch and melody====
[[Pitch (music)|Pitch]] is an aspect of a sound that we can hear, reflecting whether one musical sound, note or tone is "higher" or "lower" than another musical sound, note or tone. We can talk about the highness or lowness of pitch in the more general sense, such as the way a listener hears a piercingly high [[piccolo]] note or [[whistling]] tone as higher in pitch than a deep thump of a [[bass drum]]. We also talk about pitch in the precise sense associated with musical [[melody|melodies]], [[bassline]]s and [[chord (music)|chords]]. Precise pitch can only be determined in sounds that have a frequency that is clear and stable enough to distinguish from noise. For example, it is much easier for listeners to discern the pitch of a single note played on a piano  than to try to discern the pitch of a [[crash cymbal]] that is struck.
[[File:Popgoesweasel.jpg|thumb|upright=2.5|The melody to the traditional song "[[Pop Goes the Weasel]]"  {{audio|Pop Goes the Weasel.ogg|Play}}]]

A [[melody]] (also called a "tune") is a series of pitches (notes) sounding in succession (one after the other), often in a rising and falling pattern. The notes of a melody are typically created using pitch systems such as [[Musical scale|scales]] or [[Musical mode|modes]]. Melodies also often contain notes from the chords used in the song. The melodies in simple folk songs and traditional songs may use only the notes of a single scale, the scale associated with the tonic note or [[key (music)|key]] of a given song. For example, a folk song in the key of C (also referred to as C major) may have a melody that uses only the notes of the C major scale (the individual notes C, D, E, F, G, A, B and C; these are the "[[white notes]]" on a piano keyboard. On the other hand, [[Bebop]]-era jazz from the 1940s and [[contemporary music]] from the 20th and 21st centuries may use melodies with many [[chromatic note]]s (i.e., notes in addition to the notes of the major scale; on a piano, a chromatic scale would include all the notes on the keyboard, including the "white notes" and "black notes" and unusual scales, such as the [[whole tone scale]] (a whole tone scale in the key of C would contain the notes C, D, E, F{{music|sharp}}, G{{music|sharp}} and A{{music|sharp}}). A low, deep musical line played by bass instruments such as double bass, electric bass or [[tuba]] is called a [[bassline]].

====Harmony and chords====
[[File:Sol7 accordo chitarra G7 guitar chord.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|When musicians play three or more different [[Musical note|notes]] at the same time, this creates a [[Chord (music)|chord]]. In [[Western culture#Music|Western music]], including classical music, pop music, rock music and many related styles, the most common chords are [[triad (music)|triads]]– three notes usually played at the same time. The most commonly used chords are the [[major chord]] and the [[minor chord]]. An example of a major chord is the three pitches C, E and G. An example of a minor chord is the three pitches A, C and E. (Pictured is a [[guitar player]] performing a chord on a guitar).]]
[[Harmony]] refers to the "vertical" sounds of pitches in music, which means pitches that are played or sung together at the same time to create a [[chord (music)|chord]]. Usually this means the notes are played at the same time, although harmony may also be implied by a melody that outlines a harmonic structure (i.e., by using melody notes that are played one after the other, outlining the notes of a chord). In music written using the system of major-minor [[tonality]] ("keys"), which includes most classical music written from 1600 to 1900 and most Western pop, rock and traditional music, the key of a piece determines the scale used, which centres around the "home note" or [[tonic (music)|tonic]] of the key. Simple classical pieces and many pop and traditional music songs are written so that all the music is in a single key. More complex Classical, pop and traditional music songs and pieces may have two keys (and in some cases three or more keys). Classical music from the Romantic era (written from about 1820–1900) often contains multiple keys, as does [[jazz]], especially [[Bebop]] jazz from the 1940s, in which the key or "home note" of a song may change every four bars or even every two bars.

====Rhythm====
Rhythm is the arrangement of sounds and silences in time. [[Metre (music)|Meter]] animates time in regular pulse groupings, called [[Bar (music)|measures or bars]], which in Western classical, popular and traditional music often group notes in sets of two (e.g., 2/4 time), three (e.g., 3/4 time, also known as [[Waltz]] time, or 3/8 time), or four (e.g., 4/4 time). Meters are made easier to hear because songs and pieces often (but not always) place an emphasis on the first beat of each grouping. Notable exceptions exist, such as the [[backbeat]] used in much Western pop and rock, in which a song that uses a measure that consists of four beats (called 4/4 time or [[common time]]) will have accents on beats two and four, which are typically performed by the drummer on the [[snare drum]], a loud and distinctive-sounding percussion instrument. In pop and rock, the rhythm parts of a song are played by the [[rhythm section]], which includes chord-playing instruments (e.g., electric guitar, acoustic guitar, piano, or other keyboard instruments), a bass instrument (typically electric bass or for some styles such as [[jazz]] and [[bluegrass (music)|bluegrass]], double bass) and a drum kit player.

====Texture====
[[Musical texture]] is the overall sound of a piece of music or song.  The texture of a piece or sing is determined by how the melodic, rhythmic, and harmonic materials are combined in a composition, thus determining the overall nature of the sound in a piece. Texture is often described in regard to the density, or thickness, and range, or width, between lowest and highest pitches, in relative terms as well as more specifically distinguished according to the number of voices, or parts, and the relationship between these voices (see common types below). For example, a thick texture contains many 'layers' of instruments. One of these layers could be a string section, or another brass. The thickness also is affected by the amount and the richness of the instruments. Texture is commonly described according to the number of and relationship between [[part (music)|parts]] or lines of music:
* [[monophony]]: a single [[melody]] (or "tune") with neither instrumental [[accompaniment]] nor a [[harmony part]]. A mother singing a [[lullaby]] to her baby would be an example.
* [[heterophony]]: two or more instruments or singers playing/singing the same melody, but with each performer slightly varying the rhythm or speed of the melody or adding different [[ornament (music)|ornaments]] to the melody. Two [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] [[fiddler]]s playing the same [[traditional music|traditional]] fiddle tune together will typically each vary the melody a bit and each add different ornaments.
* [[polyphony]]: multiple independent melody lines that interweave together, which are sung or played at the same time. [[Choir|Choral]] music written in the [[Renaissance music]] era was typically written in this style. A [[round (music)|round]], which is a song such as "[[Row, Row, Row Your Boat]]", which different groups of singers all start to sing at a different time, is a simple example of polyphony.
* [[homophony]]: a clear melody supported by [[chord (music)|chordal]] [[accompaniment]]. Most Western [[popular music]] songs from the 19th century onward are written in this texture.

Music that contains a large number of independent [[Part (music)|parts]] (e.g., a double concerto accompanied by 100 orchestral instruments with many interweaving melodic lines) is generally said to have a "thicker" or "denser" texture than a work with few parts (e.g., a solo [[flute]] melody accompanied by a single cello).

====Timbre or "tone color"====
Timbre, sometimes called "color" or "tone color" is the quality or sound of a voice or instrument.&lt;ref&gt;Harnsberger, Lindsey. "Articulation." ''Essential Dictionary of Music''. Alfred Publishing Co., Inc. Los Angeles, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; Timbre is what makes a particular musical sound different from another, even when they have the same pitch and loudness. For example, a 440&amp;nbsp;Hz A note sounds different when it is played on [[oboe]], piano, violin or electric guitar. Even if different players of the same instrument play the same note, their notes might sound different due to differences in instrumental technique (e.g., different [[embouchure]]s), different types of accessories (e.g., mouthpieces for brass players, reeds for oboe and bassoon players) or strings made out of different materials for string players (e.g., [[gut string]]s versus [[steel strings]]). Even two instrumentalists playing the same note on the same instrument (one after the other) may sound different due to different ways of playing the instrument (e.g., two string players might hold the bow differently).

The physical characteristics of sound that determine the perception of timbre include the [[spectrum]], [[envelope (waves)|envelope]] and [[overtone]]s of a note or musical sound. For [[music technology (electric)|electric]] instruments developed in the 20th century, such as electric guitar, electric bass and [[electric piano]], the performer can also change the tone by adjusting [[Graphic equalizer|equalizer controls]], tone controls on the instrument, and by using [[effects unit|electronic effects units]] such as [[distortion (music)|distortion]] pedals. The tone of the electric [[Hammond organ]] is controlled by adjusting [[Hammond organ#Drawbars|drawbars]].

====Expression====
[[File:20110921-FSIS-RBN-6084 - Flickr - USDAgov.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|Singers add expression to the melodies they sing using many methods, including changing the tone of their singing, adding [[vibrato]] to certain notes, and emphasizing important words in the lyrics.]]
Expressive qualities are those elements in music that create change in music without changing the main pitches or substantially changing the rhythms of the melody and its accompaniment. Performers, including singers and instrumentalists, can add musical expression to a song or piece by adding [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]], by adding effects such as [[vibrato]] (with voice and some instruments, such as guitar, violin, brass instruments and woodwinds), dynamics (the loudness or softness of piece or a section of it), tempo fluctuations (e.g., [[ritardando]] or [[Tempo|accelerando]], which are, respectively slowing down and speeding up the tempo), by adding pauses or [[fermata]]s on a [[cadence (music)|cadence]], and by changing the articulation of the notes (e.g., making notes more pronounced or accented, by making notes more [[legato]], which means smoothly connected, or by making notes shorter).

Expression is achieved through the manipulation of pitch (such as inflection, vibrato, slides etc.), volume (dynamics, accent, tremolo etc.), duration (tempo fluctuations, rhythmic changes, changing note duration such as with legato and staccato,  etc.), timbre (e.g. changing vocal timbre from a light to a resonant voice) and sometimes even texture (e.g. doubling the bass note for a richer effect in a piano piece). Expression therefore can be seen as a manipulation of all elements in order to convey "an indication of mood, spirit, character etc." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=the definition of expression |url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/expression |website=Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.com |accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as such cannot be included as a unique perceptual element of music,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Burton |first1=Russell |title=The elements of music: What are they, and who cares? |journal=Educating for Life. ASME XXth National Conference Proceeding. Australian Society for Music Education. |date=2015 |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it can be considered an important rudimentary element of music.

====Form====

In music, [[Musical form|form]] describes how  the overall structure or plan of a song or piece of music,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Schmidt-Jones |first=Catherine |title=Form in Music |url=http://cnx.org/content/m10842/2.14/ |website=Connexions |accessdate=11 September 2011 |date=11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it describes the layout of a composition as divided into sections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Brandt |first=Anthony |title=Musical Form |url=http://cnx.org/content/m11629/1.13/ |publisher=Connexions |accessdate=11 September 2011 |date=11 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century, [[Tin Pan Alley]] songs and [[Musical theatre|Broadway musical]] songs were often in [[AABA form|AABA]] [[32 bar form]], in which the A sections repeated the same eight bar melody and the B section provided a contrasting melody and/or harmony for 8 bars. From the 1960s onward, Western pop and rock songs are often in [[verse-chorus form]], which is based around a sequence of [[verse (popular music)|verse]] and [[chorus (song)|chorus]] ("refrain") sections, with new [[lyrics]] for most verses and repeating lyrics for the choruses. Popular music often makes use of [[strophic form]], sometimes in conjunction with the [[twelve bar blues]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

In the tenth edition of ''[[The Oxford Companion to Music]]'', [[Percy Scholes]] defines musical form as "a series of strategies designed to find a successful mean between the opposite extremes of unrelieved repetition and unrelieved alteration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Scholes |first=Percy A. |authorlink1=Percy Scholes |title=The Oxford Companion to Music |edition=10 |year=1977 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location= |isbn= |chapter=Form |ref=CITEREFScholes1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of common forms of Western music include the [[fugue]], the [[Invention (musical composition)|invention]], [[Sonata form|sonata-allegro]], [[Canon (music)|canon]], [[strophic]], [[theme and variations]], and [[rondo]].
Scholes states that European classical music had only six stand-alone forms: simple binary, simple ternary, compound binary, rondo, air with variations, and [[fugue]] (although musicologist [[Alfred Mann (musicologist)|Alfred Mann]] emphasized that the fugue is primarily a method of composition that has sometimes taken on certain structural conventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mann |first=Alfred |title=The Study of Fugue |year=1958 |publisher=W.W.Norton and Co. Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Where a piece cannot readily be broken down into sectional units (though it might borrow some form from a poem, story or [[Programme music|programme]]), it is said to be [[through-composed]]. Such is often the case with a [[Fantasia (music)|fantasia]], [[Prelude (music)|prelude]], [[Rhapsody (music)|rhapsody]], [[etude]] (or study), [[symphonic poem]], [[Bagatelle (music)|Bagatelle]], [[impromptu]], etc.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Professor Charles Keil classified forms and formal detail as "sectional, developmental, or variational."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Keil |first=Charles |title=Urban blues |year=1966 |isbn=978-0-226-42960-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Sectional form
This form is built from a sequence of clear-cut units&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wennerstrom |first=Mary |editor=Wittlich, Gary |title=Aspects of Twentieth-Century Music |year=1975 |publisher=Prentice-Hall |location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey |isbn=978-0-13-049346-0 |chapter=Form in Twentieth Century Music |ref=CITEREFDeLone1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; that may be referred to by letters but also often have generic names such as [[Introduction (music)|introduction]] and [[Coda (music)|coda]], exposition, development and [[recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]], verse, chorus or [[refrain]], and [[Bridge (music)|bridge]]. Introductions and codas, when they are no more than that, are frequently excluded from formal analysis. All such units may typically be eight measures long. Sectional forms include:

;Strophic form
This form is defined by its "unrelieved repetition" ('''AAAA'''...).

;Medley

[[Medley (music)|Medley]], [[Potpourri (music)|potpourri]] is the extreme opposite, that of "unrelieved variation": it is simply an indefinite sequence of self-contained sections ('''ABCD'''...), sometimes with repeats ('''AABBCCDD'''...).  Examples include orchestral [[overture]]s, which are sometimes no more than a string of the best tunes of the musical theatre show or opera to come.

;Binary form
[[File:Binary form.png|thumb|Binary form in major and minor keys. Each section must be at least three phrases long.&lt;ref&gt;White, John D. (1976). ''The Analysis of Music'', p. 50. {{ISBN|0-13-033233-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

This form uses two sections ('''AB'''...), each often repeated ('''AABB'''...). In 18th-century Western classical music, "simple binary" form was often used for dances and carried with it the convention that the two sections should be in different [[musical key]]s but same rhythm, duration and tone. The alternation of two tunes gives enough variety to permit a dance to be extended for as long as desired.
b
;Ternary form
This form has three parts. In Western classical music a simple ternary form has a third section that is a recapitulation of the first ('''ABA'''). Often, the first section is repeated ('''AABA'''). This approach was popular in the 18th-century operatic [[aria]],{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} and was called ''[[da capo]]'' (i.e. "repeat from the top") form. Later, it gave rise to the [[thirty-two-bar form|32-bar song]], with the '''B''' section then often referred to as the "middle eight". A song has more need than a dance of a self-contained form with a beginning and an end of course.

;Rondo form
This form has a recurring theme alternating with different (usually contrasting) sections called "episodes". It may be asymmetrical ('''ABACADAEA''') or symmetrical ('''ABACABA'''). A recurring section, especially the main theme, is sometimes more thoroughly varied, or else one episode may be a "development" of it. A similar arrangement is the [[ritornello]] form of the Baroque [[concerto grosso]]. [[Arch form]] ('''ABCBA''') resembles a symmetrical rondo without intermediate repetitions of the main theme. It is normally used in a round.

;Variational form
Variational forms are those in which variation is an important formative element.

'''[[Theme and Variations]]:''' a [[theme (music)|theme]], which in itself can be of any shorter form (binary, ternary, etc.), forms the only "section" and is repeated indefinitely (as in strophic form) but is varied each time (A, B, A, F, Z, A), so as to make a sort of sectional chain form. An important variant of this, much used in 17th-century British music and in the [[Passacaglia]] and [[Chaconne]], was that of the [[ground bass]] – a repeating bass theme or ''basso [[ostinato]]'' over and around which the rest of the structure unfolds, often, but not always, spinning [[polyphony|polyphonic]] or [[counterpoint|contrapuntal]] threads, or improvising [[division (music)|divisions]] and [[descant]]s. This is said by Scholes (1977) to be the form ''par excellence'' of unaccompanied or accompanied solo instrumental music. The [[Rondo]] is often found with sections varied ('''AA&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;BA&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;CA&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;BA&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;''') or ('''ABA&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;CA&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;B&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;A''').

;Developmental form
Developmental forms are built directly from smaller units, such as [[motif (music)|motifs]]. A well-known Classical piece with a motif is [[Beethoven's fifth symphony]], which starts with three short repeated notes and then a long note. In Classical pieces that are based on motifs, the motif is usually combined, varied and worked out in different ways, perhaps having a symmetrical or arch-like underpinning and a progressive development from beginning to end. By far the most important developmental form in Western classical music is [[Sonata form]].
This form, also known as ''sonata'' form, first movement form, compound binary, ternary and a variety of other names,{{Such as?|Sep2011}} developed from the binary-formed dance movement described above but is almost always cast in a greater ternary form having the nominal subdivisions of ''Exposition, Development'' and ''Recapitulation''. Usually, but not always, the "A" parts ([[Exposition (music)|Exposition]] and [[Recapitulation (music)|Recapitulation]], respectively) may be subdivided into two or three [[theme (music)|themes]] or theme groups which are taken asunder and recombined to form the "B" part (the [[musical development|development]]) – thus e. g. (AabB[dev. of a and/or b]A&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;ab&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;+coda). This developmental form is generally confined to certain sections of the piece, as to the middle section of the first movement of a sonata, though 19th-century composers such as Berlioz, Liszt and Wagner made valiant efforts to derive large-scale works purely or mainly from the motif.

Music and theatre scholars studying the history and anthropology of [[Semitic people|Semitic]] and early [[Judeo-Christian]] culture have discovered common links in theatrical and musical activity between the classical cultures of the [[Hebrews]] and those of later [[Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. The common area of performance is found in a "social phenomenon called [[litany]]," a form of prayer consisting of a series of [[invocation]]s or [[supplication]]s. ''The Journal of Religion and Theatre'' notes that among the earliest forms of litany, "Hebrew litany was accompanied by a rich musical tradition:"&lt;ref name=JRT&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061004134128/http://www.rtjournal.org/vol_5/no_1/krahenbuhl.html "A Theatre Before the World: Performance History at the Intersection of Hebrew, Greek, and Roman Religious Processional"] ''The Journal of Religion and Theatre'', Vol. 5, No. 1, Summer 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"While Genesis 4.21 identifies Jubal as the "father of all such as handle the harp and pipe," the Pentateuch is nearly silent about the practice and instruction of music in the early life of Israel. Then, in I Samuel 10 and the texts that follow, a curious thing happens. "One finds in the biblical text," writes Alfred Sendrey, "a sudden and unexplained upsurge of large choirs and orchestras, consisting of thoroughly organized and trained musical groups, which would be virtually inconceivable without lengthy, methodical preparation." This has led some scholars to believe that the prophet Samuel was the patriarch of a school, which taught not only prophets and holy men, but also sacred-rite musicians. This public music school, perhaps the earliest in recorded history, was not restricted to a priestly class—which is how the shepherd boy David appears on the scene as a minstrel to King Saul."&lt;ref name=JRT/&gt;

The [[Medieval Music|medieval]] era (476 to 1400), which took place during the [[Middle Ages]], started with the introduction of [[monophony|monophonic]] (single melodic line) [[Gregorian chant|chanting]] into [[Roman Catholic Church]] services. [[Musical notation]] was used since Ancient times in [[Ancient Greece|Greek culture]], but in the Middle Ages, notation was first introduced by the [[Catholic church]] so that the chant melodies could be written down, to facilitate the use of the same melodies for religious music across the entire Catholic empire. The only European Medieval repertory that has been found in written form from before 800 is the [[monophony|monophonic]] [[Liturgy|liturgical]] [[plainsong]] chant of the Roman Catholic Church, the central tradition of which was called [[Gregorian chant]].&lt;!--+Add refs to others, e.g. Gallican, Mozarabic, &amp;c.?--&gt; Alongside these traditions of [[Religious music|sacred]] and [[church music]] there existed a vibrant tradition of [[Secular music|secular song]] (non-religious songs). Examples of composers from this period are [[Léonin]], [[Pérotin]], [[Guillaume de Machaut]], and [[Walther von der Vogelweide]].

[[File:Filippino Lippi 001.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|right|Allegory of Music, by [[Filippino Lippi]]]]
[[Renaissance music]] (c. 1400 to 1600) was more focused on secular (non-religious) themes, such as [[courtly love]]. Around 1450, the [[printing press]] was invented, which made printed [[sheet music]] much less expensive and easier to mass-produce (prior to the invention of the printing press, all notated music was hand-copied). The increased availability of sheet music helped to spread musical styles more quickly and across a larger area. Musicians and singers often worked for the church, courts and towns. Church choirs grew in size, and the church remained an important patron of music. By the middle of the 15th century, composers wrote richly polyphonic sacred music, in which different melody lines were interwoven simultaneously. Prominent composers from this era include [[Guillaume Dufay]], [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]], [[Thomas Morley]], and [[Orlande de Lassus]]. As musical activity shifted from the church to the aristocratic courts, kings, queens and princes competed for the finest composers. Many leading important composers came from the Netherlands, Belgium, and northern France. They are called the Franco-Flemish composers. They held important positions throughout Europe, especially in Italy. Other countries with vibrant musical activity included Germany, England, and Spain.

The [[Baroque music|Baroque era of music]] took place from 1600 to 1750, as the [[Baroque|Baroque artistic style]] flourished across Europe; and during this time, music expanded in its range and complexity. Baroque music began when the first operas (dramatic solo vocal music accompanied by orchestra) were written. During the Baroque era, [[polyphony|polyphonic]] [[Counterpoint|contrapuntal]] music, in which multiple, simultaneous independent melody lines were used, remained important (counterpoint was important in the vocal music of the Medieval era). German Baroque composers wrote for small [[Musical ensemble|ensembles]] including [[String section|strings]], [[Brass instrument|brass]], and [[Woodwind instrument|woodwinds]], as well as for [[choir]]s and keyboard instruments such as [[organ (music)|pipe organ]], [[harpsichord]], and [[clavichord]]. During this period several major music forms were defined that lasted into later periods when they were expanded and evolved further, including the [[fugue]], the [[Invention (musical composition)|invention]], the [[sonata]], and the concerto.&lt;ref name="sdsu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://trumpet.sdsu.edu/M345/Baroque_Music1.html |title=''Baroque Music'' by Elaine Thornburgh and Jack Logan, Ph.D |publisher=trumpet.sdsu.edu |accessdate=27 October 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905175129/http://trumpet.sdsu.edu/M345/Baroque_Music1.html |archivedate=5 September 2015 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The late Baroque style was polyphonically complex and richly ornamented.

The music of the [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]] (1730 to 1820) aimed to imitate what were seen as the key elements of the art and philosophy of Ancient Greece and Rome: the ideals of balance, proportion and disciplined expression. (Note: the music from the [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]] should not be confused with Classical music in general, a term which refers to Western [[art music]] from the 5th century to the 2000s, which includes the Classical period as one of a number of periods).  Music from the Classical period has a lighter, clearer and considerably simpler texture than the [[Baroque music]] which preceded it. The main style was [[homophony]],&lt;ref&gt;Blume, Friedrich. Classic and Romantic Music: A Comprehensive Survey. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 1970. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; where a prominent [[melody]] and a subordinate chordal [[accompaniment]] part are clearly distinct. Classical instrumental melodies tended to be almost voicelike and singable. New genres were developed, and the [[fortepiano]], the forerunner to the modern piano, replaced the Baroque era [[harpsichord]] and [[pipe organ]] as the main keyboard instrument.

Importance was given to [[instrumental]] music. It was dominated by further development of musical forms initially defined in the Baroque period: the [[sonata]], the concerto, and the [[symphony]]. Others main kinds were the [[Trio (music)|trio]], [[string quartet]], [[serenade]] and [[divertimento]]. The sonata was the most important and developed form. Although Baroque composers also wrote sonatas, the Classical style of sonata is completely distinct. All of the main instrumental forms of the Classical era, from string quartets to symphonies and concertos, were based on the structure of the sonata. The instruments used [[chamber music]] and orchestra became more standardized. In place of the [[basso continuo]] group of the Baroque era, which consisted of harpsichord, organ or lute along with a number of bass instruments selected at the discretion of the group leader (e.g., viol, cello, theorbo, serpent), Classical chamber groups used specified, standardized instruments (e.g., a [[string quartet]] would be performed by two violins, a viola and a cello). The Baroque era improvised chord-playing of the continuo keyboardist or lute player was gradually phased out between 1750 and 1800.

One of the most important changes made in the Classical period was the development of public concerts. The aristocracy still played a significant role in the sponsorship of concerts and compositions, but it was now possible for composers to survive without being  permanent employees of queens or princes. The increasing popularity of classical music led to a growth in the number and types of orchestras. The expansion of orchestral concerts necessitated the building of large public performance spaces. Symphonic music including symphonies, musical accompaniment to ballet and mixed vocal/instrumental genres such as opera and [[oratorio]] became more popular.

The best known composers of Classicism are [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]], [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]], [[Johann Christian Bach]], [[Joseph Haydn]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Franz Schubert]]. Beethoven and Schubert are also considered to be composers in the later part of the Classical era, as it began to move towards Romanticism.

===Romanticism===

[[Romantic music]] (c. 1810 to 1900) from the 19th century had many elements in common with the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] styles in literature and painting of the era. Romanticism was an artistic, literary, and intellectual movement was characterized by its emphasis on emotion and individualism as well as glorification of all the past and nature. Romantic music expanded beyond the rigid styles and forms of the Classical era into more passionate, dramatic expressive pieces and songs. Romantic composers such as [[Wagner]] and [[Brahms]] attempted to increase emotional expression and power in their music to describe deeper truths or human feelings. With symphonic [[tone poem]]s, composers tried to tell stories and evoke images or landscapes using instrumental music. Some composers promoted [[Nationalism|nationalistic]] pride with patriotic orchestral music inspired by [[folk music]]. The emotional and expressive qualities of music came to take precedence over tradition.

Romantic composers grew in idiosyncrasy, and went further in the [[syncretism]] of exploring different art-forms in a musical context, (such as literature), history (historical figures and legends), or nature itself. [[Romantic love]] or longing was a prevalent theme in many works composed during this period. In some cases the formal structures from the classical period continued to be used (e.g., the [[sonata form]] used in [[string quartet]]s and [[symphony|symphonies]]), but these forms were expanded and altered. In many cases, new approaches were explored for existing genres, forms, and functions. Also, new forms were created that were deemed better suited to the new subject matter. Composers continued to develop opera and ballet music, exploring new styles and themes.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

In the years after 1800, the music developed by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Franz Schubert]] introduced a more dramatic, expressive style. In Beethoven's case, short [[motif (music)|motifs]], developed organically, came to replace [[melody]] as the most significant compositional unit (an example is the distinctive four note figure used in his [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth Symphony]]). Later Romantic composers such as [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], [[Antonín Dvořák]], and [[Gustav Mahler]] used more unusual [[chord (music)|chords]] and more [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]] to create dramatic tension. They generated complex and often much longer musical works. During the late Romantic period, composers explored dramatic [[Chromatic (music)|chromatic]] alterations of [[tonality]], such as [[extended chord]]s and [[altered chord]]s, which created new sound "colours". The late 19th century saw a dramatic expansion in the size of the orchestra, and the [[industrial revolution]] helped to create better instruments, creating a more powerful sound. Public concerts became an important part of well-to-do [[urban culture|urban]] society. It also saw a new diversity in [[theatre music]], including [[operetta]], and [[Edwardian musical comedy|musical comedy]] and other forms of musical theatre.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

===20th and 21st century music===
{{Main|20th-century music}}

In the 19th century, one of the key ways that new compositions became known to the public was by the sales of [[sheet music]], which middle class amateur music lovers would perform at home on their piano or other common instruments, such as violin. With [[20th-century music]], the invention of new [[music technology (electric)|electric technologies]] such as [[radio broadcasting]] and the [[mass market]] availability of [[gramophone record]]s meant that [[sound recording]]s of songs and pieces heard by listeners (either on the radio or on their record player) became the main way to learn about new songs and pieces. There was a vast increase in music listening as the radio gained popularity and [[phonograph]]s were used to replay and distribute music, because whereas in the 19th century, the focus on sheet music restricted access to new music to the middle class and upper-class people who could read music and who owned pianos and instruments, in the 20th century, anyone with a radio or record player could hear operas, [[symphony|symphonies]] and [[big band]]s right in their own living room. This allowed lower-income people, who would never be able to afford an opera or symphony concert ticket to hear this music. It also meant that people could hear music from different parts of the country, or even different parts of the world, even if they could not afford to travel to these locations. This helped to spread musical styles.

The focus of [[art music]] in the 20th century was characterized by exploration of new rhythms, styles, and sounds. The horrors of [[World War I]] influenced many of the arts, including music, and some composers began exploring darker, harsher sounds. [[Traditional music]] styles such as [[jazz]] and [[folk music]] were used by composers as a source of ideas for classical music. [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]], and [[John Cage]] were all influential composers in 20th-century art music. The invention of [[sound recording]] and the ability to edit music gave rise to new subgenre of classical music, including the [[acousmatic]]&lt;ref&gt;Schaeffer, P. (1966), Traité des objets musicaux, Le Seuil, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Musique concrète]] schools of electronic composition. Sound recording was also a major influence on the development of popular music genres, because it enabled recordings of songs and bands to be widely distributed. The introduction of the [[multitrack recording]] system had a major influence on rock music, because it could do much more than record a band's performance. Using a multitrack system, a band and their music producer could overdub many layers of instrument tracks and vocals, creating new sounds that would not be possible in a live performance.

[[Jazz]] evolved and became an important genre of music over the course of the 20th century, and during the second half of that century, rock music did the same. Jazz is an American musical artform that originated in the beginning of the 20th century in African American communities in the Southern United States from a confluence of [[Music of Africa|African]] and European music traditions. The style's West African pedigree is evident in its use of [[blue note]]s, [[improvisation]], [[polyrhythm]]s, [[syncopation]], and the [[swung note]].&lt;ref&gt;Alyn Shipton, ''A New History of Jazz'', 2nd. ed., Continuum, 2007, pp. 4–5&lt;/ref&gt;

Rock music is a genre of [[popular music]] that developed in the 1960s from 1950s [[rock and roll]], [[rockabilly]], [[blues]], and [[country music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19838/m1/ |title=Show 55 – Crammer: A lively cram course on the history of rock and some other things |show=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sound of rock often revolves around the electric guitar or acoustic guitar, and it uses a strong [[Backbeat (music)|back beat]] laid down by a [[rhythm section]] of electric bass guitar, drums, and keyboard instruments such as organ, piano, or, since the 1970s, [[analog synthesizer]]s and digital ones and computers since the 1990s. Along with the guitar or keyboards, saxophone and blues-style harmonica are used as soloing instruments. In its "purest form," it "has three chords, a strong, insistent back beat, and a catchy melody."

==Performance==
{{Main|Performance}}
[[File:Naxi Musicians I.jpg|thumb|Chinese [[Nakhi|Naxi]] musicians]]
[[File:Assyrianfolk.jpg|Assyrian folk music|thumb|[[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] playing ''[[zurna]]'' and ''[[Davul]]'', instruments that go back thousands of years.]]
Performance is the physical expression of music, which occurs when a song is sung or when a piano piece, electric guitar melody, symphony, drum beat or other [[Part (music)|musical part]] is played by musicians. In classical music, a musical work is written in [[music notation]] by a composer and then it is performed once the composer is satisfied with its structure and instrumentation. However, as it gets performed, the interpretation of a song or piece can evolve and change. In classical music, instrumental performers, singers or conductors may gradually make changes to the phrasing or tempo of a piece. In popular and traditional music, the performers have a lot more freedom to make changes to the form of a song or piece. As such, in popular and traditional music styles, even when a band plays a [[cover song]], they can make changes to it such as adding a [[guitar solo]] to or inserting an introduction.

A performance can either be planned out and rehearsed (practiced)—which is the norm in classical music, with jazz [[big band]]s and many popular music styles–or [[Musical improvisation|improvised]] over a [[chord progression]] (a sequence of chords), which is the norm in small [[jazz]] and [[blues]] groups. Rehearsals of orchestras, [[concert band]]s and [[choir]]s are led by a conductor. Rock, blues and jazz bands are usually led by the bandleader. A rehearsal is a structured repetition of a song or piece by the performers until it can be sung and/or played correctly and, if it is a song or piece for more than one musician, until the parts are together from a rhythmic and tuning perspective. Improvisation is the creation of a musical idea–a melody or other musical line–created on the spot, often based on scales or pre-existing melodic [[riff]]s.

Many cultures have strong traditions of solo performance (in which one singer or instrumentalist performs), such as in Indian classical music, and in the Western art-music tradition. Other cultures, such as in [[Bali]], include strong traditions of group performance. All cultures include a mixture of both, and performance may range from improvised solo playing to highly planned and organised performances such as the modern classical concert, religious processions, classical music festivals or [[music competition]]s. [[Chamber music]], which is music for a small ensemble with only a few of each type of instrument, is often seen as more intimate than large symphonic works.

===Oral and aural tradition===
Many types of music, such as traditional [[blues]] and [[folk music]] were not written down in [[sheet music]]; instead, they were originally preserved in the memory of performers, and the songs were handed down [[oral history|orally]], from one musician or singer to another, or aurally, in which a performer learns a song "[[Playing by ear (music)|by ear]]". When the composer of a song or piece is no longer known, this music is often classified as "traditional" or as a "folk song". Different musical traditions have different attitudes towards how and where to make changes to the original source material, from quite strict, to those that demand improvisation or modification to the music. A culture's history and stories may also be passed on by ear through song.

===Ornamentation===
{{Main|Ornament (music)}}
[[File:Trill example ornaments.png|thumb|right|upright=0.9|In a score or on a performer's music part, this sign indicates that the musician should perform a [[trill (music)|trill]]—a rapid alternation between two notes. {{audio|Trill example ornaments.mid|Play}}]]
In music, an "ornament" is a decoration to a melody, bassline or other musical part. The detail included explicitly in the [[Musical notation|music notation]] varies between genres and historical periods. In general, art music notation from the 17th through the 19th centuries required performers to have a great deal of contextual knowledge about performing styles. For example, in the 17th and 18th centuries, music notated for solo performers typically indicated a simple, unadorned melody. However, performers were expected to know how to add stylistically appropriate ornaments to add interest to the music, such as [[Trill (music)|trills]] and [[Turn (music)#Turn|turns]].

In the 19th century, art music for solo performers may give a general instruction such as to perform the music expressively, without describing in detail how the performer should do this. The performer was expected to know how to use tempo changes, [[accent (music)|accentuation]], and [[Rest (music)|pauses]] (among other devices) to obtain this "expressive" performance style. In the 20th century, art music notation often became more explicit and used a range of markings and annotations to indicate to performers how they should play or sing the piece.

==Philosophy and aesthetics==
{{Main|Philosophy of music|Aesthetics of music}}
[[File:Boldini, Woman in Red.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|A painting by Boldini of a woman playing the piano]]
Philosophy of music is a subfield of philosophy. The philosophy of music is the study of fundamental questions regarding music. The philosophical study of music has many connections with philosophical questions in [[metaphysics]] and [[aesthetics]].
Some basic questions in the philosophy of music are:
* What is the [[definition of music]]? (What are the [[necessary and sufficient conditions]] for classifying something as music?)
* What is the relationship between music and mind?
* What does musical history reveal to us about the world?
* What is the connection between music and emotions?
* What is meaning in relation to music?

In ancient times, such as with the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]], the aesthetics of music explored the mathematical and cosmological dimensions of rhythmic and harmonic organization. In the 18th century, focus shifted to the experience of hearing music, and thus to questions about its beauty and human enjoyment (''[[plaisir]]'' and ''[[jouissance]]'') of music. The origin of this philosophic shift is sometimes attributed to [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten|Baumgarten]] in the 18th century, followed by [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]. Through their writing, the ancient term 'aesthetics', meaning sensory perception, received its present-day connotation. In the 2000s, philosophers have tended to emphasize issues besides beauty and enjoyment. For example, music's capacity to express emotion has been a central issue.

In the 20th century, important contributions were made by [[Peter Kivy]], [[Jerrold Levinson]], [[Roger Scruton]], and [[Stephen Davies (philosopher)|Stephen Davies]]. However, many musicians, [[music criticism|music critics]], and other non-philosophers have contributed to the aesthetics of music. In the 19th century, a significant debate arose between [[Eduard Hanslick]], a music critic and musicologist, and composer [[Richard Wagner]] regarding whether music can express meaning. [[Harry Partch]] and some other [[musicologist]]s, such as [[Kyle Gann]], have studied and tried to popularize [[microtonal music]] and the usage of alternate [[musical scale]]s. Also many modern composers like [[La Monte Young]], [[Rhys Chatham]] and [[Glenn Branca]] paid much attention to a scale called [[just intonation]].

It is often thought that music has the ability to affect our [[emotions]], [[intellect]], and [[psychology]]; it can assuage our loneliness or incite our passions. The philosopher [[Plato]] suggests in ''the Republic'' that music has a direct effect on the soul. Therefore, he proposes that in the ideal regime music would be closely regulated by the state. (Book VII)

There has been a strong tendency in the aesthetics of music to emphasize the paramount importance of compositional structure; however, other issues concerning the aesthetics of music include [[lyrics|lyricism]], [[harmony]], [[hypnotism]], [[emotion|emotiveness]], [[Temporal Dynamics of Music and Language|temporal dynamics]], [[resonance]], playfulness, and [[timbre (music)|color]] (see also [[musical development]]).

==Psychology==
{{Main|Music psychology}}
Modern music psychology aims to explain and understand musical [[behavior]] and [[experience]].&lt;ref name = Tan&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tan |first1=Siu-Lan |last2=Pfordresher |first2=Peter |last3=Harré |first3=Rom |date=2010 |title=Psychology of Music: From Sound to Significance |location=New York |publisher=Psychology Press |page=2 |isbn=978-1-84169-868-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research in this field and its subfields are primarily [[Empirical research|empirical]]; their knowledge tends to advance on the basis of interpretations of data collected by systematic [[observation]] of and interaction with [[Human subject research|human participants]]. In addition to its focus on fundamental perceptions and cognitive processes, music psychology is a field of research with practical relevance for many areas, including music [[musical technique|performance]], [[music composition|composition]], [[music education|education]], [[music criticism|criticism]], and [[music therapy|therapy]], as well as investigations of human [[aptitude]], skill, [[intelligence]], creativity, and [[social behavior]].

===Cognitive neuroscience of music===
{{Main|Cognitive neuroscience of music}}
[[File:Brodmann 41 42.png|right|upright=1.15|thumb|The [[primary auditory cortex]] is one of the main areas associated with superior pitch resolution.]]
Cognitive neuroscience of music is the scientific study of brain-based mechanisms involved in the cognitive processes underlying music. These behaviours include music listening, performing, composing, reading, writing, and ancillary activities. It also is increasingly concerned with the brain basis for musical aesthetics and musical emotion. The field is distinguished by its reliance on direct observations of the brain, using such techniques as [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS), [[magnetoencephalography]] (MEG), [[electroencephalography]] (EEG), and [[positron emission tomography]] (PET).

===Cognitive musicology===
{{Main|Cognitive musicology}}
Cognitive musicology is a branch of [[cognitive science]] concerned with [[computer model|computationally modeling]] musical knowledge with the goal of understanding both music and cognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Laske |first=Otto |title=Navigating New Musical Horizons (Contributions to the Study of Music and Dance) |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-313-30632-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of computer models provides an exacting, interactive medium in which to formulate and test theories and has roots in [[artificial intelligence]] and [[cognitive science]].&lt;ref&gt;Laske, O.

Psychoacoustics is the scientific study of sound perception. More specifically, it is the branch of science studying the [[psychological]] and [[physiological]] responses associated with sound (including [[speech]] and music). It can be further categorized as a branch of [[psychophysics]].

===Evolutionary musicology===

Evolutionary musicology concerns the "origins of music, the question of animal song, selection pressures underlying music evolution", and "music evolution and human evolution".&lt;ref name="Brown, Merker, Wallin"&gt;Wallin, Nils L./Björn Merker/Steven Brown (1999): "An Introduction to Evolutionary Musicology."

===Culture in music cognition===
{{Main|Culture in music cognition}}
{{See also|Ethnomusicology}}

An individual's culture or [[ethnicity]] plays a role in their [[music cognition]], including their [[Psychology of music preference|preferences]], [[Music and emotion|emotional reaction]], and [[music-related memory|musical memory]].

Many ethnographic studies demonstrate that music is a participatory, community-based activity.&lt;ref&gt;Grazian, David. "The Symbolic Economy of Authenticity in the Chicago Blues Scene." in Music Scenes: Local, Translocal, and Virtual. ed. Bennett, Andy and Richard A. Peterson. Nashville: Vanderbilt University Press, 2004. pp. 31–47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Elizabeth Ball (2010). [https://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1125&amp;context=open_access_etds Portland's Independent Music Scene: Formation of Community Identities and Alternative Urban Cultural Landscapes], p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Music is experienced by individuals in a range of social settings ranging from being alone to attending a large concert, forming a [[music community]], which cannot be understood as a function of individual will or accident; it includes both commercial and non-commercial participants with a shared set of common values. Musical performances take different forms in different cultures and socioeconomic milieus. In Europe and North America, there is often a divide between what types of music are viewed as a "[[high culture]]" and "[[low culture]]." "High culture" types of music typically include Western art music such as Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and modern-era symphonies, concertos, and solo works, and are typically heard in formal concerts in concert halls and churches, with the audience sitting quietly in seats.

Other types of music—including, but not limited to, jazz, blues, [[soul music|soul]], and [[country music|country]]—are often performed in bars, nightclubs, and theatres, where the audience may be able to drink, dance, and express themselves by cheering. Until the later 20th century, the division between "high" and "low" musical forms was widely accepted as a valid distinction that separated out better quality, more advanced "art music" from the popular styles of music heard in bars and dance halls.

However, in the 1980s and 1990s, musicologists studying this perceived divide between "high" and "low" musical genres argued that this distinction is not based on the musical value or quality of the different types of music.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Rather, they argued that this distinction was based largely on the [[socioeconomic]]s standing or social class of the performers or audience of the different types of music.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} For example, whereas the audience for Classical symphony concerts typically have above-average incomes, the audience for a rap concert in an inner-city area may have below-average incomes.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Even though the performers, audience, or venue where non-"art" music is performed may have a lower socioeconomic status, the music that is performed, such as blues, rap, [[Punk rock|punk]], [[funk]], or [[ska]] may be very complex and sophisticated.

When composers introduce styles of music that break with convention, there can be a strong resistance from academic music experts and popular culture. Late-period Beethoven string quartets, Stravinsky ballet scores, [[serialism]], [[bebop]]-era jazz, hip hop, punk rock, and [[electronica]] have all been considered non-music by some critics when they were first introduced.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Such themes are examined in the sociology of music. The sociological study of music, sometimes called [[sociomusicology]], is often pursued in departments of sociology, media studies, or music, and is closely related to the field of [[ethnomusicology]].

===Role of women===
{{Main|Women in music}}
[[File:Clara Wieck im Alter von 15 Jahren.jpg|thumb|right|Nineteenth-century composer and pianist [[Clara Schumann]].]]
Women have played a major role in music throughout history, as composers, songwriters, [[Musician|instrumental performers]], singers, conductors, [[musicology|music scholars]], [[music teacher|music educators]], [[music criticism|music critics]]/[[music journalist]]s and other musical professions. As well, it describes music movements, events and genres related to women, [[women's rights|women's issues]] and [[feminism]]. In the 2010s, while women comprise a significant proportion of [[popular music]] and classical music singers, and a significant proportion of songwriters (many of them being singer-songwriters), there are few women record producers, [[music journalist|rock critics]] and rock instrumentalists. Although there have been a huge number of [[List of women composers|women composers]] in classical music, from the Medieval period to the present day, women composers are significantly underrepresented in the [[Western canon|commonly performed classical music repertoire]], music history textbooks and music encyclopedias; for example, in the ''Concise Oxford History of Music'', [[Clara Schumann]] is one of the only female composers who is mentioned.

Women comprise a significant proportion of instrumental soloists in classical music and the percentage of women in orchestras is increasing. A 2015 article on concerto soloists in major Canadian orchestras, however, indicated that 84% of the soloists with the [[Orchestre Symphonique de Montreal]] were men. In 2012, women still made up just 6% of the top-ranked [[Vienna Philharmonic]] orchestra. Women are less common as instrumental players in popular music genres such as rock and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], although there have been a number of notable female instrumentalists and [[all-female band]]s. Women are particularly underrepresented in [[extreme metal]] genres.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Schaap and Pauwke Berkers. "Grunting Alone? Online Gender Inequality in Extreme Metal Music" in ''Journal of the International Association for the Study of Popular Music''. Vol. 4, no. 1 (2014) p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s pop-music scene, "[l]ike most aspects of the...music business, [in the 1960s,] songwriting was a male-dominated field. Though there were plenty of female singers on the radio, women ...were primarily seen as consumers:...

Women are also underrepresented in orchestral conducting, music criticism/music journalism, [[Music producer|music producing]], and [[sound engineering]]. While women were discouraged from composing in the 19th century, and there are few women [[musicology|musicologists]], women became involved in [[music education]] "...to such a degree that women dominated [this field] during the later half of the 19th century and well into the 20th century."&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://parlorsongs.com/issues/2002-9/thismonth/feature.php |title=Women Composers In American Popular Song |page= 1 |publisher=Parlorsongs.com |date=1911-03-25 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jessica Duchen, a music writer for London's ''[[The Independent]]'', women musicians in classical music are "...too often judged for their appearances, rather than their talent" and they face pressure "...to look sexy onstage and in photos."&lt;ref name="music.cbc.ca"&gt;http://music.cbc.ca/#!/blogs/2014/3/Classical-musics-shocking-gender-gap {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160301002442/http://music.cbc.ca/ |date=2016-03-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Duchen states that while "[t]here are women musicians who refuse to play on their looks,...the ones who do tend to be more materially successful."&lt;ref name="music.cbc.ca"/&gt;
According to the UK's Radio 3 editor, Edwina Wolstencroft, the music industry has long been open to having women in performance or entertainment roles, but women are much less likely to have positions of authority, such as being the [[Conducting|leader of an orchestra]].&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite web |author=Jessica Duchen |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/28/why-male-domination-of-classical-music-might-end |title=Why the male domination of classical music might be coming to an end &amp;#124; Music |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In popular music, while there are many women singers recording songs, there are very few women behind the [[Audio mixer|audio console]] acting as music producers, the individuals who direct and manage the recording process.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ncube |first=Rosina |title=Sounding Off: Why So Few Women In Audio? |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/sep13/articles/sounding-off-0913.htm |journal=Sound on Sound |date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most recorded artists is [[Asha Bhosle]], an Indian singer best known as a playback singer in Hindi cinema.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

==Media and technology==
{{Further|Computer music|Music technology}}

[[File:Peter Francken in his studio.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Music production in the 2000s using a [[digital audio workstation]] (DAW) with an electronic keyboard and a [[multi-monitor]] set-up.]]
The music that composers make can be heard through several media; the most traditional way is to hear it live, in the presence of the musicians (or as one of the musicians), in an outdoor or indoor space such as an amphitheatre, [[concert hall]], [[cabaret]] room or [[theatre music|theatre]]. Since the 20th century, live music can also be broadcast over the radio, television or the Internet, or [[sound recording|recorded]] and listened to on a [[CD player]] or Mp3 player. Some musical styles focus on producing a sound for a performance, while others focus on producing a recording that mixes together sounds that were never played "live." Recording, even of essentially live styles such as rock, often uses the ability to edit and splice to produce recordings that may be considered "better" than the actual performance.

[[Music technology|Technology]] has had an influence on music since prehistoric times, when cave people used simple tools to bore holes into bone flutes 41,000 years ago. Technology continued to influence music throughout the history of music, as it enabled new instruments and music notation reproduction systems to be used, with one of the watershed moments in music notation being the invention of the [[printing press]] in the 1400s, which meant music scores no longer had to be hand copied. In the 19th century, music technology led to the development of a more powerful, louder piano and led to the development of new valves brass instruments. In the early 20th century (in the late 1920s), as [[sound film|talking pictures]] emerged in the early 20th century, with their prerecorded musical tracks, an increasing number of moviehouse orchestra musicians found themselves out of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afm.org/public/about/history.php |title=American Federation of Musicians/History |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405035855/http://www.afm.org/public/about/history.php |archivedate=2007-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1920s, live musical performances by orchestras, pianists, and [[theater organ]]ists were common at first-run theaters.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard (1985), p. 429.&lt;/ref&gt; With the coming of the talking motion pictures, those featured performances were largely eliminated. The [[American Federation of Musicians]] (AFM) took out newspaper advertisements protesting the replacement of live musicians with mechanical playing devices. One 1929 ad that appeared in the ''[[Pittsburgh Press]]'' features an image of a can labeled "Canned Music / Big Noise Brand / Guaranteed to Produce No Intellectual or Emotional Reaction Whatever"&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.duke.edu/digitalcollections/adaccess.R0206/ "Canned Music on Trial"] part of [[Duke University]]'s ''Ad*Access'' project.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since legislation introduced to help protect performers, composers, publishers and producers, including the [[Audio Home Recording Act]] of 1992 in the United States, and the 1979 revised [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]] in the United Kingdom, recordings and live performances have also become more accessible through computers, devices and Internet in a form that is commonly known as [[Music-On-Demand]].

In many cultures, there is less distinction between performing and listening to music, since virtually everyone is involved in some sort of musical activity, often communal. In industrialized countries, listening to music through a recorded form, such as [[Sound recording and reproduction|sound recording]] or watching a music video, became more common than experiencing live performance, roughly in the middle of the 20th century.

Sometimes, live performances incorporate prerecorded sounds. For example, a disc jockey uses [[gramophone record|disc records]] for [[scratching]], and some 20th-century works have a solo for an instrument or voice that is performed along with music that is prerecorded onto a tape. Computers and many [[keyboard (computing)|keyboards]] can be programmed to produce and play [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface]] (MIDI) music. Audiences can also ''become'' performers by participating in [[karaoke]], an activity of Japanese origin centered on a device that plays voice-eliminated versions of well-known songs. Most karaoke machines also have video screens that show lyrics to songs being performed; performers can follow the lyrics as they sing over the instrumental tracks.

===Internet===

The advent of the Internet and widespread high-speed broadband access has transformed the experience of music, partly through the increased ease of access to recordings of music via [[streaming video]] and vastly increased choice of music for consumers. [[Chris Anderson (writer)|Chris Anderson]], in his book ''[[The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business Is Selling Less of More]]'', suggests that while the traditional economic model of [[supply and demand]] describes scarcity, the Internet retail model is based on abundance. [[Data storage device|Digital storage]] costs are low, so a company can afford to make its whole recording inventory available online, giving customers as much choice as possible. It has thus become economically viable to offer music recordings that very few people are interested in. Consumers' growing awareness of their increased choice results in a closer association between listening tastes and social identity, and the creation of thousands of [[niche market]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Chris (2006). The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business is Selling Less of More. Hyperion. {{ISBN|1-4013-0237-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another effect of the Internet arose with [[Virtual community|online communities]] and [[social media]] websites like YouTube and Facebook, a [[social networking service]]. These sites make it easier for aspiring singers and amateur bands to distribute videos of their songs, connect with other musicians, and gain audience interest. Professional musicians also use YouTube as a free publisher of promotional material. YouTube users, for example, no longer only download and listen to MP3s, but also actively create their own. According to [[Don Tapscott]] and [[Anthony D. Williams (author)|Anthony D. Williams]], in their book ''[[Wikinomics]]'', there has been a shift from a traditional consumer role to what they call a "[[prosumer]]" role, a consumer who both creates content and consumes. Manifestations of this in music include the production of [[mashup (music)|mashes]], [[remix]]es, and music videos by fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tapscott |first=Don |authorlink=Don Tapscott |author2=Williams, Anthony D. |authorlink2=Anthony D.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business==
[[File:Concerto music store, Utrechtsestraat 64, Amsterdam 5.jpg|350px|thumb|right|A music store selling various singles and albums]]
{{Main|Music industry}}

The music industry refers to the businesses connected with the creation and sale of music. It consists of songwriters and composers who create new songs and musical pieces, music producers and [[sound engineer]]s who record songs and pieces, record labels and [[Music publisher (popular music)|publishers]] that distribute recorded music products and [[sheet music]] internationally and that often control the rights to those products. Some music labels are "[[independent record label|independent]]," while others are subsidiaries of larger corporate entities or international [[media conglomerate|media groups]]. In the 2000s, the increasing popularity of listening to music as digital music files on MP3 players, iPods, or computers, and of trading music on [[file sharing]] websites or buying it online in the form of digital files had a major impact on the traditional music business. Many smaller independent [[CD store]]s went out of business as music buyers decreased their purchases of CDs, and many labels had lower CD sales. Some companies did well with the change to a digital format, though, such as Apple's [[iTunes]], an [[online music store]] that sells digital files of songs over the Internet.

===Intellectual property laws===
{{Main||Royalty_payment#Music_royalties}}
In spite of some [[international copyright treaties]], determining which music is in the [[public domain]] is complicated by [[:Category:copyright law by country|the variety]] of national [[copyright law]]s that may be applicable.  [[US copyright law]] formerly protected printed music published after 1923 for 28 years and with renewal for another 28 years, but the [[Copyright Act of 1976]] made renewal automatic, and the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] changed the calculation of the copyright term to 70 years after the death of the creator. Recorded sound falls under [[mechanical licensing]], often covered by a confusing patchwork of state laws; most [[cover version]]s are licensed through the [[Harry Fox Agency]]. [[Performance rights]] may be obtained by either performers or the performance venue; the two major organizations for licensing are [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]] and [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]]. Two online sources for [[public domain music]] are [[International Music Score Library Project|IMSLP (International Music Score Library Project)]] and [[Choral Public Domain Library|Choral Public Domain Library (CPDL)]].

==Education==

===Non-professional===
{{Main|Music education}}
[[File:Suzuki violin recital.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|A [[Suzuki method|Suzuki]] violin recital with students of varying ages]]
The incorporation of some music or singing training into general education from [[Preschool education|preschool]] to [[Higher education|post secondary education]] is common in North America and Europe. Involvement in playing and singing music is thought to teach basic skills such as concentration, [[counting]], listening, and cooperation while also promoting understanding of [[language]], improving the ability to [[memory|recall]] information, and creating an environment more conducive to learning in other areas.&lt;ref&gt;Woodall and Ziembroski, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; In elementary schools, children often learn to play instruments such as the [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]], sing in small choirs, and learn about the history of Western art music and traditional music. Some elementary school children also learn about popular music styles. In religious schools, children sing [[hymn]]s and other religious music. In secondary schools (and less commonly in elementary schools), students may have the opportunity to perform in some types of musical ensembles, such as [[choir]]s (a group of singers), [[marching band]]s, [[concert band]]s, jazz bands, or orchestras. In some school systems, music lessons on how to play instruments may be provided. Some students also take private [[music lesson]]s after school with a singing teacher or instrument teacher. Amateur musicians typically learn basic musical rudiments (e.g., learning about [[musical notation]] for [[musical scale]]s and rhythms) and beginner- to intermediate-level singing or instrument-playing techniques.

At the university level, students in most arts and [[humanities]] programs can receive [[Credit (education)|credit]] for taking a few music courses, which typically take the form of an overview course on the [[history of music]], or a [[music appreciation]] course that focuses on listening to music and learning about different musical styles. In addition, most North American and European universities have some types of musical ensembles that students in arts and humanities are able to participate in, such as choirs, marching bands, concert bands, or orchestras. The study of Western art music is increasingly common outside of North America and Europe, such as the [[Indonesian Institute of the Arts, Yogyakarta|Indonesian Institute of the Arts]] in [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]], [[Indonesia]], or the classical music programs that are available in Asian countries such as South Korea, Japan, and China. At the same time, Western universities and colleges are widening their curriculum to include music of non-Western cultures, such as the [[music of Africa]] or Bali (e.g. [[Gamelan]] music).

===Professional training===

Individuals aiming to become professional musicians, singers, composers, songwriters, music teachers and practitioners of other music-related professions such as [[music history]] professors, [[sound engineer]]s, and so on study in specialized post-secondary programs offered by colleges, universities and [[music conservatory|music conservatories]].  Some institutions that train individuals for careers in music offer training in a wide range of professions, as is the case with many of the top U.S. universities, which offer degrees in music performance (including singing and playing instruments), music history, music theory, music composition, [[music education]] (for individuals aiming to become elementary or high school music teachers) and, in some cases, conducting. On the other hand, some small colleges may only offer training in a single profession (e.g., [[sound recording]]).

While most university and conservatory music programs focus on training students in classical music, there are a number of universities and colleges that train musicians for careers as [[jazz]] or [[popular music]] musicians and composers, with notable U.S. examples including the [[Manhattan School of Music]] and the [[Berklee College of Music]]. Two important schools in Canada which offer professional jazz training are [[McGill University]] and [[Humber College]]. Individuals aiming at careers in some types of music, such as [[heavy metal music]], [[country music]] or [[blues]] are less likely to become professionals by completing degrees or diplomas in colleges or universities. Instead, they typically learn about their style of music by singing and/or playing in many bands (often beginning in amateur bands, [[cover band]]s and [[tribute band]]s), studying recordings available on CD, DVD and the Internet and working with already-established professionals in their style of music, either through informal [[mentoring]] or regular [[music lesson]]s. Since the 2000s, the increasing popularity and availability of Internet forums and YouTube "how-to" videos have enabled many singers and musicians from metal, blues and similar genres to improve their skills. Many pop, rock and country singers train informally with [[vocal coach]]es and [[singing teacher]]s.

====Undergraduate====
[[Undergraduate education|Undergraduate]] [[academic degree|university degrees]] in music, including the [[Bachelor of Music]], the Bachelor of Music Education, and the Bachelor of Arts (with a major in music) typically take about four years to complete. These degrees provide students with a grounding in music theory and music history, and many students also study an instrument or learn singing technique as part of their program. Graduates of undergraduate music programs can seek employment or go on to further study in music graduate programs. Bachelor's degree graduates are also eligible to apply to some graduate programs and [[professional school]]s outside of music (e.g., [[public administration]], [[business administration]], [[library science]], and, in some jurisdictions, [[teachers college|teacher's college]], [[law school]] or [[medical school]]).

====Graduate====
Graduate music degrees include the [[Master of Music]], the Master of Arts (in musicology, music theory or another music field), the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) (e.g., in musicology or music theory), and more recently, the [[Doctor of Musical Arts]], or DMA. The Master of Music degree, which takes one to two years to complete, is typically awarded to students studying the performance of an instrument, education, voice (singing) or composition. The Master of Arts degree, which takes one to two years to complete and often requires a [[Dissertation|thesis]], is typically awarded to students studying musicology, music history, music theory or ethnomusicology.

The PhD, which is required for students who want to work as university professors in musicology, music history, or music theory, takes three to five years of study after the master's degree, during which time the student will complete advanced courses and undertake research for a dissertation. The DMA is a relatively new degree that was created to provide a credential for professional performers or composers that want to work as university professors in musical performance or composition. The DMA takes three to five years after a master's degree, and includes advanced courses, projects, and performances. In Medieval times, the study of music was one of the [[Quadrivium]] of the seven [[liberal arts|Liberal Arts]] and considered vital to higher learning. Within the quantitative Quadrivium, music, or more accurately [[harmonic]]s, was the study of rational proportions.

====Musicology====
[[Musicology]], the academic study of the subject of music, is studied in universities and music conservatories. The earliest definitions from the 19th century defined three sub-disciplines of musicology: [[systematic musicology]], [[Music history|historical musicology]], and comparative musicology or [[ethnomusicology]]. In 2010-era scholarship, one is more likely to encounter a division of the discipline into [[music theory]], [[music history]], and [[ethnomusicology]]. Research in musicology has often been enriched by cross-disciplinary work, for example in the field of [[psychoacoustics]]. The study of music of non-Western cultures, and the cultural study of music, is called ethnomusicology. Students can pursue the undergraduate study of musicology, ethnomusicology, [[music history]], and music theory through several different types of degrees, including bachelor's degrees, master's degrees and PhD degrees.

====Music theory====
[[Music theory]] is the study of music, generally in a highly technical manner outside of other disciplines. More broadly it refers to any study of music, usually related in some form with compositional concerns, and may include [[mathematics]], [[physics]], and [[anthropology]]. What is most commonly taught in beginning music theory classes are guidelines to write in the style of the [[common practice period]], or [[Tonality|tonal music]]. Theory, even of music of the common practice period, may take many other forms. [[Set theory (music)|Musical set theory]] is the application of mathematical [[set theory]] to music, first applied to [[Atonality|atonal music]]. ''Speculative music theory'', contrasted with ''analytic music theory'', is devoted to the analysis and synthesis of music materials, for example [[musical tuning|tuning systems]], generally as preparation for composition.

====Zoomusicology====
[[Zoomusicology]] is the study of the music of non-human animals, or the musical aspects of sounds produced by non-human animals. As George Herzog (1941) asked, "do animals have music?" [[François-Bernard Mâche]]'s ''Musique, mythe, nature, ou les Dauphins d'Arion'' (1983), a study of "ornitho-musicology" using a technique of [[Nicolas Ruwet]]'s ''Langage&lt;!--Langage=parlance or mode of speech--&gt;, musique, poésie'' (1972) [[Paradigmatic analysis|paradigmatic segmentation analysis]], shows that [[Bird vocalization|bird songs]] are organised according to a repetition-transformation principle. Jean-Jacques Nattiez (1990), argues that "in the last analysis, it is a human being who decides what is and is not musical, even when the sound is not of human origin. If we acknowledge that sound is not organised and conceptualised (that is, made to form music) merely by its producer, but by the mind that perceives it, then music is uniquely human."

====Ethnomusicology====
{{Main|Ethnomusicology}}
[[File:Frances Densmore recording Mountain Chief2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Ethnomusicologist [[Frances Densmore]] recording [[Blackfoot]] chief Mountain Chief for the [[Bureau of American Ethnology]] (1916)]]
In the West, much of the history of music that is taught deals with the Western civilization's art music, which is known as classical music. The history of music in non-Western cultures ("[[world music]]" or the field of "ethnomusicology"), which typically covers music from
Africa and Asia is also taught in Western universities. This includes the documented classical traditions of Asian countries outside the influence of Western Europe, as well as the folk or indigenous music of various other cultures. Popular or folk styles of music in non-Western countries varied widely from culture to culture, and from period to period. Different cultures emphasised different [[musical instrument|instruments]], techniques, singing styles and uses for music. Music has been used for entertainment, ceremonies, rituals, religious purposes and for practical and artistic communication. Non-Western music has also been used for propaganda purposes, as was the case with [[Chinese opera]] during the [[Cultural Revolution]].

There is a host of music classifications for non-Western music, many of which are caught up in the argument over the [[definition of music]]. Among the largest of these is the division between classical music (or "art" music), and popular music (or [[Contemporary commercial music|commercial music]] – including non-Western styles of rock, [[country music|country]], and pop music-related styles). Some genres do not fit neatly into one of these "big two" classifications, (such as [[folk music]], [[world music]], or [[jazz]]-related music).

As world cultures have come into [[Globalization|greater global contact]], their indigenous musical styles have often merged with other styles, which produces new styles. For example, the United States [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] style contains elements from [[Folk Music of England|Anglo]]-[[Music of Ireland|Irish]], [[Music of Scotland|Scottish]], Irish, [[Music of Germany|German]] and African instrumental and vocal traditions, which were able to fuse in the United States' multi-ethnic "[[melting pot]]" society. Some types of world music contain a mixture of non-Western indigenous styles with Western pop music elements. Genres of music are determined as much by tradition and presentation as by the actual music. Some works, like [[George Gershwin]]'s ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'', are claimed by both jazz and classical music, while Gershwin's ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'' and [[Leonard Bernstein]]'s ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]'' are claimed by both opera and the [[Broadway musical]] tradition. Many current music festivals for non-Western music include bands and singers from a particular musical genre, such as world music.

[[Music of India|Indian music]], for example, is one of the oldest and longest living types of music, and is still widely heard and performed in South Asia, as well as internationally (especially since the 1960s). Indian music has mainly three forms of classical music, [[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani]], [[Carnatic music|Carnatic]], and [[Dhrupad]] styles. It has also a large repertoire of styles, which involve only percussion music such as the talavadya performances famous in [[South India]].

==Music therapy==
{{Main|Music therapy}}
[[File:USMC-05376.jpg|thumb|right|A music therapist from a "Blues in the Schools" program plays harmonica with a US Navy sailor at a Naval Therapy Center.]]
[[Music therapy]] is an interpersonal process in which a trained therapist uses music and all of its facets—physical, emotional, mental, social, aesthetic, and spiritual—to help clients to improve or maintain their health. In some instances, the client's needs are addressed directly through music; in others they are addressed through the relationships that develop between the client and therapist. Music therapy is used with individuals of all ages and with a variety of conditions, including: psychiatric disorders, medical problems, physical disabilities, sensory impairments, developmental disabilities, substance abuse issues, communication disorders, interpersonal problems, and aging. It is also used to improve learning, build self-esteem, reduce stress, [[Exercise and music|support physical exercise]], and facilitate a host of other health-related activities. Music therapists may encourage clients to sing, play instruments, create songs, or do other musical activities.

One of the earliest mentions of music therapy was in [[Al-Farabi]]'s (c. 872–950) treatise ''Meanings of the Intellect'', which described the therapeutic effects of music on the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Haque |first1=Amber |year=2004 |title=Psychology from Islamic Perspective: Contributions of Early Muslim Scholars and Challenges to Contemporary Muslim Psychologists |url= |journal=Journal of Religion and Health |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=357–377 [363] |doi=10.1007/s10943-004-4302-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=May 2011}} Music has long been used to help people deal with their emotions. In the 17th century, the scholar [[Robert Burton (scholar)|Robert Burton]]'s ''[[The Anatomy of Melancholy]]'' argued that music and dance were critical in treating [[Mental disorder|mental illness]], especially [[melancholia]].&lt;ref&gt;cf. The Anatomy of Melancholy, Robert Burton, subsection 3, on and after line 3,480, "Music a Remedy"&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that music has an "excellent power ...to expel many other diseases" and he called it "a sovereign remedy against despair and melancholy." He pointed out that in Antiquity, Canus, a Rhodian fiddler, used music to "make a melancholy man merry, ...a lover more enamoured, a religious man more devout."&lt;ref&gt;Ismenias the Theban, Chiron the centaur, is said to have cured this and many other diseases by music alone: as now thy do those, saith Bodine, that are

[[Albert Einstein]] had a lifelong love of music (particularly the works of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gci.org.uk/Documents/einstein&amp;music.pdf |title=Einstein and his love of music |last=Foster |first=Brian |magazine=Physics World |date=2005 |accessdate=August 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; once stating that life without playing music would be inconceivable to him. In some interviews Einstein even attributed much of his scientific intuition to music, with his son Hans recounting that "whenever he felt that he had come to the end of the road or into a difficult situation in his work, he would take refuge in music, and that would usually resolve all his difficulties." Something in the music, according to Michele and Robert Root-Bernstein in ''[[Psychology Today]]'', "would guide his thoughts in new and creative directions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/imagine/201003/einstein-creative-thinking-music-and-the-intuitive-art-scientific-imagination |title=Einstein On Creative Thinking: Music and the Intuitive Art of Scientific Imagination|author1-last=Root-Bernstein|author1-first=Michele|author2-last=Root-Bernstein|author2-first=Robert |magazine=Psychology Today |date=March 31, 2010 |accessdate=August 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been said that Einstein considered Mozart's music to reveal a universal harmony that Einstein believed existed in the universe, "as if the great Wolfgang Amadeus did not 'create' his beautifully clear music at all, but simply discovered it already made. This perspective parallels, remarkably, Einstein’s views on the ultimate simplicity of nature and its explanation and statement via essentially simple mathematical expressions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.openculture.com/2013/06/the_musical_mind_of_albert_einstein.html |title=The Musical Mind of Albert Einstein: Great Physicist, Amateur Violinist and Devotee of Mozart |website=Open Culture |date=June 25, 2013 |accessdate=August 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review suggests that music may be effective for improving subjective sleep quality in adults with insomnia symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Jesperson |first=Kira |date=13 August 2015 |title=Music for insomnia in adults |journal=The Cochrane Library |volume= |issue=8 |pages= CD010459|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD010459.pub2 |pmid=26270746 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Music is also being used in clinical rehabilitation of cognitive and motor disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322792.php|title=Why does bass make you want to dance?|work=Medical News Today|access-date=2018-08-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Music education for young children''' is an educational program introducing children in a playful manner to [[singing]], [[Speech communication|speech]], [[music]], motion and [[organology]]. It is a subarea of [[music education]].

== Benefits ==
There are many benefits that [[music]] provides for children as they continue to grow.  The benefits that young children acquire through music include [[social skills]], [[emotional self-regulation|emotional self-regulating]] abilities, cognitive benefits, and physical benefits.  Socially, children have the opportunity to learn how to take turns and play with others while still playing individually, for example a band of little players each playing their instrument but yet looking at the big picture of playing with a group of little friends as well.  Music also allows a smooth transitioning throughout daily activities, whether it be at home or in a classroom setting children get the idea of the following activity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Allowing children to play with others, including adults or older siblings also gives them a boost of [[self-esteem]].  Also, different songs show children the different words used for [[emotion]]s and body awareness, as well as extending their vocabulary in general.  Additionally, by extending children’s vocabulary they can also learn of different cultural music and languages, for some the benefit to integrate home within their care-giving setting.  Cognitive benefits also include learning how to count, recognizing sequencing and patterns, [[phonemic awareness]], memorizing different songs for different experiences, and simply memorizing songs and their pace and tone.  Physically, children’s all around [[Gross motor skill|gross]] and [[fine motor skill]]s grow rapidly by learning how to move their body to music, moving their bodies to actions of a song, and as they grow by learning how to hold and play an instrument.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.naeyc.org/files/yc/file/201003/ParlakianWeb0310.pdf|title = Beyond Twinkle, Twinkle Using Music with Infants and Toddlers|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = communityplaythings.com - Learning Through Music: The Support of Brain Research|url = http://www.communityplaythings.com/resources/articles/2006/learning-through-music-the-support-of-brain-research|website = www.communityplaythings.com|accessdate = 2015-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Forms and activities ==
Music education for young children is offered privately through classes and music organizations or integrated into educations private and public schools. Activities and classes can start as early as prenatally or newborn &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Suzuki Prenatal and Baby Years|url=http://www.suzukiece.com/pages/prenatal_and_baby.htm|accessdate=12 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in private education, music programs are often integrated in as early as preschool. Early childhood music education in public school settings widely varies, but music programs have been established in some schools starting in kindergarten even in remote areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Juneau, Alaska Music Matters|url=http://juneaumusicmatters.blogspot.ca|accessdate=12 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most early childhood music education is accomplished through parent or teacher guided interactive play. Prenatal activities can include singing and playing music so that it can be heard in the womb and continued on with newborns. From birth, children can listen to music and observe other children in music classes and participate in tactile and parent assisted activities. With parental assistance, infants can partake in body movement and rhythm exercises to sung songs and recorded music and through play. As these children develop independent motor skills, they progress to doing these activities on their own. Infants and toddlers are often encouraged to sing and explore rhythm through body movements and percussion instruments such as egg shakers, drums, and xylophones. As young children progress, activities can include concepts that introduce counting, solfege, and notation. Some programs then allow for young children to shift easily into more formalized dance and instrumental instruction starting at a very early age.

==Pedagogies of early childhood music education==

Several pedagogies exist which promote specific methods of training young children in music including [[Orff Schulwerk|Orff]], [[Kodály]], [[Dalcroze]], and the [[Suzuki Method]] are among the most widely recognized of these methods. Many of these pedagogies share commonalities such as music and rhythm development through body movements, folk songs, aural training, and belief that music literacy from an early age is beneficial. Each is known for particular characteristics, such as in [[Dalcroze Eurhythmics]] the use of lifelong body movement and expression through music and private instrumental instruction as early as age two in the Suzuki Method. institutions and teachers often use a combination of these pedagogies even if they might be affiliated with only one.

==World music==
Studies done on children who have had a musical background, have shown that it increases brain function as well as brain stimulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|website = brainvolts.northwestern.edu|title = Musicians’ Enhanced Neural Differentiation of Speech Sounds Arises Early in Life: Developmental Evidence from Ages 3 to 30|date = |accessdate = |url=http://www.brainvolts.northwestern.edu/documents/Cereb.%20Cortex-2013-Strait-cercor_bht103.pdf |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  When children are exposed to music from other countries and cultures, they are able to learn about the instrument while at the same time being educated about a different part of the world.

'''New Suburbanism''' is an [[urban design]] movement which intends to improve on existing [[Suburb|suburban]] or [[exurban]] designs.&lt;ref name="The New Suburbanism: A Realist's Guide to the American Future"&gt;[http://www.southbaycities.org/files/12.05%20Kotkin%20New%20Suburbanism%20Report.pdf ]{{dead link|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Suburbanists seek to establish an alternative between a dichotomy of the centripedal city and centrifugal suburb,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/23290105?uid=3739256&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101999752763|title=The Emerging 'Silicon Savanna': From Old Urbanism to New Suburbanism|author=STEPHEN MARSHALL|date=1978|volume=32|pages=267–280|publisher=Alexandrine Press|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; by features such as rear-loading garages and walking-focused landscaping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barternews.com/new_suburbanism_growing_in_southern_california.htm |title=New Suburbanism Growing In Southern California |publisher=Barternews.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design strategy for New Suburbanism differs from the traditional postwar suburban development. In contrast to post-war suburbanism where the homebuyer had few options in regards to [[Personalization|customization]], new suburban communities feature customization through packages and add-ons as well as larger homes in denser communities. Postwar suburban developments have since filled in with homes and businesses began emerging there, outside of the city-center. This created new communities, not just suburban housing.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lewis|first=Paul and Marc Tsurumaki, David J. Lewis.|date=2003|title=New Suburbanism|url=http://newprairiepress.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1384&amp;context=oz|journal=Oz|volume=25|pages=34–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Suburban sprawl]] is associated with negative effects because it often takes over farm land, disrupts ecosystems, has low-density housing, and car-dependent communities. Suburban sprawl continues to grow as over 70% of Americans choose to live in such communities.&lt;ref&gt;Fannie-Mae-Foundation. ''Downtown housing as an urban redevelopment tool: hope or hype (panel discussion).'' Housing Policy Debate, 10 (1997), pp. 477–505. Retrieved: 3 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Planners are currently seeking to make the suburbs more [[Sustainability|sustainable]] and New Suburbanism offers a solution. This planning approach seeks to redesign suburban communities by making them more-dense, equitable, and environmentally sustainable while still keeping housing and design preferences of the consumer in mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Atkninson-Palombo|first=Carol|date=2010|title=New housing construction in Phoenix: Evidence of "new suburbanism"?|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264275109001073|journal=Cities|volume=27|pages=77–86|doi=10.1016/j.cities.2009.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison to New Urbanism==
[[New Urbanism]] is a style of planning a new neighborhood that focuses on designing aspects that create more [[community engagement]], whereas New Suburbanism is the improving of an existing suburban neighborhood.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

New urbanism, though a small movement, is more successful than New Suburbanism, as NS only has 1 location and NU has hundreds.

They were found in Tang-i Var, Kuh-e Salan Mountain, near the village of Shahr Hawraman. The documents were found in a sealed jar by a villager, and then sent to London in October 1913.&lt;ref name=SOAS&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Edmonds|first1=C.

'''Paul Zacchias''' or Paolo Zacchia (1584-1659) was an [[Italians|Italian]] physician, teacher of medical science, [[Medical jurisprudence|forensic medicine]], medio-legal jurist, philosopher, and poet. He is said to have been personal physician to [[Pope Innocentius X]] and [[Pope Alexander VII]].&lt;ref name="medico"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T7RXAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA532&amp;dq=paul+zacchias&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ULa2T6bIFIS42gX4otDOCQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=paul%20zacchias&amp;f=false|title=The Medico-legal journal, Volume 2|publisher=Medico-Legal Journal Association|year=1885|author=Medico-Legal Society of New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xnqI8uSeekwC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=paul+zacchias&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ULa2T6bIFIS42gX4otDOCQ&amp;ved=0CF0Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=paul%20zacchias&amp;f=false|title='On the Beliefs of the Greeks': Leo Allatios and Popular Orthodoxy|last=Hartnup|first=Karen|date=2004-01-01|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9004131809|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zacchias was also legal adviser to the [[Rota Romana]], the highest [[Papal]] court of appeals,&lt;ref name=lancet /&gt; and head of the medical system in the [[Papal States]]. His most well known book in three volumes, ''Quaestiones medico-legales'' (1621-1651) established [[legal medicine]] as a topic of study.&lt;ref name="medico" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Händel K (2003) 'Paolo Zacchia – der geistige Vater der Rechts-medizin', ''Arch Kriminol'' Vol. 212, No. 3-4 (Sep-Oct 2003), pp.65–73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JAMA"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eFTlAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1572&amp;dq=paul+zacchias&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ULa2T6bIFIS42gX4otDOCQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=paul%20zacchias&amp;f=false|title=JAMA.: The Journal of the American Medical Association, Volume 38|last=|first=|publisher=American Medical Association, HighWire Press|year=1902|isbn=|location=|pages=618}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zacchias work also contains [[Superstition|superstitious]] views on [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], [[Witchcraft|witches]], and [[Demon|demons]] which were widely held at the time.&lt;ref name="lancet"&gt;{{cite book | title=Northwestern lancet , Volume 18 | year=1898 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oxcTAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA261&amp;dq=paul+zacchias&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ULa2T6bIFIS42gX4otDOCQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=paul%20zacchias&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, both theological and medical knowledge was required to differentiate natural cases of sickness from supernatural causes which might require attention of the [[Catholic Church|Catholic church]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Zacchias was known for a skeptical approach that attempted to eliminate natural causes before diagnosing phenomena as witchcraft. Medical practitioners at his time were also made available to diagnose and assess between miracles and natural causes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

He is known to have argued that minors make proper test subjects to be put to [[torture]].&lt;ref name="JAMA" /&gt; Despite these views, Zacchias is seen to have notably progressed the works of [[Medical jurisprudence|jurisprudence]] in medicine of the time period.

== Biography ==
Paul Zacchias was born in [[Rome]] in 1584 and died in the city in 1659. Zacchias in his life was director of the health system of the Papal States, as well as legal adviser to the [[Rota Romana]], the highest [[Papal]] court of appeals.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JU_LlvZlJbcC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;lpg=PA75&amp;dq=Policing+the+anus:+stuprum+and+sodomy+according+to+Paolo+Zacchia+%E2%80%98Forensic+medicine&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pE8C0yZiVa&amp;sig=phwFgpAU2OscsWfmaqiZq02_dIg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjt4sCjitjUAhWp64MKHfcCBQ0Q6AEILTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Policing%20the%20anus:%20stuprum%20and%20sodomy%20according%20to%20Paolo%20Zacchia%20%E2%80%98Forensic%20medicine&amp;f=false|title=The Sciences of Homosexuality in Early Modern Europe|last=Borris|first=Kenneth|last2=Rousseau|first2=George S.|date=2013-01-11|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136015748|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 1532, legal medicine was introduced to the court system via penal code. However, Zacchias work helped to add scientific basis to the legal practice and court system.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oxcTAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA261&amp;dq=paul+zacchias&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ULa2T6bIFIS42gX4otDOCQ&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=paul%20zacchias&amp;f=false|title=Northwestern Lancet|date=1898|publisher=publisher not identified|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quaestiones medico-legales==
Quaestiones medico-legales is divided into three sections. The first section contains decisions of the Rota Romana during his time serving on it. The other two sections cover questions of human [[physiology]]. In it he examines problems such as the formation of [[hermaphrodite]]s, and the animation of the [[foetus]] and [[superfoetation]]. The later two volumes also include many observations by Zacchias on mental disease.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Zacchias was also familiar with hypochondriacal disorder or those without geniune illness.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Quaestiones medico-legales was translated into several other languages from [[Latin]], and was used by medical practitioners into the 18th century.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10521">'''Pharmacotoxicology''' entails the study of the consequences of [[Toxin|toxic]] exposure to [[pharmaceutical]] [[drug]]s and agents in the [[health care]] field.  The field of pharmacotoxicology also involves the treatment and prevention of pharmaceutically induced [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side effects]]. Pharmacotoxicology can be separated into two different categories: [[pharmacodynamics]] (the effects of a drug on an organism), and [[pharmacokinetics]] (the effects of the organism on the drug).

==Mechanisms of Pharmaceutical Drug Toxicity==
There are many mechanisms by which pharmaceutical drugs can have toxic implications. A very common mechanism is covalent binding of either the drug or its metabolites to specific enzymes or receptor in tissue-specific pathways that then will elicit toxic responses. Covalent binding can occur during both on-target and off-target situations and after [[biotransformation]].

===On-target toxicity.=== 
On-target toxicity is also referred to as mechanism-based toxicity. This type of adverse effect that results from pharmaceutical drug exposure is commonly due to interactions of the drug with its intended target. In this case, both the therapeutic and toxic targets are the same. To avoid toxicity during treatment, many times the drug needs to be changed to target a different aspect of the illness or symptoms. [[Statins]] are an example of a drug class that can have toxic effects at the therapeutic target ([[HMG CoA reductase]]).&lt;ref name="Guengerich"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guengerich|first1=F. Peter|title=Mechanisms of Drug Toxicity and Relevance to Pharmaceutical Development|journal=Drug Metab Pharmokinet.|date=2011|volume=26|issue=1|pages=3–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immune Responses===
Some pharmaceuticals can initiate allergic reactions, as in the case of [[penicillins]]. In some people, administration of penicillin can induce production of specific antibodies and initiate an immune response. Activation of this response when unwarranted can cause severe health concerns and prevent proper immune system functioning.&lt;ref name="Guengerich" /&gt; Immune responses to pharmaceutical exposure can be very common in accidental contamination events. [[Tamoxifen]], a [[selective estrogen receptor modulator]], has been shown to alter the humoral adaptive immune response in gilthead seabream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rodenas|first1=M.C.|last2=Cabas|first2=I.|last3=Abellán|first3=E.|last4=Meseguer|first4=J.|last5=Mulero|first5=V.|last6=García-Ayala|first6=A.|title=Tamoxifen persistently disrupts the humoral adaptive immune response of gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata L.)|journal=Developmental &amp; Comparative Immunology|date=December 2015|volume=53|issue=2|pages=283–292|doi=10.1016/j.dci.2015.06.014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, pharmaceuticals can produce adverse effects not only in humans, but also in organisms that are unintentionally exposed.

===Off-target toxicity===
Adverse effects at targets other than those desired for pharmaceutical treatments often occur with drugs that are nonspecific. If a drug can bind to unexpected proteins, receptors, or enzymes that can alter different pathways other than those desired for treatment, severe downstream effects can develop. An example of this is the drug [[eplerenone]] (aldosterone receptor antagonist), which should increase aldosterone levels, but has shown to produce atrophy of the prostate.&lt;ref name="Rudmann"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rudmann|first1=Daniel G.|title=On-target and off-target-based toxicologic effects|journal=Toxicologic Pathology|date=2013|volume=41|pages=310–314|doi=10.1177/0192623312464311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bioactivation===
[[Bioactivation]] is a crucial step in the activity of certain pharmaceuticals. Often times, the parent form of the drug is not the active form and it needs to be metabolized in order to produce its therapeutic effects. In other cases, bioactivation is not necessarily needed for drugs to be active and can instead produce reactive intermediates that initiate stronger adverse effects than the original form of the drug. Bioactivation can occur through the action Phase I metabolic enzymes, such as [[cytochrome P450]] or [[peroxidases]]. Reactive intermediates can cause a loss of function in some enzymatic pathways or can promote the production of [[reactive oxygen species]], both of which can increase stress levels and alter homeostasis.

===Drug-drug interactions===
Drug-drug interactions can occur when certain drugs are administered at the same time. Effects of this can be additive (outcome is greater than those of one individual drug), less than additive (therapeutic effects are less than those of one individual drug), or functional alterations (one drug changes how another is absorbed, distributed, and metabolized).&lt;ref name="Hussar"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hussar|first1=Daniel A.|title=Drug Interactions|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/drugs/factors-affecting-response-to-drugs/drug-interactions|website=Merck Manuals Consumer Version}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drug-drug interactions can be of serious concern for patients who are undergoing multi-drug therapies.&lt;ref name="OATPs"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alam|first1=Khondoker|last2=Pahwa|first2=Sonia|last3=Wang|first3=Xueying|last4=Zhang|first4=Pengyue|last5=Ding|first5=Kai|last6=Abuznait|first6=Alaa H.|last7=Li|first7=Lang|last8=Yue|first8=Wei|title=Downregulation of organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 transport function by lysosomotropic drug chloroquine: implication of OATP-mediated drug-drug interactions|journal=Molecular Pharmaceutics|date=2016|volume=13|pages=839–851}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coadministration of [[chloroquine]], an anti-malaria drug, and statins for treatment of cardiovascular diseases has been shown to cause inhibition of [[organic anion-transporting polypeptide]]s (OATPs) and lead to systemic statin exposure.&lt;ref name="OATPs"/&gt;

==Pharmacotoxicity Examples==
There are many different pharmaceutical drugs that can produce adverse effects after biotransformation, interaction with alternate targets, or through drug-drug interactions. All pharmaceuticals can be toxic, depending on the dose.&lt;ref name="Casarett &amp; Doull's"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Klaassen|editor1-first=Curtis D.|title=Casarett and Doull's toxicology : the basic science of poisons|date=2013|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|location=New York|isbn=0-07-176923-4|edition=8th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acetaminophen===
[[Acetaminophen]] (APAP) is a very common drug used to treat pain. High doses of acetaminophen has been shown to produce severe [[hepatotoxicity]] after being biotransformed to produce reactive intermediates. Acetaminophen is metabolized by CYP2E1 to produce [[NAPQI]], which then causes significant oxidative stress due to increased [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS).&lt;ref name="Mechanistic"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boelsterli|first1=Urs A.|title=Mechanistic Toxicology the Molecular Basis of How Chemicals Disrupt Biological.|date=2002|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|location=London|isbn=0-203-36176-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; ROS can cause cellular damage in a multitude of ways, a few of which being DNA and mitochondrial damage and depletion of antioxidant enzymes such as [[glutathione]]. In terms of drug-drug interactions, acetaminophen activates [[CAR]], a nuclear receptor involved in the production of metabolic enzymes, which increases the metabolism of other drugs. This could either cause reactive intermediates/drug activity to persist for longer than necessary, or the drug will be cleared quicker than normal and prevent any therapeutic actions from occurring. Ethanol induces CYP2E1 enzymes in the liver, which can lead to increased NAPQI formation in addition to that formed by acetaminophen.&lt;ref name="Mechanistic" /&gt;

===Aspirin===
Aspirin is an [[NSAID]] used to treat inflammation and pain. Overdoses or treatments in conjunction with other NSAIDs can produce additive effects, which can lead to increased oxidative stress and ROS activity. Chronic exposure to aspirin can lead to CNS toxicity and eventually affect respiratory function.&lt;ref name="Long"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Long|first1=Scott|title=Toxicity of Selected Drugs|url=http://faculty.swosu.edu/scott.long/txcl/drugtox.htm|website=faculty.swosu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-depressants===
Anti-depressants have been prescribed since the 1950s, and their prevalence has significantly increased since then. There are many classes of anti-depressant pharmaceuticals, such as [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]] (SSRIs), [[monoamine oxidase inhibitors]] (MAOIs), and [[tricyclic anti-depressants]]. Many of these drugs, especially the SSRIs, function by blocking the metabolism or reuptake of neurotransmitters to treat depression and anxiety. Chronic exposure or overdose of these pharmaceuticals can lead to seratonin and CNS hyperexcitation, weight changes, and, in severe cases, suicide.&lt;ref name="Long" /&gt;

===Anti-cancer drugs===
[[Doxorubicin]] is a very effective anti-cancer drug that causes congestive heart failure while treating tumors.&lt;ref name="Mechanistic" /&gt; Doxorubicin is an uncoupling agent in that it inhibits proper functioning of complex I of the electron transport chain in mitochondria. It then leads to the production of ROS and the inhibition of ATP production. Doxorubicin has been shown to be selectively toxic to cardiac tissue, although some toxicity has been seen in other tissues as well.&lt;ref name="Mechanistic" /&gt; Other anti-cancer drugs, such as [[fluoropyrimidines]] and [[taxanes]], are extremely effective at treating and reducing tumor proliferation, but have high incidences of cardiac arrhythmias and myocardial infarctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rosa|first1=Gian Marco|last2=Gigli|first2=Lorenzo|last3=Tagliasacchi|first3=Maria Isabella|last4=Di Iorio|first4=Cecilia|last5=Carbone|first5=Federico|last6=Nencioni|first6=Alessio|last7=Montecucco|first7=Fabrizio|last8=Brunelli|first8=Claudio|title=Update on cardiotoxicity of anti-cancer treatments|journal=European Journal of Clinical Investigation|date=March 2016|volume=46|issue=3|pages=264–284|doi=10.1111/eci.12589}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cognitive planning''' is one of the [[executive function]]s. It encompasses the [[neurological]] processes involved in the formulation, evaluation and selection of a sequence of thoughts and actions to achieve a desired goal. Various studies utilizing a combination of [[neuropsychological]], neuropharmacological and functional [[neuroimaging]] approaches have suggested there is a positive relationship between impaired planning ability and damage to the [[frontal lobe]].

A specific area within the mid-dorsolateral frontal cortex located in the frontal lobe has been implicated as playing an intrinsic role in both cognitive planning and associated executive traits such as [[working memory]].

Disruption of the [[neural pathway]]s, via various mechanisms such as [[traumatic brain injury]], or the effects of [[neurodegenerative disease]]s between this area of the frontal cortex and the [[basal ganglia]] specifically the [[striatum]] (cortico-striatal pathway), may disrupt the processes required for normal planning function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 9421831 | volume=53 | issue=4 | title=Cognitive planning in humans: neuropsychological, neuroanatomical and neuropharmacological perspectives | date=November 1997 | journal=Prog.

==Neuropsychological tests==
[[File:Tower of Hanoi 4.gif|thumb|right|Animation of a four disc version of the [[Tower of Hanoi]].|alt=A version of the Tower of Hanoi utilizing four discs.]]
There are a variety of neuropsychological tests which can be used to measure variance of planning ability between the subject and controls.

*'''[[Tower of Hanoi]]''' (TOH-R), a puzzle invented in 1883 by the French mathematician Édouard Lucas. There are variations of the puzzle - the classic version consists of three rods and usually seven to nine  discs of subsequently smaller size. Planning is a key component of the problem solving skills necessary to achieve the objective, which is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following rules:
**Only one disk may be moved at a time.
**Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the rods and sliding it onto another rod, on top of the other disks that may already be present on that rod.
**No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Welsh | first1 = MC | last2 = Huizinga | first2 = M | date = June 2001 | title = The development and preliminary validation of the Tower of Hanoi-revised | url = | journal = Assessment | volume = 8 | issue = 2| pages = 167–76 | pmid = 11428696 | doi=10.1177/107319110100800205}}&lt;br&gt;- {{cite journal | last1 = Anderson | first1 = JR | last2 = Albert | first2 = MV | last3 = Fincham | first3 = JM | date = August 2005 | title = Tracing problem solving in real time: fMRI analysis of the subject-paced Tower of Hanoi | url = | journal = J Cogn Neurosci | volume = 17 | issue = 8| pages = 1261–74 | doi = 10.1162/0898929055002427 | pmid = 16197682 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Tower of London test|Tower of London]]''' (TOL) is another test that was developed in 1982 (Shallice 1982) specifically to detect deficits in planning as may occur with damage to the frontal lobe.  test participants with damage to the left anterior frontal lobe demonstrated planning deficits (i.e., greater number of moves required for solution).

In test, participants with damage to the right anterior, and left or right posterior areas of the frontal lobes showed no impairment. The results implicating the left anterior frontal lobes involvement in solving the TOL were supported in concomitant neuroimaging studies which also showed a reduction in regional [[cerebral blood flow]] to the left pre-frontal lobe. For the number of moves, a significant negative correlation was observed for the left prefrontal area, i.e. subjects that took more time planning their moves showed greater activation in the left prefrontal area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

'''Pop culture pathology''' (or '''Popular culture pathology''') is the forensic study of [[popular culture]] in fields such as celebrity,&lt;ref&gt;Gans, J.H. (1999). ''Popular Culture and High Culture: an analysis and evaluation of taste''. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; music, fashion, food, aesthetic desire, television, as well as additional and often obscure media and stimuli. Pop culture pathology is an obscure branch of both [[Critical Theory]] and [[Cultural Studies]].

Originating in private universities in the United States around the turn of the millennium, pop culture pathology is the systematic attempt to analyze trends in culture in order to examine more closely the relationships that the individual has to the world around them. The studies include experiments with the [[aesthetic]] experiences that people have in common, with the goal being to uncover the intrinsic trend that allows for the phenomenon of extrinsic trends. Some common philosophical foundations for this tradition are [[Michel Foucault]] and the philosophy of [[deconstruction]] pioneered by [[Jacques Derrida]].

== The Botto Experiment==
The most common way to test theories in pop culture pathology is to attempt to simulate situations of complete cultural ignorance. For example, a test done in 2005 at University of California, Berkeley, is referred to as the "Botto Experiment".  A young student named Nicholas Botto was given a CD on its release date that had received no radio play and which he had no exposure to. He listened to only this album for two months and was readmitted to society. He was told to return in a year's time with 5 albums that he found he enjoyed in light of the album he had been assigned. In the experiment the album that was famously used was ''In An Aeroplane Over The Sea'' by the [[indie rock]] band [[Neutral Milk Hotel]]. The style of music was known as "[[Lo-Fi]]" which was uncommon at the time. A year later Botto returned with five similar albums. His choices perfectly predicted a generation of music in the Lo-Fi genre, opening the door for pop culture pathology to be known as a legitimate subject.

==Implications of Popular Culture Pathology==
The postmodern implications of this type of experimentation are still being realized by scientists and philosophers. By assigning meaning to a certain cultural item the person conducting the experiment is deciding what will matter in the entirety of the next year for the subject. It seems to go without saying that this type of influence poses solutions for current cultural trends that are deemed "immoral." By making the greater good more fashionable socially many of the worlds problems have the potential to be fixed in the future.

===Failures of Popular Culture Pathology===
Unfortunately the Botto Experiment caused irreversible side effects. The cultural boom that the experiment predicted engulfed the subject forcing an end to the next stage of the experiment.  Next, the subject was supposed to be given the same album a second time and told to return with an additional five. The second phase was supposed to show the instability of modern society and the impossibility of forcing the individual to move against it. This was proven wrong as the subject returned to the same five albums as before, effectively ruining the study.

===Macro Ventures in PCP===
This type of experiment has taken place on different scales and in different ways. For example, the [[Music Genome Project]] has created a service known as [[Pandora Radio]] that allows the user to connect with various types of music according to extremely limited initial criteria. This type of conditioning is also present in the latest incarnation of Apple's [[iTunes]]. The new "Genius" feature allows the user to discover music that perpetuates their current cultural trend, furthering the flawed results of the perplexing but vastly studied Botto Experiment.

==What comes next?==
Academia has been waiting anxiously for the next manifestation of popular culture pathology.  The anticipation has caused the creation of two different views on the subject. One, pioneered in the United States, predicts that the science will next try to cause moral reform. Much fear surrounds this popular view but more than that there is suspicion that the sentiment has simply been placed at the influence of another experiment in the field itself. Given the ironic nature of the study it seems likely that the next manifestation will be at the hands of the next philosopher daring enough to repeat the Botto Experiment with a focus on the field of popular culture pathology instead of popular culture itself.

The second prediction arose in Europe and is more secular. Philosophers there believe that popular culture pathology is the end of the moral focus of the "new world." The term "new world" has been used here in order to call attention to the fact that the Americas have habitually been ahead of Europe technologically, but far behind intellectually. The idea that morality is facing its doom is generally coming, again, from postmodern European philosophy (see [[Nietzsche]], [[Baudrillard]], [[Heidegger]]) predicting the realization that meaning is being assigned by the institution not the individual. This brings the field back to Michel Foucault and the problem of the individual. This view harbors intense curiosity at the cyclical nature of the study. In the end only time will tell the future of this curious new field of study.

The '''Rosa Luxemburg Foundation''' ({{lang-de|Rosa-Luxemburg-Stiftung}}) named in recognition of [[Rosa Luxemburg]], occasionally referred to as ''Rosa-Lux'', is a transnational alternative policy group and educational institution, centered in [[Germany]] and affiliated to the democratic socialist [[Left Party (Germany)| Left Party]]. The foundation, which was established in [[Berlin]] in 1990 (originally as the "Social Analysis and Political Education Association").&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, William. 2014.  “Alternative Policy Groups and Transnational Counter-Hegemonic Struggle.” Pp. 259-84 in Yıldız Atasoy (ed.) Global Economic Crisis and the Politics of Diversity. London &amp; New York: Palgrave MacMillan&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals and Activities==
RosaLux’s mission is to engage productively with what it sees as a diverse, pluralistic and transnational 'political left’, and to help develop its transformative capacities.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, William. 2014.  “Alternative Policy Groups and Transnational Counter-Hegemonic Struggle.” Pp. 259-84 in Yıldız Atasoy (ed.) Global Economic Crisis and the Politics of Diversity. London &amp; New York: Palgrave MacMillan&lt;/ref&gt; To this end, the foundation's activities consists of two main tracks: general political education and academic/scientific work. 

Through the '''Institute for Critical Social Analysis''', RosaLux delivers critical research on neoliberal capitalism, produces analytic work on political strategy, policy and democratic socialist alternatives, as well as work addressing injustices pertaining to gender, sexuality, race and nation.&lt;ref&gt;.http://rosalux.de/english/foundation/research-projects.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the '''Academy for Political Education,''' the foundation offers extensive programs of political education in the form of public conferences, seminars and workshops, and provides courses for youth and adult learners on topics including economic literacy, gender inequalities, sustainable development and political communication. It engages social movements directly and through media such as its website, public events and through the production of informational materials such as pamphlets.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rosalux.de/english/foundation/political-education.html&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Further, through the '''Centre for International Dialogue and Cooperation''', it engages and supports social movement groups and organizations in Latin America, Africa, Asia, Europe and North America in the form of funding, as well as through seminars and conferences that are organized with local partners.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rosalux.de/english/worldwide.html&lt;/ref&gt;

While the foundation is centered in Germany, its transnational presence and reach is extensive, with 16 foreign offices supporting activities in more than 25 countries.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, William. 2014.  “Alternative Policy Groups and Transnational Counter-Hegemonic Struggle.” Pp. 259-84 in Yıldız Atasoy (ed.) Global Economic Crisis and the Politics of Diversity. London &amp; New York: Palgrave MacMillan&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
In September 2014, the Rosa Luxemburg Foundation and the Center for Development Studies at [[Birzeit University]] organized a conference entitled, "Alternatives to Neo-Liberal Development in the Occupied Palestinian Territories – Critical Perspectives",&lt;ref name=RLF&gt;{{cite web|title=Alternatives to Neo-Liberal Development in the Occupied Palestinian Territories – Critical Perspectives|url=https://www.facebook.com/rlfpal/posts/902387746456825|publisher=September 16 2014 at 5:26am|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] Israeli Haaretz journalist [[Amira Hass]] was asked by two Birzeit lecturers to leave on account of a rule against the presence of Israelis (which she judged to mean Israeli Jews).&lt;ref name=Hass-Birzeit&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hass|first1=Amira|title=When a Haaretz journalist was asked to leave a Palestinian university|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/features/.premium-1.618007|accessdate=28 September 2014|publisher=haaretz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; She said that she had attended the university many times and had never heard of such a rule.&lt;ref name=Hass-Birzeit/&gt; The international conference's organizers were offended. The regional head of the Rosa Luxembourg Foundation Katja Hermann stated after the incident that she would not have agreed to hold the conference at Birzeit if she was aware of the policy.&lt;ref name=Hass-Birzeit/&gt; The university later issued a statement that "The administration has nothing against the presence of the journalist Hass. The university as a national institution differentiates between friends and enemies of the Palestinian people…and works with every person or institution that is against the occupation."&lt;ref name=Hass-Birzeit/&gt; In a previous incident, Israeli anti-Zionist historian [[Ilan Pappé]] had been invited to deliver a lecture at Birzeit which was held off-campus, as not to infringe with the alleged ban on Israeli Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.algemeiner.com/2014/09/29/left-wing-israeli-journalist-justifies-her-own-exclusion-by-palestinians/ Left-Wing Israeli Journalist Justifies Her Own Exclusion by Palestinians, September 29, 2014] [[Algemeiner Journal]]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are variations in the perception and display of sexual suggestiveness, including but not limited to gender, culture and generation. Different cultures and different generations have varying views on what is considered to be sexually suggestive. For example, in British culture, it is normal for a woman to wear shorts and bare her legs on a hot, sunny day, but a woman with naked flesh on show would be considered [[promiscuous]] in certain cultures around the world. For the majority of the 20th century in western culture, it was considered vulgar for women to have their sexual ornaments ([[breasts]]) fully on show; in more modern times, this may not be a deviation from the norm. In [[evolution]]ary terms, sexual suggestiveness is a mode from which sexual mates are gained. Therefore, the ability to use sexual suggestiveness effectively is a trait that is part of [[sexual selection]].

Displays of sexual suggestiveness include things such as; women in swimsuit adverts, sexually-themed music or music with a strong beat meant for dancing, [[sexting]], erotic [[lingerie]] or "[[wolf whistling]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=National Research Council |url=http://www.nap.edu/netsafekids/pp_whatis.html |title=What Is Pornography? |publisher=Nap.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christian.org.uk/news/sexually-suggestive-ms-bus-advert-banned/ |title=Sexually suggestive M&amp;S bus advert banned &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; The Christian Institute |publisher=Christian.org.uk |date=2011-12-07 |accessdate=2013-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="crisisinterventioncenter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crisisinterventioncenter.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=147:what-is-sexting&amp;catid=39:teens&amp;Itemid=79|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126151309/http://www.crisisinterventioncenter.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=147:what-is-sexting&amp;catid=39:teens&amp;Itemid=79 |archive-date=2012-01-26 |dead-url=yes|title=What is Sexting|accessdate=2014-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= |title=Brain Potentials to Sexually Suggestive Whistles Show Meaning Modulates the Mismatch Negativity |journal=NeuroReport |volume=16 |issue=12 |pages=1313–1317 |pmc=1361366  |date=2013-03-25 |author1=Frangos |first1=J |last2=Ritter |first2=W |last3=Friedman |first3=D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HHQDbNk0v94C&amp;pg=PA299&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title=Popular Music: The rock era - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-09-07|isbn=9780415332682 |year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual suggestiveness may also involve nudity, or the exposure of the nipples, genitals, buttocks or other [[taboo]] areas of the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketingcharts.com/interactive/one-in-five-teens-sends-sexually-explicit-images-7416/ |title=One in Five Teens Sends Sexually Explicit Images |publisher=Marketingcharts.com |date=2009-01-06 |accessdate=2013-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ESeO4E-ffKsC&amp;pg=PA215&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title=Family Life Education: Principles and Practices for Effective Outreach - Stephen F.

In some cases, displays of sexual suggestiveness may be misinterpreted which may lead to dangerous or harmful situations.

==Evolutionary perspective==

From an evolutionary point of view, sexual suggestiveness evolved in order to aid in securing a [[sexual partner]] or mate. Once the individual has decided on a mate to pursue, sexual suggestiveness helps in attracting the mate - this is a skill which has been sexually selected ([[sexual selection]]) for during evolution. Sexually suggestive behaviors include things such as "showing more skin" and [[flirting]]. Both of these examples are behaviors which the individual would intentionally display. There is also research to suggest that sexually suggestive behaviors may not always be deliberate.&lt;ref&gt;Haselton, M. G., Mortezaie, M., Pillsworth, E. G., Bleske-Rechek, A., &amp; Frederick, D. A. (2007). Ovulatory shifts in human female ornamentation: Near ovulation, women dress to impress. Hormones and Behavior, 51, 40 – 45&lt;/ref&gt; Unbeknownst to the individual, factors such as the [[menstrual cycle]], voice pitch and rate of money spending can all have an effect on sexual success and sexually suggestive behavior. For example, when females were in the work place and [[ovulation|ovulating]] they were more likely to engage in sexually suggestive behaviors e.g. showing more skin; further, females who work as lap dancers earn more money when they are in the ovulating stage. This may be because the female unwittingly behaves in a more sexual way and therefore puts out more sexually suggestive cues.&lt;ref name="Frederick, D. A. 2010"&gt;Gallup Jr, G. G., &amp; Frederick, D. A. (2010). The science of sex appeal: An evolutionary perspective. Review of General Psychology, 14(3), 240.&lt;/ref&gt; There is not, however, any evidence to show that these females are aware that their actions or earnings are intrinsically linked to their [[menstrual cycle]].

== 21st century==

The rise of the media, advertising and film industries as well as the growth of the fashion industry are all contributing factors to increase sexually suggestive content in an every-day setting. There are far more displays of sexually suggestive  behavior in modern-day life than there ever has been before and not just within advertising. The idea that [[sex sells]] is evident in many aspects of daily modern life particularly within social media and film where [[female sexual ornaments]] are a focal point. For example, many films include additional sex scenes and sexually suggestive female characters regardless of the film’s narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Benshoff, H. M., &amp; Griffin, S. (2011). America on film: Representing race, class, gender, and sexuality at the movies. John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barlow, D. H. (1986). Causes of sexual dysfunction: The role of anxiety and cognitive interference. Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 54(2), 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

The progression of the Internet and social media means that sexual content is far more available and accessible in the 21st century than ever before. This has a knock on effect on people’s [[sexualization]] and [[sexual behavior]]. Children’s sexuality develops at an earlier age if they have been exposed to more sexual content when young. For example, young adolescents engage in more sexual behaviors if they have been exposed to more sexual content in the media or on television.&lt;ref&gt;Lenhart, A. (2009). Teens and Sexting: How and why minor teens are sending sexually suggestive nude or nearly nude images via text messaging.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Strasburger, V. C. (1995). Adolescents and the media: medical and psychological impact. Sage Publications, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; On average, females become [[puberty|pubescent]] earlier in their development if they have been exposed to sexual content or sexual behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, L. M., &amp; Rivadeneyra, R. (1999). Contributions of entertainment television to adolescents’ sexual attitudes and expectations: The role of viewing amount versus viewer involvement. Journal of Sex Research, 36(3), 237-249.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, J. D. (2002). Mass media influences on sexuality. Journal of Sex Research, 39(1), 42-45.&lt;/ref&gt; Most psychologists agree that this physical display of sexuality is due to evolutionary reasons and that girls develop their sexuality (e.g. behaving sexually suggestively) at an earlier age in order to [[sexual competition|sexually compete]] with other women and in order [[reproductive success|successfully reproduce]].&lt;ref&gt;Malamuth, N. M. (1996). Sexually explicit media, gender differences, and evolutionary theory. Journal of Communication, 46(3), 8-31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris, R. J., &amp; Scott, C. L. (Eds.) (2002). Media Effects: Advances in Theory and Research. New Jersey: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Misinterpretation==

The increase in sexual content in modern society often results in a more nonchalant approach to sexually suggestive behavior.  People, predominantly women, often act in a way that they themselves do not consider to be sexually suggestive but which can be misinterpreted by others.&lt;ref&gt;Stockdale, M. S. (1993). The Role of Sexual Misperceptions of Women′ s Friendliness in an Emerging Theory of Sexual Harassment. Journal of Vocational Behavior, 42(1), 84-101.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Synovitz, L. B., &amp; Byrne, T. J. (1998). Antecedents of sexual victimization: Factors discriminating victims from non-victims. Journal of American College Health, 46(4), 151-158.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, wearing clothes or skirts/shorts that show skin is not something that most Western women would consider to be overtly provocative but it is still regarded as sexually suggestive by others. Misconstruing people’s behaviour can have disastrous consequences, contributing to [[harassment]] and [[rape culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Thornhill, R., &amp; Thornhill, N. W. (1983). Human rape: An evolutionary analysis. Ethology and Sociobiology, 4(3), 137-173.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koukounas, E., &amp; Letch, N. M. (2001). Psychological correlates of perception of sexual intent in women. The Journal of social psychology, 141(4), 443-456.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Evolutionary psychology]] explains that this misinterpretation is the result of [[sexual selection]]. Men have adapted through sexual selection to have the maximum number of offspring possible, and therefore exhibit certain behaviors that facilitate maximum reproduction. Men perceive sexually suggestive behavior and other sexual cues, including [[biological ornament]]s, as signs of reproductive ability and willingness.&lt;ref&gt;Clutton-Brock, T. (2007). Sexual selection in males and females. Science, 318(5858), 1882-1885.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[hypothesis]] of [[rape]] as an [[adaption]] states that the rape of reproductive-age females was favoured by [[directional selection|direct selection]] in order to increase the chance of [[reproductive success]].&lt;ref&gt;Thornhill, R., &amp; Palmer, C. T. (2001). A Natural History of Rape. MIT press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, C. T. (1991). Human rape: Adaptation or by‐product?. Journal of Sex Research, 28(3), 365-386.&lt;/ref&gt; Sexually suggestive behavior and biological ornamentation are signs of [[sexual maturity]] and thus females who display more of these behaviors, or who have more obvious ornamentation, are more likely to be at a higher risk of harassment, or even rape.&lt;ref&gt;McKibbin, W. F., Shackelford, T. K., Goetz, A. T., &amp; Starratt, V. G. (2008). Why do men rape? An evolutionary psychological perspective. Review of General Psychology, 12(1), 86.&lt;/ref&gt; This evolutionary explanation also extends to women. At their most fertile stage in their [[menstrual cycle]], during [[estrus]], women are far less likely to engage in rape-risky behaviors such as walking alone late at night, than women who are in the least fertile stage of their menstrual cycle, the [[menstrual cycle|luteal phase]] or women using [[hormonal contraception]].&lt;ref&gt;Chavanne, T. J., &amp; Gallup, G. G. (1998). Variation in risk taking behavior among female college students as a function of the menstrual cycle. Evolution and Human Behavior, 19(1), 27-32.&lt;/ref&gt; This is because women who are in the luteal phase or women using a hormonal contraceptive are much less likely to become pregnant after sexual intercourse than estrus women are.&lt;ref&gt;Gangestad, S. W., &amp; Thornhill, R. (2008). Human oestrus. Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences, 275(1638), 991-1000.&lt;/ref&gt;

These evolutionary explanations serve only to increase the psychological understanding of sexual behaviors. Sexual suggestiveness, rape, and all other sexual behaviors, are proven to be products of past evolution. In the case of rape, however, just because it is natural does not make it acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;Thornhill, R., &amp; Palmer, C. T. (2000). A Natural History of Rape. MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thornhill, R. (1998). Biology of Human Rape, The. Jurimetrics, 39, 137.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thornhill, R., &amp; Palmer, C. T. (2002). Rape and evolution: a reply to our critics. Psychology, Evolution &amp; Gender, 4(3), 283-296.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Flirting ==
[[Flirting]] can be sexually suggestive, which can intentionally elicit a [[sexual arousal|sexual response]] from another person.&lt;ref name=Henni2004 /&gt; Research has identified different motivations for engaging in flirting behaviors. There is flirting with a sexual motivation, which is done with a view to engaging in [[sexual behavior|Human sexual activity]] and there is also flirting with a fun motivation, in which the interaction itself is the pleasurable part.&lt;ref name=Henni2004 /&gt; An instrumental motivation of flirting behavior is flirting performed in order to accomplish an instrumental goal, such as getting someone to buy you a drink. However, flirting can sometimes lead to unintentional responses. If the motivation behind sexually suggestive behavior is misinterpreted or miscommunicated, then a sexual response could be elicited where it is not wanted. If escalated, this can lead to [[sexual harassment]] in the workplace or sexual coercion in a relationship.&lt;ref name=Rich1999 /&gt; In line with evolutionary explanations of sexually suggestive behavior, research has shown that females are more likely to consider the use of flirting as being for relational purposes, and males are more likely to interpret female flirting as having a sexual motivation.&lt;ref name=Henni2004&gt;Henningsen, D. D. (2004). Flirting with Meaning: An Examination of Miscommunication in Flirting Interactions, Sex Roles, 50, (7), pp 481-489&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rich1999&gt;Richman, J. A., et al. (1999) Sexual Harassment and Generalized Workplace Abuse Among University Employees: Prevalence and Mental Health Correlates. ''Journal of American Health'', 89, (3), pp358-363&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender differences==

There are some reported gender differences between how sexual suggestiveness is perceived. Males and females have different thresholds for the perception of sexual suggestiveness or intent. Males are, in general, more sexually occupied than females. To support this assumption research shows that males perceive people as more interested in a sexual encounter than females do.&lt;ref&gt;Shotland, R. L., &amp; Craig, J. M. (1988). Can men and women differentiate between friendly and sexually interested behavior?. Social Psychology Quarterly, 66-73.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that males find it difficult to differentiate between [[Like#As a verb|liking]], [[love]] and sexual intent, and in this case sexual suggestiveness. Unfortunately, this difficulty in separation between the two from the male’s point of view may lead to rape or other [[sexual assault]]. During the evolution of [[human sexuality]], the fact that females are the choosy gender meant that males who were able to quickly detect a female's willingness were the males who passed along their [[genes]] effectively. In light of this, males, therefore, tend to read sexual acceptance signals in friendly actions even when this may not be the females intention.&lt;ref&gt;Thornhill, R., &amp; Palmer, C. T. (2000). Why men rape. The Sciences, 40(1), 30-36. Chicago&lt;/ref&gt; Females are however better at reading platonic signals from the opposite sex and at differentiating between liking, loving and sexual suggestiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Abbey, A. (1982). "Sex Differences in Attributions for Friendly Behavior: Do Males Misperceive Females' Friendliness?" Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 42:830-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also gender differences between how sexual suggestiveness is displayed via flirting. Recent research has shown that females are more likely than males to flirt with the intention of developing a new relationship,&lt;ref&gt;Messman, S. J., Canary, D. J., &amp; Hause, R. S. (2000). Motives to remain platonic, equity and the use of maintenance strategies in opposite sex friendships. Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 17, 67-94.&lt;/ref&gt; or with the intention of intensifying an existing relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Downey, J. L., Damhave, K. W. (1991) The effect of place, type of comment and effort expended on the perception of flirtation. Journal of Social Behavior and Personality, 6, 35-43&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been found that females use flirting as a way of assessing the interest of a potential mate; as the end result is sexual activity, it can be inferred that this is a sexually suggestive act.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, M. M., &amp; Butler, D. I. (1989). Predictive aspects of non-verbal courtship behavior in women. Semiotica, 76, 205-215&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, a variety of different researchers have found that males are significantly more sexually motivated in their displays of sexual suggestiveness (such as flirting) than females.&lt;ref&gt;Henningsen, D. D. (2004). Flirting with meaning: An examination of miscommunication in flirting interactions. Sex Roles, 50(7-8), 481-489&lt;/ref&gt; The research done by Clark and Hatfield (1989)&lt;ref&gt;Clark, R. D., &amp; Hatfield, E. (1989). Gender differences in awareness of courtship initiation tactics. Sex Roles, 32, 717-734.&lt;/ref&gt; supports these assumptions by clearly suggesting that female courtship is motivated by relationship development and that male courtship is motivated by sexual desire. It is these gender differences that can explain the potential miscommunication of social actions.

==Cultural differences==

Since the 1990s there has a been a dramatic increase in the understanding of human sexuality from an [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary perspective]].&lt;ref&gt;Buss, D. (2015). Evolutionary psychology: The new science of the mind. Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionary theory proposes that humans all behave in the same way, in order to maximise survival and [[reproductive success]].&lt;ref name="Frederick, D. A. 2010"/&gt; However, as with much of human behavior, there are substantial differences in the sexual suggestiveness of people from different cultures. What may be a culturally appropriate display of 'sexiness' in one culture may be considered inappropriate in another, and vice versa.&lt;ref name="Frederick, D. A. 2010"/&gt; For example, in many Westernized cultures women displaying their bare legs in public is considered to be a relatively unassuming display of suggestiveness, while in many African societies, for example, the same behavior would be considered immodest. It can be argued that religion is a significant factor in the cultural differences of sexual suggestiveness, especially with regards to what displays of suggestiveness are considered appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;Melman, B. (2016). Women’s Orients: English Women and the Middle East, 1718–1918: Sexuality, Religion and Work. Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, some [[Christianity|Christian]] and [[Islam|Muslim]] communities are more strict on what levels of suggestiveness are appropriate for unmarried young women.

==In the media ==

===General===
A considerable amount of research has concluded that sexually suggestive content is pervasive in the media. The most common type of sexually suggestive content in adolescent programming is in the form of a sexual [[innuendo]]. Sexual [[innuendo]]es give a suggestive alternative meaning to an otherwise neutral phrase. For example, the use of the phrase "bend over backwards" when describing a colleague, in the sitcom ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'', is used by the main character Barney to imply something in both a figurative sense (i.e. that she is willing to work hard) and a suggestive sense (alluding to her flexibility in sexual positions). Content analyses of sexual behavior in the media found that sexual content on television has risen from 45% in 1975 to 81% now.&lt;ref name=kunkel1999&gt;Kunkel, D., Cope, K., Farinola, W., Biely, E., Rollin, E., &amp; Donnerstein, E. (1999). Sex on TE.' A biennial report to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 2001. Menlo Park, CA: The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; 83% of all programs on television contain sexual content.&lt;ref name=pardun2005&gt;Pardun, C.J., L’Engle, K.L., &amp; Brown, J.D. (2005). Linking exposure to outcomes: Early adolescents’ consumption of sexual content in six media. Mass Communication &amp; Society, 8(2), 75-91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=collins2004&gt;Collins, R.L., Elliott, M. N., Berry, S. H. et al. (2004). Watching sex on television predicts adolescent initiation of sexual Behavior. Pediatrics. 114(3). Available at: www.pediatrics.org/cgi/content/full/114/3/e280&lt;/ref&gt; 80% of programs contain sexually suggestive references, and 49% of shows contain sexual behavior which include flirting.&lt;ref name=kunkel1999 /&gt; Sexual [[innuendo]]es occur as much as twice per program in popular American sitcoms, whilst flirting occurred at least once per programme.&lt;ref name=pardun2005 /&gt; The use of sexual [[innuendo]]es in the media is also done through newspapers, magazines and music, and accounts for roughly 12% of the entire sexual content shown in the media overall.&lt;ref name=pardun2005 /&gt;  Analysis of sexually suggestive behavior in sports media showed that there was considerable gender differences in how sports stars are portrayed visually.&lt;ref name=clavio2011&gt;Clavio, G., Eagleman, A. N. (2011). Gender and Sexually Suggestive Images in Sports Blogs. Journal of Sport Management, 7, 295-304&lt;/ref&gt; For example, females are photographed nude more frequently than men, and were photographed in a ''hetero-sexy'' manner which was done to attract the [[male gaze]], such as with sports equipment covering their genitalia due to its suggestive nature.&lt;ref name=clavio2011 /&gt; Overall, females are portrayed in a manner that alludes to their status as a [[sex symbol]].

Sexual content in the form of [[innuendo]], suggestive imagery and [[double entendre]] is used as a tool in advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Courtney, A., Whipple, T. (1983). Sex Stereotyping in Advertising (Lexington, MA: Heath)&lt;/ref&gt; Suggestive advertising is used to draw in attention,&lt;ref name=reichert2004&gt;Reichert, T. Carpenter, C. (2004). An update on sex in magazine advertising: 1983 to 2003. Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly, 81(4), 823-837&lt;/ref&gt; by monopolizing attentional resources, and as a means of distinguishing their products from similar products which are usually advertised in the same medium (such as in the same magazine).&lt;ref name=reichert2004 /&gt; Furthermore, advertisers use sexually suggestive material to imply an association between their product and benefits which are in some way related to sex (such as mate attraction).&lt;ref name=reichert2000&gt;Reichert, T. Ramirez, A. (2000) "Defining Sexually Oriented Appeals in Advertising: a Grounded Theory Investigation". Association for Consumer Research, 27, 267-273.&lt;/ref&gt; There was a significant increase in the amount of advertisements from 1983 to 2003 which used sexually suggestive images of models,&lt;ref name=reichert2004 /&gt; suggesting that advertisers are finding it beneficial. While the physical properties of the model are the most sexually suggestive, a number of non-verbal communicative features have also been identified as being provocative, such as the models pose (plumped lips, cocked head to show the neck) as well as verbal communicative features such as suggestive comments.&lt;ref name=reichert2000 /&gt;

=== Effects ===
A number of studies have looked at the effects of sexual content in the media on [[preadolescent]] and [[adolescent]] sexual development. It has been put forth that watching a high level of television, in which there is a lot of sexually suggestive behavior, can lead to the initiation of sexual intercourse at a younger age than those who watch the least amount of sexually suggestive programming.&lt;ref name=collins2004 /&gt; In addition to this, adolescents who had been exposed to a high level of sexual content, would engage in a level of sexual activity expected by those up to three years older who watched less sexual content.&lt;ref name=collins2004 /&gt; It has been suggested that according to [[social learning theory]], television is a method by which children can acquire behaviors, through observational learning,&lt;ref&gt;Bandura, A., Ross, D., Ross, S.A. (1963). Imitation of film-mediated aggressive models. J Abnorm Soc Psychol, 66, 3–11&lt;/ref&gt; and that this is a potential method through which children are becoming increasingly sexualized.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, J. L., Sorsoli, C. L., Collins, K., Zylbergold, B. A., Schooler, D., &amp; Tolman, D. L. (2007). From sex to sexuality: Exposing the heterosexual script on primetime network television. Journal of Sex Research, 44, 145 – 157&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sexually transmitted infection]]s (STIs) and [[pregnancy]] in the U.S are more common among adolescents who begin sexual activity earlier, demonstrating that earlier sexualization, for which sexually suggestive content in the media has been implicated, has far reaching effects.&lt;ref name=collins2004 /&gt;

Sexually suggestive content can also affect adolescents' views and attitudes towards sex, and their sexual socialization as whole. Research conducted with the [[cultivation theory]] in mind, has found that there is an association between people with a high regular exposure to sexually oriented genres (such as [[soap operas]] and [[hip-hop music]]) and more liberal attitudes towards sexual behavior like the acceptance of pre-marital sex, as well as non-relational sex and sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, L. M. (2002). Does television exposure affect emerging adults’ attitudes and assumptions about sexual relationships? Correlational and experimental confirmation. Journal of Youth and Adolescence, 31, 1–15&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, as sexual competence is portrayed as a positive attribute on television, particularly for males, regular exposure to sexual content can cause adolescents to form unrealistic expectations, and view their own sexual experiences  (or lack thereof) as negative.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, L. M. (2003). Understanding the role of entertainment media in the sexual socialization of American youth: A review of empirical research. Developmental Review, 23, 347-388&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the vast majority of this sexual content alludes to the positive nature of sex only, suggesting that sexually suggestive behavior in the media is serving to perpetuate a view that there are little negative consequences of engaging in sexual activity. Research has shown that the effects of sexually suggestive references in the media are also moderated by the developmental stage of the viewer. For example, 12 year olds have more difficulty correctly interpreting [[innuendos]] than 14 year olds.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman-Watkins, L. T.,  Sprafkin, J. N. (1983). Adolescents’ comprehension of televised sexual innuendos. Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology, 4, 359–369&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, pre-pubescent adolescents often view sexual references on television with disgust and embarrassment, whereas pubescent adolescents viewed it with interest.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, J. D., White, A. B., Nikipoulou, L. (1993). Disinterest, intrigue and resistance: Early adolescent girls’ use of sexual media content. In B. Greenberg, J. D. Brown, &amp; N.

'''Social neuroscience''' is an interdisciplinary field devoted to understanding how [[biological system]]s implement social processes and [[behavior]], and to using biological concepts and methods to inform and refine theories of social processes and behavior. [[Humans]] are fundamentally a social species, rather than individualists. As such, ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' create [[emergent organization]]s beyond the individual—structures that range from dyads, families, and groups to cities, civilizations, and cultures. These emergent structures evolved hand in hand with [[neural]] and [[hormonal]] mechanisms to support them because the consequent social behaviors helped these organisms survive, reproduce, and care for offspring sufficiently long that they too survived to reproduce. The term "social neuroscience" can be traced to a publication entitled "Social Neuroscience Bulletin" that was published quarterly between 1988 and 1994.  The term was subsequently popularized in an article by [[John Cacioppo]] and [[Gary Berntson]], published in [[the American Psychologist]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cacioppo J. T. |author2=Berntson G. G. | year = 1992 | title = Social psychological contributions to the decade of the brain: Doctrine of multilevel analysis | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 1019–1028 | doi=10.1037/0003-066x.47.8.1019 | pmid=1510329}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cacioppo and Berntson are considered as the legitimate fathers of social neuroscience. Still a young field, social [[neuroscience]] is closely related to [[affective neuroscience]] and [[cognitive neuroscience]], focusing on how the [[brain]] mediates [[social interaction]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cacioppo J. T. |author2=Berntson G. G. |author3=Decety J. | year = 2010 | title = Social neuroscience and its relation to social psychology | url = | journal = Social Cognition | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 675–684 | doi=10.1521/soco.2010.28.6.675|pmc=3883133}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biological underpinnings of [[social cognition]] are investigated in [[social cognitive neuroscience]]

==Overview==
Traditional [[neuroscience]] has for many years considered the [[nervous system]] as an isolated entity and largely ignored influences of the social environments in which humans and many animal species live. In fact, we now recognize the considerable impact of social structures on the operations of the brain and body. These social factors operate on the individual through a continuous interplay of neural, [[neuroendocrine]], [[metabolic]] and [[Immune system|immune]] factors on brain and body, in which the brain is the central regulatory organ and also a malleable target of these factors.&lt;ref&gt;Cacioppo, J. T., Berntson, G. G., &amp; Decety, J. (2011). A history of social neuroscience. In A. W. Kruglanski and [[Wolfgang Stroebe|W. Stroebe]] (Eds.), Handbook of the History of Social Psychology. New York: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Social neuroscience investigates the [[mechanism (biology)|biological mechanisms]] that underlie social processes and behavior, widely considered one of the major problem areas for the [[neuroscience]]s in the 21st century, and applies concepts and methods of [[biology]] to develop [[scientific theories|theories]] of social processes and behavior in the social and [[behavioral sciences]]. Social neuroscience capitalizes on biological concepts and methods to inform and refine theories of social behavior, and it uses social and behavioral constructs and data to advance theories of neural organization and function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cacioppo J.T.| year = 2007 | title = Social neuroscience: progress and implications for mental health | url = | journal = Perspectives on Psychological Science | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 99–123 |display-authors=etal | doi=10.1111/j.1745-6916.2007.00032.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cacioppo J. T. |author2=Decety J. | year = 2011 | title = Social neuroscience: challenges and opportunities in the study of complex behavior | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1224| issue = | pages = 162–173| doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2010.05858.x | pmid=21251011 | pmc=3098127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout most of the 20th century, social and biological explanations were widely viewed as incompatible. But advances in recent years have led to the development of a new approach synthesized from the social and biological sciences. The new field of social neuroscience emphasizes the complementary relationship between the different levels of organization, spanning the social and biological domains (e.g., [[Molecular biology|molecular]], [[Cellular biology|cellular]], [[Systems biology|system]], person, relational, collective, societal) and the use of multi-level analyses to foster understanding of the mechanisms underlying the human mind and behavior.

==Methods==
A number of methods are used in social neuroscience to investigate the confluence of [[nervous system|neural]] and social processes. These methods draw from behavioral techniques developed in [[social psychology]], [[cognitive psychology]], and [[neuropsychology]], and are associated with a variety of neurobiological techniques including [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), [[magnetoencephalography]] (MEG), [[positron emission tomography]] (PET), [[facial electromyography]] (EMG), [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS), [[electroencephalography]] (EEG), [[event-related potential]]s (ERPs), [[electrocardiogram]]s, [[electromyogram]]s, [[endocrinology]], [[immunology]], [[galvanic skin response]] (GSR), single-cell recording, and studies of [[Ataxia#Focal lesions|focal brain lesion]] patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Adolphs R | year = 2003 | title = Investigating the cognitive neuroscience of social behavior | url = | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 119–126 | doi=10.1016/s0028-3932(02)00142-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cacioppo, J.T., &amp; Berntson, G.G. (2009), Handbook of Neuroscience for the Behavioral Science. New York: John Wiley and Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harmon-Jones, E., &amp; Beer, J.S. (2009). Methods in Social Neuroscience. New York: The Guilford Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ward, J. (2012). The Student's Guide to Social Neuroscience. New York: Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Subbaraju et al"&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=European Journal of Neuroscience|year=2017 |title= Identification of lateralized compensatory neural activities within the social brain due to autism spectrum disorder in adolescent males |author= Subbaraju V, Sundaram S, Narasimhan S |doi=10.1111/ejn.13634}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animal models are also important to investigate the putative role of specific brain structures, circuits, or processes (e.g., the [[reward system]] and [[drug addiction]]). In addition, quantitative meta-analyses are important to move beyond idiosyncrasies of individual studies, and neurodevelopmental investigations can contribute to our understanding of brain-behavior associations.&lt;ref&gt;de Haan, M., &amp; Gunnar, M.R. (2009). Handbook of Developmental Social Neuroscience. The Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Decety J. |author2=Cacioppo T.T. | year = 2010 | title = Frontiers in human neuroscience, the golden triangle, and beyond | url = | journal = Perspectives on Psychological Science | volume = 5 | issue = 6| pages = 767–771 | doi=10.1177/1745691610388780| pmc=3904345}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two most popular forms of methods used in social neuroscience are fMRI and EEG. fMRI are very cost efficient and high in spatial resolution. However, they are low in temporal resolution and therefore, are best to discover pathways in the brain that are used during social experiments. fMRI have low temporal resolution (timing) because they read oxygenated blood levels that pool to the parts of the brain that are activated and need more oxygen. Thus, the blood takes time to travel to the part of the brain being activated and in reverse provides a lower ability to test for exact timing of activation during social experiments. EEG is best used when a researcher is trying to brain map a certain area that correlates to a [[social construct]] that is being studied. EEGs provide high temporal resolution but low spatial resolution. In which, the timing of the activation is very accurate but it is hard to pinpoint exact areas on the brain, researchers are to narrow down locations and areas but they also create a lot of "noise". Most recently, researchers have been using TMS which is the best way to discover the exact location in the process of brain mapping. This machine can turn on and off parts of the brain which then allows researchers to test what that part of the brain is used for during social events. However, this machine is so expensive that it is rarely used.

Note: Most of these methods can only provide correlations between brain mapping and social events (apart from TMS), a con of Social Neuroscience is that the research must be interpreted through correlations which can cause a decreased content validity. For example, during an experiment when a participant is doing a task to test for a social theory and a part of the brain is activated, it is impossible to form causality because anything else in the room or the thoughts of the person could have triggered that response. It is very hard to isolate these variables during these experiments. That is why self-reports are very important. This will also help decrease the chances of VooDoo correlations (correlations that are too high and over 0.8 which look like a correlation exists between two factors but actually is just an error in design and statistical measures). Another way to avoid this con, is to use tests with hormones which can infer causality. For example, when people are given oxytocin and placebos and we can test their differences in social behavior between other people. Using SCRs will also help isolate unconscious thoughts and conscious thoughts because it is the body's natural parasympathetic response to the outside world. All of these tests and devices will help social neuroscientists discover the connections in the brain that are used to carry out our everyday social activities.

Primarily [[psychology|psychological]] methods include performance-based measures that record response time and/or accuracy,&lt;ref&gt;Ward, J. (2012). The Student's Guide to Social Neuroscience. New York: Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[Implicit Association Test]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Greenwald A. G. |author2=McGhee D. E. |author3=Schwartz J. L. K. | year = 1998 | title = Measuring individual differences in implicit cognition: The Implicit Association Test | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 74 | issue = | pages = 1464–1480 | doi =  10.1037/0022-3514.74.6.1464}}&lt;/ref&gt; observational measures such as preferential looking in infant studies; and, self-report measures, such as questionnaire and interviews.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, J. (2012). The Student's Guide to Social Neuroscience. New York: Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Neurobiological methods can be grouped together into ones that measure more external bodily responses, electrophysiological methods, hemodynamic measures, and lesion methods. 
Bodily response methods include GSR (also known as skin conductance response (SCR)), facial EMG, and the eyeblink startle response. Electrophysiological methods include single-cell recordings, EEG, and ERPs. Hemodynamic measures, which, instead of directly measuring neural activity, measure changes in blood flow, include PET and fMRI. Lesion methods traditionally study brains that have been damaged via natural causes, such as strokes, traumatic injuries, tumors, neurosurgery, infection, or neurodegenerative disorders. In its ability to create a type of 'virtual lesion' that is temporary, TMS may also be included in this category. More specifically, TMS methods involve stimulating one area of the brain to isolate it from the rest of the brain, imitating a brain lesion. This is particularly helpful in brain mapping, a key approach in social neuroscience designed to determine which areas of the brain are activated during certain activities.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, J. (2012).

While [[animal testing on rodents|rodent studies]] of gene expression predominately measure the consequences of depriving the animals of sensory experiences, a study has also been conducted measuring the consequences of enriching animal sensory experiences on prefrontal cortex development, via tactile stimulation by researchers for 45 minutes per day for the approximately first two weeks of life.  What was discovered was that infants, who received additional tactile stimulation exhibited greater motor performance and spatial learning, in addition to enhanced cerebral cortex synaptic organization, in adulthood, than infants who did not receive additional tactile stimulation.  These findings reinforce the significance of tactile stimulation in early stages of postnatal development and neurogenesis for rodent models.  Because non-human animal studies typically concern either, the presence and absence of parents, or the presence and absence of tactile stimulation, the findings of animal studies on gene expression are likely more comparable to human cases of neglect, as opposed to physical or sexual abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Kolb et al., [http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/10/04/1121251109.long "Experience and the developing prefrontal cortex"], "PNAS", 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society for Social Neuroscience==
A dinner to discuss the challenges and opportunities in the interdisciplinary field of social neuroscience at the [[Society for Neuroscience]] meeting ([[Chicago]], November 2009) resulted in a series of meetings led by [[John Cacioppo]] and [[Jean Decety]] with social neuroscientists, [[psychologists]], [[neuroscientist]]s, [[psychiatrists]] and [[neurologist]]s in [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Chile]], [[China]], [[Colombia]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Israel]], [[Japan]], the [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]], [[Singapore]], [[South Korea]], [[Taiwan]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]]. Social neuroscience was defined broadly as the interdisciplinary study of the neural, hormonal, cellular, and genetic mechanisms underlying the emergent structures that define social species. Thus, among the participants in these meetings were scientists who used a wide variety of methods in studies of animals as well as humans, and patients as well as normal participants. The consensus also emerged that a Society for Social Neuroscience should be established to give scientists from diverse disciplines and perspectives the opportunity to meet, communicate with, and benefit from the work of each other. The international, interdisciplinary [[Society for social neuroscience]] (http://S4SN.org) was launched at the conclusion of these consultations in [[Auckland]], New Zealand on 20 January 2010, and the inaugural meeting for the Society was held on November 12, 2010, the day prior to the 2010 Society for Neuroscience meeting ([[San Diego]], CA).

==History==
The Railway Educational Bureau can trace its roots back to the [[Union Pacific Railroad]]. Union Pacific's president, [[Edward Henry Harriman]] hired D. C. Buell to develop training materials for the railroad. Buell was later appointed the Director of Union Pacific's Educational Bureau of Information. Within a few years Buell and the Union Pacific realized other railroads could benefit by the training programs it developed. The division was spun off as The Railway Educational Bureau and Buell later became the owner. The Railway Educational Bureau was purchased from the Buell estate by [[Simmons-Boardman Publishing Corporation]] in 1968.

Constantly being revised since its first being completed, the series seek to bridge the gap between brevity and scholarly comment.

==Reviews==
{{quote|The ''Tyndale New Testament Commentaries'' are designed for the frequently-targeted well-read layperson, but many pastors profit as well. The series is conservative but focuses most attention on explaining the meaning of the text with minimal interaction with the voluminous secondary literature. Originally based on the AV/KJV, with Greek and Hebrew transliterated and explained, the series is being rewritten based on the RSV or NIV (at the individual author's discretion), and space is being assigned more equitably. Several of the volumes of this new edition are, within the constraints of the series, outstanding (e.g., Marshall on Acts). |[[D. A.

The '''University of Guadalajara''' ({{lang-es|Universidad de Guadalajara}}) is a [[public university|public]] [[higher education]] institution in the [[Mexico|Mexican]] city of [[Guadalajara]]. The University has several high schools as well as graduate and undergraduate campuses, which are distributed all over the state of [[Jalisco]], Mexico. It is regarded as the most significant university in the state and the second in the country, only behind the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]]. Chronologically, based on its foundation, is the second oldest in Mexico, the seventeenth in North America and the fourteenth in Latin America.

Since 1994 the University works through a network model to organize its academic activities. This university network is integrated by 15 university centers, the '''Virtual University System''', the '''High School Education System''' and the general administrative body of the University. During 2014–2015 the total number of enrolled students is 255, 944, of which 116, 424 belong to graduate and undergraduate students and 139, 520 to high school students.

== History ==

=== The Royal University of Guadalajara (1791–1821) ===
[[File:Escudo de la Real y Literaria Universidad de Guadalajara.svg|thumb|left|Royal University of Guadalajara's Coat of Arms]]
At the time of its foundation in 1586 College began offering higher education in [[Guadalajara]], and as a result it was the first institution that granted academic degrees. The first one who requested to establish a university in Guadalajara was Friar Felipe Galindo y Chavez who, in 1696, asked the King [[Charles II of Spain]] to increase the range of the recently founded Royal Seminary of San Jose. This way, a long century of arrangements to found the '''University of Guadalajara''' began. Chronologically, the second oldest in Mexico, the seventeenth in North America and the fourteenth in Latin America.

The proposition of Friar Felipe was reconsidered by the lawyer Matias Angel de la Mota Padilla, who, in 1750, was able to involve the [[Guadalajara]]'s city hall into the project. However, it was only after the banishment of all Company of Jesus' members from all Spain's territories in 1767, when the need of a university in the region of [[Nueva Galicia]] was relevant. This occurred because the Company of Jesus managed the two most important colleges in the city: the Santo Tomas College and the San Juan Bautista College. Moreover, on December 12, 1771 arrived to Guadalajara the new bishop to [[Nueva Galicia]], Friar Antonio Alcalde y Barriga, who significantly supported the foundation of the University. In 1775 the Friar replied a grit from King [[Charles III of Spain]], who consulted him about the convenience of establishing a university in [[Nueva Galicia]]. The answer of the Friar was completely positive, so on November 18, 1791 the King [[Charles IV of Spain]] enacted a royal grit where he proclaim the foundation of the '''Royal University of Guadalajara'''.

This grit arrived to the authorities in [[Nueva Galicia]] on March 26, 1792, who proceeded to celebrate and quickly revamp the said Santo Tomas College. Therefore, the University was founded on November 3, 1792. By mutual agreement between the Friar Alcalde and the president of the Royal Audience, Jacobo Ugarte de Loyola, Jose Maria Gomez y Villaseñor was named as the first Rector of the University. Academically speaking, the University was first composed by the Art, Theology, Law and Medicine Faculties.

=== The Confrontation between the University of Guadalajara and the Institute of Sciences of the Jalisco State (1821–1861) ===
The University adhered itself to the [[Agustin de Iturbide]]'s [[Plan of Iguala]], with which the [[Mexican War of Independence|Independence of Mexico]] was concluded, as a result the university kept its royal status. However, it came to be imperial when the [[first Mexican Empire]] of Agustin I was proclaimed, but then when the Republic was established it became a national university.

On January 16, 1826, during the administration of Jose Cesareo de la Rosa as the Rector, the [[Jalisco]] State Congress proclaimed the first enclosed order to the '''University of Guadalajara''' and then the State's Governor, Prisciliano Sanchez Padilla, reestablish the Institute of Sciences. However, on September 1, 1834 the State's Governor, José Antonio Romero, declared the first reopening of the University and the closing of the Institute of Sciences. Nevertheless, thirteen years later, in 1847, the State Congress proclaimed the Public Teaching Program by which the '''University of Guadalajara''' as well as the San Juan Bautista College would be closed, furthermore it'd also reestablish the Institute of Sciences and found two high schools, namely the Boys' Lyceum and the Ladies' Lyceum. Yet the Program was not executed since Mariano Hurtado convinced the State's Governor, Joaquin Angulo, not to do so. As a result, in that same year it was proclaimed that the Institute of Sciences and the '''University of Guadalajara''' would coexist, although the later would lose its finances and headquarters. Fortunately, a later State's Governor, Jose Maria Yañez Carillo, proclaimed 1853 the assimilation of the Institute of Sciences into the '''University of Guadalajara''', so the later recovered its traditional patrimony.

At the time the [[Plan of Ayutla]] got the triumph around 1855, the State's Governor, Jose Santos Degollado proclaimed the second enclosed order to the University and the reestablishment of the Institute of Sciences. However, during the [[Reform War]], on February 2, 1859 the Governor and Commander of the [[Jalisco]] State, Leonardo Marquez, reestablish the '''University of Guadalajara'''.

Despite that, following the military success of the liberal wing in 1860, the State's Governor, Pedro Ogazon, proclaimed the third enclosed order to the University which also proclaimed the reestablishment of the Institute of Sciences, the Boys' Lyceum and the Ladies' Lyceum.

=== The University Interregnum (1861–1925) ===
During this period the higher and high school education both came to be totally dominated by the Government of Jalisco which triggered the emergence of private schools. Besides, the Medicine, Law and Engineering Schools, as well as the Boys' Lyceum and the Ladies' Lyceum continued teaching higher and high school education as a result of the governmental support that they received, except from some governors as Ramon Corona and Manuel Macario Dieguez, since the later closed the Lyceums and founded the '''High School of Jalisco''' in 1914.

=== The University of Guadalajara (1925–1989) ===
[[File:Explanada dv.jpg|thumb|University of Guadalajara's General Rectory Building]]
Derived from the worries that many intellectuals and artists manifested in the reunions at the "Centro Bohemio", the conference given by the engineer Juan Salvador Agraz Ramirez de Prado about a project to establish the '''"National University of Guadalajara"''' and the new orientations that the [[Mexican Revolution]] brought about in 1910, the [[Jalisco]] State's Governor, Jose Guadalupe Zuno Hernandez, reopened the '''University of Guadalajara''' by third time in 1925 and named Enrique Diaz de Leon as its Rector. Therefore, the study plans for high schools and faculties, as well as the Organic Law were elaborated and then approved by the State Congress on September 7, 1925. In the first meeting of the University Council the motto of the University was chosen: '''“Piensa y Trabaja" (Think and Work)'''.

In the First Congress of Universities that took place at [[Mexico City]], the Rector Diaz de Leon supported the socialist education, but when he tried to carry it out in [[Guadalajara]], several student's protests happened. As a result of the protests the Governor, Sebastian Allende decided to close the '''University of Guadalajara''' again. However, to prevent the [[Universidad Autónoma de Guadalajara|Autonomous University of Guadalajara]] to take the historic name of '''University of Guadalajara''', the State Congress reopened the University and named Constancio Hernandez Alvirde as its twenty ninth Rector.

=== The Jalisco University Network (1989–present) === 
During this period the need to create a modern, efficient, qualified and ecofriendly university was recognized, however, this meant a change in the academic and administrative structure of the university would be necessary. This purposes were established in the Institutional Development Programme: A Future Vision, presented in 1989 by the Rector Raul Padilla Lopez, who is regarded for accomplishing the modernization the University. In this document, the aims and programs of all, teaching, researching and extension areas were established, which were based on a series of projected indicators to 1995.

Additionally, on September 2, 1989 the General University Council approved the document “Bases for the discussion about the Reform of the University of Guadalajara”, which had a current diagnostic about the University and proposed to decentralize the services and functions of the institution all across its entities. Also, some elements as the updating and creation of study plans, the expansion of research and graduate studies, the promotion of cultural and sports activities as well as the diversification of its financial funds were presented in the document. This reform took place when the State Congress approved the new Organic Law of the '''University of Guadalajara'''. In this, the autonomy of the University in matters as the academic planning and the financial administration was acknowledged. In that same year the thematic and regional university campuses were created and the '''High School Education System''' was established.

Moreover, the Labor Union of the Academic Workers of the University of Guadalajara was created and the Labor Union of University Workers got enhanced, the Union of University Students was established as well. Among other changes derived from the creation of the '''University Network''', it is important to mention the creation of the '''Virtual University System''' and the '''University System of Radio, Television and Cinematography'''.

In 2014, with Itzcoatl Tonatiuh Bravo Padilla as the Rector of the University, the Institutional Development Programme was updated with projections to 2030. Besides, the arrangements to build a new regional university campus located in [[Zapotlanejo]], [[Jalisco]] began.  At present the '''University Network''' is located in each region of [[Jalisco]] and has campuses in 109 of 125 municipalities in the State.

A '''visionary environment''' or '''fantasy world''' is an extensive/large-scale artistic installations (buildings, sculpture parks, etc.) intended to capture intense subjective/personal experiences (dreams, fantasies, obsessions, etc.) of their creators. The subjective/personal nature of these projects often implies a marginal status for the artists involved, and there is a strong association between visionary environments and [[outsider art]].

'''[[Canada]]''' shares many of the concerns particularly prevalent in the developed and developing world about the current and future roles of '''[[women in computing]]''', especially as these occupations increase in importance. As in much of the world where [[computing]] and information technology is a large industry, women have historically faced underrepresentation in education and industry. As a result, some Canadian women pursuing careers in these fields have had a lack of [[role model]]s and faced [[sexism]]. There are many institutions and initiatives in Canada, however, which seek to increase representation for women in computing fields, as well as the fields of [[natural science]] and [[engineering]] in general.

==Inequalities==

===In education===
As is typical in North America, the enrollment for women in computing disciplines at the post-secondary level is significantly lower than for males. According to [[Statistics Canada]], in 2009, there were 33,219 students nationwide enrolled in "Mathematics, computer and information sciences", with only 9,075 of them being women (27%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University enrolment by field of study and gender|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/100714/t100714a2-eng.htm|work=Statistics Canada|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is significantly lower than 3 years earlier (2005/2006), when the percentage of women was 37%. The fact that, in general, the enrollment of women in computer science and related disciplines is actually declining is mirrored in the US.&lt;ref name="mainarticle"&gt;See the main article on [[women in computing]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Another summary published by Statistics Canada shows that this trend is not recent; between 1992 and 2007, the number of annual female university graduates in computer science has remained roughly constant (with a slight increase between 2000 and 2004), whereas the number of male graduates has increased approximately 50% (with the 2004 value almost double that of the 1992 value).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trends in University Graduation, 1992 to 2007|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/81-004-x/2009005/article/11050-eng.htm|work=Statistics Canada|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relatively speaking, there were about twice as many male graduates as female in 1992, and three times as many in 2007.

A study looking at enrollment based on program and gender was done at the [[University of Waterloo]] in 2010, and the results were especially egregious (even compared to the nationwide statistics from the previous year). At Waterloo, the percentage of the undergraduate population in computer science that were women was only 11.5%, with a slight increase at the Master's (18.4%) and PhD (17.1%) levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Where the boys are and aren't|url=https://uwaterloo.ca/alumni/alumni-publications/waterloo-magazine/where-boys-are-and-arent|work=University of Waterloo Magazine|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waterloo, being one of the only universities in Canada to have a higher percentage of male students than female, is an extreme example, but the trend is constant across many computer science departments in the country.

===In the workforce===
As of 2011, the GDP of the Canadian Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) sector was $62.7 billion, and grew at an annualized rate of 3.8% between 2002 and 2011 compared to 1.9% for the overall economy, reflecting the importance of the industry in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ICT Sector Gross Domestic Product (GDP)|url=http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/ict-tic.nsf/eng/h_it05864.html|work=Industry Canada|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this importance, the percentage of women working in the industry unsurprisingly mirrored that of the percentage of women receiving computing education. Statistics Canada reports that in 2012, there were approximately 1,299,300 people employed in the "Professional, scientific and technical services", of which only 548,800 were women (42%). This category also includes those working in [[law|legal]] and [[accounting]] services (which are typically much more gender balanced), so the actual percentage working in the computing field is likely much lower than this.

==Attempts to address inequalities==
Although the reasons for the lack of participation of women are multifaceted and are not fully understood, it is accepted that they partly stem from the perceived image of the field, a lack of understanding of what work in the field consists of, and a lack of encouragement.&lt;ref name="mainarticle" /&gt; Correspondingly, many institutions (both ones that are independently organized and ones that are funded by the [[Government of Canada]] through universities) have come into existence to inform and encourage potential computing students. As well, many universities and other organizations offer gender-specific scholarships in attempts to increase enrollment numbers.

===Institutions and organizations===
[[Image:Ladies Learning Code event, November 26 2011.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A Ladies Learning Code workshop in Toronto.]]

Canada has several not-for-profit organizations dedicated to supporting women in computing disciplines.

* [[Ladies Learning Code]] is a [[Toronto]]-based not-for-profit which hosts events for women in computing and has a community outreach program. The same founders also have recently formed Girls Learning Code, which hosts technology camps and workshops for "Toronto's most creative 9 to 13-year-old girls".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://girlslearningcode.com/about|work=Girls Learning Code|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Chic Geek]] is a [[Calgary]]-based not-for-profit which creates opportunities for women to explore their geeky sides, inspire one another, and build meaningful personal and professional relationships.  They organize technical workshops for women and girls as well as networking events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://thechicgeek.ca|work=Chic Geek|accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pixelles]] is a [[Montreal]]-based not-for-profit which hosts incubators and follow along programming to help women learn  skills to develop [[video games]].

Many Canadian universities also have resources designed for women in underrepresented disciplines such as computer science.

* The [[University of Toronto]] hosts monthly lunches for all female students and faculty in Computer Science, and a mailing list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women in Computer Science|url=http://web.cs.toronto.edu/people/dcswomen.htm|work=University of Toronto|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[University of British Columbia]] has a "Focus on Women in Computing (FoWCS)" committee which aims to increase the participation of women in computer science "at all academic levels".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Focus On Women In Computing|url=https://www.cs.ubc.ca/our-department/administration/committees/women|work=University of British Columbia|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Simon Fraser University]] has a Women in Computing Science (WICS) group that hosts professional networking events, technical workshops, outreach programs, and social activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women in Computer Science|url=https://wics.cs.sfu.ca|work=Simon Fraser University|accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[University of Waterloo]] has a Women in Computer Science organization (WICS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women in Computer Science|url=https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/wics|work=University of Waterloo|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The School of Computing at [[Queen's University]] has a Women in Computer Science organization (WISC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women in the School of Computing|url=https://www.cs.queensu.ca/wisc|work=School of Computing at Queen's University|accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Initiatives and scholarships===
Several scholarships exist for Canadian women in computing (some of which being international).

*[[Google]] Canada offers the [[Anita Borg]] Memorial Scholarship for outstanding female Canadian undergraduates and graduates in Computer Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Google Anita Borg Memorial Scholarship: Canada|url=http://www.google.ca/anitaborg/|work=Google|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* UBC offers a scholarship for upper-year computer science, with preference to female candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SIMBA Technologies Award in Computer Science|url=https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/undergrad/resources/awards-and-scholarships|work=University of British Columbia|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many universities also have programs in place to encourage interest in computer science, especially for high school students.

* Waterloo's Centre for Education in Mathematics and Computing holds an annual workshop in computer science for young women,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CEMC Workshop in Computer Science for Young Women|url=http://www.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/events/csgirls.html|work=University of Waterloo|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which students from across the country can apply for and are accepted into through a lottery system.

===Celebrations of Women in Computing Events===

Several region-based celebrations, modelled after the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women conference, have taken place over the past several years in conjunction with the ACM-W:

The [http://www.oncwic.ca Ontario Celebration of Women in Computing] (ONCWIC):
* 2010 - Kingston, ON - Chair: Wendy Powley, Queen's University

== International comparison ==
Many of the statistics reported by Canadian studies and agencies are similar to those found in North America as a whole. In the US, the percentage of computer science degrees awarded to women dropped from 37.1% to 26.7% between 1984 and 1998. As well, a recent survey indicated that less than 12% were awarded to women in 2010-2011.&lt;ref name="mainarticle" /&gt; Like Canada, the US has many scholarships and initiatives in place to attempt to address this (e.g., the [[Anita Borg]] Institute).

Asia exhibits some different trends. In [[Southeast Asia]], a more equal gender distribution in the discipline has been reported.&lt;ref name="mainarticle" /&gt; Cultural reasons have been cited for this, as well as the perception that computing is an employable field, which results in greater parental encouragement to pursue careers in the field regardless of gender. The percentage of students who are women enrolled in undergraduate computer science programs was 51.4% in Malaysia in 1991, greater than 50% in Singapore in 1987, and 55% in Thailand in 1998.&lt;ref name="vashti"&gt;Vashti Galpin. 2002. [http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/543812.543839 Women in computing around the world]. ''SIGCSE Bull''. 34, 2 (June 2002), 94-100.&lt;/ref&gt; In India, women graduates from [[IIT Bombay]] in engineering grew from 1.8% in 1972 to 8% in 2005,&lt;ref name="mainarticle" /&gt; which, although still low, is the opposite of the downward trend observed in North America.

The statistics for Europe show an even smaller participation than North America for some countries, and a slightly higher participation for others (primarily [[Scandinavia]]n countries). The Czech Republic had 9.6% women enrolled in 2001, Germany had 10.5% in 2000, the Netherlands had 6.6% in 1999, Slovenia had 6.7% in 1999, and Switzerland had 11.4% in 2001. By contrast, Finland had 20% in 1997, Iceland had 24% in 2000, Norway had 23.2% in 1999, and Sweden had 30% in 2000. The United Kingdom was approximately in the middle at 19% in 1999.&lt;ref name="vashti" /&gt;
