AIDGAP is an [[acronym]] for Aid to Identification in Difficult Groups of Animals and Plants.

The '''AIDGAP series''' is a set of books published by the [[Field Studies Council]]. They are intended to enable students and interested non-specialists to identify groups of taxa in Britain which are not covered by standard [[field guides]]. In general, they are less demanding in level than the [[Synopses of the British Fauna]].

All AIDGAP guides are initially produced as test versions, which are circulated widely to students, teaching staff and environmental professionals, with the feedback incorporated into the final published versions. In many cases the AIDGAP volume is the only non-technical work covering the group of taxa in question.

== History of the series ==

The [[Field Studies Council]] recognised the widespread need for identification guides soon after its inception, and has since established a long tradition of publishing such material. Many of these were written by teaching staff writing their own keys to fill obvious gaps in the available literature (see for example [http://fsj.field-studies-council.org/media/344765/vol1.1_4.pdf A key to the land snails of the Flatford area, Suffolk (1959)]). However, it became increasingly apparent that a change in approach was needed. Too few guides were available which were usable by those with little previous experience. Many groups of plants and animals appeared to be neglected.

The FSC initiated the AIDGAP project in 1976, with input from an advisory panel which included a range of organisations such as the [[Linnean Society]], teachers in secondary education and professional illustrators. The two main objectives adopted by the panel were first to identify those groups of organisms regarded as 'difficult' due to a lack of a suitable key, and second to investigate ways of alleviating the difficulties of identification for each group. The panel also decided to incorporate a 'testing' stage during which the identification guides could be revised and improved.

In practice today, AIDGAP guides are produced as 'test versions', which are then circulated to at least 100 volunteer 'testers', drawn from a wide range of backgrounds. Test versions are available for [http://www.field-studies-council.org/publications/aidgap-testers.aspx free download from the AIDGAP web pages]. Feedback from the testers is passed anonymously to the author, then used to inform the production of the finished AIDGAP guide.

'''Aquacultural engineering''' is a multidisciplinary field of [[engineering]] that aims to solve technical problems associated with farming aquatic [[vertebrates]], [[invertebrates]], and [[algae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederick Wheaton|title=Aquacultural Engineering|edition= |publisher=Kreiger Pub Co|year=1933 |page= |isbn= 978-0-8946-4786-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common aquaculture systems requiring optimization and engineering include sea cages, [[ponds]], and recirculating systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Odd-Ivar Lekang|title=Aquaculture Engineering|edition= 2nd |publisher=John WIley &amp; Sons|year=2013|page=165 |isbn=978-0-470-67085-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design and management of these systems is based on their production goals and the economics of the farming operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Colt |first=John |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1990 |month= |title=The Role of Engineering Disciplines in Aquaculture|url= |journal=iChemE Symposium Series No. 111 |issn= |volume= |issue= |pages=1–17 |id=|accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aquaculture technology is varied with design and development requiring knowledge of mechanical, biological and environmental systems along with [[material engineering]] and [[instrumentation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas B. Lawson|title=Fundamentals of Aquaculture Engineering|edition= |publisher=Springer US|year=1995|page= |isbn=978-1-4615-7049-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, engineering techniques often involve solutions borrowed from [[wastewater treatment]], fisheries, and traditional agriculture.

Aquacultural engineering has played a role in the expansion of the aquaculture industry, which now accounts for half of all [[seafood products]] consumed in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-i5555e.pdf|title=2016 The State of the Worlds Fisheries and Aquaculture|last=|first=|date=2016|website=Food and Agriculture Organization|publisher=United Nations|location=Rome, Italy|page=77|isbn=978-92-5-109185-2|access-date=2016-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; To identify effective solutions the discipline is combined with both fish physiology and business economics knowledge.

==Recirculating aquaculture systems==
[[Recirculating aquaculture systems]] often involve intensive, high-density culture of a species with limited water usage and extensive filtration. In a typical recirculating aquaculture system, a series of filtration steps maintains a high level of water quality that promotes rapid fish growth.&lt;ref name="Timmons"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael B. Timmons and James B. Ebeling|title=Recirculating Aquaculture|edition= 3rd |publisher=Ithaca Publishing Company Publishers|year=2013|page=3 |isbn=978-0971264656}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steps include solids removal, biofiltration, oxygenation, and pumping, with each one requiring different equipment and engineering considerations. Comprehensive instrumentation and sensor controls are required to monitor this equipment and the underlying water conditions such as temperature, dissolved oxygen, and pH. Development of recirculating aquaculture systems is still underway in 2017, and engineering advances are needed to make the systems economically viable for culturing most species.

==Research==
The ''Journal of Aquacultural Engineering'' publishes engineers' studies related to the design and development of aquacultural systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= |month= |title=Aims &amp; Scope|url=http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/405852/description#description|trans_title= |journal=Aquacultural Engineering |issn= 0144-8609|volume= |issue= |pages= |id=|accessdate=2009-08-23 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Worldwide, universities provide aquacultural engineering education often under the umbrella of agricultural or biological engineering.

'''Arkaim''' ({{lang-ru|Аркаим}}) is an [[archaeological site]] in Russia, situated in the steppe of the [[Southern Ural]], {{convert|8.2|km|mi|2|abbr=on}} north-to-northwest of the village of Amursky and {{convert|2.3|km|mi|2|abbr=on}} south-to-southeast of the village of Alexandrovsky in the [[Chelyabinsk Oblast]] of [[Russia]], just north of the border with [[Kazakhstan]]. It was discovered in 1987 by a team of archaeologists led by [[Gennady Zdanovich]], preventing the planned flooding of the area for the creation of a reservoir.{{sfn|Shnirelman|1998|p=33}} Arkaim is attributed to the early [[Proto-Indo-European|Indo-Europeans]] of the [[Sintashta culture]], which some scholars believe represents the proto-[[Indo-Iranians]] before their split into different groups and migration to Central Asia and from there to [[Persia]] and [[India]] and other parts of Eurasia (see [[Indo-Aryan migration theory]]).{{sfn|Shnirelman|1998|p=35}}

Scholars have identified the structure of Arkaim as the cities built "reproducing the model of the universe" described in ancient Indo-European spiritual literature, the [[Vedas]] and the [[Avesta]].{{sfn|Shnirelman|1998|p=35}} The structure consists of three concentric rings of walls and three radial streets, reflecting the city of [[King Yima]] described in the [[Rigveda]].{{sfn|Jones-Bley|Zdanovich|2002|p=45}} The foundation walls and the dwellings of the second ring are built according to ''[[swastika]]''-like patterns;{{sfn|Jones-Bley|Zdanovich|2002|p=163}} the same symbol is found on various artefacts.{{sfn|Jones-Bley|Zdanovich|2002|p=324}} Arkaim is designated as a "national and spiritual shrine" of Russia{{sfn|Shnirelman|1998|p=35}} and has become a holy site for [[Rodnover]], [[Zoroastrian]] and other religious movements.{{sfn|Shnirelman|1998|p=38}}

The fortified citadel of Arkaim dates back to the 17th and 16th century BCE. More than twenty other structures built according to similar patterns have been found in a larger area spanning from the southern Urals' region to the north of Kazakhstan, forming the so-called "[[Country of Towns|Land of Towns]]".{{sfn|Shnirelman|1998|p=34}} Artefacts found at these sites date between the 4th millennium and the 20th century BCE.&lt;ref name=MSU&gt;{{cite web |title=Arkaim the Forgotten Valley |year=2002 |url=http://anthropology.msu.edu/anp264-ss13/2013/04/24/arkaim-the-forgotten-valley/ |publisher=Michigan State University, Department of Anthropology |website=anthropology.msu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the city of Arkaim was visited by [[Vladimir Putin]].{{sfn|Shnirelman|2012|pp=27–28}}

==Discovery and salvage of the site==
In the summer of the year 1987 a team of archaeologists headed by [[Gennady Zdanovich]] was sent to examine the archaeological value of the valley at the confluence of the Bolshaya Karaganka and Utyaganka rivers, in the south of [[Chelyabinsk Oblast]] or the [[Southern Ural]] region, where the construction of a reservoir had begun the previous autumn. Some archaeological sites in the area were already known, but they had yielded little and were not considered worthy of preservation. The site would have been flooded by the spring of 1988.{{sfn|Shnirelman|1998|p=33}}

On June 20, two students who took part in the expedition, Aleksandr Voronkov and Aleksandr Ezril, informed the archaeologists about weird embankments they had found in the steppe. The same evening Zdanovich announced the discovery. The latter would have proven a turning point in the debates about the [[Proto-Indo-European homeland|original homeland of the Indo-Europeans]] and their migrations, which [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] specialists had been bitterly disputing about since the 1970s.{{sfn|Shnirelman|1998|p=33}} The near [[Sintashta culture]], excavated in that decade, yielded the remains of an early [[chariot]] with horses, making apparent that the southern Urals had been a key location in the development of technology and complex civilisation. The discovery of Arkaim confirmed that assumption.{{sfn|Shnirelman|1998|p=34}}

The struggle to rescue the site, was, however, tough, since the reservoir project was carried on by the then all-powerful Ministry of Water Resources of the Soviet Union. The project was scheduled for completion in 1989, but the builders intended to hasten the construction to have it built within the spring of 1988. The archaeologists did their best to mobilise public opinion for the rescue of Arkaim, initially requesting a halt of the project until 1990; academicians and public figures spoke out in their defense. In March 1989 the Praesidium of the Urals Branch of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union formally established a scientific laboratory for the study of the ancient civilisation of Chelyabinsk Oblast, and requested to the Council of Ministers of the Russian Federation to declare the site as a protected area of historical value.{{sfn|Shnirelman|1998|p=35}}

In the following months the Ministry of Water Resources rapidly lost power as the Soviet Union moved towards collapse. In April 1991 the Council of Ministers officially cancelled the construction of the reservoir and declared Arkaim a "historical and geographical museum".{{sfn|Shnirelman|1998|p=35}}

==Structure of Arkaim==
[[File:Arkaim Infographic.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction of the Arkaim settlement.]]
Arkaim was a circular stronghold, umbegone by two concentric bastions made of adobe with timber frames, and covered with unburnt clay bricks. Within the circles, close to the bastions, were around sixty dwellings with hearth, cellars, wells and metallurgical furnaces. They opened towards an inner circular street paved with wood. The street was lined by a covered drainage gutter with pits for water collection. At the centre of the complex there was a rectangular open space. The complex had four ingangs, consisting of intricately constructed passages and oriented towards the cardinal points. Evidence suggests that the complex was built according to a plan, which indicates that the society had a developed structure of roles and had leaders with great authority.{{sfn|Shnirelman|1998|p=34}}

===Measures===
The settlement covered about {{convert|20000|m2|abbr=off}}. The diameter of the enclosing wall was about {{convert|160|m|abbr=off}}, and its thickness was of {{convert|4|to|5|m|abbr=off}}. The height was of {{convert|5.5|m|ft|2|abbr=off}}. The settlement was surrounded with a {{convert|2|m|abbr=off|adj=on}}-deep moat.

Among the four gates, the main was the western one. The dwellings were between {{convert|110|to|180|m2|sqft|abbr=off}} in area. The dwellings of the outer ring were thirty-nine or forty, with doors opening towards the circular street. The dwellings of the inner ring numbered twenty-seven, arranged along the inner wall, with doors opening towards the central square, which was about {{convert|25|by|27|m|abbr=off}} in area.

Zdanovich estimates that approximately 1,500 to 2,500 people could have lived in Arkaim. Surrounding Arkaim's  walls, were arable fields, 130–140 metres by 45 metres (430–460 feet by 150 feet), irrigated by a system of canals and ditches.

==Social impact==
===Religious movements and mysticism===
[[File:Аркаим Гора Шаманка - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Ritual spirals of stones made by Rodnovers in the areas around Arkaim.]]
{{Further|Slavic Native Faith in Russia}}
The discovery of Arkaim reinvigorated the debate about the [[Proto-Indo-European homeland|original homeland]] of the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-Europeans]], seemingly confirming its location in central [[Eurasia]].{{sfn|Shnirelman|1998|pp=33–34}} After their discovery, Arkaim and the Land of Towns have been presented as the "land of the [[Aryan]]s", the centre of a statehood of a [[monarchy|monarchical]] type, and ultimately the model for a new spiritual civilisation harmonised with the universe.{{sfnm|1a1=Shnirelman|1y=1998|1p=36|2a1=Shnirelman|2y=2012|2p=27}} Agencies related to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] have been critical of such activities of Arkaim's archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |last=Petrov |first=Fedor |date=29 June 2010 |title=Наука и неоязычество на Аркаиме (Science and Neopaganism at Arkaim) |website=Proza.ru |url=http://www.proza.ru/2010/05/09/1034 |access-date=3 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707174320/http://www.proza.ru/2010/05/09/1034 |archive-date=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery of Arkaim and the Land of Towns has fueled the growth of schools of thought among [[Rodnovers]], [[Rerikhians]], [[Zoroastrians]] and other movements which regard the archaeological site as the second homeland of the Aryans, who originally dwelt in [[Arctic]] regions and migrated southwards when the weather there became glacial, then spreading from central Eurasia to the east, south and west, founding other civilisations. According to them, all [[Vedas|Vedic]] knowledge originated in the southern Urals.{{sfn|Shnirelman|1998|p=37}} Some of them identify Arkaim as the [[Asgard]] of [[Odin]] spoken of in Germanic literature. The Russian Zoroastrian movement started by the Globa family identifies Arkaim as the place where [[Zoroaster]] was born.{{sfn|Shnirelman|1998|p=38}} Around the year 2005, a great white ''[[swastika]]'' was carved on the nearest hill, and visitors to the site may buy ''swastika''-shaped medallions.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2012|p=28}}

===Vladimir Putin's visit and the "Russian idea"===
Russia's president [[Vladimir Putin]] visited the site in 2005, meeting in person with the chief archaeologist [[Gennady Zdanovich]]. The visit received much attention from Russian media. They presented Arkaim as the "homeland of the majority of contemporary people in Asia, and, partly, Europe". Nationalists called Arkaim the "city of Russian glory" and the "most ancient Slavic-Aryan town". Zdanovich reportedly presented Arkaim to the president as a possible "national idea of Russia",{{sfn|Shnirelman|2012|p=28}} a new idea of civilisation which Shnirelman calls the "Russian idea".{{sfn|Shnirelman|1998|p=36}} According to several analysts, Putin's visit was undoubtedly a message, and it gave credit to the interpretation of Arkaim as an Aryan cult centre.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2012|p=28}}

'''Automatic gain control''' ('''AGC'''), also called '''automatic volume control''' ('''AVC'''), is a closed-loop [[feedback]] regulating circuit in an [[amplifier]] or chain of amplifiers, the purpose of which is to maintain a suitable signal amplitude at its output, despite variation of the signal amplitude at the input. The average or peak output signal level is used to dynamically adjust the [[gain (electronics)|gain]] of the amplifiers, enabling the circuit to work satisfactorily with a greater range of input signal levels. It is used in most [[radio receiver]]s to equalize the average  volume ([[loudness]]) of different radio stations due to differences in received [[signal strength]],   as well as variations in a single station's radio signal due to  [[fading]].  Without AGC the sound emitted from an [[amplitude modulation|AM]] [[radio]] receiver would vary to an extreme extent from a weak to a strong signal; the AGC effectively reduces the volume if the signal is strong and raises it when it is weaker.  In a typical receiver the AGC feedback control signal is usually taken from the [[detector (radio)|detector]] stage and applied to control the gain of the IF or RF amplifier stages.

==How it works==
The signal to be gain controlled (the detector output in a radio) goes to a [[diode]] &amp; [[capacitor]], which produce a peak-following DC voltage. This is fed to the RF gain blocks to alter their bias, thus altering their gain. Traditionally all the gain-controlled stages came before the signal detection, but it is also possible to improve gain control by adding a gain-controlled stage after signal detection.

== Example use cases ==

=== AM radio receivers ===
In 1925, [[Harold Alden Wheeler]] invented automatic volume control (AVC) and obtained a patent.  [[Karl Küpfmüller]] published an analysis of AGC systems in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;K. Küpfmüller, "Über die Dynamik der selbsttätigen Verstärkungsregler", ''Elektrische Nachrichtentechnik'', vol. 5, no. 11, pp. 459-467, 1928. (German) [http://ict.open.ac.uk/classics/2.pdf On the dynamics of automatic gain controllers], (English translation)&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 1930s most new commercial broadcast receivers included automatic volume control.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10094&amp;page=281 Memorial Tributes: National Academy of Engineering, Volume 9] (2001) page 281, retrieved 2009 Oct 23&lt;/ref&gt;

AGC is a departure from linearity in AM radio [[receiver (radio)|receiver]]s.&lt;ref&gt;F. Langford-Smith (ed.), ''[[Radiotron Designer's Handbook]]'' 4th ed., RCA, 1953, chapter 27 section 3&lt;/ref&gt; Without AGC, an AM radio would have a linear relationship between the signal amplitude and the sound waveform – the sound [[amplitude]], which correlates with loudness, is proportional to the radio signal amplitude, because the information content of the signal is carried by the changes of amplitude of the [[carrier wave]]. If the circuit were not fairly linear, the modulated signal could not be recovered with reasonable [[fidelity]]. However, the strength of the signal received will vary widely, depending on the power and distance of the [[transmitter]], and signal path [[attenuation]]. The AGC circuit keeps the receiver's output level from fluctuating too much by detecting the overall strength of the signal and automatically adjusting the gain of the receiver to maintain the output level within an acceptable range. For a very weak signal, the AGC operates the receiver at maximum gain; as the signal increases, the AGC reduces the gain.

It is usually disadvantageous to reduce the gain of the [[RF front end]] of the receiver on weaker signals as low gain can worsen [[signal-to-noise ratio]] and [[blocking (radio)|blocking]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qsl.net/va3iul/Files/Automatic_Gain_Control.pdf Automatic gain control in receivers] by Iulian Rosu, VA3IUL&lt;/ref&gt; therefore, many designs reduce gain only for stronger signals.

Since the AM detector diode produces a DC voltage proportional to signal strength, this voltage can be fed back to earlier stages of the receiver to reduce gain. A filter network is required so that the audio components of the signal don't appreciably influence gain; this prevents "modulation rise" which increases the effective modulation depth of the signal, distorting the sound. [[Communications receiver]]s may have more complex AVC systems, including extra amplification stages, separate AGC detector diodes, different time constants for broadcast and shortwave bands, and application of different levels of AGC voltage to different stages of the receiver to prevent distortion and cross-modulation.&lt;ref&gt;Langford-Smith 53, page 1108&lt;/ref&gt; Design of the AVC system has a great effect on the usability of the receiver, tuning characteristics, audio fidelity, and behavior on overload and strong signals.&lt;ref&gt;Langford-Smith 53, chapter 25 page 1229&lt;/ref&gt;

FM receivers, even though they incorporate limiter stages and detectors that are relatively insensitive to amplitude variations, still benefit from AGC to prevent overload on strong signals.

=== Radar ===

A related application of AGC is in [[radar]] systems, as a method of overcoming unwanted [[clutter (radar)|clutter]] echoes. This method relies on the fact that clutter returns far outnumber echoes from targets of interest. The receiver's gain is automatically adjusted to maintain a constant level of overall visible clutter. While this does not help detect targets masked by stronger surrounding clutter, it does help to distinguish strong target sources. In the past, radar AGC was electronically controlled and affected the gain of the entire radar receiver. As radars evolved, AGC became computer-software controlled, and affected the gain with greater granularity, in specific detection cells.
Many [[Electronic warfare#Electronic attack .28EA.29|radar countermeasures]] use a radar's AGC to fool it, by effectively "drowning out" the real signal with the spoof, as the AGC will regard the weaker, true signal as clutter relative to the strong spoof.

=== Audio/video ===

An [[Magnetic tape sound recording|audio tape]] generates a certain amount of [[noise]]. If the level of the [[Signal (electronics)|signal]] on the tape is low, the noise is more prominent, i.e., the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] is lower than it could be. To produce the least noisy recording, the recording level should be set as high as possible without being so high as to [[clipping (audio)|clip]] or [[distortion|distort]] the signal. In professional [[high-fidelity]] recording the level is set manually using a [[peak-reading]] meter.  When high fidelity is not a requirement, a suitable recording level can be set by an AGC circuit which reduces the gain as the average signal level increases. This allows a usable recording to be made even for speech some distance from the [[microphone]] of an audio recorder. Similar considerations apply with [[VCRs]].

A potential disadvantage of AGC is that when recording something like music with quiet and loud passages such as classical music, the AGC will tend to make the quiet passages louder and the loud passages quieter, compressing the [[dynamic range]]; the result can be a reduced musical quality if the signal is not re-expanded when playing, as in a [[companding]] system.

Some [[reel-to-reel]] [[tape recorders]] and [[cassette deck]]s have AGC circuits. Those used for high-fidelity generally don't.

Most VCR circuits use the amplitude of the [[vertical blanking interval|vertical blanking pulse]] to operate the AGC. Video copy control schemes such as [[Macrovision]] exploit this, inserting spikes in the pulse which will be ignored by most [[television]] sets, but cause a VCR's AGC to overcorrect and corrupt the recording.

===Vogad===

A voice-operated gain-adjusting device&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/fs-1037/dir-039/_5820.htm Vogad at Federal Standard 1037C]&lt;/ref&gt; or volume-operated gain-adjusting device&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
(vogad) is a type of AGC or [[Audio level compression|compressor]] for [[microphone]] amplification. It is usually used in radio transmitters to prevent [[overmodulation]] and to reduce the [[dynamic range]] of the signal which allows increasing average transmitted power. In [[telephony]], this device takes a wide variety of input amplitudes and produces a generally consistent output amplitude.

In its simplest form, a limiter can consist of a pair of back-to-back [[Clamper (electronics)|clamp diode]]s, which simply shunt excess signal amplitude to ground when the diode conduction threshold is exceeded. This approach will simply clip off the top of large signals, leading to high levels of distortion.

While clipping limiters are often used as a form of last-ditch protection against overmodulation, a properly designed vogad circuit actively controls the amount of gain to optimise the modulation depth in real time. As well as preventing overmodulation, it boosts the level of quiet signals so that undermodulation is also avoided. Undermodulation can lead to poor signal penetration in noisy conditions, consequently vogad is particularly important for voice applications such as [[radiotelephone]]s.

A good vogad circuit must have a very fast attack time, so that an initial loud voice signal does not cause a sudden burst of excessive modulation. In practice the attack time will be a few milliseconds, so a clipping limiter is still sometimes needed to catch the signal on these short peaks. A much longer decay time is usually employed, so that the gain does not get boosted too quickly during the normal pauses in natural speech. Too short a decay time leads to the phenomenon of "breathing" where the background noise level gets boosted at each gap in the speech. Vogad circuits are normally adjusted so that at low levels of input the signal is not fully boosted, but instead follow a linear boost curve. This works well with [[noise cancellation|noise cancelling]] microphones.

=== Telephone recording===
Devices to record both sides of a [[telephone]] conversation must record both the relatively large signal from the local user and the much smaller signal from the remote user at comparable loudnesses. Some telephone recording devices incorporate automatic gain control to produce acceptable-quality recordings.

=== Biological===

As is the case with many concepts found in engineering, automatic gain control is also found in biological systems, especially sensory systems.  For example, in the [[vertebrate]] [[visual system]], calcium dynamics in the [[retina]]l [[photoreceptor cell|photoreceptor]]s adjust gain to suit light levels.  Further on in the visual system, cells in V1 are thought to mutually inhibit, causing normalization of responses to contrast, a form of automatic gain control.  Similarly, in the [[auditory system]], the [[Olivocochlear system#Effects of electrical stimulation|olivocochlear efferent]] neurons are part of a biomechanical gain control loop.&lt;ref&gt;

== Recovery times ==

Similar to all automatic control system the time dynamics of AGC operation may be important in many applications. Some AGC systems are slow to react to the need for gain changes, others may react very rapidly. An example of an application where fast AGC recovery time is required is in receivers used in Morse code communications where so-called [[QSK operation (full break-in)|full break-in]] or QSK operation is necessary to enable receiving stations to interrupt sending stations mid-character (e.g. between dot and dash signals).

In 1980, the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Soviet scientists]] G.R. Ivanitsky, V.I. Krinsky, A.N. Zaikin, [[Anatoly Zhabotinsky|A.M. Zhabotinsky]],&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Zaikin-1970"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Zhabotinsky-1973"/&gt;&lt;ref group = "B:" name="b-Zhabotinsky-1974"/&gt; [[Boris Pavlovich Belousov|B.P. Belousov]] became winners of the highest state award of the [[USSR]], [[:ru:Лауреаты Ленинской премии|Lenin Prize]] "''for the discovery of a new class of autowave processes and the study of them in disturbance of stability of the distributed excitable systems''."

=== A brief history of autowave researches ===

The first who studied actively the [[Self-exciting oscillation|self-oscillations]] was Academician [[Aleksandr Andronov|AA Andronov]], and the term "''auto-oscillations''" in Russian terminology was introduced by AA Andronov in 1928. His followers&lt;ref group = "note" name="P003"/&gt; from [[N. I. Lobachevsky State University of Nizhny Novgorod|Lobachevsky University]] further contributed greatly to the development of ''autowave theory''.

The simplest autowave equations describing combustion processes have been studied by [[Andrey Kolmogorov|A.N. Kolmogorov]],&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Kolmogorov-1937"/&gt; I.E. Petrovsky, [[:ru:Пискунов, Николай Семёнович|N.S. Piskunov]] in 1937., as well as by [[Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich|Ya.B. Zel'dovich]] и [[David A. Frank-Kamenetskii|D.A. Frank-Kamenetsky]]&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Zeldovich-1938"/&gt; in 1938.

The classical axiomatic model with autowaves in myocardium was published in 1946 by [[Norbert Wiener]] and [[Arturo Rosenblueth]].&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Wiener-1946"/&gt;

During 1970-80, major efforts to study autowaves were concentrated in the [[Institute of Biological Physics in Pushchino|Institute of Biological Physics]] of [[Russian Academy of Sciences|the USSR Academy of Sciences]], located in the suburban town [[Pushchino]], near Moscow. It was here, under the guidance of V.I.Krinsky,  such world-famous now experts in the field of the autowave researches as A.V.Panfilov, I.R.Efimov, R.R.Aliev, K.I. Agladze, O.A.Mornev, M.A.Tsyganov were educated and trained. V.V.Biktashev, Yu.E. Elkin, A.V. Moskalenko gained their experience with the autowave theory also in Pushchino, in the neighboring [[Institute of Mathematical Problems of Biology]], under the guidance of E.E.Shnoll.

{{centered pull quote|The term "autowave processes" for all these (and other) phenomena was coined by the USSR physicist R.V. Khokhlov. There are definite and important relations between these autowaves and ideas from synergetics and self-organisation. |author= V. A. Vasiliev etc. (1987)|source=&lt;ref group="B:" name=" b-Yakhno-1987en"/&gt;}}

The term "''autowaves''" was proposed, probably, on the analogy of previously "''auto-oscillations''".

Almost immediately after the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union]], many of these Russian scientists left their native country for working in foreign institutions, where they still continue their studies of autowaves. In particular,  E.R.Efimov is developing the ''theory of virtual electrode'',&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Efimov-2004"/&gt; which describes some effects occurring during [[defibrillation]].

Among other notable scientists, who are engaged in these investigation, there are A.N. Zaikin and E.E.Shnoll (autowaves and [[bifurcation memory]] in the blood coagulation system);&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Fazli-2002ufn"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Fazli-2007ufn"/&gt; A.Yu.

Yakhno (general autowave theory as well as connections between autowaves and process of thinking);&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Yakhno-1979"/&gt; K.I. Agladze (autowaves in chemical media);&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Agladze-1982"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Agladze-1984"/&gt; V.N.Biktashev (general autowave theory as well as different sorts of autowave drift);&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Biktashev-1994"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Biktashev-1995"/&gt; O.A.Mornev (general autowave theory);&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Mornev-1997"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Mornev-2004"/&gt; M.A.Tsyganov (the role of autowave in population dynamics);&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Tsyganov-1993"/&gt; Yu.E. Elkin, A.V. Moskalenko, ([[bifurcation memory]] in a model of cardiac tissue).&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Elkin-2007"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Moskalenko-2009"/&gt;

A huge role in the study of autowave models of cardiac tissue belongs to [[Denis Noble]] and members of his team from the [[University of Oxford]].

=== The basic definitions ===

One of the first definitions of autowaves was as follows: {{centered pull quote|It is accepted now to consider an autowave as some self-sustaining wave process in a non-equilibrium environment that remain unchanged for sufficiently small changes in both the initial and boundary conditions. (...) Mathematical apparatus for describing autowaves often are [[Reaction-diffusion|the equations of the diffusion type with an active nonlinearity]].

Unlike linear waves — such as sound waves, electromagnetic waves and other, which are inherent in [[conservative system]]s and mathematically described by linear second order [[Hyperbolic partial differential equation|hyperbolic equations]] ([[wave equation]]s), — dynamics of an ''autowave'' in terms of [[differential equations]] can be described by [[Parabolic partial differential equation|parabolic equation]] ''with nonlinear free member of a special form''.

The concrete form of the free member &lt;math&gt;\vec{f}(\vec{u})&lt;/math&gt; is extremely important, because: {{centered pull quote|

Is u a scalar in this case? Is the Allen-Cahn_equation (see Wikipedia article) an example of N-shaped dependence?|date=April 2015}} In this sense, the system of equations, known as the Aliev–Panfilov model,&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Aliev-1996"/&gt; is a very exotic example, because &lt;math&gt;f(u)&lt;/math&gt; has in it a very complex form of two intersecting parabolas, besides more crossed with two straight lines, resulting in a more pronounced nonlinear properties of this model.

''Autowaves'' is an example of a self-sustaining wave process in extensive nonlinear systems containing distributed energy sources. It is correct for simple autowaves, that period, wavelength, propagation speed, amplitude, and some other characteristics of an autowave are determined solely by local properties of the medium. However, in the 21st century, researchers began to discover a growing number of examples of self-wave solutions when the "classical" principle is violated.

(See also general information in literature, for example, in&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Krinsky-1984"/&gt;&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Yakhno-1987en"/&gt;&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-SE_v01-1988"/&gt;&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Loskutov-1995"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Elkin-2006"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Elkin-2007"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Moskalenko-2009"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Fazli-2002ufn"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Fazli-2007ufn"/&gt;).

=== The simplest examples ===

[[File:Travelling wave for Fisher equation.svg|thumb|right|A switching wave front solution for Fisher's equation (See [[Reaction-diffusion]] for details).]]
The simplest model of autowave is a rank of dominoes that are falling one after another, if you drop an outermost one (so called "[[domino effect]]"). This is an example of a ''switching wave''.

As another example of autowaves, imagine that you stand on a field and set fire to the grass. While the temperature is below the threshold, the grass will not take fire. Upon reaching the ''threshold'' temperature ([[autoignition temperature]]) the [[combustion]] process begins, with the release of heat sufficient to ignite the nearest areas. The result is that the combustion front has been shaped, which spreads through the field. It can be said in such cases that autowave arose, which is one of the results of [[self-organization]] in non-equilibrium thermodynamic systems. After some time new grass replaces the burnt grass, and the field acquires again the ability for igniting. This is an example of an ''excitation wave''.

There are a great deal of other natural objects that are also considered among autowave processes: oscillatory [[chemical reaction]]s in active media (e.g., [[Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction]]), the spread of excitation pulses along nerve fibres, wave chemical signalling in the colonies of certain microorganisms, autowaves in [[ferroelectric]] and [[semiconductor]] films, population waves, spread of [[epidemics]] and of [[genes]], and many other [[phenomena]].

Nerve impulses, which serve as a typical example of autowaves in an active medium with recovery, were studied as far back as 1850 by [[Hermann von Helmholtz]]. The properties of nerve impulses that are typical for the simplest self-wave solutions (universal shape and amplitude, independent of the initial conditions, and annihilation under collisions) were ascertained in the 1920s and 1930s.

[[File:Action potential.svg|thumb|300px|Schematic of an [[electrophysiology|electrophysiological]] recording of an action potential showing the various phases that occur as the wave passes a point on a cell [[biological membrane|membrane]].]]
Let's consider a 2D active medium consisting of elements, each of which can be found in three different states: rest, excitation and [[Refractory period (physiology)|refractoriness]]. In the absence of external influence, elements are at rest. As a result of an influence upon it, when the concentration of the activator reaches the threshold, the element will switch to an excited state, acquiring the ability to excite the neighbouring elements. Some time after the excitation the element switches to a refractory state, in which it cannot be excited. Then the element return to its initial state of rest, gaining again the ability to transform into an excited state.

Any "classical" excitation wave moves in an excitable medium without attenuation, maintaining its shape and amplitude constant. As it passes, the energy loss ([[dissipation]]) is completely offset by the energy input from the elements of the active medium. The leading front of an autowave (the transition from rest to a state of excitation) is usually very small: for example, the ratio of the leading front duration to the entire duration of the pulse for a myocardium sample is about 1:330.

Unique opportunities to study the autowave processes in two- and three-dimensional active media with very different kinetics are provided with methods of mathematical modelling using computers. For computer simulation of autowaves, one uses a generalized Wiener–Rosenblueth model, as well as a large number of other models, among which a special place is occupied by The [[FitzHugh–Nagumo model]]  (the simplest model of an active medium, and its various versions) and The [[Hodgkin–Huxley model]] (nerve impulse). There are also many autowave myocardial models: The [[Beeler–Reuter model]], several Noble models (developed by [[Denis Noble]]), The [[Aliev–Panfilov model]], The [[Fenton-Karma model]], etc.

=== Basic properties of autowaves ===

It was also proven&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Kokoz-1973"/&gt; that the simplest autowave regimes should be common to every system of differential equations of any complexity that describe a particular active media, because such a system can be simplified to two differential equations.

== Main known autowave objects ==

First of all, we should notice, that the elements of the active media can be, at least, of three very different types; these are ''[[Self-exciting oscillation|self-exciting]]'', ''[[Excitable medium|excitable]]'' and ''[[wikt:trigger|trigger]]'' (or ''bistable'') regimes. Accordingly, there are three types of homogeneous active media composed of these elements.

A bistable element has two stable stationary states, transitions between which occur when external influence exceeds a certain threshold. In media of such elements, ''switching waves'' arise, which switch the medium from one of its states to the other. For instance, a classic case of such a switching autowave — perhaps, the simplest autowave phenomena — is falling dominoes (the example already given). Another simple example of a bistable medium is burning paper: the switching wave propagates in the form of a flame, switching paper from the normal state to its ashes.

An excitable element has only one stable stationary state. External influence over a threshold level can bring such an element out of its stationary state and perform an evolution before the element will return again to its stationary state. During such evolution, the active element can affect the adjacent elements and, in turn, lead them out of the stationary state too. As a result,  the ''excitation wave'' propagates in this medium. This is the most common form of autowaves in biological media, such as nervous tissue, or the myocardium.

[[File:Typical phase portraits of autowaves.gif|thumb|300px|right|Phase portraits (left column) and the corresponding behaviour (right column) of an element of an active medium:  '''A''' (upper row) — excitable, '''B''' — bistable, '''C''' (lower row) — self-oscillating element types.]]
A self-oscillating element has no stationary states and continually performs stable oscillations of some fixed form, amplitude and frequency. External influence can disturb these oscillations. After some relaxation time, all their characteristics except for the phase back to its stable value, but the phase can be changed. As a result, the ''phase waves'' spread in the medium of such elements. Such phase waves can be observed in electro-garlands or in certain chemical media. An example of a self-oscillating medium is the SA node in the heart, in which excitation pulses arise spontaneously.

It can be clearly seen on the phase portrait of the basic system of equations describing the active medium (see Fig.) that a significant difference between these three types of behaviour of an active medium is caused by the quantity and the position of its singular points. The shape of autowaves observed in reality can be very similar to each other, and therefore it can be difficult to assess the type of element only by the form of the excitation pulse.

Besides, autowave phenomena, which can be observed and investigated, depend greatly on geometrical and topological peculiarities of an active medium.

=== One-dimensional autowaves ===
{{expand section|date=March 2013}}

One-dimensional cases include autowave spread in cable and its spread in the ring, with the latter mode considering as a limiting case of a rotating wave in two-dimensional active medium, while the first case is considered as spread of the autowave in the ring with zero curvature (i.e., with an infinite radius).

=== Two-dimensional autowaves ===
{{expand section|date=March 2013}}

[[File:reaction diffusion spiral.gif|thumb|265px|left|Autowave reverberator found in the above two-component [[Reaction-diffusion|reaction-diffusion system]] of [[FitzHugh–Nagumo model|Fitzhugh-Nagumo]] type.]]
A number of autowave sources is known in the two-dimensional active media. In such a way, it is distinguished at least five type of re-entry,&lt;ref group="note" name="P001"/&gt; which are ''running around the ring'', ''spiral wave'', ''reverberator'' (i.e., ''two-dimensional autowave vortex'') and ''fibrillation''. The literature identifies two types of sources of ''concentric autowaves'' in 2D active media; these are ''pacemakers'' and ''leading centres''. Both the ''leading centres'' and ''reverberators'' are interesting, because they are not tied to the structure of the medium and can appear and disappear in its different parts. Areas of increased automation may also be an example of a sources of autowaves. Three different types of increased automation are known now:&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Ardashev-2009p06"/&gt;
# ''induced automatism''
# ''trigger automatism with the mechanism of early postdepolarisation''
# ''trigger automatism with the mechanism of late postdepolarisation''.

=== The population autowaves ===
{{expand section|date=March 2013}}

{{centered pull quote|Collective amoebae [[Dictyostelium discoideum]] with a sufficient supply live as [[unicellular organism]]s. However, during starvation they crawl together with forming a [[multicellular organism]], which later gives [[spores]] that can survive under adverse conditions. It was found that the movement of amoebae is controlled by distribution of some substance, [[morphogen]] [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]],  in the environment. Such amoeba cells synthesize and accumulate the molecules of cAMP and then they are able to "release" this reserve into the environment, if the concentration of cAMP in it increased. The released quantity of cAMP diffuses through the environment and makes the following cell amoebas "snap into action" by throwing their portion of the morphogen out. As a result, an autowave of high concentration of cAMP spreads through the environment. After the passage of the wave, the "discharged" cells begin to accumulate a new portion of cAMP again, due to the synthesis, and after a while they are able to "snap into action" again.Thus, the population of the ''collective amoebae'' is a typical example of the [[active medium]].

Коллективные амёбы [[Dictyostelium discoideum]] при наличие достаточного питания живут в виде [[:ru:Одноклеточный организм|одноклеточных организмов]]. Однако при голодании они сползаются и образуют [[:ru:Многоклеточный организм]], который впоследствии даёт [[:ru:споры]], способные пережить неблагоприятные условия. Установлено, что движение амёб управляется распределением по среде некоторого вещества — ''морфогена'' [[:ru:Циклический аденозинмонофосфат|цАМФ]]. Клетки амёб синтезируют и накапливают в себе молекулы цАМФ и способны «высвободить» его запас в окружающую среду, если концентрация цАМФ в ней повысилась. Освободившееся количество цАМФ распространяется за счёт диффузии по среде и заставляет следующие клетки амёб «сработать», выбросив свою порцию морфогена. В результате по среде распространяется автоволна — повышенная концентрация цАМФ. После прохождения волны «разрядившиеся» клетки начинают вновь накапливать за счёт синтеза определённую порцию цАМФ и по прошествии некоторого времени способны «срабатывать» вновь. Таким образом, популяция ''коллективных амёб'' служит типичным примером активной среды. {{hidden end}}

&lt;ref name="P001"&gt;Now the sad role of re-entry as the causes of various cardiac arrhythmias is well recognized. The basic scheme re-entry was proposed as long ago as 1914, with being obtained in studies of isolated cardiac tissue rings (GR Mines — Trans.R.Soc.Can., 1914, 8, 43).  T.Lewis etc. demonstrated in 1921 that atrial flutter may be conditioned by the circulation of the excitation wave down the right and up the left atrium (Heart, 1921, 8, 361). This fact was again confirmed experimentally in the middle of 20th century by C.E.Cabrera and D.Soli-Pollares (Arch. Inst. Cardiol. Mex., 1947, 17,850). The essential role of re-entry as a pathogenetic mechanism of supraventricular tachycardia was suggested in 1928 by F.O.Schmidt and J.Erlanger (Am. J. Physiol. 1928-1929, 87, 326). It is also responsible for many types of ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Celtic mazes''' are [[Line (mathematics)|straight-line]] [[spiral]] [[pattern|patterns]] that have been drawn all over the world since [[prehistory|prehistoric times]]. The patterns originate in early [[Celts|Celtic]] developments in stone and metal-work, and later in medieval [[Insular art]]. Prehistoric spiral designs date back to [[Gavrinis]] (c. 3500 BCE).&lt;ref name="Meehan"&gt;Meehan, Aidan (1993). ''Celtic Design: Maze Patterns'', pp. 7–8. {{ISBN|0-500-27747-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Classical 7-Circuit Labyrinth.svg|thumb|Classical labyrinth]]
[[File:HK Advents-Labyrinth 14122013 100sec.ogg|thumb|thumbtime=84|Cretan labyrinth made with 2500 burning [[tealight]]s in the [[Centre for Christian Meditation and Spirituality of the Diocese of Limburg]] at the [[Holy Cross Church, Frankfurt-Bornheim|Holy Cross Church]] in [[Frankfurt am Main]]-[[Bornheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Bornheim]]]]
The straight-line spirals of Celtic labyrinths originated in [[chevron (insignia)|chevrons]] and [[lozenges]] and are drawn by the Celts using a [[connect the dots]] method.&lt;ref name="Meehan"/&gt;

Celtic labyrinths are found among carvings at [[Camonica Valley]], occupied by the Celts early in the first millennium, most older than the one [[Knossos]] or Classical style example found there. The mythology associated with the labyrinths also suggest Celtic origin. For example, the labyrinths containing eyes or a figure with horns and a snake about its waist imply the deity [[Cernunnos]]. Lastly, Celtic examples resembling the Cretan model but featuring path-line reversal (the path of one is traceable as the line of the other) suggest Celtic pre-knowledge of their construction. Methods of constructing  Classical labyrinths from figure with serpent through waist and ocular spiral may be demonstrated.&lt;ref name="Meehan"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3031">The '''Center for Research in Economics and Statistics''' ('''CREST''') is the center of research of the [[INSEE]], the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies.
The research center is affiliated with the [[École Nationale de la Statistique et de l'Administration Économique|ENSAE]] graduate school.
It is directed by [[Francis Kramarz]] since 2007.

It includes several laboratories in econometrics, macroeconomics,microeconomics, statistics, finance, mathematics, sociology.

It is ranked 9th research center in Economics in the world, 2nd in Europe and 1st in France by www.econphd.net
[http://www.econphd.net/rank/rallec.htm See ranking here]

==Objectives==
The general objective of CREST is to play an active role in the international development of research in two main fields:
* economic and social modeling
* conception and implementation of statistical methods

This general goal can be broken down into four more specific objectives:
* The training of graduate students
* The production and diffusion of research
* The exchange and management of visitors programs
* The links with firms and public administrations

===The training of graduate students===
CREST organizes advanced PhD courses and participates in the supervision of dissertations. Over forty research students are currently working on their dissertations at the center. French and foreign students and apply for a CREST fellowship.

The CREST maintains very close relationships with the [[École Nationale de la Statistique et de l'Administration Économique|ENSAE]], the Graduate School of INSEE.

===The production and diffusion of research===
The CREST production is important both in the theoretical and the applied fields. The center organizes eight regular seminars and many international conferences (more than ten conferences over the last five years). The Centre also publishes a series of working papers, an information letter and an annual report.

===Exchange and visitors programs===
Invitations of junior and senior researchers are part of the Center's policy. The length of the visits varies between one week and one year and financial support is available. In addition, CREST is involved in several international networks, both in the doctoral field (the European Doctoral Program in quantitative economics, for example) and in research (Human Capital and Mobility networks, for instance).

===Links with firms and public administrations===
In particularly with INSEE. Several members of CREST are advisors for French firms or administrations. CREST also has strong links with INSEE: on the one hand, CREST benefits from the statistical data available at INSEE, and, on the other hand, the Center provides expertise for various studies and training programs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20808">'''Cognitive inhibition''' refers to the mind's ability to tune out stimuli that are irrelevant to the task/process at hand or to the mind's current state. Cognitive inhibition can be done either in whole or in part, intentionally or otherwise.&lt;ref name=MacLeod&gt;{{cite journal| last = MacLeod| first = Colin| title = Concept of Inhibition in Cognition| year = 2007| url = http://www.artsci.wustl.edu/~msommers/aging/inhibit0.pdf| accessdate = March 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive inhibition in particular can be observed in many instances throughout specific areas of [[cognitive science]].

==History==

The early models of what would become the study and concept of cognitive inhibition were developed by [[Sigmund Freud]]. Inhibition was believed to play two primary roles: the prevention of unwanted thoughts or behaviors, and the [[Psychological repression|repression]] of experiences from infancy and childhood.&lt;ref name=Dempster&gt;{{cite journal| last = Dempster| first = F.N.| title = Chapter 1: A Historical Perspective| journal = Interference and Inhibition in Cognition| year = 1995| url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1021992632168?LI=true#page-3| accessdate = March 3, 2013| doi=10.1023/A:1021992632168| volume=11| pages=1–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freud believed cognitive inhibition was not just a lack of awareness to stimuli but an active process, requiring a constant energy expenditure.&lt;ref name=Dempster /&gt;

Other early theories of cognitive inhibition focused on its central developmental mechanisms and were founded by Luria and Vygotsky, two Russian psychologists. They proposed that children acquire control of behavior and thought through internalized speech, and that they consciously exhibit a cognitively inhibitory process in order to regulate their own behavior. Cognitive inhibition was thought to develop as mental control over behavior developed.

During the past 30 years inhibitory mechanisms such as cognitive inhibition have not been particularly prominent in [[developmental psychology]], but currently they are undergoing a revival in the study of inefficient inhibition (explored in a later section) and resource limitations.&lt;ref name=Dempster /&gt;

==Developmental psychology==

Cognitive inhibition can be seen at work during studies in [[developmental psychology]].  An experiment done by Friedman and Leslie&lt;ref name=MacLeod /&gt; explained children's performance in the [[Theory of mind#False-belief task|false belief task]] as relying on a critical inhibitory process. What this demonstrated is that reaching the age of 3 or 4 triggers cognitive inhibition ability formation.&lt;ref name=MacLeod /&gt; The idea is that children who are 3 or 4 can suppress information from their cognitive experience in order to evaluate a situation from another's point of view. This is very important developmentally as it may interact with the formation of [[empathy]]: cognitive inhibition cannot be so great as to completely block one's experiences while evaluating another point of view, but must be strong enough to enable an accurate representation of that point of view. Other elements of cognitive inhibition that are studied in developmental psychology include memory formation &lt;ref name=Harnishfeger&gt;{{cite journal| last = Harnishfeger| first = Katherine| title = The Development of Cognitive Inhibition| publisher = Academic Press, Inc.| location = San Diego, CA| year = 1995| url = https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=lJ5ubLyVaGYC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA175&amp;dq=harnishfeger+memory+formation&amp;ots=i9OxRMNODo&amp;sig=kk-o4lud62_NJ7Vm5n7RTGSuia8#v=onepage&amp;q=harnishfeger%20memory%20formation&amp;f=false| accessdate = March 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[memory inhibition]]. It has been demonstrated that intentional inhibition of memory commitment is not fully developed until adulthood, and is very difficult for children to accomplish. This illustrates the fact that cognitive inhibition tasks, such as those in memory processing, are a gradually acquired skill rather than instinctual. Other cognitive functions that are developed gradually throughout childhood include exercising self-control over retained representational structures of information and quickly adapting cognitive processing to changing behavioral situations. Both of these functions were determined to be present throughout development, but not at full capacity until young adulthood.&lt;ref name=Davidson&gt;{{cite journal| last = Davidson| first = Matthew|author2=Dima Amso |author3=Loren Cruess Anderson |author4=Adele Diamond | title = Development of cognitive control and executive functions from 4 to 13 years: Evidence from manipulations of memory, inhibition, and task switching| journal = Neuropsychologia| volume = 44| issue = 11| pages = 2037–2078| publisher = Neuropsychologia| year = 2006| pmc=1513793| doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2006.02.006 | pmid=16580701}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidently, the ability to intentionally ignore irrelevant details and to focus attention and [[cognitive ability]] on more relevant details is not present in young children and is a highly developmentally-related process.&lt;ref name=Harnishfeger /&gt;

==Role in survival==

Cognitive inhibition may have played a role in the survival of human children, in what is called [[betrayal trauma theory]].&lt;ref name="Freyd"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Freyd|first = Jennifer|title = What is a Betrayal Trauma? What is Betrayal Trauma Theory?|journal = Encyclopedia of Psychological Trauma|pages = 76|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons|location = New York|year = 2008|url = http://pages.uoregon.edu/dynamic/jjf/defineBT.html|accessdate = March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "In situations involving treacherous acts by a caregiver, a 'cognitive information blockage' may occur that results in an isolation of knowledge of the event from awareness".&lt;ref name=Todd&gt;{{cite journal| last = Todd| first = Peter|author2=Ralph Hertwig |author3=Ulrich Hoffrage | title = Evolutionary Cognitive Psychology| journal = Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology| year = 2004| url = http://library.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/ft/pt/PT_Evolutionary_2005.pdf| accessdate = March 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This motivated forgetting caused by cognitive inhibition would have been necessary in the past to maintain the crucial relationship between child and caregiver so that the child would survive; therefore, cognitive inhibition has endured through [[evolution]]. For example, a parent or caregiver may have been abusive physically or emotionally to a child, perhaps not intentionally, but the effect would be the same to the child. However, the world outside the protection of the caregiver would be even less forgiving and almost certainly fatal to the child in ancient history. So, they cognitively inhibited the memory of the abuse in order to maintain the relationship.

==Behavioral psychology==
[[Behavioral psychology]] may play an important part in the development of cognitive inhibition.
Cognitive inhibition is believed to strongly influence both sexual and aggressive urges within human society. When signals or stimuli are perceived by an individual, the mind processes the information and the body elicits a response. However, in the case of sexual arousal or perceived aggressive behavior, the individual needs to exercise caution in the cognitive processing of the incoming signals. This is where cognitive inhibition plays its part, preventing the individual from cognitively processing the stimuli and selecting an inappropriate response, thus potentially saving crucial social relationships.&lt;ref name=Dempster2&gt;{{cite journal| last = Dempster| first = F|author2=A. Corkill| title = Neo-interference research and the development of intelligence| journal = The development of intelligence| pages = 215–243| publisher = Hove| year = 1999| jstor = 10.1086/650572| volume=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behavior towards others in a social circle is strongly influenced by [[empathy]], which can be seen as a form of cognitive inhibition. Empathy causes an individual to understand the physical/emotional pain and suffering of others. When an interaction occurs, cognitive inhibition on the part of the individual causes him or her to respond appropriately and avoid upsetting someone already in physical or emotional pain. Again, this is important in maintaining [[social relationships]].

Behavioral control is an important application of cognitive inhibition in [[behavioral psychology]], as is emotional control. [[Depression (mood)|Depression]] is an example of cognitive inhibition failure in emotion control. Correctly functioning cognitive inhibition would result in reduced selective attention to negative stimuli and retention of negative thoughts. "There is emerging evidence that depression is characterized by deficits in the inhibition of mood-congruent material. These deficits could result in prolonged processing of negative, goal-irrelevant aspects of presented information thereby hindering recovery from negative mood and leading to the sustained negative affect that characterizes depressive episodes".&lt;ref name=Joorman&gt;{{cite journal| last = Joorman| first = J |author2=K.L. Yoon |author3=U. Zetsche| title = Cognitive inhibition in depression| journal = Applied and Preventive Psychology| volume = 12| pages = 128–139| year = 2007| url = http://www.psy.miami.edu/faculty/jjoormann/| accessdate = March 3, 2013| doi=10.1016/j.appsy.2007.09.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anger is another important emotion affected by cognitive inhibition. "Trait anger is a robust predictor of the angry and aggressive response to hostile situational input, but it is important to better understand the mechanisms underlying this personality...individuals low in trait anger systematically recruit cognitive control resources within hostile contexts".&lt;ref name=Robinson&gt;{{cite journal| last = Robinson| first = Michael|author2=Benjamin M. Wilkowski |author3=Brian P. Meier |author4=Sara K. Moeller |author5=Adam K. Fetterman | title = Counting to ten milliseconds: Low-anger, but not high-anger, individuals pause following negative evaluations| journal = Cognition and Emotion| pages = 1–21| publisher = Psychology Press| year = 2011| url = http://public.gettysburg.edu/~bmeier/Publications/Robinson%20et%20al.%20(in%20press)%20-%20Counting%20to%20Ten.pdf| accessdate = March 3, 2013 | doi = 10.1080/02699931.2011.579088 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When situations that may elicit anger leading to violence arise, cognitive inhibition is used extensively. Hostile stimuli magnitude are considered and ignored to avoid confrontation. Social context situations that may be interpreted as hostile are processed, and through cognitive inhibition, logic and reasoning are used to handle the situation. When a degree of cognitive inhibition ability is absent in an individual, it can result in "trait anger", or frequent angry and violent outbursts at relatively inoffensive stimuli.&lt;ref name=Robinson /&gt; Without cognitive inhibition and its resulting omission of irrelevant or unimportant information, emotional stability can be compromised.

==Behavioral neuroscience==

[[Behavioral neuroscience]] applies the principles of [[neurobiology]], to the study of physiological, genetic, and developmental mechanisms of behavior.   Cognitive inhibition is caused by several different interacting [[biological]] factors. The first is the existence of inhibitory [[neurotransmitters]], or chemicals emitted by brain cells to both communicate and inhibit communication between each other. "[[GABA]], an inhibitory transmitter substance that has been implicated in certain simple behavioral measures of inhibition and the control of aggressive behavior, was discovered in the [[cerebral cortex]] in substantial quantities".&lt;ref name=Dempster2 /&gt; Given the [[cerebral cortex]]'s importance in many brain functions such as memory and thought, the presence of the inhibitory substance GABA supports the cognitive inhibition processes that go on in this area of the brain. [[Serotonin]] and [[dopamine]], which can play inhibitory roles as well, are present in the brain in large quantities. All three of these [[neurotransmitters]] are capable of "blocking" the transmissions between neurons, which can ultimately result in cognitive inhibition. In addition, the presence of inhibitory connections in the [[central nervous system]] has been firmly demonstrated (Eccles, 1969). A process known as [[lateral inhibition]], which involves the capacity of an excited neuron to reduce the activity of its neighbors, is integral in the biology of cognitive inhibition. It provides much of the [[neural]] background behind it and explains what exactly is going on at the [[cell (biology)|cellular]] level.

==Theory of inefficient inhibition==

Many contemporary cognitive theorists postulate models featuring a central pool "of mental resources that must be allocated to the various operations involved in processing, retaining, and reporting information".&lt;ref name=Dempster /&gt; This means that [[working memory]] and the various areas of the [[brain]] responsible for it are theoretically limited to a finite set of "mental resources" or mental capacity with which to carry out operation. Cognitive inhibition, of course, is responsible for determining what is relevant to the working memory and shuts out what is irrelevant, "freeing up space" and mental capacity needed for more pressing matters. In the theory of inefficient inhibition, cognitive inhibition does not perform its function fully, and a shortage of mental resources leads to decreased performance or inefficiency in tasks that require more mental capacity. While inefficient inhibition can result naturally in individuals diagnosed with mild [[cognitive impairment]], this effect is especially pronounced in [[methamphetamine]]-dependent individuals.&lt;ref name=Salo&gt;{{cite journal | last = Salo | first = Ruth |author2=Thomas E. Nordahl |author3=Kate Possin |author4=Martin Leamon |author5=David R. Gibson |author6=Gantt P. Galloway |author7=Neil M. Flynn |author8=Avishai Henik |author9=Adolf Pfefferbaum |author10=Edith V. Sullivan  | title = Preliminary evidence of reduced cognitive inhibition in methamphetamine-dependent individuals | journal = Psychiatry Research | volume = 111 | pages = 65–74 | doi=10.1016/s0165-1781(02)00111-7  | year = 2002 | url = http://ucdirc.ucdavis.edu/people/papers/salo_nordahl_etal_PR2002.pdf | accessdate = March 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinically, these individuals can be highly distractible and exhibit difficulty focusing, which illustrates the fact that cognitive inhibition is being impaired and that inefficient inhibition is resulting. Because of the nature of the [[psychoactive drug]], the brain is unable or reduced in its capacity to shut out irrelevant stimuli to the task at hand, and so tries to process and respond to any and all stimuli. This is most likely due to the effects of [[methamphetamine]] on inhibitory [[neurotransmitters]] like [[GABA]], discussed in an earlier section.

==Failure and deficits==

If an individual experiences impaired or damaged cognitive inhibition abilities, the psychological results can be extremely debilitating. Patients with [[obsessive compulsive disorder]] can experience the effects of reduced cognitive inhibition. "Failures of inhibition were identified in treatment of adults with OCD.&lt;ref name=Rosenberg&gt;{{cite journal | last = Rosenberg | first = D.R. |author2=Dick, E.L. |author3=O'Hearn, K.M. |author4=Sweeney, J.A. | title = Response-inhibition deficits in obsessive-compulsive disorder; an indicator of dysfunction in frontostriatal circuits | journal = Psychiatry Neuroscience | volume = 22  | issue = 1 | pages = 29–38 | year = 1997 | url = http://www.sci.sdsu.edu/classes/psychology/psy860/readings/ocd.pdf | accessdate = March 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Go/No-Go tasks, subjects have to make a simple motor response (such as pressing a button) as quickly as possible when target stimuli are presented, and withhold the motor response when non-target stimuli are presented. Bannon et al. (2002) found that [[OCD]] patients made significantly more commission errors than matched [[panic]] disorder control subjects in a computerized task necessitating the inhibition of responses on a proportion of trials— OCD patients tended to make inappropriate motor responses to non-target stimuli".&lt;ref name=Chamberlain&gt;{{cite journal | last = Chamberlain | first = S.R. |author2=A.D. Blackwell |author3=N.A. Fineberg |author4=T.W. Robbins |author5=B.J. Sahakin | title = The neuropsychology of obsessive compulsive disorder: the importance of failures in cognitive and behavioural inhibition as candidate endophenotypic markers | journal = Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews | volume = 29 | pages = 399–419 | publisher = Elsevier | year = 2005 | url = http://www.sci.sdsu.edu/classes/psychology/psy860/readings/ocd.pdf | accessdate = March 3, 2013 | doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2004.11.006 | pmid=15820546 | issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidently, the cognitive inhibition that OCD patients experience can have such effects as impairing response time to significant stimuli and decreasing the ability to shut out irrelevant stimuli. This may be why OCD responses to certain stimuli can be difficult to control. [[Suicidal behavior]] may also be related to cognitive inhibition impairment.&lt;ref name=Devantoy&gt;{{cite journal | last = Richard-Devantoy | first = S. |author2=F. Jollant |author3=Z. Kefi |author4=JP Olie |author5=C. Annweiler |author6=O. Beauchet |author7=D. Le Gall  | title = Deficit of cognitive inhibition in depressed elderly: a neurocognitive marker of suicidal risk | journal = Journal of Affective Disorders | volume = 140 | issue = 2 | pages = 193–199 | publisher = Elsevier | year = 2012 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165032712001929 | accessdate = March 3, 2013 | doi=10.1016/j.jad.2012.03.006 | pmid=22464009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one [[meta-analysis]] involving 164 studies, it was discovered that [[executive dysfunction]] and higher cognitive inhibition deficit is positively correlated and more frequently found among patients with suicidal behaviors.&lt;ref name=Devantoy /&gt; In [[attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), studies of cognitive control have not emphasized the ability to actively suppress pre-potent [[mind|mental]] representations.&lt;ref name=Engelhart&gt;{{cite journal | last = Engelhart | first = Paul E. |author2=[[Joel T. Nigg]] |author3=Laurie A. Carr |author4=Fernanda Ferreia  | title = Cognitive Inhibition and Working Memory in Attention-Deficient/Hyperactivity Disorder | journal = Journal of Abnormal Psychology | volume = 117 | issue = 3 | pages = 591–605 | year = 2008 | url = http://libra.msra.cn/Publication/5486706/cognitive-inhibition-and-working-memory-in-attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder | accessdate = March 3, 2013 | doi=10.1037/a0012593 | pmid=18729611}}&lt;/ref&gt; This indicates that people diagnosed with ADHD experience an impaired cognitive inhibition ability and find it difficult to suppress irrelevant stimuli. The result is decreased mental representation control and perhaps a degree of [[working memory]] deficit. Finally, there are age-related effects on an individual's ability to execute cognitive inhibition, which mostly include language impairment. "In language production, older adults' increased word-finding deficits have been explained under ''inhibitory deficit theory'' as a consequence of their reduced ability to inhibit irrelevant words (competitors) that impair retrieval of the target".&lt;ref name=Zacks&gt;{{cite journal | last = Zacks | first = R.T. |author2=L. Hasher | title = Directed ignoring: Inhibitory regulation of working memory | journal = Inhibitory processes in attention, memory, and language | pages = 241–264 | publisher = Academic Press | location = San Diego, CA | year = 1994 | url = http://psychsocgerontology.oxfordjournals.org/content/52B/6/P254.full.pdf | accessdate = March 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When speaking, many older adults experience difficulty "finding" the words they want to use, which is evidence of cognitive inhibition skills not functioning properly. Because they are not omitting synonyms or replacements entirely from their working memory (which can be considered irrelevant stimuli), they exhibit similar types of mental representation degradation that patients with [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[ADHD]], or [[OCD]] indicate.

In [[genetics]], two [[organism]]s that differ in only one [[Locus (genetics)|locus]] and a linked segment of chromosome are defined as '''congenic'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Congenic | title = Congenic - definition from Biology-Online.org | work = Biology-Online.org dictionary | publisher = Biology-Online.org |  access-date = 25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, organisms that are [[Coisogenic strain|coisogenic]] differ in one locus only and not in the surrounding chromosome. Unlike congenic organisms, coisogenic organisms cannot be bred and only occur through spontaneous or targeted mutation at the locus.

==Generating congenic strains==
Congenic strains are generated in the laboratory by mating two inbred strains (usually rats or mice), and back-crossing the descendants 5–10 generations with one of the original strains, known as the ''recipient'' strain. Typically selection for either phenotype or genotype is performed prior to each back-cross generation. In this manner either an interesting phenotype, or a defined chromosomal region assayed by genotype, is passed from the ''donor'' strain onto an otherwise uniform ''recipient'' background.  Congenic mice or rats can then be compared to the pure recipient strain to determine whether they are phenotypically different if selection was for a genotypic region, or to identify the critical genetic locus, if selection was for a phenotype.

Speed congenics can be produced in as little as five back-cross generations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Markel P |title=Theoretical and empirical issues for marker-assisted breeding of congenic mouse strains |journal=Nat. Genet. |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=280–284 |date=November 1997 |pmid=9354790 |doi=10.1038/ng1197-280 |url= |name-list-format=vanc|author2=Shu P |author3=Ebeling C |display-authors=3 |last4=Carlson |first4=George A. |last5=Nagle |first5=Deborah L. |last6=Smutko |first6=John S. |last7=Moore |first7=Karen J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; through the selection at each generation of offspring that not only retain the desired chromosomal fragment, but also 'lose' the maximum amount of background genetic information from the donor strain. This is also known as ''marker-assisted'' congenics, due to the use of genetic markers, typically [[Microsatellite (genetics)|microsatellite]] markers, but now, more commonly, [[single nucleotide polymorphism]] markers (SNPs). The process can be further aided by the [[superovulation]] of females, to produce many more eggs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3803">'''Cosmopolitan localism''' is a [[social innovation]] approach to [[community development]] that seeks to link [[Local community|local]] and [[Global community|global]] communities through resilient infrastructures that bring [[Production (economics)|production]] and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] closer together, building on [[Distributed Systems|distributed systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/983824383|title=Designs for the pluriverse : radical interdependence, autonomy, and the making of worlds|last=1951-|first=Escobar, Arturo,|isbn=9780822370901|location=Durham|oclc=983824383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cosmopolitan localism fosters a global network of mutually supportive communities (neighbourhoods, villages, towns, cities and regions) who share and exchange knowledge, ideas, skills, technology, culture and (where socially and ecologically sustainable) resources. The approach seeks to foster a creative, [[reciprocal relationship]]{{dn|date=November 2018}} between the local and the global. Cosmopolitan localism aims to address problems that emerge from [[globalization]]—namely, the subsuming of local cultures and economies into a homogenised and unsustainable global system&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/53315154|title=The McDonaldization of society|last=George.|first=Ritzer,|date=2004|publisher=Pine Forge Press|isbn=0761988114|edition=Rev. new century |location=Thousand Oaks, Calif.|oclc=53315154}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=When Corporations Rule the World.|date=2016|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/933522026|others=Korten, David C., Burns, Traber|publisher=Audible Studios on Brilliance audio|isbn=9781511397162|oclc=933522026|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;—while simultaneously avoiding the pitfalls of [[Localism (politics)|localization]], such as [[parochialism]] and [[isolationism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41976257|title=The Murray Bookchin reader|last=1921-2006.|first=Bookchin, Murray,|date=1999|publisher=Black Rose Books|others=Biehl, Janet, 1953-|isbn=1551641194|location=Montréal|oclc=41976257}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/18747380|title=The condition of postmodernity : an enquiry into the origins of cultural change|last=1935-|first=Harvey, David,|date=1990|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=0631162925|location=Oxford [England]|oclc=18747380}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian social innovation scholar [[Ezio Manzini]] describes cosmopolitan localism as having the potential to generate a new [[sense of place]]. With cosmopolitan localism, places are not considered isolated entities, but nodes in short-distance and long-distance networks. The short-distance networks generate and regenerate the local socio-economic fabric and the long-distance networks connect a particular community to the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/904398409|title=Design, when everybody designs : an introduction to design for social innovation|last=Ezio,|first=Manzini,|isbn=9780262328630|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|oclc=904398409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wolves Kill.jpg|thumb|right|320px|One wolf (right) asserting dominance over another (left) with a threat display – the teeth are bared, the ears are flattened against the body and the hackles are raised, whereas the submissive wolf lowers its head and turns away to appease the dominant individual.]]
'''Dominance in ethology''' is an "individual's preferential access to resources over another."&lt;ref&gt;Bland J. (2002) About Gender: Dominance and Male Behaviour http://www.gender.org.uk/about/10ethol/a4_mldom.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Dominance in the context of [[biology]] and [[anthropology]] is the state of having high [[social status]] relative to one or more other individuals, who react [[submission|submissively]] to dominant individuals.  This enables the dominant individual to obtain access to resources such as food or potential mates at the expense of the submissive individual, without active aggression.  The absence or reduction of aggression means unnecessary energy expenditure and the risk of injury are reduced for both.  The opposite of dominance is [[Deference|submissiveness]].

Dominance may be a purely dyadic relationship, i.e. individual A is dominant over individual B, but this has no implications for whether either of these is dominant over a third individual C.  Alternatively, dominance may be hierarchical, with a [[transitive relation]]ship, so that if A dominates B and B dominates C, A always dominates C.  This is called a linear [[dominance hierarchy]].  Some animal societies have [[despotism|despots]], i.e. a single dominant individual with little or no hierarchical structure amongst the rest of the group. Horses use coalitions so that affiliated pairs in a herd have an accumulative dominance to displace a third horse that normally out-ranks both of them on an individual basis.&lt;ref name="Blackshaw"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/23945615/Ethology-Book| title=Notes on Some Topics in Applied Animal Behaviour by Judith Blackshaw.|accessdate=August 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Establishment and maintenance==
Dominance may initially be established by fighting, or simply by threatening displays or interchanges.  Once established, however, dominance is usually maintained by agonistic (competitive) behaviours with aggression considerably reduced or sometimes absent.  In the maintenance of dominance relationships, the behaviour of the sub-dominant animal is critical.  If a dominant animal perceives its status is being threatened, it will likely threaten the sub-dominant individual.  The sub-dominant must then either escalate the intensity of the interaction to challenge the dominant, or defer.  In this way, it is often the behaviour of the sub-dominant animal that maintains the dominance relationship, rather than the dominant.

==Functions==

The ultimate function of a dominance hierarchy is to increase the [[Fitness (biology)|individual]] or [[inclusive fitness]] of the animals involved in its formation.  Fighting to acquire resources such as food and mates is expensive in terms of time, energy and the risk of injury.  By developing a dominance hierarchy, animals determine which individuals will get priority of access to resources, particularly when they are limited; there is a reduction in aggression once a pecking order has been developed.  Therefore, the proximate functions of a pecking order are to reduce the costs of time, energy and risk of injury incurred during resource acquisition and defense.

A dominant animal is one whose [[animal sexual behavior|sexual]], feeding, aggressive and other behavior patterns subsequently occur with relatively little influence of the other group members. Subordinate animals are opposite; their behavior can be relatively easily influenced or inhibited by other group members.&lt;ref&gt;Burgoon, J., Johnson, M., &amp; Koch, P. (1998). The nature and measurement of interpersonal dominance. (Volume 65 ed., Vol. Issue 4, pp. 308-335). Communication monograph. Retrieved from http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rcmm20.&lt;/ref&gt; For many animal societies, an individual's position in the dominance hierarchy corresponds with their opportunities to reproduce,&lt;ref&gt;Researchers from University of Washington publish findings in ethology. (2009, August 11). Science Letter, 1136. Retrieved from http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA205165916&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=utoronto_main&amp;it=r&amp;p=AONE&amp;sw=w&lt;/ref&gt; however, in other animal societies, the dominance hierarchy may be unrelated to (potential) opportunities to reproduce, e.g. [[naked mole-rat]], [[bees]] and many farm, laboratory, zoo and companion animals. Studies have shown there is a strong association between high testosterone levels and dominance behaviors that help enhance mating success in men.&lt;ref&gt;Slatcher, R., Mehta, P., &amp; Joseph, R. (2011). Testosterone and Self-Reported Dominance Interact to Influence Human Mating Behavior. ''Social Psychological and Personality Science'' 531-539.&lt;/ref&gt;

In hierarchical societies, dominant individuals may exert control over others.  For example, in a herd of feral goats it is a large male that is dominant and maintains discipline and coherence of the flock. He leads the group but shares leadership on a foraging expedition with an old she-goat who will normally outlast a succession of
dominant males.&lt;ref name="MacKenzie, (1980)"&gt;MacKenzie, D. 1980. Goat Husbandry. 4th Edition. Revised and edited by Jean Laing. Faber and Faber, London and Boston. p.66-85.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, earlier work showed that leadership orders in goats was not related to age or dominance.&lt;ref name="Stewart and Scott, (1947)"&gt;Stewart, J.C. and Scott, J.P. (1947). Lack of correlation between leadership and dominance relationships in a herd of goats. Journal Comparative Physiological Psychology, 40:255-264&lt;/ref&gt;

In sheep, position in a moving flock is highly correlated with social dominance, but there is no definite study to show consistent voluntary leadership by an individual sheep.&lt;ref name="Squires and Daws, (1975)"&gt;Squires, V.R. and Daws, G.T. (1975). Leadership and dominance relationships in Merino and Border Leicester sheep. Applied Animal Ethology, 1:263-274&lt;/ref&gt;

In birds, dominant individuals will preferentially select higher perches to put themselves in the best position to detect and avoid predators, as well as to display their dominance to con-specifics.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Portugal, S. J. |author2=Sivess, L. | author3=Martin, G. R. |author4= Butler, P. J.|author5= White, C. R.| year=2017| title=Perch height predicts dominance rank in birds| journal=Ibis| volume=159| pages=456–462 | doi=10.1111/ibi.12447 | issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested, however, that more commonly, decision-taking about the actions of the group is dissociated from social dominance.&lt;ref&gt;Rowell, T.E. (1974).  The concept of social dominance.  ''Behavioral Biology, 11'', 131-154.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==
The first published systematic study of dominance in animals was by [[Thorleif Schjelderup-Ebbe]] who described in his Ph.D. dissertation of 1921, the social behaviour and priority of access to food by [[Chicken|hens]].
&lt;ref name="Schjelderup-Ebbe, (1922)"&gt;Schjelderup-Ebbe, T. 1922. Beitrage zurSozialpsycholgie des Haushuhns. Zeitschrift Psychologie 88: 225-252. Reprinted in Benchmark Papers in Animal Behaviour/3. Ed. M.W.Schein. 1975&lt;/ref&gt;  This led to the [[colloquial]] term "[[pecking order]]"&lt;ref&gt;Porter G. Perrin (1955) 'Pecking Order' 1927-54 American Speech, 30(4):265-268&lt;/ref&gt; describing the hierarchical system of social organization in chickens, although it is sometimes loosely applied to other animals.

Dominance can be measured by the number of times that individuals defer to one another in social interactions, by the length of time that resources are preferentially accessed, by the number/intensity of threats given or other agonistic (competitive) behaviours.  The measurement of dominance is only applicable within the group it is measured since it is a function of the individual members of the group.

==Context dependency==
[[File:Vache herens.jpg|thumb|right|Eringer cattle competing for dominance.]]

Dominance and its organisation can be highly variable depending on the context or individuals involved.

In [[European badgers]], dominance relationships may vary with time as individuals age, gain or lose social status, or change their reproductive condition.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, S.E., Macdonald, D.W. and Dugdale, H.L. (2009). Context-dependent linear dominance hierarchies in social groups of European badgers, ''Meles meles''. Animal Behaviour, 77: 161-169.&lt;/ref&gt;  Dominance may also vary across space in [[territory (animal)|territorial]] animals as territory owners are often dominant over all others in their own territory but submissive elsewhere, or dependent on the resource. Even with these factors held constant, perfect dominance hierarchies are rarely found in groups of any great size,&lt;ref&gt;Rowell, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; at least in the wild. Dominance hierarchies may be more frequently found in captivity, since hierarchies tend to be induced by focused resources such as limited supplies of food supplied in a fixed place.

Dominance hierarchies in small herds of domestic horses are generally linear hierarchies whereas in large herds the relationships are triangular.&lt;ref name="Houpt et al., (1978)"&gt;Houpt, K.A., Law, K. and Martinisi, V. (1978). Dominance hierarchies in domestic horses. Applied Animal Ethology, 4:273–83.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dominance hierarchies can be formed at a very early age. [[Domestic pig]]lets are highly [[wiktionary:precocious|precocious]] and within minutes of being born, or sometimes seconds, will attempt to suckle.  The piglets are born with sharp teeth and fight to develop a teat order as the [[anterior]] teats produce a greater quantity of milk. Once established, this [[Domestic pig#Teat order|teat order]] remains stable with each piglet tending to feed from a particular teat or group of teats.&lt;ref name="CluttonBrock, (1987)"&gt;Clutton-Brock, J., (1987). A Natural History of Domesticated Mammals. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge pp.73-74&lt;/ref&gt;

Dominance–subordination relationships can vary markedly between breeds of the same species. Studies on [[Merino]]s and [[Border Leicester sheep|Border Leicesters]] revealed an almost linear hierarchy in the Merinos but a less rigid structure in the Border Leicesters when a competitive feeding situation was created.&lt;ref name="Squires and Daws, (1975)"/&gt;

Ecological economics was founded in the 1980s as a modern discipline on the works of and interactions between various European and American academics (see the section on [[#History and development|History and development]] below).

According to ecological economist [[:de:Malte Michael Faber|Malte Faber]], ecological economics is defined by its focus on nature, justice, and time. Issues of [[intergenerational equity]], [[irreversibility]] of environmental change, [[uncertainty]] of long-term outcomes, and [[sustainable development]] guide ecological economic analysis and valuation.&lt;ref name=Faber2008&gt;Malte Faber.

==History and development==
The antecedents of ecological economics can be traced back to the [[Romantics]] of the 19th century as well as some [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] political economists of that era. Concerns over population were expressed by [[Thomas Malthus]], while [[John Stuart Mill]] predicted the [[Steady-state economy #John Stuart Mill's concept of the stationary state|desirability of the ''stationary state'' of an economy]]. Mill thereby anticipated later insights of modern ecological economists, but without having had their experience of the social and ecological costs of the [[Post–World War II economic expansion]]. In 1880, [[Marxian economics|Marxian]] economist [[Sergei Podolinsky]] attempted to theorize a [[labor theory of value]] based on [[embodied energy]]; his work was read and critiqued by [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bellamy Foster|first1=John|first2=Paul|last2=Burkett|title=Ecological Economics and Classical Marxism: The "Podolinsky Business" Reconsidered|journal=Organization &amp; Environment|date=March 2004|volume=Vol. 17, No. 1|pages=32-60|url=http://johnbellamyfoster.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2014/07/OandE-2004-Foster-Burkett-32-60.pdf|accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The debate on energy in economic systems can also be traced back to [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|Nobel prize]]-winning [[radiochemistry|radiochemist]] [[Frederick Soddy]] (1877–1956). In his book ''[[Wealth, Virtual Wealth and Debt]]'' (1926), Soddy criticized the prevailing belief of the economy as a perpetual motion machine, capable of generating infinite wealth—a criticism expanded upon by later ecological economists such as Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen and Herman Daly.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/12/opinion/12zencey.html Zencey, Eric. (2009, April 12). Op-ed. ''New York Times'', p. WK9.] Accessed: December 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

European predecessors of ecological economics include [[K. William Kapp]] (1950)&lt;ref&gt;Kapp, K. W. (1950) ''The Social Costs of Private Enterprise''. New York: Shocken.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Polanyi]] (1944)&lt;ref&gt;Polanyi, K. (1944) ''The Great Transformation''. New York/Toronto: Rinehart &amp; Company Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;, and [[Romania]]n economist [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]] (1971). Georgescu-Roegen, who would later mentor Herman Daly at [[Vanderbilt University]], provided ecological economics with a modern conceptual framework based on the material and energy flows of economic production and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]]. His ''magnum opus'', ''[[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Magnum opus on The Entropy Law and the Economic Process|The Entropy Law and the Economic Process]]'' (1971), is credited by Daly as a fundamental text of the field, alongside Soddy's ''Wealth, Virtual Wealth and Debt''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Georgescu-Roegen |first=Nicholas |date=1971 |title=The Entropy Law and the Economic Process. |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/267519123/The-Entropy-Law-and-the-Economic-Process-by-Nicholas-Georgescu-Roegen-pdf |format=Full book accessible at Scribd |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0674257804 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some key concepts of what is now ecological economics are evident in the writings of [[Kenneth Boulding]] and [[E.F. Schumacher]], whose book ''[[Small Is Beautiful]] &amp;ndash; A Study of Economics as if People Mattered'' (1973) was published just a few years before the first edition of [[Herman Daly]]'s comprehensive and persuasive ''[[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|Steady-State Economics]]'' (1977).&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, E.F. 1973.

The first organized meetings of ecological economists occurred in the 1980s. These began in 1982, at the instigation of Lois Banner,&lt;ref&gt;Røpke, I. (2004) The early history of modern ecological economics. Ecological Economics 50(3-4): 293-314.&lt;/ref&gt; with a meeting held in Sweden (including [[Robert Costanza]], [[Herman Daly]], [[Charles A S Hall|Charles Hall]], Bruce Hannon, [[H.T. Odum]], and David Pimentel).&lt;ref name=EarlyHistory/&gt; Most were ecosystem ecologists or mainstream environmental economists, with the exception of Daly. In 1987, Daly and Costanza edited an issue of ''Ecological Modeling'' to test the waters. A book entitled ''Ecological Economics'', by [[Joan Martinez Alier|Juan Martinez-Alier]], was published later that year.&lt;ref name=EarlyHistory&gt;Costanza R. (2003).

[[Robert Costanza]] was the first president of the society and first editor of the journal, which is currently edited by Richard Howarth. Other figures include ecologists [[C.S. Holling]] and [[H.T. Odum]], biologist Gretchen Daily, and physicist [[Robert Ayres (scientist)|Robert Ayres]]. In the [[Marxian economics|Marxian]] tradition, sociologist [[John Bellamy Foster]] and CUNY geography professor [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] explicitly center ecological concerns in [[political economy]].

== Nature and ecology ==

{{Main article|Nature|Ecology}}

[[File:Diagram of natural resource flows.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2 |Natural resources flow through the economy and end up as waste and pollution]]

A simple [[circular flow of income]] diagram is replaced in ecological economics by a more complex flow diagram reflecting the input of solar energy, which sustains natural inputs and environmental services which are then used as units of [[Production (economics)|production]]. Once consumed, natural inputs pass out of the economy as pollution and waste. The potential of an environment to provide services and materials is referred to as an "environment's source function", and this function is depleted as resources are consumed or pollution contaminates the resources. The "sink function" describes an environment's ability to absorb and render harmless waste and pollution: when waste output exceeds the limit of the sink function, long-term damage occurs.&lt;ref name=Harris2006&gt;Harris J. (2006). ''Environmental and Natural Resource Economics: A Contemporary Approach''. Houghton Mifflin Company.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8}} Some persistent pollutants, such as some organic pollutants and nuclear waste are absorbed very slowly or not at all; ecological economists emphasize minimizing "cumulative pollutants".&lt;ref name=Harris2006/&gt;{{rp|28}} Pollutants affect human health and the health of the ecosystem.

The economic value of natural capital and [[ecosystem services]] is accepted by mainstream environmental economics, but is emphasized as especially important in ecological economics. Ecological economists may begin by estimating how to maintain a stable environment before assessing the cost in dollar terms.&lt;ref name=Harris2006/&gt;{{rp|9}} Ecological economist [[Robert Costanza]] led an attempted valuation of the global ecosystem in 1997. Initially published in ''Nature'', the article concluded on $33 trillion with a range from $16 trillion to $54 trillion (in 1997, total global [[GDP]] was $27 trillion).&lt;ref name=Costanza1998&gt;{{cite journal | author = Costanza R | year = 1998 | title = The value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital1 | journal = Ecological Economics | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–15 | doi = 10.1016/S0921-8009(98)00020-2 | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0921800998000202|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Half of the value went to [[nutrient cycling]]. The open oceans, continental shelves, and estuaries had the highest total value, and the highest per-hectare values went to estuaries, swamps/floodplains, and seagrass/algae beds. The work was criticized by articles in ''[[Ecological Economics (journal)|Ecological Economics]]'' Volume 25, Issue 1, but the critics acknowledged the positive potential for economic valuation of the global ecosystem.&lt;ref name=Harris2006/&gt;{{rp|129}}

The Earth's [[carrying capacity]] is a central issue in ecological economics. Early economists such as [[Thomas Malthus]] pointed out the finite carrying capacity of the earth, which was also central to the MIT study ''[[Limits to Growth]]''. [[Diminishing returns]] suggest that productivity increases will slow if major technological progress is not made. Food production may become a problem, as [[erosion]], an impending [[water crisis]], and [[soil salinity]] (from [[irrigation]]) reduce the productivity of agriculture. Ecological economists argue that [[industrial agriculture]], which exacerbates these problems, is not [[sustainable agriculture]], and are generally inclined favorably to [[organic farming]], which also reduces the output of carbon.&lt;ref name=Harris2006/&gt;{{rp|26}}

Global [[wild fisheries]] are believed to have peaked and begun a decline, with valuable habitat such as estuaries in critical condition.&lt;ref name=Harris2006/&gt;{{rp|28}} The [[aquaculture]] or [[fish farm|farming]] of [[piscivorous]] fish, like [[salmon]], does not help solve the problem because they need to be fed products from other fish.

Since [[animal]]s are higher on the [[trophic level]], they are less efficient sources of food energy. Reduced consumption of meat would reduce the demand for food, but as nations develop, they tend to adopt high-meat diets similar to that of the United States. [[Genetically modified food]] (GMF) a conventional solution to the problem, presents numerous problems &amp;ndash; [[Bt corn]] produces its own [[Bacillus thuringiensis]] toxin/protein, but the pest resistance is believed to be only a matter of time.&lt;ref name=Harris2006/&gt;{{rp|31}} The overall effect of GMF on yields is contentious, with the USDA and FAO acknowledging that GMFs do not necessarily have higher yields and may even have reduced yields.&lt;ref&gt;Soil Association.

[[Global warming]] is now widely acknowledged as a major issue, with all national scientific academies [[scientific opinion on climate change|expressing agreement]] on the importance of the issue. As the population growth intensifies and energy demand increases, the world faces an [[energy crisis]]. Some economists and scientists forecast a global ecological crisis if energy use is not contained &amp;ndash; the [[Stern report]] is an example. The disagreement has sparked a vigorous debate on issue of [[discounting]] and intergenerational equity.

== Ethics ==
{{See also|Environmental ethics}}{{Renewable energy sources}}

[[Mainstream economics]] has attempted to become a value-free '[[hard and soft science|hard science]]', but ecological economists argue that value-free economics is generally not realistic. Ecological economics is more willing to entertain alternative conceptions of [[utility]], [[efficiency]], and [[cost-benefit analysis|cost-benefits]] such as positional analysis or multi-criteria analysis. Ecological economics is typically viewed as economics for [[sustainable development]],&lt;ref&gt;Soderbaum P. (2004).

Internet Encyclopaedia of Ecological Economics.&lt;/ref&gt; and may have goals similar to [[green politics]].

=== Green economics ===
In international, regional, and national policy circles, the concept of the ''green economy'' grew in popularity as a response to the financial predicament at first then became a vehicle for growth and development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bina|first=O.|date=2011|title=Promise and shortcomings of a green turn in recent policy responses to the ‘double crisis’|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/geo2.36|journal=Ecological Economics|volume=70|pages=2308–2316|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[https://www.unenvironment.org/explore-topics/green-economy United Nations Environment Program]'' (UNEP) defines a ‘green economy’ as one that focuses on the human aspects and natural influences and an economic order that can generate high-salary jobs. In 2011, its definition was further developed as the word ‘green’ is made to refer to an economy that is not only resourceful and well-organized but also impartial, guaranteeing an objective shift to an [https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/126GER_synthesis_en.pdf economy that is low-carbon, resource-efficient, and socially-inclusive].

The ideas and studies regarding the green economy denote a fundamental shift for more effective, resourceful, environment-friendly and resource‐saving technologies that could lessen emissions and alleviate the adverse consequences of climate change, at the same time confront issues about resource exhaustion and grave environmental dilapidation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Janicke|first=M.|date=2012|title=‘Green growth’: from a growing eco‐industry to economic sustainability|url=|journal=Energy Policy|volume=28|pages=13-21|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an indispensable requirement and vital precondition to realizing sustainable development, the [http://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/pdf/green_economy_in_action_eng.pdf Green Economy] adherents robustly promote good governance. To boost local investments and foreign ventures, it is crucial to have a constant and foreseeable macroeconomic atmosphere. Likewise, such an environment will also need to be transparent and accountable. In the absence of a substantial and solid governance structure, the prospect of shifting towards a sustainable development route would be insignificant. In achieving a green economy, competent institutions and governance systems are vital in guaranteeing the efficient execution of strategies, guidelines, campaigns, and programmes. 

Shifting to a Green Economy demands a fresh mindset and an innovative outlook of doing business. It likewise necessitates new capacities, skills set from labor and professionals who can competently function across sectors, and able to work as effective components within multi-disciplinary teams. To achieve this goal, vocational training packages must be developed with focus on greening the sectors. Simultaneously, the educational system needs to be assessed as well in order to fit in the environmental and social considerations of various disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;UNEP, 2012.

=== Green politics ===

== Schools of thought ==
Various competing schools of thought exist in the field. Some are close to resource and environmental economics while others are far more heterodox in outlook. An example of the latter is the ''European Society for Ecological Economics''.  An example of the former is the Swedish ''Beijer International Institute of Ecological Economics.'' [[Clive Spash]] has argued for the classification of the ecological economics movement, and more generally work by different economic schools on the environment, into three main categories.  These are the mainstream new resource economists, the new environmental pragmatists,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clivespash.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Spash_NEP_2009_EV.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and the more radical social ecological economists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clivespash.org/2011_Spash_AJES_Social_Ecol_Econ.pdf |title=Spash, C.L.

== Differentiation from mainstream schools ==
Some ecological economists prioritise adding natural capital to the typical [[capital asset]] analysis of land, labor, and financial capital. These ecological economists then use tools from [[mathematical economics]] as in mainstream economics, but may apply them more closely to the natural world. Whereas mainstream economists tend to be technological optimists, ecological economists are inclined to be technological sceptics. They reason that the natural world has a limited carrying capacity and that its resources may run out. Since destruction of important environmental resources could be practically irreversible and catastrophic, ecological economists are inclined to justify cautionary measures based on the [[precautionary principle]].&lt;ref&gt;Costanza R. (1989). What is ecological economics? ''Ecological Economics'' '''1''':1-7. [http://www.uvm.edu/giee/publications/Costanza_EE_1989.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

The most cogent example of how the different theories treat similar assets is [[tropical rainforest]] ecosystems, most obviously the Yasuni region of [[Ecuador]].  While this area has substantial deposits of [[bitumen]] it is also one of the most diverse ecosystems on Earth and some estimates establish it has over 200 undiscovered medical substances in its genomes - most of which would be destroyed by logging the forest or mining the bitumen.  Effectively, the [[instructional capital]] of the genomes is undervalued by analyses which view the rainforest primarily as a source of wood, oil/tar and perhaps food. Increasingly the [[carbon credit]] for leaving the extremely carbon-intensive ("dirty") bitumen in the ground is also valued - the government of Ecuador set a price of US$350M for an oil lease with the intent of selling it to someone committed to never exercising it at all and instead preserving the rainforest.

While this natural capital and ecosystems services approach has proven popular amongst many it has also been contested as failing to address the underlying problems with mainstream economics, growth, market capitalism and monetary valuation of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Martinez-Alier, J., 1994. Ecological economics and ecosocialism, in: O'Connor, M. (Ed.), Is Capitalism Sustainable? Guilford Press, New York, pp. 23-36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spash, C.L., Clayton, A.M.H., 1997.

== Topics ==
Among the topics addressed by ecological economics are methodology, allocation of resources, weak versus strong sustainability, energy economics, energy accounting and balance, environmental services, cost shifting, and modeling.

=== Methodology ===
{{Thermodynamics|cTopic=[[Laws of thermodynamics]]}}
A primary objective of ecological economics (EE) is to ground economic thinking and practice in physical reality, especially in the laws of physics (particularly the [[laws of thermodynamics]]) and in knowledge of biological systems.  It accepts as a goal the improvement of human well-being through development, and seeks to ensure achievement of this through planning for the sustainable development of ecosystems and societies. Of course the terms development and sustainable development are far from lacking controversy. [[Richard B. Norgaard]] argues traditional economics has hi-jacked the development terminology in his book ''Development Betrayed''.&lt;ref&gt;Norgaard, R. B. (1994) Development Betrayed: The End of Progress and a Coevolutionary Revisioning of the Future. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

Well-being in ecological economics is also differentiated from welfare as found in mainstream economics and the 'new welfare economics' from the 1930s which informs resource and environmental economics.  This entails a limited preference utilitarian conception of value i.e., Nature is valuable to our economies, that is because people will pay for its services such as clean air, clean water, encounters with wilderness, etc.

Ecological economics is distinguishable from [[neoclassical economics]] primarily by its assertion that the economy is embedded within an environmental system. Ecology deals with the energy and matter transactions of life and the Earth, and the human economy is by definition contained within this system. Ecological economists argue that [[neoclassical economics]] has ignored the environment, at best considering it to be a subset of the human economy.

The neoclassical view ignores much of what the natural sciences have taught us about the contributions of nature to the creation of wealth e.g., the planetary endowment of scarce matter and energy, along with the complex and biologically diverse ecosystems that provide goods and [[ecosystem services]] directly to human communities: micro- and macro-climate regulation, water recycling, water purification, storm water regulation, waste absorption, food and medicine production, pollination, protection from solar and cosmic radiation, the view of a starry night sky, etc.

There has then been a move to regard such things as [[natural capital]] and ecosystems functions as goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;Daily, G.C. 1997. ''Nature's Services: Societal Dependence on Natural Ecosystems''. Washington, D.C.: Island Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. 2005. ''Ecosystems and Human Well-Being: Biodiversity Synthesis''. Washington, D.C.: World Resources Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this is far from uncontroversial within ecology or ecological economics due to the potential for narrowing down values to those found in mainstream economics and the danger of merely regarding Nature as a commodity.  This has been referred to as ecologists 'selling out on Nature'.&lt;ref&gt;McCauley, D. J. (2006) Selling out on nature. Nature 443(7): 27-28&lt;/ref&gt;  There is then a concern that ecological economics has failed to learn from the extensive literature in [[environmental ethics]] about how to structure a plural value system.

=== Allocation of resources ===
[[File:Uneconomic Growth diagram.jpg|thumb|The marginal costs of a growing economy may gradually exceed the marginal benefits, however measured.]]
[[Resource economics|Resource]] and [[neoclassical economics]] focus primarily on the efficient allocation of resources and less on the two other problems of importance to ecological economics: [[Distribution (economics)|distribution]] ([[equity (economics)|equity]]), and the scale of the economy relative to the ecosystems upon which it relies.&lt;ref name="Daly"&gt;Daly, H. and Farley, J. 2004. ''Ecological Economics: Principles and Applications''. Washington: Island Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Ecological economics makes a clear distinction between growth (quantitative increase in economic output) and development (qualitative improvement of the [[quality of life]]), while arguing that [[neoclassical economics]] confuses the two. Ecological economists point out that beyond modest levels, increased per-capita [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] (the typical economic measure of "standard of living") may not always lead to improvement in human well-being, but may have harmful effects on the environment and broader societal well-being. This situation is sometimes referred to as [[uneconomic growth]] (see diagram above).

&lt;/imagemap&gt;

Ecological economics challenges the conventional approach towards natural resources, claiming that it undervalues natural capital by considering it as interchangeable with human-made capital—labor and technology.

The impending depletion of natural resources and increase of climate-changing greenhouse gasses should motivate us to examine how political, economic and social policies can benefit from alternative energy. Shifting dependence on fossil fuels with specific interest within just one of the above-mentioned factors easily benefits at least one other. For instance, photo voltaic (or solar) panels have a 15% efficiency when absorbing the sun's energy, but its construction demand has increased 120% within both commercial and residential properties. Additionally, this construction has led to a roughly 30% increase in work demands (Chen).

The potential for the substitution of man-made capital for natural capital is an important debate in ecological economics and the economics of sustainability.
There is a continuum of views among economists between the strongly neoclassical positions of [[Robert Solow]] and [[Martin Weitzman]], at one extreme and the [[Pessimism #Entropy pessimism|'entropy pessimists']], notably [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]] and [[Herman Daly]], at the other.&lt;ref&gt;Ayres, R.U. 2007. On the practical limits of substitution. Ecological Economics 61: 115-128.&lt;/ref&gt;

Neoclassical economists tend to maintain that man-made capital can, in principle, replace all types of natural capital.  This is known as the [[Strong vs Weak sustainability|weak sustainability]] view, essentially that every technology can be improved upon or replaced by innovation, and that there is a substitute for any and all scarce materials.

At the other extreme, the [[Strong vs Weak sustainability|strong sustainability]] view argues that the stock of natural resources and ecological functions are irreplaceable.  From the premises of strong sustainability, it follows that [[economic policy]] has a [[fiduciary]] responsibility to the greater ecological world, and that sustainable development must therefore take a different approach to valuing natural resources and ecological functions.

Recently, Stanislav Shmelev developed a new methodology for the assessment of progress at the macro scale based on multi-criteria methods, which allows consideration of different perspectives, including strong and weak sustainability or conservationists vs industrialists and aims to search for a 'middle way' by providing a strong neo-Keynesian economic push without putting excessive pressure on the natural resources, including water or producing emissions, both directly and indirectly.&lt;ref&gt;Shmelev, S.E. 2012.

{{Main article|Energy economics}}
A key concept of energy economics is [[net energy gain]], which recognizes that all energy requires energy to produce.  To be useful the energy return on energy invested (''[[EROEI]]'') has to be greater than one.  The net energy gain from production coal, oil and gas has declined over time as the easiest to produce sources have been most heavily depleted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Energy and Resource Quality: The ecology of the Economic Process |last1=Hall |first1=Charles A.S. |authorlink=

Ecological economics generally rejects the view of [[energy economics]] that growth in the energy supply is related directly to well being, focusing instead on [[biodiversity]] and [[creativity]] - or natural capital and [[individual capital]], in the terminology sometimes adopted to describe these economically. In practice, ecological economics focuses primarily on the key issues of [[uneconomic growth]] and [[quality of life]]. Ecological economists are inclined to acknowledge that much of what is important in human well-being is not analyzable from a strictly economic standpoint and suggests an interdisciplinary approach combining social and natural sciences as a means to address this.

[[Thermoeconomics]] is based on the proposition that the role of energy in [[biological evolution]] should be defined and understood through the [[second law of thermodynamics]], but also in terms of such economic criteria as [[productivity]], [[Economic efficiency|efficiency]], and especially the costs and benefits (or profitability) of the various mechanisms for capturing and utilizing available energy to build biomass and do work.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter A. Corning]] 1 *, Stephen J. Kline. (2000). [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/71007254/ABSTRACT Thermodynamics, information and life revisited, Part II: Thermoeconomics and Control information ] Systems Research and Behavioral Science, Apr. 07, Volume 15, Issue 6, Pages 453 – 482&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Corning|Corning, P.]] (2002). “[http://www.complexsystems.org/abstracts/thermoec.html Thermoeconomics – Beyond the Second Law] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922072349/http://www.complexsystems.org/abstracts/thermoec.html |date=2008-09-22 }}” – source: www.complexsystems.org&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, thermoeconomics is often discussed in the field of ecological economics, which itself is related to the fields of sustainability and sustainable development.

[[Exergy]] analysis is performed in the field of [[industrial ecology]] to use energy more efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exergy.se/goran/thesis/ |title=Exergy - a useful concept |author=Wall, Göran |publisher=Exergy.se |accessdate=2012-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''exergy'', was coined by [[Zoran Rant]] in 1956, but the concept was developed by [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|J. Willard Gibbs]]. In recent decades, utilization of exergy has spread outside of physics and engineering to the fields of industrial ecology, ecological economics, [[systems ecology]], and [[energetics]].

=== Energy accounting and balance ===
{{See also|Net energy gain}}

An [[Energy accounting|energy balance]] can be used to track energy through a system, and is a very useful tool for determining resource use and environmental impacts, using the First and Second laws of [[thermodynamics]], to determine how much energy is needed at each point in a system, and in what form that energy is a cost in various environmental issues.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="Cutler" /&gt; --&gt; The energy accounting system keeps track of energy in, energy out, and non-useful energy versus [[work done]], and transformations within the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://telstar.ote.cmu.edu/environ/m3/s3/05account.shtml |title=Environmental Decision making, Science and Technology |publisher=Telstar.ote.cmu.edu |accessdate=2012-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105164509/http://telstar.ote.cmu.edu/environ/m3/s3/05account.shtml |archivedate=2010-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists have written and speculated on different aspects of energy accounting.&lt;ref&gt;Stabile, Donald R.

=== Ecosystem services and their valuation ===
{{see also|Ecosystem valuation|Price of life}}
Ecological economists agree that ecosystems produce enormous flows of goods and services to human beings, playing a key role in producing well-being. At the same time, there is intense debate about how and when to place values on these benefits&lt;ref&gt; Farley, Joshua. "Ecosystem services: The economics debate." Ecosystem services 1.1 (2012): 40-49. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2012.07.002 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kallis, Giorgos, Erik Gómez-Baggethun, and Christos Zografos. "To value or not to value? That is not the question." Ecological economics 94 (2013): 97-105. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2013.07.002&lt;/ref&gt;.

A study was carried out by Costanza and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Costanza, R. |author2=d'Arge, R. |author3=de Groot, R. |author4=Farber, S. |author5=Grasso, M. |author6=Hannon, B. |author7=Naeem, S. |author8=Limburg, K. |author9=Paruelo, J. |author10=O'Neill, R.V. |author11=Raskin, R. |author12=Sutton, P. |author13=and van den Belt, M. |year=1997 |title=The value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital |journal=Nature |volume=387 |issue=6630 |pages=253–260 |url=http://www.esd.ornl.gov/benefits_conference/nature_paper.pdf |doi=10.1038/387253a0 |bibcode=1997Natur.387..253C |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730185431/http://www.esd.ornl.gov/benefits_conference/nature_paper.pdf |archivedate=2012-07-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to determine the 'value' of the services provided by the environment. This was determined by averaging values obtained from a range of studies conducted in very specific context and then transferring these without regard to that context.  Dollar figures were averaged to a per hectare number for different types of ecosystem e.g. wetlands, oceans. A total was then produced which came out at 33 trillion US dollars (1997 values), more than twice the total [[GDP]] of the world at the time of the study.  This study was criticized by pre-ecological and even some [[Environmental economics|environmental economists]] - for being inconsistent with assumptions of [[financial capital]] [[valuation (finance)|valuation]] - and ecological economists - for being inconsistent with an ecological economics focus on biological and physical indicators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Norgaard, R.B.  |author2=Bode, C. |year=1998|title= Next, the value of God, and other reactions|journal=Ecological Economics|volume= 25|pages= 37–39|doi=10.1016/s0921-8009(98)00012-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reducing human bodies to financial values is a necessary part of mainstream economics and not always in the direct terms of [[insurance]] or [[wages]].  Economics, in principle, assumes that conflict is reduced by agreeing on voluntary contractual relations and prices instead of simply fighting or coercing or tricking others into providing goods or services.  In doing so, a provider agrees to surrender time and take bodily risks and other (reputation, financial) risks.  Ecosystems are no different from other bodies economically except insofar as they are far less replaceable than typical labour or commodities.

Despite these issues, many ecologists and conservation biologists are pursuing [[ecosystem valuation]]. [[Biodiversity]] measures in particular appear to be the most promising way to reconcile financial and ecological values, and there are many active efforts in this regard.  The growing field of [[biodiversity finance]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialedge.org/features/opportunities/archive/2008/02/23/weblogentry.2008-02-20.6191038944 SocialEdge.org.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215083840/http://www.socialedge.org/features/opportunities/archive/2008/02/23/weblogentry.2008-02-20.6191038944 |date=2009-02-15 }} Accessed: December 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; began to emerge in 2008 in response to many specific proposals such as the Ecuadoran Yasuni proposal&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sosyasuni.org/en/News/Ecuadors-Oil-Change-An-Exporters-Historic-Proposal.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621054850/http://www.sosyasuni.org/en/News/Ecuadors-Oil-Change-An-Exporters-Historic-Proposal.html|date=June 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.multinationalmonitor.org/mm2007/092007/koenig.html Multinational Monitor, 9/2007.] Accessed: December 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; or similar ones in the [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]].

However [[Peter Barnes (entrepreneur)|Peter Barnes]] and other commentators have recently argued that a guardianship/trustee/commons model is far more effective and takes the decisions out of the political realm.

Commodification of other ecological relations as in [[carbon credit]] and direct payments to farmers to preserve [[ecosystem services]] are likewise examples that enable private parties to play more direct roles protecting biodiversity, but is also controversial in ecological economics&lt;ref&gt;Spash, Clive L. "The brave new world of carbon trading." New Political Economy 15.2 (2010): 169-195 &lt;/ref&gt;.  The [[United Nations]] [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] achieved near-universal agreement in 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.panna.org/jt/agAssessment |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621193253/http://www.panna.org/jt/AgAssessment |archivedate=2008-06-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that such payments directly valuing ecosystem preservation and encouraging [[permaculture]] were the only practical way out of a food crisis.

=== Not 'externalities', but cost shifting ===

Ecological economics is founded upon the view that the neoclassical economics (NCE) assumption that environmental and community costs and benefits are mutually canceling ''"[[externalities]]"'' is not warranted. [[Joan Martinez Alier]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Costanza|first=Robert|title=Getting Down to Earth: Practical Applications of Ecological Economics|year=1996|publisher=Island Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=1559635037|author2=Segura, Olman |author3=Olsen, Juan Martinez-Alier }}&lt;/ref&gt; for instance shows that the bulk of consumers are automatically excluded from having an impact upon the prices of commodities, as these consumers are future generations who have not been born yet.  The assumptions behind future discounting, which assume that future goods will be cheaper than present goods, has been criticized by David Pearce&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, David "Blueprint for a Green Economy"&lt;/ref&gt; and by the recent [[Stern Report]] (although the Stern report itself does employ discounting and has been criticized for this and other reasons by ecological economists such as [[Clive Spash]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clivespash.org/EE2007_SpashonStern.pdf |title=Spash, C. L. (2007) The economics of climate change impacts à la Stern: Novel and nuanced or rhetorically restricted?

Concerning these externalities, some like the eco-businessman [[Paul Hawken]] argue an orthodox economic line that the only reason why goods produced unsustainably are usually cheaper than goods produced sustainably is due to a hidden subsidy, paid by the non-monetized human environment, community or future generations.&lt;ref&gt;Hawken, Paul (1994) "The Ecology of Commerce" (Collins)&lt;/ref&gt;  These arguments are developed further by Hawken, Amory and Hunter Lovins to promote their vision of an environmental capitalist utopia in ''[[Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hawken, Paul; Amory and Hunter Lovins (2000) "Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution" (Back Bay Books)&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, ecological economists, like Joan Martinez-Alier, appeal to a different line of reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;Martinez-Alier, Joan (2002) The Environmentalism of the Poor: A Study of Ecological Conflicts and Valuation. Cheltenham, Edward Elgar&lt;/ref&gt;  Rather than assuming some (new) form of capitalism is the best way forward, an older ecological economic critique questions the very idea of internalizing externalities as providing some corrective to the current system. The work by [[Karl William Kapp]] explains why the concept of "externality" is a misnomer.&lt;ref&gt;Kapp, Karl William (1963) The Social Costs of Business Enterprise. Bombay/London, Asia Publishing House.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact the modern business enterprise operates on the basis of shifting costs onto others as normal practice to make profits.&lt;ref&gt;Kapp, Karl William (1971) Social costs, neo-classical economics and environmental planning. The Social Costs of Business Enterprise, 3rd edition. K. W. Kapp. Nottingham, Spokesman: 305-318&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Eisenstein]] has argued that this method of privatising profits while socialising the costs through externalities, passing the costs to the community, to the natural environment or to future generations is inherently destructive.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenstein , Charles (2011), "Sacred Economics: Money, Gift and Society in an Age in Transition" (Evolver Editions)&lt;/ref&gt; As social ecological economist [[Clive Spash]] has noted, externality theory fallaciously assumes environmental and social problems are minor aberrations in an otherwise perfectly functioning efficient economic system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Spash, Clive L. |date= 16 July 2010 |title= The brave new world of carbon trading |journal= New Political Economy |volume= 15 |pages=169–195 |publisher= Taylor and Francis Online |issue= 2 |doi= 10.1080/13563460903556049 |url= http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/19114/1/MPRA_paper_19114.pdf }} Copy also available at {{cite web|url=http://www.clivespash.org/2010_Spash_Brave_New_World_NPE.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510185658/http://clivespash.org/2010_Spash_Brave_New_World_NPE.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Internalizing the odd externality does nothing to address the structural systemic problem and fails to recognize the all pervasive nature of these supposed 'externalities'.

Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci. 2010 Jan 12;365(1537):5–11.&lt;/ref&gt; While this idea is becoming more and more accepted among ecologists and conservationist, some argue that it is inherently false.
 
McCauley argues that ecological economics and the resulting ecosystem service based conservation can be harmful.&lt;ref&gt;McCauley D. Selling out on nature. Nature. 2006;443(September):7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; He describes four main problems with this approach:

Firstly, it seems to be assumed that all ecosystem services are financially beneficial. This is undermined by a basic characteristic of ecosystems: they do not act specifically in favour of any single species. While certain services might be very useful to us, such as [[coastal protection]] from [[hurricanes]] by [[mangrove]]s for example, others might cause financial or personal harm, such as wolves hunting [[cattle]].&lt;ref&gt;Mech LD. The Challenge and Opportunity of Recovering Wolf Populations. Conserv Biol. 1995 Apr;9(2):270–8&lt;/ref&gt; The complexity of Eco-systems makes it challenging to weigh up the value of a given species. Wolves play a critical role in regulating prey populations; the absence of such an apex predator in the Scottish Highlands has caused the over population of deer, preventing afforestation, which increases the risk of flooding and damage to property.
 
Secondly, allocating monetary value to nature would make its conservation reliant on markets that fluctuate. This can lead to [[devaluation]] of services that were previously considered financially beneficial. Such is the case of the bees in a forest near former [[coffee plantation]]s in Finca Santa Fe, [[Costa Rica]]. The [[pollination]] services were valued to over US$60,000 a year, but soon after the study, coffee prices dropped and the fields were replanted with pineapple.&lt;ref&gt;Ricketts TH, Daily GC, Ehrlich PR, Michener CD. Economic value of tropical forest to coffee production. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Aug 24;101(34):12579–82&lt;/ref&gt; Pineapple does not require bees to be pollinated, so the value of their service dropped to zero.

Thirdly, conservation programmes for the sake of financial benefit underestimate human ingenuity to invent and replace ecosystem services by artificial means. McCauley argues that such proposals are deemed to have a short lifespan as the history of [[technology]] is about how Humanity developed [[artificial]] alternatives to nature’s services and with time passing the cost of such services tend to decrease. This would also lead to the devaluation of [[ecosystem services]].

Lastly, it should not be assumed that conserving ecosystems is always financially beneficial as opposed to alteration. In the case of the introduction of the [[Nile perch]] to [[Lake Victoria]], the ecological consequence was decimation of native [[fauna]]. However, this same event is praised by the local communities as they gain significant financial benefits from trading the fish.

McCauley argues that, for these reasons, trying to convince decision-makers to conserve nature for [[monetary]] reasons is not the path to be followed, and instead appealing to morality is the ultimate way to campaign for the protection of nature.

EPSs are mostly composed of [[polysaccharide]]s (exopolysaccharides) and proteins, but include other macro-molecules such as [[DNA]], [[lipid]]s and [[Humic acid|humic]] substances.  EPSs are the construction material of bacterial settlements and either remain attached to the cell's outer surface, or are secreted into its growth medium.

'''Exopolysaccharides''' (also sometimes abbreviated '''EPSs''') are high-molecular-weight polymers that are composed of sugar residues and are secreted by a [[microorganism]] into the surrounding environment. Microorganisms synthesize a wide spectrum of multifunctional [[polysaccharide]]s including intracellular polysaccharides, structural polysaccharides and extracellular polysaccharides or exopolysaccharides. Exopolysaccharides generally consist of monosaccharides and some non-carbohydrate substituents (such as [[acetate]], [[pyruvate]], [[succinate]], and [[phosphate]]). Owing to the wide diversity in composition, exopolysaccharides have found multifarious applications in various food and pharmaceutical industries. Many microbial EPSs provide properties that are almost identical to the [[Natural gum|gum]]s currently in use. With innovative approaches, efforts are underway to supersede the traditionally used plant and algal gums by their microbial counterparts. Moreover, considerable progress has been made in discovering and developing new microbial EPSs that possess novel [[industrial significance]].&lt;ref name=10suresh&gt;{{cite book |author=Suresh and Mody|year=2009|chapter=Microbial Exopolysaccharides: Variety and Potential Applications|title=Microbial Production of Biopolymers and Polymer Precursors|publisher=Caister Academic Press|isbn = 978-1-904455-36-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==
Capsular exopolysaccharides can protect pathogenic bacteria against desiccation and predation, and contribute to their pathogenicity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ghosh|first=Pallab Kumar|last2=Maiti|first2=Tushar Kanti|title=Structure of Extracellular Polysaccharides (EPS) Produced by Rhizobia and their Functions in Legume–Bacteria Symbiosis: — A Review|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.als.2016.11.003|journal=Achievements in the Life Sciences|volume=10|issue=2|pages=136–143|doi=10.1016/j.als.2016.11.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bacteria existing in biofilms are less vulnerable compared to planktonic bacteria, as the EPS matrix is able to act as a protective diffusion barrier.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harimawan|first=Ardiyan|last2=Ting|first2=Yen-Peng|date=2016-10-01|title=Investigation of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) properties of P. aeruginosa and B. subtilis and their role in bacterial adhesion|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927776516304696|journal=Colloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces|volume=146|issue=Supplement C|pages=459–467|doi=10.1016/j.colsurfb.2016.06.039}}&lt;/ref&gt; The physical and chemical characteristics of bacterial cells can be affected by EPS composition, influencing factors such as cellular recognition, aggregation, and adhesion in their natural environments.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Furthermore, the EPS layer acts as a nutrient trap, facilitating bacterial growth.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The exopolysaccharides of some strains of lactic acid bacteria, e.g., [[Lactococcus lactis]] subsp. cremoris, contribute a gelatinous texture to fermented milk products (e.g., [[Viili]]), and these polysaccharides are also digestible.&lt;ref name="WelmanAD2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Bacterial Polysaccharides: Current Innovations and Future Trends|author=Welman AD|publisher=Caister Academic Press|year=2009|isbn=978-1-904455-45-5|chapter=Exploitation of Exopolysaccharides from lactic acid bacteria}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LjunghWadstrom2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Lactobacillus Molecular Biology: From Genomics to Probiotics|author=Ljungh A, Wadstrom T (editors)|publisher=Caister Academic Press|year=2009|isbn=978-1-904455-41-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example for industrial use of exopolysaccharides is the application of dextran in panettone and other breads in the bakery industry.&lt;ref name="UllrichM2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Bacterial Polysaccharides: Current Innovations and Future Trends|author=Ullrich M (editor)|publisher=Caister Academic Press|year=2009|isbn=978-1-904455-45-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ecology ===
Exopolysaccharides can facilitate the attachment of [[nitrogen-fixing bacteria]] to plant roots and soil particles, which mediates a symbiotic relationship.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ghosh|first=Pallab Kumar|last2=Maiti|first2=Tushar Kanti|title=Structure of Extracellular Polysaccharides (EPS) Produced by Rhizobia and their Functions in Legume–Bacteria Symbiosis: — A Review|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.als.2016.11.003|journal=Achievements in the Life Sciences|volume=10|issue=2|pages=136–143|doi=10.1016/j.als.2016.11.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is important for colonization of roots and the [[rhizosphere]], which is a key component of soil food webs and nutrient cycling in ecosystems. It also allows for successful invasion and infection of the host plant.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Bacterial extracellular polymeric substances can aid in [[bioremediation]] of heavy metals as they have the capacity to adsorb metal cations, among other dissolved substances.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pal|first=Arundhati|last2=Paul|first2=A. K.|date=2008-03-01|title=Microbial extracellular polymeric substances: central elements in heavy metal bioremediation|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12088-008-0006-5|journal=Indian Journal of Microbiology|language=en|volume=48|issue=1|pages=49|doi=10.1007/s12088-008-0006-5|issn=0046-8991|pmc=3450203}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be useful in the treatment of wastewater systems, as biofilms are able to bind to and remove metals such as copper, lead, nickel, and cadmium.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The binding affinity and metal specificity of EPS varies depending on polymer composition, as well as environmental factors such as concentration and pH.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

In a [[Geomicrobiology|geomicrobiological]] context, EPS has been observed to affect precipitation of minerals, particularly [[Carbonate|carbonates]].&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tourney|first=Janette|last2=Ngwenya|first2=Bryne T.|date=2014-10-29|title=The role of bacterial extracellular polymeric substances in geomicrobiology|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009254114003842|journal=Chemical Geology|volume=386|issue=Supplement C|pages=115–132|doi=10.1016/j.chemgeo.2014.08.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; EPS may also bind to and trap particles in biofilm suspensions, which can restrict dispersion and element cycling.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Sediment stability can be increased by EPS, as it influences cohesion, permeability, and erosion of the sediment.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; There is evidence that the adhesion and metal-binding ability of EPS affects mineral leaching rates in both environmental and industrial contexts.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; These interactions between EPS and the abiotic environment allow for EPS to largely impact [[Biogeochemical cycle|biogeochemical cycling]].

=== Novel industrial use ===
Due to the growing need to find a more efficient and environmentally friendly alternative to conventional waste removal methods, industries are paying more attention to the function of bacteria and their EPSs in [[bioremediation]].&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mota|first=Rita|last2=Rossi|first2=Federico|last3=Andrenelli|first3=Luisa|last4=Pereira|first4=Sara Bernardes|last5=De Philippis|first5=Roberto|date=September 2016|title=Released polysaccharides (RPS) from Cyanothece sp. CCY 0110 as biosorbent for heavy metals bioremediation: interactions between metals and RPS binding sites.|url=|journal=Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology|volume=100|issue=17|pages=7765–7775|via=|doi=10.1007/s00253-016-7602-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers found that adding EPSs from [[cyanobacteria]] to [[Wastewater|wastewaters]] removes heavy metals such as copper, cadmium and lead.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; &amp;nbsp;EPSs alone can physically interact with these heavy metals and take them in through [[biosorption]].&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; The efficiency of removal can be optimized by treating the EPSs with different acids or bases first before adding them to the wastewaters.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;

Contaminated soils contain high levels of [[Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon|Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs); EPSs from two bacteria, [[Zoogloea|''Zoogloea'' sp]]. and&amp;nbsp; ''[[Aspergillus niger]]'', are efficient at removing these toxic compounds.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jia|first=Chunyun|last2=Li|first2=Peijun|last3=Li|first3=Xiaojun|last4=Tai|first4=Peidong|last5=Liu|first5=Wan|last6=Gong|first6=Zongqiang|date=2011-08-01|title=Degradation of pyrene in soils by extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) extracted from liquid cultures|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359511311001644|journal=Process Biochemistry|volume=46|issue=8|pages=1627–1631|doi=10.1016/j.procbio.2011.05.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;EPSs contain enzymes such as [[oxidoreductase]] and [[hydrolase]], which are capable of&amp;nbsp; degrading PAHs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The amount of PAHs degradation depends on the concentration of EPSs added to the soil. This method proves to be low cost and highly efficient.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;

In recent years, EPSs from marine bacteria have been found to speed up the cleanup of oil spills.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gutierrez|first=Tony|last2=Berry|first2=David|last3=Yang|first3=Tingting|last4=Mishamandani|first4=Sara|last5=McKay|first5=Luke|last6=Teske|first6=Andreas|last7=Aitken|first7=Michael D.|date=2013-06-27|title=Role of Bacterial Exopolysaccharides (EPS) in the Fate of the Oil Released during the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0067717|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=8|issue=6|pages=e67717|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0067717|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]] in 2010, these EPS-producing bacteria were able to grow and multiply rapidly.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; &amp;nbsp;It was later found that their EPSs dissolved the oil and formed oil aggregates on the ocean surface, which sped up the cleaning process.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These oil aggregates also &amp;nbsp;provided a valuable source of nutrients for other marine microbial communities. This let scientists modify and optimize the use of EPSs to clean up oil spills.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Flocs appear as cloudy suspensions of cells floating in water, rather than attached to and growing on a surface like most biofilms. The floc typically is held together by a matrix of [[extracellular polymeric substance]] (EPS), which may contain variable amounts of [[polysaccharide]], [[protein]], and other biopolymers. The formation and the properties of flocs may affect the performance of industrial water treatment [[bioreactor|bioreactors]] such as [[activated sludge]] systems.

Floc formation may benefit the constituent microorganisms in a number of ways, including protection from pH stress&lt;ref name="pmid28087527"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Charles CJ, Rout SP, Patel KA, Akbar S, Laws AP, Jackson BR, Boxall SA, Humphreys PN | title = Floc Formation Reduces the pH Stress Experienced by Microorganisms Living in Alkaline Environments | journal = Applied and Environmental Microbiology | volume = 83 | issue = 6 | pages = | date = March 2017 | pmid = 28087527 | pmc = 5335526 | doi = 10.1128/AEM.02985-16 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;, resistance to predation, manipulation of microenvironments, and facilitation of mutualistic relationships in mixed microbial communities.

In general, the mechanisms by which flocculating microbial aggregates hold together are poorly understood. However, work on the activated sludge bacterium [[Zoogloea resiniphila]] has shown that [[exosortase|PEP-CTERM]] proteins must be expressed for flocs to form; in their absence, growth is planktonic, even though exopolysaccharide is produced&lt;ref name="pmid29473278"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gao N, Xia M, Dai J, Yu D, An W, Li S, Liu S, He P, Zhang L, Wu Z, Bi X, Chen S, Haft DH, Qiu D | title = Both widespread PEP-CTERM proteins and exopolysaccharides are required for floc formation of Zoogloea resiniphila and other activated sludge bacteria | journal = Environmental Microbiology | volume = 20 | issue = 5 | pages = 1677–1692 | date = May 2018 | pmid = 29473278 | doi = 10.1111/1462-2920.14080 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7679">A '''frozen zoo''' is a storage facility in which genetic materials taken from animals (e.g. [[DNA]], [[sperm]], [[Egg (biology)|eggs]], [[embryos]] and live tissue) are stored at very low temperatures  (−196&amp;nbsp;°C) in tanks of liquid nitrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiwum.wiz.pl/1997/97122600.asp|title=ZAMROŻONE ZOO|author=Magdalena Pecul| publisher=„Wiedza i Życie”|date=December 1997|accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Material preserved in this way can be stored indefinitely&lt;ref name=AudubonFZ /&gt; and used for [[artificial insemination]], [[in vitro fertilisation]], embryo transfer, and [[cloning]]. Some facilities also collect and cryopreserve plant material (usually seeds). 

[[File:San Diego Zoo Street Sign.jpg|thumbnail]]
The first frozen zoo was established at the [[San Diego Zoo]] by pathologist [[Kurt Benirschke]] in 1972.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/aug/29/frozen-zoo-san-diego-rhino|title=The Frozen Zoo aiming to bring endangered species back from the brink|last=Harris|first=Paul|date=August 28, 2010|work=The Guardian|accessdate=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/10/14/tech/main525521.shtml|author=Dan Collins|title=San Diego's Frozen Zoo|publisher=The [[Associated Press]] and [[CBS News]]|date=2002-10-14 |accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time there was no technology available to make use of the collection, but Benirschke believed such technology would be developed in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mashable.com/2017/02/28/san-diego-frozen-zoo/#mgh8BlFlaqqm|title=Extinct animals find new futures at the 'frozen zoo'|last1=Squarci|first1=Gaia|last2=Cornet|first2=Laurence|date=February 28, 2017|work=Mashable|accessdate=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The frozen zoo idea was later supported in Gregory Benford's 1992 paper proposing a Library of Life.&lt;ref&gt; Gregory Benford, Nov, 15, 1992. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC50491/ "Saving the Library of Life"] &lt;/ref&gt; Zoos such as the San Diego Zoo and research programs such as the Audubon Center for Research of Endangered Species&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auduboninstitute.org/research-center/ssc|title=Species Survival Center|publisher=Audubon Nature Institute|accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AudubonFZ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auduboninstitute.org/saving-species/frozen-zoo

Gathering material for a frozen zoo is rendered simple by the abundance of [[sperm]] in males. Sperm can be taken from an animal following death. The production of eggs, which in females is usually low, can be increased through [[hormone treatment]] to obtain 10–20 [[oocyte]]s, dependent on the species. Some frozen zoos prefer to fertilize eggs and freeze the resulting embryo, as embryos are more resilient under the cryopreservation process.&lt;ref name=Sharjah /&gt; Some centers also collect skin cell samples of endangered animals or extinct species. The [[Scripps Research Institute]] has successfully made skin cells into cultures of special cells called induced pluripotent stem cells ([[Induced pluripotent stem cell|IPS cells]]). It is theoretically possible to make sperm and egg cells from these IPS cells.&lt;ref name = "guardian"/&gt; 

==Existing frozen zoos==
The Frozen Zoo at the San Diego Zoo's Institute for Conservation Research currently stores a collection of  8,400 samples from over 800 species and subspecies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandiegozoo.org/conservation/science/at_the_zoo/the_frozen_zoo/|title=Chill Out: Frozen Zoo Aiding Conservation Projects|publisher=San Diego Zoo|accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frozen Zoo at San Diego Zoo Conservation Research has acted as a forbearer to similar projects at other zoos in the United States and Europe including the [[Frozen Ark]] Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zsl.org/zsl-london-zoo/whats-on/scientific-meeting-frozen-ark,234,EV.html|title=Scientific Meeting - The Frozen Ark Project|publisher=ZSL London Zoo|accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.frozenark.org/|title=Welcome to the Frozen Ark|publisher=The Frozen Ark Project|accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are still less than a dozen frozen zoos worldwide.&lt;ref name=AudubonFZ /&gt;

At the United Arab Emirates Breeding Centre for Endangered Arabian Wildlife (BCEAW), [[Sharjah (city)|Sharjah]], the embryos stored include the extremely endangered [[Gordon’s wildcat]] (''Felis silvestris gordoni'') and the [[Arabian leopard]] (''Panthera pardus nimr'') (of which there are only 50 in the wild).&lt;ref name=Sharjah&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arabianwildlife.uaeinteract.com/current/fr_zoo.html|title=The Frozen Zoo: Breeding Centre for Endangered Arabian Wildlife, Sharjah, UAE|author=F.J. de Haas van Dorsser MA VetMB MRCVS|publisher=Arabian Wildlife|accessdate=2010-04-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100521054237/http://arabianwildlife.uaeinteract.com/current/fr_zoo.html|archivedate=2010-05-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Audubon Center for Research of Endangered Species, affiliated with the [[University of New Orleans]], is maintaining a frozen zoo. In 2000 the Center implanted a frozen-thawed embryo from the highly endangered African wildcat into the uterus of a domestic house cat, resulting in a healthy male wildcat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2001/03/010309080531.htm|title=The Frozen Zoo: The University Of New Orleans And The New World Of Saving Endangered Species|date=March 12, 2001|work=Science Daily|accessdate=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The University of Georgia's Regenerative Bioscience Center is building a frozen zoo. RBC Director Steven Stice and animal and dairy science assistant professor Franklin West created the facility with the thought of saving endangered cat species. The scientists have already extracted cells from a Sumatran tiger, which could be used for artificial insemination. Artificial insemination provides a remedy for animals who, due to anatomical or physiological reasons, are unable to reproduce in the natural way. Reproduction of stored genetic material also allows for the fostering of genetic improvements, and the prevention of inbreeding. Modern technology allows for genetic manipulation in animals without keeping them in captivity. However, the success of their restoration into the wild would require the application of new science and a sufficient amount of previously collected material.&lt;ref name=Sharjah /&gt;

'''Fusicoccins''' are [[organic compound]]s produced by a [[fungus]]. It has detrimental effect on [[plant]]s and causes their [[death]].

Fusicoccins are diterpenoid glycosides produced by the fungus ''[[Fusicoccum amygdali]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ballio, A. |author2=Chain, E. B. |author3=De Leo, P. |author4=Erlanger, B. F. |author5=Mauri, M. |author6=Tonolo, A. | title = Fusicoccin: a new wilting toxin produced by Fusicoccum amygdali | journal = Nature | year = 1964 | volume = 203 | issue = 4942 | pages = 297 | doi = 10.1038/203297a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a [[parasite]] of mainly [[almond]] and [[peach]] [[tree]]s. It stimulates a quick acidification of the plant [[cell wall]]; this causes the [[stoma]]ta to irreversibly open, which brings about the death of the plant.

Fusicoccins contains three fused [[carbon]] rings and another ring which contains an [[oxygen]] [[atom]] and five carbons.

Fusicoccin was and is extensively used in research regarding the [[plant hormone]] [[auxin]] and its mechanisms.

==Biosynthesis==
Fusicoccin is a member of a diterpenoid class which shares a 5-8-5 ring structure and is called fusicoccane.&lt;ref name="pmid22465041"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=de Boer AH, de Vries-van Leeuwen IJ |title=Fusicoccanes: diterpenes with surprising biological functions |journal=Trends in Plant Science |volume=17 |issue=6 |pages=360–368 |year=2012 |pmid=22465041 |doi=10.1016/j.tplants.2012.02.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fungi, fusicoccin is biosynthesized via ''Phomopsis amygdali'' fusicoccadiene synthase (PaFS) from universal C5 [[isoprene]] units [[dimethylallyl diphosphate]] (DMAPP) and [[isopentenyl diphosphate]] (IPP). PaFS has two domains, a C-terminal prenyltransferase domain which converts isoprene units into [[geranylgeranyl diphosphate]] (GGDP) and an N-terminal terpene cyclase domain where GGDP gets cyclized and turns into fusicocca-2,10(14)-diene. It is also reported in this study that a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase-like gene, a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase-like gene, a short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase-like gene, and an α-mannosidase-like gene at the 3’ location downstream of PaFS which are responsible for converting fusicocca-2,10(14)-diene into fusicoccin.&lt;ref name="pmid17360612"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Toyomasu T, Tsukahara M, Kaneko A, Niida R, Mitsuhashi W, Dairi T, Kato N, Sassa T |title=Fusicoccins are biosynthesized by an unusual chimera diterpene synthase in fungi |journal=PNAS |volume=104 |issue=9 |pages=3084–3088 |year=2007 |pmid=17360612 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0608426104 |pmc=1805559}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two enzymes, one dioxygenase and PAPT, are in charge of catalyzing a hydroxylation at the 3-position of fusicocca-2,10(14)-diene-8β,16-diol and prenylation of the hydroxyl group of [[glucose]] in fusicoccin P, respectively.&lt;ref name="pmid21299202"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ono Y, Minami A, Noike M, Higuchi Y, Toyoasu T, Sassa T, Kato N, Dairi T |title=Dioxygenases, keyenzymes to determine the aglycon structures of fusicoccin and brassicicene, diterpene compounds produced by fungi |journal=J.

A '''genetically modified mouse''' (''Mus musculus'') is a [[house mouse|mouse]] that has had its [[genome]] altered through the use of [[genetic engineering]] techniques. Genetically modified mice are commonly used for research or as animal models of human diseases, and are also used for research on genes.

==History==

==Methods==
There are two basic technical approaches to produce genetically modified mice. The first involves [[Microinjection#Pronuclear injection|pronuclear injection]] into a single cell of the mouse embryo, where it will randomly integrate into the mouse genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1073/pnas.77.12.7380|author=Gordon, J.W., Scangos, G.A, Plotkin, D.J., Barbosa, J.A. and Ruddle F.H.|year=1980|journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA|title=Genetic transformation of mouse embryos by microinjection of purified DNA|volume=77|issue=12|pages=7380–7384|pmid=6261253|pmc=350507|bibcode = 1980PNAS...77.7380G }}&lt;/ref&gt; This method creates a [[transgenic]] mouse and is used to insert new genetic information into the mouse genome or to over-express [[endogenous]] genes. The second approach, pioneered by [[Oliver Smithies]] and [[Mario Capecchi]], involves modifying [[embryonic stem cells]] with a [[DNA construct]] containing DNA sequences [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] to the target gene. Embryonic stem cells that [[Genetic recombination|recombine]] with the genomic DNA are selected for and they are then injected into the mice [[blastocysts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Thomas KR, Capecchi MR |year=1987|title=Site-directed mutagenesis by gene targeting in mouse embryo-derived stem cells|journal=Cell|pmid=2822260|volume=51|issue=3|pages=503–12|doi=10.1016/0092-8674(87)90646-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method is used to manipulate a single gene, in most cases [[gene knockout|"knocking out"]] the target gene, although more subtle genetic manipulation can occur (e.g. only changing single [[nucleotides]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4011">'''Hate Studies''' is an international interdisciplinary field that brings together scholars, academic researchers, practitioner-experts, human rights leaders, policymakers, NGO/INGO leaders, and many others.  Hate Studies responds to a call to gather the wisdom from academic fields throughout the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, education, and other areas, and to bring it into conversation and practical application in law and policy, civil society organizations, and elsewhere.

As a working definition, Hate Studies inquires into the human capacity to "define, and then demonize or dehumanize an 'other,' and the processes that inform and give expression to, or can curtail, control, or combat, that capacity." [[Kenneth S. Stern|(Stern, 2004)]].  Hate Studies seeks to understand and appropriately address the multifaceted phenomena and factors of hatred, which occur at individual, collective, institutional, and societal levels, by cross-pollinating and integrating all disciplines that have something valuable to say about hatred and pulling them together into a larger academic enterprise.

The vision and momentum for Hate Studies grew out of efforts initiated and hosted by the [[Gonzaga University]] [http://gonzaga.edu/hatestudies Institute for Hate Studies], which was founded in 1997.  Gonzaga University, a Jesuit Catholic institution located in Spokane, Washington (USA), hosted the "First International Conference to Establish the Field of Hate Studies" in March 2004.

The Gonzaga Institute for Hate Studies was the world's first academic unit devoted to this emerging field, and today the Gonzaga Institute organizes the [http://www.gonzaga.edu/Academics/hate-studies/conferences-events/poj-conference.asp International Conference on Hate Studies] and publishes the peer-review scholarly [http://journals.gonzaga.edu/index.php/johs Journal of Hate Studies]. It has hosted three [http://www.gonzaga.edu/Academics/hate-studies/conferences-events/past-events.asp "International Conferences on Hate Studies" (2004, 2011, 2013)], and has also published 10 annual volumes of the [http://journals.gonzaga.edu/index.php/johs Journal of Hate Studies]; Volumes 11 and 12 are due for publication in 2014-15.  In addition, the Gonzaga Institute hosts speaker series, visiting fellows, and special academic events in cities worldwide; supports research and courses on hate and directly related social problems; and serves as a nexus hub for this growing field.

As of 2013, there is an [http://www.internationalhatestudies.com/ "International Network for Hate Studies,"] which is based in the European Union and boasts significant participation within the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Commonwealth Countries, and other nations and regions.  The Network members primarily focus on hate crime and related issues of hate and victimization in multicultural societies.  The Network hosted its [http://www.sussex.ac.uk/law/newsandevents/hate inaugural conference] in May 2014, at the [http://www.sussex.ac.uk/law/newsandevents/hate/inhs University of Sussex School of Law].

The '''Heptateuch''' (seven containers) is a name sometimes given to the first seven books of the [[Hebrew Bible]]. The seven books are [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], [[Leviticus]], [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]], [[Deuteronomy]], [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] and [[Book of Judges|Judges]]. The first four of these are sometimes called the Tetrateuch,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZWY8CwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;vq=Tetrateuch&amp;dq=Old%20Testament%20Interpretation%20Mays%20Peterson%20Richards&amp;pg=PA36#v=snippet&amp;q=Tetrateuch&amp;f=false |title=Old Testament Interpretation: Past, Present And Future |chapter=The Formation of the Pentateuch |first=David L. |last=Petersen |editor1-first=James Luther |editor1-last=Mays |editor2-first=David |editor2-last=Petersen |editor3-first=Kent H. |editor3-last=Richards |page=36 |year=1995 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first five are commonly known as the [[Torah]] or the [[Pentateuch]], the first six as the [[Hexateuch]]. With the addition of the [[Book of Ruth]], it becomes the [[Octateuch]]. The "Enneateuch" is the Heptateuch plus the [[Books of Samuel]] and the [[Books of Kings]] (each pair of books counted as one, and not including the Book of Ruth).

[[Augustine of Hippo]] produced a piece called ''Questions on the Heptateuch''. [[Ælfric of Eynsham]] produced an [[Old English language|Old English]] version of the Heptateuch.

'''Hugo Zemp''' (born 14 May 1937, [[Basle]], [[Switzerland]]) is a Swiss-French [[ethnomusicology|ethnomusicologist]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discogs.com/artist/Hugo+Zemp Hugo Zemp Biography - Discogs]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ethnocenter"&gt;[http://ethnocenter.org/ZempTalk The Center for Ethnomusicology at Columbia University: A Conversation With Hugo Zemp]&lt;/ref&gt; A prolific recorder of ethnic music and a writer on the subject, he has also shot a number of films about music of various regions, including 1988 film ''Voix de tête, voix de poitrine'' and 2002 film ''An African Brass Band'' filmed by him in [[Ivory Coast]] in 2002.&lt;ref name="ethnocenter"/&gt; His wide musical expertise includes music notably in Africa, Oceania and Switzerland. He also had particular interest in yodeling and lullabies. His recordings  of lullabies from Solomon Islands were later released by [[UNESCO]] as part of their ''[[Musical Sources]]'' collection. One famous lullaby he recorded, a traditional Baegu lullaby from the Solomon Islands called "Rorogwela" was sung by Afunakwa, a Northern Malaita old woman. The recording was later used, apparently without permission, in [[Deep Forest]]'s song "[[Sweet Lullaby]]".

Prof. Zemp studied [[musicology]] and [[anthropology]] at the [[University of Basle]] graduating in 1961. He also finished a diploma in percussion at the [[City of Basel Music Academy]] (Basel's Conservatory school) in 1960. He attended [[École pratique des hautes études]] for his doctorate.

He joined [[French National Centre for Scientific Research]] ([[CNRS]]) becoming a director of research. He taught [[ethnomusicology]] at the [[Paris West University Nanterre La Défense|University of Paris X-Nanterre]]. In 1982, he became editor the recording series  (''Collection du Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique et du Musée de l'Homme''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discogs.com/label/Collection+du+Centre+National+de+la+Recherche+Scientifique+et+du+Mus%C3%A9e+de+l%27Homme Discogs.com: ''Collection du Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique et du Musée de l'Homme'']&lt;/ref&gt; on the ''Le Chant du Monde'' record label. In tens of productions by Zemp, it included music from Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Chad, Ivory Coast, Romania, Solomon Islands and various countries in Central Africa. There were also a number of recordings of [[yodeling]] from Switzerland.

The '''IP Code''', '''International Protection Marking''', IEC  standard 60529, sometimes interpreted as '''Ingress Protection Marking''', classifies and rates the degree of protection provided against intrusion  (body parts such as hands and fingers), [[dust]], accidental contact, and water by mechanical casings and [[electrical enclosures]]. It is published by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC). The equivalent European standard is EN 60529.

The standard aims to provide users more detailed information than vague marketing terms such as ''waterproof''. For example, a cellular phone rated at IP68 is "dust resistant" and can be "immersed in 1.5 meters of freshwater for up to 30 minutes". Similarly, an electrical socket rated IP22 is protected against insertion of fingers and will not be damaged or become unsafe during a specified test in which it is exposed to vertically or nearly vertically dripping water. IP22 or IP2X are typical minimum requirements for the design of electrical accessories for indoor use.

The digits indicate conformity with the conditions summarized in the tables below. The digit ''0'' is used where no protection is provided. The digit is replaced with the letter ''X'' when insufficient data has been gathered to assign a protection level.

There are no hyphens in a genuine IP code. IPX-8 (for example) is thus an invalid IP code.&lt;ref&gt;IEC 60529, Edition 2.2, 2013, page 19&lt;/ref&gt;

This page contains a combination of IEC 60529 (also EN 60529) and other standards, such as ISO 20653. The original documents are available for purchase, and have important and specific requirements that cannot be fully reprinted due to copyright restrictions. This often includes drawings specifying the required test equipment, such as the shape of water nozzles used for water jet testing. Additional standards are often referenced that may contain important information. One must refer to the latest revision of the required standard when conducting tests for agency certification.

==Code breakdown==
This table shows what each digit or part of the IP code represents.

===Second digit: Liquid ingress protection===&lt;!--where does this info come from? it doesn't seem to be using the standard terminology for the ratings.--&gt;
The second digit indicates the level of protection that the enclosure provides against harmful ingress of water.&lt;ref name="NE Laser"&gt;{{citation|title=Ingress Protection: The System of Tests and Meaning of Codes|url=http://www.ce-mag.com/archive/06/ARG/bisenius.htm|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DGYoRMwp?url=http://www.ce-mag.com/archive/06/ARG/bisenius.htm|deadurl=yes|archivedate=2012-12-29|df=}}.&lt;!-- http://www.webcitation.org/6DGYoRMwp?url=http://www.ce-mag.com/archive/06/ARG/bisenius.htm --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The ratings for water ingress are not cumulative beyond IPX6. A device which is compliant with IPX7, covering immersion in water, need not be compliant with IPX5 or IPX6, covering exposure to water jets. A device which meets both tests is indicated by listing both tests separated by a slash, e.g. IPX5/IPX7.

The letter K is specified in DIN 40050-9, and not in IEC 60529.

== IP69K ==
IP codes with the letter "K" are from ISO 20653:2013 Road Vehicles-Degrees of protection (IP code), which states that it is in accordance with IEC 60529 except for the "K" tests, which describe special requirements for road vehicles.

The test specifies a spray nozzle that is fed with 80&amp;nbsp;°C water at 8–10&amp;nbsp;[[MPa]] (80–100 bar) and a flow rate of 14–16&amp;nbsp;L/min. The nozzle is held 10–15&amp;nbsp;cm from the tested device at angles of 0°, 30°, 60° and 90° for 30&amp;nbsp;seconds each. The test device sits on a turntable that completes a rotation once every 12&amp;nbsp;seconds (5&amp;nbsp;[[Revolutions per minute|rpm]]). The IPx9 specification in IEC 60529 has details for testing larger specimens that will not fit on a turntable test fixture (see table above).

The IP69K test specification was initially developed for road vehicles, especially those that need regular intensive cleaning (dump trucks, cement mixers, etc.), but it also finds use in other areas (for example, the food industry and car wash centers).

German standard [[Deutsches Institut für Normung|DIN]] 40050-9 extended the older IEC 60529 rating system with an '''IP69K''' rating for high-pressure, high-temperature wash-down applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = [[DIN]] 40050-9: ''Straßenfahrzeuge; IP-Schutzarten; Schutz gegen Fremdkörper, Wasser und Berühren; Elektrische Ausrüstung'' [Road vehicles; degrees of protection (IP-code); protection against foreign objects, water and impact; electrical equipment] | date = May 1993}}. An English translation of the German original is available from DIN.&lt;/ref&gt; DIN 40050-9 has been replaced by ISO 20653:2013 Road Vehicles-Degrees of protection (IP code).&lt;ref&gt;ISO 20653:2013 Road Vehicles-Degrees of protection (IP code) Protection of electrical equipment against foreign objects, water and access&lt;/ref&gt; Such enclosures must not only be dust-tight (IP6X), but it must also be able to withstand high-pressure and steam cleaning. By 2013 IEC 60529 added level 9 water ingress testing, with IPx9 being essentially the same spray test as IP69K, also adding a drawing of a fixture to verify the water pressure.

== North America (NEMA rating) ==&lt;!--The following section is a target of internal redirects.--&gt;
{{main|NEMA enclosure types}}
In the USA, the [[National Electrical Manufacturers Association]] defines [[NEMA enclosure types]] in NEMA standard number 250. The following table outlines which IEC 60529 IP code each respective NEMA rating meets. Ratings between the two standards are not directly equivalent: NEMA ratings also require additional product features and tests (such as functionality under icing conditions,  enclosures for [[Electrical equipment in hazardous areas|hazardous areas]], knock-outs for cable connections and others) not addressed by IP ratings.

== Ingress Protection for consumer electronics ==
The inclusion of an Ingress Protection rating has become increasingly common for use in the [[consumer electronics]] market with devices such as [[mobile phone]]s, [[tablet computer]]s and [[camera]]s now being sold as water resistant, waterproof and dustproof.

Some manufacturers have produced IP rated [[smartphone]]s, aimed at consumers who are concerned about their handsets getting submerged in liquids or getting covered in dust.

With the availability of portable devices, and the desire to get outside with active lifestyles, portable speakers have become popular with the rugged consumer market for those who enjoy [[outdoor recreation]], [[extreme sport]]s as well.

[[File:UNESCO-ICH-blue.svg|150px|thumb|Logo of Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage]]
An '''intangible cultural heritage''' ('''ICH''') is a practice, representation, expression, knowledge, or skill, as well as the instruments, objects, artifacts, and cultural spaces that are considered by [[UNESCO]] to be part of a place's cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Marie Sullivan, Cultural Heritage &amp; New Media: A Future for the Past, 15 J. MARSHALL REV. INTELL. PROP. L. 604 (2016) https://repository.jmls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1392&amp;context=ripl&lt;/ref&gt; 
Intangible cultural heritage is considered by Member States of [[UNESCO]] in relation to the tangible [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage]] focusing on intangible aspects of culture. In 2001, [[UNESCO]] made a survey&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=EN&amp;meeting_id=00057#meet_00057
|title=Meeting of 2001
|publisher=UNESCO
|accessdate=20 June 2007 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; among States and NGOs to try to agree on a definition, and the [[Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=EN&amp;pg=home
|title=Official website
|publisher=UNESCO
|accessdate=20 June 2007 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; was drafted in 2003 for its protection and promotion.

==Definition==

The Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/en/convention|title = UNESCO|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; defines 
the intangible cultural heritage as the practices, representations, expressions, as well as the knowledge and skills (including instruments, objects, artifacts, cultural spaces), that communities, groups and, in some cases, individuals recognise as part of their cultural heritage. It is sometimes called living cultural heritage, and is manifested inter alia in the following domains:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/services/documentation/archives/multimedia/?id_page=13|title=Definition of Intangible Heritage|first=|last=LOMITKO|date=1 October 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Oral traditions and expressions, including language as a vehicle of the intangible cultural heritage; 
* Performing arts; 
* Social practices, rituals and festive events; 
* Knowledge and practices concerning nature and the universe; 
* Traditional craftsmanship

[[File:No-Maske Zo-onna Museum Rietberg RJP 4024.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Noh]] mask; Japan was the first country to [[Cultural Properties of Japan#Present 1950 Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties|introduce legislation]] to protect and promote its [[Intangible Cultural Properties of Japan|intangible heritage]]&lt;ref name="Yang"/&gt;]]

[[Cultural heritage]] in general consists of the products and processes of a [[culture]] that are preserved and passed on through the generations. Some of that heritage takes the form of [[cultural property]], formed by tangible artefacts such as buildings or works of art. Many parts of culture, however are intangible, including [[song]], [[music]], [[dance]], [[drama]], [[skill]]s, cuisine, crafts and festivals. They are forms of culture that can be recorded but cannot be touched or stored in physical form, like in a museum, but only experienced through a vehicle giving expression to it. These cultural vehicles are called "Human Treasures" by the [[UN]].

According to the 2003 Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage, the intangible cultural heritage (ICH) – or living heritage – is the mainspring of humanity's [[cultural diversity]] and its maintenance a guarantee for continuing creativity.  It is defined as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Intangible Cultural Heritage means the practices, representations, expressions, knowledge, skills – as well as the instruments, objects, artifacts and cultural spaces associated therewith – that communities, groups and, in some cases, individuals recognize as part of their cultural heritage. This intangible cultural heritage, transmitted from generation to generation, is constantly recreated by communities and groups in response to their environment, their interaction with nature and their history, and provides them with a sense of identity and continuity, thus promoting respect for cultural diversity and human creativity. For the purposes of this Convention, consideration will be given solely to such intangible cultural heritage as is compatible with existing international human rights instruments, as well as with the requirements of mutual respect among communities, groups and individuals, and of sustainable development.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Oral history===
Intangible cultural heritage is slightly different from the discipline of [[oral history]], the recording, preservation and interpretation of historical information (specifically, [[oral tradition]]), based on the personal experiences and opinions of the speaker.  ICH attempts to preserve cultural heritage 'with' the people or community by protecting the processes that allow traditions and shared knowledge to be passed on while oral history seeks to collect and preserve historical information obtained from individuals and groups.

===Food heritage===
With sustainable development gaining momentum as a priority of UNESCO heritage policies, an increasing number of food-related nominations are being submitted for inscription on the lists of the Convention for the safeguarding of the intangible cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://frictions.hypotheses.org/184|title=At the UNESCO feast: introduction|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mediterranean diet,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|language=French|author=SILVA, A. J. M.|title=Le régime UNESCO (Discours et pratiques alimentaires en Méditerranée vol. III)|place=Charleston|editor=Create Space|year=2016|isbn=1532997116|url=https://www.academia.edu/27222415/Le_r%C3%A9gime_UNESCO_Discours_et_pratiques_alimentaires_en_M%C3%A9diterran%C3%A9e_vol._III_}}&lt;/ref&gt; the traditional Mexican cuisine and the Japanese dietary culture of washoku are just some examples of this booming phenomenon.

===Dance heritage===
The UNESCO lists of intangible cultural heritage also include a variety of dance genres, often associated with singing, music and celebrations, from all over the world. The lists include: celebratory and ritual dances, such as ‘Ma'di bowl lyre music and dance’ from Uganda and ‘Kalbelia folk songs and dances of Rajasthan’ from India and social dances, such as rumba from Cuba. Also, some dances are localised and practised mainly in their country of origin, such as Sankirtana, a performing art that includes drumming and singing, from India. 

Other dance forms&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worlddanceheritage.org/international-heritage/ Dance as a form of intangible heritage]&lt;/ref&gt;, however, even if they are officially recognised as heritage from their country of origin, are practised and enjoyed all over the world. For example, flamenco from Spain and tango, from Argentina and Uruguay, have a very international dimension. Dance is a very complex phenomenon, which involves culture, traditions, the use of human bodies, artefacts (such as costumes and props), as well as a specific use of music, space and sometimes light. As a result, a lot of tangible and intangible elements&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euppublishing.com/doi/abs/10.3366/drs.2016.0147 Lo Iacono, Valeria and Brown, David - ''Beyond Binarism: Exploring a Model of Living Cultural Heritage for Dance''. Dance Research Journal, Vol. 34, April 2016]
&lt;/ref&gt; are combined within dance, making it a challenging but extremely interesting type of heritage to safeguard.

===Digital heritage===
[[Digital heritage]] is a representation of heritage in the digital realm.

===Digital intangible heritage===

[[Digital intangible heritage]] is a sub-category of Intangible Cultural Heritage.&lt;ref name="nova"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://multi-science.atypon.com/doi/abs/10.1260/2047-4970.4.1.71|title=Transmitting Al Ardha: Traditional Arab Sword Dance|first=Muqeem|last=Khan|date=1 March 2015|publisher=|journal=International Journal of Heritage in the Digital Era|volume=4|issue=1|pages=71–86|via=multi-science.atypon.com (Atypon)|doi=10.1260/2047-4970.4.1.71}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oral continuity==
[[Image:A traditional male folk group from Skrapar.JPG|thumb|Albanian polyphonic folk group wearing [[qeleshe]] and [[fustanella]] in [[Skrapar]]]]
Intangible cultural heritage is passed orally within a community, and while there may be individuals who are known tradition bearers, ICH is often broader than one individual's own skills or knowledge.  A 2006 report by the government of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] said, regarding oral culture in their area, "The processes involved in the continuation of this traditional knowledge constitute one of the most interesting aspects of our living heritage.

Prior to the UNESCO Convention, efforts had already been made by a number of states to safeguard their intangible heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/tk/en/databases/creative_heritage/docs/subtle_power.pdf |title=The Subtle Power of Intangible Heritage: Legal and Financial Instruments for Safeguarding Intangible Heritage |author=Deacon, Harriet (''et al.'') |publisher=[[Human Sciences Research Council (South Africa)|Human Sciences Research Council]] |year=2004 |isbn=0796920745 |page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan, with its [[Cultural Properties of Japan#Present 1950 Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties|1950 Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties]], was the first to introduce legislation to preserve and promote intangible as well as tangible culture: [[Intangible Cultural Properties of Japan|Important Intangible Cultural Properties]] are [[Cultural Properties of Japan|designated]] and "holders" recognized of these craft and performance traditions, known informally as [[Living National Treasures of Japan|Living National Treasures]].&lt;ref name="Yang"&gt;{{cite book |title=Cultural Protection Policy in Korea: Intangible Cultural Properties and Living National Treasures |author=Yang Jongsung |publisher=Jimoondang International |year=2003 |isbn=1931897050 |pages=33ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kurin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kurin|first=Richard|title=Safeguarding Intangible Cultural Heritage in the 2003 UNESCO Convention: a critical appraisal|journal=Museum International|date=1 May 2004|volume=56|issue=1-2|pages=66–77|doi=10.1111/j.1350-0775.2004.00459.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1350-0775.2004.00459.x/pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other countries, including South Korea ([[Important Intangible Cultural Properties of Korea]]), the Philippines, the United States, Thailand, France, Romania, the Czech Republic, and Poland, have since created similar programs.&lt;ref name=Kurin/&gt;

In 2003 UNESCO adopted the Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage.  This went into effect on 20 April 2006.  The Convention recommends that countries and scholars develop inventories of ICH in their territory, as well as work with the groups who maintain these ICH to ensure their continued existences; it also provides for funds to be voluntarily collected among UNESCO members and then disbursed to support the maintenance of recognized ICH.&lt;ref name=Kurin/&gt; UNESCO has also created other intangible culture programs, such as a list called Proclamation of [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]].  This list began in 2001 with 19 items and a further 28 were listed in 2003 and another 43 in 2005. In part, the original list was seen as a way to correct the imbalance in the World Heritage List, since it excluded many Southern Hemisphere cultures which did not produce monuments or other physical cultural manifestations.&lt;ref name = Kurin/&gt; It was superseded in 2008 by the [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists]].

Recently there has been much debate over protecting intangible cultural heritage through intellectual property rights, as well as the desirability to do so through this legal framework and the risks of [[commodification]] derived from this possibility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ssrn.com/abstract=2705698 Farah, Paolo Davide and Tremolada, Riccardo ''Conflict between Intellectual Property Rights and Human Rights: A Case Study on Intangible Cultural Heritage'' (December 19, 2015). Oregon Law Review, Vol. 94, No. 1, 2015]
&lt;/ref&gt; The issue still remains open in legal scholarship.

{{Judaism}}
'''Jewish studies''' (or '''Judaic studies''') is an [[List of academic disciplines|academic discipline]] centered on the study of [[Jew]]s and [[Judaism]]. Jewish studies is [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] and combines aspects of [[history]] (especially [[Jewish history]]), [[Middle Eastern studies]], [[Asian studies]], [[Oriental studies]], [[religious studies]], [[archeology]], [[sociology]], [[language]]s ([[Jewish languages]]), [[political science]], [[area studies]], [[women's studies]], and [[ethnic studies]]. Jewish studies as a distinct field is mainly present at colleges and universities in [[North America]].

Related fields include [[Holocaust research]] and [[Israel Studies]], and in Israel, [[Jewish thought]].

==History==
[[File:Kurtze Beschreibung einer wohleingerichteten Synagog.jpg|thumb|300px|In the 18th century, as interest in the "curiosities" of the Jewish religion rose, some non-Jews had models of synagogues erected, furnished with a full array of Jewish books and ceremonial objects, and accessible to a broad public, constituting the world's first "Jewish museums." This title page is from a book by Moritz Wilhelm Christiani, which describes such a replica, owned by Georg Serpilius, a Christian Hebraist.]]
The Jewish tradition generally places a high value on learning and study, especially of [[religious text]]s. [[Torah study]] (study of the [[Torah]] and more broadly of the entire [[Hebrew Bible]] as well as [[Rabbinic literature]] such as the [[Talmud]] and [[Midrash]]) is considered a [[Mitzvah|religious obligation]].

Since the [[Renaissance]] and the growth of [[higher education]], many people, including people not of the Jewish faith, have chosen to study Jews and Judaism as a means of understanding the Jewish religion, heritage, and Jewish history.

Religious instruction specifically for Jews, especially for those who wish to join the [[rabbi]]nate, is taught at Jewish [[Seminary|seminaries]] (and in [[Orthodox Judaism]], [[yeshiva]]s). Among the most prominent are the [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America|Jewish Theological Seminary]] and the [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] [[Hebrew Union College]]. For the majority of Jewish students attending regular academic colleges and universities there is a growing choice of Jewish studies courses and even degrees available at many institutions.

The subject of [[antisemitism]] and [[the Holocaust]], as well as the establishment of the modern [[Israel|State of Israel]] and the revival of the [[Hebrew language]] have all stimulated unusual interest in greater in-depth academic study, research, reading and lecturing about these core areas of knowledge related to current events. In the United States, the unique position that [[American Jews|Jewish Americans]] have held within the nation's complex social structure has created substantial scholarship, especially with regards to topics such as interfaith marriage, political activism, and influence on popular culture.

In a 1966 article published in the ''[[American Jewish Year Book]]'', the Hebrew literature scholar [[Arnold Band|Arnold J. Band]] was among the first to call attention to the "spread of Jewish studies as an accepted academic discipline in the American liberal arts colleges and universities since the Second World War".&lt;ref name="Band"&gt;Band, Arnold (1966). "[http://www.ajcarchives.org/AJC_DATA/Files/1966_3_SpecialArticles.pdf Jewish Studies in American Liberal-Arts Colleges and Universities]," ''American Jewish Year Book'' 67 (1966), 1–30; here: p. 3. Retrieved 2016-07-01 from the website of the American Jewish Committee Archives. Also reprinted, with a postscript by Band, in: Band, ''Studies in Modern Jewish Literature''. Philadelphia: The Jewish Publication Society, 2003. p. 390–408. {{ISBN|9780827609723}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Loveland"&gt;Loveland, Kristen (2008). "The Association for Jewish Studies: A Brief History". Association for Jewish Studies 40th Annual Conference, December 21–23, 2008. 16&amp;nbsp;p.; here: p.&amp;nbsp;1. "The first to address the postwar rise of Jewish studies, Band's article quickly set off a reaction amongst the new generation of Jewish studies professors." Available as a [http://www.ajsnet.org/ajs.pdf PDF file] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160726190104/http://www.ajsnet.org/ajs.pdf |date=2016-07-26 }} on the website of the Association for Jewish Studies, "[http://www.ajsnet.org/mission.htm About Us]" page. Retrieved 2016-07-01.&lt;/ref&gt; In his article Band offered a definition of Jewish (Judaic) studies as "the discipline which deals with the historical experiences, in the intellectual, religious, and social spheres, of the Jewish people in all centuries and countries".&lt;ref&gt;Band (1966), p. 5. In the 2002 reprint, ''Studies in Modern Jewish Literature'', p. 391.&lt;/ref&gt;

The political situation in the [[Middle East]], especially the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] and the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], has raised the profile of Jews, Judaism, and [[Zionism]] on campuses, spurring many on to study this subject for non-degree as well as for credits in obtaining a [[Bachelor of Arts]] or [[Master of Arts]] [[Academic degree|degree]]. A growing number of mature students are even obtaining [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.s]] in Jewish studies judging by the quantity of courses and programs available. Many hope to obtain employment in the field of Jewish education or in Jewish communal service agencies.

Some Christians search for an understanding of the Jewish background for [[Jesus Christ]] and [[Christianity]] and for the source of [[monotheism]] that sprang from Judaism. There are those who are seeking an understanding of the complex and volatile relationship between [[Islam]] and Judaism. Others are searching for [[spirituality]] and [[philosophy]] and therefore seek classes in [[Kabbalah]] (Jewish mysticism) and [[Jewish philosophy]]. There are also those who have a genuine concern and attachment to modern [[Israel]] as [[Christian Zionists]] and therefore seek to learn more about the subjects related to their beliefs.

Jewish studies have been offered at universities around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Verbit, Mervin F. (ed.) (1985). ''World Register of University Studies in Jewish Civilization: Inventory of Holdings'' (Vol. 1). Markus Wiener Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; The following are only a few significant examples of places where Jewish studies are offered and flourish in an academic setting:

==Colleges that offer Jewish Studies==
Several colleges in the United States and Israel offer Jewish Studies or Judaic Studies as a major.

===Israel===

In 1967 the department was renamed the Department of Hebrew and Jewish Studies and extended to include, in addition to the established courses in Hebrew language and literature, a much wider range of courses with an emphasis on Jewish history. The department acts as host to both the Jewish Historical Society of England (JHSE)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jhse.org/ |title=jhse.org |publisher=jhse.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Institute of Jewish Studies (IJS),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/hebrew-jewish/ijs/index.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416002941/http://www.ucl.ac.uk/hebrew-jewish/ijs/index.htm |date=April 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which organises annual public lecture series and international conferences on all aspects of Jewish civilisation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/hebrew-jewish/home/index.php ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503054431/http://www.ucl.ac.uk/hebrew-jewish/home/index.php |date=May 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a list of [[marine ecoregion]]s, as defined by the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] and [[The Nature Conservancy]]

The WWF/Nature Conservancy scheme groups the individual ecoregions into 12 [[marine realm]]s, which represent the broad latitudinal divisions of polar, temperate, and tropical seas, with subdivisions based on ocean basins. The marine realms are subdivided into 62 [[marine province]]s, which include one or more of the 232 marine ecoregions.

The WWF/Nature Conservancy scheme currently encompasses only coastal and [[continental shelf]] areas; ecoregions of the deep oceans have not yet been delineated.

'''Llanymynech Heritage Area''' is an historic former [[lime kiln]], [[quarry]] and industrial site near the village of [[Llanymynech]], Shropshire in the [[Welsh Marches]]. The site is adjacent to the [[A483 road]] and close to the [[Montgomery Canal]]. It is about {{convert|6|mi|0}} south of [[Oswestry]] on the English side of the border, and about {{convert|9|mi|0}} north of the [[Powys]] town of [[Welshpool]].

== History and significance ==

This is a nationally significant industrial heritage area, containing one of only three remaining [[Hoffmann kiln]]s in the country.&lt;ref name="shropshire"&gt;{{cite web|author=web.manager@shropshire.gov.uk |url=http://www.shropshire.gov.uk/outdoor-recreation/parks-and-countryside-sites/llanymynech-heritage-area/ |title=Llanymynech Heritage Area – Shropshire Council |publisher=Shropshire.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=4 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It provides key insights into industrial archaeology, as it was a major centre of the [[Lime (material)|lime]] industry until the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="shropshire" /&gt; It is not known when the lime industry started here, but it may date back to [[medieval]] times or possibly earlier. The first reference to the site is on a map from 1753. Evidence of early settlement locally includes a prehistoric hill fort on Llanmynech HIll, while [[Offa's Dyke]] runs close to the site on the western perimeter. The area also has a long history of industrial activity, including copper and lead mining dating back to at least the [[Roman Britain|Roman period]].&lt;ref name="cpat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpat.org.uk/projects/longer/llanymyn/llanym.htm |title=Clwyd-Powys Archaeological Trust – Projects – Recent projects – Llanymynech |publisher=Cpat.org.uk |date= |accessdate=4 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description of the site ==

Prior to the opening of the Montgomery Canal (then known as the [[Ellesmere Canal]]) in 1796, limestone quarrying was undertaken on the site on a relatively small scale, although lime kilns for lime burning appear to have been within the quarry from at least 1753. In 1806 a tramway and incline was constructed to transport limestone from the quarry to a new wharf on the canal. A second tramway was constructed to the east of the site sometime between 1807–1837 and this became the main transport route, remaining in use until the closure of the quarry in 1914.&lt;ref name="cpat" /&gt;

The 1863 opening of the [[Llanfyllin branch]] line, part of [[Cambrian Railways]], had a major impact on the quarry, enabling much faster transportation of limestone and opening up new potential markets. Additional track and sidings were built along with two [[Lime_kiln#Types_of_kiln|draw kilns]] – located to the west of the Hoffman kiln. Designed for continuous operation and built after 1874, these two kilns were abandoned by 1900.&lt;ref name="cpat" /&gt;

The Hoffman kiln was the last major development on the site and is believed to have been built around 1900, along with additional tramways and rail track. The kiln, which is exceptionally well preserved, measures around {{convert|44.8|xx|17.5|m|ft}} and has two tunnel vaults entered through 14 round-headed arches. The chimney, a local landmark, stands on a plinth and is around {{convert|42.5|m|0}} high.&lt;ref name="cpat" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/grant-aided-properties/hoffman-kiln-chimney-and-draw-kiln-llanymynech-sy22-6jx/ |title=Hoffman Kiln Chimney and Draw Kiln, Llanymynech |publisher=English Heritage |date=12 February 2013 |accessdate=4 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Restoration and community project ==

A restoration project ran from 2006–2009, with funding from both the Heritage Lottery Fund and [[English Heritage]]. Additional financial support also came from the Aggregates Levy Sustainability Fund and project partners, with the aim to conserve the site for visitors and educational purposes.&lt;ref name="shropshire" /&gt;

As part of the project, an archaeological investigation was carried out.&lt;ref name="invest"&gt; Discovering Shropshire's History [http://www.shropshirehistory.org.uk/html/search/verb/GetRecord/theme:20091009142647 "Archaeological investigations at the Llanymynech Limeworks Heritage Site in 2006-7"] Date retrieved: 1 August 2013 &lt;/ref&gt; Its main aim was to gather information about key features of the site – particularly the location of former tramways, ground surfaces and turntable track-beds.&lt;ref name="invest"/&gt;

A local community project also received funding from the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]], highlighting the importance of the area through initiatives including:
* Commissioning a sculpture, information boards, signage and leaflets
* Providing picnic benches and seating
* Volunteer research visit, wharf clearance, tours and opening of the canalside stable block.
* Creating a website and producing a social history archive.&lt;ref name="heritage"&gt;Llanymynech Community Project [http://www.llanymynech.org.uk/html/community_project.html "Community Project"]. Date retrieved: 1 August 2013 &lt;/ref&gt;
== Artefacts from the site ==

Some artefacts discovered at the site in recent years are on display at Oswestry Town Museum. These range from tools and a quarryman's boot to a tramway [[Railroad tie|sleeper]], [[Railway coupling|couplings]] and a [[Pulley|pulley wheel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oswestrytownmuseum.co.uk/index.php/exploring-the-museum/llanymynech-limeworks/ |title=Llanymynech Limeworks |publisher=Oswestry Town Museum |date=20 June 2012 |accessdate=4 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Walking Activities ==
This area contains a variety of short or long walks with routes leading passed lime kilns, woodland, canals, old railways, and grazed pastures.&lt;ref name="shropshire"/&gt; Along these routes are various information panels and sculptures to inform you about the area, some of these pathways are rough and so suitable footwear is recommended.&lt;ref name="shropshire"/&gt;

'''MASCOS''', or the ARC Centre of Excellence for [[Mathematics]] and [[Statistics]] of [[Complex Systems]], was established in 2003 with about $11 million in funding over five years from the  [[Australian Research Council]] (ARC) to research Complex/Intelligent Systems. 

== Overview ==
MASCOS’s overarching strategic vision is to be one of the world’s leading centres in the mathematical and statistical analysis, design and optimisation of complex systems, and to apply that research for scientific, economic, social and environmental benefit. The Centre operates from five nodes: [[The University of Melbourne]], [[Australian National University]], [[The University of New South Wales]], [[The University of Queensland]] and [[La Trobe University]]. In 2008, it will have 14 Chief Investigators and 1 Professorial Fellow, all of whom have international reputations for their research in mathematics and statistics.

[[Complex systems]] play a key role in a vast range of societal activities– climate, the internet, traffic control, power distribution, agriculture, defence, manufacturing, engineering, water management, finance and many more. In any system, be it physical, biological or social, collective phenomena occur as the number of components increase. 

Analysing the behaviour of any individual component gives no indication as to how the system as a whole behaves, but understanding entire systems can lead to the prediction and subsequently the control and optimisation of their behaviour. 

The mathematical and statistical techniques developed to understand these entire complex systems form the basis for the research being undertaken by MASCOS, which in turn has many potential applications to real world problems. 

The underlying problem in complex systems science that guides MASCOS' work may be summed up thus: how do local or small-scale phenomena interact to create complex or chaotic behaviour?

== Applications ==
MASCOS' work revolves around three flagship applications, all of which highlight real-world complex systems, which can be better understood and therefore, potentially, better controlled through the research conducted by MASCOS. These three flagship applications are:

# Accurate assessment of financial risk: The sub-prime loan disaster of 2007 is a reminder of the complex networks that link banks. Even in stable times, the daily fluctuation of interest rates makes the calculation of risk a major challenge.
# Security of large engineering grids: Power grids, the internet and traffic flow can all be described as networks that are prone to dynamic collapse. This, for example, occurred in North American and European power grids in 2003. Security measures are important tools for maintaining system integrity in the face of such critical behaviour.
# Control of emerging pests, diseases and pathogens: Australia has a persistent problem with the introduction of foreign pests or diseases- such as equine flu in 2007.

These, and other applications (e.g. climate modelling) draw upon a variety of mathematical and statistical techniques, which MASCOS has now grouped into four themes. At the mathematical level, each of the themes constitutes a concerted push towards the central problem of the relationship between local behaviour and global complexity. 

Within each theme, clearly identifiable goals are set and a range of projects is tackled. These projects are stepping stones in the solution of the flagship applications described above. Regular workshops are held around each theme, at which agreed projects are developed and reviewed. 

Each theme has a leader and a deputy leader. Almost all members of MASCOS are associated with at least two themes, a situation reflective of their interconnectedness and which maximise cross-pollination of ideas. These are the four themes: 

# Risk Modelling: All complex systems are subject to operational risks, especially those associated with extreme behaviour.
# Critical Phenomena: Critical phenomena are universal features of emergent behaviour in complex systems.
# Dynamical Systems: The complex systems in the flagship applications all involve non-linear dynamical systems.
# Complex Networks: Complexity typically arises from interconnectedness in large-scale systems which can be modelled as a network.

== Focus, scale and interconnectedess ==
The focus, scale and interconnectedness of MASCOS is greatly enhanced by the above-mentioned flagship applications, which are all dependent on the work done in some or all of the four themes. For example, the first application Accurate assessment of financial risk, is being tackled by [[Peter Hall (mathematical statistician)|Hall]]'s classifiers, Borovkov's stochastic analysis, [[Ian Sloan|Sloan]]'s Quasi-Monte Carlo tools and Thompson/Guttmann's Info-Gap work, all supported by the dynamical systems theme members’ studies of stability, and Brent's algorithmic expertise.

The second application, Security of large engineering grids, is being addressed by Hill’s stability theory, Froyland’s and Taylor’s optimisation algorithms, and Pollett’s and Taylor’s network
techniques.

The third application, Control of emerging pests, diseases and pathogens, is being tackled by techniques from risk modelling, such as Pollett’s calibration of stochastic models from discrete-sampled infection data, from Taylor’s work in complex networks in which he develops models that account for spatial structure in the spread of infection, by Brak’s work in critical phenomena – determining conditions for endemicity and other stable regimes, and Froyland’s work in dynamical systems in which he assesses the relative stability of endemic and non-endemic states.

The generic nature of mathematics, where the same methodology can have a wide range of applications, leads to research activities with potentially very broad scale. The above research
program harnesses and exploits this scale particularly well.

== MASCOS legacy ==
An important contribution is the legacy or longer term benefit that the MASCOS research program will provide, and it is here that the mathematical sciences, by their nature, provide broad benefits, even in areas beyond the current scope of MASCOS.

There is a body of common core mathematics and statistics which can be identified as important to solving problems in complex systems such as our flagship applications. The themes are underpinned by a unified mathematical framework which consists of dynamical systems, graph theory, network science, stability theory and stochastic processes that can be used to tackle a wide variety of complex systems problems. The themes are strongly inter-linked. Critical phenomena is being applied to networks to understand transitions, risk analysis is used in studying the reliability of large networks, and dynamical systems theory is used to determine the stability of networks. 

''These links create mathematical synergies toward development of a powerful approach to managing complexity that will be of lasting value to Australian science.''

Thus, for instance, while working on risk classifiers for the first flagship application, Hall's work on classifiers will include improved ways of discriminating among different forms of cancer using genetic data, better ways of detecting covert signals, making the best decisions for important meteorological problems, and so forth. 

The second flagship application will lead to broader ideas on coordinated control that have applications in numerous areas of importance to Australia’s infrastructure. 

Similarly, work done in the third will be of lasting benefit to Australia, not only for its immediate relevance to biosecurity issues, but also because the techniques developed can be applied directly wherever interaction and flow are salient features of the system in question: for example, the control of populations of native fauna, the management of fish stocks, and the propagation of memes in social networks.

More examples of the potential inherent in this approach exist. For instance, improved [[data assimilation]] techniques will be essential for extending existing techniques in meteorology to apply to the wider range of scale and complexity that will arise when developing a new generation of climate models for the Southern Hemisphere. 

The development of the critical dimension of dynamical systems is finding application in coding theory, and Quispel’s bifurcation analysis of the model of the human cortex has already received favourable reactions from both mathematically  and medically oriented research teams. Clinical implementation of control strategies suggested by this work is still at a preliminary stage, but earlier work by collaborator David Liley, based on the same model equations, has already led to a patented EEG reading device.

Additionally, complex networks research undertaken by MASCOS for Patrick Corporation is already being incorporated into Patrick’s software to significantly increase the efficiency of new
container handling infrastructure at Port Botany, Sydney. This research will have a lasting impact on Australia's international trade at Port Botany with the potential to be adopted at other major ports around Australia. While this initial research is embedded in Patrick’s systems, MASCOS continues to hold discussions with Patrick for a second major stage of research. 

Thus, MASCOS’s legacy extends substantially beyond the solution of the flagship applications and key problems– important though they are.

An '''MD–MS program''' is a [[dual degree]] [[graduate school]] program awarding both a [[Doctor of Medicine]] (MD) and a [[Master of Science]] (MS) degree. Post-graduate diploma holders and [[Diplomate of National Board]] (India) candidates can upgrade to an MD-MS degree through opportunities such as post-graduate–up-gradation programs.

== Description ==
An MD-MS Program &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tauedu.org/masters-in-medicine.html |title=M.D./M.S. Programs - Education - Texila American University |publisher=Tauedu.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[tutor]]-based program in which students are trained by research professionals on modern innovations in the healthcare industry. The MD-MS degree is designed for people who intend to pursue clinical practice and want to develop their research skills in a related area of engineering. It is well suited for students who desire a better understanding of the types of technology they may employ as practicing physicians. The MD-MS degree program provides a funded research experience in engineering that is expected to lead to research publishing. The program also provides practice in engineering design and analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://engineering.dartmouth.edu/academics/graduate/mdms/ |title=M.D./M.S. Program &amp;#124; Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth |publisher=Engineering.dartmouth.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The entire course is developed to be mentor-based, enabling the students to be coached by experts attached to a recommended medical center. Most of the courses take place online, via distance learning, leaving professionals free to study without leaving their jobs.

=== Eligibility ===
* Candidates who have appeared and cleared the [[Diplomate of National Board|DNB]] exams 
* Doctors with a post-graduate diploma/degree can study for the PG-up-gradation program

=== Duration ===
Requirements for the combined MD and master's degrees are equivalent to those of the separate degrees of the Doctor of Medicine of the School of Medicine and the specific Master of Science degree at a particular campus. The dual degree program can usually be completed within five to six years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medschool.umaryland.edu/osr/student_md_masters.asp |title=Combined MD/Master's Programs: Office of Student Research: University of Maryland School of Medicine |publisher=Medschool.umaryland.edu |date=2013-04-02 |accessdate=2013-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evaluation ===
Evaluation of the course is assessed by the guide and university through [[thesis]]/[[dissertation]] submitted by the student based on their research project done.

==Examples ==
Biomedical Informatics (BMI) applies statistical techniques and technologies to the medical and health sciences.&lt;ref name=Stanford2008&gt;{{cite web |title=MS Programs - Education - Stanford University School of Medicine |url=http://med.stanford.edu/ms/ |publisher=Med.stanford.edu |date=2008-06-20 |accessdate=2014-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503050513/http://med.stanford.edu/ms/ |archivedate=2014-05-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Epidemiology involves the study of disease — and the predisposing conditions for disease — among human populations in all parts of the world, with an emphasis on approaches to improving levels of health. The MS Program in Epidemiology is presented by the Department of Health Research and Policy (HRP) at the School of Medicine.&lt;ref name=Stanford2008/&gt;

Health Services Research (HSR) is concerned with the analysis of health policy in the public and private sectors. The MS Program in HSR is part of the Department of Health Research and Policy (HRP) at the School of Medicine.&lt;ref name=Stanford2008/&gt;

Masters of Medicine (MOM) includes experience in clinical medicine with a view to foster translational research. Students who pursue the MS in Medicine while engaged in their doctoral programs will be highly knowledgeable about human biology and disease, and thus more able to translate scientific discoveries into useful medical advances.&lt;ref name=Stanford2008/&gt;

Masters of Human Genetics and Genetic Counseling is a program that trains students to understand the molecular, clinical and psychological implications of differences in the human genome, and to translate these intricacies to health care professionals, laboratory researchers and patients/families. Graduates of this program will be eligible for board certification by the American Board of Genetic Counselling.&lt;ref name=Stanford2008/&gt;

'''Mootral''' is the name given to a programme to reduce [[methane]] emissions from [[ruminant]] animals, chiefly [[cow]]s and [[sheep]], but also [[goat]]s. Methane is a major target [[greenhouse gas]] and in the 4th protocol report of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) is recommended to increase from a x23 to x72 multiplier because of the magnitude of its effect relative to [[carbon dioxide]] and short longevity in [[Earth's atmosphere]].

== Natural feed supplement ==

The Mootral natural feed supplement is produced by Neem Biotech. The active ingredient is an organic [[Organosulfur compounds|organosulfur]] compound (normally found in [[garlic]]), Research at the [[University of Aberystwyth]], [[Wales]] has demonstrated up to a 94% reduction in methane production.

==Emission trading==
Mootral is the brand for the project, designed to certify approved methane reduction programmes in which corporates may participate and prove the provenance of their involvement.  Proceeds of [[emission trading]] credits are part donated to [[farmer]]s, who will receive Mootral without charge for adding to their cattle feed. Further surpluses return to programme participants and charities allied to greenhouse gas reduction research.

==Publicity==
Mootral has attracted much recent  attention as runner-up in the FT Global Climate Challenge and Dutch Postcode Lottery.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}  

Mootral is a finalist in the Shell/BBC/Newsweek World Challenge 2009 as one of the 12 most promising solutions to [[climate change]].

'''Persecution of people with albinism''' (sometimes abbreviated PWA&lt;ref name="UTSS history" /&gt;) is based on the belief that certain body parts of [[Albinism|albinistic]] people can transmit magical powers. Such [[superstition]] is present especially in some parts of the [[African Great Lakes]] region, it has been promulgated and exploited by [[witch doctor]]s and others who use such body parts as ingredients in rituals, concoctions and [[potions]] with the claim that their [[Witchcraft|magic]] will bring prosperity to the user (''[[muti]]'' or [[medicine murder]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polsoz.fu-berlin.de/ethnologie/forschung/arbeitsstellen/medical_anthropology/publikationen/0000-MEDIEN/Schuehle_Medicine-Murder-_-Albinism-Tanzania_CAS-Working-Paper-2-2013.pdf|title=Medicine Murder of People with Albinism in Tanzania – How Casino Capitalism Creates Rumorscapes and Occult Economies (Working Paper No. 2-13)|last=Schühle|first=Judith|date=|website=FU-Berlin.de|publisher=Center for Area Studies, Freie Universität Berlin|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125200414/http://www.fu-berlin.de/sites/cas/forschung/publikationen/working-papers/_CAS-Working-2-13_Schuehle.pdf|archivedate=25 January 2016|deadurl=yes|access-date=29 October 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, people with albinism have been persecuted, killed and dismembered, and graves of albinos dug up and desecrated. At the same time, people with albinism have also been ostracised and even killed for exactly the opposite reason, because they are presumed to be cursed and bring bad luck. The persecutions of people with albinism take place mostly in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]n communities, especially among [[East Africa]]ns.&lt;ref name="Cruz-Inigo"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cruz-Inigo|first1=Andres E. |last2=Ladizinski|first2=Barry |last3=Sethi|first3=Aisha |date=January 2011 |title=Albinism in Africa: Stigma, Slaughter and Awareness Campaigns |work=Dermatologic Clinics |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=79–87 |doi=10.1016/j.det.2010.08.015 |url= http://www.derm.theclinics.com/article/S0733-8635(10)00140-3/fulltext |access-date=18 April 2014}} Also available [http://download.journals.elsevierhealth.com/pdfs/journals/0733-8635/PIIS0733863510001403.pdf in PDF format].&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|81}}

Albinism is a genetically inherited condition which is very rare and, worldwide, affects approximately one in twenty thousand people.&lt;ref&gt;Steiefel, (2014) Hats on for skin health: Albinos in Africa a population at risk {{cite web |url=http://www.stiefel.com/en/community-interest/hatsonforskinhealth.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140507033012/http://www.stiefel.com/en/community-interest/hatsonforskinhealth.html |archivedate=7 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }} Accessed 20 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Although rare in the western world, albinism is quite common in sub-Saharan Africa, likely as a result of [[consanguinity]].&lt;ref name="Cruz-Inigo" /&gt; Both parents, who may or may not be albinos themselves, must carry the gene if it is to be passed on to the child. Albinism occurs in both males and females and is not specific to any race or ethnic group. Statistics show that fifty percent of albinistic people in [[Tanzania]] have a known albinistic relative,&lt;ref name="Cruz-Inigo" /&gt;{{rp|80}} although very few understand or are educated about the medical and genetic causes of this condition. Many believe it is a punishment from God or bad luck, and that their "disease" could be contagious, which is often the view of even members of the medical and professional community. These misconceptions, coupled with the lack of education, are some of the key reasons that albinism is so heavily persecuted. This lack of knowledge about people with albinism means that folktales and superstition in the name of witchcraft take the place of medical and scientific facts in the minds of many native Africans, with and without albinism, which in turn has major effects on the social integration of albinistic people into African society. Ninety-eight percent of albinos die by the age of forty for reasons which could easily be prevented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last=Morton |first=T. |date=2014 |title=''Watu Kama Sisi'': Reducing Skin Cancer, Stigma and Violence Against Albinos in the Mara Region |publisher=[[Under the Same Sun]] |location=Canada / Tanzania}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current statistics of persecution of albinistic people==

A report was released on 1 April 2014 by the [[Dar es Salaam]], Tanzania, office of the Canadian charity [[Under the Same Sun]]. Titled ''Reported Attacks of Persons with Albinism'', the document reviews 180 countries and lists 129 recent killings and 181 other attacks, all within 23 African countries. These attacks include mutilation, violence, violation of graves, and cases of asylum-seeking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2014 |title=Reported Attacks of Persons with Albinism – Most Recent Attacks Included. |publisher=[[Under the Same Sun]] |location=Canada / Tanzania |url= http://www.underthesamesun.com/sites/default/files/PWA%20Attacks%20in%20Africa.pdf |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tanzania ===
In Tanzania, albinos represent one in every 1429 births, a much higher rate than in any other nation. According to [[Al-Shymaa Kway-Geer]], an albino member of parliament, there are 6977 officially registered albinos in Tanzania.&lt;ref name="IFRC"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[International Federation of Red Cross]] and [[Red Crescent Societies]]. |title=Advocacy Report: Through Albino Eyes – The Plight of Albino People in Africa's Great Lakes Region and a Red Cross Response |date=2009 |work=IFRC.org |url= https://www.ifrc.org/Global/Publications/general/177800-Albinos-Report-EN.pdf |access-date=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is believed that there may be up to 17000 undocumented.&lt;ref name="BBC wife"&gt;{{cite news |date=2008 |title=Man 'tried to sell' albino wife  |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7726743.stm |access-date=24 April 2014 |publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of albinos have migrated to the [[Dar es Salaam]] area, as they feel safer in an urban setting. Tanzania is thought to have the largest population of albinos in Africa.&lt;ref name="Malone"&gt;{{cite news |first=Andrew |last=Malone |url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1215949/The-albino-tribe-butchered-feed-gruesome-trade-magical-body-parts.html |title=The albino tribe butchered to feed a gruesome trade in 'magical' body parts |date=24 September 2009 |access-date=24 September 2009 |work=[[Daily Mail]] |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albinos are especially persecuted in [[Shinyanga Region|Shinyanga]] and [[Mwanza Region|Mwanza]], where witch doctors have promoted a belief in the potential magical and superstitious properties of albinos' body parts. There are further issues which arise when there is lack of education about albinism. Fathers often suspect the mother of the albino child of infidelity with a white man or that the child is the ghost of a European colonist.&lt;ref name="Cruz-Inigo" /&gt; This can cause immense strain on families and relationships. An albino child is often seen as a bad omen and treated as unwanted. Many albino babies become victims of infanticide due to these superstitious views.

=== Malawi ===
After 2015 when Tanzania enacted tougher steps against violence against albinos, Malawi has seen a "steep upsurge in killings" with 18 reported killings since November 2014, and the likely toll being higher because of missing persons and unreported murders.&lt;ref name=cbs&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/malawi-albinos-hunted-and-murdered-for-their-limbs/| author=AP| title=Albino people are being hunted for their body parts |publisher=CBS| date=June 7, 2016 |accessdate=June 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Peter Mutharika]] has formed a committee to study the situation.&lt;ref name=cbs/&gt; Additionally, Malawi has faced an immense amount of graves belonging to Albino people being robbed in more recent history. In 2017, police found at least 39 cases of illegal removals of the bodies of Albino people from their graves or having body parts removed from their corpses&lt;ref&gt;“The Ritual Murders of People with Albinism in Malawi.” Amnesty International UK, 2 Feb. 2017, 6:50pm, www.amnesty.org.uk/ritual-murders-people-albinism-malawi. Accessed 14 October 2018&lt;/ref&gt;. Another phenomenon that has also begun to occur is an increase in religious leaders, police, and government officials being charged and convicted of slaying Albino people in Malawi. As of 2018, there has been speculation President Mutharika making moves toward implementing the death penalty to convicted murderers of Albino people as a way to significantly decrease the attacks being perpetrated, putting fear into those who do it for business or religious purposes and making it substantially less acceptable by witch doctors and other people who follow superstitions. There is a death penalty in place, but it has not been put in to use since the government changed to democracy in 1994, and convicts who are given the death penalty have sat in prison for life instead&lt;ref&gt;Masina, Lameck. “Malawi Debates Death Penalty to Halt Attacks on Albinos.” VOA, VOA, 24 Apr. 2018, www.voanews.com/a/malawi-debates-death-penalty-attacks-albinos/4363063.html.“Albinism in Malawi Stop The Killings.” Albinism in Malawi Stop The Killings | Amnesty International, 2016, www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2016/06/albinism-in-malawi-stop-the-killings/. &lt;/ref&gt;. The president sees this as a way to tighten judicial control and work to eradicate the hate crimes committed against Albinos.

==Origins of myths and superstition causing persecution of people with albinism==
African rituals and spiritual ideas about albinism have led to the brutal murder of and attacks on innocent men, women and especially children. These ideas have been around for many generations, but in recent years witch doctors have been teaching misconceived ideas about the promise of wealth, success and power when albino hair or limbs are used in a potion as part of witchcraft practices. This has gained public attention nationally and internationally as these crimes have been reported as crimes against human rights. "Infanticide, kidnapping, amputations, and decapitations, committed for purposes of supplying highly valued body parts used for amulets, which are then sold in underground witchcraft market."&lt;ref name="Cruz-Inigo" /&gt;{{rp|79}}  Therefore, this causes great unrest and angst among the albino population, who must be protected and often live in a state of solitude simply to protect their own lives and to prevent being hunted like animals.&lt;ref name="Cruz-Inigo" /&gt;{{rp|80}}

US congressman [[Gerry Connolly]] in 2010 introduced legislation to protect albinos and urge local governments to protect albinos, stating that "With their help and the passage of this resolution today, maybe we can bring an end to these horrific and heinous crimes."&lt;ref&gt;This Day Reporter, (16 March 2010) US Congress passes new law against albinos torture, killings (http://www.thisday.co.tz/?l=10722. Accessed 15 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

It is clear that "the main driving forces underlying these profiling crimes are ignorance, myth, and superstition, such as the belief that individuals with albinism possess superpowers or that their body parts bestow fortune and health."&lt;ref name="Cruz-Inigo" /&gt;{{rp|79}} It is commonly known that in many communities, predominantly in Tanzania and parts of east Africa, superstitious views derived from ancient spiritual beliefs and reinforced by local witch doctors have been carried through centuries of ritualistic practices and mythical beliefs. This creates a serious risk to the lives of persons with albinism as the people believe it will bring them wealth, power, success or health depending on the variances of interpretation. Senior police officers claim that these body parts may be sold for as much as [[United States dollar|US$]]75,000 on the black market&lt;ref name="IFRC" /&gt; for a set of arms, legs, ears, and genitals from an individual with albinism.&lt;ref name="Cruz-Inigo" /&gt;{{rp|79}}&lt;ref name="IFRC" /&gt; Therefore, there has been an extensive amount of albino murders in the past decade especially in Burundi and Tanzania, where in 2007 more than seventy documented killings took place and one hundred and fifty body parts of albinos were reported to have been chopped off. Now the number of killings is well over one hundred, with low conviction rates, and albinos continue to have limbs severed, leaving many crippled or severely maimed, traumatized and tortured in the process.&lt;ref name="IFRC" /&gt;

This threat to albinos has the potential to cause extreme trauma and stress in their daily lives, which are already impacted by the stress of their condition, affecting skin and eyesight, placing albinos in a constant state of insecurity and distrust. According to Navi Pillay, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, because of the social and educational exclusion which can often occur there are often very low education levels in albinos, so that they lack social and economic tools to live productive lives.&lt;ref name="Pillay"&gt;Pillay, Navi (13 March 2014) "People with albinism have the right to live without fear or bullying, discrimination, social exclusion, killing and dismemberment". United Nations High Commissioner. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N_w5C8FWE&amp;feature=youtu.be Accessed 4 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt; It also "is a common belief that albinos have low brain capacity and are unable to function at the same level as 'normal people'.&lt;ref&gt;Kuster R,(2000) White skin, black souls. New African, p. 382&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, their ability to learn is often deficient due to the fact that one hundred percent of albinos suffer from some form of visual impairment&lt;ref name="Cruz-Inigo" /&gt; and there often are not sufficient educational facilities, learning supplies or funding to support children with limited sight. This causes extensive bullying, exclusion from peer groups, low self-esteem and confidence, along with emotional and mental illness stemming from rejection by society and often family members who harbor superstitious myths about albinos. It is clearly revealed that no matter what mythical or spiritual mantra a person may be following or believing about albinos there is a general view in "nearly all cultures in the region of east Africa held and some still hold the view that albinos are less desirable beings who are less than human."&lt;ref name="UTSS history"&gt;{{cite web |work=Under the Same Sun |date=15 July 2013 |title=History of Attacks Against Persons with Albinism (PWA) |url= http://www.underthesamesun.com/sites/default/files/History%20of%20Attacks%20against%20PWA.pdf |access-date=17 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9}} Therefore, homes and schools specifically for albinos, such as Buhangija Albino School, have been created as safe environments for learning, growing and permanently residing. Many children fear to ever return to their families, believing that they may be killed by even their closest relatives. Ukerewe Island is a key example of this, displayed in the film home to a large community of people with albinism where 62 albinos reside, most likely to remain in solitude and away from albino hunters.&lt;ref name="ITSOTS"&gt;Freeland, Harry (2014) In the Shadow of the Sun  http://intheshadowofthesun.org/long-synopsis Accessed 29 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The UN report submitted as part of the Human Rights Council resolution 23/13 of 13 June 2013 states that albinos are often regarded as "ghosts and not human beings, who can be wiped off the global map."&lt;ref name="UNHRC 2013"&gt;United Nations General Assembly: Human Rights Council, 24th Session (12 September 2013) Persons with Albinism. Report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Accessed 24 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}} They are often persecuted as devils or people who are a bad omen or suffer from a curse. In some communities it is "believed that contact with them will bring bad luck, sickness or death."&lt;ref name="UNHRC 2013" /&gt;{{rp|5}} Therefore, this is discrimination and mental and emotional persecution alone, where severe bullying of children, exclusion and abandonment occurs even without brutal physical persecution.

However, the issues which have created a spotlight for the Human Rights Council of the United Nations are the murder of albinos for medicine and dismemberment, and attacks and murder of persons with albinism. Another myth that imposes a risk on people with albinism is the belief that "sexual intercourse with a woman or a girl with albinism can cure HIV/AIDS."&lt;ref name="UNHRC 2013" /&gt;{{rp|5}} Sacrifice of albinos is believed also to "appease the god of the mountain"&lt;ref name="UNHRC 2013" /&gt;{{rp|5}} when fear of a volcano eruption is possible, and it is believed that pulling the hair of albinos can bring good luck. It has also been reported that "miners use the bones of persons with albinism as amulets or bury them where they are drilling for gold.&lt;ref name="UNHRC 2013" /&gt;{{rp|5}} The attacks which occur usually result in the death or severe mutilation of the albino, which according to the Human rights council can in "some cases involve trade in organs, trafficking in persons and sale of children, infanticide and abandonment of children."&lt;ref name="UNHRC 2013" /&gt;{{rp|6}}

==Action against persecution==
With escalating killings, President [[Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete|Kikwete]] publicly and repeatedly condemned [[witch doctor]]s, their helpers and middlemen, and the clients, which include members of the police force, for these murders. Victims include [[child abduction|children snatched or abducted]] from their parents. The killers and their accomplices use hair, arms, legs, skin, eyes, genitals, and blood in rituals or for witch potions.&lt;ref name="Cruz-Inigo" /&gt;

The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has published a preliminary report regarding discrimination which has been directed toward people with albinism.&lt;ref name="UNHRC 2013" /&gt;{{rp|5}} This report has been submitted as part of the Human Rights Council resolution 23/13 of 13 June 2013. It reinforced that "states would adopt specific measures to protect and preserve the rights to life and security of persons with albinism, as well as their right not to be subject to torture and ill treatment, and ensure their access to adequate health care, employment, education and justice."&lt;ref name="UNHRC 2013" /&gt;{{rp|1}} The discrimination of albinos is often demonstrated by family members and relatives especially at birth, and ill-treatment by general society is widespread where there are severe issues of social exclusion and stigma. The Resolution 23/13 explains the Human Rights council's concerns about "attacks against persons with albinism".&lt;ref name="UNHRC 2013" /&gt;{{rp|3}} Therefore, the Council encouraged the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to submit a report. Navi Pillay is the current United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. As the representative, on 11 March 2014 she submitted a message which overviewed the current status of discrimination against persons with albinism and possible pathways for change and development in protection of albinos. "People with albinism have the right to live without fear or bullying, discrimination, social exclusion, killing and dismemberment."&lt;ref name="Pillay" /&gt; This footage was published on 13 March 2014 to overview the current situation surrounding albinos who live in fear of being murdered or captured for the purposes of murder medicine and witch doctors belief in the magical potential of albino hair and limbs.

Also a key issue is the influence of educating the public to encourage the removal of the social stigma associated with albinos in a society which does not completely understand that albinism is not a curse or a spiritual ghost, but simply a skin condition. In Zimbabwe albinos have been given the name ''sope'' which indicated that they are possessed by evil spirits, and in Tanzania they are known as ''nguruwe'' meaning 'pig', or ''zeru'' which means 'ghost'.&lt;ref name="Cruz-Inigo" /&gt; The Report discusses the "most serious human rights violations faced by persons with albinism, primarily focusing on the ritual killings and attacks to which they are subjected."&lt;ref name="UNHRC 2013" /&gt;{{rp|3}} It also includes recommendations to the international community and member states action towards persons with albinism.

Under the Same Sun led by albinism activist Peter Ash is organisation aiming to protect albinos from persecution and he delivered an oral intervention to the Human Rights Council in its 23rd session on 7 June 2013 on behalf of the East and Horn of Africa Human Rights Defenders project (EHAHRDP). His submission stated:

"Today I wish to address a little known but very serious human rights violation being perpetrated against people with albinism in many African nations. My NGO, Under the Same Sun, has evidence of the witchcraft related attacks and killings of 207 people with albinism in 16 African nations. The majority of the victims are children. From Tanzania and Burundi in the East, to Nigeria and Cote d'Ivoire in the West and South Africa and Swaziland in the South, people born with this genetic condition live in fear every day. There exists a lucrative black market in albino body parts used to make what is promoted as powerful ''[[muti]]'' medicine. The hand, arm or any albino organ is combined with other ingredients and then sold for thousands of dollars: $3,000 for a hand or over $100,000 for an entire set of organs. Sometimes body parts are even shipped across borders. We seek a day when people with albinism will take their rightful place in all levels of African society and such days of discrimination will be a faint memory. To this end, we call on this Council to pass a resolution condemning acts of violence and discrimination against persons with albinism and to request the OHCHR or the Advisory Committee to carry out a study on such violations. As Edmund Burke so rightly stated, "all that is necessary for evil to prevail is for good men to do nothing."&lt;ref&gt;Ash, Peter (7 June 2013) Human Rights Council: 23rd Session Item 5: General Debate. Oral Intervention East and Horn of Africa Human Rights Defenders Project (EHAHRDP) http://www.underthesamesun.com/sites/default/files/Speech%20to%20UN%20June%202013.pdf Accessed 24 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future plans==

International federation Secretary General Bekele Geleta states that "Albinism is one of the most unfortunate vulnerabilities… and needs to be addressed immediately at international level."&lt;ref name="IFRC" /&gt;{{rp|20}} This is a cry for international exposure and help to ensure that people suffering from albinism can be protected from inhumane killings and to be sheltered from the merciless hunters of albino body parts for their potions and spiritual medicine. "The main issues that should be addressed include skin cancer prevention education, stigma and discrimination denouncement, and swift prosecution of albino hunters and their sponsors."&lt;ref name="Cruz-Inigo" /&gt;{{rp|80}} Therefore, it is clear that albinos are facing many issues in their lives, and must be protected on the basis of human rights even if they look different and unlike any other race on earth. It is "imperative to inform the medical community and the general national and international public about the tragedies faced by albinos to protect them from skin cancer and ritualistic murders by individuals seeking wealth through clandestine markets perpetuating witchcraft."&lt;ref name="IFRC" /&gt;

A number of steps were taken by the government to protect the albino population.  The president ordered a crackdown on witchdoctors in the spring of 2008.&lt;ref name="bbc403"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/africa/7327989.stm |publisher=[[BBC]] |title=Tanzania in witchdoctor crackdown |date=3 April 2008 |access-date=3 January 2010 |work=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, an albino woman, [[Al-Shymaa Kway-Geer]], was named to become a member of the parliament, the first albino in such a position in the [[history of Tanzania]]. Police have also been advised to generate lists of albinos and provide special protection for them.&lt;ref name="BBC721"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7518049.stm |first=Karen |last=Allen |title=Living in fear: Tanzania's albinos |date=21 July 2008 |access-date=3 January 2010 |work=[[BBC News]] |publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, "Prime Minister Pinda had declared war on the albino hunters, and in an effort to stop the trade in albino body parts he had revoked the licenses of all the country's [[witch doctor]]s who use the body parts in their black magic fetishes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.themorningstarr.co.uk/2009/01/24/tanzania-albino-hunting-update/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724155047/http://www.themorningstarr.co.uk/2009/01/24/tanzania-albino-hunting-update/ |archivedate=24 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Convictions against albino hunters===
The first ever conviction for the killing of an albino in Tanzania occurred on 23 September 2009 at the High Court in [[Kahama, Tanzania|Kahama]].&lt;ref name="Albinos call for public hanging of murderers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Albino killers 'should be hanged'" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Howden"&gt;{{cite news |first=Daniel |last=Howden |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/three-sentenced-to-hang-for-murder-of-an-african-ghost-1792295.html |title=Three sentenced to hang for murder of an African 'ghost' |date=24 September 2009 |access-date=20 April 2014 |work=[[The Independent]] |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Men severed albino boy's legs in ritual killing"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/09/23/2694777.htm?section=world|title=Men severed albino boy's legs in ritual killing |date=23 September 2009|access-date=24 September 2009 |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a "landmark verdict" was due to the fact that there have been more than 50 murders known at this time and this was the first actual conviction.&lt;ref name="Howden" /&gt; The conviction came about following the murder and mutilation of a 14-year-old boy, Matatizo Dunia, who was attacked by three men in [[Bukombe]] district in [[Shinyanga Region]] in December 2008.&lt;ref name="Howden" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Men severed albino boy's legs in ritual killing" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Death for Tanzania albino killers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tanzanian albino killers death sentence"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/africa/2009/09/090923_tanz_albino.shtml |title=Tanzanian albino killers death sentence |date=23 September 2009 |access-date=24 September 2009 |work=[[BBC World Service]] |publisher=[[BBC]]}} Includes audio.&lt;/ref&gt; The men carried Dunia from his home late at night before brutally murdering him. &lt;ref name="Malone" /&gt;

One of them was later found with Dunia's leg in his possession.&lt;ref name="Malone" /&gt; The rest of Dunia's body parts were located concealed in shrubbery.&lt;ref name="Malone" /&gt; The men confessed a desire to sell Dunia's parts to a witch doctor, yet despite this, their legal team had not anticipated the [[capital punishment|death sentence]] of hanging which the three men would receive.&lt;ref name="Malone" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Death for Tanzania albino killers"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8270446.stm |title=Death for Tanzania albino killers |date=23 September 2009 |access-date=24 September 2009 |publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canada- and Tanzania-based [[Under The Same Sun]] albinism activist organisation praised the breakthrough but its founder Peter Ash remarked: "This is one conviction. There are 52 other families still awaiting justice".&lt;ref name="Three men to hang for Tanzania albino murder"&gt;{{cite news |first=George |last=Obulutsa |url= https://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE58M0IE20090923 |title=Three men to hang for Tanzania albino murder |date=23 September 2009 |access-date=24 September 2009 |agency=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tanzania Albino Society's chairman Ernest Kimaya called for the [[public execution|hanging to be made public]] to further demonstrate to others that the issue of killing albinos was to be taken seriously.&lt;ref name="Albinos call for public hanging of murderers"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://thecitizen.co.tz/newe.php?id=15284 |title=Albinos call for public hanging of murderers |date=24 September 2009 |access-date=24 September 2009 |work=[[The Citizen (South Africa)|The Citizen]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Albino killers 'should be hanged'"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8273139.stm |title=Albino killers 'should be hanged' |date=24 September 2009 |access-date=24 September 2009 |publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Albino killers to be hanged"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gbcghana.com/news/28493detail.html |title=Albino killers to be hanged |date=25 September 2009 |access-date=25 September 2009 |publisher=[[Ghana Broadcasting Corporation]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090928213536/http://gbcghana.com/news/28493detail.html |archivedate=28 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This issue with witchcraft and its power and influence is that a witch doctor has, as he is almost always "revered by society as ultimate truth."&lt;ref name="UTSS history" /&gt;{{rp|3}} Most tribes in ancient times would have committed infanticide upon an albino child seeing it as a bad omen, practiced by the [[Sukuma people|Sukuma]], the [[Digo people|Digo]] and the [[Maasai people|Maasai]].&lt;ref name="UTSS history" /&gt;{{rp|5}} However, in some tribes the albinos were made the sacrifices of offerings to the gods or for such uses as potions which is what they are still hunted for today in the 21st century. "One of the most dangerous myths and the crux of recent attacks against PWA is that their body parts can be made into potions that give good luck and wealth to its users."&lt;ref name="UTSS history" /&gt;{{rp|4}}

In 2006 some of the first publicly reported killings were spoken about in the media, such as 34-year-old albino woman, Arithi, who was murdered with her arms and legs hacked off and sold. Some cases which have been key in recent years firstly occurred in 2008 when a Tanzanian man tried to sell his albino wife for a price of US$3,000 to Congolese businessmen.&lt;ref name="BBC wife" /&gt; Although the businessmen managed to escape their arrest, Interpol has been assigned to attempt to track these men. this is what led to President Jakaya Kikewere ordering a tightening of police and protection from prosecution, however due to corruption there is still proof that even policeman are being bribed and "bought off" to turn a blind eye to certain crimes if they are receiving pecuniary gain. Although according to BBC News one hundred and seventy witch doctors have been arrested for involvement in inhumane interactions and intentions with albinos.&lt;ref name="BBC wife" /&gt;

Another example which occurred where two mothers who were attacked by gangs with machetes in order to get to their albino children. The men broke into a refugee house known as the Lugufu Camp in Kigoma in search of the children; although the children remained untouched the women received severe injuries.&lt;ref name="Howden" /&gt; A further case uncovered by US congressman Gerry Connolly was the November 2008 in Ruyigi, Burundi where the case of a 6-year old albino girl who was shot dead and her head and limbs where hacked off, leaving only her dismembered torso.&lt;ref&gt;This Day Reporter (16 March 2010) US Congress passes new law against albinos torture, killings (http://www.thisday.co.tz/?l=10722. Accessed 15 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations to prevent persecution==

Many organisations have been set up to help protect and provide for communities with albinism. Films have also been produced to encourage, educate and create an international understanding of the trials which persons with albinism are facing in a modern world still dealing with ancient rituals and practices which encourage murder for medicine. This is against all international human rights legislation and therefore it is important that persons with albinism are collectively protected. Organisations such as National Organization for Albinism and Hypopigmentation (NOAH),&lt;ref&gt;The National Organization for Albinism and Hypopigmentation (NOAH) http://www.albinism.org&lt;/ref&gt; Tanzania Albino Centre (TAC)&lt;ref&gt;Tanzania Albino Center (TAC) http://www.tanzaniaalbino.org/ )&lt;/ref&gt; based in Arusha, Tanzania; aiming to "improve the lives of albinos with educational and medical assistance so that they may live safe, accepted, and prosperous lives in the society of their choice."&lt;ref name="Cruz-Inigo" /&gt; Other groups include Assisting Children in Need (ACN);&lt;ref&gt;Assisting Children in Need (ACN) http://www.assistingchildreninneed.com&lt;/ref&gt; and Under the Same Sun&lt;ref name="underthesamesun.com"&gt;Ash, Peter (2014)  {{cite web |url=http://www.underthesamesun.com/home.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110209142022/http://www.underthesamesun.com/home.php |archivedate=9 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }} Under the Same Sun (2014). Accessed 20 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; where Ash, having albinism himself, states his aspirations and purpose for the project: "I have a dream that one day in Africa, people with albinism will take their rightful place throughout every level of society, and that the days of discrimination against persons with albinism will be a faint memory!"&lt;ref name="underthesamesun.com" /&gt;

The International Federation of Red Cross (IFRC) is a key part of the albino protection movement who are working to integrate persons with albinism back into society safely in Burundi "striving to minimize their vulnerability to hunters, skin cancer, and educational and social marginalization."&lt;ref name="Cruz-Inigo" /&gt;{{rp|84}} The IFRC particularly works with protecting mothers and children who are fearing persecution and they assist them in providing safe homes and protection where children are frightened of attacker's and by providing a special arena for the albinos it ensures safety protection and an environment of love, understanding of one another all with albinism, and unity in the battle against persecution and discrimination. The Red Cross have made it very clear in their publications that the government must also take drastic steps in protection of persons with albinism to stop the persecution.  They have stated that it is imperative that the government strives to "Ensure effective legal protection for people with albinism, use local administrative structures to locate and protect albino people in hiding and conduct public anti-discrimination campaigns and extend medical services to albinos in need."&lt;ref name="IFRC" /&gt;

Asante Mariamu is another organisation which was created after the survival of Mariamu Staford from an anti-albino attack which is determined to ensure that there is "swift prosecution and convictions of their killers" and therefore encouraging justice.&lt;ref name="Cruz-Inigo" /&gt;{{rp|84}} This story was presented to the US House of Representatives in March 2010 where US Congressman Gerry Connolly was impacted by this horrific story and "moved me to take action."&lt;ref name="TDR"&gt;This Day Reporter (16 March 2010) US Congress passes new law against albinos torture, killings. http://www.thisday.co.tz/?l=10722. Accessed 15 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; He introduced a bill to take action to severe violence being performed against persons with albinism in east Africa and to bring justice and punishment to perpetrators. He spoke to the house in March 2010 urging his colleagues "to join me and Mariamu Stanford in bringing international attention to this horrific abuse of human rights."&lt;ref name="TDR" /&gt; This legislation condemns any injury, murder or mutilation of persons with albinism and specifically urges the local east African government especially in Tanzania and Burundi "to take immediate action to prevent further violence against persons with albinism."&lt;ref name="TDR" /&gt; There are many more which are working on protecting persons with albinism from persecution, and providing adequate health care, sun protection and learning facilities to ensure that persons with albinism are treated fairly and with all human rights, and not hunted as animals in fear of their life. Albino Awareness day has also been created by Dr Aisha Sethi who is an assistant professor of dermatology in the Pritzker School of Medicine which is celebrated on 4th May each year. The President has also appointed Al-Shymaa Kway-Geer, himself a person with albinism, as an MP who seeks to be a voice in the Tanzanian parliament for protection against persecution of persons with albinism in society and encourages facilities and support of their physical, medical, and education protection and enhancement.

===Under the Same Sun (UTSS)===
{{Main|Under the Same Sun}}
[[Under the Same Sun]] is a Canadian-founded organization with support focused on Tanzania and based in Dar es Salam, founded in 2008 by [[Peter Ash (activist)|Peter Ash]] with a vision to "promote via advocacy and education, the wellbeing of persons who are often marginalized or misunderstood. We are driven by the belief that all persons have intrinsic value and since they are created in the image of God."&lt;ref&gt;Ash, Peter (2014) Under the Same Sun:  UTSS Information fact brochure {{cite web |url=http://www.underthesamesun.com/sites/default/files/About%20Us%20Brochure.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140507035422/http://www.underthesamesun.com/sites/default/files/About%20Us%20Brochure.pdf |archivedate=7 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, they are acting upon the moral and human rights values to support victims to end the discrimination and persecution of innocent persons with albinism.  According to [[Under The Same Sun]], to eradicate attacks against persons with albinism, "it is necessary to focus on eliminating reliance on witchcraft beliefs by strengthening the provision of infrastructure such as schools and hospitals while enhancing the sense of fairness by improving on the system of justice."&lt;ref name="UTSS history" /&gt;{{rp|4}} Therefore, regaining persons with albinism their rights to being treated as human, fairly as functioning members of society who may look different and suffer severe vulnerabilities die to their physical condition, but do not deserve to be murdered or hurt in any way because of ancient myths claiming sacrifice of these people will create future benefit for another person.

=== Amnesty International (AI) ===
[[Amnesty International]] is a human rights organization that was established by Peter Benenson, a British lawyer and human rights activist, in 1961. It has many city-centered offices in Africa, Asia-Pacific, Central, and Eastern Europe, Latin America and the Middle East. The goal of the organization is to assist in obtaining freedom and success for everyone globally. It has run several campaigns against the persecution and discrimination of persons with albinism. 'Albinism in Malawi: Stop the Killings' is a campaign run by the organization that was started to “stop ritual murders of people with Albinism” &lt;ref&gt;"Albinism in Malawi Stop The Killings.” Albinism in Malawi Stop The Killings | Amnesty International, 2016, &lt;/ref&gt;. In addition, the organization provides a plethora of information and statistical research on albinism for other organizations that fight for the same cause.

==Films highlighting persecution of albinism==

Films which have been created are also helping to raise awareness and tell the stories of persecuted persons with albinism, beginning with ''[[In My Genes]]'', a 2009 Kenyan [[Documentary film|documentary]] directed by [[Lupita Nyong'o]] (later a key actor from the 2013 film ''[[Twelve Years a Slave]]''). It was followed in 2010 by ''[[White and Black: Crimes of Color]]'', by Canadian filmmaker Jean-François Méan, which tells the story of Vicky Ntetema, a Tanzanian journalist who investigated the trade for albinotic body parts in Tanzania. This film became the cornerstone of a national campaign sponsored by [[Under the Same Sun]] to end the wave of violence. After the film's broadcast, the murder rate, which had been steady for three years, dropped by 90%.&lt;ref&gt;http://allafrica.com/stories/201211230077.html&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update after|2012|12|31|Articles with obsolete information from December 2012|reason=More recent 2013–2015 sources indicate that the numbers have gone up again, significantly.

[[White Shadow (film)|''White Shadow'']], a [[Germany|German]]–[[Italy|Italian]]–[[Tanzania]]n 2013 [[drama film]] written, produced and directed by Noaz Deshe, drew international attention to the issue, screening at various [[film festival]]s, winning the Lion of the Future Award at the Venice festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Noaz Deshe on his Film, White Shadow: A Fight for Survival in East Africa|url=http://www.internationalpolicydigest.org/2014/01/24/noaz-deshe-on-his-film-white-shadow-a-fight-for-survival-in-east-africa/|access-date=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sundance Interview with Noaz Deshe, director of White Shadow|url=http://cltampa.com/artbreaker/archives/2014/01/27/sundance-interview-with-noaz-deshe-director-of-white-shadow|access-date=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=70th Venice Film Festival Award Winners |url= http://collider.com/venice-film-festival-award-winners/ |access-date=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also released in 2013, ''[[In the Shadow of the Sun (documentary)|In the Shadow of the Sun]]'', a documentary filmed in Tanzania over the course of six years by Harry Freeland, featured the struggles of [[Josephat Torner]], a campaigner for de-mystification of the superstitions about albinistic people and their use for witchcraft; and teenaged Vedastus, who hopes to survive the persecution of persons with albinism to adulthood.&lt;ref name="ITSOTS" /&gt; 
And also The Beautiful Ones Are Born, a yet to be released short film by one of the youngest Nigerian Film maker Dami Taiwo.

==Other African countries==
By June 2008 killings had been reported in neighboring [[Kenya]] and possibly also the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]].&lt;ref name="kul" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{Cite news

In October 2008 [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] reported on the further expansion of killings of albinos to the [[Ruyigi]] region of [[Burundi]].  Body parts of the victims are then smuggled to Tanzania where they are used for witch doctor rituals and potions.&lt;ref name="afp"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.france24.com/20081014-burundis-albinos-flee-sorcerers-organ-traders |first=Esdras |last=Ndikumanna |title=Burundi's albinos flee sorcerers and organ traders |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=14 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929003917/http://www.france24.com/20081014-burundis-albinos-flee-sorcerers-organ-traders |archivedate=29 September 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Albinos have become "a commercial good", commented Nicodeme Gahimbare in Ruyigi, who established a local safe haven in his fortified house.&lt;ref name="afp" /&gt;

===South Africa===
====Biology====
Oculocutaneous albinism, OCA2, is the most common gene type of albinism inherited disorders among the indigenous people Southern Africa. It occurs at a frequency of 1:4000. The incidence in [[Sotho people]] in northern South Africa is at its highest, with a ratio of 1:1500 in neonates.&lt;ref name="doi.org"&gt;Patricia M. Lund  Retha Gaigher.

South African [[human geneticist]], [[Trefor Jenkins]] has made vast contributions to assist in understanding the social and cultural milieu of albinism, the medical risks and implications, resolving the molecular basis and aetiology for OCA2 in Southern Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Int J Ophthalmol. 2014; 7(3): 563–573.

====Skin Cancer====
Children with albinism in rural areas are exposed to high levels of ultraviolet light without the adequate protective gear resulting in skin damage. Only 12% of public schools provided SPF15 sunscreen for children with albinism. [[Squamous cell carcinoma]] of the head and neck is the most common type of cutaneous tumours in African patients with albinism. Non melanoma cancers, namely basal and squamos cell carcinoma, which are usually rare in black populations are common among the vulnerable group living with albinism. A South African study of 111 participants with OCA revealed that 23%
of these participants developed skin cancer with the head area being the most commonly affected site.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Many people from rural areas like the Eastern Cape with albinism are unaware of the precautionary measures required to protect their skin. Dr Willie Visser, head of the dermatology division at Stellenbosch University and [[Tygerberg Hospital]], said that while white South Africans presented with skin cancer only after the age of 60, most albinos presented with skin cancer as young as 20. The government health facilities are required to provide sunblock lotion to albinos on a monthly basis however this need is not always met due to stock-outs and lack of knowledge on the part of health workers.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.iol.co.za/weekend-argus/lifestyle/albinos-have-higher-cancer-risk-7632653 Accessed 3 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www0.sun.ac.za/vivus/vivus-1-february-2017/engagement/doctors-reach-out-to-children-at-risk-for-skin-cancer.html Accessed 3 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

====Racial classification====
Racial appearance and descent played a key role in the racial classification process during [[Apartheid]]. Additionally, different sociological and psychological give skin colour its many connotations. Skin colour is traditionally an instant indicator of identifying race and racial differences. Traditional definitions of race suggest that race and colour are inseparable however, for people with albinism race and colour are not linked. Though colour and race are used interchangeably, they remain independent grounds for discrimination. Individuals living with albinism should be protected against unfair discrimination on the basis of their race as well as their skin tone. Individuals living with albinism are exposed to discrimination, stigmatisation and prejudice based on their colour as well as their race. Skin tone discrimination may be interracial or it can be intraracial. Intraracial skin colour discrimination occurs when an individual of a particular racial group makes a distinction on the basis of skin colour between persons of the same racial group, while interracial colourism takes place when an individual of a particular racial group makes a distinction on the basis of skin colour between persons of another racial group. Scott argues that because current classifications of race do not afford people living with albinism adequate protection, a new category of colour should be proposed.&lt;ref&gt;Scott S. A new category of colour: Analyzing albinism under Title VII of the Americans with Disabilities Act. J Gender Race &amp; Just 1999;2(2):508.&lt;/ref&gt; Mswela argues that additional divisions and classifications of race will reinforce problems associated with race.&lt;ref&gt;S Afr J BL 2013;6(1):25-27.

====Discrimination====
The difference in appearance in the child with albinism creates socialization and adaption problems. The distinctive phenotypical difference of black (African) people with albinism and the rest of the population group leads to barriers in social integration thus ostracism.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; South Africans living with albinism are among the most vulnerable in the country and there is hardly a serious attempt to protect these citizens from human rights violations, violent crimes, and threats. The extent of violent crimes for people with albinism is not as high as other African countries however, surges of violent crimes against people with albinism have been noted.&lt;ref&gt;Maureen Mswela.  African Human Rights Law Journal, Volume 17 Number 1, Aug 2017, p. 114 - 133. https://journals.co.za/content/journal/10520/EJC-8dc964ce9 Accessed 3 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Their sensitivity to sunlight, which limits the extent to which they can participate in outdoor activities, contributes to the physical and social isolation of children living with albinism.&lt;ref name="doi.org"/&gt; There has been an obligation and responsibility placed on the government to protect vulnerable people after the constitutional court decision on the [[Carmichele v Minister of Safety &amp; Security]] case. The litigation in the Carmichele case creates a strategy for bringing a precautionary suit against the state based on the contention that the state has a duty to protect persons with albinism from violent acts.&lt;ref&gt;M Mswela ‘Violent attacks against persons with albinism in South Africa: A human rights perspective ’ (2017) 17 African Human Rights Law Journal 114-133

==== '''Community and Personal Identity''' ====
African people who suffer from Albinism are inherently stuck between two racial identities. One side of the spectrum views Albino people as white, due to the color of their skin.  Another person might view Albinos as members of the black community due to the skin color of their other family members. Another contributor to this identity crisis is the negative stigma that surrounds Albino people within African society. The falsely informed notion that babies are born with Albinism as a result of a curse that was brought on by a member of his/her family is a significant weight that leaves people with Albinism debating their dignity. One thing to recognize is that studies done on Albinistic Africans demonstrate that many have a very deep self-understanding of who they are and where they belong in society &lt;ref&gt;Blankenberg, Ngaire. “That Rare and Random Tribe: Albino Identity in South Africa.”&lt;/ref&gt;. In other words, the two polarizing color identities that Albino people fall under allow them to be very sure of themselves when they do eventually find their place in society. Family and community also play an essential role in Albinistic identity. The way that a community behaves toward an individual can make or break their sense of self. Research shows that social identities enhance members' well‐being through the provision of social support and feelings of collective efficacy as well as by acting as a basis for collective action&lt;ref&gt;McNamara, Niamh, et al. “Community Identity as Resource and Context: A Mixed Method Investigation of Coping and Collective Action in a Disadvantaged Community.” 2013&lt;/ref&gt;. In most cases, the surrounding community and family of Albinos highly mediates their acceptance&lt;ref&gt;Blankenberg, Ngaire. “That Rare and Random Tribe: Albino Identity in South Africa.”&lt;/ref&gt;. Plans for the future, in regards to eliminating persecution and negative stigmas that encompass individuals who have Albinism, appear to incorporate methods that involve focusing on community and family-based acceptance complementary to institutionally-based changes.

====Myths====
Many African communities depend on traditional explanations of albinism rather than the biomedical explanation. This often leads to a negative socialisation of the individual with albinism.&lt;ref name="doi.org"/&gt; People living with albinism are often referred to by derogatory names such as 'inkawu', the [[Nguni languages|Nguni]] term for white baboon, 'isishawa' a [[Zulu people|Zulu]] translation of a person who is cursed as well as 'zeru zeru' which means ghost like.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sowetanlive.co.za/news/2017/06/05/being-black-in-a-white-skin-students-with-albinism-battle-prejudice Accessed 3 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt;
The Swahili term 'zeru' is also commonly used in [[Tanzania]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sowetanlive.co.za/sowetan/archive/2008/09/03/under-skins-of-fear Accessed 3 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Three people were convicted of the murder of 20 year old Thandazile Mpunzi, including her 17 year old boyfriend. The boyfriend lured Mpunzi to an isolated area on the afternoon of August 1, 2015 in the Phelandaba area of Emanguzi in northern [[KwaZulu-Natal]]. She was strangled, murdered and body parts dismembered. They planned to sell the body parts of Thandazile Mpunzi for a fortune. They claimed that a [[traditional healer]] told them they would get rich if they mixed Mpunzi's blood and parts with 'muthi'. Two of the accused pleaded guilty of murder and are sentenced to 20 years imprisonment. Numerous accounts of murdered as well as missing people with albinism are reported. The trading of albino body parts has become a lucrative business.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21700395-superstition-fuelling-grisly-trade-human-body-parts-tanzania-shows-how-it-can-be Accessed 3 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.enca.com/south-africa/kzn-teenager-gets-18-year-sentence-albino-girlfriends-muti-murder Accessed 3 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.enca.com/south-africa/missing-albino-boys-family-not-suspects-says-police Accessed 3 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==International reaction==
After events involving murders of albino people by three Tanzanian men had been publicised by the [[BBC News|BBC]] and others, the [[European Parliament]] strongly condemned the killing of albinos in Tanzania on 4 September 2008.&lt;ref name="EU"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+TA+P6-TA-2008-0413+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN&amp;language=EN |title=Resolution on the killing of albinos in Tanzania |publisher=[[European Parliament]] |date=4 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The U.S. House of Representatives passed H. Resolution 1088, introduced by Rep. Gerry Connolly ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]], [[Virginia|VA]]), by a vote of 418-1 on 22 February 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-hr1088/show H. Resolution 1088 at opencongress.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202120346/http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-hr1088/show |date=2 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution condemns the attacks and killings; categorizes them as human rights violations, and urges the governments of Tanzania and Burundi to vigorously prosecute such cases and to conduct educational campaigns to combat the superstitious beliefs that underlie the violent attacks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5053">'''Peter Kivy''' (October 22, 1934 – May 6, 2017&lt;ref&gt;[https://aesthetics-online.site-ym.com/news/344130/Peter-Kivy-1934-2017.htm Tribute] at the [[American Society for Aesthetics]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sinfoniavirtual.com/revista/032/joykivy.pdf James O. Young: In Memoriam Peter Kivy], bilingüal edition (English/Spanish, translation by Daniel Martín Sáez) at ''Sinfonía Virtual. Revista de Música Clásica'', nº 32 (2017), pp. 1-3.&lt;/ref&gt;) was professor emeritus of musicology and philosophy at [[Rutgers University]]. He studied particularly the [[philosophy of music]].

==Biography==
Kivy earned master's degrees in both philosophy ([[University of Michigan]], 1958) and musicology ([[Yale University]], 1960). He earned his PhD at [[Columbia University]] in 1966. He joined the faculty at Rutgers the following year, and became full professor in 1976. He taught there for his whole career except one year as a visiting professor at [[University of California, Santa Barbara]].

His early work was on the 18th-century British aesthetics, and was influenced by [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]]. From there he developed an interest in analytic aesthetics. From the late 1970s on, he had been interested mainly in music philosophy. His book ''The Corded Shell'' made him a central figure in music aesthetics.&lt;ref name=Cumming&gt;Cumming.&lt;/ref&gt;

One preoccupation of his had been the problem of what it means for instrumental music to "express" an emotion. His answer is that common emotions have physical behavioral expression in people that can be understood by appearance and imitated in music; thus, music cannot express more complex emotions that do not have an obvious behavioral expression. A similar position is followed by [[Stephen Davies (philosopher)|Stephen Davies]].&lt;ref name=Cumming/&gt;

Some criticism of Kivy's ideas is available in ''Music, Philosophy, and Modernity'' (2007) by [[Andrew Bowie]] and ''Filosofía de la Música. Respuestas a Peter Kivy'' (2017, published in Spanish) by [[James O. Young]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5126">The '''qirad''' was one of the basic financial instruments of the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]].  It was an arrangement between one or more investors and an agent where the investors entrusted capital to an agent who then traded with it in hopes of making profit.  Both parties then received a previously settled portion of the profit, though the agent was not liable for any losses.

== Origins and history ==
Although the qirad is never mentioned in the [[Qur'an]], many Islamic traditions attribute its origin to the Prophet [[Muhammad]] and his companions.  These traditions describe [[Muhammad]] and his companions either using the qirad or endorsing the institution &lt;ref&gt;Avram Udovitch, "Partnership and Profit in Medieval Islam", (Princeton University Press, 1970) p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; Many will notice that the qirad is almost identical to the institution of the [[Limited partnership|commenda]] later used in western Europe, though whether the qirad transformed into the commenda, or the two institutions evolved independently cannot be stated with certainty.&lt;ref&gt;Robert H. Hillman, "Limited Liability in Historical Perspective", (Washington and Lee Law Review, Spring 1997), Benedikt Koehler, "Islamic Finance as a Progenitor of Venture Capital", (Economic Affairs, December 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal technicalities ==
Though there existed several different major schools of Islamic law, the basic legalities of the qirad were rather uniform throughout the schools.

[[Dinars]] and [[dirhams]], as well as gold, silver, and copper coins in circulation were allowed to be invested.  However, goods such as barley were restricted from the qirad because the possible fluctuations in their value in the free market.&lt;ref&gt;Udovitch op cit pp. 177-181&lt;/ref&gt;

The agent was allowed to take the investment and split up his investments in any way, as well as invest in anything he wanted,&lt;ref&gt;Malik ibn Anas, al-Muwatta', 280-282 (Kegan Paul International, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; except in cases where stocks are plentiful and not seasonally bound.&lt;ref name=MM3235&gt;[http://www.iium.edu.my/deed/hadith/malik/032_mmt.html#032.32.3.5 Malik's Muwatta 32.3.5]&lt;/ref&gt; It was also permissible for an investor to forbid the agent from buying certain kinds of goods.&lt;ref name=MM3235/&gt; Many of the third parties involved in the qirad were actually unaware of their involvement which allowed the agent to trade freely and without liability.&lt;ref&gt;Hillman op cit&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the fractional split in profit was agreed on beforehand, the investor could not stipulate a specific sum of the money from the profit, or that a certain profit be made.  In this way, the qirad remained a complete risk on the investor and did not infringe on the free market economy.,&lt;ref&gt;Udovitch op cit, pp. 190-193&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Malik op cit&lt;/ref&gt; It was however possible to make a deal on the split of the profit beforehand by stipulating a specific percentage. This could be either a low or a high percentage.&lt;ref name=MM3235/&gt;

The principal investment can not be paid back, either by the investor ending the agreement, or the agent ending the agreement, if the principal is still invested in goods. The goods must be sold before the principal can be handed back, and the profits split.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iium.edu.my/deed/hadith/malik/032_mmt.html#032.32.4.6 Malik's Muwatta 32.4.6]&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the investor is allowed to buy goods from the agent if he does not connect any conditions to this transaction.&lt;ref name=MM3223&gt;[http://www.iium.edu.my/deed/hadith/malik/032_mmt.html#032.32.2.3 Malik's Muwatta 32.2.3]&lt;/ref&gt;

The agent can also ask the help of a servant of the investor, but this servant also has to share in the profit and can not be asked to do any other work than work connected to the investment.&lt;ref name=MM3235/&gt; A servant can also invest in the same investment as his master and also shares in the profit.&lt;ref name=MM3223/&gt;

If the agent has to hire help for a job, the wage for this person can be paid from the principal, except if the wage should result in loss for the investor, the agent himself is responsible for whatever is not covered by the principal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iium.edu.my/deed/hadith/malik/032_mmt.html#032.32.6.8 Malik's Muwatta 32.6.8]&lt;/ref&gt;

The agent can use the principal for food and clothes if he should travel for his business, and the principal is large enough to allow it. If he stays at home this is not allowed.&lt;ref name=MM3223/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iium.edu.my/deed/hadith/malik/032_mmt.html#032.32.8.10 Malik's Muwatta 32.8.10]&lt;/ref&gt;

An agent can invest the money of an investor, the agent then becomes an investor himself, but he is then liable for the losses of the second agent. If the principal decreases, the original investor is allowed to ask the original agent to cover the loss.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iium.edu.my/deed/hadith/malik/032_mmt.html#032.32.7.9 Malik's Muwatta 32.7.9]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sound recording and reproduction''' is an [[electrical]], [[Mechanical system|mechanical]], electronic, or digital inscription and re-creation of [[sound]] waves, such as spoken voice, singing, [[instrumental music]], or [[sound effect]]s. The two main classes of sound recording technology are [[analog recording]] and [[digital recording]]. 

Acoustic analog recording is achieved by a [[microphone diaphragm]] that senses changes in [[atmospheric pressure]] caused by [[acoustics|acoustic]] sound waves and records them as a mechanical representation of the sound waves on a medium such as a [[phonograph]] record (in which a stylus cuts grooves on a record).  In [[magnetic tape]] recording, the sound waves vibrate the microphone diaphragm and are converted into a varying [[electric current]], which is then converted to a varying [[magnetic field]] by an [[electromagnet]], which makes a representation of the sound as magnetized areas on a plastic tape with a magnetic coating on it. Analog sound reproduction is the reverse process, with a bigger [[loudspeaker diaphragm]] causing changes to atmospheric pressure to form acoustic sound waves.

Digital recording and reproduction converts the analog sound signal picked up by the microphone to a [[Digital audio|digital form]] by the process of [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampling]]. This lets the audio data be stored and [[Data transmission|transmitted]] by a wider variety of media.  Digital recording stores audio as a series of [[binary number]]s (zeros and ones) representing samples of the amplitude of the [[audio signal]] at equal time intervals, at a [[sample rate]] high enough to convey all sounds capable of being [[Hearing (sense)|heard]]. A [[digital audio]] signal must be reconverted to analog form during playback before it is [[power amplifier|amplified]] and connected to a [[loudspeaker]] to produce sound.

Prior to the development of sound recording, there were mechanical systems, such as wind-up [[music box]]es and, later, [[player piano]]s, for encoding and reproducing instrumental music.

==Pre-history==
{{See also|History of sound recording}}

Long before [[sound]] was first recorded, music was recorded—first by written [[music notation]], then also by mechanical devices (e.g., wind-up [[music box]]es, in which a mechanism turns a spindle, which plucks metal tines, thus reproducing a [[melody]]). Automatic music reproduction traces back as far as the 9th century, when the [[Banū Mūsā]] brothers invented the earliest known mechanical musical instrument, in this case, a [[hydropower]]ed (water-powered) [[Organ (music)|organ]] that played interchangeable cylinders. According to Charles B. Fowler, this "...cylinder with raised pins on the surface remained the basic device to produce and reproduce music mechanically until the second half of the nineteenth century." The Banū Mūsā brothers also invented an automatic [[flute]] player, which appears to have been the first [[programmable machine]].&lt;ref name="Fowler 45–49"&gt;{{citation|title=The Museum of Music: A History of Mechanical Instruments|first=Charles B.|last=Fowler|journal=Music Educators Journal|volume=54|issue=2|date=October 1967|pages=45–49|doi=10.2307/3391092|publisher=MENC_ The National Association for Music Education|jstor=3391092}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Koetsier&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Koetsier |first1=Teun |year=2001 |title=On the prehistory of programmable machines: musical automata, looms, calculators |journal=Mechanism and Machine Theory |volume=36 |issue=5 |pages=589–603 |publisher=Elsevier |doi=10.1016/S0094-114X(01)00005-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 14th century, a mechanical bell-ringer controlled by a rotating cylinder was introduced in [[Flanders]].{{cn|date=April 2018}} Similar designs appeared in [[barrel organ]]s (15th century), [[musical clock]]s (1598), [[barrel piano]]s (1805), and [[music box]]es (ca. 1800). A music box is an automatic [[musical instrument]] that produces sounds by the use of a set of pins placed on a revolving cylinder or disc so as to pluck the tuned teeth (or [[Lamellophone|''lamellae'']]) of a steel comb.

The [[fairground organ]], developed in 1892, used a system of accordion-folded punched cardboard books. The [[player piano]], first demonstrated in 1876, used a punched paper scroll that could store a long piece of music. The most sophisticated of the piano rolls were hand-played, meaning that the roll represented the actual performance of an individual, not just a transcription of the sheet music. This technology to record a live performance onto a piano roll was not developed until 1904. Piano rolls were in continuous mass production from 1896 to 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pianola.org/history/history_pianoplayers.cfm|title=The Pianola Institute - History of the Pianola - Piano Players|website=Pianola.org|accessdate=May 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buffalonews.com/incoming/article134934.ece|title=The day the music died - News - The Buffalo News|date=June 10, 2011|publisher=|accessdate=May 24, 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610220347/http://www.buffalonews.com/incoming/article134934.ece|archivedate=June 10, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1908 [[U.S. Supreme Court]] copyright case noted that, in 1902 alone, there were between 70,000 and 75,000 player pianos manufactured, and between 1,000,000 and 1,500,000 piano rolls produced.&lt;ref&gt;''[[White-Smith Music Publishing Company v.

The first device that could record actual [[sound]]s as they passed through the air (but could not play them back—the purpose was only visual study) was the [[phonautograph]], patented in 1857 by Parisian inventor [[Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville]]. The earliest known recordings of the human voice are phonautograph recordings, called ''phonautograms'', made in 1857.&lt;ref name="firstsounds"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstsounds.org |title=First Sounds |website=FirstSounds.ORG |date=2008-03-27 |accessdate=2017-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; They consist of sheets of paper with sound-wave-modulated white lines created by a vibrating stylus that cut through a coating of soot as the paper was passed under it. An 1860 phonautogram of [[Au Clair de la Lune (song)|Au Clair de la Lune]], a French folk song, was played back as sound for the first time in 2008 by scanning it and using software to convert the undulating line, which graphically encoded the sound, into a corresponding digital audio file.&lt;ref name="firstsounds"/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT2008&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/27/arts/27soun.html|title=Researchers Play Tune Recorded Before Edison|author=Jody Rosen|date=March 27, 2008|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 30, 1877, French poet, humorous writer and inventor [[Charles Cros]] submitted a sealed envelope containing a letter to the [[Academy of Sciences]] in Paris fully explaining his proposed method, called the paleophone.&lt;ref name="RBNF"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.cairn.info/zen.php?ID_ARTICLE=RBNF_033_0020 |title=L'impression du son |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928231926/http://www.cairn.info/zen.php?ID_ARTICLE=RBNF_033_0020 |archive-date=2015-09-28 |work=Revue de la BNF |date=2009 |publisher=Bibliothèque nationale de France |isbn=9782717724301 |issue=33 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though no trace of a working paleophone was ever found, Cros is remembered{{by whom|date=October 2018}} as the earliest inventor of a sound recording and reproduction machine.{{cn|reason=Per [[Paleophone]], it appears the reason no machine was ever found was that none was ever built. We need a [[WP:SECONDARY]] source to backup the significance of Cros's invention.|date=October 2018}}

The first practical sound recording and reproduction device was the mechanical [[phonograph cylinder]], invented by [[Thomas Edison]] in 1877 and patented in 1878.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patimg1.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=00200521&amp;idkey=NONE|title=Patent Images|website=patimg1.uspto.gov|accessdate=May 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.loc.gov/collections/edison-company-motion-pictures-and-sound-recordings/articles-and-essays/history-of-edison-sound-recordings/history-of-the-cylinder-phonograph/ |title=History of the Cylinder Phonograph |publisher=Library of Congress |access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The invention soon spread across the globe and over the next two decades the commercial recording, distribution, and sale of sound recordings became a growing new international industry, with the most popular titles selling millions of units by the early 1900s.{{cn|date=November 2018}} The development of mass-production techniques enabled cylinder recordings to become a major new consumer item in industrial countries and the cylinder was the main consumer format from the late 1880s until around 1910.&lt;!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]--&gt;

===Disc phonograph===
[[File:Alexander Graham Bell's Voice.ogg|thumb|Recording of Bell's voice on a wax disc in 1885, identified in 2013 [[Volta Laboratory and Bureau#Bell's voice|[more details]]] ]]
[[File:Emile Berliner with phonograph.jpg|thumb|Emile Berliner with disc record gramophone]]
The next major technical development was the invention of the [[gramophone record]], generally credited to [[Emile Berliner]] and commercially introduced in the United States in 1889, though others had demonstrated similar disk apparatus earlier, most notably [[Alexander Graham Bell]] in 1881.&lt;ref name=smiths1&gt;{{cite web|title=Early Sound Recording Collection and Sound Recovery Project|url=http://newsdesk.si.edu/factsheets/early-sound-recording-collection-and-sound-recovery-project|work=Smithsonian|publisher=Smithsonian|accessdate=April 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{fv|reason=Does not support 1889 or credit Berliner as first|date=July 2018}} Discs were easier to manufacture, transport and store, and they had the additional benefit of being louder (marginally) than cylinders, which by necessity, were single-sided. Sales of the [[gramophone record]] overtook the cylinder ca. 1910, and by the end of World War I the disc had become the dominant commercial recording format. Edison, who was the main producer of cylinders, created the [[Edison Disc Record]] in an attempt to regain his market. In various permutations, the audio disc format became the primary medium for consumer sound recordings until the end of the 20th century, and the double-sided 78 rpm shellac disc was the standard consumer music format from the early 1910s to the late 1950s.

Although there was no universally accepted speed, and various companies offered discs that played at several different speeds, the major recording companies eventually settled on a ''de facto'' industry standard of nominally 78 revolutions per minute, though the actual speed differed between America and the rest of the world. The specified speed was 78.26 rpm in America and 77.92 rpm throughout the rest of the world. The difference in speeds was due to the difference in the cycle frequencies of the AC electricity that powered the [[stroboscope]]s used to calibrate recording lathes and turntables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Copeland|first1=Peter|title=Manual of Analogue Audio Restoration Techniques|date=2008|publisher=The British Library|location=London|pages=89–90|url=http://www.bl.uk/britishlibrary/~/media/subjects%20images/sound/analoguesoundrestoration.pdf|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The nominal speed of the disc format gave rise to its common nickname, the "seventy-eight" (though not until other speeds had become available). Discs were made of shellac or similar brittle plastic-like materials, played with needles made from a variety of materials including mild steel, thorn, and even sapphire. Discs had a distinctly limited playing life that varied depending on how they were produced.

Earlier, purely acoustic methods of recording had limited sensitivity and frequency range.  Mid-frequency range notes could be recorded, but very low and very high frequencies could not. Instruments such as the violin were difficult to transfer to disc. One technique to deal with this involved using a Stroh violin to which was fitted a conical horn connected to a diaphragm that vibrated due to the violin bridge. &lt;!-- I have seen several photographs of performers with their violins at recording sessions, and none show a Stroh violin, which has a distinctive exponential horn.  There was an example, of a modified violin in the musical instruments gallery of the Deutshe Museum, Munich several years ago. --&gt; The horn was no longer needed once electrical recording was developed.

The long-playing 33{{frac|1|3}} rpm microgroove [[Gramophone record|vinyl]] record, or "[[LP record|LP]]", was developed at Columbia Records and introduced in 1948. The short-playing but convenient 7-inch 45 rpm microgroove vinyl [[Single (music)|single]] was introduced by [[RCA Victor]] in 1949. In the US and most developed countries, the two new vinyl formats completely replaced 78 rpm shellac discs by the end of the 1950s, but in some corners of the world, the "78" lingered on far into the 1960s. Vinyl was much more expensive than shellac, one of the several factors that made its use for 78 rpm records very unusual, but with a long-playing disc the added cost was acceptable and the compact "45" format required very little material. Vinyl offered improved performance, both in stamping and in playback. If played with a good diamond stylus mounted in a lightweight pickup on a well-adjusted tonearm, it was long-lasting. If protected from dust, scuffs and scratches there was very little noise. Vinyl records were, over-optimistically, advertised as "unbreakable". They were not, but they were much less fragile than shellac, which had itself once been touted as "unbreakable" compared to wax cylinders.

==Electrical recording==
[[File:Rca44.png|thumb|RCA-44, a classic [[ribbon microphone]] introduced in 1932. Similar units were widely used for recording and broadcasting in the 1940s and are occasionally still used today.]]

Between the invention of the phonograph in 1877 and the first commercial [[digital recording]]s in the early 1970s, arguably the most important milestone in the history of sound recording was the introduction of what was then called ''electrical recording'', in which a [[microphone]] was used to convert the sound into an electrical signal that was amplified and used to actuate the recording stylus. This innovation eliminated the "horn sound" resonances characteristic of the acoustical process, produced clearer and more full-bodied recordings by greatly extending the useful range of audio frequencies, and allowed previously unrecordable distant and feeble sounds to be captured.

Sound recording began as a purely mechanical process. Except for a few crude telephone-based recording devices with no means of amplification, such as the [[Telegraphone]],&lt;ref&gt;The earliest known surviving electrical recording was made on a [[Telegraphone]] magnetic recorder at the 1900 Exposition Universelle in Paris. It includes brief comments by Emperor Franz Joseph and the audio quality, ignoring dropouts and some noise of later origin, is comparable to that of a contemporary telephone.&lt;/ref&gt; it remained so until the 1920s when several radio-related developments in [[electronics]] converged to revolutionize the recording process. These included improved microphones and auxiliary devices such as electronic filters, all dependent on electronic [[Amplifier|amplification]] to be of practical use in recording. In 1906, [[Lee De Forest]] invented the [[Audion]] [[triode]] vacuum tube, an electronic valve that could amplify weak electrical signals. By 1915, it was in use in long-distance telephone circuits that made conversations between New York and San Francisco practical. Refined versions of this tube were the basis of all electronic sound systems until the commercial introduction of the first [[transistor]]-based audio devices in the mid-1950s.

During World War I, engineers in the United States and Great Britain worked on ways to record and reproduce, among other things, the sound of a [[German U-boat]] for training purposes. Acoustical recording methods of the time could not reproduce the sounds accurately. The earliest results were not promising.

The first electrical recording issued to the public, with little fanfare, was of November 11, 1920 funeral services for [[The Unknown Warrior]] in [[Westminster Abbey]], London. The recording engineers used microphones of the type used in contemporary telephones. Four were discreetly set up in the abbey and wired to recording equipment in a vehicle outside. Although electronic amplification was used, the audio was weak and unclear. The procedure did, however, produce a recording that would otherwise not have been possible in those circumstances. For several years, this little-noted disc remained the only issued electrical recording.

Several record companies and independent inventors, notably [[Orlando R. Marsh|Orlando Marsh]], experimented with equipment and techniques for electrical recording in the early 1920s. Marsh's electrically recorded [[Autograph Records]] were already being sold to the public in 1924, a year before the first such offerings from the major record companies, but their overall sound quality was too low to demonstrate any obvious advantage over traditional acoustical methods. Marsh's microphone technique was idiosyncratic and his work had little if any impact on the systems being developed by others.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.mainspringpress.com/marsh_electric.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303230521/http://www.mainspringpress.com/marsh_electric.html |archive-date=2016-03-03 |title=When Did Marsh Laboratories Begin to Make Electrical Recordings? |author=Allan Sutton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Telephone industry giant [[Western Electric]] had research laboratories (merged with the [[American Telephone &amp; Telegraph|AT&amp;T]] engineering department in 1925 to form [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Laboratories]]) with material and human resources that no record company or independent inventor could match. They had the best microphone, a condenser type developed there in 1916 and greatly improved in 1922,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.coutant.org/ecwente.html |title=A brief summary of E. C. Wente's development of the condenser microphone and of the Western Electric sound recording project as a whole|journal=IEEE Transactions on Education|volume=35, No. 4|date=November 1992|accessdate=2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the best amplifiers and test equipment. They had already patented an electromechanical recorder in 1918, and in the early 1920s, they decided to intensively apply their hardware and expertise to developing two state-of-the-art systems for electronically recording and reproducing sound: one that employed conventional discs and another that recorded optically on motion picture film. Their engineers pioneered the use of mechanical analogs of electrical circuits and developed a superior "rubber line" recorder for cutting the groove into the wax master in the disc recording system.&lt;ref&gt;Maxfield, J. P. and H. C. Harrison. Methods of high-quality recording and reproduction of speech based on telephone research. ''Bell System Technical Journal,'' July 1926, 493&amp;ndash;523.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1924, such dramatic progress had been made that Western Electric arranged a demonstration for the two leading record companies, the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] and the [[Columbia Records|Columbia Phonograph Company]]. Both soon licensed the system and both made their earliest published electrical recordings in February 1925, but neither actually released them until several months later. To avoid making their existing catalogs instantly obsolete, the two long-time archrivals agreed privately not to publicize the new process until November 1925, by which time enough electrically recorded repertory would be available to meet the anticipated demand. During the next few years, the lesser record companies licensed or developed other electrical recording systems. By 1929 only the budget label [[Harmony Records|Harmony]] was still issuing new recordings made by the old acoustical process.

Comparison of some surviving Western Electric test recordings with early commercial releases indicates that the record companies "dumbed down" the frequency range of the system so the recordings would not overwhelm non-electronic playback equipment, which reproduced very low frequencies as an unpleasant rattle and rapidly wore out discs with strongly recorded high frequencies.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==Other recording formats==
In the 1920s, [[Phonofilm]] and other early motion picture sound systems employed [[sound-on-film|optical recording]] technology, in which the audio signal was graphically recorded on photographic film. The amplitude variations comprising the signal were used to modulate a light source which was imaged onto the moving film through a narrow slit, allowing the signal to be photographed as variations in the density or width of a "sound track". The [[movie projector|projector]] used a steady light and a [[photodetector|photoelectric cell]] to convert these variations back into an electrical signal, which was amplified and sent to [[loudspeaker]]s behind the screen. Ironically, the introduction of "[[sound film|talkies]]" was spearheaded by ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'' (1927), which used the [[Vitaphone]] [[sound-on-disc]] system rather than an optical soundtrack. Optical sound became the standard motion picture audio system throughout the world and remains so for theatrical release prints despite attempts in the 1950s to substitute magnetic soundtracks. Currently, all release prints on [[35 mm]] film include an analog optical soundtrack, usually stereo with [[Dolby SR]] noise reduction. In addition, an optically recorded digital soundtrack in Dolby Digital and/or Sony SDDS form is likely to be present. An optically recorded timecode is also commonly included to synchronise CDROMs that contain a DTS soundtrack.

This period also saw several other historic developments including the introduction of the first practical magnetic sound recording system, the [[Wire recorder|magnetic wire recorder]], which was based on the work of Danish inventor [[Valdemar Poulsen]]. Magnetic wire recorders were effective, but the sound quality was poor, so between the wars, they were primarily used for voice recording and marketed as business dictating machines. In 1924, a German engineer, Dr. Kurt Stille, developed the Poulsen wire recorder as a dictating machine. The following year, [[Ludwig Blattner]] began work that eventually produced the Blattnerphone,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orbem.co.uk/tapes/blattner.htm |title=The Blattnerphone |website=Orbem.co.uk |date=2010-01-10 |accessdate=2017-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; enhancing it to use steel tape instead of wire. The [[BBC]] started using Blattnerphones in 1930 to record radio programmes. In 1933, radio pioneer [[Guglielmo Marconi]]'s company purchased the rights to the Blattnerphone, and newly developed Marconi-Stille recorders were installed in the BBC's [[Maida Vale Studios]] in March 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orbem.co.uk/tapes/ms.htm |title=The Marconi-Stille Recorder - Page 1 |website=Orbem.co.uk |date=2008-02-20 |accessdate=2017-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tape used in Blattnerphones and Marconi-Stille recorders was the same material used to make razor blades, and not surprisingly the fearsome Marconi-Stille recorders were considered so dangerous that technicians had to operate them from another room for safety. Because of the high recording speeds required, they used enormous reels about one metre in diameter, and the thin tape frequently broke, sending jagged lengths of razor steel flying around the studio. The K1 [[Magnetophon]] was the first practical tape recorder, developed by AEG in Germany in 1935.

==Magnetic tape==
{{Main article|Tape recorder}}

[[File:Magnetic-tape-acetate-vs-polyester-backing.jpg|thumb|Magnetic audio tapes: acetate base (left) and polyester base (right)]]

An important field of invention during this period was the [[tape recorder]]. [[Magnetic tape]] recording uses an amplified electrical audio signal to generate analogous variations of the magnetic field produced by a [[tape head]], which impresses corresponding variations of magnetization on the moving tape. In playback mode, the signal path is reversed, the tape head acting as a miniature [[electric generator]] as the varyingly magnetized tape passes over it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gordon|first1=Mumma|title=Recording|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com.ezproxy2.library.arizona.edu/subscriber/article/grove/music/J371600?q=acetate+tape+recording&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=4&amp;_start=1#firsthit|website=Oxford Music Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original solid steel ribbon was replaced by a much more practical coated paper tape, but acetate soon replaced paper as the standard tape base. Acetate has fairly low tensile strength and if very thin it will snap easily, so it was in turn eventually superseded by polyester. This technology, the basis for almost all commercial recording from the 1950s to the 1980s, was developed in the 1930s by German audio engineers who also rediscovered the principle of [[AC Bias|AC biasing]] (first used in the 1920s for [[wire recorder]]s), which dramatically improved the frequency response of tape recordings. The technology was further improved just after World War II by American audio engineer [[John T. Mullin]] with backing from [[Bing Crosby]] Enterprises. Mullin's pioneering recorders were modifications of captured German recorders. In the late 1940s, the [[Ampex]] company produced the first tape recorders commercially available in the US.

[[File:Tdkc60cassette.jpg|thumb|A typical Compact Cassette]]

Magnetic tape brought about sweeping changes in both radio and the recording industry. Sound could be recorded, erased and re-recorded on the same tape many times, sounds could be duplicated from tape to tape with only minor loss of quality, and recordings could now be very precisely edited by physically cutting the tape and rejoining it.
Within a few years of the introduction of the first commercial tape recorder—the [[Ampex 200]] model, launched in 1948—American musician-inventor [[Les Paul]] had invented the first [[multitrack tape recorder]], ushering in another technical revolution in the recording industry. Tape made possible the first sound recordings totally created by electronic means, opening the way for the bold sonic experiments of the [[Musique Concrète]] school and avant garde composers like [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], which in turn led to the innovative pop music recordings of artists such as [[Frank Zappa]], [[The Beatles]], and [[The Beach Boys]].

The ease and accuracy of tape editing, as compared to the cumbersome disc-to-disc editing procedures previously in some limited use, together with tape's consistently high audio quality finally convinced radio networks to routinely prerecord their entertainment programming, most of which had formerly been broadcast live. Also, for the first time, broadcasters, regulators and other interested parties were able to undertake comprehensive audio logging of each day's radio broadcasts. Innovations like multitracking and [[Delay (audio effect)|tape echo]] allowed radio programs and advertisements to be produced to a high level of complexity and sophistication. The combined impact with innovations such as the endless loop [[broadcast cartridge]] led to significant changes in the pacing and production style of radio program content and advertising.

==Stereo and hi-fi==
{{See also|Stereophonic sound|High fidelity}}

In 1881, it was noted during experiments in transmitting sound from the Paris Opera that it was possible to follow the movement of singers on the stage if earpieces connected to different microphones were held to the two ears.  This discovery was commercialized in 1890 with the [[Théâtrophone]] system, which operated for over forty years until 1932. In 1931, [[Alan Blumlein]], a British electronics engineer working for [[EMI]], designed a way to make the sound of an actor in a film follow his movement across the screen. In December 1931, he submitted a patent including the idea, and in 1933 this became UK patent number 394,325.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next two years, Blumlein developed stereo microphones and a stereo disc-cutting head, and recorded a number of short films with stereo soundtracks.

In the 1930s, experiments with magnetic tape enabled the development of the first practical commercial sound systems that could record and reproduce high-fidelity [[stereophonic sound]]. The experiments with stereo during the 1930s and 1940s were hampered by problems with synchronization. A major breakthrough in practical stereo sound was made by [[Bell Laboratories]], who in 1937 demonstrated a practical system of two-channel stereo, using dual optical sound tracks on film. Major movie studios quickly developed three-track and four-track sound systems, and the first stereo sound recording for a commercial film was made by [[Judy Garland]] for the [[MGM]] movie ''[[Listen, Darling]]'' in 1938. The first commercially released movie with a stereo soundtrack was Walt Disney's ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'', released in 1940.  The 1941 release of Fantasia used the "[[Fantasound]]" sound system. This system used a separate film for the sound, synchronized with the film carrying the picture. The sound film had four double-width optical soundtracks, three for left, center, and right audio—and a fourth as a "control" track with three recorded tones that controlled the playback volume of the three audio channels. Because of the complex equipment this system required, Disney exhibited the movie as a roadshow, and only in the United States.  Regular releases of the movie used standard mono optical 35&amp;nbsp;mm stock until 1956, when Disney released the film with a stereo soundtrack that used the "[[Cinemascope]]" four-track magnetic sound system.

German audio engineers working on magnetic tape developed stereo recording by 1941, even though a 2-track push-pull monaural technique existed in 1939. Of 250 stereophonic recordings made during WW2, only three survive: Beethoven's 5th Piano Concerto with Walter Gieseking and Arthur Rother, a Brahms Serenade, and the last movement of Bruckner's 8th Symphony with Von Karajan. The [[Audio Engineering Society]] has issued all these recordings on [[compact disk|CD]]. ([[Varèse Sarabande]] had released the Beethoven Concerto on LP, and it has been reissued on CD several times since).  Other early German stereophonic tapes are believed to have been destroyed in bombings. Not until [[Ampex]] introduced the first commercial two-track tape recorders in the late 1940s did stereo tape recording become commercially feasible. However, despite the availability of multitrack tape, stereo did not become the standard system for commercial music recording for some years, and remained a specialist market during the 1950s. EMI (UK) was the first company to release commercial stereophonic tapes. They issued their first ''Stereosonic'' tape in 1954. Others quickly followed, under the His Master's Voice and Columbia labels.  161 Stereosonic tapes were released, mostly classical music or lyric recordings. RCA imported these tapes into the USA.

Two-track stereophonic tapes were more successful in America during the second half of the 1950s.  They were duplicated at real time (1:1) or at twice the normal speed (2:1) when later 4-track tapes were often duplicated at up to 16 times the normal speed, providing a lower sound quality in many cases.  Early American 2-track stereophonic tapes were very expensive.  A typical example is the price list of the Sonotape/Westminster reels:  $6.95, $11.95 and $17.95 for the 7000, 9000 and 8000 series respectively.  Some HMV tapes released in the USA also cost up to $15. The history of stereo recording changed after the late 1957 introduction of the ''Westrex stereo phonograph disc'', which used the groove format developed earlier by Blumlein. [[Decca Records]] in England came out with [[FFRR technique|FFRR]] (Full Frequency Range Recording) in the 1940s, which became internationally accepted as a worldwide standard for higher quality recording on vinyl records. The [[Ernest Ansermet]] recording of [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s [[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]] was key in the development of full frequency range records and alerting the listening public to high fidelity in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vinylrecordscollector.co.uk/text/vinylhist14a.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020621034232/http://www.vinylrecordscollector.co.uk/text/vinylhist14a.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2002-06-21 |title=Decca's (ffrr) Frequency Series - History Of Vinyl 1 |website=Vinylrecordscollector.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Record companies mixed most popular music singles into monophonic sound until the mid-1960s—then commonly released major recordings in both mono and stereo until the early 1970s. Many 1960s pop albums available only in stereo in the 2000s were originally released only in mono, and record companies produced the "stereo" versions of these albums by simply separating the two tracks of the master tape, creating "pseudo stereo". In the mid Sixties, as stereo became more popular, many mono recordings (such as The Beach Boys' ''[[Pet Sounds]]'') were remastered using the so-called "[[Stereophonic sound#Pseudo-stereo|fake stereo]]" method, which spread the sound across the stereo field by directing higher-frequency sound into one channel and lower-frequency sounds into the other.

==1950s to 1980s==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2008}}

Magnetic tape transformed the recording industry. By the early 1950s, most commercial recordings were mastered on tape instead of recorded directly to disc. Tape facilitated a degree of manipulation in the recording process that was impractical with mixes and multiple generations of directly recorded discs. An early example is [[Les Paul]]'s 1951 recording of ''[[How High the Moon]]'', on which Paul played eight overdubbed guitar tracks. In the 1960s [[Brian Wilson]] of [[The Beach Boys]], [[Frank Zappa]], and [[The Beatles]] (with producer [[George Martin]]) were among the first popular artists to explore the possibilities of [[multitrack recording]] techniques and effects on their landmark albums ''[[Pet Sounds]]'', ''[[Freak Out!]]'', and ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''.

The next important innovation was small cartridge-based tape systems, of which the [[compact cassette]], commercialized by the [[Philips]] electronics company in 1964, is the best known. Initially a low-fidelity format for spoken-word voice recording and inadequate for music reproduction, after a series of improvements it entirely replaced the competing formats: the larger [[8-track tape]] (used primarily in cars) and the fairly similar "Deutsche Cassette" developed by the German company Grundig. This latter system was not particularly common in Europe and practically unheard-of in America. The compact cassette became a major consumer audio format and advances in electronic and mechanical miniaturization led to the development of the [[Sony]] [[Walkman]], a pocket-sized cassette player introduced in 1979. The Walkman was the first personal music player and it gave a major boost to sales of prerecorded cassettes, which became the first widely successful release format that used a re-recordable medium: the vinyl&lt;!-- avoids BE/AE differences --&gt; record was a playback-only medium and commercially prerecorded tapes for [[reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel tape decks]], which many consumers found difficult to operate, were never more than an uncommon niche market item.

A key advance in audio fidelity came with the [[Dolby A]] noise reduction system, invented by [[Ray Dolby]] and introduced into professional recording studios in 1966. It suppressed the light but sometimes quite noticeable steady background of hiss, which was the only easily audible downside of mastering on tape instead of recording directly to disc. A competing system, [[dbx (noise reduction)|dbx]], invented by David Blackmer, also found success in professional audio. A simpler variant of Dolby's noise reduction system, known as Dolby B, greatly improved the sound of cassette tape recordings by reducing the especially high level of hiss that resulted from the cassette's miniaturized tape format. It, and variants, also eventually found wide application in the recording and film industries. Dolby B was crucial to the popularization&lt;!-- AE appears to be the established variant in this article --&gt; and commercial success of the cassette as a domestic recording and playback medium, and it became a standard feature in the booming home and car stereo market of the 1970s and beyond. The compact cassette format also benefited enormously from improvements to the tape itself as coatings with wider frequency responses and lower inherent noise were developed, often based on cobalt and chrome oxides as the magnetic material instead of the more usual iron oxide.

The multitrack audio cartridge had been in wide use in the radio industry, from the late 1950s to the 1980s, but in the 1960s the pre-recorded [[8-track cartridge]] was launched as a consumer audio format by [[Bill Lear]] of the Lear Jet aircraft company (and although its correct name was the 'Lear Jet Cartridge', it was seldom referred to as such). Aimed particularly at the automotive market, they were the first practical, affordable car hi-fi systems, and could produce sound quality superior to that of the compact cassette. However the smaller size and greater durability &amp;mdash; augmented by the ability to create home-recorded music "compilations" since 8-track recorders were rare &amp;mdash; saw the cassette become the dominant consumer format for portable audio devices in the 1970s and 1980s.

There had been experiments with multi-channel sound for many years &amp;mdash; usually for special musical or cultural events &amp;mdash; but the first commercial application of the concept came in the early 1970s with the introduction of [[Quadraphonic]] sound. This spin-off development from multitrack recording used four tracks (instead of the two used in stereo) and four speakers to create a 360-degree audio field around the listener. Following the release of the first consumer 4-channel [[hi-fi]] systems, a number of popular albums were released in one of the competing four-channel formats; among the best known are [[Mike Oldfield]]'s ''[[Tubular Bells]]'' and [[Pink Floyd]]'s ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]''. Quadraphonic sound was not a commercial success, partly because of competing and somewhat incompatible four-channel sound systems (e.g., [[CBS]], [[JVC]], [[Dynaco]] and others all had systems) and generally poor quality, even when played as intended on the correct equipment, of the released music. It eventually faded out in the late 1970s, although this early venture paved the way for the eventual introduction of domestic [[Surround Sound]] systems in home theatre use, which have gained enormous popularity since the introduction of the DVD. This widespread adoption has occurred despite the confusion introduced by the multitude of available surround sound standards.

==Audio components==
{{main article|High fidelity#Modularity}}
The replacement of the relatively fragile thermionic valve ([[vacuum tube]]) by the smaller, lighter-weight, cooler-running, less expensive, more robust, and less power-hungry [[transistor]] also accelerated the sale of consumer high-fidelity "[[hi-fi]]" sound systems from the 1960s onward. In the 1950s, most record players were monophonic and had relatively low sound quality. Few consumers could afford high-quality stereophonic sound systems. In the 1960s, American manufacturers introduced a new generation of "modular" hi-fi components &amp;mdash; separate turntables, pre-amplifiers, amplifiers, both combined as integrated amplifiers, tape recorders, and other ancillary equipment like the [[graphic equaliser]], which could be connected together to create a complete home sound system. These developments were rapidly taken up by major Japanese electronics companies, which soon flooded the world market with relatively affordable, high-quality transistorized audio components. By the 1980s, corporations like [[Sony]] had become world leaders in the music recording and playback industry.

The advent of [[digital recording|digital sound recording]] and later the [[compact disc]] (CD) in 1982 brought significant improvements in the durability of consumer recordings. The CD initiated another massive wave of change in the consumer music industry, with [[Gramophone record|vinyl records]] effectively relegated to a small niche market by the mid-1990s. However, the record industry fiercely resisted the introduction of digital systems, fearing wholesale piracy on a medium able to produce perfect copies of original released recordings. However, the industry succumbed to the inevitable, though using various protection system (principally [[Serial Copy Management System]], or SCMS).

The most recent and revolutionary developments have been in digital recording, with the development of various uncompressed and compressed digital [[audio file format]]s, [[Microprocessor|processors]] capable and fast enough to convert the digital data to sound in [[Real-time computing|real time]], and inexpensive [[mass storage]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |journal=Journal of the Audio Engineering Society

. This generated new types of [[portable digital audio player]]s. The [[minidisc]] player, using [[ATRAC]] compression on small, cheap, re-writeable discs was introduced in the 1990s but became obsolescent as solid-state non-volatile [[flash memory]] dropped in price. As technologies that increase the amount of data that can be stored on a single medium, such as [[Super Audio CD]], [[DVD-A]], [[Blu-ray Disc]], and [[HD DVD]] become available, longer programs of higher quality fit onto a single disc. Sound files are readily [[download]]ed from the Internet and other sources, and copied onto computers and digital audio players. Digital audio technology is now used in all areas of audio, from casual use of music files of moderate quality to the most demanding professional applications. New applications such as [[internet radio]] and [[podcasting]] have appeared.

Technological developments in recording, editing, and consuming have transformed the [[record industry|record]], [[film industry|movie]] and [[television]] industries in recent decades. [[audio engineering|Audio editing]] became practicable with the invention of [[magnetic tape recording]], but digital audio and cheap [[mass storage]] allows computers to edit audio files quickly, easily, and cheaply. Today, the process of making a recording is separated into tracking, [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]] and [[Audio mastering|mastering]]. [[Multitrack recording]] makes it possible to capture signals from several microphones, or from different [[take]]s to tape, disc or mass storage, with maximized [[headroom (audio signal processing)|headroom]] and quality, allowing previously unavailable flexibility in the mixing and mastering stages.

===Software===
There are many different digital audio recording and processing programs running under several computer [[operating system]]s for all purposes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=INSTALLATION|url=http://www.waaudiovisual.com.au/service_details.php?id=12|publisher=Waaudiovisual.com.au|accessdate=January 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ranging from casual users (e.g., a [[small business]] person recording her "to-do" list on an inexpensive digital recorder) to serious amateurs (an unsigned "indie" band recording their demo on a laptop) to professional [[sound engineer]]s who are recording albums, film scores and doing sound design for [[video games]]. A comprehensive list of digital recording applications is available at the [[digital audio workstation]] article. [[Digital dictation]] software for recording and transcribing speech has different requirements; intelligibility and flexible playback facilities are priorities, while a wide frequency range and high audio quality are not.

{{Unreferenced|section|date=April 2017}}
The development of analog sound recording in the nineteenth century and its widespread use throughout the twentieth century had a huge impact on the development of music. Before analog sound recording was invented, most music was listened to by hearing a live performance, or by singing or playing a song or piece. Throughout the [[Medieval music|medieval]], [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]], [[Baroque music|Baroque]], [[Classical music (period)|Classical]], and through much of the [[Romantic music era]], the main way that songs and instrumental pieces were "recorded" was by notating the piece in [[music notation]]. While music notation indicates the pitches of the melody and their rhythm, the notation is not like a 2010-era sound recording. Indeed, in the Medieval era, [[Gregorian chant]] did not indicate the rhythm of the chant. In the Baroque era, instrumental pieces often lack a tempo indication and usually none of the ornaments were written down. As a result, each performance of a song or piece would be slightly different. 

With the development of analog sound recording, though, a performance could be permanently fixed, in all of its elements: pitch, rhythm, timbre, ornaments and expression. This meant that many more elements of a performance would be captured and disseminated to other listeners. The development of sound recording also enabled a much larger proportion of people to hear famous orchestras, operas, singers and bands, because even if a non-wealthy person could not afford to hear the live concert, she or he might be able to afford to buy the recording. The availability of sound recording thus helped to spread musical styles to new regions, countries and continents. The cultural influence went in a number of directions. Sound recordings enabled Western music lovers to hear actual recordings of Asian, Middle Eastern and African groups and performers, increasing awareness of non-Western musical styles. At the same time, sound recordings enabled non-Western music lovers to hear the most famous North American and European groups and singers.

==Legal status==

In copyright law, a "phonogram" or "sound recording" is a work that results from the fixation of sounds in a medium. The notice of copyright in a phonogram uses the [[sound recording copyright symbol]], which the [[Geneva Phonograms Convention]] defines as ℗ (the letter P in a full circle). This usually accompanies the copyright notice for the underlying musical composition, which uses the ordinary © symbol.

=== US ===

United States copyright law defines "sound recordings" as "works that result from the fixation of a series of musical, spoken, or other sounds" other than an audiovisual work's soundtrack.&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. §101&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the Sound Recording Amendment (SRA),&lt;ref&gt;Pub. L. No. 92-140, § 3, 85 Stat. 391, 392 (1971)&lt;/ref&gt; which took effect in 1972, copyright in sound recordings was handled at the level of the several states. Federal copyright law preempts most state copyright laws but allows state copyright in sound recordings to continue for one full copyright term after the SRA's effective date,&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. §301(c)&lt;/ref&gt; which means 2067.

=== UK ===

Since 1934, copyright law in Great Britain has treated sound recordings (or ''phonograms'') differently from [[musical work]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''Gramaphone Company v. Stephen Cawardine''&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]]'' defines a sound recording as (a) a recording of sounds, from which the sounds may be reproduced, or (b) a recording of the whole or any part of a literary, dramatic or musical work, from which sounds reproducing the work or part may be produced, regardless of the medium on which the recording is made or the method by which the sounds are reproduced or produced. It thus covers vinyl records, tapes, [[compact disc]]s, digital audiotapes, and MP3s that embody recordings.

[[Image:Kronobageriet Stockholm Sibylle Riddar 20060524.jpg|thumb|Stockholm Music Museum]]
'''The Stockholm Music Museum''' was founded in 1899 (then named ”Musikhistoriska museet”), inspired by an exhibition of theatre and music which was part of the great [[Stockholm]] art and industry exhibition of 1897. Via donations and appeals for gifts around 200 [[musical instrument]]s and an amount of archive material concerning the history of music and theatre were gathered. The new museum was opened to the general public in 1901. In 1932 the museum, in the form of a trust, was associated with the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Music]] and received a state grant. The state became increasingly responsible for the museum, which in 1981 became part of a new public body–The Swedish National Collections of Music. At the same time the museum was renamed The Stockholm Music Museum (Musikmuseet), since its activities had broadened and changed in character.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musikmuseet.se/ommuseet/index.php?l=en&amp;mmcss=&amp;oid=2&amp;niv=2&amp;ommu_open=1 Musikmuseet&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The present collection encompasses approximately 5,500 instruments with an emphasis on [[Western art music]], and [[Nordic folk music|Scandinavian folk music]] instruments. 

Since 1979 the Stockholm Music Museum is located in the splendid former Crown Bakery, in the same quarter as the Court Stables, beside the [[Royal Dramatic Theatre]], in central Stockholm. The Crown Bakery dates from the 17th century, and is Stockholm’s oldest industrial building.

[[Image:Konsertsal, Musik- och teatermuseet, Stockholm.JPG|thumb|upright|Concert Hall]]
This building has a long and eventful history and has through the centuries performed a number of functions: bakery, weapon depot, spirits store. Yet almost all the time—from the 1640s to 1958—it has been a bakery for the armed forces in Stockholm. It even boasted mobile ovens which could be used during field exercises. In 1945 the building was ravaged by a fire which destroyed its upper floors in the northern part–where the Concert Hall is now located.

A large portion of the museum's instrument collection is viewable on the museum's webpage, and will from 2010 onwards, be available through the EU's europeana culture webportal: www.europeana.eu

[[File:Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.jpg|right|thumb|''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon'' (1907), also by Picasso in a different style ("[[Picasso's African Period]]") four years later.]]In the [[visual arts]], '''style''' is a "...distinctive manner which permits the grouping of works into related categories"&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Fernie|Fernie, Eric]]. ''Art History and its Methods: A critical anthology''. London: Phaidon, 1995, p. 361. {{ISBN|978-0-7148-2991-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "...any distinctive, and therefore recognizable, way in which an act is performed or an artifact made or ought to be performed and made".&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, 150&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to the visual appearance of a work of art that relates it to other works by the same artist or one from the same period, training, location, "school", [[art movement]] or [[archaeological culture]]: "The notion of style has long been the art historian's principal mode of classifying works of art. By style he selects and shapes the history of art".&lt;ref&gt;[[George Kubler]] summarizing the view of [[Meyer Schapiro]] (with whom he disagrees), quoted by Alpers in Lang, 138&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Style is often divided into the general style of a period, country or cultural group, group of artists or [[art movement]], and the individual style of the artist within that group style. Divisions within both types of styles are often made, such as between "early", "middle" or "late".&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, s. 1&lt;/ref&gt; In some artists, such as [[Picasso]] for example, these divisions may be marked and easy to see, in others they are more subtle.  Style is seen as usually dynamic, in most periods always changing by a gradual process, though the speed of this varies greatly, between the very slow development in style typical of [[prehistoric art]] or [[Ancient Egyptian art]] to the rapid changes in [[Modern art]] styles. Style often develops in a series of jumps, with relatively sudden changes followed by periods of slower development.

After dominating academic discussion in [[art history]] in the 19th and early 20th centuries, so-called "style art history" has come under increasing attack in recent decades, and many art historians now prefer to avoid stylistic classifications where they can.&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, s. 2; Kubler in Lang, 163–164; Alpers in Lang, 137–138; 161&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Any piece of art is in theory capable of being analysed in terms of style; neither periods nor artists can avoid having a style, except by complete incompetence,&lt;ref&gt;[[George Kubler]] goes further "No human acts escape style", Kubler in Lang, 167; II, 3 in his list; Elkins, s. 2&lt;/ref&gt; and conversely natural objects or sights cannot be said to have a style, as style only results from choices made by a maker.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, 177–178&lt;/ref&gt;  Whether the artist makes a conscious choice of style, or can identify his own style, hardly matters.  Artists in recent developed societies tend to be highly conscious of their own style, arguably over-conscious, whereas for earlier artists stylistic choices were probably "largely unselfconscious".&lt;ref&gt;Elsner, 106–107, 107 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

Most stylistic periods are identified and defined later by art historians, but artists may choose to define and name their own style. The names of most older styles are the invention of art historians and would not have been understood by the practitioners of those styles. Some originated as terms of derision, including [[Gothic style|Gothic]], [[Baroque]], and [[Rococo]].&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, 131; Honour &amp; Fleming, 13–14; Elkins, s. 2&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Cubism]] on the other hand was a conscious identification made by a few artists; the word itself seems to have originated with critics rather than painters, but was rapidly accepted by the artists.

Western art, like that of some other cultures, most notably [[Chinese art]], has a marked tendency to revive at intervals "classic" styles from the past.&lt;ref&gt;Honour &amp; Fleming, 13&lt;/ref&gt;  In critical analysis of the visual arts, the style of a work of art is typically treated as distinct from its [[iconography]], which covers the subject and the ''content'' of the work, though for [[Jas Elsner]] this distinction is "not, of course, true in any actual example; but it has proved rhetorically extremely useful".&lt;ref&gt;Elsner, 107–108, 108 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the concept==
[[File:Ivory Egypt Louvre OA2753.jpg|thumb|left|14th-century [[Islamic art|Islamic]] ornament in ivory, centred on a [[palmette]]; [[Alois Riegl]]'s ''[[Stilfragen]]'' (1893) traced the evolution and transmission of such motifs.]]
Classical art criticism and the relatively few medieval writings on [[aesthetics]] did not greatly develop a concept of style in art, or analysis of it,&lt;ref&gt;classical authors did leave a considerable and subtle body of analysis of style in literature, especially [[rhetoric]]; see Gombrich, 130–131&lt;/ref&gt; and though Renaissance and Baroque writers on art are greatly concerned with what we would call style, they did not develop a coherent theory of it, at least outside architecture. [[Giorgio Vasari]] set out a hugely influential but much-questioned account of the development of style in Italian painting (mainly) from [[Giotto]] to his own [[Mannerist]] period.  He stressed the development of a [[Florence|Florentine]] style based on ''disegno'' or line-based drawing, rather than [[Venice|Venetian]] colour.  With other Renaissance theorists like [[Leon Battista Alberti]] he continued classical debates over the best balance in art between the [[Realism (visual arts)|realistic]] depiction of nature and idealization of it; this debate was to continue until the 19th century and the advent of [[Modernism]].&lt;ref&gt;See Blunt throughout, with in particular pp. 14–22 on Alberti, 28–34 on Leonardo, 61–64 on Michelangelo, 89–95 and 98–100 on Vasari&lt;/ref&gt;

The theorist of [[Neoclassicism]], [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]], analysed the stylistic changes in Greek classical art in 1764, comparing them closely to the changes in [[Renaissance art]], and "[[Georg Hegel]] codified the notion that each historical period will have a typical style", casting a very long shadow over the study of style.&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, s. 2; Preziosi, 115–117; Gombrich, 136&lt;/ref&gt;  Hegel is often attributed with the invention of the [[German language|German]] word ''[[Zeitgeist]]'', but he never actually used the word, although in ''[[Lectures on the Philosophy of History]]'', he uses the phrase ''der Geist seiner Zeit'' (the spirit of his time), writing "no man can surpass his own time, for the spirit of his time is also his own spirit."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=khvwPJMzNzMC&amp;pg=PA262 |page=262 |title=The Hegel Dictionary |author=Glenn Alexander Magee |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |year=2011 |isbn=9781847065919 |chapter=Zeitgeist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Constructing schemes of the period styles of historic art and architecture was a major concern of 19th-century scholars in the new and initially mostly German-speaking field of [[art history]], with important writers on the broad theory of style including [[Carl Friedrich von Rumohr]], [[Gottfried Semper]], and [[Alois Riegl]] in his ''[[Stilfragen]]'' of 1893, with [[Heinrich Wölfflin]] and [[Paul Frankl]] continuing the debate in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, s. 2, 3; Rawson, 24&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Jacobsthal]] and [[Josef Strzygowski]] are among the art historians who followed Riegl in proposing grand schemes tracing the transmission of elements of styles across great ranges in time and space. This type of art history is also known as [[Formalism (art)|formalism]], or the study of forms or shapes in art.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Semper, Wölfflin, and Frankl, and later Ackerman, had backgrounds in the history of architecture, and like many other terms for period styles, "Romanesque" and "Gothic" were initially coined to describe [[architectural style]]s, where major changes between styles can be clearer and more easy to define, not least because style in architecture is easier to replicate by following a set of rules than style in figurative art such as painting.  Terms originated to describe architectural periods were often subsequently applied to other areas of the visual arts, and then more widely still to music, literature and the general culture.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, 129; Elsner, 104&lt;/ref&gt;

In architecture stylistic change often follows, and is made possible by, the discovery of new techniques or materials, from the Gothic [[rib vault]] to modern metal and [[reinforced concrete]] construction.  A major area of debate in both art history and archaeology has been the extent to which stylistic change in other fields like painting or pottery is also a response to new technical possibilities, or has its own impetus to develop (the ''kunstwollen'' of Riegl), or changes in response to social and economic factors affecting patronage and the conditions of the artist, as current thinking tends to emphasize, using less rigid versions of [[Marxist]] art history.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, 131–136; Elkins, s. 2; Rawson, 24–25&lt;/ref&gt;

Although style was well-established as a central component of art historical analysis, seeing it as the over-riding factor in art history had fallen out of fashion by World War II, as other ways of looking at art were developing,&lt;ref&gt;Kubler in Lang, 163&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a reaction against the emphasis on style; for [[Svetlana Alpers]], "the normal invocation of style in art history is a depressing affair indeed".&lt;ref&gt;Alpers in Lang, 137&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[James Elkins (art historian)|James Elkins]] "In the later 20th century criticisms of style were aimed at further reducing the Hegelian elements of the concept while retaining it in a form that could be more easily controlled".&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, s. 2 (quoted); see also Gombrich, 135–136&lt;/ref&gt; [[Meyer Schapiro]], [[James S. Ackerman|James Ackerman]], [[Ernst Gombrich]] and [[George Kubler]] (''[[The Shape of Time: Remarks on the History of Things]]'', 1962) have made notable contributions to the debate, which has also drawn on wider developments in [[critical theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, s. 2; analysed by Kubler in Lang, 164–165&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 [[Jas Elsner]] put it more strongly: "For nearly the whole of the 20th century, style art history has been the indisputable king of the discipline, but since the revolutions of the seventies and eighties the king has been dead",&lt;ref&gt;Elsner, 98&lt;/ref&gt; though his article explores ways in which "style art history" remains alive, and his comment would hardly be applicable to archaeology.

The use of terms such as [[Counter-Maniera|Counter-''Maniera'']] appears to be in decline, as impatience with such "style labels" grows among art historians.  In 2000 Marcia B. Hall, a leading art historian of 16th-century Italian painting and mentee of [[Sydney Joseph Freedberg]] (1914–1997), who invented the term, was criticised by a reviewer of her ''After Raphael: Painting in Central Italy in the Sixteenth Century'' for her "fundamental flaw" in continuing to use this and other terms, despite an apologetic "Note on style labels" at the beginning of the book and a promise to keep their use to a minimum.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, 324&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Image:Georges Seurat, 1889-90 Chahut, Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo, Netherlands.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Georges Seurat]]'s very individual technique and style, ''[[Le Chahut]]'', 1889–90]]

A rare recent attempt to create a theory to explain the process driving changes in artistic style, rather than just theories of how to describe and categorize them, is by the [[behavioural psychologist]] [[Colin Martindale]], who has proposed an evolutionary theory based on [[Darwinian]] principles.&lt;ref&gt;Summarized in his article "Evolution of Ancient Art: Trends in the Style of Greek Vases and Egyptian Painting", ''Visual Arts Research'', Vol. 16, No. 1(31) (Spring 1990), pp. 31–47, University of Illinois Press, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20715715 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  However this cannot be said to have gained much support among art historians.

==Individual style==

Traditional art history has also placed great emphasis on the individual style of an artist: "the notion of personal style—that individuality can be uniquely expressed not only in the way an artist draws, but also in the stylistic quirks of an author's writing (for instance)— is perhaps an axiom of Western notions of identity".&lt;ref&gt;Elsner, 103&lt;/ref&gt;  The identification of individual styles is especially important in the attribution of works to artists, which is a dominant factor in their [[art valuation|valuation for the art market]], above all for works in the Western tradition since the Renaissance.  The identification of individual style in works is "essentially assigned to a group of specialists in the field known as [[Connoisseur|connoisseur]]s",&lt;ref&gt;Alpers in Lang, 139, a situation she sees as problematic&lt;/ref&gt; a group who centre in the art trade and museums, often with tensions between them and the community of academic art historians.&lt;ref&gt;Exemplified in grumbling by Grosvenor; Crane, 214–216&lt;/ref&gt;

The exercise of conoisseurship is largely a matter of subjective impressions that are hard to analyse, but also a matter of knowing details of technique and the "hand" of different artists. [[Giovanni Morelli]] (1816 – 1891) pioneered the systematic study of the scrutiny of diagnostic minor details that revealed artists' scarcely conscious shorthand and conventions for portraying, for example, ears or hands, in Western [[old master]] paintings.  His techniques were adopted by [[Bernard Berenson]] and others, and have been applied to sculpture and many other types of art, for example by Sir [[John Beazley]] to [[Pottery of ancient Greece|Attic vase painting]].&lt;ref&gt;Elsner, 103; [http://arthistorians.info/morellig ''Dictionary of Art Historians'': "Giovanni Morelli"]&lt;/ref&gt;  Personal techniques can be important in analysing individual style.  Though artists' training was before Modernism essentially imitative, relying on taught technical methods, whether learnt as an apprentice in a workshop or later as a student in an academy, there was always room for personal variation.  The idea of technical "secrets" closely guarded by the master who developed them, is a long-standing ''[[Literary topos|topos]]'' in art history from Vasari's probably mythical account of Jan van Eyck to the secretive habits of [[Georges Seurat]].&lt;ref&gt;Gotlieb, throughout; 469–475 on Vasari and van Eyck; 469 on Seurat.&lt;/ref&gt;   
[[File:Manner of rembrandt harmensz van rijn christ among the doctors d5343274h.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Painting of ''[[Christ among the Doctors]]'', catalogued by [[Christie's]] as "Manner of Rembrandt Harmensz van Rijn" and sold for £750 in 2010]]

However the idea of personal style is certainly not limited to the Western tradition. In [[Chinese art]] it is just as deeply held, but traditionally regarded as a factor in the appreciation of some types of art, above all [[Chinese calligraphy|calligraphy]] and [[literati painting]], but not others, such as Chinese porcelain;&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 92–102; 111–119&lt;/ref&gt; a distinction also often seen in the so-called [[decorative arts]] in the West. Chinese painting also allowed for the expression of political and social views by the artist a good deal earlier than is normally detected in the West.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 27&lt;/ref&gt;  Calligraphy, also regarded as a [[fine art]] [[Islamic calligraphy|in the Islamic world]] and [[East Asia]], brings a new area within the ambit of personal style; the ideal of Western calligraphy tends to be to suppress individual style, while [[graphology]], which relies upon it, regards itself as a science.

==Manner==
"Manner" is a related term, often used for what is in effect a sub-division of a style, perhaps focused on particular points of style or technique.&lt;ref&gt;"What Is Poetry?", "Petronius Arbiter"&lt;!-- pseudonym, not the Roman writer --&gt;, ''The Art World'', Vol. 3, No. 6 (Mar., 1918), pp. 506–511, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25588388 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; While many elements of period style can be reduced to characteristic forms or shapes, that can adequately be represented in simple line-drawn diagrams, "manner" is more often used to mean the overall style and atmosphere of a work, especially complex works such as paintings, that cannot so easily be subject to precise analysis. It is a somewhat outdated term in academic art history, avoided because it is imprecise.  When used it is often in the context of imitations of the individual style of an artist, and it is one of the hierarchy of discreet or diplomatic terms used in the [[art trade]] for the relationship between a work for sale and that of a well-known artist, with "Manner of [[Rembrandt]]" suggesting a distanced relationship between the style of the work and Rembrandt's own style.  The "Explanation of Cataloguing Practice" of the auctioneers [[Christie's]]' explains that "'''Manner of ...'''" in their auction catalogues means "In our opinion a work executed in the artist's style but of a later date".&lt;ref&gt;[http://christies.scene7.com/s7/brochure/flash_brochure.jsp?company=Christies&amp;sku=AMS3025_SaleCat&amp;config=Christies/eCat_210x267_Full&amp;locale=en&amp;image=Christies/AMS3025_SaleCat Christie's "Explanation of Cataloguing Practice" (after lot listings)]. "Style" is not used for paintings etc., but for European porcelain they give the example:"A plate in the Worcester style" means "In our opinion, a copy or imitation of pieces made in the named factory, place or region". For examples, [http://www.bonhams.com/auctions/19224/lot/37/ this painting, sold by Bonhams in 2011] as "Manner of Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn", is now attributed in their notes to "an anonymous eighteenth-century follower of Rembrandt". [http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/paintings/manner-of-rembrandt-harmensz-van-rijn-christ-5343274-details.aspx This example sold by Christie's] fetched only £750 in 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mannerism]], derived from the Italian ''maniera'' ("manner") is a specific phase of the general Renaissance style, but "manner" can be used very widely.

==Style in archaeology==
[[File:1911 Britannica-Archaeology-Palaeolithic.png|thumb|right|[[Paleolithic]] stone tools grouped by period]]

In [[archaeology]], despite modern techniques like [[radiocarbon dating]], period or cultural style remains a crucial tool in the identification and [[Dating methodologies in archaeology|dating]] not only of works of art but all classes of [[archaeological artefact]], including purely functional ones (ignoring the question of whether purely functional artefacts exist).&lt;ref&gt;See also Alpers in Lang, 140&lt;/ref&gt; The identification of individual styles of artists or [[artisan]]s has also been proposed in some cases even for remote periods such as the [[Ice Age art]] of the European [[Upper Paleolithic]].&lt;ref&gt;Bahn &amp; Vertut, 89&lt;/ref&gt;

As in art history, [[formal analysis]] of the [[morphology (archaeology)|morphology]] (shape) of individual artefacts is the starting point. This is used to construct [[Typology (archaeology)|typologies]] for different types of artefacts, and by the technique of [[Seriation (archaeology)|seriation]] a [[relative dating]] based on style for a site or group of sites is achieved where scientific [[absolute dating]] techniques cannot be used, in particular where only stone, ceramic or metal artefacts or remains are available, which is often the case.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thermoluminescence dating]] can be used for much ceramic material, and the developing method of [[Rehydroxylation dating]] may become widely used.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Sherd]]s of [[pottery]] are often very numerous in sites from many cultures and periods, and even small pieces may be confidently dated by their style. In contrast to recent trends in academic art history, the succession of schools of archaeological theory in the last century, from [[culture-historical archaeology]] to [[processual archaeology]] and finally the rise of [[post-processual archaeology]] in recent decades has not significantly reduced the importance of the study of style in archaeology, as a basis for classifying objects before further interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Review by Mary Ann Levine of ''The Uses of Style in Archaeology'', edited by [[Margaret Conkey]] and Christine Hastorf (see further reading), pp. 779–780, ''American Antiquity'', Vol. 58, No. 4 (Oct., 1993), Society for American Archaeology, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/282229 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stylization==
[[File:Uffington-White-Horse-sat.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of the very stylized prehistoric [[Uffington White Horse]] in England]]
'''Stylization''' and '''stylized''' (or "stylisation" and "stylised" in (non-Oxford) [[British English]], respectively) have a more specific meaning, referring to visual depictions that use simplified ways of representing objects or scenes that do not attempt a full, precise and accurate representation of their visual appearance (''[[mimesis]]'' or "[[Realism (arts)|realistic]]"), preferring an attractive or expressive overall depiction.  More technically, it has been defined as "the decorative generalization of figures and objects by means of various conventional techniques, including the simplification of line, form, and relationships of space and color",&lt;ref&gt;"Stylization" in the ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'', 1979, online at [http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Stylization The Free Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; and observed that "[s]tylized art reduces visual perception to constructs of pattern in line, surface elaboration and flattened space".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Willene B., ''A Medieval Book of Beasts: The Second-Family Bestiary, Commentary, Art, Text And Translation'', p. 54, 2006, Boydell Press, {{ISBN|0851156827}}, 9780851156828, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0olPRmCoE8MC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;dq=Stylization+in+art&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NFqIaLTG4F&amp;sig=p-PbpnBNfgUusEYLRigTrlC3Ebc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fJo4UeflKYetPP3YgIgK&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Stylization%20in%20art&amp;f=false google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient, traditional, and [[modern art]], as well as popular forms such as [[cartoon]]s or [[animation]] very often use stylized representations, so for example ''[[The Simpsons]]'' use highly stylized depictions, as does traditional [[African art]].  The two Picasso paintings illustrated at the top of this page show a movement to a more stylized representation of the human figure within the painter's style,&lt;ref&gt;See Elsner, 107 on Picasso as the paradigm of "the supremely self-conscious poseur in any style you like".&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Uffington White Horse]] is an example of a highly stylized prehistoric depiction of a horse.  Motifs in the [[decorative arts]] such as the [[palmette]] or [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]] are often highly stylized versions of the parts of plants.

Even in art that is in general attempting mimesis or "realism", a degree of stylization is very often found in details, and especially figures or other features at a small scale, such as people or trees etc. in the distant background even of a large work.  But this is not stylization intended to be noticed by the viewer, except on close examination.&lt;ref&gt;Holloway, John, ''The Slumber of Apollo: Reflections on Recent Art, Literature, Language and the Individual Consciousness'', p. 30, 1983, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0521248043}}, 9780521248044, [https://books.google.com/books?id=EuoILxxW9cQC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=Stylization+in+art&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qJw4UbeGIsS7PaHJgNAC&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Stylization%20in%20art&amp;f=false google books]&lt;/ref&gt; Drawings, ''[[modelli]]'', and other sketches not intended as finished works for sale will also very often stylize.

"Stylized" may mean the adoption of any style in any context, and in [[American English]] is often used for the [[typographic]] style of names, as in "[[AT&amp;T]] is also stylized as ATT and at&amp;t": this is a specific usage that seems to have escaped dictionaries, although it is a small extension of existing other senses of the word.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

'''TESST College of Technology''' is a private for-profit technical college located in metropolitan [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. It is owned and operated by Education Corporation of America.

==History==
TESST College of Technology began offering instruction in electronics in 1957 as TESST Technology Institute. The campus was located in [[Hyattsville, Maryland]]. In December 1992, TESST expanded its reach in the Baltimore market by acquiring the Arundel Institute of Technology. In the summer of 1998, the Hyattsville and Baltimore campuses relocated to new buildings in [[Beltsville, Maryland|Beltsville]] and [[Towson, Maryland]].

In 1999, TESST acquired RETS Technical Training Center, which had been offering classes in Maryland since 1956. In June 2001, TESST Technology Institute received approval to offer associate of applied science degrees in network information systems and electronics, computer, and telecommunications technology.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} All campuses then became known as TESST College of Technology.

In May 2002, the College was acquired by Quest Education Corporation, a subsidiary of Kaplan, Inc.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-85932155.html|title=Acquisition by Kaplan, Inc.|publisher=PR Newswire|accessdate=2009-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2002, Quest changed its name to Kaplan Higher Education Corporation. In March 2004, the campus expanded by adding a {{convert|6800|sqft|m2|adj=on}} facility located at 3922 Vero Road, less than a mile from the campus.

In September 2015, TESST College of Technology was acquired by [[Education Corporation of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Education Corporation of America Completes Purchase of Kaplan Campuses|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/education-corporation-of-america-completes-purchase-of-kaplan-college-campuses-300137913.html|publisher=PR Newswire|accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7924">{{Wiktionary|theme}}
In contemporary [[literary studies]], a '''theme''' is the central topic a text treats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
| url = http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/200321?rskey=8toWeL&amp;result=1&amp;isAdvanced=false#eid
| title = Oxford English Dictionary
| work = 
| publisher = 
| accessdate = January 26, 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Themes  can be divided into two categories: a work's ''thematic concept'' is what readers "think the work is about" and its ''thematic statement'' being "what the work says about the subject".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Griffith| first = Kelley| title = Writing Essays about Literature| place = | publisher = Cengage Learning| year = 2010| edition = 8| page =40| language =| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=a05Efo1hOa4C&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=| isbn =1428290419| accessdate=  February 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common contemporary understanding of theme is an idea or point that is central to a story, which can often be summed in a single word (e.g. love, death, betrayal). Typical examples of themes of this type are conflict between the individual and society; coming of age; humans in conflict with technology; [[nostalgia]]; and the dangers of unchecked ambition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Kirszner| first = Laura G. | last2 =Mandell| first2 =Stephen R.| title = Fiction: Reading, Reacting, Writing| publisher =Paulinas| year =1994| pages =3–4| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VzojstMHtY0C&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=| isbn =015501014X | accessdate=February 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{examples needed |date=March 2013}} A theme may be exemplified by the actions, utterances, or thoughts of a character in a novel. An example of this would be the thematic idea of loneliness in [[John Steinbeck]]'s ''[[Of Mice and Men]]'', wherein many of the characters seem to be lonely. It may differ from the thesis—the text's or author's implied worldview.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Weitz| first = Morris| title = Shakespeare Survey| publisher =Cambridge University Press| volume = 28| year = 2002| chapter = Literature Without Philosophy: "Antony and Cleopatra"| page =30| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-CdmtQURHc8C&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=| isbn =0521523656| accessdate= February 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{example needed | march 2013}}

A story may have several themes. Themes often explore historically common or cross-culturally recognizable ideas, such as ethical questions, and are usually implied rather than stated explicitly. An example of this would be whether one should live a seemingly better life, at the price of giving up parts of one's humanity, which is a theme in [[Aldous Huxley|Aldous Huxley’s]] ''Brave New World''. Along with [[Plot (narrative)|plot]], [[Character (arts)|character]], [[Setting (fiction)|setting]], and [[Style (fiction)|style]], theme is considered one of the [[literary element|components]] of [[fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Obstfeld|2002|pp=1,65,115,171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==
Various [[Literary technique|techniques]] may be used to express many more themes.

===Leitwortstil===
''Leitwortstil'' is the repetition of a wording, often with a theme, in a narrative to make sure it catches the reader's attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last= Pinault| first= David| title= Story Telling Techniques in the "Arabian Nights"| publisher= Brill| series= Studies in Arabic Literature| volume= 15| year= 1992| page= 18| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=guHmLGJMbg4C&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq= | isbn= 9004095306 | accessdate= February 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a leitwortstil is the recurring phrase, "So it goes", in [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s novel ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]''. Its seeming message is that the world is [[deterministic]]: that things only could have happened in one way, and that the future already is predetermined. But given the anti-war tone of the story, the message perhaps is on the contrary, that ''things could have been different''. A non-fictional example of leitwortstil is in the book ''Too Soon Old, Too Late Smart: Thirty True Things You Need to Know Now'' written by Gordon Livingston, which is an anthology of personal anecdotes multiple times interjected by the phrases "Don't do the same thing and expect different results", "It is a bad idea to lie to yourself", and "No one likes to be told what to do".

===Thematic patterning===
''Thematic patterning'' means the insertion of a recurring motif in a narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Pinault, David. 1992. ''Story-telling techniques in the Arabian nights''. Leiden: Brill. p. 22. {{ISBN|9004095306}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, various scenes in [[John Steinbeck]]'s ''[[Of Mice and Men]]'' are about loneliness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Scalia| first = Joseph E.| last2 =Shamblin| first2 =Lena T. &amp; Research and Education Association | title =  John Steinbeck's Of mice and men| place =Piscataway, N.J | publisher =Research &amp; Education Association | year =2001| page =13| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=96WfEbkKIKAC&amp;pg=PA85&amp;dq=| isbn =087891997X | accessdate= February 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thematic patterning is evident in ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'',&lt;ref name="Heath"&gt;{{citation|first=Peter|last=Heath|title=Reviewed work(s) ''Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights'' by David Pinault|journal=[[International Journal of Middle East Studies]]|volume=26|issue=2|date=May 1994|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|pages=358–360 [359–60]|doi=10.1017/s0020743800060633}}&lt;/ref&gt; an example being the story of "The City of Brass". According to David Pinault, the overarching theme of that tale, in which a group of travelers roam the desert in search of ancient brass artifacts, is that "riches and pomp tempt one away from God".&lt;ref name="Pinault_23"&gt;Pinault, David. 1992. ''Story-telling techniques in the Arabian nights''. Leiden: Brill. p. 23. {{ISBN|9004095306}}&lt;/ref&gt; The narrative is interrupted several times by stories within the story. These include a tale recorded in an inscription found in the palace of Kush ibh Shaddad; a story told by a prisoner about Solomon; and an episode involving Queen Tadmur's corpse. According to Pinault, "each of these minor narratives introduces a character who confesses that he once proudly enjoyed worldly prosperity: subsequently, we learn, the given character has been brought low by God ... These minor tales ultimately reinforce the theme of the major narrative".&lt;ref name="Pinault_23"/&gt;

== Examples ==
Some common themes in literature are "love," "war," "revenge," "betrayal,"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Baldick|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; "patriotism," "grace," "isolation," "motherhood," "forgiveness," "wartime loss,"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Carey|Snodgrass|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; "treachery," "rich versus poor," "appearance versus reality," and "help from other-worldly powers."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Brown|Rosenberg|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Type II partnerships''' were developed at the [[Earth Summit 2002|Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development]] in 2002. Arising in opposition to the [[State (polity)|state]]-centred [[Ecogovernmentality|eco-governmentality]] of previous approaches to [[sustainable development]] policy, the partnerships facilitate the inclusion of private and civil [[Actor (policy debate)|actors]] into the management of sustainable development. The partnerships are employed alongside traditional [[Intergovernmentalism|intergovernmental]] mechanisms in order to effectively implement the United Nations' [[Agenda 21]] and [[Millennium Development Goals]], particularly at sub-national level. Although widely acknowledged as one of the most innovative and effective developments in global [[environmental governance]] in recent years, the partnerships have faced criticism due to fears of a lack of [[accountability]], and the risk that they may exacerbate inequalities of power between Northern and Southern states. Despite these reservations, there is a general consensus among state and non-governmental actors that Type II partnerships are a significantly progressive step in global environmental governance in general, and sustainable development [[discourse]] in particular.&lt;ref name="Witte"&gt;{{cite book|last=Witte|first=J.M.|title=or Peril? Networks and Partnerships in Global Environmental Governance|year=2003|publisher=Global Public Policy Institute|location=Washington D.C.|authorlink=The Road from Johannesburg: What Future for Partnerships in Global Environmental Governance?|author2=Streck, C. |author3=Benner, T. |editor=T. Benner |editor2=C. Streck |editor3=J.M. Witte}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background and development==

First proposed at the Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002, Type II partnerships are characterised by collaborations between national or sub-national governments, private sector actors and civil society actors, who form [[Voluntariness|voluntary]] transnational agreements in order to meet specific sustainable development goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baker|first=Susan|title=Sustainable Development|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Johannesburg negotiations also produced so-called Type I outcomes referred to under the umbrella of a Global Deal, a series of legally binding intergovernmental commitments designed to aid states in the implementation of sustainable development goals.&lt;ref name="Death"&gt;{{cite book|last=Death|first=Carl|title=Governing Sustainable Development: Partnerships, Protests and Power at the World Summit|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, during the discussions preceding the summit, a growing consensus emerged among the actors involved that traditional intergovernmental relations were no longer sufficient in the management of sustainable development, and consequently the talks began to incorporate suggestions for increasingly [[Decentralisation|decentralised]] and [[Participation (decision making)|participatory]] approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Von Moltke|first=K|title=Governments and International Civil Society in Sustainable Development: A Framework|journal=International Environmental Agreements: Politics, Law and Economics|year=2002|volume=2|issue=4|pages=341–359|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/r357283n24j85mr1/|accessdate=10 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considered to be one of the most innovative and celebrated outcomes of the 2002 summit, the partnerships were created as a means by which to further implement the sustainable development goals set out in the Agenda 21 action plan, particularly those objectives aimed at the local and regional level, as traditional Type I intergovernmental strategies were deemed unlikely to effectively achieve lower level implementation of the Agenda 21 plan.&lt;ref name="UNESCAP"&gt;{{cite book|last=UNESCAP|title=Regional Follow-Up to the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific|year=2003|publisher=United Nations Publications|location=Italy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Johannesburg negotiations concluded that Type II partnerships must meet seven key criteria: i) they should be voluntary and based on shared responsibility, ii) they must complement, rather than substitute, intergovernmental sustainable development strategies, and must meet the agreed outcomes of the Johannesburg summit, iii) they must consist of a range of multi-level [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]], preferably within a given area of work, iv) they must ensure [[Transparency (social)|transparency]] and accountability, v) they must produce tangible results, vi) the partnership must be new, and adequate funding must be available, and vii) a follow-up process must be developed. If these requirements were successfully fulfilled, it was hoped that Type II partnerships could create a fundamental shift in sustainable development discourse, leading to an increasingly participatory, bottom-up method of governing the issue.&lt;ref name="UNESCAP"/&gt;

== Implementation and management==

Following the Johannesburg summit, the [[United Nations Commission for Sustainable Development]] was granted responsibility for the management of Type II partnerships as its [[:wikt:mandate|mandate]] and focus were considered most appropriate to the supervision of the partnerships. The UNCSD was created following the [[Earth Summit|1992 Rio summit]] with the sole mandate of overseeing the implementation of Agenda 21 and the [[Rio Declaration on Environment and Development]], a focus which made the UNCSD highly amenable to the management of Type II agreements. The UNCSD supervises the 300+ Type II partnerships formed as a result of the summit, ensuring that the partnerships continue to implement the sustainable development goals agreed at Johannesburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bull|first=B|title=International Handbook on Public-Private Partnerships|year=2011|publisher=Edward Elgar|location=Cheltenham|authorlink=Public-Private Partnerships: The United Nations Experience|editor=G.A. Hodge |editor2=C. Greve |editor3=A.E. Boardman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of one of the larger partnerships supervised by the UNCSD is the [[Global Water Partnership]], a network of over 2,300 global partners composed of organisations including UN agencies, governments of developed and developing countries, development banks, research institutions, [[NGOs]] and private actors. The organisation aims to diffuse information regarding water management to stakeholders at all levels, and assists countries in the development of water management strategies at the local, national and global level, increasing the capacity of developing nations to manage water supplies in the long term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Global Water Partnership|title=About GWP|url=http://www.gwp.org/en/About-GWP/|accessdate=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''“This Summit will be remembered not for the treaties, commitments, or eloquent declarations it produced, but for the first stirrings of a new way of governing the global commons, the beginnings of a shift from the stiff formal waltz of traditional diplomacy to the jazzier dance of improvisational solution oriented partnerships that may include non-government organizations, willing governments and other stakeholders.”'' World Resources Institute, 2002&lt;ref name="WRI"&gt;{{cite web|last=World Resources Institute|title=The Johannesburg Summit- News Release|url=http://archive.wri.org/newsroom/wrifeatures_text.cfm?ContentID=371|accessdate=11 May 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807172431/http://archive.wri.org/newsroom/wrifeatures_text.cfm?ContentID=371|archivedate=7 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The dominance of Type II partnerships as a primary outcome of the Johannesburg summit represented a fundamental shift in the governing of sustainable development; a transition from the top-down, government-centred method favoured by the [[Brundtland Report]] and at the 1992 Rio summit, to a collaborative, multi-stakeholder approach which acknowledged the importance of the economic and social expertise of non-governmental actors in sustainable development initiatives. Immediately prior to the summit, then- UN Secretary General [[Kofi Annan]] predicted that whilst [[governments]] would be responsible for the creation of a common plan of action for sustainable development, the most significant and powerful agents of change to emerge from the Johannesburg negotiations would be Type II partnerships, through which the UN hoped to harness the technological, financial and scientific resources of partners involved in the agreements, reinvigorating the organisation's pursuit of sustainable development.&lt;ref name="Death"/&gt;

The UN guidelines for Type II partnerships specified that the agreements should be complementary to, not an alternative to, intergovernmental action plans for sustainable development. As opposed to developing the partnerships as a method of 'governing without government', the agreements were designed to govern alongside traditional government approaches. Rather than treating Type II partnerships as a [[panacea]] for sustainable development, it was hoped that such participatory multi-stakeholder governance mechanisms would increase the flexibility and enhance the implementation of sustainable development policy in collaboration with states and international organisations. After the Johannesburg summit, the concept of environmental governance was no longer understood as a legalistic function performed solely by governments, but rather as a collaborative, informal approach to the management of environmental issues, involving both state and non-governmental actors. This new understanding demonstrates that the changing approach to sustainable development which arose from the Johannesburg summit influenced a much wider shift in global environmental governance.&lt;ref name="Witte"/&gt;

==== Competing rationalities of government====

Within a [[Michel Foucault|Foucauldian]] context, the Type I and Type II arguments presented in the summit negotiations represent two fundamentally opposing [[Governmentality|rationalities of government]]. The [[Interventionism (politics)|interventionist]], state-centric approach to sustainable development favoured by advocates of the Global Deal represents a rationality of government which Foucault&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foucault|first=Michel|title=The Will to Knowledge: The History of Sexuality, vol. 1|year=1998|publisher=Penguin|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; identified as [[Biopolitics|bio-politics]]; the application of political power in an attempt to control or modify life processes. Such an approach to the pursuit of sustainable development offers little opportunity for participation by private or civil actors, in direct contrast to the multi-stakeholder premise of Type II partnerships. The eco-governmental, disciplinary ideas conveyed in the Global Deal suggest that the Type I approach typifies the centralised [[command-and-control]] method favoured by traditional government, whereas the decentralised, voluntary nature of Type II partnerships demonstrates an advanced liberal governmentality which empowers non-state actors to undertake responsibility for the governing of sustainable development, an approach which is representative of the participatory, multi-stakeholder methods by which governance is characterised.&lt;ref name="Death"/&gt; The eventual dominance of Type II partnerships in the outcomes of the Johannesburg summit therefore symbolises a wider shift in the understanding of the purposes, ends and means of government in relation to sustainable development and environmental governance.

However, Mert&lt;ref name="Mert"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mert|first=A|title=Partnerships for sustainable development as discursive practice: Shifts in discourses of environment and democracy|journal=Forest Policy and Economics|year=2009|volume=11|issue=5–6|pages=326–339|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VT4-4V1V4W8-1&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=10%2F31%2F2009&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=gateway&amp;_origin=gateway&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=15ccd8bbaafc4015ed26846ca6267eb1&amp;searchtype=a|accessdate=14 May 2011|doi=10.1016/j.forpol.2008.10.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; questions the compatibility of partnerships with the global governance of sustainable development. The partnerships represented a point of intersection between three previously separate political discourses; [[participatory democracy]], [[private governance]], and sustainable development, altering the dynamics of global environmental governance processes. The shift towards voluntary [[Mechanism (sociology)|mechanisms]] as opposed to international regulation could prove problematic as legally binding [[Legal framework|frameworks]] are sometimes the most appropriate solution to the governance of environmental problems. A [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] approach to sustainable development discourse could demonstrate greater effectiveness in the management of the issue than a fragmented, partnership-driven approach which could lead to inconsistent and conflicting management of such a global issue.&lt;ref name="Mert"/&gt;

=== Transnational governance networks===

Type II partnerships exemplify a growing reliance on public-private-civil co-operation in environmental governance. The architects of the summit placed an emphasis on discussions which would encourage the creation of multi-stakeholder partnerships with the objective of fulfilling UN sustainable development goals, acknowledging that traditional intergovernmental agreements were inadequate to sufficiently promote sustainable development.&lt;ref name="AndonovaLevy"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Andonova|first=L.B.|author2=Levy, M.A.|title=Franchising Global Governance: Making Sense of the Johannesburg Type II Partnerships|journal=Yearbook of International Co-operation on Environment and Development 2003/04|year=2003|url=http://web-prod.iheid.ch/webdav/site/iheid/shared/iheid/800/andonova/Andonova-Levy2.pdf|accessdate=5 May 2011}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, state actors were notoriously unwilling to improve international environmental co-operation prior to the Johannesburg summit, leaving those who sought a positive outcome to the WSSD to search for alternative solutions which incorporated a broader variety of actors.&lt;ref name="Andonova"&gt;{{cite book|title=International Organisations in Global Environmental Governance|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon|author=Andonova, L.B.|authorlink=International Organisations as Entrepreneurs of Environmental Partnerships|editor1=F. Biermann |editor2=B. Siebenhüner |editor3=A. Schreyögg }}&lt;/ref&gt; Type II partnerships emerged as the dominant outcome of the Johannesburg summit, highlighting their importance as agents of change in the achievement of sustainable development. The partnerships were considered by advocates to be representative of a new era of environmental governance, characterised by collaborative decision-making and shared responsibility between public, private and civil actors in the management of [[International|transnational]] public issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Partnerships, Governance and Sustainable Development: Reflections on Theory and Practice|year=2007|publisher=Edward Elgar|location=Cheltenham|author=Glasbergen, P.|authorlink=Setting the Scene: The Partnership Paradigm in the Making|editor=P. Glasbergen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of Type II partnerships marked the emergence of a broader phenomenon within environmental governance- the introduction of [[Network governance|transnational governance networks]] in the management of global environmental issues. Transnational governance networks combine actors from the public, private and civil sectors in the pursuit of common practices and ideas.&lt;ref name="Andonova"/&gt; The role of networks of private and civil actors in transboundary communication is not novel to the academic community; however, the emphasis on transnational public-private-civil networks as mechanisms for achieving sustainable development during the Johannesburg negotiations led to recognition of the ability of such networks to integrate private and civil actors into the global environmental governance process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=J|title=Environmental Governance|year=2011|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transnational governance networks address a number of shortcomings in traditional state-centred approaches to the management of transboundary issues such as sustainable development. They can diffuse information to the public perhaps more effectively than governments or international organisations, particularly when such information requires a degree of technical expertise to deliver, such as the transfer of specialised knowledge from the private sector to industry groups regarding sustainable business practices. They can also facilitate the implementation of global management strategies at the local level, and they may potentially close the participation gap in global environmental governance by involving private and civil actors in decision-making processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Biermann|first=F |author2=Chan, M-S. |author3=Mert, A. |author4=Pattberg, P. |title=Multi-stakeholder Partnerships for Sustainable Development: Does the Promise Hold?|journal=Paper presented at the 2007 Amsterdam Conference on the Human Dimensions of Global Environmental Change|year=2007|url=http://www.2007amsterdamconference.org/Downloads/AC2007_%20BiermannChanMertPattberg.pdf|accessdate=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reframing of sustainable development discourse===

The Johannesburg summit represented a further shift in the governing of sustainable development; rather than considering environmental issues in isolation, as had previously been common practice within sustainable development policy, the Johannesburg negotiations concluded that a reframing of sustainable development discourse, which re-conceptualised sustainable development as a dynamic interaction between three interdependent pillars- society, environment and economy- was necessary in order to pursue a more [[holistic]] ideal of sustainable development. This reframing of sustainable development required Type II partnerships to address a broader concept of sustainable development, and consequently objectives such as poverty alleviation and community involvement feature alongside environmental issues in the objectives of the partnerships.&lt;ref name="Death"/&gt;

== Issues==

=== Imbalances of power===

Although designed to incorporate a broader range of social, environmental and economic perspectives into the environmental governance process and to facilitate the inclusion of actors from all levels into decision-making, the extent to which imbalances of power between actors involved in the partnerships affects their implementation has provoked concern among their critics.&lt;ref name="AndonovaLevy"/&gt;

Brinkerhoff and Brinkerhoff&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brinkerhoff|first=D.W.|author2=Brinkerhoff, J.M. |title=Partnerships between international donors and non-governmental development organizations: opportunities and constraints|journal=Review of Administrative Sciences|year=2004|volume=70|issue=2|pages=253–270|url=http://ras.sagepub.com/content/70/2/253.short|accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; theorised that an effective partnership must fulfil two essential criteria: mutuality- interdependence and equality between partners, and organisational identity- the equal maintenance of each partner’s missions and goals. In the event of a partnership between Northern and Southern actors, for example, the North will inevitably contribute greater financial and material resources to the partnership than the South, creating a power inequality which may enable the North to assume control of the partnership and impairing the mutuality necessary for the partnership to function successfully.&lt;ref name="Blagescu"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blagescu|first=M.|author2=Young, J. |title=Partnerships and Accountability: Current thinking and approaches among agencies supporting Civil Society Organisations|journal=ODI Working Paper no. 255|year=2005|url=http://kms1.isn.ethz.ch|accessdate=14 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concern was reflected by a number of developing nations who formed a coalition to lobby against the development of Type II partnerships, fearing that the partnerships would award too much authority over sustainable development to the global North, whilst simultaneously reducing the responsibility of industrialised nations to develop and implement legally binding intergovernmental management strategies.&lt;ref name="Witte"/&gt;

In order to maintain mutuality, it is therefore essential that the definition of a contribution within Type II partnerships is extended beyond financial and material resources, and includes knowledge, skills and other relevant strengths which can be incorporated to redress the balance of power within the partnership.&lt;ref name="Blagescu"/&gt;

=== Accountability===

Critics of Type II partnerships have expressed concern that the initiative is simply a means by which to deflect accountability for sustainable development management from states and international organisations. The United States, a nation infamously opposed to state-led environmental governance as evidenced by their withdrawal from the [[Kyoto protocol]], strongly supported the development of Type II partnerships whilst continuing to oppose Type I outcomes, leading to concern that some nations may view Type II partnerships as an opportunity to deflect attention from a lack of state-level progress in the management of sustainable development. An emphasis on Type II partnerships, it is argued, could therefore be exploited by nations who wish to avoid accountability for the management of sustainable development and environmental issues, transferring responsibility for such issues to private actors who are less accountable to the needs of those affected by the problem in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Survival For a Small Planet|year=2004|publisher=Earthscan|location=London|author=Bigg, T.|authorlink=The World Summit on Sustainable Development: Was It Worth It?|editor=T. Bigg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ensuring of accountability and transparency is a key criterion of Type II partnerships; however, the diverse multi-stakeholder composition of the partnerships negates the use of traditional accountability methods, such as the introduction of a centralised authority charged with maintaining the accountability of the partners involved in Type II agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hale|first=T.N.|author2=Mauzerall, D.L. |title=Thinking Globally and Acting Locally: Can the Johannesburg Partnerships Coordinate Action on Sustainable Development?|journal=Journal of Environment and Development|year=2004|volume=13|issue=3|pages=220–239|url=http://jed.sagepub.com/content/13/3/220.short|accessdate=5 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bäckstrand&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bäckstrand|first=K|title=Democratizing Global Environmental Governance? Stakeholder Democracy after the World Summit on Sustainable Development|journal=European Journal of International Relations|year=2006|volume=12|issue=4|pages=467–498|url=http://ejt.sagepub.com/content/12/4/467.abstract?rss=1|accessdate=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that a [[Pluralism (political theory)|pluralistic]] system of accountability, incorporating market and reputational accountability measures such as financial sanctions and [[name and shame|naming and shaming]], could improve the accountability of the actors involved in Type II partnerships by providing more flexible methods of ensuring accountability which can be adapted to the nature of the actor in question.

== Discussion==

The Type II partnerships developed at the Johannesburg summit demonstrated a paradigm-shifting impact upon sustainable development discourse and the conceptualisation of global environmental governance. By addressing the limitations of the state-centric, top-down method which typified environmental governance prior to Johannesburg and facilitating the participation of private and civil actors in the governing of sustainable development, the partnerships became emblematic of the transition from command-and-control government to the informal, participatory governance mechanisms by which global environmental governance is now classified. Furthermore, the partnerships exemplify the use of transnational governance networks as a mechanism by which to implement environmental policy at local and regional level. Such factors led the World Resources Institute&lt;ref name="WRI"/&gt; to declare the partnerships representative of a ‘new era’ of environmental governance.

However, considering the flaws inherent in the partnerships, it is crucial that advocates of the agreements resist the temptation to consider them a magic bullet with which every shortcoming of a centralised approach to environmental governance can be addressed. Although advantageous in terms of increased flexibility and effective lower-level implementation of policies, partnerships lack the internal and external accountability of intergovernmental strategies, and may intensify power inequalities between the industrialised North and developing South. The decision of the UN to introduce Type II partnerships as complementary governance mechanism is therefore the most appropriate application of the partnerships, as the dynamic interaction between intergovernmental strategies and voluntary public-private-civil partnerships can potentially produce a far greater positive impact upon global environmental governance than the sum of its parts.

'''Vernalization''' (from [[Latin]] ''vernus'', "of the [[spring (season)|spring]]") is the induction of a plant's [[flower]]ing process by exposure to the prolonged cold of winter, or by an artificial equivalent. After vernalization, plants have acquired the ability to flower, but they may require additional seasonal cues or weeks of growth before they will actually flower. Vernalization is sometimes used to refer to herbal (non-woody) plants requiring a cold dormancy to produce new shoots and leaves&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sokolski |first1=K. |last2=Dovholuk |first2=A. |last3=Dovholuk |first3=L. |last4=Faletra |first4=P. |title=Axenic seed culture and micropropagation of ''Cypripedium reginae'' |journal=Selbyana |volume=18 |issue=2 |year=1997 |pages=172–82 |jstor=41760430 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but this usage is discouraged.&lt;ref name = "chouard"&gt;{{cite journal

Many plants grown in [[temperate]] climates require vernalization and must experience a period of low winter temperature to initiate or accelerate the flowering process. This ensures that reproductive development and seed production occurs in spring and winters, rather than in autumn.&lt;ref name = "sung"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sung |first1=Sibum |last2=He |first2=Yuehui |last3=Eshoo |first3=Tifani W |last4=Tamada |first4=Yosuke |last5=Johnson |first5=Lianna |last6=Nakahigashi |first6=Kenji |last7=Goto |first7=Koji |last8=Jacobsen |first8=Steve E |last9=Amasino |first9=Richard M |title=Epigenetic maintenance of the vernalized state in Arabidopsis thaliana requires LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN 1 |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=38 |issue=6 |pages=706–10 |year=2006 |pmid=16682972 |doi=10.1038/ng1795 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The needed cold is often expressed in [[chilling requirement|chill hours]]. Typical vernalization temperatures are between 5 and 10 degrees Celsius (40 and 50 degrees Fahrenheit).{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

For many [[perennial plants]], such as [[fruit tree]] species, a period of cold is needed first to induce dormancy and then later, after the requisite period of time, re-emerge from that dormancy prior to flowering. Many [[monocarpic]] winter [[annual plant|annuals]] and [[biennial plant|biennials]], including some [[ecotype]]s of ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Michaels |first1=Scott D. |last2=He |first2=Yuehui |last3=Scortecci |first3=Katia C. |last4=Amasino |first4=Richard M. |title=Attenuation of FLOWERING LOCUS C activity as a mechanism for the evolution of summer-annual flowering behavior in Arabidopsis |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=100 |issue=17 |pages=10102–7 |year=2003 |pmid=12904584 |pmc=187779 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1531467100 |jstor=3147669 |bibcode=2003PNAS..10010102M }}&lt;/ref&gt; and winter [[cereals]] such as [[wheat]], must go through a prolonged period of cold before flowering occurs.

==History of vernalization research==
In the [[history of agriculture]], farmers observed a traditional distinction between "winter cereals", whose seeds require chilling (to trigger their subsequent emergence and growth), and "spring cereals", whose seeds can be sown in spring, and germinate, and then flower soon thereafter. Scientists in the early 19th century had discussed how some plants needed cold temperatures to  flower. In 1857 an American agriculturist [[John Hancock Klippart]], Secretary of the Ohio Board of Agriculture, reported the importance and effect of winter temperature on the germination of wheat. One of the most significant works was by a German plant physiologist [[Gustav Gassner]] &lt;!-- .de version exists --&gt; who made a detailed discussion in his 1918 paper. Gassner was the first to systematically differentiate the specific requirements of winter plants from those of summer plants, and also that early swollen germinating seeds of winter cereals are sensitive to cold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chouard|first1=P|title=Vernalization and its relations to dormancy|journal=Annual Review of Plant Physiology|date=1960|volume=11|issue=1|pages=191–238|doi=10.1146/annurev.pp.11.060160.001203}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1928 a Russian geneticist [[Trofim Lysenko]] published his works on the effects of cold on cereal seeds, and coined the term "яровизация" ("jarovization") to describe a chilling process he used to make the seeds of winter cereals behave like spring cereals (''Jarovoe'' in Russian, originally from ''jar'' meaning fire or the god of spring). Lysenko himself translated the term into "vernalization" (from the Latin ''vernum'' meaning Spring). After Lysenko the term was used to explain the ability of flowering in some plants after a period of chilling due to physiological changes and external factors. The formal definition was given in 1960 by a French botanist P. Chouard, as "the acquisition or acceleration of the ability to flower by a chilling treatment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Poltronieri|first1=Palmiro|last2=Hong|first2=Yiguo|title=Applied Plant Genomics and Biotechnology|date=2015|publisher=Woodhead Publishing|location=Cambridge (UK)|isbn=978-0-08-100068-7|page=121|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tMIcBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lysenko's 1928 paper on vernalization and [[plant physiology]] drew wide attention due to its practical consequences for Russian agriculture. Severe cold and lack of winter snow had destroyed many early winter wheat seedlings. By treating wheat seeds with moisture as well as cold, Lysenko induced them to bear a crop when planted in spring.&lt;ref name="lysenkosci"&gt;{{cite journal| first1= Nils |last1=Roll-Hansen| year = 1985| title = A new perspective on Lysenko?| journal = [[Annals of Science]]| volume = 42| pmid = 11620694| issue = 3| pages = 261–278| publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis| doi = 10.1080/00033798500200201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later however, Lysenko inaccurately asserted that the vernalized state could be inherited, i.e. the offspring of a vernalized plant would behave as if they themselves had also been vernalized and would not require vernalization in order to flower quickly.&lt;ref name = "amasino"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Amasino|first1=R.|title=Vernalization, competence, and the epigenetic memory of winter|journal=The Plant Cell|date=2004|volume=16|issue=10|pages=2553–2559|doi=10.1105/tpc.104.161070|pmid=15466409|pmc=520954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early research on vernalization focused on plant physiology; the increasing availability of molecular biology has made it possible to unravel its underlying mechanisms.&lt;ref name = "amasino"/&gt; For example, a lengthening daylight period (longer days), ''as well as'' cold temperatures are required for winter wheat plants to go from the vegetative to the reproductive state; the three interacting genes are called ''VRN1'', ''VRN2'', and ''FT'' (''VRN3'').&lt;ref name = "trevaskis"&gt;{{cite journal

Due to plant flowering requiring the successful co-operation of several [[metabolic pathway]]s, computer models that incorporate vernalization have also been made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=New Genetic Model Predicts Plant Flowering in Different Environments |publisher=Brown University |date=January 15, 2009 |url=https://news.brown.edu/articles/2009/01/arabidopsis |accessdate=March 20, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In ''Arabidopsis thaliana''==

''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' ("thale cress") is a much-studied model for vernalization. Some ecotypes (varieties), called "winter annuals", have delayed flowering without vernalization; others ("summer annuals") do not.&lt;ref name ="pbvr"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.plant-biology.com/vernalisation-response.php

The reproductive phase change of ''A. thaliana'' occurs by a sequence of two related events: first, the [[Bolting (horticulture)|bolting]] transition (flower stalk elongates), then the floral transition (first flower appears).&lt;ref name=pouteau&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pouteau |first1=Sylvie |last2=Albertini |first2=Catherine |title=The significance of bolting and floral transitions as indicators of reproductive phase change in ''Arabidopsis'' |journal=Journal of Experimental Botany |volume=60 |issue=12 |pages=3367–77 |year=2009 |pmid=19502535 |doi=10.1093/jxb/erp173 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bolting is a robust predictor of flower formation, and hence a good indicator for vernalization research.&lt;ref name = "pouteau"/&gt;

In winter annual ''Arabidopsis'', vernalization of the [[meristem]] appears to confer competence to respond to floral inductive signals. A vernalized meristem retains competence for as long as 300 days in the absence of an inductive signal.&lt;ref name ="pbvr"/&gt;

At the molecular level, flowering is repressed by the protein ''Flowering Locus C'' (''FLC''), which binds to and represses genes that promote flowering, thus blocking flowering.&lt;ref name = "sung"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Amasino |first1=Richard |title=Seasonal and developmental timing of flowering |journal=The Plant Journal |volume=61 |issue=6 |pages=1001–13 |year=2010 |pmid=20409274 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-313X.2010.04148.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Winter annual ecotypes of Arabidopsis have an active copy of the gene ''FRIGIDA'' (''FRI''), which promotes ''FLC'' expression, thus repression of flowering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Choi |first1=Kyuha |last2=Kim |first2=Juhyun |last3=Hwang |first3=Hyun-Ju |last4=Kim |first4=Sanghee |last5=Park |first5=Chulmin |last6=Kim |first6=Sang Yeol |last7=Lee |first7=Ilha |title=The FRIGIDA Complex Activates Transcription ofFLC, a Strong Flowering Repressor inArabidopsis, by Recruiting Chromatin Modification Factors |journal=The Plant Cell |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=289–303 |year=2011 |pmid=21282526 |pmc=3051252 |doi=10.1105/tpc.110.075911 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prolonged exposure to cold (vernalization) induces expression of ''VERNALIZATION INSENSTIVE3'', which interacts with the ''VERNALIZATION2'' polycomb-like complex to reduce ''FLC'' expression through chromatin remodeling.&lt;ref name = "Sung and Amasino"&gt;{{cite journal

Since vernalization also occurs in ''flc'' mutants (lacking ''FLC''), vernalization must also activate a non-''FLC'' pathway.&lt;ref name ="pbvp"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.plant-biology.com/vernalisation-pathway-Arabidopsis.php

==Devernalization==
It is possible to devernalize a plant by 
exposure to sometimes low and  high temperatures subsequent to vernalization. For example, commercial [[onion]] growers store sets at low temperatures, but devernalize them before planting, because they want the plant's energy to go into enlarging its bulb (underground stem), not making flowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia
|encyclopedia= Eopædia Britannica Online
|title= Vernalization
|url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/626291/vernalization
|quote= vernalization, the artificial exposure of plants (or seeds) to low temperatures in order to stimulate flowering or to enhance seed production. By satisfying the cold requirement of many temperate-zone plants, flowering can be induced to occur earlier than normal or in warm climates lacking the requisite seasonal chilling.
