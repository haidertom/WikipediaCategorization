A '''breath mark''' or '''luftpause''' is a [[symbol]] used in [[musical notation]].  It directs the performer of the music passage to take a breath (for [[wind instrument]]s and [[vocalist]]s) or to make a slight pause (for non-wind [[musical instrument|instrument]]s). This pause is normally intended to shorten the duration of the preceding [[Musical note|note]] and not to alter the [[tempo]]; in this function it can be thought of as a [[grace note|grace]] [[rest (music)|rest]].  It is usually placed above the [[staff (music)|staff]] and at the ends of [[phrase (music)|phrase]]s.  Its function is analogous to the [[comma (punctuation)|comma]] in several [[written language]]s.  Indeed, the two symbols look identical.

{{Anthropology of kinship |terms}}
{{main|Kinship}}

'''Classificatory kinship''' systems, as defined by [[Lewis Henry Morgan]], put people into society-wide [[kinship]] classes on the basis of abstract relationship rules. These may have to do with [[genealogy|genealogical]] relations locally (e.g., son to father, daughter to mother, daughter to father) but the classes bear no overall relation to genetic closeness. If a total stranger marries into the society, for example, they may simply be placed in the appropriate class opposite to their spouse.
It uses kinship terms that merge or equate relatives who are genealogically distinct from one another. Here, the same term is used for different kin.

The [[Kinship terminology|Dravidian kinship-term]] system, discovered in 1964, is an example of a classificatory kin-term logic.

This means that they not only shape religious beliefs, but they are determinants of how successfully cultural beliefs are transmitted.

Furthermore, cognition and behavior are inextricably linked,&lt;ref name="neisser"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Neisser|first1=Ulric|title=Cognitive psychology.|date=1967|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=New York|isbn=978-0131396678}}&lt;/ref&gt; so the consequences of cultural concepts are associated with behavioral outcomes (i.e., continued interactions with the environment).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For religion, behaviors often take the form of [[ritual]]s and are similarly executed as a consequence of beliefs.

== Religious cognition ==
Research in [[evolutionary psychology]] suggests that the brain is a coordinated network of domain-specific modules corresponding to various adaptations that emerged in our evolutionary history.&lt;ref name=":norenbuss" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barrett|first1=H. Clark|last2=Kurzban|first2=Robert|title=Modularity in Cognition: Framing the Debate|journal=Psychological Review|date=2006|volume=113|issue=3|pages=628–647|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.113.3.628|pmid=16802884}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fodor|first1=Jerry A.|title=The modularity of mind: an essay on faculty psychology|date=1984|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass. [u.a.]|isbn=0-262-56025-9|edition=3. pr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most claim that a capacity for religious thoughts is not a modular adaptation itself, but an evolutionary byproduct of multiple integrated mechanisms that arose independently and are designed for different functions. These modules are co-opted to give rise to religious thinking patterns, and they include [[theory of mind]], [[Essentialism|essential psychology]] and the [[hyperactive agency detection device]].&lt;ref name=":norenbuss" /&gt; Moreover, the cultural transmission of these ideas is contingent upon them being minimally counterintuitive.&lt;ref name="atranhenrich"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Atran|first1=Scott|last2=Henrich|first2=Joseph|title=The Evolution of Religion: How Cognitive By-Products, Adaptive Learning Heuristics, Ritual Displays, and Group Competition Generate Deep Commitments to Prosocial Religions|journal=Biological Theory|date=January 2010|volume=5|issue=1|pages=18–30|doi=10.1162/BIOT_a_00018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theory of mind ===
Theory of mind (ToM) is a capacity to attribute mental states, complete with thoughts, emotions and motivations, to other social agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Premack|first1=David|last2=Woodruff|first2=Guy|title=Does the chimpanzee have a theory of mind?|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|date=4 February 2010|volume=1|issue=04|pages=515|doi=10.1017/S0140525X00076512}}&lt;/ref&gt; This adaptation is ubiquitous in primitive forms among various social species, but the complexity of human social life for long stretches of evolutionary history has facilitated a rich understanding of others' mental experiences to match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barclay|first1=Pat|editor1-last=Buss|editor1-first=David|title=The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology|date=2016|edition=2nd|chapter=Reputation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cases of [[autism]] have been cited in support for the proposition that ToM is a distinct modular adaptation because of its distinctly narrow impact on ToM capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baron-Cohen|first1=Simon|title=Mindblindness: an essay on autism and theory of mind|date=1997|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass [u.a.]|isbn=026252225X|edition=1. pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ToM is thought to lend itself to an intuitive sense of [[mind-body dualism]], where the material body is animated by a non-material self (i.e., a "soul").&lt;ref name="boyer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pursosis"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Purzycki &amp; Sosis|editor1-last=Ulrich|editor1-first=Frey|title=Essential Building Blocks of Human Nature|date=2011|chapter=Our Gods: Variation in Supernatural Minds}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Essentialism ===
[[Folk psychology]] among humans is characterized by essential thinking, or a tendency to interpret objects in terms of "essences." This means that attributions of objects' underlying realities are intuitively inferred from a [[fuzzy set]] of the object's [[Ontology|ontological]] features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prentice|first1=Deborah A.|last2=Miller|first2=Dale T.|title=Psychological Essentialism of Human Categories|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|date=August 2007|volume=16|issue=4|pages=202–206|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00504.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive interpretations of essence give rise to concepts of purity, simplified good and evil concepts, and intuitive senses of meaning applied to teleology.&lt;ref name="pursosis" /&gt;

=== Hyperactive agency detection device ===
The capacity for agent detection has been an important modular adaptation for predator avoidance in humans. Some have called this mechanism a hyperactive agency detection device because of its fairly high rate of erroneous agency applications. In a potential predator situation, humans are forced to interpret an object's ontological features, infer agency or non-agency, and execute a behavioral response. Evolutionary theorists have cited the relatively low costs of incorrect agency inferences and the severe [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] costs of detection failure as a reason to suspect that a tendency to interpret naturalistic processes as agent behaviors is an adaptation.&lt;ref name="boyer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boyer|first1=Pascal|title=Religion explained : the evolutionary origins of religious thought|date=2001|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465006960}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gray|first1=K.|last2=Wegner|first2=D. M.|title=Blaming God for Our Pain: Human Suffering and the Divine Mind|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|date=19 November 2009|volume=14|issue=1|pages=7–16|doi=10.1177/1088868309350299}}&lt;/ref&gt; This creates a cognitive bias that leads humans to reason about objects and processes in agentive terms.&lt;ref name="pursosis" /&gt; This is particularly foundational to beliefs in a god or gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barrett|first1=Justin L.|title=Why would anyone believe in God?|date=2004|publisher=AltaMira Press|location=Lanham, MD [u.a.]|isbn=978-0759106673}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Minimally counterintuitive beliefs ===
The integration of ToM, hyperactive applications of agency and essential psychology ultimately renders a cognitive tendency for humans to interact with the naturalistic processes of the world with the [[intentional stance]]. This is a perspective from which humans reason that objects and processes may be enacting behaviors intentionally, with meaningful, rational mental states of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dennett|first1=Daniel C.|title=The intentional stance|date=1989|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=0262540533|edition=1st MIT Press paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious beliefs are successfully transmitted if they are compatible with the cognitive tools that reconstruct them upon reception. This means that they must be minimally counterintuitive, or that they violate few enough ontological features of an object or process, to make general sense while remaining memorable violations nonetheless.&lt;ref name="atranhenrich" /&gt; For example, the concept of a [[ghost]] exploits existing intuitions about mind-body dualism and only violates the usual coupling of mind and body. This creates a memorable concept of a non-material person that can move through walls and have motives of its own. On the other hand, a highly counterintuitive idea about an object that violates several of its ontological features, like a jealous Frisbee, is less likely to be [[Dual inheritance theory|culturally transmitted]]. This is because it is cognitively demanding, not easily reconstructed by the brain and thus, not easily reasoned about and remembered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mesoudi|first1=Alex|title=Cultural Evolution. ; How Darwinian Theory Can Explain Human Culture and Synthesize the Social Sciences.|date=2011|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=9780226520445}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious behaviors associated with culturally transmitted god concepts can be conceptualized as phenotypic strategies associated with the informational makeup of that cultural concept.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Successfully transmitted religious concepts typically involve minimally counterintuitive violations of the intentional stance, which serves a cognitive constraint of cultural evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henrich|first1=Joseph|last2=Boyd|first2=Robert|last3=Richerson|first3=Peter J.|title=Five Misunderstandings About Cultural Evolution|journal=Human Nature|date=19 April 2008|volume=19|issue=2|pages=119–137|doi=10.1007/s12110-008-9037-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ecological factors also play a role in determining which religious behaviors (and their god concepts) are more likely to be replicated.&lt;ref name="purzinpress"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Purzycki|first1=Benjamin Grant|title=The Evolution of Gods' Minds in the Tyva Republic|journal=Current Anthropology|date=13 April 2016|pages=S000–S000|doi=10.1086/685729|volume=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that religious rituals associated with salient representational models of gods' minds and concerns are more likely to survive when they are adaptive strategies.&lt;ref name="boyer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="purz12"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Purzycki|first1=Benjamin G.|last2=Finkel|first2=Daniel N.|last3=Shaver|first3=John|last4=Wales|first4=Nathan|last5=Cohen|first5=Adam B.|last6=Sosis|first6=Richard|title=What Does God Know?

== Ecology of god concepts ==
Cross-culturally, representational models of gods' minds take an array of diverse forms, such as anthropomorphic or zoomorphic figures, abstract forces, or some combination of these. Models of gods' minds typically fall within a spectrum between two extremes: on one end there are Big Gods, and on the other there are Local Gods.&lt;ref name="norenbiggods"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Norenzayan|first1=Ara|title=Big gods : how religion transformed cooperation and conflict|date=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=978-0691151212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Big Gods are usually moralistic, punitive and omniscient, whereas Local Gods are often concerned about ritual behaviors, amoral and limited in knowledge.&lt;ref name="pursosis" /&gt; The subject matter that gods are believed to care across cultures fall into three categories, but may involve an admixture of more than one. These categories are (1) behaviors toward other people, (2) behaviors toward the gods themselves and (3) behaviors toward nature and/or the environment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While people impute these concerns to gods' minds, they often correspond to ecological challenges.&lt;ref name="botero" /&gt; This correspondence establishes why religious ideas often covary with ecological problems in the social and natural world: because these ideas enact behavioral strategies that solve them.&lt;ref name="purzinpress" /&gt;&lt;ref name="norenbiggods" /&gt;

=== Large-scale cooperation ===
Cases of large-scale [[cooperation]] in complex societies are a widely studied example of a socioecological problem that religious beliefs address. Existing models of human cooperation have included [[kin selection]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hamilton|first1=W.D.|title=The genetical evolution of social behaviour. I|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|date=July 1964|volume=7|issue=1|pages=1–16|doi=10.1016/0022-5193(64)90038-4|pmid=5875341}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[reciprocal altruism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trivers|first1=Robert L.|title=The Evolution of Reciprocal Altruism|journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology|date=March 1971|volume=46|issue=1|pages=35–57|doi=10.1086/406755}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[indirect reciprocity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leimar|first1=O|last2=Hammerstein|first2=P|title=Evolution of cooperation through indirect reciprocity.|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=7 April 2001|volume=268|issue=1468|pages=745–53|pmid=11321064|doi=10.1098/rspb.2000.1573|pmc=1088665}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nowak|first1=Martin A.|last2=Sigmund|first2=Karl|title=Evolution of indirect reciprocity by image scoring|journal=Nature|date=11 June 1998|volume=393|issue=6685|pages=573–577|doi=10.1038/31225|pmid=9634232}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Competitive altruism|competitive helping]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barclay|first1=Pat|title=Competitive helping increases with the size of biological markets and invades defection|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|date=July 2011|volume=281|issue=1|pages=47–55|doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2011.04.023|pmid=21550351}}&lt;/ref&gt; These models are robust across certain conditions likely relevant to the [[Pleistocene]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boyd|first1=R.|last2=Richerson|first2=P. J.|title=Culture and the evolution of human cooperation|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=5 October 2009|volume=364|issue=1533|pages=3281–3288|doi=10.1098/rstb.2009.0134}}&lt;/ref&gt; but cooperation is easily eroded in large-scale, complex societies with frequently anonymous interactions between strangers. This is because profitable defections dominate cooperative strategies due to a lack of significant threats of [[punishment]] to defectors.&lt;ref name="mathew"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mathew|first1=S.|last2=Boyd|first2=R.|title=Punishment sustains large-scale cooperation in prestate warfare|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=13 June 2011|volume=108|issue=28|pages=11375–11380|doi=10.1073/pnas.1105604108|pmid=21670285|pmc=3136302}}&lt;/ref&gt; For large-scale cooperation to succeed, a cultural [[Coordination game|coordination solution]] stabilized by sanction threats must exist.&lt;ref name="purz12" /&gt;

[[Morality and religion|Religious rules addressing moral behavior]] are cultural coordination devices that can expand the scale of cooperative behavior by motivating [[Prosocial behavior|prosociality]].&lt;ref name="norenetalpress"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Norenzayan|first1=Ara|last2=Shariff|first2=Azim F.|last3=Gervais|first3=Will M.|last4=Willard|first4=Aiyana K.|last5=McNamara|first5=Rita A.|last6=Slingerland|first6=Edward|last7=Henrich|first7=Joseph|title=The cultural evolution of prosocial religions|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|date=2 December 2014|volume=39|doi=10.1017/S0140525X14001356}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important stipulation here is that these devices must be enforced by punishment threats for people who do not behave prosocially. Frequent instances of anonymity in large-scale societies and the costs associated with punishment undermine sanction threats, but widespread beliefs in morally punitive and [[Omniscience|omniscient]] gods effectively outsource the punishment costs to a pervasive social monitor. This can effectively motivate widespread prosocial behavior in large-scale, complex societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schloss|first1=Jeffrey P.|last2=Murray|first2=Michael J.|title=Evolutionary accounts of belief in supernatural punishment: a critical review|journal=Religion, Brain &amp; Behavior|date=February 2011|volume=1|issue=1|pages=46–99|doi=10.1080/2153599X.2011.558707}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This has been empirically supported from a few different angles. For instance, the cross-cultural prevalence of omniscient, moralistic gods (i.e., Big Gods) is positively correlated with society size and complexity.&lt;ref name="norenetalpress" /&gt; Examples of sharing behaviors in [[Experimental economics|experimental economic games]] played by large-scale societies also reveal more generous behaviors when individuals are primed with Big God concepts before the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Xygalatas|first1=Dimitris|last2=Klocová|first2=Eva Kundtová|last3=Cigán|first3=Jakub|last4=Kundt|first4=Radek|last5=Maňo|first5=Peter|last6=Kotherová|first6=Silvie|last7=Mitkidis|first7=Panagiotis|last8=Wallot|first8=Sebastian|last9=Kanovsky|first9=Martin|title=Location, Location, Location: Effects of Cross-Religious Primes on Prosocial Behavior|journal=The International Journal for the Psychology of Religion|date=9 November 2015|pages=1–16|doi=10.1080/10508619.2015.1097287|volume=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shariff|first1=A.

When distant strangers of the same religion were paired in a game, their sharing behaviors were significantly more generous if their common beliefs involved Big God concepts. The researchers of this study argue that this supports the hypothesis stating that widespread beliefs in omniscient, morally punitive Big Gods may have contributed to the expansion of prosocial behavior.&lt;ref name="norenetalpress" /&gt;&lt;ref name="corelig16"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Purzycki|first1=Benjamin Grant|last2=Apicella|first2=Coren|last3=Atkinson|first3=Quentin D.|last4=Cohen|first4=Emma|last5=McNamara|first5=Rita Anne|last6=Willard|first6=Aiyana K.|last7=Xygalatas|first7=Dimitris|last8=Norenzayan|first8=Ara|last9=Henrich|first9=Joseph|title=Moralistic gods, supernatural punishment and the expansion of human sociality|journal=Nature|date=10 February 2016|volume=530|issue=7590|pages=327–330|doi=10.1038/nature16980|pmid=26863190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Costly signaling ===
Concerns attributed to gods about how people behave toward the gods themselves are widespread and not easily disentangled from specific ecological conditions. The reason is intuitive; [[rational agent]]s who do not care about their treatment are counterintuitive. Researchers investigating the socioecological functions of ritual behaviors in deference to gods claim that functionally, these rituals serve as costly signals of commitment to the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sosis|first1=Richard|last2=Bressler|first2=Eric R.|title=Cooperation and Commune Longevity: A Test of the Costly Signaling Theory of Religion|journal=Cross-Cultural Research|date=1 May 2003|volume=37|issue=2|pages=211–239|doi=10.1177/1069397103037002003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Costly ritual displays are particularly public and ubiquitous in small-scale societies, functioning as social devices that promote intragroup cohesion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fischer|first1=Ronald|last2=Xygalatas|first2=Dimitris|title=Extreme Rituals as Social Technologies|journal=Journal of Cognition and Culture|date=6 November 2014|volume=14|issue=5|pages=345–355|doi=10.1163/15685373-12342130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reputations related to trustworthiness can be significantly based on adherence to ritual behavior expectations,&lt;ref name="purz11"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Purzycki|first1=Benjamin Grant|title=Tyvan                            and the socioecological constraints of supernatural agents' minds|journal=Religion, Brain &amp; Behavior|date=February 2011|volume=1|issue=1|pages=31–45|doi=10.1080/2153599X.2010.550723}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fulfillment of these expectations are often a joint function of other behavioral strategies relevant to separate domains of gods' concerns.&lt;ref name="purzinpress" /&gt; More broadly, religious costly signals are an implicit expression of honest commitment to the rest of the group, indicating that the signaler is a dedicated part of other aspect of the group's coordinated solution strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bulbulia|first1=Joseph|last2=Sosis|first2=Richard|title=Signalling theory and the evolution of religious cooperation|journal=Religion|date=September 2011|volume=41|issue=3|pages=363–388|doi=10.1080/0048721X.2011.604508}}&lt;/ref&gt; In small- and large-scale societies alike, these rituals often coexist with other categories of gods' concerns.

=== Resource management ===
Resource management and the prevention of material insecurity are more commonly associated with gods' concerns among small-scale societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McNamara|first1=Rita Anne|last2=Norenzayan|first2=Ara|last3=Henrich|first3=Joseph|title=Supernatural punishment, in-group biases, and material insecurity: experiments and ethnography from Yasawa, Fiji|journal=Religion, Brain &amp; Behavior|date=18 June 2014|volume=6|issue=1|pages=34–55|doi=10.1080/2153599X.2014.921235}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="purz13"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=PurzyckI|first1=Benjamin Grant|title=Toward a Cognitive Ecology of Religious Concepts: Evidence from the Tyva Republic|journal=Journal for the Cognitive Science of Religion|date=13 August 2012|volume=1|issue=1|doi=10.1558/jcsr.v1i1.99}}&lt;/ref&gt; While other aspects of religious belief often address social interactions, problems of resource acquisition and security extend from attributed gods' concerns about peoples' interactions with their natural environment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; An example of this effect has been alluded to by anthropologist [[Marvin Harris]], who wrote about the economic reasons that [[Hindu]] beliefs, holding cows as sacred and forbidden from slaughter, were adaptive. According to Harris, the long-standing and stable benefits derived from many Hindu peoples' use of cows for labor and sources of fuel and fertilizer seemed to outweigh the costs of not eating them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=Marvin|title=Cows, pigs, wars, &amp; witches : the riddles of culture|date=1989|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=0679724680|edition=Vintage Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another ethnographic example of an adaptive use of animal resources was described by [[Roy Rappaport]] in 1984, who considered the reasons for ritual pig sacrifice in [[Papua New Guinea]] during times of intergroup conflict. These pigs were consuming local peoples' resources and creating resource insecurities that put a strain on the local groups, escalating the intergroup competition for resources and fueling their conflict. Thus, the ritualistic sacrifices alleviated the strain on local resources and mitigated the hostilities between groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rappaport|first1=Roy Abraham|title=Pigs for the ancestors : ritual in the ecology of a New Guinea people|date=2000|publisher=Waveland Press|location=Prospect Heights, Il.|isbn=978-1577661016|edition=2.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, [[human behavioral ecology]] researchers have more recently studied burning practices among the Australian [[Martu people]] and the consequential increases in local biodiversity. These authors, in an ethnographic discussion of the Martu people, note that these burning practices stem from religious beliefs that their practices allow the world to continue existing as they know it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bird|first1=R. B.|last2=Tayor|first2=N.|last3=Codding|first3=B. F.|last4=Bird|first4=D. W.|title=Niche construction and Dreaming logic: aboriginal patch mosaic burning and varanid lizards (Varanus gouldii) in Australia|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=23 October 2013|volume=280|issue=1772|pages=20132297–20132297|doi=10.1098/rspb.2013.2297|pmc=3813344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another ethnographic example of religious beliefs facilitating resource management comes from the [[Tuva people|Tyva people]], a pastoralist population in southern [[Siberia]]. They associate ritual structures called cairns with local spirit masters (''cher eezi''). These structures demarcate local territories in which spirit masters reside, and the expectation to stop and give prayer offerings out of respect to ''cher eezi'' is embedded in peoples' beliefs about them. The ''cher eezi'' are believed to be amoral and care mostly about activity within their sacred territories, such as hunting and overexploiting resources that belong to them.&lt;ref name="purz11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="purz13" /&gt; More recently, Tyva people have begun facing new challenges associated with urbanization (e.g., pollution, alcohol abuse), and the ''cher eezi'' have been more frequently believed to be concerned about these same problems.&lt;ref name="purzinpress" /&gt;

'''Developmental stage theories''' are theories that divide [[child development]] into distinct stages which are characterized by qualitative differences in behaviour.&lt;ref name = Hayslip&gt;Hayslip, Bert JR., et al. (2006). Developmental Stage Theories. Chapter in:Michel Hersen &amp; Jay C. Thomas (ed): ''Comprehensive Handbook Of Personality and Psychopathology.'' Retrieved October 14, 2012 [http://www.arseba.org/Library/Psychology%20Complete/Research-Psychology/Abnormal%20psychology/Psychopathology/COMPREHENSIVE%20HANDBOOK%20OF%20PERSONALITY%20AND%20PSYCHOPATHOLOGY%20VOLUME%201%20PERSONALITY%20AND%20EVERYDAY%20FUNCTIONING%20-%20Jay%20C.%20Thomas.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of different views about the way in which psychological and physical development proceed throughout the life span.  In addition to individual differences in development, developmental psychologists generally agree that development occurs in an orderly way and in different areas simultaneously.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Grivas J. &amp; Carter L. "Psychology for South Australia Stage I"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Continuous versus discontinuous development ==
One of the major controversies in [[developmental psychology]] centres  whether development is continuous or discontinuous. 
Those psychologists who support the ''continuous'' view of development suggest that development involves gradual and ongoing changes throughout the life span, with behaviour in the earlier stages of development providing the basis of skills and abilities required for the next stages.

Not all psychologists, however, agree that development is a continuous process.  Some view development as a ''discontinuous'' process.  They believe development involves distinct and separate stages with different kinds of behaviour occurring in each stage.  This suggests that the development of certain abilities in each stage, such as specific emotions or ways of thinking, have a definite starting and ending point.  However, there is no exact time at which an ability suddenly appears or disappears.  Although some types of thinking, feeling or behaving may seem to appear suddenly, it is more than likely that this has been developing gradually for some time.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Stage theories of development rest on the assumption that development is a discontinuous process involving distinct ''stages'' which are characterized by qualitative differences in behaviour. They also assume that the structure of the stages is not variable according to each individual, however the time of each stage may vary individually.&lt;ref name = Hayslip /&gt; Stage theories can be contrasted with continuous theories, which posit that development is an incremental process.&lt;ref name = "White"&gt;White, F., Hayes, B., &amp; Livesey, D. (2005). ''Developmental Psychology: From Infancy to Adulthood.'' NSW:Pearson Education Australia&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples of stage theories ==
There are many stage (discontinuous) theories in developmental psychology including:

*[[Sigmund Freud]]'s [[Psychosexual development|psychosexual stages]] described the progression of an individual's unconscious desires.
*[[Clare W. Graves]]' [[Spiral dynamics|emergent cyclic levels of existence theory]].
*[[Judith Rich Harris]]' [[No Two Alike: Human Nature and Human Individuality|modular theory of social development]].
*[[Robert Kegan]]'s subject–object constructive developmental theory.
*[[Lawrence Kohlberg]]'s [[Kohlberg's stages of moral development|stages of moral development]] described how individuals developed moral reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kohlberg|first=L.|title=The Measurement of Moral Judgement|year=1987|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|authorlink=Lawrence Kohlberg |isbn=0-521-32565-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Maria Montessori]]'s [[Montessori education#Planes of development|planes of development]].

While some of these theories focus primarily on the healthy development of children, others propose stages that are characterized by a maturity rarely reached before old age.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25580">'''Double-mindedness''' has been preached about in all churches since the time of [[Christ]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} and the term was used in the [[Bible]] by the [[James, brother of Jesus|Apostle James]].&lt;ref&gt;"Consider it all joy, my brethren, when you encounter various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance. And let endurance have its perfect result, so that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing. But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all generously and without reproach, and it will be given to him. But he must ask in faith without any doubting, for the one who doubts is like the surf of the sea, driven and tossed by the wind. For that man ought not to expect that he will receive anything from the Lord, being a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways. But the brother of humble circumstances is to glory in his high position; and the rich man is to glory in his humiliation, because like flowering grass he will pass away. For the sun rises with a scorching wind and withers the grass; and its flower falls off and the beauty of its appearance is destroyed; so too the rich man in the midst of his pursuits will fade away. ''James'' 1:2-11&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;Keep near to God, then he will keep near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded." — ''James'' 4:8; [[Søren Kierkegaard]], ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; [[Denmark|Danish]] philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]] (1813–1855) developed his own systematic way to try to detect double-mindedness in himself.

==In Kierkegaard==
Kierkegaard asked himself:  Do I want to be a Christian or not? Do I want to be a preacher or not? Do I want to be a teacher or not? Do I want to get married or not?  All these questions have to do with the future. Many were willing to give him advice but he felt the decision was ultimately his own. Individuals fear making a decision because of external opposition but this need not stop one from making a decision so long as one has the capacity to learn through experience whether the decision was a good decision for one's self.

David F. Swenson was born in [[Sweden]] October 29, 1876 and his family moved to America in 1882. He became a professor of philosophy at the [[University of Minnesota]] in 1917 and was very interested in the writings of Søren Kierkegaard. He ended up translating many of his books into English. At the time, America's human population was increasing and the same question asked in the [[Psalms]] was asked by people like David Swenson: "''How shall we sing the Lord's song in a strange land?''" (Psalms 137:4). Below are several quotes from Kierkegaard's book, ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', published on March 13, 1847 where he tried to answer that question.

&lt;blockquote&gt;There were brazen teachers of brazenness who thought that justice was to do wrong on a large scale and then to be able to make it appear that one nevertheless willed the good. Thus they had, so they thought, double advantage, the wretched advantage of being able to do wrong, of being able to have their will, of letting their passions rage, and the hypocritical advantage of seeming to be good. But in ancient times there was also a simple wise man whose simplicity became a trap for the quibbling of the brazen; he taught that in order to be really sure that it was the good one willed, one should avoid even appearing to be good-presumably lest the reward should be tempting. ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', Hong p. 37&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''[[File:The good samaritan (after Delacroix).jpg|thumb|right|130px|[[Parable of the Good Samaritan|The Good Samaritan]]]]What is your frame of mind toward others''? Are you in harmony with everyone-by willing one thing? Or are you divisively in a faction, or are you at loggerheads with everyone and everyone with you? Do you want for everyone what you want for yourself, or do you want the highest for yourself, for yourself and for yours, or that you and yours shall be highest? Do you [[Golden Rule|do unto others]] what you want others to do to you-by willing one thing? This willing is the eternal order that orders everything, that brings you in harmony with the dead and with the people you never saw, with strange people whose language and customs you do not know, with all the people on the whole earth, who are blood relatives and eternally related to divinity by eternity's task to will one thing. Do you want a different law for yourself and for yours than for others; do you want to have your comfort in something different from that in which every human being unconditionally can and will be comforted? If a king and a beggar and one of your peers came to you at the same time, would you in their presence dare with bold confidence to assert what you want in the world, with bold confidence to assert wherein you seek your comfort, positive that his Royal Majesty would not disdain you even though you are an inferior, positive that the beggar would not go away disheartened as if he could not have the same comfort, positive that your peer would rejoice in your bold confidence! Alas, there is something in the world called an alliance; it is a dangerous thing, because all alliances are divisiveness. It is divisive when the alliance excludes the commoner, and when it excludes the nobleman, and when it excludes the government worker, and when it excludes the king, and when it excludes the beggar, and when it excludes the wise, and when it excludes the simple soul-because all alliances are divisiveness in opposition to the universally human. But to will one thing, to will the good in truth, to will as a single individual to be allied with God-something unconditionally everyone can do-that is harmony. ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', Hong p. 144&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first type of double-mindedness, that of willing for the sake of reward or out of fear of punishment, is akin to the distinction between [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic and extrinsic values]]. The second type of double-mindedness, that of willing only to a certain degree, is akin to distraction or half-hearted willing. Each type of double-mindedness is a human weakness and an obstacle to an individual pursuit of greatness and strength towards willing and reaching the Good.&lt;ref&gt;Hannay, Alastair. ''Kierkegaard'', Routledge, pp. 220–225.&lt;/ref&gt; To counter double-mindedness, Kierkegaard argues that discipline and clarity of the [[Self (philosophy)|self]] is essential and necessary to overcome double-mindedness. Double-mindedness isn't something evil but not recognizing that you, yourself, are a self-contradiction and double-minded is self-deceit.

Kierkegaard constantly writes about "willing the Good" but he does not go so far as to tell the single individual, ''my reader'', what the Good is, because, as far as Kierkegaard was concerned, the Good is something that each individual finds by living life and believing that God creates purposefully. He asks the individual to consider whether or not his or her life is a contradiction. Does the individual see the Good and the reward or the Good and the punishment? Only the individual involved in the task of living knows and when it is found you might not be able to explain to anyone why you think it is a Good.

===Expert knowers===
[[File:Nietzsche187c.jpg|thumb|right|130px|Friedrich Nietzsche around 1869 spoke of [[Übermensch]]]]
Is there a way for an individual to choose a career and have certainty that the career will offer the same rewards others have been given? Is there a marriage which will offer, with certainty, happy love between the beloved? Both Kierkegaard and [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] were interested in these questions. Are there certain gifted individuals who know if you should marry or become a minister or a journalist or a philologist or is it something you should perhaps speak to God about and yourself? Nietzsche thinks the [[ethicist]] can help the person find the good. Kierkegaard said, "the ethicist can tell a person it's her duty to marry but the ethicist can in no way tell her whom she should marry."&lt;ref&gt;Søren Kierkegaard, Either/Or part II Hong pp. 301–302&lt;/ref&gt; Kierkegaard questioned the supposition that anyone had a "duty" to marry. He was against people becoming "soul experts"&lt;ref&gt;Four Upbuilding Discourses, 1844 (Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses, Hong p. 172ff, 365ff&lt;/ref&gt; and "expert knowers of love".&lt;ref&gt;Søren Kierkegaard, Words of Love, Hong p. 15, 230-231 &lt;/ref&gt; But can an individual be an expert knower of him or her self? Nietzsche says no, {{Quotation|Vanity is the involuntary inclination to set one's self up for an individual while not really being one; that is to say, trying to appear independent when one is dependent. The case of wisdom is the exact contrary: it appears to be dependent while in reality it is independent. Friedrich Nietzsche, [[Axiom]] 13 ''We Philologists''.}}

Kierkegaard made an analogy to this idea of taking knowledge and putting it into practice in his 1845 book, ''Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions'' (Hong 1993),  also translated as ''Thoughts on Crucial Situations in Human Life'' (Swenson 1941). He questions if knowledge has any importance at all without making use of it in daily life: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Let us imagine a pilot, and assume that he had passed every examination with distinction, but that he had not as yet been at sea. Imagine him in a storm; he knows everything he ought to do, but he has not known before how terror grips the seafarer when the stars are lost in the blackness of the night; he has not known the sense of impotence that comes when the pilot sees the wheel in his hand become a plaything for the waves; he has not known how the blood rushes to the head when one tries to make calculations at such a moment; in short, he has had no conception of the change that takes place in the knower when he has to apply his knowledge. What fair weather is to the sailor, that for the ordinary person is to live at the same pace with others and with the race, but the moment of decision, the dangerous moment of reflection when he takes himself out of the environment to be alone before God, to become a sinner, this is the stillness that upsets the customary order like a storm at sea. He knew all this, knew what would happen to him, but he did not know how anxiety would seize him, as he felt himself deserted in the manifold wherein he has his soul; he did not know how the heart beats when help from others, and the guidance from others, and the standards and the distractions afforded by others, vanish in the stillness; he did not know the trembling of the soul, when it is too late to shout for human aid, since no one can hear him: in short, he had no idea of how knowledge is changed when he needs to apply it."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Is this perhaps your case, my reader? I do not judge, I merely ask you. Alas, while the number of those who know so much increases more and more, the really able men become fewer and fewer! But it was such a man that you once wished to be. You have surely not forgotten what we said about sincerity: that a man must retain a clear recollection of what he once wished to be; and now you are to prove your sincerity before God in the confession of sins. What was it you once wished? You wished to strive after the highest ideals, to apprehend the truth and dwell in it; you would spare neither time nor effort; you would renounce everything, including every illusion. If you did attain the highest goal, you wanted to make sure of being clearly conscious of what you had formerly meant in striving to attain it. If this was ever so little, you would rather be faithful over a little than unfaithful over much. If this was your sole thought, and you became the poorest of all in the midst of the rich who know everything, you would rather still be as true as gold-and this is in the power of everyone who wills it, for gold is for the rich, but a golden loyalty is possible also for the poor. And he who was faithful over a little, faithful in the day of trial, when the reckoning is made in the stillness where no reward beckons, but only the guilt becomes clear, faithful in this sincerity which acknowledges everything, even the imperfection of the sincerity, faithful in the love that repents, the humble love whose demand is for self-accusation: he shall also be made ruler over more. Was not this what you wished? For we are agreed that in relation to the essential, knowing it is essentially identical with the ability to do it."
* Soren Kierkegaard, ''Thoughts on Crucial Situation in Human Life'', 1845, Swenson translation 1941 pp. 35–37&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Kierkegaard wrote much about the validity of marriage in all his books with this same idea in mind. Again, you can know everything in an objective way about marriage but its only when you actually decide to get married that you stand alone with your spouse and live the married life. He says, "It is told that [[Socrates]] is supposed to have answered someone who asked him about marriage: Marry or do not marry-you will regret both. Socrates was an [[irony|ironist]] who presumably concealed his wisdom and truth ironically lest it become local gossip, but he was not a mocker. The questioner's stupidity lies precisely in asking a third person for something one can never learn from a third person." The Good is always a good gift from God: {{Quotation|Marriage likes deserters just as little as it allows one to serve two masters. Solomon puts it beautifully when he says that he who finds a wife finds a good thing and obtains a good gift from God-or, to modernize the saying a bit, to him who falls in love, the god has been gracious. If he marries the beloved, he does a good deed and does well to finish what he has begun.&lt;ref&gt;''Stages on Life's Way'', Hong pp. 155–156&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He put it this way in [[Judge for Yourselves!]]: {{Quotation|In newspapers, in books, from pulpits, from podia, and in assemblies there is a solemnity, a pomposity-a pomposity that suggests that everything revolves around spirit, around truth, around thought. Perhaps it does, too, perhaps. But perhaps everything nevertheless revolves around the job, around the career, perhaps. Is it the job, the career, that inspires the theological graduate, or is it Christianity? No one knows. He accepts the job, he ''maintains'' that it is Christianity. Is it the job, the career, that inspires the graduate, or is it scholarship? No one knows. He accepts the job, becomes a professor, he ''maintains'' that it is scholarship. Is it the number of subscribers that inspires the journalist or is it the task? No one knows. He amasses subscriptions, he ''maintains'' that it is the task. Is it love of the masses that motivates someone to place himself at the head of the masses? No one knows. He accepts the advantage of standing at the head of this force-that is apparent; he ''maintains'' that it is out of love. Søren Kierkegaard, ''For Self-Examination/Judge for Yourselves!'', Hong 1990 pp. 123–124}}

{{Quotation|"What a wonderful expression [[Georg Christoph Lichtenberg|Lichtenberg]] proposes, "the simple phrase, 'graduate student prose', to describe the writing pattern of those who write in a fatuous popular style ordinary everyday thoughts which at best express what sensible people have already thought." Journals and Papers II A 124}}

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] questioned why individuals choose a career in his 1872 book, ''We Philologists''.  {{Quotation|On inquiring into the origin of the [[philologist]] I find:
# A young man cannot have the slightest conception of what the Greeks and Romans were.
# He does not know whether he is fitted to investigate into them;
# And, in particular, he does not know to what extent, in view of the knowledge he may actually possess, he is fitted to be a teacher. What then enables him to decide is not the knowledge of himself or his science; but
*(a) imitation
*(b) The convenience of carrying on a kind of work which he had begun at school.
*(c) His intention of earning a living.
In short, ninety-nine philologists out of a hundred should not be philologists at all.
*Friedrich Nietzsche, ''We Philologists'', 1872, Editor: Oscar Levy, Translated 1911&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/wephilologists18267gut/18267.txt ''We Philologists''] at Gutenberg&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Can the effectiveness of a minister, journalist, professor, be quantified? How does anyone really know when something said had a great effect for good or for evil? Kierkegaard believed in the power of the single individual but didn't leave out others since no individual is stronger than himself. All individuals "create in the innermost being temptations of glory and temptations of fear and temptations of despondency, of pride and of defiance and of sensuality greater than those we meet in the external world, and this is the very reason we struggle with ourselves."&lt;ref&gt;Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses, p. 320&lt;/ref&gt; The struggle is a good struggle as long as the "task" is maintained in its proper place. Not to know what a minister is, but to become and be a minister, not to know what a journalist is, but to become and be a journalist, not to know what a professor is, but to become and be a professor, etc. He didn't want to intrude in another's growth in the direction of religion because, Christianly speaking, "The difficulty is not to understand what Christianity is but to become and be a Christian." The task isn't to know what the good is or the beauty or the true but to become the good, the beauty and the true God meant you to become.&lt;ref&gt;''Concluding Postscript'', Hong pp. 557–559&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote this in 1846: {{Quotation|There is nothing, no ‘thus and so,’ that can unconditionally be said to demonstrate unconditionally the presence of love or to demonstrate unconditionally its absence. Truly, love is to be known by its fruit, but still it does not follow from this that you are to take it upon yourself to be the expert knower. Søren Kierkegaard, ''Works of Love'' 1847, Hong pp. 14–15}}

{{Quotation|A person can very well eat lettuce before it has formed a heart, but the tender delicacy of the heart and its lovely coil are something quite different from the leaves. It is the same in the world of the spirit. Busyness makes it almost impossible for an individual to form a heart; on the other hand, the thinker, the poet, the religious person who has actually formed his heart never becomes popular, not because he is difficult but because a quiet and protracted occupation and intimacy with himself and a remoteness go along with it. Even if I could raise my voice and say something of which everybody would approve, I would not say it if it was of a religious nature, because there already is a kind of religious impropriety if the main point is to cry aloud; for religiousness the main point is to speak quite softly and with oneself. Ah, it gets so turned around! We think that religiousness, instead of being a matter of every individuals going alone into his private room to talk quietly with himself, is a matter of talking very loudly.
*Søren Kierkegaard, Journals and Papers II 1995 (Pap. VII 1A205) 1846 (''Works of Love'', Hong p. 407)}}

====Pride and cowardliness====
Søren Kierkegaard wrote his ''[[Four Upbuilding Discourses, 1844|Four Upbuilding Discourses]]'' on August 31, 1844. One of them was named ''Against Cowardliness'' and he used the Bible verse from 2 Timothy 1.17 ''For God did not give us a spirit of timidity but a spirit of power and love and self-control.'' He says, "we creep before we learn to walk, and to want to fly is always precarious."&lt;ref&gt;Against Cowardliness; ''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses, Hong'' pp. 347–348 The Discourse is 28 pages long 347–375&lt;/ref&gt; Many people, Christians included, make great resolutions and then just imagine that they will come about by the help of God, but "striving" is needed if one wants to try to do a "[[Summum bonum|good]]" thing, called "the highest good" by [[philosophers]]. Kierkegaard asks about the lowest thing a person can do, isn't that a highest good for that single individual?

Christianity presents a goal which Kierkegaard calls an eternal happiness and Christ called "Paradise". Jesus said, "Verily I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise." or it might be "Verily I say to you today, you will be with me in Paradise." (Luke 23.43) to the [[thief on the cross]].&lt;ref&gt;See Soren Kierkegaard, Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits, (1847) Hong translation p. 265ff&lt;/ref&gt; The goal was very close for the thief but might not be so close for the single individual who wants to be a Christian. Kierkegaard asks why the Christian should not set a few intermediate goals that can be accomplished before the eternal happiness arrives. One does not have to start with saving the world. Kierkegaard suggested exploring the relationship between [[pride]] and [[cowardliness]] to see if one of these two [[Passion (emotion)|passions]] is keeping you from reaching intermediate goals. He has advice for goal setters. Stop talking and start! Don't worry so much about the outcome. Set a goal for yourself and try to reach it. It's alright if you fail because you can start again immediately. If you need help, ask someone. But this goal should be something in particular, something concrete, so that your passions can be aroused. If Christianity is the task then it's a task that lasts a lifetime. 

{{Quotation|... the good, the truly great and noble is not just something in general and as such the general object of knowledge; it is also something particular in relation to the individual’s particular talent, so that one person is [[wikt:ability|capable]] of more than another, so that one person is capable of it in one way, another in another.  The talent itself is not the good, talent is the indifferent that nevertheless has its importance. If the capability is exceptional, then cowardliness says, “When one is so equipped, there certainly is no rush about beginning. This is such an easy thing to do; take your time, take a little loss: the expert player likes to begin when the game is half lost. I know it so well; right now I am idly hanging fire, but shortly, soon now, I will really get under way” How proudly cowardliness does talk! What does it mean to say that the task is too easy-it means that it is difficult, and by calling something more difficult, cowardliness has brought the person choosing to choose that which in the eyes of the world seems to be hardest but is the easier task. In other words, it is more difficult to begin quietly because it is less prestigious, and this bit of humiliation is precisely the difficulty. Consequently, it was not pride but cowardliness that was the counselor. Everyone knows that the moment of danger gives a person greater strength, but note well to what extent and in what way one is thereby greater. Is it such a great thing, after all, to need to have the terror of danger in order to muster one’s strength, not to mention that the opposite could also occur, that the terror would certainly be there, but the strength would vanish. It was so easy that he could not resolve to begin. It was proud, but it was cowardly, because actually he was afraid that what he had let himself call a trifle might not turn out to be exactly that, and then he would be in the awkward position of being obliged to feel his own weakness without confronting the colossal name of the supreme terror, of being obliged to stand there in disgrace, deprived of every brilliant exit. Or the capability is slight. Then cowardliness says, “This is too little to begin with.” It is very fatuous, indeed, even foolish, to say this, because if one does not have more to begin with, it must indeed always be enough, and the less one begins with the greater one becomes; but cowardliness, you see, has won sagacity over to its side, and sagacity declares that this is absolutely right, because the person who begins nothing does not lose anything either. Sagacity of that sort is certainly something of which to be proud, and pride has already discerned that rejecting everything is a much prouder thing than beginning with little, and this the person can do who rejects the little offered to him and in addition everything that was not offered to him at all. It seems proud, but cowardliness was, after all, the original inventor. Søren Kierkegaard, ''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'', Hong pp. 358–359}}

'''Elena Ramírez Parra''' (born 1972) is a Spanish botanist who won a [[L'Oréal-UNESCO Awards for Women in Science]] in 2010. She studies the negative effects that produce [[environmental stress]] (drought, salinity of the soil, excess radiation, presence of [[heavy metals]] and the high and low temperatures). Her goal is to improve harvests.

==Life==
Ramírez studied biological sciences at the [[Autonomous University of Madrid]] and a doctorate in [[molecular biology]] from the same university (2000).

She became a senior researcher at the Centre for Plant Biotechnology and Genomics (Centro de Biotecnología y Genómica de Plantas, CBGP) of the National Instituto Nacional de Investigación y Tecnología Agraria y Alimentaria (INIA) and the [[Technical University of Madrid]] (UPM), studying the negative effects that produce environmental stress in plants.&lt;ref name=cbgp&gt;{{cite web|title=GENETIC AND MOLECULAR ANALYSIS OF CROP NATURAL VARIATION IN FRUIT QUALITY TRAITS |url=http://www.cbgp.upm.es/en/analisis_natural.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her investigation characterises the mechanisms that plants use to respond to external stresses like drought, soil salinity, heavy metals and extreme temperatures. She tries to create a generation of new varieties that will improve harvests.&lt;ref name="lo"&gt;[http://www.culturabiotec.com/2011/02/prada/ La investigación “se viste de Prada”], 2011, culturabiotec.com, Retrieved 13 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In the course of her career, she has published many scientific articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Elena_Ramirez-Parra|title=Elena Ramirez-Parra - Dr. - Instituto Nacional de Investigación y Tecnología Agraria y Alimentaria, Madrid - INIA - CBGP- Centre of Biotechnology and Genomics in Plants|last2=|first2=|date=|website=ResearchGate|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cbgp /&gt;

In November 2010, she was awarded, with four scientists ([[Isabel Lastres Becker]], [[Ana Briones Alonso]], [[Mercedes Vila]] and [[María Antonia Herrero]]), the [[L'Oréal-UNESCO Awards for Women in Science]]. This endowment of €15000 is to reward the work of women scientists younger than 40.&lt;ref name="lo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pais"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://elpais.com/sociedad/2010/11/18/actualidad/1290034810_850215.html|title=Cinco científicas de la vida españolas reciben las becas L'Oréal-Unesco|first=|last=M.R.E|date=18 November 2010|publisher=|via=elpais.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File: European Glass Experience (logo).jpg|thumb|European Glass Experience Logo]]
'''European Glass Experience''' is a project coordinated by the City of [[Venice]] in collaboration with Consorzio Promovetro Murano and the [[Murano Glass Museum]]. It represents an international celebration of contemporary glass art and, most of all, of its makers.

==The project==
EGE was officially launched on September 11, 2013 during a press conference at [[Ca' Farsetti]] in [[Venice]], and its aim is to valorise the glass art on a European level, and to promote the works of local and international young artists. European Glass Experience was established to reinforce glass production and to improve the artistic heritage of traditional glass working experience. The project has among its partners The Finnish Glass Museum, [[Riihimaki]], [[Finland]], and the Fundación Centro Nacional del Vidrio, La Granja de San Idelfonso, [[Segovia]], [[Spain]]. Associated partners are the Glass Factory in Boda Glasbruk, [[Sweden]], the Muzeum Witrazu (Stained Glass Museum) in [[Krakow]], the International Festival of Glass in [[Stourbridge]], [[England]] and the Glass Museum of Marinha Grande (Portugal). European Glass Experience project is co-financed by a prestigious two-year grant from the Culture Program 2007 – 2013 of the [[European Union]]. The project will last two years, and it is composed by an exhibition which will take place in three different museums, divided into two sections: 40 unreleased glass artworks and 20 sketches which will become artworks, realised by Promovetro’s Murano glass masters.

==The exhibition==

The exhibition began at The Finnish Glass Museum, Riihimaki, Finland, in March 2014, curated by Uta Laurén, and then continued to the Fundación Centro Nacional del Vidrio, Spain, under the directorship of Paloma Pastor. The final venue will be the Murano Glass Museum, directed by Chiara Squarcina in March 2015. Further additional venues, among the associated partners, will possibly follow. European Glass Experience team panel, made of museum directors, curators, and glass experts, selected nearly 80 sketches and artworks, coming from young artists of different cultures. Murano Glass masters associated with Promovetro are going to realize a selection of the most peculiar sketches in glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://egeglass.eu/|title=EGE - European Glass Experience}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Feminism sidebar |expanded=Concepts}}
There exists a diversity of views on [[prostitution]]. Many of these positions can be loosely arranged into an overarching standpoint that is generally either critical or supportive  of prostitution and [[sex work]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O’Neill |first=Maggie |year=2001 |title=Prostitution and Feminism |publisher=Polity Press |location=Cambridge |pages=14–16 |isbn=978-0-7456-1204-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Red Light District.jpg|thumb|The Red Light district in Amsterdam]]

Anti-prostitution feminists hold that prostitution is a form of exploitation of women and male dominance over women, and a practice which is the result of the existing patriarchal societal order. These feminists argue that prostitution has a very negative effect, both on the prostitutes themselves and on society as a whole, as it reinforces stereotypical views about women, who are seen as sex objects which can be used and abused by men.

Pro-prostitution feminists hold that prostitution and other forms of [[sex work]] can be valid choices for women and men who choose to engage in it. In this view, prostitution must be differentiated from [[forced prostitution]], and feminists should support [[sex workers' rights|sex worker activism]] against abuses by both the sex industry and the legal system.

The disagreement between these two feminist stances has proven particularly contentious, and may be comparable to the [[feminist sex wars]] (acrimonious debates on sex issues) of the late twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Alexander |first=Priscilla |year=1997 |chapter=Feminism, Sex Workers and Human Rights |editor-last=Nagle |editor-first=Jill |title=Whores and Other Feminists |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |pages=83–90 |isbn=978-0-415-91821-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Framing the debate ==

Newman and White in Women, Politics and Public Policy argue that [[feminist]] perspectives on [[prostitution]] agree on three main points: “First, they condemn the current legal policy enforcing [[criminal]] sanctions against women who offer sex in exchange for money. Second, they agree that authentic consent is the [[sine qua non]] of legitimate sex, whether in commercial or non-commercial form. Third, all feminists recognize that commercial sex workers are subject to economic coercion and are often victims of violence, and that little is done to address these problems.”&lt;ref name=NewmanWhite-2012&gt;{{cite book |last=Newman and White |title=Women Power and Public Policy |year=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0195432497}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|247}}

They go on to identify three main feminist views on the issue of prostitution. The sex work perspective, the abolitionist perspective and the outlaw perspective. The sex work perspective maintains that prostitution is a legitimate form of work for women faced with the option of other bad jobs, therefore women ought to have the right to work in the sex trade free of prosecution or the fear of it. The sex work perspective also argues that governments should eliminate laws that criminalize voluntary prostitution. This, the sex work perspective asserts, will allow prostitution to be regulated by governments and business codes, protect sex trade workers, and improve the ability to prosecute people who hurt them. The Abolitionist perspective holds that governments should work towards the elimination of prostitution. The Outlaw Perspective views work in the sex trade as a “stepping stone to a better career or an expression of sexual freedom”.&lt;ref name=NewmanWhite-2012 /&gt;{{rp|248}}

==Arguments against prostitution==
A proportion of feminists are strongly opposed to prostitution,  as they see the practice as a form of violence against women, which should not be tolerated by society. Feminists who hold such views on prostitution include [[Kathleen Barry]], [[Melissa Farley]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prostitutionresearch.com/faq/000008.html Prostitution: Factsheet on Human Rights Violations].

[[File:Phone box prostitute calling cards 1.jpg|thumb|Advertisements for prostitutes fill a phone booth]]

===Coercion and poverty===
{{See also|Survival sex}}
These feminists do argue that, in most cases, prostitution is not a conscious and calculated choice. They say that most women who become prostitutes do so because they were forced or coerced by a pimp or by human trafficking, or, when it is an independent decision, it is generally the result of extreme poverty and lack of opportunity, or of serious underlying problems, such as drug addiction, past trauma (such as child sexual abuse) and other unfortunate circumstances.

These feminists point out that women from the lowest socioeconomic classes—impoverished women, women with a low level of education, women from the most disadvantaged racial and ethnic minorities—are overrepresented in prostitution all over the world. "If prostitution is a free choice, why are the women with the fewest choices the ones most often found doing it?".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N48y66ArkIcC&amp;pg=PA159 |title=Women's Lives, Men's Laws |author=MacKinnon, Catharine A. |isbn=9780674024069 |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large percentage of prostitutes polled in one study of 475 people involved in prostitution reported that they were in a difficult period of their lives and most wanted to leave the occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Farley, Melissa. (April/2/2000) [http://www.prostitutionresearch.com/faq/000008.html Prostitution: Factsheet on Human Rights Violations]. Prostitution Research &amp; Education. Retrieved on 2009-09-03.&lt;/ref&gt;
Catharine MacKinnon argues that "In prostitution, women have sex with men they would never otherwise have sex with. The money thus acts as a form of force, not as a measure of consent. It acts like physical force does in rape."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpbn.org/program/intelligence-squared/episode/its-wrong-pay-sex |title=It's Wrong to Pay for Sex |date=5 August 2009 |website= |publisher=Connecticut Public Radio |accessdate=8 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625230257/http://www.cpbn.org/program/intelligence-squared/episode/its-wrong-pay-sex |archivedate=25 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some anti-prostitution scholars hold that true consent in prostitution is not possible. Barbara Sullivan says, "In the academic literature on prostitution there are very few authors who argue that valid consent to prostitution is possible. Most suggest that consent to prostitution is impossible or at least unlikely.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apsa2000.anu.edu.au/confpapers/sullivan.rtf |title=Rethinking Prostitution and 'Consent' |author=SULLIVAN, Barbara |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2010-05-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090914105702/http://apsa2000.anu.edu.au/confpapers/sullivan.rtf |archivedate=2009-09-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  "(...) most authors suggest that consent to prostitution is deeply problematic if not impossible (...) most authors have argued that consent to prostitution is impossible. For radical feminists this is because prostitution is always a coercive sexual practice. Others simply suggest that economic coercion makes the sexual consent of sex workers highly problematic if not impossible...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FSjEnDrb8QcC&amp;pg=PA127 |title=Making sense of sexual consent |author1=De Mark Cowling |author2= Paul Reynolds |accessdate=2010-05-09|isbn=9780754636878 |year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, abolitionists believe no person can be said to truly consent to their own oppression and no people should have the right to consent to the oppression of others.  In the words of [[Kathleen Barry]], consent is not a “good divining rod as to the existence of oppression, and consent to violation is a fact of oppression.  Oppression cannot effectively be gauged according to the degree of “consent,” since even in slavery there was some consent, if consent is defined as inability to see any alternative.&lt;ref name="Barry"&gt;Barry, K "The Prostitution of Sexuality: The Global Exploitation of Women" New York: NYU Press 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

===Long-term effects on the prostitutes===
Anti-prostitution feminists argue that prostitution is a practice which leads to serious negative long-term effects for the prostitutes, such as trauma, stress, depression, anxiety, self-medication through alcohol and drug use, eating disorders and a greater risk for self-harm and suicide, as they say prostitution is an exploitative practice, which involves a woman who has sex with customers to whom she is not attracted, and which also routinely exposes the women to psychological, physical and sexual violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ruhama.ie/easyedit/files/Ruhama-NextStep-6.pdf|title=Factors affecting prostitution – Damage and survival mechanisms|publisher=|date=|accessdate=2010-05-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410140946/http://www.ruhama.ie/easyedit/files/Ruhama-NextStep-6.pdf|archivedate=2011-04-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parker, Joe.

[[Andrea Dworkin]] stated her opinions as: "Prostitution in and of itself is an abuse of a woman's body. Those of us who say this are accused of being simple-minded. But prostitution is very simple. (…) In prostitution, no woman stays whole. It is impossible to use a human body in the way women's bodies are used in prostitution and to have a whole human being at the end of it, or in the middle of it, or close to the beginning of it. It's impossible. And no woman gets whole again later, after.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/MichLawJourI.html |title=Prostitution and Male Supremacy (1 of 2) |publisher=Nostatusquo.com |date=1992-10-31 |author=Andrea Dworkin |accessdate=2010-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Male dominance over women===
Anti-prostitution feminists are extremely critical of [[sex-positive]] perspectives, wherein prostitution by choice is said to be part of the sexual liberation of women, that it can be empowering for women, etc.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Some feminists who oppose prostitution agree that sexual liberation for women outside of prostitution is important in the fight for [[gender equality]], but they say it is crucial that society does not replace one patriarchal view on female sexuality - e.g., that women should not have sex outside marriage/a relationship and that casual sex is shameful for a woman, etc. - with another similarly oppressive and patriarchal view - acceptance of prostitution, a sexual practice which is based on a highly patriarchal construct of sexuality: that the sexual pleasure of a woman is irrelevant, that her only role during sex is to submit to the man’s sexual demands and to do what he tells her, that sex should be controlled by the man and that the woman’s response and satisfaction are irrelevant. These feminists argue that sexual liberation for women cannot be achieved as long as we normalize unequal sexual practices where a man dominates a woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://catwap.wordpress.com/resources/speeches-papers/sex-from-human-intimacy-to-sexual-labor-or-is-prostitution-a-human-right/ |title=SEX: From human intimacy to "sexual labor" or Is prostitution a human right? |author=Cecilia Hofmann |publisher=CATW-Asia Pacific |date = August 1997|accessdate=2010-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such feminists see prostitution as a form of male dominance over women, as the client has sex with a woman who does not enjoy it and who may be making a tremendous psychological effort to mentally dissociate herself from the client. They say that the act of prostitution is not a mutual and equal sex act as it puts the woman in a subordinate position, reducing her to a mere instrument of sexual pleasure for the client. These feminists believe that many clients use the services of prostitutes because they enjoy the "power trip" they derive from the act and the control they have over the woman during the sexual activity. Catharine MacKinnon argues that prostitution "isn't sex only, it’s you do what I say, sex."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://intelligencesquaredus.org/wp-content/uploads/ItsWrongToPayForSex-042109.pdf |title=It's wrong to pay for sex |date=22 April 2009 |website= |publisher= |accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prostitution is seen by these feminists as the result of a patriarchal societal order which subordinates women to men and where the inequality between genders is present in all aspects of life. These feminists believe that prostitution is very harmful to society as it reinforces the idea that women are sex objects which exist for men's enjoyment, which can be "bought" and which can be "used" solely for men's sexual gratification. Anti-prostitution feminists argue that when a society accepts prostitution it sends the message that it is irrelevant how the woman feels during sex or what the consequences of sex will be for her, and that it is acceptable for a man to engage in sexual activity with a woman who does not enjoy it and who could be mentally and emotionally forcing herself in order to be able to cope; the normalization of such one sided sexual encounters might negatively affect the way men relate to women in general and might increase sexual violence against women.

These feminists see prostitution as a form of slavery, and say that, far from decreasing rape rates, prostitution leads to a sharp ''increase'' in sexual violence against women, by sending the message that it is acceptable for a man to treat a woman as a sexual instrument over which he has total control. Melissa Farley argues that Nevada's high rape rate is connected to legal prostitution because Nevada is the only US state which allows legal brothels and is ranked 4th out of the 50 U.S. states for sexual assault crimes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inner-star.org/sexualassaultprevention.html |title=Sexual Assault Prevention Program at ISPAN |publisher=Inner-star.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying, "Nevada's rape rate is higher than the U.S. average and way higher than the rape rate in California, New York and New Jersey. Why is this? Legal prostitution creates an atmosphere in this state in which women are not humans equal to them, are disrespected by men, and which then sets the stage of increased violence against women."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pahrumpvalleytimes.com/2007/Sep-07-Fri-2007/news/16519321.html |title=Panel: Brothels aid sex trafficking |author=MARK WAITE |publisher=Pahrump Valley Times |date=2007-09-07 |accessdate=2010-05-09|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071217174035/http://www.pahrumpvalleytimes.com/2007/Sep-07-Fri-2007/news/16519321.html |archivedate = December 17, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A consequence and correlate of violence against women===
{{POV section|date=December 2016}}
{{See also|Forced prostitution}}
Some feminists, including many who identify as supporting the abolition of prostitution, see the selling of sex as a potential after effect of violence against women. Those who support this position cite studies of violence experienced by women in prostitution prior to entering prostitution. Most (60% to 70%) were sexually abused as children&lt;ref name="Silbert and Pines"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Silbert | first1 = Mimi H. | last2 = Pines | first2 = Ayala M. | author-link = Mimi Silbert | title = Entrance into prostitution | journal = [[Youth &amp; Society]] | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 471–500 | doi = 10.1177/0044118X82013004005 | date = June 1982 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; 65% have been raped, most before the age of 15,&lt;ref name="Silbert"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Silbert | first1 = Mimi H. | last2 = Pines | first2 = Ayala M. | last3 = Lynch | first3 = Teri | author-link = Mimi Silbert | title = Sexual assault of prostitutes: phase one | publisher = Delancey Street Foundation, National Institute of Mental Health | location = Washington D.C. | series = Grant No. RO1-MH-32782-01 | year = 1980 | oclc = 45111118 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that many young women and girls enter prostitution directly from state care, at least in England, Norway, Australia and Canada.&lt;ref name="Coy"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Coy | first = Maddy | author-link = Maddy Coy | title = Young women, local authority care and selling sex: findings from research | journal = [[The British Journal of Social Work]] | volume = 38 | issue = 7 | pages = 1408–1424 | doi = 10.1093/bjsw/bcm049 | date = October 2008 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bjsw/bcm049 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prostitution abolitionists also object to the high rates of violence against women in the sex industry. Studies of women in prostitution show an extremely high level of violence is perpetrated against women in prostitution.  Figures vary across studies.  One representative study showed 82% of respondents had been physically assaulted since entering prostitution, 55% of those by clients.  Additionally, 80% had been physically threatened while in prostitution, 83% of those with a weapon.  8% reported physical attacks by pimps and clients of a nature that resulted in serious injury, for example gunshot wounds and knife wounds.  68% reported having been raped since entering prostitution, 48% more than five times and 46% reporting rapes committed by clients.  Finally, 49% reported pornography was made of them while they were in prostitution and 32% had been upset by an attempt to make them do what clients had seen in pornography.&lt;ref name="Farley and Barkan"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Farley | first1 = Melissa | last2 = Kiremire | first2 = Merab | last3 = Baral | first3 = Isin | last4 = Sezgin | first4 = Ufuk | author-link1 = Melissa Farley | date = November 1998 | title = Prostitution in five countries: violence and post-traumatic stress disorder | journal = [[Feminism &amp; Psychology]] | volume = 8 | issue = 4| pages = 405–426 | doi = 10.1177/0959353598084002 | ref = harv | citeseerx = 10.1.1.522.9029 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women in indoor and outdoor prostitution both report high levels of violence and constant need for vigilance and fear.  Many brothels have installed panic buttons because of the ongoing threat of violence indoors.

Beyond the individual instances of violence or the history of violence suffered by most women in prostitution, prostitution abolitionists see prostitution itself as a form of male violence against women and children.&lt;ref name="Farley and Barkan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AWAN"&gt;{{cite book | title = Aboriginal Women's Action Network Statement on Prostitution | publisher = Aboriginal Women's Action Network (AWAN) | url = http://prostitutionresearch.com/pub_author/aboriginal-womens-action-network-awan/ | year = 2007 }} [http://www.prostitutionresearch.com/aboriginal%20statement%20on%20legal%20prostitution.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Raymond 10"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Raymond | first = Janice G. | author-link1 = Janice Raymond | title = Ten reasons for ''not'' legalizing prostitution and a legal response to the demand for prostitution | journal = [[Journal of Aggression, Maltreatment &amp; Trauma|Journal of Trauma Practice]] | volume = 2 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 315–332 | doi = 10.1300/J189v02n03_17 | date = January 2004 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This understanding is the major theoretical root of calls to decriminalize prostitution(mostly women), but continue to criminalize those who prostitute them, including clients, pimps, procurers and traffickers. Similarly, in other forms of violence against women, anti-violence feminists expect women who are battered, raped, incested, harassed and threatened will not be punished for the crimes committed against them, while the male perpetrators, mostly known to the victims, will suffer criminalization in accordance with the law.

Prostitution abolitionists also cite similarities between prostitution and violence against women. Farley, Lynne and Cotton (2005) argue the prostitution is most like battery because it similarly involves a pattern of coercive and [[controlling behaviour]] (by pimps, procurers and traffickers as well as clients) that results in the control of the women in prostitution.&lt;ref name="Lynne"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Farley | first1 = Melissa | last2 = Lynne | first2 = Jacqueline | last3 = Cotton | first3 = Ann J. | author-link1 = Melissa Farley | title = Prostitution in Vancouver: violence and the colonization of First Nations women | journal = [[Transcultural Psychiatry]] | volume = 42 | issue = 2 | pages = 242–271 | date = June 2005 | doi = 10.1177/1363461505052667 | pmid = 16114585 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research conducted by Giobbe (1993) found similarities in the behaviour of pimps and batterers, in particular, through their use of [[Isolation to facilitate abuse|enforced social isolation]], threats, intimidation, verbal and sexual abuse, attitudes of ownership, and extreme physical violence.&lt;ref name="Giobbe"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Giobbe | first = Evelina | title = A comparison of pimps and batterers | journal = [[University of Michigan Law School#Publications|Michigan Journal of Gender and Law]] | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 33–35 | date = June 2005 | ref = harv }} [http://www.prostitutionresearch.com/An%20analysis%20of%20individual%2C%20institutional%2C%20and%20cultural%20pimping-Giobbe.pdf Pdf of pages 33-58.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some prostitutes argue prostitution has similarities to rape because it is a form of sexuality that is entirely controlled by the client, as rape is a form of sexuality in which the rapist controls the interaction, disregarding the desires, physical well-being or emotional pain of the victim.&lt;ref name="Not for Sale"&gt;{{cite book | editor1-last = Whisnant | editor1-first = Rebecca | editor2-last = Stark | editor2-first = Christine | title = Not for sale: feminists resisting prostitution and pornography | publisher = Spinifex Press | location = North Melbourne, Victoria, Australia | year = 2004 | isbn = 9781876756499 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The raced and classed nature of prostitution ===
Prostitution abolitionists adopt an [[intersectionality|intersectional]] approach to understanding the power relations involved in prostitution.{{According to whom|date=April 2017}}{{POV statement|date=April 2017}} That is, they see prostitution as compelled by multiple forms of [[Oppression|oppressive]] social power, not just sexism against women. Some analysts on human rights issues surrounding prostitution, such as [[Sigma Huda]] in her report for the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, also adopt this approach:

:“The act of prostitution by definition joins together two forms of social power (sex and money) in one interaction.  In both realms (sexuality and economics) men hold substantial and systematic power over women.  In prostitution, these power disparities merge in an act which both assigns and reaffirms the dominant social status of men over the subordinated social status of women.”&lt;ref name="Huda"&gt;Huda, S "Report of the Special Rapporteur on the human rights aspects of the victims of trafficking in persons, especially women and children, Sigma Huda" for the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, February 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
:“The demand for commercial sex is often further grounded in social power disparities of race, nationality, caste and colour.”&lt;ref name="Huda"/&gt;

Abolitionists attribute prostitution to women's comparative lack of economic resources. Globalisation and neoliberalism have exacerbated already unequal economic relations, including by cutting back social spending in Northern and formerly socialist countries, and increasing the demand for cheap labour, including in prostitution, in both Southern and Northern countries.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Combined with sex discrimination in wages and job type, sexual harassment in the workplace, and an undue burden of caring for children, the elderly and the ill, women are at a significant economic disadvantage in the current economic structure.  Poverty is the single greatest “push” factor making women vulnerable to accepting prostitution as a means of subsistence.&lt;ref name="Raymond 10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="O'Connor and Healy"&gt;O'Connor, M and Healy, G "The Links Between Prostitution and Sex Trafficking: A Briefing Handbook" Prepared for the Joint Project Coordinated by the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women (CATW) and the European Women’s Lobby (EWL) on Promoting Preventative Measures to Combat Trafficking in Human Beings for Sexual Exploitation: A Swedish and United States Governmental and Non-Governmental Organisation Partnership 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, racism shapes women's entry into prostitution, both because it makes women more vulnerable to prostitution and because clients demand racialized women in prostitution. Racism in education, economic and political systems affect the choices of women of colour.  Additionally, racist sexualisation, through pornography in particular, of Black and Asian women as over-sexed and submissive or otherwise available for prostitution contributes to the demand for specifically racialized women.&lt;ref name="Nelson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prostitutionresearch.com/racism/000015.html#more|title=Prostitution: Where Racism and Sexism Intersect|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Massage parlours, strip clubs and other prostitution businesses are often located in poor and racialized neighbourhoods, encouraging clients to troll those neighbourhoods for women, making all women in those neighbourhoods vulnerable to prostitution-related harassment and women in those neighbourhoods more likely to accept their use in prostitution as normal.&lt;ref name="Nelson"/&gt;

Indigenous women around the world are particularly targeted for prostitution.  In Canada, New Zealand, Mexico, and Taiwan, studies have shown that indigenous women are at the bottom of the race and class hierarchy of prostitution, often subjected to the worst conditions, most violent demands and sold at the lowest price.&lt;ref name="Lynne"/&gt;  It is common for indigenous women to be over-represented in prostitution when compared with their total population.  This is as a result of the combined forces of colonialism, physical displacement from ancestral lands, destruction of indigenous social and cultural order, misogyny, globalization/neoliberalism, race discrimination and extremely high levels of violence perpetrated against them.&lt;ref name="Lynne"/&gt;  The Aboriginal Women's Action Network, an abolitionist organization in Canada, has specifically noted that because the prostitution of Aboriginal women results from and reinforces such extreme hatred of Aboriginal women, no regime of legalisation (which will expand the industry and entrap more women) can be safer for Aboriginal women.  Prostitution can only further harm Aboriginal women.&lt;ref name="AWAN"/&gt;

===Outlawing of buying sexual services===
{{See also|Prostitution law}}
In  1999, [[Sweden]] became the first country to make it illegal to pay for sex, but not to be a prostitute (the client commits a crime, but not the prostitute). Similar laws were passed in [[Norway]] (in 2009)&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7806760.stm New Norway law bans buying of sex]. BBC News (2009-01-01).

During 2011, the newly elected government of [[Denmark]] began discussing the possibility of banning the buying of sexual services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nppr.se/2011/09/21/denmark-election-new-government-towards-new-prostitution-policy/ The Danish election: a new government – and towards a new prostitution regime?].

Carnal San Francisco. Retrieved on 2009-09-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

These laws are a natural extension of the views of the feminists who oppose prostitution. These feminists reject the idea that prostitution can be reformed, and oppose any [[harm reduction]] approach. [[Trisha Baptie]], a [[Canadians|Canadian]] former prostitute, who now opposes the industry, and lobbies for the outlawing of buying sexual services, wrote: "Harm reduction ? You can’t make prostitution "safer" ; prostitution is violence in itself. It is [[rape]], the money only appeases men’s guilt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Trisha Baptie |url=http://sisyphe.org/spip.php?article3290 |title="Sex worker" ? Never met one ! |publisher=Sisyphe.org |date=2009-04-26 |accessdate=2010-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; " "One of the most “[[sex-positive]]” things you can do is make sure men cannot buy sex, because the buying of sex is violence against women and is a direct deterrent to women’s equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.straight.com/article-232404/trisha-baptie-why-prostitution-worlds-oldest-oppression-must-be-stamped-out | title=Commentary: Why prostitution, the world's oldest oppression, must be stamped out &amp;#124; Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada |publisher=Straight.com |date=2009-06-12 |author=Trisha Baptie |accessdate=2010-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; "

These feminists see prostitution as a form of [[violence against women]] and vehemently condemn the common pro-legalization argument that "prostitution has always existed and will never go away", arguing that other violent acts such as murder, rape and child sexual abuse have also always existed and will never be eradicated either, and that is not a reason to legalize them. These feminists argue that the idea of legalizing prostitution in order to control it and "make it a little better" and reduce harm is no different from the idea of legalizing domestic violence in order to control it and "make it a little better" and reduce harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nevadacoalition.org/factsheets/LegliznFactSheet091707c.pdf |title=Myths and Facts about Nevada Legal Prostitution |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2010-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pro-sex worker perspectives==

To directly counteract the view of prostitution as the oppression of women, some scholars and feminists have voiced their opinion in support of prostitution and other forms of sex-work. Support is based on ideas of economic empowerment, independence and autonomy of choice, comparisons to sexual role in marriage, and challenging outdated societal notions of the proper expression of women's sexuality.

=== Proponents and support groups ===

Activists and scholars who are proponents of the pro-sex work position include: [[Margo St. James]], [[Norma Jean Almodovar]],&lt;ref&gt;Norma Jean Almodovar, 2002, "For Their Own Good: The Results of the Prostitution Laws as Enforced by Cops, Politicians, and Judges", in Liberty for Women, W. McElroy (ed.), Chicago: Ivan R. Dee.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Kamala Kempadoo]],&lt;ref&gt;Kamala Kempadoo, and Doezema, J., (eds.), 1998, Global Sex Workers: Rights, Resistance, and Redefinition, New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Laura María Agustín]], [[Annie Sprinkle]], [[Carol Leigh]] (also known as Scarlot Harlot), [[Carol Queen]] and [[Audacia Ray]].

To assist women not involved in traditional “woman’s work,” pro-sex work formed to create a helpful environment for sex workers.  Social activist groups like The Red Thread, founded in 1985, seek to educate the public, provide legal and medical assistance to sex workers, and help organize sex workers into groups in order to better protect themselves and to become advocates.&lt;ref&gt;Holly B. Fechner, Three Stories of Prostitution in the West: Prostitutes' Groups, Law and Feminist "Truth", 4 Colum. J. Gender &amp; L. 26, 33 (1994).&lt;/ref&gt; Liberal feminists and groups such as The Red Thread, The International Committee for Prostitutes (ICPR) and COYOTE seek to ensure that sex work is seen as a valid choice that women may make without overtly oppressive forces.

=== Economic empowerment ===

One view is that sex work not only empowers women, but it provides women with greater opportunities for financial advancement.&lt;ref&gt;Lars O. Ericson, Charges against Prostitution: An Attempt at a Philosophical Assessment, 90 Ethics 335, 354 (1980).&lt;/ref&gt;
The proponents of female empowerment through sex work are liberal feminists.&lt;ref&gt;Katie Beran, Revisiting the Prostitution Debate: Uniting Liberal and Radical Feminism in Pursuit of Policy Reform, 30 Law &amp; Ineq. 19, 31 (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Liberal feminists view prostitution as the sale of sex solely for economic gain, and thus it cannot be differentiated from any other sale of goods. The selling of sex ultimately consists of a buyer and a seller trying to negotiate for the best deal.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt; Interfering in this sale of goods could not only be interfering with the rights of the buyer, but also of the seller. Women who have chosen to enter the field should not be looked down upon and should not have their choice considered to be lesser than another type of socially accepted employment. Liberal feminists argue that while prostitution and sex work may not be the ideal job for many women, it can provide a way of life and prosperity that would be otherwise unattainable.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Sex work can be seen as a better alternative to working for minimum wage or working in a field that that society decided is “woman’s work.”

=== Self empowerment ===

To conclude that all sex workers partake in the industry because of oppression, past sexual abuse, and lack of opportunity, creates a critical division in feminism and equality. Assuming that all women who chose to partake in sex work are victims of oppression violates their ability to make an autonomous choice. The autonomy theory of feminism seeks to instill in women the right to “stand on their own, make their own decisions, and pursue their own notion of a life lived well.”&lt;ref&gt;Katherine T. Bartlett, Deborah Rhode, &amp; Joanna L. Grossman, Gender and Law, 599 (6th ed. 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; It cannot be ignored that some women freely chose to become sex workers not because of oppression, but because of their love for sex and desire for power.
 
Sex work can also create a sense of independence for women.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Rather than relying on a husband or a partner, sex work allows women to make choices completely free from pressure or influence. While women are socialized to hide their sexuality, sex workers are free to explore their sexuality and to openly choose their sexual partners.  Sex workers, whether they work on the streets or in hotels, have the freedom to accept or to reject clients. They are free to accept or to decline any sexual advance. This stands in direct opposition to the married housewife who does not have the sexual autonomy of the sex worker.&lt;ref&gt;Lars Ericson, Charges against Prostitution, 90 Ethics 335, 354 (1980).&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas radical feminists consider sex workers to be victims of circumstances and false consciousness,&lt;ref&gt;Katherine T. Bartlett ET AL., Gender and Law, at 657.&lt;/ref&gt; the liberal feminists and women who chose to participate in sex work do not consider themselves to be victims of any sort. Instead, they consider their actions to be liberating and providing them with a sense of control.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Weitzer, Legalizing Prostitution: From Illicit Vice to Lawful Business, 7 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marriage analogy ===

Sex work and prostitution have often been compared to a marriage in which the man is the breadwinner, while the woman stays at home and cares for the family. There does not appear to be a distinction between the woman who has devoted her body to her husband in exchange for his promise to take care of her, and the sex worker who has chosen to sell sexual acts in exchange for payment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Radical feminists and others opposed to prostitution will state that marriage and monogamy cannot be compared to prostitution because a marriage is beyond a contract, and a marriage does not advocate for the dominance of the man over the woman.&lt;ref&gt;Carole Pateman, Prostitution: Charges Against Ericson, 93 Ethics 561, 562-63 (1983).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the difference goes beyond dominance but to choice. The true difference between the dependent spouse and the sex worker is that the independent sex worker does not belong to one man; in fact, she does not belong to anyone but herself.

=== Acceptance of women's sexuality ===

Liberal feminists argue that the patriarchal and moralistic view of sex as the ultimate expression of a woman’s love must be changed in order for society to truly understand the sexual nature of women.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine T. Bartlett ET AL., Gender and Law, at 658.&lt;/ref&gt; A pro sex worker stance is inextricably linked to the idea of women finally not being forced to view romantic sex as the only type of sex.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Notions of “proper womanhood and conventional sexuality”&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Weitzer, Legalizing Prostitution, at 7.&lt;/ref&gt; cannot be linked to a woman’s choice in one sexual partner or multiple, or a woman’s choice to engage in sexual intercourse in exchange for love or for money.  Proper woman is a term that has its definition rooted in socialization and not fact. Prostitution and sex work are about more than the female sexual experience. Sex work can provide female empowerment and instill “a sense of self worth, self-confidence, and self esteem.”  &lt;ref&gt;Id. at 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legalization or decriminalization===
{{See also|Sex workers' rights}}

Feminists who support the legalization or decriminalization of prostitution argue that one of the significant flaws with the radical anti-prostitution feminist view is that a majority of its arguments are premised on the assumption that prostitution itself is inherently laced with sexism, classism and other unbalanced power relations. The institution of prostitution itself is seen by abolitionists as resting on these conditions and therefore they believe legalization or decriminalization will only lead to the reinforcement of these conditions. Pro-sex-work feminists argue that this assumption is flawed, and that while prostitution, as it currently exists in our society, can be misogynist or degrading in some manifestations, there is a grave danger in attributing these conditions to prostitution itself. They argue that targeting prostitution as a whole unduly focuses attention on this single institution in our society, rather than looking at society at large and the social institutions, laws and practices that lead to the subordination and oppression of women.&lt;ref name="Bromberg"&gt;{{cite web | title=Feminist Issues In Prostitution. | first=Sarah | last=Bromberg | url=http://www.feministissues.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=A Case for the Legalization of Prostitution: A Critical Analysis of Liberal versus Radical Feminist Views on Sex Work. | first=Sarah | last=Landau. | url= http://www.sarahlandau.com/2008/04/a-case-for-the-legalization-of.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been much debate over the last few decades amongst feminists about how laws relating to prostitution should be reformed. Most liberal feminists who look at prostitution from a capitalist perspective support some form of either decriminalization or legalization.

Decriminalization is the removal of all penalties for prostitution itself and for all the activities necessary for prostitutes to do their work, such as advertising, communicating with clients, etc. It does not mean the reversal of ''all'' laws relating to prostitution, for example laws that exist against forcing someone into prostitution. For the purposes of decriminalization, Feminists for Free Expression defines the word “prostitution” to mean any consensual sexual activity between adults where compensation is involved; nonconsensual sex acts or sex acts perpetrated against minors are not prostitution, in their view. Instead they prefer the term "criminal sexual acts".&lt;ref name="ffeusapropam"&gt;{{cite web | publisher=Feminists for Free Expression. | title=The Free Speech Pamphlet Series: Prostitution. | url=http://www.ffeusa.org/html/statements/statements_prostitution.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term 'legalization', on the other hand, is usually used in the context of prostitution to refer to the use of criminal laws to regulate prostitution by determining the legal conditions under which prostitutes can operate. Legalization can mean anything from rigid controls under a state-controlled system to merely defining the operation of a privatized sex industry. Legalization is often accompanied by strict criminal penalties for anyone who operates outside the legally defined framework.&lt;ref&gt;Defining Terms. From PRINCIPLES FOR MODEL SEX INDUSTRY LEGISLATION. Scarlet Alliance. http://www.bayswan.org/defining.html&lt;/ref&gt; With legalization there may be rules about where prostitution can take place (for example only in state licensed brothels), what prostitutes can do, mandatory registry/licensing and frequent mandatory health exams.&lt;ref&gt;Making Space for Working Women. Stella. http://www.chezstella.org/stella/?q=en/debate&lt;/ref&gt;

Some pro-sex-worker feminists support decriminalization and some support legalization, for different reasons. Proponents of decriminalization believe that all people, including sex workers, are entitled to the same rights regarding safety, health and human rights, and that outdated criminal laws need to be reformed in order to improve the living and working conditions of sex workers. They argue that decriminalization is better for the workers than legalization and that both criminalization and heavily regulated legalization infringe on the workers' safety and human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Decriminalization of Prostitution  to Reduce Sex Workers'  Vulnerability to HIV. | author=Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network. | url=http://www.aidslaw.ca/publications/interfaces/downloadFile.php?ref=657 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many feminists who support sex workers favor decriminalization because it allows prostitutes to go into business for themselves and self-determination is a tenet of feminist politics.&lt;ref name="ffeusapropam" /&gt; They believe decriminalization fosters responsibility, empowerment, self-esteem and self-care, all important feminist values. The goal in decriminalizing sex work is that anyone doing any type of sex work would be treated the same way, with the same rights and responsibilities, as any other self-employed person.&lt;ref&gt;Legalization vs Decriminalization. Stella. http://www.chezstella.org/stella/?q=en/debate&lt;/ref&gt; Whether they support decriminalization or some form of legalization, pro-sex work feminists believe that the current laws that exist surrounding prostitution in many countries need to be changed and are harmful to the people who work in the industry.

==Other perspectives==
There are many feminists whose views on prostitution do not fit in either the anti-prostitution feminist or the sex-positive feminist viewpoints, and in some cases are critical of both. These feminist authors have criticized what they see as the unproductive and often bitter debate that characterizes the two-position analysis of prostitution. Such authors highlight that in allowing arguments about prostitution to be reduced to a stale analysis and theoretical debate, feminists are themselves contributing to the [[marginalization]] of prostitutes, simplifying the nature of the work they carry out and the personal circumstances that involve each individual.&lt;ref&gt;O’Neill, Maggie (2001) ''Prostitution and Feminism''. Polity Press: Cambridge pg 23&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist scholar [[Laurie Shrage]] has also criticized the haphazard nature of feminist views on prostitution. Shrage claims that in a determination to undermine patriarchy, pro-sex feminists have advocated a reckless and "[[Milton Friedman]] style" deregulation of laws surrounding prostitution, without considering the implications that this may have upon women involved in sex work, particularly given the nature of the sex trade, which is more likely to be plagued by exploitation and poor working conditions, concerns that must be of importance to any feminist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Routledge| isbn = 978-0-415-90551-0| last = Shrage| first = Laurie| title = Moral dilemmas of feminism: prostitution, adultery, and abortion| year = 1994}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=UyxXzVGVxl0C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA83#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false p 83].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2562">'''Fronte Nuovo delle Arti''' was an Italian artistic movement active in [[Venice]], [[Rome]] and [[Milan]] in the years following [[Second World War|WWII]] (1946 to 1950). It is considered to be part of the post-cubism movement.

"Fronte Nuovo delle Arti" was founded in September-October 1946 with the name ''Nuova Secessione Artistica Italiana'' (New Italian Artistic Secession). The first manifesto was published on 1 October 1946 in [[Venice]]. It was written by Giuseppe Marchiori and signed by [[Emilio Vedova]], [[Renato Birolli]], [[Ennio Morlotti]], [[Armando Pizzinato]], Giuseppe Santomaso, Alberto Viani, [[Bruno Cassinari]], [[Renato Guttuso]], Leoncillo Leonardi and [[Carlo Levi]]. Later on, Guttuso proposed to change the name of the movement to ''Fronte Nuovo delle Arti''. 

The reasoning for this group of artists and critics to develop the ideas leading to the formation of the ''Fronte'' was to go beyond the positions of the movement Novecento italiano, who were deemed as outdated in light of the most recent artistic developments in Europe. 

"Fronte Nuovo delle Arti'' had a number of exhibitions in Italy but it disbanded after an intense internal debate about [[Abstract art|abstraction]] and [[Realism (arts)|realism]]. Pizzinato and Guttuso rejected [[abstractionism]] and announced their decision to quit. The movement was officially dissolved on 3 September 1950 in Venice.

[[File:Domreiter, Blattmaske.jpg|thumb|A foliate head in the shape of an [[Acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]] leaf: a [[corbel]] supporting the [[Bamberg Horseman]], Bamberg cathedral, Germany, early 13th century]]

A '''Green Man''' is a sculpture or other representation of a face surrounded by or made from [[leaf|leaves]]. Branches or [[vine]]s may sprout from the mouth, nostrils, or other parts of the face and these shoots may bear flowers or fruit. Commonly used as a decorative [[ornament (art)|architectural ornament]], Green Men are frequently found in [[Wikt:carving|carvings]] on both secular and [[ecclesiology|ecclesiastical]] buildings. "The Green Man" is also a popular name for English [[public house]]s and various interpretations of the name appear on inn signs, which sometimes show a full figure rather than just the head.

The Green Man [[motif (visual arts)|motif]] has many variations. Found in many cultures from many ages around the world, the Green Man is often related to natural [[vegetation deity|vegetative deities]]. It is primarily interpreted as a [[symbol]] of rebirth, representing the cycle of growth each spring. Some&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cheade|first=Shirlyn|title=Green Man Mythology|url=http://library.tarvalon.net/index.php?title=Green_Man_Mythology|work=TarValon.net Library|accessdate=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jenks|first=Kathleen|title=Common Themes East &amp; West: The Green Man|url=http://www.mythinglinks.org/ct~greenmen.html|work=Myth*ing Links|accessdate=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  speculate that the [[mythology]] of the Green Man developed independently in the traditions of separate ancient cultures and evolved into the wide variety of examples found throughout history.

==Types==

Usually referred to in works on architecture as foliate heads or foliate masks, carvings of the Green Man may take many forms, naturalistic or decorative. The simplest depict a man's face peering out of dense [[foliage]]. Some may have leaves for hair, perhaps with a leafy beard. Often leaves or leafy shoots are shown growing from his open mouth and sometimes even from the nose and eyes as well. In the most abstract examples, the carving at first glance appears to be merely stylised foliage, with the facial element only becoming apparent on closer examination. The face is almost always male; green women are rare.

[[FitzRoy Somerset, 4th Baron Raglan|Julia, Lady Raglan]] applied the term "Green Man" to this type of architectural feature in her 1939 article "The Green Man in Church Architecture" in ''The Folklore Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Raglan | first=Lady |date=March 1939 | title=The Green Man in Church Architecture | journal=Folklore | volume=50 | issue=90990 | pages=45–57 | jstor=1257090 | doi=10.1080/0015587x.1939.9718148}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is thought that her interest stemmed from carvings at [[St Jerome's Church, Llangwm|St. Jerome’s Church]] in [[Llangwm, Monmouthshire|Llangwm]], [[Monmouthshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenmanenigma.com/theories.html |title= : Theories and Interpretations|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= The Enigma of the Green Man|publisher= |access-date= 24 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators conflate or associate the term with "[[Jack in the green|Jack in the Green]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Centerwall | first=Brandon S. | year=1997 | title=The Name of the Green Man | journal=Folklore | volume=108 | pages=25–33 | doi=10.1080/0015587x.1997.9715933}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Green [[cat]]s, [[lion]]s, and [[demon]]s are also found. On [[gravestone]]s and other [[memorial]]s, [[human skull]]s are sometimes shown sprouting [[grape vine]]s or other vegetation, presumably as a symbol of [[resurrection]] (as at [[Shebbear, Devon]], England).{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

The Green Man appears in many forms, with the three most common types categorized as:

*the Foliate Head: completely covered in green leaves
*the Disgorging Head: spews vegetation from its mouth
*the Bloodsucker Head: sprouts vegetation from all facial orifices (e.g. tear ducts, nostrils and mouth)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Harding | first=Mike | title=A Little Book Of The Green Man | publisher=Aurum Press | year=1998 | page=38 | url=http://www.em-online.com/lifestyle/article.asp?id=34 | isbn=1-85410-561-2 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710185348/http://www.em-online.com/lifestyle/article.asp?id=34 | archivedate=2011-07-10 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Pesznecker | first=Susan | title=Gargoyles: From the Archives of the Grey School of Wizardry | publisher=Career Press | year=2007 | location=Franklin Lakes NJ | pages=127–128 | isbn=1-56414-911-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Churches==
Superficially the Green Man would appear to be [[Paganism|pagan]], perhaps a fertility figure or a nature spirit, similar to the [[woodwose]] (the wild man of the woods), and yet he frequently appears, carved in [[wood carving|wood]] or [[stone carving|stone]], in [[Church (building)|churches]], [[chapel]]s, [[abbey]]s and [[cathedral]]s, where examples can be found dating through to the 20th century. The earliest example of a green man disgorging vegetation from his mouth is from St. Abre, in St. Hilaire-le-grand, c. 400 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=William|title=Green Man|year=1990|publisher=Harpercollins|isbn=0-06-250077-5|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition of the Green Man being carved on to Christian churches exists across Europe, including examples such as the Seven Green Men of [[Nicosia]] in [[Cyprus]], a series of seven green men carved in the thirteenth century on to the facade of St Nicholas Church in Nicosia.&lt;gallery&gt;

==Later variations==

From the [[Renaissance]] onwards, elaborate variations on the Green Man theme, often with animal heads rather than human faces, appear in many media other than carvings (including [[manuscript]]s, [[metalwork]], [[bookplate]]s, and [[stained glass]]). They seem to have been used for purely decorative effect rather than reflecting any deeply held belief. A Swiss engraver, Numa Guyot&lt;ref name="Numa"&gt;[http://www.guyotbrothers.com/numa1.htm Numa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107020949/http://www.guyotbrothers.com/numa1.htm |date=2016-01-07 }}, Guyot Brothers&lt;/ref&gt; created a bookplate depicting a Green Man in exquisite detail. It was completed circa 1887.

In Britain, the image of the Green Man enjoyed a revival in the 19th century, becoming popular with [[architect]]s during the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic revival]] and the [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]] era, when it appeared as a decorative motif in and on many buildings, both religious and secular. American architects took up the motif around the same time. The Green Man travelled with the Europeans as they colonized the world. Many variations can be found in Neo-gothic [[Victorian architecture]]. He was very popular amongst Australian stonemasons and can be found on many secular and sacred buildings.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;https://www.flickr.com/photos/jamesrose/164464514/in/photolist-fwVz5-CGLsqi-zb9xE-57nB3x-NPYYH-cXH6tW-4ZBKCU-3iPiZ6-xzNzE-3iTMbf-buqGHT-4JYnSS-7ZggoR-jnSku-hk3Dc5-bCfKoU-aDqEeQ-kmDzzp-EUBjx-i7iw5B-apCqHS-gpjn5-93Zenk-mp5yN-8aNWZa-hFXU1f-82c6i6-pqTS6r-8aKnj4-9xEffL-bMX9oM-x6VT1X-8hoeS1-75R9ej-3iTM6f-5ewQjQ-nRs78-5Jg5V6-6AMtAo-9b9Mrr-5vBFJk-ajvLug-4xqQz6-aB979v-5mVrEm-4ckixq-nREjy-9ptokg-6MPztE-6atk3k&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern images===
The Green Man image has made a resurgence in modern times, with artists from around the world interweaving the imagery into various modes of work.&lt;ref name="AraneoThesis"&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Phyllis Araneo | title=Green Man Resurrected: An Examination of the Underlying Meanings and Messages of the Re-Emergence of the Ancient Image of the Green Man in Contemporary, Western, Visual Culture. | journal=Master's thesis: University of the Sunshine Coast, 2006. Queensland, Australia. | url=http://research.usc.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/usc:894 | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among these are English artist [[Paul Sivell]], who created the ''Whitefield Green Man'', a wood carving in a dead section of a living oak tree; [[David Eveleigh]], an English garden designer who created the ''Penpont Green Man Millennium Maze'', in [[Powys]], [[Wales]] (the largest depiction of a Green Man image in the world); [[Zambia]]n sculptor [[Toin Adams]] who created the 12m-tall ''Green Man'' in Birmingham, UK (the largest free-standing sculpture of the Green Man in the world); and sculptor [[M. J. Anderson]], who created the marble sculpture titled ''Green Man as Original Coastal Aboriginal Man of All Time from Whence the Bush and All of Nature Sprouts from his Fingers.''

Others include Jane Brideson, Australian artist Marjorie Bussey, American artist Monica Richards, and English fantasy artist [[Peter Pracownik]], whose artwork has appeared in several media, including full-body tattoos.&lt;ref name="AraneoThesis"/&gt;

American artist Rob Juszak has taken the theme of the Green Man as Earth’s spiritual protector and turned it into a vision of the Green Man cradling the planet; artist Dorothy Bowen created a kimono silk painting, titled ''Greenwoman'', as an expression of the feminine aspect of the legend.&lt;ref name="AraneoThesis"/&gt;

A character superficially similar to the Green Man, in the form of a partly foliate mask surrounded by Bacchic figures, appears at the center of the 4th century silver salver in the [[Mildenhall Treasure]], found at a [[Roman villa]] site in Suffolk, England; the mask is generally agreed to represent [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] or [[Oceanus]] and the foliation is of seaweed.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Mildenhall treasure Bacchus.JPG|Illustrated]] ([https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/t/mildenhall_treasure_great_dish.aspx British Museum highlights:Great dish from the Mildenhall treasure] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018173452/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/t/mildenhall_treasure_great_dish.aspx |date=2015-10-18 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

For many [[modern paganism|modern Pagan]]s, the Green Man is used as a symbol of seasonal renewal and ecological awareness.{{sfn|Bramwell|2009|p=53}}

In [[Wicca]], the Green Man has often been used as a representation of the [[Horned God]], a [[syncretic]] deity that appropriates aspects of, among others, the [[Celtic polytheism|Celtic]] [[Cernunnos]] and the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]].

===Literature===

The Green Man is a recurring theme in literature.  Sometimes the figures of [[Robin Hood]] and [[Peter Pan]] are associated with a Green Man, as is that of the Green Knight in ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]''. The Green Knight in this poem serves as both a monster antagonist and as mentor to Sir Gawain, belonging to a pre-Christian world which seems antagonistic to, but is in the end harmonious with, the Christian one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Braudy|first1=Leo|title=Haunted: On Ghosts, Witches, Vampires, Zombies, and Other Monsters of the Natural and Supernatural Worlds|date=Oct 25, 2016|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300224729|page=277|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CqAqDQAAQBAJ&amp;dq|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the post-war era literary scholars interpreted the Green Knight as being a literary representation of Lady Raglan's Green Man as described in her article "The Green Man in Church Architecture", published in the "Folklore" journal of March 1939. This association ultimately helped consolidate the belief that the Green Man was a genuine, Medieval, folkloric, figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Larrington|first1=Carolyne|title=The Land of the Green Man: A Journey Through the Supernatural Landscapes of the British Isles|date=2015|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=1780769911|page=227|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5E4FCwAAQBAJ&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mastin|first1=Luke|title=THEORIES AND INTERPRETATIONS|url=http://www.greenmanenigma.com/theories.html|website=www.greenmanenigma.com|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

[[Sir James Frazer]] mentions the tradition in ''[[The Golden Bough]]''. [[Kingsley Amis]]'s novel ''[[The Green Man (Kingsley Amis novel)|The Green Man]]'' (1969) is about a modern incarnation of the Green Man, who, in the novel, is portrayed as ancient pagan monster. [[Stephen Fry]] wrote a [[pastiche]] of a [[poem]] called "The Green Man" as part of his novel ''[[The Hippopotamus]]''. In [[Charles Olson]]'s book, ''[[Archaeologist of Morning]]'', there is a [[poem]] entitled "The Green Man". [[Ronald Johnson (poet)|Ronald Johnson]] also wrote a book-length poem sequence, ''The Book of the Green Man''. The premise has even made its way into comics, most notably with the character of [[Swamp Thing]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Green men, and variants on the theme, frequently occur in modern fantasy literature and science fiction. [[Tom Bombadil]] and the [[Ents]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' could be considered possible examples. In [[Kenneth Grahame]]'s 1908 children's classic ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]'', a depiction of a natural deity, analogous with [[Pan (god)|Pan]] and Green Man legend, appears as the climax of a mystical experience within the chapter "The Piper at the Gates of Dawn". (Later, the psychedelic rock band [[Pink Floyd]]'s debut studio album took [[The Piper at the Gates of Dawn|its name from that chapter]].) Elsewhere, [[Robert Jordan]]'s series ''[[The Wheel of Time]]'' features a character named [[Someshta]], referred to as "the Green Man". He is the sole survivor of a race called the Nym, who were originally entrusted as the gardeners of the world, and who had the ability to manipulate the life and growth of plants around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The [[Cornish people|Cornish]] poet [[Charles Causley]], the 1967 winner of the [[Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry]] wrote a poem titled ''Green Man In The Garden''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetrysoup.com/charles_causley/biography|title=Charles Causley Biography|website=www.poetrysoup.com|language=en-us|access-date=2018-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the final years of the 20th century and earliest of the 21st, the appearance of the Green Man proliferated in children's literature.{{sfn|Bramwell|2009|p=59}} Examples of such novels in which the Green Man is a central character are [[Bel Mooney]]'s 1997 works ''The Green Man'' and ''Joining the Rainbow'', [[Jane Gardam]]'s 1998 ''The Green Man'', and [[Geraldine McCaughrean]]'s 1998 ''The Stones are Hatching''.{{sfn|Bramwell|2009|p=59}} Within many of these depictions, the Green Man figure absorbs and supplants a variety of other wild men and gods, in particular those which are associated with a seasonal death and rebirth.{{sfn|Bramwell|2009|p=59}}

===Music===
The Green Man was a track by early English acid house outfit [[Shut Up and Dance (band)|Shut Up and Dance]] who entered the UK charts in 1992.  A song "Greenman" by English band [[XTC]] featured on their album ''[[Apple Venus Volume 1]]'' (lyrics included "See the Greenman blow his kiss from high church wall"). A song called "Green Man" is on American heavy metal band [[Type O Negative]]'s album ''[[October Rust]]''. The green man is the subject of [[Roy Harper (singer)|Roy Harper]]'s "The Green Man", the lead song on his [[The Green Man (album)|album of the same name]]. The track "Diadem" on [[Waterson–Carthy]]'s 2006 album ''[[Holy Heathens and the Old Green Man]]'' has phrases which suggest that the figure being adored is some kind of Green Man.

===Cinema===
The Green Man is featured in several films, such as ''[[The Draughtsman's Contract]]'' by [[Peter Greenaway]] (1982) and the first episode of ''[[The Canterbury Tales (film)|The Canterbury Tales]]'' by [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]] (1972). The 2012 [[Disney]] film ''[[The Odd Life of Timothy Green]]'' also appears to depict a Green Man figure in its title character, a magical child who appears in the garden of a childless couple one night. He has leaves growing on his legs, takes nourishment from sunlight and returns to the earth in the fall, after fulfilling his purpose. In the 1973 horror film ''[[The Wicker Man (1973 film)|The Wicker Man]]'', the local tavern of Summerisle is named 'The Green Man', and is the haunt of a group of paganistic islanders.

==Outside Europe==
[[File:Osiris-tomb-of-Nefertari.jpg|thumb|[[Osiris]], ruler of the underworld and of rebirth and regeneration, was typically shown with a green face. (Tomb of [[Nefertari]]), 1295–1253 BC]]

[[File:Khidr.jpg|left|100px|thumb|[[al-Khidr]]]]

In his ''A Little Book of The Green Man'', as well as his website, [[Mike Harding]] gives examples of similar figures in [[Borneo]], [[Nepal]], and [[India]]: the earliest is a foliate head from an 8th-century [[Jain]] [[temple]] in [[Rajasthan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mikeharding.co.uk/ |title=The Official Mike Harding Web Site |publisher=Mikeharding.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also notes that heads from [[Lebanon]] and [[Iraq]] can be dated to the 2nd century and that there are early Romanesque foliate heads in 11th century [[Knights Templar|Templar]] churches in [[Jerusalem]]. He tentatively suggests that the symbol may have originated in [[Asia Minor]] and been brought to [[Europe]] by travelling stonecarvers.

On a similar theme, author on spirituality and architecture William Anderson writes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;blockquote&gt;There are legends of him ([[Al-Khidr|Khidr]]) in which, like [[Osiris]], he is dismembered and reborn; and prophecies connecting him, like the Green Man, with the end of time. His name means the Green One or Verdant One, he is the voice of inspiration to the aspirant and committed artist. He can come as a white light or the gleam on a blade of grass, but more often as an inner mood. The sign of his presence is the ability to work or experience with tireless enthusiasm beyond one's normal capacities. In this there may be a link across cultures, …one reason for the enthusiasm of the medieval sculptors for the Green Man may be that he was the source of every inspiration.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In one of his roles the ancient Egyptian God [[Osiris]] is regarded as a corn-deity and is commonly depicted with a green face representing vegetation, rebirth and resurrection. Containers of soil in the shape of Osiris planted with seed ("Osiris Beds") are found in some [[New Kingdom]] tombs. The sprouting corn implied the resurrection of the deceased.&lt;ref&gt;''Routledge Dictionary of Egyptian Gods and Goddesses'', George Hart, p119, Routledge, 2005
{{ISBN|0-415-34495-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other gods depicted green are (in Tibet) Amogha-siddhi and (in Mexico) [[Tlaloc]].

In Sanskrit the Green Man is cognate with the [[gana]] [[Kirtimukha]] or "[[Face Of Glory]]" which is related to a [[lila (Hinduism)|lila]] of [[Shiva]] and [[Rahu]]. The Face of Glory is often seen in [[Vajrayana]] Buddhist [[Thanka]] art and [[iconography]] where it is often incorporated as a cloudform [[simulacrum]]; and depicted crowning the 'Wheel of Becoming' or the [[Bhavachakra]].&lt;ref&gt;Beer, Robert. ''The Encyclopedia of Tibetan Symbols and Motifs'' Shambhala. (1999) {{ISBN|1-57062-416-X}}, {{ISBN|978-1-57062-416-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Khidr]] or al-Khidr ([[Arabic]]: الخضر al-Khiḍr "the Green One", also transcribed as Khidar, Khizr, Khyzer, Khizar) is a revered figure in [[Islam]], whom the [[Qur'an]] describes as a righteous servant of [[God in Islam|God]],&lt;ref name="Qur'an, 18:65"&gt;Qur'an, 18:65&lt;/ref&gt; who possessed great wisdom or mystic knowledge.&lt;ref name="Qur'an, 18:65"/&gt; He is most often said to be a contemporary of  [[Islamic view of Moses|Moses]], but in other variations of his story, he lived at the same time as Abraham, the mythological Persian king [[Fereydun|Afridun]] and Nashiya bin Amus.&lt;ref name="al-Khadir al-Khidr"&gt;{{cite web|title=al-Khadir (al-Khidr)|url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/al-khadir-al-khidr-COM_0483?s.num=4&amp;s.f.s2_parent=s.f.book.encyclopaedia-of-islam-2&amp;s.q=khidr|work=Encyclopedia of Islam, Second Edition|accessdate=21 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Qur'an, 18:64–65&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Al-Kahf|18th sura ("The Cave")]] presents a narrative where Khidr accompanies Moses and tests him about his oath to not ask any questions. Tom Cheetham, an authority on Islamic mysticism, identifies Khidr of esoteric [[Sufism]] with the Green Man. In his book about the work of [[Henry Corbin]] and others concerning the 12th-century Muslim saint [[Ibn Arabi]], he develops the idea of the Green Man/Khidr as the principle mediating between the imaginary realm and the physical world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16819">'''Habitat III''', the '''United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development''', took place in [[Quito]], [[Ecuador]], from 17 – 20 October 2016.

The UN Conferences on Housing (Habitat) are occurring in the bi-decennial cycle (1976, 1996 and 2016). The [[United Nations General Assembly]] decided to convene The Habitat III Conference in its resolution 66/207. The Habitat III Conference reinvigorates the global commitment to sustainable [[urbanization]], to focus on the implementation of a “New Urban Agenda”.

Habitat III was one of the first United Nations global summits after the adoption of the [[Post-2015 Development Agenda]]. It gave the opportunity to open discussions on important urban challenges and questions, such as how to plan and manage [[cities]], [[town]]s and [[village]]s for [[sustainable development]]. The discussion of these questions shape the implementation of new global development and [[climate change]] goals. In particular the conference elaborates on Goal #11 of the [[Sustainable Development Goals]]: "Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable."&lt;ref name=AmannJurasszovich2017&gt;Wolfgang Amann &amp; Sandra Jurasszovich, "Habitat III — a critical review of the New Urban Agenda"; ''Housing Finance International'', Spring 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

[[Habitat I]] was the first United Nations Conference on Human Settlements, held in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]], [[Canada]], May 31 - June 11, 1976, governments began to recognize the need for [[sustainable]] [[human settlements]] and the consequences of rapid [[urbanization]], especially in the developing world. The conference outcomes were integrated the Vancouver Declaration on Human Settlements,&lt;ref&gt;The Vancouver Declaration of Human Settlements [http://unhabitat.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/The_Vancouver_Declaration_19761.pdf.]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}"UN-Habitat".Retrieved September 1, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; which carried an action plan with 64 recommendations for National Action.

The process towards Habitat III include the elaboration of national and regional reports -that will converge in a Global Report- to provide evidence based knowledge on the implementation of the Habitat Agenda and a comprehensive analysis on the global state of urbanization as well as good practices and tools both at the policy and intervention level. 

22 stock taking papers on relevant topics, Habitat III Issue Papers,&lt;ref&gt;Issue Papers and Policy Units [http://unhabitat.org/issue-papers-and-policy-units/.]"UN-Habitat".Retrieved September 1, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; were developed through a collaborative exercise of the United Nations system coordinated by the Habitat III Secretariat.

A number of official Regional and Thematic High Level Meetings involving a wide range of participants are debating priorities for the New Urban Agenda and policy recommendations in the form of a final participants' declaration. The final declaration from Regional and Thematic meetings will be considered official inputs to the Habitat III process.&lt;ref&gt;Regional and Thematic Meetings for the Preparatory Process of Habitat III [http://unhabitat.org/regional-and-thematic-meetings.]"UN-Habitat".Retrieved September 1, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

A total of 10 policy papers on relevant topics will be developed by Policy Units&lt;ref&gt;Issue Papers and Policy Units [http://unhabitat.org/issue-papers-and-policy-units/.]"UN-Habitat".Retrieved September 1, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; composed of 20 experts each, coming from different geographic areas and constituencies .

=== Engagement===

The debate towards Habitat III is an ongoing process that includes past sessions of the World Urban Forums, especially the last one held in 2014 in [[Medellin]], [[Colombia]], and National Urban Forums&lt;ref&gt;National Urban Forums [http://unhabitat.org/nuf.]"UN-Habitat".Retrieved September 1, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  to discuss and deliberate on national priority subjects including the preparation of the HIII National Reports.
Beyond the governmental participation in the process through the [[General Assembly]], the engagement to the Conference will include the General Assembly of Partners (GAP) to serve as a broad-based deliberative platform for non-governmental partners in order to develop a consensus for a joined outcome document and other related matters for Habitat III.&lt;ref&gt;How Partners Can Contribute to Habitat III {{cite web |url=http://www.worldurbancampaign.org/how-partners-can-contribute-to-habitat-iii-2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906155342/http://www.worldurbancampaign.org/how-partners-can-contribute-to-habitat-iii-2/ |archivedate=2015-09-06 |df= }}"UN-Habitat".Retrieved September 1, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Together Towards Habitat III campaign also promote a Global Citizenship Survey (2015/16) to embrace all contributions on the path to the final outcome of the Conference harvested through activities and initiatives to raise awareness on the New Urban Agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Together Towards Habitat III [http://unhabitat.org/together-towards-habitat-iii/ ] "UN-Habitat".Retrieved September 1, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
At Habitat III, [[SuRe]]® – The Standard for Sustainable and Resilient Infrastructure, a global voluntary standard which integrates key criteria of sustainability and resilience into infrastructure development and upgrade, was presented by [[Global Infrastructure Basel Foundation]] to the broader public.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gib-foundation.org/news/&lt;/ref&gt;

== New Urban Agenda ==
The primary goal and outcome of the conference was agreement by UN member states on the New Urban Agenda (NUA), which will serve as a guideline for urban development for the next twenty years.&lt;ref name=Broto /&gt;

A "zero draft" of the New Urban Agenda was released in May 2016 and subsequently edited. The [[United Nations General Assembly]] agreed on the final text in September 2016.&lt;ref name=BravoGuaralda2017&gt;Luisa Bravo &amp; Mirko Guaralda, "Our commitment to implement contents related to public space included in the New Urban Agenda adopted at the UN Habitat III conference"; ''Journal of Public Space'' 2(1), 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The NUA makes frequent references to related UN agreements, including the [[Rio Declaration on Environment and Development]] passed in 1992, and the [[2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development]], the [[International Guidelines on Urban and Territorial Planning]], the [[Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction]] (2015–2030), and the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference|Paris climate agreement]], all issued in 2015.&lt;ref name=AmannJurasszovich2017 /&gt;

The four mechanisms envisioned for effecting the New Urban Agenda are:&lt;ref name=Watson2016&gt;Vanessa Watson, "Locating planning in the New Urban Agenda of the urban sustainable development goal"; ''Planning Theory'' 15(4), 2016; [[doi:10.1177/1473095216660786]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://habitat3.org/the-new-urban-agenda/ New Urban Agenda]'', Habitat III Secretariat, 2017; A/RES/71/256*; {{ISBN|978-92-1-132731-1}}; p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;
# National urban policies promoting "integrated systems of cities and human settlements" in furtherance of "sustainable integrated urban development".
# Stronger urban [[governance]] "with sound institutions and mechanisms that empower and include urban stakeholders" along with checks and balances, to promote predictability, social inclusion, economic growth, and environmental protection.
# Reinvigorated "long-term and integrated urban and territorial planning and design in order to optimize the spatial dimension of the urban form and deliver the positive outcomes of urbanization"; and 
# Effective financing frameworks "to create, sustain and share the value generated by sustainable urban development in an inclusive manner."

=== Urban planning ===
[[Urban planning]] is the mechanism by which much of the New Urban Agenda can be accomplished. In particular NUA ¶51 calls for:&lt;ref name=AmannJurasszovich2017 /&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;urban planning and design instruments that support sustainable management and use of natural resources and land, appropriate compactness and density, polycentrism, and mixed uses, through infill or planned urban extension strategies as applicable, to trigger economies of scale and agglomeration, strengthen food system planning, enhance resource efficiency, urban resilience, and environmental sustainability. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ¶66 the parties endorse a [[smart city]] model:&lt;ref name=AmannJurasszovich2017 /&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;We commit ourselves to adopting a smart-city approach that makes use of opportunities from digitization, clean energy and technologies, as well as innovative transport technologies, thus providing options for inhabitants to make more environmentally friendly choices and boost sustainable economic growth and enabling cities to improve their service delivery.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Right to the city ===
The NUA includes language about a "[[right to the city]]", a debated concept referring to popular control over urban processes, but without definite implications for who will prevail when different parties' interests are in conflict.&lt;ref name=Broto /&gt;

=== Financing ===
The NUA calls for both [[public finance|public]] and [[private sector|private]] financing. Public financing may be derived from the economic gains from urbanization, including land and property value and infrastructure projects. Development funds and [[International financial institutions|development bank]]s are envisioned as "intermediaries for urban financing". (NUA ¶130–153).&lt;ref name=AmannJurasszovich2017 /&gt;

Private funding is envisioned especially for [[real estate]] and [[housing]]; the NUA encourages
&lt;blockquote&gt;the participation of a diverse range of multilateral financial institutions, regional development banks and development finance institutions, cooperation agencies, private-sector lenders and investors, cooperatives, moneylenders and microfinance banks to invest in affordable and incremental housing in all its forms. (NUA ¶140)&lt;ref name=AmannJurasszovich2017 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Madame de Meuron.jpg|thumb|[[Elisabeth de Meuron|Madame de Meuron]] with ear trumpet]]
The first [[hearing aid]] was created in the 17th century. The movement toward modern hearing aids began with the creation of the [[telephone]], and the first electric hearing aid was created in 1898. By the late 20th century, the digital hearing aid was distributed to the public commercially. Some of the first hearing aids were external hearing aids. External hearing aids directed sounds in front of the ear and blocked all other noises. The apparatus would fit behind or in the ear.

The invention of the [[carbon microphone]], [[transmitters]], digital signal processing chip or [[Digital signal processor|DSP]], and the development of [[computer]] technology helped transform the hearing aid to its present form.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Howard, Alexander. "Hearing Aids: Smaller and Smarter." New York Times, November 26, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ear trumpets==
{{Main|Ear trumpet}}
[[File:King goa's chair.jpg|thumb|right|Frederick Rein's ingenious acoustic chair, designed for King [[John VI of Portugal]] in the early 19th-century.]]
The use of ear trumpets for the partially deaf, dates back to the 17th century.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; By the late 18th century, their use was becoming increasingly common. Collapsible conical ear trumpets were made by instrument makers on a one-off basis for specific clients. Well known models of the period included the Townsend Trumpet (made by the [[deaf education|deaf educator]] John Townshend), the Reynolds Trumpet (specially built for painter [[Joshua Reynolds]]) and the Daubeney Trumpet.

The first firm to begin commercial production of the ear trumpet was established by Frederick C. Rein in London in 1800. As well as producing ear trumpets, Rein also sold  hearing fans, and [[speaking tube]]s. These instruments helped amplify sounds, while still being portable. However, these devices were generally bulky and had to be physically supported from below. Later, smaller, hand-held [[ear trumpet]]s and cones were used as hearing aids.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Levitt, H. "Digital hearing aids: wheelbarrows to ear inserts." ASHA Leader 12, no. 17 (December 26, 2007): 28-30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Mills, Mara. "Hearing Aids and the History of Electronics Miniaturization." IEEE Annals of the History of Computing 33.2 (2011): 24-44.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rein hearing aid catalog.jpg|thumb|left|Frederick Rein Ltd.'s catalog, displaying evolving 19th century designs.]] 
Rein was commissioned to design a special acoustic chair for the ailing King of [[Portugal]], [[John VI of Portugal]] in 1819. The throne was designed with ornately carved arms that looked like the open mouths of lions. These holes acted as the receiving area for the acoustics, which were transmitted to the back of the throne via a speaking tube, and into the king's ear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beckerexhibits.wustl.edu/did/19thcent/part2.htm|title=Concealed Hearing Devices of the 19th Century}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Finally in the late 1800s, the acoustic horn, which was a tube that had two ends, a cone that captured sound, and was eventually made to fit in the ear.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;  

Toward the late 19th century, hidden hearing aids became increasingly popular. Rein pioneered many notable designs, including his 'acoustic headbands', where the hearing aid device was artfully concealed within the hair or headgear. Reins' ''Aurolese Phones'' were headbands, made in a variety of shapes, that incorporated sound collectors near the ear that would amplify the acoustics. Hearing aids were also hidden in couches, clothing, and accessories. This drive toward ever increasing invisibility was often more about hiding the individual's disability from the public than about helping the individual cope with his problem.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

==Electronic hearing aids==
[[File:Vacuum tube hearing aid use 1933.jpg|thumb|A 1933 ad for early vacuum tube hearing aids.]]
[[File:Museum of Medicine Berlin Germany Telephone hearing aids.jpg|thumb|These German hearing aids date from around 1920 to 1950. They include an attachment similar to a telephone receiver. Museum of Medicine, Berlin, Germany.]]
The first electronic hearing aids were constructed after the invention of the [[telephone]] and [[microphone]] in the 1870s and 1880s. The technology within the telephone increased how acoustic signal could be altered. Telephones were able to control the [[loudness]], [[frequency]], and distortion of sounds. These abilities were used in the creation of the hearing aid.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

The first electric hearing aid, called the Akouphone, was created by [[Miller Reese Hutchison]] in 1898. It used a carbon transmitter, so that the hearing aid could be portable. The [[carbon transmitter]] was used to amplify sound by taking a weak signal and using [[electric current]] to make it a strong signal.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; These electronic hearing aids could eventually be shrunk into purses and other accessories.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;  

One of the first manufacturers of the electronically amplified hearing aid was the [[Siemens]] company in 1913. Their hearing aids were bulky and not easily portable. They were about the size of a "tall cigar box" and had a speaker that would fit in the ear.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

The first [[vacuum-tube]] hearing aid was patented by a Naval [[engineer]] Earl Hanson in 1920. It was called the Vactuphone and used the telephone [[transmitter]] to turn speech into electrical signals. After the signal was converted, it would be amplified when it moved to the receiver. The hearing aid weighed seven pounds, which made it light enough to be carried.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; [[Marconi]] in England and [[Western Electric]] in the US began marketing vacuum tube hearing aids in 1923.

During the 1920s and 1930s, the vacuum tube hearing aid became more successful and began to decrease in size with better miniaturization techniques. The Acousticon's Model 56 was created in the mid-1920s and was one of the first portable hearing aid units, although it was quite heavy.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;  The first wearable hearing aid using vacuum tube technology went on sale in England in 1936, and a year later in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aKbApRUm4kkC|title=Audiologists' Desk Reference: Audiologic management, rehabilitation, and terminology|author=James Wilbur Hall|year=1998|publisher=Cengage Learning|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1930s, hearing aids were becoming popular to the public.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; [[Multitone Electronics|Multitone of London]] patented the first hearing aid to use [[automatic gain control]]. The same company introduced a wearable version in 1948.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;  

Military technological advances that occurred in [[World War II]] helped the development of hearing aids. One of the major advances that World War II enabled was the idea of miniaturization.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;  This could be seen by Zenith's pocket-sized Miniature 75.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

==Transistor hearing aids== 
[[File:Hearing aid 1980s close up.jpg|thumb|200x200px|This early 1980s photo shows a hearing aid with a transistor that is worn over the chest with shoulder straps. It would sometimes have a problem with static interference, even if the wearer laughed or smiled.]]
The development of [[transistors]] in 1948 by [[Bell Laboratories]] led to major improvements to the hearing aid.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;  The transistor was invented by [[John Bardeen]], [[Walter Brattain]], and [[William Shockley]].  Transistors were created to replace vacuum tubes; they were small, required less battery power and had less [[distortion]] and heat than their predecessor.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;  These vacuum tubes were typically hot and fragile, so the transistor was the ideal replacement.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;K., W. (1953, Apr 19). Transistors in need of improvement. New York Times (1923-Current File), pp. E9.&lt;/ref&gt;The 1952 [[Sonotone 1010]] used a transistor stage along with vacuum tubes, to extend battery life.   The size of these transistors led to developments in miniature, carbon microphones. These microphones could be mounted on various items, even eyeglasses.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;  In 1951, [[Raytheon]] manufactured the transistor and was one of the first companies to mass-produce transistors to throughout America. Raytheon realized that their hearing aid only lasted short-term and began to sell the vacuum-tube hearing aids again along with transistor hearing aids.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

The act of putting transistors into hearing aids was so quick that they were not properly tested. It was later found that transistors could get damp. Because of this dampness, the hearing aid would only last for a few weeks and then die. In order to stop this from happening, a coating had to be put on the transistor to protect it from the dampness. This problem had to be fixed in order for transistors in hearing aids to be successful.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;   

Zenith was the first company to realize the problem with transistors was the body heat of individuals. After coming to this conclusion, the first “all-transistor” hearing aids were offered in 1952, called the Microtone Transimatic and the Maico Transist-ear. In 1954, the company, [[Texas Instruments]], produced a [[silicon]] transistor, which was much more effective than the previous version.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;  The end of the transistor was marked by the creation of the [[integrated circuit]] or IC by Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments in 1958 and the technique was perfected in hearing aids over the next 20 years.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

Elmer V. Carlson, the author of thirty patents, was instrumental in inventing many of the components of the modern hearing aid.&lt;ref&gt; http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-01-25/news/0301250251_1_hearing-aids-mr-carlson-elmer&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.etymotic.com/media/publications/erl-0114-1992.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digital hearing aid== 
Beginning in the early 1960s, Bell Telephone Laboratories created a process for creating both speech and audio signals on a large [[mainframe computer]]. Because of the size of digital computers, the process of simulating hearing aids was extremely slow. The progression of the audio speech signal took longer than the length of the duration of the signal itself. In order to get the power needed to process the sound, a large mainframe computer was needed. This made it nearly impossible to conceive the idea that hearing aids could be made into something that could be made to fit onto an ear. This research was important for learning about how to develop sounds for those with hearing disabilities.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;     

In addition, in the 1970s, the [[microprocessor]] was created. This microprocessor helped to open up the door to miniaturization of the hearing aid.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; Moreover, researcher [[Edgar Villchur]] developed multi-channel [[amplitude compression]]. Amplitude compression enabled [[audio signal]] to be separated into [[frequency band]]s. These bands were able to adjust sounds so that sounds that were more intensive were weakened and sounds that were weakened would become more intensified. The system of multi-channel amplitude compression would be later used as the fundamental structural design for the first hearing aids that used [[digital technology]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;
  
[[File:Traditional hearing aids.jpg|thumb|Some hearing aids from the early 21st century with traditional designs.]]
Another pioneer in hearing aid development was Daniel Graupe, who developed the six-channel hearing aid. The six-channel hearing aid in 1975 had digital control of the frequency in all channels. In 1979, electro-acoustic features of hearing aids were able to be changed by a simple button. The pressing of this button caused the amplification to be altered to appropriate levels for the environment in which the individual was present.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; This technique of controlling the hearing aid for the environment is used in some manner throughout all digital hearing aids.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

The creation of high-speed digital-array [[processors]] used in [[minicomputers]] opened up the door for advances in digital hearing aids.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;  These minicomputers were able to process audio signals at speeds that were equivalent to real-time. In 1982, at the [[City University of New York]], the first real-time all digital hearing aid was created. The equipment contained a digital array processor and minicomputer. This consisted of an FM [[radio transmitter]] and receiver. The radio made a connection between the individual through a transmitter on the body to the radio on top of the computer. The transmitter on the body was connected by a wire to the ear microphone and the receiver.  Even though this was a major breakthrough in the creation of hearing aids, there were still a few problems. One of these major problems was that while the hearing aid worked, it was extremely heavy and nearly impossible to move.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;
[[File:Oticon Bluetooth hearing aids.jpg|thumb|left|Oticon hearing aids to be used with [[Bluetooth]] wireless devices.]]

The first commercial digital hearing aid was created in 1987 by the Nicolet Corporation. The hearing aid contained a body-worn processor that had a hardwire connection with an ear mounted transducer. While the Nicolet Corporation’s hearing aid was not publicly successful and the company shortly folded, it was able to start a competition between companies to create more effective hearing aids. Two years later, in 1989, the behind-the-ear (BTE) digital hearing aid was launched.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

In addition to the Nicolet Corporation, Bell Laboratories expanded upon the hearing aid business by developing a hybrid digital-analog hearing aid. This hearing aid used digital circuits to handle a two-channel compression amplifier. Even though early research on this hearing aid was successful, [[AT&amp;T]], the parent company to Bell Laboratories, pulled out of the hearing aid market and sold its rights to Resound Corporation in 1987. When the hearing aid was put on in the market, it was instantaneously successful. This development helped bring major changes to the world of the hearing aid.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

After the success of the Resound Corporation, other hearing aid companies began putting out hybrid hearing aids that included analog amplifiers, filters, and limiters that were managed digitally. There were many benefits to these hearing aids; which included storing parameter settings, having a capability for paired-comparison testing, having settings for different acoustic environments, and having more advanced methods of signaling; this which included multi-channel compression.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The next major milestone was creating an all-digital hearing aid. The Oticon Company developed the first digital hearing aid in 1995, but it was only distributed to audiological research centers for research on digital technology in the realm of acoustic amplification. The Senso was the first commercially successful, all-digital hearing aid, and was created by Widex in 1996.  After the success of the Senso, Oticon began marketing their own hearing aid, the DigiFocus.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Current digital hearing aids are now programmable which enables digital hearing aids to regulate the sound on their own, without using a separate control. The hearing aid can now adjust itself depending on what environment it is in and often does not even need a physical volume control button.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Kenneth. "Hearing Aid Museum ." Kent State University Excellence in Action. http://www.kent.edu/ehhs/spa/museum/history.cfm (accessed May 15, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently,  "Made for iPhone hearing aids" (MFi) were introduced by Resound, which enables users of MFi digital hearing aids to stream phone calls, music, and podcasts directly from iOS devices. &lt;ref&gt;Apple, Inc. "Made for iPhone Hearing Aids" https://www.apple.com/accessibility/ios/hearing-aids/ (accessed January 28, 2016). &lt;/ref&gt; 

Directly leveraging the audio processing power potential in smartphones, Jacoti BVBA from Belgium developed ListenApp, the first digital hearing aid application to win CE certification and FDA approval as a medical device. &lt;ref&gt;Jacoti, BVBA, "Jacoti ListenApp" https://www.jacoti.com/listenapp/ (accessed January 28, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hearing aid chips==
One of the first digital chips was created by Daniel Graupe.  The digital chip, referred to as the Zeta Noise Blocker, routinely adjusted the gain in the frequency channels to help control high levels of noise.  The chip was integrated in a number of hearing aids in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  In addition to the Zeta Noise Blocker, there was a development of digital chips that were devoted to high-speed [[digital signal processing]] or DSP. DSP chips became available in 1982, and began to be implemented into hearing aids. By 1988, chips were produced in hearing aids. One of the major contributions of these chips was the ability to process both speech and other types of noises in real time. One major down fall of these chips was that they were massive and used up a lot of battery, which made them nearly impossible to be worn.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20725">The establishment of [[industrial ecology]] as field of scientific research is commonly attributed to an article devoted to industrial ecosystems, written by Frosch and Gallopoulos, which appeared in a 1989 special issue of Scientific American.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Frosch | first1 = R.A. | last2 = Gallopoulos | first2 = N.E. | year = 1989 | title = Strategies for Manufacturing | url = | journal = Scientific American | volume = 261 | issue = 3| pages = 144–152 | doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0989-144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Industrial ecology emerged from several earlier ideas and concepts, some of which date back to the 19th century.

== Before the 1960s ==

The term "[[Industrial Ecology|industrial ecology]]" has been used alongside "[[Industrial Symbiosis|industrial symbiosis]]" at least since the 1940s. [[Economic geography]] was perhaps one of the first fields to use these terms. For example, in an article published in 1947, George T. Renner refers to "The General Principle of Industrial Location" as a "Law of Industrial Ecology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Renner | first1 = G.T. | year = 1947 | title = Geography of Industrial Localization | url = | journal = Economic Geography | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 167–189 | doi=10.2307/141510 | jstor = 141510 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Briefly stated this is:

{{quote|Any industry tends to locate at a point which provides optimum access to its ingredients or component elements. If all these component elements be juxtaposed, the location of the industry is predetermined. If, however, they occur widely separated, the industry is so located as to be most accessible to that element which would be the most expensive or difficult to transport and which, therefore, becomes the locative factor for the industry in question.}}

In the same article the author defines and describes industrial symbiosis:

{{quote|Often the location of an industry cannot be fully understood solely in terms of its locative ingredient elements. There are relationships between industries, sometimes simple, but often quite complex, which enter into and complicate the analysis. Chief among these is the phenomenon of [[industrial symbiosis]]. By this is meant the consorting together of two or more of dissimilar industries. Industrial Symbiosis, when scrutinized, is seen to be of two kinds, disjunctive and conjunctive.}}

It appears that the concept of Industrial Symbiosis was not new for the field of economic geography, since the same categorization is used by Walter G. Lezius in his 1937 article "Geography of Glass Manufacture at Toledo, Ohio", also published in the Journal of Economic Geography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lezius | first1 = Walter G | year = 1937 | title = Geography of Glass Manufacture at Toledo, Ohio | jstor = 141587| journal = Economic Geography | volume = 13 | issue = 4| pages = 402–412 | doi=10.2307/141587}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Used in a different context, the term "Industrial Ecology" is also found in a 1958 paper concerned with the relationship between the ecological impact from increasing urbanization and value orientations of related peoples. The case study is in Lebanon:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Armstrong | first1 = L. | last2 = Bashshur | first2 = R. | year = 1958 | title = Ecological Patterns and Value Orientations in Lebanon | journal = Public Opinion Quarterly | volume = 22 | issue = 3| pages = 406–415 | jstor=2746350 | doi = 10.1086/266808 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The central ecological variable in the present research is ecological mobility, or the movement of men in space. It is patent that modern Industrial Ecology requires more such adaptive mobility than does traditional folk-village organization.}}

== 1960s ==

In 1963, we find the term Industrial Ecology (defined as the "complex ecology of the modern industrial world") being used to describe the social nature and complexity of (and within) industrial systems:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barnard | first1 = F | year = 1963 | title = Education for management conceived as a study of Industrial Ecology | journal = Journal of Vocational Education &amp; Training | volume = 15 | issue = 30| pages = 22–26 | doi=10.1080/03057876380000041}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|...industrial organisations are social rather than mechanical systems. A firm is not only a working organisation with a working purpose. It is rather a community with its own 'politics', in so far as it is involved in problems concerned with the proper distribution of power between individuals and groups of individuals and with questions of individual and group prestige, influence, status and standing... [and he concludes that] the understanding which the student of management is expected to gain is no less than the attainment of insight into an [[Industrial Ecology]] of great complexity.}}

In 1967, the President of the American association for the advancement of science writes in "The experimental city"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Spilhaus |first1=Athelstan |year=1967 |title=The experimental city |journal=Daedalus |volume=96 |issue=4 |pages=1129–41 |jstor=20027108 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that "There are examples of [[industrial symbiosis]] where one industry feeds off, or at least neutralizes, the wastes of another..." The same author in 1970 talks about "The Next Industrial Revolution"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.167.3926.1673 |pmid=17729610 |title=The Next Industrial Revolution |journal=Science |volume=167 |issue=3926 |pages=1673 |year=1970 |last1=Spilhaus |first1=A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of material and energy sharing and reuse is central to his proposal for a new industrial revolution and he cites agro-[[industrial symbiosis]] as a practical way for achieving this:

{{quote|The object of the next industrial revolution is to ensure that there will be no such thing as waste, on the basis that waste is simply some substance that we do not vet have the wit to use... The next industrial revolution is this generating of a huge new [industry that]... will not produce products, it will rather reprocess the things we call wastes so they may be reproduced in the factories into the things we need... Having the city near the rural area will enable waste heat to be used to speed up the biological processes of treating the organic wastes before they go back into the land. This might end in an elegant arrangement-the power plants located close enough to the center of use, to the people who need the power, but also, within the economics, close enough to the agriculture lands so that the waste heat may be used there. This is an example of agro-industrial symbiosis, if you like to call it that.}}

In these early articles, "Industrial Ecology" is used in its literal sense - as a system of interacting industrial entities. The relation to natural ecosystems (through either metaphor or analogy) is not explicit. Industrial Symbiosis on the other hand, is already clearly defined as a type of industrial organization, and the term symbiosis is borrowed from the ecological sciences to describe an analogous phenomenon in industrial systems.

== 1970s ==

Industrial Ecology has been a research subject of the Japan Industrial Policy Research Institute since 1971. Their definition of Industrial Ecology is "research for the prospect of dynamic harmonization between human activities and nature by a systems approach based upon ecology (JIPRI, 1983)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ogawa | first1 = H. | last2 = Sato | first2 = K. | last3 = Jo | first3 = N. | last4 = Noro | first4 = K. | last5 = Tsuchiya | first5 = K. | year = 1986 | title = Modelling of industrial ecological systems for evaluation of health services | journal = Ecological Modelling | volume = 31 | issue = 1–4| pages = 329–339 | doi=10.1016/0304-3800(86)90073-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This programme has resulted to a number of reports that are available only in Japanese.

One of the earliest definitions of  Industrial Ecology was proposed by Harry Zvi Evan at a seminar of the Economic Commission of Europe in Warsaw (Poland) in 1973 (an article was subsequently published by Evan in the Journal for International Labour Review in 1974 vol. 110 (3), pp.&amp;nbsp;219–233). Evan defined Industrial Ecology as a systematic analysis of industrial operations including factors like: Technology, environment, natural resources, bio-medical aspects, institutional and legal matters as well as the socio-economic aspects.

In 1974 the term of Industrial Ecology is perhaps for the first time associated with a cyclical production mode (rather than a linear one, resulting to waste). In this article, the necessity for a transition to an "open-world Industrial Ecology", is used as argument for the need to establish lunar industries:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ehricke | first1 = K.A. | year = 1974 | title = Lunar industries and their value for the human environment on Earth | journal = Acta Astronautica | volume = 1 | issue = 5–6| pages = 585–622 | doi=10.1016/0094-5765(74)90023-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Low living standards provide one strong motive for most developing countries to increase their productivity and grow economically. Population increase (while it lasts) is a still more powerful driver for increased world consumption. Thus the pressure on resources will continue to grow. Instead of deploring it, we better grow with it. Only through transition to an open-world [[Industrial Ecology]] - which includes both benign industrial revolution on Earth and extraterrestrial industrialization - can the present apparent limits to growth be overcome.}}

Many elements of modern Industrial Ecology were commonplace in the industrial sectors of the former Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sathre | first1 = R. | last2 = Grdzelishvili | first2 = I. | year = 2006 | title = Industrial symbiosis in the former Soviet Union | url = | journal = Progress in Industrial Ecology | volume = 3 | issue = 4| pages = 379–392 | doi=10.1504/pie.2006.011743}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, “kombinirovanaia produksia” (combined production) was present from the earliest years of the Soviet Union and was instrumental in shaping the patterns of Soviet industrialization. “Bezotkhodnoyi tekhnologii” (waste-free technology) was introduced in the final decades of the USSR as a way to increase industrial production while limiting environmental impact. Fiodor Davitaya, a Soviet scientist from the [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic|Republic of Georgia]], described in 1977 the analogy relating industrial systems to natural systems as a model for a desirable transition to cleaner production:

{{quote|Nature operates without any waste products. What is rejected by some organisms provides food for others. The organisation of industry on this principle—with the waste products of some branches of industry providing raw material for others—means in effect using natural processes as a model, for in them the resolution of all arising contradictions is the motive force of progress.&lt;ref&gt;Davitaya, F. (1977) "Changes in the atmosphere and some problems of its protection" pp. 99–110 in ''Society and the Environment: A Soviet View''; Moscow: Progress Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== 1980s ==

By the 80s Industrial Ecology was already "promoted" to a research subject, which several institutes around the globe embraced. In a 1986 article published in the Journal of Ecological Modeling, there is a full description of Industrial Ecology and the [[analogy]] to natural [[ecosystems]] is clearly stated:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ogawa | first1 = H. | last2 = Sato | first2 = K. | last3 = Jo | first3 = N. | last4 = Noro | first4 = K. | last5 = Tsuchiya | first5 = K. | year = 1986 | title = Modelling of industrial ecological systems for evaluation of health services | journal = Ecological Modelling | volume = 31 | issue = 1–4| pages = 329–339 | doi=10.1016/0304-3800(86)90073-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The structure and inner-working of an industrial society resemble those of a natural ecosystem. The concepts in ecology such as habitat, succession, trophic level, limiting factors and community metabolism can also apply to the study of the ecology of an industrial society. For instance, an industry in a society may grow or decline as a consequence of dynamic changes in exogenous limiting resources and in the hierarchical and/or metabolic structure of that society. When studying the ecology of an industrial society (henceforth termed '[[Industrial Ecology]]'), these concepts and methodologies employed in ecosystems analyses are useful.}}

In fact, in the above article there is an attempt to model an "industrial ecological system". The model is composed of seven major sections: industry, population, labor force, living state, environment and pollution, general health, and occupational health. Notice the rough similarity with Evan's factors as stated in the above section.

During the 80s the emergence of another related term, "[[industrial metabolism]]", is observed. The term is used as a metaphor for the organization and functioning of industrial activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hicks | first1 =  | year = 1983 | title = The Property Tax in a New Industrial Era | jstor = 3700958| journal = Proceedings of the Academy of Political Science | volume = 35 | issue = 1| pages =  208–221| doi=10.2307/3700958}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article defending the "biological modulation of terrestrial carbon cycle", the author includes an extraordinary parenthetical note:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schidlowski | first1 = M | year = 1984 | title = Biological modulation of the terrestrial carbon cycle: isotope clues to early organic evolution | url = | journal = Advances in Space Research | volume = 4 | issue = 12| pages = 183–93 | pmid = 11537773 | doi=10.1016/0273-1177(84)90561-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Parenthetically, it should be noted that it is an intrinsic property of life to proliferate exponentially until the encounter of limits set by (I) the availability of biologically utilizable reducing power, or (2) the exhaustion of some critical nutrient, or (3) an autotoxic effect imposed by life on its own environment. These limits are universal, applying to microbial ecosystems as well as to the population dynamics of a seemingly unrestricted biological superdominant such as Homo Sapiens (here, the ultimate limit is likely to be placed by an autotoxic effect exerted by the "extrasomatic" (industrial) metabolism of the human race).}}

=== 1989 – Decisive articles ===

In 1989 two articles were released that played a decisive role in the history of industrial ecology. The first one was titled "Industrial Metabolism" by Robert Ayres. Ayres essentially lays the foundations of Industrial Ecology, although the term is not to be found in this article. In the appendix of the article he includes "a theoretical exploration of the biosphere and the industrial economy as material-transformation systems and lessons that might be learned from their comparison". He proposes that:&lt;ref&gt;Ayres, R.U. 1989. Industrial Metabolism. In Technology and Environment,J.H. Ausubel and H.E. Sladovich, 23–49. 1st. Washington DC: National Academy Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|We may think of both the biosphere and the industrial economy as systems for the transformation of materials. The biosphere as it now exists is nearly a perfect system for recycling materials. This was not the case when life on earth began. The industrial system of today resembles the earliest stage of biological evolution, when the most primitive living organisms obtained their energy from a stock of organic molecules accumulated during prebiotic times. It is increasingly urgent for us to learn from the biosphere and modify our industrial metabolism, the energy - and value - yielding process essential to economic development... we should not only postulate, but indeed endorse, a long-run imperative favoring an industrial metabolism that results in reduced extraction of virgin materials, reduced loss of waste materials, and increased recycling of useful ones.}}

The term "Industrial Ecology" gains mainstream attention later the same year (1989) through a "[[Scientific American]]" article named "Strategies for Manufacturing". In this article, R.Frosch and N.Gallopoulos wonder "why would not our industrial system behave like an [[ecosystem]], where the wastes of a species may be [[natural resource|resource]] to another species? Why would not the outputs of an industry be the inputs of another, thus reducing use of raw materials, pollution, and saving on [[waste]] treatment?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Frosch | first1 = R.A. | last2 = Gallopoulos | first2 = N.E. | year = 1989 | title = Strategies for Manufacturing | url = | journal = Scientific American | volume = 261 | issue = 3| pages = 144–152 | doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0989-144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This vision gave birth to the concept of the Eco-industrial Park, the industrial complex that is governed by Industrial Ecology principles. A notable example resides in a Danish industrial park in the city of [[Kalundborg]]. There, several linkages of byproducts and waste heat can be found between numerous entities such as a large power plant, an oil refinery, a pharmaceutical plant, a plasterboard factory, an enzyme manufacturer, a waste company and the city itself.&lt;ref&gt;The Kalundborg Centre for [[industrial symbiosis]] (2007) http://www.symbiosis.dk/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Frosch|Frosch's]] and Gallopoulos' thinking was in certain ways simply an extension of earlier ideas, such as the efficiency and waste-reduction thinking annunciated by [[Buckminster Fuller]] and his students (e.g., [[J. Baldwin]]), and parallel ideas about energy [[cogeneration]], such as those of [[Amory Lovins]] and the [[Rocky Mountain Institute]].

== 1990s ==

In 1991, C. Kumar Patel organized a seminal colloquium on Industrial Ecology, held on May 20 and 21, 1991, at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington D.C. The papers were later published in the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] USA, and they form an excellent reference on Industrial Ecology. Papers include:

== 21st century ==

The ''Journal of Industrial Ecology'' (since 1997), the International Society for Industrial Ecology (since 2001), and the journal ''Progress in Industrial Ecology'' (since 2004) have covered [[industrial ecology]] in the international scientific community. Principles of industrial ecology are also emerging in various policy realms such as the concept of the circular economy that is being promoted in China. Although the definition of the circular economy has yet to be formalized, generally the focus is on strategies such as creating a circular flow of materials, and cascading energy flows. An example of this would be using [[waste heat]] from one process to run another process that requires a lower temperature. This maximizes the efficiency of [[exergy]] use. This strategy aims for a more efficient economy with fewer pollutants and other unwanted by-products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yuan | first1 = Z | last2 = Bi | first2 = J | last3 = Moriguichi | first3 = Y | year = 2008| title = The Circular Economy: A New Development Strategy in China | url = | journal = Journal of Industrial Ecology | volume = 10 | issue = 1–2| pages = 4–8 | doi=10.1162/108819806775545321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10089">{{Anthropology of kinship |concepts |image=Toraja house.jpg |caption=Three ''[[tongkonan]]'' noble "Houses" in a [[Toraja]]n village, Sulawesi.}}

In [[anthropology]], a '''house society''' is a society where [[kinship]] and political relations are organized around membership in corporately-organized dwellings rather than around [[descent group]]s or [[Lineage (anthropology)|lineage]]s, as in the "[[House of Windsor]]". The concept was originally proposed by [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] who called them "''sociétés à maison''".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lévi-Strauss |first=Claude |title=The Way of the Mask |year=1982 |publisher=University of Washington Press |location=Seattle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lévi-Strauss, Claude. 1987. Anthropology and Myth: Lectures, 1951-1982. R. Willis, trans. Oxford: Basil Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has been applied to understand the organization of societies from [[Mesoamerica]] and the [[Moluccas]] to [[North Africa]] and medieval Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce, Rosemary A. &amp; Susan D. Gillespie (eds.). 2000. Beyond Kinship: Social and Material Reproduction in House Societies. University of Pennsylvania Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carsten, Janet &amp; Stephen Hugh-Jones (eds.) About the House: Lévi-Strauss and Beyond. Cambridge University Press, May 4, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

The House society is a hybrid, transitional form between kin-based and class-based social orders, and is not one of Lévi-Strauss' '[[Alliance theory|elementary structures]]' of kinship. Lévi-Strauss introduced the concept as an alternative to 'corporate kinship group' among the cognatic kinship groups of the Pacific region. The socially significant groupings within these societies have variable membership because kinship is reckoned bilaterally (through both father's and mother's kin) and come together for only short periods. Property, genealogy and residence are not the basis for the group's existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Errington |first=Shelly |title=Meaning and Power in a Southeast Asian Realm |year=1989 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton NJ |page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== House societies and kinship ==

Lévi-Strauss' most succinct definition of a House was that it is "a corporate body holding an estate made up of both material and immaterial wealth, which perpetuates itself through the transmission of its name, its goods and its titles down a real or imaginary line considered legitimate as long as this continuity can express itself in the language of kinship or of affinity and, most often, of both."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lévi-Strauss |first=Claude |title=The Way of the Mask |year=1982 |publisher=University of Washington Press |location=Seattle |page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three elements to this definition:&lt;ref name="Schrauwers 2004 75–6"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schrauwers |first=Albert |title=H(h)ouses, E(e)states and Class: On the Importance of Capitals in central Sulawesi |journal=Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde |year=2004 |volume=160 |issue=1 |pages=75–6 |doi=10.1163/22134379-90003735}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The House is a corporate body ("moral person") holding an estate made up of both material and immaterial goods.
# As a "moral person", it is an alternate metaphor replacing "blood" in defining the social identity of the group. As a symbol of the group, the House persists over generations and links the group to its sacred origins.
# The House persists over time by transmitting its titles through conditional kinship principles: "patrilineal descent and matrilineal descent, filiation and residence, hypergamy and hypogamy, close marriage and distant marriage, heredity and election: all these notions which usually allow anthropologists to distinguish the various known types of society, are united in the house, as if, in the last analysis the spirit (in the eighteenth-century sense) of this institution expressed an effort to transcend, in all spheres of collective life, theoretically incompatible principles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lévi-Strauss |first=Claude |title=The Way of the Mask |year=1982 |publisher=University of Washington Press |location=Seattle |page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only the core group (the highest-ranking members) will inhabit the House as a residence. The other House members (which Errington refers to as the "server group") will only come together on special ritual occasions, making this an "occasional kinship group." Other House members have multiple overlapping ties to other Houses as well, through both mother's and father's kin. Their ability to assert a claim to membership in a House will depend on a number of criteria, such as their parents' participation, their ability to contribute to the House's upkeep, and their participation in its rituals. Successful claims of membership may bring special benefits, such as the right to utilize House resources with the consent of the core members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Errington |first=Shelly |title=Meaning and Power in a Southeast Asian Realm |year=1989 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton NJ |pages=233–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== House societies and social ranking ==

Most of the examples of ‘sociétés à maison’ cited by Lévi-Strauss, with the exception of the [[Kwakwaka'wakw|Kwakiutl]] Indians of the North-west coast of Canada, were [[Feudalism|feudal]]. This has led some to ask if feudalism was an essential feature of House societies, and answering in the negative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Waterson |first=Roxanna |title=About the House: Lévi-Strauss and Beyond |year=1995 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=53–4 |chapter=Houses and hierarchies in island Southeast Asia |editor=Carsten J. and S. Hugh-Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schrauwers, in contrast, has argued that House societies are characteristically organized around a system of [[Social stratification|social ranks]], not feudalism. That is, the House is not an economic class but a socially ranked group (e.g. a nobility) in a society organized around a system of social ranks; while a House may own property, it is thus not tied to a feudal mode of production. Schrauwers gives, as an alternate example, societies organized around slavery where a noble group's property are its slaves (such as the Kwakiutl case).&lt;ref name="Schrauwers 2004 75–6"/&gt;

== Houses and politics ==
{{Political anthropology}}

Houses are political in three ways; there is an intra-House politics by which leadership is determined and resources are allocated within the House, as well as an inter-House politics between rival Houses. These two forms of political engagement may be connected through agonistic exchange institutions such as the [[Potlatch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Errington |first=Shelly |title=Meaning and Power in a Southeast Asian Realm |year=1989 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton NJ |pages=96–128}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is, lastly, also a politics of struggle and incorporation between highly ranked noble Houses and those groups like slaves and commoners who lack the resources to maintain their organization as a House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schrauwers |first=Albert |title=H(h)ouses, E(e)states and Class: On the Importance of Capitals in central Sulawesi |journal=Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde |year=2004 |volume=160 |issue=1 |pages=86–90 |doi=10.1163/22134379-90003735}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intra-House political struggle===
Houses are tied together through oftentimes contradictory forms of kinship, whether descent or alliance. Given that Houses are not lineages, leadership is rarely ascribed by genealogical seniority alone (i.e. [[primogeniture]]). Leadership of a House is gained through status competition.

===Inter-House political struggle===
A number of traditional Southeast Asian kingdoms, such as those in [[Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|Bali]], or the kingdom of [[Luwu]] in Sulawesi, were dominated by noble Houses that competed with each other for control of the state. These states have alternately been described as [[Mandala (Southeast Asian political model)|mandala]] states.

===Political struggles between classes within a House society===
Although they may be referred to as House Societies, not all societies with Houses have those Houses uniformly distributed among all ranks and classes. The House in Bali, as well as in the kingdom of Luwu in Sulawesi, is an "optional" kinship group. Schrauwers has argued that class and House formation are linked. He points out, for example, that the inherited estate of some Sulawesi House societies in the kingdom of Luwu is composed of slaves; that is, the House's property is composed of another social rank of individuals. In this case, class and rank are synonymous. Because they are property, slaves are prevented from forming their own Houses. Commoners in those societies are of a different rank, but lack property, and therefore cannot form their own houses either.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schrauwers|first=Albert|title=H(h)ouses, E(e)states and Class: On the Importance of Capitals in central Sulawesi|journal=Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde|year=2004|volume=160|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The way in which these lower classes were prevented from forming Houses was two-fold. On the one hand, they might be engaged in the agonistic exchange systems with Noble Houses that results in their using up and losing all of their House property. On the other hand, noble Houses at the centre of the state might engage in policies of divide and rule, urging different groups at the periphery to attack each other, take slaves, and these would form Houses which then intermarry with the Houses at the centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schrauwers |first=Albert |title=Houses, hierarchy, headhunting and exchange; Rethinking political relations in the Southeast Asian realm of Luwu |journal=Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde |year=1997 |volume=153 |issue=3 |pages=356–80 |doi=10.1163/22134379-90003928}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ink brushes''' ({{Zh|t=毛筆|s=毛笔|p=máo bǐ}}; {{lang-ja|筆|fude}}; {{lang-ko|붓/筆}}) are used in [[Chinese calligraphy]] as well as [[Japanese calligraphy]] and [[Korean calligraphy]] which have a root of Chinese calligraphy. They are also used in [[Chinese painting]] and other [[brush painting]] styles. The brush was invented in China around 300 B.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ong|first=Siew Chey|title=China condensed: 5000 years of history &amp; culture|year=2005|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|location=Singapore|isbn=978-981-261-067-6|pages=161|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bt7q8hfiZ4gC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women of China, Issues 1-6|year=1995|publisher=Foreign Language Press|pages=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nJWyAAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with the [[inkstone]], [[inkstick]] and [[Xuan paper]], these four writing implements form the [[Four Treasures of the Study]].

Brushes differ greatly in terms of size, texture, material, and cost. The brush hair chosen depends on one's needs at the moment; certain kinds of brushes are more suited to certain [[East asian script styles |script styles ]] and individuals than others. 
* '''Handle''': usually of bamboo, exotic brushes may instead use such materials as gold, silver, jade, ivory, [[red sandalwood]] or [[spotted bamboo]].
* '''Hair source''': normally the brush is made from goat, [[Siberian weasel]] (ch: 黄鼠狼 huángshǔláng, yellow-rat-wolf), pig, mouse, [[domestic buffalo|buffalo]], wolf, or rabbit hair, while exotic ones can be made from tiger, [[fowl]], deer, and even human hair (from a baby's first haircut, said to bring good fortune while taking the [[imperial examination]]s).
* '''Hair texture''': soft (ch: 軟毫 ruǎnháo), mixed (ch: 兼毫 jiānháo), or hard (ch: 硬毫 yìngháo) hair.
*'''Hair size''': generally classified as either big (ch: 大楷 dàkǎi, ja: 大筆 oofude), medium (ch: 中楷 zhōngkǎi, ja: 中筆 chufude), or small (ch: 小楷 xiǎokǎi, ja: 小筆 kofude)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first =莫山 |last =榊 |title =文房四宝 筆の話 |date =1981-05-30 |publisher =角川書店 |edition =1 |page =202}}&lt;/ref&gt;; most calligraphy is written with a medium-sized brush. The smallest brushes are used for very small pieces and for fashioning designs for seals. While medium size brushes are the most widely used, wielded by a skilled artist a medium brush can produce a variety of thicknesses of line from very thin to fairly thick. The largest brushes are used only for very large pieces.
*'''Hair length''': generally classified by hair length for thickness of handle as either long (ja: 長鋒 chouhou), medium (ja: 中鋒 chuhou), short (ja: 短鋒　tannhou); most calligraphy is written with a medium-length hair brush. The long hair brush are more keep to hold a ink than the short hair brushes as their length. So, it used for continuous long stroke line scripting such as Japanese traditional ''hiragana'' style by ''rennmen''( ja: 連綿 ). The hair of long hair brushes are tend to made by hard texture hair to keep their hair form, but there is a not one. Japanese very long and slender hair brushes called ''menso''-burushes（ ja: 面相筆 ） are used for detail painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first =久夫　|last =堀 |title =書筆使いこなしハンドブック |date =2001-03-16 |publisher =可成屋 |edition =1 |isbn =4-8393-8721-4 |page =128}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Synthetic hair is not traditionally used. Prices vary greatly depending on the quality of the brush; cheap brushes cost less than one US dollar while expensive brushes can cost more than a thousand dollars. Currently, the finest brushes are made in the town of [[Shanlian]], in the [[Nanxun District]], [[prefecture-level city]] of [[Huzhou]], of [[Zhejiang]] province.

==History==
[[File:Pinceaux chinois.jpg|thumb|Brushes of various sizes and types of hair, including one of chicken feathers at the top]]
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
The earliest intact ink brush was found in 1954 in the tomb of a [[Chu (state)|Chu]] citizen from the [[Warring States period]] (475-221 [[Common Era|BCE]]) located in an archaeological dig site ''Zuo Gong Shan 15'' near [[Changsha]] (長沙). The primitive version of an ink brush found had a wooden stalk and a bamboo tube securing the bundle of hair to the stalk. Legend wrongly credits the invention of the ink brush to the later [[Qin dynasty|Qin]] general [[Meng Tian]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Traces of the writing brush, however, were discovered on the Shang jades, and were suggested to be the grounds of the oracle bone inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge History of Ancient China, 1999:108&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fudepen==
{{see also|Fudepen}}

The '''Fudepen''', also known as a "Brush Pen", is a modern Japanese invention analogous to a [[Fountain pen]]. Today, Japanese companies such as [[Pentel]] and [[Sakura Color Products Corporation]] manufacture pens with tips resembling those of a small ink brush. These brush pens work almost identically to small ink brushes and can be used for most of the same purposes.

'''James W. Fowler III''' (October 12, 1940 – October 16, 2015) was an American theologian who was Professor of Theology and Human Development at [[Emory University]]. He was director of both the Center for Research on Faith and Moral Development and the Center for Ethics until he retired in 2005. He was a minister in the [[United Methodist Church]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.myajc.com/news/news/local-obituaries/james-w-fowler-75-theologian-author-embodied-the-f/nn7P7/&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Evans|2010|p=196}}

==Stages of Faith==
He is best known for his book ''Stages of Faith'', published in 1981, in which he sought to develop the idea of a [[Developmental psychology|developmental]] process in "human faith". {{sfn|Evans|2010|p=196}}

These [[stages of faith development]] were along the lines of [[Jean Piaget]]'s [[theory of cognitive development]] and [[Lawrence Kohlberg]]'s [[Kohlberg's stages of moral development|stages of moral development]].{{sfn|Evans|2010|pp=196-197}}

* '''Stage 0''' – ''"Primal or Undifferentiated"'' faith (birth to 2 years), is characterized by an early learning of the safety of their environment (i.e. warm, safe and secure vs. hurt, neglect and abuse). If consistent nurture is experienced, one will develop a sense of trust and safety about the universe and the divine. Conversely, negative experiences will cause one to develop distrust with the universe and the divine. Transition to the next stage begins with integration of thought and language which facilitates the use of symbols in speech and play.
* '''Stage 1''' – ''"Intuitive-Projective"'' faith (ages of three to seven), is characterized by the psyche's unprotected exposure to the [[Unconscious mind|Unconscious]], and marked by a relative fluidity of thought patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Joann Wolski Conn (ed.), Women’s Spirituality: Resources for Christian Development. (Paulist, 1986), pp. 226-232&lt;/ref&gt; Religion is learned mainly through experiences, stories, images, and the people that one comes in contact with.
* '''Stage 2''' – ''"Mythic-Literal"'' faith (mostly in school children), stage two persons have a strong belief in the [[justice]] and reciprocity of the universe, and their [[deity|deities]] are almost always [[anthropomorphic]]. During this time metaphors and symbolic language are often misunderstood and are taken literally.
* '''Stage 3''' – ''"Synthetic-Conventional"'' faith (arising in adolescence; aged 12 to adulthood) characterized by [[conformity]] to authority and the religious development of a personal identity. Any conflicts with one's beliefs are ignored at this stage due to the fear of threat from inconsistencies.
* '''Stage 4''' – ''"Individuative-Reflective"'' faith (usually mid-twenties to late thirties) a stage of [[angst]] and struggle. The individual takes personal responsibility for his or her [[belief]]s and [[feeling]]s. As one is able to reflect on one's own beliefs, there is an openness to a new complexity of faith, but this also increases the awareness of conflicts in one's belief.
* '''Stage 5''' – ''"Conjunctive"'' faith (mid-life crisis) acknowledges paradox and [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]] relating reality behind the symbols of inherited systems. The individual resolves conflicts from previous stages by a complex understanding of a multidimensional, interdependent "truth" that cannot be explained by any particular statement.
* '''Stage 6''' – ''"Universalizing"'' faith, or what some might call "[[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]]". The individual would treat any person with compassion as he or she views people as from a universal community, and should be treated with universal principles of love and justice.

==Empirical research==
Fowler's model has inspired a considerable body of empirical research into faith development, although little of such research has been conducted by Fowler himself.  A useful tool here has been Gary Leak's Faith Development Scale, or FDS, which has been subject to [[factor analysis]] by Leak (Leak, 2008).

The '''Korea Maritime Institute''' ('''KMI''') is a think tank and research center developing [[South Korea]]n policies on marine affairs and fisheries, operated by the South Korean government through the ''Office of Government Policy Coordination''.  KMI was established under its current name in 1997, though expanded from a research center created in 1984 specializing in shipping economics.&lt;ref name=brochure&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.kmi.re.kr/download/kmi200811(eng).pdf |title=Korea Maritime Institute brochure |year=2008 |publisher=Korea Maritime Institute |accessdate=2011-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

KMI is organized into five research divisions as of 2011:
*Marine &amp; Coastal Policy Research Department
*Shipping, Port &amp; Logistics Research Department
*Fisheries Policy Research Department
*Marine Territory and Industry Research Department
*Fisheries Outlook Center

and has two overseas centers:
*Shanghai Research Center
*Korea-US Marine Policy Joint Research Center, at the [[University of Rhode Island]]

KMI is headquartered in [[Mapo-gu]], [[Seoul]],&lt;ref name=brochure /&gt; having a staff of about 180.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/special/2009/03/180_32256.html |title=Institute Offers Strategic Vision for Korean Maritime Industry |date=6 October 2008 |publisher=Korea Times |accessdate=2011-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The L2SCA is also widely utilised in the field of [[corpus linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9789401786447|title=Computational Methods for Corpus Annotation and Analysis|date=12 September 2018|publisher=[[Springer Publishing]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The L2SCA is available in a single and a batch mode. The first provides the possibility of analyzing a single written text for 14 syntactic complexity indices. The latter allows the user to analyze 30 written texts simultaneously.

==Usage==
===Second language writing development===
The L2SCA has been used in numerous studies in the field of second language writing development to compute indices of syntactic complexity. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1060374315000417|title=Diane Mazgutova &amp; Judit Kormos: Syntactic and lexical development in an intensive English for Academic Purposes programme|date=12 September 2018|publisher=[[Journal of Second Language Writing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jbe-platform.com/content/journals/10.1075/dujal.5.1.04loe|title=Junping Hou, Marjolijn Verspoor &amp; Hanneke Loerts: An exploratory study into the dynamics of Chinese L2 writing development|date=12 September 2018|publisher=Dutch Journal of Applied Linguistics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/fass/events/laelpgconference/papers/v08/Attila-M-Wind.pdf|title=Attila M.

''[[Second Life]]'' (SL) is an [[Immersion (virtual reality)|immersive]] 3D environment that can be used for entertainment and educational purposes. Due to increasing interest in digital services, some [[libraries]] have established virtual services on ''Second Life''.

== History ==
By 2007, there were more than 40 '''libraries in ''Second Life''''' and the number was increasing as of April 2011.&lt;ref name="ucd" /&gt; Many of those libraries were found in Cybrary City,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libsuccess.org/index.php?title=Cybrary_City|title=Cybrary City - Library Success: A Best Practices Wiki|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; part of the information archipelago on ''Second Life''. This place was built for libraries to set up their virtual services and for displaying their resources. Libraries can provide their services while also learning new skills for 21st-century librarianship.

==''Second Life'' libraries==

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Caledon Whitehall library 004.png|thumb|A screencap of a virtual library]] --&gt;

[[Library]] services in ''[[Second Life]]'' can be found at the following SL locations:

*Info Island 1
*Info Island 2
*Edu Island
*Caledon Library
*Healthinfo Island
*Imagination Island - Rachelville
*ALA Arts Island
*Cybrary City 1
*Cybrary City 2&lt;ref name="flying"&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenhill|first=Kathryn|title=Flying Librarians of Oz: What's all the fuss about Second Life and what's it got to do with libraries?|url=http://www.slideshare.net/sirexkat/flying-librarians-of-oz-whats-all-the-fuss-about-second-life-and-whats-it-got-to-do-with-libraries|accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Second Life'' libraries are examples of [[Virtual learning environment|immersive learning environments]]. Users can interact with the services in practical ways, such as walking around a virtual space. Libraries in ''Second Life'' often put on digital exhibitions as part of their services, for example an exhibit displaying virtual representations of [[Vincent van Gogh|Van Gogh]] paintings, including ''Starry Night''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hill|first=Valerie|author2=Lee, Hyuk-Jin |title=Libraries and immersive learning environments unite in Second Life|journal=Library Hi Tec|year=2009|volume=27|issue=3|pages=338–356|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=1811857&amp;show=abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of virtual library services is to attract new users to traditional libraries as well as establishing links with librarians from all over the world.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chappell |author2=Rachlin, Palmer |author3=Vinson, Zamarripa |title=When Real and Virtual World Collide: A Second Life Library |year=2009 |url=http://www.desktop-computing.com/capstone/Documents/WhenVirtualWorldsCollideFinal.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323051006/http://www.desktop-computing.com/capstone/Documents/WhenVirtualWorldsCollideFinal.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these services are run by volunteers.

There have been numerous initiatives to create educational spaces within ''Second Life''. There are Victorian areas in which residents dress in period clothes, an Egyptian tomb and a Renaissance Island created by the Alliance Second Life Libraries.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bell|first=L.|author2=Lindbloom, M. |author3=Peters, T. |author4=Pope, K. |title=Virtual Libraries and Education in Virtual Worlds: Twenty-first century library services|journal=Policy Futures in Education|year=2008|volume=6|issue=1|url=http://www.wwwords.co.uk/pdf/validate.asp?j=pfie&amp;vol=6&amp;issue=1&amp;year=2008&amp;article=6_Bell_PFIE_6_1_web}}&lt;/ref&gt; Central Missouri State University has also received funding to create a reproduction of 1920s Harlem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Virtual Harlem|url=http://www.evl.uic.edu/core.php?mod=4&amp;type=1&amp;indi=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Libraries can also put on virtual events such as conferences, seminars and lectures. In 2008 and 2009 Alliance Library System (ALS) organised a conference called ''Virtual Worlds: Libraries, Education and Museums Conference''. It took place in the New Media Consortium Conference Center in ''Second Life'' and was designed to "provide a gathering place for librarians, information professionals, educators, museologists, and others to learn about and discuss the educational, informational, and cultural opportunities of virtual worlds".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bell|first=Lori|title=Virtual Worlds: Libraries, Education and Museums Conference|url=http://lisnews.org/node/29040|publisher=LIS News|accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virtual libraries which are independent, run by volunteers and not affiliated with a traditional [[library]] are often the most successful ones in ''Second Life''. ''Second Life''-only virtual libraries tend to be more successful than the ''Second Life'' branches of public libraries.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Users suggest that the libraries in ''Second Life'' serve a niche population, which results in difficulties with marketing.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Staff of public libraries have different perspectives on SL when they are experimenting with it, which results in general conflict.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

In order to have a successful virtual library in ''Second Life'' there are six different elements that should be considered.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; These are:

*Location
*Timing
*Funding
*Techniques
*Organisational baggage
*Computing technology&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Examples and projects==

===Alliance Library System (ALS)===

The Alliance Library System&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alliancelibrarysystem.com/|title=Reaching Across Illinois Library System|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Illinois]] based local library co-operator, providing vital library services to citizens. It serves three sectors: libraries, legislators and communities. It is also one of the nine multitype library systems.  Multitype library systems cooperate amongst different library sectors in a community, including academic, public, school, and special libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Multicounty Multitype Library Cooperation Systems|url=http://education.state.mn.us/MDE/Learning_Support/Library_Services/Minnesota_Libraries_and_Librarians/Multitype_Library_Systems/index.html|publisher=Minnesota Department of Education|accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the Alliance Library System, the Mid-Illinois Talking Book Center, and the Illinois State Library Talking Book and Braille Service founded Online Programming for All Libraries (OPAL).&lt;ref name=opal&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome to OPAL: Online Programs for All|url=http://www.opal-online.org/|publisher=Online Programming for All Libraries (OPAL)|accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.opal-online.org/ OPAL] is an international cooperative program supported by libraries and organisations that provide web-based service and courses/trainings for library customers and staff. The administrator of OPAL is TAP Information Services. Programs include library training, special events and virtual tours of digital library collections. OPAL events mainly happen online. Those online rooms can be accessed via various ways (e.g. voice-over-IP, text chatting and synchronised browsing) by participants. In 2006, Alliance Library System and OPAL Opened an Alliance of Libraries 2.0 on ''Second Life'' together.&lt;ref name=shifted&gt;{{cite web|title=Second Library |url=http://www.theshiftedlibrarian.com/archives/2006/04/12/second_library.html |publisher=The Shifted Librarian |accessdate=25 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927182406/http://www.theshiftedlibrarian.com/archives/2006/04/12/second_library.html |archivedate=27 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 the Alliance Library System, along with other library organisations, began to investigate the possibility of establishing a library network on Second Life. By late 2006 they had purchased some land in ''Second Life'' and built a virtual library. They started holding discussion groups as well as classes for teens in the library, including courses on podcasting and film-making and an open-mic night.&lt;ref name=SLJ&gt;{{cite web|last=Barack|first=Lauren|title=Library Gets Second Life|url=http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/article/CA6338703.html|publisher=School Library Journal|accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 ALS created a virtual information archipelago called Info Island. The grand opening was on 12–14 October 2007.&lt;ref name=beth&gt;{{cite web|last=Kanter|first=Beth|title=Alliance Library System and Second Life Library/Info Island Official Opening|url=http://beth.typepad.com/beths_blog/2006/10/alliance_librar.html|publisher=Beth's Blog: How Nonprofit Organizations Can Use Social Media to Power Social Networks for Change|accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Info Island consists of numerous islands housing various libraries and institutions run by the volunteers of the [http://infoisland.org/ Community Virtual Library] as well as Academic libraries such as Stanford University Library&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wicklund|first=Deni|title=See the Stanford Libraries' Island in Second Life|url=http://speaking.stanford.edu/highlights/See_SU_Libraries_in_Second_Life.html|accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and government organisations such as the Centres for Disease Control.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

===When real and virtual worlds collide: a ''Second Life'' library===

"When Real and Virtual Worlds Collide: A Second Life Library" is a research paper carried out by Chase Baity, Pam Chappell, David Rachlin, C. Vinson and Marilyn Zamarripa. The group studied traditional public libraries, their ''Second Life'' counterparts, and independent ''Second Life'' in order to find out whether independent ''Second Life'' libraries or libraries affiliated with a Real Life library were the most successful. They used surveys, focus groups, and interviews. Over 350 users and 15 staff members participated in the study.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;
 
The research questions for the study were:

* What are the integrated goals between the real world and virtual world libraries?
* What is the optimal way to deliver services to reach these goals that are highly usable for employees and patrons?
* How usable currently is the virtual library?&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

A secondary question was looking at how other real life and ''Second Life'' libraries are similar to or different from the Olathe project.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The study found that "Second-Life-only libraries are far more popular than Second Life branches of public libraries".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; They also found that "there are no clear indications of what makes a ''Second Life'' library more or less popular than an other.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

===University College Dublin (UCD) Library in ''Second Life''===

The University College Dublin (UCD) [[UCD Library|James Joyce Library]] built up the first Irish library in Second Life.&lt;ref name="ucd"&gt;{{cite web|title=Library Joins Second Life|url=http://www.ucd.ie/news/june07/062707_second_life.html|publisher=UCD News|accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University College Dublin]] set up its library in ''Second Life'' in March 2007 as a part of ALS's Cybrary City project.&lt;ref name="jibs"&gt;{{cite web|last=McMauley |first=Cathal |title=The Library in Second Life |url=http://www.jibs.ac.uk/events/workshops/web2.0/second-life.ppt |publisher=JIBS |accessdate=30 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727010726/http://www.jibs.ac.uk/events/workshops/web2.0/second-life.ppt |archivedate=27 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This virtual library has several features and services, including user surveys, e-mail services, e-books, presentations, comment box, virtual PC, notecard giver, trampoline, dance machine and visitor counter. A work group was established for services, technology, staffing and marketing.&lt;ref name="jibs" /&gt;

===Caledon Library===

The Independent State of Caledon is an area of ''Second Life'' which is exclusively Victorian-themed.&lt;ref name=caledon&gt;{{cite web|title=Independent State of Caledon |url=http://www.steampunkwiki.com/wiki/Independent_State_of_Caledon |publisher=Steampunk Wiki |accessdate=25 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110508222218/http://www.steampunkwiki.com/wiki/Independent_State_of_Caledon |archivedate= 8 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes its own virtual library.

As well as a traditional building, Caledon Library has an outdoor reading room, the Vannevar Bush Memorial Reading Garden. Users can find a book and sit under a tree to read it.&lt;ref name=caledon2&gt;{{cite web|title=Caledon Library |url=http://infoisland.org/about/caledon/ |publisher=Community Virtual Library |accessdate=25 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724113948/http://infoisland.org/about/caledon/ |archivedate=24 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also holds book discussion groups and hosts art exhibitions.&lt;ref name="caledon2" /&gt;

Caledon Library has two main collection policies. These are 19th-century literature and materials relating to the Independent State of Caledon.&lt;ref name="caledon2" /&gt; They collect primary source material (including 19th-century novels and periodicals or materials from earlier ages considered important in the 19th century) and research materials relating to the 19th century. They are hoping to build a "listening collection" of audio books on these topics. Another project is a collection of materials created by residents of Caledon or items relating to Caledon.  Their aspiration is to eventually establish the Caledon Archives.&lt;ref name="caledon2" /&gt;

===Other examples of educational libraries in ''Second Life''===

* Many US universities in ''Second Life'' such as [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]], [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Stanford University|Stanford]] and [[Princeton University|Princeton]].
* Universities from the following countries:  UK, Australia, Denmark, France, The Netherlands etc.
* UCLA offered a graduate level course, DIS 250 "Techniques and Issues in Information Access: Information Seeking in Second Life"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/jrichardson/courses/250W08.htm|title=UCLA DIS 250 "Techniques and Issues in Information Access: IS in Second Life," Winter 2008, Dr. John V. Richardson Jr.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the Winter 2008 term.

==Impact==

Due to changes in modern lifestyle and consumer behaviours, modern customers may not visit local library buildings. This has become a worry and reason for city councils to cut libraries' budgets. Some libraries, such as ALS decided to take the organisations to their customers, transferring from real life into a [[virtual world]].&lt;ref name="SLJ" /&gt;

In recent years ''Second Life'' libraries have held discussion groups and planned events. Participant librarians say that responses have been much higher than they thought they could be. For example, in the early days of ALS establishing a virtual library in Second Life, a surprising number of Residents visited the building, with some even asking reference questions.&lt;ref name="SLJ" /&gt;

According to successful examples, more and more libraries have realised that ''Second Life'' is a new and good means to interact with their customers, helping traditional libraries to accommodate new demands and challenges.

==Issues for real life librarians==

Some "real life" librarians may find it difficult to balance their duties in their online and offline capacities. Librarians are passionate about their commitments to virtual world libraries to the extent that most librarians completed virtual library work at home and are not compensated by their libraries for this work&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blankenship|first=Emily|author2=Holingsworth, Yolanda |title=Balancing both lives: issues facing librarians working in Second Life and real life worlds|journal=New Library World|year=2009|volume=110|issue=9/10|pages=430–440|doi=10.1108/03074800910997445|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?issn=0307-4803&amp;volume=110&amp;issue=9/10&amp;articleid=1817279&amp;show=html|accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
. This could potentially cause problems with stress and fatigue.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

Librarians also indicated that adequate computing equipment and faster broadband access is important for increasing the productivity and performance of Second Life libraries, and these requirements limit the involvement of numerous librarians.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; Additional issues of computing supports include network security programs that help Second Life libraries to solve problems such as appropriate permissions, authentications, limitations of functionality based on security restrictions and service attacks.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

Additionally, there are some technology challenges. For example, the use of [[radio-frequency identification]] (RFID) – common in most libraries – has become one of the challenges for ''Second Life'' libraries. ''Second Life'' is sometimes unable to get all the information normally stored on RFID devices such as the means keeping track of library books, people or policies.&lt;ref name=sciencedaily&gt;{{cite web|title=3D Library Visit: Using Second Life To Research Everyday Problems|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/03/080330225933.htm|publisher=Science Daily|accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Some professionals have acknowledged that ''Second Life'' offers unique opportunities to expand the horizons of traditional library services.&lt;ref name="ucd" /&gt; In addition, some university librarians believe that ''Second Life'' libraries can be a valuable part of University services, becoming involved in activities such as delivering a downloading service for lecture notes.&lt;ref name="ucd" /&gt;

Some studies have found that some librarians did not pay enough attention to pre-planning their ''Second Life'' libraries, despite librarianship having a culture of planning and management.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Most ''Second Life'' librarians have no time to manage a ''Second Life'' Library during their working time because there is not any official timeline that designed by departments.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; As a result, ''Second Life'' libraries are misunderstood by many people who view ''Second Life'' libraries as just games without any educational value. Although the ''Second Life'' library is easier to navigate and provides many useful and good materials, it has few users. The reason is that the ''Second Life'' branch has not been well promoted in real life so library users do not know its existence.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9723">The following is a '''list of the presidents and executive secretaries of the [[Religious Education Association]]'''.

The [[Religious Education Association]] is a nonprofit member association, serving as a professional and learned society for scholars and researchers involved in the field of religious education.  In 2003 it merged formally with the Association of Professors and Researchers in Religious Education. Up until that date, REA presidents could serve for more than a year at a time, while APRRE presidents served for only one year at a time. At the moment of merger, presidential terms were limited to one year and "practitioners" was added to the title of the organization, making it the "Religious Education Association: An Association of Professors, Practitioners and Researchers in Religious Education" (REA: APPRRE).

'''[[Statistics]]''' is the mathematical science involving the collection, analysis and interpretation of data. A number of specialties have evolved to apply statistical and methods to various disciplines. Certain topics have "statistical" in their name but relate to manipulations of probability distributions rather than to statistical analysis.



*'''[[Actuarial science]]''' is the discipline that applies mathematical and statistical methods to assess risk in the [[insurance]] and [[finance]] industries.
*'''[[Astrostatistics]]''' is the discipline that applies statistical analysis to the understanding of astronomical data.
*'''[[Biostatistics]]''' is a branch of [[biology]] that studies biological phenomena and observations by means of statistical analysis, and includes [[medical statistics]].
*'''[[Business analytics]]''' is a rapidly developing business process that applies statistical methods to data sets (often very large) to develop new insights and understanding of business performance &amp; opportunities
*'''[[Chemometrics]]''' is the science of relating measurements made on a [[chemistry|chemical]] system or process to the state of the system via application of mathematical or statistical methods.
*'''[[Demography]]''' is the statistical study of all [[population]]s. It can be a very general science that can be applied to any kind of dynamic population, that is, one that changes over time or space.
*'''[[Econometrics]]''' is a branch of [[economics]] that applies statistical methods to the empirical study of economic theories and relationships.
*'''[[Environmental statistics]]''' is the application of statistical methods to [[environmental science]]. Weather, climate, air and water quality are included, as are studies of plant and animal populations.
*'''[[Epidemiology]]''' is the study of factors affecting the health and illness of populations, and serves as the foundation and logic of interventions made in the interest of public health and preventive medicine.
*'''[[Geostatistics]]''' is a branch of [[geography]] that deals with the analysis of data from disciplines such as [[petroleum geology]], [[hydrogeology]], [[hydrology]], [[meteorology]], [[oceanography]], [[geochemistry]], [[geography]].
*'''[[Machine learning]]''' is the subfield of [[computer science]] that formulates algorithms in order to make predictions from data.
*'''[[Operations research]]''' (or operational research) is an interdisciplinary branch of applied mathematics and formal science that uses methods such as mathematical modeling, statistics, and algorithms to arrive at optimal or near optimal solutions to complex problems.
*'''[[Population ecology]]''' is a sub-field of [[ecology]] that deals with the dynamics of species populations and how these populations interact with the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]].
*'''[[Psychometrics]]''' is the theory and technique of educational and psychological measurement of knowledge, abilities, attitudes, and personality traits.
*'''[[Quality control]]''' reviews the factors involved in manufacturing and production; it can make use of [[Sampling (statistics)|statistical sampling]] of product items to aid decisions in [[process control]] or in accepting deliveries.
*'''[[Quantitative psychology]]''' is the science of statistically explaining and changing mental processes and behaviors in humans.
*'''[[Reliability engineering]]''' is the study of the ability of a system or component to perform its required functions under stated conditions for a specified period of time
*'''[[Statistical finance]]''', an area of [[econophysics]], is an empirical attempt to shift finance from its [[Normative economics|normative]] roots to a [[positivist]] framework using exemplars from statistical physics with an emphasis on emergent or collective properties of financial markets.
*'''[[Statistical mechanics]]''' is the application of [[probability]] theory, which includes mathematical tools for dealing with large populations, to the field of [[mechanics]], which is concerned with the motion of particles or objects when subjected to a force.
*'''[[Statistical physics]]''' is one of the fundamental theories of [[physics]], and uses methods of [[probability]] theory in solving physical problems.
*'''[[Statistical signal processing]]''' utilizes the statistical properties of [[signal]]s to perform signal processing tasks.
*'''[[Statistical thermodynamics]]''' is the study of the microscopic behaviors of [[thermodynamic system]]s using probability theory and provides a molecular level interpretation of thermodynamic quantities such as [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]], [[heat]], [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]], and [[entropy]].

The Lothian Birth Cohort studies are led by [[Ian Deary]], the director of the [[CCACE|Centre for Cognitive Ageing and Cognitive Epidemiology]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]].

==Background==
The Lothian Birth Cohort (LBC) studies of 1921 (LBC1921) and 1936 (LBC1936) are follow-up studies of, respectively, the Scottish Mental Surveys (SMSs) of 1932 (SMS1932) and 1947 (SMS1947).&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2012" /&gt; The Scottish Mental Surveys, which were undertaken by the [[Scottish Council for Research in Education]] (SCRE), are the only attempts to date of any country to measure the intelligence of a complete year-of-birth in its population.&lt;ref name="CCACE, 2015"&gt;CCACE (2015).

==Design and aims==
A core aim of the LBC studies is to explore causes of different cognitive ageing outcomes.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2012" /&gt; They have also been used to facilitate a variety of psychosocial, medical and genetic investigations.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2012" /&gt;

Each wave of data collection typically includes: cognitive tests; socio-demographic information; health behaviours and health status; fitness measures; and physical measures.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2012" /&gt; Metabolic and inflammatory [[Biomarker (medicine)|biomarkers]] have also been taken in both cohorts.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2012" /&gt; The studies have been funded by a variety of sources, including but not limited to the [[Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council]], the [[Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)|Medical Research Council]], the Scottish Government's [[Chief Scientist Office (Scotland)|Chief Scientist Office]], [[Age UK]] and [[Research into Ageing]].&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2012" /&gt;

===Lothian Birth Cohort 1921===
LBC1921 participant recruitment began in 1999.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2004" /&gt; Participants were mainly recruited by tracing SMS1932 participants in the Edinburgh area using the [[National Health Service Central Register#Community Health Index|Community Health Index]] (CHI), and then asking general practitioners to contact the traced potential LBC participants.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2004" /&gt;

The LBC1921 study's main initial aim was to find molecular genetic markers of healthy cognitive ageing.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2012" /&gt; This included the investigation of the influence of the E4 [[allele]] on the [[Apolipoprotein E]] (''APOE'') gene on cognitive ageing as well as testing the effects of other [[candidate gene]]s for cognitive ageing.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2012" /&gt; A later research focus was examining relationships involving [[single-nucleotide polymorphisms]] (SNPs) from genes linked to [[oxidative stress]].&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2012" /&gt; The third and fourth waves of data collection were conducted with the main objective of testing the common cause hypothesis of cognitive ageing,&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2012" /&gt; which puts forward that age-related declines in physical and cognitive functioning share a common cause.&lt;ref name="Christensen et al., 2001"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The "common cause hypothesis" of cognitive aging: Evidence for not only a common factor but also specific associations of age with vision and grip strength in a cross-sectional analysis.|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0882-7974.16.4.588|journal = Psychology and Aging|date = 1 January 2001|volume = 16|issue = 4|doi = 10.1037/0882-7974.16.4.588|first = Helen|last = Christensen|first2 = Andrew J.|last2 = Mackinnon|first3 = Ailsa|last3 = Korten|first4 = Anthony F.|last4 = Jorm|pages=588–599}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The LBC1936 study began with the wider objective of investigating a diverse range of influences on cognitive ageing, including the effects of economic, medical, psychological and social variables.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2012" /&gt; For Wave 2, a specific focus was placed on finding how the white matter of the brain becomes damaged and what relationship white matter damage has with age-related cognitive decline.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wardlaw et al., 2011"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Brain aging, cognition in youth and old age and vascular disease in the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936: rationale, design and methodology of the imaging protocol*|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1747-4949.2011.00683.x/abstract|journal = International Journal of Stroke|date = 1 December 2011|issn = 1747-4949|pages = 547–559|volume = 6|issue = 6|doi = 10.1111/j.1747-4949.2011.00683.x|first = Joanna M.|last = Wardlaw|first2 = Mark E.|last2 = Bastin|first3 = Maria C.|last3 = Valdés Hernández|first4 = Susana Muñoz|last4 = Maniega|first5 = Natalie A.|last5 = Royle|first6 = Zoe|last6 = Morris|first7 = Jonathan D.|last7 = Clayden|first8 = Elaine M.|last8 = Sandeman|first9 = Elizabeth|last9 = Eadie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Findings==
As well as being used to research the topics of major findings outlined below, LBC data has been used in a diverse range of other investigations.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2012" /&gt; For example, LBC1921 participants served as a [[control group]] in a study that validated of the use of the [[National Adult Reading Test]] as a measure of [[Morbidity|premorbid]] cognition in individuals with [[dementia]].&lt;ref name="McGurn et al., 2004"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Pronunciation of irregular words is preserved in dementia, validating premorbid IQ estimation|url = http://www.neurology.org/content/62/7/1184|journal = Neurology|date = 13 April 2004|issn = 0028-3878|pmid = 15079021|pages = 1184–1186|volume = 62|issue = 7|doi = 10.1212/01.WNL.0000103169.80910.8B|first = B.|last = McGurn|first2 = J.

===Stability of intelligence===
[[File:Longitudinal correlations of Moray House Test scores in the Lothian Birth Cohort 1921.png|alt=In the LBC1921, age 11 Moray House Test scores correlated .66, .51 and .55 with scores at ages 79, 87 and 90 respectively.

Age 87 scores correlated .87 with age 90 scores.|thumb|Path diagram of raw correlations&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gow et al., 2011" /&gt; (displayed on the double-headed arrows) between Moray House Test scores at different ages (displayed within square boxes) in the LBC1921.]]

Studies of the LBC1921 have provided the longest-term estimates of the stability of intelligence.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2013" /&gt; They have found that intelligence in childhood is [[Effect size#Pearson r or correlation coefficient|strongly correlated]] with intelligence in old age, and that this correlation exists because intelligence is highly stable trait, rather than because childhood intelligence is linked to rates of cognitive change during adulthood.

The LBC1921 took the Moray House Test at ages 11, 79, 87 and 90, and results at all four sittings were strongly correlated. The raw correlations between test scores at age 11 and at ages 79, 87 and 90 were .66, .51 and .55 respectively, and they rose to .73, .61 and .67 respectively after correction for the restriction of [[Range (statistics)|range]] in the LBC1921 sample.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gow et al., 2011"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Stability and change in intelligence from age 11 to ages 70, 79, and 87: The Lothian Birth Cohorts of 1921 and 1936.|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0021072|journal = Psychology and Aging|date = 1 January 2011|volume = 26|issue = 1|doi = 10.1037/a0021072|first = Alan J.|last = Gow|first2 = Wendy|last2 = Johnson|first3 = Alison|last3 = Pattie|first4 = Caroline E.|last4 = Brett|first5 = Beverly|last5 = Roberts|first6 = John M.|last6 = Starr|first7 = Ian J.|last7 = Deary|pages=232–240}}&lt;/ref&gt; The range restriction-corrected correlation coefficients represent the best estimate of the stability of intelligence across the entire population of SMS1932 participants, and indicate that intelligence is a very stable trait.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2013" /&gt; Even the corrected coefficients may underestimate the strength of the correlation, as the [[Test-retest reliability|reliability]] of the test is likely below 1.0.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2004" /&gt;

Although age 11 intelligence is related to old age intelligence, it has been reported to be unrelated to change in intelligence between ages 79 and 87 in the LBC1921.&lt;ref name="Gow et al., 2011" /&gt; This finding suggested that childhood intelligence is related to old age intelligence because of the stability of intelligence rather than because it protects against decline in old age.&lt;ref name="Gow et al., 2011" /&gt;
 
The LBC1936 also re-sat the Moray House Test in old age. In this larger cohort, there was a strong correlation between scores at ages 11 and 70 of .67.&lt;ref name="Gow et al., 2011" /&gt;

===Genetic associations===
[[File:PBB Protein APOE.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Apolipoprotein E.|Apolipoprotein E.]]

The most consistent genetic finding from the LBC studies has been that the E4 allele on the ''APOE'' gene, which had previously been known to be a risk factor for late-onset [[Alzheimer's disease]],&lt;ref name="Corder et al., 1993"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Gene dose of apolipoprotein E type 4 allele and the risk of Alzheimer's disease in late onset families|url = http://www.sciencemag.org/content/261/5123/921|journal = Science|date = 13 August 1993|issn = 0036-8075|pmid = 8346443|pages = 921–923|volume = 261|issue = 5123|doi = 10.1126/science.8346443|first = E.

D.|last7 = Roses|first8 = J. L.|last8 = Haines|first9 = M. A.|last9 = Pericak-Vance}}&lt;/ref&gt; is also adversely linked to non-pathological cognitive function and change.

In an early LBC1921 study, E4 allele status was unrelated to Moray House Test scores at age 11, but at age 80 those with an E4 allele scored lower than those without an E4 allele, indicating that the allele is a risk factor for cognitive decline.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2002" /&gt; Later LBC1921 research found that possession of the E4 allele was associated with greater decline in abstract reasoning and verbal memory, but not verbal fluency, between age 79 and age 87.&lt;ref name="Schiepers et al., 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Schiepers O.

[[Genome-wide association study|Genome-wide association (GWA) studies]] have confirmed the ''APOE'' E4 allele's association with worse cognitive decline and function. A GWA study of longitudinal cohorts, including the LBC1921 and the LBC1936, found that the ''APOE'' E4 allele was associated with deleterious cognitive change.&lt;ref name="Davies et al., 2014"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Davies G. |author2=Harris S.

===White matter integrity===

[[File:3DSlicer-KubickiJPR2007-fig6.jpg|thumb|right|alt=The structure of the white matter of the human brain.|The structure of the white matter of the human brain.]]

Structural [[magnetic resonance imaging]] brain scans from LBC1936 participants have been used to observe that the integrity of white matter tracts in the brain is linked to cognitive functioning and successful cognitive ageing. In one study, three general [[Factor analysis|factors]] of white matter tract integrity combined to explain 10% of the variance in general intelligence, and this effect was fully [[Mediation (statistics)|mediated]] through processing speed.&lt;ref name="Penke et al., 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Penke L. |author2=Maniega S. M. |author3=Bastin M. E. |author4=Hernandez M. V. |author5=Murray C. |author6=Royle N. A. |author7=Deary I.

E. |author3=Penke L. |author4=Maniega S. M. |author5=Murray C. |author6=Royle N. A. |author7=Deary I.

White matter integrity has also been shown to relate to cognitive change. Specifically, white matter integrity in the [[splenium]] of the corpus callosum has been found to be a marker of healthy cognitive ageing.&lt;ref name="Penke et al., 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Penke L. |author2=Maniega S. M. |author3=Houlihan L. M. |author4=Murray C. |author5=Gow A. J. |author6=Clayden J. D. |author7=Deary I.

Additionally, white matter integrity in some brain areas has been found to be weaker in ''APOE'' E4 allele carriers,&lt;ref name="Lyall et al., 2014"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lyall D.

===Health, health behaviours and cognitive ageing===

In the LBC1921, smoking was linked to greater cognitive decline at age 80.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Deary I. J. |author2=Pattie A. |author3=Taylor M.

Physical fitness, indexed by a general [[Principal component analysis|component]] extracted from measures of lung function, grip strength and walk time, was associated with successful cognitive ageing at age 79 in the LBC1921.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Deary I.

One of the strengths of the LBC study designs is that they enable tests of [[reverse causation]] in associations between intelligence and other variables. Reverse causation is implied if a contemporaneous association in old age is attenuated or eliminated after childhood intelligence is controlled for, which would suggest that the association existed partially or wholly due to the effects of earlier intelligence.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4040">'''''Many Voices One World''''', also known as the '''MacBride report''', was a 1980 [[UNESCO]] publication written by the '''International Commission for the Study of Communication Problems''', chaired by [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] [[Nobel laureate]] [[Seán MacBride]]. Its aim was to analyze communication problems in modern societies, particularly relating to mass media and news, consider the emergence of new technologies, and to suggest a kind of communication order ([[New World Information and Communication Order]]) to diminish these problems to further peace and human development. 

Among the problems the report identified were concentration of the media, commercialization of the media, and unequal access to information and communication. The commission called for democratization of communication and strengthening of national media to avoid dependence on external sources, among others. Subsequently, Internet-based technologies considered in the work of the Commission, served as a means for furthering MacBride's visions.

While the report had strong international support, it was condemned by the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]] as an attack on the freedom of the press, and both countries withdrew from UNESCO in protest in 1984 and 1985, respectively (and later rejoined in 2003 and 1997, respectively).

==The MacBride Commission==
The '''International Commission for the Study of Communication Problems''' was set up in 1977 by the director of UNESCO [[Ahmadou-Mahtar M’Bow]], under suggestion by the USA delegation. It was agreed that the commission would be chaired by Seán MacBride from Ireland and representatives from 15 other countries, invited  due to their roles in national and international communication activities and picked among media activists, journalists, scholars, and media executives.

The members of the MacBride Commission were:
* [[Elie Abel]] (USA)
* [[Hubert Beuve-Méry]] (France)
* [[Elebe Ma Ekonzo]] (Zaire)
* [[Gabriel García Márquez]] (Colombia)
* [[Sergei Losev (scientist)|Sergei Losev]] (Soviet Union)
* [[Mochtar Lubis]] (Indonesia)
* [[Mustapha Masmoudi]] (Tunisia)
* [[Michio Nagai]] (Japan)
* [[Fred Isaac Akporuaro Omu]] (Nigeria)
* [[Bogdan Osolnik]] (Yugoslavia)
* [[Gamal El Oteifi]] (Egypt)
* [[Jan Pronk|Johannes Pieter Pronk]] (Netherlands)
* [[Juan Somavía]] (Chile)
* [[Boobli George Verghese]] (India)
* [[Betty Zimmerman]] (Canada), in substitution of [[Marshal McLuhan]], then ill

The commission presented a preliminary report in October 1978 at the 20th General Conference of UNESCO in [[Paris]].  The Commission's seminal session on new technologies to address the identified problems, was hosted by India at [[New Delhi in March 1979]]. The final report was delivered to M’Bow in April 1980 and was approved by consensus in the 21st General Conference of UNESCO in [[Belgrade]]. The commission dissolved after presenting the report.

Because of controversy surrounding the report and the withdrawal of support by the UNESCO leadership in the 1980s for its ideas, the book went out of print and was difficult to obtain. A book on the history of the United States and UNESCO was even threatened with legal action and forced to include a disclaimer that UNESCO was in no way involved with it. The MacBride report was eventually reprinted by Rowman and Littlefield in the US, and is also freely available online.

'''Massing''' is a term in [[architecture]] which refers to the perception of the general [[Shape and form (visual arts)|shape and form]] as well as size of a building.&lt;ref name=jacoby52&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacoby|first=Sam|title=Drawing Architecture and the Urban|location=Chichester, West Sussex|publisher=Wiley|date=2016|isbn=9781118879405|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zgh0CgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Born|first=George Walter|title=Preserving Paradise: The Architectural Heritage and History of the Florida Keys|location=Charleston, S.C.|publisher=History Press|date=2006|isbn=9781596291522|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ifw1LxfSSGwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Massing in architectural theory==
Massing refers to the structure in three dimensions (form), not just its outline from a single perspective (shape).&lt;ref name=jacoby52 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Arthur|title=Architectural Design Procedures|location=New York|publisher=Routledge|date=1999|isbn=9780415502849|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ttErBgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Massing influences the sense of space which the building encloses, and helps to define both the interior space and the exterior shape of the building.&lt;ref name=jacoby52 /&gt; The creation of massing, and changes to it, may be additive (accumulating or repeating masses) or subtractive (creating spaces or voids in a mass by removing parts of it).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dietsch|first=Deborah K.|title=Architecture for Dummies|location=New York|publisher=Hungry Minds|date=2002|isbn=9780764553967|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h_SXC6RER-0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|pages=30-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Massing can also be significantly altered by the materials used for the building's exterior, as transparent or layered materials are perceived differently.&lt;ref name=jacoby52 /&gt;

It is widely accepted that architectural design begins by studying massing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leyton|first=Michael|title=A generative theory of shape|location=Berlin|publisher=Heidelberg Springer|date=2001|isbn=9783540454885|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-8hrCQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=366}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a distance, massing, more than any architectural detail, is what creates the most impact on the eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Charleson|first=Andrew|title=Structure As Architecture: A Source Book for Architects and Structural Engineers|location=New York|publisher=Routledge|date=2015|isbn=9780415644594|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ROkABAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Architectural details or ornaments serve to reinforce massing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Glassie|first=Henry H.|title=Vernacular Architecture|location=Philadelphia, Pa.|publisher=Material Culture|date=2000|isbn=9780253213952|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6PgXZOVUVoIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because it has a direct relation to the visual impact a building makes, massing is one of the most important architectural design considerations.&lt;ref name=jacoby52 /&gt;

The '''Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics''' is a [[Max Planck Institute]], located in [[Garching bei München|Garching]], near [[Munich]], [[Germany]].
In 1991 the '''Max Planck Institute for Physics and Astrophysics''' split up into the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics, the [[Max Planck Institute for Physics]] and the [[Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics]]. The Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics was founded as sub-institute in 1963. The
scientific activities of the institute are mostly devoted to astrophysics with telescopes orbiting in space. A large amount of the resources
are spent for studying black holes in the galaxy and in the remote universe.

== History ==

The Max-Planck-Institute for extraterrestrial physics (MPE) was preceded by the department for extraterrestrial physics in the Max-Planck-Institute for physics and astrophysics. This department was established by Professor Reimar Lüst on October 23, 1961. A Max-Planck Senate resolution transformed this department into a sub-institute of the Max-Planck-Institute for Physics and Astrophysics on May 15, 1963. Professor Lüst was appointed director of the Institute. Another Senate resolution on March 8, 1991 finally established MPE as an autonomous institute within the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft. It is dedicated to the experimental and theoretical exploration of the space outside of earth as well as astrophysical phenomena.&lt;ref name="MPE: History"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the MPE|url=http://www.mpe.mpg.de/history.html#2|accessdate=13 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916070822/http://www.mpe.mpg.de/history.html#2|archivedate=16 September 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Detailed history ===
The Max-Planck-Institut für extraterrestrische Physik (MPE) was preceded by the department for extraterrestrial Physics in the Max-Planck-Institut für Physik und Astrophysik. This department was established by Professor Reimar Lüst on October 23, 1961. A Max-Planck Senate resolution transformed this department into a sub-institute of the Max-Planck-Institut für Physik und Astrophysik on May 15, 1963. Professor Lüst was appointed Director of the Institute. Another Senate resolution on March 8, 1991 finally established MPE as an autonomous institute within the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft. It is dedicated to the experimental and theoretical exploration of the space outside of earth as well as astrophysical phenomena. A continuous reorientation to new, promising fields of research and the appointment of new members ensures steady advancement.

Among the 29 employees of the Institute when it was founded in 1963 were 9 scientists and 1 Ph.D. student. Twelve years later in 1975 the number of employees had grown to 180 with 55 scientists and 13 Ph.D. students, and today (status 2015) there are some 400 staff (130 scientists and 75 PhD students). It is noteworthy that permanent positions at the institute have not increased since 1973 - despite its celebrated scientific achievements. The increasingly complex tasks and international obligations have been mainly maintained by staff members with positions having limited duration and funded by external organizations.

Because the Institute has assumed a leading position in astronomy internationally, it has attracted guest scientists throughout the world. The number of long-term guests increased from 12 in 1974 to a maximum of 72 in 2000. In recent years MPE has hosted an average of about 50 guest scientists each year.

During the early years, the scientific work at the Institute concentrated on the investigation of extraterrestrial plasmas and the magnetosphere of the earth. This work was performed with measurements of particles and electromagnetic fields as well as a specially developed ion-cloud technique using sounding rockets.

Another field of research also became important: astrophysical observations of electromagnetic radiation which could not be observed from the surface of the earth because the wavelengths are such that the radiation is absorbed by the earth's atmosphere. These observations and inferences therefrom are the subject matter of infra-red astronomy as well as X-ray- and gamma-ray-astronomy. In addition to more than 100 rockets, an increasing number of high-altitude balloons (up to now more than 50; e.g.  HEXE) have been used to carry experiments to high altitudes.

Since the 1990s, satellites have become the preferred observation platforms because of their favorable observation-time/cost ratio. Nevertheless, high-flying observation airplanes and ground-based telescopes are also used to obtain data, especially for optical and near-infrared observations.

New observation techniques using satellites has necessitated the recording, processing and accessible storage of high data fluxes over long periods of time. This demanding task is performed by a data processing group, which has grown quickly in the last decade. Special data centers were established for the large satellite projects.

Besides the many successes, there have also been disappointments. The malfunctioning of the Ariane carrier rockets on test launches in 1980 and 1996 were particularly bitter setbacks. The satellite  "Firewheel", in which many members of the Institute had invested years of work, was lost on May 23, 1980 because of a burning instability in the first stage of the launch rocket. The same fate was to overtake the four satellites of the CLUSTER-Mission on June 4, 1996 when the first Ariane 5 was launched. This time the disaster was attributed to an error in the rocket's software. The most recent loss was "ABRIXAS", an X-ray satellite built by industry under the leadership of MPE. After few hours in orbit, a malfunction of the power system caused the total loss of the satellite.

Over the years, however, the history of MPE is primarily a story of scientific successes.&lt;!-- http://www.mpe.mpg.de/576082/overview

== Scientific work ==
[[File:MICADO agreement signed.jpg|thumb|Agreement Signed for [[MICADO]] Camera for [[E-ELT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Agreement Signed for MICADO Camera for E-ELT|url=http://www.eso.org/public/announcements/ann15068/|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The institute was founded in 1963 as a sub-institute of the Max-Planck-Institut für Physik und Astrophysik and established as an independent institute in 1991.
Its main research topics are astronomical observations in spectral regions which are only accessible from space because of the absorbing effects of the Earth's atmosphere, but also instruments on ground-based observatories are used whenever possible.
Scientific work is done in four major research areas that are supervised by one of the directors, respectively: optical and interpretative astronomy (Bender), infrared and sub-millimeter/millimeter astronomy (Genzel), high-energy astrophysics (Nandra), and in the Centre for Astrochemical Studies (Caselli). Within these areas scientists lead individual experiments and research projects organised in about 25 project teams. The research topics pursued at MPE range from the physics of cosmic plasmas and of stars to the physics and chemistry of interstellar matter, from star formation and nucleosynthesis to extragalactic astrophysics and cosmology.

Many experiments of the Max-Planck-Institut für extraterrestrische Physik (MPE) have to be carried out above the dense Earth's atmosphere using aircraft, rockets, satellites and space probes. In the early days experiments were also flown on balloons. To run advanced extraterrestrial physics and state-of-the-art experimental astrophysics, the institute continues to develop high-tech instrumentation in-house. This includes detectors, spectrometers, and cameras as well as telescopes and complete payloads (e.g. [[ROSAT]] and [[eROSITA]]) and even entire satellites (as in case of AMPTE and EQUATOR-S). For this purpose the technical and engineering departments are of particular importance for the institute's research work.

Observers and experimenters perform their research work at the institute in close contact with each other. Their interaction while interpreting observations and propounding new hypotheses underlies the successful progress of the institute's research projects.

At the end of the year 2009 a total of 487 employees were working at the institute, numbering among them 75 scientist, 95 junior scientists (45 IMPRS PhD students included), 97 externally funded positions and 64 visiting scientists and interns.

The MPE is also active in scientific and vocational training. At the end of 2009 6 students were working on their diploma thesis and 9 apprentices worked in the administration (1) and the institute's workshop (8).&lt;ref name="MPE: Sc.Work"&gt;{{cite web|title=Scientific Work at the MPE|url=http://www.mpe.mpg.de/profile.html#8|accessdate=13 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618214732/http://www.mpe.mpg.de/profile.html#8|archivedate=18 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Projects ==

Scientific projects at the MPE are often the efforts of the different research departments to build, maintain, and use experiments and facilities which are needed by the many different scientific research interest at the institute. Apart from hardware projects, there are also projects that use archival data and are not necessarily connected to a new instrument.

The '''mind''' is a set of [[cognition|cognitive]] faculties including [[consciousness]], [[perception]], [[thought|thinking]], [[judgement]], [[language]] and [[memory]]. It is usually defined as the faculty of an entity's thoughts and consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/mind|title=mind – definition of mind in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2017-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It holds the power of imagination, recognition, and appreciation, and is responsible for processing feelings and emotions, resulting in attitudes and actions.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

There is a lengthy tradition in [[philosophy of mind|philosophy]], [[religion]], [[psychology]], and [[cognitive science]] about what constitutes a mind and what are its distinguishing properties.

One open question regarding the nature of the mind is the [[mind–body problem]], which investigates the relation of the mind to the physical [[brain]] and nervous system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Older viewpoints included [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] and [[idealism]], which considered the mind somehow non-physical.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mindware|last=Clark|first=Andy|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-19-982815-9|location=198 Madison Avenue, New York, 10016|pages=14, 254–256|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern views often center around [[physicalism]] and [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]], which hold that the mind is roughly identical with the brain or [[Reductionism|reducible]] to physical phenomena such as [[neuron|neuronal activity]]&lt;ref&gt;Smart, J.J.C., "The Mind/Brain Identity Theory", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2011 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2011/entries/mind-identity/]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=December 2016}}, though dualism and idealism continue to have many supporters. Another question concerns which types of [[being]]s are capable of having minds (New Scientist 8 September 2018 p10).{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} For example, whether mind is exclusive to humans, possessed also by some or all [[animals]], by all [[life|living things]], whether it is a strictly definable characteristic at all, or whether mind can also be a property of some types of [[artificial intelligence|human-made machines]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Whatever its nature, it is generally agreed that mind is that which enables a being to have [[subjectivity|subjective]] [[awareness]] and [[intentionality]] towards their environment, to [[perceive]] and respond to [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]] with some kind of [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]], and to have consciousness, including thinking and [[feeling]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The concept of mind is understood in many different ways by many different cultural and religious traditions. Some see mind as a property exclusive to humans whereas others ascribe properties of mind to non-living entities (e.g. [[panpsychism]] and [[animism]]), to animals and to [[deity|deities]]. Some of the earliest recorded speculations linked mind (sometimes described as identical with [[soul]] or [[spirit]]) to theories concerning both [[life after death]], and [[cosmology|cosmological]] and [[Nature (philosophy)|natural]] order, for example in the doctrines of [[Zoroaster]], [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]], Plato, [[Aristotle]], and other ancient [[Greek philosophy|Greek]], [[Indian philosophy|Indian]] and, later, [[Islamic psychological thought|Islamic]] and medieval European philosophers.

Important philosophers of mind include [[Plato]], [[Patanjali]], [[René Descartes|Descartes]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], [[John Locke|Locke]], [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]], [[David Hume|Hume]], [[Kant]], [[Hegel]], [[Schopenhauer]], [[John Searle|Searle]], [[Daniel Dennett|Dennett]], [[Jerry Fodor|Fodor]], [[Thomas Nagel|Nagel]], and [[David Chalmers|Chalmers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2016/01/20-most-important-philosophers-of-mind-since-wwii.html | title=20 "Most Important" Philosophers of Mind since WWII}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists such as [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] and [[William James|James]], and [[computer science|computer scientists]] such as [[Alan Turing|Turing]] and [[Hilary Putnam|Putnam]] developed influential theories about the nature of the mind. The possibility of nonbiological minds is explored in the field of [[artificial intelligence]], which works closely in relation with [[cybernetics]] and [[information theory]] to understand the ways in which information processing by nonbiological machines is comparable or different to mental phenomena in the human mind.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The mind is also portrayed as the [[Stream of consciousness (psychology)|stream of consciousness]] where sense impressions and mental phenomena are constantly changing&lt;ref name=Karunamuni2017&gt;{{cite journal |author= Karunamuni N, Weerasekera R. |title= Theoretical Foundations to Guide Mindfulness Meditation: A Path to Wisdom |journal= Current Psychology |date=Jun 2017 | doi= 10.1007/s12144-017-9631-7|url= http://mindrxiv.org/mfs63/ |type= Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Aggregates&gt;{{cite journal|author= Karunamuni N.D.|title=The Five-Aggregate Model of the Mind|journal=SAGE Open|volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=215824401558386|date=May 2015 | url= http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/spsgo/5/2/2158244015583860.full.pdf | doi=10.1177/2158244015583860}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The original meaning of [[Old English]] ''[[:wikt:gemynd|gemynd]]'' was the faculty of [[memory]], not of thought in general.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} Hence ''call to mind'', ''come to mind'', ''keep in mind'', ''to have mind of'', etc. The word retains this sense in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/mind|title=mind – definition of mind in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2017-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Old English]] had other words to express "mind", such as ''[[:wikt:hyge|hyge]]'' "mind, spirit".{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The meaning of "memory" is shared with [[Old Norse]], which has ''[[Muninn|munr]]''. The word is originally from a [[PIE]] verbal root ''{{PIE|*men-}}'', meaning "to think, remember", whence also Latin'' [[:wikt:mens#Latin|mens]]'' "mind", Sanskrit ''[[:wikt:मनस्|{{IAST|manas}}]]'' "mind" and Greek [[:wikt:μένος|μένος]] "mind, courage, anger".

The generalization of ''mind'' to include all mental faculties, thought, [[Volition (psychology)|volition]], feeling and memory, gradually develops over the 14th and 15th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=mind|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com|access-date=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
The attributes that make up the mind are debated. Some psychologists argue that only the "higher" intellectual functions constitute mind, particularly reason and [[memory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Başar|first1=Erol|title=Brain body mind oscillations in scope of uncertainty principle|date=2010|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-1441961365|page=5|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NAbMHo-ux58C&amp;pg=PA5&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;dq=Some+psychologists+argue+that+only+the+%22higher%22+intellectual+functions+constitute+mind,+particularly+reason+and+memory#v=onepage&amp;q=Some%20psychologists%20argue%20that%20only%20the%20%22higher%22%20intellectual%20functions%20constitute%20mind%2C%20particularly%20reason%20and%20memory&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this view the emotions — [[love]], [[hate]], [[fear]], and [[joy]] — are more ''primitive ''or subjective in nature and should be seen as different from the mind as such. Others argue that various rational and emotional states cannot be so separated, that they are of the same nature and origin, and should therefore be considered all part of it as mind.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

In popular usage, ''mind ''is frequently synonymous with ''thought'': the private conversation with ourselves that we carry on "inside our heads."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Israel|first1=Richard|last2=North|first2=Vanda|title=Mind Chi Re-wire Your Brain in 8 Minutes a Day ; Strategies for Success in Business and Life|date=2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Chichester|isbn=978-1907321375|page=12|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VCP63CWtVqIC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=mind+is+frequently+synonymous+with+thought:#v=onepage&amp;q=mind%20is%20frequently%20synonymous%20with%20thought%3A&amp;f=false|accessdate=18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus we "make up our minds," "change our minds" or are "of two minds" about something. One of the key attributes of the mind in this sense is that it is a private sphere to which no one but the owner has access. No one else can "know our mind." They can only interpret what we consciously or unconsciously communicate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Masters|first1=Frances|title=Harness your Amazingly Creative Mind|url=http://www.thefusionmodel.com/harness-amazingly-creative-mind/|website=www.thefusionmodel.com|accessdate=18 April 2015|date=2014-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mental faculties==
{{See also|Nous|Reason|Modularity of mind|Mental process}}

Broadly speaking, mental faculties are the various functions of the mind, or things the mind can "do".

[[Thought]] is a mental act that allows humans to make sense of things in the world, and to represent and interpret them in ways that are significant, or which accord with their needs, attachments, goals, commitments, plans, ends, desires, etc. Thinking involves the [[symbol]]ic or [[semiotic]] mediation of [[idea]]s or data, as when we form [[concept]]s, engage in [[problem solving]], reasoning, and making [[choice|decisions]]. Words that refer to similar concepts and processes include [[deliberation]], [[cognition]], [[idea]]tion, [[discourse]] and [[imagination]].

Thinking is sometimes described as a "higher" [[cognitive]] function and the analysis of thinking processes is a part of [[cognitive psychology]]. It is also deeply connected with our capacity to make and use [[tools]]; to understand [[causality|cause and effect]]; to recognize patterns of significance; to comprehend and [[world disclosure|disclose]] unique contexts of experience or activity; and to respond to the world in a meaningful way.

[[Memory]] is the ability to preserve, retain, and subsequently recall, knowledge, information or experience. Although memory has traditionally been a persistent theme in [[philosophy]], the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries also saw the study of memory emerge as a subject of inquiry within the paradigms of [[cognitive psychology]]. In recent decades, it has become one of the pillars of a new branch of science called [[cognitive neuroscience]], a marriage between cognitive psychology and [[neuroscience]].

[[Imagination]] is the activity of generating or evoking novel situations, [[image]]s, ideas or other [[qualia]] in the mind. It is a characteristically [[Subjectivity|subjective]] ''activity'', rather than a direct or passive experience. The term is technically used in [[psychology]] for the process of reviving in the mind [[perception|percepts]] of objects formerly given in sense perception. Since this use of the term conflicts with that of ordinary [[language]], some psychologists have preferred to describe this process as "[[wikt:Imaging|imaging]]" or "[[wikt:Imagery|imagery]]" or to speak of it as "reproductive" as opposed to "productive" or "constructive" imagination. Things imagined are said to be seen in the "[[mind's eye]]". Among the many practical functions of imagination are the ability to project possible futures (or histories), to "see" things from another's perspective, and to change the way something is perceived, including to make decisions to respond to, or enact, what is imagined.

[[Consciousness]] in mammals (this includes humans) is an aspect of the mind generally thought to comprise qualities such as [[subjectivity]], [[sentience]], and the ability to [[perception|perceive]] the relationship between [[Personal identity|oneself]] and one's [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. It is a subject of much research in [[philosophy of mind]], [[psychology]], [[neuroscience]], and [[cognitive science]]. Some philosophers divide consciousness into [[phenomena]]l consciousness, which is subjective experience itself, and access consciousness, which refers to the global availability of information to processing systems in the brain.&lt;ref name="Bl"&gt;Ned Block: "On a Confusion about a Function of Consciousness" in: ''The Behavioral and Brain Sciences'', 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Phenomenal consciousness has many different experienced qualities, often referred to as [[qualia]]. Phenomenal consciousness is usually consciousness ''of'' something or ''about'' something, a property known as [[intentionality]] in philosophy of mind.

==Mental content==
Mental contents are those items that are thought of as being "in" the mind, and capable of being formed and manipulated by mental processes and faculties. Examples include [[thought]]s, [[concept]]s, [[memories]], [[emotion]]s, [[percept]]s and [[intention]]s. Philosophical theories of mental content include [[internalism]], [[externalism]], [[direct and indirect realism|representationalism]] and [[intentionality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/content-narrow/ | title=Narrow Mental Content | publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memetics===
[[Memetics]] is a theory of mental content based on an analogy with [[Darwinian evolution]], which was originated by [[Richard Dawkins]] and [[Douglas Hofstadter]] in the 1980s. It is an [[evolutionary model]] of cultural [[information transfer]]. A [[meme]], analogous to a [[gene]], is an idea, belief, pattern of behaviour (etc.) "hosted" in one or more individual minds, and can reproduce itself from mind to mind. Thus what would otherwise be regarded as one individual influencing another to adopt a belief, is seen memetically as a meme reproducing itself.

==Relation to the brain==
{{See also|Cognitive neuroscience}}

In animals, the [[brain]], or ''encephalon'' ([[Greek (language)|Greek]] for "in the head"), is the control center of the [[central nervous system]], responsible for [[thought]]. In most animals, the brain is located in the head, protected by the [[skull]] and close to the primary sensory apparatus of [[Visual perception|vision]], [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]], [[equilibrioception]], [[taste]] and [[olfaction]]. While all [[vertebrate]]s have a brain, most [[invertebrate]]s have either a centralized brain or collections of individual [[ganglion|ganglia]]. Primitive animals such as [[sponge]]s do not have a brain at all. Brains can be extremely complex. For example, the [[human brain]] contains around 86 billion [[neuron]]s, each linked to as many as 10,000 others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Whishaw|first=Bryan Kolb, Ian Q.|title=An Introduction to Brain and Behavior|year=2010|publisher=Worth Publishers|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7167-7691-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zIBEEP2b1MIC|edition=3rd |accessdate=11 May 2012|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sherwood|first=Lauralee|title=Fundamentals of Human Physiology|year=2011|publisher=Brooks/Cole Cengage Learning|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=978-0-8400-6225-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jl4rLDuewo4C|edition=4th |accessdate=11 May 2012|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Understanding the relationship between the brain and the mind&amp;nbsp;– [[mind–body problem]] is one of the central issues in the history of [[philosophy]]&amp;nbsp;– is a challenging problem both philosophically and scientifically.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Smith Churchland, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hAeFMFW3rDUC ''Neurophilosophy: toward a unified science of the mind-brain''], MIT Press, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; There are three major philosophical schools of thought concerning the answer: dualism, materialism, and idealism. [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Dualism]] holds that the mind exists independently of the brain;&lt;ref&gt;Hart, W.D. (1997): [https://books.google.com/books?id=GFtVBGAn5-YC&amp;pg=PA265&amp;dq=dualism+%22The+mind-body+problem+is+the+question+how+the+mind+is+attached+to+the+body%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=VKuFTtvlNYSN4gTVrf20Dw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=dualism%20%22The%20mind-body%20problem%20is%20the%20question%20how%20the%20mind%20is%20attached%20to%20the%20body%22&amp;f=false ‘Dualism’, pp. 265–267] in S. Guttenplan (ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=GFtVBGAn5-YC ''A Companion to the Philosophy of Mind''], Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; [[materialism]] holds that mental phenomena are identical to neuronal phenomena;&lt;ref name="DicPhil"&gt;A.R. Lacey, ''A Dictionary of Philosophy'', 1996&lt;/ref&gt; and [[idealism (philosophy)|idealism]] holds that only mental phenomena exist.&lt;ref name="DicPhil"/&gt;

Through most of history many philosophers found it inconceivable that cognition could be implemented by a physical substance such as brain tissue (that is neurons and synapses).&lt;ref&gt;[[#refChurchland|''Neurophilosophy'']], Ch. 6&lt;/ref&gt; [[Descartes]], who thought extensively about mind-brain relationships, found it possible to explain reflexes and other simple behaviors in [[The Description of the Human Body|mechanistic terms]], although he did not believe that complex thought, and language in particular, could be explained by reference to the physical brain alone.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refDescartes|Descartes, ''Description of the human body'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most straightforward scientific evidence of a strong relationship between the physical brain [[matter]] and the mind is the impact physical alterations to the brain have on the mind, such as with [[traumatic brain injury]] and [[psychoactive drug]] use.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBoake|Boake and Diller, 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Patricia Churchland]] notes that this drug-mind interaction indicates an intimate connection between the brain and the mind.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refChurchland|''Neurophilosophy'']], Ch. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the philosophical questions, the relationship between mind and brain involves a number of scientific questions, including understanding the relationship between mental activity and brain activity, the exact mechanisms by which drugs influence [[cognition]], and the [[neural correlates of consciousness]].

Theoretical approaches to explain how mind emerges from the brain include [[connectionism]], [[computationalism]] and [[Bayesian brain]].

==Evolutionary history of the human mind==
The [[evolution of human intelligence]] refers to several theories that aim to describe how human [[intelligence]] has [[evolution|evolved]] in relation to the evolution of the [[human brain]] and the [[origin of language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harnad, S.R., Steklis, H.D., &amp; Lancaster, J.E.|title=Origins and evolution of language and speech|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|volume=280|issue=1|pages=1–2|date=1976|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1976.tb25462.x|bibcode=1976NYASA.280....1H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The timeline of [[human evolution]] spans some 7 million years, from the separation of the genus ''[[Chimpanzee|Pan]]'' until the emergence of [[behavioral modernity]] by 50,000 years ago. Of this timeline, the first 3 million years concern ''[[Sahelanthropus tchadensis|Sahelanthropus]]'', the following 2 million concern ''[[Australopithecus]]'', while the final 2 million span the history of actual ''[[Homo (genus)|Homo]]'' species (the [[Paleolithic]]).

Many traits of human intelligence, such as [[empathy]], [[theory of mind]], [[mourning]], [[ritual]], and the use of [[Great ape language|symbols]] and [[tool]]s, are already apparent in [[great ape]]s although in lesser sophistication than in humans.

There is a debate between supporters of the idea of a sudden emergence of intelligence, or "[[Behavioural modernity#Great leap forward|Great leap forward]]" and those of a gradual or [[Behavioural modernity#Continuum hypothesis|continuum hypothesis]].

Theories of the evolution of intelligence include:
* [[Robin Dunbar]]'s social brain hypothesis&lt;ref name="The Social Brain Hypothesis"&gt;[http://www.liv.ac.uk/evolpsyc/Evol_Anthrop_6.pdfThe Social Brain Hypothesis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713121559/http://www.liv.ac.uk/evolpsyc/Evol_Anthrop_6.pdfThe |date=2015-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Geoffrey Miller (psychologist)|Geoffrey Miller]]'s [[sexual selection]] hypothesis concerning [[Sexual selection in human evolution]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|authorlink=Geoffrey Miller (psychologist)|title=The Mating Mind|isbn=978-0-8058-5749-8|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ecological dominance-social competition (EDSC)&lt;ref name=flinn&gt;{{cite web| url=http://web.missouri.edu/~gearyd/Flinnetal2005.pdf|title=Flinn, M.V., Geary, D.C., &amp; Ward, C.V. (2005).

Geary and Carol V. Ward based mainly on work by [[Richard D. Alexander]].
* The idea of intelligence as a signal of good health and resistance to disease.
* The [[Group selection]] theory contends that organism characteristics that provide benefits to a group (clan, tribe, or larger population) can evolve despite individual disadvantages such as those cited above.
* The idea that intelligence is connected with nutrition, and thereby with status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0306987704000416 |title= Enhanced nutrition of offspring as a crucial factor for the evolution of intelligence on land |website= |publisher= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A higher IQ could be a signal that an individual comes from and lives in a physical and social environment where nutrition levels are high, and vice versa.

==Philosophy of mind==
{{Main|Philosophy of mind}}

Philosophy of mind is the branch of [[philosophy]] that studies the nature of the mind, [[mental event]]s, [[mental function]]s, [[mental property|mental properties]], [[consciousness]] and their relationship to the physical body. The ''[[mind–body problem]]'', i.e. the relationship of the mind to the body, is commonly seen as the central issue in philosophy of mind, although there are other issues concerning the nature of the mind that do not involve its relation to the physical body.&lt;ref name="Kim1"&gt;{{cite book | last = Kim | first = J. | editor = Honderich, Ted | title = Problems in the Philosophy of Mind.

''[[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Dualism]]'' and ''[[monism]]'' are the two major schools of thought that attempt to resolve the mind–body problem. Dualism is the position that mind and body are in some way separate from each other. It can be traced back to [[Plato]],&lt;ref name="Plato"&gt;{{cite book  | author = Plato |editor1=E.A.

The 20th century philosopher Martin Heidegger suggested that subjective experience and activity (i.e. the "mind") cannot be made sense of in terms of [[Descartes|Cartesian]] "substances" that bear "properties" at all (whether the mind itself is thought of as a distinct, separate kind of substance or not). This is because the nature of subjective, ''qualitative'' experience is incoherent in terms of&amp;nbsp;– or semantically [[Commensurability (philosophy of science)|incommensurable]] with the concept of&amp;nbsp;– substances that bear properties. This is a fundamentally [[ontology|ontological]] argument.&lt;ref&gt;Hubert Dreyfus, "Critique of Descartes I" (recorded lecture), University of California at Berkeley, September 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher of [[cognitive science]] [[Daniel Dennett]], for example, argues there is no such thing as a narrative center called the "mind", but that instead there is simply a collection of sensory inputs and outputs: different kinds of "software" running in parallel.&lt;ref name=Dennett1991&gt;{{cite book |author=Dennett, Daniel |title=Consciousness Explained |year=1991 |publisher=Little Brown |location=Boston, Massachusetts |isbn=978-0-316-18065-8|title-link=Consciousness Explained }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--find page # or page range for this citation--&gt; Psychologist [[B.F.

Philosopher [[David Chalmers]] has argued that the third person approach to uncovering mind and consciousness is not effective, such as looking into other's brains or observing human conduct, but that a first person approach is necessary.   Such a first person perspective indicates that the mind must be conceptualized as something distinct from the brain.

The mind has also been described as manifesting from moment to moment, one thought moment at a time as a fast flowing stream, where sense impressions and mental phenomena are constantly changing.&lt;ref name="Aggregates"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Karunamuni2017"/&gt;

===Mind/body perspectives===
''Monism'' is the position that mind and body are not [[physiology|physiologically]] and ontologically distinct kinds of entities. This view was first advocated in [[Western Philosophy]] by [[Parmenides]] in the 5th Century BC and was later espoused by the 17th Century [[Rationalism|rationalist]] [[Baruch Spinoza]].&lt;ref name="Spin"&gt;Spinoza, Baruch (1670) ''Tractatus Theologico-Politicus'' (A Theologico-Political Treatise).&lt;/ref&gt; According to Spinoza's [[dual-aspect theory]], mind and body are two aspects of an underlying reality which he variously described as "Nature" or "God".
* ''[[Physicalism|Physicalists]]'' argue that only the entities postulated by physical theory exist, and that the mind will eventually be explained in terms of these entities as physical theory continues to evolve.
* ''[[idealism (philosophy)|Idealists]]'' maintain that the mind is all that exists and that the external world is either mental itself, or an illusion created by the mind.
* ''[[neutral monism|Neutral monists]]'' adhere to the position that perceived things in the world can be regarded as either physical or mental depending on whether one is interested in their relationship to other things in the world or their relationship to the perceiver. For example, a red spot on a wall is physical in its dependence on the wall and the pigment of which it is made, but it is mental in so far as its perceived redness depends on the workings of the visual system. Unlike dual-aspect theory, neutral monism does not posit a more fundamental substance of which mind and body are aspects.

The most common monisms in the 20th and 21st centuries have all been variations of physicalism; these positions include [[behaviorism]], the [[type physicalism|type identity theory]], [[anomalous monism]] and [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]].&lt;ref name="Kim"&gt;Kim, J., "Mind-Body Problem", ''Oxford Companion to Philosophy''. Ted Honderich (ed.). Oxford:Oxford University Press. 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many modern philosophers of mind adopt either a ''reductive'' or ''non-reductive physicalist'' position, maintaining in their different ways that the mind is not something separate from the body.&lt;ref name="Kim" /&gt; These approaches have been particularly influential in the sciences, e.g. in the fields of [[sociobiology]], [[computer science]], [[evolutionary psychology]] and the various [[neuroscience]]s.&lt;ref name="PsyBio"&gt;Pinel, J.

''The Selfish Gene'' (1976) Oxford:Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!----Well, you get f** idea. There are billions of refs for this---&gt; Other philosophers, however, adopt a non-physicalist position which challenges the notion that the mind is a purely physical construct.&lt;!--eg, Chalmers ref and whatever else you like----&gt;
* ''Reductive physicalists'' assert that all mental states and properties will eventually be explained by scientific accounts of physiological processes and states.&lt;ref name="Pat"&gt;{{cite book | author=Churchland, Patricia | title=Neurophilosophy: Toward a Unified Science of the Mind-Brain | publisher=MIT Press | year=1986 | isbn=978-0-262-03116-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Paul"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Churchland, Paul | title=Eliminative Materialism and the Propositional Attitudes | journal=[[Journal of Philosophy]] | year=1981 | pages=67–90 | volume = 78 | doi = 10.2307/2025900 | issue=2 | jstor=2025900}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smart"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Smart, J.J.C. | title=Sensations and Brain Processes | journal=Philosophical Review | year=1956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continued progress in [[neuroscience]] has helped to clarify many of these issues, and its findings have been taken by many to support [[Physicalism|physicalists]]' assertions.&lt;ref name="Murphy"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Farah|first=Martha J.|author2=Murphy, Nancey|title=Neuroscience and the Soul|journal=Science|date=February 2009|volume=323|issue=5918|page=1168|doi=10.1126/science.323.5918.1168a|pmid=19251609|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/323/5918/1168.1.full|accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Koch"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koch|first=Christof|title=Do Not Underestimate Science|journal=Science|date=July 2009|volume=325|issue=5939|page=392|doi=10.1126/science.325_392b|pmid=19628839|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/325/5939/392.2.full|accessdate=14 November 2012|bibcode=2009Sci...325..392K}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, our knowledge is incomplete, and modern philosophers of mind continue to discuss how subjective [[qualia]] and the [[intentional stance|intentional]] mental states can be [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturally]] explained.&lt;ref name="Int"&gt;{{cite book | author=Dennett, Daniel | title=The intentional stance | publisher=MIT Press | location=Cambridge, Mass. |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-262-54053-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Searleint"&gt;{{cite book | author=Searle, John | title=Intentionality.

===Neuroscience===
{{See also|Cognitive neuroscience|Thought identification}}

[[Neuroscience]] studies the [[nervous system]], the physical basis of the mind. At the systems level, neuroscientists investigate how [[biological neural networks]] form and physiologically interact to produce mental functions and content such as [[reflex]]es, [[multisensory integration]], [[motor coordination]], [[circadian rhythm]]s, [[emotion|emotional responses]], [[learning]], and [[memory]]. At a larger scale, efforts in [[computational neuroscience]] have developed large-scale models that simulate simple, functioning brains.&lt;ref name="Spaun"/&gt; As of 2012, such models include the [[thalamus]], [[basal ganglia]], [[prefrontal cortex]], [[motor cortex]], and [[occipital cortex]], and consequentially simulated brains can learn, respond to visual stimuli, coordinate motor responses, form short-term memories, and learn to respond to patterns. Currently, researchers aim to program the [[hippocampus]] and [[limbic system]], hypothetically imbuing the simulated mind with [[long-term memory]] and crude [[emotion]]s.&lt;ref name="CNRG"&gt;{{cite web|title=Computational Neuroscience Research Group|url=http://ctnsrv.uwaterloo.ca/cnrglab/|publisher=Waterloo Centre for Theoretical Neuroscience|accessdate=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, [[affective neuroscience]] studies the neural mechanisms of [[personality psychology|personality]], [[emotion]], and [[mood (psychology)|mood]] primarily through experimental tasks.

===Cognitive Science===
{{See also|Cognitive Science}}
{{expand section|date=May 2013}}

[[Cognitive science]] examines the mental functions that give rise to [[information processing]], termed [[cognition]]. These include [[perception]], [[attention]], [[working memory]], [[long-term memory]], producing and understanding [[language]], [[learning]], [[reason]]ing, [[problem solving]], and [[decision making]]. Cognitive science seeks to understand thinking "in terms of representational structures in the mind and computational procedures that operate on those structures".&lt;ref name="stanford1"&gt;Thagard, Paul, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/cognitive-science/ Cognitive Science], The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2008 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychology===
{{See also|Neuropsychology|Psyche (psychology)|label 2=Psyche|Unconscious mind}}

[[Psychology]] is the scientific study of human behavior, mental functioning, and experience. As both an [[academic]] and [[applied science|applied]] discipline, Psychology involves the [[science|scientific study]] of [[mental process]]es such as [[perception]], [[cognition]], [[emotion]], [[Personality psychology|personality]], as well as environmental influences, such as social and cultural influences, and [[interpersonal relationships]], in order to devise theories of human behavior. Psychological patterns can be understood as low cost ways of information processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Unity of Science and Economics: A New Foundation of Economic Theory|last = Chen|first = Jing|publisher = Springer|year = 2015|isbn = |location = https://www.springer.com/us/book/9781493934645}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Psychology also refers to the application of such [[knowledge]] to various spheres of [[Human behavior|human activity]], including problems of individuals' [[everyday life|daily lives]] and the treatment of [[mental health]] problems.

Psychology differs from the other [[social sciences]] (e.g. [[anthropology]], [[economics]], [[political science]], and [[sociology]]) due to its focus on [[experimentation]] at the scale of the individual, or individuals in small groups as opposed to [[group (sociology)|large groups]], [[institutions]] or [[societies]]. Historically, psychology differed from [[biology]] and [[neuroscience]] in that it was primarily concerned with mind rather than brain. Modern psychological science incorporates [[Psychophysiology|physiological]] and [[neuropsychology|neurological]] processes into its conceptions of [[perception]], [[cognition]], behaviour, and [[mental disorders]].

==Mental health==
{{Main|Mental health}}

By analogy with the health of the body, one can speak metaphorically of a state of health of the mind, or [[mental health]]. [[Merriam-Webster]] defines mental health as "A state of emotional and psychological well-being in which an individual is able to use his or her cognitive and emotional capabilities, function in society, and meet the ordinary demands of everyday life." According to the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), there is no one "official" definition of mental health. Cultural differences, subjective assessments, and competing professional theories all affect how "mental health" is defined. In general, most experts agree that "mental health" and "[[mental disorder]]" are not opposites. In other words, the absence of a recognized mental disorder is not necessarily an indicator of mental health.

One way to think about mental health is by looking at how effectively and successfully a person functions. Feeling capable and competent; being able to handle normal levels of stress, maintaining satisfying relationships, and leading an independent life; and being able to "bounce back," or recover from difficult situations, are all signs of mental health.

[[Psychotherapy]] is an [[interpersonal]], [[Interpersonal relationship|relational]] intervention used by trained psychotherapists to aid [[wikt:Client|clients]] in problems of living. This usually includes increasing individual sense of [[well-being]] and reducing subjective discomforting experience. Psychotherapists employ a range of techniques based on experiential relationship building, [[dialogue]], [[communication]] and [[behavior]] change and that are designed to improve the [[mental health]] of a client or patient, or to improve group relationships (such as in a [[family]]). Most forms of psychotherapy use only spoken [[conversation]], though some also use various other forms of communication such as the written word, [[art]], [[drama]], [[narrative]] story, or therapeutic touch. Psychotherapy occurs within a structured encounter between a trained [[therapist]] and client(s). Purposeful, theoretically based psychotherapy began in the 19th century with [[psychoanalysis]]; since then, scores of other approaches have been developed and continue to be created.

==Non-human minds==

===Animal intelligence===
[[Animal cognition]], or cognitive ethology, is the title given to a modern approach to the mental capacities of animals. It has developed out of [[comparative psychology]], but has also been strongly influenced by the approach of [[ethology]], [[behavioral ecology]], and [[evolutionary psychology]]. Much of what used to be considered under the title of "animal intelligence" is now thought of under this heading. [[Animal language acquisition]], attempting to discern or understand the degree to which animal cognition can be revealed by [[linguistics]]-related study, has been controversial among [[cognitive linguistics|cognitive linguists]].

===Artificial intelligence===
{{refimprove section|date=September 2007}}
{{Main|Philosophy of artificial intelligence}}

[[File:Forest of synthetic pyramidal dendrites grown using Cajal's laws of neuronal branching.png|thumb|[[Computer simulation]] of the branching architecture of the [[dendrite]]s of [[pyramidal neuron]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1371/image.pcbi.v06.i08 | title = PLoS Computational Biology Issue Image &amp;#124; Vol. 6(8) August 2010 | journal = PLoS Computational Biology | volume = 6 | issue = 8 | pages = ev06.ei08 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;]] In 1950 [[Alan M. Turing]] published "Computing machinery and intelligence" in ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'', in which he proposed that machines could be tested for intelligence using questions and answers. This process is now named the [[Turing Test]]. The term [[Artificial Intelligence]] (AI) was first used by [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] who considered it to mean "the science and engineering of making intelligent machines".&lt;ref&gt;What is Artificial Intelligence? by John McCarthy [http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/whatisai/whatisai.html Stanford University] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118212402/http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/whatisai/whatisai.html |date=2015-11-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also refer to [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] as exhibited by an artificial (''man-made'', ''non-natural'', ''manufactured'') entity. AI is studied in overlapping fields of [[computer science]], [[psychology]], [[neuroscience]] and [[engineering]], dealing with intelligent [[behavior]], [[learn]]ing and [[adaptation]] and usually developed using customized [[machine]]s or [[computer]]s.

Research in AI is concerned with producing machines to automate tasks requiring intelligent behavior. Examples include [[control system|control]], [[Automated planning and scheduling|planning and scheduling]], the ability to answer diagnostic and consumer questions, [[handwriting recognition|handwriting]], [[natural language]], [[speech recognition|speech]] and [[facial recognition system|facial recognition]]. As such, the study of AI has also become an engineering discipline, focused on providing solutions to real life problems, [[knowledge mining]], [[software]] applications, [[strategy games]] like [[computer chess]] and other [[video game]]s. One of the biggest limitations of AI is in the domain of actual machine comprehension. Consequentially [[natural language understanding]] and [[connectionism]] (where behavior of neural networks is investigated) are areas of active research and development.

The debate about the nature of the mind is relevant to the development of [[artificial intelligence]]. If the mind is indeed a thing separate from or higher than the functioning of the brain, then hypothetically it would be much more difficult to recreate within a machine, if it were possible at all. If, on the other hand, the mind is no more than the aggregated functions of the brain, then it will be possible to create a machine with a recognisable mind (though possibly only with computers much different from today's), by simple virtue of the fact that such a machine already exists in the form of the human brain.

==In religion==
Many religions associate spiritual qualities to the human mind. These are often tightly connected to their [[mythology]] and ideas of [[afterlife]].

The [[India]]n [[philosopher]]-sage [[Sri Aurobindo]] attempted to unite the Eastern and Western psychological traditions with his [[integral psychology (Sri Aurobindo)|integral psychology]], as have many philosophers and [[New religious movement]]s. [[Judaism]] teaches that "moach shalit al halev", the mind rules the heart. Humans can approach the Divine intellectually, through learning and behaving according to the Divine Will as enclothed in the Torah, and use that deep logical understanding to elicit and guide emotional arousal during prayer. [[Christianity]] has tended to see the mind as distinct from the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] (Greek ''[[nous]]'') and sometimes further distinguished from the [[spirit]]. [[Esotericism|Western esoteric traditions]] sometimes refer to a [[mental body]] that exists on a plane other than the physical. [[Hinduism]]'s various philosophical schools have debated whether the human [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] (Sanskrit ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]]'') is distinct from, or identical to, ''[[Brahman]]'', the [[divinity|divine]] [[reality]]. [[Taoism]] sees the human being as contiguous with natural forces, and the mind as not separate from the [[Human body|body]]. [[Confucianism]] sees the mind, like the body, as inherently perfectible.

===Buddhism===
{{See also|Buddhism and psychology|Vijñāna|Śūnyatā|Shentong|Rangtong|Yogacara}}

Buddhist teachings explain the moment-to-moment manifestation of the mind-stream.&lt;ref name="Karunamuni2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aggregates"/&gt; The components that make up the mind are known as the five aggregates (i.e., material form, feelings, perception, volition, and sensory consciousness), which arise and pass away continuously. The arising and passing of these aggregates in the present moment is described as being influenced by five causal laws: biological laws, psychological laws, physical laws, volitional laws, and universal laws.&lt;ref name="Aggregates"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Karunamuni2017"/&gt; The Buddhist practice of [[mindfulness]] involves attending to this constantly changing mind-stream.

According to [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] philosopher [[Dharmakirti]], the mind has two fundamental qualities: "clarity and cognizes". If something is not those two qualities, it cannot validly be called mind. "Clarity" refers to the fact that mind has no color, shape, size, location, weight, or any other physical characteristic, and "cognizes" that it functions to know or perceive objects.&lt;ref&gt;Gyatso, [[Geshe Kelsang Gyatso]], ''Understanding the Mind'': The Nature and Power of the Mind, [[Tharpa Publications]] (2nd. ed., 1997) {{ISBN|978-0-948006-78-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Knowing" refers to the fact that mind is aware of the contents of experience, and that, in order to exist, mind must be cognizing an object. You cannot have a mind – whose function is to cognize an object – existing without cognizing an object.

Mind, in Buddhism, is also described as being "space-like" and "illusion-like". Mind is space-like in the sense that it is not physically obstructive. It has no qualities which would prevent it from existing. In [[Mahayana]] Buddhism, mind is illusion-like in the sense that it is empty of inherent existence. This does not mean it does not exist, it means that it exists in a manner that is counter to our ordinary way of misperceiving how phenomena exist, according to Buddhism. When the mind is itself cognized properly, without misperceiving its mode of existence, it appears to exist like an illusion. There is a big difference however between being "space and illusion" and being "space-like" and "illusion-like". Mind is not composed of space, it just shares some descriptive similarities to space. Mind is not an illusion, it just shares some descriptive qualities with illusions.

Buddhism posits that there is no inherent, unchanging identity (Inherent I, Inherent Me) or phenomena (Ultimate self, inherent self, Atman, Soul, Self-essence, Jiva, Ishvara, humanness essence, etc.) which is the experiencer of our experiences and the agent of our actions. In other words, human beings consist of merely a body and a mind, and nothing extra. Within the body there is no part or set of parts which is – by itself or themselves – the person. Similarly, within the mind there is no part or set of parts which are themselves "the person". A human being merely consists of five aggregates, or ''[[skandha]]s'' and nothing else.

In the same way, "mind" is what can be validly conceptually labelled onto our mere experience of clarity and knowing. There is something separate and apart from clarity and knowing which is "Awareness", in Buddhism. "Mind" is that part of experience the sixth sense door, which can be validly referred to as mind by the concept-term "mind". There is also not "objects out there, mind in here, and experience somewhere in-between". There is a third thing called "awareness" which exists being aware of the contents of mind and what mind cognizes. There are five senses (arising of mere experience: shapes, colors, the components of smell, components of taste, components of sound, components of touch) and mind as the sixth institution; this means, expressly, that there can be a third thing called "awareness" and a third thing called "experiencer who is aware of the experience". This awareness is deeply related to "no-self" because it does not judge the experience with craving or aversion.

Clearly, the experience arises and is known by mind, but there is a third thing calls [[Sati (Buddhism)|Sati]] what is the "real experiencer of the experience" that sits apart from the experience and which can be aware of the experience in 4 levels. (Maha Sathipatthana Sutta.)
# Body
# Sensations (Changes of the body mind.)
# Mind,
# Contents of the mind. (Changes of the body mind.)

To be aware of these four levels one needs to cultivate equanimity toward Craving and Aversion. This is Called Vipassana which is different from the way of reacting with  Craving and Aversion. This is the state of being aware and equanimous to the complete experience of here and now. This is the way of Buddhism, with regards to mind and the ultimate nature of minds (and persons).

===Mortality of the mind===
{{Main|Consciousness after death}}
Due to the [[mind–body problem]], a lot of interest and debate surrounds the question of what happens to one's conscious mind as one's body dies. During [[brain death]] all [[brain activity|brain function]] permanently ceases, according to the current neuroscientific view which sees these processes as the physical basis of mental phenomena, the mind fails to survive brain death and ceases to exist. This permanent loss of consciousness after death is often called "[[eternal oblivion]]". The belief that some [[spirit]]ual or [[incorporeal]] component ([[soul]]) exists and that it is preserved after death is described by the term "[[afterlife]]".

==In pseudoscience==
===Parapsychology===
[[Parapsychology]] is a study of certain types of [[paranormal phenomena]], or of phenomena which appear to be paranormal but it does not have any scientific basis &lt;ref&gt;[http://parapsych.org/glossary_l_r.html#p Parapsychological Association website, Glossary of Key Words Frequently Used in Parapsychology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824232035/http://parapsych.org/glossary_l_r.html |date=2010-08-24 }}, Retrieved February 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; for instance [[precognition]], [[telekinesis]] and [[telepathy]].

The term is based on the Greek [[:wikt:para-|para]] (beside/beyond), [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] (soul/mind), and [[logos]] (account/explanation) and was coined by psychologist [[Max Dessoir]] in or before 1889.&lt;ref name = "EncyOccult"/&gt; [[J.B.

'''Mycenology''' is the study of the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] Greek language and the culture and institutions recorded in that language. It emerged as a discipline auxiliary to classical philology in 1953, following the deciphering of [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] [[Linear B]] script by [[Alice Kober]], [[Michael Ventris]] and [[John Chadwick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=W.

[[Image:Cupandring.JPG|thumb|&lt;center&gt;A replica of an unusual cup-and-ring-marked stone from [[Museum of Ayrshire Country Life and Costume|Dalgarven]], North Ayrshire, Scotland.]]
In the [[Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]] [[British Isles]], [[rock art]] was produced across various parts of the islands. [[Petroglyph]]ic in nature, the majority of such carvings are [[Abstraction|abstract]] in design, usually [[cup and ring mark]]s, although examples of spirals or figurative depictions of weaponry are also known. Only one form of [[rock art in Europe]], this late prehistoric tradition had connections with others along [[Atlantic Europe]], particularly in Galicia.

The study of rock art in the British Isles was largely initiated by amateur researchers rather than academic or other professional [[archaeology|archaeologists]].

Surviving examples of rock art in the British Isles are believed to represent only a small sample of that which had been produced in the Neolithic and Bronze Ages. Many examples of petroglyphs would have eroded away, thereby being lost to contemporary scholarship.{{sfn|Bradley|1997|p=5}} In other examples, images might have been painted onto rock, or marked onto less permanent surfaces, such as wood, livestock or the human body, thereby also failing to survive into the present.{{sfn|Bradley|1997|p=5}}

==Chronology==
Rock art had first appeared in Atlantic Europe by the late fourth millennium BCE.{{sfn|Bradley|1997|p=65}}
In Britain, rock art had ceased by the time of the agricultural intensification in the Late Bronze Age, the first millennium BCE.{{sfn|Bradley|1997|p=65}}

==Distribution==
===Northern Britain===
Within Britain, the majority of recorded Neolithic and Bronze Age rock art comes from the northern part of the island.{{sfn|Evans|2004|p=14}}{{sfn|Nash|2007|p=175}} Cup-and-ring marks are particularly common in this area.{{sfn|Bradley|1997|p=33}}

Cup-and-ring marks are usually attributed to the Neolithic and Early Bronze Ages,{{sfn|Beckensall|1999|p=23}} while attempts at building a relative chronology have been tried in [[Dumbartonshire]].{{sfn|Mackie|Davis|1989}}

===South West Britain===
Over 70 examples of late prehistoric rock art have been identified in the [[South West England|South West of Britain]],{{sfn|Nash|2007|p=175}} being far sparser than those found in the North.{{sfn|Beckensall|1999|p=83}} This may in part be due to the harder nature of the natural rock in the area, which is largely plutonic granite, alongside a lack of research focused in this region.{{sfn|Nash|2007|p=175}} Rock art specialist George Nash considered the petroglyphs of this region to constitute a distinct artistic tradition from that in the North.{{sfn|Nash|2007|p=175}}
The majority of petroglyphs in South West Britain are cup marks, engraved both onto the rock face and on boulders, as at the Castallack Menhir.{{sfn|Nash|2007|p=176}}

[[File:Rockyvalleycarving2.JPG|thumb|left|One of the Rocky Valley labyrinths.]]

Archaeologists are aware of three instances in South West Britain where weapons are depicted in petroglyphs: at [[Boscawen-un]] stone circle in [[Cornwall]], at [[Badbury Rings]] Barrow in [[Devon]], and at [[Stonehenge]] in [[Wiltshire]].{{sfn|Nash|2007|p=183}} Using relative dating, the weapons depicted on Boscawen-un have been tentatively dated to ''circa'' 2000 BCE, while those at Badbury Rings and Stonehenge have been dated to ''c''. 1800 BCE.{{sfn|Nash|2007|pp=183&amp;ndash;184}}

Several petroglyphic [[labyrinth]]s have also been discovered in South West Britain. The best known of these are a neighbouring pair that have been found engraved onto a [[shale]] outcrop at [[Rocky Valley]], Cornwall.{{sfn|Nash|2007|pp=186&amp;ndash;187}} Apparently incised using a metal implement, Nash suggested that the southern labyrinth had previously been engraved using a stone tool.{{sfn|Nash|2007|pp=186&amp;ndash;187}} Publicly revealed in 1948,{{sfn|Saward|2001}} it has been suggested that they are Bronze Age in date, due to similarities with Bronze Age petroglyphs in Galicia and [[Valcamonica]].{{sfn|Nash|2007|p=186}} Conversely, many rock art researchers do not consider them to be prehistoric, with Saward arguing that they were created between the 16th and 18th-centuries, when the neighbouring Trewethett Mill was operational. As evidence, she noted that labyrinths were a popular motif in folk customs at the time, and that the good state of preservation would not be present if they had prehistoric origins.{{sfn|Saward|2001}}

===Ireland===
[[File:Newgrange, Ireland.jpg|thumb|right|Engravings at the entrance to [[Newgrange]].]]
Cup-and-ring marks are particularly common in this area.{{sfn|Bradley|1997|p=33}}

Petroglyphs can be found carved onto Early Neolithic passage tombs, such as [[Newgrange]].

==Research==
Throughout the British Isles, most of the research into rock art has been undertaken by amateurs rather than professional archaeologists, to varying degrees of quality.{{sfn|Bradley|1997|p=7}}

In 1997, archaeologist [[Richard Bradley (archaeologist)|Richard Bradley]] of the [[University of Reading]] published ''[[Rock Art and the Prehistory of Atlantic Europe]]'', the first study of such petroglyphs across Atlantic Europe.{{sfn|Bradley|1997}} In 1999, Stan Beckensall published ''British Prehistoric Rock Art'', the first regional overview of the island's rock art.{{sfn|Beckensall|1999}}

==Purpose==
The purposes of Neolithic and Bronze Age petroglyphs in the British Isles have long been debated, with amateur rock art researcher Ronald Morris listing 104 different proposals that he had encountered, ranking them according to what he believed to be their plausibility.{{sfn|Bradley|1997|pp=3&amp;ndash;4}}{{sfn|Beckensall|1999|p=8}}
It has been noted that the meanings and usage of such rock art might have changed over time, as they came to be encountered by communities unaware of their original purpose.{{sfn|Bradley|1997|p=55}}

===Directional signs===
Smith and Walker suggested that British cupmarks may have acted as directional signs, being placed alongside pathways to guide those travelling along them.{{sfn|Smith|Walker|2011|p=21}}

===Entoptic phenomenon and altered states of consciousness===
One suggestion is that the motifs found in the rock art of the British Isles are depictions of [[phosphene]]s, [[entoptic phenomenon]] produced through the disturbance of the [[optic nerve]] that result from [[altered states of consciousness]].{{sfn|Bradley|1997|pp=51&amp;ndash;54}} Such altered states might have been induced by the use of [[hallucinogens|hallucinogenic drugs]], evidence for which exists from Neolithic and Bronze Age Europe.{{sfn|Bradley|1997|p=54}}

This idea was first applied to the petroglyphs on the Neolithic monuments of the British Isles by [[David Lewis-Williams]] and T. Dowson. They noted that the depiction of phosphenes could appear independently in different areas due their common basis in the human nervous system.{{sfn|Lewis-Williams|Dowson|1993|pp=61&amp;ndash;62}} Lewis-Williams and David Pearce expanded on this idea in their book ''[[Inside the Neolithic Mind]]''.
Bradley extended these ideas to suggest that the circular designs on open air petroglyphs might have represented a pathway that led into the rock.{{sfn|Bradley|1997|p=54}}

Dronfield defended the entoptic explanation by way of ethnographic comparison. Examining art produced by a society that placed great emphasis on altered states of consciousness with another that did not, he highlighted that the former contained motifs identified as phosphenes while the latter did not.{{sfn|Dronfield|1995}} Although believing that it represents "a helpful clue to the roots of Atlantic rock art", Bradley noted that even if the earliest instances of rock art were based upon entoptic phenomenon, they may have become divorced from their original inspiration as they were more copied elsewhere.{{sfn|Bradley|1997|p=54}}

===Water symbolism===
Smith and Walker also suggested that cup-and-ring marks were symbolically linked to water, having sacred associations in late prehistoric society. As evidence, they noted that a number of the larger cups, which they refer to as basins, would have collected rain water.{{sfn|Smith|Walker|2011|p=23}} They believed that cup-and-ring markings looked like the ripples produced when raindrops hit water.{{sfn|Smith|Walker|2011|p=29}}

[[Image:Old City Hall and Terauley Street.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Old City Hall (Toronto)|Old City Hall]] in Toronto in 1907.  Its proposed demolition in the 1960s contributed to increased heritage awareness in Ontario, which led to heritage protection measures such as the ''Ontario Heritage Act''.]]
The '''''Ontario Heritage Act''''', (the ''Act'') first enacted on March 5, 1975,  allows [[municipality|municipalities]] and the [[province|provincial]] government to designate individual properties and districts in the Province of [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], as being of [[cultural heritage]] value or interest.

==Designation under the Ontario Heritage Act==
Once a property has been designated under Part IV of the ''Act'', a property owner must apply to the local municipality for a permit to undertake alterations to any of the identified heritage elements of the property or to [[demolition|demolish]] any buildings or structures on the property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagetrust.on.ca/Resources-and-Learning/Ontario-Heritage-Act-Register.aspx|title=Ontario Heritage Act Register|website=Heritagetrust.on.ca|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part V of the ''Act'' allows for the designation of [[Historic district|heritage conservation districts]].

==Amendments to the legislation==
Until 2005, a designation of a property under the ''Act'' allowed a municipality to delay, but not ultimately prevent, the demolition of a heritage property.  Heritage advocates were highly critical of the 180-day "cooling off" period provided for under the legislation, which was intended to allow time for municipalities and landowners to negotiate an appropriate level of heritage preservation, but often simply resulted in the landowner "waiting out the clock" and demolishing the heritage building once the protection of the ''Ontario Heritage Act'' had expired.

In 2005, the provincial government enacted changes to strengthen the Act.  Under the amended legislation, a landowner who is refused a demolition permit under the ''Act'' no longer has an automatic right to demolish a designated building once the cooling off period has expired.  Instead, the landowner has the option to [[appeal]] the permit refusal to the [[Conservation Review Board]] for individual properties or the [[Ontario Municipal Board]] for properties within a Heritage Conservation District and the appropriate board would make the final decision on whether or not a demolition permit is issued. Where the OMB refuses to issue a permit, the landowner would have no choice but to preserve the heritage building.

The amended legislation also contains provisions which enable municipalities to enact by-laws to require owners of designated buildings to maintain the structures and their heritage elements.  Such by-laws are intended to prevent "demolition by neglect", although the collapse of [[Walnut Hall]] in Toronto demonstrates that such buildings are still at risk.

==Implementation and issues==
[[File:Edward Pease house sign.jpg|thumbnail|left|Plaque on a structure in [[Markham, Ontario|Markham]], showing that the building is protected under the Act.]]
Heritage designation is not universally welcomed. Because it imposes restrictions, or at least delay, on alteration or demolition of protected properties, some owners and would-be developers feel their property rights are compromised. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mah.gov.on.ca/Page215.aspx|title=Provincial Policy Statement|website=Mah.gov.on.ca|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockcliffepark.ca/heritage.html|title=Rockcliffe Park Residents Association|first=Carmine|last=Domenicucci|website=Rockcliffepark.ca|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. There is also concern that the restrictions will make it more difficult to sell and/or develop affected properties, with a negative impact on market values.

[[Ottawa]]: As part of the city’s heritage inventory project, the city is reviewing properties in Old Ottawa East and Old Ottawa South and placing those considered to have “cultural heritage value” on a registry. Owners will be required to give 60 days notice to the city before demolishing a listed property. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ottawasun.com/2017/07/13/landowners-dont-buy-citys-sell-job-on-heritage-registry|title=Landowners don't buy city's sell job on heritage registry|website=Ottawasun.com|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rockcliffe Park]]: The entire village, which is now part of the City of Ottawa, became a [[Heritage Conservation District]] in 2016&lt;ref&gt;City of Ottawa By-Law No. 2016 - 89&lt;/ref&gt;. The objective is not just conservation of individual buildings but of the park-like qualities of the area as a whole. This means that lot sizes, spacings between houses, and streetscapes are also protected; for example, new circular driveways are no longer permitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockcliffepark.ca/Final%202016%20-%20%20RPHCDPlan.pdf|format=PDF|title=ROCKCLIFFE PARK HERITAGE CONSERVATION DISTRICT PLAN|website=Rockcliffepark.ca|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a current appeal by a home-owner who is also a developer &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/richcraft-lobby-council-270-buchan-city-hall-access-1.4132749|title=Rockcliffe home debate feeds fears about developers' access to city hall|website=Cbc.ca|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/rockcliffe-park-residents-oppose-housing-development&lt;/ref&gt;. Pending the outcome of a September 2017 hearing before the [[Ontario Municipal Board]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omb.gov.on.ca/e-decisions/mm160031-Mar-20-2017.pdf|format=PDF|title=This is the first Pre-Hearing in the appeal before the Board relating to the passing of Heritage By-law No. 2016-89 by the City of Ottawa (the “City”), which adopted the Rockcliffe Park Heritage Conservation District Plan for the Rockcliffe Park Heritage Conservation District|website=Omb.gov.on.ca|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, City of Ottawa policy is to continue to apply the Heritage Conservation Plan.

Experience with the new provisions of the Act has been mixed.  Municipalities, who were given significantly greater authority with the amendments, have, in some cases, used the authority to prevent or delay development proposals, with questionable intent.  In one case a golf course was designated when the local Council received a proposal to develop it for housing.

Another flashpoint has been proposals to develop or significantly alter church properties. The government of Ontario has recently published a guideline that provides a context for the inherent conflict between religious beliefs and the civil authority over religious property that is enabled by the Act.  The "Guide to Conserving Heritage Places of Worship in Ontario Communities" is part of the Ontario Heritage Toolkit.  The Guide provides an understanding of how religious and heritage preservation goals can be balanced.

Properties under federal jurisdiction are also problematic; enterprises such as banking, navigation and interprovincial rail operate beyond the jurisdiction of Ontario's government. Various federal [[private member's bill]]s (''[[Heritage Railway Stations Protection Act]]'', ''[[Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act]]'') attempt to restrict demolition of historic properties, but all are narrow in scope and provide no protection against demolition by neglect.

'''OttoBib.com''' is a website with a free tool to generate an alphabetized [[bibliography]] of books from a list of [[International Standard Book Number]]s (ISBN) with output in [[MLA Style Manual|MLA]], [[APA style|APA]], [[The Chicago Manual of Style|Chicago]]/[[Turabian]], [[BibTeX]] and Wikipedia {{tl|cite book}} format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|author=Boswell, Wendy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each query also generates a "temporary" [[permalink]] (self-destructs in about one month) which can be used to recall the bibliography without reentering the ISBN data. The site is a [[metasearch engine]], integrating data from several sources, including the U.S. [[Library of Congress]] API, the [[Amazon.com]] database of books, and [[ISBNdb.com]]. OttoBib accepts ISBNs with either 10 or 13 digits.

== Background ==

OttoBib.com was started as a hobby project in 2006 by Jonathan Otto, a then 4th year undergraduate at the [[University of Wisconsin–La Crosse]], USA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neobinaries.com/apps/Category/Search%20Engines/OttoBib.aspx Web 2.0 Application Listings] -- About the company&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally called "That's Crazy Hot!" but the name was quickly changed to OttoBib because the original title was "not suitable for the academic environment and consequently won't take off."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://jonathanotto.com/2006/1/13/21/55/Thats-Crazy-Hot | title = That's Crazy Hot! | date = January 13, 2006 | author = Jonathan Otto | work = OttoBib Blog | accessdate = 2007-02-20 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061101041332/http://jonathanotto.com/2006/1/13/21/55/Thats-Crazy-Hot &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original inspiration for the site came from [[Seth Godin]]'s January 3, 2006 blog post on "Stuck Systems", where he wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A quick online search didn't turn up what seemed obvious to me: a free service that would allow a writer to type in all the ISBNs used in creating a paper and then generate two things:

# a bibliography based on looking up the data online and
# a web page that would allow the reader/teacher to see the books, their covers... etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2006/01/stuck_systems.html Stuck systems] January 3, 2006 post on [[Seth Godin]]'s Blog&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Functionality ==

OttoBib.com performs the two basic functions outlined.&lt;!--It does not seem to perform the second (it does via permalink)--&gt; Marcus P. Zillman, an Internet information retrieval consultant and speaker said "this website is the start of a new paradigm of citing sources."&lt;ref&gt;[http://zillman.blogspot.com/2006/12/ottobib-free-auto-bibliography.html Internet Happenings, Events and Sources] December 11, 2006 post by Marcus P. Zillman, accessed December 24, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jason Clarke (writer)|Jason Clarke]], a writer and web developer, said OttoBib is a "tool that solves a simple problem in a simple manner."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.downloadsquad.com/2006/09/20/ottobib-automatic-bibliographies-for-back-to-schoolers/ Downloadsquad review] posted Sep 20, 2006 by [[Jason Clarke (writer)|Jason Clarke]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Developments ==

In January 2007, OttoBib introduced a [[Representational State Transfer|REST]] interface to allow a citation to be generated from a URL that contains the ISBN.  For example, {{ISBN|0-19-511797-2}} can be used in the URL:

 http://ottobib.com/isbn/0195117972/apa

to display

 [[James T. Patterson (historian)|Patterson, J.]], (1997). ''[[Oxford History of the United States|Grand Expectations]]''. Oxford Oxfordshire: Oxford University Press.

In February 2007, OttoBib introduced the ability to request citations in [[BibTeX]] and Wikipedia {{tl|cite book}} formats.

[[File:Pastiche.jpg|thumb|A pastiche combining elements of two paintings ([[:File:Antonio Pollaiuolo 005.jpg|original 1]] and [[:File:Sandro Botticelli 068.jpg|original 2]]), using [[Photoshop]]]]

A '''pastiche''' is a work of [[visual art]], literature, theatre, or music that [[Imitation|imitates]] the style or character of the work of one or more other artists.&lt;ref name="princeton"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MJVlZjIe5o8C&amp;pg=PA1005 |page=1005 |isbn=0-691-15491-0 |editor=Roland Greene |editor2=Stephen Cushman |editor3=Clare Cavanagh |editor4=Jahan Ramazani |editor5=Paul F. Rouzer |editor6=Harris Feinsod |editor7=David Marno |editor8=Alexandra Slessarev |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[parody]], pastiche celebrates, rather than mocks, the work it imitates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hoestery |first=Ingeborg |title=Pastiche: Cultural Memory in Art, Film, Literature |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AfpcjdU5fD8C |accessdate=2 August 2013 |year=2001 |publisher=[[Indiana University Press]] |location=Bloomington |isbn=978-0-253-33880-8 |oclc=44812124 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''pastiche'' is a French [[cognate]] of the Italian noun ''[[wikt:pasticcio|pasticcio]]'', which is a [[pâté]] or pie-filling mixed from diverse ingredients.&lt;ref name="princeton" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|pastiche|accessdate=2013-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metaphorically, ''pastiche'' and ''[[pasticcio]]'' describe works that are either composed by several authors, or that incorporate stylistic elements of other artists' work. Pastiche is an example of [[eclecticism in art]].

[[Allusion]] is not pastiche. A literary allusion may refer to another work, but it does not reiterate it. Moreover, allusion requires the audience to share in the author's cultural knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=A Glossary of Literary Terms |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o9VkYJuVn9YC&amp;pg=PA12 |isbn=1-4130-3390-3 |last1=Abrams |first1=Meyer Howard |last2=Harpham |first2=Geoffrey |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both allusion and pastiche are mechanisms of [[intertextuality]].

===Literature===
{{see also|Dionysian imitatio}}
In literature usage, the term denotes a [[literary technique]] employing a generally light-hearted tongue-in-cheek imitation of another's style; although jocular, it is usually respectful.{{citation needed | date = October 2013}}

For example, many stories featuring [[Sherlock Holmes]], originally penned by [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], have been written as pastiches since the author's time.&lt;ref name="RL"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://criminalbrief.com/?p=8047|title= Pastiche Nuts|last= Lopresti|first= Rob|date= 2009-08-12|work= Tune It Or Die!|publisher= Criminal Brief|accessdate= 2010-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LL"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://criminalbrief.com/?p=125|title= When Good Characters Go Bad|last= Lundin|first= Leigh|date= 2007-07-15|work= ADD Detective|publisher= Criminal Brief|accessdate= 2010-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ellery Queen]] and [[Nero Wolfe]] are other popular subjects of mystery parodies and pastiches.&lt;ref name="DA"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://criminalbrief.com/?p=3561|title= The Pastiche|last= Andrews|first= Dale|date= 2008-10-28|work= Mystery Masterclass|publisher= Criminal Brief|accessdate= 2010-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DM"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.themysteryplace.com/forum/messages.aspx?TopicID=241|title= Pastiche vs. fan fiction.

A similar example of pastiche is the posthumous continuations of the [[Robert E. Howard]] stories, written by other writers without Howard's authorization. This includes the [[Conan the Barbarian]] stories of [[L. Sprague de Camp]] and [[Lin Carter]].
[[David Lodge (author)|David Lodge]]'s novel ''[[The British Museum Is Falling Down]]'' ([[1965 in literature|1965]]) is a pastiche of works by [[James Joyce|Joyce]], [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]], and [[Virginia Woolf]]. In 1991 [[Alexandra Ripley]] wrote the novel ''[[Scarlett (Ripley novel)|Scarlett]]'', a pastiche of ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]'', in an unsuccessful attempt to have it recognized as a [[Canon (fiction)|canonical]] sequel. 

In 2017, John Banville published Mrs. Osmond, a sequel to Henry James's The Portrait of a Lady, written in a style similar to that of James.

===Music===

[[Charles Rosen]] has characterized [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart's]] various works in imitation of [[Baroque music|Baroque]] style as pastiche, and [[Edvard Grieg]]'s ''[[Holberg Suite]]'' was written as a conscious homage to the music of an earlier age. Some of [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s works, such as his ''[[Variations on a Rococo Theme]]'' and [[Serenade for Strings (Tchaikovsky) | ''Serenade for Strings'']], employ a poised "classical" form reminiscent of 18th-century composers such as [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] (the composer whose work was his favorite).&lt;ref name="brown_ng18628"&gt;* Brown, David, "Tchaikovsky, Pyotr Ilyich." In ''The New Grove Encyclopedia of Music and Musicians'' (London: MacMillan, 1980), 20 vols., ed. Sadie, Stanley. {{ISBN|0-333-23111-2}}. 18:628&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps one of the best examples of pastiche in modern music is that of [[George Rochberg]], who used the technique in his String Quartet No. 3 of 1972 and Music for the Magic Theater. Rochberg turned to pastiche from [[serialism]] after the death of his son in 1963.

"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]" by [[Queen (band)|Queen]] is unusual as it is a pastiche in both senses of the word, as there are many distinct styles imitated in the song, all "hodge-podged" together to create one piece of music.&lt;ref name="An Invitation to the Opera"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/1995_articles/oct95/queen.html|title= AN INVITATION TO THE OPERA|last= Baker|first= Roy Thomas|date= October 1995|publisher= Sound on Sound|accessdate= 2010-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar earlier example is "[[Happiness is a Warm Gun]]" by [[The Beatles]]. One can find musical "pastiches" throughout the work of the American composer [[Frank Zappa]].

A ''pastiche Mass'' is a musical [[Mass (music)|Mass]] where the constituent movements come from different Mass settings. Most often this convention has been chosen for concert performances, particularly by [[early music | early-music]] ensembles. Masses are composed of movements: [[Kyrie]], [[Gloria in excelsis Deo|Gloria]], [[Credo]], [[Sanctus]], [[Agnus Dei (music)|Agnus Dei]]; for example, the ''[[Missa Solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa Solemnis]]'' by [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] and the ''[[Messe de Nostre Dame]]'' by [[Guillaume de Machaut]]. In a pastiche Mass, the performers may choose a Kyrie from one composer, and a Gloria from another; or choose a Kyrie from one setting of an individual composer, and a Gloria from another.

===Musical theatre===

In musical theatre pastiche is often an indispensable tool for evoking the sounds of a particular era for which a show is set. For the 1971 musical ''[[Follies]]'', a show about a reunion of performers from a musical [[revue]] set between the World Wars, [[Stephen Sondheim]] wrote over a dozen songs in the style of Broadway songwriters of the 1920s and 1930s. Sondheim imitates not only the music of composers such as [[Cole Porter]], [[Irving Berlin]], [[Jerome Kern]], and [[George Gershwin]] but also the lyrics of writers such as [[Ira Gershwin]], [[Dorothy Fields]], [[Otto Harbach]], and [[Oscar Hammerstein II]]. For example, Sondheim notes that the torch song "[[Losing My Mind]]" sung in the show contains "near-stenciled rhythms and harmonies" from the Gershwins' [[The Man I Love (song)|"The Man I Love"]] and lyrics written in the style of Dorothy Fields.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Sondheim, "Follies" Finishing the Hat (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2010), p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of musical pastiche also appear in other Sondheim shows including [[Gypsy (musical) | ''Gypsy'']], [[Saturday Night (musical) | ''Saturday Night'']], and ''[[Anyone Can Whistle]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Sondheim, "Follies", Finishing the Hat (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2010), p.200.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===

Pastiche can also be a [[Cinematic techniques|cinematic]] device whereby filmmakers pay [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to another filmmaker's style and use of [[cinematography]], including camera angles, [[lighting]], and [[mise en scène]]. A film's writer may also offer a pastiche based on the works of other writers (this is especially evident in historical films and [[documentaries]] but can be found in [[non-fiction]] [[drama]], [[comedy]] and [[Horror film|horror]] films as well). Italian director [[Sergio Leone]]`s [[Once Upon a Time in the West]] is a pastiche of earlier American [[Westerns]]. Another major filmmaker, [[Quentin Tarantino]], often uses various plots, characteristics and themes from many lesser-known films to create his films, among them from the films of Sergio Leone, in effect creating a pastiche of a pastiche. Tarantino has openly stated that "I steal from every single movie ever made."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/markets-festivals/quentin-tarantino-the-great-recycler-1200703098/|title=Quentin Tarantino: The Great Recycler|first=Peter|last=Debruge|date=7 October 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Director [[Todd Haynes]]' 2002 film [[Far From Heaven]] was a conscious attempt to replicate a typical [[Douglas Sirk]] melodrama - in particular [[All That Heaven Allows]]. The film works as a mostly reverential and unironic tribute to Sirk's filmmaking, lovingly re-creating the stylized mise-en-scene, colors, costumes, cinematography and lighting of Sirkian melodrama.

In cinema, the influence of [[George Lucas]]' ''[[Star Wars]]'' films (spawning their own pastiches, such as the 1983 3D film ''[[Metalstorm: The Destruction of Jared-Syn]]'') can be regarded as a function of [[postmodernity]].&lt;ref name="Jameson, 1991"&gt;(Jameson, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Sandoval, Chela. Methodology of the Oppressed. Minneapolis,MN: University of Minnesota Press, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Architecture ===
In discussions of [[urban planning]], the term "pastiche" may describe developments as imitations of the building styles created by major [[architects]]: with the implication that the derivative work is unoriginal and of little merit, and the term is generally attributed without reference to its urban context. Many post-war European developments can in this way be described as pastiches of the work of architects and planners such as [[Le Corbusier]] or [[Ebenezer Howard]]. The term itself is not pejorative,&lt;ref&gt;Jamses Stevens Curl, "Oxford Dictionary of Architecture", 2006, p562.&lt;/ref&gt; however [[Alain de Botton]] describes pastiche as "an unconvincing reproduction of the styles of the past".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work= [[Channel 4]]|url= http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-perfect-home/episode-guide|title= Alain de Botton: The Perfect Home}}

'''Pre-Romanesque art and architecture''' is the period in European art from either the emergence of the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian kingdom]] in about AD 500 or from the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] in the late 8th century, to the beginning of the 11th century [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] period. The term is generally used in English only for [[architecture]] and [[monumental sculpture]], but here all the arts of the period are briefly described.

The primary theme during this period is the introduction and absorption of [[Classical art|classical]] Mediterranean and [[Early Christian art|Early Christian]] forms with Germanic ones, which fostered innovative new forms. This in turn led to the rise of Romanesque art in the 11th century. In the outline of [[Medieval art]] it was preceded by what is commonly called the [[Migration Period art]] of the "barbarian" peoples: [[Insular art|Hiberno-Saxon]] in the British Isles and predominantly [[Merovingian art and architecture|Merovingian]] on the Continent.

In most of western Europe, the [[Roman architecture|Roman]] architectural tradition survived the collapse of the empire. The Merovingians ([[Franks]]) continued to build large stone buildings like [[monastery]] [[church architecture|churches]] and palaces.

The unification of the Frankish kingdom under [[Clovis I]] (465–511) and his successors, corresponded with the need for the building of churches, and especially monastery churches, as these were now the power-houses of the Merovingian church. Two hundred monasteries existed south of the [[Loire]] when [[St Columbanus]], an Irish missionary, arrived in Europe in 585.  Only 100 years later, by the end of the 7th century, over 400 flourished in the Merovingian kingdom alone.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.all-art.org/history128-2.html&lt;/ref&gt; The building plans often continued the Roman basilica tradition.

Many Merovingian plans have been reconstructed from archaeology. The description in [[Bishop]] [[Gregory of Tours]]' ''History of the Franks'' of the basilica of Saint-Martin, built at [[Tours]] by [[Saint Perpetuus]] (bishop 460–490) at the beginning of the period and at the time on the edge of Frankish territory, gives cause to regret the disappearance of this building, one of the most beautiful Merovingian churches, which he says had 120 marble columns, towers at the East end, and several mosaics: "Saint-Martin displayed the vertical emphasis, and the combination of block-units forming a complex internal space and the correspondingly rich external silhouette, which were to be the hallmarks of the Romanesque".&lt;ref&gt;V.I. Atroshenko and Judith Collins, ''The Origins of the Romanesque'' (Lund Humphries, London) 1985, p. 48. {{ISBN|0-85331-487-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Merovingian dynasty were replaced by the [[Carolingian dynasty]] in AD 752, which led to [[Carolingian architecture]] from 780 to 900, and [[Ottonian architecture]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] from the mid-10th century until the mid-11th century. These successive Frankish dynasties were large contributors to [[Romanesque architecture]].

==Imperial styles==

===Carolingian art===
[[File:Ebbo Gospels St Mark.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Saint Mark, from the so-called [[Ebbo Gospels]], a piece of Carolingian illustration.]]
{{main|Carolingian art|Carolingian architecture}}

Carolingian art is the roughly 120-year period from about 780 to 900, during [[Charlemagne]]'s and his immediate heirs' rule, popularly known as the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]. Although brief, it was very influential; northern European kings promoted classical Mediterranean Roman art forms for the first time, while also creating innovative new forms such as naturalistic figure line drawings that would have lasting influence. Carolingian churches generally are [[basilica]]n, like the [[Early Christian art and architecture|Early Christian]] churches of Rome, and commonly incorporated [[westwork]]s, which is arguably the precedent for the western facades of later medieval cathedrals. An original [[westwork]] survives today at the [[Abbey of Corvey]], built in 885. After a rather chaotic interval following the Carolingian period, the new [[Ottonian dynasty]] revived Imperial art from about 950, building on and further developing Carolingian style in [[Ottonian art]].

===Ottonian art===
{{main|Ottonian art|Ottonian architecture}}
[[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] pre-Romanesque art during the 120-year period from 936 to 1056 is commonly called Ottonian art after the three [[Ottonian dynasty|Saxon]] emperors named Otto ([[Otto the Great|Otto I]], [[Otto II]], and [[Otto III]]) who ruled the [[Holy Roman Empire]] from 936 to 1001.

After the decline of the Carolingian Empire, the Holy Roman Empire was re-established under the Saxon (Ottonian) dynasty. From this emerged a renewed faith in the idea of Empire and a reformed Church, creating a period of heightened cultural and artistic fervour. It was in this atmosphere that masterpieces were created that fused the traditions from which Ottonian artists derived their inspiration: models of Late Antique, Carolingian, and Byzantine origin.

Much Ottonian art reflected the dynasty's desire to establish visually a link to the Christian rulers of Late Antiquity, such as [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]], Theoderich, and [[Justinian]] as well as to their Carolingian predecessors, particularly [[Charlemagne]].

Ottonian monasteries produced some of the most magnificent medieval illuminated manuscripts. They were a major art form of the time, and monasteries received direct sponsorship from emperors and bishops, having the best in equipment and talent available.

==Regional styles==

===Croatia===
{{Main|Croatian Pre-Romanesque art and architecture}}
[[File:Zadar2.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Pre-Romanesque Church of [[Donatus of Zadar|St Donatus]] in [[Zadar]], from the 9th century.]]

In the 7th century the [[Croats]], with other [[Slavs]] and [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], came from Northern Europe to the region where they live today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rastko.org.rs/arheologija/vsedov-slavs_2.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111211445/http://www.rastko.org.rs/arheologija/vsedov-slavs_2.html |archivedate=2013-11-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Croatian churches were built as royal sanctuaries, and the influence of Roman art was strongest in Dalmatia where urbanization was thickest. Gradually that influence was neglected and certain simplifications and alterations of inherited forms, and even creation of original buildings, appeared.

All of them (a dozen large ones and hundreds of small ones) were built with roughly cut stone bounded with a thick layer of malter on the outside. Large churches are longitudinal with one or three [[naves]] like [[Church of Holy Salvation, Cetina|Church of Holy Salvation]] ({{lang-hr|Crkva Sv. Spasa}}) at the spring of the river [[Cetina]], built in the 9th century, along with the [[Church of Saint Cross]] in [[Nin, Croatia|Nin]]. The largest and most complicated central based church from the 9th century is dedicated to [[Donatus of Zadar|Saint Donatus]] in [[Zadar]].

[[Altar]] rails and windows of those churches were highly decorated with transparent shallow string-like [[Ornament (architecture)|ornament]] that is called ''[[pleter]]'' (meaning to weed) because the strings were threaded and rethreaded through itself. Motifs of those reliefs were taken from Roman art; sometimes figures from the Bible appeared alongside this decoration, like ''relief in Holy Nedjeljica'' in Zadar, and then they were subdued by their pattern. This also happened to engravings in early Croatian script – [[Glagolitic]]. Soon, the Glagolitic writings were replaced with [[Latin]] on altar rails and [[architrave]]s of old-Croatian churches.

From the ''Crown Church of [[King Zvonimir]]'' (so called ''Hollow Church'' in [[Solin, Croatia|Solin]]) comes the altar board with ''figure of Croatian King'' on the throne with [[Carolingian]] crown, servant by his side and subject bowed to the king.

By joining the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] crown in the twelfth century, Croatia lost its full independence, but it did not lose its ties with the south and the west, and instead this ensured the beginning of a new era of [[Central Europe]]an cultural influence.

===England===
{{main|Anglo-Saxon art|Anglo-Saxon architecture}}
[[File:Meister des Benedictionale des Heiligen Aethelwold 001.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Benedictional of St. Æthelwold|Benedictional of Saint Aethelwold]], an [[List of illuminated Anglo-Saxon manuscripts|Anglo-Saxon illuminated manuscript]].]]

Anglo-Saxon art covers the period from the time of [[King Alfred]] (885), with the revival of English culture after the end of the Viking raids, to the early 12th century, when [[Romanesque art]] became the new movement. Prior to King Alfred there had been the [[Hiberno-Saxon]] culture, producing in [[Insular art]] the fusion of Anglo-Saxon and Celtic techniques and motifs, which had largely ceased in Ireland and Northern England with the [[Viking]] invasions. Anglo-Saxon art is mainly known today through [[illuminated manuscripts]] and metalwork.

===France===
After the demise of the Carolingian Empire, France split into a number of feuding provinces, so that lacking any organized Imperial patronage, French art of the 10th and 11th centuries became localised around the large monasteries, and lacked the sophistication of a court-directed style.

Multiple regional styles developed based on the chance availability of Carolingian manuscripts (as models to draw from), and the availability of itinerant artists. The monastery of [[Saint Bertin]] became an important centre under its abbot [[Odbert]] (986–1007) who created a new style based on Anglo-Saxon and Carolingian forms. The nearby abbey of [[Abbey of St. Vaast|Saint Vaast]] created a number of works. In southwestern France at the [[Abbey of Saint Martial, Limoges|monastery of Saint Martial]] in [[Limoges]] a number of manuscripts were produced around year 1000, as were produced in [[Albi]], [[Figeac]] and [[Saint-Sever-de-Rustan]] in [[Gascony]]. In Paris there developed a style at the abbey of [[Saint Germain-des-Prés]]. In [[Normandy]] a new style developed from 975 onward.

===Spain and Portugal===
{{main|Spanish Pre-Romanesque art and architecture}}
[[File:Capela de S. Frutuoso.JPG|thumb|right|[[Saint Frutuoso Chapel]] in [[Braga]], Portugal.]]
The first form of Pre-Romanesque in [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]] was the [[Visigothic art]], that brought the horse-shoe arches to the latter [[Moorish architecture]] and developed jewellery.

After the Moorish occupation, Pre-Romanesque art was first reduced to the [[Kingdom of Asturias]], the only Christian realm in the area at the time which reached high levels of artistic depuration. (See ''[[Asturian art]]''). The Christians who lived in Moorish territory, the [[Mozarab]]s, created their own architectural and illumination style, [[Mozarabic art]].

The best preserved Visigothic monument in [[Portugal]] is the [[Saint Frutuoso Chapel]] in [[Braga]].

===Italy===
{{see also|Lombard Romanesque}}
Southern Italy benefited from the presence and cross fertilization of the Byzantines, the Arabs, and the Normans, while the north was mostly controlled first by the Carolingians. The [[Italo-Norman|Normans]] in Sicily chose to commission Byzantine workshops to decorate their churches such as [[Monreale]] and [[Cefalù Cathedral]]s where full iconographic programmes of [[mosaic]]s have survived. Important frescos and illuminated manuscripts were produced.

A '''public participation geographic information system''' ('''PPGIS''') is meant to bring the academic practices of [[Geographic information system|GIS]] and mapping to the local level in order to promote knowledge production by local and non-governmental groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schuurman|first1=Nadine|title=GIS: A Short Introduction|date=2008|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=USA, UK, Australia|isbn=978-0-631-23533-0|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea behind PPGIS is empowerment and inclusion of marginalized populations, who have little voice in the public arena, through geographic technology education and participation. PPGIS uses and produces digital maps, satellite imagery, sketch maps, and many other spatial and visual tools, to change geographic involvement and awareness on a local level. The term was coined in 1996 at the meetings of the [[National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis]] (NCGIA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schuurman|first1=Nadine|title=GIS: A Short Introduction|date=2008|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=USA, UK, Australia|isbn=978-0-631-23533-0|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sieber, R. 2006. Public Participation and Geographic Information Systems: A Literature Review and Framework. ''Annals of the American Association of Geographers'', 96/3:491-507&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spatial.maine.edu/~schroedr/ppgis/ppgishom.html Public Participation GIS, NCGIA Workshop (Orono, Maine, US, 10–13 July 1996)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Attendees to the ''Mapping for Change International Conference on Participatory Spatial Information Management and Communication'' conferred to at least three potential implications of PPGIS; it can: (1) enhance capacity in generating, managing, and communicating spatial information; (2) stimulate innovation; and ultimately; (3) encourage positive social change.&lt;ref&gt;Corbett, et al. 2006. [http://www.iied.org/NR/agbioliv/pla_notes/documents/NEWch01_overview_pp13-19.pdf Overview: Mapping for Change-the emergence of a new practice]. ''Participatory Learning and Action'', 54:13–19.&lt;/ref&gt;  This reflects on the rather nebulous definition of PPGIS as referenced in the ''Encyclopedia of GIS''&lt;ref&gt;Tulloch, D., 2008. "Public Participation GIS (PPGIS)," in K. Kemp (Eds.) ''Encyclopedia of GIS'': Sage Publications, p. 351-353.&lt;/ref&gt; which describes PPGIS as having a definition problem.

There are a range of applications for PPGIS. The potential outcomes can be applied from community and [[neighborhood planning]] and development to environmental and [[natural resource management]].  Marginalized groups, be they [[grassroots]] organizations to [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous populations]] could benefit from GIS technology.

Governments, [[Non-governmental organization|non-government organizations]] and [[Non-profit organization|non-profit groups]] are a big force behind many programs. The current extent of PPGIS programs in the US has been evaluated by Sawicki and Peterman.&lt;ref&gt;Craig, et al. 2002. ''Community Participation and Geographic Information Systems''. London: Taylor and Francis&lt;/ref&gt; They catalog over 60 PPGIS programs who aid in "public participation in community decision making by providing local-area data to community groups," in the United States (Craig et al., 2002:24).  The organizations providing these programs are mostly universities, local [[Chamber of commerce|chambers of commerce]], non-profit [[Foundation (charity)|foundations]].

In general, neighborhood empowerment groups can form and gain access to information that is normally very easy for the official government and planning offices to obtain.  It is easier for this to happen than for individuals of lower-income neighborhoods just working by themselves. There have been several projects where university students help implement GIS in neighborhoods and communities.  It is believed{{By whom|date=April 2010}} that access to information is the doorway to more effective government for everybody and community empowerment.  In a case study of a group in Milwaukee, residents of an [[inner city]] neighborhood became active participants in building a community information system, learning to access public information and create and analyze new databases derived from their own surveys, all with the purpose of making these residents useful actors in city management and in the formation of public policy.&lt;ref&gt;Ghose 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  In many cases, there are providers of data for community groups, but the groups may not know that such entities exist.  Getting the word out would be beneficial.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Some of the spatial data that the neighborhood wanted was information on abandoned or boarded-up buildings and homes, vacant lots, and properties that contained garbage, rubbish and debris that contributed to health and safety issues in the area.  They also appreciated being able to find landlords that were not keeping up the properties.  The university team and the community were able to build databases and make maps that would help them find these areas and perform the spatial analysis that they needed.  Community members learned how to use the computer resources, ArcView 1.0, and build a theme or land use map of the surrounding area.  They were able to perform spatial queries and analyze neighborhood problems.  Some of these problems included finding absentee landlords and finding code violations for the buildings on the maps (Ghose 2001).

==Approaches==
There are two approaches to PPGIS use and application. These two perspectives, top–down and bottom–up, are the currently debated schism in PPGIS.

===Top-down===
According to Sieber (2006), PPGIS was first envisioned as a means of mapping individuals by many social and economic demographic factors in order to analyze the spatial differences in access to social services.  She refers to this kind of PPGIS as ''top-down'', being that it is less hands on for the public, but theoretically serves the public by making adjustments for the deficiencies, and improvements in public management.&lt;ref&gt;Sieber, R. 2006. Public Participation and Geographic Information Systems: A Literature Review and Framework. ''Annals of the American Association of Geographers'', 96/3:491-507&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bottom-up===
A current trend with academic involvement in PPGIS, is researching existing programs, and or starting programs in order to collect data on the effectiveness of PPGIS.  Elwood (2006) in ''The Professional Geographer'', talks in depth about the "everyday inclusions, exclusions, and contradictions of Participatory GIS research."&lt;ref&gt;Elwood, S. 2006. Negotiating Knowledge Production: The Everyday Inclusions, Exclusions, and Contradictions of Participatory GIS Research. ''The Professional Geographer'', 58/2:197.&lt;/ref&gt;   The research is being conducted in order to evaluate if PPGIS is involving the public equally.  In reference to Sieber's top-down PPGIS, this is a counter method of PPGIS, rightly referred to as ''bottom-up'' PPGIS.  Its purpose is to work with the public to let them learn the technologies, then producing their own GIS.

Public participation GIS is defined by Sieber as the use of geographic information systems to broaden public involvement in policymaking as well as to the value of GIS to promote the goals of nongovernmental organizations, grassroots groups and community-based organizations (Sieber 2006).  It would seem on the surface that PPGIS, as it is commonly referred to, in this sense would be of a beneficial nature to those in the community or area that is being represented.  But in truth only certain groups or individuals will be able to obtain the technology and use it.  Is PPGIS becoming more available to the underprivileged sector of the community?  The question of "who benefits?" should always be asked, and does this harm a community or group of individuals.

The local, participatory management of urban neighborhoods usually follows on from 'claiming the territory', and has to be made compatible with national or local authority regulations on administering, managing and planning urban territory (McCall 2003). PPGIS applied to participatory community/neighborhood planning has been examined by, among many others, [Howard (1999)], [Carver, Evans, Kingston, and Turton (1999)], [Leitner, McMaster, Elwood, McMaster, and Sheppard (2002)], and [Talen (1999)]. Specific attention has been given to applications such as housing issues (e.g. [Elwood (2002)]) or neighborhood revitalization (e.g. [Craig &amp; Elwood (1998)]). Spatial databases along with the P-mapping are used to maintain a public records GIS or community land information systems (e.g. [Ventura, Niemann, Sutphin, &amp; Chenoweth (2002)]).  These are just a few of the uses of GIS in the community.

====Examples====

Public Participation in decision making processes works not only to identify areas of common values or variability, but also as an illustrative and instructional tool.  One example of effective dialogue and building trust between the community and decision makers comes from pre-planning for development in the United Kingdom.  It involves using GIS and [[multi-criteria decision analysis]] (MCDA) to make a decision about wind farm siting.  This method hinges upon taking all stakeholder perspectives into account to improve chances of reaching consensus .  This also creates a more transparent process and adds weight to the final decision by building upon traditional methods such as public meetings and hearings, surveys, focus groups, and deliberative processes enabling participants more insights and more informed opinions on environmental issues.&lt;ref&gt;Higgs, G., Berry, R., Kidner, D, Langford, M. Using IT approaches to promote public participation in renewable energy planning: Prospects and challenges.  2008.  Land Use Policy 25, 596-607.&lt;/ref&gt;

Collaborative processes that consider objective and subjective inputs have the potential to efficiently address some of the conflict between development and nature as they involve a fuller justification by wind farm developers for location, scale, and design.  Spatial tools such as creation of 3D view sheds offer participants new ways of assessing visual intrusion to make a more informed decision.  Higgs et al. make a very telling statement when analyzing the success of this project – "the only way of accommodating people's landscape concerns is to site wind farms in places that people find more acceptable".  This implies that developers recognize the validity of citizens' concerns and are willing to compromise in identifying sites where wind farms will not only be successful financially, but also successful politically and socially.  This creates greater accountability and facilitates the incorporation of stakeholder values to resolve differences and gain public acceptance for vital development projects.

In another planning example, Simao et al. analyzed how to create sustainable development options with widespread community support.  They determined that stakeholders need to learn likely outcomes that result from stated preferences, which can be supported through enhanced access to information and incentives to increase public participation.  Through a multi-criteria spatial [[decision support system]] stakeholders were able to voice concerns and work on a compromise solution to have final outcome accepted by majority when siting wind farms.  This differs from the work of Higgs et al. in that the focus was on allowing users to learn from the collaborative process, both interactively and iteratively about the nature of the problem and their own preferences for desirable characteristics of solution.

This stimulated sharing of opinions and discussion of interests behind preferences.  After understanding the problem more fully, participants could discuss alternative solutions and interact with other participants to come to a compromise solution.&lt;ref&gt;Simao, A., Densham, P.J., Haklay, M.  Web-based GIS for collaborative planning and public participation: An application to the strategic planning of wind farm sites.  2009, Journal of Environmental Management, 90, 2027-2040&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar work has been done to incorporate public participation in spatial planning for transportation system development,&lt;ref&gt;Zhong, E. A model for public involvement programming using participatory Geographic Information Systems.  2008.  Computers, Environment, and Urban Systems 32 (2008) 123–133&lt;/ref&gt; and this method of two-way benefits is even beginning to move towards web-based mapping services to further simplify and extend the process into the community.&lt;ref&gt;Kingston, R.

[[File:Straßendorf.svg|thumb|Example of a ribbon development]]
[[File:Dubiny fragment wsi 12.07.2009 p.jpg|thumb|Polish village Dubiny, example of an old ribbon village]]
'''Ribbon development''' is building houses along the routes of communications radiating from a human settlement. Such development generated great concern in the [[United Kingdom]] during the 1920s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trumpingtonlocalhistorygroup.org/timeline_20Cearly.html|title=Trumpington Local History Group, Trumpington Timeline: 1901 - 1950|website=www.trumpingtonlocalhistorygroup.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1930s as well as in numerous other countries.

Normally and the very first ribbons are focussed on roads. Following the [[Industrial Revolution]], ribbon development became prevalent along [[railway]] lines: predominantly in [[Russia]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]]. However the cost of building stations, their attraction and need for accompanying roads usually led to new small urban centres and broader settlements. Ribbon development created great attractiveness on isolated roads as increasing [[motor car]] ownership meant that houses could be sold easily even if they were remote from workplaces and urban centres. It was attractive to developers because they did not have to waste money or plot space constructing roads. It also enabled spaces at the interstice between several urban areas appealing to potential buyers needing to access either or many of these.

The extent of the practice around roads led to its problems becoming intense and recognition as an inefficient use of resources, requiring bypass roads to be built, and often a precursor to untrammelled [[urban sprawl]], so a key aim for the United Kingdom's [[town and country planning in the United Kingdom|post-war planning system]] was to implement a presumption and convention that proposed new ribbon development is inappropriate. Urban sprawl/suburbanisation of large areas led to the introduction of [[green belt]] policies, new towns, planned suburbs and garden cities.

==History==
Following the [[Industrial Revolution]], ribbon development became prevalent along [[railway]] lines: predominantly in [[Russia]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]]. A good example of this was the deliberate promotion of [[Metro-land]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://easyweb.easynet.co.uk/~gsgleaves/london7.htm MetroLand] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401220840/http://easyweb.easynet.co.uk/~gsgleaves/london7.htm |date=2012-04-01 }}.

Similar evidence can be found from [[Long Island]] (where Frederick W Dunton bought much real estate to encourage [[New York City|New York]]ers to settle along the [[Long Island Rail Road]] lines),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dunton.org/archive/LongIslandRailroad.htm Long Island Railroad History Page - The Dunton Archive].

It can also occur along [[ridge]] lines, [[canal]]s and [[coastline]]s, the last occurring especially as people seeking [[seachange (demography)|seachange]] lifestyles build their houses where they can get the best view.

The resulting towns and cities are often difficult to service efficiently. Often, the first problems noticed by residents is [[traffic congestion]], as people compete to move along the narrow urban corridor while ever more people join the ribbon further along the corridor. [[Urban consolidation]] is often a solution to encourage growth towards a more compact urban form.

Ribbon development can also be compared with a [[linear village]], a village that grew along a transportation route, not as part of a city's expansion.

Ribbon development has long been viewed as an especial problem in the [[Republic of Ireland]], where "[[One-off housing|one-off houses]]" proliferate on rural roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=_I5_zN9Uqa8C&amp;pg=PA97&amp;dq=ribbon+development+ireland&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj_ivXehtvZAhULIMAKHT3TCosQ6AEILTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=ribbon+development+ireland&amp;f=false|title=Ireland Unbound: A Turn of the Century Chronicle|first1=Michel|last1=Peillon|first2=Mary P.|last2=Corcoran|date=7 March 2018|publisher=Institute of Public Administration|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; This causes difficulties in the efficient supply of water, [[sewerage]], [[broadband]], electricity, telephones and [[public transport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=Xc-d1qxTg9AC&amp;pg=PA238&amp;dq=ribbon+development+ireland&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj_ivXehtvZAhULIMAKHT3TCosQ6AEITzAH#v=onepage&amp;q=ribbon+development+ireland&amp;f=false|title=Ireland|first=Catharina|last=Day|date=7 March 2018|publisher=New Holland Publishers|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/regionals/fingalindependent/news/housing-limit-to-prevent-ribbon-development-on-rural-roadsides-27805632.html|title=Housing limit to prevent 'ribbon development' on rural roadsides - Independent.ie|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, Frank McDonald contrasted development in the Republic with that in [[Northern Ireland]]: ''"[[Enniskillen]] [''in Northern Ireland''] is well defined with clear boundaries to the town and well-laid-out shopping streets. [[Letterkenny]], [''in the Republic''] by contrast, appears as just one long street with bungalow development trailing off over all the surrounding hills."''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ribbon-development-in-rural-housing-criticised-1.200147&lt;/ref&gt; The houses (ofter disparaged as "[[McMansion]]s") are also criticised for spoiling countryside scenery: [[Monaghan County Council]] in 2013 declared that "The Council will resist development that would create or extend ribbon development."&lt;ref&gt;https://monaghan.ie/planning/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/12/RibbonDevelopmentDec2015.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irishspatialstrategy.ie/Rural%20Planning%20Guidelines%2013505.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tipperary County Council]] and many other councils have adopted similar policies.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tipperarycoco.ie/sites/default/files/Chapter%205%20Housing.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Centre Scientifique et Technique du Bâtiment'' ('''Scientific and Technical Center for Building''') CSTB, is the French national organisation providing research and innovation, consultancy, testing, training and certification services in the construction industry.

It was founded in 1947 after the [[World War II|Second World War]] to support the reconstruction effort.

The mission of the CSTB is to ensure the quality and safety of buildings, and support innovation from the idea to the market. It brings together multidisciplinary skills to develop and share essential scientific and technical knowledge, and to provide stakeholders with answers to the challenges of their professional practice.

The CSTB focuses on four key activities: research and consulting, assessment, certification and dissemination of knowledge. Its field of expertise covers construction products, buildings, and their integration into neighborhoods and cities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://institut-carnot.cstb.fr/en/about-us/missions/ Official website, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Southern California Marine Institute (SCMI)''' is a multi-campus research facility and [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]] [[Oceanography|oceanographic institution]] headquartered in [[Terminal Island, California]].

==History==
In the late 1960s, marine scientists working at six campuses of the [[California State University|CSU system]] in the [[Los Angeles basin]] (Dominguez Hills, Fullerton, Long Beach, Los Angeles, Northridge, and Cal Poly Pomona) proposed the formation of an institute that would provide the advancement of marine programs. It was until 1971, when the university system decided to purchase the naval vessel R/V Nautilus for that specific purpose. In 1972, the creation of the Southern California Ocean Studies Consortium (SCOSC) was approved by the Trustees and the Presidents of the founding campuses and the operation of the R/V Nautilus floating marine laboratory began.

The University of California Los Angeles is in partnership with the Institute, thereby increasing marine research in Los Angeles, and providing educational opportunities for its students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newsroom.ucla.edu/portal/ucla/ucla-joins-the-southern-california-188738.aspx |title=UCLA joins Southern California Marine Institute to revitalize marine research in Los Angeles |first1=Kim |last1=DeRose |date=December 17, 2010 |accessdate=March 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==

'''''The Making of the Representative for Planet 8''''' is a 1982 science fiction novel by [[Doris Lessing]]. It is the fourth book in her five-book ''[[Canopus in Argos]]'' series&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dorislessing.org/canopusin.html |title=Canopus in Argos: Archives |work=dorislessing.org |accessdate=14 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and relates the fate of a planet, under the care of the benevolent galactic empire [[Canopus]], that is plunged into an [[ice age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dorislessing.org/thethe.html |title=The Making of the Representative for Planet 8 |work=dorislessing.org |accessdate=14 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first published in the United States in January 1982 by [[Alfred A. Knopf]], and in the United Kingdom in March 1982 by [[Jonathan Cape]].

[[Christopher Lehmann-Haupt]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote in a review of this book that "the effect of the story is powerful and immediate – with all the drama of good polar-exploration literature, and the eloquence, at its best, of the King James Bible."&lt;ref name=NYT-CLH&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C00E3DD1F38F93AA15752C0A964948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Books of the Times: The Making of the Representative for Planet 8 |first=Christopher |last=Lehmann-Haupt |authorlink=Christopher Lehmann-Haupt |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=14 October 2008 | date=29 January 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[John Leonard (American critic)|John Leonard]], also of The New York Times, was critical of Lessing's switch to science fiction and in a review of this book, complained that "Mrs. Lessing is no longer very interested in people. She has come to feel that individuality is a 'degenerative disease'... She seems ... to be in the process of junking not only traditional narrative and conventional characters but the details of feeling as well..."&lt;ref name=NYT-JL&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E2DE163BF934A35751C0A964948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=The Spacing Out of Doris Lessing |first=John |last=Leonard |authorlink=John Leonard (American critic) |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=14 October 2008 | date=7 February 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Making of the Representative for Planet 8'' can be read as a stand-alone book, although it does make reference to the planet ''[[Shikasta]]'', introduced in the first book of the ''Canopus'' series.

==Plot==
Planet 8 is a small [[planet|world]] that was colonised by the benevolent galactic empire [[Canopus]] and populated with a new [[species]] created from the stock of four different species originating on several other Canopean planets. Planet 8 has a warm [[Temperateness|temperate climate]] and, under Canopus's skilled guidance, the inhabitants live comfortably and at peace with themselves and their world.

One day Canopus instructs them to build a huge wall, to exact Canopean specifications, right around the girth of the planet. The construction takes the inhabitants years to complete, and when it is finished, Canopus tells the planet's representatives, leaders of each of the planet's main disciplines, to relocate all settlements north of the wall to the south. Canopus informs everyone that unfortunate interstellar "re-alignments" have taken place and that Planet 8 will soon experience an [[ice age]]. After a while temperatures start to drop and the climate begins to change. [[Glacier]]s form in the north and slowly advance towards the wall. Canopus, however, assures Planet 8 that Canopus has a new home for them, a peaceful and prosperous world called Rohanda (the subject of the first book in this series, ''[[Shikasta]]''), and that when it has reached a certain level of development, Canopus will space-lift the inhabitants of Planet 8 to Rohanda. This fills the people of Planet 8 with hope as they are forced to adapt their lifestyles to cope with this new and unfamiliar climate.

By the time the glaciers reach the wall, much of the vegetation in the south has been destroyed by snow and ice and conditions grow worse. Conflict breaks out amongst the erstwhile peaceful villagers as food becomes scarce. But the wall holds the glaciers back and the people still remain resolute in their faith that Canopus will rescue them. Then Canopean agent Johor (first introduced in ''Shikasta'') arrives on Planet 8 with the devastating news that disaster has struck Rohanda: it has been renamed Shikasta (the stricken) and is no longer available for re-settlement. But Johor does not leave Planet 8. He remains to endure the hardships with the villagers and does what he can to help them face their inevitable demise.

In time, when the population is now faced with starvation, the wall, which was only a temporary barrier, gives way and the glaciers start over-running settlements in the south. The senior representatives, at a loss as to what to do, head north over the wall and onto the glacier. Johor travels with them as they try to reach the [[Geographical pole|pole]], but they soon all succumb to cold and hunger. Their physical bodies perish, but their "[[being]]s" rise and merge into a single [[consciousness]] that becomes the Representative for Planet 8 and all its memories. After watching Planet 8 freeze over completely, the Representative departs for a place "where Canopus tends and guards and instructs."{{sfn|Lessing|1994|loc=p. 161}}

==Afterword==
The book contains a 30-page [[afterword]] in which Lessing states that ''The Making of the Representative for Planet 8'' and the previous book in this series, ''[[The Sirian Experiments]]'' were inspired by her 50-year fascination in the ill-fated [[Terra Nova Expedition|1910–13 Antarctic expedition]] of [[Robert Falcon Scott]],&lt;ref name=NYT-CLH/&gt; though not, she points out, by the element of ice and polar conditions in itself.{{sfn|Lessing|1994|loc="Afterword", p. 162}}

Lessing expresses a concern that Scott and his explorers, heroes in their day, were vilified by recent generations. She analyses the disastrous expedition and the changes as to how it, and Scott himself, have been viewed by posterity, and discusses these changes in the popular views of the journey in connection with the changing fashions of thought and the decline of imperialist ideas. The efforts of Scott and his men, she concludes, should be understood as a deliberate wager with destiny rather than a scientific project: they tried to transcend themselves by taking on responsibilities they knew they might not be fully equipped for or experienced enough to handle, which ultimately cost many of them their lives. Lessing explicitly likens this view of the pride in sacrifice and self-transcending to the expectations and propaganda imagery of the [[First World War]] soon after.{{sfn|Lessing|1994|loc="Afterword", p. 162}}

==Adaptations==
*''[[The Making of the Representative for Planet 8 (opera)|The Making of the Representative for Planet 8]]'' (opera, 1986)

''The Making of the Representative for Planet 8'' was adapted for the opera in 1986 by composer [[Philip Glass]] with [[libretto|story-libretto]] by [[Doris Lessing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chesternovello.com/Default.aspx?TabId=2431&amp;State_2905=2&amp;composerId_2905=540 |title=Philip Glass |work=Chester Music and Novello &amp; Company |accessdate=14 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three-act opera, for orchestra, small chorus and soloists was commissioned by the [[Houston Grand Opera]], the [[English National Opera]] and the Landestheater Kiel in Germany. It first premiered on 8 July 1988 at the Houston Grand Opera in [[Houston, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://philipglass.com/compositions/making_rep_for_planet_8/ |title=Compositions: The Making Of The Representative For Planet 8 |work=Philipglass.com |accessdate=23 June 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101227063031/http://www.philipglass.com/music/compositions/making_rep_for_planet_8.php |archivedate=27 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dorislessing.org/therepresentative.html |title=Opera: The Making Of The Representative For Planet 8 |work=Dorislessing.org |accessdate=14 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British premiere was on 9 November 1988 by the English National Opera at the [[London Coliseum]].

'''The Schools of Public Engagement at The New School''' is one of five academic divisions that compose [[The New School]], a private university located in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of New York City. It includes, the Bachelor's Program for Adults and Transfer Students, [[Milano School of Management, Policy, and Environment]] founded in 1964, School of Media Studies, Creative Writing Program and School of Languages

== History ==

The Schools of Public Engagement at The New School is the direct successor of the original institution making it the oldest division of [[The New School]] having been founded in 1919. The school’s founding members wanted to create a “center for discussion and instruction for mature men and women” and by 1934 it was chartered as a university by the state of New York and began conferring degrees. The division was restructured in September 2011 after it would include both Milano School of Management and Urban Policy and what was then called The New School for General Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Century of Cutting Edge Adult Education|url=http://www.newcombefoundation.org/featured_programs_2012_04.html|publisher=Newcombe Foundation|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Growth and change==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}
Dean Allen Austill led the division from the 1960s to the 1980s. Austill was assisted by Albert Landa, who directed publicity for the New School while also informally acting in many other capacities, and Wallis Osterholz, who was responsible for much of the day-to-day administration. Austill also added areas as guitar study and culinary science to the curriculum. In 1962, Austill initiated the Institute for Retired Professionals, a community of peer learners aged 50 to 90 who develop and participate in challenging discussion groups; the Institute, now headed by Michael Markowitz, still exists today. Austill's subordinate as Chair of Humanities for many of these years was Reuben Abel, a philosopher. Abel was succeeded by Lewis Falb, a specialist in interwar [[Paris]] who broadened the humanities curriculum further. Prominent teachers in this era included the philosopher Paul Edwards; the literary scholars Hasye Cooperman, [[Justus Rosenberg]], and Margaret Boe Birns; the political scientist Ralph Buultjens; and the visual arts instructors Anthony Toney, Minoru Kawabata, and [[Henry C. Pearson]].

== The 1990s and after ==

The New School, for most of its history, operated as a noncredit institution, serving largely white, middle-class, often politically progressive, often [[Jewish]] adults living in [[Manhattan]] who were interested in intellectual stimulation and self-improvement. In the early 1990s, the institution, sensing demographic changes and needing to supplement its revenue,  began to encourage credit students to matriculate at the institution, a trend which culminated in the establishment of the adult BA program in the mid-1990s. The credit students generally represented a younger and more diverse population.

The New School possesses a prestigious MFA program in creative writing, directed by poet and biographer Robert Polito,  that has featured such authors as [[Rick Moody]], [[Colm Toibin]], and [[Marie Ponsot]] as instructors. The division also has an MA program in International Affairs, directed by Michael Cohen,  and, until 2007,  hosted the World Policy Institute, a well-regarded foundation devoted to the study of foreign affairs and formerly led by Stephen Schlesinger.

Several important developments occurred at the institution in the early 2000s. A strong advising program guided the curriculum's transformation from an intellectual free-for-all of courses often taught by teachers with sharply varying credentials to a smaller, more rigorous set of offerings taught by professionals, often bearing the highest degree in their fields.  In 2005, as part of the rebranding of the entire university envisioned by President [[Bob Kerrey]], the division was renamed The New School for General Studies, to clarify its mission and perhaps to invite comparisons with [[Columbia University]]'s prestigious, similarly named [[Columbia University School of General Studies|School of General Studies]]. Also in 2005, the New School agreed to a contract with Local 7902 of ACT-UAW, an affiliate of the [[United Auto Workers]], guaranteeing job security to part-time faculty who had taught at the New School for more than ten semesters.

Following the part-time faculty's success in gaining recognition and security, New School students set about creating a university-wide representative body.  Many efforts had been made to establish a student legislative body, to address student grievances and concerns, but they were stymied by disconnected university divisions and an unenthusiastic administration. However, the long-standing efforts finally paid off in the Fall 2006 term when a University-wide Student Senate was formed involving representatives from all of the school's divisions. The USS gained administration support and funding from the board of trustees and is set to ratify a new constitution. Beginning during the Spring 2007 semester, representatives were elected from each division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newschool.edu/uploadedFiles/News/Lang/inprint_061212.pdf|author=Hartmann, Rob|title=New Face for Student Gov't|accessdate=2007-05-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610035015/http://www.newschool.edu/uploadedFiles/News/Lang/inprint_061212.pdf|archivedate=2010-06-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Trinity University Banner.jpg|left|thumb|175px|Trinity University Banner]]
[[Cumberland Presbyterian Church|Cumberland Presbyterian]]s founded Trinity in 1869 in [[Tehuacana, Texas]]  from the remnants of three small Cumberland Presbyterian colleges that had lost significant enrollment during the [[Texas in the Civil War|Civil War]]. [[John Boyd (Texas Congressman)|John Boyd]], who had served in the [[Congress of the Republic of Texas]] from 1836 to 1845 and in the [[Texas Senate]] from 1862 to 1863, donated 1,100 acres of land and financial assistance to establish the new university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Cecil, Jr. |last=Harper |title=BOYD, JOHN |encyclopedia=Handbook of Texas Online |url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fbo59 |date=2010-06-12 |publisher=[[Texas State Historical Association]] |access-date=2014-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Elizabeth LeNoir |last=Jennett |title=Biographical Directory of the Texan Conventions and Congresses, 1832-1845 |date=1942 |pages=54–55 |url=http://www.lrl.state.tx.us/scanned/members/bios/Bio_Directory_Texas_Convs_Congresses_1832-1845.pdf#page=49 |access-date=2015-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Second Trinity University Campus 1.JPG|250px|thumb|Former Trinity University campus in [[Waxahachie, Texas]]]]
Believing that the school needed the support of a larger community, the university moved in 1902 to [[Waxahachie, Texas]]. In 1906, the university, along with many Cumberland Presbyterian churches, affiliated with the [[United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America|United Presbyterian Church]]. The [[Stock Market Crash of 1929]], however, severely hindered the university's growth. Enrollment declined sharply, indebtedness and faculty attrition mounted, and trustees began using endowment funds to maintain daily operations. Consequently, the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]] placed Trinity's accreditation status on probation in 1936, jeopardizing its future. Once again, its leaders began to consider relocation to a larger community to improve the university's viability.

Meanwhile, in 1942, the [[Methodist Church (USA)|Methodist]]-affiliated [[University of San Antonio]] was failing. San Antonio community leaders, who wished to maintain a [[Protestant]]-affiliated college in the city, approached Trinity with a relocation offer. The university left Waxahachie and took over the campus and alumni of the University of San Antonio. (The old Waxahachie campus is currently home to [[Southwestern Assemblies of God University]]). For the next decade the Woodlawn campus, on the city's near-west side, was Trinity's home while it developed a permanent home. Lacking adequate facilities, the university functioned by using military [[barracks]] and [[Quonset hut]]s to house students and to provide library and classroom space.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.trinity.edu/about-us/trinity-history |title=Trinity University History |website=Trinity University |access-date=2014-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, Trinity acquired a former [[limestone]] [[quarry]] for a new campus and hired Texas [[architect]] [[O'Neil Ford]] to design a master plan and many of the buildings. Construction began in 1950, and the current campus opened in 1952.

When it moved, the campus was largely undeveloped (one classroom building, one dorm, and a nearly empty library were the only completed buildings).&lt;ref name=history/&gt; Yet, under the leadership of Dr. James W. Laurie, the university's 14th president, Trinity took advantage of its new location in a rapidly growing major urban center to grow in academic stature.  Dr. Laurie was responsible for drastically increasing Trinity's endowment, largely funded by the [[James A. Chapman|James A. and Leta M. Chapman]] Charitable Trust of [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Donald E. |last=Everett |url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/kbt32| title=TRINITY UNIVERSITY |encyclopedia=The Handbook of Texas Online| publisher=Texas State Historical Association |date=2010-06-15 |accessdate=2010-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rogersandbell.com/Trusts.aspx |title=Chapman Charitable Trusts - Preserving the Legacy of the Chapman Trusts |website=Rogers and Bell |accessdate=2010-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The stronger endowment allowed Trinity to construct a new, modern campus on its “University on the Hill” location and to increase the quality and range of its faculty while maintaining a high faculty to student ratio. In 1969 Trinity entered into a covenant agreement with the regional synod of the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]] that affirmed historical connections, but transformed Trinity into a private, independent university with a self-perpetuating board of trustees. The campus continues to be a "historically connected" member of the [[Association of Presbyterian Colleges and Universities]].

Trinity's growth continued under Ronald Calgaard, who followed Laurie's successor, Duncan Wimpress. Under Dr. Calgaard, the university implemented a number of changes to raise its profile. For example, Trinity transformed into a residential undergraduate school, requiring all freshmen to live on campus and cutting the number of master's programs offered from more than twenty to four. As well, Trinity decreased its student population from about 3,300 to 3,000 (and eventually to 2,700), increased merit scholarships, increased the focus on national student recruitment, and began scheduling a strong series of speakers and cultural events open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617073736/http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl/1987_454397/trinity-university-stakes-its-future-on-recruiting.html|title=Trinity University stakes its future on recruiting intelligence 04/05/1987 - Archives - Chron.com - Houston Chronicle|date=17 June 2012|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calgaard's successor, [[John R. Brazil]], focused on replacing outdated campus buildings and improving the school's financial resources.  The "Campaign for Trinity University", which launched in September 2005, sought to raise US $200 million for a variety of purposes.  At its conclusion on September 25, 2009, the Campaign raised $205.9 million, surpassing the original goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trinity.edu/departments/development/campaign/news_events/0909_campaign_conclusion.htm |date=2009-09-25 |title=Trinity University’s Capital Campaign Totals $205.9 Million |publisher=Trinity University |accessdate=2010-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222024740/http://www.trinity.edu/departments/development/campaign/news_events/0909_campaign_conclusion.htm |archivedate=February 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Brazil served as Trinity's President in through January 2010. Upon announcement of his retirement, the Board of Trustees awarded him Trinity's Distinguished Service Award, Trinity's most prestigious honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |first=Sharon Jones |last=Schweitzer  |url=http://www.trinity.edu/departments/public_relations/news_releases/090123brazilretire.htm |title=Trinity University President Announces Retirement in 2010 |publisher=Trinity University |date=2009-01-23 |accessdate=2010-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dennis A.

=== Strategic plan ===
In 2011, Trinity undertook the development of a comprehensive ten-year strategic plan, ''Trinity Tomorrow'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://strategicplan.trinity.edu/|website=Trinity University |title=Trinity Tomorrow |date= |accessdate=2015-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; to ensure the long-term sustainability of the university. The board of trustees approved the plan in May 2013, which details four strategic objectives:
*Strengthen opportunities for experiential learning
*Foster productive collisions as a defining characteristic
*Enhance students international engagement and awareness
*Maximize the educational and personal benefits of a residential liberal arts university

and four foundations in order to achieve them:
*Strengthen market position and improve student recruitment
*Be an innovative leader for excellence in teaching and research
*Improve alumni relations, engagement, and giving
*Build the infrastructure to support a 21st-century university

Administrators have begun enacting the details of the plan with positive outcomes. Among other highlights, Trinity:
*adopted a new curriculum;
*increased its marketing locally and nationally; 
*launched centers to focus on college success, experiential learning and career preparedness, and international citizenship;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://new.trinity.edu/news/trinity-launches-three-strategic-centers|website=Trinity University |title=Trinity Launches Three Strategic Centers |date= |accessdate=2015-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and

The full-time, four-year undergraduate program is classified as "more selective, lower transfer-in" and has an arts and sciences focus with some graduate student coexistence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://carnegieclassifications.iu.edu/lookup_listings/view_institution.php?unit_id=229267 |title=Trinity University |website=Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Learning |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2014-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trinity is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and is a member of the [[Phi Beta Kappa Society]]. Full-time undergraduate tuition is $39,560; room and board are $12,754 for 2016-2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://new.trinity.edu/admissions-aid/tuition-fees |title=Tuition &amp; Fees |website=Trinity University |date= |accessdate=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Academics ===
Trinity offers 47 majors and 59 minors in the traditional [[liberal arts]], business, [[Natural science|sciences]], [[fine arts]], and [[engineering]], and graduate programs in [[accounting]], [[teaching]], [[school psychology]], [[Academic administration|school administration]], and [[health care|health care administration]].&lt;ref name="Fast Facts"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.trinity.edu/about-us/fast-facts |title=Fast Facts |website=Trinity University |date= |accessdate=2014-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trinity stresses close interaction between students and faculty members across all disciplines, with a 9:1 student/faculty ratio. The full-time faculty numbers 228, 98% of whom hold a [[Ph.D]]. or other terminal degree in their field.  About 47% of the student body has studied abroad, in over 35 countries.

All undergraduates must demonstrate proficiency across a broad range of academic disciplines, regardless of major. At its core, the Common Curriculum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://inside.trinity.edu/student-success/advising/common-curriculum |website=Inside Trinity |title=Common Curriculum |date= |accessdate=2014-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides the liberal arts foundation for all undergraduate degrees awarded by Trinity. The Common Curriculum consists of the following components:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.trinity.edu/x28972.xml |title=Courses of Study 2013-14 |website=Trinity University |date= |accessdate=2014-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The First-Year Experience (FYE) Program'''''
Starting in fall 2015, all first-year students must complete a 6-credit hour course in their first semester that meets five days a week. The FYE consists of a writing workshop, discussion seminar, and a common day where everyone from the different sections meet for guest speakers, student conferences, or library sessions to assist students in the research process.

'''''Foreign Language, Computer, and Mathematics Skills'''''
*Foreign Languages 
Trinity students must reach a minimum level of competence corresponding to that attained after successful completion of the first semester of the second year of college foreign language study. Students may waive this requirement if they completed the appropriate high school courses. An international baccalaureate course at standard level with a 6 or 7 will suffice. 
*Computer Skills
Students must be able to use computers to collect, organize, analyze and communicate information in an academic environment. Students who do not pass a test demonstrating these competencies must fulfill this requirement by completing an approved course built around these criteria.
*Mathematics 
Trinity requires completion of three years of high school mathematics, including either trigonometry or precalculus, for admission as a first-year student. While there is no further requirement, all students are urged to undertake further study of mathematics at Trinity.

40 percent of students attend graduate school immediately after earning their bachelor's, and 65 percent of all students attend within five years of graduation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.trinity.edu/Documents/student_affairs_docs/Career_Services_docs/Data/11_Graduating_Student_Survey.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121033620/http://web.trinity.edu/Documents/student_affairs_docs/Career_Services_docs/Data/11_Graduating_Student_Survey.pdf |date=January 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An analysis by the Office of Institutional Research indicated that Trinity has made considerable progress in the number of graduates going on to earn doctoral degrees. Of students earning a bachelor's between 1982 and 1986, 2.9% went on to earn doctorates; of those earning a bachelor's between 1997 and 2001, 8.5% had. Trinity improved its ranking in this category from 328th to 38th among other colleges and universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.trinity.edu/x402.xml |website=Trinity University |title=Office of Institutional Research |date= |accessdate=2014-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trinity fields strong teams, evidenced by its finishes in the [[National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics]] (NACDA) Learfield Directors' Cup, which recognizes the strength of athletic programs by division. Since the Directors' Cup inception in 1995, Trinity has finished in the top 10 on five occasions out of over 400 [[NCAA Division III|Division Ill]] programs; it finished 31st in 2017-18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/nacda/sports/directorscup/auto_pdf/2017-18/misc_non_event/May31overallDIII_final.pdf |title=Directors' Cup Division III Final Standings|website=NACDA |date=2018-05-31 |accessdate=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trinity has historically had a strong [[tennis]] program. In 1963, Al G. Hill, Jr, grandson of oilman H L Hunt, entered as a Freshman Tennis Player.  When he graduated in 1967 as Tiger Captain, the College Tennis Courts were named after him. Under the tutelage of Coach Clarence Mabry, Trinity Player [[Chuck McKinley]] won the Wimbledon Singles Championship in 1963 and was rated the #1 men's Singles Player in the World.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Time Magazine |title=One for the Yanks |date=1963-07-12 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,940309,00.html |access-date=2015-06-13 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; With partner [[Dennis Ralston]], McKinley won the US Men's Doubles Championship in 1961, 1963, and 1964. McKinley and Ralston also played all of the matches while winning the Davis Cup for the US in 1963.  All of these accomplishments occurred while McKinley was a Trinity undergraduate.

In 1970, as a Freshman at Trinity, [[Brian Gottfried]] won the [[United States Tennis Association|USTA]] boys 18s Singles Championship, as well as the Doubles Championship with [[Sandy Mayer|Alexander Mayer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ustaboys.com/tournament/past_winners.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929100637/http://ustaboys.com/tournament/past_winners.php|archivedate=2007-09-29|accessdate=24 April 2014|title=USTA Boys 18 &amp; 16: Past Winners}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972 Trinity won the NCAA Division I Men's Tennis Championship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trinity.edu/departments/athletics/Hall_of_Fame/stockton.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205070944/http://www.trinity.edu/departments/athletics/Hall_of_Fame/stockton.htm |date=February 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tiger Captain that year, [[Dick Stockton]], won the NCAA Men's Singles Championship.

In November 2015, Trinity and [[Austin College]] announced they would affiliate with the [[Southern Athletic Association]] for football in 2017. This alliance renews a relationship that ended when the SAA schools split from the SCAC. As a result, the SCAC will no longer offer football as a sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trinitytigers.com/sports/fball/2015-16/releases/151118_fball_saa_affiliate|title=Trinity to Join SAA as Affiliate Member in Football|date=18 November 2015|publisher=|accessdate=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''variorum''', short for ''(editio) cum notis variorum'', is a work that collates all known variants of a text.  It is a work of [[textual criticism]], whereby all variations and emendations are set side by side so that a reader can track how textual decisions have been made in the preparation of a text for publication. The [[Bible]] and the works of [[William Shakespeare]] have often been the subjects of variorum editions, although the same techniques have been applied with less frequency to many other works.

==Etymology==
The word ''variorum'' is Latin for 'of various [persons]' and derives from the phrase ''cum notis variorum'' ('with notes by various people') which was often used in the title-pages of Dutch books of the 17th century.

==Original meaning==
An older meaning of the word refers not to the text itself but to the assortment of illustrative notes printed with it: 'an edition of a text (usually [[Latin]] or [[Greek language|Greek]]) which includes annotations by a variety of critics and commentators'.  Variorum editions of this kind were a speciality of [[Netherlands|Dutch]] publishers of the 17th century, including the house of [[Elsevier]].  In these editions the text is usually taken, with little or no attempt at constructive modification, from a single widely accepted critical edition of the period;  the interest lies in the notes, which often fill three-quarters of each page, and which typically embody the complete commentaries of two or three recognised specialists in the work of the author in question, together with selected passages from several other commentators.  The notes will usually include textual variants, both documented and conjectural, together with examples of parallel usages and (for non-fiction texts) historical information.  Usually some middle-ranking literary man was appointed as general editor; occasionally, however, a first-rate scholar would preside over the edition and include original work of his own within it, [[Nicolas Heinsius]]'s edition of [[Claudius Claudianus|Claudian]] (Elsevier, 1661) being a good example.

==Notable variorum editions==
A variorum of the [[Bible]] has been produced at various times in history and of various scopes. Documenting each line of text with {{em|all}} variants in wording, from {{em|all}} known source documents, presented chronologically, helps translators of the Bible establish primacy and prevalence of various line readings.

There have also been noteworthy variorums of the works of [[William Shakespeare]], including the readings of all [[Folios and Quartos (Shakespeare)|quartos and folios]]; the textual decisions, or choices, of past editors; and a compilation of all critical notes. The first was that of [[Isaac Reed]] in 1803. Variorum editions help editors and scholars understand the historical evolution of the Shakespeare texts, as well as to decode dubious lines and decide upon most likely authorial intent.

[[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' is typically presented in variorum format, with both the 1781 and 1787 editions printed side-by-side in nearly all modern editions.

[[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' went through six editions with extensive changes. The text became a third larger, with numerous parts rewritten five times.  A variorum&lt;ref&gt;Peckham, Morse, ed. (1959), ''The Origin of Species by Charles Darwin, A Variorum Text'', [[Philadelphia]]: [[University of Pennsylvania Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 1959.

There is also a variorum of ''[[Leaves of Grass]]''. [[Walt Whitman]] produced either six or nine editions during his lifetime. The [[New York University Press]] produced a variorum in 1980 of these various editions.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Sculley, Harold W. Blodgett and William White, eds. (1980), ''Leaves of Grass: A Textual Variorum of the Printed Poems, 1855-1891''; 3 vol., (Series: ''The Collected Writings of Walt Whitman''); New York: New York University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[James Strachey]] translation of [[Freud]]'s ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'' in volumes four and five of ''[[The Standard Edition of The Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud]]'' collates eight editions.

[[Rabindranath Tagore]]'s works have been collated to produce a voluminous digital variorum. It can be viewed on the [http://bichitra.jdvu.ac.in Bichitra] website.

A '''Wickelphone''' is a sequence of three letters or symbols, which occur together in a [[word]].  For example, the word ''strip'' may be decomposed into a set of [[trigram]]s such as ''rip'' and ''str'' &amp;mdash; these are Wickelphones.  The term was devised by [[James McClelland (psychologist)|James McClelland]] and [[David Rumelhart]] in reference to the work of [[Wayne Wickelgren]] in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=[[Steven Pinker]], A. Prince |title=Connections and symbols |page=89 |chapter=Language and connectionism |publisher=MIT Press |year=1989 |isbn=978-0-262-66064-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rumelhart and McClelland then extended the idea by expressing the triples in [[phonetic]] terms as '''Wickelfeatures'''.  For example, the Wickelphone ''tri'' would correspond to a Wickelfeature of "[[stop consonant|stop]], [[lateral consonant|lateral]], [[vowel]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |page=98 |title=Social networks and historical sociolinguistics |author=Alexander Bergs |year=2005 |isbn=978-3-11-018310-8 |chapter=Personal pronouns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
